"Vote for Biden! He's the only thing standing between us and Fascism!"  Cute how you think electoral politics will stop a Fascist that doesn't want to be stopped. Voting won't save us if he goes full tilt Hitler. Sorry.
The union may have endorsed Biden but that doesn't mean the union members will vote for him....
I don’t fuck with people who support sexual predators. Yes, this includes Biden supporters
I am voting for Joe Biden and every down-ballot Democrat, not out of spite, not out of some loyalty to party, but to save my country from destruction. There is no other way. We all must do this. We must send a message that the GOP is irreparably broken and needs to lose badly.
November. But I personally think dems shot themselves in the foot by propping Mr. Biden up, they can’t honestly think he has a chance right? The guy is a joke, a walking punch line, and that’s only if he’s not taking a nap at a press conference or something.
Brand New is uncancelled if you elect Joe Biden.

"I can't believe you won't vote for Biden. Don't you care about how many people will die?"   Nope, in fact I'm hoping I'm one of them.
And this is why I won't vote for Democrats. I'm so done. I'm voting strictly down ballot. Joe Biden and The Democrats are dead to me.

The answer to your question is most likely January of 2021 when Joe Biden is president and there’s a federal Dem trifecta to do it right.
Trying to lose so they can start their own right wing fascist party. They know they’ve got 40% of the electorate right now that’ll go with them. They’ll appeal to the lowest moral common denominator during a Biden presidency. Make the Tea Party stuff look like a real tea party.
Let’s be honest. Both candidates are awful. Trump’s mouth, tweets and ego are an embarrassment to our nation while Biden, when he can remember where he is, wants to turn America into a socialist European style country totally controlled by the elite class. We lose either way.
If Bernie had won, those shitty centrists wouldn't have voted for him anyways. Because they hate him as much as we hate Biden. Lest we forget how many of those who wanted HRC voted for McCain over Obama.
Oh, donnie you're ALWAYS right....I didn't know you &amp; Vice President Biden spoke....Did he call you ....?? 430,000 ppl still managed 2 walk right in....Oh, well...Ya lose some...   ya win some...it's only 145,000 deaths...well, &amp; counting!!
biden will not win in Arizona unless ballot stuffing takes place.  But then again, the ballots were stuffed in the 2018 election in Maricopa County.
I'm sure all y'all #Evangelicals will be ready to line up and blindly support Biden if he wins, right?   Because winning election = God's Chosen, right?
So hypothetically speaking, this could happen if Biden is elected President?  Boris, you do realize this IS happening under Trump's watch already, right? I mean hello, earth to Boris.

I was gonna vote for Biden, but his Bros are just so toxic.
It amazes me when people say Biden has a declining mental capacity. Uh, have you watched Trump the last 3.5 years? Sweet Jesus, he has like a 30 word vocabulary...if that. #biglydumb

Moms for Biden should have psychological evaluations to see if they are fit to be parents. In fact their kids are lucky to be alive and not aborted.

Basically all Joe Biden needs to do at this point is show up on voting day to win this election. Trump is sinking the entire GOP party all by himself. Every day. All day. Who needs millions in campaign donations to produce attack ads when your opponent offers it up for free?
He has been on real news stations! Fox isn't Entertainment station. Biden can win without speaking another word until election day. Trumps going down.

Hey little fella give me your address so I can send you a pair of big blue shoes and a rainbow colored wig. You don’t have to answer the Biden Question, I already know you answer, Biden is not fit. Keep deflecting and telling yourself whatever you to need so you “feel” better.
Joe Biden ad that says all Trump wants is to divide us is perfectly ironic
is Bill running?  I thought it was Biden.
this is priceless.  Epstein partied with Bill Clinton...  and to think I was positive that  it was JOE BIDEN who was running   against donny
Let's let VP Biden make the choice. He will have to work with that person. Get off his back...he has a darn tough job ahead of him. Just give it a rest.
Even Biden had more simultaneous viewers than that
Look there some crazy and goofy people Biden is considering but Bass is in her own league of crazy.
In the basement with #Biden
We've all had those moments where you have no idea what the actual hell to Tweet. Just do what I do sometimes. Tweet your thoughts. Or Tweet about how bad of a president Trump is and how much better Biden would be.
Always believe the woman Biden said, right  ?
Rather than do actual work, House Democrats are subpoenaing Secretary Pompeo because they think he helped "advance a conspiracy theory" about Joe Biden.  We're in the middle of a pandemic, and this is what Democrats are doing right now.
Hope you’re wrong Mike, he needs spirited youthful look that leaves Harris who was quite close to Biden family. No grudges palm note may be the clue?
Why oh why do democrats eat their own? ANY woman Biden picks will be fine. They are ALL excellent. Plus...they will be debating a Qtip.
That’s Joe Biden statement.” You bet Joe will keep us safe.”
Biden won’t know who he is or where he is by next week.
Also, Biden will bring that by himself. Susan Rice is the only one who covers your points - and they aren't the most important. And, again, Biden covers rebuilding ally's trust all by himself.
No doubt Juan heard Biden differently than Emily. Suspect Juan heara Biden differently than everyone does. #TheFive
🤣🤣🤣 You liberals are a treat. Anything to deflect. Still avoiding the Biden question. It must be exhausting being a liberal. Mental Gymnastics all day long.
Last time was Biden. He told Obama he would not be running. But I'm not holding that against him now because he was the consensus candidate who can beat Trump.
And he's blaming the Portland stuff on Biden.  He said this will be Biden's way if Biden is elected president.   What bullshit!!
Really not though. Biden became VP partly because he told Obama he'd have to Presidential ambitions - or none that would interfere for 8 years. They did well.
Biden has never said Defund the police! And everything you just said about Biden is exactly to a T describing Trump! But add lying, fake conspiracy theories and blame everybody but himself mentality! And it takes somebody with those same characteristics to vote for him
Where's hunter Biden?
This a.m. on ABC15 PHX I saw two "Joe Biden's America" ads on the morning news. Of course the footage of destruction is from tRUmp's America.
Here we go...1st of 3 debates to go..,chickenshit blow hard Biden backs out !
Clintons are the absolute worse among the privileged assholes sharing the government monopoly we all must deal with as it crushes us beneath barely hidden racism &amp; fascism Biden, another architect of misery, could do even worse than Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. Let that sink in.
A Biden/Harris ticket would be MONEY. I know there are some amazing choices, but come on people. This ticket would clean house.

All of these cult followers Dobbs Rogan all of these Fox idiots were dead wrong yeah Biden you nailed it her running scared and should be

I also am voting Biden.
Who cares. When Biden loses, they will be a trivia question
I've been told that i'm smarter than Joe Biden, so lets give this test of yours a try...  Uhhh / Duhhh / Doyeee / Durrr / Huhhh
I’m going  because not voting for Biden. Never ever choosing a “lesser evil” again because there is no such thing in politics.
I'm pretty angry #Tsarnev will get another shot at life.  #BostonBomber Russia tried to warn Biden Obama and Hillary, but she let them in anyway.  Instead of treating him like an American, he should have his VISA revoked and let Chechnya or ? deal with his illegal *ss.
Actually, men (and women) HAVE said that about Biden. It's why nobody expects him to run in 2024 and are looking to his VP to carry on his administration's legacy instead.
8 miserable destructive yrs under Obama/Biden. Foreclosures on homes..jobs lost..people on food stamps &amp; welfare. People lost hope by the evil run government. Pres trump brought back hope &amp; patriotism back to America. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 🇺🇸
Sadly, Yes.  Come January 21st, I will start letting my complaints about Biden be known.  I hear you, and since I'm not a Black woman, I'll follow you on this for sure.
Uhmm, you shouldn't add those 2 together... It's % of voters by voting type. So you add the same voting type/different candidates together to get 100% (if you include 3rd party).   So for by mail: Biden (32) +Trump (65) +3rd party (3)  =100%.
You’re still on this?? And YES, I am voting Biden. Not excited about it, but it’s necessary. And my profile used to say MAGA.  No more. (Independent now, for Biden.)
Exactly! Biden is running a campaign video in Arizona with Trump holding a Bible like it's a bad thing. Incredible. smh.

How insulting that Trump &amp; Pence think that we’re so stupid to think that Biden (who is universally respected) will destroy the country anymore than they have in one term. I have never felt less safe than I do now with Trump/Pence at the helm.
Unfortunately, a vote for Biden or getting rid of Trump does not fix this. Good luck.

The one good thing about Biden’s potential presidency is that this time we are going to smell the bullshit from the jump.
Love it , I’m not going and Biden and other dems not. Mayb Lindsey or Mc Russian
Three corrupt motherfuckers who paved the way for a Trump presidency. And the frameworks of deceit and corruption they constructed remain in place to disastrous effect today. I'd add Clinton 2 &amp; Biden, also.
BREAKING: Biden wants a "Yes" woman as VP
I dunno, I feel like considering Joe Biden's age, the person he chooses as VP really ought to be ready to become the president.
Sum bout how hard Joe Biden tryna get down with the niggas don’t sit right wit me 🧐
Good grief,  please cut the sexist crap. ALL presidential candidates and former candidates have a sizable ego... as do you. Was Biden a bad VP because he eventually ran for president himself... a third time? Or was that okay because he’s a man?
Actually, I’m for Biden. But if most Americans do vote by mail (if millions do!), then it’ll take weeks to get a result. And there will be all kinds of problems.   Remember Florida in 2000?   But, I’m bored with this.. Bye.💋
Biden can win by letting tRump lose. Keep tRump loaded with ammo. He will repeatedly shoot himself.
Who uses a eulogy to play politics? Biden/Obama Who cared more about winning an election than American lives? Biden/Obama
Lie! 42%, behind Biden by 6.
Anyone chosen will be a thrall to Democrat corruption, so who cares. We'll need to deal with Biden and whoever after they're elected, unfortunately.
I just want a fair election. If there’s any fraud, it’ll most likely benefit Biden.  For “the world’s greatest democracy”, voting in the USA is very sloppy. Now no one wants anyone to show ID to vote, and now “mass mailing” of ballots to millions of people.

I have no idea who that is. I’m not saying the guys good, don’t confuse that. I just don’t think Biden by any means is a savior
Where is Joe Biden's leadership during this pandemic. Nothing but effortless platitudes and sloganeering from the "great" (non)leader.
I really don’t think he’s much better, before covid im not sure there’s anything Trump was doing to run the country into the ground. One thing Biden would be better at is uniting the country over racial injustice.
I suspect the Democrat plan is for Biden and his female VP to enter the White House, then after a short time Biden will resign as President and the US will have its first Woman President.
Do you think Biden should even bother debating him?
Is Biden better? They both suck. How have we came to this? Best thing Is that corna keeps up so Biden doesn’t have to debate, you know that. I just don’t understand how these are the two candidates. It’s crazy
Chica, I totally agree. I was just thinking this morning that maybe I should take a week off and bury my head in the sand w the rest. Extreme precaution w Covid and ridin’ w Biden but I’m exhausted. Not sleeping and go to bed w disgust and wake up the same.
So, what are we thinking?  A Biden/Pelosi ticket?  Haven't heard rumors on that front-- why not?
Trump can't navigate a handicapped ramp without help,  drink with one hand, and can't answer a simple question without automatically rambling on about an unrelated subject.  Biden has had a stutter his whole life he has worked to overcome. Maybe fuck yourself with that bullshit.

Stephanie- Biden is going to NEED A LOT OF INVESTIGATORS/LAWYERS/PROSECUTORS/ LAWMAKERS to FIX/PREVENT IN FUTURE ALL TRUMP HAS BROKEN. What a mess he’s created.
If the election happened today, and the polls were as wrong as they were in 2016, Biden would have over 300 electoral votes.  Embarrassing comment.
Tell the truth about greedy Biden/Sanders student supporters whining about their student loans and how willing they are to embrace socialism to alleviate their bills. Paint the real Socialism picture, no free enterprise, just the govt doling out meaningless jobs.
Next we'll find out Biden's announcement will be in mid-September. Just name Kamala already and stop screwing around.   For bonus points I am beginning to think that Jill Biden is opposed to  #KHive
Dems are always loaded with “passion.” Biden won’t have to pick on that one quality- it’s everywhere in excess.
Honestly if the trump wing of the party gets beaten down hard enough and Biden pushes for compromise they could caucus a few republicans.
This is what they do, and the very reason Biden is hidden in a basement somewhere. They have the next election so rigged he doesn't have to attend a debate or campaign. It terrifying actually.

The CCP is not our friend. They have made that very clear for decades. Ignore the propaganda and hit the CCP even harder. All the more reason to keep Biden out. He has been peter puffing  The CCP his entire career.
1.) Character limit 2.) Personally disliking someone and policies are different.  I dislike Biden and Obama too but all for various reasons
The great thing is that both these great women will be part of the Biden team, along with an amazing list of others. Finally, no empty positions, no temporary and unqualified idiots, not suck ups who only care about their own gain.
Well no, it's not ok. Biden has it in his head that joking about Trump's tweets is something that people care about when in reality nobody really gives a fuck about trump vs Bidens tweets, people just need healthcare. Honestly it's not that hard to understand

This is 2016 all over again...the closer we get to the election the crazier the Dems get and common sense tells me they are losing and they know it.  The 12% advantage Biden supposedly had in polls a week ago has now lost 30% of that advantage.  More BS just like Russia!
I disagree. Biden has an important skill that Trump has proven is critically lacking in his Admin. Biden can &amp; will build a team of our country’s best to run our agencies &amp; fill his cabinet. Trump has run off the best of the Republicans. We have a fourth string team under him.
It's the attempt to bypass #VoterID.  We don't believe in 112% voting counting dead people and illegal citizens, while Obama/Biden/Dems do think it's okie dokie.  #VoterFraud
If President Biden and team go after him yes. I think alot more criminal activity will be found after hes gone.

Just a reminder that Fox, Brightfart, Levin (that stupid little fraud) is out to defeat Biden
You're holding him accountable for fixing what?? Anyone could grab our pics and our names and say that we've failed for 30 years. You sound like you're a hard working guy...would that be fair? The Lincoln Project are all Republican. Biden's pandemic plan is there. Check it out.
Biden team talks economic development with Native American business leaders
My point is that you are all jargon, soundbites and no perspective. Your meme is, of course, without any testable arguments. What was supposed to do that he failed to deliver? On the opposite end, can you name something he's done well? Do you know Biden is my point?
I’m not a Trumpster.   I’m voting for Biden.  Although still haven’t heard him say what he wants to do.  (And he’s been around 40 years and hasn’t done much yet.) But Trump’s just too divisive for his few good ideas.
Trump probably wants to delay the election so he can stay in the White House for a little while longer...  Funny that he thinks he has so much power. He thinks he's a king. He's probably scared of the election because he knows he isn't going to win against Biden.

No. He needs to support Biden. The alternative does not demonstrate a higher level of integrity, which is what you suggest. The alternative reduces safety &amp; security for people both here &amp; across the globe. We can’t fight the status quo &amp; vote Biden. Let’s get Biden on board.
A Joe Biden victory will be because of this guy and you can’t convince me otherwise.

Unfortunately people will see this and (again...still) think the pandemic was organized to help Biden. 🤦🏼‍♀️
Look at Biden's history of failure. It's right there to see. Can you give us one thing he has accomplished?
His comment did stereotype, which itself is not cool. I agree with you and so does a good chunk of Americans. That doesn't make him a racist. Biden isn't perfect, but he's done more for this country than you know. At least read his Wikipedia page. :)
I think Susan Rice. Its just a feeling. But she is close to Biden has executive experience as ambassador to the UN, and has no legislative baggage.
Thank you 🙏🏽 pray no Biden he said he will undo all Trump has done !
We have two bad choices for President in 202, but if you were truly capable of demonstrating objectivity you would see that Trump is much more dangerous to our national security &amp; rule of law than Biden.   When Trumps interests conflict w/the nation’s, he serves himself above all
I'm not a racist period...never have been nor will I be. You're drawing your own conclusions from a soundbite taken out of context. If Biden was racist, it would be clear...like Trump. Trump publicly demonstrates it.

Joe Biden is an actual racist. 🤣 Seeing Dems praise him while calling Trump supporters racist for supporting Trump is comedy Gold. What half-wits.
FACT CHECK:  Biden did not explicitly tie xenophobia to the travel restriction. His tweet reflects coronavirus remarks he made during a campaign stop in Iowa Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced.
FACT CHECK:  Biden tweeted: "We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump's record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency."
Joe Biden is literally everything the left claims Trump is. So I find this whole election to be rather amusing.

They claimed  was kneeling to support BLM in front of a flag. Instead he was kneeling to draw a 4 yr old in for a sniff.
Gutfeld on Joe Biden's 'America First' strategy  via
Yes the Recession that started in 2007, before Obama took office, hit bottom in 2008/09, people forget Obama inherited an economy on the brink of collapse and it took years to recover.  If Biden wins the Republicans will say, "everytime a Democrat takes office the Economy is bad"
Wubya with the A+ reflexes! 45 could never lol. Neither would Biden lol. Quite impressive lol
The thing is that there is no Biden scandal they can fabricate or uncover that is worse than the MANY scandals and failures of Trump and his F team.
Chicken little speaking again, don’t worry you will lose to Biden
Calculated twitter bomb, just as many of the others. Create intense angst on the left, MSM and Biden Campaign. The distractions and intense hateful smears propel President Trump to the WIN!
Exactly, a calculated twitter bomb. Create such a ruckus, hysteria and distraction on the left, MSM, and Biden campaign... Trump cruises to the WIN!
Joe Biden will NOT be my president lmao sorry
Can we all admit that all the people who should run for president are too smart to run? There’s no way Biden or Trump should be president. We are so screwed

A tweet from #Biden in OCTOBER! #RealPresident
I wish Biden knew what is going on. I’d think about voting for him. Unfortunately he doesn’t have a clue😎
That’s all I needed to hear. You’ve got my vote! I’m bringing my +1. My 83 year old mother has flipped. She’s on the Biden train!
A president who doesn’t fund terrorism or abortion receives the harsh sickle knifed into by you Democrats Liberals Brotherhood even in 1793 when you were born you were corrupt you are the  world terrorism which sits on your shoulders like a mallet !  Obama Biden Clinton !
You clearly don't know Biden if you trust him. If you know Biden and trust him then you must be a racist pedophile like he is. He's insulted our black brothers and sisters for decades. Other than a vote he cares nothing about the people of the USA. PROVE ME WRONG!
We saw how the October surprise strategy turned for access Hollywood and trump. At least on the scandal / ethics  front, joe Biden is in better shape than Hillary.
You would think if the trump team or the media or the ‘Russians’ have some dirt on biden roll out they would have by now to create that drumbeat unless they put all marbles on October surprise.
He’s too old and out of it? Hunter Biden hasn’t really caught on ? Biden has not shown up in the #JeffreyEpsteindidntkillhimself #GhislaineMaxwell stuff. The Bernie crowd doesn’t hate Biden like they did Clinton and her surrogates.
Thought this was The Celebration of Life for John Lewis. Certainly NOT a campaign rally for Joe Biden. Completely inappropriate.
Will putting ⁦ on his ticket for the White House keep ⁦ and ⁦ out of the big house? #TWGRPS
Trump and Biden, Demented brothers in mayhem.
My favorites are: 1. WARREN (who’d be the best at governing w/Biden, great policy person, best debater against Pence).  2. HARRIS (but I’d rather see her as AG).  3. RICE (but I’d rather see her as Sec. of State or Natl Security Advisor). All 3 are quality folks. Joe wins w/all.
get the national guard to man the polling sites because I will walk my 64 year old behind across ground glass bare footed to vote for Joe Biden
When Trump shut down travel Biden and Bernie called him racist but like, was that not exactly what was needed? They actively sabotaged Trump at our expense. And both parties passed those horrid bailout bills. Only Massie, a Kentucky Republican, was honest with us about that.
Does that address Biden?  Oh I guess not. Nice diversion
Nothing more than lying rhetoric so if you lose to Biden, you can contest it and say "its fraudulent, I warned about this" to try and hold onto power.  I'm not buying it.  I've voted through the mail for 12 years.  Not had any issues with it.
funny to read liberal idiots calling TUCKER CARLSON RACIST!!!! Because Tucker doesn't march in step with them. THANK GOD HE DOESN'T. Thank GOD actual SMART people don't march in step with them. Hell even Joe Biden in the polls is starting to lose to TRUMP. Gonna be fun!
Melissa, you may have a lot of words but you need to be able to string them together in a coherent and thoughtful way.   Otherwise you’re just like Joe Biden
I think Biden, like your father, can also identify a picture of an elephant. Unfortunately, you only know it by the tail you cut off after you murder it.
So kind of like Biden 😂😂😂
Absolutely. No question. Heard what #Biden said? Guys an idiot.
Who ?? Biden ??? Cause it fasho ain’t me lol
Biden could pick a flower for all I care I'll STILL VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO
Because that *is* the Democratic Party. It’s racist, sexist and homophobic. That’s why Biden is the candidate. So many better to pick from but we were told Dems wouldn’t vote for anyone other than a white man.  Huge disappointment in the party beginning in 2016.
You’re either deteriorating faster than Biden or this is a serious cry for help.
Pay tribute? Obama gave a Biden campaign speech! #Communists
LoL. So funny. Just because Biden is unhealthy to be nice. You people are going to try and say our President isn't  healthy. We will say in the debate who is healthy and who is not. #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Of course not because ⁦ ⁦ is a Russian tory! Nunes won't say if he got foreign info meant to damage Biden
To clear it up I don’t think you’re racist if you vote for Biden😂  You just can’t tell someone they racist if they vote for trump , then turn around and endorse another racist
has gotten valise and made information for a UKR source who he setup when he was there. The so call evidence tries to hurt Biden but it’s false and made up .  he was talk to Trump when I found this out
R’s, from top to base, hate their fellow Americans. They’ll take the hit so long as others hurt. It’s telling that the few former trump voters who say they’ll be voting Biden almost all complain about how they’re in pain. Most magas are delighted, even as they’re evicted.
These aren’t the only polls though &amp; Biden’s numbers have drastically fell from last month
I’m a mom and I support Biden. Your father in law is demented.
That wasn't a eulogy. That was a desperate cry for help to elect Biden because they are all f*cked.
If Biden gets elected he's going to be the first president to get bullied by other countries
But Biden spoke at Grand Wizards funeral
Uh, mom here.  What's best for my children is to NOT DIE.  I'll trust Biden to safely open schools, not the Orange Menace who wants to use our kids to improve his poll numbers.
You mean no more "Every night is Purge night in Biden-land" and "Granny got raped and it's Joe Biden's fault"? Because those are the only two commercials I have seen from Trump, and they suck ass.
If it's discovered that Rudy is a regular at Epstein Island...  That will totally ruin Rudy's "evidence" that Biden made billions off Ukraine  Nervous yet Donnie?!?
You should be more concerned with how bad Joe Biden is going to lose...the only positive things is that his dementia will stop him from comprehending the beating he received....
Thank you, VP Biden.  You're gonna make a hell of a president
Boring Biden is good.  Trump fasism, No Bueno!
Actually neither. Who Biden picks as his VEEP isn't going to change my vote. Joe could pick his imaginary friend from his early childhood as VEEP, I'd still vote for him. 🇺🇸💙🌊
Now do Joe Biden.
He tripled-down at the presser. Denounce him and announce your intention to vote for Biden.
Maybe when Biden gets in office our country will have the political will to try at least?
No President has been comparable to a fascist dictator...until today's attempt to postpone an election (was not even done in Civil War...)  #No.  Reality gives you a binary choice:  Biden &amp; Democracy or Trump &amp; Authoritarianism.  Sadly, it is this black-and-white
The “Cocomelon” videos my toddler watches on YouTube have a bunch of Joe Biden ads. Joe is absolutely going to crush the under 3 demographic. Olivia absolutely hates malarkey.
Honestly, I think if we go to Biden it goes back to the good ol boys running things. So I’m pretty up in the air, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Biden won. I wouldn’t stereotype myself as a trumper. Just someone who’s really tired of American politics.
It could, we will see that would mean Biden would have to win. With his voting record he doesn't have the backing the media is claiming.
And that fact that people think we only have Trump and Biden to choose from LUL
People really think Biden is better then Trump.
He needs to pick a VP with 2 brains since Biden has lost his!
2021 will be an excellent year with Joe Biden as President..... American democracy will survive the current inept and corrupt fascist regime
I heard you say that Biden's comments on the breakfast club got you upset. I am so happy to hear that. For a minute, I was wondering how could he say such things with out consequence.
Well he only got 7-8% of the black vote in 2016 and won. He has done more for blacks than Obama / Biden so he should get 15-20% of the black vote this time. If he does, he will win by a landslide
I don’t think Joe Biden could do ANYTHING to make this country less safe than it is now, today, under you, your Republican Party, and the Stable Genius/Friend of Dictators and Despots....
This is like the 14th time I've done this to  or   The time to complain about Biden is after change of occupant at 1600 Penn. Ave.  There are more people than just you making sacrifices to vote. #JohnLewis  Squeaker=#Fail - has to be a blowout. 🚫Selfish
Progressive is being co-opted by the middle.  Biden calls himself a progressive.  The back to normalcy crowd just think it sounds nice.
Much respect to you sir. Let's bury the hatchet and act in the best interest of the United States of America! Biden 2020!
Congrats if you're preemptively blaming fellow citizens for Biden's failure  That's exactly what your masters want you to do so you aren't watching their fuckery
If Biden wins, this is a sneak peek of what America will be like. You are an enemy of the people. Treasonous is another way to put it. Coordinate to over throw the Gov is treason. They have too much power! Break them up or hold them accountable.
We moms will decide that for ourselves. And I’d choose Biden a kajillion trillion times over Trump.
Much safer in Joe Biden's America than Trump/Pence Russian satellite Fascist country
...EXACTLY.....Q is an INTROSPECTIVE NARCISSISTIC EXCUSE to be lazy and tune out.... besides that...... if Q is our only hope..... WELCOME BIDEN NOW!
GREAT QUESTION for  HOW MANY BLACK AMERICANS have you hired since leaving office? TRUMP HAS HIRED THOUSANDS IN BUSINESS. How many have you hired? 2? 3? or NONE. Tell us!! How many has BIDEN hired? 2? 3? TRUMP BEATS YOU ALL BADLY!
Dr Fauci with Cooper and Gupta again answering viewer questions.   Look at the minds of the people who vote Biden.   "Which schooling option is safer: online, or in person with masks and social distancing?"  #MORONS  REALLY?  That's what we're dealing with. Below idiot I.Q.'s
Right. According to Biden he wasn't black anyway because he was a Trump supporter. According to Dems in power he should have stayed in the gutter where he could have been plyed with food stamps and state assistance. He broke their 'black mold'
You all keep sharing and roasting the “Settle for Biden” accounts as if you all aren’t unironically going to vote for him in November 🤦🏻
What has Joe Biden done?
Will Joe Biden swear to accept the election result ON ELECTION NIGHT? Or does he intend to use the army of 500+ lawyers he’s assembled to obscure the vote?
Want to energize independents and conservatives in the United States then have Obama campaign for Biden! #Trump2020
Remember the old adage “United We Stand, Divided We Fall”? Joe Biden will create much more division than the Left already has. This country will burn at his feet.
Do we really want Joe dementia Biden to be our next president? Hell no!!
You supported the woman who came forward against Biden? #Hypocrite #redskins #racistblackface #whostheboss #youtoo #

No I’m talking to you. You said money is being distributed to biden voters. Which ones? Cuz it wasn’t me. So who do you mean?
Trump is not the root or source of people’s anger. People were angry before and that’s the reason they elected trump because they were tired of the bureaucracy that had been there for so long, Biden is no better than Hillary in fact he’s worse. That’s why I will still vote trump
I'm a mom. You don't speak for me. I'm Ridin with Biden.
He’s listening to doctors and scientists unlike you folks who believe in conspiracy theories and untruths.  Don’t you worry your pretty little head off Kimmie, moms and grandmothers like me will be voting for Joe Biden. Now go eat some cake.
Democrats put a criminal and a guy with dementia up against him. Put somebody worth a shit that doesn’t threaten to take away constitutional rights and trump wouldn’t win. We don’t want trump we just really don’t want Clinton and Biden.
This is true.  Anyone supporting Democrats or their policies is by definition a racist and dishonest.  First time voters need to do some serious research... #Biden2020 #Biden2020Landslide #JoeBidenForPresident2020 #JoeBiden #biden #dnc #cnn #cbs #nbc #Democrat #PelosiMustGo

Number one, what about the other 44% who aren't ready for schools to reopen, prob because they don't think its safe?   And how many of your 56% only want schools to open if they know it's safe?   Biden cares about our children, Trump does not. Trump only cares about the optics.
No worries.   will play a very important role TBD in the Biden Administration.
Joe Biden has constantly handled China with kid gloves.  President  is the first president in modern history to finally start holding China accountable for their many abuses.  The debate isn't even hard.
WOW O.0 o.0 O.o so many reasons for impeachment. Our system, more than just Congress, is now broken. Needs repair. Needs not-Trump. Needs Biden.
Obviously the media over there are not trying to get Joe Biden elected, much lower bar in terms of truth telling.
Trump is killing us daily but stupid #NeverBiden Bernie Bros are more concerned about Biden mispronouncing a word. Idiots!
I would crawl through a river of shit like Andy Dufresne to vote for Mark Kelly &amp; Joe Biden even if the polls showed them ahead 99% to 1%.  They all need to be humiliated.  Not just defeated.
Trump is actively working against black people but #NeverBiden Bernie bros are more concerned about Biden saying “You ain’t black”. These people are stupid.
Even the anti-American NY Post rats see their futures circling the drain if Biden gets in a real office...
And Biden wouldn’t remember WHAT he tweeted 2 minutes later!😂
True! That's why we're voting Biden, to stop America to become Russia's bitch #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

If RNC dumps Trump because he's a loser, its going to be harder for Biden.  IMHO.

I am just so blown away by this thread. Still crying. No wonder Barack Obama chose THIS man, Joe Biden, to be his VP.
Omg what an incredible piece. I thank you for it and can honestly say I have never been MORE for Joe Biden as our President, than I am right now. Still crying as I type.
Is this why to felt you and Biden could illegally use the fisa courts against our current president? And Obama works to keep those old race wounds festering - rather then working towards peace.

#Biden called it. And #FoxNews gave him credit. Tides are changing.
Biden should choose Obama for his VP.
LMAO don't want to talk about any of the criminal issues Obama had? How about Biden getting his son out of trouble not once but twice in Ukraine? Why is Biden under Criminal indictment for the same things you all impeached trump for? I'm curious why the hypocrisy?
Yeah Jonathan or whatever your name is please make sure to apologize to the future president joe Biden for your nonsense.
Not all during any other administration LMAO Like when Obama/Biden paid Iran after they had bounties on American troops? Fast and Furious where the Obama admin was giving guns to drug cartels....shall we continue. Every president has had their shit.
I'll throw in Seminole County. It hasn't gone for a democratic president since Truman in 1948 and Biden will likely need to win it by a few points.
Won't happen, although Biden could crack 400-plus Electoral College votes.
They'll have to lose four election cycles to change, and they won't. They'll fight Biden tooth and nail till the 2022 midterm, lose with whomever they pick in 2024, but likely gain seats in 2026 because Americans have short memories.

I hope that this is a chance for you to expose even more wrongdoings on behalf of the cabal. Hopefully you will freely mention publicly Valerie Jarrett Barack Obama Joe Biden Comey and the rest. Use it to make a public spectacle of the coup
If Biden wins the election, he only needs to hold the office for 90 days, then he could step down ( due to health reasons) and his female V.P. would automatically step in and become the President. 😳
I think she would do nicely ? Although I hope Biden has chilled his frat boy ways cause she I do not think put up with it.
All these commentators were referring to Biden
Then I guess trump shouldn’t be trying to delegitimize his win, if he’s so confident he can beat Biden.

Why on earth would any well informed sensible person vote for Biden? How can you fail to see how hard Trump has fought for the peopleof the USA? Keep sleeping and we will keep fighting to keep the constitution so we keep freedom.
Give me one reason you're voting for Biden without using the word Trump
We will see. People in the media and his fellow colleagues have been saying hes more left now than hes ever been before. Some people can change, and biden will bring about change. Remember hes only going to last one term, so VP is more important tbh
Joe Biden is going to try and refuse to debate Donald Trump. He cannot hold a thought or keep a conversation for more than 30 seconds. He will be a coward and refuse to debate.
Yep. And Donald Trump will win!  A delay would probably benefit the Biden campaign. He will become less and less cognizant and people will have more confidence his VP will take over quickly - that is the strategy on the left, isn’t it?
He wasn’t a Democratic activist. He was kicked out. He hated Biden. He hated BLM, he hated  the Obamas, Clinton’s. That is no Democratic activist. and all his rhetoric is straight out of Trumps playbook.He is a very sick person.
Donald Trump may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the best medicine usually is not the best tasting. Joe Biden is barely a PLACEBO - and whoever his running mate is will be the typical nasty side effects!
Bernie's supporting him, helping election. Biden's the candidate to save our democracy. He has progressive wants in his plan. Do you even know what his plan contains. Bernie people must vote for bernie. Four more years of trump will mean we NEVER have Bernie's vision inplemented.

Me too. I love  But I don’t think Biden is showcasing a joint Biden/Warren fundraiser on the Fri before announcing his VP choice if it’s her. Gotta believe Warren knows it’s not her. This is a Dem “unity” sign &amp; Warren’s a super fundraiser. Do it before she’s not picked.
In other news, Trump has stopped endlessly running those Biden/anarchy &amp; violence ads here in PHX.
And neither is Biden!
NAFTA, crime bill, Iraq war, Patriot Act.Trump isn’t good on these things either but he reason he won in 2016 was by opposing those things.All he has to do is remind America who Biden really is and that’s all they should need. Instead they act like they’re running against Bernie
Idk the Trump campaign and his mouthpieces on Fox News really appear to be dropping the ball to me. Nobody who’s been alive more than 10 years seriously believes that Biden is a “radical leftist”. They could focus on Biden’s record of policies he supported that got Trump elected.
But media will immediately give them all a free pass.
Thank God Joe Biden is not in charge now. Death toll would be tripled

Oh they will accept it. We've had to accept the criminal in the WH for four years. We are going to follow the law. Let's make that loud and clear. When trump loses, the military steps in  Poll: Most Trump voters say they won't accept results if Biden wins
Also, Biden will bring that by himself. Susan Rice is the only one who covers your points - and they aren't the most important. And, again, Biden covers rebuilding ally's trust all by himself.
Last time was Biden. He told Obama he would not be running. But I'm not holding that against him now because he was the consensus candidate who can beat Trump.
Really not though. Biden became VP partly because he told Obama he'd have to Presidential ambitions - or none that would interfere for 8 years. They did well.

🤔 you’re sounding a lot like bumbling Biden these days. Might want to check your meds, something is definitely off.
These men are afraid Kamala Harris will challenge the white male stranglehold on politics, and it's exactly why Biden should pick Harris. White men had their shot and they've damn near destroyed the republic. Go play golf, Ed, your time is over.
Sadly, Yes.  Come January 21st, I will start letting my complaints about Biden be known.  I hear you, and since I'm not a Black woman, I'll follow you on this for sure.
#GOPCorruptionOverCountry #TrumpThreatensAmerica  Serious question; what is everyone doing to ensure a Biden win and to #TakeTheSenateBack
Seems to me, you don't care about actually resolving any issues but are just blinded by hate for Trump and the GOP. That's no path forward. They are all evil. Pelosi, McConnell. Trump, Biden.
Love it , I’m not going and Biden and other dems not. Mayb Lindsey or Mc Russian
Good grief,  please cut the sexist crap. ALL presidential candidates and former candidates have a sizable ego... as do you. Was Biden a bad VP because he eventually ran for president himself... a third time? Or was that okay because he’s a man?
And we are still in Iraq. Biden voted and supported the Iraq war for years. Same with Afghanistan war. Dems and Republicans are equally responsible. Let's not forget who put Trump there, the Dems.
I have no idea who that is. I’m not saying the guys good, don’t confuse that. I just don’t think Biden by any means is a savior
I really don’t think he’s much better, before covid im not sure there’s anything Trump was doing to run the country into the ground. One thing Biden would be better at is uniting the country over racial injustice.
Is Biden better? They both suck. How have we came to this? Best thing Is that corna keeps up so Biden doesn’t have to debate, you know that. I just don’t understand how these are the two candidates. It’s crazy
Not sold on IA or MT electing Democratic Senators while also voting for Trump. If anything you'd see split ticketing the other way, a vote for Biden but a Republican Senate as a check.
Biden was partly or mostly behind:  Crime bill, bankruptcy bill, police militarization, Iraq War, coups in Latin America, etc...  I don't support Trump nor Biden   I have great issues with someone xenophobically pushing the debunked russiagate instead of focusing on real issues.

You can’t be saved! I get it. It’s ok.  Vote democrat it’s not going to matter.  Beijing Biden is not going to win the election.
You see Biden as functioning adult? Adult maybe, but functioning? I guess you do not see as clearly as you think you do.
There are no candidates right now actually qualified for president. Trump can't handle a  Pandemic or protests. Biden is the architect of our issues. Jo just wants nothing left. Howie parrots Russiagate.
A true Biden voter!
Best friend just told me she’s still not sure if she can bring herself to vote for Biden. 😑 🤬 She’s big on 2A and anti-abortion. Basically told her come Nov 3rd  🎶You either with me or against me, Ho🎶  And then I signed up to phone bank for Biden.
Disgusting bastard! Prison for Bill Clinton, prison for Hillary Clinton, prison for Barack Obama, prison for Joe Biden, etc etc etc!
Can't wait until November when Biden in, Trump out
We know what the results are, Biden in, Trump out
And who owns the CLOSEST island to Epstein? Biden's BROTHER!
- the third leg of #traitortrump plan to set up authoritarian regime here...
Pretty sure Obama and Biden created more jobs than trump. Drove unemployment down and saved multiple industries. Trump gave tax cuts to rich people and drove our deficit through the roof.
Biden is very ignorant
Weird Biden was VP and things were fine. He’s a much better option than the shit storm we’re in now. Actually anyone is. A rock could do a better job.
It's up to all of us #KeyboardWarriors especially those with a huge following to flood Twitter with the horrors of socialism! Expose Biden Obama for the corrupt government they ran!
How come a congressman gets to have a funeral  with hundreds of people in a Church while American people are not allowed to worship in their Church?  #Biden #Trump2020LandslideVictory  #Biden2020Landslide
I would sleep better knowing that Biden Admin, House and Senate will investigate and prosecute where necessary and not be overtly "magnanimous" in trying to move forward. These people need to be publicly exposed. A "Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities" maybe?
Not at all… but they’re not *that* different, and Biden and people like him are personally and directly responsible for screwing things up to the point where someone as awful as trump could be elected.
Yeah ok, that’s why Biden is leading trump in the polls.
Lmao explain why you stated Biden was a racist
I know I don't have many followers and I am not twitter famous, but please respond with "yes" if you are going to vote for Joe Biden this November.  #biden #Biden2020 #DumpTrump2020 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #TrumpFailedAmerica
Joe Biden is basically a Republican tho. He isn't the solution. He may not be as evil or bad as Trump, but he's still bad.
Biden at least won the medal. Why the hell would anyone even believe that Harvey Weinstein would earn a presidential medal? I just don’t know how someone can be stupid enough to ever believe that as a possibility
No BIDEN ?  IS THIS HOW HE WILL RUN HIS PRESIDENCY BEHIND THE CURTAIN?
But Biden is better? Come on now Mario wake up
FACT CHECK:  Biden did not explicitly tie xenophobia to the travel restriction. His tweet reflects coronavirus remarks he made during a campaign stop in Iowa Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced.
FACT CHECK:  Biden tweeted: "We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump's record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency."
Chicken little speaking again, don’t worry you will lose to Biden
You may not personally like trump but can upu see biden taking on the chinese, iraq or Russia?  Get ready for taxes to skyrocket...... just know what you are voting for
Biden can’t help it.  He’s sick
Can we all admit that all the people who should run for president are too smart to run? There’s no way Biden or Trump should be president. We are so screwed

Some men create, some men destroy. Trump is a destroyer. Biden is a creater.
We saw how the October surprise strategy turned for access Hollywood and trump. At least on the scandal / ethics  front, joe Biden is in better shape than Hillary.
You would think if the trump team or the media or the ‘Russians’ have some dirt on biden roll out they would have by now to create that drumbeat unless they put all marbles on October surprise.
He’s too old and out of it? Hunter Biden hasn’t really caught on ? Biden has not shown up in the #JeffreyEpsteindidntkillhimself #GhislaineMaxwell stuff. The Bernie crowd doesn’t hate Biden like they did Clinton and her surrogates.
So kind of like Biden 😂😂😂
Biden could pick a flower for all I care I'll STILL VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO
That’s hilarious 😂 especially when Biden’s slogan is I chose “truth over facts”
Because that *is* the Democratic Party. It’s racist, sexist and homophobic. That’s why Biden is the candidate. So many better to pick from but we were told Dems wouldn’t vote for anyone other than a white man.  Huge disappointment in the party beginning in 2016.
That wasn't a eulogy. That was a desperate cry for help to elect Biden because they are all f*cked.
Biden's washed up and frankly stupid.
Actually neither. Who Biden picks as his VEEP isn't going to change my vote. Joe could pick his imaginary friend from his early childhood as VEEP, I'd still vote for him. 🇺🇸💙🌊
Maybe when Biden gets in office our country will have the political will to try at least?
No President has been comparable to a fascist dictator...until today's attempt to postpone an election (was not even done in Civil War...)  #No.  Reality gives you a binary choice:  Biden &amp; Democracy or Trump &amp; Authoritarianism.  Sadly, it is this black-and-white
Trump can’t fuck off too but I would rather have Trump over Biden 10x over
It could, we will see that would mean Biden would have to win. With his voting record he doesn't have the backing the media is claiming.
And that fact that people think we only have Trump and Biden to choose from LUL
People really think Biden is better then Trump.
I heard you say that Biden's comments on the breakfast club got you upset. I am so happy to hear that. For a minute, I was wondering how could he say such things with out consequence.
Well he only got 7-8% of the black vote in 2016 and won. He has done more for blacks than Obama / Biden so he should get 15-20% of the black vote this time. If he does, he will win by a landslide
This is like the 14th time I've done this to  or   The time to complain about Biden is after change of occupant at 1600 Penn. Ave.  There are more people than just you making sacrifices to vote. #JohnLewis  Squeaker=#Fail - has to be a blowout. 🚫Selfish
Want to energize independents and conservatives in the United States then have Obama campaign for Biden! #Trump2020

Can we get None Trump supporting Republicans to just not cast a vote November 3rd if they won’t cast one for Biden? Who’s Lying?
Biden’s America...
Who the f knows? You and I know Biden should be toast but WTF!
That’s ok Biden will bring it back and better and Trump won’t be able to do a damn thing out of office but take his upside down Bible and his form of Christianity which is none and pry for the courts to not prosecute his Demonic sex offender ass! Who’s Lying?
For me we’re effed either way. Biden and trump are both terrible leaders.  I’m going trump because I can’t pay more taxes, support for law enforcement, and fighting against political correct bullshit, Which covers a lot of areas.    Biden is about to make a horrible Vp choice.
On first glance, and not looking properly, I wondered why Joe Biden was tweeting a picture of Elton John
Poor Trump supporters have nothing  to say but they wish President Biden does the same things as Trump.  Lol
Number one, what about the other 44% who aren't ready for schools to reopen, prob because they don't think its safe?   And how many of your 56% only want schools to open if they know it's safe?   Biden cares about our children, Trump does not. Trump only cares about the optics.
Biden is not competent. His running mate will be President. He certainly is not going to do anything more for people now that his dementia is worsening. It is sad how they are using the sick old man who has given so much of his life to this country.
WOW O.0 o.0 O.o so many reasons for impeachment. Our system, more than just Congress, is now broken. Needs repair. Needs not-Trump. Needs Biden.
People prodding Congressman to back Biden are asking to load an atomic bomb on the White House.
I would crawl through a river of shit like Andy Dufresne to vote for Mark Kelly &amp; Joe Biden even if the polls showed them ahead 99% to 1%.  They all need to be humiliated.  Not just defeated.
It was perfect... in every way. And a reminder of just how much is at stake on November 3. We can choose Trumps America, that is filled with cruelty, racism, hate and division, or an Obama/Lewis/Biden America, that is filled with love, unity, equality and hope.
If Biden gets elected the barrier comes down and free everything for illegal immigrants.

No. Because a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for trump.
#Biden says he will be selecting a female VP, a move many assumed was pandering to the ladyfolk. But it's actually a brilliant move, according to top analysts, since the move will save taxpayers almost 30% on the VPs salary.  #BidenLandslide2020 #Trump2020LandslideVictory

The problem of Don is far greater ... hugely far greater ... then the Biden VP pic... If the VP pic moves the needle with respect to their vote...  I’m shaming you NOW!👇👇👇 Don must be removed regardless!
Intel Dems press Nunes for details on anti-Biden package from Ukrainian official  via
He is under Ukranian criminal indictment right now. Also can you explain to me why the push for racial equality would pick a man like biden who authored the 1994 crime bill?
Not on my wish list, but she is definitely qualified and I will vote Biden, whomever he picks.
Democrats know he's a turd so their new campaign is they hate Trump so much they'll "Settle for Biden."
LMAO don't want to talk about any of the criminal issues Obama had? How about Biden getting his son out of trouble not once but twice in Ukraine? Why is Biden under Criminal indictment for the same things you all impeached trump for? I'm curious why the hypocrisy?
Yeah Jonathan or whatever your name is please make sure to apologize to the future president joe Biden for your nonsense.
Not all during any other administration LMAO Like when Obama/Biden paid Iran after they had bounties on American troops? Fast and Furious where the Obama admin was giving guns to drug cartels....shall we continue. Every president has had their shit.
I'll throw in Seminole County. It hasn't gone for a democratic president since Truman in 1948 and Biden will likely need to win it by a few points.
Now do Joe Biden
Karen, Biden would have stoped it, right??
Seems over a decade too late to me. How sincere can he actually be. Would he call for this if Biden won the election?
Without, because my main assumption is that Buttigieg wouldn't have dropped out if Biden or Sanders weren't there, and therefore nobody else would probably want to drop out.
Calling out to the great state of Texas: we ask you to vote for Joe Biden this November to kick trump out. 💙🌊
Joe Biden warns that Donald Trump may try to delay November election | Joe Biden | The Guardian
Biden also supports closing down charter schools and doing away with school choice programs. He is a tool of the Teacher’s Union.  I hope that makes every inner city mom happy to see their children held captive in the under performing public school system.
I think she would do nicely ? Although I hope Biden has chilled his frat boy ways cause she I do not think put up with it.

Biden/Harris ticket is a winner for sure!!! Excited to cast my vote. I will stand in line, in a bikini, for 7 days in 10 feet of snow if needs be to return unity and civility to our country.
That fake Southern preacher vocal... That huge crowd of attendees... That free televised speech for all to see... That mail-in ballot voter suppression pitch... That former president Barry stumping for Basement Biden...  oh wait, this is a eulogy at a funeral... my mistake.
Fun fact: if an election isn't held by January 2021, Constitutionally speaking, both his and Pence's terms are up and the presidency falls to a Dem (i.e. Pelosi or, if she loses, Pat Leahy in the Senate). So effectively, if he does it, he screws up worse than just losing to Biden
Typical biden rally numbers, I'd say.  😂
I agree.Personally I want Elizabeth Warren as VP but to be honest, at this point I’m voting for a rock over trump.Also, I will vote for Biden/Harris.But I also know, they are just stop gap for the next four years.I know they won’t get re-elected but getting trump out is the goal
I not having a President for the last 4 years but that will all change on November 3rd when we will elect President Joe Biden.
Given how soft spoken and easy going Biden is I personally think Harris would be a great match for him.  Because he has one heck of a mess to clean up and will need a courageous woman in there. But I’m voting Biden even if he runs with Brittany Spears.
#cnn #morningjoe #Biden I just miss the legendary President Obama so much!! I truly love the man, love his intelligence and statesmanship etc etc etc ,,the nation now more then ever begs for a true leader
You are a huge Biden supporter I can tell.
Hope the Biden campaign will snap her up
I know, it really makes me nervous.  Poor "President Biden" will have one hell of a mess to clean up but I have faith he and the true experts he'll fill his cabinet with will make a really good run at it!
Lets face it, the next six months will be hell on earth until Biden is sworn in.  trump and the  will do everything in their power to totally and thoroughly screw this country out of pure retribution!
All of u libs are banking on Biden?? That tells me everything I need to know. I will not be able to stop laughing on November 4 when Trump wins his second term
Foolish is the mediocre mind. The more you speak you explain why Biden is the choice.

So Trump has accomplished more in most 24 hour period than Biden in 47 years lol thanks for making my point
Biden leading by like 2 in Arizona (I'm from there) is believable.  Arizona is gonna decide the election if you ask me.
Man imagine this guy running instead of Biden... 😔
No bet. He's a target rich opportunity for Biden. Yet Biden is doing well by watching and letting Mr. Trump do his thing  One stupid attack after another.
Yet it doesn’t even faze you that China has done more hacking recently than any other country. Or is it that you can’t say that because Biden is tied to China just as deep as Trump to Russia and this would hurt the Dems chances in Nov?
#WeWillVote Joe Biden! Vote Blue no matter who!!
I wish. You really think Biden will win the popularity contest? HAHAHA Bernie my boy you should be pissed.  Robbed twice in a row.
YES. Never knew Biden was the second coming until or after listening to my FAKE ERRONEOUS responses!
Joe Biden himself is a huge part of the problem, let’s not forget. The dude is a fucking square, that airhead nigga don’t care about any of us any more than Trump does and I truly believe that
They always talk out of both sides of their mouths. They are critical because they say Biden is hiding and not talking and not the are saying he is talking. Which is it because it cannot be both.
Let’s elect Biden first - everyone needs to vote. Then let the Secret Service decide how to remove him.
I will vote in November - by mail (as usual) or in person if necessary - for Joe Biden. #WeWillVote
Yes.  I hope you’ll be Biden’s VP pick.
I think we should it on Election Day. Those Biden commercials causing nausea.
On March 3, 2020, after Xi Jinping was named President for life, Trump said "maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day."     On April 24, 2020, Biden said " “Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow"  Today is someday.
The war of words will get going as we get closer to November 3rd   Good. Trump's alligator mouth is Biden's best supporter.
Biden doesn't even know what time it is. Dude has dementia and you're complaining about Trump? That's rich.
The Constitution sets the election date - not the President.
Of course you want to delay the election; you are polling as one one of the worst Presidents. Biden is taking states that have voted red for decades. You are going to be trounced. Worse then Carter in 1980 and Ducakus in 1988. America wants to savor your embarrassment.
The virus is doing a better job running against him than Biden is....
Republican,voting for Biden, AZ
Biden will get a VOTE PARADE
Oh yeah well if Biden is so great why didn’t he give Obama any advise while he was Vice President. Go put your mask back on and shut up😷🤐
Let me guess if Biden wins the election the COVID pandemic will suddenly disappear, teachers will have no problem going back to teaching, the riots will suddenly end, and this drug will suddenly be approved for use. Tell me again how this isn’t political?
ridiculous rape enabling. educate yourself about biden’s decades of lies.
Enable rape much?

No, Trump doesn't need foreign helps, but he knows Biden and his son were corrupt and that's the reason that American government needs to find out.

Biden is -150 to -170. According to Twitter he should be -1550. Shows you the reality compared to Twitter. If I see Biden at -130 I'm going big
What we do have to worry about, is if trump loses, all the damage he can do before Joe Biden's inauguration.
Fuck no I didn't want him on the ticket! I was a #mamaforkamala before I was in it for #warren. Guess who both of them support? Joe Biden
I can’t wait until  is UNLEASHED in this campaign!  I wanted her to be POTUS, I want her to be Biden’s VP, and I want her to become POTUS after Biden.
I never said he wasn't disgusting for this exact reason 🤣 just because I claim Biden is a pedo POS doesn't mean I'm pro-Trump. These are the times we live in. Get a grip 😚
Dear Sexists: Biden promsided he’d pick “a woman” as his running mate. And while that statement is problematic in its own right, he is going to follow through. “Ugh, but not THAT woman” is NOT a good response, and won’t make him pick a man instead. Fuck all the way off.
Only 3 of my friends have declared for DJT and 2 "friends" like Biden... I already removed the idiot from Australia who thinks because he's in media that he knows the truth about Trump.
They're probably going to have a lot of influence in a Biden administration, at the very least. I'd be amazed if we didn't see a few cabinet-level positions go to people who are aligned with Lincoln Project.
it begins to look like Biden may not be the only one with dementia...she seems to really be slipping
Ask pedophile biden and Killary, their Pedowoods friends know too!
Biden ain't wrong.

so great, live in a trump zone, no signs for either, did not put up a biden one as it would be stolen and a waste
And trump does anything the right wing racists want. Trump is the divider in Chief not Biden, yet.
Biden isn’t the nominee yet and the man has a simple choice - back #MedicareForAll or lose the votes of people who are demanding that we the most wealthy and powerful nation in history catch up to where almost all other developed countries were *decades* ago.
How bout Biden logo nose clips?
I think more democrats vote for Trump,  then Republicans vote for Biden
Probably getting Biden over the finish line.  I don't have faith that any criminal charge will be brought, except maybe  some lower level players.  Looks like there is no justice in the Justice Dept., swamp running the FBI, Deep State at CIA and State Dept.
Conversation today with a republican- all dems want to defund the police. Bear in mind this was a unemotional conversation. But in the end, he would not acknowledge the fact Biden does NOT want to defund the police. It’s nuts.
Found him a running mate. Biden/Cosby 2020
How is Joe Biden fucking up what is possibly the most softball election he could of asked for?
Uh huh...name one thing Beijing Biden has done that’s been good for our country in 47 years in politics?
If Biden wins, WE ARE ALL FUCKED js
Can we all collectively agree to learn this and set a time to do this once we’ve locked in a Biden win and thrown Trump and his cronies to the curb?
Something else to point out is the fact that Iran has always had bounties on US troops, and Obama/Biden gave them how much money? They had their top general on the ground in Iraq planning attacks. Give me a break here with the spin.
Trump already ended those jobs with his world wide recession. Remember just a while ago when oil prices crashed? Remember? That was your lot. Best way to help the oil industry is to elect Joe Biden.

Did I hear correctly?  If Biden is elected he wants money to assist blacks, latinos, aisans and native Americans.  Isn't that what you would call RACIST, when you exclude a specific group based on their race, gender or sexual orientation😳
Also, Joe Biden is unable to do either now also. Not a better choice.
That’s not a bad thing. Biden is aging.
If he is so weak, why you trying to tear him down with your rhetoric. Sounds like Biden again to me.

Don’t worry Biden will untuck all that Trump is fucking up!
Oh look - a female candidate being deemed "too ambitious."  - the sexism is right on time
I guarantee it, watch if Biden wins all these people are going to sit back down and start raising up their RBG Flags. Anyone who was gullible enough to fall for this bullsh*t is either politically naive or is prone to cult like feel good rhetoric making them dangerous individuals
If Biden wins this ADOS/FBA shit is gonna be a thing of past. Black Americans getting scammed by people who move with the political tides that white people in this country set into action. There is no FBA/ADOS without a far right wing President being in office.
Biden's biggest concern is loyalty and ushering in the new Democratic party, which he named Buttigieg in, under his beliefs.   Biden only wants loyalty and tokenism. This is how the first female president will potentially be chosen and it's disgusting.
Wow, what an incredibly dumb thing to say. We actually had a really good chance when Biden was VP. We recovered from a huge recession that happened during an irresponsible president’s term. Time to do it again. #Biden2020 #DumpTrump
CNN polled me two weeks ago. I never knew Biden was so brilliant, mature, wise.

DNC Blocks Medicare4All In Platform &amp; Bernie Does Nothing! People have lost their jobs and healthcare at the same time, are leaving the hospital with millions in debt, but corporate-bought Biden is still against M4A.
Biden just wants to ride that Camel cause he’s heard the rumors 😝
You talking about Biden I thought he finished second to last?
There are three things that are certain in life. Death, taxes and Joe Biden is not debating Donald Trump.
Biden wants the first potential woman president on 2 conditions (1) loyalty to him and his causes and (2) what may help him get votes.   That's it. Not who they are. Not what they stand for.   Absolutely fucking disgusting.
Ya that was all stupid - never jump to conclusions. That’s why I was waiting to pronounce judgement. It literally could have been anyone. But there was a line in time when he went from a volunteer to - hating Biden, slugocki, rottelini, and thinking Ivanka was his wife
Ya... but he clearly went over to the deranged side with Ivanka as his wife and trump love and Biden hate some time back.
Biden is a puppet for the Democrat leftists.
Biden will be soft on rioters and soft on policing.
Biden could give a 2 hour press conference where he slurs all his words, shits his pants and then lays down to take a nap on stage and I would still vote for him over Trump. That’s where we are. No amount of pointing out his cognitive decline will matter.
That’s how bad your dad is. I would vote for Biden in a coma before I would vote for your dad.
Please... everyone stop calling Biden progressive....
Maybe you’ll realize that the railroad owns the bridge and has nothing to do with Biden or Trump.

I think they stick with Biden and it will basically come down to Trump vs. Biden’s VP.  Biden is and always has been a horrible presidential candidate.
Nobody huh? 80 million will vote to re-elect him. How many you think Beijing Biden the racist senator from 1960-2000’s will get demolition rat?

Who is Joe Biden? Isn’t he that racist senator from the 60’s 70’s 80’s 90’s and 2000’s?
I'm looking forward to Biden undoing everything from your disgraceful time squatting in the Oval.
These are all closer to what I'd expect the actual results to be than the wider spread polls that others have. I don't believe the Michigan Biden+10 type numbers.
Yep because Joe Biden doesn’t even know he’s Joe Biden. Dementia is going into Alzheimer’s.
What’s Biden going to do about China’s decision making
I would rather a president who doesn’t know his intentions than one who does and those intentions are evil. No brainer! The reality is, Dems aren’t greedy mother fuckers that look the other way for personal gain. I know that if Biden is incompetent in his roll as POTUS,
This is what Biden's courageous Americans do to real Americans.
Nope, super humble and blessed.  Hard work creates the American dream.  No need to feel sorry.  Not ruffled, I find this quite fun.  It's important.  Biden will most likely lose, because he is not capable... If he does, are you going to be upset for 4 more years?
Something is wrong with Biden and we deserve to know!!!
That’s stupid trump ad that propaganda nonsense of defunding the police, that if you elect Biden, there will be no police only runs in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina.
Biden grosses me out, but at least he’s not BFF’s with a known child sex trafficker and doesn’t call other known child sex traffickers as “very good people”. He also been accused of sexual misconduct 8 times in comparison to the 25 times that trump has.  You really need to find
Well sorry, Bernie.  You would have my vote but the DNC has assured victory for Trump in the coming election.  Biden, compared to Trump, is unfit for duty mentally, which is just pathetic.  They must not have learned with Hillary, OR they actually want to sabotage the election.
This makes my stomach hurt. A man with so much “cool” his slobbering fans dismiss his bigoted views on Israel. May we never see the days of his disdain for Israel again.  Wish Biden had a spine.
I don’t like Biden at all but if it comes down to him or Trump, it’s a no brainer! I’d rather have an inept president with good intentions than an inept president with evil ones.
"Nobody Likes Me": Trump On US Health Expert Fauci's High Approval Rating - NDTV   My opinion to that?  Stuff Biden back in the closet.    Trump is ok.
You realize trump isn't the only one with power in government to fix prevailing as she is in the system these politicians have been in office for decades but blame someone who's only spent 3 years In politics  Joe Biden is a documented racist but go off...
Omg that is funny Biden is a loser
Biden is as far left as you are a Patriot.  It doesn't fit.
We try to chose the less evil, for me that is Trump.  Trump has been investigated to the hilt. Biden on the other hand has not. Which is a concern. Like many has said, of all that ran, Biden was more likable, but he’s not the real problem, who will he chose as VP?
I would trade Joe Biden “turmoil”for Trump turmoil every day of the week and twice on Sundays.
Opinion | Now we know why Trump sought foreign help to beat Biden
Literally change anything, Biden.
Joe Biden said Tuesday that he'll name his running mate next week. Several women are on his shortlist, including Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois.  via
I have zero worries about #WarrenDemocrats backing Biden. I do worry that some Bernie supporters may still vote 3rd party.
So tell me again what Biden had done for this country and our tax paying citizens? Go on... I'll wait for your response...
He’s getting senile like Biden is.
Just wait. It's coming out.. More stuff about Obama, Biden, Hillary. Also if you look at the logic side of it, it shouldn't be Trump discovering it but an unbiased person or persons. Do your hard research, not just watch Fake News CNN who wants people to life in fear! #Trump2020
Joe Biden confirms his only criteria for selecting a Vice Presidential Running Mate.
Don’t worry. Joe Biden will fix it

Trump has never had a plan for anything. If you remember in 2016 his only agenda was build a wall, gut ACA, and degrade other people. He could never talk policy the way Biden is doing.
Can you imagine if Trump only did press conferences with pre selected questions. Yet that’s the only thing Biden does and not a peep from MSM
Joe Biden checklist for November: 1. Visit Wisconsin a couple times in the next few months. 2. Don’t say I’m reclaiming my time at debates (if there are any). 3. Don’t have emails show up on Carlos Danger’s laptop. 4. And remember it is #personwomanmancameratv
Gas-lighters for Biden
Hey Biden, brave Federal officers have been facing that at the Court House in Portland every night for 2 months. They have been shot, beaten, stabbed, and burned while the violent rioters doing this are egged on by you and the Democratic Party, not to mention the fake news press.
There are 3 that are scheduled.  My concern is that we can't have CNN, MSNBC, and other leftest be there asking questions and then supporting Biden like they did the last election with Killary.
I don't think Nadless Nadler thinks at all, he just reads what's put in front of him. He's Biden lite.
Biden is the synthesis of Obama and Trump
If neither Bernie or Biden ran, I bet Buttigieg would’ve won
When I heard that I was applauding because this needs to be taken seriously.  Obama, Biden, and all of them that unmasked and attempted the fail coup need to be held accountable!
I was LMAO watching this and can't wait until President Trump debates nut case Biden and kicks his a$$!
Too bad that pill wasn’t introduced to Pelosi and Biden’s mothers. #trump2020
Ingraham: Joe Biden's fantasy COVID fix  來自
Yes, and that is what we will have everywhere if Biden is elected. 3rd World country here we come.
You still alive Mr. BIDEN? Dont tell me Michelle Obama is the one you pick for vice president...Because i DON'T VOTE then for you.....😱😱🥺🤔🤔👽
So the threat is, riots end if we vote for Biden? Is that what you’re saying? I want to be sure I understand how the threat is being leveled.
Biden and his cronies suck.
Great.  Dems and Biden get to experience their "Defunding" first hand.
Trump will be voted out soon so no need to start impeachment on Barr at this point. Once Trump gone, Biden will remove Barr!
Biden and his media/cronies are Bad for US.  Don't believe a word anyone of them says - it's all misinformation, construed facts or just fiction.
If Biden gets elected and Beto does what he says he will you think we’ve had violence recently just see what happens when law abiding gun owners like me become criminals #frommycolddeadfingers
Joe Biden May have the same problems it’s the health of our economy
Or maybe Biden can slide on that public appearance because the "police" won't work.
Is Nadler on the same meds as Biden, or do all #DemocRats live in La La Land?
Ugh. As a fan of Warren’s, this nonsense pisses me off. I’m excited to vote for Biden, whoever his VP pick is!
81 Facebook friends have like Trumps page, 2 For Biden!   In Washington State!!!
I’m writing her name on the ticket since joe Biden has dementia
Biden's secret service nickname is "Redshirt."
Everything you just said is wrong.  Stop being part of the problem.  Biden needs to pick the best/most qualified person for the position.  Haven’t you learned anything from trumps failures?
Cage match! #trump vs #biden  I want it on Television these guys need to debate! #SleepyJoe  will get a folding chair in his back! #Trump2020Landslide
Alls I know is at this point everyone needs to be stuffing money in Joe Biden’s pants like thier life depends on it. Because IT DOES.
Remember when Biden came out of his basement and finally answered some softball questions and still fucked it up?
Biden is a train wreck..
Senator Mark Kelly we have your back just like President Biden and we’re taking you both all the way to the WH.
YES, PLEASE... we can't afford to sit this one out. BITE YOUR TONGUE &amp; VOTE BIDEN/WHOEVER2020
When Biden announces his running mate next week, I'm not saying boo even if I disagree with who it is. Trump is banking on that discord, and I refuse to give it him.   After the election, though? Expect me to be unhinged.
I already indicated a NO on Rice. I remember seeing tons of news on Benghazi from GOP perspective 🤦🏼‍♀️ they would definitely go after her. Sides, she has no experience governing. The Woke is a problem and unless Biden opposes, it’s a win for CJ. Schools can open safely if have 💵
Educated but still using the wrong “their” lol let’s just say we’re voting against Biden on policies. IDC if trump ran or not I’d vote against Biden for his beliefs and policies...
Disagree.  I guess you didn't see his press conference earlier today.  Biden doesn't need a script or notes and can speak extemporaneously, unlike Trump.   You are projecting exactly what the GOP does but that's nothing new.
Thousand Mile glazed-eyed gaze. Basement Biden is clearly being medicated to assist him in trying to get through these highly controlled, orchestrated,  faux press conferences. His handlers freaking the eff out when Bumbling Biden goes off script.
Waiting for Biden to use yangs policies
you started this divisiveness in our Great Country under  administration. Our Great President  inherited nothing but garbage. #BLM started under your watch. Suck it up Joe, admit your faults.
With Biden, "Nothing will fundamentally change" and America will keep swirling the drain continuing the legacies of recent past presidents.  So feckless legislators, no single payer, no end to fracking, no marijuana legalization, etc..  #RejectTheDuopoly
Biden 94 crime bill look it up  He doesn't care about anything supposedly systemically racist he only pretends like he does he is the reason police have become more violent and why more  Minorities are incarcerated but no one is ready have that talk
I’m sick of Trump Enabler Barr’s Lies and Criminality. I’m watching Biden speak right now on CNN. Tune in.
Biden 94 crime bill look it up
For the record I wouldn’t care if Joe Biden was caught snorting coke off a dead pirate’s wooden leg in Motel 6, I’m still voting for him.
Out of no where corporate and private donations went to Black Lives Matter and those funds went to Act Blue which is a funding arm of Democrats. Before the protests, Trump was out raising Biden almost 2 to 1. Since the protests, the tables are turned not by direct donations
Not on the same level. I would never vote for Biden normally, now my first priority is voting trump out. Then we can work on progress.
Biden on Muslim support at the polls-
Biden reportedly called him to ask about his health before this.
I keep saying I'm tired of old, white men in power (and I'm old). This administration has got to be the last of its kind with Joe Biden just getting us back to normal.
Here's a running mate for Biden
These ads are dumb af.  Fuck the police  Fuck biden Fuck trump.
Preview of a possible Biden Presidency - who will be running the show?  Vote them out and vote Biden down!

understanding/staying current with others you don’t support/have similar beliefs in is paramount in growth as an individual and in your values.   i like all angles on my feed which is why i follow fox &amp; cnn/hillary, biden, trump, and jorgenson/pelosi &amp; mcconnell.
No. No. Not her.  She can't be VP. Biden has a fatal under-age touching match with a 12yr old, and next thing we know, she's running the country? God help us all.
biden is bread in a dishwasher. #replacebiden
No V.P. Biden, not YET but SOON!

But remember guys...the orange man is the enemy. Once Biden is in office everything is going cha....oh, wait...it’s the same damn shit only main stream media will tell you it’s roses
Healthy? Did they allow Biden to hire a stand-in?
Get him off. Gym Jordan makes no sense talking about Obama/Biden.
That advisor has the wrong take.  Biden should be doing what Obama did in 2008, a "50 state strategy".  Try and win every single state.  Campaign hard in every single state.  The difficulty of course being that things can't be in person right now.  But no state should be ignored.
The best video yet! Biden Blue🦾🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
If so they should be the 1st to be "cancel cultured" out of their jobs as the biden depression sets in and this term term circles the drain.
They never said the supported joe Biden
Seriously? He tried to ban travel from China in January.   The far left faught him on all his attempts to be proactive when this came out.  Pelosi, Biden and others took to the streets, Pelosi made a point to go to Chinatown in California and hug a bunch of people
Congratulations and I don’t know why you are supporting Biden . He is the father of mass incarceration
He is a wonderful loving Dog who thinks his Uncle is the best thing in Iowa at the moment, by the time I leave he will be Ride'n with Biden!
Proud of Trump??  Heck no. But we have eyes to see what the left is doing and trying to do to this great country and we know as of today Trump is the only alternative we have to stop the Marxist left that 100% will come after you too. Biden is just a puppet
We can expect lots of vitriol from those stalwarts of decency and morality in GOP regardless of who Joe Biden picks as his running mate. None-the-less here's a taste of what's in store for Susan Rice if chosen
Since you didn’t know Biden IS in fact a pedophile, watch this and maybe it’ll change your mind.
Dumpf needs a better photo op spot!  Distraction! American people are dying! American children are hungry! Americans are in pain and fear! America has no fit leader! Vote Blue and Biden
I'm right there with you.  Susan Rice never ran for election to anything.  Harris is the whole package.  Harris and Biden are magic together and she'd be first in line to run for POTUS with VP as another credential.
So the left thinks he has blown dementia. 🤯 but Biden is at full health!
You are really reaching &amp; trying to cover all races in your desperate lying tweets. “1977: Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into ‘a jungle… a racial jungle.’” Shame on you!
So I’ll vote for Biden. Happily? No. But pragmatically. Because the alternative is those secret police getting a trial run in PDX. Seriously.
There are no heroes in politics. There are tons of people I wish it were instead of Biden. But the only people we can count on to safe us are us. And first up has to be send the fascist packing. Eliminate that rot root and branch. And that necessitates political repudiation.
Yeah, some of my family won't vote for him if they don't like his VP choice. I keep telling them it won't matter, but they worry b/c Biden is old.
Biden. Yes, clear racist. Same as Trump. Obvs. Sarc-FO-asm. You can't breathe without feeling aggrieved. Get that looked out. Muted.
Idk yet. My dad will probably vote Trump b/c of judges and China. My mom probably won't vote for either. She hates Trump more than my dad does and doesn't mind Biden, but she's worried about him being controlled by the far left. I'm still working on both, though.
but you live in a world of demand it happen right now and I live in a world of reality. Have a tiny bit of patience because otherwise you're going to be permanently depressed. WTFU. And yes, I say this as a minority. Check out our reality and how many will vote for Biden.
I wish the DNC would of let you proceed to run against Trump. I’m a Trump supporter but believe you earned to run against Trump. So much experience and devotion. You try every time and I hope you get your chance in 2024. Biden is such a “character” and disappoint.
Biden has better looking celebs than trumps has-beens Woods and Voight.
as a survivor the idea of voting for biden is awful and as a student with a health conditions he’s not enough. he helped built systems that oppress us and won’t work to change things the way we need now. idk what to do. are you guys voting for him? feel free to dm me ur feelings
When Biden wins in November, he will end the divisive politics and restore peace to the nation.  Only a despot would attack the mainstream media and peaceful protestors in an effort to remain in office.
Biden won't close the charter schools, but I will
What on earth is wrong with 8 percent of Democrat voters?  "Only 6% of Republicans said they preferred Biden compared with 8% of Democrats who back Trump."   New Ohio poll shows Donald Trump with slight lead over Joe Biden
A friendly reminder that Joe Biden wasn’t anyone’s first choice, but he is the last stand between democracy and a fascist regime. No one gave a shit 4 years ago when it was Hillary, so please, you absolute dumb ass fucks, get out there and vote for Joe. Your life depends on it.
But what you are describing is everything that you have done. Word for Word. We want our house back. I’m voting for Mr. Joe Biden. We need a calm, honest, and rule following president that doesn’t tell us to drink bleach. I’ll bet he can master person, woman, man, camera, TV🐘🐘
My favourite are the ones saying "he wants to defund the cops". And, I show them the interview where they showed Trump he DIDN'T say that. Had a lady say "Biden likes young women", as if Trump wasn't chasing any woman NOT his wife.
Mr joe Biden is gonna give everyone free everything and abolish police and end racism and I’m certain that mf is gonna get rid of the coronavirus. Only reason he hasn’t yet is because he’s not the president what the hell trump?????
"That is an intelligent, accomplished, trustworthy guy. Joe Biden should be the President of The United States of America"  -said no one. ever. #Election2020 #Democrat #Republican
Your vastly over inflating the impact of debates. Trumps down by 9 on average. Let’s say each debate he absolutely crushes Biden and climbs 1.5 (likely way too high) points per debate. At the end he’s climber 4.5, and is still down 4.5. He still loses.
I shoot first then call 911. This doesn’t affect me. Joe Biden ain’t winning shit
Biden and Trump are both proving age doesn’t come wisdom.
Biden is literally racist and took part in Epstein’s whole thing and supported him. You’re delusional my friend
Trump 2020  Biden sucks
AZ is a lock for DJT.  NM went sissy long ago so they'll vote for Biden.  CO...that's difficult.  NV should be a lock for DJT but for Clark County.  MN goes Red...finally.
They decided to kneel at the altar of “at least he’s not Biden”.
Anyone who is too old for Biden to sexually harass.
How disgusting that visitors can't see the White House as we once could. *Sigh* That'll be one of Biden's first projects, to "free" the white house. I wish we could make #45 pay for it, but that'll never happen. Even if he said he would, he wouldn't.
Continually saying antifa isn’t a terror group doesn’t make it not one. We’re judging them by their actions. The threat right now sounds a lot like “vote for Biden or the riots continue”    Terrorist threat makes them terrorists.
Tribunals are death penalty starting with Opie and Biden
How's phone banking for Biden going? 🤣😂🤣😂
Beating Biden
haha of course! We all called it! We knew they are trying to protect biden from any debates.
Who cares if he stays in the bunker. Let him. Trump can stay in the fucking bunker and rot there. President Biden can tell the world Trump is like a Crazy Uncle. #BunkerBoy
I think Biden should use the footage from Trump’s “This is Biden’s America” and say “This is LITERALLY Trump’s America”
Lifelong Republican but very disappointed in the Republican lack of understanding of the current situation. Voting Mark Kelley and Joe Biden for 2020!
Biden pays his respects to John Lewis at the Capitol
Sadly so true.  I swear Pelosi actively prefers trump to Hillary or Biden because she gets to easily fundraise off of him and be lauded for making sarcastic claps and other meaningless gestures while passing his agenda
I'm voting for Biden and getting the extended warranty too!  Lol
I let CBS know how I feel about this blatantly false ad against Biden.  Anyone else care to do the same?
My wife has 2 longtime Republican family members who are also leaning toward Biden #RepublicansForBiden
My wife and I are former Republicans who left after Trump was elected. We’re 100% behind Biden. My brother is a Republican who’s voting for Biden b/c he’s tired of Trump’s divisiveness. He voted for Trump in 2016. My parents voted for Trump but are undecided now.
American was great before you took office. Once Biden takes over, AMERICA WILL BE GREAT AGAIN!
Awe look Biden is still talking to dead people
Tlaib is the worst of the squad and her refusal to endorse Biden as the best hope of defeating Trump proves it.
I won’t be scared anymore. I’ll look up to the sky, smile and say, “It’s a great day.” President Biden will lead us to a new tomorrow.
He’s just Biden his time
What a joke the GOP has become!! Sad to say I have been a member! So disappointing in your wait and see what the polls look like. I’m voting Mark Kelley and Biden for 2020
When 9/10 “news outlets” spend 99/100 min telling viewers that Trump is the reason for all of their problems, I don’t have much hope that a quick mention of Biden family shady dealings will have too great of an effect. The man was best buds with Robert KKK Byrd for Gods sake.
Go tell it to the moderate Republicans Biden's counting on. You've already turned your back on #NotMeUs, cheerfully calling us every name in the book if it gave you an ounce of clout with your corporate-dem paymasters.
The people with conscience wouldn't vote for Biden or any of the mainstream parties. But it's all good with a voting record like Biden's I'm surprised he's still running. Especially since he was one of the creators of "systemic racism" as the media points. Look at Portland.
It's not gonna happen. Biden really wants to hide out and hope Trump just loses. He would be demolished if he actually had to be by himself and debate.
If elected I hope Joe Biden's opening at his inauguration is, "Our long national nightmare is over."
Listen to Bill O'Reilly to see the differences between Biden and Trump.  Very scary! Our wonderful country will be gone if Biden wins. No!  Presidential+Election+Kickoff%3A+Where+Trump+and+Biden+Stand+Now%3B+Violent+Protests+Grip+the+Nation
Vote Joe Biden.
Yeah and you agree Trump is racist, and you support him so you're racist lol. I don't support Biden
We are all hoping for Biden/Harris 2020. Return America to Greatness.  #TeamJoe
They say a picture is worth a thousand words. I could also look up a photo of biden with the grand wizard of the KKK, but I'll leave that up to the readers. Decided to look it up for the left, as most can't even spell their own names.
Which he never said. Just like the Charlotte comment about good people in both sides  Never said it. Biden has deteriorated dramatically in past couple months. He’s never going to debate Trump. 5min and he’s done
He can't make a simple announcement or discuss anything without it being written down for him.  He tries to make it conversational but it's obvious he's reading notes--poorly.  Yeah, I don't see how he can compete with Biden with 30+years gov't experience.
That’s all you’ve got to prove Biden is racist? Have you checked  with “your “ black?
Joe Biden saying goodbye to his dear friend Louis Armstrong (it’s a joke because Biden can’t remember anything)
But not ONLY those two things are factors, which cannot and should not be ignored. And Biden never said a minority, just a woman.
Not sure about Trump as for following Biden it will never show you more than 997 followers.
Thanks I'm not. Biden isn't racist. You believe whatever you want but saying so is speaking sh*t.
Fir comment. And it's your last line that convinces me you come from a good place. Because Biden clearly is not racist and I'm tired of ppl pretending he is for their own purposes.
The Real Reason Biden Is Ahead of Trump? He’s a Man  This is sad!  Will misogyny ever go away?
If Biden wins: “the American people have spoken! The Democrats have one fair and square. Socialist agenda...  If Trump wins: “Racist Trump has stolen the election through collusion with Russia, China, voter fraud and deceit. Lawsuits...”
Better than the young boys Biden abuses now.
Disgusting Vote Biden
Dump dumpf! He is NOT making America great!  As he deminishes any American he deminishes all.  Vote Biden Blue
At this rate of incompetence I won’t be surprised if Biden comes within a hair of 400 electoral votes

Biden is both an imbecile and obviously just trying to pander for a vote
Most on the right are beginning to feel like 2020 will be an extinction event. We’d prob be better off splitting up the country soon and let people vote w feet. If we are hearing you, all the riots stop if we vote for Biden, correct? That’s the threat you’re promoting?
In 40 years in government Biden couldn’t do it and you think he can now? Is this a joke?
Gross. I don’t wanna see Biden tapping any ass, but especially not that one.
I thought this was hogwash. The first half was great because Trump is an ass. But Joe Biden—first of all—why is he not in this? Anyways he says what he’s gonna do. How is he gonna do it? What’s the plan?? I mean, I’m still voting for him but this is nothing but politics BS.
You do realize that Trump is president right now, right? Not Biden
If only there was some reason to believe that Biden would put an end to that...
Hell no, I don't care...my question is, WHY?  Does she really think she's going to be in the White House long enough to enjoy it?  Of course, she does....LET'S PROVE HER WRONG!! VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN!!!
Lyin’ hidin’ senile, dementia riddled biden!
Who is "we"? Are you are with the Biden campaign?
She was placed there by the shithead Republicans in my state of Arizona. We have other plans this November. Arizona will help elect Joe Biden and Mark Kelly will replace the Trump lickspittle McSally.
I hope Trump knocks Biden off his status.  The ass is past his use.
I'm in Tempe and was phone banking for Mark Kelly and Biden this weekend.  One man didn't know Biden was the nominee (???)  and just said- I'm voting for the Democrat, whoever that is. I also got one- fuck yes,  I can't wait to vote trump out!
Funny. When I see Biden supporters, I don't see them degrading people and telling them to go back to their countries. Only Trump supporters are hate filled losers. Why did Wal-Mart even let those fuckbags in?
Question of the day for Tim, when/where has Biden EVER supported defunding the police or raising taxes on middle class.And he's been promoting pedophilia ever since, imo.
OK..wait .... Nadler yesterday and Biden today?  Something smells here.
I’m not a Joe Biden supporter, but I feel sorry for him.  His walk, look, and speech reminds me so much of my dad in about 2010 it is very disconcerting.  Why his wife, family, and party would expose him to the American public in his condition is just in poor taste. 1 of 2

Kamala Harris is reportedly losing favorite status in the tumultuous Biden veepstakes. Here's why.
Oh, you were on a remote island 2009-2016 where more jobs were created and we got out of a GREAT recession.  Unemployment great reduction, more jobs under Obama/Biden than Trump.  Show the stats.  If we only had a leader during this pandemic!
And in other news, “BREAKING: Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump made between $36,151,214 - $157,020,085 in 2019, according to an analysis of their financial disclosures by CREW.”  Economic equity needs to be toward the top of priorities in the new Biden administration.
If Biden is Elected, he will order the Destruction of the Border Wall
Because its virtue signaling and is not going to change anything regardless what you or anubidy else thinks. If you want actual change demand more from your party and your party leaders and Joe Biden aint it.
I would disagree on Biden not giving a fuck. Americans are hurting right now and need someone w empathy and leadership. Biden provides both
The media needs to quit focusing on Trump at all and his fascist ways and only report on Joe Biden and what he's doing. I hardly ever hear about him all day in the news
You are full of crap just go and lay down Obama is a child molester with the Clinton's stupid Hilary and Obama sold the country to Iran Biden is a human trafficking all Democrats are eval and criminal why you don't say that instead of lies about the President
Is this indicative of a split in the selection committee, or that Biden hasn't actually made a choice and Kamala is one of the last contenders for the position? There seems like an awful lot of bickering from Dodd and Rendell on this matter publicly to be of no consequence.

NOT EVEN BIDEN IS STUPID ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS MISTAKE. CNN:Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
Obviously, I'd be thrilled if Warren were chosen as VP. But, there is still an upshot if she takes another position in Biden's cabinet. Wouldn't she make an awesome AG? Someone who would go after corporate malfeasance *and* advance CJ reform? I see her doing well with that.
Well Obama/Biden gave him a manual and he threw it away. 🤷‍♀️
You have one more now.   I don't think her distance from Trump is cowardly, I think it's classy. She's always been a class act. I don't know exactly what you mean by advocating "human infrastructure." I do know that Biden would be well served heading to the middle, not the left.
There is no alternative. We're basically held with a gun to our heads. They know Trump needs to ne removed so they don't really have to do anything. AOC already said she's supporting the Democratic nominee yet Biden still hasn't reached out to her.
Polls show Biden’s lead over Trump has doubled in one week!
Thanks, "Biden believes everyone should have the right to a safe roof over their head." I guess the best we can do is wait and see.
"They are managing to turn a positive milestone into evidence of deep misogyny - unless Biden picks Kamala."  Perhaps, that's the point.
funny they stopped short of Endorsing Biden..that was the tell the are just doing a public CYA
No, say it ain't so.
I *think* he's talking about a scenario where the election is held but Trump contests the results and somehow delays Biden's inauguration.
Biden's running running mate for money and views. Major coverage from all the outlets ignore  And no white man or anyone with a large enough microphone has "discovered" Mark Charles/Sedinam Moyowasifza-Curry! A black V.P. , chosen and not by the DNC! #AllThePeople
This is CNN playing Knowledgeable ... Re-read what they actually say ... i.e., "His comments on Tuesday did not indicate when Biden will publicly announce his selection. But it is all but certain ..."
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
THE CHOICES ARE CLEAR. A VOTE FOR BIDEN IS A VOTE FOR #CCP AGGRESSION AND TYRANNY.
Biden may choose Karen Bass to make sure he has a pure communist in the WH.
WHAT A SWEET PIC SENT FROM MY RNC COLLEAGUE SOLOMON YUE OF JOE BIDEN AND HIS DADDY.

Give me fall, baby! Let's win this thing and the rest will follow. Biden isn't a newbie here. He will put together a highly skilled and competent administration. But unless he's elected, nothing else matters, does it?
He needs to do same in AZ. I see way too many Trump ads, &amp; very few of Biden’s
I hope Biden chooses Kamala Harris as his Vice President.

So it seems like it is possible, not likely but possible, for Biden to get over 400 electoral votes and the Democratic Party to have 60 seats in the senate. I will do my part. How about you?

Joe Biden is right. The pandemic has shown that the entire 'Trump economy' was built on sand. The economic pain, fear and loss we are all feeling (and the worst GDP drop in history) is a direct result of  failures.

A thought on our previous discussion.  I think a Biden administration can be most transformational  with a single initiative: establishing a cabinet level post (or CBO-like body) charged with vetting all legislation/policies for racial impact.  Your thoughts?
Neither. They know they’re going to lose and are re-establishing their situational hatred of government spending and debt, so they can undermine everything Biden tries to do. They don’t care about America.

He has no accomplishments or plans to run on, and virtually no negative material on Biden. No messaging strategy can polish this turd.

Chris Dodd you are doing VP Biden a great disfavor with your advice. As a Western Democrat I see Kamala Harris as someone that will best assist the election of Biden she adds intelligence and fire and will let you win the West. No eastern liberals please.
There is no other way of saying it.  He will do anything to win The GOP will use the chaos resulting from mail in ballots  The only way to avoid this is Biden winning in a landslide in many states for this to work.
Yang was great. I lost faith in him when he dropped out and supported Biden in exchange for a position in the cabinet. It said he is too willing to flip his positions
There is a step when states send ‘certified’ electoral results to Congress.Even if there are 2 delegations,Nancy can accept Biden electors if they won the state.Trump can sue in the courts while Biden wins. Trump can’t cheat to a win so he wants to cancel. #reversethedystopia
This same dialogue is being spread and I've seen it over and over. I'm not voting Biden so if they felt like stopping Trump was so important, dems should have put in a candidate that people would vote for.
For example: I've been voting Green party for almost 18 years, now, but I just cant let Trump win. I'm biting the bullet and switching my vote  from Green to Biden. We cant let have Trump have 4 more years!

I'm not trying to defeat trump. Biden will do fine on his own. The point is to create a new party and we only need 5% for that
But a side project of that strategy is starting the green party. We can do both at once, as well as vote Biden into office because the Green party only needs 5%. Biden should be fine without 5%. Trump literally called the army on his people.
Didn’t the Supreme Court condemn ‘faithless electors’ to prevent this circumstance. What is to stop Nancy from certifying electors from party who won the state?Win 4 Biden. Trump loses.I think Trump’s guys considered this&amp;decided to postpone elections. #reversethedystopia
Trump can call on states w GOP majorities in 2 Houses &amp; GOP Governors to place Trump electors in states where Trump lost. However, New England plus states w Dem Governors get enough electors 4 Biden win.   Bottom line: Trump cancels election or loses power. #reversethedystopia
All I'm saying is I'll vote with my conscious. Which is for Howie, not Biden

What a beautiful lovely wife Michelle Obama and a handsome Barack Obama. I’m Dr Jon Kent Shallop PhD from Tucson Arizona USA 🇺🇸🦋amen and I have voted Blue for Joe Biden for President and Senator Angela Harris for Vice President. Amen
We all have our favorite for VP. Fine, but who has to work with that person for the next 4-8 years?  Not you or me.  Joe Biden has to work with them, and I don't know about you, but I want our new president to be as strong as possible.   How hard is it to work with someone...  1/

Biden had 8 yrs to do ANYTHING, he didn't, with the exception of lining his kid's pocket in Ukraine/China.  But Dem voters don't care, their envy and hatred for 'the haves' is a proxy to grab power and they'll never give it up. Not one promise kept.   #WEAREATWARWITHDEMOCRATS

Lies! The Democrats showed their colors yesterday during the Barr hearing. What a disgrace of a bunch of people! I have never seen so much disrespect in my life! And now you know why all they have to offer for president is Biden! Shame on you guys!
The Democrats showed their true colors during the Barr hearing. What a pathetic, disrespectful bunch of cry babies. What a disgrace they are. They totally embarrassed the entire party! No wonder all they have to offer for president is Biden !!!
I don’t think he would nor will vote Biden. I just don’t think he will. He may be wrong on this stuff, but honestly I see him voting third party or write in. He isn’t a person (seemingly) that is down with abortion. He has his fight and he is sticking to that fight
Hey so does Joe Biden have a statement on the crazy Trump decision to move troops out of Germany? This is the type of stuff that needs immediate and aggressive messaging. Come on team Biden, Step the eff up!
You must vote third party. Would you please, for the love of God, stop with the half truths and beating around the bushes and just say what you mean!    Biden is a WORSE racist (by your definition) than Trump. So third party right?  Just say it brother!
Housing costs too damn much. Biden has a plan for that. Trump has some fear to stoke.
Yep.  Full acknowledgement that Biden is a lil creepy.  However, Team Biden as a whole is amazing, leap years better than Team Trump.

seeing biden folks like “well trump is like eating a million”. and its like bro you cant even defend your guy. its just “hey he’s slightly better than trump” even tho biden has been in politics longer &amp; therefore had a much worse affect on the nation than trump has had in 3.5 yrs

Joe Biden sucks. Tim Wise sucks. Conspiracy theories keep you comfortable. Here is your hot take contribution to “the discourse” for the day.
He built our economy once he can do it again. He has the experience to recharge the economy. Will Biden work for free? His running mate will be a socialist/Marxist &amp; really running the country. I think POTUS could have done more if worked with rather then resisted at all costs.

I get that switching between print and cursive is something many people do. No expert, but the handwriting here seems very different.
I for one don't. Members of my family for 5 generations and also myself have bleed to defend what that flag stands for. Trump and his Schutzstaffel  have disgraced the memory of this sacrifice. That's on him. I assure you that President Biden WILL restore our faith

Biden Details Proposal To Advance Racial Equity In America
Barr knows even with a democratic sweep, Biden, Pelosi &amp; Schumer will exact no justice from him or any of his colleagues for anything they've done to disgrace the DOJ or harm to America. There are too many democrats on the corporate pay roll.
Who do you think it will be?
One step at a time...I think Biden will win Arizona,  Kelly will win, we have had a Dem governor before.
Yes:  Shifting Third Party to Biden
Seems like a ridiculous mischaracterization of why most of the people are voting for Biden. I don't know if you noticed but Trump has literally been sending out secret police and threatened to use the military on protestors. There is no other option. You're the blue MAGA.
Check out the Lincoln Project’s “Memories” and the Biden Campaigns “Arianna” Ads
It is. Smart progressives got a seat at the table and beefed up Biden's policies, including his climate plan. Why should the leftists that threw a fit get that same treatment? You can't work with people that aren't reliable.
So if 88% of Democrats wanted M4A so bad, why'd they vote for Biden? Seems like if it was a key issue to them, they'd have voted for the guy running on it.

I’d pay good money to see Jerry Nadler and Joe Biden fist fight, that would be hilarious 😂
Prefer Biden’s plan for that too. Don’t like Bernie or his plans. He lost for a reason. Most of us don’t support him.
Biden just called himself “the antithesis of Trump”.  #JoeBidenForPresident2020
Biden talking in circles right now!
Me, and many others, don’t want M4All and prefer Biden’s health plan. That might be a good reason.
Nadler and the democrats sure are looking like the fools they are. Drain the swamp. Trump 2020. Barr 2024. I'm so glad we have Trump as a president instead of that ridiculous Biden. We'd all be dead if that dumb ass was running the country.
Biden is “taking” questions from the media. He calls on a reporter and then clearly reads what he’s supposed to say off an index card. These questions were fed to him ahead of time. Still #HidingBiden
What is the Biden Ticket? He has no VP.
You need to herd your Rinos, Mitch!  YOU will lose the Senate for the American voters.  Get those jackasses in line.  If biden wins this Country will be lost.  Do you want that for us? YOU need to stand up to the dums and fight for TRUMP.
This is the exact type of questioning Joe Biden needs to face.
He meant to say, "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Kingswood community center. I'm going to beat Joe Biden in this year's Senatorial election and if you don't vote for me at your state election physician, you ain't black." #HidinBiden
I want Biden to win so he can screw it up even more. Then I can have an excuse to slap people who used the "Because he's not Trump" narrative.
Ah oh.  Biden got his tongue twisted.   Don Jr. is gonna make him pay for it.  😂
switched to #Biden speech. Is he going to give his #Cornpop speech again? 🤓
I wouldn’t mind but I feel people wouldn’t vote for Biden with that ticket and you know not voting is a vote for donnie!
This is what Biden said-the Trump ad took one part of what he said and left the rest-he said that we 'should not' defund the police-stop showing this deceptive ad-
This is the kind of Questioning Joe Biden needs to face.
Yeah but Joe Biden is just Joe Hiden now lol
We love ❤️ you  Joe Biden. Biden 20/20
Mark my words. Pelosi, Schumer &amp; Biden will not hold any republican or corporation accountable, nor undue the harm they have caused. With Pelosi, Schumer &amp; Biden in charge it will be a continuation of what corporations have purchased, an oligarchy.
Representative, you know, that's not why the republicans put Barr there. It was to protect themselves &amp; Trump. Should dems control both Congress &amp; POTUS, will Pelosi, Schumer &amp; Biden do anything to undue all the harm done by all these criminals? I sincerely doubt it.
How does anyone w/ 2 brain cells believe this sh*t? OBAMA IS NOT PRESIDENT &amp; TRUMP DISMALTLED HIS TASK FORCE.  Everything is either Obama’s fault, or Biden’s America - so the only thing we all agree on is trump hasn’t spent a single day acting as a President. #TrumpFailedAmerica
Wonder what they’d have said if Obama or Biden we’re receding foreign support.
Thank Nancy Pelosi should Biden lose to Trump. Pelosi, Hoyer &amp; the rest of the corporate democrats just stabbed working people in the back when we're at our most vulnerable. I, for one, will not vote for Biden.
RIght. That's why #Biden isn't supporting it, unlike what #OrangeStain your leader is saying.
People that think Biden would be the same as Trump never like...be good at thing.
so you’re telling us that Obama &amp; Biden are to blame for racial problems in America? No, wait—you mean they spied on Trump during the 2016 election? And you have proof that didn’t come from Russian sources? Then PROVE IT or stop yapping about it! Concentrate on NOW!
So true!
LMAO what an awful take.   Trump won Iowa by 10% in 2016 and you're saying it's "not good" for BIDEN that he's down by 1% in a single poll?   spin spin spin spin
If Biden loses, thank Pelosi. Saying the Dems folded, implies Pelosi was negotiating. FYI they aren't now or have ever been negotiating on behalf of the American workers. The biggest impediment to Biden winning, could be Pelosi back stabbing workers who are already on the rocks.

Obviously but the only laws that we have regarding that are in the CRA and the equality act. I HIGHLY doubt that those would be overturned. So just because you don’t like that one aspect, you’d rather have socialist Trump or socialist Biden? Is that what you’re saying?

I think you're on to something important here. Trump is winning no new converts to his campaign of hate, anger and division. He's losing the support of the Hillary haters who voted for him in 2016 who are moving to Biden. He's down to the bottom of the barrel of stalwarts.

China Invested in Hunter Biden. Democrats do not even acknowledge where the Virus was born &amp; how it came to America. Democrats buy friends with Tax Payer Money &amp; Hollywood feels loved.
23% women representatives and Biden thinks he's going to have a black woman for his running mate. I don't think you should do that mr. Biden because I don't think #women are going to be what will elect you, they're only good for breeding don't you know that?

No, we cannot afford to have u and Trump in office. Trump has already done damage and u r wrong 4 this seat. Kelly has my vote all the way and so does Biden. U were defeated for the seat and u just got lucky to get it bcuz a great senator passed.
Get over urself. U look to blame everyone for ur problems and dont take responsibility for anything that u have done wrong which is everything. I hope when u step foot out of the WH after Biden wins, u get the handcuffs put on and go to jail.
A rethug Senator is already carrying the lies promulgated by the Kremlin against Biden in an effort to develop an investigation prior to the election. Watch for negative stories to begin flooding our airwaves.

tRump is already receiving help from his handlers in the Kremlin. Adam Schiff has requested that the FBI Director make a presentation to the entire Congress to spell out what is already being done to discredit Joe Biden. The reason for this request is that a Rethug Senator is

Biden had to be coerced to run since Sanders was not a DNC puppet. When he was still losing, the other candidates convienently bowed out to consolidate strength and oust Bernie. He's not America's pal - he's pure swamp who never changed anything except his family's bank accounts.

When is Biden to appear on Face the Nation &amp; face real questions? Democrats know what they are voting against, but have no idea what they are Voting 4. Biden is an Actor reading a Script written by Bernie &amp; AOC.
What does he have to fear? We know Chrissie will be tossing softballs to Basement Biden.
We can but hope our standing in the world is not so badly damaged it can't be fixed. Although I think a President Biden will go a long way to fix it.
I like Susan Rice a lot. But I still believe that Kamala Harris has a certain energy, attitude, hipness, intellect and drive that would make her a great VP choice for Biden. But I will fight tooth and nail for the Dem ticket, whoever he chooses. We must win this election.
Democrats know what they are Voting Against. They do not know what they are Voting 4 &amp; Biden does not answer real Questions. Joe gets a Media Pass every day. Technically, Joe does not even have a real Ticket like Kanye Jay Z 2020.
In accordance with Democrat precedence: ‘We Have to Elect Biden; Before we Can Know Biden’.
You don’t have your facts straight, sir. Biden is NOT in favor of defunding the police, no matter how many times Trump says he is. Just saying it over and over (Trump style: repetition, repetition) DOES NOT MAKE IT TRUE!

Biden is afraid to answer any questions from the media. He still thinks he’s runny for the Senate.

Of all the insane gaffes, misspeaks, and blatant lies Trump makes constantly, it seems a bit pathetic to keep latching onto the tiniest Biden mistake.  I mean, Trump's been boasting non-stop about "acing" a test that just measures for brain damage. THAT'S cause for concern.
This is absolutely untrue. Biden absolutely doesn't support the Defund the Police movement, simply allocating a small amt of $ 2social programs 2take some load off police. His budget plan actually INCREASES police funding. Please b more informed. "I love uninformed voters"- Trump
I bet Biden can't even remember Person Woman Man Camera TV like big boy Donny could!   Of course those were all items in your eyeline, which wouldn't have been the case with an actual test of cognition. Which, btw passing simply means you're likely not severely brain damaged.

Their excursions into Ukraine aren't exactly going after the Muslims. Russia doesn't get counterattacked because Russia is Russia. I'd expect some sanctions if Biden wins, but that's it. May as well petition NATO to make Finland join.

Literally every single poll has you losing, even polls from conservative bias media sources. Biden has plenty of enthusiasm and you have never had the majority in your corner.  Start writing your concession speech now, because you’re gonna need it.
As I’ve said before, get on it Biden. I’m sure you can outraise Trump around the world.
Well, that much I understand, and I’m sure you realize that Biden would have to put a stop to that kind of thing as well. But my question is, what about the taking people off the streets off federal property? Don’t individuals affected by that have standing? Against the govmnt?
Better: Campaign for Biden like trump is up by 20.
I am going to guess he's referring to Trump ads that show what is currently happening in Dem-run cities that say under Biden that would be America. It's not a threat from Trump.  The Dem message is get rid of Trump and we'll stop or don't and we won't - a threat.

Biden should not select anyone. It is the job of the next Attorney General to investigate and pursue charges. Part of the point of getting rid of Trump is to re-establish an independent DOJ. A US President does not legally go after political opponents!

Joe Biden is historically one of the most respected and well liked politicians. That personal respect spans across the aisle to Democrats and Republicans alike. Repubs will campaign hard against him but in the end they know that he is someone who can cross party lines when needed

He won't be running. They are gonna tie in all this BLM and drop a bomb a month or two out. Why waste your energy on some dried up hack, when you have invested your whole future in societal change. Biden ain't chosen anymore than these mayors are liked.
Yeah Biden lmaof can't remember his own name
We also need a president who reaches out to the progressives in his party.  Listen up, Joe Biden!  The progressives are coming and you and your cronies have your head in the sand!
I'm right on with Biden!
Nah ... Biden is in a good spot.
If Biden gets prepped properly and is ready to go for the jugular and call Trump out on his lies and failures, it will be Biden’s shining hour, not a Trump triumph. Nobody is going to fall for the same crap he got away with in 2016.
I promised to keep you up to date on your sinking campaign.  The latest polls:  Michigan: Biden 49% (+9) Trump 40%  Pennsylvania: Biden 50% (+11) Trump 39%  Minnesota: Biden 51% (+13) Trump 38%  Have a good day!
That, by the way, is going to be a HUGE indicator for election night coverage. If we get 10pm EST and Trump is consistently underperforming in rural counties compared to 2016, it's all over. If Biden is losing 65%-35% there, not only is the Senate gone, but so is TX &amp; GA.
Trump but we'll have to see what biden does in office 🤷🏽‍♂️
An uphill climb, but not outside of reality. Last time, Trump won 90%-10%/85%-15% in the rural counties. If Biden can win in the high 80s in urban and 60s in the suburbs AND If Trump wins by ONLY 70%-30%, Biden can pull it off.
I wonder how long it will take for us to recover from our PTSD after we elect Biden for president
Biden didn’t crush anything. Guys like you couldn’t be bothered to show up to vote. Wannabe revolutionaries crushed it under the weight of their apathy.
And yet...Biden is ahead of Trump in "the poles"... Can't believe any of the numbers on politics OR covid-19
President Trump is the ONLY SANE CHOICE. I didn’t vote for Trump in 2016 but fully intend to In November. Biden clearly has cognitive issues, accused of RAPE, has not been able to keep his hands of women and little girls as well as being a racist
Must be Joe Biden!
Bill Clinton and joe Biden hopefully
Question for #twitterstorians: We know Biden’s assertion that Trump is our first racist POTUS is false. (Several owned enslaved people, Tyler served in the Confederate Congress!)    But is Trump our first wackypants-in-chief?  Have we ever had a dangerously unstable POTUS?
They can expect all they want. Joe Biden is running the most progressive platform EVER and there are prominent republicans endorsing him and y’all are like “Oh man the republicans have us over a barrel.” Chill out man.
I'm remaining cautiously optimistic. I'm used to be intel guy. These are what we call "indicators". Biden can afford to be patient as long as Trump keeps shooting himself in the face on TV and LITERALLY killing his supporters... Big signs will be after Labor Day.
In a sane world, Biden would win, regardless of his platform, given the mal-administration we are experiencing.  That said, why do you think none of those three policies would be in play? Presidents don't introduce legislation, and I HIGHLY doubt HRC would've vetoed any of them.
After Biden we're dismantling the failed two party system right?
Biden will wipe the floor with Trump. I look forward to it, as well.

Black water finger prints all over this
You misunderstand. Mark Charles is quite in touch with reality. If you are saying the people of this country are not, you must not mean all people. He understands the doctrine of discovery that led to what you're saying Trump and Biden are in touch with. Is this knee-jerk?
I fully expect Biden to make a horrific choice for VP.
Biden's going to take the MOCA live on TV and he's not even going to respond to the questions, he'll just say "peanut butter" over and over and over
So what you're saying here is anti-Trump republicans would rather elect Biden? Seriously? Isn't that the only alternative? Just more validation that swamp membership is not based on political affiliation.
Crossroads | Joe Biden For President 2020  via  The new ad -“Crossroads” - that seeks to draw a contrast between Biden and President trump. The new ad focuses on three key issues: the economy, health care and beating Covid-19. LB
We locked down where the hell where you and it didn’t work but I’m sure you don’t think COVID spreads at”protests”either. The Economy was trash when Obama/Biden took it over I said they failed at making it better then from before Cheney and his cronies messed the housing market☝️
First it was Clinton vs Trump now it’s Biden vs Trump. Damn who do I want?? Shitty person A or Shitty person B?Count stopped when Obama/Biden told them to.
Joe Biden is right. The pandemic has shown that the entire 'Trump economy' was built on sand. The economic pain, fear and loss we are all feeling (and the worst GDP drop in history) is a direct result of  failures.
More H.P. Propaganda Biden wont Tweet UNLESS SOMEONE ELSE WRITES it FOR HIM. He is TOO far gone to Engauge in any Intelligent or even cognizant discussions. If he gets elected IT WILL BE THE END of DEMOCRACY! And we WILL BANKRUPT!
BIDEN PLEASE GIVE A NEWS CONFERENCE
WHY WON'T BIDEN GIVE A NEWS CONFERENCE????
There is no other way of saying it.  He will do anything to win The GOP will use the chaos resulting from mail in ballots  The only way to avoid this is Biden winning in a landslide in many states for this to work.
Democrats are idiots. I voted for Warren but can’t wait to vote for Biden. Heaven forbid we can’t project an air of optimism about voting out Trump.
Comedy Central the Biden microphone!
You're great at throwing out statements about Biden, but you NEVER back them up. You have no clue that you're a big joke, or possibly a stupid Russian troll. You're failing to convince anyone to support Trump. Give it up.
'THEY'  Are Using this MAXCIST BLM Movement to Intimidate, scare, and create anxiety! ,they WILL right up until the election! Sell the IDEA that THEY WONT STOP if Trump is RE-Elected! Make no mistake A vote for Biden is SOCIALISM and TRUMP is Democracy TRUMP MUST WIN or we LOSE!!
If Biden gets elected I dont want to LIVE IN what will be the "HELL HOLE" "They" will create! We will BANKRUPT, Get Hyper-Inflation, 1st become Venezuela (with guns) Become a SOCIALIST country and ULTIMATELY Communist. Biden WILL DESTORY OUR ECONOMY!
A handful of recent polls show Joe Biden leading  in a number of key states. Arizona: Biden 49, Trump 44 Texas: Biden 48, Trump 43 North Carolina: Biden 50, Trump 46 If we can hold on to these leads, we’ll defeat Trump &amp; elect a wave of Democrats up &amp; down ballot.

How many others will have second thoughts &amp; think, like they did in 2016, "The polls show Trump losing, so I don't need to vote."? Let's be honest, Biden doesn't exactly have the star power Obama had.  Enthusiasm will depend on how much voters hate Trump, rather than like Biden.
Members of my family have served in the US military since the Revolutionary War. Every one of them, past &amp; present, would support you, 100%. Hopefully, in the Spring, you will be back serving your country through service in the Biden Administration.
I must be missing something. Even if this plan is described accurately, how is it a power grab for Biden? What does Biden stand to gain for his family? More likely the article describes the plan as ruinous because it is Trump propaganda.

How much do YOU OWE the BANK OF CHINA? Do you pay all your bills? #TrumpTaxes #TrumpBankruptcies
Trumps self sabotage is making it so Biden doesn’t have to do anything in order to win. If it was competitive, Biden would be more likely to take it on. Joe Biden has hinted since the intermission of the 1st debate that Yang is going to be in his cabinet.
He *also* said, in the same interview,  that she's very beautiful.    Then he followed it up with he'd date her.  And y'all think Biden is creepy because he friendly.
10 Biilion!  The USPS Union endorse Sleepy Biden so the DNC!  Outrageous
Whoever the misinformed woman in the McSally ad is, claiming she'll protect pre-existing conditions, whereas Kelly &amp; Biden will push government insurance, is sorely mistaken. The entire ad is laughable. McSally is disingenuous. Dems want to build on &amp; fix what's broken w/the ACA.
I feel VERY strongly that this is the wrong election to vote 3rd party. I’ve voted 3rd party since 2012, and this year I can’t do that in good conscience. As fucking shitty as Biden is, this election is about our democracy.
Such a problematic process from the Biden campaign
I am done with Biden he has my vote nothing else
Defunding police...taking away rights...raising tax's...taking jobs away from Americans...stripping us of rights to 🐻 arms...This is a more perfect union? I'm voting to not have this happen..I just have my kids to worry about...And Joe Biden ain't the answer.
Hands off Joe; he's our Asshole.

Hey little fella give me your address so I can send you a pair of big blue shoes and a rainbow colored wig. You don’t have to answer the Biden Question, I already know you answer, Biden is not fit. Keep deflecting and telling yourself whatever you to need so you “feel” better.
Joe Biden ad that says all Trump wants is to divide us is perfectly ironic
is Bill running?  I thought it was Biden.
this is priceless.  Epstein partied with Bill Clinton...  and to think I was positive that  it was JOE BIDEN who was running   against donny
Let's let VP Biden make the choice. He will have to work with that person. Get off his back...he has a darn tough job ahead of him. Just give it a rest.

We've all had those moments where you have no idea what the actual hell to Tweet. Just do what I do sometimes. Tweet your thoughts. Or Tweet about how bad of a president Trump is and how much better Biden would be.
Always believe the woman Biden said, right  ?
Rather than do actual work, House Democrats are subpoenaing Secretary Pompeo because they think he helped "advance a conspiracy theory" about Joe Biden.  We're in the middle of a pandemic, and this is what Democrats are doing right now.
Hope you’re wrong Mike, he needs spirited youthful look that leaves Harris who was quite close to Biden family. No grudges palm note may be the clue?
Why oh why do democrats eat their own? ANY woman Biden picks will be fine. They are ALL excellent. Plus...they will be debating a Qtip.
That’s Joe Biden statement.” You bet Joe will keep us safe.”
Oh they will accept it. We've had to accept the criminal in the WH for four years. We are going to follow the law. Let's make that loud and clear. When trump loses, the military steps in  Poll: Most Trump voters say they won't accept results if Biden wins
Biden won’t know who he is or where he is by next week.
Compare &amp; Contrast! e.g. Biden/Obama left cupboard bare! Give stats on their PPE, Tests, Medicine, Ventilators, etc. than give yours. Bullet Points. People like bullet points, not prose! Message!
Also, Biden will bring that by himself. Susan Rice is the only one who covers your points - and they aren't the most important. And, again, Biden covers rebuilding ally's trust all by himself.
No doubt Juan heard Biden differently than Emily. Suspect Juan heara Biden differently than everyone does. #TheFive
🤣🤣🤣 You liberals are a treat. Anything to deflect. Still avoiding the Biden question. It must be exhausting being a liberal. Mental Gymnastics all day long.
Last time was Biden. He told Obama he would not be running. But I'm not holding that against him now because he was the consensus candidate who can beat Trump.
And he's blaming the Portland stuff on Biden.  He said this will be Biden's way if Biden is elected president.   What bullshit!!
Really not though. Biden became VP partly because he told Obama he'd have to Presidential ambitions - or none that would interfere for 8 years. They did well.
Biden has never said Defund the police! And everything you just said about Biden is exactly to a T describing Trump! But add lying, fake conspiracy theories and blame everybody but himself mentality! And it takes somebody with those same characteristics to vote for him
Where's hunter Biden?
This a.m. on ABC15 PHX I saw two "Joe Biden's America" ads on the morning news. Of course the footage of destruction is from tRUmp's America.

Clintons are the absolute worse among the privileged assholes sharing the government monopoly we all must deal with as it crushes us beneath barely hidden racism &amp; fascism Biden, another architect of misery, could do even worse than Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. Let that sink in.

I'm pretty angry #Tsarnev will get another shot at life.  #BostonBomber Russia tried to warn Biden Obama and Hillary, but she let them in anyway.  Instead of treating him like an American, he should have his VISA revoked and let Chechnya or ? deal with his illegal *ss.
This is a LIE - Does he ever provide details on the internal polls? It is probably just his family &amp; Stephen Miller, 100% Trump, none of them want Biden
🤔 you’re sounding a lot like bumbling Biden these days. Might want to check your meds, something is definitely off.
Terrible for Blacks. Over several decades,  criminal-justice system more punitive than any other advanced democracy’s.   Biden crafted the 1994 crime bill,  preferred to call it (as recently as 2015), the “1994 Biden" bill.
Actually, men (and women) HAVE said that about Biden. It's why nobody expects him to run in 2024 and are looking to his VP to carry on his administration's legacy instead.
8 miserable destructive yrs under Obama/Biden. Foreclosures on homes..jobs lost..people on food stamps &amp; welfare. People lost hope by the evil run government. Pres trump brought back hope &amp; patriotism back to America. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 🇺🇸
These men are afraid Kamala Harris will challenge the white male stranglehold on politics, and it's exactly why Biden should pick Harris. White men had their shot and they've damn near destroyed the republic. Go play golf, Ed, your time is over.
Sadly, Yes.  Come January 21st, I will start letting my complaints about Biden be known.  I hear you, and since I'm not a Black woman, I'll follow you on this for sure.
Uhmm, you shouldn't add those 2 together... It's % of voters by voting type. So you add the same voting type/different candidates together to get 100% (if you include 3rd party).   So for by mail: Biden (32) +Trump (65) +3rd party (3)  =100%.
You’re still on this?? And YES, I am voting Biden. Not excited about it, but it’s necessary. And my profile used to say MAGA.  No more. (Independent now, for Biden.)

Sum bout how hard Joe Biden tryna get down with the niggas don’t sit right wit me 🧐
Good grief,  please cut the sexist crap. ALL presidential candidates and former candidates have a sizable ego... as do you. Was Biden a bad VP because he eventually ran for president himself... a third time? Or was that okay because he’s a man?
And we are still in Iraq. Biden voted and supported the Iraq war for years. Same with Afghanistan war. Dems and Republicans are equally responsible. Let's not forget who put Trump there, the Dems.
Actually, I’m for Biden. But if most Americans do vote by mail (if millions do!), then it’ll take weeks to get a result. And there will be all kinds of problems.   Remember Florida in 2000?   But, I’m bored with this.. Bye.💋
Biden can win by letting tRump lose. Keep tRump loaded with ammo. He will repeatedly shoot himself.
Who uses a eulogy to play politics? Biden/Obama Who cared more about winning an election than American lives? Biden/Obama
Lie! 42%, behind Biden by 6.
Anyone chosen will be a thrall to Democrat corruption, so who cares. We'll need to deal with Biden and whoever after they're elected, unfortunately.
I just want a fair election. If there’s any fraud, it’ll most likely benefit Biden.  For “the world’s greatest democracy”, voting in the USA is very sloppy. Now no one wants anyone to show ID to vote, and now “mass mailing” of ballots to millions of people.

Where is Joe Biden's leadership during this pandemic. Nothing but effortless platitudes and sloganeering from the "great" (non)leader.
I really don’t think he’s much better, before covid im not sure there’s anything Trump was doing to run the country into the ground. One thing Biden would be better at is uniting the country over racial injustice.
I suspect the Democrat plan is for Biden and his female VP to enter the White House, then after a short time Biden will resign as President and the US will have its first Woman President.
Do you think Biden should even bother debating him?
Is Biden better? They both suck. How have we came to this? Best thing Is that corna keeps up so Biden doesn’t have to debate, you know that. I just don’t understand how these are the two candidates. It’s crazy
Chica, I totally agree. I was just thinking this morning that maybe I should take a week off and bury my head in the sand w the rest. Extreme precaution w Covid and ridin’ w Biden but I’m exhausted. Not sleeping and go to bed w disgust and wake up the same.
So, what are we thinking?  A Biden/Pelosi ticket?  Haven't heard rumors on that front-- why not?
Trump can't navigate a handicapped ramp without help,  drink with one hand, and can't answer a simple question without automatically rambling on about an unrelated subject.  Biden has had a stutter his whole life he has worked to overcome. Maybe fuck yourself with that bullshit.
Not sold on IA or MT electing Democratic Senators while also voting for Trump. If anything you'd see split ticketing the other way, a vote for Biden but a Republican Senate as a check.
Biden was partly or mostly behind:  Crime bill, bankruptcy bill, police militarization, Iraq War, coups in Latin America, etc...  I don't support Trump nor Biden   I have great issues with someone xenophobically pushing the debunked russiagate instead of focusing on real issues.

Dems are always loaded with “passion.” Biden won’t have to pick on that one quality- it’s everywhere in excess.
Honestly if the trump wing of the party gets beaten down hard enough and Biden pushes for compromise they could caucus a few republicans.
This is what they do, and the very reason Biden is hidden in a basement somewhere. They have the next election so rigged he doesn't have to attend a debate or campaign. It terrifying actually.

The CCP is not our friend. They have made that very clear for decades. Ignore the propaganda and hit the CCP even harder. All the more reason to keep Biden out. He has been peter puffing  The CCP his entire career.
1.) Character limit 2.) Personally disliking someone and policies are different.  I dislike Biden and Obama too but all for various reasons
The great thing is that both these great women will be part of the Biden team, along with an amazing list of others. Finally, no empty positions, no temporary and unqualified idiots, not suck ups who only care about their own gain.
Well no, it's not ok. Biden has it in his head that joking about Trump's tweets is something that people care about when in reality nobody really gives a fuck about trump vs Bidens tweets, people just need healthcare. Honestly it's not that hard to understand
Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden  #SmartNews
Biden? Mentally fit? Picture him 1,2,3 and 4 years from now. Then re-elections?
We should have an automatic ballet Every registered voter that never bought a MAGA hat or went to a trump rally Is an automatic vote for Biden
Taxpayer-Funded Voice of America Launches Internal Probe Into Election Ad for Biden  via
This is 2016 all over again...the closer we get to the election the crazier the Dems get and common sense tells me they are losing and they know it.  The 12% advantage Biden supposedly had in polls a week ago has now lost 30% of that advantage.  More BS just like Russia!
I disagree. Biden has an important skill that Trump has proven is critically lacking in his Admin. Biden can &amp; will build a team of our country’s best to run our agencies &amp; fill his cabinet. Trump has run off the best of the Republicans. We have a fourth string team under him.
It's the attempt to bypass #VoterID.  We don't believe in 112% voting counting dead people and illegal citizens, while Obama/Biden/Dems do think it's okie dokie.  #VoterFraud
If President Biden and team go after him yes. I think alot more criminal activity will be found after hes gone.
There are no candidates right now actually qualified for president. Trump can't handle a  Pandemic or protests. Biden is the architect of our issues. Jo just wants nothing left. Howie parrots Russiagate.
Don't count out Duckworth in Biden VP race
Kelly sold out to Chinese. Has been hiding in his basement more than BIDEN! Sen McSally has worked her ass off for Arizonans. Return her to the Senate!!!
A true Biden voter!
I Can not support anyone who has committed crimes against children or participates human trafficking. This goes for anyone and any party. Serious Question, do you think Biden is mentally fit to run the country? Before answering picture him 1,2,3 and 4 years from now.
Just a reminder that Fox, Brightfart, Levin (that stupid little fraud) is out to defeat Biden
You're holding him accountable for fixing what?? Anyone could grab our pics and our names and say that we've failed for 30 years. You sound like you're a hard working guy...would that be fair? The Lincoln Project are all Republican. Biden's pandemic plan is there. Check it out.
Biden team talks economic development with Native American business leaders
My point is that you are all jargon, soundbites and no perspective. Your meme is, of course, without any testable arguments. What was supposed to do that he failed to deliver? On the opposite end, can you name something he's done well? Do you know Biden is my point?
I’m not a Trumpster.   I’m voting for Biden.  Although still haven’t heard him say what he wants to do.  (And he’s been around 40 years and hasn’t done much yet.) But Trump’s just too divisive for his few good ideas.
Trump probably wants to delay the election so he can stay in the White House for a little while longer...  Funny that he thinks he has so much power. He thinks he's a king. He's probably scared of the election because he knows he isn't going to win against Biden.
Devin Nunes declines to say whether he received foreign information meant to damage Biden
VP JOE BIDEN, PLEASE DO NOT PICK KAREN BASS!!!! BASS IS SHARP BUT PEOPLE WOULD NOT VOTE FOR YOU WITH HER AS VP!!!!  THEY HAVE TO LIKE HER AS PRES. IF YOU SHOULD DIE!!!!  WARREN OR HARRIS WOULD BE GOOD.
Best friend just told me she’s still not sure if she can bring herself to vote for Biden. 😑 🤬 She’s big on 2A and anti-abortion. Basically told her come Nov 3rd  🎶You either with me or against me, Ho🎶  And then I signed up to phone bank for Biden.
AZ Central: Biden: Native Americans won't be 'afterthoughts'
Once we get Trump and his enablers bounced from office, we all need to put our shoulders into the work effort and put Tucker Carlson out of business.  He is eyeballing 2024.  Let's make sure he loses that notion in 2021.  Onward to Nov 3 and focus on Biden Inauguration
Biden will need to call a super sanitation company. Boggles the mind.
No. He needs to support Biden. The alternative does not demonstrate a higher level of integrity, which is what you suggest. The alternative reduces safety &amp; security for people both here &amp; across the globe. We can’t fight the status quo &amp; vote Biden. Let’s get Biden on board.
The problem is when you run a business you should know your customers might be either Democrats or Republicans. To respect all his customers he should have kept the flag for his home or maybe his office. Knowing it will offend people just like if it was a Biden flag Common sense
A Joe Biden victory will be because of this guy and you can’t convince me otherwise.
When guys like you dish up this stuff and, further, say "that's what you'll get with Biden," no one with a brain takes you seriously. You only further hurt Trump's reputation (if that is even possible). #StopTheStupidity
Democrats called the FBI after finding shipping receipt for anti-Biden dirt sent to Devin Nunes from overseas: report  #SmartNews
Joe Biden should pick Kamala Harris as his VP. I’m a fan of Kamala Harris. She’s smart as a whip.
Biden team talks economic development with Native American business leaders
People are once again put in a difficult situation by having to choose between Trump and Biden, but it's very clear that Trump must be voted out of office.
You only call it ignorance because you fail to do real research and look things up. Like did you know Biden wrote the 94 crime bill that incarcerated so many black men and Trump commuted their sentences so they could get out?
If you have a problem with Biden there’s no logical way that you can’t have a problem with Trump
Remember How Rightwing Media Attacked Biden for Predicting Donald Trump Would Try to Postpone the Election?  #SmartNews
Disgusting bastard! Prison for Bill Clinton, prison for Hillary Clinton, prison for Barack Obama, prison for Joe Biden, etc etc etc!
Agreed. He should absolutely support Biden. And no one should view that as supporting the establishment. It is what it is at this point. Trump has to go. Yang was one of the brightest economic minds to run for President in my lifetime. I hope he sticks around in politics.
MR. PRESIDENT AMERICA HAS OVER ( 4,000,000 ) FOUR MILLION CASES AND OVER ( 150,000 ) ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DEATHS DUE TO THE " TRUMP-VIRUS " COVID-19 AND NO SANE AND RATIONAL PERSON IS GONNA BELIEVE THAT IS JOE BIDEN'S FAULT.
I wish. These are the same people that pushed Biden for presidential candidate while he was being openly accused of rape.
People are looking at the "Every night will be Purge night under Biden" Trump ads and are telling themselves, "You know, that's a lot better than what's going on now.
Unfortunately people will see this and (again...still) think the pandemic was organized to help Biden. 🤦🏼‍♀️
Look at Biden's history of failure. It's right there to see. Can you give us one thing he has accomplished?
His comment did stereotype, which itself is not cool. I agree with you and so does a good chunk of Americans. That doesn't make him a racist. Biden isn't perfect, but he's done more for this country than you know. At least read his Wikipedia page. :)
I think Susan Rice. Its just a feeling. But she is close to Biden has executive experience as ambassador to the UN, and has no legislative baggage.
Thank you 🙏🏽 pray no Biden he said he will undo all Trump has done !
We have two bad choices for President in 202, but if you were truly capable of demonstrating objectivity you would see that Trump is much more dangerous to our national security &amp; rule of law than Biden.   When Trumps interests conflict w/the nation’s, he serves himself above all
I'm not a racist period...never have been nor will I be. You're drawing your own conclusions from a soundbite taken out of context. If Biden was racist, it would be clear...like Trump. Trump publicly demonstrates it.
Tammy Duckworth:   - Is totally over this ‘veepstakes’ shit  -Probably owns more than one firearm  -Supported Biden since he first announced his campaign in 2019.
also remember that like 1/2 of the dem candidates all convienently dropped out and endorsed biden right before Super Tuesday when Bernie looked strong
Can't wait until November when Biden in, Trump out
I can’t get used to plebescite by Twitter.
We know what the results are, Biden in, Trump out
Well said.
Only an idiot votes for Biden who seems to have one foot in the grave already...
This has to be in the Top 5 of your most ignorant, ridiculous and outright BS lie of ALL the other idiotic tweets you have put out.   VP Biden isn't POTUS...YET. but the incompetent, corrupt, lying conman &amp; his grifter family is stealing/destroying USA while #GOPBetrayedAmerica
Dr. Fauci is a long time liberal Democrat he supports Joe Biden he is friends with Obama and the Clintons we must allow the voices of other doctors beside his voice social platforms like Twitter are colluding to keep the American people ignorant of the facts about Covid
On the single most important Catholic faith issue, Pro Life, Joe Biden is in total disagreement with Church teachings.
If y’all Trumpers don’t wanna vote this November because it’s “rigged” then don’t vote. Honestly at this point both Biden and Trump are both pigs and neither one has my vote. #VoteGreen2020
Twitter continues with its biased democratic support for Joe Biden by allowing anti-trump films but denying the Trump campaign access to the site
But it’ll likely happen under Biden’s AG. It’s not Barr is going to go after Dershowitz.   “Do you think that it’s fair for a 67-year-old man to be sent to prison to seven to nine years?” - Barr  (This is the closest I could find to a GIF of Bill Barr)
And who owns the CLOSEST island to Epstein? Biden's BROTHER!
What really gets under the Berniebros' skin is that Bernie himself has come out in support of Biden and has even said that Biden's plans are the most progressive he's ever seen -- and I love their meltdown over it!
- the third leg of #traitortrump plan to set up authoritarian regime here...
How come Twitter doesn’t allow such elaborate films from the Trump campaign? Because Twitter is bigoted bias and politically rooting for Joe Biden that’s why
What a great video.  Thank you guys for the sneak preview and the hearty discussion.  Onward to Nov 3 and pedal to the metal until Joe Biden is inaugurated.  Let's build a stronger, more united nation

Remember liberals in the media said four years ago about Trump after election day.  "Let's give him a chance"  What are they going to say about Biden after the election?
Correct. That’s why I’m voting Biden
I’ll take Biden for $500!
Obama got a 2 for 1 yesterday-did his duty to attend funeral and provided a political speech for Biden!  Go back to the Vineyard.
Pretty sure Obama and Biden created more jobs than trump. Drove unemployment down and saved multiple industries. Trump gave tax cuts to rich people and drove our deficit through the roof.
Biden only needs to win 3 battleground states to defeat Trump – and he's leading in all 6
Biden is very ignorant
Dr. Fauci is a joe Biden supporter a friend of Clinton and Obama a long time liberal Democrat his opinions are tainted
Weird Biden was VP and things were fine. He’s a much better option than the shit storm we’re in now. Actually anyone is. A rock could do a better job.
Obama/Biden brought the country back from the great recession Republicans created and Biden will do it again!
It's up to all of us #KeyboardWarriors especially those with a huge following to flood Twitter with the horrors of socialism! Expose Biden Obama for the corrupt government they ran!
I love how the people who call Donald Trump a Nazi white supremacist are the same ones who lecture everyone else who says Joe Biden is going senile.

You extrapolate all that from a gotcha soundbites? He said that...he did. Put every word you say under a microscope and see how well you fare. Biden was Barrack's VP...calling Biden racist is absurd. He has flaws, but your assessment couldn't more inaccurate.

You favor completely incompetent and mentally deficient Biden?? How much did it take??? You have lost your mind and announced it.
That’s how I will feel when Biden appoints 4 MORE justices to the Court.
The problem is I know that. but it seems to me that there's a vast pendemic in this country that doesn't understand socialism or that indeed that's the ticket the Joe Biden is running on. how can a party put up a demented candidate in all honesty
As Bernie’s slogan #NotMeUs says, this is not about Bernie Sanders. Love me some Bern, but I’m not going to sellout my principles because his campaign made a deal with Biden. Extended to 2024? Still won’t vote for Biden especially when HRC campaign made same empty promises in ‘16
This article does not debunk anything other than the writer couldn’t get an interview with the accuser.
Really 🤷🏽‍♀️I’m not surprised.Thats why I closely watched my elders and their choice b/c Biden was not my choice.However I’m studying the dynamics with Biden. These White Conservative people “silent majority” are full of Shitttt‼️We keep _Our Eyes 👁👁On The Prize  &amp; March On ✊🏽
Have you ever viewed a video that was "favorable" to Biden?...Me either.
I would sleep better knowing that Biden Admin, House and Senate will investigate and prosecute where necessary and not be overtly "magnanimous" in trying to move forward. These people need to be publicly exposed. A "Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities" maybe?
If you have any doubt that right wing media has lost its mind, Tucker Carlson disparages good decent men like Obama and Biden and glorifies Trump, a man with no moral compass, no sense of compassion, who is fundamentally dishonest to his core.
Not at all… but they’re not *that* different, and Biden and people like him are personally and directly responsible for screwing things up to the point where someone as awful as trump could be elected.
Yeah ok, that’s why Biden is leading trump in the polls.
Lmao explain why you stated Biden was a racist
I know I don't have many followers and I am not twitter famous, but please respond with "yes" if you are going to vote for Joe Biden this November.  #biden #Biden2020 #DumpTrump2020 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #TrumpFailedAmerica
Joe Biden is basically a Republican tho. He isn't the solution. He may not be as evil or bad as Trump, but he's still bad.
Biden at least won the medal. Why the hell would anyone even believe that Harvey Weinstein would earn a presidential medal? I just don’t know how someone can be stupid enough to ever believe that as a possibility
No BIDEN ?  IS THIS HOW HE WILL RUN HIS PRESIDENCY BEHIND THE CURTAIN?
I'm absolutely positive there are 10s of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of conservatives who will vote for Biden because they have morals. There are ZERO true liberals that support trump. I say this with complete certainty.
Your  "Joe... you don't have to do this" quote.  Spoken to Biden since he said, just two days ago, the "2020 Census was two censuses ago"... or were you relying on you experience with Biden's stupidity and NOT Biden's obvious dementia?
News Flash the Obama/Biden administration used up the national stock pile of PPE's and other medical supplies needlessly for the h1n1 virus and didn't replenish the stock piles they used up.... News Flash the GDP is only 9.32% down from last year.  News Flash before the virus....
But Biden is better? Come on now Mario wake up
Joe Biden is an actual racist. 🤣 Seeing Dems praise him while calling Trump supporters racist for supporting Trump is comedy Gold. What half-wits.
FACT CHECK:  Biden did not explicitly tie xenophobia to the travel restriction. His tweet reflects coronavirus remarks he made during a campaign stop in Iowa Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced.
FACT CHECK:  Biden tweeted: "We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump's record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency."
Joe Biden is literally everything the left claims Trump is. So I find this whole election to be rather amusing.

So who's running with Biden cause Obama ain't saying shit about that's my dawg
Forgive me, but: as a lifelong politician, Biden isn't  totally honest &amp; hasn't always been a good person...sadly comes w/ the territory. That being said...he's our only hope and INFINITELY more honest, decent, qualified, and AMERICAN than the current POS
BIDEN thinks the 2020 Census is/was/soon to be “two censuses ago”… making this the election of  2040.  Yeah…. “elect this man” POTUS.
Biden? He doesn’t seem to have any burning issues he wants to tackle if elected. (Half the time he can’t remember where he is!) Still don’t know why he’s even running.   Trump’s obnoxious, but he ran with a list of things he wanted to do, and has been DOING IT. Refreshing!
They claimed  was kneeling to support BLM in front of a flag. Instead he was kneeling to draw a 4 yr old in for a sniff.

Yes the Recession that started in 2007, before Obama took office, hit bottom in 2008/09, people forget Obama inherited an economy on the brink of collapse and it took years to recover.  If Biden wins the Republicans will say, "everytime a Democrat takes office the Economy is bad"
Wubya with the A+ reflexes! 45 could never lol. Neither would Biden lol. Quite impressive lol
The thing is that there is no Biden scandal they can fabricate or uncover that is worse than the MANY scandals and failures of Trump and his F team.
Chicken little speaking again, don’t worry you will lose to Biden
Calculated twitter bomb, just as many of the others. Create intense angst on the left, MSM and Biden Campaign. The distractions and intense hateful smears propel President Trump to the WIN!

We saw how the October surprise strategy turned for access Hollywood and trump. At least on the scandal / ethics  front, joe Biden is in better shape than Hillary.
You would think if the trump team or the media or the ‘Russians’ have some dirt on biden roll out they would have by now to create that drumbeat unless they put all marbles on October surprise.
He’s too old and out of it? Hunter Biden hasn’t really caught on ? Biden has not shown up in the #JeffreyEpsteindidntkillhimself #GhislaineMaxwell stuff. The Bernie crowd doesn’t hate Biden like they did Clinton and her surrogates.

Trump and Biden, Demented brothers in mayhem.
My favorites are: 1. WARREN (who’d be the best at governing w/Biden, great policy person, best debater against Pence).  2. HARRIS (but I’d rather see her as AG).  3. RICE (but I’d rather see her as Sec. of State or Natl Security Advisor). All 3 are quality folks. Joe wins w/all.
get the national guard to man the polling sites because I will walk my 64 year old behind across ground glass bare footed to vote for Joe Biden
When Trump shut down travel Biden and Bernie called him racist but like, was that not exactly what was needed? They actively sabotaged Trump at our expense. And both parties passed those horrid bailout bills. Only Massie, a Kentucky Republican, was honest with us about that.
Does that address Biden?  Oh I guess not. Nice diversion
Nothing more than lying rhetoric so if you lose to Biden, you can contest it and say "its fraudulent, I warned about this" to try and hold onto power.  I'm not buying it.  I've voted through the mail for 12 years.  Not had any issues with it.
funny to read liberal idiots calling TUCKER CARLSON RACIST!!!! Because Tucker doesn't march in step with them. THANK GOD HE DOESN'T. Thank GOD actual SMART people don't march in step with them. Hell even Joe Biden in the polls is starting to lose to TRUMP. Gonna be fun!
Melissa, you may have a lot of words but you need to be able to string them together in a coherent and thoughtful way.   Otherwise you’re just like Joe Biden
I think Biden, like your father, can also identify a picture of an elephant. Unfortunately, you only know it by the tail you cut off after you murder it.
So kind of like Biden 😂😂😂
Absolutely. No question. Heard what #Biden said? Guys an idiot.
Who ?? Biden ??? Cause it fasho ain’t me lol
Biden could pick a flower for all I care I'll STILL VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO
That’s hilarious 😂 especially when Biden’s slogan is I chose “truth over facts”
Because that *is* the Democratic Party. It’s racist, sexist and homophobic. That’s why Biden is the candidate. So many better to pick from but we were told Dems wouldn’t vote for anyone other than a white man.  Huge disappointment in the party beginning in 2016.
You’re either deteriorating faster than Biden or this is a serious cry for help.
Pay tribute? Obama gave a Biden campaign speech! #Communists
LoL. So funny. Just because Biden is unhealthy to be nice. You people are going to try and say our President isn't  healthy. We will say in the debate who is healthy and who is not. #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Of course not because ⁦ ⁦ is a Russian tory! Nunes won't say if he got foreign info meant to damage Biden
To clear it up I don’t think you’re racist if you vote for Biden😂  You just can’t tell someone they racist if they vote for trump , then turn around and endorse another racist
has gotten valise and made information for a UKR source who he setup when he was there. The so call evidence tries to hurt Biden but it’s false and made up .  he was talk to Trump when I found this out
R’s, from top to base, hate their fellow Americans. They’ll take the hit so long as others hurt. It’s telling that the few former trump voters who say they’ll be voting Biden almost all complain about how they’re in pain. Most magas are delighted, even as they’re evicted.
These aren’t the only polls though &amp; Biden’s numbers have drastically fell from last month
I’m a mom and I support Biden. Your father in law is demented.
That wasn't a eulogy. That was a desperate cry for help to elect Biden because they are all f*cked.
If Biden gets elected he's going to be the first president to get bullied by other countries
Biden's washed up and frankly stupid.
But Biden spoke at Grand Wizards funeral
Uh, mom here.  What's best for my children is to NOT DIE.  I'll trust Biden to safely open schools, not the Orange Menace who wants to use our kids to improve his poll numbers.
You mean no more "Every night is Purge night in Biden-land" and "Granny got raped and it's Joe Biden's fault"? Because those are the only two commercials I have seen from Trump, and they suck ass.
If it's discovered that Rudy is a regular at Epstein Island...  That will totally ruin Rudy's "evidence" that Biden made billions off Ukraine  Nervous yet Donnie?!?
You should be more concerned with how bad Joe Biden is going to lose...the only positive things is that his dementia will stop him from comprehending the beating he received....
Thank you, VP Biden.  You're gonna make a hell of a president
Boring Biden is good.  Trump fasism, No Bueno!
Actually neither. Who Biden picks as his VEEP isn't going to change my vote. Joe could pick his imaginary friend from his early childhood as VEEP, I'd still vote for him. 🇺🇸💙🌊
Now do Joe Biden.
He tripled-down at the presser. Denounce him and announce your intention to vote for Biden.
Maybe when Biden gets in office our country will have the political will to try at least?
No President has been comparable to a fascist dictator...until today's attempt to postpone an election (was not even done in Civil War...)  #No.  Reality gives you a binary choice:  Biden &amp; Democracy or Trump &amp; Authoritarianism.  Sadly, it is this black-and-white
The “Cocomelon” videos my toddler watches on YouTube have a bunch of Joe Biden ads. Joe is absolutely going to crush the under 3 demographic. Olivia absolutely hates malarkey.
Trump can’t fuck off too but I would rather have Trump over Biden 10x over
Honestly, I think if we go to Biden it goes back to the good ol boys running things. So I’m pretty up in the air, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Biden won. I wouldn’t stereotype myself as a trumper. Just someone who’s really tired of American politics.
It could, we will see that would mean Biden would have to win. With his voting record he doesn't have the backing the media is claiming.
And that fact that people think we only have Trump and Biden to choose from LUL
People really think Biden is better then Trump.
He needs to pick a VP with 2 brains since Biden has lost his!
2021 will be an excellent year with Joe Biden as President..... American democracy will survive the current inept and corrupt fascist regime
I heard you say that Biden's comments on the breakfast club got you upset. I am so happy to hear that. For a minute, I was wondering how could he say such things with out consequence.
Well he only got 7-8% of the black vote in 2016 and won. He has done more for blacks than Obama / Biden so he should get 15-20% of the black vote this time. If he does, he will win by a landslide
I don’t think Joe Biden could do ANYTHING to make this country less safe than it is now, today, under you, your Republican Party, and the Stable Genius/Friend of Dictators and Despots....
This is like the 14th time I've done this to  or   The time to complain about Biden is after change of occupant at 1600 Penn. Ave.  There are more people than just you making sacrifices to vote. #JohnLewis  Squeaker=#Fail - has to be a blowout. 🚫Selfish
Progressive is being co-opted by the middle.  Biden calls himself a progressive.  The back to normalcy crowd just think it sounds nice.
Much respect to you sir. Let's bury the hatchet and act in the best interest of the United States of America! Biden 2020!
Congrats if you're preemptively blaming fellow citizens for Biden's failure  That's exactly what your masters want you to do so you aren't watching their fuckery
If Biden wins, this is a sneak peek of what America will be like. You are an enemy of the people. Treasonous is another way to put it. Coordinate to over throw the Gov is treason. They have too much power! Break them up or hold them accountable.
We moms will decide that for ourselves. And I’d choose Biden a kajillion trillion times over Trump.
Much safer in Joe Biden's America than Trump/Pence Russian satellite Fascist country
...EXACTLY.....Q is an INTROSPECTIVE NARCISSISTIC EXCUSE to be lazy and tune out.... besides that...... if Q is our only hope..... WELCOME BIDEN NOW!
GREAT QUESTION for  HOW MANY BLACK AMERICANS have you hired since leaving office? TRUMP HAS HIRED THOUSANDS IN BUSINESS. How many have you hired? 2? 3? or NONE. Tell us!! How many has BIDEN hired? 2? 3? TRUMP BEATS YOU ALL BADLY!

Right. According to Biden he wasn't black anyway because he was a Trump supporter. According to Dems in power he should have stayed in the gutter where he could have been plyed with food stamps and state assistance. He broke their 'black mold'
You all keep sharing and roasting the “Settle for Biden” accounts as if you all aren’t unironically going to vote for him in November 🤦🏻
What has Joe Biden done?
Will Joe Biden swear to accept the election result ON ELECTION NIGHT? Or does he intend to use the army of 500+ lawyers he’s assembled to obscure the vote?
Want to energize independents and conservatives in the United States then have Obama campaign for Biden! #Trump2020
Remember the old adage “United We Stand, Divided We Fall”? Joe Biden will create much more division than the Left already has. This country will burn at his feet.

No I’m talking to you. You said money is being distributed to biden voters. Which ones? Cuz it wasn’t me. So who do you mean?
Trump is not the root or source of people’s anger. People were angry before and that’s the reason they elected trump because they were tired of the bureaucracy that had been there for so long, Biden is no better than Hillary in fact he’s worse. That’s why I will still vote trump
I'm a mom. You don't speak for me. I'm Ridin with Biden.
He’s listening to doctors and scientists unlike you folks who believe in conspiracy theories and untruths.  Don’t you worry your pretty little head off Kimmie, moms and grandmothers like me will be voting for Joe Biden. Now go eat some cake.
Democrats put a criminal and a guy with dementia up against him. Put somebody worth a shit that doesn’t threaten to take away constitutional rights and trump wouldn’t win. We don’t want trump we just really don’t want Clinton and Biden.
This is true.  Anyone supporting Democrats or their policies is by definition a racist and dishonest.  First time voters need to do some serious research... #Biden2020 #Biden2020Landslide #JoeBidenForPresident2020 #JoeBiden #biden #dnc #cnn #cbs #nbc #Democrat #PelosiMustGo

Can we get None Trump supporting Republicans to just not cast a vote November 3rd if they won’t cast one for Biden? Who’s Lying?
Biden’s America...
Who the f knows? You and I know Biden should be toast but WTF!
That’s ok Biden will bring it back and better and Trump won’t be able to do a damn thing out of office but take his upside down Bible and his form of Christianity which is none and pry for the courts to not prosecute his Demonic sex offender ass! Who’s Lying?
For me we’re effed either way. Biden and trump are both terrible leaders.  I’m going trump because I can’t pay more taxes, support for law enforcement, and fighting against political correct bullshit, Which covers a lot of areas.    Biden is about to make a horrible Vp choice.

Oh, it's the China virus, Dave. Wujan, China, virus. And the CCP withheld knowledge it was transmissible human to human. Thankfully,  had the courage to stop flights coming to U.S. Btw, VP Biden called that xenophobic and racist. Where'd we be now, Dave...? #USA

Poor Trump supporters have nothing  to say but they wish President Biden does the same things as Trump.  Lol
Number one, what about the other 44% who aren't ready for schools to reopen, prob because they don't think its safe?   And how many of your 56% only want schools to open if they know it's safe?   Biden cares about our children, Trump does not. Trump only cares about the optics.
No worries.   will play a very important role TBD in the Biden Administration.
Joe Biden has constantly handled China with kid gloves.  President  is the first president in modern history to finally start holding China accountable for their many abuses.  The debate isn't even hard.
Biden is not competent. His running mate will be President. He certainly is not going to do anything more for people now that his dementia is worsening. It is sad how they are using the sick old man who has given so much of his life to this country.
WOW O.0 o.0 O.o so many reasons for impeachment. Our system, more than just Congress, is now broken. Needs repair. Needs not-Trump. Needs Biden.
Obviously the media over there are not trying to get Joe Biden elected, much lower bar in terms of truth telling.
Trump is killing us daily but stupid #NeverBiden Bernie Bros are more concerned about Biden mispronouncing a word. Idiots!
People prodding Congressman to back Biden are asking to load an atomic bomb on the White House.
I would crawl through a river of shit like Andy Dufresne to vote for Mark Kelly &amp; Joe Biden even if the polls showed them ahead 99% to 1%.  They all need to be humiliated.  Not just defeated.
Trump is actively working against black people but #NeverBiden Bernie bros are more concerned about Biden saying “You ain’t black”. These people are stupid.
It was perfect... in every way. And a reminder of just how much is at stake on November 3. We can choose Trumps America, that is filled with cruelty, racism, hate and division, or an Obama/Lewis/Biden America, that is filled with love, unity, equality and hope.
Even the anti-American NY Post rats see their futures circling the drain if Biden gets in a real office...
And Biden wouldn’t remember WHAT he tweeted 2 minutes later!😂
True! That's why we're voting Biden, to stop America to become Russia's bitch #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

If RNC dumps Trump because he's a loser, its going to be harder for Biden.  IMHO.

He is under Ukranian criminal indictment right now. Also can you explain to me why the push for racial equality would pick a man like biden who authored the 1994 crime bill?
I am just so blown away by this thread. Still crying. No wonder Barack Obama chose THIS man, Joe Biden, to be his VP.
Not on my wish list, but she is definitely qualified and I will vote Biden, whomever he picks.
Omg what an incredible piece. I thank you for it and can honestly say I have never been MORE for Joe Biden as our President, than I am right now. Still crying as I type.
Is this why to felt you and Biden could illegally use the fisa courts against our current president? And Obama works to keep those old race wounds festering - rather then working towards peace.
Great! I wouldn't want to see that vile man at Biden's inauguration!

Democrats know he's a turd so their new campaign is they hate Trump so much they'll "Settle for Biden."
Biden should choose Obama for his VP.
LMAO don't want to talk about any of the criminal issues Obama had? How about Biden getting his son out of trouble not once but twice in Ukraine? Why is Biden under Criminal indictment for the same things you all impeached trump for? I'm curious why the hypocrisy?
Yeah Jonathan or whatever your name is please make sure to apologize to the future president joe Biden for your nonsense.
Not all during any other administration LMAO Like when Obama/Biden paid Iran after they had bounties on American troops? Fast and Furious where the Obama admin was giving guns to drug cartels....shall we continue. Every president has had their shit.
I'll throw in Seminole County. It hasn't gone for a democratic president since Truman in 1948 and Biden will likely need to win it by a few points.
Won't happen, although Biden could crack 400-plus Electoral College votes.
They'll have to lose four election cycles to change, and they won't. They'll fight Biden tooth and nail till the 2022 midterm, lose with whomever they pick in 2024, but likely gain seats in 2026 because Americans have short memories.

If you had to bet on Biden's choice for VP, who would it be?  **Not who you want**  I'm asking for your best guess - predictions not preferences
So when Joe Biden debates Trump and wipes the floor with Trump, what does that mean?  If someone with Dementia out debates you, does that make one stupid, or just inept to lead?  Honest question.

Joe Biden warns that Donald Trump may try to delay November election | Joe Biden | The Guardian
I hope that this is a chance for you to expose even more wrongdoings on behalf of the cabal. Hopefully you will freely mention publicly Valerie Jarrett Barack Obama Joe Biden Comey and the rest. Use it to make a public spectacle of the coup
Biden also supports closing down charter schools and doing away with school choice programs. He is a tool of the Teacher’s Union.  I hope that makes every inner city mom happy to see their children held captive in the under performing public school system.
If Biden wins the election, he only needs to hold the office for 90 days, then he could step down ( due to health reasons) and his female V.P. would automatically step in and become the President. 😳
I think she would do nicely ? Although I hope Biden has chilled his frat boy ways cause she I do not think put up with it.
All these commentators were referring to Biden
Then I guess trump shouldn’t be trying to delegitimize his win, if he’s so confident he can beat Biden.
and before you say smth about biden 1. he has a stutter, 2. i don't support biden

Why on earth would any well informed sensible person vote for Biden? How can you fail to see how hard Trump has fought for the peopleof the USA? Keep sleeping and we will keep fighting to keep the constitution so we keep freedom.
Give me one reason you're voting for Biden without using the word Trump
We will see. People in the media and his fellow colleagues have been saying hes more left now than hes ever been before. Some people can change, and biden will bring about change. Remember hes only going to last one term, so VP is more important tbh
Joe Biden is going to try and refuse to debate Donald Trump. He cannot hold a thought or keep a conversation for more than 30 seconds. He will be a coward and refuse to debate.
Yep. And Donald Trump will win!  A delay would probably benefit the Biden campaign. He will become less and less cognizant and people will have more confidence his VP will take over quickly - that is the strategy on the left, isn’t it?
He wasn’t a Democratic activist. He was kicked out. He hated Biden. He hated BLM, he hated  the Obamas, Clinton’s. That is no Democratic activist. and all his rhetoric is straight out of Trumps playbook.He is a very sick person.
Donald Trump may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the best medicine usually is not the best tasting. Joe Biden is barely a PLACEBO - and whoever his running mate is will be the typical nasty side effects!
Bernie's supporting him, helping election. Biden's the candidate to save our democracy. He has progressive wants in his plan. Do you even know what his plan contains. Bernie people must vote for bernie. Four more years of trump will mean we NEVER have Bernie's vision inplemented.

Me too. I love  But I don’t think Biden is showcasing a joint Biden/Warren fundraiser on the Fri before announcing his VP choice if it’s her. Gotta believe Warren knows it’s not her. This is a Dem “unity” sign &amp; Warren’s a super fundraiser. Do it before she’s not picked.
In other news, Trump has stopped endlessly running those Biden/anarchy &amp; violence ads here in PHX.
Longing for Joe Biden as president.😊
And neither is Biden!
NAFTA, crime bill, Iraq war, Patriot Act.Trump isn’t good on these things either but he reason he won in 2016 was by opposing those things.All he has to do is remind America who Biden really is and that’s all they should need. Instead they act like they’re running against Bernie
Idk the Trump campaign and his mouthpieces on Fox News really appear to be dropping the ball to me. Nobody who’s been alive more than 10 years seriously believes that Biden is a “radical leftist”. They could focus on Biden’s record of policies he supported that got Trump elected.
But media will immediately give them all a free pass.

Hope everyone young and old understands not voting or voting for anyone other than Biden is giving the vote to Bunker Boy and we can’t do another 4 years!!!!
Ultimately, it's going to come down to either it backfires and governors/GOP turns on Trump to save their hides (which likely still costs them all the election if even 25% of Trumpists don't vote at all) or the military personally escorts Trump out of the WH, legitimize Biden.
What the f*** new source are you watching Joe Biden proudly declared that he would defund the police. just as the rest of the democratic party has cloudly declared to defend the police and when asked about it they said no not move money out of the police completely defund
Nobody suggests leaving a fascist in office. We suggest not helping Republicans install a different one in Biden whom they prefer to Trump.

I wonder if Obama would be pro vote by mail if the Postal Union had endorsed Trump and not Biden?
Why didn't Joe Biden leave his basement to go to John Lewis' funeral? Was it because he has been a lifelong advocate for segregation and racist policies?
Fun fact: if an election isn't held by January 2021, Constitutionally speaking, both his and Pence's terms are up and the presidency falls to a Dem (i.e. Pelosi or, if she loses, Pat Leahy in the Senate). So effectively, if he does it, he screws up worse than just losing to Biden
Typical biden rally numbers, I'd say.  😂

Biden; Libya, Yemen, Syria literally sold us out to China  Trump: doing nothing in Libya, tried to pull troops out of Syria ? Attempted to make America more self reliant from China  Keep in mind the major role of the president is foreign policy and trade.
I know, it really makes me nervous.  Poor "President Biden" will have one hell of a mess to clean up but I have faith he and the true experts he'll fill his cabinet with will make a really good run at it!

Just turned on John Lewis’s memorial and I kid you not, this guy said that Lewis’s dying wish was that y’all get out and vote [for Biden, obvs] then he read the 1 Cor love passage and said “John Lewis IS love”.   Don’t tell me wokeness isn’t a religion.
Lets face it, the next six months will be hell on earth until Biden is sworn in.  trump and the  will do everything in their power to totally and thoroughly screw this country out of pure retribution!
All of u libs are banking on Biden?? That tells me everything I need to know. I will not be able to stop laughing on November 4 when Trump wins his second term
The election is not looking good for Biden
Foolish is the mediocre mind. The more you speak you explain why Biden is the choice.
With that being the case, I encourage you all to consider that even if Yang doesn’t win in 2024 as a Biden challenger, a Biden vote this year will still be worth it to prevent death &amp; destruction  That’s assuming Pres Biden doesn’t do ANYTHING productive other than keep the peace
I remember that autopsy. And then I saw them thrown out the window. Just odd to work hard to figure out Republicans party issues and then ignore them- and actually do the opposite of recommendations. Pete- so glad to “know” you. Hoping you have a big part in Biden Admin. ❤️

You are correct. It could have been worse if Joe Biden was in office. He wouldn’t have closed down China. Imagine the devastation that would have caused? Thank goodness he wasn’t President!
Those of us who hate him are smarter than he thinks we are.  We'll be there to vote for Biden one way or another.

No I don't find Biden wanting a female vice president sexist. By your logic I can say that every president that we've had is sexist becauce they didn't want a female vice president but I don't because it's their choice. Yes, I think that the most qualified should get the VC post-

No bet. He's a target rich opportunity for Biden. Yet Biden is doing well by watching and letting Mr. Trump do his thing  One stupid attack after another.
Yet it doesn’t even faze you that China has done more hacking recently than any other country. Or is it that you can’t say that because Biden is tied to China just as deep as Trump to Russia and this would hurt the Dems chances in Nov?

Joe Biden himself is a huge part of the problem, let’s not forget. The dude is a fucking square, that airhead nigga don’t care about any of us any more than Trump does and I truly believe that
They always talk out of both sides of their mouths. They are critical because they say Biden is hiding and not talking and not the are saying he is talking. Which is it because it cannot be both.
. we’re picturing you not in attendance at Biden’s inauguration, but splayed out across and clinging to the Oval Office desk. “No! NO! You can’t make me leave! MITCH! NRA! SOMEBODY!! *sob* NO! I’m NOT going! MINE! *sob* Noooooo!”
If you can show me a study that says a 200mg dose has high risk of side effects, I will vote for Biden.  The studies that show it does harm are when you are given a massive overdose of the drug. Like 1400mg in 24 hours.  Why do you want Americans to die?

Don't underestimate how important the Senate is for the GOP.  Whether or not Trump wins, keeping control of the Senate is vitally important, either as a way to keep President  agenda going or as a check on Biden's far-left policies.

Concede to Biden - make this easy
On March 3, 2020, after Xi Jinping was named President for life, Trump said "maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day."     On April 24, 2020, Biden said " “Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow"  Today is someday.
Meanwhile in the real world, Biden raised 20 million for rioters bail. Not a single cent for all the black owned business's they destroyed. What's in the dems bill? Billions for China?
It’s Thursday. #Biden will say anything the prepared text says.

Biden will have full authority to treat Trump as a trespasser who can be removed by whatever means necessary, including the use of deadly force if it comes to that.

Of course you want to delay the election; you are polling as one one of the worst Presidents. Biden is taking states that have voted red for decades. You are going to be trounced. Worse then Carter in 1980 and Ducakus in 1988. America wants to savor your embarrassment.
The virus is doing a better job running against him than Biden is....
And some people have the nerve to say Biden is not with it. He knows this man. We all do.  96 days!!!
Get it registered to vote for Biden.
Such an order would surely be challenged in court, and it’s inconceivable that the Supreme Court would uphold such a blatantly unconstitutional act.
The election date is set in law; Trump cannot change it without Congress’s consent. The election itself is run by the states, not the federal government, so there’s no bureaucracy Trump could corral to implement any order delaying the vote.
They aren’t BLM they are your supporters making this align with your failed Joe Biden Defund the police videos which are NOT TRUE those anarchists are TRUMP supporters. AMERICA DO NOT BE FOOLED
Trump didn’t create these problems. And Joe Biden, who I will vote for, isn’t going to fix them.
So, Trump is trying to start a groundswell to put off an election where polls show him way behind Joe Biden. The claims of voter fraud have no foundation...
Hahaha. No. Take a look at dudes social media. He despises the Democratic Party buddy. He’s bat shit crazy and believes he is married to Ivanka and that she is carrying his daughter. Hates Biden.

the dems are giving away the country for personal gain. The system is broken. It’s not going to get better with Biden in office and letting the more deceptive party run things. It’s not happening with Biden. Have to rely on the Republicans to keep trump in line.

Yeah? Well he is a Trump fan,who thinks he is married to Ivanka hates BLM,and wants to protect Trump.He hates the Obamas and  suck on it. He is a Trump inspired mental case.
thing on Biden is he's been in high level politics for NEARLY 50 years.  Hes been chairman of everything.  dots history all over place.  He seems like guy that has an idea what he wants to do and the larger context of the moment.
this is true.  Biden is really striking a lot of good notes right now.  Maintaining moderacy while bringing in liberals and disaffected GOP.  Stepped up by wearing mask in public first.  Very aggressive green policies.  Not overplaying BLM noise.  letting Trump destroy self.

Joe said President Trump is the first racist president we’ve ever had. Yet we have brat children running around the country tearing down statues claiming our country is racist from its inception. Joe Biden giving the eulogy of Robert KKK Byrd and McGovern the Premier racist..
Huh... that’s great that you don’t hate people that disagree with you neither do I. I’m simply pointing out watching the interview ..I have an opinion. Joe Biden was strange. And then he disappeared came back. You have to admit he’s a little off..If US postal system hamstrung by Trump to suppress vote, setup an alternative way to send in by allowing voters to take picture front and back of their completed ballots and text or email them in.

this is priceless.  Epstein partied with Bill Clinton...  and to think I was positive that  it was JOE BIDEN who was running   against donny
Let's let VP Biden make the choice. He will have to work with that person. Get off his back...he has a darn tough job ahead of him. Just give it a rest.
I'm sure at least you would help out Obama if he was in this situation cause you know it all right Joe!...yeah I'm talking to you ..that's your name .It's Joe Biden...that's you ..Joe.
Why oh why do democrats eat their own? ANY woman Biden picks will be fine. They are ALL excellent. Plus...they will be debating a Qtip.
Oh they will accept it. We've had to accept the criminal in the WH for four years. We are going to follow the law. Let's make that loud and clear. When trump loses, the military steps in  Poll: Most Trump voters say they won't accept results if Biden wins
Also, Biden will bring that by himself. Susan Rice is the only one who covers your points - and they aren't the most important. And, again, Biden covers rebuilding ally's trust all by himself.
Last time was Biden. He told Obama he would not be running. But I'm not holding that against him now because he was the consensus candidate who can beat Trump.
Really not though. Biden became VP partly because he told Obama he'd have to Presidential ambitions - or none that would interfere for 8 years. They did well.
Where's hunter Biden?

This is a LIE - Does he ever provide details on the internal polls? It is probably just his family &amp; Stephen Miller, 100% Trump, none of them want Biden
🤔 you’re sounding a lot like bumbling Biden these days. Might want to check your meds, something is definitely off.
These men are afraid Kamala Harris will challenge the white male stranglehold on politics, and it's exactly why Biden should pick Harris. White men had their shot and they've damn near destroyed the republic. Go play golf, Ed, your time is over.

Good grief,  please cut the sexist crap. ALL presidential candidates and former candidates have a sizable ego... as do you. Was Biden a bad VP because he eventually ran for president himself... a third time? Or was that okay because he’s a man?
And we are still in Iraq. Biden voted and supported the Iraq war for years. Same with Afghanistan war. Dems and Republicans are equally responsible. Let's not forget who put Trump there, the Dems.
I have no idea who that is. I’m not saying the guys good, don’t confuse that. I just don’t think Biden by any means is a savior
I really don’t think he’s much better, before covid im not sure there’s anything Trump was doing to run the country into the ground. One thing Biden would be better at is uniting the country over racial injustice.
Is Biden better? They both suck. How have we came to this? Best thing Is that corna keeps up so Biden doesn’t have to debate, you know that. I just don’t understand how these are the two candidates. It’s crazy
Not sold on IA or MT electing Democratic Senators while also voting for Trump. If anything you'd see split ticketing the other way, a vote for Biden but a Republican Senate as a check.
Biden was partly or mostly behind:  Crime bill, bankruptcy bill, police militarization, Iraq War, coups in Latin America, etc...  I don't support Trump nor Biden   I have great issues with someone xenophobically pushing the debunked russiagate instead of focusing on real issues.

FACT CHECK:  Biden did not explicitly tie xenophobia to the travel restriction. His tweet reflects coronavirus remarks he made during a campaign stop in Iowa Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced.
FACT CHECK:  Biden tweeted: "We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump's record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency."
Chicken little speaking again, don’t worry you will lose to Biden
You may not personally like trump but can upu see biden taking on the chinese, iraq or Russia?  Get ready for taxes to skyrocket...... just know what you are voting for
Biden can’t help it.  He’s sick
Can we all admit that all the people who should run for president are too smart to run? There’s no way Biden or Trump should be president. We are so screwed

Some men create, some men destroy. Trump is a destroyer. Biden is a creater.
We saw how the October surprise strategy turned for access Hollywood and trump. At least on the scandal / ethics  front, joe Biden is in better shape than Hillary.
You would think if the trump team or the media or the ‘Russians’ have some dirt on biden roll out they would have by now to create that drumbeat unless they put all marbles on October surprise.
He’s too old and out of it? Hunter Biden hasn’t really caught on ? Biden has not shown up in the #JeffreyEpsteindidntkillhimself #GhislaineMaxwell stuff. The Bernie crowd doesn’t hate Biden like they did Clinton and her surrogates.
So kind of like Biden 😂😂😂
Biden could pick a flower for all I care I'll STILL VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO
That’s hilarious 😂 especially when Biden’s slogan is I chose “truth over facts”
Because that *is* the Democratic Party. It’s racist, sexist and homophobic. That’s why Biden is the candidate. So many better to pick from but we were told Dems wouldn’t vote for anyone other than a white man.  Huge disappointment in the party beginning in 2016.
That wasn't a eulogy. That was a desperate cry for help to elect Biden because they are all f*cked.
Actually neither. Who Biden picks as his VEEP isn't going to change my vote. Joe could pick his imaginary friend from his early childhood as VEEP, I'd still vote for him. 🇺🇸💙🌊
Maybe when Biden gets in office our country will have the political will to try at least?
No President has been comparable to a fascist dictator...until today's attempt to postpone an election (was not even done in Civil War...)  #No.  Reality gives you a binary choice:  Biden &amp; Democracy or Trump &amp; Authoritarianism.  Sadly, it is this black-and-white
Trump can’t fuck off too but I would rather have Trump over Biden 10x over
It could, we will see that would mean Biden would have to win. With his voting record he doesn't have the backing the media is claiming.
And that fact that people think we only have Trump and Biden to choose from LUL
People really think Biden is better then Trump.
I heard you say that Biden's comments on the breakfast club got you upset. I am so happy to hear that. For a minute, I was wondering how could he say such things with out consequence.
Well he only got 7-8% of the black vote in 2016 and won. He has done more for blacks than Obama / Biden so he should get 15-20% of the black vote this time. If he does, he will win by a landslide
This is like the 14th time I've done this to  or   The time to complain about Biden is after change of occupant at 1600 Penn. Ave.  There are more people than just you making sacrifices to vote. #JohnLewis  Squeaker=#Fail - has to be a blowout. 🚫Selfish
Want to energize independents and conservatives in the United States then have Obama campaign for Biden! #Trump2020
You supported the woman who came forward against Biden? #Hypocrite #redskins #racistblackface #whostheboss #youtoo #
This is true.  Anyone supporting Democrats or their policies is by definition a racist and dishonest.  First time voters need to do some serious research... #Biden2020 #Biden2020Landslide #JoeBidenForPresident2020 #JoeBiden #biden #dnc #cnn #cbs #nbc #Democrat #PelosiMustGo
Can we get None Trump supporting Republicans to just not cast a vote November 3rd if they won’t cast one for Biden? Who’s Lying?
Biden’s America...
Who the f knows? You and I know Biden should be toast but WTF!
That’s ok Biden will bring it back and better and Trump won’t be able to do a damn thing out of office but take his upside down Bible and his form of Christianity which is none and pry for the courts to not prosecute his Demonic sex offender ass! Who’s Lying?
For me we’re effed either way. Biden and trump are both terrible leaders.  I’m going trump because I can’t pay more taxes, support for law enforcement, and fighting against political correct bullshit, Which covers a lot of areas.    Biden is about to make a horrible Vp choice.
On first glance, and not looking properly, I wondered why Joe Biden was tweeting a picture of Elton John
Number one, what about the other 44% who aren't ready for schools to reopen, prob because they don't think its safe?   And how many of your 56% only want schools to open if they know it's safe?   Biden cares about our children, Trump does not. Trump only cares about the optics.
Biden is not competent. His running mate will be President. He certainly is not going to do anything more for people now that his dementia is worsening. It is sad how they are using the sick old man who has given so much of his life to this country.
WOW O.0 o.0 O.o so many reasons for impeachment. Our system, more than just Congress, is now broken. Needs repair. Needs not-Trump. Needs Biden.
I would crawl through a river of shit like Andy Dufresne to vote for Mark Kelly &amp; Joe Biden even if the polls showed them ahead 99% to 1%.  They all need to be humiliated.  Not just defeated.
It was perfect... in every way. And a reminder of just how much is at stake on November 3. We can choose Trumps America, that is filled with cruelty, racism, hate and division, or an Obama/Lewis/Biden America, that is filled with love, unity, equality and hope.
If Biden gets elected the barrier comes down and free everything for illegal immigrants.
Poll: Gen Z Democrats say Trump is swamping Biden in digital ads   We must change this.   what are we doing on this? #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt  it does!
I hate communism! Trump is for freedom, Biden is not.
No. Because a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for trump.
#Biden says he will be selecting a female VP, a move many assumed was pandering to the ladyfolk. But it's actually a brilliant move, according to top analysts, since the move will save taxpayers almost 30% on the VPs salary.  #BidenLandslide2020 #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Wonder where Joe Biden gets his apology.
The problem of Don is far greater ... hugely far greater ... then the Biden VP pic... If the VP pic moves the needle with respect to their vote...  I’m shaming you NOW!👇👇👇 Don must be removed regardless!
Intel Dems press Nunes for details on anti-Biden package from Ukrainian official  via
He is under Ukranian criminal indictment right now. Also can you explain to me why the push for racial equality would pick a man like biden who authored the 1994 crime bill?
Not on my wish list, but she is definitely qualified and I will vote Biden, whomever he picks.
LMAO don't want to talk about any of the criminal issues Obama had? How about Biden getting his son out of trouble not once but twice in Ukraine? Why is Biden under Criminal indictment for the same things you all impeached trump for? I'm curious why the hypocrisy?
Yeah Jonathan or whatever your name is please make sure to apologize to the future president joe Biden for your nonsense.
Not all during any other administration LMAO Like when Obama/Biden paid Iran after they had bounties on American troops? Fast and Furious where the Obama admin was giving guns to drug cartels....shall we continue. Every president has had their shit.
I'll throw in Seminole County. It hasn't gone for a democratic president since Truman in 1948 and Biden will likely need to win it by a few points.
Now do Joe Biden
Karen, Biden would have stoped it, right??
Seems over a decade too late to me. How sincere can he actually be. Would he call for this if Biden won the election?
Without, because my main assumption is that Buttigieg wouldn't have dropped out if Biden or Sanders weren't there, and therefore nobody else would probably want to drop out.
Calling out to the great state of Texas: we ask you to vote for Joe Biden this November to kick trump out. 💙🌊
Joe Biden warns that Donald Trump may try to delay November election | Joe Biden | The Guardian
Biden also supports closing down charter schools and doing away with school choice programs. He is a tool of the Teacher’s Union.  I hope that makes every inner city mom happy to see their children held captive in the under performing public school system.
I think she would do nicely ? Although I hope Biden has chilled his frat boy ways cause she I do not think put up with it.
All these commentators were referring to Biden
#WE WILL VOTE -I am voting by mail in voting in AZ it is allowed. Already sent my vote in for the Preliminary voting and I will vote for Biden.

Biden won the primaries:(
Biden/Harris ticket is a winner for sure!!! Excited to cast my vote. I will stand in line, in a bikini, for 7 days in 10 feet of snow if needs be to return unity and civility to our country.
That fake Southern preacher vocal... That huge crowd of attendees... That free televised speech for all to see... That mail-in ballot voter suppression pitch... That former president Barry stumping for Basement Biden...  oh wait, this is a eulogy at a funeral... my mistake.
Fun fact: if an election isn't held by January 2021, Constitutionally speaking, both his and Pence's terms are up and the presidency falls to a Dem (i.e. Pelosi or, if she loses, Pat Leahy in the Senate). So effectively, if he does it, he screws up worse than just losing to Biden
Typical biden rally numbers, I'd say.  😂
I agree.Personally I want Elizabeth Warren as VP but to be honest, at this point I’m voting for a rock over trump.Also, I will vote for Biden/Harris.But I also know, they are just stop gap for the next four years.I know they won’t get re-elected but getting trump out is the goal
I not having a President for the last 4 years but that will all change on November 3rd when we will elect President Joe Biden.
Given how soft spoken and easy going Biden is I personally think Harris would be a great match for him.  Because he has one heck of a mess to clean up and will need a courageous woman in there. But I’m voting Biden even if he runs with Brittany Spears.
#cnn #morningjoe #Biden I just miss the legendary President Obama so much!! I truly love the man, love his intelligence and statesmanship etc etc etc ,,the nation now more then ever begs for a true leader
You are a huge Biden supporter I can tell.
Hope the Biden campaign will snap her up
I know, it really makes me nervous.  Poor "President Biden" will have one hell of a mess to clean up but I have faith he and the true experts he'll fill his cabinet with will make a really good run at it!
Lets face it, the next six months will be hell on earth until Biden is sworn in.  trump and the  will do everything in their power to totally and thoroughly screw this country out of pure retribution!
All of u libs are banking on Biden?? That tells me everything I need to know. I will not be able to stop laughing on November 4 when Trump wins his second term
Foolish is the mediocre mind. The more you speak you explain why Biden is the choice.
“Be brave. Be courageous.”  Today I signed up to be an Election Worker in our beautiful welcoming diverse state of Arizona &amp; send prayers to my beautiful Silver state of Birth Nevada    FiveThirtyEight Polls  AZ Biden   46%  Trump.  38%  NV Biden   49%  Trump  45%
So Trump has accomplished more in most 24 hour period than Biden in 47 years lol thanks for making my point
Biden leading by like 2 in Arizona (I'm from there) is believable.  Arizona is gonna decide the election if you ask me.
Man imagine this guy running instead of Biden... 😔
No bet. He's a target rich opportunity for Biden. Yet Biden is doing well by watching and letting Mr. Trump do his thing  One stupid attack after another.
Yet it doesn’t even faze you that China has done more hacking recently than any other country. Or is it that you can’t say that because Biden is tied to China just as deep as Trump to Russia and this would hurt the Dems chances in Nov?
#WeWillVote Joe Biden! Vote Blue no matter who!!
I wish. You really think Biden will win the popularity contest? HAHAHA Bernie my boy you should be pissed.  Robbed twice in a row.
YES. Never knew Biden was the second coming until or after listening to my FAKE ERRONEOUS responses!
Joe Biden himself is a huge part of the problem, let’s not forget. The dude is a fucking square, that airhead nigga don’t care about any of us any more than Trump does and I truly believe that
They always talk out of both sides of their mouths. They are critical because they say Biden is hiding and not talking and not the are saying he is talking. Which is it because it cannot be both.
Let’s elect Biden first - everyone needs to vote. Then let the Secret Service decide how to remove him.
I will vote in November - by mail (as usual) or in person if necessary - for Joe Biden. #WeWillVote
Yes.  I hope you’ll be Biden’s VP pick.
I think we should it on Election Day. Those Biden commercials causing nausea.
On March 3, 2020, after Xi Jinping was named President for life, Trump said "maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day."     On April 24, 2020, Biden said " “Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow"  Today is someday.
The war of words will get going as we get closer to November 3rd   Good. Trump's alligator mouth is Biden's best supporter.
Biden doesn't even know what time it is. Dude has dementia and you're complaining about Trump? That's rich.
The Constitution sets the election date - not the President.
Of course you want to delay the election; you are polling as one one of the worst Presidents. Biden is taking states that have voted red for decades. You are going to be trounced. Worse then Carter in 1980 and Ducakus in 1988. America wants to savor your embarrassment.
The virus is doing a better job running against him than Biden is....
Republican,voting for Biden, AZ
Biden will get a VOTE PARADE
Oh yeah well if Biden is so great why didn’t he give Obama any advise while he was Vice President. Go put your mask back on and shut up😷🤐
Let me guess if Biden wins the election the COVID pandemic will suddenly disappear, teachers will have no problem going back to teaching, the riots will suddenly end, and this drug will suddenly be approved for use. Tell me again how this isn’t political?
ridiculous rape enabling. educate yourself about biden’s decades of lies.
Enable rape much?
Biden will kill this.
No, Trump doesn't need foreign helps, but he knows Biden and his son were corrupt and that's the reason that American government needs to find out.
The do-nothing democrats and Joe Biden would implement policies that would sacrifice our great american pastime: eating whole onions. I will not stand for an America where I can't have my onions. #trump2020 #WakeUpAmerica 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Biden is -150 to -170. According to Twitter he should be -1550. Shows you the reality compared to Twitter. If I see Biden at -130 I'm going big
What we do have to worry about, is if trump loses, all the damage he can do before Joe Biden's inauguration.
Fuck no I didn't want him on the ticket! I was a #mamaforkamala before I was in it for #warren. Guess who both of them support? Joe Biden
I can’t wait until  is UNLEASHED in this campaign!  I wanted her to be POTUS, I want her to be Biden’s VP, and I want her to become POTUS after Biden.
I never said he wasn't disgusting for this exact reason 🤣 just because I claim Biden is a pedo POS doesn't mean I'm pro-Trump. These are the times we live in. Get a grip 😚
Dear Sexists: Biden promsided he’d pick “a woman” as his running mate. And while that statement is problematic in its own right, he is going to follow through. “Ugh, but not THAT woman” is NOT a good response, and won’t make him pick a man instead. Fuck all the way off.
Only 3 of my friends have declared for DJT and 2 "friends" like Biden... I already removed the idiot from Australia who thinks because he's in media that he knows the truth about Trump.
They're probably going to have a lot of influence in a Biden administration, at the very least. I'd be amazed if we didn't see a few cabinet-level positions go to people who are aligned with Lincoln Project.
it begins to look like Biden may not be the only one with dementia...she seems to really be slipping
Ask pedophile biden and Killary, their Pedowoods friends know too!
Biden ain't wrong.
Trump +3 &lt;--&gt; Biden +3
Biden isn’t the nominee yet and the man has a simple choice - back #MedicareForAll or lose the votes of people who are demanding that we the most wealthy and powerful nation in history catch up to where almost all other developed countries were *decades* ago.
How bout Biden logo nose clips?
I think more democrats vote for Trump,  then Republicans vote for Biden
Probably getting Biden over the finish line.  I don't have faith that any criminal charge will be brought, except maybe  some lower level players.  Looks like there is no justice in the Justice Dept., swamp running the FBI, Deep State at CIA and State Dept.
Conversation today with a republican- all dems want to defund the police. Bear in mind this was a unemotional conversation. But in the end, he would not acknowledge the fact Biden does NOT want to defund the police. It’s nuts.
Found him a running mate. Biden/Cosby 2020
How is Joe Biden fucking up what is possibly the most softball election he could of asked for?
Uh huh...name one thing Beijing Biden has done that’s been good for our country in 47 years in politics?
If Biden wins, WE ARE ALL FUCKED js
Can we all collectively agree to learn this and set a time to do this once we’ve locked in a Biden win and thrown Trump and his cronies to the curb?
Something else to point out is the fact that Iran has always had bounties on US troops, and Obama/Biden gave them how much money? They had their top general on the ground in Iraq planning attacks. Give me a break here with the spin.
Trump already ended those jobs with his world wide recession. Remember just a while ago when oil prices crashed? Remember? That was your lot. Best way to help the oil industry is to elect Joe Biden.

Today, President Trump is openly promoting segregation, but go ahead and tell me that you can’t vote for Joe Biden.
God will listen. Before you go to bed, ask God for guidance, ask him to let you know who is better for a free America, Trump or Biden!
Did I hear correctly?  If Biden is elected he wants money to assist blacks, latinos, aisans and native Americans.  Isn't that what you would call RACIST, when you exclude a specific group based on their race, gender or sexual orientation😳
Also, Joe Biden is unable to do either now also. Not a better choice.
That’s not a bad thing. Biden is aging.
If he is so weak, why you trying to tear him down with your rhetoric. Sounds like Biden again to me.

How can anyone at the   take this poor, confused, and befuddled man seriously. Surely they don't think they're fooling anyone that Kamala Harris won't be president within 90 days if they win, which I doubt will happen.   via
Don’t worry Biden will untuck all that Trump is fucking up!
Oh look - a female candidate being deemed "too ambitious."  - the sexism is right on time
I guarantee it, watch if Biden wins all these people are going to sit back down and start raising up their RBG Flags. Anyone who was gullible enough to fall for this bullsh*t is either politically naive or is prone to cult like feel good rhetoric making them dangerous individuals
If Biden wins this ADOS/FBA shit is gonna be a thing of past. Black Americans getting scammed by people who move with the political tides that white people in this country set into action. There is no FBA/ADOS without a far right wing President being in office.
Biden's biggest concern is loyalty and ushering in the new Democratic party, which he named Buttigieg in, under his beliefs.   Biden only wants loyalty and tokenism. This is how the first female president will potentially be chosen and it's disgusting.
Wow, what an incredibly dumb thing to say. We actually had a really good chance when Biden was VP. We recovered from a huge recession that happened during an irresponsible president’s term. Time to do it again. #Biden2020 #DumpTrump
CNN polled me two weeks ago. I never knew Biden was so brilliant, mature, wise.
Dear Germany,   We'll be back in January. Please hang in there.   Love,  Biden's America
Many Independents plead with Biden not to select Harris as VP or they will abandon their support for him.
We don’t kneel to the mob demolition rat! Your  “Don’t talk down Joe Biden” or else bullshit! We aren’t scared of the radical left demolition rat party! Lol You’re going to find out just what we think about you lefty lunatics on Nov 3rd, 2020 AGAIN!
💯%   They are always completely coordinated, completely on task. And while we are complaining about decorum and fairness, they are shouting derogatory language and campaign slogans for Joe Biden that make the front page of every MSM news outlet.
Looks like she. I have a feeling she is Biden's Vp. Hope I'm wrong
Biden just wants to ride that Camel cause he’s heard the rumors 😝
You talking about Biden I thought he finished second to last?
There are three things that are certain in life. Death, taxes and Joe Biden is not debating Donald Trump.
Biden wants the first potential woman president on 2 conditions (1) loyalty to him and his causes and (2) what may help him get votes.   That's it. Not who they are. Not what they stand for.   Absolutely fucking disgusting.
Ya that was all stupid - never jump to conclusions. That’s why I was waiting to pronounce judgement. It literally could have been anyone. But there was a line in time when he went from a volunteer to - hating Biden, slugocki, rottelini, and thinking Ivanka was his wife
Ya... but he clearly went over to the deranged side with Ivanka as his wife and trump love and Biden hate some time back.
Biden is a puppet for the Democrat leftists.
Biden will be soft on rioters and soft on policing.
Biden could give a 2 hour press conference where he slurs all his words, shits his pants and then lays down to take a nap on stage and I would still vote for him over Trump. That’s where we are. No amount of pointing out his cognitive decline will matter.
That’s how bad your dad is. I would vote for Biden in a coma before I would vote for your dad.
Please... everyone stop calling Biden progressive....
Maybe you’ll realize that the railroad owns the bridge and has nothing to do with Biden or Trump.
He also refused to go after Biden and went against surrogates who did (which Biden used, in Zephyrs case, in an anti Bernie ad)
The only ones that win in a class action lawsuit are the lawyers.
I’ve got a bad feeling we’re going Biden here in AZ
I think they stick with Biden and it will basically come down to Trump vs. Biden’s VP.  Biden is and always has been a horrible presidential candidate.
Nobody huh? 80 million will vote to re-elect him. How many you think Beijing Biden the racist senator from 1960-2000’s will get demolition rat?
I miss Michelle and Barack Obama. They’re such intelligent positive voices who care about people. #PresidentBiden and Dr. Jill Biden will be the same. I can’t wait to rebuild America, Unify and feel normal again.
blacks he is paying. The funniest thing about your comment is that you clearly don’t know wtf “bigot” even means! 😂 Get a dictionary bud and stop humiliating yourself. I don’t like Biden and wouldn’t vote for him if I had any other Democratic choice but I would vote for a
And then you realized it was actually Biden driving
Agreed I’m still not a fan of Biden but o think he recognizes the popularity of Bernie, AOC, Ohmar, etc and will listen
Who is Joe Biden? Isn’t he that racist senator from the 60’s 70’s 80’s 90’s and 2000’s?
I'm looking forward to Biden undoing everything from your disgraceful time squatting in the Oval.
These are all closer to what I'd expect the actual results to be than the wider spread polls that others have. I don't believe the Michigan Biden+10 type numbers.
Yep because Joe Biden doesn’t even know he’s Joe Biden. Dementia is going into Alzheimer’s.
What’s Biden going to do about China’s decision making
I would rather a president who doesn’t know his intentions than one who does and those intentions are evil. No brainer! The reality is, Dems aren’t greedy mother fuckers that look the other way for personal gain. I know that if Biden is incompetent in his roll as POTUS,
This is what Biden's courageous Americans do to real Americans.
Nope, super humble and blessed.  Hard work creates the American dream.  No need to feel sorry.  Not ruffled, I find this quite fun.  It's important.  Biden will most likely lose, because he is not capable... If he does, are you going to be upset for 4 more years?
Something is wrong with Biden and we deserve to know!!!
That’s stupid trump ad that propaganda nonsense of defunding the police, that if you elect Biden, there will be no police only runs in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina.
Biden grosses me out, but at least he’s not BFF’s with a known child sex trafficker and doesn’t call other known child sex traffickers as “very good people”. He also been accused of sexual misconduct 8 times in comparison to the 25 times that trump has.  You really need to find
Well sorry, Bernie.  You would have my vote but the DNC has assured victory for Trump in the coming election.  Biden, compared to Trump, is unfit for duty mentally, which is just pathetic.  They must not have learned with Hillary, OR they actually want to sabotage the election.
This makes my stomach hurt. A man with so much “cool” his slobbering fans dismiss his bigoted views on Israel. May we never see the days of his disdain for Israel again.  Wish Biden had a spine.
I don’t like Biden at all but if it comes down to him or Trump, it’s a no brainer! I’d rather have an inept president with good intentions than an inept president with evil ones.
You realize trump isn't the only one with power in government to fix prevailing as she is in the system these politicians have been in office for decades but blame someone who's only spent 3 years In politics  Joe Biden is a documented racist but go off...
Omg that is funny Biden is a loser
Biden is as far left as you are a Patriot.  It doesn't fit.
We try to chose the less evil, for me that is Trump.  Trump has been investigated to the hilt. Biden on the other hand has not. Which is a concern. Like many has said, of all that ran, Biden was more likable, but he’s not the real problem, who will he chose as VP?
I would trade Joe Biden “turmoil”for Trump turmoil every day of the week and twice on Sundays.

So tell me again what Biden had done for this country and our tax paying citizens? Go on... I'll wait for your response...
He’s getting senile like Biden is.
Just wait. It's coming out.. More stuff about Obama, Biden, Hillary. Also if you look at the logic side of it, it shouldn't be Trump discovering it but an unbiased person or persons. Do your hard research, not just watch Fake News CNN who wants people to life in fear! #Trump2020

Trump has never had a plan for anything. If you remember in 2016 his only agenda was build a wall, gut ACA, and degrade other people. He could never talk policy the way Biden is doing.
Can you imagine if Trump only did press conferences with pre selected questions. Yet that’s the only thing Biden does and not a peep from MSM
Joe Biden checklist for November: 1. Visit Wisconsin a couple times in the next few months. 2. Don’t say I’m reclaiming my time at debates (if there are any). 3. Don’t have emails show up on Carlos Danger’s laptop. 4. And remember it is #personwomanmancameratv
Gas-lighters for Biden
There are 3 that are scheduled.  My concern is that we can't have CNN, MSNBC, and other leftest be there asking questions and then supporting Biden like they did the last election with Killary.
Biden is the synthesis of Obama and Trump
If neither Bernie or Biden ran, I bet Buttigieg would’ve won
When I heard that I was applauding because this needs to be taken seriously.  Obama, Biden, and all of them that unmasked and attempted the fail coup need to be held accountable!

So the threat is, riots end if we vote for Biden? Is that what you’re saying? I want to be sure I understand how the threat is being leveled.
Biden and his cronies suck.
Great.  Dems and Biden get to experience their "Defunding" first hand.
Trump will be voted out soon so no need to start impeachment on Barr at this point. Once Trump gone, Biden will remove Barr!
Biden and his media/cronies are Bad for US.  Don't believe a word anyone of them says - it's all misinformation, construed facts or just fiction.
If Biden gets elected and Beto does what he says he will you think we’ve had violence recently just see what happens when law abiding gun owners like me become criminals #frommycolddeadfingers
Joe Biden May have the same problems it’s the health of our economy
Or maybe Biden can slide on that public appearance because the "police" won't work.

Ugh. As a fan of Warren’s, this nonsense pisses me off. I’m excited to vote for Biden, whoever his VP pick is!
81 Facebook friends have like Trumps page, 2 For Biden!   In Washington State!!!
I’m writing her name on the ticket since joe Biden has dementia
Biden's secret service nickname is "Redshirt."
Everything you just said is wrong.  Stop being part of the problem.  Biden needs to pick the best/most qualified person for the position.  Haven’t you learned anything from trumps failures?
Cage match! #trump vs #biden  I want it on Television these guys need to debate! #SleepyJoe  will get a folding chair in his back! #Trump2020Landslide
Alls I know is at this point everyone needs to be stuffing money in Joe Biden’s pants like thier life depends on it. Because IT DOES.
Remember when Biden came out of his basement and finally answered some softball questions and still fucked it up?
Biden is a train wreck..
Senator Mark Kelly we have your back just like President Biden and we’re taking you both all the way to the WH.
YES, PLEASE... we can't afford to sit this one out. BITE YOUR TONGUE &amp; VOTE BIDEN/WHOEVER2020
When Biden announces his running mate next week, I'm not saying boo even if I disagree with who it is. Trump is banking on that discord, and I refuse to give it him.   After the election, though? Expect me to be unhinged.
I already indicated a NO on Rice. I remember seeing tons of news on Benghazi from GOP perspective 🤦🏼‍♀️ they would definitely go after her. Sides, she has no experience governing. The Woke is a problem and unless Biden opposes, it’s a win for CJ. Schools can open safely if have 💵
Educated but still using the wrong “their” lol let’s just say we’re voting against Biden on policies. IDC if trump ran or not I’d vote against Biden for his beliefs and policies...
Disagree.  I guess you didn't see his press conference earlier today.  Biden doesn't need a script or notes and can speak extemporaneously, unlike Trump.   You are projecting exactly what the GOP does but that's nothing new.
Thousand Mile glazed-eyed gaze. Basement Biden is clearly being medicated to assist him in trying to get through these highly controlled, orchestrated,  faux press conferences. His handlers freaking the eff out when Bumbling Biden goes off script.
Waiting for Biden to use yangs policies
you started this divisiveness in our Great Country under  administration. Our Great President  inherited nothing but garbage. #BLM started under your watch. Suck it up Joe, admit your faults.
With Biden, "Nothing will fundamentally change" and America will keep swirling the drain continuing the legacies of recent past presidents.  So feckless legislators, no single payer, no end to fracking, no marijuana legalization, etc..  #RejectTheDuopoly
Biden 94 crime bill look it up  He doesn't care about anything supposedly systemically racist he only pretends like he does he is the reason police have become more violent and why more  Minorities are incarcerated but no one is ready have that talk
I’m sick of Trump Enabler Barr’s Lies and Criminality. I’m watching Biden speak right now on CNN. Tune in.
Biden 94 crime bill look it up
For the record I wouldn’t care if Joe Biden was caught snorting coke off a dead pirate’s wooden leg in Motel 6, I’m still voting for him.
Out of no where corporate and private donations went to Black Lives Matter and those funds went to Act Blue which is a funding arm of Democrats. Before the protests, Trump was out raising Biden almost 2 to 1. Since the protests, the tables are turned not by direct donations
Not on the same level. I would never vote for Biden normally, now my first priority is voting trump out. Then we can work on progress.
Biden on Muslim support at the polls-
Biden reportedly called him to ask about his health before this.
I keep saying I'm tired of old, white men in power (and I'm old). This administration has got to be the last of its kind with Joe Biden just getting us back to normal.
Here's a running mate for Biden
These ads are dumb af.  Fuck the police  Fuck biden Fuck trump.
Preview of a possible Biden Presidency - who will be running the show?  Vote them out and vote Biden down!
BLM is NOT supporting Black lives. BLM FUNDS the DS D Party, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden's campaign...all White elitists. This movement has been initiated by the Deep State to Divide and conquer.  #UnitedWeStand #WWG1GWAworldwide
STOP! You are the racist: “1977: Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into ‘a jungle… a racial jungle.’ &amp; “If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black'
understanding/staying current with others you don’t support/have similar beliefs in is paramount in growth as an individual and in your values.   i like all angles on my feed which is why i follow fox &amp; cnn/hillary, biden, trump, and jorgenson/pelosi &amp; mcconnell.
No. No. Not her.  She can't be VP. Biden has a fatal under-age touching match with a 12yr old, and next thing we know, she's running the country? God help us all.
biden is bread in a dishwasher. #replacebiden
No V.P. Biden, not YET but SOON!
Clowns in a circus! #trump2020. #Trump2020LandslideVictory #MAGA2020  Obama and Clooney team up to raise money for Biden
Biden: "Trans rights are human rights." Trump: Tweets white power. Biden: Police need to be reformed. Trump: Gasses peacefully protesting Americans. Biden: Climate change must be addressed. Trump: Global warming is a Chinese hoax.  Idiot Armie Hammer: bOtH siDEs aRe tHe sAmE
But remember guys...the orange man is the enemy. Once Biden is in office everything is going cha....oh, wait...it’s the same damn shit only main stream media will tell you it’s roses
Healthy? Did they allow Biden to hire a stand-in?
Get him off. Gym Jordan makes no sense talking about Obama/Biden.
That advisor has the wrong take.  Biden should be doing what Obama did in 2008, a "50 state strategy".  Try and win every single state.  Campaign hard in every single state.  The difficulty of course being that things can't be in person right now.  But no state should be ignored.
The best video yet! Biden Blue🦾🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
If so they should be the 1st to be "cancel cultured" out of their jobs as the biden depression sets in and this term term circles the drain.
They never said the supported joe Biden
Seriously? He tried to ban travel from China in January.   The far left faught him on all his attempts to be proactive when this came out.  Pelosi, Biden and others took to the streets, Pelosi made a point to go to Chinatown in California and hug a bunch of people
Congratulations and I don’t know why you are supporting Biden . He is the father of mass incarceration
He is a wonderful loving Dog who thinks his Uncle is the best thing in Iowa at the moment, by the time I leave he will be Ride'n with Biden!
Proud of Trump??  Heck no. But we have eyes to see what the left is doing and trying to do to this great country and we know as of today Trump is the only alternative we have to stop the Marxist left that 100% will come after you too. Biden is just a puppet
We can expect lots of vitriol from those stalwarts of decency and morality in GOP regardless of who Joe Biden picks as his running mate. None-the-less here's a taste of what's in store for Susan Rice if chosen
Since you didn’t know Biden IS in fact a pedophile, watch this and maybe it’ll change your mind.
Dumpf needs a better photo op spot!  Distraction! American people are dying! American children are hungry! Americans are in pain and fear! America has no fit leader! Vote Blue and Biden
I'm right there with you.  Susan Rice never ran for election to anything.  Harris is the whole package.  Harris and Biden are magic together and she'd be first in line to run for POTUS with VP as another credential.
So the left thinks he has blown dementia. 🤯 but Biden is at full health!
You are really reaching &amp; trying to cover all races in your desperate lying tweets. “1977: Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into ‘a jungle… a racial jungle.’” Shame on you!
So I’ll vote for Biden. Happily? No. But pragmatically. Because the alternative is those secret police getting a trial run in PDX. Seriously.
There are no heroes in politics. There are tons of people I wish it were instead of Biden. But the only people we can count on to safe us are us. And first up has to be send the fascist packing. Eliminate that rot root and branch. And that necessitates political repudiation.
Yeah, some of my family won't vote for him if they don't like his VP choice. I keep telling them it won't matter, but they worry b/c Biden is old.
Biden. Yes, clear racist. Same as Trump. Obvs. Sarc-FO-asm. You can't breathe without feeling aggrieved. Get that looked out. Muted.
Idk yet. My dad will probably vote Trump b/c of judges and China. My mom probably won't vote for either. She hates Trump more than my dad does and doesn't mind Biden, but she's worried about him being controlled by the far left. I'm still working on both, though.
but you live in a world of demand it happen right now and I live in a world of reality. Have a tiny bit of patience because otherwise you're going to be permanently depressed. WTFU. And yes, I say this as a minority. Check out our reality and how many will vote for Biden.
I wish the DNC would of let you proceed to run against Trump. I’m a Trump supporter but believe you earned to run against Trump. So much experience and devotion. You try every time and I hope you get your chance in 2024. Biden is such a “character” and disappoint.
Biden has better looking celebs than trumps has-beens Woods and Voight.
as a survivor the idea of voting for biden is awful and as a student with a health conditions he’s not enough. he helped built systems that oppress us and won’t work to change things the way we need now. idk what to do. are you guys voting for him? feel free to dm me ur feelings
When Biden wins in November, he will end the divisive politics and restore peace to the nation.  Only a despot would attack the mainstream media and peaceful protestors in an effort to remain in office.
Biden won't close the charter schools, but I will
What on earth is wrong with 8 percent of Democrat voters?  "Only 6% of Republicans said they preferred Biden compared with 8% of Democrats who back Trump."   New Ohio poll shows Donald Trump with slight lead over Joe Biden
A friendly reminder that Joe Biden wasn’t anyone’s first choice, but he is the last stand between democracy and a fascist regime. No one gave a shit 4 years ago when it was Hillary, so please, you absolute dumb ass fucks, get out there and vote for Joe. Your life depends on it.
But what you are describing is everything that you have done. Word for Word. We want our house back. I’m voting for Mr. Joe Biden. We need a calm, honest, and rule following president that doesn’t tell us to drink bleach. I’ll bet he can master person, woman, man, camera, TV🐘🐘
My favourite are the ones saying "he wants to defund the cops". And, I show them the interview where they showed Trump he DIDN'T say that. Had a lady say "Biden likes young women", as if Trump wasn't chasing any woman NOT his wife.
Mr joe Biden is gonna give everyone free everything and abolish police and end racism and I’m certain that mf is gonna get rid of the coronavirus. Only reason he hasn’t yet is because he’s not the president what the hell trump?????
"That is an intelligent, accomplished, trustworthy guy. Joe Biden should be the President of The United States of America"  -said no one. ever. #Election2020 #Democrat #Republican
Your vastly over inflating the impact of debates. Trumps down by 9 on average. Let’s say each debate he absolutely crushes Biden and climbs 1.5 (likely way too high) points per debate. At the end he’s climber 4.5, and is still down 4.5. He still loses.
I shoot first then call 911. This doesn’t affect me. Joe Biden ain’t winning shit
Biden and Trump are both proving age doesn’t come wisdom.
Biden is literally racist and took part in Epstein’s whole thing and supported him. You’re delusional my friend
Trump 2020  Biden sucks
AZ is a lock for DJT.  NM went sissy long ago so they'll vote for Biden.  CO...that's difficult.  NV should be a lock for DJT but for Clark County.  MN goes Red...finally.
They decided to kneel at the altar of “at least he’s not Biden”.
Anyone who is too old for Biden to sexually harass.
How disgusting that visitors can't see the White House as we once could. *Sigh* That'll be one of Biden's first projects, to "free" the white house. I wish we could make #45 pay for it, but that'll never happen. Even if he said he would, he wouldn't.
Continually saying antifa isn’t a terror group doesn’t make it not one. We’re judging them by their actions. The threat right now sounds a lot like “vote for Biden or the riots continue”    Terrorist threat makes them terrorists.
Tribunals are death penalty starting with Opie and Biden
How's phone banking for Biden going? 🤣😂🤣😂
Beating Biden
haha of course! We all called it! We knew they are trying to protect biden from any debates.
Who cares if he stays in the bunker. Let him. Trump can stay in the fucking bunker and rot there. President Biden can tell the world Trump is like a Crazy Uncle. #BunkerBoy
I think Biden should use the footage from Trump’s “This is Biden’s America” and say “This is LITERALLY Trump’s America”
Lifelong Republican but very disappointed in the Republican lack of understanding of the current situation. Voting Mark Kelley and Joe Biden for 2020!
Biden pays his respects to John Lewis at the Capitol
Sadly so true.  I swear Pelosi actively prefers trump to Hillary or Biden because she gets to easily fundraise off of him and be lauded for making sarcastic claps and other meaningless gestures while passing his agenda
I'm voting for Biden and getting the extended warranty too!  Lol
I let CBS know how I feel about this blatantly false ad against Biden.  Anyone else care to do the same?
My wife has 2 longtime Republican family members who are also leaning toward Biden #RepublicansForBiden
My wife and I are former Republicans who left after Trump was elected. We’re 100% behind Biden. My brother is a Republican who’s voting for Biden b/c he’s tired of Trump’s divisiveness. He voted for Trump in 2016. My parents voted for Trump but are undecided now.
American was great before you took office. Once Biden takes over, AMERICA WILL BE GREAT AGAIN!
Awe look Biden is still talking to dead people
Tlaib is the worst of the squad and her refusal to endorse Biden as the best hope of defeating Trump proves it.
I won’t be scared anymore. I’ll look up to the sky, smile and say, “It’s a great day.” President Biden will lead us to a new tomorrow.
He’s just Biden his time
What a joke the GOP has become!! Sad to say I have been a member! So disappointing in your wait and see what the polls look like. I’m voting Mark Kelley and Biden for 2020
When 9/10 “news outlets” spend 99/100 min telling viewers that Trump is the reason for all of their problems, I don’t have much hope that a quick mention of Biden family shady dealings will have too great of an effect. The man was best buds with Robert KKK Byrd for Gods sake.
Go tell it to the moderate Republicans Biden's counting on. You've already turned your back on #NotMeUs, cheerfully calling us every name in the book if it gave you an ounce of clout with your corporate-dem paymasters.
The people with conscience wouldn't vote for Biden or any of the mainstream parties. But it's all good with a voting record like Biden's I'm surprised he's still running. Especially since he was one of the creators of "systemic racism" as the media points. Look at Portland.
It's not gonna happen. Biden really wants to hide out and hope Trump just loses. He would be demolished if he actually had to be by himself and debate.
If elected I hope Joe Biden's opening at his inauguration is, "Our long national nightmare is over."
Vote Joe Biden.
Yeah and you agree Trump is racist, and you support him so you're racist lol. I don't support Biden
We are all hoping for Biden/Harris 2020. Return America to Greatness.  #TeamJoe
They say a picture is worth a thousand words. I could also look up a photo of biden with the grand wizard of the KKK, but I'll leave that up to the readers. Decided to look it up for the left, as most can't even spell their own names.
Which he never said. Just like the Charlotte comment about good people in both sides  Never said it. Biden has deteriorated dramatically in past couple months. He’s never going to debate Trump. 5min and he’s done
He can't make a simple announcement or discuss anything without it being written down for him.  He tries to make it conversational but it's obvious he's reading notes--poorly.  Yeah, I don't see how he can compete with Biden with 30+years gov't experience.
That’s all you’ve got to prove Biden is racist? Have you checked  with “your “ black?
Joe Biden saying goodbye to his dear friend Louis Armstrong (it’s a joke because Biden can’t remember anything)
But not ONLY those two things are factors, which cannot and should not be ignored. And Biden never said a minority, just a woman.
Not sure about Trump as for following Biden it will never show you more than 997 followers.
Thanks I'm not. Biden isn't racist. You believe whatever you want but saying so is speaking sh*t.
Fir comment. And it's your last line that convinces me you come from a good place. Because Biden clearly is not racist and I'm tired of ppl pretending he is for their own purposes.
The Real Reason Biden Is Ahead of Trump? He’s a Man  This is sad!  Will misogyny ever go away?
If Biden wins: “the American people have spoken! The Democrats have one fair and square. Socialist agenda...  If Trump wins: “Racist Trump has stolen the election through collusion with Russia, China, voter fraud and deceit. Lawsuits...”
Better than the young boys Biden abuses now.
Disgusting Vote Biden
Dump dumpf! He is NOT making America great!  As he deminishes any American he deminishes all.  Vote Biden Blue
At this rate of incompetence I won’t be surprised if Biden comes within a hair of 400 electoral votes
Sending out some love for the great state of North Carolina!  Poll: Biden leads Trump in North Carolina
Because Biden is not going to run this country by Twitter and he is also not worried about someone having more than himself.
They seem very confident of a biden win!  😂
Who on God's green earth thinks sleepy Joe Biden could do a better job with China virus? As a matter of fact, who thinks he could do a better job doing anything?
Why the hell is it so important that Biden picks someone based on race or color? How about picking the best person regardless of race or color?
Biden's $2 Trillion Plan to Generate 100% of Electricity from Pure Green...  via
If . refuses to debate . , Trump should schedule the debate and let video clips of Biden answer questions for Joe.
VOTE!!! (For Biden)
Biden is both an imbecile and obviously just trying to pander for a vote
Most on the right are beginning to feel like 2020 will be an extinction event. We’d prob be better off splitting up the country soon and let people vote w feet. If we are hearing you, all the riots stop if we vote for Biden, correct? That’s the threat you’re promoting?
In 40 years in government Biden couldn’t do it and you think he can now? Is this a joke?
Gross. I don’t wanna see Biden tapping any ass, but especially not that one.
I thought this was hogwash. The first half was great because Trump is an ass. But Joe Biden—first of all—why is he not in this? Anyways he says what he’s gonna do. How is he gonna do it? What’s the plan?? I mean, I’m still voting for him but this is nothing but politics BS.
You do realize that Trump is president right now, right? Not Biden
If only there was some reason to believe that Biden would put an end to that...
Hell no, I don't care...my question is, WHY?  Does she really think she's going to be in the White House long enough to enjoy it?  Of course, she does....LET'S PROVE HER WRONG!! VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN!!!
Lyin’ hidin’ senile, dementia riddled biden!
Who is "we"? Are you are with the Biden campaign?
She was placed there by the shithead Republicans in my state of Arizona. We have other plans this November. Arizona will help elect Joe Biden and Mark Kelly will replace the Trump lickspittle McSally.
I'm in Tempe and was phone banking for Mark Kelly and Biden this weekend.  One man didn't know Biden was the nominee (???)  and just said- I'm voting for the Democrat, whoever that is. I also got one- fuck yes,  I can't wait to vote trump out!
Funny. When I see Biden supporters, I don't see them degrading people and telling them to go back to their countries. Only Trump supporters are hate filled losers. Why did Wal-Mart even let those fuckbags in?
Question of the day for Tim, when/where has Biden EVER supported defunding the police or raising taxes on middle class.
Trump is lies lies and more lies. I’ll take Biden, thanks.
Democrats are playing dirty to get Biden elected don’t you think it’s time you did the same?
The Biden’s can then turn into a veg garden
Pure hatred of Trump. No one is voting FOR Biden. They are voting AGAINST Trump.
Please just stop . Wallace May be on Fox but he is no conservative. Biden blew it again. No sense interviewing anyway , he will forget about in an hour .
Elect Biden so Pelosi and Schumer will SHUTUP!
there’s no uh-oh. they’ve made no moves in 6 weeks. and... “Polls ahead of the November election are trending for Biden, with a Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday showing the former vice president with a 13-point lead in Florida - 51 percent to 38 percent support.”
MAGA at work, bringing those great murder rates back like never before! But they want you to worry about their hypothetical Biden Presidency. These numbers are happening for Real under Trump. Vote Blue, and save this country!
if you’re voting for biden don’t ever talk to me again
Honestly, I really like them both so I don’t think Biden could go wrong with either one of them.
Arizona is going blue. We’re taking both senate seats and voting for Biden. We’re gonna replace Ducey too. Peace out ✌️
Name a couple of your republican principles that Biden shares with you.
A Biden/Harris ticket would be MONEY!!!
It ‘ain’t sticking’ as you put it because of the bias on MSM. Put Biden in a debate or in a non scripted interview for more than 5 min and watch the result. His ratings will plummet. The Dems know it. The press knows it.
Not saying she did I’m just saying the framing of this as her being used cause she is smart and doing this out of the goodness of her heart is simply not true especially since biden has many other high profile allies who are just as capable and with similar ideas.
Thought this from the “get go” DNC Whistleblower: Joe Biden Will NOT Be The Democratic Nominee – The Clover Chronicle
If we promise to vote Biden the rioting will stop, correct? Is that the threat you are making?
So voting Biden is the only way to make it stop? Is that the threat you are communicating to us?
Why is the left okay with blinding officers with lasers or given concussions/burns w fireworks? Is this going to continue if we vote for Trump? Is the only way to stop the riots to vote for Biden? Because that seems like a threat to all of us.
🌍If it doesn’t fit in Biden’s pocket, he’s not interested
🌍Wow, how thing are hidden and politically driven.   It’s a shame FOX employees aren’t stronger than they are and stand for the right...   Is so far ahead of Biden, ....
It's not gonna happen. Biden was unacceptable before and is now. She dropped and said her support for the nominee as she signed she would (Bernie was working with Biden already) Wish she didn't but she did. Only issue is she didn't fight to convention due to covid.
We know Bernie would have been working behind the scenes with Biden at the same time Tulsi went to drop out. Also, her support was generally rejected by Sanders, IMO due to Hillary feud and Bernie backing DNC / having CAP people / etc... He had to please the NeoLibs = no Tulsi
What delete the truth
I’m guessing the #PandemicPandemonium ends November 4th if Biden is elected.
THIS is awesome.  I hope everyone can appreciate Josh from NC. (no shirt...well, it is his video!)  Says he would vote for a Tomato Can if Biden drops out &amp; DNC nominates said can.  Thank you.  Give him support.
Another of the angry vegan mob who is a Biden supporter... doesn't know why all of the production jobs in the US went to CHYNA... but will sure blame Trump for the country not being his way. Get the fuck outa here with that bullshit!
You don't know what the AFFH is?    It is in effect now from OBAMA and BIDEN and it will continue to CHANGE AMERICA is a Very Bad Way.
I was talking to a pharmacist at Costco when I got the new Shingles vaccine, and he suggested waiting about 3 months before getting it. By then any problems with it will be observed and you’ll hear about it.
If she is the pick then Biden is screwed. The only pick that could be worse would be Hillary.

Right it’s def biden using her instead of the other way around cause I know if I had full access to the likes of the Clintons the Obamas and Nancy Pelosi I would def go out of my way to ask Liz Warren for her advise since those aforementioned losers would def not be better 😌🙄😒
Just watched Biden’s fund raiser 100 day celebration. That was 1000 times better than any political rally!!!!!
All the more reason for Harris to be Biden's VP.  She'll be next in line for POTUS in 2024 and has the smarts and wherewithall to finish what Biden starts vis a vis Putin and traitorous GOP.
Let’s not do it again. Vote for Biden. None of this 3rd party candidate BS!
I really need to know from a lesbian to a gay, how do you feel with Biden telling everyone how {he feels} about it. What do you think?  After what our country is going through I can't stand the idea of another man coming in and trying to undo what we have now.
Joe Biden doesn’t have a chance in hell to win this election. #BidenHasDementia
How is it that so many people support Joe Biden? It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that  is the only decent option for president.
has problems. He’s trailing in battleground states, &amp; under pressure even in #GOP strongholds. His scorched earth campaign, race-baiting &amp; claims that #Biden is senile are not working. His failings on the #pandemic are overshadowing everything. #TrumpIsLosing.Typical. The pizza owner is "wonderful" because he supports you. However, if he didn't support you or supported Joe Biden, you'd do your usual trash-talking. You only hear and see what you want. How "Presidential". Does the owner also use Goya beans?
Lmao explain why you stated Biden was a racist
Biden's washed up and frankly stupid.
Poor Trump supporters have nothing  to say but they wish President Biden does the same things as Trump.  Lol
People prodding Congressman to back Biden are asking to load an atomic bomb on the White House.
Democrats know he's a turd so their new campaign is they hate Trump so much they'll "Settle for Biden."
so great, live in a trump zone, no signs for either, did not put up a biden one as it would be stolen and a waste
And trump does anything the right wing racists want. Trump is the divider in Chief not Biden, yet.

I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
That's one of the problems with Biden he actually thinks Arizona is a city he will never make a good President.
They need to clean house on all politicians who can't even make a logical decision and retire them . Biden is one who needs a retirement.
Anybody that votes Biden in can follow him to screwing the people.

You should sue that dirt bag Biden.I think it is you, who are running scared. If you are Biden's VP choice, your arrogance, unlike ability and baggage will lose the election for him for sure.
NO plan is Biden's plan. He's incapable of making any cohesive plan for anything. He says what his handlers tell him to say, and often he botches that. Tragic they are forcing this man to be their puppet, placeholder.
As I sit in the waiting room at the tire shop, they had the news on.  The news only talked about the same 3 things over and over.   1. Covid Bullshit  2. Trump is a bad person and president  3.  Vote Biden  Shit is annoying.
This is the truth behind why CHINA JOE BIDEN is acting how he is acting  To say he has DEMENTIA would lesson the jail sentence he might get if POTUS TRUMP &amp; true REPUBLICANS would investigate a life time 40+year government official&amp; family has become a millionaires on tax dollars
I do agree with you that Biden is a bad candidate. So, we do have something in common there.
Biden tells teachers Trump must offer plan to keep schools safe amid COVID-19 strike threat
I'm okay with not finding out until January, on the night before Biden is sworn in.
Zionists and Israel Firsters control the D Party. Biden himself once unashamedly declared he is a Zionist.   Palestinian-Americans sidelined during DNC platform debate

FLASHBACK: Conservatives attacked Joe Biden for predicting Trump would try to delay the 2020 election  Perhaps Conservatives Need To ZIP IT! Trump will try to declare Marshall Law and suspend the election.  I ask that the Military NOT PAY ATTENTION
You forgot to tell Biden bots to vote often.
She is an obnoxious, toxic member of the House. Arrogant and a bully, who does she think she is? AG Barr is a proven  success; she is just another mouthy Leftist rep from the land of fruit and nuts. And she lies, almost as much as Biden!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
No Biden is NOT against fracking. Lies won’t work b/c 21,000 Trump lies are already system overload! This former Republican says NO MORE TRUMP! BIDEN ALL THE WAY!
My guess is Obama and Hillary will choose Susan Rice to be Biden's VP.   Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
ESPOUSING HITLER TYPE RHETORIC, AND WITH, EMPATHY DEFICIT DISORDER!!!!!  NOVEMBER 3RD CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
BREAKING: Biden replaces Secret Service detail with super friendly social workers
Biden already has Larry Summers on retainer.
January?  How about November? :-)  Every morning I wake up I expect to read that Biden has been replaced by ...........
I am an old white haired white guy that is so tired of a bunch of old white haired white guys keeping the left down. Trump, Mitch, Biden, Bernie, Hillary, Pelosi, Schumer, Hoyer.....should all be living in the basement of their grandkids.
Exactly.  Plus his handlers knew in advance and ran a scam and they should be held accountable. To me It is obvious that Biden is a front man for the Obama/Hillary cabal.
You literally tweeted a Biden ad....
"Only serve one term" ? ? I don't think he will even finish his term.  Should Biden win, why do some assume he'll only serve one term?
LOL! Dems can lead?! The most corrupt, self-interested hypocrites on the planet can lead?  Obama/Biden sure did a great job w/ H1N1, right? You have to be 50 paces behind stupid.
The 2007-2009 housing crash created more suburban rental properties in our neighborhood than any Obama-Biden fair housing initiatives. Our beautiful neighborhood is still being bought up by investors. #45LIES
Yes, a local Walmart here in Phoenix has a very bright autistic young man as their greeter. He is friendly and alert. I think Biden could do just as well as this young man. Maybe not better but just as well.
LOUIE GOHMERT!!!!!  SO HAPPY YOU CONTRACTED COVID-19!!!!!  YOU ARE THE HIDEOUS FACE OF AN IGNORANT, MORONIC, SELF STYLED RABBLE ROUSER, THAT CONTRIBUTES CHAOS ONLY!!!!!  YOU ARE A USELESS, TRUMPICAN SCUM, ASS KISSER!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
A $600 bonus, being paid not to work, is the most stupid idea ever. Obviously you are joining Biden in using half brains.
Once again we have proof that Biden does NOT think for himself and needs his handlers to give him printed talking points to get out a coherent word.  If Harris is his VP choice all the better. Not only is she very unlikeable, she has a ton of her own baggage to add to his.

Smart Woman Against Trump SWAT. #Biden
Again you are only telling half the story.  Yes they object  to the platform which is meaningless once the regime is in power. But those same people said they will still support Biden.
What an awful man to put beautiful Portland through his fake law and order intimidation for his campaign!His attacks on cities word and deed are dangerous. He’s not Christian because his evil words lead to evil actions vs. God’s Word. Vote Biden, a real Christian in word &amp; deeds.
Biden has said emphatically that he is a Zionist. “I am a Zionist. You don’t have to be a Jew to be a Zionist”, he told the Jewish Shalom TV in 2007.
I didn't either.  I am waiting for 500 postcards to come in the mail to hand write for Biden and mail out.  I don't know what else to do.

Biden is even now a Puppet of those who want to take our country down. He will be Pres. in name only and his strings pulled by Obama Globalists and Marxist/Communist anarchists out to destroy the U.S. we know and love. Biden hasn't a clue who or what he is.   cont'd

I didn’t Vote for you cus you support Joe Biden for president.
Joe Biden thinks covid is Polio .. 🤪
All the key players in Biden's regime are Obama/Hillary retreads. That is why I think they are selecting her for Biden. Even Larry Summers is being recalled for Joe.
Never trust a Rhodes scholar especially one that was a major cog in the Obama/Hillary regime.  Biden/Rice = NeoZioLibCons dream.  ⬇️⬇️✔⬇️⬇️  Former Obama advisor Susan Rice emerges as a serious contender for Joe Biden's VP pick
I know...I read it and was like, what the heck, did Biden write this tweet😂
It was cool for Joe Biden to "blackmail" the President of Ukraine, but it’s an impeachable offense if Donald Trump inquiries about it.  Biden has lying down to a science - thing is he's stupid so the lies are easy to catch.
What is interesting &amp;infuriating is that it is the RICH who are defending U.S. anarchy;that IS what it is happening per  founders of BLM-admittedly Marxist/Communist &amp; want to make the country same. Obama now has his, Biden blackmailed&amp; pandered his way to the money,   cont'd
U think Biden could do more? Idiotic! Check his history:accomplished NOTHING in 50 yrs in politics, but he WAS always on the WRONG SIDE of every decision that had to be made, a bigot/racist &amp; liar. He plagiarized, pandered, blackmailed for $, wrote 1994 Criminal Act. Disgusting.
Biden doesn't know what he wants. He is a half brain with others pulling his chains. He doesn't know what's hit him. I do -- it's you treacherous, malicious ignoramuses.

You support Biden, an Obama puppet, who would be handled by Globalist anti-semitic masters directing the U.S. to disaster. We would no longer be a country; Obama would finish the take down he began in 2008. Impeachment was fiction by your malicious, indecent, corrupt "friends."
Biden"decent"?! Segregationist/anti-integration SOB, serial plagiarizer, lifelong liar, hypocrite, buddy of KKKByrd,  supported by anti-Semites Tlaib/Omar/AOC and yes,Jew self-hating Sanders! Joe-racial "jokester", sexual weirdo, blackmailer, panderer, schoolyard bully. DECENT?!

Former Bernie Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner stated voting for Biden is like saying to somebody, ‘You have a bowl of shit in front of you, and all you’ve got to do is eat half of it instead of the whole thing.’ It’s still shit.” I like her!
WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE 2020!!!!!

Also, Biden has the eyes of a dragon. He’s not scared to make the stand he needs to make. Trump will become the outsider who, hopefully will move to ‘Salem’s Lot  and work the night shift at the institute since he’ll probably have insomnia 👍🏽

Just remember, Biden has never been a very smart guy. He’s been a was a terrible student, a hack as a politician, and slimy VP. The only thing he has exceled at is gaffes, challenging people to push-up contests and just being stupid.
I am going with Susan Rice. Biden's whole regime will be filled with Obama/Hillary operatives.
Who will Obama and Hillary pick to be Biden's VP?
Lol Perfect If he does win Biden's whole regime will  be filled with Obama operatives. Imho Obama and Hillary will pick Susan Rice to be his VP.
What role will Hillary have in Biden's cabinet if he becomes POTUS?
As usual Bernie chose his words wisely leaving himself an out. But the essence and scent of his sheepdogging is there. I am surprised you still haven't realized  Bernie is a fraud.
Remember in 2016 when every major poll said Hillary was going to win? And people actually rallied around her, unlike Biden lol.
My mind is blown that polls actually show Biden as the favorite to win.
There’s no reason for Biden to waste his time with Fox News!!!
This can’t be helping Biden’s chances with middle America...
Very smart decision on Biden’s part
Dear Mr. President, If I want to know what Mr. Biden will do if elected, I will go check Mr. Biden’s website. Instead of telling us what you think Mr. Biden will do, why don’t you tell us what you are going to do? Signed, normal Americans
If Biden can't do an interview with other than the bought and paid for Liberal media, will he be able to debate Donald Trump or use the virus as his excuse?  Will voters care?

Biden's 'Merica.
2/2  He could have just quit and gone home. He did not have to shame his Berners into voting for Biden. Bernie is a go along to get along politician who is trying to stay relevant. Why is he not in Portland......?
1/2 Berners only paid attention to his half truths and his pandering. They did not want to see his other side. He could have gone 3rd party in 2016 after he got rigged. He ran as a D again in 2020. Now he herds for Biden. He should be shamed and shunned
I am sure you must have heard the rumor that Biden will step down (due to health!) at last minute and Michelle O. will take his place as Democrat candidate. Pls. be prepared. They will fight a dirty, filthy, stench-ridden campaign and WE need to fight back same way! You MUST win.
I am sure you know this -- rumor has it Biden will step down at last minute and Michelle O. will take his place as Democrat nominee.  Please be prepared!  🥰
Wait, if Biden is elected his check will be much lower. But if you are black, you’ve been ordered to vote Democrat. Blacks Can’t think for themselves.

Looney Tunes proving you’re mentally unstable to lead!  The majority WILL vote Biden!
Biden has a 5% lead in ARIZONA  America knows you're a failure and a loser  #Resign
Not only is Biden ahead in AZ, Mark Kelly is trouncing Martha McSally. That said now is not the time to let up but rather concentrate efforts to make sure those numbers hold up.
COVID-19 will decide.  Biden is not beating Trump, COVID-19 is beating Trump.
That’s why we’re voting for Biden Trump has torn America apart
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I call BS!!! Is there a single nurse who has confirmed that pile of BS. you know when Biden is lying? His lips are moving...
84% are voting yes. I bet the majority of the 84% are Berners. They could care less that Biden is a racist, pedo, Zionist, war monger. Shame on them and any other cretin who will vote in 2020.
Biden is the only sane candidate running for the Presidency I choose Biden!!!
FYI, YOU PREPUBESCENT PLEBE, I AM 5'10, WEIGH 172, NOT FAT, FIT AS A FIDDLE!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE 2020!!!!!
It doesn't matter that the law wants local/state goats. to invite the Fed govt. in.  Ppl see this as Trump not doing anything to stop the anarchy as much as Biden won't/can't. Trump MUST take decisive steps now to put these anarchists down &amp; away if he wants votes, not chaos.
My fear, BIG one, is that ppl blame Trump for not acting, not stopping the violence. We look &amp; ask "Why isn't our govt. stopping this?" Voters will see Trump as not doing anything (just as Biden won't, can't, refuses) AND IT WILL COST PRES.TRUMP A LOT OF VOTES UNLESS HE ACTS NOW!
Exactly Spot on. Bernie is beyond pathetic as he sheepdogs for Biden. I just can't understand how Berners still support this sheepdog  after he has shown time again that he is a fraud. How can they possibly be that Ignorant.
Build America vote for President Trump, continue to destroy America vote for Biden. It’s America’s choice November 3rd.
Then blacks are told by Democrats to vote for Biden who said he will immediately raise taxes and take President Trumps tax cuts away.
If you want this guy to be your "Shadow Government President" then Biden is your person. Neither did anything in 8 years and now they think they know what needs to be done. ha! what a bloody joke. I blame you, Obama, for all the unrest in our country. It started with you!
Biden is encouraged by son Hunter to keep strong relationships with China so his money funding will continue. Ukraine should be deeply worried if Biden wins the election. Biden will end all funding to Ukraine immediately.
Isn’t it crazy to think Biden is probably sitting at his dinner table RN thinking who’s going to be VP🥴
Bernie didn't create Socialists he manufactured quasi left leaning centrists of which 80% will vote for Bernie's "friend" Biden.
More lies.  Just like your fake campaign commercials stating VIP Biden is defunding police.   None of it factual.  Biden is increasing funding for police.  Your a fake TV president.   Nov3 can not come fast enough. #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS
13 more than Biden can remember.
EVERYTHING about Biden &amp; his supporters is phony. He IS a racist, a plagiarizer, blackmailer, bigot, a segregation sympathizer, anti-integration, a panderer, a congenital liar, an unintelligent man who got in place due to glad-handing, back-slapping the right ppl. Sickeing man.
Add "professional panderer" to Biden's list of sins. He is despicable, gag-worthy.
I am over 65 and i am not blaming President Trump for any action he has taken for Coronavirus. In fact, he saved 10s of throusand of elderly lives. MSM is saying over 65 Trump supporters is leaving to support dementia, racist, pedophile, criminal Biden. I am not buying it.
* Every President has been advised and feared the possibility of a pandemic virus.  * Trump closed off China against medical and Democrats  *WH Medical team recommended avoid crowds, NY refused  *Obama/Biden left nation medical supplies empty  *Trump cut regulations for vaccine
I’m more than ready, let’s go Biden✊🏼
Yes! Know it beyond a shadow of a doubt! Biden sll the way, bot!
There is no lesser of two evils. Evil is equally evil.  Like Trump, Biden Would be a Right-Wing President
China is being exposed for what they are, A communism country trying to rule the world. Democrats welcome China communism for now because they make millions of under the table payoffs, Biden son is a perfect example. Look further into Dems, to see massive payoffs,follow the money
Her story was so full of holes and questions, why now and not when he was VP for 8 yrs? She changed he story multiple times and said things that were proven to be unable to be true.  I’m speaking as a victim of rape dozens of times, not as a Biden supporter
If you vote for Biden you probably listen to Russ too
Thank You Republicans for Joe Biden. We will defeat the Cheetoh Puff In Charge...and Flush the Turd on November 3rd.
Biden will raise taxes on all people and corporations, end Energy independents causing gas to raise and depend on Far East oil, have open borders, high cost healthcare including illegals, students loans forgiveness, end prison reform, defund law enforcements agencies, jobs lost
Voting for Hillary or Biden is the same as voting for Bernie. Only difference is that Bernie is their sheepdog and was never going to get the top slot and he knew it. His die hard Berniacs still exist in Bernie Syndrome Zone. Bernie is a fraud.
U'll dream up any accusation/exaggeration against Republicans you can imagine in your lunatic, limited brain. More Democrats in Congress have used the "slush fund" &amp; it is time to release their names. We already know about sexual weirdo Joe Biden who fingers+ young women.

145,000 deaths is NOT a great thing! We are the worst nation in the world for handling COVID19. We need Joe Biden to clean up this mess! We’re trapped in our country because you are a narcissistic sociopath mob criminal owing every dictator in the world. You are unfit!#TrumpVirus
History shows America that by far Biden has shown racism throughout he’s career. President Trump has showed nothing but love, respect and friendship with blacks. Since becoming president, he’s has done more to help blacks then any other president except President Lincoln.
Isn’t it sad that Biden is our only chance for a return to normal life? #americasucks
Biden is definitely losing it. Shame on  for showcasing his disease.
Combine this with Biden rambling on about nurses whispering in his ear about pillows and blowing in his nose, and I'm convinced this isn't real life.
I don’t care about what trump says in his ad’s I will never forget about his behavior and actions I will vote 🗳 for joe Biden
One of many reasons for Leftists not to vote for Biden. A Biden regime will be a Clinton/Obama NeoZioLibCon agenda that will seek major proxy wars against Sino-Russo.    Also Google Tony Blinken after you read this.
Great point.  As much as I despise Trump's domestic policies, Biden's foreign policies scare me even more. I am 70 y/o it is not my world, it now belongs to the young people. They need to stand up and do what ever it takes to stop the assault on humanity.
I think Biden should get a biscuit every time he strings 5 or more words together coherently.

Tax returns do not show anything but money in, money out. It is financial records that count; Pres. Trump doesn't owe that to the ppl. Try getting Hillary's REAL financial info...or Obama's or even Biden's.This tax statement thing is laughable and just another slur by Dem scum.

Typical Biden supporter.  He says we are all the things he supports.  Biden is 100% evil, so he supports evil.  He also is portraying himself as a murderer from a comic book (evil).  You can't make it up.

I won't ever be a Trump supporter at all. I just want to vote for Biden and get it over with.
They are also interfering with the election by not giving Trump equal time. I see Biden ads all day long on Hulu, Netflix, even Fox. But Trump's ads are no where to be found.

She would be a great choice ! Joe Biden would be a good president ; with whatever VP he chooses ! But you've got to admit , it's not like we could make a mistake choosing anything other than tRump !?
I want an inquiry into who suggested that tRump should take a test to prove that he does not have dementia ? I've never been asked to take one and neither has Joe Biden ! Just saying ! 😷
✌️ I love Joe Biden , but I'm still worried that the more information he puts out there the more holes the repugnance will have the ability to poke in it ?
I like what late night comedy showed me... If they put Joe Biden on a popsicle stick , and stuck him in the White House lawn like a scarecrow ,  we would still be ahead of the game ! It would allow Fauci  to speak , and End the division of the country !
Joe Biden maybe going a little too far to the left for some voters during his speech today but I like what he's got to say ! 💙

Better get to work President Trump. We do not need a Soviet Russian Government threatening our satellites. We all know if the Dementia minded Biden wins and the Marxists Liberals they will give all our secrets to China and Russia like Obama and Hillary did.
Lol Obama is a joke &amp; Biden even bigger!
Biden called  the first racist president in history-Well, he sure did a bad job picking Biden! Maybe he'll do the same this time! 😊 😊 😊

Mr. Cruz you are showing your intermittent lack of intelligence. That would not be a Joe Biden behavior and you know it. He doesn't have it in him. Unlike Mr. Trump does it have a decent bone in his body and any decent behavior would be a lapse on his part.
OK who did it? Don't drag this out. Make it public.
Wow this doesn't seem true. Duhh.  America's life depends on getting rid of trump so how much more enthusiasm could Biden have. This tweet doesn't seem like a change for trump.  Divisive and untrue.
This geniuses think that Biden is the nazi. Meanwhile who sent mercenaries to Portland. Who locked up children at the border and took them from their families. Who gaslights everyday all day. Right out of the Hitler play book.
Biden Equals 'Biggest Idiot Democrats Ever Nominated'
I'm not going to vote for someone who has made a career to do nothing good for this country. I'm not going to vote for someone who supports China 100% and Joe Biden has even stated he would not punish China for covid-19. I am so sick and tired of the career politicians.
Joe Biden has already said that he is going to raise taxes on all Americans to pay for this covid-19 bull crap. Yet the Democrats give their self a pay raise during this whole mess and once before this whole mess started.
The same people have actually tested for antibodies and found out they had covid-19. And no I am not voting for Joe Biden because he is destructive to the constitution of the United States. And I'm not voting for a person who has made it a career almost all of his life.

Donald Trump said that he would hire good people.  He hired some of the worst people and even that that if they weren't kissing his ring every minute he fired them. Biden will not do that.
But at the same time Miss O'Brien most of all these cities were these issues are occurring wind up being cities that have been ran by democrats for years. And Joe Biden has been part of the problem for years.

Completely shitty editors can’t even doctor up a film of President Trump to sounds real. I post actual film of Biden and you come with that trash. Sucks to be you. Sad how you just turn a blind eye to racism and sexual abuse when it’s laid out right in front of you. Disgusting.
That all article has Trump saying he disavowed Duke and does not want that support.  You hate it because Biden never said that about Byrd.  You can’t cover for this plain and simple, Biden loved this KKK POS!!!
Biden may be old, but he still has his marbles.  They need to shut their traps, and leave Joe alone.
HUGE! Major 2020 Poll Should Have Joe Biden Absolutely TERRIFIED
"We've all ordered from Wish. Com and it looks one way on your fire tablet, you get it and it's Joe Biden" 😂
Trump has disavowed David Duke &amp; KKK multiple times over the years.   Not once but multiple times over many many years. Can't wait for your lefty spin on this one.  Did Biden disavow Byrd?
TRUE TRUE....democrats tool is the mask....then you are forced to worship muslims....America MUST push them out and keep America FREE.....vote Republican to keep America Free.....a vote for biden and the democrats is a vote against your freedom.  democrats will bring back slavery
democrats dont want barrs truthful answers, they want their opinion heard and thats all  democrats will run America like hitler.  We need to get the democrats OUT to save America. If biden and the democrats take over we are ALL doomed.  A vote for dems is a vote for communism

Big Surprise! NOT! Biden Catches A Break After Notre Dame WITHDRAWS from Hosting Presidential Debates
Biden is going to beat you like a drum On November 3, 2020 and you know it!  Your delay tactic won’t happen!  Start preparing yourself for Defeat!!  And by the way my mail in vote will be counted against you BIGLY from the comforts of my home in Arizona!!!
Watch trump in all of his videos. Listen to what he’s saying. Until then, keep quiet about Biden.
Making something perverted just makes you out to be what you’re accusing Biden of.
It's a yes or no question..yes. If course Biden.
Explain trump walking in on teen girls at the pageant, while they were undressing? Oh and trump saying “because I’m the owner” as to why he did? He’s got lawsuits against him for raping a 13ye old, along with Epstein. But Biden!!
Hey, Joe. I love your positive ad campaign. I was wondering:  at the end when you say, "I'm Joe Biden and I approved this message", have you ever considered appearing on screen instead of just a VO? The visual could tie in well with the message, I think. #GoJoe!
Lol. Silent majority.... yup, and it will look like the silent majority stayed home and not voted on November 3rd 2020. Biden will be our next president- might as well get use to it!!!
he is going to lose - I’m sorry you are drinking that kool aid - but there clearly are MANY ppl that regret this mistake. And me, I’m voting Biden.
This story breaks my heart. I saw him on YouTube and was amazed how open he was to other people and dialogues. So they murdered him?? What will they do to the rest of us if brain dead Biden wins ?? Say goodbye free speech ~
Biden is playing everyone wake up
This is ridiculous. Biden is gone. Everything is being manipulated by our shit media.
#Elections If Biden picks Kamala Harris for his running mate she will eat Mike Pence alive in a debate.
Rumor is that she is living with Hunter Biden wherever he is!
Man up Biden.  If you’ve lost your mind, fess up and let the system handle it. Again, your greed is costing the United States big time.

If he had been a Biden supporter, every news agency would have blasted the story 24/7 for at least a week. More than likely blaming white supremacists.
do you think we are stupid and cannot see and hear what Biden says  news for you I can read and an informed decision
biden wants to have us become a muslim nation......with muslim rulers and Americans under their thumb. If you vote for biden I feel sorry for your grand kids.
democrats are trying to turn America into a communist nation......nadler )  the hearings like a little hitler.  the hearings were less than a agenda for the democrats to complain about Trump.  (even tho biden says we need people that doesnt blame others
Kamala Harris as VP huh?  I think she's a lightweight.   Politico accidentally reports Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate
This is called having your cake and eating it to. The pandemic mitigation policies Biden is referring to are the same ones hurting the economy. His statement is an obvious contradiction.
because Biden, Pelosi and AOC will be the Death of the Republic.
Dang it - heartbroken Biden is.
Someone with less of a mind then Biden most likely
The left are using riots, masks, impeachment, etc to hurt Trump in an effort to gain power. If you dont think Trump is a leader and doing everything possible than we wont agree. Biden has ZERO BRAIN left. Been in DC 40 years and done SHIT! Now wants to be QB1? GTFO go read a book
Love u Rex. but if u think demtia creepy kid sniffer Biden is a better choice. I must forget all the fond memories of you hoopin. Ur dead to me. "block or charge?"
Like Biden wrote this, knows who this is, or what month it is. Hilarious u went from the worst candidate ever in Hillary. Now Biden? Who u runnin next AOC?
Biden is currently under criminal investigation in Ukraine for his role in getting Shokin fired. 🤦
What if Biden refuses?  Assuming he still remembers he's in the Presidential race by then.
Yep he's been acting the whole time. That was their plan if they ended up getting caught Biden will take the hits but it won't be much because he's old and can't remember anything. Just like the sopranos
“I get to vote for Trump in 2020 and you’re delusional if you think Biden has a chance! You’re a lot of things, but I won’t mention it to anyone!” Translated I got you
Michell Obama WILL accept the  the VP nomination for the good of the country. Within 6 months of Biden’s presidency he will step down for the good of the country &amp; Michelle &amp; Barack will swear they will govern “for the good of the Country” Freedom &amp; Prosperity just went to Hell!
I'm sure Harris is fighting for the job. After all the VP will quickly become the Prez.  Biden campaign official dismisses report of rift with Harris: 'Don't believe everything that you read'
Yang becomes President because everyone else dies as Biden turns into Voltorb. Boom
.....as of 7/27 biden has not made himself available to mike wallace for an interview.....
.....Has anyone seen joe biden????   what has happened to biden?????   has he fled the country seeking asylum?   If anyone spots biden please notify the authority's so we can take him off the missing list.
That would be the Rasmussen polls that you referencing.  They are still predicting the same ratio for today between Trump and Biden.
Will biden be available for an interview tomorrow?????  stay tuned to see if Tuesday is the day.
TODAY IS JULY 27TH AND BIDEN STILL HAS NOT GIVEN AN INTERVIEW TO MIKE WALLACE.
I said this 2 months ago. Michelle is VP and Biden is retired due to dementia. Which he knows and has agreed to do before what he has done. Michelle become Pres -Obama becomes First Gentleman and both are back into Whitehouse. Obama’s Rule!
none of the people liking this are Dems, we're leftists. Most Dems are usually more toward the centre economically, some even going a a bit to the right like Biden (which is primarily why we hate him, along with him being a bigot, a war criminal, and a rapist)

Coward and Incompetent. Biden Campaign Keeps Ducking Interview Request From Fox News Anchor Chris Wallace
Beth, I’m just curious, not judging you. What’s your stance on Tara Reade and her allegations against Joe Biden? Doesn’t she have a right to be heard?
Also, Biden is failing to do other things like say, call for legalization of marijuana that could win over independents and younger leftists
Comes down to which marginal voters you want. And again, I think Biden is going to win because he’s not Trump. Lefties who stay home or vote third party are also swing voters
Plus I think the odds are goos Biden will almost certainly win at this point because of COVID and the economy. Softballing this and not pushing for an ambitious policy that will take care of everyone will leave the door open for President Tucker Carlson in 2024 or 28
I love how Republican’s get a good laugh out of Biden’s mental decline but wanna act like President Annoying Orange isn’t putting his foot in his mouth every day 🙃
and biden will have all the questions in advance and they have all of his answers written down for him to read.
Vote Daffy Duck if you like.  I get discouraged that President Trump is not doing more to squash this shit.  But not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden a endorsement of the insurrection.
Biden defends and supports people that promote violence and killing......biden is dangerous for America.  who in their right mind would vote for someone that want to kill you if you disagree with them?   WHO??????
Nonsense. He’s ahead because the country is in the shitter with COVID and the economy. Maybe he would have beat Trump in 2016, but if Clinton was running this time I think she’d be doing about as well as Biden.
if biden were elected.....who would really be running the country.......obama and hillary......back to the corrupt mess and unemployment  we are trying to clean up.
Good. I’m going to vote for Biden but I want Bernie’s delegates to cause as much discord and force as many concessions as possible.
biden handlers keep him out of the public eye so he does not continue to show America how mentally deficient he is. The media keeps saying biden is ahead in the polls but biden does not show himself.....he is refusing interviews because he cannot function.   wake up America
Everyone knows it's Kamala Harris. She dropped out of the campaign way early when she still had game left. A clear sign that Biden already spoke to her. She can be VP for four years and then run for president in 2024
Republicans need to stop lying and go to church. Biden ran this country for 8 years in did none of that. Your lies and conspiracy theories are ruining this country.
Message for all the assholes out there that refused to wear a mask. Put a fucken mask or stay your ass home. Biden is going to take over this country and force you to wear masks so we can get this goddamn Trump virus under control. MAD AS HELL
and biden is campaigning on tv saying that the dems wont  blame others, they will take responsibility......when are they going to start doing these things????  when will America wake up and get the dems out before it is too late.
I hope you are right... Do you think there are members of Congress that in the privacy of the voting will vote for Biden to get rid of this embarrassment?
If America elects biden as President we will be the laughing stock of the whole world......can you imagine biden going up against putin???????
something major is going on with biden......refusing to make public appearance without his handlers is a scary situation....who would run the country if he is elected???? this is getting out of control hiding him in his basement. time to hold him accountable.
#DictatorTrump  Happy days are coming....the wall is tumbling down....BIDEN 2020
You are in the hunger games. Obama believes in the “fly over country”. All population on the coast lines rich and elite. Poor in the middle country only scrapping out food and shelter! Biden won’t be President. Obama will shadow-run the county. We will loose our freedom.
If we believe the polls and Biden does win, then we will legit have an empty vessel as president. Like what happens if he wins? Who will conduct meetings with world leaders, meetings with cabinet members, and who will be commanding our military?
Hopefully Biden will stay out of any tanks
Ballot. Person. Vote. Biden. President.
You know what would be funny. If a reporter ask Trump what was those words and can you repeat them?  see what he remembers. Just in case you don't know what words. person woman man camera TV. Or even funnier if Biden on a debate stage asked him if he could remember them. Lol
If Ukraine prosecutors bring charges against Poroschenko and Biden in 45 days, what happens? 🤔  Zlochevsky was the bad guy in the scenario, not Shokin. #BidenTapes
Lmao they admitted they were lesbian marxists who want to destroy the nuclear family structure. The left dont want dads or moms. Just a community of people. That way it's easier when kids go missing ro their islands. Biden has an old submarine base he can ferry kids to. Wake up
TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Fuck Joe Biden
what happened to bidens claim that he would beat Trump like a drum???   Where is biden?????   where is he hiding???   does his handlers want him to run for president hiding in the shadows????? why would anyone vote for a candidate that is mentally unstable and in hiding???
Biden has shown me no reason to vote for him, plus he can barely remember what state he is in most of the time. Meaning he will be President in name only, his VP, cabinet, and Congress will be running the country.
Joe Biden has submarine parades so you can’t report on it.
Absolutely voting for Joe Biden and Mark Kelly.
I agree but the VP pick is much more important than that. Biden is only going to be able to run for one term. Therefore the vice president is probably going to run for the 2024 election and we need somebody that can win the election. I think Kamala Harris is our best choice

Hey what’s up Biden lover is your buddy
I thought I just heard biden on tv saying we need a government where they dont blame others......I guess lightfoot was watching beetle juice and didnt hear him.
Do you feel Biden will debate Trump?
biden doing tv commercials from his basement says we need a president that doesnt blame others......that is exactly what biden and the democrats are doing.....blaming Trump and others for the chaos they have created......A vote for biden is a vote for communism.
Nov. 4th. IF:Biden wins it’s an automatic halt. Look the “C in C”says HALT &amp; miraculously all is quiet!  They think!!!!   However these anarchists want to burn down America and then Biden is up “💩 creek without a paddle!”  Bc he will have to do exactly what Trump did!HYPOCRIT!
- The Biden VP sweepstakes
Biden would say “Oh You know, the thing” and the other thing with the thing. Like my FIL couldn’t remember the word for whipped cream, he called it “white stuff”. Like record player for computer
If you think biden is not a racist then you are a blind brain washed idiot.   wake up.
2 ignorant a-holes sitting in their basement it’s all for show. Obama and Biden love that they manipulated the American taxpayers and got rich off us. Otherwise they hate America. They hate Americans. #DemocratMoneyLaundering off the backs of hardworking Americans.
You must be confusing him with the Epstein crowd of Democrats such as Clinton (both), Schumer, Nadler, Schaffer’s and scratch n sniff Biden.  🤣😂🤪🤪🤪🤪

Joe Biden is an idiot. But how is talking to any community about wearing protection against aids xmission and unwanted pregnancy racist? Why can we collectively group blacks together for programs/community assistance but we can't call out problems? No wonder we're in such a mess.

Im sorry, who is President right now? Its not Biden. THIS is Trumps America.
So once again I asked you you keep on saying that Biden's got dementia. Where's your proof on that. Oh that's right Republicans don't need proof they just lie at will
There are 19 women that came out accusing him of sexual misconduct. But Republicans don't believe it. But everything you hear about Biden is 100% true right. Republicans are hypocritical assholes
Not in this case. Clearly. Trump is not the worst by any stretch.  Vote for corrupt Biden.
Once again the radical right and all the lies that conspiracy theory they come up with. Fact: Joe Biden ran the country for eight years and he done a great job. By the time a Biden left it was record high stock market and record low unemployment. That is called a fact

False! No one person is at fault! I heard Biden and Pelosi bitching about The Presidents early travel restrictions on China! Just tell the real truth not Democratic Communists lies!
I wish no ill will to Biden, other than what he deserves, but my preferred outcome for the 2020 election is he either dies or is deemed incompetent or irredeemable and Bernie becomes the nominee. Biden will never beat Trump and whomever wants him will get what they asked for.
How is this Biden’s doing, when he’s a private citizen? This is YOUR DADS doing.
Smart strong women scare the hell out of trump. His disrespect for women is sickening. Hopefully women will be a large part of bringing trump down in November. I for one will be voting for Biden.
This VP is very important. Biden is 78 and it’s possible he can’t finish his term. No ill will intended. But if something happens VP is our President.
Unbelievable. I knew the Republicans with Blade the trump virus on Biden. But I never would think that they would blame him for the virus while Trump is still in office. OMG vote blue 2020
I knew the Republicans were going to start blaming the virus on Biden. I just can't believe you're starting while Trump is still in office. This is the Trump virus
Sorry to bust your bubble Cry-Baby Joe Biden was your vice president for eight years in the country did great. In fact by the time Trump took over the stock market was record high and unemployment was record low

That is called reverse psychology. Trump is the one they can't put four words together and make a coherent sentence. so that's why you were saying Biden cannot speak.
Joe Biden a career politician since 1973 he is the problem. He is part of the party that wants people bound with lack. while he is corrupt  Luke 11:18 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
I’m so sorry that you have lost your relationship with your daughters, but they are wrong. I live in a red state, Arizona, and I’m hoping Biden will win the election in November! America needs to heal from all the anger and hate that the Trump administration has brought out.
Proven fact. Joe Biden ran the country for 8 years and done a great job. Trump has been in office for three and a half and destroyed the country. And yet you're still willing to vote for Trump
Why Joe Biden’s Boringness May Be an Asset
Busted Team Obama-Biden SPIED on President Trump!
Hahaha I love it!!
You could poke an eye out with that thing Lol
Joe Biden's son is a private citizen and it doesn't matter where he makes his money from. Just like Donald Trump's kids profiting off of Donald Trump and using his name. Are you worried about that. I'll answer for you .no
And there it is LMFAO
You know this is reverse psychology. Trump can barely put three words together and make a coherent sentence. so the Republicans turning around and say Biden can't speak. Three and a half years of trump has destroyed our country
So why don't Trump and his administration come up with a plan to open the doors. instead of just saying we need to open. We need leadership like Biden to get his over this Trump virus
President Obama and Biden took over our country is in a recession from the last Republican president. Now it looks like Biden has to do it again !!  If you vote red, you're dead ! Always vote blue.😁
Joe Biden and a blue wave
Because Dems take money from anyone. Biden is proof of that and as president he will still be bought and paid for.
I notice when you refer to Biden you don’t mention intellect, brains, consciousness, honesty, or memory.             Your self-serving bias is screaming.
SO TRUE....If biden wins election American jobs will go to china.   biden will sell us out to gain favor with the chinese and fill his pockets.

This will be the norm if biden gets into the white house.....we need to vote ALL of the dems OUT.
You need to update your videos on Joe Biden.  There’s a lot out there
biden, listening to you TV ads and you say you will accept responsibility and wont blame others.....then you turn around and blame Trump for everything from the virus to economy.....and call him a liar....you are a two faced phony. Do you think we dont see who you really are?
As long as they debate that’s all that matters . Biden can’t tie his shoes
Don’t give them any ideas— they will try if Biden is elected.
That’s a clean cut  The women speaks as sleepy as joe  “Steady Em.....Pathetic leadership”  “Hey folks I’m Joe Biden’s husband Joe Biden”  Nobody needs to lie or cheat to make Joes flaws shine Unlike the Trump treatment. Lies &amp; slander to make Trump look bad.
Biden campaign wake up! Tell Trump to take a Lie detector test every time he speaks! Then Biden will gladly take a cognitive test.

Funny parody of Biden.
Let’s go back to the years of Obama / Biden.  It’s at that point NOW with Economy &amp; Unemployment &amp; another Virus lije 2009-2010 from a China.    Also No jobs &amp; Food lines .
Right now America is back to the levels of Obama / Biden 8 years in office.  In the Dumpster for Americans.    Not going back to those years. !!
Where Trump came from was that 8 years of Obama/ Biden was a ZERO. Did nothing for the Blacks   All for just themselves.  Hillary was I the wings waiting but should have been charged for Treason acts &amp; many violations of The Govt rules she signed to do &amp; didnt !! That’s why Trump

Democrats NOT want these (4) Bills against China be allowed to go forward. They all Protect Americans ..  Is it because Joe &amp; Hunter Biden have deep $$$$ ties to (CCP ) China Party. Hunter still working for a China. Why wouldn’t Speaker Pelosi want to hold China accountable on..
QUESTION: WHAT KIND OF A PERSON IS JOE BIDEN? HE IS SCARED TO GO BEFORE ANYBODY ALONE &amp; HAVE A REGULAR CONVERSATION 1 ON 1 ABOUT ANYTHING.WHAT KIND OF PRESIDENT WOULD THAT BE? ISN'T HE SUPPOSED TO TAKE A PHYSICAL &amp; TESTS TO QUALIFY FOR ANY GOV.JOB?

Pretty sad response.  99% of future Americans will be paying the bill on this for years to come.  Not just Tennessee.  Embrace Biden's economic plan and work together for better jobs and wages.  Tennessee voters expect more as well.

I was a soldier. Tours in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan.  We killed both types of them. ISIS &amp; Taliban &amp; in body searches found US $$$ on them. Turned in &amp; told was marked $$ from what Obama/ Biden sent of the $1 Bil to Iran !!  Just a fact ! CSD.  That was confirmed   Why no comment ?
you are showing signs of Panic Barack. Yes US Atty will release findings ( proof) that you did SpyGate &amp; is a act of Treason to US Constitution. &amp; your part in it we have (proof ) from Peter Stzrok. You &amp; Biden will BE charged before Election 2020.  Panic showing 👈🏿
Here you go. Even Robin Williams knew Joe Biden should not be in power
Remember last week of Jan 2020#.  All DC Democrats said Pres was WRONG  in not allowing China into US  then 2/24/20.  Video from Speaker Pelosi in SF quote “ Don’t worry it’s just a New Flu bug from China “.  Biden’s support China. Hunter works still for CCP Army investment group
Biden has been in government 50 years, did nothing for the cause. When will you wake up and see you're being played?
Kamala Harris is an Indian-Jamaican whose Jamaican side were slave owners.  And She was raised in Canada  Seriously she's from the bluest state where she mercilessly prosecuted minorities  She has nothing to contribute to help Biden
Biden is not the President! This is Trump’s legacy!
They know that anyone selected for Biden's Vice-President will be President in short order, either through the 25th Amendment or because he resigns. I don't believe he wants to be President, he just wants to go down in history with the title; Biden thinks he's entitled to it.
I think Biden pick for VP will be Susan Rice that will place the Obama admin right back in the White House of course I’m praying we never have to find out trump 2020
Biden is a puppet to the radical soalistic deepstate left, high tax's, more regulation, racsist, job killing party and weak military, and kissing China party. And 95 precent of my  random Uber passengers agree with me #Trump2020 #trumpmorethanever
No, Biden doesn’t care if you continue to scratch your ass and or eat your boogers. He may take issue with the in-breading though.
Rice would be an awful pick. Too polarizing. Painted with Benghazi. She’s cost more votes than gain. If he picks her this would be the Benghazi election.
She’s not going to have an ass left by the time Kelly is finished kicking it. This race isn’t even going to be close.
Area he died.    I haven’t heard 1 word from You on Chicago’s weekly killings by Blacjs shooting Blacks &amp; the Kids shit in those. The weekly shootings that went on fir 8 yrs of Obama/ Biden.  No comments from Democrats on Judiciary group 👈🏿. Un American for Law &amp; Order.  You 👈🏿
Has asked for a Debate. Townhall debate. She won’t accept just like Biden won’t accept Interviews from the Press Corp. All of them &amp; a 1 on 1 with Chris Wallace just like Trump did.    Biden won’t. Afraid ??? 🐥🐥🐥
The monkey said Biden cant keep his hands off the kids, guy replies to monkey and he loves when they jump on his lap!
Joe Biden. Arizona. Time to turn this state BLUE !!!!!
This is the main reason Joe Biden loses the presidential election in November.
You’d better pick out which sewer pipe the American people are going to pull you out of because we’re coming for your ass. No where to hide. Vote Blue. Biden 2020!
Joe Biden hides from 1st Live Stage debate at N Dame !!  DNC pushed N Dame officials to withdraw as site..   Joe a No show, will do same at the other 2 debate locations..  we are monitoring those communications also..  DNC &amp; Campaign cannot afford Joe to Debate on Live Stage.
and a 2 hour Debate he could NOT handle standing at the Podium or against the President..  Bernie woud have torn Biden apart on a Debate stage had he had a chance also.. Bernie better than old Sick health Joe..  He can't do a Debate &amp; it will show.   Run and Hide Joe !!
Want to bet something that the Biden Campaign and DNC didn't want any debates Live that they CANNOT Control on a Live stage ( even with NO other people at ND but the Debate panel doing the questioning.   Biden is a NO SHOW for any Debates before Election..  Proves he has Dementia
China reports highest daily domestic coronavirus infections since March Worldwide, more than 15.7 million infections over 640,000 deaths have been reported. What will Joe Biden do if Elected ? Allow China, his friend &amp; Hunter Biden works for CCP to have any access entry to USA ?
Identity politics or policy? I mean both are moderate centrist politicians; meaning, they will govern in similar fashion cause, let's face it, Biden's an empty vessel. Does it really matter that the VP is a women POC?   The danger, POC are cover to pass agregious legislation.
Who amongst us, those afflicted by disease, plagued by Trumpianism, come forward now my friend.  Be healed my friend, confess your sins. Redeem yourself in the eyes of the Lord, your holy redeemer.  Redeem yourself to the world.  VOTE BIDEN
He’d make a great running mate for Biden, wouldn’t he? #NadlerForVP
I doubt it. Biden will prove himself to be the incompetent he has always been, and his handlers won't allow it.  They will make some excuse, probably involving COVID.
Always easy to do the Monday morning Quarterbacking review of what could have done.  But Ron Klain didn't mention Obama/Biden didn't restock after SARS in 200-2010.  Also this New Invisible Virus NO Global CDC has a Understanding still exactly how it gets into people even w Masks
Biden takes aim at Trump over coronavirus in new ad blitz courting seniors, wow,  Senior himself Joe is hiding from the Press, no Press conferences, staying away from everyone,  the CDC &amp; Pres/ VP have asked Seniors to stay away from crowds, wear mask and stay safe at home.
I think we need a VP who is PREPARED to run in 2024 though. We need to solidify the top two offices. If the VP is a milqetoast “yes-woman” the GOP will seize.
I’d vote for a toilet brush before I’d let tRump get another 4 years.  Biden deserves this anyway.  Biden 2020.
Good Night America!!!! Another beautiful day in Arizona!!!! As the Protesters Continue Fight Against Personal RESPONSIBILITY!! Why have they Allowed their LEADERS get away with DOING NOTHING TOO SOLVE PROBLEMS?? Biden, Pelosi, Obama &amp; Deep State Democrats haven't Done it!!
Well, Dems have only Biden on their ticket &amp; putting BLM in all these cities now, It's pretty easy 2 C they have some kind of diabolical plan 4 Nov. So we better have most of this mess cleaned up.That means More than a few cops with fly swatters.

He’s beyond disgraceful, along with The Obama-Biden Administration 😡
We don't want another stimulus check, we want our economy to open back up. If you're scared, stay home. But let's keep everything closed until election comes so y'all can rig the election and get Biden in office?! Such a joke. 😂 #Trump2020
Conjecture is not fact. Remember tRump said it was a Hoax? Critical thinking skills people!  Actually I believe Biden would have listened to the professionals and shut that crap down in January and. It waited three freakin months. US now has the worst record on the freakin planet
Hunter Biden is still working for the CCP in Wuhan China &amp; buying technology in USA sending to China with the $1 Billion they gave him to do for them. FACT !  Joe's campaign sent to Ukraine the $60 million to stop the latest Investigation by UK govt in June 2020 that was seized.
Biden says in a TV ad. ( 10 testing stations ) he would put in each state !!  Wow. Calif has already by Feds &amp; help of CDC over 100 testing stations. AZ has over 70 in Phoenix alone.  Florida has over 140 in southern half of State.  Joe says will get PPE equip needed.  Late Joe !
I’m so tired of this deep state bullshit. The corruption here is the head of the snake and we will kill the snake by cutting off the head. Biden 2020!
We all know #1 that still after 6 months Joe Biden has not conducted a Full 1-2 hour interview with all the Press.  #2 A interview with No Pre  Known questions to him by Chris Wallace did with Pres Trump  #3  Why won’t Joe or his top advisors allow that ???

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Harris would run circles around Biden and make him look like an idiot.
Joy,  you are asking who will defend all of us Americans from President Joe ( China ) Biden thats a great questions.  With the shifting of funds from Police Dept, No ICE, No CBP or DEA or FBi, Joe's Socialist Communist will be able to come right back in to protect Biden ( Dictate
I say let Seattle &amp; Portland &amp; Chicago burn &amp; those take over more of each. No leash on them No PD can stop them - Civilians next to be robbed &amp; burned  by them Dems like Biden &amp; Pelosi / Schumer don’t care  but it won’t stop if Biden as President   They won’t stop taking more

Good Afternoon America!!!! Another beautiful day in Arizona!!!! Waters, Pelosi, Schumer, Schiff, Biden &amp; Deep State DEMOCRATS- LOVE TOO SIT BACK &amp; do NOTHING for 40 years!! Now, they came ONLY CRITICIZE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SOLVE PROBLEMS!! America and Americans FIRST!!!!
He's a Trump guy though 🤔  Biden stands against most if Kanye's beliefs. It would be a huge sell out move if he did
Disputed?🤣🤣🤣 It is discredited!!!🤦‍♂️ Russian collusion is proven false information bought and payed for by the Clinton campaign🤦‍♂️ All involved with the dossier are criminal conspirators, including Obama, Biden and government officials involved in pushing it. Judgment is near🔥
Glad to see you picked up on this.  I tweeted it earlier.
continues to other Trump stuff.  Then as he walks further down the road and the gentleman proclaims he was trying to trick you, continue with Biden signs in the field as they walk along together.  Might be good.
I agree a illegal Impeachment with No facts. Bias unhappy employees lied. “SpyGate”  with just this week released unredacted  text &amp; Govt e mail docs  by Comey Stzrok &amp; Obama &amp; Biden &amp; conversations of Insurance plan. Wow. That’s worse than any ever in the World w Democracy
A Vote for BIDEN WILL RESULT IN A VOTE FOR CHINA, ISIS &amp; THE FURTHER CORRUPTION OF AMERICA!
That was done by Chinese TikTok lady.  The Chinese Communist Party are trying to get their good Friend Joe Biden in office so his Son Hunter can keep buying US Tech Mfg Companies like he has done with the $1 Billion $$$
I know a lot of the history back then. I am a Black woman &amp; thru our family history been past down &amp; know Robert E Lee owned my Mother.   The Far left Socialist Democrats are behind the Erasing of the history of the Femocratic KKK Racist Party of Sen Byrd &amp; Biden &amp; many others .
huge question in SF  Speaker Pelosi will BOT do ( 1 ) Townhall Debate in the same studio.What’s with Nancy ?   Why won’t Joe Biden do a TV taped Interview with Chris Wallace like Trump did.  Wallace asked President tough questions .  Joe’s  staff  won’t reply. Hiding ?
Demonstrating the rioting and anarchist behavior of democrat voters is very informative to the general population. Voting for Biden will only increase the rabid behavior
Lead like Biden ??  Copy cat .  Joe’s Plagerism of Trump MAGA.  &amp; he didn’t do anything in 8 yrs that President &amp; GOP has done in 3 years before China gave us the CV 19 Virus a deadly virus that Pelosi said 2/24/20 “ it’s just a New FLU bug. Don’t Worry “.  Wow what a recording
Jo has no chance against Trump or Biden. She simply won’t get enough votes because most people literally don’t even know her name. If we want Trump out, the only way we’ll come close is voting Biden. They’re both extremely corrupt, but so is all the government. Biden &gt; Trump.
Questioning the mind of Joe Biden while listening to a man who bragged about being able to remember 5 words and identify an elephant?  Seems logical.
Joe hiden Biden... pedophile for president!! Good job you guys!!! That’s what you are voting for!! A senial pedophile.. that’s the New Democratic Party!!!  Communist racist, pedophiles!!! No in between!
Joe hiden Biden... pedophile for president!! Good job you guys!!! That’s what you are voting for!! A senial pedophile.. that’s the New Democratic Party!!!  Communist racist, pedophiles!!! No in between!
Given all of this, should Biden win, prosecution efforts will begin?  Are there prosecutors waiting in the wing?
Your corrupt Democratic Presudent will be charged for crimes Eric.   You going to pardon both Obama &amp; Biden ??
Good. Thus bill of yours will then allow DOJ to file for sure against Obama &amp; Biden  on SpyGate !
Jimmy Carter is my favorite president:) I am equally as pained about voting for someone I don't love.  I was once at a point of being unsure about voting for Biden.  Then, parents and grandparents of kids I teach started dying while Trump ignored 'Rona.  It became too much.
It is insane politics for Biden to address anything right now when Trump is losing the election simply by opening his mouth.
Consistent negative speech with absolutely no action plan is like nails on a chalkboard.  Joe Biden also has to win an election or the country is screwed.  There are several ways in which Joe Biden has already shown an openness to work with more progressive voices.
What is the purpose of the ranting? What actual steps do you want people to take?  People like you will share some of the blame if Trump loses.  You have a huge platform and use ridiculous arguments to make Joe Biden and Donald Trump seem like the same man.
adding the ages of Biden, Schumer and Pelosi is the funniest thing ever. He is running out arguments against the democrats #Biden2020
Mr Biden,  so what would you do with this situation.  CV19 is here, its not going away, you put more people back to work ? They are testing more &amp; more which is Good by Pres/VP. You are Dementia candidate babbling but with only being a Monday Quaterback as they say.   Complaining
Winslow. Adam Schiff has stated warning to  Americans to watch for Propaganda from the likes of You as a Chinese Community  Party BOT. Or are you the Russian BOT ?  Either way you want their choice Joe  Biden &amp; Hunter Biden safe as puppets to them.
No BOTpal   I don’t. I am for real. A NSA analysis.   I don’t Bull shit like You do.  Tell Biden his Chinese Scientist in San Francisco Chinese Consulat needs to give himself up FBI is on the Perimeter waiting to arrest him  now this evening. It’s getting late Biden buddy
AG Barr is just like Joe Biden when Joe mis speaks so thats not a issue if he mis spoke or is that a Double Hypocritical statement by Democrats.
Speaker  so what does a person under Your Dem plan actually get in $$$$  State by State $$$ in this ?   Joe Biden wants a $10 Trillion dollar 2021 Make American better .. How is he going to do that with 25 Million Americans  not working ?  How will pay for Biden's plans ?
Madcow just another False statement but why NO Story posted of the FBI looking into the Biden Corruption the Beer Distributor in DE worked for FBI to get the info on Biden &amp; the corruption going on in his Campaign.????
controlled by the Chinese Communist Party Hunter Biden is working for.  And now his Father Joe Biden is attempting a 3rd time to be President of US &amp; Huge Supporter of China !  Remember that in Nov 2020 !!  Pelosi said in Feb 2020 it was " JUST A NEW FLU " from China..  Deadly 1
!!Hunter Biden Continues to Invest in US Companies for China ( CCP ). Every single one of these firms has been credibly accused of international crimes. That’s not surprising considering they include the Chinese  &amp; one of the largest investment firms .....
Freddie. Russia &amp; China needs both the Biden’s in office as well as Obama &amp; Clinton’s &amp; Comey  &amp; others Not in Fed Jails with what will come with USAtty Durham charges.
And he claims over and over Biden will destroy our citiesI've been saying the same thing for 4 months. If that was Joe Biden touting this, hydroxychloroquine would be selling like hotcakes and everybody would be forced to take it. Trump 2020....
The problem you caused now can be fixed by JOE BIDEN 🌊🌊🌊. To bad nobody likes you
The best pick will add excitement exponentially. The worst VP pick will still get Biden in office.
Katie, this is about getting Biden elected so he and Bernie Sanders can enact socialist/Communism. That's all this protesting is about. See what giving them $600 extra a week unemployment. No one will go back to work until that free $$ ends..
Biden has a known stuttering problem all his life it’s people like you that bully others from a known issue from birth. Grow up enough acting like bully’s in a school yard.
These Democrats there’s no words for them they have no dignity they have no passion they have no consideration all they want is the money and for them to get rid of Trump God help our country if Biden gets in we will all be under martial law and I’ll be arrested t
Plz people listen to Biden’s press conference right now!!! Sorry just turned it on, again he is calling out names to the press to ask him questions!! Yet he is a great clown for his answers!
This is all u have to say? Too bad so sad guess what I just voted today BY MAIL MY RIGHT. Mark Kelly to make sure that Martha McSally is gone from the Senate. And guess what I’m gonna vote by mail to vote you the F out of the WH to because I’m going to vote early for BIDEN.
You better hope not, if the polls average shift as much as in 16, 3% in Michigan and Pennsylvania and 6% in Wisconsin then Biden still wins them.  Hell, he will pick up Arizona, Texas, and NC if those also shift as much as in 16....so please God let it shift as much as 2016.
The only one whom is ruining my American Dream is you.  You and ur Trump supporters are ruining the Suburbs with your crappy flags and racism. And dividing our nation. Home owner 22years proud working housewive and nurse. Btw voting for Biden. #womenforbiden
You know it’s baseball season when I saw a Biden reference as Joe, and I thought they meant you😁💙

Whoever the misinformed woman in the McSally ad is, claiming she'll protect pre-existing conditions, whereas Kelly &amp; Biden will push government insurance, is sorely mistaken. The entire ad is laughable. McSally is disingenuous. Dems want to build on &amp; fix what's broken w/the ACA.
Completely shitty editors can’t even doctor up a film of President Trump to sounds real. I post actual film of Biden and you come with that trash. Sucks to be you. Sad how you just turn a blind eye to racism and sexual abuse when it’s laid out right in front of you. Disgusting.
Compare &amp; Contrast! e.g. Biden/Obama left cupboard bare! Give stats on their PPE, Tests, Medicine, Ventilators, etc. than give yours. Bullet Points. People like bullet points, not prose! Message!
That all article has Trump saying he disavowed Duke and does not want that support.  You hate it because Biden never said that about Byrd.  You can’t cover for this plain and simple, Biden loved this KKK POS!!!
Terrible for Blacks. Over several decades,  criminal-justice system more punitive than any other advanced democracy’s.   Biden crafted the 1994 crime bill,  preferred to call it (as recently as 2015), the “1994 Biden" bill.
Biden may be old, but he still has his marbles.  They need to shut their traps, and leave Joe alone.
HUGE! Major 2020 Poll Should Have Joe Biden Absolutely TERRIFIED
"We've all ordered from Wish. Com and it looks one way on your fire tablet, you get it and it's Joe Biden" 😂
Trump has disavowed David Duke &amp; KKK multiple times over the years.   Not once but multiple times over many many years. Can't wait for your lefty spin on this one.  Did Biden disavow Byrd?
Biden is senile, it is so sad that this man has been chosen to represent the Democrats as a Presidential candidate.  If elected he would never finish his 1st term and never be allowed 1 on 1 meetings with world leaders.
I think you meant to put a picture of Biden or Clinton
Is Bill Clinton hiding somewhere with Joe Biden?
This is asinine! What's wrong with people??? Start thinking for yourself &amp; start fact checking the claims of the conman, for heavens sake!  Poll: Most Trump voters say they won't accept results if Biden wins
We should have an automatic ballet Every registered voter that never bought a MAGA hat or went to a trump rally Is an automatic vote for Biden
The problem is when you run a business you should know your customers might be either Democrats or Republicans. To respect all his customers he should have kept the flag for his home or maybe his office. Knowing it will offend people just like if it was a Biden flag Common sense
TRUE TRUE....democrats tool is the mask....then you are forced to worship muslims....America MUST push them out and keep America FREE.....vote Republican to keep America Free.....a vote for biden and the democrats is a vote against your freedom.  democrats will bring back slavery
VP Biden, do you solemnly swear that you will not conduct foreign policy and affairs of state via tweet, so help you god?
democrats dont want barrs truthful answers, they want their opinion heard and thats all  democrats will run America like hitler.  We need to get the democrats OUT to save America. If biden and the democrats take over we are ALL doomed.  A vote for dems is a vote for communism

We moms will decide that for ourselves. And I’d choose Biden a kajillion trillion times over Trump.
What has Joe Biden done?
I'm okay with not finding out until January, on the night before Biden is sworn in.
How are they going to open. What is the plan. You Republicans keep screaming open open open but you don't have no plan. After Joe Biden is President we will have a plan
He’s listening to doctors and scientists unlike you folks who believe in conspiracy theories and untruths.  Don’t you worry your pretty little head off Kimmie, moms and grandmothers like me will be voting for Joe Biden. Now go eat some cake.

Won't happen, although Biden could crack 400-plus Electoral College votes.
They'll have to lose four election cycles to change, and they won't. They'll fight Biden tooth and nail till the 2022 midterm, lose with whomever they pick in 2024, but likely gain seats in 2026 because Americans have short memories.
Honestly, I never did understand Harris’ attack on Biden in the debates. Ok. She was a little girl. Great. What was/is her position on bussing? For or against? Can someone enlighten on the point she was making, other than to grab the lime light?
Yep. And Donald Trump will win!  A delay would probably benefit the Biden campaign. He will become less and less cognizant and people will have more confidence his VP will take over quickly - that is the strategy on the left, isn’t it?
Donald Trump may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the best medicine usually is not the best tasting. Joe Biden is barely a PLACEBO - and whoever his running mate is will be the typical nasty side effects!
Longing for Joe Biden as president.😊
You have Boris, we have Biden...

You do as you please. Pray Biden is still alive. He imprisoned many in families across the nation. He lead the committee to ensure blacks stayed in prison. What a great deed!
Biden is going to beat you like a drum On November 3, 2020 and you know it!  Your delay tactic won’t happen!  Start preparing yourself for Defeat!!  And by the way my mail in vote will be counted against you BIGLY from the comforts of my home in Arizona!!!
Watch trump in all of his videos. Listen to what he’s saying. Until then, keep quiet about Biden.
Making something perverted just makes you out to be what you’re accusing Biden of.
It's a yes or no question..yes. If course Biden.
Explain trump walking in on teen girls at the pageant, while they were undressing? Oh and trump saying “because I’m the owner” as to why he did? He’s got lawsuits against him for raping a 13ye old, along with Epstein. But Biden!!

Hey, Joe. I love your positive ad campaign. I was wondering:  at the end when you say, "I'm Joe Biden and I approved this message", have you ever considered appearing on screen instead of just a VO? The visual could tie in well with the message, I think. #GoJoe!
I hope Biden wins but I will not vote for him.
Wow, are the robotrolls already talking political none sense or just saying lies about the opposite party/candidate? What do you mean by “sold out to China” comment? Please explain to me when Biden screwed us over. Be specific so I can look up your answers to these 2 questionson.
. . . and yet the Democrats and Joe Biden are wishing to #DefundThePolice?  AND BY DEFAULT let the mobs run the streets? Is this what U.S. citizens desire?
Lol. Silent majority.... yup, and it will look like the silent majority stayed home and not voted on November 3rd 2020. Biden will be our next president- might as well get use to it!!!

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
he is going to lose - I’m sorry you are drinking that kool aid - but there clearly are MANY ppl that regret this mistake. And me, I’m voting Biden.
Yes. And young people today don't understand why Joe Biden passed the crime bill.   And the Congressional Black Caucus supported it.   NY was scary back then. For a decade after Son of Sam.
This story breaks my heart. I saw him on YouTube and was amazed how open he was to other people and dialogues. So they murdered him?? What will they do to the rest of us if brain dead Biden wins ?? Say goodbye free speech ~

Oh for god sakes! Let’s be happy with whomever Biden chooses and focus on the only thing that matters - getting rid of Trump!!!!
He’ll no.  By the time materials are on site he’ll be gone.  Let the Biden’s decide what they want
This is ridiculous. Biden is gone. Everything is being manipulated by our shit media.
Cracking poisons our environment. Biden's plan to move towards renewable energy will creates millions of jobs easily offsetting any jobs lost. If the GOP had their way we'd still be using outhouses and horse-drawn carriages.
#Elections If Biden picks Kamala Harris for his running mate she will eat Mike Pence alive in a debate.
Already voted in the August primary for Kelly and Biden.
Dems maybe right on this but generally speaking.   will attack Biden on something regardless of what he does.  So do things u got to do to run the best ship.  Obama was squeaky clean.  they still slimed him for 8 solid years.
I want to find a Biden 2020 flag to fly next to my American flag. I would hate it if my neighbors presumed I was a Trumper. And I think it would send the message that the flag is all of ours.
Stupid people will vote for biden
Rumor is that she is living with Hunter Biden wherever he is!
Biden confused about __________ fill in the blank.
Yes, a local Walmart here in Phoenix has a very bright autistic young man as their greeter. He is friendly and alert. I think Biden could do just as well as this young man. Maybe not better but just as well.
Man up Biden.  If you’ve lost your mind, fess up and let the system handle it. Again, your greed is costing the United States big time.

If he had been a Biden supporter, every news agency would have blasted the story 24/7 for at least a week. More than likely blaming white supremacists.
do you think we are stupid and cannot see and hear what Biden says  news for you I can read and an informed decision
You need to stop calling Biden “sleepy” and take  advice to instead call him “weak” Joe Biden instead. More accurate and more devastating. (
Many thanks to The Lincoln Project for standing up against the tyran and standing with Joe Biden and the rule of law. Your work will make a difference.
Which is why Biden's former experience in the white house is So important.
Oh please. Stop making lame excuses for Trump. He stumbles over words because he's not very bright. He doesn't think before he speaks. Biden is just fine.
Agree. The GOP will replace Pence with Haley. To take attention away from Biden's pick..  Been planned for nearly a year.
Isn’t funny that crazy,  creepy creepy uncle joe Is currently running on “covid” related topics..?
I didn't either.  I am waiting for 500 postcards to come in the mail to hand write for Biden and mail out.  I don't know what else to do.
has the oratory skills Biden struggles with. Both good listeners.  And field experience as a police officer and police chief. And her husband is a Sheriff. And they have three children.   LIVE at the intersection of solutions and coming together.

if our President is as bad as you always try to make him out to be why is it the dumbercrates won" t let Biden debate him on national television? If Biden is a better choice let him get out there and prove it ! These are your words. Own it!!

biden wants to have us become a muslim nation......with muslim rulers and Americans under their thumb. If you vote for biden I feel sorry for your grand kids.
democrats are trying to turn America into a communist nation......nadler )  the hearings like a little hitler.  the hearings were less than a agenda for the democrats to complain about Trump.  (even tho biden says we need people that doesnt blame others
Thanks Sean. Just made an AD tweet FOR BIDEN!!!
But first...  BIDEN NEEDS CONSCIOUSNESS.
I didn’t Vote for you cus you support Joe Biden for president.
Ye gods! I'm voting Biden, no matter who the VP is! I think he's a workhorse &amp; what we need at this moment. Yes, I want our girl, more than I even have words for, but I pledged after SC to #VoteLikeBlackWomen &amp; that means I get to vote Biden. This election is too important to

I may be too optimistic.  but I really dont see anything like this happening. we have the most corrupt us POTUS in history for another 98 days until election. hes using everything he can for support.  Biden will be totally different. not basis for aggression.  although #HongKong
Joe Biden is not well.
I'm voting for Biden.
This is called having your cake and eating it to. The pandemic mitigation policies Biden is referring to are the same ones hurting the economy. His statement is an obvious contradiction.
because Biden, Pelosi and AOC will be the Death of the Republic.
It won't change my vote. Voting for Biden.
Dang it - heartbroken Biden is.

took me 2 hours to find a voting facility that took voting inside they hide them here in Arizona but I found it all the workers were Democrats feel like the weight is off my shoulders now I know what exactly where to go when I vote Biden in in 98 days
Someone with less of a mind then Biden most likely
The left are using riots, masks, impeachment, etc to hurt Trump in an effort to gain power. If you dont think Trump is a leader and doing everything possible than we wont agree. Biden has ZERO BRAIN left. Been in DC 40 years and done SHIT! Now wants to be QB1? GTFO go read a book
Arizona was once considered a Republican stronghold but those days are over. The GOP candidate for Senate McSally is down by double digits to the Democrat Mark Kelly. Arizona has become a purple state in 2020
Love u Rex. but if u think demtia creepy kid sniffer Biden is a better choice. I must forget all the fond memories of you hoopin. Ur dead to me. "block or charge?"
Like Biden wrote this, knows who this is, or what month it is. Hilarious u went from the worst candidate ever in Hillary. Now Biden? Who u runnin next AOC?
This is happening now under your watch. What don't you get? People in the streets are fed up with your administration. Joe Biden is not in charge yet, you are. You are responsible for the unrest no one else. Not Obama, Clinton, Biden or even Putin. It is all on you.
This is happening under your watch not Biden's. The pictures are of what is happening now not in the future.
This ironic tweet from a Biden supporter.
Biden is currently under criminal investigation in Ukraine for his role in getting Shokin fired. 🤦
What if Biden refuses?  Assuming he still remembers he's in the Presidential race by then.
Yep he's been acting the whole time. That was their plan if they ended up getting caught Biden will take the hits but it won't be much because he's old and can't remember anything. Just like the sopranos

I want Biden to pick Michelle too, can you imagine that!!
Head of the Congressional Black Caucus.   I feel like Demings being a Police Chief, strong oratory skills would be pluses right now. Dismantle the rights arguments against Biden. And give credibility when negotiating with Police unions.
I'm sure Harris is fighting for the job. After all the VP will quickly become the Prez.  Biden campaign official dismisses report of rift with Harris: 'Don't believe everything that you read'

.....Has anyone seen joe biden????   what has happened to biden?????   has he fled the country seeking asylum?   If anyone spots biden please notify the authority's so we can take him off the missing list.
That would be the Rasmussen polls that you referencing.  They are still predicting the same ratio for today between Trump and Biden.
Will biden be available for an interview tomorrow?????  stay tuned to see if Tuesday is the day.
We will. In November, when Biden takes over your job.
TODAY IS JULY 27TH AND BIDEN STILL HAS NOT GIVEN AN INTERVIEW TO MIKE WALLACE.
Thanks but that's fine by me I recorded all the phone calls with the voting place and their lies and debauchery so we'll work on that when Biden gets in I'll go and stand there with my mask on I'm cool with that they're not going to stop me
I said this 2 months ago. Michelle is VP and Biden is retired due to dementia. Which he knows and has agreed to do before what he has done. Michelle become Pres -Obama becomes First Gentleman and both are back into Whitehouse. Obama’s Rule!
none of the people liking this are Dems, we're leftists. Most Dems are usually more toward the centre economically, some even going a a bit to the right like Biden (which is primarily why we hate him, along with him being a bigot, a war criminal, and a rapist)

Biden and his Staff refused an interview with Chris Wallace?
ha ha ha ha...you seriously think Biden is going to debate....ha ha ha ha....talk about delusional
Dodd is a member of Biden’s VP search committee, so Biden certainly does have the power to remove him from that committee.

Online Sanders supporters tried playing the mental acuity card before the final debate. It started to gain traction, but the debate showed Biden was not in mental decline. Dave's comments are saying the plan will backfire just the same on Trump(who I'd argue is abso in decline).

Beth, I’m just curious, not judging you. What’s your stance on Tara Reade and her allegations against Joe Biden? Doesn’t she have a right to be heard?
Also, Biden is failing to do other things like say, call for legalization of marijuana that could win over independents and younger leftists
Comes down to which marginal voters you want. And again, I think Biden is going to win because he’s not Trump. Lefties who stay home or vote third party are also swing voters
Plus I think the odds are goos Biden will almost certainly win at this point because of COVID and the economy. Softballing this and not pushing for an ambitious policy that will take care of everyone will leave the door open for President Tucker Carlson in 2024 or 28
I love how Republican’s get a good laugh out of Biden’s mental decline but wanna act like President Annoying Orange isn’t putting his foot in his mouth every day 🙃
Biden versus Trump. Some speculate that the future of the republic hinges on the outcome of the next election. But for smart investors it doesn't really matter who wins.
and biden will have all the questions in advance and they have all of his answers written down for him to read.
Vote Daffy Duck if you like.  I get discouraged that President Trump is not doing more to squash this shit.  But not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden a endorsement of the insurrection.
People like &amp; including Biden got us here. They set the stage for trump getting elected  Voting for him may briefly remove a massive tumor but it does nothing to treat the underlying disease  If you want me to vote for him, lobby the bastard. Arguing with me accomplishes nothing
Biden defends and supports people that promote violence and killing......biden is dangerous for America.  who in their right mind would vote for someone that want to kill you if you disagree with them?   WHO??????
I don’t understand the hatred for President Trump, when he has implemented more of the conservative agenda than my beloved President Reagan ever dreamed of.   Why? Because of some stupid name-calling and mean tweets? Biden will undo almost all of it.
Nonsense. He’s ahead because the country is in the shitter with COVID and the economy. Maybe he would have beat Trump in 2016, but if Clinton was running this time I think she’d be doing about as well as Biden.
if biden were elected.....who would really be running the country.......obama and hillary......back to the corrupt mess and unemployment  we are trying to clean up.
Good. I’m going to vote for Biden but I want Bernie’s delegates to cause as much discord and force as many concessions as possible.
biden handlers keep him out of the public eye so he does not continue to show America how mentally deficient he is. The media keeps saying biden is ahead in the polls but biden does not show himself.....he is refusing interviews because he cannot function.   wake up America
Everyone knows it's Kamala Harris. She dropped out of the campaign way early when she still had game left. A clear sign that Biden already spoke to her. She can be VP for four years and then run for president in 2024
Republicans need to stop lying and go to church. Biden ran this country for 8 years in did none of that. Your lies and conspiracy theories are ruining this country.
Biden’s mind is working perfect well. Certainly sell enough to avoid being removed from office.
Since the protesters have increased since your thugs arrived just what have you accomplished other than dividing the country? And your use of pictures of these events under your watch indicts you not Biden.
Message for all the assholes out there that refused to wear a mask. Put a fucken mask or stay your ass home. Biden is going to take over this country and force you to wear masks so we can get this goddamn Trump virus under control. MAD AS HELL
and biden is campaigning on tv saying that the dems wont  blame others, they will take responsibility......when are they going to start doing these things????  when will America wake up and get the dems out before it is too late.
I hope you are right... Do you think there are members of Congress that in the privacy of the voting will vote for Biden to get rid of this embarrassment?
Why should she? She brought her clear perspective, which no one else could. As for trust, the Biden family has a deep relationship with Sen Harris &amp; has for years. They know her. Bass, Rice, &amp; Duckworth are worthy candidates, but Sen Harris has the experience, knowledge, &amp;
If America elects biden as President we will be the laughing stock of the whole world......can you imagine biden going up against putin???????
something major is going on with biden......refusing to make public appearance without his handlers is a scary situation....who would run the country if he is elected???? this is getting out of control hiding him in his basement. time to hold him accountable.
They will vote for joe Biden and throw you trump out for good and cheer as you are dragged off to jail
Remember in 2016 when every major poll said Hillary was going to win? And people actually rallied around her, unlike Biden lol.
My mind is blown that polls actually show Biden as the favorite to win.
Biden can &amp; will do both concurrently.

This is Joe Biden's America
If we believe the polls and Biden does win, then we will legit have an empty vessel as president. Like what happens if he wins? Who will conduct meetings with world leaders, meetings with cabinet members, and who will be commanding our military?

Hopefully Biden will stay out of any tanks

When Arizona and Texas go for Biden that blue MAGA will be more fully realized.
You know what would be funny. If a reporter ask Trump what was those words and can you repeat them?  see what he remembers. Just in case you don't know what words. person woman man camera TV. Or even funnier if Biden on a debate stage asked him if he could remember them. Lol

what happened to bidens claim that he would beat Trump like a drum???   Where is biden?????   where is he hiding???   does his handlers want him to run for president hiding in the shadows????? why would anyone vote for a candidate that is mentally unstable and in hiding???
Biden has shown me no reason to vote for him, plus he can barely remember what state he is in most of the time. Meaning he will be President in name only, his VP, cabinet, and Congress will be running the country.
Joe Biden has submarine parades so you can’t report on it.
Good point. But...  Biden released 21 years of tax returns.
I have AZ friends who are super Facebook and Foxified.   Think Biden is going to be arrested any day. 🙄  How does attacking a fellow vet, Gallego, help that?
Absolutely voting for Joe Biden and Mark Kelly.
I agree but the VP pick is much more important than that. Biden is only going to be able to run for one term. Therefore the vice president is probably going to run for the 2024 election and we need somebody that can win the election. I think Kamala Harris is our best choice

Hey what’s up Biden lover is your buddy
I thought I just heard biden on tv saying we need a government where they dont blame others......I guess lightfoot was watching beetle juice and didnt hear him.
He’s being polite. Biden suffers from mid stage Dementia. He’ll basically be incapacitated mentally within a short period of time.
Do you feel Biden will debate Trump?
biden doing tv commercials from his basement says we need a president that doesnt blame others......that is exactly what biden and the democrats are doing.....blaming Trump and others for the chaos they have created......A vote for biden is a vote for communism.
Biden could have all 3 dementia, Parkinson’s &amp; Alzheimer’s and do a better job than Trump.

Let’s get real. The only people you truly gave tax cuts to were the wealthy. I’m middle class barely squeaking by and I’ve actually paid MORE in taxes the past two years. Give up your lies. Can’t wait to vote Biden in.
Joe Biden is 77 years old and Donald Trump is 74 years old they are both about double the avg. age of the citizens they “lead” Trump was already the oldest president at date of inauguration 4 years ago. What the fuck is wrong with our country?

So once again I asked you you keep on saying that Biden's got dementia. Where's your proof on that. Oh that's right Republicans don't need proof they just lie at will
There are 19 women that came out accusing him of sexual misconduct. But Republicans don't believe it. But everything you hear about Biden is 100% true right. Republicans are hypocritical assholes
Interesting point. I'll think on that.   I do like resister porn, So I may be biased.   They are making pro Biden ads too. Targeted to Pennsylvania and Michigan.
Not in this case. Clearly. Trump is not the worst by any stretch.  Vote for corrupt Biden.
Biden lies like they all do.

Once again the radical right and all the lies that conspiracy theory they come up with. Fact: Joe Biden ran the country for eight years and he done a great job. By the time a Biden left it was record high stock market and record low unemployment. That is called a fact

We live in a State/country where the opposition party has their headquarters burned to the ground and secret police are used to punish dissidents. ( Biden is also leading in all recent polls in AZ so they’re also liars)
You’re voting for this or you kidding me like I told Joe Biden is a done deal you’re here for the ride sit back and enjoy it 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Trump 2020
False! No one person is at fault! I heard Biden and Pelosi bitching about The Presidents early travel restrictions on China! Just tell the real truth not Democratic Communists lies!
I wish no ill will to Biden, other than what he deserves, but my preferred outcome for the 2020 election is he either dies or is deemed incompetent or irredeemable and Bernie becomes the nominee. Biden will never beat Trump and whomever wants him will get what they asked for.
is so corrosive, dems are saying vote blue; rather than vote for creepy, black hating Biden! What a shame.
As I recall Biden said something about your not black if your not voting for him. Or the one about they’re gonna put Ya’All back in chains. The man is a loser &amp; a joke.
How is this Biden’s doing, when he’s a private citizen? This is YOUR DADS doing.
You are losing in each of these battleground states according to Fox.
Smart strong women scare the hell out of trump. His disrespect for women is sickening. Hopefully women will be a large part of bringing trump down in November. I for one will be voting for Biden.
This VP is very important. Biden is 78 and it’s possible he can’t finish his term. No ill will intended. But if something happens VP is our President.
13 more than Biden can remember.
I plan on voting for Biden the day I get mine.
Unbelievable. I knew the Republicans with Blade the trump virus on Biden. But I never would think that they would blame him for the virus while Trump is still in office. OMG vote blue 2020
I knew the Republicans were going to start blaming the virus on Biden. I just can't believe you're starting while Trump is still in office. This is the Trump virus
Sorry to bust your bubble Cry-Baby Joe Biden was your vice president for eight years in the country did great. In fact by the time Trump took over the stock market was record high and unemployment was record low

Here's Why Mitt Romney Thinks Donald Trump Will Win Reelection  via  Heaven forbid if Biden is elected.
I would not put Joe Biden behind anything except for a prison wall, like he's the reason your Uncle, your brother, your father went to jail on 3-strikes. He's in hell. Let Joe Biden stay in Hell!
That is called reverse psychology. Trump is the one they can't put four words together and make a coherent sentence. so that's why you were saying Biden cannot speak.
So where is all this so-called documents that prove Biden's corruption?
Joe Biden a career politician since 1973 he is the problem. He is part of the party that wants people bound with lack. while he is corrupt  Luke 11:18 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
You lie like a rug. Biden never said he wants the police defunded. Reps have to lie about what Dems want because you can’t govern. Dems represent a broad spectrum, unlike the goose stepping Reps with their heads up your father’s posterior &amp; their pockets full of Putin’s money.
I’m so sorry that you have lost your relationship with your daughters, but they are wrong. I live in a red state, Arizona, and I’m hoping Biden will win the election in November! America needs to heal from all the anger and hate that the Trump administration has brought out.
Lol cute video but belief that there are 2 parties is childish. These are the same party, for wars and profits over people. Did Bernie and Biden task force have Medicare for all or the green new deal? Nope! But it’s nice for you to try to sidetrack off of the kneeling in sports
Joe Biden gets elected, POOF
I wonder why Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama couldn't manage this while sitting in the White House, although there was a "president of color"... The right question might be: "How are you going to change that?" For what reason should anybody believe you, Mr. Biden?

Proven fact. Joe Biden ran the country for 8 years and done a great job. Trump has been in office for three and a half and destroyed the country. And yet you're still willing to vote for Trump

You could poke an eye out with that thing Lol
Joe Biden's son is a private citizen and it doesn't matter where he makes his money from. Just like Donald Trump's kids profiting off of Donald Trump and using his name. Are you worried about that. I'll answer for you .no
And there it is LMFAO
You know this is reverse psychology. Trump can barely put three words together and make a coherent sentence. so the Republicans turning around and say Biden can't speak. Three and a half years of trump has destroyed our country
So why don't Trump and his administration come up with a plan to open the doors. instead of just saying we need to open. We need leadership like Biden to get his over this Trump virus
President Obama and Biden took over our country is in a recession from the last Republican president. Now it looks like Biden has to do it again !!  If you vote red, you're dead ! Always vote blue.😁
Joe Biden and a blue wave
Biden WANTS a healthcare plan. Trump just wanted to dismantle the one Obama created. Biden has the intelligence and drive to make a plan happen. Trump couldn't care less.
Her story was so full of holes and questions, why now and not when he was VP for 8 yrs? She changed he story multiple times and said things that were proven to be unable to be true.  I’m speaking as a victim of rape dozens of times, not as a Biden supporter
Really you don’t  think Biden can’t complete a sentence? He went to univ of Delaware which I’d say isn’t tough to get in you’d probably need to know your abcs and speak in full sentences. I’m willing to pay you 1k  if I can’t find him speaking in full sentence? Want to bet?
Because Dems take money from anyone. Biden is proof of that and as president he will still be bought and paid for.
Leftists just make it up as they go. Remember Biden says he deals in “truth, not facts”
I notice when you refer to Biden you don’t mention intellect, brains, consciousness, honesty, or memory.             Your self-serving bias is screaming.
SO TRUE....If biden wins election American jobs will go to china.   biden will sell us out to gain favor with the chinese and fill his pockets.
Ok. Now do Biden... I dare you
biden, do you mean like when you told that factory worker that he was full of shit?????   remember that??? Is that how you listen to others????
BREAKING: Trump Smashing Biden In Several Battleground States
Biden must insist that-“Evil genius”  TAKE LIE DETECTOR TEST! That should shut the “VIRUS ENABLER” down!
You know as soon as Joe Biden is inaugurated, the Republicans are immediately start saying the virus is Joe Biden's virus and he is not handling it properly. It's all going to be Joe Biden fault
This will be the norm if biden gets into the white house.....we need to vote ALL of the dems OUT.
You need to update your videos on Joe Biden.  There’s a lot out there
I hope you don’t mean that. Not at least without due process. I hope Biden will bring some calm and resolve. And a starting place to create some lasting and equitable change.
biden, listening to you TV ads and you say you will accept responsibility and wont blame others.....then you turn around and blame Trump for everything from the virus to economy.....and call him a liar....you are a two faced phony. Do you think we dont see who you really are?
As long as they debate that’s all that matters . Biden can’t tie his shoesIt had sure sounded to me  that it was first by late July, then the first week in August, etc.  As I said elsewhere I suspect Jill Biden doesn't like Kamala.

How much do YOU OWE the BANK OF CHINA? Do you pay all your bills? #TrumpTaxes #TrumpBankruptcies
Trumps self sabotage is making it so Biden doesn’t have to do anything in order to win. If it was competitive, Biden would be more likely to take it on. Joe Biden has hinted since the intermission of the 1st debate that Yang is going to be in his cabinet.
He *also* said, in the same interview,  that she's very beautiful.    Then he followed it up with he'd date her.  And y'all think Biden is creepy because he friendly.
10 Biilion!  The USPS Union endorse Sleepy Biden so the DNC!  Outrageous
I feel VERY strongly that this is the wrong election to vote 3rd party. I’ve voted 3rd party since 2012, and this year I can’t do that in good conscience. As fucking shitty as Biden is, this election is about our democracy.
Such a problematic process from the Biden campaign
I am done with Biden he has my vote nothing else
Hands off Joe; he's our Asshole.
is Joe Biden Bill Clinton now?  what kind of desperation  does a "GOP" need to  write about Clinton  when Don Trump was  &amp;ucking girls with Epstein
Hey little fella give me your address so I can send you a pair of big blue shoes and a rainbow colored wig. You don’t have to answer the Biden Question, I already know you answer, Biden is not fit. Keep deflecting and telling yourself whatever you to need so you “feel” better.
Joe Biden ad that says all Trump wants is to divide us is perfectly ironic
is Bill running?  I thought it was Biden.
this is priceless.  Epstein partied with Bill Clinton...  and to think I was positive that  it was JOE BIDEN who was running   against donny
Let's let VP Biden make the choice. He will have to work with that person. Get off his back...he has a darn tough job ahead of him. Just give it a rest.
Even Biden had more simultaneous viewers than that
Look there some crazy and goofy people Biden is considering but Bass is in her own league of crazy.
In the basement with #Biden
We've all had those moments where you have no idea what the actual hell to Tweet. Just do what I do sometimes. Tweet your thoughts. Or Tweet about how bad of a president Trump is and how much better Biden would be.
Always believe the woman Biden said, right  ?
Rather than do actual work, House Democrats are subpoenaing Secretary Pompeo because they think he helped "advance a conspiracy theory" about Joe Biden.  We're in the middle of a pandemic, and this is what Democrats are doing right now.
Why oh why do democrats eat their own? ANY woman Biden picks will be fine. They are ALL excellent. Plus...they will be debating a Qtip.
That’s Joe Biden statement.” You bet Joe will keep us safe.”
Oh they will accept it. We've had to accept the criminal in the WH for four years. We are going to follow the law. Let's make that loud and clear. When trump loses, the military steps in  Poll: Most Trump voters say they won't accept results if Biden wins
Biden won’t know who he is or where he is by next week.
Also, Biden will bring that by himself. Susan Rice is the only one who covers your points - and they aren't the most important. And, again, Biden covers rebuilding ally's trust all by himself.
No doubt Juan heard Biden differently than Emily. Suspect Juan heara Biden differently than everyone does. #TheFive
🤣🤣🤣 You liberals are a treat. Anything to deflect. Still avoiding the Biden question. It must be exhausting being a liberal. Mental Gymnastics all day long.
Last time was Biden. He told Obama he would not be running. But I'm not holding that against him now because he was the consensus candidate who can beat Trump.
And he's blaming the Portland stuff on Biden.  He said this will be Biden's way if Biden is elected president.   What bullshit!!
Really not though. Biden became VP partly because he told Obama he'd have to Presidential ambitions - or none that would interfere for 8 years. They did well.
Biden has never said Defund the police! And everything you just said about Biden is exactly to a T describing Trump! But add lying, fake conspiracy theories and blame everybody but himself mentality! And it takes somebody with those same characteristics to vote for him

I’m going  because not voting for Biden. Never ever choosing a “lesser evil” again because there is no such thing in politics.
I'm pretty angry #Tsarnev will get another shot at life.  #BostonBomber Russia tried to warn Biden Obama and Hillary, but she let them in anyway.  Instead of treating him like an American, he should have his VISA revoked and let Chechnya or ? deal with his illegal *ss.
This is a LIE - Does he ever provide details on the internal polls? It is probably just his family &amp; Stephen Miller, 100% Trump, none of them want Biden
🤔 you’re sounding a lot like bumbling Biden these days. Might want to check your meds, something is definitely off.
Actually, men (and women) HAVE said that about Biden. It's why nobody expects him to run in 2024 and are looking to his VP to carry on his administration's legacy instead.
8 miserable destructive yrs under Obama/Biden. Foreclosures on homes..jobs lost..people on food stamps &amp; welfare. People lost hope by the evil run government. Pres trump brought back hope &amp; patriotism back to America. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 🇺🇸
These men are afraid Kamala Harris will challenge the white male stranglehold on politics, and it's exactly why Biden should pick Harris. White men had their shot and they've damn near destroyed the republic. Go play golf, Ed, your time is over.
Sadly, Yes.  Come January 21st, I will start letting my complaints about Biden be known.  I hear you, and since I'm not a Black woman, I'll follow you on this for sure.
Uhmm, you shouldn't add those 2 together... It's % of voters by voting type. So you add the same voting type/different candidates together to get 100% (if you include 3rd party).   So for by mail: Biden (32) +Trump (65) +3rd party (3)  =100%.
You’re still on this?? And YES, I am voting Biden. Not excited about it, but it’s necessary. And my profile used to say MAGA.  No more. (Independent now, for Biden.)

How insulting that Trump &amp; Pence think that we’re so stupid to think that Biden (who is universally respected) will destroy the country anymore than they have in one term. I have never felt less safe than I do now with Trump/Pence at the helm.
Unfortunately, a vote for Biden or getting rid of Trump does not fix this. Good luck.
#GOPCorruptionOverCountry #TrumpThreatensAmerica  Serious question; what is everyone doing to ensure a Biden win and to #TakeTheSenateBack
Seems to me, you don't care about actually resolving any issues but are just blinded by hate for Trump and the GOP. That's no path forward. They are all evil. Pelosi, McConnell. Trump, Biden.
The one good thing about Biden’s potential presidency is that this time we are going to smell the bullshit from the jump.
Love it , I’m not going and Biden and other dems not. Mayb Lindsey or Mc Russian

I dunno, I feel like considering Joe Biden's age, the person he chooses as VP really ought to be ready to become the president.
Sum bout how hard Joe Biden tryna get down with the niggas don’t sit right wit me 🧐
Good grief,  please cut the sexist crap. ALL presidential candidates and former candidates have a sizable ego... as do you. Was Biden a bad VP because he eventually ran for president himself... a third time? Or was that okay because he’s a man?
And we are still in Iraq. Biden voted and supported the Iraq war for years. Same with Afghanistan war. Dems and Republicans are equally responsible. Let's not forget who put Trump there, the Dems.
Actually, I’m for Biden. But if most Americans do vote by mail (if millions do!), then it’ll take weeks to get a result. And there will be all kinds of problems.   Remember Florida in 2000?   But, I’m bored with this.. Bye.💋

I just want a fair election. If there’s any fraud, it’ll most likely benefit Biden.  For “the world’s greatest democracy”, voting in the USA is very sloppy. Now no one wants anyone to show ID to vote, and now “mass mailing” of ballots to millions of people.

Where is Joe Biden's leadership during this pandemic. Nothing but effortless platitudes and sloganeering from the "great" (non)leader.
I really don’t think he’s much better, before covid im not sure there’s anything Trump was doing to run the country into the ground. One thing Biden would be better at is uniting the country over racial injustice.
I suspect the Democrat plan is for Biden and his female VP to enter the White House, then after a short time Biden will resign as President and the US will have its first Woman President.
Do you think Biden should even bother debating him?
Is Biden better? They both suck. How have we came to this? Best thing Is that corna keeps up so Biden doesn’t have to debate, you know that. I just don’t understand how these are the two candidates. It’s crazy
Chica, I totally agree. I was just thinking this morning that maybe I should take a week off and bury my head in the sand w the rest. Extreme precaution w Covid and ridin’ w Biden but I’m exhausted. Not sleeping and go to bed w disgust and wake up the same.
So, what are we thinking?  A Biden/Pelosi ticket?  Haven't heard rumors on that front-- why not?
Trump can't navigate a handicapped ramp without help,  drink with one hand, and can't answer a simple question without automatically rambling on about an unrelated subject.  Biden has had a stutter his whole life he has worked to overcome. Maybe fuck yourself with that bullshit.
Not sold on IA or MT electing Democratic Senators while also voting for Trump. If anything you'd see split ticketing the other way, a vote for Biden but a Republican Senate as a check.
Biden was partly or mostly behind:  Crime bill, bankruptcy bill, police militarization, Iraq War, coups in Latin America, etc...  I don't support Trump nor Biden   I have great issues with someone xenophobically pushing the debunked russiagate instead of focusing on real issues.

Dems are always loaded with “passion.” Biden won’t have to pick on that one quality- it’s everywhere in excess.
Honestly if the trump wing of the party gets beaten down hard enough and Biden pushes for compromise they could caucus a few republicans.
This is what they do, and the very reason Biden is hidden in a basement somewhere. They have the next election so rigged he doesn't have to attend a debate or campaign. It terrifying actually.

1.) Character limit 2.) Personally disliking someone and policies are different.  I dislike Biden and Obama too but all for various reasons
The great thing is that both these great women will be part of the Biden team, along with an amazing list of others. Finally, no empty positions, no temporary and unqualified idiots, not suck ups who only care about their own gain.
Well no, it's not ok. Biden has it in his head that joking about Trump's tweets is something that people care about when in reality nobody really gives a fuck about trump vs Bidens tweets, people just need healthcare. Honestly it's not that hard to understand

I disagree. Biden has an important skill that Trump has proven is critically lacking in his Admin. Biden can &amp; will build a team of our country’s best to run our agencies &amp; fill his cabinet. Trump has run off the best of the Republicans. We have a fourth string team under him.
It's the attempt to bypass #VoterID.  We don't believe in 112% voting counting dead people and illegal citizens, while Obama/Biden/Dems do think it's okie dokie.  #VoterFraud
If President Biden and team go after him yes. I think alot more criminal activity will be found after hes gone.
There are no candidates right now actually qualified for president. Trump can't handle a  Pandemic or protests. Biden is the architect of our issues. Jo just wants nothing left. Howie parrots Russiagate.

My point is that you are all jargon, soundbites and no perspective. Your meme is, of course, without any testable arguments. What was supposed to do that he failed to deliver? On the opposite end, can you name something he's done well? Do you know Biden is my point?
I’m not a Trumpster.   I’m voting for Biden.  Although still haven’t heard him say what he wants to do.  (And he’s been around 40 years and hasn’t done much yet.) But Trump’s just too divisive for his few good ideas.
Trump probably wants to delay the election so he can stay in the White House for a little while longer...  Funny that he thinks he has so much power. He thinks he's a king. He's probably scared of the election because he knows he isn't going to win against Biden.

Look at Biden's history of failure. It's right there to see. Can you give us one thing he has accomplished?
His comment did stereotype, which itself is not cool. I agree with you and so does a good chunk of Americans. That doesn't make him a racist. Biden isn't perfect, but he's done more for this country than you know. At least read his Wikipedia page. :)
I think Susan Rice. Its just a feeling. But she is close to Biden has executive experience as ambassador to the UN, and has no legislative baggage.
Thank you 🙏🏽 pray no Biden he said he will undo all Trump has done !
We have two bad choices for President in 202, but if you were truly capable of demonstrating objectivity you would see that Trump is much more dangerous to our national security &amp; rule of law than Biden.   When Trumps interests conflict w/the nation’s, he serves himself above all
I'm not a racist period...never have been nor will I be. You're drawing your own conclusions from a soundbite taken out of context. If Biden was racist, it would be clear...like Trump. Trump publicly demonstrates it.

If y’all Trumpers don’t wanna vote this November because it’s “rigged” then don’t vote. Honestly at this point both Biden and Trump are both pigs and neither one has my vote. #VoteGreen2020
Twitter continues with its biased democratic support for Joe Biden by allowing anti-trump films but denying the Trump campaign access to the site
But it’ll likely happen under Biden’s AG. It’s not Barr is going to go after Dershowitz.   “Do you think that it’s fair for a 67-year-old man to be sent to prison to seven to nine years?” - Barr  (This is the closest I could find to a GIF of Bill Barr)
What really gets under the Berniebros' skin is that Bernie himself has come out in support of Biden and has even said that Biden's plans are the most progressive he's ever seen -- and I love their meltdown over it!
- the third leg of #traitortrump plan to set up authoritarian regime here...
How come Twitter doesn’t allow such elaborate films from the Trump campaign? Because Twitter is bigoted bias and politically rooting for Joe Biden that’s why
What a great video.  Thank you guys for the sneak preview and the hearty discussion.  Onward to Nov 3 and pedal to the metal until Joe Biden is inaugurated.  Let's build a stronger, more united nation

Remember liberals in the media said four years ago about Trump after election day.  "Let's give him a chance"  What are they going to say about Biden after the election?
Correct. That’s why I’m voting Biden
I’ll take Biden for $500!
Obama got a 2 for 1 yesterday-did his duty to attend funeral and provided a political speech for Biden!  Go back to the Vineyard.
Pretty sure Obama and Biden created more jobs than trump. Drove unemployment down and saved multiple industries. Trump gave tax cuts to rich people and drove our deficit through the roof.
Biden only needs to win 3 battleground states to defeat Trump – and he's leading in all 6
Biden is very ignorant
Dr. Fauci is a joe Biden supporter a friend of Clinton and Obama a long time liberal Democrat his opinions are tainted
Weird Biden was VP and things were fine. He’s a much better option than the shit storm we’re in now. Actually anyone is. A rock could do a better job.
Obama/Biden brought the country back from the great recession Republicans created and Biden will do it again!

This article does not debunk anything other than the writer couldn’t get an interview with the accuser.
Have you ever viewed a video that was "favorable" to Biden?...Me either.
I would sleep better knowing that Biden Admin, House and Senate will investigate and prosecute where necessary and not be overtly "magnanimous" in trying to move forward. These people need to be publicly exposed. A "Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities" maybe?

Joe Biden is basically a Republican tho. He isn't the solution. He may not be as evil or bad as Trump, but he's still bad.

I'm absolutely positive there are 10s of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of conservatives who will vote for Biden because they have morals. There are ZERO true liberals that support trump. I say this with complete certainty.
Your  "Joe... you don't have to do this" quote.  Spoken to Biden since he said, just two days ago, the "2020 Census was two censuses ago"... or were you relying on you experience with Biden's stupidity and NOT Biden's obvious dementia?
News Flash the Obama/Biden administration used up the national stock pile of PPE's and other medical supplies needlessly for the h1n1 virus and didn't replenish the stock piles they used up.... News Flash the GDP is only 9.32% down from last year.  News Flash before the virus....
But Biden is better? Come on now Mario wake up
Joe Biden is an actual racist. 🤣 Seeing Dems praise him while calling Trump supporters racist for supporting Trump is comedy Gold. What half-wits.
FACT CHECK:  Biden did not explicitly tie xenophobia to the travel restriction. His tweet reflects coronavirus remarks he made during a campaign stop in Iowa Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced.
FACT CHECK:  Biden tweeted: "We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump's record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency."
Joe Biden is literally everything the left claims Trump is. So I find this whole election to be rather amusing.

So who's running with Biden cause Obama ain't saying shit about that's my dawg
Forgive me, but: as a lifelong politician, Biden isn't  totally honest &amp; hasn't always been a good person...sadly comes w/ the territory. That being said...he's our only hope and INFINITELY more honest, decent, qualified, and AMERICAN than the current POS
BIDEN thinks the 2020 Census is/was/soon to be “two censuses ago”… making this the election of  2040.  Yeah…. “elect this man” POTUS.
Biden? He doesn’t seem to have any burning issues he wants to tackle if elected. (Half the time he can’t remember where he is!) Still don’t know why he’s even running.   Trump’s obnoxious, but he ran with a list of things he wanted to do, and has been DOING IT. Refreshing!
They claimed  was kneeling to support BLM in front of a flag. Instead he was kneeling to draw a 4 yr old in for a sniff.

Yes the Recession that started in 2007, before Obama took office, hit bottom in 2008/09, people forget Obama inherited an economy on the brink of collapse and it took years to recover.  If Biden wins the Republicans will say, "everytime a Democrat takes office the Economy is bad"
Wubya with the A+ reflexes! 45 could never lol. Neither would Biden lol. Quite impressive lol
The thing is that there is no Biden scandal they can fabricate or uncover that is worse than the MANY scandals and failures of Trump and his F team.

Some men create, some men destroy. Trump is a destroyer. Biden is a creater.
I wish Biden knew what is going on. I’d think about voting for him. Unfortunately he doesn’t have a clue😎
That’s all I needed to hear. You’ve got my vote! I’m bringing my +1. My 83 year old mother has flipped. She’s on the Biden train!
A president who doesn’t fund terrorism or abortion receives the harsh sickle knifed into by you Democrats Liberals Brotherhood even in 1793 when you were born you were corrupt you are the  world terrorism which sits on your shoulders like a mallet !  Obama Biden Clinton !
You clearly don't know Biden if you trust him. If you know Biden and trust him then you must be a racist pedophile like he is. He's insulted our black brothers and sisters for decades. Other than a vote he cares nothing about the people of the USA. PROVE ME WRONG!
We saw how the October surprise strategy turned for access Hollywood and trump. At least on the scandal / ethics  front, joe Biden is in better shape than Hillary.
You would think if the trump team or the media or the ‘Russians’ have some dirt on biden roll out they would have by now to create that drumbeat unless they put all marbles on October surprise.
He’s too old and out of it? Hunter Biden hasn’t really caught on ? Biden has not shown up in the #JeffreyEpsteindidntkillhimself #GhislaineMaxwell stuff. The Bernie crowd doesn’t hate Biden like they did Clinton and her surrogates.
Thought this was The Celebration of Life for John Lewis. Certainly NOT a campaign rally for Joe Biden. Completely inappropriate.

Trump and Biden, Demented brothers in mayhem.
My favorites are: 1. WARREN (who’d be the best at governing w/Biden, great policy person, best debater against Pence).  2. HARRIS (but I’d rather see her as AG).  3. RICE (but I’d rather see her as Sec. of State or Natl Security Advisor). All 3 are quality folks. Joe wins w/all.
get the national guard to man the polling sites because I will walk my 64 year old behind across ground glass bare footed to vote for Joe Biden
Nothing more than lying rhetoric so if you lose to Biden, you can contest it and say "its fraudulent, I warned about this" to try and hold onto power.  I'm not buying it.  I've voted through the mail for 12 years.  Not had any issues with it.
funny to read liberal idiots calling TUCKER CARLSON RACIST!!!! Because Tucker doesn't march in step with them. THANK GOD HE DOESN'T. Thank GOD actual SMART people don't march in step with them. Hell even Joe Biden in the polls is starting to lose to TRUMP. Gonna be fun!
Melissa, you may have a lot of words but you need to be able to string them together in a coherent and thoughtful way.   Otherwise you’re just like Joe Biden
I think Biden, like your father, can also identify a picture of an elephant. Unfortunately, you only know it by the tail you cut off after you murder it.
So kind of like Biden 😂😂😂
Absolutely. No question. Heard what #Biden said? Guys an idiot.
Who ?? Biden ??? Cause it fasho ain’t me lol
Biden could pick a flower for all I care I'll STILL VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO
That’s hilarious 😂 especially when Biden’s slogan is I chose “truth over facts”
Because that *is* the Democratic Party. It’s racist, sexist and homophobic. That’s why Biden is the candidate. So many better to pick from but we were told Dems wouldn’t vote for anyone other than a white man.  Huge disappointment in the party beginning in 2016.
You’re either deteriorating faster than Biden or this is a serious cry for help.
Pay tribute? Obama gave a Biden campaign speech! #Communists
LoL. So funny. Just because Biden is unhealthy to be nice. You people are going to try and say our President isn't  healthy. We will say in the debate who is healthy and who is not. #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Of course not because ⁦ ⁦ is a Russian tory! Nunes won't say if he got foreign info meant to damage Biden
To clear it up I don’t think you’re racist if you vote for Biden😂  You just can’t tell someone they racist if they vote for trump , then turn around and endorse another racist
has gotten valise and made information for a UKR source who he setup when he was there. The so call evidence tries to hurt Biden but it’s false and made up .  he was talk to Trump when I found this out
R’s, from top to base, hate their fellow Americans. They’ll take the hit so long as others hurt. It’s telling that the few former trump voters who say they’ll be voting Biden almost all complain about how they’re in pain. Most magas are delighted, even as they’re evicted.
These aren’t the only polls though &amp; Biden’s numbers have drastically fell from last month
I’m a mom and I support Biden. Your father in law is demented.
That wasn't a eulogy. That was a desperate cry for help to elect Biden because they are all f*cked.
If Biden gets elected he's going to be the first president to get bullied by other countries
But Biden spoke at Grand Wizards funeral
Uh, mom here.  What's best for my children is to NOT DIE.  I'll trust Biden to safely open schools, not the Orange Menace who wants to use our kids to improve his poll numbers.
You mean no more "Every night is Purge night in Biden-land" and "Granny got raped and it's Joe Biden's fault"? Because those are the only two commercials I have seen from Trump, and they suck ass.
If it's discovered that Rudy is a regular at Epstein Island...  That will totally ruin Rudy's "evidence" that Biden made billions off Ukraine  Nervous yet Donnie?!?
Thank you, VP Biden.  You're gonna make a hell of a president
Boring Biden is good.  Trump fasism, No Bueno!
Actually neither. Who Biden picks as his VEEP isn't going to change my vote. Joe could pick his imaginary friend from his early childhood as VEEP, I'd still vote for him. 🇺🇸💙🌊
Now do Joe Biden.
He tripled-down at the presser. Denounce him and announce your intention to vote for Biden.
Maybe when Biden gets in office our country will have the political will to try at least?
No President has been comparable to a fascist dictator...until today's attempt to postpone an election (was not even done in Civil War...)  #No.  Reality gives you a binary choice:  Biden &amp; Democracy or Trump &amp; Authoritarianism.  Sadly, it is this black-and-white
The “Cocomelon” videos my toddler watches on YouTube have a bunch of Joe Biden ads. Joe is absolutely going to crush the under 3 demographic. Olivia absolutely hates malarkey.
Trump can’t fuck off too but I would rather have Trump over Biden 10x over
Honestly, I think if we go to Biden it goes back to the good ol boys running things. So I’m pretty up in the air, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Biden won. I wouldn’t stereotype myself as a trumper. Just someone who’s really tired of American politics.
It could, we will see that would mean Biden would have to win. With his voting record he doesn't have the backing the media is claiming.
And that fact that people think we only have Trump and Biden to choose from LUL
People really think Biden is better then Trump.
2021 will be an excellent year with Joe Biden as President..... American democracy will survive the current inept and corrupt fascist regime
I heard you say that Biden's comments on the breakfast club got you upset. I am so happy to hear that. For a minute, I was wondering how could he say such things with out consequence.
Well he only got 7-8% of the black vote in 2016 and won. He has done more for blacks than Obama / Biden so he should get 15-20% of the black vote this time. If he does, he will win by a landslide
I don’t think Joe Biden could do ANYTHING to make this country less safe than it is now, today, under you, your Republican Party, and the Stable Genius/Friend of Dictators and Despots....
This is like the 14th time I've done this to  or   The time to complain about Biden is after change of occupant at 1600 Penn. Ave.  There are more people than just you making sacrifices to vote. #JohnLewis  Squeaker=#Fail - has to be a blowout. 🚫Selfish
Progressive is being co-opted by the middle.  Biden calls himself a progressive.  The back to normalcy crowd just think it sounds nice.
Much respect to you sir. Let's bury the hatchet and act in the best interest of the United States of America! Biden 2020!
Congrats if you're preemptively blaming fellow citizens for Biden's failure  That's exactly what your masters want you to do so you aren't watching their fuckery
If Biden wins, this is a sneak peek of what America will be like. You are an enemy of the people. Treasonous is another way to put it. Coordinate to over throw the Gov is treason. They have too much power! Break them up or hold them accountable.
Much safer in Joe Biden's America than Trump/Pence Russian satellite Fascist country
...EXACTLY.....Q is an INTROSPECTIVE NARCISSISTIC EXCUSE to be lazy and tune out.... besides that...... if Q is our only hope..... WELCOME BIDEN NOW!
GREAT QUESTION for  HOW MANY BLACK AMERICANS have you hired since leaving office? TRUMP HAS HIRED THOUSANDS IN BUSINESS. How many have you hired? 2? 3? or NONE. Tell us!! How many has BIDEN hired? 2? 3? TRUMP BEATS YOU ALL BADLY!
Dr Fauci with Cooper and Gupta again answering viewer questions.   Look at the minds of the people who vote Biden.   "Which schooling option is safer: online, or in person with masks and social distancing?"  #MORONS  REALLY?  That's what we're dealing with. Below idiot I.Q.'s
Right. According to Biden he wasn't black anyway because he was a Trump supporter. According to Dems in power he should have stayed in the gutter where he could have been plyed with food stamps and state assistance. He broke their 'black mold'
You all keep sharing and roasting the “Settle for Biden” accounts as if you all aren’t unironically going to vote for him in November 🤦🏻
Will Joe Biden swear to accept the election result ON ELECTION NIGHT? Or does he intend to use the army of 500+ lawyers he’s assembled to obscure the vote?

No I’m talking to you. You said money is being distributed to biden voters. Which ones? Cuz it wasn’t me. So who do you mean?
Trump is not the root or source of people’s anger. People were angry before and that’s the reason they elected trump because they were tired of the bureaucracy that had been there for so long, Biden is no better than Hillary in fact he’s worse. That’s why I will still vote trump
I'm a mom. You don't speak for me. I'm Ridin with Biden.
Democrats put a criminal and a guy with dementia up against him. Put somebody worth a shit that doesn’t threaten to take away constitutional rights and trump wouldn’t win. We don’t want trump we just really don’t want Clinton and Biden.
This is true.  Anyone supporting Democrats or their policies is by definition a racist and dishonest.  First time voters need to do some serious research... #Biden2020 #Biden2020Landslide #JoeBidenForPresident2020 #JoeBiden #biden #dnc #cnn #cbs #nbc #Democrat #PelosiMustGo

For me we’re effed either way. Biden and trump are both terrible leaders.  I’m going trump because I can’t pay more taxes, support for law enforcement, and fighting against political correct bullshit, Which covers a lot of areas.    Biden is about to make a horrible Vp choice.

Number one, what about the other 44% who aren't ready for schools to reopen, prob because they don't think its safe?   And how many of your 56% only want schools to open if they know it's safe?   Biden cares about our children, Trump does not. Trump only cares about the optics.
No worries.   will play a very important role TBD in the Biden Administration.
Joe Biden has constantly handled China with kid gloves.  President  is the first president in modern history to finally start holding China accountable for their many abuses.  The debate isn't even hard.
WOW O.0 o.0 O.o so many reasons for impeachment. Our system, more than just Congress, is now broken. Needs repair. Needs not-Trump. Needs Biden.
Obviously the media over there are not trying to get Joe Biden elected, much lower bar in terms of truth telling.
Trump is killing us daily but stupid #NeverBiden Bernie Bros are more concerned about Biden mispronouncing a word. Idiots!
I would crawl through a river of shit like Andy Dufresne to vote for Mark Kelly &amp; Joe Biden even if the polls showed them ahead 99% to 1%.  They all need to be humiliated.  Not just defeated.
Trump is actively working against black people but #NeverBiden Bernie bros are more concerned about Biden saying “You ain’t black”. These people are stupid.
And Biden wouldn’t remember WHAT he tweeted 2 minutes later!😂

Trumps self sabotage is making it so Biden doesn’t have to do anything in order to win. If it was competitive, Biden would be more likely to take it on. Joe Biden has hinted since the intermission of the 1st debate that Yang is going to be in his cabinet.
He *also* said, in the same interview,  that she's very beautiful.    Then he followed it up with he'd date her.  And y'all think Biden is creepy because he friendly.
10 Biilion!  The USPS Union endorse Sleepy Biden so the DNC!  Outrageous
Whoever the misinformed woman in the McSally ad is, claiming she'll protect pre-existing conditions, whereas Kelly &amp; Biden will push government insurance, is sorely mistaken. The entire ad is laughable. McSally is disingenuous. Dems want to build on &amp; fix what's broken w/the ACA.
I feel VERY strongly that this is the wrong election to vote 3rd party. I’ve voted 3rd party since 2012, and this year I can’t do that in good conscience. As fucking shitty as Biden is, this election is about our democracy.
Such a problematic process from the Biden campaign
I am done with Biden he has my vote nothing else
Hands off Joe; he's our Asshole.
is Joe Biden Bill Clinton now?  what kind of desperation  does a "GOP" need to  write about Clinton  when Don Trump was  &amp;ucking girls with Epstein
Hey little fella give me your address so I can send you a pair of big blue shoes and a rainbow colored wig. You don’t have to answer the Biden Question, I already know you answer, Biden is not fit. Keep deflecting and telling yourself whatever you to need so you “feel” better.
Joe Biden ad that says all Trump wants is to divide us is perfectly ironic
is Bill running?  I thought it was Biden.
this is priceless.  Epstein partied with Bill Clinton...  and to think I was positive that  it was JOE BIDEN who was running   against donny
Let's let VP Biden make the choice. He will have to work with that person. Get off his back...he has a darn tough job ahead of him. Just give it a rest.
Even Biden had more simultaneous viewers than that
Look there some crazy and goofy people Biden is considering but Bass is in her own league of crazy.

We've all had those moments where you have no idea what the actual hell to Tweet. Just do what I do sometimes. Tweet your thoughts. Or Tweet about how bad of a president Trump is and how much better Biden would be.
Always believe the woman Biden said, right  ?
Rather than do actual work, House Democrats are subpoenaing Secretary Pompeo because they think he helped "advance a conspiracy theory" about Joe Biden.  We're in the middle of a pandemic, and this is what Democrats are doing right now.
Hope you’re wrong Mike, he needs spirited youthful look that leaves Harris who was quite close to Biden family. No grudges palm note may be the clue?
Why oh why do democrats eat their own? ANY woman Biden picks will be fine. They are ALL excellent. Plus...they will be debating a Qtip.
That’s Joe Biden statement.” You bet Joe will keep us safe.”
Oh they will accept it. We've had to accept the criminal in the WH for four years. We are going to follow the law. Let's make that loud and clear. When trump loses, the military steps in  Poll: Most Trump voters say they won't accept results if Biden wins
Biden won’t know who he is or where he is by next week.
Completely shitty editors can’t even doctor up a film of President Trump to sounds real. I post actual film of Biden and you come with that trash. Sucks to be you. Sad how you just turn a blind eye to racism and sexual abuse when it’s laid out right in front of you. Disgusting.
Compare &amp; Contrast! e.g. Biden/Obama left cupboard bare! Give stats on their PPE, Tests, Medicine, Ventilators, etc. than give yours. Bullet Points. People like bullet points, not prose! Message!
Also, Biden will bring that by himself. Susan Rice is the only one who covers your points - and they aren't the most important. And, again, Biden covers rebuilding ally's trust all by himself.
That all article has Trump saying he disavowed Duke and does not want that support.  You hate it because Biden never said that about Byrd.  You can’t cover for this plain and simple, Biden loved this KKK POS!!!
No doubt Juan heard Biden differently than Emily. Suspect Juan heara Biden differently than everyone does. #TheFive
🤣🤣🤣 You liberals are a treat. Anything to deflect. Still avoiding the Biden question. It must be exhausting being a liberal. Mental Gymnastics all day long.
Last time was Biden. He told Obama he would not be running. But I'm not holding that against him now because he was the consensus candidate who can beat Trump.
And he's blaming the Portland stuff on Biden.  He said this will be Biden's way if Biden is elected president.   What bullshit!!
Really not though. Biden became VP partly because he told Obama he'd have to Presidential ambitions - or none that would interfere for 8 years. They did well.
Biden has never said Defund the police! And everything you just said about Biden is exactly to a T describing Trump! But add lying, fake conspiracy theories and blame everybody but himself mentality! And it takes somebody with those same characteristics to vote for him
Where's hunter Biden?
This a.m. on ABC15 PHX I saw two "Joe Biden's America" ads on the morning news. Of course the footage of destruction is from tRUmp's America.
Here we go...1st of 3 debates to go..,chickenshit blow hard Biden backs out !
Clintons are the absolute worse among the privileged assholes sharing the government monopoly we all must deal with as it crushes us beneath barely hidden racism &amp; fascism Biden, another architect of misery, could do even worse than Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. Let that sink in.
A Biden/Harris ticket would be MONEY. I know there are some amazing choices, but come on people. This ticket would clean house.

Who cares. When Biden loses, they will be a trivia question
I've been told that i'm smarter than Joe Biden, so lets give this test of yours a try...  Uhhh / Duhhh / Doyeee / Durrr / Huhhh
I think it is you, who are running scared. If you are Biden's VP choice, your arrogance, unlike ability and baggage will lose the election for him for sure.
NO plan is Biden's plan. He's incapable of making any cohesive plan for anything. He says what his handlers tell him to say, and often he botches that. Tragic they are forcing this man to be their puppet, placeholder.
I’m going  because not voting for Biden. Never ever choosing a “lesser evil” again because there is no such thing in politics.
I'm pretty angry #Tsarnev will get another shot at life.  #BostonBomber Russia tried to warn Biden Obama and Hillary, but she let them in anyway.  Instead of treating him like an American, he should have his VISA revoked and let Chechnya or ? deal with his illegal *ss.
This is a LIE - Does he ever provide details on the internal polls? It is probably just his family &amp; Stephen Miller, 100% Trump, none of them want Biden
🤔 you’re sounding a lot like bumbling Biden these days. Might want to check your meds, something is definitely off.
Terrible for Blacks. Over several decades,  criminal-justice system more punitive than any other advanced democracy’s.   Biden crafted the 1994 crime bill,  preferred to call it (as recently as 2015), the “1994 Biden" bill.
Actually, men (and women) HAVE said that about Biden. It's why nobody expects him to run in 2024 and are looking to his VP to carry on his administration's legacy instead.
8 miserable destructive yrs under Obama/Biden. Foreclosures on homes..jobs lost..people on food stamps &amp; welfare. People lost hope by the evil run government. Pres trump brought back hope &amp; patriotism back to America. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 🇺🇸
These men are afraid Kamala Harris will challenge the white male stranglehold on politics, and it's exactly why Biden should pick Harris. White men had their shot and they've damn near destroyed the republic. Go play golf, Ed, your time is over.
Sadly, Yes.  Come January 21st, I will start letting my complaints about Biden be known.  I hear you, and since I'm not a Black woman, I'll follow you on this for sure.
Uhmm, you shouldn't add those 2 together... It's % of voters by voting type. So you add the same voting type/different candidates together to get 100% (if you include 3rd party).   So for by mail: Biden (32) +Trump (65) +3rd party (3)  =100%.
You’re still on this?? And YES, I am voting Biden. Not excited about it, but it’s necessary. And my profile used to say MAGA.  No more. (Independent now, for Biden.)
Exactly! Biden is running a campaign video in Arizona with Trump holding a Bible like it's a bad thing. Incredible. smh.

How insulting that Trump &amp; Pence think that we’re so stupid to think that Biden (who is universally respected) will destroy the country anymore than they have in one term. I have never felt less safe than I do now with Trump/Pence at the helm.

I dunno, I feel like considering Joe Biden's age, the person he chooses as VP really ought to be ready to become the president.
Sum bout how hard Joe Biden tryna get down with the niggas don’t sit right wit me 🧐
Good grief,  please cut the sexist crap. ALL presidential candidates and former candidates have a sizable ego... as do you. Was Biden a bad VP because he eventually ran for president himself... a third time? Or was that okay because he’s a man?
And we are still in Iraq. Biden voted and supported the Iraq war for years. Same with Afghanistan war. Dems and Republicans are equally responsible. Let's not forget who put Trump there, the Dems.
Actually, I’m for Biden. But if most Americans do vote by mail (if millions do!), then it’ll take weeks to get a result. And there will be all kinds of problems.   Remember Florida in 2000?   But, I’m bored with this.. Bye.💋

I just want a fair election. If there’s any fraud, it’ll most likely benefit Biden.  For “the world’s greatest democracy”, voting in the USA is very sloppy. Now no one wants anyone to show ID to vote, and now “mass mailing” of ballots to millions of people.

Where is Joe Biden's leadership during this pandemic. Nothing but effortless platitudes and sloganeering from the "great" (non)leader.
I really don’t think he’s much better, before covid im not sure there’s anything Trump was doing to run the country into the ground. One thing Biden would be better at is uniting the country over racial injustice.
I suspect the Democrat plan is for Biden and his female VP to enter the White House, then after a short time Biden will resign as President and the US will have its first Woman President.
"We've all ordered from Wish. Com and it looks one way on your fire tablet, you get it and it's Joe Biden" 😂
Do you think Biden should even bother debating him?
Is Biden better? They both suck. How have we came to this? Best thing Is that corna keeps up so Biden doesn’t have to debate, you know that. I just don’t understand how these are the two candidates. It’s crazy
Chica, I totally agree. I was just thinking this morning that maybe I should take a week off and bury my head in the sand w the rest. Extreme precaution w Covid and ridin’ w Biden but I’m exhausted. Not sleeping and go to bed w disgust and wake up the same.
So, what are we thinking?  A Biden/Pelosi ticket?  Haven't heard rumors on that front-- why not?
Trump can't navigate a handicapped ramp without help,  drink with one hand, and can't answer a simple question without automatically rambling on about an unrelated subject.  Biden has had a stutter his whole life he has worked to overcome. Maybe fuck yourself with that bullshit.
Trump has disavowed David Duke &amp; KKK multiple times over the years.   Not once but multiple times over many many years. Can't wait for your lefty spin on this one.  Did Biden disavow Byrd?
Not sold on IA or MT electing Democratic Senators while also voting for Trump. If anything you'd see split ticketing the other way, a vote for Biden but a Republican Senate as a check.
Biden was partly or mostly behind:  Crime bill, bankruptcy bill, police militarization, Iraq War, coups in Latin America, etc...  I don't support Trump nor Biden   I have great issues with someone xenophobically pushing the debunked russiagate instead of focusing on real issues.

Dems are always loaded with “passion.” Biden won’t have to pick on that one quality- it’s everywhere in excess.
Honestly if the trump wing of the party gets beaten down hard enough and Biden pushes for compromise they could caucus a few republicans.
This is what they do, and the very reason Biden is hidden in a basement somewhere. They have the next election so rigged he doesn't have to attend a debate or campaign. It terrifying actually.

The CCP is not our friend. They have made that very clear for decades. Ignore the propaganda and hit the CCP even harder. All the more reason to keep Biden out. He has been peter puffing  The CCP his entire career.
1.) Character limit 2.) Personally disliking someone and policies are different.  I dislike Biden and Obama too but all for various reasons
The great thing is that both these great women will be part of the Biden team, along with an amazing list of others. Finally, no empty positions, no temporary and unqualified idiots, not suck ups who only care about their own gain.
Well no, it's not ok. Biden has it in his head that joking about Trump's tweets is something that people care about when in reality nobody really gives a fuck about trump vs Bidens tweets, people just need healthcare. Honestly it's not that hard to understand

This is 2016 all over again...the closer we get to the election the crazier the Dems get and common sense tells me they are losing and they know it.  The 12% advantage Biden supposedly had in polls a week ago has now lost 30% of that advantage.  More BS just like Russia!
I disagree. Biden has an important skill that Trump has proven is critically lacking in his Admin. Biden can &amp; will build a team of our country’s best to run our agencies &amp; fill his cabinet. Trump has run off the best of the Republicans. We have a fourth string team under him.
It's the attempt to bypass #VoterID.  We don't believe in 112% voting counting dead people and illegal citizens, while Obama/Biden/Dems do think it's okie dokie.  #VoterFraud
If President Biden and team go after him yes. I think alot more criminal activity will be found after hes gone.
There are no candidates right now actually qualified for president. Trump can't handle a  Pandemic or protests. Biden is the architect of our issues. Jo just wants nothing left. Howie parrots Russiagate.

My point is that you are all jargon, soundbites and no perspective. Your meme is, of course, without any testable arguments. What was supposed to do that he failed to deliver? On the opposite end, can you name something he's done well? Do you know Biden is my point?
I’m not a Trumpster.   I’m voting for Biden.  Although still haven’t heard him say what he wants to do.  (And he’s been around 40 years and hasn’t done much yet.) But Trump’s just too divisive for his few good ideas.
Trump probably wants to delay the election so he can stay in the White House for a little while longer...  Funny that he thinks he has so much power. He thinks he's a king. He's probably scared of the election because he knows he isn't going to win against Biden.

The problem is when you run a business you should know your customers might be either Democrats or Republicans. To respect all his customers he should have kept the flag for his home or maybe his office. Knowing it will offend people just like if it was a Biden flag Common sense

Look at Biden's history of failure. It's right there to see. Can you give us one thing he has accomplished?
His comment did stereotype, which itself is not cool. I agree with you and so does a good chunk of Americans. That doesn't make him a racist. Biden isn't perfect, but he's done more for this country than you know. At least read his Wikipedia page. :)
I think Susan Rice. Its just a feeling. But she is close to Biden has executive experience as ambassador to the UN, and has no legislative baggage.
Thank you 🙏🏽 pray no Biden he said he will undo all Trump has done !
We have two bad choices for President in 202, but if you were truly capable of demonstrating objectivity you would see that Trump is much more dangerous to our national security &amp; rule of law than Biden.   When Trumps interests conflict w/the nation’s, he serves himself above all
I'm not a racist period...never have been nor will I be. You're drawing your own conclusions from a soundbite taken out of context. If Biden was racist, it would be clear...like Trump. Trump publicly demonstrates it.

News Flash the Obama/Biden administration used up the national stock pile of PPE's and other medical supplies needlessly for the h1n1 virus and didn't replenish the stock piles they used up.... News Flash the GDP is only 9.32% down from last year.  News Flash before the virus....
But Biden is better? Come on now Mario wake up
Joe Biden is an actual racist. 🤣 Seeing Dems praise him while calling Trump supporters racist for supporting Trump is comedy Gold. What half-wits.
FACT CHECK:  Biden did not explicitly tie xenophobia to the travel restriction. His tweet reflects coronavirus remarks he made during a campaign stop in Iowa Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced.
FACT CHECK:  Biden tweeted: "We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump's record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency."
Joe Biden is literally everything the left claims Trump is. So I find this whole election to be rather amusing.

So who's running with Biden cause Obama ain't saying shit about that's my dawg
Forgive me, but: as a lifelong politician, Biden isn't  totally honest &amp; hasn't always been a good person...sadly comes w/ the territory. That being said...he's our only hope and INFINITELY more honest, decent, qualified, and AMERICAN than the current POS
BIDEN thinks the 2020 Census is/was/soon to be “two censuses ago”… making this the election of  2040.  Yeah…. “elect this man” POTUS.
Biden? He doesn’t seem to have any burning issues he wants to tackle if elected. (Half the time he can’t remember where he is!) Still don’t know why he’s even running.   Trump’s obnoxious, but he ran with a list of things he wanted to do, and has been DOING IT. Refreshing!
They claimed  was kneeling to support BLM in front of a flag. Instead he was kneeling to draw a 4 yr old in for a sniff.
Gutfeld on Joe Biden's 'America First' strategy  via
Yes the Recession that started in 2007, before Obama took office, hit bottom in 2008/09, people forget Obama inherited an economy on the brink of collapse and it took years to recover.  If Biden wins the Republicans will say, "everytime a Democrat takes office the Economy is bad"
Wubya with the A+ reflexes! 45 could never lol. Neither would Biden lol. Quite impressive lol
The thing is that there is no Biden scandal they can fabricate or uncover that is worse than the MANY scandals and failures of Trump and his F team.
Chicken little speaking again, don’t worry you will lose to Biden
Calculated twitter bomb, just as many of the others. Create intense angst on the left, MSM and Biden Campaign. The distractions and intense hateful smears propel President Trump to the WIN!
You may not personally like trump but can upu see biden taking on the chinese, iraq or Russia?  Get ready for taxes to skyrocket...... just know what you are voting for
Exactly, a calculated twitter bomb. Create such a ruckus, hysteria and distraction on the left, MSM, and Biden campaign... Trump cruises to the WIN!
Biden can’t help it.  He’s sick
Joe Biden will NOT be my president lmao sorry
Can we all admit that all the people who should run for president are too smart to run? There’s no way Biden or Trump should be president. We are so screwed

A tweet from #Biden in OCTOBER! #RealPresident
Some men create, some men destroy. Trump is a destroyer. Biden is a creater.
I wish Biden knew what is going on. I’d think about voting for him. Unfortunately he doesn’t have a clue😎
That’s all I needed to hear. You’ve got my vote! I’m bringing my +1. My 83 year old mother has flipped. She’s on the Biden train!
A president who doesn’t fund terrorism or abortion receives the harsh sickle knifed into by you Democrats Liberals Brotherhood even in 1793 when you were born you were corrupt you are the  world terrorism which sits on your shoulders like a mallet !  Obama Biden Clinton !
You clearly don't know Biden if you trust him. If you know Biden and trust him then you must be a racist pedophile like he is. He's insulted our black brothers and sisters for decades. Other than a vote he cares nothing about the people of the USA. PROVE ME WRONG!
We saw how the October surprise strategy turned for access Hollywood and trump. At least on the scandal / ethics  front, joe Biden is in better shape than Hillary.
You would think if the trump team or the media or the ‘Russians’ have some dirt on biden roll out they would have by now to create that drumbeat unless they put all marbles on October surprise.
He’s too old and out of it? Hunter Biden hasn’t really caught on ? Biden has not shown up in the #JeffreyEpsteindidntkillhimself #GhislaineMaxwell stuff. The Bernie crowd doesn’t hate Biden like they did Clinton and her surrogates.
Thought this was The Celebration of Life for John Lewis. Certainly NOT a campaign rally for Joe Biden. Completely inappropriate.

Trump and Biden, Demented brothers in mayhem.
My favorites are: 1. WARREN (who’d be the best at governing w/Biden, great policy person, best debater against Pence).  2. HARRIS (but I’d rather see her as AG).  3. RICE (but I’d rather see her as Sec. of State or Natl Security Advisor). All 3 are quality folks. Joe wins w/all.
get the national guard to man the polling sites because I will walk my 64 year old behind across ground glass bare footed to vote for Joe Biden
When Trump shut down travel Biden and Bernie called him racist but like, was that not exactly what was needed? They actively sabotaged Trump at our expense. And both parties passed those horrid bailout bills. Only Massie, a Kentucky Republican, was honest with us about that.
Does that address Biden?  Oh I guess not. Nice diversion
Nothing more than lying rhetoric so if you lose to Biden, you can contest it and say "its fraudulent, I warned about this" to try and hold onto power.  I'm not buying it.  I've voted through the mail for 12 years.  Not had any issues with it.
funny to read liberal idiots calling TUCKER CARLSON RACIST!!!! Because Tucker doesn't march in step with them. THANK GOD HE DOESN'T. Thank GOD actual SMART people don't march in step with them. Hell even Joe Biden in the polls is starting to lose to TRUMP. Gonna be fun!
Melissa, you may have a lot of words but you need to be able to string them together in a coherent and thoughtful way.   Otherwise you’re just like Joe Biden
I think Biden, like your father, can also identify a picture of an elephant. Unfortunately, you only know it by the tail you cut off after you murder it.
So kind of like Biden 😂😂😂
Absolutely. No question. Heard what #Biden said? Guys an idiot.
Who ?? Biden ??? Cause it fasho ain’t me lol
Biden could pick a flower for all I care I'll STILL VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO
That’s hilarious 😂 especially when Biden’s slogan is I chose “truth over facts”
Because that *is* the Democratic Party. It’s racist, sexist and homophobic. That’s why Biden is the candidate. So many better to pick from but we were told Dems wouldn’t vote for anyone other than a white man.  Huge disappointment in the party beginning in 2016.
You’re either deteriorating faster than Biden or this is a serious cry for help.
Pay tribute? Obama gave a Biden campaign speech! #Communists
LoL. So funny. Just because Biden is unhealthy to be nice. You people are going to try and say our President isn't  healthy. We will say in the debate who is healthy and who is not. #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Of course not because ⁦ ⁦ is a Russian tory! Nunes won't say if he got foreign info meant to damage Biden
To clear it up I don’t think you’re racist if you vote for Biden😂  You just can’t tell someone they racist if they vote for trump , then turn around and endorse another racist
has gotten valise and made information for a UKR source who he setup when he was there. The so call evidence tries to hurt Biden but it’s false and made up .  he was talk to Trump when I found this out
R’s, from top to base, hate their fellow Americans. They’ll take the hit so long as others hurt. It’s telling that the few former trump voters who say they’ll be voting Biden almost all complain about how they’re in pain. Most magas are delighted, even as they’re evicted.
These aren’t the only polls though &amp; Biden’s numbers have drastically fell from last month
I’m a mom and I support Biden. Your father in law is demented.
That wasn't a eulogy. That was a desperate cry for help to elect Biden because they are all f*cked.
This is the truth behind why CHINA JOE BIDEN is acting how he is acting  To say he has DEMENTIA would lesson the jail sentence he might get if POTUS TRUMP &amp; true REPUBLICANS would investigate a life time 40+year government official&amp; family has become a millionaires on tax dollars
If Biden gets elected he's going to be the first president to get bullied by other countries
But Biden spoke at Grand Wizards funeral
Uh, mom here.  What's best for my children is to NOT DIE.  I'll trust Biden to safely open schools, not the Orange Menace who wants to use our kids to improve his poll numbers.
You mean no more "Every night is Purge night in Biden-land" and "Granny got raped and it's Joe Biden's fault"? Because those are the only two commercials I have seen from Trump, and they suck ass.
If it's discovered that Rudy is a regular at Epstein Island...  That will totally ruin Rudy's "evidence" that Biden made billions off Ukraine  Nervous yet Donnie?!?
You should be more concerned with how bad Joe Biden is going to lose...the only positive things is that his dementia will stop him from comprehending the beating he received....
Thank you, VP Biden.  You're gonna make a hell of a president
Boring Biden is good.  Trump fasism, No Bueno!
Actually neither. Who Biden picks as his VEEP isn't going to change my vote. Joe could pick his imaginary friend from his early childhood as VEEP, I'd still vote for him. 🇺🇸💙🌊
Now do Joe Biden.
He tripled-down at the presser. Denounce him and announce your intention to vote for Biden.
Maybe when Biden gets in office our country will have the political will to try at least?
No President has been comparable to a fascist dictator...until today's attempt to postpone an election (was not even done in Civil War...)  #No.  Reality gives you a binary choice:  Biden &amp; Democracy or Trump &amp; Authoritarianism.  Sadly, it is this black-and-white
I do agree with you that Biden is a bad candidate. So, we do have something in common there.
The “Cocomelon” videos my toddler watches on YouTube have a bunch of Joe Biden ads. Joe is absolutely going to crush the under 3 demographic. Olivia absolutely hates malarkey.
Trump can’t fuck off too but I would rather have Trump over Biden 10x over
Honestly, I think if we go to Biden it goes back to the good ol boys running things. So I’m pretty up in the air, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Biden won. I wouldn’t stereotype myself as a trumper. Just someone who’s really tired of American politics.
It could, we will see that would mean Biden would have to win. With his voting record he doesn't have the backing the media is claiming.
And that fact that people think we only have Trump and Biden to choose from LUL
People really think Biden is better then Trump.
He needs to pick a VP with 2 brains since Biden has lost his!
2021 will be an excellent year with Joe Biden as President..... American democracy will survive the current inept and corrupt fascist regime
I heard you say that Biden's comments on the breakfast club got you upset. I am so happy to hear that. For a minute, I was wondering how could he say such things with out consequence.
Well he only got 7-8% of the black vote in 2016 and won. He has done more for blacks than Obama / Biden so he should get 15-20% of the black vote this time. If he does, he will win by a landslide
I don’t think Joe Biden could do ANYTHING to make this country less safe than it is now, today, under you, your Republican Party, and the Stable Genius/Friend of Dictators and Despots....
This is like the 14th time I've done this to  or   The time to complain about Biden is after change of occupant at 1600 Penn. Ave.  There are more people than just you making sacrifices to vote. #JohnLewis  Squeaker=#Fail - has to be a blowout. 🚫Selfish
Progressive is being co-opted by the middle.  Biden calls himself a progressive.  The back to normalcy crowd just think it sounds nice.
Much respect to you sir. Let's bury the hatchet and act in the best interest of the United States of America! Biden 2020!
Congrats if you're preemptively blaming fellow citizens for Biden's failure  That's exactly what your masters want you to do so you aren't watching their fuckery
If Biden wins, this is a sneak peek of what America will be like. You are an enemy of the people. Treasonous is another way to put it. Coordinate to over throw the Gov is treason. They have too much power! Break them up or hold them accountable.
We moms will decide that for ourselves. And I’d choose Biden a kajillion trillion times over Trump.
Much safer in Joe Biden's America than Trump/Pence Russian satellite Fascist country
...EXACTLY.....Q is an INTROSPECTIVE NARCISSISTIC EXCUSE to be lazy and tune out.... besides that...... if Q is our only hope..... WELCOME BIDEN NOW!
GREAT QUESTION for  HOW MANY BLACK AMERICANS have you hired since leaving office? TRUMP HAS HIRED THOUSANDS IN BUSINESS. How many have you hired? 2? 3? or NONE. Tell us!! How many has BIDEN hired? 2? 3? TRUMP BEATS YOU ALL BADLY!
Dr Fauci with Cooper and Gupta again answering viewer questions.   Look at the minds of the people who vote Biden.   "Which schooling option is safer: online, or in person with masks and social distancing?"  #MORONS  REALLY?  That's what we're dealing with. Below idiot I.Q.'s
Biden tells teachers Trump must offer plan to keep schools safe amid COVID-19 strike threat
Right. According to Biden he wasn't black anyway because he was a Trump supporter. According to Dems in power he should have stayed in the gutter where he could have been plyed with food stamps and state assistance. He broke their 'black mold'
You all keep sharing and roasting the “Settle for Biden” accounts as if you all aren’t unironically going to vote for him in November 🤦🏻
What has Joe Biden done?
Will Joe Biden swear to accept the election result ON ELECTION NIGHT? Or does he intend to use the army of 500+ lawyers he’s assembled to obscure the vote?
Want to energize independents and conservatives in the United States then have Obama campaign for Biden! #Trump2020
I'm okay with not finding out until January, on the night before Biden is sworn in.
Remember the old adage “United We Stand, Divided We Fall”? Joe Biden will create much more division than the Left already has. This country will burn at his feet.
Do we really want Joe dementia Biden to be our next president? Hell no!!
How are they going to open. What is the plan. You Republicans keep screaming open open open but you don't have no plan. After Joe Biden is President we will have a plan

No I’m talking to you. You said money is being distributed to biden voters. Which ones? Cuz it wasn’t me. So who do you mean?
Trump is not the root or source of people’s anger. People were angry before and that’s the reason they elected trump because they were tired of the bureaucracy that had been there for so long, Biden is no better than Hillary in fact he’s worse. That’s why I will still vote trump
I'm a mom. You don't speak for me. I'm Ridin with Biden.
He’s listening to doctors and scientists unlike you folks who believe in conspiracy theories and untruths.  Don’t you worry your pretty little head off Kimmie, moms and grandmothers like me will be voting for Joe Biden. Now go eat some cake.
Democrats put a criminal and a guy with dementia up against him. Put somebody worth a shit that doesn’t threaten to take away constitutional rights and trump wouldn’t win. We don’t want trump we just really don’t want Clinton and Biden.
This is true.  Anyone supporting Democrats or their policies is by definition a racist and dishonest.  First time voters need to do some serious research... #Biden2020 #Biden2020Landslide #JoeBidenForPresident2020 #JoeBiden #biden #dnc #cnn #cbs #nbc #Democrat #PelosiMustGo

Who the f knows? You and I know Biden should be toast but WTF!
That’s ok Biden will bring it back and better and Trump won’t be able to do a damn thing out of office but take his upside down Bible and his form of Christianity which is none and pry for the courts to not prosecute his Demonic sex offender ass! Who’s Lying?
For me we’re effed either way. Biden and trump are both terrible leaders.  I’m going trump because I can’t pay more taxes, support for law enforcement, and fighting against political correct bullshit, Which covers a lot of areas.    Biden is about to make a horrible Vp choice.

Number one, what about the other 44% who aren't ready for schools to reopen, prob because they don't think its safe?   And how many of your 56% only want schools to open if they know it's safe?   Biden cares about our children, Trump does not. Trump only cares about the optics.
No worries.   will play a very important role TBD in the Biden Administration.
Joe Biden has constantly handled China with kid gloves.  President  is the first president in modern history to finally start holding China accountable for their many abuses.  The debate isn't even hard.
WOW O.0 o.0 O.o so many reasons for impeachment. Our system, more than just Congress, is now broken. Needs repair. Needs not-Trump. Needs Biden.
Obviously the media over there are not trying to get Joe Biden elected, much lower bar in terms of truth telling.
Trump is killing us daily but stupid #NeverBiden Bernie Bros are more concerned about Biden mispronouncing a word. Idiots!
I would crawl through a river of shit like Andy Dufresne to vote for Mark Kelly &amp; Joe Biden even if the polls showed them ahead 99% to 1%.  They all need to be humiliated.  Not just defeated.
Trump is actively working against black people but #NeverBiden Bernie bros are more concerned about Biden saying “You ain’t black”. These people are stupid.
Here's your boy with a known KKK Chapter President!!!

I am just so blown away by this thread. Still crying. No wonder Barack Obama chose THIS man, Joe Biden, to be his VP.
Not on my wish list, but she is definitely qualified and I will vote Biden, whomever he picks.
Omg what an incredible piece. I thank you for it and can honestly say I have never been MORE for Joe Biden as our President, than I am right now. Still crying as I type.
Is this why to felt you and Biden could illegally use the fisa courts against our current president? And Obama works to keep those old race wounds festering - rather then working towards peace.

Biden should choose Obama for his VP.
LMAO don't want to talk about any of the criminal issues Obama had? How about Biden getting his son out of trouble not once but twice in Ukraine? Why is Biden under Criminal indictment for the same things you all impeached trump for? I'm curious why the hypocrisy?
Yeah Jonathan or whatever your name is please make sure to apologize to the future president joe Biden for your nonsense.
Not all during any other administration LMAO Like when Obama/Biden paid Iran after they had bounties on American troops? Fast and Furious where the Obama admin was giving guns to drug cartels....shall we continue. Every president has had their shit.
I'll throw in Seminole County. It hasn't gone for a democratic president since Truman in 1948 and Biden will likely need to win it by a few points.
Won't happen, although Biden could crack 400-plus Electoral College votes.
They'll have to lose four election cycles to change, and they won't. They'll fight Biden tooth and nail till the 2022 midterm, lose with whomever they pick in 2024, but likely gain seats in 2026 because Americans have short memories.

Joe Biden warns that Donald Trump may try to delay November election | Joe Biden | The Guardian
I hope that this is a chance for you to expose even more wrongdoings on behalf of the cabal. Hopefully you will freely mention publicly Valerie Jarrett Barack Obama Joe Biden Comey and the rest. Use it to make a public spectacle of the coup
Biden also supports closing down charter schools and doing away with school choice programs. He is a tool of the Teacher’s Union.  I hope that makes every inner city mom happy to see their children held captive in the under performing public school system.
If Biden wins the election, he only needs to hold the office for 90 days, then he could step down ( due to health reasons) and his female V.P. would automatically step in and become the President. 😳
I think she would do nicely ? Although I hope Biden has chilled his frat boy ways cause she I do not think put up with it.
All these commentators were referring to Biden
Then I guess trump shouldn’t be trying to delegitimize his win, if he’s so confident he can beat Biden.

Give me one reason you're voting for Biden without using the word Trump
We will see. People in the media and his fellow colleagues have been saying hes more left now than hes ever been before. Some people can change, and biden will bring about change. Remember hes only going to last one term, so VP is more important tbh
Joe Biden is going to try and refuse to debate Donald Trump. He cannot hold a thought or keep a conversation for more than 30 seconds. He will be a coward and refuse to debate.
Yep. And Donald Trump will win!  A delay would probably benefit the Biden campaign. He will become less and less cognizant and people will have more confidence his VP will take over quickly - that is the strategy on the left, isn’t it?
He wasn’t a Democratic activist. He was kicked out. He hated Biden. He hated BLM, he hated  the Obamas, Clinton’s. That is no Democratic activist. and all his rhetoric is straight out of Trumps playbook.He is a very sick person.
Donald Trump may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the best medicine usually is not the best tasting. Joe Biden is barely a PLACEBO - and whoever his running mate is will be the typical nasty side effects!
Bernie's supporting him, helping election. Biden's the candidate to save our democracy. He has progressive wants in his plan. Do you even know what his plan contains. Bernie people must vote for bernie. Four more years of trump will mean we NEVER have Bernie's vision inplemented.
Trump has a chance to beat Biden just like he beat Hillary. #2020election #DemocraticParty #Democrats #DonaldTrump #Pennsylvania #politics #RepublicanParty #Republicans #TWJReports
Me too. I love  But I don’t think Biden is showcasing a joint Biden/Warren fundraiser on the Fri before announcing his VP choice if it’s her. Gotta believe Warren knows it’s not her. This is a Dem “unity” sign &amp; Warren’s a super fundraiser. Do it before she’s not picked.
In other news, Trump has stopped endlessly running those Biden/anarchy &amp; violence ads here in PHX.
Longing for Joe Biden as president.😊
And neither is Biden!
NAFTA, crime bill, Iraq war, Patriot Act.Trump isn’t good on these things either but he reason he won in 2016 was by opposing those things.All he has to do is remind America who Biden really is and that’s all they should need. Instead they act like they’re running against Bernie
Idk the Trump campaign and his mouthpieces on Fox News really appear to be dropping the ball to me. Nobody who’s been alive more than 10 years seriously believes that Biden is a “radical leftist”. They could focus on Biden’s record of policies he supported that got Trump elected.
But media will immediately give them all a free pass.
Thank God Joe Biden is not in charge now. Death toll would be tripled

Biden's gaffes are becoming more and more concerning as the election draws nearer.
What won't? Lol Biden or Trump? I think they both are a joke.
I emphasize listening to both political sides for a reason.  But a huge one is how the Right views the state of country and its radical liberalism. If Biden wins, its easier to see how the pendulum will swing to the radical right out of resentment..  Lowering chances of #yang2024

Barack Obama oversaw the most corrupt administration in American history:  —Obamagate —IRS Targeting —Biden &amp; Ukraine —Benghazi —Fast &amp; Furious —Solyndra —Cash to Iran —Hillary’s Emails —Uranium One —The VA Cover Up  We should be holding him accountable, not celebrating him.
Biden has my vote..it doesn't matter to me who he  wants for vice president... the main thing Trump must go
Its funny how people who say Biden is the lesser evil get mad when you point out why he’s evil and say you’re helping Trump.
I didn't like how she treated Biden..I can forgive but I'll never forget..
I hope all the billionaires - Bloomberg, Steyer, etc.-  give Biden all the money he needs to advertise in every possible state than can turn blue!

Trump is a symptom  Hillary was symptom  Is Biden a symptom or is he the good guy leading us out of this corrupt political grid lock where politicians balance special interests and our existential needs?   Because I’m pretty sure that’s why Trumps even a symptom......
Hope everyone young and old understands not voting or voting for anyone other than Biden is giving the vote to Bunker Boy and we can’t do another 4 years!!!!
Ultimately, it's going to come down to either it backfires and governors/GOP turns on Trump to save their hides (which likely still costs them all the election if even 25% of Trumpists don't vote at all) or the military personally escorts Trump out of the WH, legitimize Biden.
What the f*** new source are you watching Joe Biden proudly declared that he would defund the police. just as the rest of the democratic party has cloudly declared to defend the police and when asked about it they said no not move money out of the police completely defund
Nobody suggests leaving a fascist in office. We suggest not helping Republicans install a different one in Biden whom they prefer to Trump.
I will be casting my early vote by mail for Biden. #AZforBiden
If everyone was to vote, majority would be Trump. We can see that because look at the handful of cities that are in chaos. Those are the only cities voting Dem.  And Biden is in a condition to run a country?  Logic seems to be scarce these days, huh ?

What emergency powers can Nero have that were not granted by the Congress? I would suggest that after Benedict Donald is gone Congress revoke powers that have been bestowed upon the presidency since WW2, but of course Democrats will want to keep those same powers for Biden.
Hint, hint Biden.
We were under fascism before Trump and will be under it with Biden.
You know, if Biden continues to do nothing after he’s president his approval as president may go higher than Trumps.
Jonathan Turley, we're all waiting for your apology to Joe Biden and acknowledgement that his "prediction" was actually 100 percent accurate.
Day before might have too much in motion or sent in Though a Friday night news dump would cause panic and a lot of scrambling issue is that it’s Halloween. Might be a week before Election Day. My issue is if military will remain divided or follow Biden if he wins in landslide
I wonder if Obama would be pro vote by mail if the Postal Union had endorsed Trump and not Biden?
Why didn't Joe Biden leave his basement to go to John Lewis' funeral? Was it because he has been a lifelong advocate for segregation and racist policies?
Fun fact: if an election isn't held by January 2021, Constitutionally speaking, both his and Pence's terms are up and the presidency falls to a Dem (i.e. Pelosi or, if she loses, Pat Leahy in the Senate). So effectively, if he does it, he screws up worse than just losing to Biden
Typical biden rally numbers, I'd say.  😂
I agree.Personally I want Elizabeth Warren as VP but to be honest, at this point I’m voting for a rock over trump.Also, I will vote for Biden/Harris.But I also know, they are just stop gap for the next four years.I know they won’t get re-elected but getting trump out is the goal

I love Kamala Harris, but Biden will win California without her.  Better choice is Val Demings of Florida.  She is an African American woman who is a former police chief and is now in congress.  Gets Biden law and order votes and a win in Florida.  Make Kamala Attorney General!
If you are going to make stuff up at least do a better job of writing it 😂 my co workers wife whose husband? Joe Biden is becoming Contagious. 😂
And polls show Basement Biden in the lead... yea ok!
Given how soft spoken and easy going Biden is I personally think Harris would be a great match for him.  Because he has one heck of a mess to clean up and will need a courageous woman in there. But I’m voting Biden even if he runs with Brittany Spears.

I just checked  's following list, and all he follows are blue-checks. No average Americans like me.   is even worse. Most of the accounts he follows have the word Biden in them.
The Constitution is only accepted as legitimate if the people deem it so. If 1/2 of Congress, the military, police and 1/2 the country believe that Biden is unlawfully walking up to the White House to be sworn in, then it's a constitutional crisis &amp; we end up w/ 2 Presidents.
Why does that never happen?!   How has nobody questioned Hunter Biden? Shouldn’t we know if the man running for President is laundering money through another country?   this 🤡 was going to subpoena him! Yeah right!
I was sexually assaulted as a child and the way Biden interacts with children makes me uncomfortable. I can’t vote for him and look my daughter in the eye. The Democrats should have put up a better candidate.

I hope you have a better reason then that. Because, we ALL owe life a death, that's just the way it works. I'm voting for Biden because, for the second time in my lifetime, he's the right man at the right time, for the right job. And Americans really need that right now. Peace.

Biden; Libya, Yemen, Syria literally sold us out to China  Trump: doing nothing in Libya, tried to pull troops out of Syria ? Attempted to make America more self reliant from China  Keep in mind the major role of the president is foreign policy and trade.
I know, it really makes me nervous.  Poor "President Biden" will have one hell of a mess to clean up but I have faith he and the true experts he'll fill his cabinet with will make a really good run at it!

Explain trump walking in on teen girls at the pageant, while they were undressing? Oh and trump saying “because I’m the owner” as to why he did? He’s got lawsuits against him for raping a 13ye old, along with Epstein. But Biden!!
Such an order would surely be challenged in court, and it’s inconceivable that the Supreme Court would uphold such a blatantly unconstitutional act.
The election date is set in law; Trump cannot change it without Congress’s consent. The election itself is run by the states, not the federal government, so there’s no bureaucracy Trump could corral to implement any order delaying the vote.

Can someone connected to the Biden campaign make sure they have read this book, forward and backwards 10 times over please?
We need an Obama again! But Biden will do!
Biden’s VP pick will also be better than Romney, should the GOP recycle Romney into the campaign somehow.

Karen Bass, A Potential Biden VP Pick, Praised Scientology At Church Opening In 2010  via
Trumps self sabotage is making it so Biden doesn’t have to do anything in order to win. If it was competitive, Biden would be more likely to take it on. Joe Biden has hinted since the intermission of the 1st debate that Yang is going to be in his cabinet.
He *also* said, in the same interview,  that she's very beautiful.    Then he followed it up with he'd date her.  And y'all think Biden is creepy because he friendly.
10 Biilion!  The USPS Union endorse Sleepy Biden so the DNC!  Outrageous
Whoever the misinformed woman in the McSally ad is, claiming she'll protect pre-existing conditions, whereas Kelly &amp; Biden will push government insurance, is sorely mistaken. The entire ad is laughable. McSally is disingenuous. Dems want to build on &amp; fix what's broken w/the ACA.
I feel VERY strongly that this is the wrong election to vote 3rd party. I’ve voted 3rd party since 2012, and this year I can’t do that in good conscience. As fucking shitty as Biden is, this election is about our democracy.
Such a problematic process from the Biden campaign
I am done with Biden he has my vote nothing else
Hands off Joe; he's our Asshole.
Joe Biden ad that says all Trump wants is to divide us is perfectly ironic
Even Biden had more simultaneous viewers than that
Look there some crazy and goofy people Biden is considering but Bass is in her own league of crazy.
We've all had those moments where you have no idea what the actual hell to Tweet. Just do what I do sometimes. Tweet your thoughts. Or Tweet about how bad of a president Trump is and how much better Biden would be.
Always believe the woman Biden said, right  ?
Rather than do actual work, House Democrats are subpoenaing Secretary Pompeo because they think he helped "advance a conspiracy theory" about Joe Biden.  We're in the middle of a pandemic, and this is what Democrats are doing right now.
That’s Joe Biden statement.” You bet Joe will keep us safe.”
Biden won’t know who he is or where he is by next week.
Completely shitty editors can’t even doctor up a film of President Trump to sounds real. I post actual film of Biden and you come with that trash. Sucks to be you. Sad how you just turn a blind eye to racism and sexual abuse when it’s laid out right in front of you. Disgusting.
Compare &amp; Contrast! e.g. Biden/Obama left cupboard bare! Give stats on their PPE, Tests, Medicine, Ventilators, etc. than give yours. Bullet Points. People like bullet points, not prose! Message!
That all article has Trump saying he disavowed Duke and does not want that support.  You hate it because Biden never said that about Byrd.  You can’t cover for this plain and simple, Biden loved this KKK POS!!!
And he's blaming the Portland stuff on Biden.  He said this will be Biden's way if Biden is elected president.   What bullshit!!
Biden has never said Defund the police! And everything you just said about Biden is exactly to a T describing Trump! But add lying, fake conspiracy theories and blame everybody but himself mentality! And it takes somebody with those same characteristics to vote for him
Here we go...1st of 3 debates to go..,chickenshit blow hard Biden backs out !
Clintons are the absolute worse among the privileged assholes sharing the government monopoly we all must deal with as it crushes us beneath barely hidden racism &amp; fascism Biden, another architect of misery, could do even worse than Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. Let that sink in.

Who cares. When Biden loses, they will be a trivia question
I've been told that i'm smarter than Joe Biden, so lets give this test of yours a try...  Uhhh / Duhhh / Doyeee / Durrr / Huhhh
I think it is you, who are running scared. If you are Biden's VP choice, your arrogance, unlike ability and baggage will lose the election for him for sure.
NO plan is Biden's plan. He's incapable of making any cohesive plan for anything. He says what his handlers tell him to say, and often he botches that. Tragic they are forcing this man to be their puppet, placeholder.
I’m going  because not voting for Biden. Never ever choosing a “lesser evil” again because there is no such thing in politics.
I'm pretty angry #Tsarnev will get another shot at life.  #BostonBomber Russia tried to warn Biden Obama and Hillary, but she let them in anyway.  Instead of treating him like an American, he should have his VISA revoked and let Chechnya or ? deal with his illegal *ss.
Terrible for Blacks. Over several decades,  criminal-justice system more punitive than any other advanced democracy’s.   Biden crafted the 1994 crime bill,  preferred to call it (as recently as 2015), the “1994 Biden" bill.
8 miserable destructive yrs under Obama/Biden. Foreclosures on homes..jobs lost..people on food stamps &amp; welfare. People lost hope by the evil run government. Pres trump brought back hope &amp; patriotism back to America. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 🇺🇸
Uhmm, you shouldn't add those 2 together... It's % of voters by voting type. So you add the same voting type/different candidates together to get 100% (if you include 3rd party).   So for by mail: Biden (32) +Trump (65) +3rd party (3)  =100%.
You’re still on this?? And YES, I am voting Biden. Not excited about it, but it’s necessary. And my profile used to say MAGA.  No more. (Independent now, for Biden.)
Exactly! Biden is running a campaign video in Arizona with Trump holding a Bible like it's a bad thing. Incredible. smh.

How insulting that Trump &amp; Pence think that we’re so stupid to think that Biden (who is universally respected) will destroy the country anymore than they have in one term. I have never felt less safe than I do now with Trump/Pence at the helm.
Unfortunately, a vote for Biden or getting rid of Trump does not fix this. Good luck.
The one good thing about Biden’s potential presidency is that this time we are going to smell the bullshit from the jump.
Three corrupt motherfuckers who paved the way for a Trump presidency. And the frameworks of deceit and corruption they constructed remain in place to disastrous effect today. I'd add Clinton 2 &amp; Biden, also.

I dunno, I feel like considering Joe Biden's age, the person he chooses as VP really ought to be ready to become the president.

Actually, I’m for Biden. But if most Americans do vote by mail (if millions do!), then it’ll take weeks to get a result. And there will be all kinds of problems.   Remember Florida in 2000?   But, I’m bored with this.. Bye.💋

HUGE! Major 2020 Poll Should Have Joe Biden Absolutely TERRIFIED
Anyone chosen will be a thrall to Democrat corruption, so who cares. We'll need to deal with Biden and whoever after they're elected, unfortunately.
I just want a fair election. If there’s any fraud, it’ll most likely benefit Biden.  For “the world’s greatest democracy”, voting in the USA is very sloppy. Now no one wants anyone to show ID to vote, and now “mass mailing” of ballots to millions of people.

Where is Joe Biden's leadership during this pandemic. Nothing but effortless platitudes and sloganeering from the "great" (non)leader.
I suspect the Democrat plan is for Biden and his female VP to enter the White House, then after a short time Biden will resign as President and the US will have its first Woman President.
"We've all ordered from Wish. Com and it looks one way on your fire tablet, you get it and it's Joe Biden" 😂

Chica, I totally agree. I was just thinking this morning that maybe I should take a week off and bury my head in the sand w the rest. Extreme precaution w Covid and ridin’ w Biden but I’m exhausted. Not sleeping and go to bed w disgust and wake up the same.
So, what are we thinking?  A Biden/Pelosi ticket?  Haven't heard rumors on that front-- why not?
Trump has disavowed David Duke &amp; KKK multiple times over the years.   Not once but multiple times over many many years. Can't wait for your lefty spin on this one.  Did Biden disavow Byrd?
Biden is senile and if elected he will embarrass the United States
Biden is senile, it is so sad that this man has been chosen to represent the Democrats as a Presidential candidate.  If elected he would never finish his 1st term and never be allowed 1 on 1 meetings with world leaders.
You are blind by design, bro. Read about Biden's hateful political record before you come back  or I will dog walk you.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA - Biden isn't in personal debt to foreign countries.
I think you meant to put a picture of Biden or Clinton
Stephanie- Biden is going to NEED A LOT OF INVESTIGATORS/LAWYERS/PROSECUTORS/ LAWMAKERS to FIX/PREVENT IN FUTURE ALL TRUMP HAS BROKEN. What a mess he’s created.
If the election happened today, and the polls were as wrong as they were in 2016, Biden would have over 300 electoral votes.  Embarrassing comment.
Tell the truth about greedy Biden/Sanders student supporters whining about their student loans and how willing they are to embrace socialism to alleviate their bills. Paint the real Socialism picture, no free enterprise, just the govt doling out meaningless jobs.
Next we'll find out Biden's announcement will be in mid-September. Just name Kamala already and stop screwing around.   For bonus points I am beginning to think that Jill Biden is opposed to  #KHive
Dems are always loaded with “passion.” Biden won’t have to pick on that one quality- it’s everywhere in excess.
Honestly if the trump wing of the party gets beaten down hard enough and Biden pushes for compromise they could caucus a few republicans.
This is what they do, and the very reason Biden is hidden in a basement somewhere. They have the next election so rigged he doesn't have to attend a debate or campaign. It terrifying actually.

The CCP is not our friend. They have made that very clear for decades. Ignore the propaganda and hit the CCP even harder. All the more reason to keep Biden out. He has been peter puffing  The CCP his entire career.
1.) Character limit 2.) Personally disliking someone and policies are different.  I dislike Biden and Obama too but all for various reasons
The great thing is that both these great women will be part of the Biden team, along with an amazing list of others. Finally, no empty positions, no temporary and unqualified idiots, not suck ups who only care about their own gain.
Well no, it's not ok. Biden has it in his head that joking about Trump's tweets is something that people care about when in reality nobody really gives a fuck about trump vs Bidens tweets, people just need healthcare. Honestly it's not that hard to understand

My point is that you are all jargon, soundbites and no perspective. Your meme is, of course, without any testable arguments. What was supposed to do that he failed to deliver? On the opposite end, can you name something he's done well? Do you know Biden is my point?
I’m not a Trumpster.   I’m voting for Biden.  Although still haven’t heard him say what he wants to do.  (And he’s been around 40 years and hasn’t done much yet.) But Trump’s just too divisive for his few good ideas.
Trump probably wants to delay the election so he can stay in the White House for a little while longer...  Funny that he thinks he has so much power. He thinks he's a king. He's probably scared of the election because he knows he isn't going to win against Biden.

Biden will need to call a super sanitation company. Boggles the mind.
The problem is when you run a business you should know your customers might be either Democrats or Republicans. To respect all his customers he should have kept the flag for his home or maybe his office. Knowing it will offend people just like if it was a Biden flag Common sense
A Joe Biden victory will be because of this guy and you can’t convince me otherwise.

His comment did stereotype, which itself is not cool. I agree with you and so does a good chunk of Americans. That doesn't make him a racist. Biden isn't perfect, but he's done more for this country than you know. At least read his Wikipedia page. :)
I think Susan Rice. Its just a feeling. But she is close to Biden has executive experience as ambassador to the UN, and has no legislative baggage.
Thank you 🙏🏽 pray no Biden he said he will undo all Trump has done !
We have two bad choices for President in 202, but if you were truly capable of demonstrating objectivity you would see that Trump is much more dangerous to our national security &amp; rule of law than Biden.   When Trumps interests conflict w/the nation’s, he serves himself above all
I'm not a racist period...never have been nor will I be. You're drawing your own conclusions from a soundbite taken out of context. If Biden was racist, it would be clear...like Trump. Trump publicly demonstrates it.

Progressive is being co-opted by the middle.  Biden calls himself a progressive.  The back to normalcy crowd just think it sounds nice.
Much respect to you sir. Let's bury the hatchet and act in the best interest of the United States of America! Biden 2020!
Congrats if you're preemptively blaming fellow citizens for Biden's failure  That's exactly what your masters want you to do so you aren't watching their fuckery
We moms will decide that for ourselves. And I’d choose Biden a kajillion trillion times over Trump.
Much safer in Joe Biden's America than Trump/Pence Russian satellite Fascist country
Biden tells teachers Trump must offer plan to keep schools safe amid COVID-19 strike threat
Right. According to Biden he wasn't black anyway because he was a Trump supporter. According to Dems in power he should have stayed in the gutter where he could have been plyed with food stamps and state assistance. He broke their 'black mold'
You all keep sharing and roasting the “Settle for Biden” accounts as if you all aren’t unironically going to vote for him in November 🤦🏻
What has Joe Biden done?
I'm okay with not finding out until January, on the night before Biden is sworn in.
Remember the old adage “United We Stand, Divided We Fall”? Joe Biden will create much more division than the Left already has. This country will burn at his feet.
Do we really want Joe dementia Biden to be our next president? Hell no!!
How are they going to open. What is the plan. You Republicans keep screaming open open open but you don't have no plan. After Joe Biden is President we will have a plan
Yeah, Joe Biden 😬
No I’m talking to you. You said money is being distributed to biden voters. Which ones? Cuz it wasn’t me. So who do you mean?
Trump is not the root or source of people’s anger. People were angry before and that’s the reason they elected trump because they were tired of the bureaucracy that had been there for so long, Biden is no better than Hillary in fact he’s worse. That’s why I will still vote trump
I'm a mom. You don't speak for me. I'm Ridin with Biden.
He’s listening to doctors and scientists unlike you folks who believe in conspiracy theories and untruths.  Don’t you worry your pretty little head off Kimmie, moms and grandmothers like me will be voting for Joe Biden. Now go eat some cake.
Democrats put a criminal and a guy with dementia up against him. Put somebody worth a shit that doesn’t threaten to take away constitutional rights and trump wouldn’t win. We don’t want trump we just really don’t want Clinton and Biden.
Biden hasn’t announced his VP yet.....😏

No worries.   will play a very important role TBD in the Biden Administration.
Joe Biden has constantly handled China with kid gloves.  President  is the first president in modern history to finally start holding China accountable for their many abuses.  The debate isn't even hard.
Obviously the media over there are not trying to get Joe Biden elected, much lower bar in terms of truth telling.
Trump is killing us daily but stupid #NeverBiden Bernie Bros are more concerned about Biden mispronouncing a word. Idiots!
Trump is actively working against black people but #NeverBiden Bernie bros are more concerned about Biden saying “You ain’t black”. These people are stupid.
Here's your boy with a known KKK Chapter President!!!
Even the anti-American NY Post rats see their futures circling the drain if Biden gets in a real office...
And Biden wouldn’t remember WHAT he tweeted 2 minutes later!😂
True! That's why we're voting Biden, to stop America to become Russia's bitch #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
i am not a Biden supporter oml how many times do i need to say it
How many times do I need to tell you that i DO NOT support Biden and I NEVER HAVE??? i used to be a Bernie supporter (still kinda am). Also a stutter isn't something you can control.
So my Governor is Doug Ducey. I know, I Iaugh with with tears. This has got to stop. I will be voting Joe Biden!

I am just so blown away by this thread. Still crying. No wonder Barack Obama chose THIS man, Joe Biden, to be his VP.
Omg what an incredible piece. I thank you for it and can honestly say I have never been MORE for Joe Biden as our President, than I am right now. Still crying as I type.
Is this why to felt you and Biden could illegally use the fisa courts against our current president? And Obama works to keep those old race wounds festering - rather then working towards peace.
Great! I wouldn't want to see that vile man at Biden's inauguration!
I wonder how many more Republicans will be backing Biden by election time
Biden and China are BFFs
So you’re saying Biden/Kelly agree with Schumer blocking an extension of unemployment benefits?
Yes!! Biden is gonna Win BIG! YUGE as a matter of fact!!
Uh, yes. We can reassure the American public that if Biden is elected president, there will be a competent team in charge of flattening the curve on the coronavirus and saving the economy.
Oops, democrat liberals lose,......te House, the Senate, and of course Bimbo Biden is "No where to be found".  GO TRUMP 2020, (maybe even in 2024).  We salute our President, Donald J Trump.

Biden should choose Obama for his VP.
Won't happen, although Biden could crack 400-plus Electoral College votes.
They'll have to lose four election cycles to change, and they won't. They'll fight Biden tooth and nail till the 2022 midterm, lose with whomever they pick in 2024, but likely gain seats in 2026 because Americans have short memories.

If you had to bet on Biden's choice for VP, who would it be?  **Not who you want**  I'm asking for your best guess - predictions not preferences
So when Joe Biden debates Trump and wipes the floor with Trump, what does that mean?  If someone with Dementia out debates you, does that make one stupid, or just inept to lead?  Honest question.

Not just that but they also desperately try to excuse how poor of a job Biden’s camp is doing
I hope that this is a chance for you to expose even more wrongdoings on behalf of the cabal. Hopefully you will freely mention publicly Valerie Jarrett Barack Obama Joe Biden Comey and the rest. Use it to make a public spectacle of the coup
If Biden wins the election, he only needs to hold the office for 90 days, then he could step down ( due to health reasons) and his female V.P. would automatically step in and become the President. 😳
Then I guess trump shouldn’t be trying to delegitimize his win, if he’s so confident he can beat Biden.
and before you say smth about biden 1. he has a stutter, 2. i don't support biden
i want to add that the age difference between biden and trump is 3 years
Why on earth would any well informed sensible person vote for Biden? How can you fail to see how hard Trump has fought for the peopleof the USA? Keep sleeping and we will keep fighting to keep the constitution so we keep freedom.
Give me one reason you're voting for Biden without using the word Trump
We will see. People in the media and his fellow colleagues have been saying hes more left now than hes ever been before. Some people can change, and biden will bring about change. Remember hes only going to last one term, so VP is more important tbh
Joe Biden is going to try and refuse to debate Donald Trump. He cannot hold a thought or keep a conversation for more than 30 seconds. He will be a coward and refuse to debate.
Yep. And Donald Trump will win!  A delay would probably benefit the Biden campaign. He will become less and less cognizant and people will have more confidence his VP will take over quickly - that is the strategy on the left, isn’t it?
He wasn’t a Democratic activist. He was kicked out. He hated Biden. He hated BLM, he hated  the Obamas, Clinton’s. That is no Democratic activist. and all his rhetoric is straight out of Trumps playbook.He is a very sick person.
Donald Trump may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the best medicine usually is not the best tasting. Joe Biden is barely a PLACEBO - and whoever his running mate is will be the typical nasty side effects!
Bernie's supporting him, helping election. Biden's the candidate to save our democracy. He has progressive wants in his plan. Do you even know what his plan contains. Bernie people must vote for bernie. Four more years of trump will mean we NEVER have Bernie's vision inplemented.
Trump has a chance to beat Biden just like he beat Hillary. #2020election #DemocraticParty #Democrats #DonaldTrump #Pennsylvania #politics #RepublicanParty #Republicans #TWJReports
Me too. I love  But I don’t think Biden is showcasing a joint Biden/Warren fundraiser on the Fri before announcing his VP choice if it’s her. Gotta believe Warren knows it’s not her. This is a Dem “unity” sign &amp; Warren’s a super fundraiser. Do it before she’s not picked.
In other news, Trump has stopped endlessly running those Biden/anarchy &amp; violence ads here in PHX.
Longing for Joe Biden as president.😊
And neither is Biden!
But media will immediately give them all a free pass.
Ah yes political advice from Sebastian Bach who claims Senile old fool Biden with has magic wand will whisk away COVID-19 and everything will suddenly return to normal 🤮🤮

Hope everyone young and old understands not voting or voting for anyone other than Biden is giving the vote to Bunker Boy and we can’t do another 4 years!!!!
Ultimately, it's going to come down to either it backfires and governors/GOP turns on Trump to save their hides (which likely still costs them all the election if even 25% of Trumpists don't vote at all) or the military personally escorts Trump out of the WH, legitimize Biden.
What the f*** new source are you watching Joe Biden proudly declared that he would defund the police. just as the rest of the democratic party has cloudly declared to defend the police and when asked about it they said no not move money out of the police completely defund

They are all effin children.
I just checked  's following list, and all he follows are blue-checks. No average Americans like me.   is even worse. Most of the accounts he follows have the word Biden in them.
The Constitution is only accepted as legitimate if the people deem it so. If 1/2 of Congress, the military, police and 1/2 the country believe that Biden is unlawfully walking up to the White House to be sworn in, then it's a constitutional crisis &amp; we end up w/ 2 Presidents.
Why does that never happen?!   How has nobody questioned Hunter Biden? Shouldn’t we know if the man running for President is laundering money through another country?   this 🤡 was going to subpoena him! Yeah right!

Mr Biden says hello
Rashida Tlaib us fighting for her political life...so in fear is she of losing the Michigan primary next week that she's unwilling to alienate even 1.viter and is refusing to back Biden...hmmmm
Watch trump in all of his videos. Listen to what he’s saying. Until then, keep quiet about Biden.
If Biden or another Democrat nominee ‘wins’ the Presidential election, will you accept the results or will you fight it like Democrats have done the past 4 years?
Eh. I like the Imperial News Network version better. Emperor Trump tweets. Film at 11. Senior Field Correspondent Leia Organa emotes, "Help Us Joe Ben Biden, you are our only hope!"
I can never get work done when  tweets such absurd shit in the morning. It puts me in a political mood all day. #workfromhomelife #thursdaymorning #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpThreatensAmerica #Biden #Election2020
Making something perverted just makes you out to be what you’re accusing Biden of.
It's a yes or no question..yes. If course Biden.
Explain trump walking in on teen girls at the pageant, while they were undressing? Oh and trump saying “because I’m the owner” as to why he did? He’s got lawsuits against him for raping a 13ye old, along with Epstein. But Biden!!
They aren’t BLM they are your supporters making this align with your failed Joe Biden Defund the police videos which are NOT TRUE those anarchists are TRUMP supporters. AMERICA DO NOT BE FOOLED
Trump didn’t create these problems. And Joe Biden, who I will vote for, isn’t going to fix them.
So, Trump is trying to start a groundswell to put off an election where polls show him way behind Joe Biden. The claims of voter fraud have no foundation...
Hahaha. No. Take a look at dudes social media. He despises the Democratic Party buddy. He’s bat shit crazy and believes he is married to Ivanka and that she is carrying his daughter. Hates Biden.
You forgot to tell Biden bots to vote often.I think it is you, who are running scared. If you are Biden's VP choice, your arrogance, unlike ability and baggage will lose the election for him for sure.
NO plan is Biden's plan. He's incapable of making any cohesive plan for anything. He says what his handlers tell him to say, and often he botches that. Tragic they are forcing this man to be their puppet, placeholder.
As I sit in the waiting room at the tire shop, they had the news on.  The news only talked about the same 3 things over and over.   1. Covid Bullshit  2. Trump is a bad person and president  3.  Vote Biden  Shit is annoying.
This is the truth behind why CHINA JOE BIDEN is acting how he is acting  To say he has DEMENTIA would lesson the jail sentence he might get if POTUS TRUMP &amp; true REPUBLICANS would investigate a life time 40+year government official&amp; family has become a millionaires on tax dollars
I do agree with you that Biden is a bad candidate. So, we do have something in common there.
Biden tells teachers Trump must offer plan to keep schools safe amid COVID-19 strike threat
I'm okay with not finding out until January, on the night before Biden is sworn in.
Zionists and Israel Firsters control the D Party. Biden himself once unashamedly declared he is a Zionist.   Palestinian-Americans sidelined during DNC platform debate

FLASHBACK: Conservatives attacked Joe Biden for predicting Trump would try to delay the 2020 election  Perhaps Conservatives Need To ZIP IT! Trump will try to declare Marshall Law and suspend the election.  I ask that the Military NOT PAY ATTENTION
You forgot to tell Biden bots to vote often.
She is an obnoxious, toxic member of the House. Arrogant and a bully, who does she think she is? AG Barr is a proven  success; she is just another mouthy Leftist rep from the land of fruit and nuts. And she lies, almost as much as Biden!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
No Biden is NOT against fracking. Lies won’t work b/c 21,000 Trump lies are already system overload! This former Republican says NO MORE TRUMP! BIDEN ALL THE WAY!
My guess is Obama and Hillary will choose Susan Rice to be Biden's VP.   Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
ESPOUSING HITLER TYPE RHETORIC, AND WITH, EMPATHY DEFICIT DISORDER!!!!!  NOVEMBER 3RD CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
BREAKING: Biden replaces Secret Service detail with super friendly social workers
Biden already has Larry Summers on retainer.
January?  How about November? :-)  Every morning I wake up I expect to read that Biden has been replaced by ...........
I am an old white haired white guy that is so tired of a bunch of old white haired white guys keeping the left down. Trump, Mitch, Biden, Bernie, Hillary, Pelosi, Schumer, Hoyer.....should all be living in the basement of their grandkids.
Exactly.  Plus his handlers knew in advance and ran a scam and they should be held accountable. To me It is obvious that Biden is a front man for the Obama/Hillary cabal.
You literally tweeted a Biden ad....
"Only serve one term" ? ? I don't think he will even finish his term.  Should Biden win, why do some assume he'll only serve one term?
LOL! Dems can lead?! The most corrupt, self-interested hypocrites on the planet can lead?  Obama/Biden sure did a great job w/ H1N1, right? You have to be 50 paces behind stupid.
The 2007-2009 housing crash created more suburban rental properties in our neighborhood than any Obama-Biden fair housing initiatives. Our beautiful neighborhood is still being bought up by investors. #45LIES
Yes, a local Walmart here in Phoenix has a very bright autistic young man as their greeter. He is friendly and alert. I think Biden could do just as well as this young man. Maybe not better but just as well.
LOUIE GOHMERT!!!!!  SO HAPPY YOU CONTRACTED COVID-19!!!!!  YOU ARE THE HIDEOUS FACE OF AN IGNORANT, MORONIC, SELF STYLED RABBLE ROUSER, THAT CONTRIBUTES CHAOS ONLY!!!!!  YOU ARE A USELESS, TRUMPICAN SCUM, ASS KISSER!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
A $600 bonus, being paid not to work, is the most stupid idea ever. Obviously you are joining Biden in using half brains.
Once again we have proof that Biden does NOT think for himself and needs his handlers to give him printed talking points to get out a coherent word.  If Harris is his VP choice all the better. Not only is she very unlikeable, she has a ton of her own baggage to add to his.

Smart Woman Against Trump SWAT. #Biden
Again you are only telling half the story.  Yes they object  to the platform which is meaningless once the regime is in power. But those same people said they will still support Biden.
What an awful man to put beautiful Portland through his fake law and order intimidation for his campaign!His attacks on cities word and deed are dangerous. He’s not Christian because his evil words lead to evil actions vs. God’s Word. Vote Biden, a real Christian in word &amp; deeds.
Biden has said emphatically that he is a Zionist. “I am a Zionist. You don’t have to be a Jew to be a Zionist”, he told the Jewish Shalom TV in 2007.
I didn't either.  I am waiting for 500 postcards to come in the mail to hand write for Biden and mail out.  I don't know what else to do.

Biden is even now a Puppet of those who want to take our country down. He will be Pres. in name only and his strings pulled by Obama Globalists and Marxist/Communist anarchists out to destroy the U.S. we know and love. Biden hasn't a clue who or what he is.   cont'd

My uneducated no inside guess on veepstakes.... It's between Harris and Rice, Biden and confidants want Rice, campaign people want Harris.... That's the impression I'm getting
I didn’t Vote for you cus you support Joe Biden for president.
Joe Biden thinks covid is Polio .. 🤪
All the key players in Biden's regime are Obama/Hillary retreads. That is why I think they are selecting her for Biden. Even Larry Summers is being recalled for Joe.
Never trust a Rhodes scholar especially one that was a major cog in the Obama/Hillary regime.  Biden/Rice = NeoZioLibCons dream.  ⬇️⬇️✔⬇️⬇️  Former Obama advisor Susan Rice emerges as a serious contender for Joe Biden's VP pick
I know...I read it and was like, what the heck, did Biden write this tweet😂
It was cool for Joe Biden to "blackmail" the President of Ukraine, but it’s an impeachable offense if Donald Trump inquiries about it.  Biden has lying down to a science - thing is he's stupid so the lies are easy to catch.
What is interesting &amp;infuriating is that it is the RICH who are defending U.S. anarchy;that IS what it is happening per  founders of BLM-admittedly Marxist/Communist &amp; want to make the country same. Obama now has his, Biden blackmailed&amp; pandered his way to the money,   cont'd
U think Biden could do more? Idiotic! Check his history:accomplished NOTHING in 50 yrs in politics, but he WAS always on the WRONG SIDE of every decision that had to be made, a bigot/racist &amp; liar. He plagiarized, pandered, blackmailed for $, wrote 1994 Criminal Act. Disgusting.
Biden doesn't know what he wants. He is a half brain with others pulling his chains. He doesn't know what's hit him. I do -- it's you treacherous, malicious ignoramuses.
Meet the person that will be selected to be Joe Biden's VP should he win. ⬇️⬇️✔⬇️⬇️ ‘It's absolutely serious’: Susan Rice vaults to the top of the VP heap  via
You support Biden, an Obama puppet, who would be handled by Globalist anti-semitic masters directing the U.S. to disaster. We would no longer be a country; Obama would finish the take down he began in 2008. Impeachment was fiction by your malicious, indecent, corrupt "friends."
Biden"decent"?! Segregationist/anti-integration SOB, serial plagiarizer, lifelong liar, hypocrite, buddy of KKKByrd,  supported by anti-Semites Tlaib/Omar/AOC and yes,Jew self-hating Sanders! Joe-racial "jokester", sexual weirdo, blackmailer, panderer, schoolyard bully. DECENT?!
I want Biden to pick Michelle too, can you imagine that!!

Biden’s Revenge Agenda
Former Bernie Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner stated voting for Biden is like saying to somebody, ‘You have a bowl of shit in front of you, and all you’ve got to do is eat half of it instead of the whole thing.’ It’s still shit.” I like her!
WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE 2020!!!!!
WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE 2020!!!!!
Also, Biden has the eyes of a dragon. He’s not scared to make the stand he needs to make. Trump will become the outsider who, hopefully will move to ‘Salem’s Lot  and work the night shift at the institute since he’ll probably have insomnia 👍🏽

Just remember, Biden has never been a very smart guy. He’s been a was a terrible student, a hack as a politician, and slimy VP. The only thing he has exceled at is gaffes, challenging people to push-up contests and just being stupid.
I am going with Susan Rice. Biden's whole regime will be filled with Obama/Hillary operatives.
Who will Obama and Hillary pick to be Biden's VP?
Lol Perfect If he does win Biden's whole regime will  be filled with Obama operatives. Imho Obama and Hillary will pick Susan Rice to be his VP.
What role will Hillary have in Biden's cabinet if he becomes POTUS?
As usual Bernie chose his words wisely leaving himself an out. But the essence and scent of his sheepdogging is there. I am surprised you still haven't realized  Bernie is a fraud.
Remember in 2016 when every major poll said Hillary was going to win? And people actually rallied around her, unlike Biden lol.
My mind is blown that polls actually show Biden as the favorite to win.
There’s no reason for Biden to waste his time with Fox News!!!
This can’t be helping Biden’s chances with middle America...
Very smart decision on Biden’s part
Dear Mr. President, If I want to know what Mr. Biden will do if elected, I will go check Mr. Biden’s website. Instead of telling us what you think Mr. Biden will do, why don’t you tell us what you are going to do? Signed, normal Americans
If Biden can't do an interview with other than the bought and paid for Liberal media, will he be able to debate Donald Trump or use the virus as his excuse?  Will voters care?

Biden's 'Merica.
2/2  He could have just quit and gone home. He did not have to shame his Berners into voting for Biden. Bernie is a go along to get along politician who is trying to stay relevant. Why is he not in Portland......?
1/2 Berners only paid attention to his half truths and his pandering. They did not want to see his other side. He could have gone 3rd party in 2016 after he got rigged. He ran as a D again in 2020. Now he herds for Biden. He should be shamed and shunned
I am sure you must have heard the rumor that Biden will step down (due to health!) at last minute and Michelle O. will take his place as Democrat candidate. Pls. be prepared. They will fight a dirty, filthy, stench-ridden campaign and WE need to fight back same way! You MUST win.
I am sure you know this -- rumor has it Biden will step down at last minute and Michelle O. will take his place as Democrat nominee.  Please be prepared!  🥰
Wait, if Biden is elected his check will be much lower. But if you are black, you’ve been ordered to vote Democrat. Blacks Can’t think for themselves.

Looney Tunes proving you’re mentally unstable to lead!  The majority WILL vote Biden!
Biden has a 5% lead in ARIZONA  America knows you're a failure and a loser  #Resign
Not only is Biden ahead in AZ, Mark Kelly is trouncing Martha McSally. That said now is not the time to let up but rather concentrate efforts to make sure those numbers hold up.
COVID-19 will decide.  Biden is not beating Trump, COVID-19 is beating Trump.
That’s why we’re voting for Biden Trump has torn America apart
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I call BS!!! Is there a single nurse who has confirmed that pile of BS. you know when Biden is lying? His lips are moving...
84% are voting yes. I bet the majority of the 84% are Berners. They could care less that Biden is a racist, pedo, Zionist, war monger. Shame on them and any other cretin who will vote in 2020.
Biden is the only sane candidate running for the Presidency I choose Biden!!!
FYI, YOU PREPUBESCENT PLEBE, I AM 5'10, WEIGH 172, NOT FAT, FIT AS A FIDDLE!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE 2020!!!!!
It doesn't matter that the law wants local/state goats. to invite the Fed govt. in.  Ppl see this as Trump not doing anything to stop the anarchy as much as Biden won't/can't. Trump MUST take decisive steps now to put these anarchists down &amp; away if he wants votes, not chaos.
My fear, BIG one, is that ppl blame Trump for not acting, not stopping the violence. We look &amp; ask "Why isn't our govt. stopping this?" Voters will see Trump as not doing anything (just as Biden won't, can't, refuses) AND IT WILL COST PRES.TRUMP A LOT OF VOTES UNLESS HE ACTS NOW!
Exactly Spot on. Bernie is beyond pathetic as he sheepdogs for Biden. I just can't understand how Berners still support this sheepdog  after he has shown time again that he is a fraud. How can they possibly be that Ignorant.
Build America vote for President Trump, continue to destroy America vote for Biden. It’s America’s choice November 3rd.
Then blacks are told by Democrats to vote for Biden who said he will immediately raise taxes and take President Trumps tax cuts away.
If you want this guy to be your "Shadow Government President" then Biden is your person. Neither did anything in 8 years and now they think they know what needs to be done. ha! what a bloody joke. I blame you, Obama, for all the unrest in our country. It started with you!
Biden is encouraged by son Hunter to keep strong relationships with China so his money funding will continue. Ukraine should be deeply worried if Biden wins the election. Biden will end all funding to Ukraine immediately.
Isn’t it crazy to think Biden is probably sitting at his dinner table RN thinking who’s going to be VP🥴
Bernie didn't create Socialists he manufactured quasi left leaning centrists of which 80% will vote for Bernie's "friend" Biden.
More lies.  Just like your fake campaign commercials stating VIP Biden is defunding police.   None of it factual.  Biden is increasing funding for police.  Your a fake TV president.   Nov3 can not come fast enough. #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS
13 more than Biden can remember.
EVERYTHING about Biden &amp; his supporters is phony. He IS a racist, a plagiarizer, blackmailer, bigot, a segregation sympathizer, anti-integration, a panderer, a congenital liar, an unintelligent man who got in place due to glad-handing, back-slapping the right ppl. Sickeing man.
Add "professional panderer" to Biden's list of sins. He is despicable, gag-worthy.
I am over 65 and i am not blaming President Trump for any action he has taken for Coronavirus. In fact, he saved 10s of throusand of elderly lives. MSM is saying over 65 Trump supporters is leaving to support dementia, racist, pedophile, criminal Biden. I am not buying it.
* Every President has been advised and feared the possibility of a pandemic virus.  * Trump closed off China against medical and Democrats  *WH Medical team recommended avoid crowds, NY refused  *Obama/Biden left nation medical supplies empty  *Trump cut regulations for vaccine
I’m more than ready, let’s go Biden✊🏼
Yes! Know it beyond a shadow of a doubt! Biden sll the way, bot!
There is no lesser of two evils. Evil is equally evil.  Like Trump, Biden Would be a Right-Wing President
China is being exposed for what they are, A communism country trying to rule the world. Democrats welcome China communism for now because they make millions of under the table payoffs, Biden son is a perfect example. Look further into Dems, to see massive payoffs,follow the money
Her story was so full of holes and questions, why now and not when he was VP for 8 yrs? She changed he story multiple times and said things that were proven to be unable to be true.  I’m speaking as a victim of rape dozens of times, not as a Biden supporter
If you vote for Biden you probably listen to Russ too
Thank You Republicans for Joe Biden. We will defeat the Cheetoh Puff In Charge...and Flush the Turd on November 3rd.
Biden will raise taxes on all people and corporations, end Energy independents causing gas to raise and depend on Far East oil, have open borders, high cost healthcare including illegals, students loans forgiveness, end prison reform, defund law enforcements agencies, jobs lost
Voting for Hillary or Biden is the same as voting for Bernie. Only difference is that Bernie is their sheepdog and was never going to get the top slot and he knew it. His die hard Berniacs still exist in Bernie Syndrome Zone. Bernie is a fraud.
U'll dream up any accusation/exaggeration against Republicans you can imagine in your lunatic, limited brain. More Democrats in Congress have used the "slush fund" &amp; it is time to release their names. We already know about sexual weirdo Joe Biden who fingers+ young women.

145,000 deaths is NOT a great thing! We are the worst nation in the world for handling COVID19. We need Joe Biden to clean up this mess! We’re trapped in our country because you are a narcissistic sociopath mob criminal owing every dictator in the world. You are unfit!#TrumpVirus
History shows America that by far Biden has shown racism throughout he’s career. President Trump has showed nothing but love, respect and friendship with blacks. Since becoming president, he’s has done more to help blacks then any other president except President Lincoln.
Isn’t it sad that Biden is our only chance for a return to normal life? #americasucks
Biden is definitely losing it. Shame on  for showcasing his disease.
Combine this with Biden rambling on about nurses whispering in his ear about pillows and blowing in his nose, and I'm convinced this isn't real life.
I don’t care about what trump says in his ad’s I will never forget about his behavior and actions I will vote 🗳 for joe Biden
One of many reasons for Leftists not to vote for Biden. A Biden regime will be a Clinton/Obama NeoZioLibCon agenda that will seek major proxy wars against Sino-Russo.    Also Google Tony Blinken after you read this.
Great point.  As much as I despise Trump's domestic policies, Biden's foreign policies scare me even more. I am 70 y/o it is not my world, it now belongs to the young people. They need to stand up and do what ever it takes to stop the assault on humanity.
I think Biden should get a biscuit every time he strings 5 or more words together coherently.

Tax returns do not show anything but money in, money out. It is financial records that count; Pres. Trump doesn't owe that to the ppl. Try getting Hillary's REAL financial info...or Obama's or even Biden's.This tax statement thing is laughable and just another slur by Dem scum.
Do you think Biden knows he cannot answer the questions? If so, how does he think he could be President?
HE CARES NOTHING ABOUT US!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE 2020!!!!!
