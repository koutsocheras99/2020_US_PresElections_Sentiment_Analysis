I don't get it.  Trump 2020?  Weird to want to put your name above the number of daily COVID deaths, but y'all do you I guess.
I think a Biden Presidency would be funnier than a Trump one. With Trump its the same old lying, pivoting, and self gloating but with EVERY Biden speech there's gonna be something new due to cognitive decline.  We could literally hear an N word bomb cause he forgot he cant say it
But better than Trump and Pence

Biden has nothing. His plan is only one subject - no Trump.  TDS in full swing.  Take a bitter pill on November 4 and try to recover from your disorder
I don‚Äôt believe tRump has that authority. Would have to go through Treasury and Congress would undo it. And seriously if tRump took off his jacket and showed a holstered sidearm I feel most Americans would say ‚ÄúWhat an asshole.‚Äù
President Trump is fighting for ALL Americans.  Remaining moderate Dems should take the bitter pill, recover from TDS and support DJT on November 3 to bring American forward!
Anything happens anywhere Trump is blamed.  This is called TDS.  Get a pill and recover already.

I think we all understand what Fascism is. We just have a different opinion on who is practicing it. I don't know how you can't see that Trump is trying to have total control. I feel sorry for you.
I watch Fox News and MSNBC and CNN in and CBS and USA andPBS and British news and sometimes Al Jazeera when I can get it and I know Fox Leaves out many facts that are not omitted the other stations, like Trump spewing outrageous lies that Fox would never let you see.
If  doesn't vote for  then no matter who she votes for she IS voting for Trump. Period.
You are right! All the media except for the ones owned by the super right wing nut Rupert Murdoch are trying to take Trump down. And why wouldn't they be; he is a dangerous and completely incompetent, corrupt, and psychotic imbecile. The only fake news is Fox news.
Yes they visited Epstein island but all witnesses have testified that they saw no improprieties committed by the Clintons. They came, they had drinks, and they left. Unlike Alan Dershowitz and other Trump buddies.

No, they will stay far away from each other. Because Biden is careful and Trump is terrible
#biden stays in hiding. More Dems I know are saying they can‚Äôt stand Biden but are voting for his VP. They are 100% sure Biden would step down within 1 year after election. The most important VP selection ever. PRESS ALL THE REPUBLICANS YOU KNOW TO GET OUT THE VOTE FOR TRUMP!

Bottom line.  It‚Äôs a concept a businessman should understand.  Trump‚Äôs bottom line is 160,000 dead Americans.

Donald Trump won‚Äôt even try to comprehend any statistic that could hurt his campaign. Unwitting voters who hear only his one-sided propaganda will be duped. He is bent on preserving his own image at the cost of 158,000 American lives and counting
The President's response as 1,000 Americans are dying each day:  "It is what it is."  The Trump White House has failed for months to put forward a national testing strategy or mask mandate that would help us stop the spread.  The administration can and must do better.
The obvious thing would be saying "I hate comics," or "I like Trump," but if I REALLY wanted to let them know something is amiss I'd tweet something that they actually find interesting or amusing. "Wow, this tweet from Jon is really good and engaging! ...something's wrong."

Why would you say tRump can‚Äôt be bought? You‚Äôre taking his word about how wealthy he is. Granted he is very proficient about grift and enriching himself at the nation‚Äôs expense. Perhaps he can‚Äôt be bought but he can be blackmailed.
If you can't make it to the polls, this is important information.  If you can SAFELY vote in person this year, I would highly recommend doing so as there's no telling what bullshit nonsense the Trump Party will come up with to try and invalidate votes.
It would be nice if this worked but I have my doubts they will fight this because they are communist and Trump is an American Hero
Your crazy....look up the Boogaloo boys they were looting and carrying weapons....Trump doesn't deserve a black white or purple vote. Are you a paid supporter..... seriously.
Damn Alyssa don‚Äôt you have anyone to talk to? You vent on Twitter a lot.regardless of your personal feeling on Trump you have to ask yourself, am I better off or worse off? My investments have grown 32% before the plague, so I am better off, he‚Äôs a good president.
Oh snap. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) calling out Steve Scalise, who earlier kept using a giant stack of papers as a prop to say that Trump had a plan.  "A stack of papers is not a plan."
The funniest thing about this hearing so far is that  accused the other members of spending more team reading tweets than doing their jobs.  I guess that's how he missed the one about Trump wanting to postpone the election?
Steve Scalise comparing COVID to HIV.  Talking how the Trump Admin got a COVID vaccine moving in 6 months but not vaccine for HIV in eyars.  Because these things are totally the same.  Steve Scalise is an asshole.
Soldier on never go back we will prevail Donald Trump 20/20
I might be wrong, but I think Trump's delay the election tweet was to distract us from the economic report released.

Because they afraid it works and less people will die and that is exactly what they want.  They think if more people die less chances for Trump to win.  he will win in a landslide anyway.
Believe me Donald Trump knows he can't move the election without Congress okay and they won't do it because they're not smart enough to understand what the Constitution says so all he is doing is baiting the Democrats and they took it Hook Line &amp; Sinker
All in for Trump!!!  I see Trump as a mix of Andrew Jackson and Ronald Reagan üòÄ
Absolutely wrong.  Do not EVER ignore tRump.  Federal and state authorities need to swiftly and congruently apprehend, prosecute, and jail this man for his crimes against our country.  Period.

Thanks Jim for making a quick, ridiculous response to this. Trump says things like this to get the conversation started nationally so it becomes a hot topic. If it becomes popular enough, maybe congress will do something about it. Think before reacting

My guess is he leaves it up to the SDNY and manhattan‚Äôs DA to do all the dirty work. Trump and everyone attached to him need to be taken down, if for no reason other than to set new norms and incentives that corruption will not go unpunished
trump's critics are the coastal and Hollywood elite and dc swamp but also poor, uneducated people who haven't left their home states
the only thing historians will be baffled by is people who acted like trump was ever going to change

Trump is now a really bad Bond villain.
Yes but the question is whether the Republicans will vote for Trump even recognizing the damage he is doing to our democracy. I know many of those. They do not like Trump but they will vote party over principles and values.
You literally wrote "four years of Trump‚Äôs chaos, incompetence, corruption, narcissism, nepotism, racism, authoritarianism and nihilism..."  And that's not enough to vote for Biden?
It should. Republicans *are Trump.  Y‚Äôall have just been better at hiding it.

most troubling in this moment, after the botched Covid response, Wall Street looting, the absolute disdain for working people in this pandemic, and trump's rising attacks on the election, even with the rise of #BLM, is that that a mass movement still seems unlikely in the USA

Totally agreed. Trump is not a normal R. He's a threat to the basically all our norms, Liberal Democracy, the Pax Americana, more.  Normal R's are like Normal Dems, wrong sometimes but not wholly corrupt, ignorant and selfish
This is what fascists do. #TrumpIsAFascist

"Obamacare already covers pre existing conditions" blah blah. O-care is garbage. Super high priced crap to say you have it. You can't use it because you pay deductibles all year. Who does that help?! Trump wants to LOWER prices. What's wrong with that? #WalkAway #KAG2020 #Tucker

You can‚Äôt wait until 3 months before the election and expect that to work. I get that strategy but that needs to happen during primaries. If you can‚Äôt get that candidate nominated then your strategy is ineffective from then until the election. It just turns helping Trump.
President Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat. But what is WeChat, and why is it so controversial?
Wow. I thought you would be aligned with me here. Abortions rates drop under Democrats not Republicans. Get out of here with your #NeverBiden bullshit. It‚Äôs gonna be one of them and taking dem votes from Bide. Is only gonna give us Trump
So you are voting for a guy who is racist and doesn‚Äôt even know where he is just because you hate trump?
He has my vote, I‚Äôm already confident we have 100% chance to have less abortions under Biden than Trump. Biden will implement the preventative things to eliminate the causes of abortion. GOP‚Äôs answer is outlaw, which won‚Äôt work.
It does now because the gop has continually enabled trump to become a worse and meaner monster during his reign of terror.
By "added back to our economy" I think you mean "recovered from the trash heap of Trump's ignoring the warnings of, dismantling the preparations for and the mishandling of the COVID19 public health crisis pandemic."
He knows NY is no threat to vote for Trump, so he‚Äôs trying to appease the people of NY a bit
Also, we shouldn't still be in a position where the "we have our own problems" argument has weight, because we should be long out of a crisis in the US.  A clown could have handled COVID19 better than Donald Trump has.  The ripples of his incomptency reach far and wide.
Remember when Trump said ‚Äútwo Corinthians‚Äù and a bunch of people were like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not wrong that‚Äôs how some people say it.‚Äù That‚Äôs absolutely, 100% true. But he‚Äôs not saying these things because he‚Äôs ‚Äúcultured.‚Äù He‚Äôs saying them because he‚Äôs an idiot who can‚Äôt read.
The country would be more safe under commies ‚Äî¬†even if they were commies, which they aren't ‚Äî than it would be under Trump. I'd vote for a steaming pile of dog crap before I'd vote for Trump, and so would any sane American.
Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúnational emergencies‚Äù are always his ego emergencies or political emergencies. They never have anything to do with national security or the welfare of the American people.
There should also be a poll for 'Greatest Threat to Health'. Hands down trump would top that list as well.
Absolutely. trump's delicate little feels were devastated in Tulsa and he's been out for revenge ever since. That he can get Sarah Cooper at the same time is just icing on the cake.
If Kellyanne contracted CV-19, I wonder if SHE'D listen to trump's advice on how she should get well??
Your handle is a lie in itself. There is no such thing as a Republican for Biden. Secondly, we had the all-time best economy IN HISTORY before we were attacked by the liberal Scamdemic.  The economy - and employment -  continue to grow by leaps and bounds, thanks to Trump
Poor little snowflake trump got his delicate feelers hurt by all the Tik Tok users who blew up his Tulsa rally. He also HATES all the videos making fun of him. BOOHOO.

I read this &amp; all I can think is Trump has killed over 150k people and it depends on who  picks for VP whether or not you will vote for him or give Trump a vote by writing someone in. Please explain to me your love of the country. You would risk him winning, why?
So they broke the law, they finally got held to account, it‚Äôs that simple. No other non-profit could operate this way. It‚Äôs also why the Trump Foundation was dissolved

I can‚Äôt believe how biased trump is, he is not the president of all Americans, who gives a crap about a tv station , I make my own decisions, that‚Äôs what educated free speaking adults do
Trump is the biggest liar on the planet. And those who support him are just plain stupid.
Hey #MAGA  - has trump made America great yet??
Republicans enabled Trump. They continue to enable him. They have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they will put partisan power over national interests any day, every day. They. Are. Done.
Democrats passed their bill in MAY. You sat around and fiddled while America burned and your plans include billions for Trump‚Äôs personal profit (FBI building) and peanuts for laid-off workers.
Absolutely. Trump-supporting evangelicals sold whatever little credibility they had left when they backed this clown. Evangelicalism as a whole won‚Äôt recover from this, which is fine.
For one, they wouldn't have disbanded the pandemic task force in the NSC. For another, they would have followed the Obama pandemic playbook. Look that up, and that shows you all the steps they would have taken while Trump wasted his time golfing and tweeting.

Report: Twitter bans Trump campaign from tweeting over COVID misinformation
President Donald Trump hopes to scrub-out perceptions of a coronavirus' stain on the national economy with a trip to Ohio.
His lawyer also said he still plans to go ahead with his book on President Trump before the election in November
No one is doing that. We're letting "Still unacceptably racist and beholden to the same wealthy interests as Trump" be the enemy of "the mental well-being of those who aren't affected by these issues and just want to go to brunch."
That‚Äôs the thing, with trump it‚Äôs multiple scandals a week so what the hell do was focus on? The trump regime crime syndicate continues to make money with impunity.
These people have no conviction. All they have is the false notion that Trump is the source of all this country's ills. But genocide and slavery are as American as apple pie and it will take much more to root them out, work that these people are afraid and/or unwilling to take on
Everyone should be angry at Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Both of these people are unfit for the Presidency. Fuck both of them.
Yeah - welcome to trump‚Äôs america.
I think trump‚Äôs ‚Äòcrowd size‚Äô photo has been enhanced with some digital viagra.

"Things go away." The sooner Trump goes away, the better for this nation.

I'm guessing it has nothing at all to do with Trump or his family and that the AG is just doing this to watch him poop his adult diaper.

When Biden gets elected, can y'all Trump stans act civilized?
Her only ‚Äúsupport‚Äù of Trump is a pin on her backpack. Does this justify being stereotyped as all of those things? Nobody agrees with anyone on everything even in relationships or friendships. This is even more evident with politicians who are ALL corrupt regardless of party.

The entire trump crime family makes the old saying- 'Money can't buy class' -painfully true.
"Throughout the interview, but especially during that exchange, Swan gave him multiple iterations of a look which, as a fellow Australian, I can authoritatively translate as: "Mate, what the fuck are you on about?""
All have speech writers, that includes Trump..
Telling that they have to keep using shorter and shorter clips to make Biden look bad ‚Äî this one is down to 7 seconds. While you could take any three-minute chunk out of the Axios interview at random, and Trump still looks like a raving, ignorant lunatic.
I am absolutely ok with Trump losing the election as well.
The President had planned to deliver the speech in Jacksonville, Florida, but canceled following a resurgence of coronavirus cases in the state.
To be clear, trump is the illegitimate president*. He's completely unfit to lead a company, much less this country. He's a raging sociopath and it shows every time he opens his mouth or tweets.
I‚Äôm sick of that word and Trump. Seriously considering muting both.

He also called for the first formal presidential debate to be moved up on the calendar because early voting will have already begun in some states
Mom, on Trump.
The only votes this guy gonna get is purely hatred of Trump, no right minded person would üòÇ
Blatant tRump ploy. He knows he has to win Fla. and with Covid 19 out of control there his voters won't show up. He says Florida "is different". This is the only reason.
That's because trump is a sociopath and doesn't give ONE DAMN about the people who have died from CV-19. He DOES, however, care about Ghislane Maxwell staying quiet and relayed that to her.
That's because trump can't count.
One of Facebook's official third-party fact checkers, Daily Caller, is sending fundraising emails for Trump:
So like half of Donnie Trump's campaign team are also on Kanye West's campaign team, too?  How does that work? Doesn't that break GOP party rules? Weird.
Imagine if you had voted to remove Trump from office? Imagine what American life would look like now without a complicit GOP? Imagine how well we would be doing if there had been ANY pandemic plan! You are a disgrace to Maine and America. We will vote you out!
You know Biden is gonna pick a VP based on white suburban "I was a Trump voter til last week" mom appeal, right?
We‚Äôve got another Liar in the trump family, Kimberly... Lies, Lies &amp; More Lies LOL üòÇü§•ü§•ü§•
He's going to need them. Locally, I have yet to see a Biden sticker, yard placard, flag... and yet I see Trump stuff all over the place.
Kudos to Trump on that. 1st he did an EO for insulin. Then he did s 2nd to include other drugs. He angered Big Pharma such that that they refused to meet with him at a scheduled meeting at the WH.
‚ÄúA lot of people‚Äù think it goes away in April... with the heat.  ‚ÄúA lot of people‚Äù are idiots. ‚ÄúA lot of people‚Äù = Trump
That's twice the amount that the Trump campaign has reserved
The person doing the most to undermine the election is none other than our sad insecure trump. He is willing to use any means, foreign help, lying, power of his office or any other means to skew the election
No matter what President Trump does his haters won‚Äôt be satisfied
I think America is tired of Trump and COV19!!!
Many thought Trump‚Äôs Axios interview felt like ‚ÄòVeep.‚Äô The showrunner says, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre being outdone regularly.‚Äô
This comes after months of criticizing vote by mail
This looks completely peaceful. No police rioting and throwing tear gas. Just people destroying their own belongings while others use their first amendment rights to say fuck trump.
Pres. Trump told reporters at the White House: ‚ÄúIt would seem like it based on the explosion. I met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that it was"

He will let people die for trump
The massive explosion killed at least 70 people.
Really? Like the drug reduction bill Trump wanted, passed by the House and 2 weeks after Mitch killed it, Big Pharma gave him a donation? He prides himself on gridlock. I think he will be minority leader. KY will elect him. God, guns and abortion. They suck it up like a pacifier
Trump says massive explosion in Beirut was likely an ‚Äòattack‚Äô

Even Fox bailed on Trump's press conference, giving up the ghost when he started reeling off a laundry list of the demographics of unemployment numbers that are the lowest ever. They lasted through him saying, "High school diploma! NO high school diploma!" before Tucker broke in.

Oh, I'm not. But I've also had the Democrats telling me for 40 years that we have to vote against Republicans, and the time for change is not now. I think Hillary would have been infinitely preferable to trump, and I think Bernie would have been better still.
Trump will walk it when the chips are down.
We do not, but we also know that Biden isn't going to change anything, and honestly could open the door for Republican resurgence. Some of us are looking past the next four years. But we also know that the US can't survive another four years of trump. So, handwringing.

And you cannot think of anything intelligent to say so you resort to insults. Trump has been running the country just fine, just because we like him or vote for him does not mean we are stupid. It's not Biden we gotta worry about he don't want to be Pres. he'll hand it to VP
And the evangelicals will not give up on him no matter what he does.

A dictatorship‚ÄîHerr Trump is destroying us by the minute.  Can‚Äôt imagine why this creature has any followers‚Äîhe really helps no one but himself!

I just wish the black people that spend all day talking about Joe Biden and the Crime Bill would direct that energy towards Trump and the Republicans.  Like, I get it. Someone you follow pointed it out and now you gotta keep your woke badge but the shit is just depressing smh.
How is it that Trump‚ÄîPOTUS for the entire country‚Äîis now parsing National Guard payments‚Äîproviding only to two states w/GOP govs! What kind of sick world are we living in?  COVID w/dismissed by Trump‚Äîno national program &amp; now causing escalation &amp; deaths that didn‚Äôt need to be!üë†
Trump has the vocabulary of a 5 year old and the attention span of a goldfish.
Donald Trump is a textbook definition of dementia.
That would make Biden incredibly powerful.  Interesting that Trump gives him so much credit.

Excuse me but WHY is Donald Trump calling out Joe Biden for his comments on African Americans diversity? Do I need to put up a list of Trump‚Äôs racism from the 70‚Äôs towards now? Don‚Äôt make me do it.
Your article says Trump is #pandering as an #opportunist. I agree. He‚Äôs a #pos.
Big news!  Team Trump twisted Biden‚Äôs words to pretend to Trump‚Äôs brain dead supporters that HES *almost* as racist as the #fuhrer!
Sounds like ‚ÄòBob‚Äô is shining him on.
Oh man what happened to  !! She trump colored and her right eye is twitching. She's one of my favorite people on  . I hope she's ok. Sheesh.
Trump‚Äôs no doctor, and what he says doesn‚Äôt reflect the scientific consensus.  And no, ‚ÄúI heard it from a real live doctor‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean squat. People who are not doctors, and who do not MEET WITH AND DIAGNOSE OEOPLE INDIVIDUALLY, should not be prescribing prescription drugs.

"The numbers are coming in strong!" says Trump in Ohio.  Boy, they sure are: we're already at 4.85 million cases of coronavirus in the United States, so we ought to be hitting 5 million in short order!  Thanks, Mr. President!
Upon further thought, I‚Äôve decided to vote for Trump in  November.
"We begged Republicans..." That's the problem with the Dem party, right there. Obama got pushed around on debt ceiling and Garland. Trump gets his tax cuts and no COVID relief. Dems are weak, unless they're attacking progressives, then they band together and go full bore.
Attention #America - Do N0t, under any circumstance fall for  stunts. Let‚Äôs address the YUGe elephant in the room. Trump thinks if he dangles Kanya West b4 black Americans will clamor to support him, split the vote &amp; #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica will fail.
"I wouldn't wrestle him," Trump says of Jim Jordan.  Yeah, I wouldn't wrestle him or wrestle *for* him. I hear things don't always turn out so well for wrestlers on his team.
Conservatives hate black people...unless you support Trump then they attach to you like a magnet.
The spike in case with school age children is completely baffling. It is almost like something was preventing them from getting infected in the previous five months? I am perplexed, what has changed in the past 7 to 10 days?  Trump is dumber than he is fat, he is very dumb.
Can someone PLEASE explain why there is a child ‚Äúmini AOC‚Äù doing what she does here? I mean we Know Trump voters aren‚Äôt the most friendliest nor mature people but the fact that they use a child to harass one of our U.S lawmakers and amongst the youngest is just steeping too low.
Dnc is run by rich people. Trump doesn't pose a threat to them. Socialism does
He's 100% Correct .
Because he decided that being ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù (and ain‚Äôt that ironic?) would get them on his side. The only thing he‚Äôs ‚Äúpro-‚Äú is Trump.
Like being a Trump supporter and being linked to white supremacy was bad enough
Oh well even more reason to vote blue because of people like you. We have to get Trump out. Vote üó≥.
Trump voters are WORSE than Trump himself in my honest opinion.
Yep AND I done blocked like probably almost 50 something Trump voters, and now Twitter is limiting some of my account features...FOR WHAT? I‚Äôm the one being stalked by all of these creepy ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù grown adults who stalk my account after one of my recent tweets gets 300+ likes
Just wanna put this out, I don‚Äôt have a problem speaking to others‚Äô who may disagree with me upon something but I do not tolerate insults to my intelligence or appearance, apparently all these nasty Trump voters who keep retweeting me must love getting #Blocked.ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Well, let's see - Dana Rohrabacher, Devin Nunes, Donald Trump - let's start with those. Where's my check?
I have an idea...in the Biden/Trump debate every time Trump says ‚Äúfake News‚Äù the audience yells ‚Äúthe truth‚Äù and takes a drink!
Best excuse ever to avoid meeting with Trump.

What will happen to Trump after this? My SO thinks he'll die quickly after leaving office. I think he'll leave the country.

Always remember, no matter what the GOP claims to be bad against Biden, Trump has done worse and likely while in WH. Trump is the bottom; any movement is upward.
Yes, Trump Can Sabotage Election Day | Opinion
I doubt Trump even watches or knows about the "oranges" of the game.  More importantly, it's disgraceful every day that he pretends to be President.
Indeed!  While were at it we need to find the oranges to the myth that Trump would have ever failed a test that is only administered those those that may be suffering the effects of dementia.  My money is on the Yo-semites!

Trump been in the White House this entire time with same day testing that some crazy shit lmao
We have already gone over this. Your memory must be really bad.   One more time for you.   What trump says is irrelevant,  to the decisions made by state governor's.    As for recommendations and guidance of heath issues,  that's the  job not the presidents
Bc you are so focused on what trump says , that you completely missed the moon walking bear.
And yet you complained that trump did not fallow the advice of doctors.  When the advice was to just do the normal every day things.
Where was this energy when y‚Äôall voted Trump into office .
It's humorous that you losers think there are millions of Trump supporters and right wing nutjobs who watch the NBA loyally - but I hate to burst your bubble...

The real question is whether Trump is Jack or Ralph? Pretty sure Eric Trump is Piggy.
if you voted for trump do you regret it now??
It seems that we have a certain population that thinks when trump says the China Virus it is cute.   It is not cute, it is openly racist.
This is what a real president does. Trump hasn‚Äôt even offered assistance.
No just trump because he is our president. I have no interest in the ordinary citizen making investments.   Would you not agree that there is a different standard for our president or do you agree with all the lies he has told ; like the virus will go away?
You left the word Trump out of your Tweet. How unprofessional.

I hate how we have to push Biden to the left when, in a supposedly left leaning party, he should be left to begin with. You don't hear Republicans say "We need to push Trump further right" because they're so far to the right. It's gonna be a long and frustrating 4 more years.
They‚Äôre definitely happy about it but the last administration was putting money into space. In the SLS and asteroid research which has tons of opportunities for space‚Äôs economy and laid the groundwork for the upcoming mars missions so Trump‚Äôs statement just isn‚Äôt true

Trump has not yet exhausted his motions to challenge this subpoena. The Supreme Court, in rejecting his claim of executive immunity, pointed out he still had potential grounds to fight it in state court.
It still baffles me that people really can‚Äôt see that there is something seriously wrong with Trump. It‚Äôs not even about political party. Besides him being a textbook case narcissist, he really needs to have a mental evaluation. A fair evaluation.
April, even if I wasn‚Äôt a Trump supporter I would back the play just for love of that vintage Star Trek TOS still.   If I believed that was actually going on. Which I have no reason to do.
Ha Ha. Trump is holding that title. Liar, cheater, killer and a Narcissistic.  Wait until after he leaves the White House. He need to learn to bring people together instead of dividing.  Put another Republican, Democrat, anybody; just get that crazy man out!
I hate existing through this and need a formal apology from my parents.  I keep saying Laugh Instead of Cry!, but I still have to watch the planet die same time we have to see trump on tv every day?  No.  I need an apology.

Nope. You‚Äôre living in Trump‚Äôs family. The book was so enlightening as to how he became the piece of self promoting shit he is. Everything was always wonderful, &amp; his father enabled his  continued failures by propping him up &amp; patting him on the back.
Trump says again by the time we get there we will probably be in very good shape trump voters are stupidly stupid for believing one word out of this traitors mouth.

Well that‚Äôs a lie. We have documented proof from a few years ago that they were. Court documents revealed that.  They wiretapped Trump Tower in NYC.

Trump is handling COVID-19 like Wilson handled the Spanish Flu. It took 2 years to get rid of the Spanish Flu because Wilson refused to listen to the experts. Sound familiar? Trump is doing the same thing!
The problem is you stated that as in reference to trump needing to take action.   I'm pointing out that if he did, it would make him a dictator.    So is that what you really want.
Where‚Äôs that video you doing PT w u signing on my trump?  I cant find it!
You clearly stated that freedom of movement was a problem, with having the governor's run their own states.   As if trump had any authority to do anything about it.   Guess what the only authority he was in regards to our rights.  Is to blow smoke out his ass.
Restricting public areas that aren‚Äôt as essential as others during a global pandemic is NOT tyranny, Trump forcibly reopening schools is actual tyranny.
Gee, I wonder why Trump stated that he may not accept the results...
We all know trump talks out his ass, and guess what ?   I don't care.   As it has zero bearing on what decisions a state governor makes.   Any governor who let's any president (regardless of party) influence there decisions is a bad governor and need to be fired.
So do I give my two week notice to trump or what?
The only legal way to stop freedom of movement would be a constitutional convention.    Trump dsnt have the legal authority to stop anyone one from freely traveling anywhere they want.   And to do so would make him a dictator.
I've experienced a delay in medication, which I was totally out of because the mail didn't get it here when promised. It caused me some problems without the medication. This could be life-threatening action by Trump &amp; his cronies.

Facebook removes post by Trump as social media giant toughens stance on misleading political speech - The Washington Post
Trump wouldn't the law if it bit him on the ass.
...sit with you? Just a warning? If you can find it in yourself to defend what trump said about Ghislaine Maxwell, you are invited to block me immediately. Because the conversation ends there. And I won't have a thing else to say to you.
I found this early during a discussion.
...that "You HAVE to go by the cases." That's what he said. Which contradicts what you said. But now you're trying to explain to me what trump meant by that. He literally said "No, you have to go by the cases." He says this over and over. Furthering the argument...
That's not what he said. That's what you interpreted on his behalf. The interviewer literally said "I'm talking about deaths per million." trump said "you can't do that." He didn't cite figures to contradict the interviewer. That would have been fine. He just insisted...
Looks so feeble right? Be afraid Trump.
Biden should just be ignored when he asks a black man if he‚Äôs a junkie... Imagine if Trump had said this
Did The Republicans Party knew what they was getting in Donald Trump.
Everytime  says ‚ÄúChina Virus‚Äù it reminds voters how racist Trump is! It also reminds us how every POTUS in the last 90+ years was able to stop viruses very quickly - while Trump has allowed more than 50 9/11s to happen! #vote and #VoteBlue #COVID19 #coronavirus
Agree!  No tax returns from Trump = no debate with Biden!
Trump is üíØ wrong. AGAIN!
WATCH LIVE: President Trump gives White House press conference
I have low expectations. SEC prosecutions have plummeted during this admin. And the SEC chief is a Trump pal.
...about deaths per million. TRUMP said ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù If you don‚Äôt know what someone is talking about, I suggest you keep your opinions about them to yourself.
The complaint, signed by Attorney General Bill Barr, claims the HRRJ has longstanding problems and that officials there have not corrected them. The agreement would be the first consent decree instituted under the Trump administration,  reports:
. once said about Donald Trump "We're gonna impeach the mother fucker".  To all you #Resistance #KHive #BlueWave folks who were hoping she would lose her seat last night because you were bitter about her not endorsing Joe Biden: she's here to stay, so deal with it.
If you think the S*N provides any kind of insight into anything at all you must be crackers. Nobody in their right mind would contemplate a deal with Trump that took 90 days to complete. Even the buffoon Johnson would balk at that.
You said ‚ÄúJust like the left to take things out of context without looking at what the content before and after.‚Äù You defended trump without even knowing that you were contradicting him. I‚Äôm not saying that your argument is wrong in these last two tweets....
I was hoping for specifics maybe to implement in my life. Cause, I‚Äôm responsible for my life. Not Donald trump.
This is the first consent decree agreement made by the Trump administration. Nearly 30 pages long, it's a litany of problems the jail must address.
Rene these are the ‚Äúhigh IQ Trump voters‚Äù that help put Trump in office.
It‚Äôs not about destruction, it‚Äôs about safety but then again YOU Trump trolls that stalk me LOVE witnessing destruction of others so I‚Äôm not surprised by your ignorance.

I think Trump should have to listen to a loop for the rest of his life of his greatest hits. #ConsequencesForTrump #consequencesfortrump

trump has "no sources" for ANY of his bullshit!
Those of us who know why Biden responded that way will probably vote for Biden. However a President needs to speak clearly and avoid snark and sarcasm. He asked a black reporter if they took a drug test. If that was Trump asking what would you think?  is better than that

Suggestions that he skip the debates are coming from pundits outside the campaign.  Biden has never wavered in his commitment to three televised debates.

Less than a year after I gritted my teeth and cast that vote I was no longer a Christian or a Republican.  I can't imagine how many people are leaving the Republican party and Evangelical Christianity behind after the widespread evangelical endorsements for Trump.

Trump's strategy with the press conferences has been a complete 180 - in a good way.  He keeps doing what he is doing and let Biden gaffe away.
But that's just my opinion / .02 - I have to see it to believe it that Trump loses FL, OH, IA, TX, NC, AZ and GA (forgot to list those states).
Honestly - right now it does not feel as bleak for Trump as first week of June.  I'm as pessimistic as anyone at times, but I'm actually optimistic about Trump going into Nov.  The election essentially comes down to WI, MN, MI and PA - b/c he will win FL, OH, IA, TX, NC, AZ

Well in truth. The optics of a photo op with the trump are pretty much the demise of a reputation.
I seldom agree with him, but...  Nobody ever could have been responsible for 160,000 deceased Americans and did not get punished for it.
DeWine and his wife underwent a different type of test in Columbus; one considered to be more accurate than the rapid-result test which showed DeWine to be positive for COVID-19 just ahead of a planned meeting with Trump in Cleveland.
Trump once said a Mexican-American judge couldn't preside over his case.  Once said people who marched with nazis were "fine people." Once called 4 women of color to "go back" to other countries.

Trump issues executive order banning 'transactions' with TikTok, WeChat owners
What?? They‚Äôre worried about the wrong shit they need to worry about cutting Trump in half by 2025
It seems that if Biden is elected president, democrats are going to find themselves doing exactly what republicans are having to do with Trump. Having to translate every asinine comment he makes. ‚ÄúHe was trying to say..‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat he meant was...‚Äù  ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #AnElectionToRemember

Well, Trump issued his executive order to ban TikTok in 45 days if it's still in Chinese hands, and - hoo-boy! - is *this* part rich...
Let help you out. Trump is the Republican Party without the sheep‚Äôs clothing.
JUST IN: The orders say that the ban on TikTok will take effect in 45 days.
Alright, is anybody going to tell him who really threatens the national security, the foreign policy and the economy ?
President Trump signs order banning TikTok, WeChat in 45 days  ‚Å¶
#BREAKING: President Donald Trump said Thursday night that he has signed an executive order to shut down the use of Chinese-based social media applications TikTok and WeChat in 45 days.  #News3Politics
Tik Tok WILL be banned in 45 days from now after Trump signed an Executive Order, Don‚Äôt let him restrict your free speech, this goes to all Tik Tokers. Pass it on #tiktokban
Not trump banning tiktok. He ruins everything.
Imagine if Trump had asked a black, male interviewer, "Are you on cocaine? Are you a junkie?" as Biden did?  OMG what a difference it would have made in the news.

President Trump hangs in there because he is a better man than Obama and Biden could ever hope to be he doesn't disrespect Biden Obama Nancy and let's not forget Hillary but Tgey disrespect him all the time I hope it'll be Trump 2020 he has my vote
Biden doesn't want a debate he can't win he can't think on his feet and any dishonest thing the Democratics can do they will why is it that they can get away with doing these things and they don't have to pay for them I with you President Trump 2020

wow.. but not really surprised.. they'd gladly help human rights violators like China but never say a kind word about Trump
‚ÄúWe took a chance on Trump. We thought he would represent our values and lead our great nation. Instead, he has imperiled our republic. It‚Äôs OK to change your mind, Ohio. We Did‚Ä¶‚Äù
He did nothing? üôÑ But his approval rating is higher than any President and he‚Äôs still resprected today. He is still ‚ÄúOur President‚Äù. We have never recognized Trump as president. He doesn‚Äôt get that respect. Obama brought this country out of the Great Recession.
Right but ofc were all familiar w the lesser of 2 evils concept but it‚Äôs fucked up. We gotta get Trump out by any means necessary..whether it‚Äôs by impeachment, assasina-tion, or voting..first 2 seem unlikely at this point
Trump must not be concerned about alienating Catholics. I think that‚Äôs a miscalculation.
I think we likely won‚Äôt agree, but I think Trump, like any good salesman, knows how to play to the crowd. His crowd at least. Racist? I‚Äôm not sure.  Biden is no saint or savior for anyone, and time will show he‚Äôs not mentally fit for the Oval Office. Racist? Similarly unsure.

Pelosi &amp; the House passed a version of the bill &amp; sent it to the Turtle &amp; Senate 70 DAYS AGO.

And you cannot think of anything intelligent to say so you resort to insults. Trump has been running the country just fine, just because we like him or vote for him does not mean we are stupid. It's not Biden we gotta worry about he don't want to be Pres. he'll hand it to VP

"We begged Republicans..." That's the problem with the Dem party, right there. Obama got pushed around on debt ceiling and Garland. Trump gets his tax cuts and no COVID relief. Dems are weak, unless they're attacking progressives, then they band together and go full bore.
Attention #America - Do N0t, under any circumstance fall for  stunts. Let‚Äôs address the YUGe elephant in the room. Trump thinks if he dangles Kanya West b4 black Americans will clamor to support him, split the vote &amp; #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica will fail.

I hate how we have to push Biden to the left when, in a supposedly left leaning party, he should be left to begin with. You don't hear Republicans say "We need to push Trump further right" because they're so far to the right. It's gonna be a long and frustrating 4 more years.

75th anniversary of #Hiroshima And it is marked by an occupant in the OvalOffice who has crossed into the realm of irrational possibility. Recall #trump's campaign promise, that he won't hesitate to drop a #nuke in the Iranian dessert? Another Tomahawk strike? #77Days! after 11/3
#trump has 77 days in office if he loses the election on Nov 3, 2020 and is forced by whomever to relinquish the OvalOffice at noon on Jan 20, 2021. The prospect of what this lunatic might try as Lame Duck is so foreboding it has taken me this 3rd try to get number days right: 77
Or, delay mail to the homes and businesses of elected officials. In normal times that would be unethical. But the USPS employees aren't the ones who politicized their institution. The work they're so proud of doing so well is being undercut by their own postmaster, a Trump donor.

Why do suppose "woke" liberals like to insult so much?  Weird how your behavior is very similar to Trump.  If you don't like a response, you immediately take to insults and call people clowns.  Interesting and revealing.

I couldn't care less about Trump, but the curve was flattened in April. Virginia has seen 1% of our citizens test positive and .09% hospitalized so far. Doubtful Trump has authority to mandate masks. Each state must do its thing.
Moscow Mitch and destructive Trump maybe they can buddy up in the 9th inferno. Burn baby burn as they have so far committed criminal activity and thwarted integrity and inclusiveness.
We're going to have to agree to disagree here.  Yes, Trump is a symptom of what's been going on for a long time, and not the cause. But he's incredibly destructive and needs to be removed. McConnell has been a blocker since Obama was President, and enables Trump.
The stupidity of that comment is unfathomable except that it comes from D for dysfunctional T traitor (Russia) Trump. Hammer him every single day. Tons of payback is in order. He must go down in the flames he has created. His crimes are innumerable.
#FoxNewsSunday News focused on aberrant #Trump, but deliberately mean-spirited #MitchMcConnell not to be outdone. Wife, shipping heiress, collecting small business #COVID19 payments isn't gratifying enough. Mitch: No corporate liability for workers (serfs) #COVID-injured at work.
The rich are buying up houses and properties at fire sale prices aided 100% by Herr Trump. At every turn he has made way for the rich/ultra-rich to benefit from the downgrading of all other classes. Just how much money has Trump et al made off his nepotism
Trump‚Äôs reality = ratings and reactions.   And that‚Äôs it.
So now almost all of us in American society have accepted the idea that #Trump is #Fascism. The #Evangelicals are left to themselves, some afraid to admit it, most lauding in it. The idea of Fascism is Repulsive Incarnate. A return to Animalism, the Brute Savage #StateOfNature.
WHAT THE FUCK MAKES #TRUMP TICK? AND, THOSE AROUND HIM, LIKE STEPHEN MILLER? We all know by now the categorical obvious: Narcissism. Greed. Stupidity. Biased hatred. BUT WHAT UNDERLIES EVEN ALL OF THAT? Frankly, it takes you into the metaphysical world, the Outer Limits Sphere---

On one hand "whatever it takes" to get people to see the dangers of this adminstration, and what the GOP has been enabling.  On the other hand, wow this is what it took? I guess he'd have to personally hear Trump say the n-word in order to believe he's racist, too, huh?
Oh hell yeah I'm voting. First time in awhile. Too much at stake to let Trump get another 4 years.

You remain silent while the  regulations enacted to end racial discrimination in housing are scrapped. You voted against Voting Rights. Your homage is hypocritical
Got to wonder if low energy has to do with the dismal polling numbers. I know they were bad for Trump in 2016 as well, but the feeling of inevitable defeat has to squelch some firepower in the takes.

I'm always afraid that he is going to drop down to his knees to start praying to Trump. I haven't seen a look like that since the seventh grade.
Trump's strategy with the press conferences has been a complete 180 - in a good way.  He keeps doing what he is doing and let Biden gaffe away.
But that's just my opinion / .02 - I have to see it to believe it that Trump loses FL, OH, IA, TX, NC, AZ and GA (forgot to list those states).
Honestly - right now it does not feel as bleak for Trump as first week of June.  I'm as pessimistic as anyone at times, but I'm actually optimistic about Trump going into Nov.  The election essentially comes down to WI, MN, MI and PA - b/c he will win FL, OH, IA, TX, NC, AZ

No he dropped out people writing him in will only split the vote from Biden and make it easier for trump to win. The better a third party does the worse the candidate closest to them will do its called the spoiler effects

The family Trump,money,money,money, now get your kid‚Äôs,not ours back to school,you back to work, I have a golf Tee time,my hourlyVirus test,very important.  The  doesn‚Äôt get any better, unfortunately.    Trump keeps lying  Americans keep a dying
Donald Trump has put into practice the GOP agenda since Ronald Reagan to turn the GOP into a ruling elite. One only has to look at the negotiating positions in the coronavirus bill to see that the GOP is only interested in crushing the lowest 90% of Americans.
Oh and let‚Äôs not forget that when Trump was putting a team together to evaluate the pandemic issue  was more concerned with signing articles of impeachment. She could have done that a month or 2 earlier but no she waited....as if it was planned for the plandemic.
Just remember that when Trump said shut down travel from China he was called a racist.  went to Chinatown w/o mask and said everything is fine come to Chinatown. Dem cities have been all about shutdown, but you can protest/riot but you can‚Äôt go to church.
Why doesn‚Äôt Kristen Welker question Trump as aggressively as she‚Äôs questioning Speaker Pelosi? I realize Trump would shut her down, she‚Äôs lucky Madam Speaker is gracious enough not to.
You would have to be heartless to not feel for this little boy, can you imagine how scared he must be Skip. No one will ever justify doing this to a child. Many don't speak English or understand what has happened to their families. Lost &amp; abandon, trump did this with his buddies!
What laws have Trump advanced or what executive order has he signed that leads you to believe Trump is trying a "new Jim Crow."  "Jim Crow" were actual laws in various states and locales in the South.  Can't wait to have you enumerate the new ones Trump is advancing.
Trump need to look at all the mismanagement of government funds, damn near everybody in his administration is guilty of using tax payers dollars illegally, his kids as well. Biden and his A G will make sure the American people find out before he have them all prosecuted
Attack Dr Fauci &amp; his  family with death threats, when all he has ever done is help get the truth out how he sees it in the moment Another one of trump blunders trump send a message to his out of control base of white supremacist &amp; this is what you get! Hate will always get HATE

Agreed.  didn't have to wait &amp; see what a Trump presidency would look like to speak out against it. From day one she called a racist wanna be dictator what he was. She voted for HRC. She didn't write anyone in and she did NOT vote for Trump. This is smart. Very smart.
This is your daily reminder that Donald Trump lost by nearly 3 million votes and needed foreign interference to take office. #illegitimate #TrumpResignNow
You're just like your president, you want deflect. Your president is the reason this has spread the way it has! You want to blame fauci. trump has America looking like a joke in the field of science.

They're both racists but Trump still won so get the fuck over it, stop complaining on social media like a Gen-Z-TidePod-Eater, and vote in November good godüôÑüôÑüôÑ

We did it boys, Gen Z is no more üòí
When Trump speaks, he's completely in the moment, he doesn't understand how people remember things from one moment to the next.
Fake it till you make it in one of its highest forms. Example: Donald Fucking Trump
I'm not sure their ads are working though. They get a lot of likes and retweets, but that's because they're satisfying to people who are already voting against Trump anyways.  I doubt they're convincing many people to either vote for Biden or simply not to vote for Trump.
To be precise, he clarified what he meant. That‚Äôs more than Trump does while his staff and Fox run in circles to try to explain what he meant to say!
Aaawww look the Democrat sheep will defend a person who has no business in office just like Trump supporters....
Kanye West is actively anti-black and actively facilitating systemic racism. He‚Äôs racist. The state of his health is irrelevant. Idc.   He‚Äôs well enough to collab with Trump on the low low still. üòå

OMG -tRump is a Lying POS. His lies are lies built on poorly constructed lies... If they have a vaccine by Nov 3rd ‚Äî it will not have been properly tested!  This idiot says dangerous shit &amp; he is willing to sacrifice your children &amp; you so he can avoid paying for his corruption!
We knew trump was a terrible president from the start, most of us.
Hang in there Michael, trump is on our last nerve. Take a break when you need to. We are here if you need one of us. Sending you positive thoughts &amp; blessings my friend ‚ù§
I know Jeanne, trump  has robbed us. How many more have to die before trump can be stopped? For both our dads that proudly served our country We stand up for them &amp; those today that still sacrifice so much. Sending you positive thoughts &amp; blessings my friend. Stay safe out there!
I don't give a damn if you don't like Democrats. But my God, have you no shame? As a reminder, this is who Donald Trump claimed would be "hurting God" if elected President:
but Donald Trump has taken us to new lows. I'd agree that he says the quiet parts out loud -- other Republicans dared not do more than insinuate the things he happily shouts from a podium or through his Twitter feed -- but the cheers it brings are twice as disgusting.
As someone who genuinely believes that religion and government should remain separate, I would normally just tweet my previous tweet re: white evangelicals + Trump, riddled with disdain for the hypocrisy &amp; absurdity of it all, &amp; keep it moving. But tonight, I just can't do that.
Why are you even on here No one is listening trump has torn our democracy apart trump is a criminal Sorry you don't understand that trump could have stopped this It took till now for he to even wear a mask You take offense because of a picture? Well l do also with him killing us!
I said this weeks ago! I said I want him to sit so close to my granddaughter that he can smell when she farts! Once one of his loved ones are affected by this virus, Trump may wake up!

l'm in Virginia, trump doesn't have a chance here.
It's funny, I think their best ads are the ones directed at him. Problem is that it's good for unhinging Trump, but 40% will say he's their guy no matter what. You gotta speak to the independents not sure if they should vote or not.

Trump has got to be the most ignorant president we have ever had. We need a mute bottom on him!
Biden says something racist. Trump says something blasphemous. Kanye really trying to stop Biden. We're all fucked this Election.
The question for her and others is: do you want more years of upheaval and chaotic governance and more submission to Putin? Trump doesn‚Äôt listen to republicans now, another term and they‚Äôll truly be unnecessary.
We need to cleanse the entire GOP when Biden wins. If there‚Äôs not a law to do this then use an EO, that‚Äôs what Trump does!
Right but ofc were all familiar w the lesser of 2 evils concept but it‚Äôs fucked up. We gotta get Trump out by any means necessary..whether it‚Äôs by impeachment, assasina-tion, or voting..first 2 seem unlikely at this point

Our kind of energy? Against God? Government is supposed 2Bsecular so as 2not tramp on religions their elected officials favor getting a Minority majority, Ua Catholic, Baptist, Protestant, Mormon, there‚Äôs no place for these with Trump‚Äôs religion, well known TV preacher says so.
Donald Trump = 666 Code of A=49, B=50, C=51...Z=74. He's the current Antichrist whose actions are the opposite of the Christ, e.g. he's extremely greedy and helps the uber-rich.   D52+O63+N62+A49+L60+D52 (338) + T68+R66+U69+M61+P64 (328) = 666
WTF does that have to do with race bot?
The fact that you‚Äôre a trump stan only proves this whole this is a desperate ploy.
He has something up his sleeve. trump &amp; his lemmings can't be trusted. Regardless of the vote he has already said "We'll see" when asked more than once if he will except his lose. That's why he is already screaming about MAIL-IN-VOTES being a means to cheat him out of OUR W.H!
Perfect! People will be safe to attend the Biden Inauguration in January.
trump thinks he's a "tuff guy". Like some type of gangster. Like most cowards he has a big mouth &amp; has others do his dirty work.

If Trump wins AZ and holds FL, GA, OH, NC while winning ONE of WI, MN, MI to go along with NE2 AND ME2, he wins and doesn't even need to worry about PA or the other two swing states (the two others not counted out of MI, MN, WI) - he's at 270 (or more with MI)
Very, very encouraging for Trump winning AZ
With MI it really depends if Dems come out in droves for Biden in the Detroit area (and Trump's surging favor. w/ blacks) - I don't know that that occurs.  I ALSO think there are many, many Rs who are furious with the MI Governor, of which this could be a referendum on her.
Trump is actually meeting with the AZ Governor today - seems like the Gov. has a very rigid plan for mail-in voting that will not be fraudulent.
I'm actually very high on Trump's chances in PA
üòÇü§£üòÇ I thought the same when I heard Trump say that.
Bernie and his people are not team players. Everything has to be their way or they make mischief. They are the reason Trump is in office and may be the reason Trump might win again in November. Bernie is just a rock thrower and would be just as bad at governing as is Donald Trump
trump has one agenda,  saving himself &amp; remaining in OUR W.H  everything else has zero importance People are dying a "1000" everyday For trump mere numbers NOT human beings Now our children forced back to school will be his next failed experiment They are not expendable Not one!
Trump lives rent free in the head of  XD Worst case of TDS in the whole TDS pandemic.
I'm aware that is unlikely to happen, but the concept that all of the evil that has been done by Trump, all of the death + pain + anxiety + theft + cruelty, is still not enough to outweigh supporting a law that ensures poor women have bodily autonomy because your moral code

I have to laugh when I see Guy Lewis on Fox News since he was one who brokered Epstein's sweetheart deal putting a pedophile &amp; child rapist on the street with a few weekends in jail. I guess he'll take money or publicity from anybody who will put him on TV. Another Trump shyster!

Mitch, Lindsey &amp; all the others knowingly put a criminal in OUR W.H. Each one is guilty of being complicit with trump. Every death is on their shoulders. They could have stopped this instead they chose to protect him, they took "The Lambs To Be Slaughtered" Even now they continue
My 82-year-old mother is saying "fuck" which is definitely a Trump development.
A researcher‚Äôs post back in May, posted no numbers,Ucould extrapolate,160,000 deaths by end ofSummer,&amp;knowing Trump would throw the kids in as a human shield for re-electing, 1,500,000 by January. 1 student class of 30,1person infects 3-4over14 days, 3  to the 30th power is what?

It's all right there in what I've said. "The sound of a trump", "For trumpet shall sound", that's when those that are alive in Christ Jesus will be changed  in an instant. The moment Christ comes into your heart and you confess Him as Lord, you are changed; you can't see it.

Trump's skill is misdirection.  He is outrageous. This gets him attention and allows him to get out of typical interviews tactics. He sets reasonable people of balance. He reveals the next outrageous thing before you can process the last one.

Finally we learn that Trump had promised to not use ‚Äòjunk bonds‚Äô to finance Taj Mahal. In its collapse it was learn that Trump did use junk bonds. NJ banned Trump from casinos.

One of the best quotes about Trump that I've heard this year. Well done Mr. Rather.
Anything even remotely positive about one Donald J. Trump.
Munchkin gave Trump's companies billions from the business bailouts because of coronavirus that's why he won't release the figures telling who got what.
Trump was asked why he called it an attack and not an accident, especially since Lebanese officials say they have not determined the cause of the explosion.
No, they can‚Äôt, it‚Äòs not profitable daily. Hence the reason Amazon, et. al. DON‚ÄôT &amp; why the PO is less profitable/less efficient. Amazon‚Äòs actually a main reason Trump is pissed at the PO as they contract with Bezos, who owns the Wash. Post, which says bad things about Trump.

Trump can't even start a meeting on time how in hell do you think he can run a country or solve a pandemic. You have to be organized to analyze and problem solve. He isn't organized enough to have a meeting on time. He blunders from one thing to next with no system. Look at Covid
Here we go! Cue the fear card that criminals (aka black males) will threaten your safety.  As if Trump has a real plan. He‚Äôs the one advocating violence through racist actions and divisive language. He‚Äôs the real threat.
Look at a 1st day of school in Georgia, it's obvious this opening school early will be a failure. Than again that's trump moto. Obama/Biden left trumpba growing economy with a pandemic taskforce and trump messed all that up. Talking about M.A.G.A when he the one mess America up

Trump said the virus was under control and Swan asked how with all the deaths incurred and Trump says ‚Äúit is what it is.‚Äù That statement expresses his lack of empathy and he‚Äôll be remembered for that!

Trump says he has pandemic under control: 'People are dying...and it is what it is'
I blame Trump for all the entitled yahoos who refuse to do what's necessary to keep this virus under wraps. They took their cue from his refusal to take it seriously, from calling the virus a hoax to refusing to endorse mask-wearing. That's on him, too.
If you can watch this and vote for Trump, I don‚Äôt know what to say to you. This looks like something off of Veep it‚Äôs fucking pathetic. Is this who we want leading us through a pandemic? I‚Äôm voting for Biden! #Biden2020 #Trumpisajoke #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace

It is sad that as of today the only path to removing Trump is Joe Biden.  America could have done so much better.  Biden is so clueless about healthcare and so many other issues.  He only looks good when compared to Trump.

I'm always afraid that he is going to drop down to his knees to start praying to Trump. I haven't seen a look like that since the seventh grade.
Trump's strategy with the press conferences has been a complete 180 - in a good way.  He keeps doing what he is doing and let Biden gaffe away.
But that's just my opinion / .02 - I have to see it to believe it that Trump loses FL, OH, IA, TX, NC, AZ and GA (forgot to list those states).
Honestly - right now it does not feel as bleak for Trump as first week of June.  I'm as pessimistic as anyone at times, but I'm actually optimistic about Trump going into Nov.  The election essentially comes down to WI, MN, MI and PA - b/c he will win FL, OH, IA, TX, NC, AZ
Seeing  liked this wild tweet by a wildly unqualified spoiler candidate makes me 1000% sure she doesn't dislike Trump enough to vote for her Dad's good friend to save the soul of our nation. I'm exactly zero percent surprised.

Donald Trump has put into practice the GOP agenda since Ronald Reagan to turn the GOP into a ruling elite. One only has to look at the negotiating positions in the coronavirus bill to see that the GOP is only interested in crushing the lowest 90% of Americans.
Oh and let‚Äôs not forget that when Trump was putting a team together to evaluate the pandemic issue  was more concerned with signing articles of impeachment. She could have done that a month or 2 earlier but no she waited....as if it was planned for the plandemic.
Just remember that when Trump said shut down travel from China he was called a racist.  went to Chinatown w/o mask and said everything is fine come to Chinatown. Dem cities have been all about shutdown, but you can protest/riot but you can‚Äôt go to church.
Why doesn‚Äôt Kristen Welker question Trump as aggressively as she‚Äôs questioning Speaker Pelosi? I realize Trump would shut her down, she‚Äôs lucky Madam Speaker is gracious enough not to.

What laws have Trump advanced or what executive order has he signed that leads you to believe Trump is trying a "new Jim Crow."  "Jim Crow" were actual laws in various states and locales in the South.  Can't wait to have you enumerate the new ones Trump is advancing.

I'm not sure their ads are working though. They get a lot of likes and retweets, but that's because they're satisfying to people who are already voting against Trump anyways.  I doubt they're convincing many people to either vote for Biden or simply not to vote for Trump.

DeWine and his wife underwent a different type of test in Columbus; one considered to be more accurate than the rapid-result test which showed DeWine to be positive for COVID-19 just ahead of a planned meeting with Trump in Cleveland.

Only thing I agree with Trump about.
Double-, triple-, and quadruple-check to make sure it did indeed happen... then pray we all make it to Inauguration Day (because I don't put it past Trump or his enablers to try ruining EVERYTHING in the months between election and inauguration).
This is my favorite dance of all time..üòÄüòÄüòÄ Stay safe as well! Let's get this CLOWN TRUMP ü§°ü§° out of the White House
People who lack intelligence and morals: - donald trump - his byatch gym jordan
Trump gets more deranged every day.
There goes Trump calling you out again
fuck the government. fuck trump. fuck ICE.
He did nothing? üôÑ But his approval rating is higher than any President and he‚Äôs still resprected today. He is still ‚ÄúOur President‚Äù. We have never recognized Trump as president. He doesn‚Äôt get that respect. Obama brought this country out of the Great Recession.
Trump has got to be the most ignorant president we have ever had. We need a mute bottom on him!
Biden says something racist. Trump says something blasphemous. Kanye really trying to stop Biden. We're all fucked this Election.
The question for her and others is: do you want more years of upheaval and chaotic governance and more submission to Putin? Trump doesn‚Äôt listen to republicans now, another term and they‚Äôll truly be unnecessary.
We need to cleanse the entire GOP when Biden wins. If there‚Äôs not a law to do this then use an EO, that‚Äôs what Trump does!
Right but ofc were all familiar w the lesser of 2 evils concept but it‚Äôs fucked up. We gotta get Trump out by any means necessary..whether it‚Äôs by impeachment, assasina-tion, or voting..first 2 seem unlikely at this point
Trump‚Äôs Christians.
And where I live, AMERICAN flags are TRUMP flags! And there are a ton of people proudly flying them every day.
And he's found the secret to making lead turn to gold. Wait that's not trump. He turns Everything to shit. Flush the turd November 3rd.
Bitch I'm voting in person fuck a mail in ballot Trump gotta go üò° we been goin to Walmart on Morse since the pandemic atarted we goin be ight &amp;  you capp as hell you just want those 2 weeks off you aint slick fuhhh
Pelosi &amp; the House passed a version of the bill &amp; sent it to the Turtle &amp; Senate 70 DAYS AGO. That‚Äôs right, 70 FUCKING DAYS ago they could‚Äòve started negotiations but the Turtle/Repubs refused. It‚Äôs not Dems hatred for Trump, it‚Äôs Repubs hatred of YOU &amp;  the rest of our citizens.
Our kind of energy? Against God? Government is supposed 2Bsecular so as 2not tramp on religions their elected officials favor getting a Minority majority, Ua Catholic, Baptist, Protestant, Mormon, there‚Äôs no place for these with Trump‚Äôs religion, well known TV preacher says so.
Donald Trump = 666 Code of A=49, B=50, C=51...Z=74. He's the current Antichrist whose actions are the opposite of the Christ, e.g. he's extremely greedy and helps the uber-rich.   D52+O63+N62+A49+L60+D52 (338) + T68+R66+U69+M61+P64 (328) = 666
He has something up his sleeve. trump &amp; his lemmings can't be trusted. Regardless of the vote he has already said "We'll see" when asked more than once if he will except his lose. That's why he is already screaming about MAIL-IN-VOTES being a means to cheat him out of OUR W.H!
Perfect! People will be safe to attend the Biden Inauguration in January.
trump thinks he's a "tuff guy". Like some type of gangster. Like most cowards he has a big mouth &amp; has others do his dirty work.
Trump
I'm all for a Biden/Trump debate. One crazy trashing another crazy live with no filter is peak entertainment. #Debate2020
Upon further thought, I‚Äôve decided to vote for Trump in  November.
Imagine if Trump was just a genuinely good guy. United States could really have something to stand for. To bad he a clown smh
...what Donald Trump has done for you with his poor leadership and inaction... And ...pray that Trump will be held accountable... There, fixed it for you.
Haha Trump people might believe that lol
Trump‚Äôs spiritual advisor says God should bow down to Trump. They‚Äôve all got a warped idea of God and Christianity.
Because he decided that being ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù (and ain‚Äôt that ironic?) would get them on his side. The only thing he‚Äôs ‚Äúpro-‚Äú is Trump.
So should all the governors who follow Trump‚Äôs advice!
Trump will absolutely announce  "a vaccine is ready &amp; we will be distributing it in the next few weeks" at the end of October.
I would also, my fear is on Nov 3rd we may be in a situation to STAY IN PLACE l don't trust trump, Barr or the GOP  or what they are capable of Having the  MAIL-IN-VOTE may be the only way we have to be counted Never thought 6 mon ago in our wildest dreams We would be like this
If this was Trump instead of Biden, ALL msm outlets would be ALL OVER IT.  HOW is what he said OK? This ONGOING  BLATANT media BIAS is why SO MANY OF US chose to #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever
Don‚Äôt sue Seattle, sue the federal government because it‚Äôs the doing of Trump and Barr.
The Federal Reserve is propping up the market with monetary measures which will come home to roost big time after Trump and his mob are gone.
Yep, Biden is racist... not unlike Trump, or yourself, for example.
At this time NO! I would have to see where we are, what kind of proof they can show it works Anything trump has his hand in l dont trust.

Blatantly unconditional and she knows it, but thanks for validating my decision to support President Trump. I wasn't going to vote for the man, but people like you convinced me otherwise.
Guess the NRA is a little stripped for cash now and won‚Äôt be able to help finance the Trump campaign.
Susan Rice's son is outspoken pro-Trump GOP leader at Stanford  #FoxNews
If you vote for Biden you are taking away votes from Jorgensen and will make it easy for Trump to win.

The military has already said they will not participate in anything Trump orders within the US
Well since the statute of limitations will not have run after Trump gets replaced we‚Äôre going to be tweeting about all the prosecutions that are going to happen to him
We all just need to stop bitching about life in a pandemic &amp; step up to help our communities survive the Trump administration
The USPS is still doing their job, they've just been limited by Trump's new Postmaster.  SO HELP THEM
You wanna beat Trump at his own game?  Be human cuz he sure as hell can't.  Check on your community.  If you help them register to vote, go back later and pick that ballet up.  Take it to the USPS for them.
Y'all  If we want to see change happen we're gonna have to start in our communities  Trump's tryna make the USPS implode, but we don't have to let him

Please retweet this, should we not forget. This is who trump is, in all his "glory"!
He was placed in that position to slow down the dispensing &amp; returning ballots in states which Trump is losing or lost. Trump is involved in this conspiracy. Carriers have been instructed if they say anything about what's going on they will be fired. Sound familiar Trump bullshit
It was SO PUMP SO PUMP It was SO RIGHT SO RIGHT Vote for TRUMP.   He's our Guy!
This is your daily reminder that Donald Trump lost by nearly 3 million votes and needed foreign interference to take office. #illegitimate #TrumpResignNow
Another example of how trump destroys everyone &amp; everything he touches. He needs to keep his distance from trump. Turning his factory into mask production is a nobel action. For that l am grateful.
l see your point however he still backs trump 100%. Perhaps he should stick to making pillows &amp; back away from trump
Oh, so trump and rnc encouraging their voters to vote for bernie in the primary wasn't a thing? ü§î
Vets know trump. And they don‚Äôt trust him.
It's humorous that you losers think there are millions of Trump supporters and right wing nutjobs who watch the NBA loyally - but I hate to burst your bubble...
Look at you Trump supporters all butt-hurt... LeBron isn't going to lose sleep because of a waste of space like you are mad that he's wealthy and getting paid to do what he enjoys. I know that's a hard concept to imagine.

Trump Is Gonna Seriously Damage Or Destroy His Career. SMH KanyeListen To Those Who Love You. Fall Back.
trump has literally talked about his own (13 year old) daughter being hotter than his wife, was close friends with epstein, and if he didn‚Äôt participate he KNEW epstein was a pedophile and didn‚Äôt do anything. bring proof.
What appeal? Honestly, at this point I can find nothing that the left likes about him other than the fact that he‚Äôs not Donald Trump. The regular guy shtick is entirely fake. He‚Äôs been a politician for five decades. If you think career politicians are ‚Äúregular guys‚Äù you‚Äôre high.
"Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report"
Trump Fake Ads From The Man Who Invented Fake News! Desperate POTUS! Expect everything coming out if his mouth to drip with lies. We're in the last 90 days. VOTE!
#realDonaldTrump We will re-elect President Trump in November 2020. We want a person who is a true American.and not a Communist Democrat. Biden, go back in your shelter.
Because it is POLITICAL  and they don't want Trump to win...so they lie!
A client was in my office today; she said she thinks Biden has Alzheimer's and she hate to vote for him but she can't stand Trump. I suggested that she simply doesn't vote ... she agreed!!
Trump think we care Obama tried to make it so he wouldn‚Äôt get Elected? Ha he knew how we felt he tried his best

He‚Äôs keeping trump on track, that‚Äôs the point of an interview . He ask him a question and trump would go off topic .
I do not want to play the tie game - just takes one or two rogue "never Trumper" delegates to defeat Trump
The post in question featured a link to a Fox News video in which Trump says children are ‚Äúvirtually immune‚Äù to the virus.
Well he is Nostradamus, a military expert, etc, etc.    So
Well, in Trump‚Äôs defense, he knows a lot about bombing, bankrupting, being a failure, etc.
It‚Äôs like we are Trump‚Äôs second grade music teacher who he gave a black eye because he knew more about music then his teacher. Source The Art of the Deal Now we are trying to teach a 75 year old dotard, science, medicine. Might as well talk to a pet rock.
Donald Trump will create his own downfall against his own supporters, becsuase he lies about everything, who wants a President who lies 90% of the time, and verified by CNN and Foxnews., andMSNBC NEWS,. Go figure. Trump lies for political gain, the wrong message for a President!
Nope. You‚Äôre living in Trump‚Äôs family. The book was so enlightening as to how he became the piece of self promoting shit he is. Everything was always wonderful, &amp; his father enabled his  continued failures by propping him up &amp; patting him on the back.
Trump is nothing if not diabolical!
Trump‚Äôs ass.
If you haven‚Äôt read Mary Trump‚Äôs book, do. It explains everything anyone needs to know about how and why Trump does and says what he does. There‚Äôs no cure for him except to vote him out!
and hopefully Trump himself on Nov 3.
Yeah Trump already won.

Does your Supreme Leader know that you‚Äôre calling the global pandemic an international health crisis? Does Trump?
Absolutely Shamrock, 1st there's the fear of being shot while teaching our children, now this. Until the experts (NOT trump) has a handle on making everyone safe, children need to be taught at home. If everyone complied, the country would have a chance to get this under control!

Well, you have obviously not paid any attention to the morons who inhabit Trump world. It will end up on Facebook, be shared a billion times and used as proof that ‚ÄúJoe Biden is near death, here look‚Äù by the dimwitted denizens of MAGA.
Mark Meadows the White House Chief of Staff is just another cronies of Trump who likes to lie a lot.after watching this interview now with CNN  Wolf Blitzer,  Meadows was very agitated in the interview,  which means he‚Äôs hiding something from a physiological view
Mark Meadows is a flunky for the POTUS. He supports Trump saying "It is what it is" and "Kids are virtually immune to the Virus" and saying "That is not what the president meant about voting" He is the Chief of Shit!!   #cnnlive #donlemon #CuomoPrimeTime  #DumbestPresidentEver

Like numbers?  Donald Trump = 666 using the Code of A=49, B=50, C=51...Z=74. He's the current Antichrist whose actions are the opposite of the Christ, e.g. he's extremely greedy and helps the uber-rich.   D52+O63+N62+A49+L60+D52 (338) + T68+R66+U69+M61+P64 (328) = 666

If Trump wins AZ and holds FL, GA, OH, NC while winning ONE of WI, MN, MI to go along with NE2 AND ME2, he wins and doesn't even need to worry about PA or the other two swing states (the two others not counted out of MI, MN, WI) - he's at 270 (or more with MI)
Very, very encouraging for Trump winning AZ
With MI it really depends if Dems come out in droves for Biden in the Detroit area (and Trump's surging favor. w/ blacks) - I don't know that that occurs.  I ALSO think there are many, many Rs who are furious with the MI Governor, of which this could be a referendum on her.
Trump is actually meeting with the AZ Governor today - seems like the Gov. has a very rigid plan for mail-in voting that will not be fraudulent.
I'm actually very high on Trump's chances in PA
üòÇü§£üòÇ I thought the same when I heard Trump say that.
Bernie and his people are not team players. Everything has to be their way or they make mischief. They are the reason Trump is in office and may be the reason Trump might win again in November. Bernie is just a rock thrower and would be just as bad at governing as is Donald Trump
trump has one agenda,  saving himself &amp; remaining in OUR W.H  everything else has zero importance People are dying a "1000" everyday For trump mere numbers NOT human beings Now our children forced back to school will be his next failed experiment They are not expendable Not one!
Trump lives rent free in the head of  XD Worst case of TDS in the whole TDS pandemic.
I'm aware that is unlikely to happen, but the concept that all of the evil that has been done by Trump, all of the death + pain + anxiety + theft + cruelty, is still not enough to outweigh supporting a law that ensures poor women have bodily autonomy because your moral code

Mitch, Lindsey &amp; all the others knowingly put a criminal in OUR W.H. Each one is guilty of being complicit with trump. Every death is on their shoulders. They could have stopped this instead they chose to protect him, they took "The Lambs To Be Slaughtered" Even now they continue
My 82-year-old mother is saying "fuck" which is definitely a Trump development.
A researcher‚Äôs post back in May, posted no numbers,Ucould extrapolate,160,000 deaths by end ofSummer,&amp;knowing Trump would throw the kids in as a human shield for re-electing, 1,500,000 by January. 1 student class of 30,1person infects 3-4over14 days, 3  to the 30th power is what?

Didn't President Trump say he may give his acceptance speech at the White House?
My husband wears his Trump hat all the time. We have been traveling from Virginia thru to South Dakota and people are always saying they love his hat. His response, ‚Äúl love your politics!‚Äù
It's all right there in what I've said. "The sound of a trump", "For trumpet shall sound", that's when those that are alive in Christ Jesus will be changed  in an instant. The moment Christ comes into your heart and you confess Him as Lord, you are changed; you can't see it.

Trump wouldn‚Äôt act re Russian bounties-after 5 mo.(July 13) Pompeo finally did-w/o telling him! ‚ÄúPompeo‚Äôs private move is latest example of common occurrence:US officials quietly carrying out actions at odds w/Trump‚Äôs statements&amp;stance re important issues‚Äù
Is anyone else legit surprised by this move? I guess I truly don‚Äôt understand where the line is for these guys ‚Äî how are they still cool with President Trump as a ‚ÄòMan of God‚Äô at this point? Like, what is Christianity even now?
He must be using the same hair treatment as those trump boys (Dapper Dan‚Äôs maybe?)

By trying to take credit for something that is already law thanks to Obama that the Trump administration is actively in court trying to overturn?  How does that make any sense?
Trump is ignorant and self centered. People are suffering and in need of government services in Red and Blue states, and to a large degree because he's totally incompetent. It's been proven that happy talk does not solve either the COVID -19 crisis or the unemployment problem.
And how many millions are still unemployed because we have an incompetent leader and selfish president concerned only with his reelection? Any gains in employment are despite Trump and his useless happy talk not because of him.

He's for cutting social security, his crime Bill, he voted for the Hyde amendment ect.  He says nothing now, but he has a long ass record. I understand that "he's with Obama" is definitely a piece of it, but, it's not everything. It's more about voting Trump out for people IMO.
We‚Äôre all tired of wondering who you are today. You‚Äôre still backing a certifiably insane Trump. You'd do well to back off patting yourself on the back for being his cheerleader. He's losing in a miserable fashion.

Honestly, there is no legitimate gripe you can level against Biden, at this point, that trump does not embody in a worse way.
Instead, he did nothing while focusing on a racist and xenophobic agenda. That trump‚Äôs supporters can actually believe there‚Äôs anything to debate at this point is mind-boggling.
The COVID-19 Crisis handed trump a golden opportunity to lock up re-election. All he had to do was reassure the nation and follow the lead of the medical community to save lives the way more intelligent leaders have in other nations.
There is no room for debate when it comes to an individual like trump. He is a monster whose incompetence and fragile ego has crippled our government in a time when competent leadership has never been more desperately needed.
God protects his children and American. If you don't like Trump and family. Then go play with sleepy Joe. He will let you rub his legs.
Great idea. President Trump is a Fearless Man.
Sounds more like Pompeo was stern with Russia about the rumors concerning bounties floated by  trump is more focused on China and his attention needs to stay there. I sincerely doubt Russia is actually putting bounties on us troops counterproductive to their interests

trump said he‚Äôs building a border wall in Colorado.
Thigh-land, Nipple, and Button. These words should be a question on Trump's next cognitive test as "What countries do the sound of these spoken words represent according to the dumbest U.S. president ever to hold the office?" Go on, take a guess. The first one is a freebie.
Kayne may have mental health issues, but he is not incompetent. You gonna give Trump a pass too because he has mental health issues???
Geraldo I will bet you any fucking thing you wish that tRump never stands on that debate stage.
So Kanye is a pathological liar like Trump. I sure hope this hurts his brand. He is running as a Trump surrogate.
I'm old enough to remember when conservatives piled on Obama for pronouncing "pahk-i-stahn".  But he was smart and knew the prevailing pronunciation.  Trump can't even pronounce multiple simple English words.  Not giving the benefit of the doubt to him for this one.
You know the Trump followers have totally lost their grip on reality when he says a word wrong, and they try to claim that it's supposed to be pronounced that way.  When have you ever heard Thailand pronounced "Thighland"? And I mean by someone who knows what they are saying.
Since I hear all the time from deluded leftists that Trump will be arrested "for his crimes" when he leaves office, if you spend a lot of time with deluded leftists (such as in The Lincoln Project echo-chamber), then it's no wonder you would "get the sense" of that.
Except no, b/c while I‚Äôm no fan of Biden he is far less dangerous than Trump. Biden having the power to start nuclear war isn‚Äôt nearly as scary. Biden isn‚Äôt likely to lock kids in cages or ban Muslims. It isn‚Äôt hard to make these distinctions
Jake, what's clear Trump wants his name on another check.  And the quickest way to do that is to force a congressional breakdown on "both sides" so that he can come in as a hero with his EO.

I don‚Äôt care if I have to wait 6 weeks to get rid of Trump
Three years of Trump has changed a lot of opinions
Kanye is, like Trump, suffering serious delusions of grandeur.  Both he and Trump have a theology that is profoundly anti Jesus.  And the lying, theiving, no debt paying, folks who praise then are the biblical definition of antiChrist followers.
I'm dragged out with Trump things ATM. I find when I step back, listen to music, it's easier on the brain. So here's one that's so nice &amp; calming, &amp; besides, I'm ready for Summer to leave &amp; usher in the Fall, my fav season. (lunch,bbl)
And it‚Äôs funny that if you show this quote to a Trump supporter, they‚Äôll just dismiss it, out of hand, as fake news.
Judge rules E. Jean Carroll can continue to seek Trump's DNA in defamation suit  I still can‚Äôt believe the American people elected a RAPIST ‚Å¶ for a president
Some of us try. If more Republicans did that there would be no Trump
I don‚Äôt expect much. I‚Äôd vote Libertarian if I felt it wasn‚Äôt important to throw Trump out. I‚Äôll probably vote GOP in 2024 unless it‚Äôs a huge Trump enabler and apologist. Trump in my opinion is an existential threat to every institution and value I believe in.
How is the entirety of Twitter not enraged about Congress' pathetic performance in producing a new stimulus package?   Instead, focus is on what Trump and Biden are babbling about, as usual. It's embarrassing.
Sure thing Trump humper. Have a great day.
Oh wow. This is really some next level boot licking. I mean...wow. Trump served fast food at the White House and Dinesh wants us to think he is f'ing James Bond.
I have a master's degree. I've traveled all over the world, including Thailand. In the US, we say Thailand...not Thighland.  Trump's an idiot. You know Trump is an idiot. Don't make yourself look like an idiot also.
Trump, Koch, DeVos, Mercer, Adelson.   3 parts Ayn Rand, 1 part Bible, dash of Bibi.
How many more videos do I have to see of the police brutalizing Americans to make me feel compassion for my fellow citizens?  Said Trump never.
I blame the GOP , Trump and his family. They need to speak to him, not just about mental illness.
Well. Saying someone is smarter than Trump may not mean much. A parrot is smarter. But Trump is also a grifter, a liar, an authoritarian, a cheat. His own ghost writer for AotD callled hom semi literate and doubted he had ever read a book even that one. Bad character bad brain.

No doubt about it!! The only question is: Which Trump do you want in 2024?
Ye Ole backstroke. Imagine if Trump had said the same thing.
It‚Äôs also altogether unsurprising that today‚Äôs GOP would exploit an extremely famous mentally ill person in the throes of an episode just to keep Trump in power.
Democrats just cheating as usual because they know Biden isn‚Äôt even fit for debate with President Trump! #BidensDementia  #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica  üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Yet another reason to vote out all incumbents from both parties. If you can't do your jobs, we need people who will #VoteThemOut
What his dad did has NOTHING to do w what Trump does, just like no black people are slaves in the U.S. today unless they allow themselves to be - their choice. Just like no one alive today owned slaves, unless yr a dem n continue to try to keep the black man down.
I know IQs are dropping, but who in their right mind wants another 4 years of Trump?
And ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù
Did trump name his bank account America?
That's right Bob!! It's fun. Especially now with the pandemic. I also think it's important to see all the like minded people that realize Trump is a threat. We aren't alone in this!!
They're not voting for Biden, they're voting against Trump.  And they don't care if it means putting America's leadership in the hands of a doddering fool.
Yes, there's an article, but the bottom line is: Trump &amp; the complicit GOP w their wimp handshakes. TRUMP is flying blind by choice. CHOICE!
OMG, yes, some labeled totalitarianism and dictators as fascist.  Some label Trump as a fascist dictator, do you agree?  If you actually read the article you are showing.. it's what I posted.. same wiki post.  Confirmation bias much?
Never Trump means Never America.
I‚Äôm listening to a reporter blaming Nancy Pelosi because the republicans aren‚Äôt negotiating in good faith. That includes the Trump Cult
Of course! But if Trump &amp; DeJoy can slow it or preferably stop it from functioning, they will. That way there can be no mail-in voting. DeJoy has already told them to cut back &amp; he's the boss. He's also a huge $$$ donor to Trump.
Kanye is deliberately hurting  to help Trump by running for POTUS. Boycott #kardashian  #BoycottKanye #boycottKimandKanye #boycottKardashians
As an American who will always consider Canada to be our friend and neighbor, please know that there are millions of us who do not support Trump at all and are counting the days till we can vote him out. Pray for us.üôè
So let me ask you, if the polls show Ye actually stealing votes from Trump, how is Roger Stone relevant at all to Kanye? How is depressing black voter turnout relevant to Kanye?   The sad thing is that the NYTimes does not label this crap as "opinion"
"The strategy of depressing turnout among Black voters was a favorite of Roger Stone, Mr. Trump‚Äôs longtime political adviser, in 2016; Mr. Trump commuted Mr. Stone‚Äôs prison sentence last month after his conviction on seven felony charges.."   In an article about Kanye.. ok
See people fighting, apply your metric (trump/biden). Could have been in agreement if you spoke about the topic from a different basis I bet

People blame trump because he is president. Not Obama, not Cuomo.  So those 150k deaths is his to blame
Whether Trump believes that Biden hates God is irrelevant, that is a typical right wing talking point voiced in an inarticulate way. He's not generalizing and alienating his own voters, one is trending right now, the other is just a media Trump nothing burger
I know one thing is for sure,  better #stop #playing with #God.  I don‚Äôt care how much #supporters think he is a god he is not. A true #Christian would ask themselves ‚ÄúWhat would #Jesus do‚Äù and #Trump here is a verse Don‚Äôt lie
I would believe that one of Donald Trump's favorite dishes is Pad Thigh
Let's hope this isn't the case, but it is trump's plan:
I just think best strategy is to do the opposite of what trump does (evasion)
the so-called ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù-theory is they foiled polls in 2016 because they couldn‚Äôt admit they were voting for Trump. Why narrative trying to paint Biden as racist can have effect even though they already know trump is.Helps them rationalize reverting to what they know
That's a BS scare tactic, no Democrat I know wants that. Believe me, I know a lot of Democrats because I am one. Trump's just scared of going to prison and rightly so.
Trump blamed Democratic Party. He said it was a hoax. Then he said it would ‚Äúdisappear after 15 people.‚Äù Then he resorted to after 150,000 Americans died, ‚ÄúIt is what it is.‚Äù
His arms are too short to box with God. Trump is so...rude.
Without a doubt, Trump did not adopt the ‚Äúsouth Asian way of saying Thailand‚Äù. Why are you trying this hard to look so dumb?
Since  is so eager to make  faith as a Christian an issue in this election, I hope any debate will ask both candidates for the last time they attended a church service and then follow up by asking the last time they played golf.
My views on Trump are spot on, thank you very much.
Even that wouldn‚Äôt work, because if not for the racism attracting them to trump, their voters would have gone for Bernie. The racism is all they‚Äôve got‚Äîanti-gay and anti-choice just doesn‚Äôt motivate enough people these days.
Why is  constantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs of authority?  This is the latest
Our Country is sick...Trump is the infection. The only way we can cure this sickness is to get Trump out so our nation can heal. The vote is the cure!!  #VoteBiden2020 #HealOurNation

What a narcissistic president would do ...
I've been unwavering Team  since the day  announced his VP pick would be a woman. Trump has wrecked our standing in the international arena. Her exp in DIPLOMACY -- not 'politics' -- is invaluable imo.   #SusanRice  #BidenVP
I think   doing a remarkable job so far with the campaign‚Äî the ad that started W/woman saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt blame Trump for the virus‚Äù as close to perfect as any I‚Äôve ever seen; If he could maybe learn to use a bit of that subtlety when attacked...
Keep in mind the NRA laundered Russian money and funneled it to trump. This will all come out at trial.
of course, a significant amount of blame should attach to #Trump &amp; his Federal government, which should both have implemented a national #COVID19 strategy that would have minimized the pandemic, &amp; a national education strategy that would have made things clear
Whoa ... taking a page from the trump playbook. Classy.
Only President Trump has the very courageous heart to do something like that. You have to love a guy who is unafraid of literally of anyone on this earth.
Not surprised about  leaving and shirking responsibility for a relief bill during his pandemic. Surprised that #FoxNews is talking about it. Donald Trump does not care about what is happening to the American people, period. #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
I‚Äôm sure Trump wishes you well, just like he did for noted child-sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell
But no cap if he didn‚Äôt specify exactly what transactions from tencent gets banned. Then how can I be sure that League of legends and Epic games is safe to stay. Trump already doesn‚Äôt like video games.

NO shit! Well, this explains why I didn't receive my auto insurance bill until yesterday, one day after my payment was due.ü§¨  Trump and his buddy, the new postmaster general, should be arrested for tampering with the U.S. Mail.   THIS IS TOTAL BULLSHIT!

Soulwar, you do wonderful threads!! I know that they will do anything to take Pres Trump out. When ppl realized that Hinckley didn‚Äôt actually shoot Pres Reagan, you know that their subterfuge knows no bounds. I pray everyday that Pres Trump can be kept safe.

Fascinating to watch Fox news trash Biden being racist‚Äî then blame him for not standing up against anti-Catholism because Trump accused him of hating God. even got bishop of New York to implicitly back them up, illustrated w/ shots of BLM graffiti on Saint Patrick‚Äôs cathedral.
No, stop using this account for propaganda purposes. Congress did the work, not President Trump.
Yeah I get it. Still painful to watch him smeared across three networks this morning for those comments. Including   My worry is some white people in particular who are on the fence might think oh well if he‚Äôs racist to then I don‚Äôt have to feel bad voting for Trump
AG Barr told congress that Adam Demarco was a Democrat insinuating that his testimony could not be relied on when Barr testified before Congress. I was appalled that Barr resorted to partisan politics but Trump &amp; Fox watchers only see partisan politics.

Do you even give a shit that Kanye is running to help Trump win?
even if you don't want to go in to vote in person, register for a mail in ballot asap! I did it, it came right to my house and it was safe. Everyone needs to vote, Trump is going to try and pull some corny shit again, we as a community need to put a stop to this man.
Blindness more like it. Trump is evil. To paraphrase something you once said before you sold out to the GOP: Trump doesn‚Äôt care about black people.
It's a 'try', but you already know DeJoy &amp; Trump are sharing a vat of Kentucky Fried Chicken/gallons of Coke, and laughing and laughing and laughing. They have the plan ready &amp; moving on the USPS.  #VoteBlue no matter how, no matter who. 2020.
He has admitted he‚Äôs running to help Trump. He is a total GOP bootlicker. He and especially anyone planning to vote for him should be ashamed.
I love Trump!
A bone chilling thought but we have seen a clear willingness to ignore norms, traditions and the law if it suits Trump‚Äôs purposes for the last four years.
come on man! The people who watch Fox News &amp; OAN believe everything Trump says. You can‚Äôt discount this issue &amp; act like trump is crazy. He has a cult following. They‚Äôll commit suicide for him. You need a cult consultant to talk about him &amp; be effective

Your handlers writing these tweets didn't explain what you meant, and instead went into the old trope of "my career speaks for itself blah blah."  It's sad people hate trump so much you get away with what is essentially a racist statement.
He then pitted the states against each other in PPE bidding wars, and then came in &amp; seized the materials and equipment they were scrambling to acquire. Kushner thought it would gut "blue states" &amp; benefit his re-election. At that point, Trump let the whole thing go, on purpose.
Coming from the man who has broke almost all commandments... put himself before god, adulterer, steals, lies, cheats... ya but let‚Äôs talk about Biden being ungodly... trump would probably turn to fire if he ever step foot in a church...
The reason we have witnessed this chaotic patchwork from states, is because Trump refused to regenerate the works of Bush and Obama before him, and told all the states, on the fly, that it was up to them. States had no time, no budgets, &amp; were forced to wing it on the spot.
I work with 30 countries on a daily basis. They think Trump is a joke, and a complete idiot, and they putty is. The United States is a laughing stock... and considered the newest ‚Äúshithole‚Äù country.  It only took him 3 years to bring is to this.

The states were NEVER set up for this. They were not supposed to be, other than how to sequence down/up infrastructure &amp; economy. Pandemic responses are always a collective national matter. Trump shitcanned all of our national &amp; global response plans/mechanisms.
Never Trump does mean always stupid. Go away meghan. Geez.
Almost every bit of this is on Trump. I won't go into it here because it would take hours to go through the timeline on Twitter. I worked in pandemic planning as a part of an occupation yrs ago. I can tell you that there are some who will be prosecuted for neglect homicide.
Have you heard Trump talk? I mean, even today, he referred to "Thighland" - never mind his outright lies, such as kids are immune from COVID. Trump brags about passing a basic cognitive exam. People act as if Trump isn't a God-damn moron and Biden somehow is.....
Trump is a cry baby bitch boy
"Trump also said any deal would have to include a "substantial amount of money" coming to the US Treasury. Does he think that means to him personally? He thinks he's making a business deal for himself. Guaranteed.
Anyone making excuses for #Biden‚Äôs overt racism &amp; explaining it away rather than holding him accountable is doin a disservice. It blurs any contrast w/ #Trump. If #Bernie said this bullshit bias ass  would crucify him but of course he‚Äôd never say some dumb shit like this

There are definitely enough people who would throw their vote away because everything is a joke to them. It's not about whether Biden is a good candidate at this point, it's about getting trump or not.

Even Fox bailed on Trump's press conference, giving up the ghost when he started reeling off a laundry list of the demographics of unemployment numbers that are the lowest ever. They lasted through him saying, "High school diploma! NO high school diploma!" before Tucker broke in.

Without a 3rd candidate, hacking the election becomes difficult. Look at Stein in 16, she had higher vote counts in states where Clinton was expected to win and Trump won by the skin of his teeth. The data is there...they're running same playbook from 2016.
Notice how the Trumpies can't be bothered to think about anything. They trigger on demand and then when forced to think about their reaction they can't even reflect that maybe it isn't all one big conspiracy. Vote Trump. It's easier than thinking!

Not at all. I do not believe Kanye‚Äôs mental illness has anything to do with his love affair with trump. They are friends and he‚Äôs trying to help trump win the election. Mental illness is no excuse for what he‚Äôs doing. He has the resources to get help.
Oh, I'm not. But I've also had the Democrats telling me for 40 years that we have to vote against Republicans, and the time for change is not now. I think Hillary would have been infinitely preferable to trump, and I think Bernie would have been better still.
Trump will walk it when the chips are down.
We do not, but we also know that Biden isn't going to change anything, and honestly could open the door for Republican resurgence. Some of us are looking past the next four years. But we also know that the US can't survive another four years of trump. So, handwringing.
I am very sorry to say that everyone who comes in contact with Trump has more problems than it is worth.

Trump is a mope. He went to Fisherman's Wharf, he‚Äôs a bitch, he‚Äôs traveled around the bathroom. His critics are polite, educated, and many have helped their home states. No wonder he seems like such an alien to them. They view him with incomprehension.  There, fixed it
I agree Trump has done a good job at filtering his language in the last five years but has said and done enough in the last four to show he is racist.   And yes, Biden is also racist.   Two sides of the same coin.

Biden wants this election to be a referendum on Trump,that's his winning  much as I think Susan Rice is brilliant and would be a better VP than Kamala Harris, we don't need the rehashing of the Obama years litigated.Harris is safer pick
No need to debate. Trump has shown us for the last three and a half years that we don't want him in The White House any longer.

People do anything to get out of meeting or talking to Trump. The Ohio governor got a positive coronavirus test, then later he got a negative test.
This is a important data point. In order for hackers to shed votes, they need a third candidate to send the votes to. They can't give them to Trump, that would  be to obvious and raise red flags, which is why Stein had higher vote counts in several key states in 2016.

A lot has changed since that was published &amp; I like to see something from an objective source. What's your take on Trump's covid-19 response considering how it affects minorities so much more? Truly, someone that cares about minorities, wouldn't just say it's going to disappear.
Lowe‚Äôs on watch list too just in case they decide they want to be on that tyranny trump train

Hey genius, since Covid affects minorities / blacks at a far higher percentage than whites, why don't you tell me about how much Trump has really spearheaded an effort to help them. Trump's great plan of it'll just go away, how's that working out for minorities?
He's 100% Correct .
Because he decided that being ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù (and ain‚Äôt that ironic?) would get them on his side. The only thing he‚Äôs ‚Äúpro-‚Äú is Trump.
Dude just vote Trump. It's easier than thinking. And you clearly did not look into this subject at all. You just want to be angry oh, and you just want to complain, rather than try to actually think about causes and solutions.
Like being a Trump supporter and being linked to white supremacy was bad enough
I read all the comments, they were all great, I wonder if Trump has someone read the stuff people are saying about him. Anyone who says they are a stable genius definitely has mental problems.  It shows up in everything he says
when you guys can show me all the good stuff Trump has done for blacks and minorities or really anyone but himself and his family business, then start talking to me about why they should vote for Trump. And spare me the propaganda from your pro Trump websites.
Oh well even more reason to vote blue because of people like you. We have to get Trump out. Vote üó≥.

All these pictures are always so old. And no one ever acknowledges that when one of his Mar-a-Lago employees complained, Trump banned Epstein from the property, forever.

All at Trump Towers
Trump voters are WORSE than Trump himself in my honest opinion.
Your team is stonewalling asking $$$ for things that have nothing to do with the pandemic (e.g. F35s). This is a political move to make Trump look like a savior when he signs a bunch executive orders bypassing congress, hoping this effort will improve his poll numbers.

Oh, I'm not. But I've also had the Democrats telling me for 40 years that we have to vote against Republicans, and the time for change is not now. I think Hillary would have been infinitely preferable to trump, and I think Bernie would have been better still.
Trump will walk it when the chips are down.
We do not, but we also know that Biden isn't going to change anything, and honestly could open the door for Republican resurgence. Some of us are looking past the next four years. But we also know that the US can't survive another four years of trump. So, handwringing.
I‚Äôd be surprised if Trump‚Äôs lexicon exceeds 300 words.
Which certainly isn‚Äôt halfwit Donald Trump. Try harder.
I don‚Äôt know why but I feel that Biden was put in place to insure trumps victory.. otherwise why have him there at all. There were a few far better Candidates to choose from that could go toe to toe with trump.

Trump is a mope. He went to Fisherman's Wharf, he‚Äôs a bitch, he‚Äôs traveled around the bathroom. His critics are polite, educated, and many have helped their home states. No wonder he seems like such an alien to them. They view him with incomprehension.  There, fixed it

we all knew trump was going to rig everything and the ever complicit GOP will enable all of it..
Trump just says whatever pops in his head.. which means it's all a lie.
Boris, did putin or trump tell you to post this lie?  Did you not know ACA covers pre-existing conditions?  And Trump is trying his best to END Pre-existing conditions? Actively fighting this in court NOW, but trying to hide it til after the elections..!!  Yes, we know.. !
Trumpy Dirtybag Jerry Falwell Jr., a prominent evangelical supporter of Trump, on indefinite leave of absence from Liberty U.  for being the perv that we all knew he is.  One of trumps fine people.
The end of covi-19 is not timed. Neither vaccine or medication will bring it end.The election is not an occasion to fight or celebrate.Trump winning will take the nation to nowhere except worse,Biden winning will need four+ years to clean up and turn the arrow up if he could.
Trump pledges executive orders to extend Covid relief, but offers few details
Trump did a fake lying press conf at his golf club.. they cheered.
The irony that the nra is a scam that it's members defend donating to is so ... 2020.   trump saying the nra should relocate is so ... Trump being trumped   god has a wicked sense of justice.   üçø
Trump essentially admitted he pronounced it wrong when he corrected himself.   I get that this is all part of your grift, but you can just run away now like you usually do.
But even if I'm wrong and you find some dialect of Galician or whatever that says "Thighland", so what? Are you honestly trying to claim that Trump was doing that? It's not the correct English or Thai pronunciation and he did it in front of an American audience.
#WTAF ?? Trump and the GOP are going to start a fucking revolution... this is insane. The president should not have this much power to destroy the election.  How is rest of the government helpless to do anything about this?
Why is everyone associated with Trump a thief, embezzler, rapist, lobbyist for a foreign government, a sociopath, bat shit crazy or simple dumb as a door nail?
How dumb do you have to be to take The Hill's headlines at face value? They're a right-wing outlet.  Schumer is saying that opening schools is important and that's why it sucks that Trump doesn't have a realistic plan for how to do so safely.
Take off electricity and how do you get your bitcoins?  The government can confiscate all bitcoins by executive order Trump may decide to apply the same rules to tiktok  How many bitcoins and Eth does Trump own?
They sense that parents will support TGPE TRUMP because of his stance on school being open. It‚Äôs all about the votes
So, people should demand Trump fires   The treasury secretary is the last person that should be at the helm right now.  is so stupid Mnuchin must robbing him blind.  should investigate him
Trump TV.  Better for Trump if the Senate pretends they can‚Äôt get the Dems to be reasonable so he can come up with the last minute save. They have probably been planning it for weeks, thus waiting for the deadline to pass and making it all the more dramatic. Won‚Äôt work.
What people should ask  How many millions did you make in 2008-2009 by ripping off people that lost their homes in foreclosures?. Cost to the government was $3,9 billion. Mnuchin made $10.9 million
It‚Äôs not gonna get any better under Trump
Them doing stupid things helps Trump.  I want them to stop doing stupid things.
I am completely shook. How is  going to state that he‚Äôs signing an Executive Order for insurance companies to be forced to cover pre-existing conditions when it‚Äôs been law for over 10 years?! Thank you,  Trump only wished he did it. #AffordableCareAct
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that it's a bad idea to put someone in charge of your campaign's Latino outreach who can't stop bragging about her connections to Contra death squads.
the   Affordable  Super  Super  Health  Act by  Trump
One thing is for sure. They truly hate you   Expletives and disgust against Trump and his lies is what I heard of most people. Total fear of what the future will bring. Real despair. Weird tales but somehow they all believe Trump is a puppet of Putin.
his father died at 93.  He was 15 or so years older than Trump is now, and - I think - was in decent health in his 70's...
The four years of Trump? Accurate.
Trump would try selling the pearly gates back to God if he could.

You wish. Not with "Four more Years" for TRUMP. #WhiteLivesMatter
To stave off a continual grinding away on the economy.   We are absolutely paying the price for Trump's screw ups.  I've noticed a change of tone in my 78 year old Mother's talk about Trump...
This payroll cut makes no sense at all, and Trump's just leaving the negotiations in a huff could lead us into another Great Depression.    Herbert Hoover Redux.  Always a day late and several dollars short.    I am concerned about the debt level too, but we need this NOW...
Using ridiculous child minded MAGA moron Trump's theory, would using less pregnancy testing kits, reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies? Just asking.
She's still has a job, and is indeed thriving, because she will say anything to denigrate Trump. That's  what her mouth-foaming viewers demand. Not long ago she was touted as a replacement for Todd because he is a bit too temperate. Who knew?
You‚Äôre Trump‚Äôs kinda guy. You have a job waiting for you
I'm going with Trump. Pronounced, "Dee-rain-shd-cwi-bay-bee".
I think this means whites like me who personally hate Trump AND want what‚Äôs best for everyone get a double benefit. üôÇ
Senator, you can tell us from the floor of the Senate if it's so important.  And I'm sure it actually is, but you won't do what's required.  Delay at this point is serving no one but Trump and Putin.
TRUMP TRAIN! #MAGA2020
üëç there it is, name calling; anyhow how am I racist? There are 0 right sided republicans/libertarians wrecking cities ZERO so yes I‚Äôm going to blame democrats who are encouraging this lawlessness, and Pres Trump is the one calling 4 law/order
Me: catching up on the #thighland shitstorm and the Trump apologists' takes
I can‚Äôt shift a feeling that she‚Äôs alive and been helping trump out aswell as MJ ... fingers are crossed ü§û
I've seen more photos of Trump with heavenly angels than I've seen examples of his empathy, selflessness and humanity.
My first thought (probably unfairly): was de Gaulle "Trump: the prequel"?!
Dinesh has really been impressive the past 24 hours!   He gave us two completely opposite explanations of why ‚ÄúThighland‚Äù is correct, and now now Trump is a global elitist and we‚Äôre the downtrodden working class.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen such exquisite brown-nosing.
No, but it means if you're dedicated to getting trump out you NEED to vote for Biden.
Patriots! Vote in person for Trump. The most consequential vote for prosperous America and peaceful world. This vote is for us, our children and grandchildren.
As a 53-y-o Brit of impeccable diction and a lot of travel miles, I can tell you that the *only* English-speaking people I've heard pronounce the word the way Trump did are young children reading it for the first time.  *Everyone* else gets it.
Iv always believed if Trump &amp; Putin join forces they'd be the strongest force worldwide if they came together with truth &amp; integrity &amp; a wish 4 peace &amp; genuine friendship &amp; mutual respect its bye bye leftists worldwide &amp; Satan's plan will be in tatters
A vote for Biden would be a vote for criminals and enemies. Treasonous gangs who committed #ObamaGate and pedophiles want Biden's win. China, Iran and globalists like Soros hope Biden's win.   Vote for Trump to #KAG.
I think I'd be fine with someone shaking her hand, calling her "Ms. Windsor," and then spending their time having a talk with the PM.  Though I'll add that Trump was an asshole in ways I wouldn't want someone to be with anyone her age. Like you're a guest. Act like it.
Though I'll freely admit that of Trump's many faults "didn't follow protocol around the British monarch" is probably at the bottom of my list.  I've always found seeing the elected leader of a republic pretending to care about the monarchy unseemly at best.
People can. Trump never will.
If this were true, it would still be hilarious because Trump still didn‚Äôt know one way or the other. What‚Äôs the excuse for yo semites?  ü§î
Has Trump ever had regrets?
I hope so...Idon;t want to tempt fate but I have yet to hear from any US tweeter who doesn't lik ehim..shows how corrupt the media is....Go Trump!
You have a weird &amp; twisted mind, Jessica. Being cut out of a will, if true, can just as well mean that she was cut out for exposing Trump's true character, esp as Trump is known for being a petty and vindictive bully. It's important to have an airtight spin or you look silly.

TRUMP BANNED FORTNITE
Ohio Republicans turn on Trump: ‚ÄòWe will not make the same mistake this November‚Äô
Right wingers have for years given Trump a free pass over his sexism, racism, ignorance, corruption grift and tax dodging and then wonder why he carries on that way to this day.  Get your tongue out of his arse.
Trump is the only President since Reagan who has even tried to stand up for the US and the American people. Most others in Gov't have worked for a globalistic, elitist system.
I almost want to ask how that works.  So people have tried to kill Trump and not even OANN or Fox covered it? What?
I don‚Äôt like trump or miller as much as the next guy but abortion jokes are just bad taste.
Very dangerous times especially with some of the idiots that are supposedly in charge trump and Boris, then you have Russia and China flexing their muscles could so easily tip the balance..üòØ
Trump wants to be at war with everyone. Apart from Russia.
Is there a correct way to follow Trump? .... And.... You can go to the Betty Ford Clinic for that, you know (only joking, btw).
Mine was from day one ... The globalists are losing their grip because of Brexit and Trump power to the people .... plus they are all old white men who have turned into Mr Burns from the Simpson‚Äôs ...
#DonaldTrump claims #JoeBiden Biden is 'against God' üòÇü§£ This joker is going to get more and more desperately unhinged the nearer we get to November. Amazed he's still there tbh #IdiotInChief
Trump mispronouncing Thailand? We should send him to Covfefe.
We might as well face it.  Trump &amp; Co. will stumble us into another Great Depression.  If they haven't already...
They can come up with monitors or something, but yes, Trump will cheat.
It'll be virtual.  Trump is in way over his head if he thinks that he's up for a solid debate...
No. As much as I admire Biden and hate Trump, freedom &amp; equality shouldn't be bought with obscene sums of money that would be better spent on doing real good to people's lives. There must be a cap to funding so equality and representation is within reach of all, poor included.
Trump mocked after calling Thailand ‚ÄòThighland‚Äô in latest speech blunder  - it‚Äôs a given that your hip-bone is connected to your Thai-bone.
In all honesty, who among you thought Trump would last this long?
I wonder what spin you would have put on it had Trump said the exact same thing? Something completely different I‚Äôm betting.
Well, Trump and his posse are under investigation for their interest in the land of underage thighs.
If Republicans vote in person, but Democrats vote in mail ballots.... then that offers plenty of scope for election fraud. This is going to be the dirtiest election in US history.
UK Gov (Cameron) were in with the US Dems - to try to help Clinton win over Trump luckily that failed - USA &amp; the world got Trump. Its reported that UK gave a substantial donation to the Clinton campaign! I'm wary of Boris since I saw the picture last year of him with Rothschild
I'm quite looking forward to leaving tbh  because I have a feeling the fantastic (Johnson's favourite word) deal will be more to my liking than yours especially given the UK is joining CPTPP. Out of one bloc and into another (which even Trump rejected).
I do know how to say it. Have for decades. üôÇ  I‚Äôm just dying because Dinisherouza is killing himself trying to justify why Trump doesn‚Äôt üòÇ
Good.
Trump Worship is the ultimate display of merit!
Beside Trump, Dutertre, Bolsenaro, it‚Äôs probably universally accepted that anyone else is a much better leader than Johnson.
Can only begin to imagine what the great  is shouting into Trump's ear #Thighland
What is wrong with Trump? He talks like a fking 5 year old now.  What about 1000 deaths a day? TRUMP. No, we are at the bottom which means we are first. NO. TRUMP. It is what it is. I am doing a great job.  But what about the deaths? TRUMP. We are lower against the world.
How to convince Gen Z to register to vote and elect your opponent in one single move. Trump just fired torpedoes at his own election.
‚ÄúThe lesson here is that, even as Trump and Republicans ask the Supreme Court to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act, their own constituents in red states are telling them that they support a critical element of what that legislation accomplished.‚Äù üëáüèº
sorry to piss on your party hitler supporters i mean trump
How's the criminal organisation going down at the car theft ring now you've received all that money and a pardon from Trump to buy your vote?
For what? He knows it won't pass the Senate and Trump won't sign it. It's posturing.
Been assuming this was a year and a half at home ever since Trump was still fucking around in March as the virus spread to every state.  It's easier when you never had the "maybe it'll be over in a month or two" hope.
This is a metaphor about Trump, isn't it?
Trump is right. Large Pharma companies exploit customers when cheaper prescriptions are available. The market is rigged. Nurofen charge high prices yet a cheap paracetamol does exactly the same! Trust Trump, he is the POTUS to MAGA.
Stupidest thing I read today.  That is saying a lot I just watched a trump video
I‚Äôd put money on a Trump being arrested the minute he leaves office . You realise how many women are lining up to accuse him of sexual assault? #Epstein
And that's just to the Trump campaign. It doesn't include any other attempts to topple governments or organisations through these methods. To my mind this kind of interference in what should be an equal election is treasonous.
In 2016, the NRA spent more than $30 million on behalf of the Trump campaign,¬†according to Federal Election Commission data.¬†It was a staggering number compared to 2012, when the group spent about $13 million to try to unseat President Barack Obama
Why the screaming in all caps?  And why are you employed by Trump after all your horrible indiscretions?
Could you even imagine if Trump said anything remotely close to this oh my god.
Because he didn't. Trump only ever brags about things he didn't really do.
NYAG is going to fry donny trump.  They got his records, others will get his taxes and records and they will find 50 years of criminal behavior. .
If Biden can hurt Trump's God, does that make Trump's God the devil?
Too many people here get there knickers in a twist over Donald trump yet you are absolutely powerless when the American wasp rednecks get his vote. We've got Boris bumblecunt running about doing whatever he wants
you cannot play nice with Trump he &amp; Barr are gonna probably indict your son with zero evidence be ready they are up to no good we know it they are the most corrupt we have EVER seen &amp; will stop at nothing to win they are the #DeepSwamp üò°
That's not a poll, dummies, it's a loaded and leading question. In addition, Trump has never provided proof of the test he took, that he took it, and that he aced it. So, what's TRUMP hiding?
The rifle association is only one piece of a very large corrupt puzzle that helps keep Trump and others like him in the powerful positions that they hold.
Blimey, Trump‚Äôs face is the same colour as the beige back-drop! Is he trying camouflage?
Did Epstein and Maxwell take Trump to Thighland
You couldn't even use pentothal on Trump because sociopaths and fantasists whole heartedly believe their lies.
Trump will decide that the best arbiter would be Barr and claim he's non-partisan. He would ensure that any money "he" lost would come out of the treasury or other people's pockets, not his. Biden would lose. Terrible idea!

Awww. I hope not. I really do. If only it targeted people like Trump. Vaccine by Spring with luck.
When Trump was asked which he liked better the old testament or the New testament he said "I think equal " that is fucking hilarious #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Here's Trump:
If Trump losing can hurt God that completely negates the entire idea that God is infallible, and if the film Dogma taught me anything, that's an INCREDIBLY bad thing. =P
A country the size of the üá∫üá∏ and Trump and Biden are the best there is? Seriously?
presidential debates aren't debates.  They need to get some high school kids to show them how debates work.  trump was a great A+ student (according to him) and he should know how to debate.. Biden has answers, trump has nothing.
So very sorry to hear of your loss. I pray for all the victims of this pandemic every day. I do believe Trump is responsible for many unnecessary deaths because of his uncaring, unscientific and selfish response to this national emergency.
Says the guy who said to "take the guns first". You openly wanted to violate the second amendment, but somebody attacks the NRA (a private organization), and you get your pubes in a twist?
I don't know why  is crying. He's the guy that said to take the guns first, then litigate second... LITERALLY violating the second amendment. He's a total hypocrite.
Storm Troopers. This is the next step in Trump's grab for a military dictatorship. I really hope that when it happens, the idiots who have supported him are the first against the wall.
The 2016 election. I don‚Äôt mean to say I wasn‚Äôt politically aware prior to that, but Trump‚Äôs election really lit a fire under my ass. I‚Äôd never protested prior to that: I‚Äôve never felt so angry and disgusted than I am with Republicans today.
Poll:  Do you believe trump when he says everyone should send their kids back to school, or do you think Covid is still to dangerous to go back to school?
If you haven't learned anything in the past 3 years dont tweet anything trump says. It's a lie
Poll: the Deer Leeder, Donny "the big liar" trump thinks a vaccine will out in time to get him re-elected.    Do you think a vaccine will change anyone's mind about voting for him who already decided not to? ?
The IRA? Pro Trump? What‚Äôs the source for this?
Trump never said sex with Stormy was bad.
Of course, trump is appalled that NYAG is investigating.  Donny has never met a horrible person he doesn't like.  Ever notice he supports only the worst people?  White Supremes are fine people, but BLM are facist anarchists.  Why is that?  He goes out of his way to do this.
You going to resign from the BBC when Trump fits re elected? Your not impartial and the BBC is not free
POTUS Trump is on live tv every day discussing to the nation what is happening-Boris ignores and deceives the electorate who got him in office.Priti has lied all along. They must come clean to the UK. Its their duty.
Trump only deeply cares about one person. üòÇ
Dear Republicans:  Your boy, donny trump is lying to you.  Just an FYI, Covid isn't going to magically disappear.  He wants you to send your kids to school.  He doesn't want to help you, and if you get evicted, it's your fault for being a lazy slob.  He thinks you deserve it.
LYING SOB Alex "Jeff's Friend" Azar is telling America HCQ is just a-ok and dandy to take.  The entire Trump regime wants to kill you.  WHY?  Because trump has a huge investment in HCQ so he wants you to take it.  He's making millions but you might die.  Seems like a bad deal.
Dear Republicans:  Did you know that the trump regime has lawyers arguing to eliminate "pre-existing conditions". NOW. Remember in 2018 they all said they support keeping it? Well, while they all campaigned to keep it, they were trying to get rid of it in court. Vote GOP and die.
Not a fan of Mr Trump I take it??
Dear Republicans:  As you struggle to survive in this Covid pandemic that your deer leeder said will "just go away, i hope". He wants your kids to go to school with no plan to keep them safe.  He's currently working to eliminate obamacare with no replacement. Vote trump and die.
We laughing at you Trump. We don‚Äôt care about what you think, say, tweet,etc. November 3rd is coming!!!! #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpMustGo
But Trump also has probably never ridden the Subway. He's had a limo with a driver his whole life.
Where does this photo of Trump come from?
With all the money laundering Trump is involved in, I'm surprised there's any money left to pay anyone. Kodak, his family (billions in so called "earnings")... He certainly looks after his own.
Facebook and Twitter took it down. Trump himself will be taken down soon, too.
All those people that think Trump can win are not looking at the reality by November 3: 30 million will be going hungry 300,000 deaths from COVID  100 MILLION not in the work force 20 million unemployed FEDERAL Debt will be $28 TRILLION DEFICIT WILL BE $4,5 TRILLION WTF TRUMP?
I had a kidney transplant, so I'm immunosuppressed. That means there's no way my special needs kids get the in-person school support and therapy they need until President Biden has months to get a handle on the pandemic.  But these fucking monsters are helping Trump.
They've meddled in the UK, too. I think everyone is petrified that a war with Russia would kill us all. Putin is just as crazy as Trump, but he's a cold blooded assassin, too, former head of KGB and leader of the Russian mafia. Putin knows he is untouchable.
Mail in voting is the dumbest thing i‚Äôve ever heard. Y‚Äôall really out there for trump LMAOOOO. If you can open all these stores and half of schools then mfs you can go to a booth and vote üó≥  #TedTalk ‚úåüèº
My previous a/c was suspended because I said that Trump's people have been given enough rope to hang themselves. Their bot decided that I was trying to get people to kill themselves (I presume it was reported). Fully expect my new account to be taken down now I've said this, duh.
The Democrats Plan A November Coup, Not An Election What Democrats are now doing is preparing the information warfare battlefield for the Election Day and post-Election Day chaos they plan to create to drive Donald Trump from office
Trump always wanted to be on the cover of Time. üòÇ
Just like Trump. He'll go away, too. For a very, very, long time.
So Trump can understand them.
Remember how the GOP excoriated President Obama giving a socially correct bow to Saudi Arabians?   Not a peep when Trump reflexively saluted someone with medals on their chest. He is such a sucker for those types of things.
Can Trump be sued for what The Administration does?
Nouveau riche.  Ghetto fabulous would be taking nothing and turning into something fabulous .  Trump does the opposite
Biden is desperate.....he has no intention of MAGA-he is concerned for himself. The US is heading in a great direction under POTUS Trump yet the left would rather cut their own nose off to spite their face.
It is a tragedy that people do not seem to realize that Trump is not running the USA as a  Republican or as a believer in democracy. The USA is being run as a mafia organization with enforcers. Trump is el padrino de la Cosa Nostra USA mafiaMoose trump EVERYTHING
Every Trump surrogate is out talking up the huge news of covering preexisting conditions.  This is a sick joke on the American people after the GOP and Trump have tried to kill this for 3.5 years. Anyone in the media that takes this seriously needs to go back to school
Thats a joke the ACA makes sure pre existing conditions like mine are covered. All Trump has done is try to kill it. Just like the has done with the rest of the ACA with NO REPLACEMENT.
That's what happens when. We let Trump get away with cheating and not holding him accountable in 2016. Just like Rubio said next time it could be China helping the Democrats. Do don't cry now just pray they don't have too big of an impact on the Senate because Trump is done.
Thats what happens when. You let Russia get away with helping Trump In 2016. Now countries think it's open game with our elections.
Are you pro Trump people actually real people or simply unintelligent gullible morons? Love Mr. confused from the UK.
Other than you're in the tank for trump üòÇüòÇ
There has been less then 400,000 manufacturing jobs add to the economy since Trump took office.  I wish they stop lying to the people. That's why they are losing to the mid West. The jobs are gone and they are killing farmers with their tariffs.
No doubt because the Founding Fathers had no idea the American people would be so stupid as to elect someone like Trump to the presidency
Wait 'til you hear that #trump likes to grab women by the p**** . Is he your type of role model?
Have you actually watched the Axios interview? If you did then what‚Äôs your excuse or reason for supporting Trump? I‚Äôm genuinely interested. Thanks
Hi Terrence I was thinking of something. Would you seriously consider doing us Trump supporters a favor in 2024 would you please do us the honor and run for President because you‚Äôre the next best thing other than Trump? Just a thought. Team Trump and team Terrence.
If they count as 'things', Nigel Farage or Donald Trump.

You been investigating the Clintons for over ten years and stillhaven't found nothing. Spend some of your time on the current corruption being done by Trump and the rest of his team. Then you will get some indictments you are looking for.
Good thing America isn't depending on Republicans to make the right vote.  America has just decided to move left without you guys. So justify voting for Trump anyway you want but it's not the VP pick that is swinging your vote. It's your support for Trump or America.
Donald Trump knows many countries:  - Thighland - Shinapore  - Saint Kitts and Kneevis - Lesotoe - Handuras
Continue to ignore the Democrat governors in places like MN and MI who put infected people in nursing homes and killed thousands.  Blame Trump is your entire platform and America is tired of you.
Er no that‚Äôs rubbish, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Greece, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Malaysia, Taiwan, Korea, China, Vietnam, Austria, have all flattened the curve and they aren‚Äôt seeing significant second waves  The 3 total failures are Johnson, Trump and Bolsonaro
They aren‚Äôt ballots but some of us know who we are voting for. Hint: it‚Äôs not Trump
Lost a brain cell listening to Trump
It reminds me of the birther conspiracy against Obama that Trump played a big part in. That was rank stupidity coupled with a nasty racist thread.
Can the Trump, and co just go to jail forever now!  Sheesh!
Now that President Trump has tweeted support for mail in ballots, the Democrats launch an investigation.  Perfect...
I doubt there is anywhere in the multiverse with a Trump that smart.
We‚Äôre not taking of about Bill Clinton. If you watched that interview with Trump and still think he‚Äôs the man to lead the USA then you have problems.
Trump has turned me off of everyone in the Republican Party right now... no one is making any sense to me. He is a buffoon. #LincolnVoter
Yeah, I realized that after I punched enter. And I didn‚Äôt get these numbers from Trump. I saw a comparison chart, not written by Trump. Twitter doesn‚Äôt allow editing, at least none that I know of.
Instead of saying ‚ÄúYo-sem-it-ee,‚Äù Trump said ‚ÄúYO-se-MIGHT‚Äù then quickly followed with another incorrect pronunciation of ‚ÄúYO-sem-mi-NIGHT.‚Äù
Trump template. Bannon?
You proudly support Trump? Did you watch the Axios interview?  Did you see him wish Ghislaine Maxwell well again? I would say you‚Äôre weak if you still support this man.

When was he in court? Dismissed means it never happened once it was proven that the hillary operative making the claim wasn‚Äôt in the same state as Trump when she said he did something to her.
We both know if Trump‚Äôs name was on the flight logs to Epstein‚Äôs island even once (it‚Äôs not) like all those democrats and entertainers, especially slick willey, that would be all the fake news media talked about 24/7
When was President Trump ever in court? Go ahead and post the case and date. I‚Äôll wait.
To the writer of this(let's be honest: Joe's not doing this himself): Mr. Trump created the best economy since the Reagan Admin. There's nothing Joe(or you for that matter) can remotely come close to that level of success. Running ads like this only serve to embarrass yourselves.
No surprise there. It‚Äôs well known Trump despises President Obama and why
I‚Äôm looking forward to Biden making Trump look like a fool
Now I'm wondering if Trump's my-generals-told-me-it-was-an-attack line from yesterday was fed to him by Putin. I hate having to feel like this.
I agree, Trump only see money. He needs to be charged with life without the possibility of parole for each person that has died under his watch because of his ignorance to react when warned of the virus in time. The more people die, the happier Trump is. He has a heart of stone.
Trump wouldn‚Äôt know Sharia law if it fell on him. Did Portland teach you nothing?

Amidst all the things we saw in the Axios interview, let's not forget that Trump showed more sympathy for Ghislane Maxwell than for John Lewis.

You know that include the leader of your party, Donald Trump, is not part of that "we." Don't you?
All he had to say was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure the courts will deal with that matter accordingly‚Äù. Why is he ‚ÄúWishing her well‚Äù?. What‚Äôs the Trump supporters theory on this?
Don't they, thats interesting  Your claim is at odds with the US govt line, the price of a US trade deal is political alignment with them on policy with respect to China, a number of Trump appointees have made this clear from the outset
Many of them are his match in stupidity, it's true, but I'm Mr Rational and the polls are clear. His support is falling away sharply and the GOP know it. They are even spending money advertising in Georgia now, which means they fear they may lose what ought to be a Trump shoo-in.
"within two weeks"
If Trump get's re-elected we are all finished.
Tokusatsu is shit, I officially denounce my brothers, and Donald trump did nothing wrong
That‚Äôs because Biden is being used by the radical left to gain power but President Trump is gonna win in a Landslide !!!!
That Trump, he's a right old Cnut
We all know Trump will say up is down, double down on it and get huge applause from his groupies. The sad part is, it may sway some less intelligent undecided voters‚Äô minds when they perceive Trump‚Äôs belief in his own victory.
Attorneys for Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance argued Monday that President Donald Trump should be forced to comply with a subpoena for his tax documents ‚Äî and suggested that his company was under investigation for alleged insurance and bank fraud.
I don't, but I'm guessing u probably support Trump,believe the world is flat and won't have a vaccine so frankly I couldn't care less.
Yall are that angry about a mural that you have to put paint on top ???? Yall just dont know when to stop .. trump got yall thinking yall are untouchable
Trump will not "follow the rules". Hmm...I'll translate that:  It means Mr. Trump will eat Joe Biden's lunch.
Last month,  a woman made an accusation of sexual assault against Dr. Anthony Fauci. Now, according to Reason, that same woman has admitted that she was paid by Trump supporters to make the accusation in an attempt to get rid of Dr. Fauci.
More or less a Trump template
Not to piss on your chips or anything but water itself isn't wet, it makes other things wet. Doesn't make Trump any less of a c*** though.
What I don't get is how nobody realized Trump holding a bunch of newspapers would look suspicious
Ridiculous. Also who are "the hand sanitizer people?" Surely there is more than one company making hand sanitizer in the US. Trump= blackmail and idiocy!
Don‚Äôt care. If he does, he will get the crap beat out of him. If he doesn‚Äôt, he‚Äôs the Trump tribe‚Äôs problem
He's for bringing jobs back to America, securing our borders, and basically undoing the 8 yrs of Hell that Obama dragged us through. Mr. Trump is bringing back American values.

You mean like Trump ‚Äú falling in love‚Äù with the NK dictator?  Clean your own house first
Counteroffer: You( stop spinning the facts about Covid and what Mr. Trump has done and is doing, and we may consider not believing Mr. Barr(but since he hasn't lied to us before and you guys have repeatedly that's going to be difficult).
Mr. Trump can cognitively string together words to make a coherent sentence. He repeatedly, and successfully, demonstrates this talent on an hourly basis.  Mr. Biden is, to be blunt, an intellectual dumpster fire. It's a wonder he doesn't have people reminding him to breathe.
Russia! Russia! Russia!  That‚Äôs so 2017.  Try to keep up...
Don‚Äôt be a dumbass and twist things around. Go listen to Stella Immanuel and her theories on demon sex causing medical issues, alien dna being in medication and vaccines causing immunity to religion. Trump promotes her so she should be perfect for you.
Team Trump all the way. I say hell no to mail in voting. The only Democrat‚Äôs wants mail in voting is to make it easier for y‚Äôall to rig the numbers. HELL NO TO MAIL IN VOTING. Can I get Amen on that. We the Republicans/ Conservatives need to stick together on this.
Imagine a world without Trump and all his alter egos and his thieving administration
My best friend died May 2019 of cancer. She voted for Trump, I didn‚Äôt. Our friendship didn‚Äôt suffer in the slightest

Trump's probably given it to the Russians already.

Trump can't lose the election (and remain a free man), and Bozo and The Killer Klowns have staked all on Uncle Don. The conclusion is horrible things both sides of Atlantic in coming months.

Aww man now I know if I have just a LITTLE bit of the deadly virus I will be safe. Florida is screwed Rubio and your inaction on trump is partially responsible for it.

Don't worry they aren't going anywhere and this isn't playing well across America.  Keep up the good work  Trump or America and America is winning in a landslide.
95 days before Obama's crew is back in the Whitehouse and back in charge to finish those investigations into Trump and his corrupt administration. I can't wait to read the full Muller report how about you.  It's all coming out. Mark your calendars February 2020
I agree Joe Biden and Obama has the best job creation record of any president in history Trump has one of the worse.  He took a booming economy and road it into the ground. Now it's there are over 50M Americans out of work.
Not as much as Trump.
I hope y‚Äôall know that the only reason TikTok is getting banned is because Trump and his supporters were getting called out for being dumb. Facebook steals more data than TikTok but we not talking bout that
TRUMP IS A LITTLE PISS BABY.
To be clear, the issue here isn't Trump's antagonism toward TikTok (stopped clocks are right twice a day). It's the opposition to letting an American company buy it (or the US piece). SMDH
Whats more interesting to me is how they've suspended their ad-buys until.... whenever.... because their campaign sucks  Trump in November is Bernie in February.*  They both exceeded expectations pitted against The Baroness from Cobra in their eyes (HRC)  But Uncle Joe? Nope

Spurious reasons to delay or cancel elections - right out of Dictatorship for Dummies.
Surviving Autocracy by Masha Gessen review ‚Äì with Trump, there is no shared reality
Don‚Äôt understand this. The 20th Amendment is crystal clear. Trump‚Äôs term of office ends in Jan 21, no ifs no buts. If there‚Äôs no election it‚Äôs up to the House, unless there‚Äôs no House election in which case rule of law has ended.
No, we just recognize that GW was a much better president and definitely a better person than Trump will ever be
One way or another, Donald Trump will leave DC in Jan. It‚Äôs up to him and his stooges if he‚Äôs upright when he does it. He has frayed the nerves of Americans to the point that we WILL remove him one way or another
Well Trump stands to be arrested after Jan 2021 and Pence‚Äôs career is over. A LOT of Congressional members are also toast in Nov. They will blame Trump but they drank the KoolAid
Herman Cain walked into that rally of his own accord knowing damned good and well it was dangerous. Trump‚Äôs stupid but Cain was stupid AND unlucky
Yes, states run all elections, including for federal office, though they must follow some federally set guidelines (where I think this talk is at least a little scary; exec branch has never unilaterally added/changed election guidelines and we don't know what/how Trump will try).
Wonder if Trump will attend any servicesü§î
But no state officials are in the presidential line of succession. If you're saying some states could still hold elections for federal office and Trump would have no non-violent way to stop them, I agree with that.
Trump: "Delay the election?" McConnell: ... Staffer: "Senator, if there is no election before January 3, Governor Beshear can just appoint Amy McGrath." McConnell: "F*ck that sh!t"
Constitution does not specify the date of any election, only the length of terms. Trump's term expires on January 20, 2021 at noon if there is no election, same for VP. All U.S. House terms expire on January 3, 2021 if there is no election, so the Speaker is out too in that case.
That‚Äôs why they resent TRUMP,BORIS ,AND BREXIT  and never have a good word to say about all three!!!!!
This is complete BS. They don't "have to run away from reporters." They can grow a spine and say Trump is wrong, full stop...and people like  (whom I used to respect), can step up and tell them to do just that. Instead, we get nonsense like this. Sickening. #WeWillVote
Now what do you think would happen if we the Republicans/conservatives went after everyone that support Obama and the Clinton‚Äôs. They would have it all over the news or what if we attacked Obama or Clinton‚Äôs the same way they do Trump we would be in jail.
Disagree. Donald Trump is the natural result of the Republican Party's last 60 years.
Imagine if Venezuela talked about suspending elections. The USA would organise a coup or invade them. #Trump
And in January 2025 he will step aside.  Enjoy the next four years of the Trump presidency. We sane, mature, intelligent, responsible, educated, and patriotic adults will. You, on the other hand...

This guy was Trump before Trump, but sloppier with the cover ups!
But seriously, you keep saying, "Your guy." That's a lie. If I vote, it will be in an effort to keep those who love legal infanticide and celebrate sexual perversion out of power. Those are facts, not vague accusations about the Democrat party. Trump is still better than them...

People forget (or never learned) the American Revolution was NOT well supported ... in America.  About 52% were for it &amp; support was falling until the Battle of Trenton on Christmas Day. Washington crosses the Delaware River in early AM fog.   Trump is the Washington of our time.

Tell thd press that Trump is shameful for saying Biden hates God.
Trump was always for Trump not God,  until he was told Saying your godly will get you votes!!
Where‚Äôs Strumpth? Is he lying about Bidens religion?  A man that has broken every Commandment in religion is jumping on another person?  Trump has NEVER READ THE BIBLE! WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE HIS MENTAL SICKNESS SAYS THAT HE KNOWS MORE THAN JESUS CHRIST!
Ugh I still can‚Äôt find it. It was a guy who has some young kids and I wanna say they signed up for hundreds of shipments of trump gear or something?!?!
Now do Trump.
Does anyone have a link to the tweet where the Dad of the gen z'ers was talking about his kids on tik tok doing crap to undermine Trump? Does anyone know what I'm talking about?
Trump obviously doesn't know that.
What a ü§° Trump
As Dems Shout 'Racist,' Will Trump's Black Support Rise?

Chris I Can not understand why Fox News don't fire you. You are a Democrat and you know it ! I have never heard you say any thing good about Trump or about the Republican Party, and you are also a  smart ass.
1/2  GOP Primaries: * Dumbing down of conservatism via Fox News *Trump's "conservative" media friends pushed him (Rush, Hannity, O'Reilly, etc &amp; bashed others *Appealed to latent racism, the "can't tell me what to do" folk, &amp; conspiracists'.  *Free media *Entertaining (for some)

House Intel Chair, Adam Schiff knew about #Bountygate since February, and said nothing till Late June.  Sounds more like the blood falls on HIS hands, not Trump's.
Yeah...a visible effect of the Trump Virus.  When it hits you, everything in you contortsüòÇ.  Need more reasons to VOTE HIM OUT in November?
If widespread civil unrest involving black people wasn't driving up Trump's numbers a month ago, why would dissolving the NRA help him now?
I don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs all Trumps fault?  When we have a Governor that put a plan into motion, then a school board that put a plan into motion? All Trump said was he believes that kids should be in school.  I think plenty of Democrats and Republicans  believe that also?
Out of curiosity, what do you make of the four points in this article?
DeWine took the test as part of standard protocol before meeting President Trump at an airport in Cleveland.
I would give Trump GA, FL and TX due to voter suppression/cheating, and OH and IA are the true toss-ups..everything else is likely lol
Biden is hardly "just stuttering". There is a reason there won't be any debates. That's because he can't string together three sentences without losing his train of thought or saying something stupid. They're hiding him. Trump, however, would love to engage in debate.
Except the Trump voter's are motivated primarily by racism, not gun rights. Racism has been the one constant feature through both of Trump's campaigns and his term in office.  I'm more worried about 2A people going terrorist than outnumbering Democrats at the polls.
I remember when a bunch of Twitter people, me included, were worried that the rioting in Minneapolis and elsewhere were going to help Trump and hurt Biden.  Over a month later, their numbers are solidly the same.  I would listen less to alarmist hot takes if I were you.
No they're not lol..if so, they would've been dumped Trump and passed a stimulus bill. Stop with these BS articles
If widespread racial unrest wasn't motivating Trump voters before, I doubt dissolving the NRA will motivate them now.
If widespread civil unrest involving black people wasn't motivating Trump voters before, I doubt dissolving the NRA will motivate them now.
Why do you say such stupid things about the Supreme Court? If anything doesn‚Äôt go to your politics they are ‚Äúbad people‚Äù. Most kids getting abortions are Republikids! They are so ashamed that they got pregnant that they want an abortion! Trump raped many tweens and got them

I agree that the Republicans are cowards. I was 90% sure I'd vote for Trump this coming election (I stayed home last time), now I'm 75% to stay home. It's all a crap show now. The choice is between a bafoon with an attitude and a bafoon with dementia :(
Policy lust? That's a new one for me. That's fair, and if true, same holds for the other side. A vote for the Democrat party is a vote for infanticide and sexual perversion. The Democrats are WAY worse than Trump. I guess professing Christians should just stay home?
I see the ‚Äútruth‚Äù and hopefully it‚Äôs with Trump saying something to the wrong person one day. Karmas a bitch. üòò

Honestly idk why people are shocked by Jerry‚Äôs yacht photos. He‚Äôs seen that his base literally could not care any less about his or Trump‚Äôs moral character so he doesn‚Äôt have to hide his lack of any character at all anymore.
I just wonder if Portland realizes that there's a pretty good chance that federal funding will be withheld as a result of this insurrection. Trump has already withheld funding for Minnesota, after Antifa damaged over 1k buildings.
Good luck with the "Trump is a racist" excuse when you have Antifa wounding and/or murdering Black people for the crime of supporting Trump.

In the mind of a Christian, giving hearty approval to LGBTQ folks and parents that want to off their unborn children at the expense of their souls is the epitome of "recklessly incompetent". More recklessly incompetent than even Donald Trump, and it's not close.
No. But if a vote for a 3rd candidate is a defacto vote for Joe Biden, a man who calls abortion "healthcare", then you might as well vote Democrat. Yes, referring to abortion as "healthcare" is worse than anything Trump has done. It's a declaration that abortion is "good".

As an Evangelical who criticized Bill Clinton for his lack of character, how could I possibly overlook Trump's lack of character, let alone vote for the guy???
Yea there seems to be a stigma of Trump is the benevolent president who can do no wrong and you are a terrible person for thinking he can in a lot of conservative circles. I try to praise him when he makes good decisions and criticize when he makes bad ones.
I have no issues with being testy with China! And I fully understand that TikTok isn‚Äôt private and might be a risk. But I still don‚Äôt think that gives Trump the authority to just ban it likes he thinks he does.
And that‚Äôs perfectly valid! I don‚Äôt begrudge anyone for voting Trump because they thought he was a better alternative. I just think people are sometimes blinded to his flaws in an attempt to justify it :).
Yea, I know that in my case, I see him as better than the democratic alternative that would expand the power of the federal government even more than trump has
What great irony that Trump is getting testy with China by threatening to ban American citizens from a social media app, something China has been doing for years.  What greater irony that almost all of his supporters would consider themselves to be supporting limited government.
Trump campaign needs to focus on this
The other thing I've seen people saying about this is that it will radicalize Gen Z against Trump.  Like...idk do we want a bunch of kinds who's political awakening occurred when Trump banned their favorite app? How likely is it that they are also going to push for progressivism?
...so exact same number of people who actually attended was the same had the kpop stans not done that.  Secondly a few countries are ready in talks over banning TikTok as well, so this isnt 100% due to Trump‚Äôs pettiness.
trump wouldn‚Äôt care
Trump is in it, so was Bill , I even read of a movie star I really like went to that island . But we cannot prejudge people. We have to let it all play out unless we were personally involved
Hope Sleepy Joe picks her as his running mate, then it'll be an easy slam dunk for Trump in November

I disagree. Dems come off looking unreasonable to American public. Dems know Trump will take the win if they find agreement on anything.  Both sides dig in, but Trump is too shrewd &amp; loves the people more than Dems, so he will always find or make a way for the win.

We see this incident very differently. I firmly believe that conservatives would LOSE THEIR MINDS if Hilary Clinton had been president and then mentioned delaying the upcoming election. We would call her a tyrant, but Trump? He‚Äôs just concerned for the process. I disagree.
Because he isn't Trump, he isn't insane, and he stands a better chance of winning than Howie Hawkins.  If you really want change, you win power by voting Dem. Voting green means you're in it for stubborn pride.

Get Ready for Trump's Second Term
The pandemic, which is not Trump's fault because he didn't create the virus. But he is certainly responsible for how America looks right now. Trump has done nothing to help mitigate the spread. Trump doesn't want a shut down economy because of the aforementioned market stuff.
Trump didn't just walk in and make the market better, overnight. But they think so. Which is not how it works. But they think it, so it's obviously true.   But what they don't see, what they fail to even remotely acknowledge, is the pitfalls of the market during the pandemic.
But the Trump people give ALL the credit to Trump. He is their Presidential God. When they say "the stock market is the best it's ever been" it's only the best because that's the one thing they can claim with Trump, which again, is a basic achievement.
Guess what, people made money with Obama too. Is that weird?   The people I know, friends and family, with a lot of money didn't just make money the last 4 years with Trump. They cashed in on Obama post-recession. Made money during Clinton and held together for most of Bush.
This is what Trump has done to his base; he's gaslighted and brainwashed millions with divisive rhetoric, empty content and at best, false pride for basic achievement. To them, Trump is the financial superhero because their bank accounts and portfolios have increased.
I asked a question about how Trump has handled the pandemic. His response wasn't based in facts; he immediately went to the stock market and said "America is respected again." I called him out on some of the inconsistencies with his answers and he stormed off in a fit of rage.
Last night at a bar (outside bar) a man, almost twice my age, and I got into a discussion about BLM, sports and ultimately Trump and politics. It must be stated that this man is a cheerleading pom pom waving MAGA to death Trump guy and I am not.

No, the unemployment is a result of not taking covid seriously and acting decisively. We could have taken care of it like most other countries with a strong national response. Obama reduced the deficit, Trump is setting records.
Is the Trump Admin's decision to refuse to help with Covid in states with Democratic governors not a genocidal decision? Purposely letting thousands of Americans die in the hope that it hurts your political opponents is at least genocide adjacent.

Well to be fair, all of the European Union, Canada, Australia, Japan, Mexico and a hefty portion of the United States want to see Trump defeated as well. It's not an exclusive club.  There's really only one foreign entity who REALLY wants to see him re-elected; Vladimir Putin.

Good. Trump isn't a business person, he's an idiot and as soon as he's gone perhaps Russia will disappear into the dark like before along with their Kentucky aluminum plant. Canada is showing Trump they won't stand for his crap.
What I don't understand is that by withholding $600 to unemployment insurance Trump isn't just harming individuals, he's harming landlords, like Jared &amp; himself. How easily will landlords find new tenants? He'll lose their vote too, so I guess that's the only plus?
FYI: I lost over 130 followers today. I'm honestly not thinking I actually pissed off or insulted that many people. So, I'm thinking it is just more typical Jack doing his algorhythm thing against known and outted Trump supporters. It's a strange world, isn't it?

There are a half-dozen people (the quoted guy chief among them) who play this role for Trump. I am aware of no such people who play this role for any prominent Democrats, in part because there are no prominent Democrats who routinely say things like ‚ÄúTwo Corinthians,‚Äù etc.
7) As a long, self-outed supporter of Trump, it has been my policy since 2016 to never say a negative thing about him. I've always figured he had plenty of enemies enough that he didn't need his friends criticizing. The thing is, I was NOT a fledgling pollster through all that.

I think Trump is absolutely awful. I hate him. He's a fascist racist thug. But one thing about Trump's vice I like: It's obvious. It stands out like a dime in a goat's ass.  But Obama was just as bad-- where it counts--in MANY respects--&amp; hid all with gracious manners &amp; a smile
Party is more consequential.  In my opinion it is the betrayal of the American people by the Democratic Party that made Trump inevitable.  You want to know who elected Donald Trump? Obama voters. People who wanted change and when it did not come said:   Fuck you! We're out.
I hate Trump. If I had to choose between Trump and Obama who to be shipwrecked with it would be Obama.  But although under Trump the Oval office is uniquely for sale and corruption flows like sewage from the top down I really do think the deception of its base by the Democratic
Oh, good. Glad to see this Trump slip getting coverage while Biden's TWO BOMBSHELLS: "are you a junkie?" to a Black reporter, and "unlike the African American community" are basically being ignored....
Trump is obvious. Very few people are confused.  Democratic betrayal is more subtle. It's harder to see. That's why I at this moment instead of pissing on Trump I'm saying   focus on that.
Make no mistake. I hate Trump and he's a vicious liar. A racist fascist sack of shit.  But he's pretty open about all that, despite all his lying. What's harder to see if you want to know the truth is that the Democratic party has colluded in America becoming an oligarchy
The point I'm making is more important than the point you're making.  Yes. Trump is in the running for worst liar ever. And yet--  There is no wall--but Trump tried.  There is no public option-- Obama did not.  Now rich. So who's corrupt?
Joe Biden doesn't have to carry a bible to events to prove his faith, he lives by it therefore people can see it. With Trump it's all word, no action, from corruptness of his spirit to his dirty penis in anything that will move whether the person says no or not. #VoteBiden2020
Trump reversed things when he took office so that kids could eat junk food at school again, while Mexico has moved to ban junk food in school! WTG Mexico! Obesity kills especially during this pandemic.

So that was all Biden‚Äôs doing? Biden is acknowledging mistakes and the need for police reforms. Trump wants the most vicious cops to be thugs, stay on the beat and kill people. I‚Äôll take Biden over that and Trump‚Äôs white nationalist militias any day.
No it isn‚Äôt. It shows how easily defeated you are. Like it or not, Biden is the only defense against an even more brutal fascist crackdown if Trump is re-elected. What do you think is going to happen to immigrants, elderly &amp; working poor in a 2nd Trump term? Do you like cruelty?
Biden made comments to donors in early 2019 that he wasn‚Äôt going to turn the socio-economic order upside down. You equate that to meaning there will be no progressive reforms or major policy initiatives in a Biden Admin. Ask progressive legislators you trust what they think.

The Trump Campaign in 2020 is truly one of the worst campaigns of all time when the ball was always in their court.  In no way does the average voter believe Kamala Nor Biden are part of the "far left" (I wish they were).  He continues to pander to his 30-40% of idiot voters.
Left wing lolol the ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù are freaking out and screaming and crying about not only Biden but this pick. Meanwhile those of us who vote are pretty cool cool with this tickets. Let‚Äôs go!
Bad pick Biden lol!!!
Bad pick Biden, my moderate Democrat GF won‚Äôt vote for you now because you picked a bad VP canadate, anyone else but Harris lol!!!!üòÇ I suspect a lot of moderate Dems feel the same!!!!
I gave you a twitter list of progressive issues that contrast Biden from Trump. Sanders &amp; Biden had a joint task force which moved Biden in 6 policy areas &amp; AOC was named to co-chair Biden‚Äôs climate task force. Biden is listening &amp; there will be more progress when he is POTUS.
biden said here üòå this is what u wanted right? üòå
Great choice Biden-Harris sounds great! On to victory in November
Who are you trying to fool?? Joe Biden is such a racist!!
Love Biden‚Äôs VP pick. Go Kamala Harris and the Biden campaign
this PROVES biden isn't sexist and/or racist! his running mate is female and black! hell yeah go politics
College football 2020 is dying, Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick, and I went inside a grocery store for the first time since February. Most eventful day of the summer!
Dave, I don‚Äôt think you appreciate how far the Democratic Party has moved in the past 4 years &amp; the importance of staying in the game even when your candidate loses. 4 years ago Bernie Sanders, AOC &amp; other Social Dems did not have the influence they have today. Biden is listening
Never done this before.  I‚Äôm a registered Republican.  But I‚Äôm going to #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt  Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Joe Biden‚Äôs advisors told him he has selected a running mate
The ‚Äútake away close‚Äù vote in mass to give Biden landslide. Show the power block of 18-29, then you have leverage when you say you will take that away. No other action gives something valuable, then can take away later. This is how you show them.
Biden acknowledges past mistakes and attempts to atone for them. I‚Äôll take Obama and leaders of the Congressional black caucus and civil rights movement as character references for him. What do you have for Trump?
This election is basically do you want to stall US disintegration with Biden until we get a progressive President or do you increase US destruction with Trump. Very interesting dynamic.
Vice President doesn't matter for Biden. Those who say they won't for Biden because of "X VP Pick" just wanted another excuse to not vote Biden when they already had many by looking at his record.
Besides the 30-40% of far rights who will never abandon Trump, the Republican party still has a base who aren't too fond of Trump. They see Kasich and other non-Trump Republicans unite with Biden and it will away a small but noticeable voter block.
Putting aside Biden = Republican Light  and All current Republicans = Bad, Kasich realized that being on the side of Trump is on the wrong side of history. He's smart to realize this and the democratic party centrists will be welcoming him with open arms
Character counts. Biden has it, Trump doesn‚Äôt. Biden is learning &amp; reaching out, he‚Äôs not senile &amp; demented. Democratic socialists who equate Biden to Trump are not serious about electoral politics &amp; will sit on the sidelines &amp; merely judge &amp; complain about the world around them.
Biden is said he will undo Trump‚Äôs tax giveaway to the rich. If that‚Äôs your beef that Biden won‚Äôt go after plutocrats money hard enough then you are missing a lot of issues that matter.
Who did he say that to and when? The differences between Biden and Trump on a wide range of issues are huge and there is no comparison who is the more progressive candidate. Never Biden is being pro-Trump. It‚Äôs a binary choice between the two who will be elected POTUS in November
Mayor Pete is another centrist that won't advance the country forward like Biden and the rest of his cabinet. However I will always take them over the alternative fascists in red.  Once (if) they are in the office they must be bullied on the daily.
I hope you‚Äôll reconsider. Biden will move our country in a progressive direction at a time it is desperately needed. He will advance climate, health care, social/environmental justice, gun laws, election reform, tax fairness, judiciary appts, DC statehood, immigration reform, etc
Biden lol
Biden is fine. Even if he was in decline, he isn‚Äôt dangerous and unstable like Trump. Trump does not care at all about what damage he could do to the country.
Weird flex, dude. They prefer Biden bc they know he isn‚Äôt a tantrum throwing weirdo...
Just a reminder: the Revolutionary Communist Party endorsed Joe Biden last week.
The ads for the Democrats and Biden write themselves with this.
We MUST deliver the West for VP Biden!! Let‚Äôs go!!
Blacks are not your puppets and Biden is as racist as every other democrat!
I think a Biden Presidency would be funnier than a Trump one. With Trump its the same old lying, pivoting, and self gloating but with EVERY Biden speech there's gonna be something new due to cognitive decline.  We could literally hear an N word bomb cause he forgot he cant say it
True, but Never Trump means you‚Äôre for Biden or it doesn‚Äôt mean a thing.The problem is you guys never acknowledge anything he did or accomplished, like he is total evil. Even most of you guys' supports to Biden are not out of enthusiasm, but rather simply based on your hatred on Trump. I won't have any problem to acknowledge good things done by Obama
I like your dog, but let's keep Trump. Four years of Biden would be too boring
The frustrating thing is that is seems exaggerated and ridiculous when you read it in the emails but I know people whose facebook posts read exactly like this. Like how do you even respond to someone who honestly believes Joe Biden is a socialist??
That‚Äôs right Paris. The rioters are actually funded by the DNC. What I find amazing is the you believe that Joe Biden has the power to stop all this. An excellent reason to vote for him in November!  Thanks for the endorsement
This was an eloquent, and thereby joyous description of why Biden's choice of Kamala Harris was, perfect. When logic and instinct are realized, when mind and heart say the same thing, there is joy.
Biden is the new FDR and we have all coming down with a case of being Japanese-American
Just printed Biden's climate action plan to read. Pretty bulky, 25 pages. Thought, wonder what Trump has put out. Why would I even wonder that? It's a paragraph. Three sentences. And it denies climate change's existence. Please vote against this man.
How much are you donating to the Biden/Harris campaign?  You have been stumping for Kamala for 2 days now. Keep up the good work.
I am voting for Biden.
Joe Biden's silence on this issue is deafening.
I noticed neither Biden nor Harris mentioned mass shootings as one of the big problems we face.
Here‚Äôs to hoping they get to debate, while also praying that VP Biden &amp; Trump never EVER, under any cirmcustance share a debate stage
Joe Biden has a framed Hagar the Horrible strip in his office
#LetYangSpeakDNC The DNC doesn't want the: asian, nerd, progressive, logical, intelligent vote. Just like 2016 they know what their doing. Biden is a sure thing....
Good thing Biden and Harris are experienced with how govt should run. Biden should have staff prepared for this. His cabinet picks should be able to work on Day One. I‚Äôm sure they know this will probably happen and will plan for it. We need a fully staffed and functioning govt.
#LetYangSpeakDNC biden doesn't want to be outshined so if  speaks He'll have to go first (while the cameras are setting up, or in the parking lot to the #yanggang who only showed up for the prize fighter.)
We don‚Äôt need to pretend like Biden is going to be president for any reason other than being associated with Obama
Are you serious? Biden is a catholic! Do your homework
Cornyn is effing terrified. Down ballot voting will be his demise. Vote Biden/ Harris and  in November.
Okay, it‚Äôs Harris. Live with it and VOTE BIDEN you people!
Lay off the communion wine, Bishop; Biden is Catholic.
Namaste, Kamala.üôèThe deepest respect, and so too to Joe Biden. No matter the outcome, the intent is compassionate effort to promote the virtues of honesty, decency  and loving kindness, and those are worth fighting for.
Policing is a major issue coming up today with Kamala being chosen. A Biden DOJ can enforce force decrees in problematic police departments, a small start. Vote local for bigger reforms on these issues: prosecutors and sheriffs are a lot more powerful than the VP on this
Yeah. The fact that it's come down to these two shows how rotten this country's social fabric has become. Imagine having someone like Warren or Bernie but voting for the old neo-liberal war hawks in big 2020. In any other developed country, Biden would be considered Right Wing
Yep. Fwiw, I don't think Biden is that much better than trump. The only reason any true progressive should vote for Biden is to deny the conservatives to take over the Supreme Court and destroy this country. Also, climate change. Otherwise they're the same on every other issue
When is Trump going to announce his VP pick?
Willie Brown's girlfriend passed the sniff test Kamala to Biden: I don't think you are a racist but...
*satirical story time with uncle sam*  K: ‚Äújoe biden is a racist‚Äù J: ‚Äúwanna bet?‚Äù  *announces vp decision* K: ‚Äújoe will be the savior of the free world and is only racist towards oompa loompas!‚Äù
I am so happy about your pick as Biden‚Äôs running mate.
The complete lack of ticket splitting that now occurs means that Biden might end up winning a few states (GA, NC, IA, MT, AZ) because the senate candidate (and governor in the case of NC) is running ahead of him
(Stifling a mirthful laugh every time I see another "Biden's V.P. is named Imminent" Twitter joke.)
I do feel we need to see Biden make sound choices. The VP will be the first. I think all on the list would be great so I‚Äôm not worried. We need logic and common sense back in our govt. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Biden's America of the future: Everyone to be tagged and traced during relocation to your nearest declining major city.
Valid point but Biden is a straight up pedophile it‚Äôs a lose lose type of election ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I call it Good Master Syndrome. Biden feels his racism is OK because he's keeping Blacks from being sold to the bad master. It explains all the violence and racism against African Americans by white AntiFa. Their racism is a virtue in their eyes.Because the Democrats are loud noise end of noxious it makes me kind of fearful that Biden will win in November but I keep the faith and pray and I am casting my vote for Donald Trump in November. I think deep down the conservatives are a silent majority with class
I pray everyday to God that President Trump gets re-elected because if Biden is elected our country is once again going to get sold out the China and we can't let that happen!! Democrats always sell out our country. Democrats are loud and noisy!!
Trump is not a traitor!! Bill Clinton may have been a good physical president but he's sold out America to the Chinese communist government by sending most of our jobs over there. Biden would sell out our country again to China just like Obama did
I can hardly wait until President Trump unleashes that video from Joe Biden's bribery over in the Ukraine back in 2014 when he was holding back that won billion dollars and American aid until the prosecutor over there was fired. I'm waiting for that to air on CBS and NBC
I pray so because I pray everyday that President Trump gets re-elected because Joe Biden in the Democrats will sell our country out to China again if they win. We were on top economically after being sold out by Bill Clinton to China. China let loose covid-19?!!!
And, in all fairness, I wouldn't approve of/support such suspiciously untimely, obstructionist action by any admin &amp;/or POTUS; whether it was Biden, Obama, Bush, Clinton or by any U.S. president.  I can't help but wonder where are all of the so-called 'constitutionalists' now.
President Trump on Friday told hundreds of New York Police Department officers that ‚Äúno one will be safe in Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù if the former Democratic vice president defeats him in November .
Now isn't the time to be apolitical but now isn't the time to blindly support Joe Biden in the two-party system.
Alright so we're doing this...  Msg me proof of a new (as of this tweet) donation of at least $5 to either Biden or Win the Era, your mailing address, &amp; which one you want &amp; I'll mail it!  Donate $10 &amp; I'll send both!   Joe is a magnet &amp; Iowa is a sticker.  Benefits USPS too üòÅ
WOW!  You are predicting what will happen if the child molester (Biden) and the slut (Harris) gets in!  Trump has done a great job!
If anyone in the Roanoke area would like to be in the photo op for #UnitedForBiden #SignsAcrossAmerica today, here is the event info!  530pm at The Star, 615pm at the MLK Memorial!
Damn Biden ü§£ü§£ü§£
Glad the CCP didn't choose Adam Schiff for Biden's running mate. Then we would be stuck with Sniff &amp; Schiff!
How will you persuade Biden/Harris by uncritically supporting them? Delusional.
"If" Biden wins, the only thing that will change is that I'll see a lot less blue wave emojis in my twitter feed
The difference between a Trump supporter and a Biden supporter ? The Trump  supporter cannot show compassion to others. I can give them a number for a good psychiatrist.
I got ya two of the biggest boobs right here.
Oh, and by the way what about Hillary Clinton's character? Joe Biden character?
Opening salvo by  about national mask mandate was a mistake. Should have been healthcare, COVID recovery, or even save the Post Office. Biden should clarify he will not muzzle the people through the use of EOs and rule by fiat like Trump. #BidenHarris2020 #Election2020
made a mistake with an opening salvo implying a national mask mandate. Should have been healthcare, COVID relief, or even "we will save the Post Office." Biden needs to clarify he does not plan to muzzle the people through rule by fiat &amp; EO like Trump. #BidenHarris2020
Every liberal talking point about Biden, Trump, and the 2020 election is predicated on a frightening ignorance of US history.
The nightmare would be if you and Biden Are elective. We would be the communist country of the United States.
‚ÄúThe country‚Äôs most outspoken critic of voting by mail has requested his vote-by-mail ballot.‚Äù
I mean Biden said himself ‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change‚Äù. We have a party on the right and then one in the center that has more and more people pulling away every day. A 3rd party is needed now more than ever.
The great Salena Zito has seen some Biden signs in her travels, but they're outnumbered several times over by Trump signs.
Wtf #ComradesAssemble we never approved #khive fuck Biden. We ain't falling in line. Force DNC to lose 2020 so the people can take 2022. Let's see your strategy in VA 5th. The left falling in line more like waiting for #octoberuprising is going to show you who the Republicans are
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
I look forward to HuffPo asking Biden when he stopped beating his wife.
Help these comrades and help me. I've gone from 10 to almost 800 in 5 days. Thank you for showing the love. #ComradeCollab #ComradesAssembleVA #nocomradeunder1k fuck Biden fuck khive #octoberuprising #GeneralStrike2020
"We all agree on the need to reopen the economy and allow some semblance of normalcy as soon as possible."  -Joe Biden  That doesn't seem substantially different to me.
I'm glad someone is writing everything down. Fuck Biden by the way. I had to say it. Now I feel better
This woman is an ambitious nightmare. I'm praying and working hard for a 2020 Trump re-election but if Biden wins and Kamala ends up taking over his job, the DNC and Congress will wish they never picked her for his running mate!!! She's a BITCH
‚ÄúThis is America. Be a patriot. Protect your fellow citizens. Step up, do the right thing.‚Äù said Biden.
Gonna need some [citation] on those Biden claims
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Virginia educators celebrate Joe Biden‚Äôs school reopening plan
I will be proudly voting for Biden/Harris!
Biden and Harris go on about how Trump is doing during the virus. Dems did NOTHING! They were involed with impeachment! Period. THEY wrote off the virus. They are full of shhhtuff. Trump started attacking it in Jan. Pelosi laughed it off! #WalkAway #KAG2020 #TheFive #Tucker
In a statement, Biden's campaign said the president is "sabotaging a basic service that hundreds of millions of people rely upon."
I don‚Äôt know where they are but I sure wish they‚Äôd start doing SOMETHING to help Biden/Harris!
That Jackass Biden said he's happy about the peace deal between Israel and UAE. That it was because of work he did with Obama. They actively interfered with Isreal elections! They did nothing. Dems accuse you for evil they do and take credit for good you do. #WalkAway #KAG2020

So QAnon Greene is going to win congressional seat in Georgia.  abandons left to get Republicans against Trump. First question I'm going to ask Biden's VP Take a look at VA 5th tell me what Republicans are going against Trump. Ask  about radicals #ComradeCollab
But we are putting an end to this nonsense that's why were kicking Trump to the curb and electing Biden/Harris 2020. Trump's done enough damage to the country.
I have to say I'm in for Biden-Harris.
Biden don't and she is going to work for her "clients" not people #noterfvp
Democrats are close to matching, if not surpassing, the $300 million cash stockpile President Donald Trump and Republicans reported in July

Biden raises $26M in 24 hours after Harris VP announcement
Fuck Joe Biden.  #noterfvp fucking sellout badge
I was for Amy. Biden chose Harris. I‚Äôm all in for Biden/Harris. I trust Joe. The alternative is 7 kinds of crazy. Biden/Harris!!!!
This was an entire article about two people who said completely rational things. All while sending a message of unity and hope to the country in a time of crisis.  Who ever thought this would be some sort of treasured novelty?
Fox News Insists That Joe Biden Didn‚Äôt Really Pick Kamala Harris. WTF?!!
YES! Except for the part when I sat in the oncology waiting room and the MAGA folks were talking about how the country was going to ruin if Biden was elected, because he was bringing in the new world order. How misinformed can people be? I asked them to please not talk politics.
Kamala Harris is expected to play a prominent role in fundraising for the campaign.
So is Joe Biden disrespectful because he pronounced it the same way?
#KamalaChameleon was in 5th place in her own state! Why would anyone think that would get Biden over the top?!  #WalkAway #KAG2020 #Tucker
So is Joe Biden a racist?
remember when everyone made fun of trump cause he only half filled a huge arena during covid. Biden and comma got a nice little church crowd though
So is it the same when Biden mispronounces the name of Chameleon Kamala the EXACT same way #Tucker did?!!  Or is it he's a dem so the same rules don't apply?! Basic journalism is anything but CNN.  #WalkAway #KAG2020
Don‚Äôt pretend to be taking some kind of nuanced high road here. Four of your seven criticisms of Biden are of his appearance. You should be ashamed of yourself. #FakePriest
I read something about this in 2015 or 16. It was about how Bernie and Hillary had intentionally cultivated first-name brands (I don‚Äôt recall the rationale). Regardless, Harris and Biden haven‚Äôt done that.
The whole thing is really odd. Like: most of these insults are more fitted to Trump. I would never describe Biden as ‚Äútan.‚Äù
"He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
Biden/Harris all the way!  Excited
why even give Biden Harris coverage when middle class America is in a financial stranglehold by the idiots on the hill? Because the FBI, Green New Deal and convention lineup  are wwaayy more important..
WHAT???    Goes straight to Biden and Harris. Truly....Who are these two people?
True, learning from media is not better like learning by direct contact.  My twin sister was in hospital for surgery, in case if you wonder where I am.  You should strict of defend and attack only the Biden, and let Vice President does it with Harris.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
Hear from Joe Biden and his pick for VP, Kamala Harris ‚¨áÔ∏è
WATCH: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris appear together one day after Harris becomes Biden's running mate for the 2020 Presidental Election.
Biden is just the Forgetful Pedophile.. but Democrats seem to think that is "ok"..üôÑ Pathetic!
Or even Biden as VP with Obama..
He was way ahead until the MSM and the DNC rallied around Biden, with the help of other candidates strategically dropping out and endorsing Biden before Super Tuesday. He was robbed.
Trump and Biden have enough coverage to show how bad they are so why not looking for a 3rd option? Settling for the less corrupt is just wrong. It can be a vote for trump but if all the anti trump people voted for a third party instead of a lightweight trump it wouldnt be wasted
Kamala Harris is the perfect VP for Biden. When either one of them opens their mouths, you know they're going to blow it
This is about making sure the Supreme Court and the justice system isn‚Äôt turned into an extreme conservative activist organization, about healthcare, about closing the gap. Biden/Harris won‚Äôt achieve everything but they won‚Äôt be actively working against these things like Trump.
And fwiw...Biden nor Harris were not even in my top 3. There are serious and valid concerns with both of them. But goddamn if I‚Äôm not #BidenHarris2020 full throttle up in this piece.
She was picked to replace Joe Biden
There‚Äôs a difference between trump messing up timelines once in a while vs Biden who every single time he speaks it sounds like mindless rambling and making no sense and forgetting things like the Declaration of Independence
The woman who called him racist and believes his sexual assault accusers is now his #1 fan huh. Biden probably already forgot who she is honestly
#SorosAP confirms Heels Up Harris will replace Biden either on the ticket or on Inauguration Day -- IF they won
Suburban housewife for BIDEN/HARRIS!!
I'm not at all interested in vote shaming anyone supporting this ticket, but if we have a Biden/Harris term(s), we cannot then just forget about their records, get complacent, and turn them into heroes for saving us from Trump as liberals did and still do with Obama.

Here‚Äôs how prominent Virginians reacted to Joe Biden‚Äôs choice of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as his vice presidential running mate.
I agree with the ‚Äòagenda‚Äô. But one thing I asked myself in earnest after Biden named his VP pick is why she would join him after she stated her distaste for Hume early in the primary. ü§î
He always mad bout something. üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ  "President Trump responds to Kamala Harris‚Äô selection as Biden‚Äôs VP and political analysts look at how it might impact the race"
I agree with Stephen Colbert. ‚ÄúThank god it‚Äôs Kamala. I was worried Biden was going to pick someone else who would have made me absolutely still vote for him no matter what‚Äù.
The stock market this morning tells you all you need to know about Biden/Harris
I'm sure there is plenty of room for distancing, it'll just be her, Biden, Obama, an oversized poster of himself, a set of golf clubs, a klan hood, copies of Mein Kampf, and Gaslighting for Dummies (A Dummies Guide to Gaslighting Dummies), and a semi-nude photo of Sean Hannity.
Biden/Harris says "We like Trump's policies, we just wouldn't like to go to brunch with him"
I won't breathe a sigh of relief until Trump is on the Marine helicopter after Biden has been sworn in.
IMO the genuine beliefs Biden seem to be relatively conservative; Kerry is a mixed bag. Edwards and Harris seem to hold few genuine beliefs and how right/left they are is probably entirely due to what resonates in the era they‚Äôre running in
They're just in the honeymoon period right now. Not a lot about the Biden campaign to get excited about, this gives them SOMEthing, so they'll play it up as much as they can. The news content beast requires constant feeding; they'll latch on to anything new.
Strategically, keeping Warren in the Senate makes more sense. She will have a major influence on the Biden administration, though, without any doubt.

people: abolish the fucking police biden: we hear you, here‚Äôs Kamala :)
Almost entirely out of coincidence, joe Biden and Kamala Harris were the first blue candidates I ever donated money to (first Harris, then Biden) and we‚Äôre the first politicians I signed up for newsletters from
He better have these advisors debate for him because a senile Biden can‚Äôt even remember what he‚Äôs running for or where he is half the time basically, he will create a million gaffes during them if he even will go through with it. Dems needed a stronger candidate
Kamala is a good pick because Biden‚Äôs other options were a cartoon assault rifle or a sentient pair of handcuffs
Bring it on, she‚Äôs to dishonest to handle Trump. Plus, isn‚Äôt it Biden who should be debating?  Hmmmmm
Yeah. We all know why he hosted beauty pageants. Pretty sure nobody in the U.S. thinks Trump isn't dirty in multiple senses of the term. But the Dems decided to pick a candidate who doesn't pose the best contrast on that issue, and a VP who said she believes Biden's accusers.
Trump. Biden and Harris are both empty vessels being manipulated by others. I'd rather pick randomly from a phone book. And I don't know which outcome is likely to lead to the least violence after the election, I fear we're in for more widespread rioting either way.
I‚Äôm joe Biden and I forgot this uhh don‚Äôt you know, you know the thing..

Ok Biden fans, why should I vote for the old rich man and the cop? They‚Äôre not gonna change anything, why should I vote for Republicans with a D next to their names instead of the Green Party candidate who was endorsed by the DSA?
Lmao if you think Biden and Kamala are the radical left, you need to study up on the political compass..
"This is history. Kamala is a trailblazer who will serve this country well as the first Black and Asian American woman on a major party's ticket."
Exactly where Biden has been hiding for 6 months.
A few of my followers are upset that Biden picked Kamala to be his running mate. These same people also claim to hate Trump, so here‚Äôs my question, what‚Äôre y‚Äôall gonna do come November?
bro i'm ALL for Warren, I love any true progressive.    Does Warren have to give up her seat?  I remember Biden keeping his Senator role and even breaking "ties" on the floor.... if we keep her presence in the senate i'd love it.  but i doubt we do
how do I vote for biden Harris ticket? Has the Khive pushed Harris "progressive left" enough? I need more than just "defeat trump". I'm going to be a climate refugee in 10 years.
Trump is trash, Biden is trash, the american political system is all trash. Burn it all down tbh

Until we do away with our stupid two party system it's always going to come down to that, unfortunately. I'm voting for #BidenHarris2020, not because I love Joe Biden, but because he's the best chance to kick that nasty POS out of office.

Biden, you're a moron. Nice way to show the people you're listening, dumbass
Agreed,I've never been more disgusted by the Democratic Party than I am right now, there isn't a possible way they could have put up a worse ticket.That being said I will still vote and vote Democratic.I can't say it, I can't say "I will vote Biden/Harris". I will but can'tsay it

Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Biden selects Kamala Harris as running mate
That‚Äôs exactly what I think. Trump‚Äôs been harping on Biden wanting to defund the police. She will be all over that
BREAKING: Joe Biden has selected Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP running mate
#BREAKING Joe Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his running mate.
BREAKING: Joe Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP running mate
The Associated Press reports an announcement is imminent. We are standing by.
Biden selects running mate, expected to be revealed as early as today, reports say
And if there are no debates it‚Äôs because Biden will refuse to do them, trump whether hated or not it‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôs excited to debate Biden. I‚Äôm sure he will be called a ‚Äúlying dog faced pony solider‚Äù a few times lol
Trump is far from perfect but if the best the Dems got is Biden then all Dems should not feel to confident about that. And come on man it‚Äôs clear Biden has some degree of dementia. He can‚Äôt even remember where he is, he can‚Äôt remember the Declaration of Independence etc etc
Trump is skeevy, too. Hell, he used to hang out with Bill Clinton. I'd much rather have a random person out of a phone book than either of these old grifters. But saying Joe Biden is a "seize the moment" candidate is ridiculous.
I thought maybe he would not give notice of the announcement so Trumpty Dumpty can‚Äôt try to call a presser to take away the attention from Biden.
Reminder that if Hillary had won, 0 sports would not have been cancelled. Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania all have teams that play in the Big Ten. Because of 45 there will be no fall college sports. Vote Biden.
This movement is growing and fast. So many people feel like they can not relate to either party‚Äôs towed line anymore. If a Dem speaks out against Biden then they get attacked, if a Repub speaks out against Trump they are attacked. Its so exhausting for a growing number of people
Theory: Trump continues to announce/do ridiculous things to get headlines and blunt Biden's VP announcement. Biden recognizes this strategy - he is trying to maneuver to capitalize on the least crazy to get his own headlines with his VP announcement #Election2020 #Veepstakes
Biden is mentally incapable, forget political agendas the man is just too old, he probably won‚Äôt debate because he will ramble incoherently, he can rarely remember where he is. He tells people they aren‚Äôt black if they don‚Äôt vote for him. Oh and let‚Äôs not forget dementia
I'm baffled by it. He's the reason TX is a possibility for Biden, I certainly wouldn't snub him on this.  Indeed, #LetBetoSpeak!
I bet Joe Biden knows the 1918 pandemic didn't end World War II.
...investagations than Hillary Clinton ever did. And finally, how many charges of Biden harassing women or children as compared to Trumps 40+ accusations? One of which was the rape of a 13 year old girl.
Green is good but not this time. Please don't throw away your vote. We need it. It is wasteful. Vote for Biden and your vote will be repurposed, not floating in the ocean like plastic.
He lost because every person between him in first place and Biden in last place dropped out at basically the same time. Let‚Äôs not forget that DNC rally the troops bullshit now.
40 years of  in DC says he's not the person you're looking for. But I don't blame you for saying this. You can almost smell that VP nomination, like Biden smelling a young woman's hair.
That will still be owed when tax time comes around. I dislike both Biden and Trump but these executive orders were nothing more than a smoke show to create more hysteria amongst people who support either side blindly.
Yea every person who dropped out was ahead of Biden and behind Bernie. Think about that for a minute. Why would everyone drop out except the person who was losing the most?
Flabbergasted! Twilight Zone!  is lying ‚ÄúBAHAHAHA‚Äù BUT the BIGGER news here isn‚Äôt Biden lying; we are use to that; it‚Äôs the Media!!!! This is HOW it‚Äôs supposed to be you know them telling the truth NOT covering it up! Oh the good old days when the Media was informative!
Yes, because you said the only difference between Biden and Trump is that Biden will have more support when doing fascism and genocide and that is absurd
This is insane. I spent dozens of hours texting and calling and campaigning for Bernie. And I hate Biden on a real level. But if you think Biden will be more authoritarian than Trump (since even the protofascist hasn't illegalized having opinions and being poor) you're just wrong
The Senate is America‚Äôs Most Structurally Racist Institution
When Biden occasionally misspeaks, I remind myself that he knows the real answer, and truly just misspoke. When Trump misspeaks, I remind myself that he also knows the real.....er, that he knows WWII ended 27 yrs after...um, that....oh, hell, never mind.
I will crawl through broken glass to vote for Biden and his running mate.
He is such an ignorant man. The 1918 pandemic (NOT 1917) was over before World War II even began. And he wants to try to paint Biden as cognitively impaired. I don't think that will go well.
Not sure who appears more indecisive right now: Joe Biden on his VP pick, or the NCAA on the fate of college football this fall. #CollegeFootball #Election2020
SMH ... this is a lie; just more BS to try to make people dislike him more than they already do; you are the Media stop being the Lefts puppet and report real news &amp; maybe instead of this report how lies are spreading more than Biden being confused or sex trafficking! REAL NEWS!
Sorry but we are already in a Nazi Germany with trump in office!! Are you kidding me!!!? Where do u people get this shit? He's ignored constitution and done what he's wanted. No checks on him! We are in hell right now! Biden will save us and most Americans believe this!!!
The Mooch is out peddling his Nevertrump BS on fox tonight looking for more time in the spotlight says he is supporting Biden and can‚Äôt give a good answer to one question what a idiot
Go back in your basement Biden!You fucking slug!
If Biden was caught snorting coke from a pirate‚Äôs wooden leg, I‚Äôd still vote for him
When Biden violates it he just forgets what the constitution is exactly

Do people not remember all the Joe Biden/Obama memes? #obama #Biden2020 #Biden #Trump #Trump2020 #memesdaily
I think you‚Äôre being too kind here Ari.  Biden has a dehumanized way of conceptualizing the entire black community, and then he projects his thinking onto what he feels they should be feeling - just like a slave owner would do. That‚Äôs racism.
The coronavirus has succeeded in killing off a grand American tradition ‚Äî the political convention.
Wouldn‚Äôt be even the slightest bit surprised if at some point before the election Biden tried speaking jive in an interview
Joe Biden is An Unrepentant RACIST And He Gets A Free Pass From The Left  via

If you‚Äôre voting for Biden because he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot Trump‚Äù but won‚Äôt give a third party a try by that same logic, I don‚Äôt want to hear your political ‚Äúopinions‚Äù.
I'm aware of the DNC platform, I was speaking to the competence and honestly of Joe Biden. He'll say whatever is expedient, imo. But that's up to each person to decide. Best of luck.
Can you share what it is that you think Biden is going to do other than not being Trump and getting more favorable media coverage? Honest question, because I don't see any positive change or outcome with Biden.
Didn't assume you were. I'm registered independent personally. I see what's going on, but there is an insidious Marxism movement that's capitalizing on the shit show that is Trump, and Biden has never been more than a grifter for sale to the highest bidder. I don't trust him.
45 can't find another way to attack Biden so he will attack Harris

I will vote him, I have to vote him, because I need him to be my Prisdent ! I trust him and Pence! Not Joe Biden.
I am not, so I am not going to vote Biden
Nobody. She'll keep her Biden puppet so he can take the blame.
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
I don't agree that the vote is futile. But even if it is, I cannot in good conscience vote for Trump or Biden. Therefore if there is any chance my voice has an impact, I must vote for Jo. That and I'm Libertarian at and those twats can't tell me what to do lol
So let me get this straight.... it‚Äôs completely fine for Obama and Biden to call criminals ‚Äúthugs‚Äù but when Trump calls them thugs he‚Äôs a racist? Got itüëçüèª

Today is the day that i mute Kamala Biden and anything political because y‚Äôall‚Äôs ignorance is something I don‚Äôt need on my TL right now.

Republicrat clones all say the same thing, in mirror form. A vote for [insert name] is either actually a vote for Trump or for Biden, depending on which side is telling the lie. A vote I can stand behind without shame is the only vote I will cast.
The problem with that is neither Trump nor Biden can consistently form cohesive thoughts without a prompter, and possibly a cattle prod to keep them on script lol. Neither side wants her on that stage.
There's plenty of desire to change the two party system. They've simply insulated themselves and protected their position by controlling things like poll inclusion and debate access. Putting Biden the Braindead in place of Trump the Orange gets us nowhere. When do we say NO MORE?
Wow. Really? Bye, Felicia. You must have the same mental conditions as Trump and Biden...

Joe Biden is 77....... bruh why the fuck are we allowing this?! Lmaoooooo oh fuck we are FUCKED...
Maybe Biden can take my dog with him
Finally was able to watch your show ladies and as usual, was great. It's funny how the Socialist Dems will change their tunes when it fits their needs. Obama said Hillary wasn't fit to run her own house let alone the W.H. &amp; Kamala says  Biden is a racist yet they team up.ü§î
First Black Democrat Woman Vice Presidential Candidate... "Karma L.A. Harrass" What's in a name? Bad Karma by any other name is still Bad Karma. Joe Biden picked a VP who accused him of Racism &amp; Sexism: who slept her way to the top &amp; jailed 15,000 Blacks for minor drug charges?

If you‚Äôre looking at things as a matter of expectations versus what they showed us during the campaign, we really did get the two least impressive democratic candidates between Biden and Kamala, that‚Äôs just a fact. Luckily, Biden is still gonna slap the shit outta Trump

Lolz a friendly bet.   Let's say if trump wins you spend and entire week wearing a maga hate.   And   If biden wins I'll do the same but with a biden hat.
Now if you are so confident in biden winning come November.  Would you like to make a friendly wager?
Ironic given McGovern attacked Jackson's opposition to busing in the 72 primary, as Harris did to Biden 48 years later.
I‚Äôm afraid that even more people of color will be incarcerated under you and Biden. I do not support Trump but your record is alarming.
MSNBC RAINS on Biden‚Äôs Parade After Picking Kamala Harris as his VP  via  #HeadboardHarris #KamalaHarrisIsJustNotLikable
Let me get this out of the way. I am NOT a DEMOCRAT. Now, what Biden said doesn't bother me in the least. Nice try though. I am STILL voting for him because ANYONE is better than TRUMP
Biden has to deliver a black woman on the Supreme Court,that's what he actually said he would do.He said that he would only pick a woman VP black or white.I say he should nominate Loretta Lynch for the Supreme Court.
Agreed, but assuming Biden wins, kamala will have a bigger shot in 2024
So are you that confident in biden, that you would like to make a friendly wager then?
You actually think Biden can do better üòÇ Moving on....

6. Rahm sees wave of "Biden Republicans"  #axiosam
Well I believe that neoliberalism, which Joe Biden is a full-throated component of, is just as much evil, maybe even more so than Trump himself. That part I'd argue. But Joe Biden is far from a benevolent choice in this race. He's just not Trump. Nothing more
It'd be nice to hear this from Joe Biden's mouth
'The Ingraham Angle' exposes Kamala Harris' 'radical' views  via  #NotAModerate  She apparently didn't think much of #Biden at the time.  She changes her beliefs depending on the occasion. Accused him of sexual assault, now she's just fine with him.
#Biden will be the first presidential candidate to ever spend his whole campaign in his basement and refusing to answer off the cuff reporters' questions.  Is this some kind of new strategy to lose?
Duck Hannity and trump! We will vote trump out and his republicans cronies ! Vote biden and Harris 2020!
Do you really believe Biden/Harris are every bit as racist, corrupt, narcissistic, sexist, dishonest, delusional, anti-scientific, authoritarian, theocratic, and venal as Trump?  No?   Then your choice is clear.
Oh, sure, if Biden wins, we "will maybe never know who won," but if you win (God forbid), *then* how much will you contest the results?

In fact, they polled 1,105 citizens in each of the 7 cities of Hampton Roads. More than 90% who said they voted for Clinton in 2016 said that they would vote for Biden in 2020. 80.2% who said they voted for Trump in 2016 said that they planned to vote for him in 2020. #13NewsNow
you going to ask Biden about lying all the time or nah?
I‚Äôd love to talk to the people in charge of Biden‚Äôs Twitter...or the guy who controls his eyes.
Biden announced MONTHS ago his pick would be a woman of color. Because the Dems pander for the minority vote. She was not picked for her qualifications, experience, or accomplishments. She was chosen because of gender and color. btw, look up the definition of racism and misogyny.

You're pardoned.  My opinion is that I don't reward the Democratic party because they were good enough to cheat in a primary.  Biden has done zero to earn my vote.  Trump could never get my vote.  Biden but has to ask...
Your party is going up in flames because your only enthused voters want to defund cops, so you pick the two people most responsible for jailing black men.  You're going to be a breeze to beat.  Clearly, no good candidates wanted to run with Biden because your party went nuts.

It just shows that Biden is working harder than you trump
Telling us we do have to vote for Biden in a safe blue state just feels like ‚Äúget in line because we say so‚Äù, and that‚Äôs not how you get none voters to vote. If you want votes, you have to earn them, by pushing what people want, not just shouting against what they don‚Äôt want
But for the love of god, don‚Äôt tell people who don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden because of his very real political flaws that they MUST vote for him in a state he‚Äôs going to win anyway, NYs electoral votes aren‚Äôt on the line here, everyone knows this. We don‚Äôt have to vote for him
Patronizingly telling ‚ÄúBernie Bros‚Äù they need to vote for Biden isn‚Äôt going to get you that surge, it‚Äôs just turning those people off to voting at all. Tell them about the down ballot races with candidates they can get excited about.

Instead of trying to convince ‚ÄúBernie Bros‚Äù to vote for Biden in a state that is a lock to vote for Biden, maybe try to convince them to turn out for down ballet raises for candidates that actually listen to their constituents instead of belittling them for having principles.
Then you know how disheartening it is to fight for things you truly believe in, have the people who could help implement them spit in your face, and then be told you need to vote for them anyway. Votes are earned. We live in NY, it‚Äôs not like Biden isn‚Äôt gonna win this state
Hyden with Biden!üòÇüòÇ
Hundreds of thousands of black people went to and still sit in jail because of Biden. How many of them died in prison because they couldn't get good medical care, all because a racist like joe biden was given the ability to write laws
I‚Äôm not a political person at all but from my understanding you and so many others are going to split the vote not voting for Biden and choosing Bernie or othe me candidtates with low chances of winning And it could result in Trump winning ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Lets say you are right. Why is it a bad thing to avoid mail in ballots? There is fraud, interference and lost ballots. Why risk an entire election when we can do it the way it‚Äôs always worked. People act so confident in Biden‚Äôs ability to win yet want to open us up to that.

Dr. Biden, absolutely!!  The Biden and Harris team is  Win-Win team!
Seriously tho. Some can't vote for the lesser of two evils. Most don't even know the policies these people have or their history, yet they're expected to vote?  I mean, im voting but I understand why other niggas won't vote. What Biden gonna do for the hood? PUT MORE BLACKS AWAY?
No they're only options. And only a house nigga would even contemplate voting for a racist like Biden.

You could have made that argument for any previous presidential race. So why didn't you? Everyone knows the real answer and the real reason why you don't want Biden debating Trump.
Every time you talk about skipping presidential debates your lame excuses don't hold water. You simply realize that Biden is mentally incapable of debating not only Trump but just about anybody. Truly sad.

Strong words from Harris: "He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden; And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
You are correct, Biden isn‚Äôt an ally.  That‚Äôs really not my point.  I think the economic harm that Trump has created will exacerbate existing problems inside communities of color.  It‚Äôs like smoking, every minute trump is in office shifts the 2053 problem closer to 2020.

It is possible to be happy about a Biden/Harris ticket and still recognize that their track record on criminal justice policy and reform is less than stellar. The reality of the moment is that the alternative to them is... what we have now.
Hell no! We want 3 debates between Trump and Biden. The feeble old fool needs to be seen as what he is: a feeble old fool with dementia.  The last thing we need in the White House is a demented Democrat!
Watching the network pool feed of the Biden/Harris event - and the music playing.... is quite funky.
hey Steve can you please speak to these black folk about dragging  Kamala Harris, we need to rally together and support the Biden/Harris ticket. Please!

I guarantee, if Biden wins (and that's a big if) Bernie will be the first to call him out on every horrible stance and policy. But for 3+ years they vilified progressives bc they hated him for daring to oppose "Her," and it cost progressive candidates. So he's playing along.
How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: Inside the history-making VP pick
Bad take. Bernie knows Biden/Harris aren't the answer, but he also knows Dems spent 3+ years scapegoating progressives bc they were pissed at him. So he's not giving them that chance this time. We got the squad in south of their scapegoating. Imagine how many we can elect now.

All of y‚Äôall dragging her.... Who did y‚Äôall expect her to support/vote for? Trump or Kanye? ü§® Biden is our only bit of saving grace weather you like him or not ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚úåüèª
You all so busy arguing about Biden them with the green castle. #gotime
Pro Life / Pro Legal immigration / pro  economy / pro military / wont sell out to China for his kids bank account ( easy decision for me ).  Done more to help the country in 3 years than Biden has in 40 years of politics. T/P
That is beneath you. I know you are a never-Trumper, but the American people deserve to see the interchange between Biden &amp; Trump and may the best man win. #Trump2020

Joe Biden chooses Kamala Harris as vice presidential running mate  via
A vote is a vote...    This really shows how much people see the Biden/Harris duo as a winning ticket.
Okay I can say it, I'll be voting for  Her disgust for Biden's history of racism is what was the deciding factor to come out behind her
All those things will be lost if Biden is elected
Joe Biden is an idiot with a brain the size of a grain of sand
At the start of the democratic primary, I donated to Biden &amp; Harris...     So, I just doubled my normal weekly donation to the Biden/Harris campaign.
I wonder how history will look at Joe Biden if elected president,because he will be part of the two most historic presidential tickets ever.Will he be known for the 94 crime bill more or making history twice.
Still not voting Biden
I can‚Äôt wait for the KHive to use all your powers to focus on getting President Biden &amp; Madam VP Harris elected in November.
Technically that‚Äôs not true, her mother is Indian ( from India) and her father is Jamaican ( from Jamaica). Considering the Jamaicans I know don‚Äôt consider themselves as Black, she isn‚Äôt Black either. So in reality Biden‚Äôs running mate is passing for Black.
I‚Äôm gonna vote for Biden/Harris so fucking hard omg
Actual footage of me realizing Biden was going to be the nominee.
Yes we do. That‚Äôs why Biden picked her. She‚Äôs intelligent and she is a beast when it comes to debates. She will drag your ass and do what‚Äôs necessary to win. üòé
Joe Biden should NOT opt for a black female as his pick for VP. Blacks make up 13% of the US population &amp; the growth rate plummeting , Hispanics make up 19% of the population &amp; the growth rate is skyrocketing. Hispanics, NOT blacks, are the future of America. #Election2020
She's blown a lot of things, but Biden's chances weren't one of them, they were blown a long time ago
Damn not even waiting for Joe Biden to be elected to pretend to start caring about the debt and deficits.
Bro this nigga Biden got me tight as fuck. Bout to vote for myself. Me for President 2020 cus I‚Äôm sick of the bozos
What's the best realistic Biden/Harris campaign solgan?
Wager on Biden?
Not sure which was a bigger overreaction to Cardi and Megan: Ben Shapiro coming out about his inability to arouse a woman or Joe Biden picking a Whole Ass Prosecutor to be his VP
You should vote. I won't say vote Biden. I loathe Biden myself. But I will also admit to planning to vote for him. Trump is a threat, has been a threat. We are swiftly hitting *open* fascism. He has to go. I'll take that bullet to the knee instead of the chest.
Madame VP let‚Äôs do this y‚Äôall. Get out there and VOTE!!! GO Biden power moveüëèüèΩ
Biden picking Kamala pretty much sealed the election.
They don't think Biden will last a term. And Bernie doesn't actually think Biden can win; he'd have turned down the offer to stay in the Senate rather than be on a losing ticket.
I genuinely respect you and your opinions generally line up with my own, but look at bit more into her. She's more or less another DINO like Biden. We need some real, leftist changes to happen. Though at least she'll probably get Biden a few more votes
Focusing on the forest, would be flipping the Senate. But putting Biden up against Trump - 2 dementia patients with sexual assault allegations who don't give a damn about PoC - and making his running mate one of the worst AGs CA ever had, that's just fueling the forest fire.
Biden was not my 1st choice for president &amp; Kamala not my 1st for VP. That said they‚Äôll be exponentially better than the dangerous psychopath in office now. I‚Äôll be more than happy to vote for them deal with any shortcomings later.
You have to remember, Joe Biden was nothing more than an olive branch to people who may have needed to be a little more palatable to vote for a black man for president. He was a conservative Democrat. I wouldn't go calling him a progressive hero out loud
Kamala Harris 'honored' to be Joe Biden's VP pick
I don't know if I've ever been more hopeful for my people than seeing the dedication from ADOS standing on not voting for Biden without tangibles....
Can't believe Joe Biden picked Maya Rudolph for VP!
Polls MAY say and show Biden is leading but remember there are hundreds or maybe thousands of people who sat out last time, those non voters WILL make the difference, spread the word towards anyone who is still considering not voting.
All women should be outraged at Trump‚Äôs response to Biden‚Äôs pick of a woman. Come to think about it, all men should be outraged at Trump‚Äôs response.
Meanwhile, Democratic politicians- Such as Sen.  and Rep.  - have shared congratulatory messages over Biden‚Äôs pick.
HISTORIC VP CHOICE: Joe Biden has picked Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate. She is the first woman of color ever on a major party's presidential ticket. Harris has represented California in the U.S. Senate since 2017, after serving as AG of California and DA of San Francisco
With Kamala Harris comes a lot of controversy, did Joe Biden make the correct decision? Pass it on.
Y‚Äôall can be mad, just vote for Biden. Thanks.
Voting Trump out and voting for Biden are 2 totally different things...

At least Elizabeth Warren finds out what happens when you betray your values for a boon; if she backed bernie instead of Biden she probably would've had a better chance of getting that vp pick she wanted so bad she sold out to a DINO.
Wondering why people are tweeting about Biden making such a great choice of #KamalaHarris for VP. Do they really think #Biden had anything to do with it? They hate each other. Progressive left won, she was their choice. Bye, bye Democratic party.
it was hard enough voting for biden but now they're just being cruel
i'd be more worried about Biden &amp; the Ukraine
True all true, and this move might have just lost the election for Biden. Trump is enough of an asshole to call Kamala Harris a sellout and he will be right, Obama ruined that "I'm voting for the black person because they're black" energy
Best choice Biden Harris
Okay, let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs true. At this point it‚Äôs too late, but continuing to bring this up reduces Biden‚Äôs chance by pushing people away from him as a candidate.
Biden Harris yes they have my vote
So let me get this straight, in the debates Kamala Harris basically called Joe Biden a segregationist but now you accept being his VP, you can't make this up if you tried
Trump or no Trump, I'd still be pleased with a Biden / Harris ticket. I mean, if ever a last name was a mark of quality...
Yes I‚Äôm so grateful I love kamala Harris I‚Äôm voting Biden Harris Yessss

Leave it to Biden to pick the worse possible choice for his running mate.
I have been waiting for anyone to provide real proof of this trump talking point and so far no one has. Makes a person think it‚Äôs faked for the purpose of pulling votes away from Biden.
#2020Elections I‚Äôm so excited that Biden chose Harris! I‚Äôll pay money to see her debate Pence! Even if I watch in my own living room. She‚Äôll decimate him in 25 words or less.
The entire Biden/Harris ticket has pig dick breath all over it.
Harris wasn‚Äôt my first pick but it is an excellent choice. She will energize women &amp; minorities to rally around the ticket, Biden‚Äôs age will be less of a liability with a much younger VP, and her vacated seat in the Senate will easily be filled by a Democrat. #BidenHarris2020
As a teacher I‚Äôm happy to vote for Biden/Harris

Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs VP pick.You know why they cleared the room so quickly. Even if you won't admit it. His team is terrified of what nonsense will come out of Biden's mouth if he has to answer a question off the top of his head.
Joe Biden is 77....... bruh why the fuck are we allowing this?! Lmaoooooo oh fuck we are FUCKED...
The Dem leadership needs to insist that there will be no further COVID legislation passed in Congress unless the USPS funding and operations are restored. Also Biden/Harris should demand that No fix=No presidential debate.
Maybe Biden can take my dog with him
Finally was able to watch your show ladies and as usual, was great. It's funny how the Socialist Dems will change their tunes when it fits their needs. Obama said Hillary wasn't fit to run her own house let alone the W.H. &amp; Kamala says  Biden is a racist yet they team up.ü§î
President Joe Biden. Inmate Donald Trump. Pass it on.
First Black Democrat Woman Vice Presidential Candidate... "Karma L.A. Harrass" What's in a name? Bad Karma by any other name is still Bad Karma. Joe Biden picked a VP who accused him of Racism &amp; Sexism: who slept her way to the top &amp; jailed 15,000 Blacks for minor drug charges?

If you‚Äôre looking at things as a matter of expectations versus what they showed us during the campaign, we really did get the two least impressive democratic candidates between Biden and Kamala, that‚Äôs just a fact. Luckily, Biden is still gonna slap the shit outta Trump

Lolz a friendly bet.   Let's say if trump wins you spend and entire week wearing a maga hate.   And   If biden wins I'll do the same but with a biden hat.
One of the primary obstacles to peaceful integration: Biden and his compatriots. Rather than accepting that it was the right thing to do, benefits all, and allows for complete integration, it has been divisive ever since 1964. NOTHING FORCED IS PEACEFUL.
Now if you are so confident in biden winning come November.  Would you like to make a friendly wager?
Ironic given McGovern attacked Jackson's opposition to busing in the 72 primary, as Harris did to Biden 48 years later.
I‚Äôm afraid that even more people of color will be incarcerated under you and Biden. I do not support Trump but your record is alarming.
Sounds like you summed up Biden and Harris pretty well.

Biden has to deliver a black woman on the Supreme Court,that's what he actually said he would do.He said that he would only pick a woman VP black or white.I say he should nominate Loretta Lynch for the Supreme Court.
Agreed, but assuming Biden wins, kamala will have a bigger shot in 2024

6. Rahm sees wave of "Biden Republicans"  #axiosam
Well I believe that neoliberalism, which Joe Biden is a full-throated component of, is just as much evil, maybe even more so than Trump himself. That part I'd argue. But Joe Biden is far from a benevolent choice in this race. He's just not Trump. Nothing more
But stop blaming the voters. Y‚Äôall blame the voters every election. Blame the DNC, they elected exactly who you didn‚Äôt want. You honestly think Biden is going to win? You‚Äôre deluded.
It'd be nice to hear this from Joe Biden's mouth
'The Ingraham Angle' exposes Kamala Harris' 'radical' views  via  #NotAModerate  She apparently didn't think much of #Biden at the time.  She changes her beliefs depending on the occasion. Accused him of sexual assault, now she's just fine with him.
#Biden will be the first presidential candidate to ever spend his whole campaign in his basement and refusing to answer off the cuff reporters' questions.  Is this some kind of new strategy to lose?

Oh, sure, if Biden wins, we "will maybe never know who won," but if you win (God forbid), *then* how much will you contest the results?

The pot calling the kettle black. Biden sexually assaulted women and children while in the position of VP of the US. Where are the majority of women who "claim" bad things against Trump?
I am still waiting for Biden/Harris to ask for my vote...
Where is #Biden?  Is he even campaigning at all?  Or does he really count his entire bid on Trump haters?
This is the funniest thing I heard all week.   That's not why Joe Biden is avoiding the media. He is senile.  Just wait for the debates.  And I will expect an apology from you.
ODU poll says Trump trailing Biden by double digits in Hampton Roads
Appreciate the transcript. Vausch seems naive as hell. He overestimated the Dems "monopoly on leftism," underestimated how many leftists hate Pelosi/Obama/Clinton, conceded that Biden wouldn't do shit to fix anything, and somehow concluded a magically progressive  future DNC? Wtf
It's not really a fair discussion. If you don't fall in line with Biden, you get the "progressives don't vote so why should we cater to you." And if you do fall in line with Biden, they know they never have to do shit to get your vote for free. Don't fight impossible battles.
Get a gripe on reality.  No brain Biden will not save you.

In fact, they polled 1,105 citizens in each of the 7 cities of Hampton Roads. More than 90% who said they voted for Clinton in 2016 said that they would vote for Biden in 2020. 80.2% who said they voted for Trump in 2016 said that they planned to vote for him in 2020. #13NewsNow

I‚Äôd love to talk to the people in charge of Biden‚Äôs Twitter...or the guy who controls his eyes.
Biden announced MONTHS ago his pick would be a woman of color. Because the Dems pander for the minority vote. She was not picked for her qualifications, experience, or accomplishments. She was chosen because of gender and color. btw, look up the definition of racism and misogyny.

There were no stronger '16 Dem candidates than Hillary just like there are no stronger '20 Dem candidates today (outside of Michelle Obama) than Biden.  And Trump won one, and could likely win the subsequent election.  So I don't think that is quite good enough.

I don‚Äôt know man. All I know is that Democrats are trying everything in their power to make him win. I‚Äôll never vote for Biden and Harris. Not gonna happen.  I don‚Äôt like Trump but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt vote for either party.
Biden-harris kt's about 2 happen Jan 21 ...oh yeah!!!
Why would we look at biden to see how much of his mind is left ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Yeah because Joe Biden knows how to save us all!  It‚Äôs wearing a mask alone in my yard!  For the next 3 months only tho, because after the election - that will no longer be needed.
A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump!  A vote for Biden is a vote for Biden!  A vote for a third party candidate is *drumrolls* ..... A vote for a third party candidate.    Y‚Äôall killing me with this whole a vote for one candidate is really a vote for another nonsense. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

On Thursday, after Harris was selected by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to serve as his running mate, President Donald Trump elevated the conspiracy while speaking to reporters from the White House podium.
If the country hasn't yet collapsed under Trump (and, yes, I realize there's still time), I'm not even *remotely* concerned about it happening under Biden.

Fox News is Wilson over Kamala Harris being Biden‚Äôs VP candidate.
The Obama Administration put these protections in place nationwide &amp; Betsy tore them up. Biden will put them back in January.

You're pardoned.  My opinion is that I don't reward the Democratic party because they were good enough to cheat in a primary.  Biden has done zero to earn my vote.  Trump could never get my vote.  Biden but has to ask...
Your party is going up in flames because your only enthused voters want to defund cops, so you pick the two people most responsible for jailing black men.  You're going to be a breeze to beat.  Clearly, no good candidates wanted to run with Biden because your party went nuts.
This is going to be easy to beat:

It just shows that Biden is working harder than you trump
Telling us we do have to vote for Biden in a safe blue state just feels like ‚Äúget in line because we say so‚Äù, and that‚Äôs not how you get none voters to vote. If you want votes, you have to earn them, by pushing what people want, not just shouting against what they don‚Äôt want
But for the love of god, don‚Äôt tell people who don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden because of his very real political flaws that they MUST vote for him in a state he‚Äôs going to win anyway, NYs electoral votes aren‚Äôt on the line here, everyone knows this. We don‚Äôt have to vote for him
Patronizingly telling ‚ÄúBernie Bros‚Äù they need to vote for Biden isn‚Äôt going to get you that surge, it‚Äôs just turning those people off to voting at all. Tell them about the down ballot races with candidates they can get excited about.

Then you know how disheartening it is to fight for things you truly believe in, have the people who could help implement them spit in your face, and then be told you need to vote for them anyway. Votes are earned. We live in NY, it‚Äôs not like Biden isn‚Äôt gonna win this state

Hundreds of thousands of black people went to and still sit in jail because of Biden. How many of them died in prison because they couldn't get good medical care, all because a racist like joe biden was given the ability to write laws
I‚Äôm not a political person at all but from my understanding you and so many others are going to split the vote not voting for Biden and choosing Bernie or othe me candidtates with low chances of winning And it could result in Trump winning ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Lets say you are right. Why is it a bad thing to avoid mail in ballots? There is fraud, interference and lost ballots. Why risk an entire election when we can do it the way it‚Äôs always worked. People act so confident in Biden‚Äôs ability to win yet want to open us up to that.

You could have made that argument for any previous presidential race. So why didn't you? Everyone knows the real answer and the real reason why you don't want Biden debating Trump.
Every time you talk about skipping presidential debates your lame excuses don't hold water. You simply realize that Biden is mentally incapable of debating not only Trump but just about anybody. Truly sad.

Are Dems going to be mad Biden didn't pick an African American?  And  is a descendant of a slave owner?
Kamala for sure would have been on Biden's short list regardless of committing to pick a woman and regardless of BLM protests. So I'm not saying she was picked because of tokenism, I'm just saying I don't believe she's the candidate most black people feel "represents" them.
thank you for your comments on MSNBC, very well spoken. Such encouragement that things will and can get better with a Biden/Harris ticket.
Your Wednesday funny. Including this: "Climb upon Geraldine Ferraro's and my shoulders, and from the most amazing view in your life consider lessons we learned."   Bahahahahaha. I picture Team Biden/Harris getting a good chuckle out of this one.

Good morning Ms. Harris, how are you doing? Congrats for being name Biden`s running mate and I hope you will do well. I look forward to voting for you both and many blessings to you and your family
If you vote Joe Biden you pretty much support a Pedo.
It's a weird situation because because Kamala would have been on Biden's short list even before committing to pick a woman and  before George Floyd, and those same headlines would show up.  But it just feels like so much more cynical now.

Not sure what that fake headline has to do with Biden, but we know the answer to the question is NO. Trump and you worthless-stains-on-humanity trumpists have shown that intelligence and "brains" aren't a prerequisite.

I guarantee, if Biden wins (and that's a big if) Bernie will be the first to call him out on every horrible stance and policy. But for 3+ years they vilified progressives bc they hated him for daring to oppose "Her," and it cost progressive candidates. So he's playing along.
How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: Inside the history-making VP pick
Bad take. Bernie knows Biden/Harris aren't the answer, but he also knows Dems spent 3+ years scapegoating progressives bc they were pissed at him. So he's not giving them that chance this time. We got the squad in south of their scapegoating. Imagine how many we can elect now.

So I personally see why Biden picked up they both feel the same about "blacks" Lock they asses up &amp; never free em Never change Jim Crow/slave codes of 1706 (cuz none of the 13 colonies got rid of them just change the name &amp; date) hence why we feel like we goin backwards to 1960

Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris As His Running Mate
It is factual and true, sure, but it is also factual that more turnout typically leads to Democrat wins. Not voting means you can‚Äôt criticize the winner - if Trump wins, not voting helped gived him that win if you would have voted Blue given Biden wasn‚Äôt the candidate. u rite tho
Biden doesn‚Äôt hold grudges.
Here's the deal with Joe Biden. This was a bad pick. But it could have been much worse.  As someone who hoped for Bernie, settled for Warren VP, and is now stuck with Biden/Harris, I'm trying to find optimism. A black female VP is a step in the right direction.
Ladies of #Theview! Liberty has become privilege. And privilege? It is characterized by #DonaldTrump. But also ladies by #BarackObama who has been rewarded for appeasing the HeritageSociety, the Pentagon and the Intelligence "Community." Now we have Zero NationalHealthCare #Biden

Good job Joe Biden.
I think the correct guess is that Biden didn't choose anybody. He was told.
Trump has no agenda; never has except Not Obama. Biden should present a forward thinking plan for all of the US. He should roll out a cabinet nominee every few days, ending with the VP. Each member should stand for and talk about a policy direction.

Joe Biden tells us how important his faith is to him -- so important that he lives in a way that is the total opposite of the faith he professes. Come on, Joe. Hypocrisy is ugly! If your faith is the "bedrock" of your life prove it by your actions. Repudiate abortion and sodomy.

It's not really a fair discussion. If you don't fall in line with Biden, you get the "progressives don't vote so why should we cater to you." And if you do fall in line with Biden, they know they never have to do shit to get your vote for free. Don't fight impossible battles.

Well said Eileen, the more trump complains about someone the more fears them. Biden/Harris has him terrified so he does the only thing he can to try &amp; put someone down. That fool doesn't understand this won't work this time. Over the last 4 years he has proven his incompetence..

We riding with Kamala no matter what We protecting Kamala by all means necessary  We voting for the Biden/Harris ticket like we did in 2012 We tired of the white house smelling like Smithfield packing everytime it rain outside,
Never Trumpers like myself, need not vote for Biden to stop Trump, just read the Constitution and block both Biden and Trump from achieving 270 Electoral votes and there could be a Biden-Pence admi nistration!
There were no stronger '16 Dem candidates than Hillary just like there are no stronger '20 Dem candidates today (outside of Michelle Obama) than Biden.  And Trump won one, and could likely win the subsequent election.  So I don't think that is quite good enough.
Hogan better pray Kamala and the NY D.A don't come together under Biden's A G and make public any and everything illegal this administration done. Keep in mind trump's already looked at for crimes with Micheal Cohen as well as misuse of nonprofit funds with his kid Open&amp;shut case
None of this matters until we replace King Trump with President Biden.  King Trump does not obey United States laws.
You can be as loud and as opposed to the things you want after Biden wins. Push them. Call them out. All of that is righteous.  Standing by and letting Trump become the next permanent president is way more immoral than compromising now to fight later.
There is no evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. There is no basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election.

l'm happy to see you agree Stephen. Joe Biden will bring us together &amp; work towards healing the country
Independents are especially unimpressed with Kamala Harris.

And we all wonder- why post something obviously racist, if it doesn‚Äôt reflect ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs in your heart‚Äù?  Just admit you‚Äôre an old racist white man‚Äî we all know your truth now! Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'
Nader didn't put a gun to Al Gore's head and make him blow it, nor did he design the Florida butterfly ballot, nor did he give SCOTUS room to just shrug at the whole situation.  The Pied Pipers are the ones who said "the era of big government is over" and are forcing Biden on us.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Every single criticism of Biden and Harris represents an action I expect you to take daily after the election. #vote
I thought his mask mandate did involve governors making the decision. ‚ÄúEvery governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing. The estimates by the experts are that it will save over 40,000 lives in the next three months. Forty thousand lives, if people act responsibly.‚Äù -Joe Biden

On Thursday, after Harris was selected by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to serve as his running mate, President Donald Trump elevated the conspiracy while speaking to reporters from the White House podium.
If Biden wins, mark my words, they WILL be coming for them. #VoteRed
#FailedPresident took a thriving economy (thank you President Obama and VP Biden) and drove it into the ground. We now have the #TrumpDepression along with the #TrumpVirus. 5.2 million Americans infected and +167,000 Americans dead since February.

Biden &amp; Harris need to host daily demonstrations at the Washington Monument or on the Mall in DC EVERY DAY until the USPS is funded and protected by #Congress, and the postmaster general fraudster is impeached. Voting rights are the whole campaign!
You got that right! Now they are saying Kamala Harris isnt African American... THEY ARE THROWING EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK AT BIDEN/HARRIS! #PanicInDC
This is great! Biden supporters can‚Äôt handle the truth! Instead, they try to get me banned! Proud to be 100% problematic for Democrats!! I‚Äôm just getting started!

LOL... Biden better hire a food taster pronto. They need to check every can of Ensure and cup of apple sauce he gets.
I‚Äôm sure I could find a hat for Biden made in China. China is eating this stuff up. I purchase all of my material from  Everything is made in the USA. I as well as millions choose to purchase made in America. One thing we can all agree on.
I use these quotes every time someone in a red hat posts something about Biden‚Äôs mental acuity.

Tbh I don't plan on shaming any trump voters into voting for Biden  Running a campaign on not being trump is fucking stupid, they did that already and it failed  It's pretty clear the  doesn't wanna move us forward  If  wants to win he needs to earn it
Im waiting on yalls alternative since ya dont wanna vote but you hate Trump but you‚Äôll go to the ends to explain why Biden/Harris dont need to be elected. just get Trump out, can we start there ?
She responded to my tweet, I asked the person who tweeted the original one she responded to ‚Äúso it‚Äôs gonna lay on the shoulders of all women? No way‚Äù i deleted my tweet because I didn‚Äôt feel like dealing with the guy who said what he said about ALL women voting for Biden.
Focus on what #45 should be talking about to attack this country‚Äôs problems, NOT on why #45 attacks on Senator Harris are not sticking...why major in the minor, his attacks on the Biden/Harris team, won‚Äôt solve our problems..MAKE him address the issues!
Shenanigan translation...... Karen will vote for me because I will keep people who use seasonings and know raisins don't belong in potato salad away from her husband....male and female....Biden will make them have to bring up their game...and be nice..and not racist.

We do not have to vote for Joe Biden to stop Donald Trump.
I doubt he treats trump supporters like they have no brain. That would be Biden supporters. It really doesn‚Äôt take rocket science.
I have come to the conclusion that there is no help for Biden, his administration, or his followers! They say the most ignorant stuff and want to vote for someone who has NO policies! SMH.
Also.. A LOT has been thrown at this man &amp; he has diligently given above &amp; beyond to every single hurdle &amp; STILL has numerous record breaking economic positive values. He‚Äôs made 1000 moves before Biden can get his sentence out. Like him or not, he runs the hell out of The USA.
Biden had asthma from childhood. Trumps daddy paid for a fake diagnosis of bone spurs. And you respect trump?
You can‚Äôt comprehend what you read. ‚Äú China prefers President Trump losing the election, because Beijing considers him "unpredictable," while Russia is working to undermine Democrat Joe Biden.
Biden had asthma from childhood
But they want to talk about how Biden speaks. And Trump shouldn‚Äôt have been in speech therapy class? Look at the fleas on fluffy if you didn‚Äôt get that it‚Äôs like the pot calling the kettle black.ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èijs

Maybe, like real journalists  do, you should have looked at her info or asked her or asked Biden team before starting your racist rant
Biden once had the same friends he just can‚Äôt remember.
You can throw memes all day but I can promise Biden‚Äôs are funnier!
He has a page   please send there. So he can find them himself. Many thanks to all of you my dear friends. l feel real peace tonight now that we have the  Biden/Harris ticket. lts as if a calm has  washed over me as if to say "We will do this, together we will"
Here's the plan: post-election, invoke 25th Amendment as needed. Biden "retires" after 2 years. Then, constitutionally, the Tamil-Jamaican descendent of slaveholders can serve for up to 10 years as President.
Didn‚Äôt she have some of the lowest points of all candidates during the debates where she called out Biden as basically being racist?
Why do believe Christine and not Tara? Why do you believe a guy like Joe Biden who fondles little girls? Why do you believe Joe Biden who touches women inappropriately? Why do you believe Joe Biden when he brags about little kids touching his hairy legs?
Saw the clip where Sen Klobuchar withdrew from the race and endorsed VP Biden.  He appeared in the screen, hugged her, and you could see such emotion on his face.  An "I do want to win, but I didn't want you to lose."  Empathy...a good Dude.  We do indeed need this.
The only thing  has done for me is to have shown me how ignorant and stupid he is and how many people are just as toxic as he is. Even if you don‚Äôt like Biden/Harris how could you EVER think Trump is better?#whathasTrumpdone4ulately #TrumpKillsUSPS

It‚Äôs not the black vote that‚Äôs going to get Biden/Harris in office. It‚Äôs the Bernie/Warren stans...if they mobilize and vote. Take a play from the Republicans.
trump wants that label not us, don't give him the satisfaction. Mighty  NOT nasty. Let's try that one instead. Biden/Harris is a great ticket we can be proud of. They need our 100 % support. Sending you positive thoughts &amp; blessings to you &amp; yours. Stay safe my friend
Facts! However... they keep bringing up stuff trump supposedly did over 30 years ago so why can‚Äôt they say he has evolved?! Yet Biden does it daily and because he admits them it‚Äôs ok. Yet he has no policies that help the communities. He has NO policies. Hypocrisy!
Biden won me over from jump. He said Get Behind Ms Harris. I like that!!  They are going to have different views on the same issues and agrees to disagree right up front. I like him. He understands. #BidenHarris2020
Appointment would be made by the Democratic governor if Biden/Harris win in November. Here's a decent rundown of the possible replacements.

Agree! Before the bromance- chose  to balance the ticket. And now we know that Biden's selection of  , his own balanced ticket approach, has been a smashing success- just as  &amp; I predicted
I keep mispronouncing her name and it is accidental. I have been practicing because I will be saying it every day as I work for the Biden/Harris ticket. But when someone says something really STUPID I pronounce EVERYTHING WRONG.
Interns. Can‚Äôt you tell they sound intelligent. Can you imagine an actual Biden tweet. He would run out of letters before anything was coherent
Let‚Äôs go Team Biden/Harris....
Y‚Äôall watchin biden wit that lil smirk on his face right now lol
Watch Live: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make first appearance as running mates
Watch Live: Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era.
I hope Biden finds a spot for Khizr Khan in his cabinet.  This man is a true patriot and as a lot to offer this country.
Trump with more socialist spending.  Trump - Socialism Biden - Extreme Socialism Jorgensen - Free Market Capitalism #Jorgensen2020
This might be an outlier since so many people do not have confidence Biden will finish the full term.
Beaugh Biden
If you believe black lives matter then Jorgensen-Cohen is your ticket, not Biden-Harris.
Here‚Äôs a thought Biden has been in office for decades. The issue today have been the same for decades.  So if  hasn‚Äôt been able fix them in decades how will he fix them in 4 years? Try giving  an honest chance.  Work with him not against him.
Her and Biden are moderates, just call them that or don‚Äôt bring it up lol. It‚Äôs moving the goalpost on what is considered progressive. We can aim higher
Video shows  asking  to be vice presidential running mate
Want to join me for this Joe Biden for President event?
I can see mothers and their children being released from cages with a Biden/Harris administration. That mother's instinct won't stand by and watch it happen    I can see police prosecuted for killing unarmed black/brown people cause a mom always saying what if that was my child
The Final Lap: DID THE OBAMA- BIDEN - KERRY-  CLINTON IRAN DEAL S...
538 gives Biden 71% chance of winning. I want 100%. I don‚Äôt want Trump.
Kamala for sure would have been on Biden's short list regardless of committing to pick a woman and regardless of BLM protests. So I'm not saying she was picked because of tokenism, I'm just saying I don't believe she's the candidate most black people feel "represents" them.
Biden-Harris first joint presser at 3:50pm this afternoon.
If you vote Joe Biden you pretty much support a Pedo.
It's a weird situation because because Kamala would have been on Biden's short list even before committing to pick a woman and  before George Floyd, and those same headlines would show up.  But it just feels like so much more cynical now.
It's not Omar, nor is it Biden; it's the people that are behind them that is the threat to American's way of life.
Kamala &amp; Biden are not ideal, no. but yall would rather vote Trump again? lol ok....
The Final Lap: WHO LOVES JOE BIDEN ?
TFW you're on the Biden ticket

I don't support either lol nor have I ever voted. However its many more tangibles Biden/Harris have done to the detriment of the Black community than Trump

‚ÄúWhite women‚Äù will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where minorities would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with *insert random black politician* in charge!

Yes but that's misleading. Every President has signed a law funding HBCUs. Biden's plan  increases funding from $400 million to $70 billion.......
Keen observers point out unusual elements of Biden‚Äôs Instagram post with Harris  #FoxNews

Lmao imagine thinking Biden will do anything but nominate a conservative.
Biden says he will get rid of COVID19....simply stop reporting it and release all the restraints! BOMB! NO MORE COVID19.
How very post-modern and relativistic....
It is kind of creepy but look at Biden and look at Trump
Biden shoulda picked my baby Tulsi as his running mate smh
538 reports that Biden has 71% chance of winning. Pretty good odds.    I want it to be 100% certain that we‚Äôre getting rid of Trump. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Biden and Kamala are wack but they‚Äôre safe enough bets to convince people in the middle to vote blue. Trash but could be worse
i missed the part where she said Joe Biden kept her from going to good schools...  can someone point me to the part of the video where that happens?
Really?  You think Sen. Harris has that much positive influence to solidly swing PA to Biden?
I had to send this out to my friends ‚ô•Ô∏è in a tweeterville. The pompas ass, need I say more, has opened his pie hole again to attack the dynamic duo. Saying Kamala Harris was a nasty so and so who wanted to kick Joe Biden's teeth in. And he didn't know what sleepy Joe was thinking
How about What Joe Biden did to Tara Reade.
How about What Joe Biden did to Tara Reade.
Why does everyone call Biden a pedo when trump allegedly raped a 13 year old girl who was tied up?  Are there any alleged stories of Biden raping a kid? Let me do some research and I will get back to you
Even "Trump Haters" don't want Joe!!!!! Why I Want Biden to Lose More than I Want Trump to Win
Kamala Harris, singlehandedly, is responsible for thousands of POC being wrongfully incarcerated all over the US for nonviolent crimes (majority marijuana). If you are planning on voting Biden, how do you feel about this? Isn‚Äôt this what we‚Äôre fighting against the most?
I 100% agree. Four more years of "dictator trump" &amp; we will have a country thats unrecognizable with a democracy thats lost. Biden/Harris ticket is our chance to secure a future for our children. Restore civility when we remove the blight from  OUR W.H.  We can, we will do this!
seriously what's wrong with all the people who are like "at least BIDEN won't be doing all that TWEETING"
Biden/Harris are NOT progressive at all
Excited to hear  acceptance speech for the VP pick on the Biden ticket! #NeverGiveUp
Morning friends, we have the team that will take back the country &amp;  save our democracy Biden/Harris! We must do everything in our power to make sure they win on Nov 3rd Call your local chapter 1st time voter needs to be registered, volunteer,  help anyway you can. We can do this
Some Biden allies wage campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president  Typical debate bull crap!
I know i liked her too but they threw her out like trash and she still endorsed Biden. That tells me alot about her too. :(
Me realizing that the only way to get trump out of office is voting for Biden and Kamala üôÉ
Congratulations I‚Äôm excited to support my AKA Soror for the Vice Presidential running mate ofJoe Biden!!!üíïüíïüíï
Lol. Please show me where Biden has control over anything?!
Haha... Biden needs to get one first because Kamala doesn‚Äôt fit the agenda.
Local politicians react to #KamalaHarris as Biden's pick for running mate
I‚Äôve done my research, but thank you. Not guilty and had many black tenants. People get accused all the time, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs so. That‚Äôs called pulling the race card. Biden says black people aren‚Äôt diverse in fact.. they aren‚Äôt black, but here we are. #üöÇüöÇ
Funny thing is.... no one has said a damn thing Biden has done! In this whole comment section! Hahaha. SMH
Idt anybody is saying they want trump in office they jus talking about biden an harris aint about to be any better lol
Id still vote for biden but congress is about to run slam over biden an harris watch. They honestly not about shit. We all knew how trump was about to be in office an he showed us exactly that. Biden aint really no better tbh he jus not bigoted he still wild tho
How  kept his VP pick a secret
Biden was a known and established name and groundwork was already laid for him in the South. All it took was one massive win in SC for the other candidates to realize that. Pandemic didn't help much either
You know that Biden is a pedophile right?
The absolute meltdown going on in the American political right pretty much verifies that Biden made the right choice. The louder the GOPers freak out, the better something is for the rest of us. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
Harris was downright nasty towards Biden during the debates. She also says that she believes Biden's accusers. Everything says that this isn't a good match. I refuse to support Harris. The one who gets hurt is Biden because he lost my vote because he picked Harris.
...its not going to take 4 years of Biden being president for me to see if he's a good person, I'm already kinda iffy bout Joe. every 4 years we have the right to choose between the lesser of 2 evils... that has never sat right with me. yeah our people died for these rights but..
I think Biden's VP choice is really going to help him lock up that California vote.
Do you honestly believe that we live in a democracy? Or that any of this will change under Biden? A corporate duopoly controls our representation at almost every level of government. You're acquiescing to one wing of it, hoping it'll eventually be what you idealize it to be.
Is anyone really surprised he chose Kamala? We‚Äôre literally back where we started, the lesser of 2 evils. Granted, yes, Biden and Kamala are leagues better than Trump and Pence, HOWEVER both have shown to be underhanded, shady, and untrustworthy. But this is America so.
Biden could‚Äôve picked anyone LITERALLY anyone
Trump was relatively unknown and Clinton was known for decades.  Biden has been known for decades, and in 4 years Trump has literally nearly destroyed America.  No wonder it doesn't work this time around.
People,  we have two choices:  Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris. If you don't vote, you don't get to bitch for the next 4 years.Remember, it isn't just POTUS &amp; VPOTUS. There will be at least 2~ 3 SCOTUS  nominations &amp; a butt ton of federal judges to be appointed.
#BidenHarris Here's what Kamala Harris brings to Joe Biden's campaign for president
we know you don‚Äôt want to support the Biden/Harris ticket. We know you want to send the troops home and reform the VA. We know you want criminal justice reform. We know you want end the war on drugs. We know you want Jorgensen/Cohen 2020. #Jorgensen2020
Who cares!  Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate so who cares about what anybody in the trump family trying to talk about,  bad enough the trump virus killed more Americans than the country the virus originated from. Biden would've never let this happen, trump sorry ass
Does it even matter who Biden chose? Short of ALL OUT CHEATING,  will WIN BIG!
The SCOTUS argument is a common one, but not compelling. (Re: anita hill) Biden's probably even likely to nominate a moderate/conservative, IMO.
A real VP don't kiss a president ass like trump picked,  *scared to stand up for himself  *neither trump/pense wives known for being intelligent like Dr.Biden or Kamala  *one wife known for getting butt naked and pense wife constantly made fun of on cartoon president  üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
No disrespect at all. I think it's gonna take a fellow Bernie Bro turned Biden voter to convince me to vote Biden. Just haven't heard anything but "he's not Trump" yet, despite him being terrifyingly ideologically adjacent to Trump from my POV. How do you rationalize it?
She calls Biden EXACTLY what he is. "A Lying, Racist White man."
Not for nothing, but I'm glad Joe Biden didn't listen to whoever was going on about how Kamala was "too ambitious." Because what a crock of shit THAT was. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
To President candidate Joe Biden congratulations on picking Kamala Harris as your VP we got your back. We are not listening to trump he is too ignorant
Def let people be excited but also let people be leery too, it‚Äôs deserved. I wish Kamala all the best, but just like Biden needs his feet held to the fire so will she.  That‚Äôs what we need the leery people for.
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate in historic first for a woman of color
Kamala and Biden are more Republican than Trump
Less than two weeks ago Biden made a second disparaging comment about Black people. They‚Äôre not wrong.
I get it. He isn't an ideal candidate like Hillary. He's establishment. We hate establishment, but unfortunately it's the only way to get rid of Trump.  Biden will get my vote....but it hurts
You couldn't be more right. As a hardcore Bernie supporter/progressive I protest voted 3rd party in the election that got us where we are now. I'm terrified others will do the same this Nov. More than half the progressives I know are refusing to vote for Biden. I don't blame them
Like Hillary lost by a football stadium of voters in 2016.. Biden and Kamala shouldn‚Äôt have a problem with Trump.
I‚Äôm thinking about the Dem primary.. them old folks came out for Biden and they‚Äôre really reliable
But I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden has this election in the bag
The difference between trump and Joe, *Trump scared of women that speak up and know who they are *Biden admire women that standing up for themselves and that's one of the differences.  So all HBCU's So all sororities  So all fraternities  Let's get ready, trump gotta go 1/21
I dont want to vote for Biden but I‚Äôm tired of trump
Just a female of color. A ticket balancer. Mostly,  not a double white moderate ticket like the 2016 ticket
The same planet where someone thinks Joe Biden would make a good president.
#biden picks #harris  Pretty strong argument can be made that he didnt pick a black woman to garner favor with black people, but to virtue signal to white suburban PMC women. (He already has strong black support). Her value added is if shes good at fundraising.
This ain‚Äôt nothing, but a cover-up so #Biden don‚Äôt look #racist. So, now we got to choose between the ‚Äúin your face‚Äù racist or the ‚Äúcloseted‚Äù racist.  #BidenHarris2020 #thiselectionisamess
Interesting that Biden doesn't count but Kerry, Kaine, and, uh, Biden do.
Don't nobody care to look at trump,   Show Kamala Harris being escorted around by her new secret service team. Looks like we're well on our way to have tge 1st black woman president in a few years.    I'm so damn proud of Joe Biden for picking someone he's guaranteed to win with
Yall say joe biden not capable ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£Trump says Spanish Flu of 1918 ended WWII - a conflict that didn't start until two decades later
I can call someone all types of stuff but if they still want to give me a million dollars Ima take it lol. Biden should be the one asking himself why he picked her. Probably picked her because she‚Äôs not afraid to hold back her toungue. She‚Äôll be tough.
Why there's never any people of color in none of trump's old photos or videos? Biden out did trump with just his VP pick. Can't wait to see his diverse administration, not many people of color now and we tired of the white house smelling like chittlings whenever it rain outside
I just dont see biden an harris gettin elected. Like wtf are they gona do to get them votes lmao yall better get ready for trump for next 4
Kamala Harris still not a good choice as Biden's VP
Yang: BIDEN WILL PASS UBI IN THE FIRST TERM   Biden:
There are literally two candidates for VP that Biden could've picked where I might have voted for him. Those are Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard. Since he didn't, Biden can suck it.  Okay, who am I kidding? I wouldn't have voted for Biden, anyway.
Now it's our job to get behind them both. Kamala Harris will support Joe Biden just as Joe did with Pres Obama. She is highly qualified. This will be a great WINNING TICKET.
Lol  anyone who thought Biden wouldn't pick Kamala as his running mate. It's pure theater, lol.
Live now: President Donald Trump his holding a press conference, where he is expected to react to Kamala Harris being selected as Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate.  #News3Politics
Congratulations to Kamala Harris. An intersting choice but I think I would have chosen Sen. Tammy Duckworth.
Trump let‚Äôs have a bicycle race between you and Biden. Is it true you have to ride a golf cart to the crapper?
No matter who was chosen there was always going to be 3 outcomes for people: 1. I was voting for Trump regardless idc who he Biden picks. 2. I‚Äôm voting Biden cause I just want Trump out of office. 3. I‚Äôm not voting in this election I‚Äôm staying home.
Kamala supported legalization but not M4A... but other than that she‚Äôs pretty progressive on issues. Lets see what Biden will agree to..
Nothing much to say about this. Saw this coming the moment Biden and Dems took out Bernie. At the end of the day it‚Äôs Trump vs Biden so the VPs will have no real impact.
Zero chance Biden finishes a full term
Let the ball busting begin: It's Kamala Harris: Joe Biden announces vice presidential pick
Hopefully Kamala gets Biden old self to agree to some progressive ideas
Can‚Äôt wait to vote for you and VP Biden, ma‚Äôam.
I muted the words Trump, Biden, Kamala, and Harris like 10 months ago.
I don‚Äôt give a shit if Bubbles was Biden‚Äôs VP pick...im still voting 45‚Äôs ass out on November 3rd

Two days ago, I tweeted Biden will announce his VP pick on Wednesday. Looks like that could turn out to be correct
Isnt proclaiming you're voting Biden because Trump is bad the very definition of tribalism?  What got us Trump (1reason) was him insulting  then insulting  for being corrupt &amp; screwing us over.  Turns out, people were willing to vote him bec of that one truth.
Step back and realize, this should be a slam dunk election.  The pleas to vote Biden &amp; whoever he picks as his woke female VP only highlights how unhelpful  are. Shouldnt even be a contest.   "Trump will kill us all" was tried in 2016. It didnt win.
Men are fucking idiots, and I am sorry.  I'm a Biden man, and fuck the Cultists who aren't.
Joe Biden is probably picking Kamala.. most obvious for the Dem party to push her to run for pres after Biden
why are you so focused on a Black woman being VP for Joe Biden??? That's not what Black people whose lineage leads to slavery need??? They need Reparations and Reparations only for Black people whose lineage to slavery #ADOS #ADOSPolitics
everyone is allowed just one crack at the "Biden has selected his VP, it's [hilariously bad choice]" joke. this, obviously, includes Biden, who will be posting the last one.
When/if Biden wins he'll be out on his ass. Impeachment of cronies is too much a distraction while the Abomination that makes Desolation sits at the Resolute Desk.
BREAKING: Former Vice President Joe Biden announces CJ Cregg as Vice President. Allison Janney has agreed to stay in-character for the duration of his term.
Any chance you can get a third parties perspective on Trump and Biden, Trump represents National Socialism, Joe Bide, I voted for in the Democrat Primary to prevent the race being a choice between a NARCISIST (Trump) vs Communist (Sanders)?
What does this have to do with Reparations again?
Really hoping the #VPPick is Kamala Harris even more now just to piss off all the immature RWNJ's bleating about which one of her accounts still follows Joe Biden on twitter.
Like I say in an upcoming pod there is no charge Rs can level against Biden that Trump doesn't have 1000% worse.  Case in point: gaffes. Biden says 1 dumb thing.  Everything Trump says is dumb. He's literally an idiot.
Hopefully Trump gets voted out in November but the scary part is what he‚Äôll do to finish out his term between Election Day and the Inauguration... also it would be wild if more people show up for Kanye‚Äôs... I mean Biden‚Äôs inauguration during a pandemic than they did for Trumps üò≠
He says if Biden wins 180m people will lose their health care. As he goes to court trying to end people's health care.

So if all 14.4% broke for Biden, there's a 0.001 chance he wins Utah too?  My rudimentary statistics is likely wildly off but it does not seem coincidental that outstanding undecideds appear to be larger than the lead of the leader...  Legit believe they are soul-searching in UT
Ain't no way Biden writing or formulating his thoughts well enough to tell somebody to write his tweets. #Biden2020
For Biden VP?
Joe Biden had the cognitive ability to ride a bike and crack wise at State TV.  Your father can't pronounce basic words correctly.  Shut the fuck up, Jr.
This just in, God... ‚Äú Myyy Me, I thought TV money hungry Evangelistic were bad, what the hell did I do to deserve this guy, Trump, I‚Äôm voting for Biden‚Äù.
Yea I guess....... Seems unlikely, but again who knows.  Credit to the Biden camp for keeping a tight lid.  There is NO way he gets out of the African American Female selection IMO.
Hahahaha, Biden much like Trump has ZERO business in government. But it shows that the 2 parties will put just anything with barely a heartbeat and the sheeple will vote for it!!!
Couple that with MI being 16 EVs, maybe the Biden camp feels MI is a must-win.  IDK, but it sure seems odd that she enters this race at the 9th hour as a contender.
I would never doubt Joe Biden's faith, but I also have significant anxiety at the idea of him going to a worship service during a pandemic when those activities have shown to be highly efficient for spreading the virus.
Boomers.  My mom's friend seriously believes Joe Biden is a Commie who's controlled by the Bernie wing of the party.  So do all of her friend's friends.  Anecdotal, but I do know a good amount of Republicans and so-called independents that lap this stuff up.
Or, Biden understands MI is a "must-win" b/c he realizes that FL, NC, GA, OH, IA, and TX - no matter the Dem polling enthusiasm - are not winnable in the end.  He sees that AZ likely goes GOP.  Thus he knows that MI, WI, MN are must wins with PA being true tossup.  Just spitballn
I wonder who Biden's running mate is going to be.  It's between Harris and Bass I think.  #JoeBiden2020
Trump can't even drain the virus, his administration proved their the swamp, how many members of trump team got caught misusing government funds compared to Obama/Biden team. I'll tell you this, trump administration will go down in history for their swamp tactics
REPORT: Michigan Gov. Whitmer met with #Biden as he nears VP decision
Black Americans running to the poles for Biden and his 1st blk female running mate. Black and brown people pushing for the prosecution of trump and his family. Stealing American taxpayers dollars and nonprofit to pay back that 2 billion he old Deutsche bank, lock his ass up
Ya you do ... you get people like Trump and Biden!!!  But hey garbage candidates by the two parties that morons rush to put in office.. so ya thanks for the garbage !!!
Blah,blah,blah... the one on the moral high ground is you. And what‚Äôs funny no matter what the Democrats or Republicans put up simpletons like you on both side rush to put them in office even if they have no business in office ( Trump and Biden).
Seriously? Trump is literally moments away from shitting himself on stage &amp; making a Hitler mustache out of it, which people like you would cheer as a work of art. Yes, Joe Biden will be able to do a much better and be more competent job on day 1 than Trump after almost 4 years.
Really have to wonder why Whitmer is on the short list - is Biden down in MI?
It bothers me that Biden in picking a VP candidate at all!
Biden said, He ain't black.
The surprise Biden pick going right for the evangelical vote!
...Not saying Biden will unveil an MFA bill on Day 1, he won't. But voters need to keep electing more liberal congresspersons and push those people to pass such bills.  I firmly believe if Biden were given a Dem-Passed MFA bill, he would sign it.
Biden stated agenda might be exactly same as some more left voters would like, but Biden is much closer to them than anyone in Trumpistan...plus, new wave of more liberal Congresspeople (prior and upcoming cycle) (1/2)
Dear Meghan McCain, I'm Voting for Biden every time I go to #starbucks Coffee and get myself a Cup (Of Joe).
Okay see. For all the bullshit people give Biden, does this seem like a man who can't handle the job?  I think not!
Encourage everyone to sign up and leave comments on survey urging VP Biden to support big bold progressive reform as soon as elected.  We need to grease those wheels as often as possible, now
Biden's #1 excuse for perpetual inaction is going to be that he doesn't have 60 Senators.
Don‚Äôt waste your vote on Biden. You are only taking away votes from Jorgensen.
Biden says he would not add to the border wall if elected
If Biden has been lying so he can keep it all white it‚Äôs not going to work so let‚Äôs be clear she better have a brown skin
If Biden pick Governor Whitmer for VP he can forget black votes may as well pick West. He will loose the black vote so he better be careful when he chooses
No, no, no, no, no damn bike race.  Should be a Festivus Contest, where Biden gets to pin Trump after the Biden "Airing of Grievances" in a "Feats of Strength" contest
It is a dumb thing to say because there's diversity in all cultures, races, and ethnicities. Biden should know this. Biden needs to re-educate himself and stop thinking like a racist
SC was actually favorable for Biden in a lot of polls, tbf.
he is also who  wanted to pick as his VP. said TK was his heart pick but Joe Biden was his head pick, and that sometimes he makes decisions with his heart, sometimes his head. for this, he felt he had to go with his head. love TK.
I‚Äôm not necessarily a Libertarian but if one had an actual chance of winning, I‚Äôd easily vote for them over Trump or Biden.
Fuck Joe Biden
yall were real quiet about what biden said
No serious commentator really thinks we can move Biden left. lol
I mean, it sure seems that way.  I will concede that Biden probably won, but I don't think the margin was really that big.
Who Crime Bill Joe Biden selects as VP is not as important as a Black Agenda that includes Reparations for #ADOS
Sigh.  Career politician promises this time it'll be different.  "Economy that works for everyone"  But doesnt include UBI, M4A, breaking up tech, breaking up lobbying/cronyism, term limits...  Biden's main policy is "trump is a bad person"  #Unity2020
Trump jr better pray Biden don't win, better believe his A.G diving into everything the last administration did illegal, and between the A.G and NY prosecutor this family days are numbered. Greed go be their downfall and the joy in 72% of Americans heart will be priceless
CNN is not even confident Biden can win
It's interesting how CNN is calling this presidential election by saying Biden can still lose
This is the interview where Joe Biden showed his true colors.Can imagine if Trump said that, they would crucified him on the left.
Yes indeed!!! Biden, the DNC, the Democratic Party in general are going to be in for a big surprise
Yeah, completely agree. Bernie has crossover appeal, Biden is just Biden. If its comes down to it I'm voting Trump or 3rd Party. I have no interest in Biden winning just to step down for his VP to take over.
Nothing. It‚Äôs one of a great many reasons I didn‚Äôt vote for him in 2016 and will be voting for Biden this year. #FakeChristianTrump #VoteBlue2020
Biden is being told by certain Democratic insiders not to debate Trump. Whether he debates Trump does not matter. Biden's lack of a Black Agenda via Reparations is why he's going to lose #ADOS #ADOSPolitics

If elected, Joe Biden said he would not build any additional miles of barriers between the United States and Mexico border, the former vice president told NPR earlier this week.  #News3Politics
WHAAAT?!?!?!
#Democrats be looking stupid doing stuff like this. His comments on Latinos being more diverse than us is extremely ignorant at best. Biden just keep saying dumb ishhh as time passes closer to the election. And the sad part is, some of our people tolerate this. WTF???
If you would not consider allowing me to speak consider the Constitution Party of NM Nominee 4 President &amp; VIRGINIAN Shiela SAMM Tittle,  with people from the NSA and FBI speaking U all forgot the 4th Amendment Reps 4 Biden is Reps 4 ABORTION &amp; Gun Control!
why are two groups that openly support Joe Biden invited to speak at the Convention on Founding Principles, yet as Chair of the CPV, I am NOT invited to speak?  U R NOT upholding Founding Principles just inviting criticism as a prto-Biden group
I will be involved as a Delegate at the Convention on Founding Principles, yet as the Chairman of 1 of the few political Parties that is commmitted to the Constitution I am NOT invited 2 speak, yet Pro Biden people R, the Lincoln Project &amp; Republicans 4 Biden, Y?
I see you on here Sister. How have you been doing??? Haven't been on here this week but what I'm seeing and hearing out of Biden is beyond pathetic
Kamala and Biden go together like peanut butter and jelly when it comes to being tough on crime
I sometimes wonder if the Democrats are really trying to throw the election.  Joe Biden is a walking gaffe.  He puts his foot in his mouth more than I do, and that's VERY hard.
I‚Äôm just blown away at Biden‚Äôs lack of awareness
I don't know - I guess I can't be "sure."  It's just that I don't believe Biden will excite enough voters from those traditional R states to come out overwhelming to win them.
Trump's strategy with the press conferences has been a complete 180 - in a good way.  He keeps doing what he is doing and let Biden gaffe away.
This is a "Current" picture of Joe Biden  ... look close at "divet / hole in his right forehead and receding hairline!  I've been bombarded by a multiple Ads ... where Biden looks like he is a 50 year old!  But "DemoRats" won't Let Him DEBATE!  I AM A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT !

This rendering of Biden is really frighteningly real.
So the guy who makes fun of people with disabilities, wishes sex traffickers ‚Äúall the best‚Äù, defunds meals on wheels, grabs women by the pu$$/, and pays off a stripper is calling out Joe Biden on religion? Can we please turn his hypocrisy into a drinking game?The Dem leadership needs to insist that there will be no further COVID legislation passed in Congress unless the USPS funding and operations are restored. Also Biden/Harris should demand that No fix=No presidential debate.
President Joe Biden. Inmate Donald Trump. Pass it on.
I'm curious, if he was only calling out Biden/Harris' faults and criticized those who would be voting for them, and left Trump/Trump supporters alone, would you say the same thing?
Joe Biden is a Catholic.  There are not only no Catholics but no practicing Christians on the Republican ticket for 4 consecutive elections.  Thaw last Christian on a Republican ticket was Bush in 2008.
The lone Biden supporter didn't get to finish.....
One of the primary obstacles to peaceful integration: Biden and his compatriots. Rather than accepting that it was the right thing to do, benefits all, and allows for complete integration, it has been divisive ever since 1964. NOTHING FORCED IS PEACEFUL.

Yea ok. They must be democrats grasping at every opportunity. Moral of the story.... he aced it all. Passed everything with flying colors. Now let‚Äôs see if Biden can do the same because he is clearly deteriorating.

The pot calling the kettle black. Biden sexually assaulted women and children while in the position of VP of the US. Where are the majority of women who "claim" bad things against Trump?
I also agree that Biden should take a cognitive test like Trump did... but here we are.
Appreciate the transcript. Vausch seems naive as hell. He overestimated the Dems "monopoly on leftism," underestimated how many leftists hate Pelosi/Obama/Clinton, conceded that Biden wouldn't do shit to fix anything, and somehow concluded a magically progressive  future DNC? Wtf
Did you find any from Biden and Trump‚Äôs ancestor? No...? O ok
It's not really a fair discussion. If you don't fall in line with Biden, you get the "progressives don't vote so why should we cater to you." And if you do fall in line with Biden, they know they never have to do shit to get your vote for free. Don't fight impossible battles.
Professor Allan Lichtman has predicted every election since 1984, using a model he developed alongside Soviet Union scientists. This year, he's predicting  will be victorious.  #News3Politics
False narrative. We don't get along with MAGA neo-fascism. But Biden's record is unbearably adjacent to it. Almost seems like the centrists and the right team up against the left every cycle.

Biden deserves the credit. If Onama-Biden hadn't pandered to Iran, the rest of the Middle East may not be so quick to normalize relations with Israel. So, thanks Joe.
Well said Eileen, the more trump complains about someone the more fears them. Biden/Harris has him terrified so he does the only thing he can to try &amp; put someone down. That fool doesn't understand this won't work this time. Over the last 4 years he has proven his incompetence..
Its not about biden tho we talkn bout trump
We riding with Kamala no matter what We protecting Kamala by all means necessary  We voting for the Biden/Harris ticket like we did in 2012 We tired of the white house smelling like Smithfield packing everytime it rain outside,
Never Trumpers like myself, need not vote for Biden to stop Trump, just read the Constitution and block both Biden and Trump from achieving 270 Electoral votes and there could be a Biden-Pence admi nistration!
There were no stronger '16 Dem candidates than Hillary just like there are no stronger '20 Dem candidates today (outside of Michelle Obama) than Biden.  And Trump won one, and could likely win the subsequent election.  So I don't think that is quite good enough.
Hogan better pray Kamala and the NY D.A don't come together under Biden's A G and make public any and everything illegal this administration done. Keep in mind trump's already looked at for crimes with Micheal Cohen as well as misuse of nonprofit funds with his kid Open&amp;shut case
None of this matters until we replace King Trump with President Biden.  King Trump does not obey United States laws.
You can be as loud and as opposed to the things you want after Biden wins. Push them. Call them out. All of that is righteous.  Standing by and letting Trump become the next permanent president is way more immoral than compromising now to fight later.
There is no evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. There is no basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election.

Appointment would be made by the Democratic governor if Biden/Harris win in November. Here's a decent rundown of the possible replacements.
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúSeniors for Biden: Social Security Anniversary Event hosted by Jill Biden and Louis Gossett Jr.‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Agree! Before the bromance- chose  to balance the ticket. And now we know that Biden's selection of  , his own balanced ticket approach, has been a smashing success- just as  &amp; I predicted
I keep mispronouncing her name and it is accidental. I have been practicing because I will be saying it every day as I work for the Biden/Harris ticket. But when someone says something really STUPID I pronounce EVERYTHING WRONG.
Interns. Can‚Äôt you tell they sound intelligent. Can you imagine an actual Biden tweet. He would run out of letters before anything was coherent
Let‚Äôs go Team Biden/Harris....
Y‚Äôall watchin biden wit that lil smirk on his face right now lol
Watch Live: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make first appearance as running mates
Watch Live: Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era.
That‚Äôs the best reason to elect Biden. Besides the fact that he‚Äôs not morally bankrupt like Trump is.
I hope Biden finds a spot for Khizr Khan in his cabinet.  This man is a true patriot and as a lot to offer this country.
Trump with more socialist spending.  Trump - Socialism Biden - Extreme Socialism Jorgensen - Free Market Capitalism #Jorgensen2020
This might be an outlier since so many people do not have confidence Biden will finish the full term.
Beaugh Biden
If you believe black lives matter then Jorgensen-Cohen is your ticket, not Biden-Harris.
Joe Biden did another goofy move by picking her he wants black votes so bad it‚Äôs pathetic.. I‚Äôm not a Trump supporter either but he did way more than a lot of mfs..  Yet all these politicians are FU and corrupted ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Here‚Äôs a thought Biden has been in office for decades. The issue today have been the same for decades.  So if  hasn‚Äôt been able fix them in decades how will he fix them in 4 years? Try giving  an honest chance.  Work with him not against him.
Video shows  asking  to be vice presidential running mate
Want to join me for this Joe Biden for President event?
I can see mothers and their children being released from cages with a Biden/Harris administration. That mother's instinct won't stand by and watch it happen    I can see police prosecuted for killing unarmed black/brown people cause a mom always saying what if that was my child
The Final Lap: DID THE OBAMA- BIDEN - KERRY-  CLINTON IRAN DEAL S...
538 gives Biden 71% chance of winning. I want 100%. I don‚Äôt want Trump.
Kamala for sure would have been on Biden's short list regardless of committing to pick a woman and regardless of BLM protests. So I'm not saying she was picked because of tokenism, I'm just saying I don't believe she's the candidate most black people feel "represents" them.
Biden-Harris first joint presser at 3:50pm this afternoon.
If you vote Joe Biden you pretty much support a Pedo.
It's a weird situation because because Kamala would have been on Biden's short list even before committing to pick a woman and  before George Floyd, and those same headlines would show up.  But it just feels like so much more cynical now.
It's not Omar, nor is it Biden; it's the people that are behind them that is the threat to American's way of life.
Kamala &amp; Biden are not ideal, no. but yall would rather vote Trump again? lol ok....
The Final Lap: WHO LOVES JOE BIDEN ?
TFW you're on the Biden ticket
Trump said " If Biden win he is going to force every American to learn Chinese" üòÇüòÇ this man hilarious
WATCH: Viral video of man hanging off a semi driving down the interstate. Plus, we break down Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick. Newsfeed Now is streaming live.  Watch Newsfeed Now here:
Trump says 'suburban housewife' will vote for him over Biden, cites low-income housing policies  #FoxNews
I don't support either lol nor have I ever voted. However its many more tangibles Biden/Harris have done to the detriment of the Black community than Trump
If you think black lives matter and want true criminal justice reform, vote Jorgensen/Cohen, not Biden/Harris. #Jorgensen2020 #LetHerSpeak #ShesWithUs #VoteGold
‚ÄúWhite women‚Äù will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where minorities would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with *insert random black politician* in charge!
Biden Harris support tees. Just inbox and we‚Äôve got you   #joebiden #kamalaharris #bidenharris2020 #biden2020 #democrats #vote2020 #election2020 #vote #trump2020 #trump #bidenharris #fucktrump #dumptrump‚Ä¶
Congrats... did you make that up all by yourself?! Lol. Look at the original tweet from Biden.. HE said proud immigrants. Not you... Sleepy Joe!
Yes but that's misleading. Every President has signed a law funding HBCUs. Biden's plan  increases funding from $400 million to $70 billion.......
Keen observers point out unusual elements of Biden‚Äôs Instagram post with Harris  #FoxNews
Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals  #FoxNews
Lmao imagine thinking Biden will do anything but nominate a conservative.
Biden says he will get rid of COVID19....simply stop reporting it and release all the restraints! BOMB! NO MORE COVID19.
How very post-modern and relativistic....
It is kind of creepy but look at Biden and look at Trump
Biden shoulda picked my baby Tulsi as his running mate smh
538 reports that Biden has 71% chance of winning. Pretty good odds.    I want it to be 100% certain that we‚Äôre getting rid of Trump. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Biden and Kamala are wack but they‚Äôre safe enough bets to convince people in the middle to vote blue. Trash but could be worse
i missed the part where she said Joe Biden kept her from going to good schools...  can someone point me to the part of the video where that happens?
Really?  You think Sen. Harris has that much positive influence to solidly swing PA to Biden?
I had to send this out to my friends ‚ô•Ô∏è in a tweeterville. The pompas ass, need I say more, has opened his pie hole again to attack the dynamic duo. Saying Kamala Harris was a nasty so and so who wanted to kick Joe Biden's teeth in. And he didn't know what sleepy Joe was thinking
How about What Joe Biden did to Tara Reade.
How about What Joe Biden did to Tara Reade.
Why does everyone call Biden a pedo when trump allegedly raped a 13 year old girl who was tied up?  Are there any alleged stories of Biden raping a kid? Let me do some research and I will get back to you
Even "Trump Haters" don't want Joe!!!!! Why I Want Biden to Lose More than I Want Trump to Win
Kamala Harris, singlehandedly, is responsible for thousands of POC being wrongfully incarcerated all over the US for nonviolent crimes (majority marijuana). If you are planning on voting Biden, how do you feel about this? Isn‚Äôt this what we‚Äôre fighting against the most?
I 100% agree. Four more years of "dictator trump" &amp; we will have a country thats unrecognizable with a democracy thats lost. Biden/Harris ticket is our chance to secure a future for our children. Restore civility when we remove the blight from  OUR W.H.  We can, we will do this!
seriously what's wrong with all the people who are like "at least BIDEN won't be doing all that TWEETING"
Biden/Harris are NOT progressive at all
Excited to hear  acceptance speech for the VP pick on the Biden ticket! #NeverGiveUp
Morning friends, we have the team that will take back the country &amp;  save our democracy Biden/Harris! We must do everything in our power to make sure they win on Nov 3rd Call your local chapter 1st time voter needs to be registered, volunteer,  help anyway you can. We can do this
I know i liked her too but they threw her out like trash and she still endorsed Biden. That tells me alot about her too. :(
Me realizing that the only way to get trump out of office is voting for Biden and Kamala üôÉ
Congratulations I‚Äôm excited to support my AKA Soror for the Vice Presidential running mate ofJoe Biden!!!üíïüíïüíï
Lol. Please show me where Biden has control over anything?!
Haha... Biden needs to get one first because Kamala doesn‚Äôt fit the agenda.
Local politicians react to #KamalaHarris as Biden's pick for running mate
I‚Äôve done my research, but thank you. Not guilty and had many black tenants. People get accused all the time, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs so. That‚Äôs called pulling the race card. Biden says black people aren‚Äôt diverse in fact.. they aren‚Äôt black, but here we are. #üöÇüöÇ
Funny thing is.... no one has said a damn thing Biden has done! In this whole comment section! Hahaha. SMH
Idt anybody is saying they want trump in office they jus talking about biden an harris aint about to be any better lol
Id still vote for biden but congress is about to run slam over biden an harris watch. They honestly not about shit. We all knew how trump was about to be in office an he showed us exactly that. Biden aint really no better tbh he jus not bigoted he still wild tho
How  kept his VP pick a secret
Biden was a known and established name and groundwork was already laid for him in the South. All it took was one massive win in SC for the other candidates to realize that. Pandemic didn't help much either
You know that Biden is a pedophile right?
The absolute meltdown going on in the American political right pretty much verifies that Biden made the right choice. The louder the GOPers freak out, the better something is for the rest of us. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
Harris was downright nasty towards Biden during the debates. She also says that she believes Biden's accusers. Everything says that this isn't a good match. I refuse to support Harris. The one who gets hurt is Biden because he lost my vote because he picked Harris.
...its not going to take 4 years of Biden being president for me to see if he's a good person, I'm already kinda iffy bout Joe. every 4 years we have the right to choose between the lesser of 2 evils... that has never sat right with me. yeah our people died for these rights but..
I think Biden's VP choice is really going to help him lock up that California vote.
Do you honestly believe that we live in a democracy? Or that any of this will change under Biden? A corporate duopoly controls our representation at almost every level of government. You're acquiescing to one wing of it, hoping it'll eventually be what you idealize it to be.
Is anyone really surprised he chose Kamala? We‚Äôre literally back where we started, the lesser of 2 evils. Granted, yes, Biden and Kamala are leagues better than Trump and Pence, HOWEVER both have shown to be underhanded, shady, and untrustworthy. But this is America so.
Biden could‚Äôve picked anyone LITERALLY anyone
Trump was relatively unknown and Clinton was known for decades.  Biden has been known for decades, and in 4 years Trump has literally nearly destroyed America.  No wonder it doesn't work this time around.
People,  we have two choices:  Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris. If you don't vote, you don't get to bitch for the next 4 years.Remember, it isn't just POTUS &amp; VPOTUS. There will be at least 2~ 3 SCOTUS  nominations &amp; a butt ton of federal judges to be appointed.
#BidenHarris Here's what Kamala Harris brings to Joe Biden's campaign for president
we know you don‚Äôt want to support the Biden/Harris ticket. We know you want to send the troops home and reform the VA. We know you want criminal justice reform. We know you want end the war on drugs. We know you want Jorgensen/Cohen 2020. #Jorgensen2020
Who cares!  Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate so who cares about what anybody in the trump family trying to talk about,  bad enough the trump virus killed more Americans than the country the virus originated from. Biden would've never let this happen, trump sorry ass
Does it even matter who Biden chose? Short of ALL OUT CHEATING,  will WIN BIG!
The SCOTUS argument is a common one, but not compelling. (Re: anita hill) Biden's probably even likely to nominate a moderate/conservative, IMO.
A real VP don't kiss a president ass like trump picked,  *scared to stand up for himself  *neither trump/pense wives known for being intelligent like Dr.Biden or Kamala  *one wife known for getting butt naked and pense wife constantly made fun of on cartoon president  üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
No disrespect at all. I think it's gonna take a fellow Bernie Bro turned Biden voter to convince me to vote Biden. Just haven't heard anything but "he's not Trump" yet, despite him being terrifyingly ideologically adjacent to Trump from my POV. How do you rationalize it?
She calls Biden EXACTLY what he is. "A Lying, Racist White man."
Not for nothing, but I'm glad Joe Biden didn't listen to whoever was going on about how Kamala was "too ambitious." Because what a crock of shit THAT was. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
To President candidate Joe Biden congratulations on picking Kamala Harris as your VP we got your back. We are not listening to trump he is too ignorant
Def let people be excited but also let people be leery too, it‚Äôs deserved. I wish Kamala all the best, but just like Biden needs his feet held to the fire so will she.  That‚Äôs what we need the leery people for.
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate in historic first for a woman of color
Kamala and Biden are more Republican than Trump
Less than two weeks ago Biden made a second disparaging comment about Black people. They‚Äôre not wrong.
I get it. He isn't an ideal candidate like Hillary. He's establishment. We hate establishment, but unfortunately it's the only way to get rid of Trump.  Biden will get my vote....but it hurts
You couldn't be more right. As a hardcore Bernie supporter/progressive I protest voted 3rd party in the election that got us where we are now. I'm terrified others will do the same this Nov. More than half the progressives I know are refusing to vote for Biden. I don't blame them
Like Hillary lost by a football stadium of voters in 2016.. Biden and Kamala shouldn‚Äôt have a problem with Trump.
I‚Äôm thinking about the Dem primary.. them old folks came out for Biden and they‚Äôre really reliable
But I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden has this election in the bag
The difference between trump and Joe, *Trump scared of women that speak up and know who they are *Biden admire women that standing up for themselves and that's one of the differences.  So all HBCU's So all sororities  So all fraternities  Let's get ready, trump gotta go 1/21
I dont want to vote for Biden but I‚Äôm tired of trump
Just a female of color. A ticket balancer. Mostly,  not a double white moderate ticket like the 2016 ticket
The same planet where someone thinks Joe Biden would make a good president.
#biden picks #harris  Pretty strong argument can be made that he didnt pick a black woman to garner favor with black people, but to virtue signal to white suburban PMC women. (He already has strong black support). Her value added is if shes good at fundraising.
This ain‚Äôt nothing, but a cover-up so #Biden don‚Äôt look #racist. So, now we got to choose between the ‚Äúin your face‚Äù racist or the ‚Äúcloseted‚Äù racist.  #BidenHarris2020 #thiselectionisamess
Interesting that Biden doesn't count but Kerry, Kaine, and, uh, Biden do.
Don't nobody care to look at trump,   Show Kamala Harris being escorted around by her new secret service team. Looks like we're well on our way to have tge 1st black woman president in a few years.    I'm so damn proud of Joe Biden for picking someone he's guaranteed to win with
Yall say joe biden not capable ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£Trump says Spanish Flu of 1918 ended WWII - a conflict that didn't start until two decades later
I can call someone all types of stuff but if they still want to give me a million dollars Ima take it lol. Biden should be the one asking himself why he picked her. Probably picked her because she‚Äôs not afraid to hold back her toungue. She‚Äôll be tough.
Why there's never any people of color in none of trump's old photos or videos? Biden out did trump with just his VP pick. Can't wait to see his diverse administration, not many people of color now and we tired of the white house smelling like chittlings whenever it rain outside
I just dont see biden an harris gettin elected. Like wtf are they gona do to get them votes lmao yall better get ready for trump for next 4
Kamala Harris still not a good choice as Biden's VP
Yang: BIDEN WILL PASS UBI IN THE FIRST TERM   Biden:
There are literally two candidates for VP that Biden could've picked where I might have voted for him. Those are Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard. Since he didn't, Biden can suck it.  Okay, who am I kidding? I wouldn't have voted for Biden, anyway.
Now it's our job to get behind them both. Kamala Harris will support Joe Biden just as Joe did with Pres Obama. She is highly qualified. This will be a great WINNING TICKET.
Lol  anyone who thought Biden wouldn't pick Kamala as his running mate. It's pure theater, lol.
Live now: President Donald Trump his holding a press conference, where he is expected to react to Kamala Harris being selected as Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate.  #News3Politics
Congratulations to Kamala Harris. An intersting choice but I think I would have chosen Sen. Tammy Duckworth.
Trump let‚Äôs have a bicycle race between you and Biden. Is it true you have to ride a golf cart to the crapper?
No matter who was chosen there was always going to be 3 outcomes for people: 1. I was voting for Trump regardless idc who he Biden picks. 2. I‚Äôm voting Biden cause I just want Trump out of office. 3. I‚Äôm not voting in this election I‚Äôm staying home.
Kamala supported legalization but not M4A... but other than that she‚Äôs pretty progressive on issues. Lets see what Biden will agree to..
Nothing much to say about this. Saw this coming the moment Biden and Dems took out Bernie. At the end of the day it‚Äôs Trump vs Biden so the VPs will have no real impact.
Zero chance Biden finishes a full term
Let the ball busting begin: It's Kamala Harris: Joe Biden announces vice presidential pick
Hopefully Kamala gets Biden old self to agree to some progressive ideas
#2020Elections I‚Äôm so excited that Biden chose Harris! I‚Äôll pay money to see her debate Pence! Even if I watch in my own living room. She‚Äôll decimate him in 25 words or less.
Can‚Äôt wait to vote for you and VP Biden, ma‚Äôam.
I muted the words Trump, Biden, Kamala, and Harris like 10 months ago.
I don‚Äôt give a shit if Bubbles was Biden‚Äôs VP pick...im still voting 45‚Äôs ass out on November 3rd

Hell Yes!!!#KHive
Hear me out, Joe Biden is the SPAC sponsor and is going to make Kamala Harris the President in the de-SPAC
BREAKING: Kamala Harris selected by Joe Biden as vice-presidential running mate
So Joe Biden picked the woman who as a front runner in the primary took a couple shots from Tulsi Gabbard (who never managed to really gain more than 2% or so in primary voting), and was never able to recover from the sudden spiral of her campaign. #CmonMan
Biden picks Harris.

Sony's gonna announce price and Biden's gonna announce VP and the NCAA are gonna throw in the towel all on the same day. Tomorrow.
Two days ago, I tweeted Biden will announce his VP pick on Wednesday. Looks like that could turn out to be correct
Isnt proclaiming you're voting Biden because Trump is bad the very definition of tribalism?  What got us Trump (1reason) was him insulting  then insulting  for being corrupt &amp; screwing us over.  Turns out, people were willing to vote him bec of that one truth.
Step back and realize, this should be a slam dunk election.  The pleas to vote Biden &amp; whoever he picks as his woke female VP only highlights how unhelpful  are. Shouldnt even be a contest.   "Trump will kill us all" was tried in 2016. It didnt win.
Men are fucking idiots, and I am sorry.  I'm a Biden man, and fuck the Cultists who aren't.
Joe Biden is probably picking Kamala.. most obvious for the Dem party to push her to run for pres after Biden
why are you so focused on a Black woman being VP for Joe Biden??? That's not what Black people whose lineage leads to slavery need??? They need Reparations and Reparations only for Black people whose lineage to slavery #ADOS #ADOSPolitics
everyone is allowed just one crack at the "Biden has selected his VP, it's [hilariously bad choice]" joke. this, obviously, includes Biden, who will be posting the last one.
When/if Biden wins he'll be out on his ass. Impeachment of cronies is too much a distraction while the Abomination that makes Desolation sits at the Resolute Desk.
Joe Biden sure loves Cheetos
BREAKING: Former Vice President Joe Biden announces CJ Cregg as Vice President. Allison Janney has agreed to stay in-character for the duration of his term.
Any chance you can get a third parties perspective on Trump and Biden, Trump represents National Socialism, Joe Bide, I voted for in the Democrat Primary to prevent the race being a choice between a NARCISIST (Trump) vs Communist (Sanders)?
What does this have to do with Reparations again?
Really hoping the #VPPick is Kamala Harris even more now just to piss off all the immature RWNJ's bleating about which one of her accounts still follows Joe Biden on twitter.
Like I say in an upcoming pod there is no charge Rs can level against Biden that Trump doesn't have 1000% worse.  Case in point: gaffes. Biden says 1 dumb thing.  Everything Trump says is dumb. He's literally an idiot.
Hopefully Trump gets voted out in November but the scary part is what he‚Äôll do to finish out his term between Election Day and the Inauguration... also it would be wild if more people show up for Kanye‚Äôs... I mean Biden‚Äôs inauguration during a pandemic than they did for Trumps üò≠
He says if Biden wins 180m people will lose their health care. As he goes to court trying to end people's health care.

This just in, God... ‚Äú Myyy Me, I thought TV money hungry Evangelistic were bad, what the hell did I do to deserve this guy, Trump, I‚Äôm voting for Biden‚Äù.
Yea I guess....... Seems unlikely, but again who knows.  Credit to the Biden camp for keeping a tight lid.  There is NO way he gets out of the African American Female selection IMO.
Hahahaha, Biden much like Trump has ZERO business in government. But it shows that the 2 parties will put just anything with barely a heartbeat and the sheeple will vote for it!!!
Couple that with MI being 16 EVs, maybe the Biden camp feels MI is a must-win.  IDK, but it sure seems odd that she enters this race at the 9th hour as a contender.
I would never doubt Joe Biden's faith, but I also have significant anxiety at the idea of him going to a worship service during a pandemic when those activities have shown to be highly efficient for spreading the virus.
Boomers.  My mom's friend seriously believes Joe Biden is a Commie who's controlled by the Bernie wing of the party.  So do all of her friend's friends.  Anecdotal, but I do know a good amount of Republicans and so-called independents that lap this stuff up.
Or, Biden understands MI is a "must-win" b/c he realizes that FL, NC, GA, OH, IA, and TX - no matter the Dem polling enthusiasm - are not winnable in the end.  He sees that AZ likely goes GOP.  Thus he knows that MI, WI, MN are must wins with PA being true tossup.  Just spitballn
I wonder who Biden's running mate is going to be.  It's between Harris and Bass I think.  #JoeBiden2020
Trump can't even drain the virus, his administration proved their the swamp, how many members of trump team got caught misusing government funds compared to Obama/Biden team. I'll tell you this, trump administration will go down in history for their swamp tactics
REPORT: Michigan Gov. Whitmer met with #Biden as he nears VP decisionGod why do liberals have to keep outwardly justifying themselves voting for Biden.
#Biden continues to fuck w/ us yet he‚Äôs demands our votes cuz ‚Äòorange man bad‚Äô. Rejecting #MedicareForAll in a pandemic is corruption beyond words &amp; he‚Äôll get ppl killed too, sent my bro to die based on lies. Sincerely fuck #Biden &amp; #Trump #MAGA &amp; #KHive deserve each other
Probably an old pic from that rally when Kamala endorsed Biden.üåä
That makes no sense as he rejects #MedicareForAll in a pandemic and as #BLM protests remain going strong he chooses to suggest MORE funding for police &amp; picks a tough on crime prosecutor w/ a terrible record. Dowballot I think will be civil war but #Biden DGAF abt  a movement obv
That is it!!!!!  Let us vote from oir xars on election day like they are doing corona testing.  Let  members of the armed forces watch the ballots and be responsible  for escorting  their delivery .  #BIDEN #Democrats #Republicans
Look at what we could have if we vote Biden/Harris? Oh wow...gee wiz, can I really get taxed more? Pretty please? I was just told today that I‚Äôm getting taxed more to help pay for the rioters mess they left in RVA. How exciting!!!

My mission is to evict  from the White House. I don‚Äôt care about Scott Ritter‚Äôs view of Biden. My intention is to help him become President
From the start, some Biden advisers saw Harris as a logical choice. She was among the party's most popular figures, a deft debater and a fundraising juggernaut. But there was that debate-stage attack on Biden's busing record to consider.
LISTEN TO THE TAPE, THE REPORTERS ARE ASKING THE SENATOR (HARRIS) QUESTIONS, NOT BIDEN. THIS WAS NOT A PRESS EVENT, IT WAS SIGNING THE DOCUMENTS TO BE THE DEMOCRATS ON THE BALLET! IS THIS ALL YOU FOLKS KNOW HOW TO DO IS LIE??

Considering how well the last impeachment went, I get it. And chaos-created sympathy is something trump thrives on. So, while part of me agrees that it's the NORMAL right thing to do, I'd hate to see him own the media w/the Biden-Harris convention starting Monday. Strategy wins.
RON JOHNSON SIGNED THE LETTER TO GET RID OF VIKTOR SHOKIN. VIKTOR SHOKIN WAS A CORRUPT PROSECUTOR WHO REFUSED TO INVESTIGATE BURISMA.  THE INCIDENT WITH THE OWNER WAS INVESTIGATED BEFORE SHOKIN AND BEFORE HUNTER BIDEN
If this is such a problem why didn't y'all investigate it back in 2014? The key points were largely know by then. In fact, Rep. Stefanik made sure to mention that in her defense of  Trump. But I guess Biden wasn't the nominee at the time so it was unimportant.
I notice there's no option for Joe Biden on this survey
They just swept Biden sexual assault allegations under the rug. I guess it's only believe all women unless they accuse a presidential candidate
That's a great idea but I don't know if 'President Biden' is a sure thing yet.
Not his job to elect that trash ticket. In case u forgot it‚Äôs #Biden‚Äôs job and wtf has #Biden done to earn votes from #Bernie supporters??? Not a damn thing not 1 policy concession now a shitty VP so we won‚Äôt forget all the dem estab fuckery the last 5 years either. Piss off
The next few months of leftists arguing over whether or not we should vote for Biden are gonna kill me. So I‚Äôve been pressured into voting for him but I won‚Äôt ask a single other human being on earth to do so. Please leave me alone &amp; refer libs to this tweet when they yell at me.
I‚Äôm sorry I disagree and am not voting for him. My brother died in Afghanistan and millions are probably dead cuz of #Biden‚Äôs warmongering and I think ppl just don‚Äôt seem to care abt that. He‚Äôll start more wars he‚Äôs already itching to. Both are horrific to me
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Joe Biden and I approve this message.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Joe Biden and I approve this message.‚Äù
Biden wants to cut police funding.   But Biden will mandate masks indoors and OUTDOORS in all states.   Foolish.   #Florida #Arizona #Iowa #Atlanta  #Georgia
I think he‚Äôs terrified of him to the point he overlooks how horrific Biden is tho imho. I think he internalized a lot of the crap media said abt him from ‚Äò16 and he eventually started blaming himself. üòï
Sirota knew how to force criticisms of Biden into media coverage. Brie has said publicly Biden was gone at way too soft. I have no doubt  having more control woulda been a plus. If ur calling for revolution then go all the way in against dem estab that‚Äôs all
You'll have a very long wait since it's never going to happen. Biden will issue in a huge blue tsunami. Can't wait.
They rly hadn‚Äôt at that point and even then he had leverage he pissed away getting no tangibles on anything from #Biden. These are mistakes and we all love #Bernie but that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt criticize or reflect on what went wrong
Jeff Weaver is one of the biggest mistakes he made in hiring. He def coulda overcome rigging had he not been so soft on #Biden and landed no real punches on dem establishment. It only erodes his support when now he won‚Äôt call em out. Tapping into anger isn‚Äôt always bad.
I don‚Äôt think getting downballot progressives elected has anything to do w/ trying to coddle the dem estab. They still hate him &amp; trash him constantly. If he had gone way harder I don‚Äôt think Biden would been an issue
I don‚Äôt kno y ppl jump to this when we aren‚Äôt expecting policy from either circus and so why should anyone vote for either buffoon? #Biden said he‚Äôd veto M4A so FOH Not like #Biden has done ANYTHING but antagonize us &amp; vote shaming just pisses ppl off more.
You ask why and they automatically think you suck trumps dick. Bitch I voted for no one last election  but this year I will and it won‚Äôt be Biden. I‚Äôd rather talk about pussy then wonder why my presidents groping 12 year old girls on live fucking tv. Stupid bitches
He has no place in the Biden administration.
this is projection on his part.  his last gasp at staying in office will either be inciting a civil war or claiming he really won and the Biden Administration is an illegitimate Interregnum

Hope the Biden supporters are there to jeer him out, lol!
Doesn‚Äôt matter. Biden-Harris ticket is very powerful. Mainly you  will lose b/c the world hates you. The only world leader wishing you success is Putin. You‚Äôve gutted our agencies, more poor Americans since the Great Depression, Bounties on soldiers, lying about the Trump Virus..
I can't wait to say President Biden without being ashamed of the leader in the White House again.   Every single time I've accidentally said, "President _rump," I've been completely ashamed and embarrassed because he is #nevermypresident.   #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
And it‚Äôs been 13 years 2007) since joe Biden Said this about Barack Obama. ‚ÄúYou got the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that‚Äôs a storybook, man.‚Äù
No! We only have 1 chance to undo the major damage Trumpski has already forced on Americs. He's already almost ruined the entire country4 more years would pretty much finish the job. Biden is the only choice for true Americans. Can't wait for the big blue tsunami coming November
Plz don‚Äôt tell me ur talking abt a lame ass boat parade of diseased rich idiots... lmao and I literally just told u it‚Äôs not trending for #Biden
If Trump loses, it‚Äôs because of Biden calling him ‚Äúpresident tweety‚Äù absolutely devastating.
CNN Suggests Biden May Step Aside, If He Wins, and Let Harris Be President | The Patriot Source
#RVA  SC ruled: Children have a right to attend, &amp; parents the right to send them to, neighborhood schools, critical factor de jure vs de facto.  Opinion | Why Harris‚Äôs criticism of Biden for opposing busing was especially peculiar
I get being pessimistic about Biden‚Äôs chances of deposing Trump, but honest question, would you honestly‚Äîpolicy preferences aside‚Äîhave felt better with any Democratic candidate? They‚Äôd all be facing the same uphill battle and the same shit with the USPS. So, yeah
I just saw this gem: "Remember, Vote for Biden on November 3; Protest Biden on November 4.'  You can't even make this shit up.
I am just joking: the topic assume that Joe Biden could answer questions. What if he really couldn‚Äòt.
Yes and my neighborhood is also voting for Biden with all the lawn signs that are out there.
It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll get that from Joe ‚ÄúI take tons of fossil fuel $$, $$ from healthcare industry, &amp; think Marijuana is a gateway drug‚Äù #Biden. Vote ur conscience
Another take is that if Biden wins then the rioter's job is done. In any riots post a Biden win all rioters will be shot on sight.
It‚Äôs going to get dirty. And that‚Äôs just fine. His speach will just give Biden more to talk about during the convention. üòÇ

I really have hope and belief in you and all the people in the world. I feel a huge change coming. In the US we are striving to elect a new President Biden. Then we can join the rest of the world with science to tackle Climate Change.

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate.           #Iowa #Wisconsin  #Minnesota
Everyone I know is voting for Biden.
Remember when we had sustained double digit unemployment and 170,000 dead from a pandemic during Obama/Biden? Me neither.
Prove it. If you support Trump you think it‚Äôs okay to lie. You think it‚Äôs okay to betray your country. The Trump-Pence ticket will lose. Biden-Harris ticket is too strong. Choose character over Trump‚Äôs policies. Choose Biden because his character will shine through his policies.
the democrats will really stan joe biden like he isn‚Äôt the same as these pigs and lanat on them too
True, I think people should invest in those senate races. But I don‚Äôt think it should be a focus for the Biden campaign unless polls are about where they are now come October.   I don‚Äôt want to take any chances! #2016PTSD üò¨
The postal union endorsed Biden and the NYPD union endorsed Trump.   Yup.
If, on the other hand, Biden pulls it out in FL, we will know on election night Biden has &gt;95% chance of winning the electoral college.  Trump would have to run the table in PA, MI, WI, AZ, NC, GA, OH to win. Theoretically possible, but not at all likely if FL has already flipped
If Biden loses FL but still runs the table in the Midwest, we likely won‚Äôt know until DEEP into the night, and possibly for days/weeks afterward. Those states have far less experience with VBM.   It could be a slog, depending on the margins. This gives Trump his window for chaos.
"And you know who really doesnt have it, Joe Biden."    -  Obama (taking about the feeble-minded idiot and serial groper.)  #Iowa #DesMoines
ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ Obama and Biden are not fit to clean the toilets of a bus station! What a bunch of crooks, pure evil
It is political because Trump was responsible for setting up a strategy to minimize the impact of the virus. And he failed. No school openings, no football, no dining out. All because Trump failed the American people. Just like Obama had to clean up for Bush. Biden will fix it.
Most Americans blame Trump. He is a grifter con man who likes golden showers and sex with prostitutes. That is why he is so far behind in the polls and is trying to rig the election. Biden will fix it. Just like Obama has to clean up Bush‚Äôs mess.
The President was responsible for setting up a national testing strategy. He failed miserably. Mostly because he is a grifter con man with no intellect. Trump is the reason we have no football and close to 200,000 dead Americans. Biden will fix it.
We have to hurry up before Biden loses even more functioning brain parts.
This is a seriously great ad. Why isn‚Äôt it Biden/Harris at the end, though?
That‚Äôs a gross oversimplification. I think Biden was about the worst candidate we could have chosen. But this is about so much more than just one man. It‚Äôs about ideas and ideals. It‚Äôs about restoring some norms. It‚Äôs about the health and welfare of the entire planet.
I just saw your comment. I appreciate you engaging with the content.  Again as said, I don't recall vaush stating that in his recent video, maybe he has elsewhere. But I think we can all agree Biden is shit, but is better than Trump.
Viser omits Biden's first sentence: "I was joking earlier with a couple on the call."
You left out Biden's first sentence: "I was joking earlier with a couple on the call."
But... Trump is the president and is taking questions on actual issues that are happening in real time. (Not that he ever answers tough ones anyway)... Biden‚Äôs would be all policy-driven and hypothetical. Not really a fair comparison.
hello! this is a segment from yesterdays stream where I address the resurrected biden discourse.  It's a bit lengthy but I hope it will prove insightful and interesting to those watching!  Please give it a like &lt;3   (ps im not very good at thumbnails)
And you‚Äôre not sure if you‚Äôll be voting for Biden....
Neither have I. This includes Joe Biden who has taken questions on numerous occasions.
It goes without saying that everyone deserves to have access to these resources, yes? Especially during a pandemic? Despite their financial &amp; living situations, right? Universal healthcare is the ONLY humane option, &amp; Biden &amp; the DNC won‚Äôt even consider it &amp; it makes me sick.
It‚Äôs ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù in the sense they just inserted Trump in where Hannity talks about Biden.   BUT this is still very much accurate and  is a bitch for crying about, so I‚Äôm sharing üòÇüòÇ
And no, case ain't closed, Biden wins and then what? He increases the military budget, increases police spending, helps the rich, shits on the poor, clamps down on protestors, and ushers in Tom Cotton or some other maniac republican in 2024, pay attention, please.
Do you even understand why Trump is in office? It's because of folks like Biden, and more directly, Biden himself. This isn't rocket science.
but Biden has been at this longer than Trump has and has been devastating to our communities, it's just been covert and protected by the "D" in his name.  The squad? that's easy - they are all democrats and all were inspired by Bernie in 2016, it's not hard to connect dots.
How about Biden and Obama?
Geez-us, Biden will next be claiming credit for the invention of light bulbs and elevators!  Can‚Äôt his handlers get him in line with ANYTHING factually based?
Prime Minister Biden, anyone?  Are Voters Ready for Prime Minister Biden?
Nah, ain't no more "holding the nose" it's policy demands or the streets, Biden has put more folks in jail than Trump will ever be capable of, I won't hear that nonsense. Then he doubled down on the police state ticket, and you're telling me what? Sis please....
I know Biden's record all too well so don't come at me about fascism.
You clearly have no idea who you're voting for, and I'm not wasting my time to educate you. If you think Biden is your ally, you're gonna die on that hill.
You can criticize her all you want. So can the left.  They just have to vote for her and Biden anyways.  They don't give a shit about your vote, at this point. You are lost to them.
BTW, Q just called me and told me that we should all vote for Biden. Once he takes office the arrests will start.
If people wanna simp for Biden, I don‚Äôt care, but if I see either side engaging in gratuitous hostility and volititly over something meaningless, I will call it what it is: a distraction.   This is an unprecedented moment in US politics and we need to unify.
Jill Biden has a spouse who is suffering from mental deterioration. That being the case one needs an excuse to get away from that person and teaching will be her perfect excuse.
Until something fresh derives itself from the Biden discourse I‚Äôm done engaging with it.   The conversation on the Left needs to be about how we build off of the work Bernie did, building class consciousness, etc. not about simping for Biden.
Get ready for the onslaught, and don't believe a word.  Time to get this "industry" off our backs and out of our pocketbooks. Insurance Industry Front Group to Bombard Democratic Convention With Ads Attacking Biden-Backed Public Option -
He's taken tough questions on numerous occasions, but there has always been the risk of gaffes with Biden. He is smart to sit back and watch his opponent demonstrate his complete inability to handle a serious crisis.
They keep attacking the president because he consistently demonstrates his complete inability to handle the crisis we're in, or appoint and listen to people who could handle this crisis. If I were Biden I would sit back and let my opponent step in it too.
Now, when it comes to electoral politics, it's incredibly disrespectful to co-opt the revolution and tell Black people (who are fighting for our liberation and combating what Biden-Harris will maintain!) to wait every four years to put all our eggs in one basket.
I thought you were gonna keep going about agreeing with the women that accused Biden or about her putting thousands of our people in prison for marijuana .
The  will *never* get another dollar from me. üò§ü§¨   #Biden is supposedly targeting Texas ‚Äî but you wouldn‚Äôt know it from Democratic convention lineup
I like context.  Helps prevent people from taking quote fragments and running wild with them.  When Biden said:  "The truth of the matter is, you all, you all know, you all know in your gut what has to be done...
This dude.... Veterans has access to the Choice Program as a part of the ACA. This was sign in 2014. Trump trying to steal Obama's, Jill Biden, and Michelle Obama's legacy of helping Veterans. This dude lies about everything! You're FIRED!!!
Biden and Kamala will not fix the systemic problems in the country, I can't wait till they're in office so you can see them promise everything then do nothing but bow to their corporate master's just like Republicans.
I think #biden picked #Harris2024 because he heard her pipe game is extraordinary.....lol
Joe Biden couldn't pick his nose.  He wouldn't have the motor skills.
Kanye never sent anyone to jail. Id vote kanye over biden ANY day
You are an indicted felon. You &amp; the GOP are messed up. What does Putin have on you that you would sell your country out? It must be humongous. I can‚Äôt believe a Moscow Trump Hotel is worth treason- not even laundered Russian money. Russia or jail? Biden won‚Äôt pardon you. Resign.
I think my other tweet didn‚Äôt go through. I mentioned Hebnifer Hudson. After her family was killed he offered for her and her surviving family to stay in the Trump tower until the guy was caught. But he and Biden the same really
I mean, 79 though? One thing stands out was the support he gave to Jennifer Hudson when her family was murdered, he took her and the surviving family in at his hotel for safety. At the end though he and Biden, no difference. Zero
You've ruined everything. You'll go down in history as worse than Hoover. Can't wait for BIDEN &amp; HARRIS to get in and LEAD - you don't know how to LEAD!
And let‚Äôs not forget to shit on the Trump and Biden are the same crowd too
#HillaryForPrison will not testify in court about her #Benghazi activities nor her private emails to #Obama &amp; #WeinersLaptop  but she would serve #Biden and continue doing what she did before?
Smart of her it should keep moving north with Biden in office.
You lie. She said she's pleased to be a part of Biden's campaign. Prove I'm wrong.
Kamala Harris is 50% Indian, 25% White (her white grandfather‚Äôs ancestor was Hamilton Brown, infamous slave owner), and 25% Jamaican.  She ran for Senate as Indian American, and she's now African American after being selected as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate.
Like how Biden says ‚Äúcamel-a‚Äù? Micro aggression? Please.
If you didn't know anything else about Trump the hypocrite, this should be all you need to know to vote for Joe Biden.
I wasn't happy about Joe Biden and I'm flummoxed why Kamala Harris was even in contention. I'll vote for them but shit has got to change because these two are not progressive. They will change NOTHING for the maj of people and keep the status quo for the wealthy. #progressive
Yeah I don't mean to beat him up. I just get really frustrated when someone tries to draw an equivalency between Biden's rhetoric &amp; Trump's. It suggests that the intents are equivalent, which is hilarious. One is trying to protect people, while the other is only out for himself.
Exactly. The goal is to get rid of Trump. Period. If you sit it out because you're not sure Biden is the perfect solution you're giving Trump half a vote. What would have been a full vote for Biden is now no vote for Biden. Trump gains.
Joe Biden is on record multiple times for being against defunding the police.
Just read that Biden and Trump are tied among white voters. Not surprised, just disappointed.
I think the central question is are dems going to win PA, Michigan, et all via turnout or Obama ‚Äî&gt; Trump ‚Äî&gt; Biden voters.  Harris may be the center of the party, but is she a pick that‚Äôs going to appeal to the Scranton demo.
No surprise. Biden is not capable to answer questions. I can‚Äôt wait for the Trump Biden debates. More entertaining than the NFL!
Finally, this is what he would be CALLING for. The President doesn't have the authority to mandate this, and Biden had said as much in the past. He has said it's about leading by example.  So, again, this is a false equivalency.
GOP &amp; NRA accepted Russian money. Laundered? Johnson (WI) took Russian money for his campaign. Why these supposedly bright men would fall for Russian $ will be the unanswered question. These men were very foolish &amp; now will pay the price. Biden needs to reform our gov‚Äôt-for all.
This is Biden's quote:  "I would insist that everybody out in public be wearing that mask. Anyone to reopen would have to make sure that they walked into a business that had masks."
Probably Barr will indict Hunter Biden, and launch an investigation into Harris's citizenship.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are running on increasing taxes, defunding the police and taking away your guns.
Are you really serious here??  Biden is the biggest creep ever. There is videos proof of this pervert.   Please disappear and make everyone happy!!!
MSNBC:. You should be ashamed of  your coverage   If you want to talk about lies start with Biden and especially Kamala Harris. I hope all can see you are not a news agency and are only trying to dememograte our President. Shame on you.
Biden Discourse is BACK and let‚Äôs try and give some meaningful takes.   Let‚Äôs discuss the need for Leftist infrastructure, class consciousness, and the lack of leftist political power in the US.    (Please retweet+like to support!)
Hmm .... Biden wants to mandate an executive order FORCING masks outside for every American for at least 3 months.  You might want to look up the definitions of AUTOCRACY and DEMOCRACY again, to re-educate yourself.
While Trump casts his own ballot by mail, the post office has increasingly been in his cross-hairs as Democrats advocate voting by mail.
I get why people are going to vote Biden/Harris. I really do. I'm not, but I understand why others will. But please, please don't hold them up as wonderful people deserving of support. Be honest about it. You're reaching for a leaking lifeboat as the Titanic is going down.
The last time a VP was this critical to a campaign was 1944 when Truman ran along side a very ill FDR. Biden isn‚Äôt nearly as frail as FDR was but he‚Äôd be the oldest elected first term president. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how the anti-police crowd receives Biden &amp; Harris.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll sort mail in order to vote for Joe Biden‚Äù is the new ‚ÄúI‚Äôll crawl over broken glass to vote for Joe Biden.‚Äù
They've been promised more of our tax payer money all they need and more once Biden/Harris are in the White House.  We the people are what everyone needs to fund everything.    If you are wondering why all of the in debt fed funded agencies aren't worried, we are their cash cows.
He is definitely enabling them no doubt. But if Biden was president those same GOP mayor's and governors would be do the same actions if for no other reason than to defy Biden
No Ignoramus, you're confused with HUNTER BIDEN who screwed his dead brother's widow, while his Dad was busy looking for little girls' chests to grope.
There was no historical precedent literally whatsoever for how fast of a turnaround it was. No campaign ever had such a quick and remarkable comeback as Biden‚Äôs. History was against him, so his campaign wrote a new chapter in history for electoral politics.

Trump/Biden = two cheeks from the same arse!
That's OK, I'm sure Biden will commute the sentence just like Trump did for Stone, so whoopee dippee.
the most reality show headline I've ever seen and then they wonder why ppl think elections are a joke
There were no penalties to any states for their response. There is no garuntee that if Biden or anyone else was president there would have been less deaths than 16700. It's a pandemic. And most of the reason our response was so terrible here is because Americans don't listen
#Biden is garbage and so are all his sellout policies, if u don‚Äôt believe in universal healthcare he should stop trying to repeat #Bernie on rhetoric only leaving policy out. M4A ppl want overwhelmingly, it saves everyone $ and gives more choice.
My concern is that Biden Harris will do centrist things and they'll get labeled as progressive. Anything further left will be radical. If we're honest that they are both mainly centrist, then we can actually pressure them from the progressive left (not the unhinged radical left).
BBC News - US 2020: Biden campaign says Trump 'abhorrent' for fuelling Harris conspiracy  Trump is quick to label people as 'immigrants' No mention of his plastic wife though. He's the ultimate hypocrite. Melania? Sounds like a skin disease.
Biden's debate performance will be disastrous without at least some practice taking unscripted questions.

puzzle black support of Biden. The VP sidelined for 8 years, basement Joe. Blacks associate him with Obama!  They never liked Kamala or Cory.
It‚Äôs a poll go look it up urself I‚Äôm sick of centrists wanting to deny ppl healthcare cuz u want ppl to moronically love Biden on policy when no one voted for him based off that
Everyone really talking shit about how Biden wouldnt make a good president either but what fucking choice do we have? Kanye? I think the fuck not
Joe the wind bag Biden. You just hide your lies better. Be careful USA.
No I‚Äôm commenting where M4A isn‚Äôt an option. Ppl prefer M4A by miles ahead of shitty public option that leaves millions w/o care. Fuck #Biden  &amp; his corruption keeping them health insurers paid!! Millions just lost healthcare!
Wait until you debate Biden. He has had 38 yrs experience in our government. You won‚Äôt have any honest, reasonable comments to make at the debate worthwhile. You‚Äôll lie about the numbers. You‚Äôll lie about your accomplishments. At least you can‚Äôt sexually troll Hillary on stage.

Well they look segregated, probably how Biden wanted it.üôÑ
Biden has always been a stutterer. I am too. Sometimes, the words just get stuck. That doesn't take away from my inate ability to learn, and communicate. That is exactly how Biden is.
It is easier to imagine a general strike than a decent healthcare law from Biden administration in 2020 !
at least 3 anti Trump tweets just today.  Way to do your part for Biden.

those who are critical of folks not voting for biden love to tell us that we‚Äôre ‚Äúvoting for fascism‚Äù because of the possibility of a trump re-election. what they fail to realize is that the election of biden doesn‚Äôt remove a fascist from office, but just replaces one for another.
We should all want more; so I'll offer a few reasons to vote for Biden/Harris.  They have experience in governing (which is what we're hiring them to do).  Biden offers sensible leadership in the face of this national pandemic.  Are there refinements to be made?  Absolutely.
But that would be major. If a lot of black people vote for a 3rd party or stay home, Biden will lose. Then the next logical step would be for the DNC to say "what do we have to do to get black people to vote for us". That in itself is a win. Cuz now show up and get nothing
I would be open to listening to a fact-based policy comparison to tell me why Trump/Pence would be better than Biden/Harris... must be based on facts and policy... I would be willing to including character but I feel like that‚Äôs not necessary

Drink everytime Donny is an ass and every time Biden is senile
Actually more jobs have been created during Trump‚Äôs three and one-half years than all of Obama/Biden‚Äôs eight years.
This made me lol, and cringe that the bar is literally that low. (Not a comment on Biden/Harris, but against trump)
Drill down even further.  Big voter turnout in Milwaukee, Detroit and Philly will wrap it for Biden.
I don‚Äôt see a single lie in your response. I‚Äôm not particularly happy about Biden, but I support him because the alternative is a no for me.
sell your soul to team Biden, otherwise is literally 1984.
Listen, yes, Biden could have chosen a better VP pick with a less problematic political past. However, that does not mean we need to be racist and sexist towards Harris just because we don‚Äôt agree with her career thus far. Don‚Äôt be gross.
What a ridiculous question.  It‚Äôs Trump or it‚Äôs America.  Vote for Biden!!
Biden-Harris is a hot ticket. Trump-Pence are old white misogynists &amp; LIARS. The GOP is complicit b/c it allowed Trump to rise to the top &amp; win. The other 2016 presidential GOP candidates are all cowards just like the GOP. Where was the GOP during the last 3.5 yrs?  Russian $!

Biden seems more concerned about his health insurance donors. He‚Äôs already stated that he would veto m4a despite it being extremely popular
Are you going to vote for Biden?
I have a birthday wish on my 73rd birthday:  please don‚Äôt allow this President to be in office when I turn 74. Please vote Biden and Harris!
Honestly. Average grades, state school, loves trains... hold on, am I Joe Biden? #BidenHarris #relatable
Biden said he wanted to lock up anarchists lmao but ok
I gotta mute ‚ÄòKamala‚Äô and ‚ÄòBiden‚Äô cause y‚Äôall stressing me tf out
I‚Äôm going to stream later to discuss the fresh Biden discourse...but in a meaningful framework.  I‚Äôm not sure what time. Will give a heads up here.
The stench of failure mixed with California excess.  #Florida #Biden #TheVillages
the ‚Äòleft-wing‚Äô of the Democratic Party is in an even worse position to negotiate this time around compared to 2016, Biden is somehow to the right of Clinton even, and they tell immigration activists and environmental activists and BLM to ‚Äúgo vote for someone else‚Äù.
it‚Äôs funny as shit that people believe ‚Äúwe can push Biden &amp; Harris to the left and hold them accountable!!‚Äù when just about everything they‚Äôre doing at this point is just out of spite against the ‚Äòleft-wing‚Äô of the party lol
It scared me and I was unable to sleep. I am64 and so tired of the fight. One day if celebration with Kamala and Biden. I just wish November would get here quickly!

Joe Biden Calls For Mask Mandate: ‚ÄòEvery Single American Should Be Wearing A Mask When They Are Outside‚Äô
But, I have to vote for Trump because the Democrats pre-selected Biden and told the rest of the candidates to drop out, disregard voting, and skip the convention,  completely undemocratic.
wow, sounds like a competent politician then.  Do you know why Biden opposed bussing?
And to top it off out of all the women Biden was considering, Kamala was the top black woman in that list &amp; I‚Äôm thinking maybe all that extra demand made him lean more to her? Instead of others he was considering if there had been the same push for someone more progressive
WE are fighting for our lives, which is why WE are supporting Biden.  I can't wait to see the bitter outrage and despair you fake, when Trump loses, even if your acting is still as bad as ever.
This Republican is stating this:  Your goals are laudable, &amp; now is the time to fight. But sabotaging Biden's election is not the way to win. The Justice Dems are doing it by primary wins over establishment candidates. Give the centrists their President, you take the Congress.
Who was Biden's accuser?
Hey  here‚Äôs some prime real estate for some Biden/Harris 2020 posters....
I agree for Biden to be investigated for sexual assault, since that seemed to disappear now that he's running for president. Im just saying

It‚Äôs delusional to think progressive policies have a shot under #BidenHarris OR Trump and both are white supremacists even tho Biden‚Äôs racism always has some excuse #BoycottDNC2020
#Biden wrote most of those fascist policies. Millions are dead from wars he overzealously pushed &amp; if I hear one more person say ‚Äúmaybe next election‚Äù I can‚Äôt take em serious... #BidenHarris &amp; no #MedicareForAll makes it a clear fuck that #BoycottDNC2020
If u want progress you‚Äôd demand #MedicareForAll &amp; direct ur anger in the right place! Centrists make it impossible to vote 4 em w/ this shitshow #COVID19 response they let Repubs steer off a cliff as they did NOTHING! Fools r who believe #Biden gives progressives anything either
Don‚Äôt have because we have a Black woman on the ticket as VP. Help Senator Biden get elected so they both can show you what can be done to bring this country back to a semblance of what we can be. Stop all the hate.

Me either! This way, I know my vote was correct Biden &amp; Harris.
This is why Biden announced Harris on a Tuesday. His team knew there'd be at least 72 hours of Shitshow Funtime coming after their one news cycle. What do you think,
Things some can afford to be blind to and ignore are what some cannot escape, cannot afford to ignore no matter how painful the past...so stop saying get over it..is it really in the past.üò•
Who are you kidding. You lied to the American people. You called the COVID-19 a Democratic Hoax. You wasted valuable time in which you could have lessened the deaths &amp; misery of thousands of Americans. Biden-Harris ticket is strong. You &amp; Pence are weak &amp; selfish and Liars.
Biden Gets Endorsed By Communist Leader  via  Patriot News
Nope. Im guessin u think it was an accident when Biden did it? I was genuinely askin. But evidently u aint got no answer. It‚Äôs all good tho; i got no dog in the fight- I just think its funny u called him out when her running mate did the exact same thing. That is all. Carry on.
Dr. Biden will direct the decorations. In between teaching as a college professor.
Kanye is running against Trump as an independent. Is Jared going to have a "general discussion" about policy with Biden? If you have that discussion with one opponent, why not with all of them?
You said pence was intentional. So I very simply asked you if Biden‚Äôs was intentional. Ain‚Äôt no bad faith to it. You are assuming that. Why y‚Äôall get so bent outta shape when anybody asks literally anything that doesn‚Äôt directly fit or fall in line into this liberal narrative?
The optimism of a Biden/Harris administration will be rekindle the American entrepreneurial spirit and new businesses will be born. Optimism is best for markets, not the doom and gloom of Trump‚Äôs corrupt authoritarian regime.
It sounds as though Trump is admitting that he was mean and condescending towards Joe Biden. I wonder what prompted this rare instance of honesty? It was probably a slip of the tongue or the Twitter finger.
President Biden. Sounds better and better every day, especially now with Vice President, Kamala Harris. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Nicer words with Biden? Unlikely. You‚Äôll probably get... words. Not in any particular order.
so we just toss pot shots in our own given echo chambers? I don‚Äôt disagree that people ‚Äúdunking‚Äù on bernie and just unnecessarily shitting on Biden are problematic.  I‚Äôm just not sure the rhetoric here is convincing for anyone not already in agreement with Vaush.
They would swoon for whomever Biden chose. They're shameless partisans, in case you haven't noticed.
In 2017 Virginia set the tone for 2020, in 2018 the rest of the country followed. In 2020 Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have set the tone for the next 4 years. We are all ready to elect #BidenHarris
Serious question: Was it intentional when Biden just did it?
Biden didn‚Äôt even say it right announcing her ! ü§£
What dies that even mean? Lol who gives AF about his followers, Biden did the same shit! ü§£ üíÄ
Uhhh  ....you do know I that your boy Biden pronounced it the same exact way just the other day right? Lol cant make this stuff up.
I like how if you ask someone why they vote for Biden they can‚Äôt answer without saying ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù
Joe...Biden...Is... Catholic. Full Stop!!
I agree Miles, he is funny to watch on TV. But nobody wants him in charge of their freedom or bank accounts or jobs! Let alone Kamala who will be President within 6 months after Biden takes office. Thank God that will never happen! #TRUMP2020ToSaveAmerica

Maybe the winning team of Biden-Harris didn‚Äôt want to show up Trump any further right now. Trump is a cheater. Trump is a liar. The GOP &amp;  Trump deserve to go down in history as the most corrupt &amp; traitorous administration in the last 100 years. Just like the Trump Virus. Shame!
I wish no ill will.  May she Rest In Peace.  Your political record is a disaster though and Biden is a 40yr career loser in politics.  Democrats always pander for votes and never have to answer questions on their voting record. Biden is a joke, made millions on tax payers

'It's a risky bargain': Columnist says Joe Biden took a gamble by tapping Kamala Harris for VP | Conservative Institute
I don‚Äôt think Joe Biden needs help losing this election. He‚Äôs doing a great job of that on his own
Sure, it‚Äôs easy to say it doesn‚Äôt keep Biden from being elected. But it maintains the degradation of our norms and corrupts our media, making it easier for the next ‚ÄúTrump Republican‚Äù to wage similar attacks on future candidacies not as strong as Biden/Harris
Flaws can be as minor as a big ego. That's all I was saying. I recognize he's not a perfect person. He's still a person I can vote for &amp; sleep at night. Unlike a racist, bigoted, lying, sick perv like Biden. And now you can add senile to that list.
These are the return of the jobs created under Obama-Biden and lost under Trump-Pence due to these failure to protect us from the #TrumpVirus
Heard a Trump supporter say that if Biden wins in November that he will move to Canada, and that is the energy we all need during this time
For the sake of Asian representation and he endorsed Biden.
They‚Äôve moved from thinking Obama or Hillary is the President to blame things on, and on to Joe Biden. I‚Äôm pretty sure Trump is the President you dumbasses.
Much of your list of opinions, unproven accusations, and made up stories. Plz. The most for Joe Biden and Kamala would go on for days and days.  I'm trying to be civil and you're just throwing out lists made up by fear mongers and spreaders on the left. Nice "research" job.
I have a bet going that Biden dies before the election and she becomes the nominee
Biden won‚Äôt even remember what happened üòÇ üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
That's been proven to be one of Trump's lies. Try to keep up. Trump was the one trying to bribe the Ukraine into lying about Biden's involvement. That's a F A C T.
if Hillary Clinton couldn‚Äôt beat Trump (not that she was a perfect candidate, but she pretty much only lost because of ‚ÄútHe eMaiLS‚Äù and the fucked up electoral college) y‚Äôall really expect Joe Biden to be able to beat him???

Your scare tactics are not going to work.  Joe Biden has said no such thing.  He does want to get the virus under control, get all Americans tested, which will be the way we can move forward without massive loss of life. Vote and Donate
Once again we got trash choices for presidents ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è honestly tho bruh trump might be the slightly better choice.

Biden will enforce wearing masks OUTSIDE.   #Wisconsin  #Iowa #Ohio #Minnesota
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
He's already calling for mandates. Imagine when he's not asking for your vote. #Election2020   Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
Fuck Kamala, fuck Biden and WAP is big mid
Biden‚Äôs REAL agenda.
maybe I'm a weirdo but I love telling people why I won't vote for Joe Biden‚Ä¶ hone your pitches people
They‚Äôll probably give the Nobel Peace Prize to Biden.
LoL at Democrats claiming reparations for Trumps economy.  These losers will do whatever it takes.  Obama was a catastrophe, along with sleepy Joe.  Biden is 10times worse, he is a career politician of utter failure
Biden must be in really bad shape.  It's a Democrat disaster.
Bloomberg could, too. Remember when he pledged to put everything behind Joe Biden?  Now is the time.
What's absolutely killing me is seeing folks on this hellscape - Biden voters, advocating for actual incremental change...unironically, at that.  This year needs to be launched into the sun alongside the shitlibs.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
Who yal voting for ? Yal all seem to hate Biden &amp; Kamala so much .
In his defense, Biden probably has no idea what Trump actually said.
So Biden and Kamala Harris‚Äô big announcement and contribution is to peddle a face mask mandate, while our President just did a little thing like brokering a deal for actual Peace in the Middle East,  I  CAN‚ÄôT!! üòÇ God Bless our President!üôèüèª
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  #daretospeak
How ironic.  Biden announces he would force every American to wear a mask outside, yet it's Trump who is called a fascist, a dictator, a Nazi and even Hitler.
But loved Biden when he was with Obama .. lol
Not a single person who will vote for Biden/Harris and you out of office gives one sh*t what you think
I‚Äôm starting to think Cornyn is campaigning for Biden/Harris.
Biden will send his federal storm troopers out to enforce masks
So my coworker started on his Kamala Harris rant and how it‚Äôs ‚Äúkinda racist‚Äù that Joe Biden committed to picking a female woman of color (he only committed to choosing a woman). Then my boss says (FINALLY), well I‚Äôm on an ‚Äúanybody but Trump‚Äù train myself. Conversation ended.
Good. Glad she was the ring leader. She‚Äôs smart. She‚Äôs brave, she‚Äôll tell Biden when he‚Äôs missed the mark or wrong. Pence is a Trump sycophant who follows whatever the traitor tells him too. Pence is a Christian and he obeys Trump. WWJD?  ETTD. Pence = hypocrite &amp; Trump = liar.
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. ‚ÄúHey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúReady to work! Let‚Äôs go (Dr. Jill Biden)!‚Äù he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
Uhhh.... maybe if you want to project how much better you're doing than Biden you should share a video with CG from this century. That looks like someone made it in high school in 1997.
I'll take Biden any day over that idiot you support. We'll see about this peace deal. It's another phony ploy to make him look like a decent human being. Won't work

And the DNC succumbed to Yang only after a deluge of Yang Gang activism. They gave him the opening slot on night 1.   The deep corruption and dishonesty in the DNC represents the entire party. Biden and Harris are entrenched and complicit. Don't kid yourselves.
Flip the vote.     This could become a daily thing.   It looks like these morons are going to keep posting these polls until they can get Biden a win.
Oh FFS ... stop pretending Biden actually wrote this.
And I know you don't need someone ELSE telling you to vote, but  brought up a good point that Trump's less likely to fight election results if Biden is an OVERWHELMING winner off-the-bat. So please, vote for Biden, and get your absentee ballot in as early as you can.
Spelling Correction:  it's Tara Reade.  "Harris, who had by that point dropped out of the presidential race, said that Reade ‚Äúhas a right to tell her story.‚Äù
Trustworthy?  The most corrupt lawless traitorous lying president in the history of America?  Surly you can't mean that. Biden is 1000 times more trustworthy than Trump could ever hope to be even if he tried, which he doesn't.
You keep using the word ‚Äúaccusers.‚Äù  Where did Kamala use that word when talking about the women who said Biden‚Äôs lack of awareness of their personal space made them uncomfortable?
My concern is Trump is willing to do anything to retain control, just like Putin. I hope that Biden and Kamala both have heavily armed security. I don‚Äôt know if i even trust secret service at this point.
Imma get Biden‚Äôs face on one boob and Kamala Harris on the other one. Who‚Äôs with me?
If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to tell it that it still has to vote for Biden,
Yes, I am too! Nasty woman 100% behind Biden/Harris2020
And the DNC succumbed to Yang only after a deluge of Yang Gang activism. They gave him the opening slot on night one.   The deep corruption and dishonesty in the DNC represents the entire party. Biden and Harris are entrenched and complicit. Don't kid yourselves.
And I‚Äôm still voting Biden because it‚Äôs more important to get trump out of office.   But in 4/8 years the democratic national party HAS to do better and HAS to start listening to us.
Krystal Ball: Biden's Hillary 2.0 Campaign Could Be Headed For Disaster
Please don‚Äôt let these people try to deter you from voting for Biden with these think pieces. Do JB and KH have some questionable pasts? Yes but anything is better than 45. Our country can‚Äôt afford another 4 years of him. Get out and VOTE!
The world is already laughing at you so as you said, ‚ÄúWhat do we have to lose?‚Äù With Biden.
I find the best way to engage is to assume that even if the person is coming at Biden from the left that they will still vote for him. Some leftist people might be passionate about Bernie or disliking biden but a lot of us see the writing on the wall and Will do what's necessary
Facebook is literally all politics now. I‚Äôm over it. No one cares why you support Trump. No one cares why you support Biden. They are both shitty human beings. I‚Äôll just keep to myself and continue living this life, day by day.

There is nobody meaner or more condescending than you. You set the standard for that. Zero in the polls?  In your dreams. Biden and Harris are going to crush you and Pence in November. Can't wait.
I watched that end to end last night. Joe Biden's next words after your video cuts out is correcting himself and saying her name correctly. There is plenty to be critical of Uncle Joe without resorting to dishonesty.
...I think all the people who think that Biden has lost it and not Trump never really listen to either of them in full.  They just form their impressions from select, edited playbacks on Conservative media
#guncontrol as a policy is deeply racist . If you think different you might want to research your history  and stop listening to the people making money off of mass incarceration *coughmala harris*   *coke biden* my bad these allergies . All this crap in the air .Woo #2A
Voting for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and saying you're with the #BLM movement (not the organization) is highly oxymoronic . They both are part of the reason you have to say #BlackLivesMatter and keep having to say it .
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
Relief and hope. Biden relief - Harris - hope.
I'm not a Trump supporter so you can spare me the religious guilt trip. funny tho that a Biden supporter could preach on morals.  A pedo/woman assaulter who picked his running mate whos done her part to imprison more African Americans then the Amistad. But you'll answer as well.
How is Trump responsible for every Covid death in the country? Did Trump make people go out to the Miami beaches? Does Trump make people not wear a mask? And i guess if Biden was President, everybody would've put a mask on and nobody would have died? smfh
It's not a threat.... Joe biden has some form of dementia or a relative illness and that will be on display in the debates
I‚Äôve seen a lot of that too. Whiny, sore losers. Even Bernie is on board but his ‚Äúpeople‚Äù can‚Äôt let it go. Screw them.  Up turnout in Philly, Detroit and Milwaukee and Biden wins without them.

I'm going to vote for biden while shitting on him the entire time
Biden/Harris 2020! I will be there in person as well!
seems okay electorally for Biden and Trump and those allegations weren‚Äôt even consensual, or part of a proven, actual plot with email proof to take someone down
What idiot thought a tweet from Biden - which included the words LITTLE GIRLS - was a good idea?
You big mad or little mad? Lol Biden/Harris2020!!!
Despite a global pandemic, the party has made zero moves to provide meaningful help, and Biden has been openly dismissive and disdainful of the idea of giving poor people healthcare
Does anybody actually believe that Biden can be "pushed" left at this point? We're in the middle of the longest period of sustained civil unrest since the 1960's, and his biggest challenger in his party primary was a democratic socialist, and what did he and the party do?

Rasmussen +12? Is this a farce to get people to think Trump has no chance so Biden voters will end up staying home
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt paint his face with an airbrush.   I like Presients like that.
It‚Äôs really nasty to prop up this charade on USA that a man with dementia should run the free world. Joe Biden isn‚Äôt fit to serve.
You seem to make the argument that a Trump white house would keep more people upset and aware enough of the mechanics of systemic oppression to keep people engaged.  That a Biden white house would partly lull our neighbors into a false sense of security. Is that an accurate read?
At least he acknowledges it, and will likely surround himself with people who understand it better than he does. Someone like AOC will have some influence on a Biden administration. Trump will continue to turn back the clock on what little progress we've made.
If you honestly believe that you have every right to vote for whomever you want. I told myself the same thing in 2004 and 2008. If they truly are the same then you should have no problem with me saying that your decision is more likely to help Trump than Biden.
This video really makes it seem like Joe Biden is the hardworking underdog? Is that the message?
Trump‚Äôs press conference, following  the outstanding speeches from Biden and Harris, was like a sad, wet blanket. The delivery of the stuff on his cue cards was pathetic.
Not only  needs secret service to pay her a visit for those evil comments with malice intent. It's a signal for potential harm coming Biden's way soon. There's no bottom with these REAL human scums on FOX.
I don't see "walk through broken glass barefoot to vote for Biden" anywhere on that card, sir.
How to tell a young family member who your really close to that Biden is not a fucking option and he won't be much better than Trump really
You explicitly stated voting for Biden was "somehow worse," so...
I said explicitly for a reason. Regardless, what's your alternative? Vote for Trump? Don't vote? You have to work with the tools you're given. If voting for Biden saves one more life, then yeah it's a better option. We should push for better, but doing nothing isn't better.
Biden is almost certainly gonna be nothing more than a mouthpiece for the Democrats given his mental health. Dems are still oligarchic capitalists, but at least they don't explicitly hate people and seek to remove them.
And yet there he is, the Democrats candidate for President of the United States. And the floozy he picked as a running mate, whose strongest qualification is her ability to sleep her way to the top? Pandering, thy name is Biden... Pathetic.
6ix9ine hurt himself? Boosie IG got deleted? I got banned from IG for 1 week? Biden got a black VP? What‚Äôs next?
What the heck?  He goes on &amp; on saying Kamala said, ‚Äúhorrible, horrible, horrible things about Biden.‚Äù Are we supposed to believe Trump is volunteering to be hurt, prickly and petty for Biden?  Just sayin, the mental double talk is confusing...  #VoteBidenHarrisüåä
All that pandering  did to get prolly the same BS #Biden gave us ü§£ü§£ü§£ told ya he DGAF lmao #NotMeUs #UnitedLeft #Warren #warrenforvp
I totally get where you're coming from, but as fucked up as it is, I'd rather perpetuate a broken system then break it further. It's very likely Biden will kill less people than Trump. He'll still kill people, just not as many. Ugh. Fuck liberals.

It will go up when Biden is in the White House!!!
You realize that the picture you put up for Biden... happened on Trumps watch because he has lost control and made this country divided.. you know United we stand, divided we fall...
you are a full blown prick you just dont want Biden to debate Trump because you know it will show the world he is a fraud and has not accomplished anything in 43 years in office
I know we gotta vote for biden and kamalaüôÑ, but I‚Äôm not about to hype them up like I like them.
I acknowledge what you are saying. Unless they find some dead bodies buried in her back yard, I am voting for Biden. And it still depends on how many dead bodies?
That only makes sense if republicans base is willing to vote only for republicans, essentially making the voting base puppets. If don‚Äôt agree with Biden polices but are voting out of the fear trump, then the party is taking u for granted and u are making yourself a puppet
That's right.   Seeing progressives like Cori Bush unseat incumbents gives me hope too. The squad is growing, progressives are gaining ground. Supporting the Biden/Harris ticket and down ballot progressives is what we can do to get closer to progressive policies.
As I‚Äôve said before, Kanye takes more votes away from potential Trump-leaning voters than Biden voters, the data we‚Äôve seen shows it. The Republicans trying to get him on the ballot to help Trump are shooting themselves in the foot.
I just don‚Äôt want to settle on someone who deserve to be in office. If the argument is if I don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden, that‚Äôs a vote for trump. Then if I don‚Äôt vote for Trump, that‚Äôs vote for Biden.
TBH I do worry about Biden's debate performance. I didn't find him very inspiring in the primary debates. Of course, his best one was the one on one debate with Bernie. Hopefully that Joe Biden will show up for the trump debates.
Centrist logic about why many #Bernie supporters won‚Äôt vote #Biden ‚Äòif u don‚Äôt support our subtle fascist u obv don‚Äôt kno #Trump is bad‚Äô lol
It‚Äôs the excuse people give me for voting for biden. I know trump is terrible human being but give me something other than ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù so I can be motivated to vote him. I want positive change not just a sit in president. I really hope that our generation doesn‚Äôt settle
Honest question, if Biden tweeted a good meme tomorrow do you think it would be received well? I honestly don‚Äôt think it could work at this point.
The anger needs to be directed at the people managing his digital media. Not Biden personally, that‚Äôs just my opinion. I have Alzheimer‚Äôs and demented folks in my family. It‚Äôs not fair and I take personal offense to this tweet

There are more of US, than there are of you!! You are so leaving. Americans will be coming out of the woodwork voting you out! Biden made a smart choice with Kamala. Find a lawyer, you are going to need it in New York!!! Oh Happy Days!!!!!
Biden-Harris will defeat your traitor, criminal, &amp; liar in the WH. The whole world will rejoice when Trump is defeated &amp; jailed, except for PUTIN. Trump could protect America if he gave up Putin. History will not be kind to Trump or his criminal, traitorous family. Trump cheats.
Wow, you all don't waste anytime smearing the lies on do you?  Both Biden and Harris are moderate democrats. Your fear tactics are not going to work this time. There is no radical green deal, there is not allowing rich corporations to pollute &amp; harm our atmosphere!! Go Joe!!

Kanye is a lover. While Trump speeches hate (I agree) but Biden also gives false promises while making our community worse. That‚Äôs why as long as his immigration protection is better I‚Äôm okay

I don‚Äôt blame people voting for trump if they benefit from it same way liberals are gonna benefit from Biden winning. Worry bout yourself
It‚Äôs so funny how much y‚Äôall hate trump. Biden and trump the same person. Y‚Äôall allowing Biden to  disrespect y‚Äôall because he‚Äôs not trump.
I‚Äôm literally black. I don‚Äôt care if Biden or trump wins. But you not gonna tell me what I do or don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôd prefer if Biden wins but it doesn‚Äôt matter to me. I‚Äôm voting for myself that‚Äôs how it goes.

Biden-Harris all the way. I just have this weird quirk about wanting to vote for people who are competent and aren‚Äôt addlebrained egomaniacs.
As much as I don‚Äôt like Biden - we can‚Äôt make the same mistake that cost us the 2016 election. No candidate will be the perfect representation of what we want, sometimes we have to compromise &amp; check our privilege to ensure those of us that aren‚Äôt as carefree with votes survive.
The left needs to stop making itself such an easy target for centrists and vague allegations from the likes of Dems who excuse rape w/ #Biden shouldn‚Äôt be feared. It‚Äôs just nonsense cuz within a day or 2 it was  obv it was bs... that‚Äôs a winnable race too
If u think voting for Biden is harm reduction and not acknowledging its harm displacement to globally south countries, because u actually don‚Äôt know much just say that!
Exactly what we expect from Donald Trump, who by the way, has proven to the world that he is nothing but a big fat FAILURE. Biden/Harris will bring the breath of fresh air the USA needs after 4 years of fart stain.

Biden has to deliver a black woman on the Supreme Court,that's what he actually said he would do.He said that he would only pick a woman VP black or white.I say he should nominate Loretta Lynch for the Supreme Court.

I know all about the Kamala Harris/Willie Brown deal. I just don't think rehashing it is the BEST way to defeat Biden/Harris. I mean, that information didn't stop her in her career thus far did it? She still became a Senator, right? So, why would it work now? Focus on her record.

I would think that even Joe Biden couldn't be crazy enough to let Hillary get her foot back in the door.
That could be cultural because a Black man and a woman (HRC) that don‚Äôt bow down to white men. Whereas Biden had been in the Senate for 30+ years and was a white dude.  I‚Äôm not sure why they think this is a bombshell.
I‚Äôd love to talk to the people in charge of Biden‚Äôs Twitter...or the guy who controls his eyes.
Biden announced MONTHS ago his pick would be a woman of color. Because the Dems pander for the minority vote. She was not picked for her qualifications, experience, or accomplishments. She was chosen because of gender and color. btw, look up the definition of racism and misogyny.
Aw, shucks, folks. The Democrats could have Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd as featured speakers at their convention. I won't be watching anyway. My vote for Biden is already secured as the current best means of ridding ourselves of Donald Trump and his criminal regime
Whether Biden wins or not (and I hope he doesn't), somebody needs to put an end to the Clintons being near the White House.

EXACTLY! Biden probably referred to the Governors three times in his speech regarding the mask issue. trump is a LIAR!
And biden will do any better?
Good luck Iowans in getting help with the Dems. don't hold your breath I don't see why Biden hasn't said a word about virus help from his fellow Dems.
People who have been bothered by whataboutism the last several years are suddenly super comfortable employing it when valid criticism of Biden comes up...
Not happening. We will not comply f comotose Joe Biden
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
Maybe it makes a lot of sense.  It might (just a guess) "help" some of the more rational republicans help to vote for Biden
She should probably be kept away from biden
Jill Biden looks like she would be so much fun to hang out with...
You mean Biden, the guy who called Harris President and said it was 2021...and told black people they ain‚Äôt black if they don‚Äôt vote for him... and said Latinos were more diverse than blacks... should I go on???
Unless you got a candidate in all 50 you don't have a shot. Im no fan of biden by a stretch but if it beats trump...
Thank you Dr. Biden‚ù£Ô∏è
Joe Biden Picks His Running Mate!

She threatened Biden.
The fact that he‚Äôs still calling Biden and Harris ‚Äúradical left‚Äù makes me wonder what are Marxists and communists?
I hope it's to be proven that Obama Biden Hillary was the most corrupt group in history.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris just outlined a more thorough and smart plan to combat the pandemic than Trump has done since the outbreak started. #BuildBackBetter #BidenHarris2020
Are you really going to say things about this lady she claimed that Biden was a sex a fender and didn't let a man out of jail when he was innocent liars ate what you stand for shame on you and all the Dems. I think that there are things that will come out soon about you &amp; the Dem

‚ÄúEvery single American should be wearing a mask... for the next three months minimum.‚Äù - Joe Biden 8/13/2020
Someone tell Biden that every single Covid model has been WRONG so far. A national mask mandate? Leave it up to the governors. As for wearing mask outdoors, many of us will not comply. It‚Äôs nuts. #maskholes
Nice try! Harris is a disaster and will cost #Biden the rust belt.  Remember Sarah Palin? Yeah we kind of have that dynamic going on here.
It just shows that Biden is working harder than you trump
Telling us we do have to vote for Biden in a safe blue state just feels like ‚Äúget in line because we say so‚Äù, and that‚Äôs not how you get none voters to vote. If you want votes, you have to earn them, by pushing what people want, not just shouting against what they don‚Äôt want
But for the love of god, don‚Äôt tell people who don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden because of his very real political flaws that they MUST vote for him in a state he‚Äôs going to win anyway, NYs electoral votes aren‚Äôt on the line here, everyone knows this. We don‚Äôt have to vote for him
Patronizingly telling ‚ÄúBernie Bros‚Äù they need to vote for Biden isn‚Äôt going to get you that surge, it‚Äôs just turning those people off to voting at all. Tell them about the down ballot races with candidates they can get excited about.
I am voting Biden/Harris. But I can understand why you wouldn't, because I am an adult.

Then you know how disheartening it is to fight for things you truly believe in, have the people who could help implement them spit in your face, and then be told you need to vote for them anyway. Votes are earned. We live in NY, it‚Äôs not like Biden isn‚Äôt gonna win this state

Another reason I closed FB, suppression of free speech. FB has become a Socialist platform. God help us if Kamala becomes prez because if elected, DNC will invoke 25th Amendment before Biden's first 100 days. Kamala is probably giddy.
She is thinking about the note Hillary has signed by biden
I‚Äôm not a political person at all but from my understanding you and so many others are going to split the vote not voting for Biden and choosing Bernie or othe me candidtates with low chances of winning And it could result in Trump winning ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
You are so full of shit about President Trump. He cares more about Americans than you or Biden. You are a hypocrite by locking up people who smoke weed, yet use it yourself. America is not fooled by you. Then you called Biden a racist, yet you accept his VP pick.
And that would be incorrect.  I doubt you'll find ANYONE that states any of Joe Biden's positions on anything being more popular than Bernie Sanders'

Lets say you are right. Why is it a bad thing to avoid mail in ballots? There is fraud, interference and lost ballots. Why risk an entire election when we can do it the way it‚Äôs always worked. People act so confident in Biden‚Äôs ability to win yet want to open us up to that.

#Pirro  She said what we all are thinking: Biden isn't mentally fit to be president.  He is a pawn to get the radical left in power.  He either won't make it til election or will step down (if he wins, haha) right afterwards. Kamala will be president.
Dr. Biden, absolutely!!  The Biden and Harris team is  Win-Win team!
1point I'm unclear on is, IF Biden is elected and heaven forbid something happen where he can't fulfill his duties, is she qualified to step up and be president? If not, it would fall to Speaker of the House (Pelosi). IF that's the case, shouldn't he have chosen some1 who could
Seriously tho. Some can't vote for the lesser of two evils. Most don't even know the policies these people have or their history, yet they're expected to vote?  I mean, im voting but I understand why other niggas won't vote. What Biden gonna do for the hood? PUT MORE BLACKS AWAY?
So, a media pundit said if Biden wins, Kamala should help eradicate the Trump appointees like Saddam Hussein did with the Ba‚Äôath party in Iraq?  Yet, they complained about Trump removing prosecutorial hacks like Preet Bhara?  Trump should‚Äôve cleaned house
SO DID ANYONE HEAR TRUMP SAY IF BIDEN WINS HES GOING TO JAIL?

It‚Äôs hilarious to see Trump surrogates talk about the Biden Camp as racist or as sexual abusers when their candidate  is the biggest sexual abuser and racist to hold the office of the Presidency.

You could have made that argument for any previous presidential race. So why didn't you? Everyone knows the real answer and the real reason why you don't want Biden debating Trump.
Every time you talk about skipping presidential debates your lame excuses don't hold water. You simply realize that Biden is mentally incapable of debating not only Trump but just about anybody. Truly sad.

I don‚Äôt trust her, but I do believe she can change unlike Biden, those two being a ticket together makes absolute sense.

Why won't you answer the question? Kamala Harris said she believed Biden's accusers. Was Kamala Harris lying when she said that?

If I was Trumps campaign manager I wouldn‚Äôt let him speak again. Ever. You said Kamala phony because Biden picked her even though she didn‚Äôt support a policy from the 90s. Let‚Äôs not forget he got endorsed by Cruz who‚Äôs father plotted to kill Kennedy...
Yes, celebrating Kamala Harris and Joe Biden! üéâüëè
First off, has Biden been diagnosed with anything? Anyone with credentials diagnosed anything? Do you know of any professionals that diagnose based on 10 second Cherry picked videos? And what about my points on Trump? I guess you're cool with those actions. You Russian?

Don‚Äôt judge another person‚Äôs religious beliefs! Biden-Harris promote infanticide,anti religious legislation,same sex marriage, anti Israel, socialist agenda and open borders !
It's hilarious listening to all the things that Joe Biden says he will do as president when he did nothing worthwhile in 8 years as vice president, nor for the many other years that he's been in public service ( = living off the taxpayers).
Strong words from Harris: "He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden; And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
‚ÄúAfter being recruited to the SF District Attorney‚Äôs office, Harris cracked down on teenage prostitution in the city, reorienting law enforcement‚Äôs approach to focus on the girls as victims rather than as criminals selling sex.‚Äù
That Biden and Harris appearance was cringe
You are correct, Biden isn‚Äôt an ally.  That‚Äôs really not my point.  I think the economic harm that Trump has created will exacerbate existing problems inside communities of color.  It‚Äôs like smoking, every minute trump is in office shifts the 2053 problem closer to 2020.
Those women, if they are still alive, are in their 90‚Äôs. I think they will still vote for Biden-Harris.

It is possible to be happy about a Biden/Harris ticket and still recognize that their track record on criminal justice policy and reform is less than stellar. The reality of the moment is that the alternative to them is... what we have now.
Hell no! We want 3 debates between Trump and Biden. The feeble old fool needs to be seen as what he is: a feeble old fool with dementia.  The last thing we need in the White House is a demented Democrat!
As a suburban mom I look forward to voting for Biden/Harris

Watching the network pool feed of the Biden/Harris event - and the music playing.... is quite funky.
hey Steve can you please speak to these black folk about dragging  Kamala Harris, we need to rally together and support the Biden/Harris ticket. Please!
I'm surprised Susan Rice wasn't chosen.   We got it in the bag!!! Trump 2020!!! Kamala Harris was chosen was Biden's VP!!!
That‚Äôs the best reason to elect Biden. Besides the fact that he‚Äôs not morally bankrupt like Trump is.
If you were in the "Reagan has Alzheimer's" camp or  If you were in the "Bush wasn't smart enough" camp,  You can't be in the "Biden is perfectly fit" camp.

thank you for your comments on MSNBC, very well spoken. Such encouragement that things will and can get better with a Biden/Harris ticket.
Remember this America: Biden and Harris have NOTHING TO LOSE and EVERYTHING TO GAIN - SO - they will promise ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO VOTERS in the runup to November 3rd. America is in real danger because of The Democrat Party aided and abetted by the media.
Look for Biden and Harris to announce the following soon: If elected, on Day 1 of our administration, marijuana will be legalized nationwide, all college student loan debt will be forgiven, and we will give amnesty to all immigrants in America along with Medicare for all...
Your Wednesday funny. Including this: "Climb upon Geraldine Ferraro's and my shoulders, and from the most amazing view in your life consider lessons we learned."   Bahahahahaha. I picture Team Biden/Harris getting a good chuckle out of this one.
She does have the full support of the marijuana lobby and there is every certainty that if Biden and her are elected, marijuana will be legalized nationwide. Look for Biden and her to also promise college loan debt amnesty and immigration amnesty nationwide on Day 1.

That is probably going to be a prudent move and I will  likely do so as well. Of course, we may see the market begin to tank in response to fake polls showing a Biden-Harris victory so we may need to take action sooner rather than later...

When Biden announced that his veep would have ovaries we knew he was fishing in a very small pond. So he hooked, Harris.  Quite a catch.

It‚Äôs a tough call. The carnival barker is barely coherent at this stage, so there‚Äôs that spectacle to highlight. Biden should say he‚Äôll only debate if the sociopath releases his tax returns.
We were told that in 2016 with HRC, and it's unspoken this year, with the  platform that disregards any of the things that progressives considered important. Biden hasn't budged on his stance on healthcare or policing. Biden bros are in everybody's posts saying it.

I guarantee, if Biden wins (and that's a big if) Bernie will be the first to call him out on every horrible stance and policy. But for 3+ years they vilified progressives bc they hated him for daring to oppose "Her," and it cost progressive candidates. So he's playing along.

Focusing on the forest, would be flipping the Senate. But putting Biden up against Trump - 2 dementia patients with sexual assault allegations who don't give a damn about PoC - and making his running mate one of the worst AGs CA ever had, that's just fueling the forest fire.

I'm rly off private twitter bc I do not know what to do abt this election. Can yall tell me who you're voting for and why? I don't wanna vote for Biden but like in a 2 party system do I have another option?? I can't just NOT voteüò© helpüò≠
Can't believe Joe Biden picked Maya Rudolph for VP!
Polls MAY say and show Biden is leading but remember there are hundreds or maybe thousands of people who sat out last time, those non voters WILL make the difference, spread the word towards anyone who is still considering not voting.
All women should be outraged at Trump‚Äôs response to Biden‚Äôs pick of a woman. Come to think about it, all men should be outraged at Trump‚Äôs response.
Donald Trump is terrible for America.  Joe Biden isn't much better. But when you're at the bottom (which America is, don't fucking kid yourself), you have to start the climb somewhere.

HISTORIC VP CHOICE: Joe Biden has picked Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate. She is the first woman of color ever on a major party's presidential ticket. Harris has represented California in the U.S. Senate since 2017, after serving as AG of California and DA of San Francisco
wow biden chose kamala harris yal are screwed
With Kamala Harris comes a lot of controversy, did Joe Biden make the correct decision? Pass it on.
Y‚Äôall can be mad, just vote for Biden. Thanks.
I just spent almost $100 on Biden-Harris merch

#Presidential hopeful  has announced his running mate ‚Äî Sen.  .
Joe Biden could've picked a pineapple with Mr. Potato head face pieces as his running mate, and I still would vote for him over Trump.  If that bothers you, fuck yourself.
What happens when biden gets covid and you know , then what
We gotta get him out. I‚Äôm not happy with the choices but Trump has to go. There needs to be someone who is less divisive and try to bring people together. They can say what they want about Biden, but don‚Äôt act like our current president doesn‚Äôt lie every day.

Just caught "President" Trump's remarks and an advisor must've told him Biden-Harris would be a much tougher opponent than Clinton-Kaine (to whom he lost the popular vote).  He was throwing all his bullshit tropes at the wall and not one stuck. He knows he's screwed.
Biden been da deal breaker but they gon let him slide cuz he vp to obama
Republican Party of Virginia weighs in on Joe Biden's pick for V.P. Chairman Jack Wilson says, "Kamala Harris exemplifies the worst parts of the Democratic Party: petty fighting, grandstanding, putting Party before People, and flip-flopping on almost every issue." #13NewsNow
Harris is too moderate &amp; has no advantage with geography or demographics. Biden should‚Äôve picked Whitmer, Duckworth, Rice, Warren, Tlaib, or Ocasi√≥-Cortez.
Under any under circumstances a Biden/Harris ticket would have a 0% chance to win the White House, but it's Trump so anything goes.  Stay home, don't vote.

Wondering why people are tweeting about Biden making such a great choice of #KamalaHarris for VP. Do they really think #Biden had anything to do with it? They hate each other. Progressive left won, she was their choice. Bye, bye Democratic party.
The question begs if Biden is a racist why would she want to be his partner and running mate.
I‚Äôm all in... love her  with that being said I would still vote Biden if he chose a goldfish cracker
it was hard enough voting for biden but now they're just being cruel
Well, I was wrong. Biden picked Dog Faced Pony Soldier instead of Rice. I predicted incorrectly. You all get a refund for every penny you paid me. üòâ
i'd be more worried about Biden &amp; the Ukraine
Best choice Biden Harris
Okay, let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs true. At this point it‚Äôs too late, but continuing to bring this up reduces Biden‚Äôs chance by pushing people away from him as a candidate.

Look man, I see people complaining about Biden but the unfortunate fact is, if you DON'T vote for him, you're allowing 4 more years of Trump's America.  Just like, get off your moral highhorse pls?You know why they cleared the room so quickly. Even if you won't admit it. His team is terrified of what nonsense will come out of Biden's mouth if he has to answer a question off the top of his head.
Joe Biden is 77....... bruh why the fuck are we allowing this?! Lmaoooooo oh fuck we are FUCKED...
Maybe Biden can take my dog with him
Finally was able to watch your show ladies and as usual, was great. It's funny how the Socialist Dems will change their tunes when it fits their needs. Obama said Hillary wasn't fit to run her own house let alone the W.H. &amp; Kamala says  Biden is a racist yet they team up.ü§î
First Black Democrat Woman Vice Presidential Candidate... "Karma L.A. Harrass" What's in a name? Bad Karma by any other name is still Bad Karma. Joe Biden picked a VP who accused him of Racism &amp; Sexism: who slept her way to the top &amp; jailed 15,000 Blacks for minor drug charges?

Biden has to deliver a black woman on the Supreme Court,that's what he actually said he would do.He said that he would only pick a woman VP black or white.I say he should nominate Loretta Lynch for the Supreme Court.
Agreed, but assuming Biden wins, kamala will have a bigger shot in 2024

Duck Hannity and trump! We will vote trump out and his republicans cronies ! Vote biden and Harris 2020!
Do you really believe Biden/Harris are every bit as racist, corrupt, narcissistic, sexist, dishonest, delusional, anti-scientific, authoritarian, theocratic, and venal as Trump?  No?   Then your choice is clear.
Oh, sure, if Biden wins, we "will maybe never know who won," but if you win (God forbid), *then* how much will you contest the results?

In fact, they polled 1,105 citizens in each of the 7 cities of Hampton Roads. More than 90% who said they voted for Clinton in 2016 said that they would vote for Biden in 2020. 80.2% who said they voted for Trump in 2016 said that they planned to vote for him in 2020. #13NewsNow
you going to ask Biden about lying all the time or nah?
I‚Äôd love to talk to the people in charge of Biden‚Äôs Twitter...or the guy who controls his eyes.
Biden announced MONTHS ago his pick would be a woman of color. Because the Dems pander for the minority vote. She was not picked for her qualifications, experience, or accomplishments. She was chosen because of gender and color. btw, look up the definition of racism and misogyny.

Telling us we do have to vote for Biden in a safe blue state just feels like ‚Äúget in line because we say so‚Äù, and that‚Äôs not how you get none voters to vote. If you want votes, you have to earn them, by pushing what people want, not just shouting against what they don‚Äôt want
But for the love of god, don‚Äôt tell people who don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden because of his very real political flaws that they MUST vote for him in a state he‚Äôs going to win anyway, NYs electoral votes aren‚Äôt on the line here, everyone knows this. We don‚Äôt have to vote for him

Biden, Harris, the Democrats.  Have you not been paying attention?  They are not even trying to hide it. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #DemocratsHateAmerica
I just think it‚Äôs funny how much niggas was riding for Joe Biden when he was Obama‚Äôs homeboy VP... all the memes inviting him to cookouts and spades tables and now this
You are being lied to. Look up all of the things that Trump has done to elevate the black community in just the last 3 years. Then look up all the racist anti-segregation stances Biden has stood for and voted for over the last 40 years. Don‚Äôt let them tell you how to think.
How many people believe that Basement Biden plagiarized Trump's campaign slogans, but just put a cheap spin on it? Show of hands. üôå üôåüôå
Absolutely. Joe Biden is a communist. He's paid for by the Chinese Communist party. If everybody understands that he's a communist maybe they won't vote for him. But he is a communist.
A great choice for basement Biden. He can't come out of the closet &amp; she loves coming out in every gay-pride parade. She's right up there with Maxine Waters, AOC, Ilhan Omar, &amp; Nancy Pelosi.ü§¢ Trump should start planning his inauguration now.üá∫üá≤TRUMP2020üá∫üá∏
Except for during the debates, Biden shouldn't mention Trump at all. He should just start acting like he's already the president.   There is nothing Trump hates more than being ignored.
Trump and Biden is like picking between getting hit by a FedEx truck or ups truck
Biden and his running mate are the wolves dressed up as sheep
Anyone Biden picks is a concern. I'm just surprised it wasn't one of the Marxist BLM leaders. I guess they're too busy working for Obama &amp; Soros. Kind of like Satan's ground soldiers.
CNN needs to go after Biden in the same shameful way they went after Tucker!
I think they‚Äôre doing this so we take our attention off how in capable Joe Biden is it‚Äôs a trick!!! If we‚Äôre attacking her we‚Äôre not attacking the man that will be president! #thinksmart
Another person that doesn't know how to look at the full statement and likes to cherry pick to fit their agenda. How many times does this have to be debunked before the left let it sink in. OH, should we look at Biden's comments and history? Yeah, didn't think so.
At least that Japanese performed Seppuku after they were captured, but during the battle, it‚Äôs a different strategy. Biden is dumb, Harris is smug, but a death cult might be a bit worse. The choice is yours, but when I was homeless and starving I didn‚Äôt holdout for filet and lobs
Ummmm Biden is crazy
Just to let you know that thanks to #Tucker tonight on Fox , he just made sure that Joe Biden will be winning the Presidency in 2020 !! I am a Republican but what he and his guest did tonight was so disguesting, when you lose be sure to call him and thank him !
Sorts is more danger to America than Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Knee pad Harris.
remove Biden's lies!!!

$26 million raised in 1st 24 hours of Biden-Harris ticket
I‚Äôm hearing Biden and Harris‚Äô speeches were well received in Thighland...
She's very centrist as is Biden.
Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Kamala Harris?:    Only 75% of Democrats favor her.  Only 25% Independents favor her. 6% Repubs do.  Not a win-win for Biden.
Biden has told you who his cabinet will be??? ... doubtful
sounds as if you thought  was making the case that  wasn‚Äôt gonna make it to Election Day because he‚Äôd be replaced politically. Surely she couldn‚Äôt be suggesting Biden might be dead before Election Day? Thats exactly what she was implying. Sick
And y‚Äôall think Biden is the creep? ü§¢
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris assail Trump as they campaign together for the first time
Biden was a rapist not a criminal with a minor drug possession charge. Of course she is with him.
Funny how your thoughts change when she is starting to blow Biden and his campaign.
Biden is the reason even more brothas got locked up during Obama's reign and obamacare itself is shitty
Trump says it‚Äôs ‚ÄúA dangerous choice‚Äù for Kamala to be Biden‚Äôs running mate...well duh! Of course because she‚Äôs gonna put you behind bars!üëçüèæüòÜüíØ
OAN.   Nice.   Antifa/Biden    Riff begins.
Ugh....cant listen to Biden....its cringeworthy.  You just anticipate him saying something moronic.  And Kamala....has there EVER been two bigger posers than those two?  Honestly, why the hell would dems choose someone even more unlikable than Hillary?  #lessonnotlearned #MAGA
In other words they know Trump will lose so they trying suggest to voters that it's not Biden your voting for but it will eventually be Kamala that's going to be your President.
After seeing this I realized I had forgotten what basic human decency looks like among our leaders...  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Don‚Äôt judge another person‚Äôs religious beliefs! Biden-Harris promote infanticide,anti religious legislation,same sex marriage, anti Israel, socialist agenda and open borders !
Strong words from Harris: "He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden; And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
You are correct, Biden isn‚Äôt an ally.  That‚Äôs really not my point.  I think the economic harm that Trump has created will exacerbate existing problems inside communities of color.  It‚Äôs like smoking, every minute trump is in office shifts the 2053 problem closer to 2020.
Those women, if they are still alive, are in their 90‚Äôs. I think they will still vote for Biden-Harris.
White rioters are calling Black people bootlickers in Portland, all you have to do is watch a live feed at night. It‚Äôs an Tifa, and all the money now goes to Biden‚Äòs campaign for Black Lives Matter!!

Waiting to see Biden/Harris together on CSNBC‚ù£Ô∏è
please speak to these negative comments about the Biden/Harris ticket. Please Steve, it‚Äôs ridiculous.
It is possible to be happy about a Biden/Harris ticket and still recognize that their track record on criminal justice policy and reform is less than stellar. The reality of the moment is that the alternative to them is... what we have now.
Hell no! We want 3 debates between Trump and Biden. The feeble old fool needs to be seen as what he is: a feeble old fool with dementia.  The last thing we need in the White House is a demented Democrat!
Watching the network pool feed of the Biden/Harris event - and the music playing.... is quite funky.
hey Steve can you please speak to these black folk about dragging  Kamala Harris, we need to rally together and support the Biden/Harris ticket. Please!
That‚Äôs the best reason to elect Biden. Besides the fact that he‚Äôs not morally bankrupt like Trump is.
If you were in the "Reagan has Alzheimer's" camp or  If you were in the "Bush wasn't smart enough" camp,  You can't be in the "Biden is perfectly fit" camp.
Joe Biden is a uhh you know uhh the thing.
Emerson: Trump, Biden in virtual tie in ‚Ä¶ Minnesota?
Emerson: Trump, Biden in virtual tie in ‚Ä¶ Minnesota?
That would be amazing! She was the only sane candidate in the Dem primaries. Had Biden chosen her, it would have been a tough election campaign. Thankfully, as the ad asserts, he's not that smart.
I am First Lady Bidenüíô‚ù§
Biden wasn‚Äôt even willing to walk back the crime bill lmfao he died on that hill. even Clinton was like aye that shit was a lil ODBiden/Harris 2020 will look great next to this.
So  how his the Biden Harris ticket doing with nontraditional campaigning?  I'm hoping its enough.
Why? Trump is making Biden‚Äôs Cade for him.
Its so obvious she is fake, has no intention of delivering on her words....She and Biden are destined to destroy the US....very odd how the American electorate could even contemplate voting for them!? Crazy!
Let me try, He was VP for 8 years and Obama still didn‚Äôt think he would be the best choice for POTUS that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt endorse him.  He wants no responsibility for Biden.  Imagine if you were assistant coach for 8 years and head coach doesn‚Äôt endorse you for the head coach
Or with a Yorkshire accent: If Obama did this, they would speak o'nowt else. Biden could NEVER do it!  #MakeYorkshireGreatAgain #YorkshireDT

A reminder of what blind partisanship brings you.  The biggest single attack on the USPS was the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which was supported by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden.  And those "Obama appointees" wanted to cut even MORE usps jobs.
Did you guys get your Russian criminal partners to ‚Äúreveal‚Äù dirt on Biden?  Nobody cares.  And nobody believes you anymore
How is this different than the Postal Workers union endorsing Biden?
And, yet, still a better candidate than Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton.
Because he doesn‚Äôt lie. And no president puts himself out in front of the press as much as you have. You think you are a TV star. Stay behind the scenes and you won‚Äôt have the questions. Oh. And there is this little pandemic that you have totally messed up. Biden follows science!
I haven't a clue who Mr John YetAnotherWhiteGuy Rentoul is, but he obviously has never seen Kamala Harris in action. She's a force to be reckoned w/, whatever her gender or ethnicity. Biden's going into a street fight &amp; he's chosen well.
Biden over there doodling on all the margins on his test paper like I did in elementary school
Joe Biden did what he was told to do!  100 black male Democrats demanded Biden pick a black female Democrat as his Veep. Or, blacks would abandon the Democrat party.
The Biden-Harris ticket isn't perfect. No ticket ever was and no ticket ever will be. Perhaps, for whatever reason, Vice President Biden and/or Senator Harris don't pass your purity test. Just know this, they will be much better than four more years of Trump.
I know we can't all agree on everything. Now, this is a two candidate race Biden or Trump. Those are our only choices. One of them will be our President as a result of this election.
Now that the Democratic President-Vice President ticket is set, and Vice President Biden with Senator Harris are going to be the Democratic ticket on the November ballot, I figured now is a good time to remind everyone that:
They don't want Biden to do any interviews but they will want the Pence-Harris debate. Trouble is one presidential debate is scheduled--9/29--before the VP debate on October 7. What will they do? Will Biden debate on 9/29?
His first shot is 2024 and if the Dems lose this year he'll be in a better position than she will. So, will the California governor be rooting for Biden-Harris this year?
It‚Äôs called progressing.  Generally a hallmark of a non Conservative viewpoint. Biden‚Äôs views have also moved further left than previously.
Nothing like that was in the cards 4 years ago. There's a decent chance that if Biden has a good night he wins Texas. As a Democrat.
She wasn‚Äôt rejected.  She wasn‚Äôt the 1st choice for President.  However, due to the support of black women in electing Biden, Kamala makes the perfect compliment for Dem representation.  Plus she‚Äôs the most effective in pinning down GOP liars.
Whitest white here with a college degree, definitely Biden
The stupidest, least informed president in history is "Biden doesn't even know the countries i'm talking about"  -- Trumpy The Stupid.   I can guarantee Biden knows more about international issues than trumpy will ever not care enough to learn, he can't even pronounce the names.
The only strategy that traitor &amp; murderer üçä45's campaign has it to berate &amp; belittle Biden &amp; Harris. How sad &amp; weak is that?! It's not going to work this time! üçä45 is already acting like a sore loser!!üåäüá∫üá∏üá≤üáΩüò∑
Biden I think made it official yesterday.
As much as i love what she did, what Mikey Cohen says in his upcoming book will do will be much, much worse.  Billy Barr tried to silence him by throwing him back in prison.    Will Billy Barr pull a putin and throw joe biden in prison right before the election?

Yeah, the lesser of the two evils. I‚Äôm assuming Biden will most likely die before his term is up. Of course assuming he wins.
Trumpy has billy barr investigating Joe Biden, so he can do what putin does.  Fabricate an excuse to arrest Joe Biden so trump can run unopposed.  Because if there's not a candidate to run against him he will win by "98%' of the vote, just like his bestie Vlad.  Democracy ending.

MSM going Biden crazy I say let's give a big I'm  backing TRUMP Message
Have to say that I am VERY surprised that they're this off message and upprepared.  Just another sign that Trump is incompetent.
It‚Äôs not just the shade of skin or country of origin. Biden summed up many ‚Äòliberals‚Äô attitudes to people of colour when he said a black Trump supporter ‚Äúain‚Äôt black‚Äù. You see the same in the ‚Äòuncle Tom‚Äô narrative from the left in the UK towards anyone of colour who is a Tory.
Would go for Biden, but after all the destruction brought about by Antifas, I am now 100% for Trump!
I‚Äôm considering it an awesome Biden/Harris song. Gonna go listen now!  #ElectricAvenue  üíôüíôüíô
Its the smile - she is so intelligent and confident. Wonderful for the people of the USA if Biden wins.
"This openness has also extended to the policy process that has been undertaken in the wake of the fight for the nomination. Since May, Biden‚Äôs team has been working in six policy task forces on the economy, healthcare, immigration, criminal justice, climate and education."
"Once again, the pragmatist (Biden) has revealed an openness to new ways that some might have thought beyond him."
Trump will take this election to a new low.
"‚ÄúThis morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up, especially little black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued. Today, just maybe, they‚Äôre seeing themselves for the first time in a new way,‚Äù Biden said."
Given the fact its not Democratic voters and resisters you need to win over but no voters or "swing" voters. She was great talking about Biden's character though. The emotion in her voice when she spoke of Beau Biden and how he'd told stories of his father was audible + authentic
So you're saying Biden's willing to do hard work for the US?  Really put his back into it?  As opposed to....you
Thank you so much for not being hostile with your reply. I do understand the situation of Biden supporters. I do. I admit: he is SIGNIFICANTLY better than what we have now and I‚Äôm not saying DONT vote for him. At this point, I‚Äôm saying please understand ME.
So why did Joe Biden mangle her name today when he was introducing her?  To disrespect her?
On top of that just like with clinton, when it seems like a lesser of 2 evil candidates is going to win from polls then voter turnout will be low. People aren‚Äôt enthusiastic about voting biden, so they aren‚Äôt going to vote if they feel like the lesser evil already has it.
If you‚Äôre going to vote for biden keep your lips sealed. Don‚Äôt vote for him in polls. Make the dem party scared they‚Äôre going to lose. That is the ONLY way we MIGHT get progressive concessions. Idc if you‚Äôre vote blue no matter who, at least make it seem like you aren‚Äôt.
Americans can be so fucking weird. Imagine giving so much of a fuck about whether or not Joe Biden really is a Catholic?
I must apologize.   I went out and told a bunch of people that Harris was a crooked cop. That is not true. I was wrong and I apologize.   Biden‚Äôs choice of VP was not a cop. Just a bootlicker.
According to Biden a massive crowd    means more than he can count with his hands. He was so impressed to see more than several people waiting for him and Kamala.
Just watched the debut of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris together for the first time as a ticket, Biden-Harris. Most Definitely Approve.

They tried to fact-check me on Nancy Pelosi saying "China would prefer Joe Biden."  They tried to say she didn't say that, but the post I shared from  literally has video footage of her saying it!
I get Harris but Biden was a public defender so the opposite of what Harris was doing.  After he was a public defender, he became US Senator.  Just FYI
Can't wait to see what position you are offered after Biden wins and he corrects all the terrible wrongs the trump regime did to the best, most patriotic people.  Sec of the Army sounds about right.
BBC News - Biden's VP pick: Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots
I went from ‚ÄúMeh, Joe Biden, okay, fine‚Äù to ‚ÄúSh*t finally got interesting!‚Äù #BidenHarris2020
Biden/Harris, then? OK. Can't say I'm happy with either's track record. They're conservative enough to appeal to some Republican demographics. BUT they're not Trump, and might play by the rules.  I'm not American, but they or Trump will have their hands on our leash soon enough.
Love that Biden chose Harris:  She's smart, tough, has experience in an executive branch (Atty Gen'l of CA), and the legislative branch (Senator) which ideally suits her for VP.  She's a killer debater as well.  I'm excited about this ticket!!
Trump supporters using morality, cognitive degeneration, questionable sexual behaviours to attack Biden is a bizarre self-own that they still don't get.
t'‚Äúsuburban housewife‚Äù will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended t'long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, wi'Corey Booker in charge!
‚ÄúHarris reflects something we take for granted in this circling of the drain we call politics in the Trump era: she looks and sounds presidential because she is‚Äù
But also the issue for her was profile... this is how to get her profile and credentials up. Did Biden pick her OR did the Democratic leadership? If the latter then you can see they are looking to secure their future.
Oh my. Another "nasty woman."  And look at Biden choosing her because he's not afraid of a woman who stands up for herself. He chose a woman who is strong, independent, who will call him out if he deserves it and who is not afraid of a fight.  Because Biden isn't a pussy.
Here comes hope!  "Biden‚Äôs VP pick ‚Äòmakes America look more like America‚Äô ‚Äì and now Harris is better placed than anyone to be the first female president"
She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Joe Biden picks his VP no she was picked for him - A friend of mine who has lived in the USA for many years only said yesterday BEFORE the announcement it would be a black female with Biden stepping down in around 18mth and her not only 1st female but 1st black female president
‚ÄúHer own life story is one that I and so many others can see in ourselves,‚Äù Obama said in a statement on Tuesday. ‚ÄúA story that says that no matter where you come from, what you look like, how you worship, or who you love, there‚Äôs a place for you here.‚Äù
In choosing Kamala Harris, Biden may have found the anti-Trump
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate in historic first for a woman of color
BIden has a set of viewpoints.  He‚Äôs pragmatic.  He wants good outcomes.  He‚Äôs not a revolutionary.  He‚Äôs he can be moved left.
If I was Biden, I'd want the furniture in there disinfected before sitting down. Trumpelstiltzkin probably farts and dumps himself all the time. His baby diaper is overflowing with contempt.
I KNOW KAMALA AND BIDEN ARE TRASH BUT THEY ARE BETTER THAN TRUMP, STOP TELLING PEOPLE NOT TO VOTE FOR THEM, IF YALL WANT SOME SORT OF CHANGE AND THINGS TO GET BETTER, VOTE BLUE
I'm not on Team Biden, but I'll vote for him, because I totally understand the ramifications of not.
You think this is gonna get Republicans on the fence to vote for Biden?
I keep seeing people go "Well, I'm definitely NOT voting Biden NOW!" Yeah, so you're totally fine if Trump wins losing RBG's seat on the Supreme Court and stacking it towards the right's favor? Because that's the risk more than any one person.
Dear ‚Å¶ the heck are you trying to say with this headline? Seriously? ü§¨ #CasualRacism  Biden's VP pick: Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots
Checked the thread. Egregiously so. I was just feeling the vibe of Biden's announcement.
It's just an example. I don't know what you want from this election. All's I'm saying is that Biden is the best chance we have to throw 45 out of the white house and into a jail cell.
What do you expect Biden to do? Build you a freaking mansion? I got news for you, honey. He's not going to be able to do that.
Let's go! #BidenHarris2020
Reminder, because I know a lot of y'all are all torn up about the Biden/Harris ticket -- if you stop pushing, you start getting pushed. There is ONLY forward. Keep your head, eyes, and fist UP.
Biden is a devot Catholic
Warren as Senate Majority leader. We could make this happen without electing Biden.
She is a senator from a dependably Democratic state. She has strong law and order bona fides. And she is capable of verbally eviscerating her opponents. The VP debates cannot come soon enough. Harris can be the attack dog while Biden stays the nice guy.
I can‚Äôt believe that of all the eligible Democrats in this country, the best the party could do was Biden/Harris.  Will I vote for them? Yeah, because Trump needs to go. But I‚Äôm not gonna be happy about it. I‚Äôm not gonna feel good about it in any way, really.
He‚Äôs deranged, it‚Äôs been quite obvious for years. He‚Äôs not normal, it‚Äôs plain to see. But what‚Äôs almost as sad, is you‚Äôve got Biden as the alternative. US politics is becoming an anecdote. #borisisalazybastard and #trump is a loon
It is called a press conference, something Biden doesn't do, and Trump responded to a question.
go home Mr Biden
She's a good choice. I like the sound of Biden-Harris.
Lol! She‚Äôs locked up so many black people. Biden didn‚Äôt do his HW. He just saw color
Being at one time on the receiving end of Harris' attacks, I think Biden wants to release that rage on Trump and Pence both. He can remain the good guy.
Joe Biden isn't his own man. Has NO CHOICE but to pick a black female Democrat because 100 black male Democrat ORDERED Biden to do so or risk black flight from Democrat party.
Keep your ears tuned. Biden &amp; Harris: the Gaffe Gurus!
And yes, I just ordered a yard sign and contributed to the Biden/Harris campaign.
Over-under on the number of months before Biden resigns over health issues.
I do think it's lose/lose but change my mind bro. Biden been in that bitch 50 years.
Biden confirmed it just now.
Yes!!!!! Excellent news! üåüüåüüåü Well done    BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
To the Biden campaign.  Text 30330 was late sending messages.
This is actually brilliant.  And driving Trump absolutely NUTS.  He wants to have this kind of rapt attention and Biden is just letting it hang...
Biden only has 7 million.
Biden knows. üôÇ  Even if he didn‚Äôt realize this on his own, he has some savvy advisers!
Right now, in this post George Floyd era, he MUST pick a black woman.  I really love Gretchen Witmer and feel she'd be fantastic as VP, but so was Amy K who withdrew with a mandate that Biden pick a black woman.  Trumpers wouldn't vote for Biden if he was anointed Pope. #Itstime
Well, whoever it is WILL be taking over before Biden has any chance at all of finishing his first and only term.
Should we compare current 1st lady naked and next 1st lady never naked?  Should we compare lying current 1st lady's 'einstein visa' with next 1st lady's medical degree? Should we compare current 1st lady's "BE Best" or plagiarism claims and Dr. Jill Biden's decades of healing.
I want to believe that there's a speaking slot for any and all pets of the Biden family
Absolute loony tune! The sooner Biden gets in the better!
People getting angry about this are just bored.  Just because this is an atypical election doesn't mean Biden should forgo the time he has to vet. Picking a Veep early doesn't make the election come sooner or benefit the campaign in any way.
You‚Äôre going to vote Democrat no matter who Biden chooses.
And he says Joe Biden has dementia.
Biden is ALSO a fascist.  Being a petite fascist is still being a fascist.
I'm catching up with you. You've been backed my L.Graham, ur good with 2A, farming, life - all great stuff, even the dirty shirt, and you're focusing the blame for the virus on China, just like Trump, so please don't do anything that threaten us into a Biden "leadership." ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è
The USA rank #10 in COVID death globally per million and we talk as if we are the worst country in the world even though we have the most obese people in the world   Remove 1/2 the BS deaths from NY and NJ then miraculously we look real good  Facts are skewed to give Biden the WH
Under control. Who makes him take his meds? Who critiques his performance?  A lot of MAGAs will tell you Biden is on his way out mentally too but even if he was, the people around him work for the Greater Good, not the glorification of their master  Face on Mount Rushmore indeed
I don't give a fuck if Kamala Harris unfollowed or didn't unfollow Biden, nor do I give a fuck who Bidens VP pick is. I'm tired #WAP #derecho #coronavirus #IRS #garybusey
My guess is that it's all made up to bring attention back to him and stir up support. He'll claim it was a Biden supporter and all the people on the fence will vote for Trump out of shock and sympathy.
Can we compare the stuff that happened under Obama and what happened under Trump?    Of course the last question was a totally rigged question for him to claim treason on Obama and Biden.  It's not going to work donny.
That should be his campaign slogan. Biden: Come on, man!
I feel that too. Trump and Johnson are the bottom corner blocks in a jenga tower. Take one out and it becomes unstable, both out and it falls. Here's hoping Biden will take the first block out.
You said Biden is corrupt. We want data. Sources. Citations.  Ranting doesn‚Äôt count.  Show us something worth paying attention to and we‚Äôll pay attention.   Sorry if that sounds quirky to you, but that‚Äôs how we  roll.
Watching 'Iraq' documentary shows just how weak and dangerous Obama was...Biden would be even worse......Trump has to be re-elected otherwise theres more trouble ahead.
I hope we have defunded violent police and are exploring other options by then. But yes, I will be voting Biden.
If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden.  You won‚Äôt have to worry about making a choice next time.
He‚Äôs exactly the same is he‚Äôs always been.  He‚Äôs a little goofy but still serious when he needs to be.  And better than the current criminal in chief by miles.  If you don‚Äôt want Trump forever, you best vote Biden
US passes 5m Covid-19 cases as Joe Biden says pandemic 'breaks heart'
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Joe Biden in his own words: "If you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut."
I‚Äôm a Centrist that‚Äôs been force to watch the worst of both Biden and Trump ads. Biden isn‚Äôt mentally capable of taking office. If you‚Äôve been around people with dementia it‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôs in the early stages. Trump, Trump is just an ass. A well meaning one, but still an ass.
Russia &amp; Trump/Kanye West, the latter having publicly admitted to voter fraud by saying he's only doing it to take votes away from Biden to help Trump. You've got to put a spending cap on political funding of hundreds of thousands, not billions, not millions, to include the poor.
So that Biden is left with the headache and gets the blame.
Biden can't remember where he put the signs
Yes, but... As a Brit foreign policy pro: Biden's a foreign policy fool. Never met an issue he didn't mis-analogise or misunderstand.   Although... Rice is just wrong-headed.  So... Pick Kamala. And let the foreign policy process push back when Biden's wrong. He'll listen.
Just curious, how many times did donny trump go to church in his entire, pathetic life that he didn't HAVE to go?    Joe Biden went to church almost every Sunday if he could.  Yet trump claims Joe hates God?  What kind of sick piece of crap attacks another mans faith?  Sickening.
donny has a serious set of problems.. Funny he's got so many cognitive issues and trump says Biden does.. Projection..
YES! LMFAO  ! EVERYONE HATES BIDEN!!!
Trump's ranting about his wall and Biden wanting to remove it so "ILLEGALS" can breeze right in.  Everything trump lies about is what he is doing himself.  Maybe a few new miles of wall, but mostly just renovations.  LIE LIE LIE.. when trump is burning in hell, his tombstone: LIE
They watched last minute reopening of HRC emails tank her numbers. He's planning to spew last minute Ukraine BS as NEW INFORMATION to tank Biden's numbers hoping there won't be time to effectively refute it before election. Hopefully last minute lawsuit results will tank Trump.
Trump is saying exactly what he himself is going to do.  Crying Chuck Schumer.  He's really the most vile piece of crap ever.  He's lying about 276 miles of walls.  He's done nearly ZERO new miles.  Biden is going to tear the walls down..  How is it he's allowed to lie so much?
Joe has no idea what he's doing-he's desperate. The US deep down knows you're the man to MAGA. The left try hard but hopefully when the time comes the US electorate will see Biden is a fake-determined to ruin the economy for the sake of it.
Or with a Yorkshire accent: Sleepy Joe Biden just agreed wi'the Radical Left Democrats t'raise Taxes by Three Trillion Dollars. Everyone will pay - Will kill your Stocks, 401k‚Äôs, and the ECONOMY. BIG CRASH!  #MAGA #MakeYorkshireGreatAgain #YorkshireDT

gym jordan would be calling for biden's impeachment.
And the Palin example is different, as that was a matter of actual campaign policy. Biden certainly hasn't established an official policy of shitting on Democratic women. It's not like Symone Sanders is giving press conferences attacking any of these candidates.
Because the Veep is being chosen at the same time as normal, right before the convention? Seriously?  "I was gonna help save the republic from fascism, but Biden didn't give me a Veep months before he was nominated."
We don't know when Biden picked his running mate, either.
What did Biden say? Was it a coded statement? Apparently I am not intelligent enough to decode it even if I have a PhD degree.
Biden's promises are worth even less than his policies  Gonna be hard to yank the rug out from under us if we refuse to stand on it
It‚Äôs astounding that saying ‚ÄúJesus is King‚Äù apparently equals ‚Äúsiphoning votes from Biden.‚Äù I wonder what Biden would make of that interpretation... üßê
The end of covi-19 is not timed. Neither vaccine or medication will bring it end.The election is not an occasion to fight or celebrate.Trump winning will take the nation to nowhere except worse,Biden winning will need four+ years to clean up and turn the arrow up if he could.C'mon man! Biden gets a pass on everything.
The Joe Biden kind.
Has your hatred of Trump seriously blinded you to the fact Joe Biden is complete trash ? Y‚Äôall talk about Trump being so god damn racist but the only one I‚Äôve seen rambling about black stereotypes is Biden. Check your white ‚Äúprivilege ‚Äú
They will play hell doing that since most of the world has closed its borders to Americans
How about ‚ÄúHiden Biden!‚Äù
I wonder what Twitters gonna say if Biden wins and everybody starts complaining and trashing him. What defense will people have if Trump is out of office? I don‚Äôt really know anyone that‚Äôs pro-Biden, just people that are anti-Trump
Get a gripe on reality.  No brain Biden will not save you.

Biden is very pro-Irish. He‚Äôs predicted to win in November. If Johnson screws with the GFA, a FTA will be toast.
Joe Biden accomplishments in his nearly 50 years in politics could fit on the head of a pin. He had 8 years working with Obama to "bring people together" but didn't. AND...he had all his marbles then.   You two don't stand a chance in November.  #Trump2020

Y‚Äôall hate Trump and Biden. Who else y‚Äôall gonna vote for if not one of them
Should‚Äôve been Bernie/Tulsi but now I gotta watch Joe Biden get utterly obliterated on the debate floorüíÄ
Thank you for that. Sorry. Very passionate about this.... The votes of black folks are always good enough to bail out the democratic party when they're in a jam, but then we're rewarded with Whitmer pics? Really?  Joe Biden said "Thank You" , to US, tonight.*  Very emotional. üá∫üá∏
For the record, the choice was clear (to some of us) while ya'll were out here posting pictures of Gretchen Whitner and Biden, thinking that was cute.*   But nevertheless, we digress. Our point has been proven. Better late than never. Your welcome  Onward to victory
I‚Äôm gonna vote for Biden/Harris so fucking hard omg
Aren't most of those people spending far more of their time criticizing Biden?
Congrats to "scrappy Kam"  Harris on being selected as Biden's VP. Get your fighting stance on girl! I am so proud of you because you look like me !
Trump claims he would have beaten George Washington in election while bragging about non-existent poll numbers  #news #feedly
I remember you saying she seemed a good candidate , your beautiful country deserves so much better than the liar you have at the moment and I will be wishing the Biden Harris ticket all the luck in the world in November.
That being said Biden still the best and ONLY choice but ion feel good about this shit at all
I wouldn't care if he picks Mitt Romney. I'm still voting for Biden!!
Because Trump hid in the WH ‚Äúsafe room‚Äù in the basement and got made fun of so he is trying to turn his ridicule on to Biden. It‚Äôs not working
To be sure. In fact, should Biden win, you'll see the number go to zero.
(Not that you'll respond but...)  A friendly reminder that without the black electorate, of which black women are the absolute bedrock, and comprise the loyal base of the dem party, you (as in Chris) would not have Biden to brag about at this moment.  Hence, the pick will Harris.
With mail-in voting, everybody in that shot is going to somehow cast their vote for Biden.
(Someone's scared of Biden.... guess being sleepy ain't so bad after all, huh? üòÇüòÇ)
Biden's gaffs &amp; ineptitude.
Do you guys not realize that this is not cute?  This is Iowa / NH redux. White folks, for whatever the reason, do not understand the needs of the black electorate, and in particular black women, who are the base of the dem party. WE haulted Bernie in SC, GIVING YOU BIDEN.*
Seeing as how Biden has promised to shutdown coal &amp; steel in PA anyone who votes for him in PA is a fool.
Franklin said that those who would sacrifice liberty for freedom deserve neither.

India would have supported Bernie/Tulsi  if he/she was contender 4 democratic party, I think trump will tear biden in upcoming presidential debates, we should stay neutral, and hope trump regain his post, otherwise our MEA really have 2 work hard bcoz biden is Pak supporter
What‚Äôs the Biden brigade?
Till Biden confronts Erdogan and calls him out on his support for ISIS with the help of Europe and allies, most of the diplomatic pressures will likely not work on Erdogan. ISIS connection must be pursued and be brought to international justice.
A friend pointed out that given Biden's political history, he's not innocuous and perfectly palatable like chicken. But he's *still* a clear and unquestionable choice over a plate of shit.
realDonaldTrump: If Obama did this, they would speak of nothing else. Biden could NEVER do it!
I think Joe Biden and the Obama Administration national security team disagrees with you on this one. Also, the Russian people since Snowden further empowered Putin to increase his surveillance of them.
Biden will lose at least 95% of his support if he doesn‚Äôt hold the Trump administration accountable for its crimes.

Where was 45 at John McCain's service? Where was 45 at John Lewis's service? Oh please - Biden will but 45 won't acknowledge it. See the difference now one has empathy one doesn't. "It is was it is".....45
Jason does want Trump to win. Too many Bernie supporters are now supporting Biden. By reminding us that we can't trust centrists like him, Jason hopes to drive us away from Biden, so he can again blame Bernie supporters for Trump's victory.
They bully and shame. But they don't give any substantive reason based on policy to vote for Biden over Trump.
I will give you my insight into this election so that prosperity can judge if I am hearing from God or not. Biden will be swapped out post convention. I don't know for sure who, but I am leaning towards Michelle Obama. Kamala may be the co-pilot, she can't debate Trump.
Biden and Harris will kill it!!!
Trump to speak near Biden's hometown on the night he is expected to accept the Democratic nomination
Healthcare will determine the outcome of this election. If we do not have any public option during a Pandemic, Biden will lose the support from the Progressive Left, many of whom may surrender by election time, given the stakes. We need Medicare for All. Period.
Welcome aboard the pirate ship. I hope we can convince you to vote Biden. You might want to follow as well as Mike.
Biden‚Äôs family is too busy with pay to play. Family of grifters abusing American trust. His entire extended family is corrupt.

This must make you feel good and harden denial of the reality (a) this is not 2016 (b) neither Biden nor Harris is for defunding police and (c) there are not enough racist or nativist votes to scrape so (d) Trump is going down in a landslide come November #BidenHarris2020
Why does every constitutional issue need to go to the Supreme Court these days? Can't people read? "Natural born citizens" cannot be anchor babies.  is not a natural born citizen. Biden works for the Ukrainian mafia. Neither can serve as President. #BigMike

The majority of those voting  support him because 'he's not Trump," according to a new poll.
Biden picked Harris on 8/11, this poll was conducted between 8/9-12.   Did they check her favorability before she was picked?
Americans will do what they have to do to get rid of trump. That includes dropping absentee ballots into an official drop box, early voting, or even getting in line on Election Day (if need be) to vote for Biden/Harris!
And the  will continue to skate on "not being X (R-USA)" until we actually stop going along with their hype and hold them accountable to their claims and promises.  Hillary had no ideas.  Biden has no ideas.  Harris has no ideas.  But at last they aren't Trump, I guess.
OH it's 100% true.  Trump's weakness has always been women.  However, we're more concerned with RESULTS than your little fake purity tests and empty virtue signaling.  Biden = no results = 40 years.  Trump = HUGE results = 3 years.

Completely agree. With the questionable stance of the Trump admin, it‚Äôs been a longtime fear of a ‚ÄúNATO Test‚Äù by Moscow. The next few months will be pivotal. Restoration of stability and order will come with a Biden administration. #BidenHarris2020

With the Dems running #JimCrowJoe for pres, there's really no need for Trump to steal it. Biden can lose it legitimately. He  won't get my vote, and I know I'm not the only Black person who rejects Joe Biden completely.
I wouldn't say its more inspiring... but its definitely "here we go again..." I like how Dr. Cornel West described Biden-Harris: "A slow-moving disaster" ... sigh.

Say what you will about Biden, but he has a great tailor.
President Trump will campaign in swing states such as Arizona and Pennsylvania during the week Joe Biden is nominated.
And so Putin can cheat with the voting machines and Trump will say there's a huge "silent majority" and that polls can't be trusted.   As he declares victory even though polls showed a Biden/Harris landslide and clear Electoral College win.
1.) To use it as a battering ram against Trump 2.) To use it to push tyrannical socialist policies  Some think corona tyranny will disappear if Joe Biden became pres. I disagree. I think the left has had a taste of this tyranny and will milk it as long as they can.

---  Biden beat Bernie's ass by 50+points in the last primaries before the mercy rule saved him. Biden essentially secured 75% of the electorate, to Bernie's 25% when it was a 1 on 1. So, 50 points + would be more accurate. Congrats? üòÇ  ---
Accused sexual predator == Joe Biden. Kamala Harris said quite clearly that she believes Joe Biden is a sexual assaulter and predator.  Kamala believes the accusers.

There being no other option is the exact problem. What power do we then have if we couldn‚Äôt even get the politician we wanted? Or even close to that! Biden was the most watered down stood-for-nothing candidate in the primary and now he‚Äôs who we have to rally behind?

I agree with this üíØ. I think it would benefit the Biden campaign if he came out with the checklist of reforms he'd take on to codify the norms that Trump has been able to railroad. IT would be a strong message that appeals across party lines.

I hope for both of your sakes that things pick up - I know when Biden gets in he‚Äôs for solar, etc., so that will help.  I sit here praying he isn‚Äôt re-elected because SSI is all I have to live on so maybe I can apply for a receptionist job in solar some day ... j/k

The Biden camp displays a sense of humor to good effect
I'm sure Biden, Harris, and the leadership of the Democrats agree with you.
That‚Äôs my point. She wouldn‚Äôt have won but would have definitelly emerged as the heir apparent. Fortunately, Biden sees that and is positioning her for the presidency. This is America. Black women can do anything but getting one into that office requires someone opening the door.
I read this:  He doesn‚Äôt tell you the folks were being re- appointed meaning Bernie had approved them before   He explains what happened in a few instances but not all   What does this have to do with Biden
So glad Biden didn't choose Rice. Snowden showed us the illegal things the NSA was doing, he's a hero like the whistleblowers showing us the illegal things happening within the USPS and all the other crazy shit Trump is doing. #Whistleblowers
Image how sad we liberals will be if they help get Biden elected and just does the same corporate stuff. Crying in our lattes and the avocado toast will be bitter. Boy, that would be so sad. Hope they don‚Äôt help make that happen.  (Maybe some reverse psychology?)
Do you guys think Biden would actually run a second term? Harris is only 55 years old and would have the money and resources in a primary.
You keep bringing up Bernie Sanders.  Is this because you can't defend supporting Joe Biden?  And speaking of brown people Biden has done us more harm that a whole box of Trumps.
This is what Erdoƒüan needed. he should be grateful to Biden. This level of ignorance is really scary...
By comparison, the Pony Express took only 10 days to get a letter from one ocean to the other. It was soon replaced by even faster telegraphs. So forget vote by mail. Vote by Morse Code.  Say what you will about their political views, Biden/Harris will make America go again.
Just a quick question.  Did anyone who watched this #meidustouch video miss the fact that it was about the hypocricy of Fox condeming Biden for things that more accurately describes Trump and Pence?

Exposing Trump (again) as trying to cheat and steal the election NOW will help Biden/Dems fight any post elections shenanigans...particularly with some of the courts. Any Trump claims - Chinese interference! Ukraine! Voter fraud! - will have less than zero credibility.
For example, Trump wanted Ukraine to get him dirt on Biden... which is what Ron Johnson is trying to make hey out of... but it is failing no one cares b/c it‚Äôs so clearly bogus. Impeachment proceedings knee-caped the ‚Äúemails‚Äù type scandal he was hoping to use in 2020. 2/

Playing the long game sometimes means *not* striking first.   I am unconvinced that Pelosi could do something better than what the Biden campaign has done so far with getting the message out.
Drumming up anti-Trump publicity and rallying the American people IS WHAT BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN IS FOR.   Pelosi isn't going to distract from that with an impeachment proceeding that's only going to divert resources away from Biden's efforts. Nor should she.
Really? Just impeach him and broadcast the hearings again? With the Senate unwilling to convict? That's like rebuilding the Death Star and *hoping* the Rebels won't just blow it up again.  Also, the Biden campaign has enough money and resources to cut ads with elderly and vets.
That‚Äôs the current position specifically for Biden. That was not the presidential position in ‚Äò08 or ‚Äò12 and is not the position in many of the congressional or state races. Wouldn‚Äôt exactly call that ‚Äúclassical‚Äù so much as ‚Äúnecessary for this moment‚Äú

Dude.  You picked Biden so I don't see how you believe yourself to be an expert on VP candidate evaluations.
Watch  broadcast: Trump just got "RE-ELECTED" with Biden's VP pick...#truthconductor
This article didn‚Äôt age well
If your job security depended on Biden saying the right thing, would let him wing it on his own?
Been Biden your time waiting for that one?
And how many people voted in the primary? Also, Biden has been terrible to the black community, even if we have supported him. He got the vote because of Obama.
I will unfollow any supposed resistor who says they won't support a Biden/Harris ticket
Donald Trump told reporters at a White House briefing that Kamala Harris ‚Äúwas very disrespectful to Joe Biden‚Äù during the Democratic primaries, and said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to pick somebody that‚Äôs that disrespectful.‚Äù  MORE:
A Biden victory *might* solve our short-term surface-level problems, but he has shown no indication that he plans on tackling the long-term systemic problems
kamala harris wasn't the best pick for biden  but it's pretty solid. overall, not displeased.
It will be come November. Even if there‚Äôs no crossover already, the people saying the top line will vote Biden and people who aren‚Äôt saying the top line will be endorsing it by voting for the left.  I say this as somebody who isn‚Äôt a Trump supporter this time or last time.
Trying to estimate how many nonviolent offenders are incarcerated right now because of the two names on the Democratic ticket is depressing as hell. But yeah let's get psyched for Biden/Harris 2020 woohoo
It took him this long, but Joe Biden finally acknowledged he‚Äôs a racist
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
That face you make after Biden endorses #HeelsUpHarris, after ages of Democrats slut-shaming Melania for photoshoots that she didn't and doesn't even participate in anymore.    #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder  #WalkAway
Joe Biden selects California Senator Kamala Harris as running mate:
And just like that, Biden throws the election
Biden is your candidate, endorsed by "Death to America" Iran and Communist China.  #MuhRussia is no longer an argument.
Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
I don‚Äôt think it really matters because Biden isn‚Äôt gonna win...
Great news!!! Biden-Harris 2020!!!
BREAKING: Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate for the 2020 presidential election.
Can‚Äôt wait to watch progressive criminal justice reform ‚Äúadvocates‚Äù flock to vote for Crime Bill Biden and Kopmala Harris.
I‚Äôm not voting for Joe Biden. I don‚Äôt care who he picks. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Yes, they have. Tara Reade changed her story five times and pro-Bernie journalists admitted to coaching her corroborating witnesses.   As for O'Connell's niece, it was documented that Biden was not even at the event where the assault allegedly happened.  They were debunked.
Your ilk literally tried to exploit Biden's speech impediment in order to falsely suggest he was senile as part of a harebrained ploy to overturn the will of the party's primary voters.  You have quite a nerve to lecture us on coming in "good faith".
He isn't a creep -- pics of him "sniffing" kids were taken out of context. A few of those kids (now grown) say they took no issue with him.  Your one and only issue with Biden is that he isn't a member of your socialist tribe and that he beat Bernie.
Biden has advocated for trimming SS and Medicaid in the past, not with doing away with them entirely like Trump is proposing.
You literally got caught writing policy for the Trump White House which you touted on CNN without disclosing your involvement.  Why the hell would Biden take your advice on anything? Why hasn't CNN fired you?
Actually, both of her accounts are still following Biden.
It doesn't irritate me at all. I supported Kamala before I supported Biden.  What irritates me is people who insist on dividing the left for petty reasons, whether they identify as üåπ Twitter or KHive.
By virtue of the fact that he wouldn't allow 160,000 people to die because unlike Trump he understands masks and testing, yes, Biden winning would be a win.
Even though Dems liked some of his ideas, Sanders and his top people spent the past five years antagonizing and alienating both the party AND the voters. The other candidates didn't need Obama's permission to turn to Biden to block Sanders -- they were fine doing it by themselves
Biden would be in the basement
Your VP of choice was my POTUS of choice, but even though she lost I took a *week off of work* before the SC primary to travel out of state go to door-to-door for Biden. Because the situation facing the country demanded it.  That's what it's about -- the country. Not me. Not you.
Headline: "Black male leaders warn Biden ‚Äòwill lose‚Äô election if he doesn't name Black female running mate" So where were we exactlty in our conversation about institutionalized RACISM????
all day,... ALL DAY LONG you guys have been saying Joe Biden is going to announce his VP pick any minute.... time to pull that page from the teleprompter folks, you're looking silly....
Another huge Trump boat parade this weekend! Enthusiasm is off the charts! Still haven‚Äôt seen a Sleepy Joe Biden sign... Vote #Trump2020 #KAG #TheFive #MondayMotivaton  Gettysburg
Don't get arrested hon. It's not worth it. Just put up a huge Biden sign!
Did Biden actually say this, or did it come from Biden's staff?
I also think it would be important if Biden chose a black woman.  But I also know what whoever Biden picks is not people's highest priority now. The pandemic is.
The Biden campaign has made it perfectly clear that it is ignoring the conventional wisdom on Twitter, because Twitter is not real life.  As the primary should have demonstrated to you, the priorities of ppl on Twitter are not the same as the priorities of ppl in the real world.
How have you been continually ignored? Of the eight female candidates Biden has been considering, five of them were black. That's not being ignored.  Also, the people who badmouthed Kamala to the press only constituted a fraction of the people advising Biden on his campaign.
Bernie Sanders has committed to Joe Biden that if Biden becomes POTUS he will supply him with an endless number of black children to rub the hair on his legs and watch it pop back up.
Joe Biden losing momentum by playing prevent defense in presidential race - Washington Times
You said if Biden wins the narrative will suddenly change...trump has handled this shit as bad as possible...however the numbers are (not sure how u know they're inflated) he hasn't helped things at all. He's called it bullshit from the jump
Suggestion: there has to be a more central element of the Democratic Party. The only way to take your Party back is vote against Biden, (Trump maybe?) then when Republicans gain more control, do what you have to do to claim your integrity back! One step back B4 U step forward...
This cake is baked. Those of us who support Biden need to vote like our lives depend on it! Those that still support Trump either think they will get more money or power or don't believe anything anyone says against Trump because they are just stupid!
Former Vice President  says he would stop construction of the border wall between Mexico and the U.S. when he's president.
1. The gentleman is clearly referring to racial attitudes within his community, not to his civil rights being stagnated because of Democrats.  2. Later in the report he explains why he votes for Biden and is skeptical of Bernie.
Biden was actually consistently far ahead in the polls until Iowa and New Hampshire. The other candidates dropped out and backed Biden b/c 1: Bernie was unelectable, esp. after the comments about Castro, and 2: Bernie and his people have spent 5 years antagonizing the party.
Southern black voters like Biden because he was open-minded enough to serve as Obama's vice president for eight years without ever trying to undermine him. They like Biden because they are *grateful* to him and find him trustworthy, not because of learned helplessness.
I actually took a week off of work to go door-to-door for Biden in Greenville, SC, and talked to dozens of black voters for over 7 days leading up to the primary. That was more informative for me than a single TV segment. They were nowhere near as jaded or cynical as you imply.
The voters in the South who went for Biden were *black voters*, and like it or not they are the most powerful bloc in the party's base. Are you sure you want to go down the road saying their votes shouldn't count?
Since 2016, TYT and the narrow faction of the left it represents have treated Dems like the enemy instead of the GOP. When they lose, they spread lies about "centrist" Dems, such as Joe Biden being senile (which 45 picked up).  Why DO they deserve press credentials for the DNC?
Have you listened to Biden? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£
Trump and the  so scared they are going to lose the presidency to Biden that they cheated to get Kanye on the ballot with fake signatures. Sad!
Tell Trump to go screw a tree. He is using you to put money in his bank account! You‚Äôre being used! Give your money to Biden, show Trump that he can‚Äôt talk to you likd a trash bucket!
Biden has even admitted to corruption, on camera, in front of the CFR.  You are #FakeNews.    #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Funny how that is, I know teachers voting for Biden
So All Trump supporters are racist, but Biden says that all black people are the same, and that‚Äôs not racist.
And yet Biden beat Bernie in the last primary debates despite being "not all there mentally".
..but ya'll wanna be mad at a Biden gaffe üôÑüò†
That's some really STUPID üíÄüò† mandates that the DEMON RATS came up with to control people. THAT is what we can expect if Biden the pedofile GETS IN OFFICE AS PRESIDENT! OH MY GOSH! ALL PATRIOTS PRAY FOR OUR GREAT PRESIDENT TRUMP TO WIN THE ELECTION! VOTE AT THE POLLS PATRIOTS!!
So you are another Russian operative? You will go to prison!  We will not allow Russian fake news on Biden go uncontested. You and your Wisconsin buddy will end up going to prison. Putin will put you there! You nasty Repugs. I expected more from you! Your smell of
The Nina Turner who just today invoked "unity" to pressure Joe Biden into picking Karen Bass as VP is the same Nina Turner who is about to share a stage with divisive troll Ryan Knight and conspiracy theorist Jimmy Dore.  Color me not surprised.
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
This is why i don't care what Biden says until November..#TimeToGetTheFuckOut ‚úåüèæI don't know what Biden's Turkey analysis is but I have encountered some really surprising...how shall I put it?...lack of engagement in the past among some US gov't staff in Ankara, so he might not be totally wrong. I was...not reassured. Literally.
Boatin‚Äô with Biden?
Did you catch where he said it was China and a lot of other countries dream, for Biden to become president? üòÇ

Oh, Petal, that's adorable.   You think Trump answers questions?   They're mini Adore Me Rallies, with planted questions to give the warms to his base.   Biden really doesn't need your help. You've done more than enough.
If Biden is friends with the GOP, that would explain why he keeps calling them fascists and white supremacists.
Why? Biden has no standing to implement policy and, as far as I know, has no crazy tweets to parse. Biden appoints no one and fires no one. Trump isn‚Äôt really having press conferences, he just stands at the podium singing ‚ÄúHow Great I Art.‚Äù
i tend to stay away from appearances but if you‚Äôre gonna list every single piece of work joe biden‚Äôs had done i‚Äôm gonna talk about the spray tan lol
Obama + Biden carried the longest period of economic expansion in American history &amp; Trump slowed it down then destroyed it with ineptitude #facts
Not to mention the various flavors of ‚ÄúBiden is a warmonger and will actively start another war!‚Äù  Will we keep on doing this forever war nonsense under a Biden administration? Yes. Are we gonna go to war with Iran? No.
Simply on the basic level of ‚Äúwill Joe Biden actively make the pandemic worse?‚Äù, the answer is a blatantly obvious ‚Äúno, he will not.‚Äù
The framing of Joe Biden as more dangerous than Trump on certain parts of the left is profoundly weird.
continue to think that if he gets himself on a ballot West will end up harming Trump more than Biden, since it gives Trump-curious voters a way to vote for disruption without voting for Trump.
Postal Union Conflict of Interest? ---- Yes, absolutely  #MailInBallot #VoterFraudIsReal

Only two years older than Joe Biden!
Yeah - wow - we all hate the prospect of a Biden-Harris administration so much, there's a hundred million of us ready to vote for them. And the ones who've been skeptical are all on our side now because they see you trying to fuck 'em outa their votes. Republicans gotta go.
Biden's campaign slogan should read "Biden, making china great again" #KnowYourEnemy
Biden‚Äôs entire campaign strategy...
Media calls him #Biden and calls her #Kamala. It‚Äôs not right.
At what point can I viablely say "fuck you, you don't represent me and you don't deserve my vote the same way the right doesn't deserve it"? I'm not saying I have the answers here, I'm just saying it's hard for me to vote for candidates with the records biden and harris have.
A vote for anyone else besides Biden is a vote for Trump. Choose the lesser of evils. They both suck, but y‚Äôall picking these wack ass other parties KNOWING they won‚Äôt win. Get that orange mf out of office and we‚Äôll go from there.
there's no revolution and there's no other candidate that can defeat trump. we're lucky at this point if the people who can't decide between biden or trump are going to vote for biden because of how much he's been dragged through the mud.
okay okay question time for y'all: what do you want us to do? obviously biden and harris suck but like,,, what else? we know voting third party isn't gonna work. we know that there people are ~slightly~ better than trump. so what are y'all planning on doing? (1/2)
When Biden gets in, we need laws to protect the USPS from this happening again. Foolproof laws.
We call the men #Biden, #Trump, #Obama, but call her #Kamala.   America, Put some respect on her name. Same thing happens in medicine, male physicians are called Dr. X while female physicians are called by their 1st name. Let‚Äôs outgrow misogyny in 2020, ok. #UnapologeticFeminist
BLUE WAVE 2020
There are approximately 600,000 postal workers. Thousands of retirees. VOTE.  The Postal Union endorses Biden/Harris. Tell the rest of us how we can help. Postal workers are in a tough place and we want to be supportive.
the bad take in this facebook interaction is her idea that a black person can‚Äôt support BLM and also not vote for biden which is a pretty shit take
i advocate voting for joe biden for harm reduction but when someone (especially someone of color) tells me they can‚Äôt bring themselves to vote for biden i really can‚Äôt blame them
STILL VOTING FOR BIDEN/HARRIS! #BidenHarris2020Landslide

Biden thinks he can put out the forrest fire of global warming by going tinkle on it.  It's going to take more than one weak bladder.
Any of my civic-minded tech friends know how to get Google's attention on something like this? It pains me that there are people out there searching for "reasons to vote for Biden" &amp; getting Trump Campaign results        ?
In other words, testing is a failure and it won't be fixed until Joe Biden becomes President.
have you tried the website page specifically filled with biden policies
Biden has humility. What a refreshing characteristic!
"Biden is 77, not 87 or 97," said Sabato. "To suggest that a man who is in reasonably good shape, eats well, exercises, has a stimulating job and a mission in life is on his deathbed is outrageous."
and also, realistically, green party won't win, so I'm genuinely curious: why just not vote biden, because historically more people vote for one of the two major parties, thus guaranteeing trump's removal? again this is all out of curiosity
Honestly... is she wrong? Harris is awful, but IMO Biden is worse, so technically she does make the ticket more palatable. Also, this article kinda cherry picks what she said. Read this one too:
Y'all called it correctly.  I'm a proud Obama/Clinton/Biden Neoliberal.
Put her in an oversight position in the Biden cabinet!!
Yes, but I‚Äôm not sure Biden knows the difference anymore. #DementiaJoe
Vote for Biden. Then perhaps there will be a better R candidate for you to vote for in 2024.
If Biden wins Texas, it will get much more difficult for them.
QAnon will be GOP orthodoxy in at least four years, two years if Biden wins and takes office.
Biden's the dude who's passing out crab cakes as the Titanic speeds toward the iceberg. Only this time the iceberg's gone cuz it melted.   Centrists want to treat our problems like they're a nick we got shaving, but they're spurting arterial wounds.  So no.   Just no.
That's why I call Biden a quaalude.  The goal of centrists is to mollify progressives and put them to sleep.  Not on my watch.
I‚Äôve only seen a couple, and they were generic Democrat candidate list signs. Haven‚Äôt seen a single actual Biden sign yet driving all over Virginia, even in blue spots. Have seen a bunch of Trump signs in the red counties though.
Seeing my ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù say they not gonna vote for Biden and Harris is a disappointment. I‚Äôm looking at a lot of y‚Äôall different
Players and officials all kneel at an MLS match in Dallas, recieving boos from ‚Äúfans‚Äù. When called out by a black player for FC Dallas after the match, he receives death threats.   And this is how we know Biden still won‚Äôt win Texas.
Friends,  I hereby announce my intention to run for Virginia's 59th seat in the House of Delegates next November. First things first: Elect Biden/Harris/Warner/Webb November 3, 2020! #socialjustice #EnvironmentalJustice #healthcare
Why are you guys so intent on campaigning for Biden üòÇ
I remember my mom being worried about that one, I think she said biden really had to save him with the VP debate after that
If you wouldn‚Äôt run this about Biden, Pence, Trump, then don‚Äôt run it for Harris,
voting for Biden/Harris does NOT mean you shouldn't criticize them. I'm voting for them but I'm not happy about it, and I will absolutely hold them accountable for past actions and push them to do better.
Your argument is absolutely valid. I myself am voting Biden for the same reason. But again it's a moral argument that we have time and time again. In my lifetime every vote has been the lesser of two evils. The Democrats have just as much of a hand in how far right we've shifted.
‚ÄúDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden recently proposed a climate &amp; clean energy plan that aims to get the country to net-zero emissions by 2050.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs get real: 2050 is a very weak target.  Earth and her people deserve better.  #GeneralStrike #ClimateStrike #GreenNewDeal
26) Last let's consider the single non-poll based, strategic case offered. Note, it is NOT FOR Harris, it is rather AGAINST Trump. That counts. The case is, Trump will play right into women's vaunted hatred of him, by being mean to Harris. This is Biden's real trap for Trump.
I hope that Elizabeth Warren wins the Speaker position in the new administration of Biden/Harris. She will rock!
I get that everyone needs a bogeyman and that people like having a saviour to protect them from it, but that people on here are so emotionally invested in Trump or Biden is hard for me to grasp.   "This is the most important election in our lifetime"-kinda people are weird.
19) Her glib fluidity of speaking provides a stark contrast to Biden's stumbling, bumbling, mind-wandering, blithering idiocy. So, who will vote for their ticket that might not have otherwise? Those who want Harris for President. And, we've already tested that. She bombed.
9) I think HRC was incompetent as a leader. But that stemmed from her gross corruption far more than from personal, demonstrable incapacity. If she finds her way there, Harris' corruption will do the same. But she is not grossly incompetent as is Biden.
8) The one advantage I give Biden is that he is not HRC. He does not stir up the same visceral hatred among Republicans that she did. He is more likeable than she was. His campaign is arguably worse than hers was. Sure, there's COVID. And that gets you the big job?
Biden‚Äôs inability to master cursive handwriting has swing voters worried
14 August 2020 #MAGAanalysis   Is Kamala Harris a Trap Laid by Biden?  I don't know this author, Paul Brandus's work. But, this is not a bad article. As you'll see I disagree. But taking in what we disagree with is important.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
New NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll shows Biden‚Äôs lead expanding from +8% at end of June to +11% now. Biden 53% to Trump 42%. Biden is currently at Obama 2008 level. But can it hold? After ‚Äúconventions‚Äù, around Labor Day, let‚Äôs see.
By bringing U.S. Senator Kamala Harris onto the ticket, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has signaled support for the enforcement of U.S. anti-pollution laws and for suing companies that pollute, environmental groups said.
In 2016, it was all about micro-targeting. Maybe the plan niw is to fuck it up in places where they know they need to blunt Biden's edge(?) Guessing.
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide protective mask mandate over the next three months.
I‚Äôm bullish on Biden absent massive election rigging.  This is massive election rigging.
To be fair, most of their attempts so far have made them sound like they're actively campaigning for Biden -Harris üòÇ
Trump vs. Biden: ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòGood‚Äô Esau fighting Satan in End of Days‚Äù
So tell me what he said that was racist?   And if you believe what he said was racist I‚Äôm guessing you shouldn‚Äôt cover Biden either. After all, he‚Äôs saying racist things too.
To be fair, everytime  has tried something new, it sounds like they're actively campaigning for Biden- Harris
Poor ole Herman who died to attend  a Trump Rally has a daughter who apparently didn‚Äôt mind since she is using her departed father‚Äôs twitter account to continue to support Trump... wow!
I'm not trying to start anything, I'm just genuinely curious: to people who don't like biden (I don't either) and don't want people to vote for him, are y'all voting third party? because to me that just feels like taking the vote away from biden. idk this election just sucks
No one is pure. Let me ask this, how many Nazis &amp; those wanting to kill Blacks and Jews has Biden called ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù? His many has Trump?                      You obviously love and support Trump. I do not and cannot wait until he is gone. We probably should leave it there
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : FOX NEWS POLL: Joe Biden is up 49-42 percent over President Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup
Except, to evangelicals, Biden goes to the "wrong" church.   I had an evangelical grandma. I told her I was marrying a Catholic. Her only response was "You're consigning your children to the fires of hell"  They were never going to vote for Biden.
This is unbelievable. Seriously, California and yet he makes the exact same accusation that he made against Obama. I now believe he is afraid of this power duo of Biden &amp; Kamala. They are going to eat him up and spit him out! #BidenHarris2020
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
In Trump's thinking this animated short is good for him. What I see is a diesel powered train adding CO2 to the air, contributing to climate change. While Joe Biden has the fitness to run a hand lever rail trolley. Maybe Biden &amp; Trump can race bikes, I think I know who would win.
Biden will lose.
Hopefully Republican's can now see Trump will throw anyone under-the-bus, if he feels it will aid him in being re-elected. Governor Ron DeSantis, you marched lock-step to Trump's piping to the cliff, this is your reward for your efforts. Vote the Biden/Harris ticket for change!

They want to enter into coalition with the center-right. This was the whole point of Biden‚Äôs campaign.
big tiddy joe biden is a crime
You do realize that Biden has a lifelong stutter and has worked hard to overcome it? Oh wait, I forgot how much Trump likes to mock disabilities, didn't realize his supporters were similarly that cruel though.

Here's a heads up in advance for tomorrow's thread. I'll analyze the pros and cons of Kamala Harris, by responding to the points in this article:
Here's a head's up on my coming thread, tomorrow. I'll analyze the case for and against Harris, by responding to the points in this article:
"Biden‚Äôs lead in the RealClearPolitics.....As of yesterday, it was 6.9 points."   It's now 7.5 points. Tell me again  how the race is "tightening".
Surley, Charlie, you know that's the opposite of the truth.  Centrist Democrats like Biden and Harris are just the left wing of the Republican Party. There's virtually 100% consensus except on little stuff.  You get that, right? Maybe it's time we abandon these Fox News fictions.
Omg quit bitching. We‚Äôre stuck w/Biden who is demonstrably not a progressive. We desperately need the moderates and as many Repubs as possible. So recognize the effort to defeat Trump. Get on board or move out of the way. You can pick this back up on Nov 4th.
We get it.   You love her.   So do we!   You should stop actively campaigning for Biden, or the Great Naked Emperor will shoot you a mean tweet.
Trump: Make America Great........but long as doesn't cut into profits! Biden: America was great! Vote Biden to clean up trump's mess!
Oh, Lord, we‚Äôre gonna wind up with President Biden in Exile.
When Biden made this announcement, I felt the burden lift‚Äîat least for awhile. Then, what‚Äôs his name forced his ugliness back into my consciousness. But I had a taste of the sweet honey that will be when our national nightmare ends. Biden/Harris/Recovery 2020
To quote  "duh."
What could a Biden presidency mean for climate change investing?
Maybe the car is Trump, the small boy is people who vote for him, and the good boy is Biden/Harris. But really I just love this video.
The point has been made that a President Biden, as Commander in Chief, can issue orders to remove that person. Once Joe's POTUS, The Codes and all authority to command armed services vanishes from Trump's grasp.
It's sweet of you to actively campaign for Biden/Harris, but aren't you afraid the Great Naked Emperor is going to send a mean tweet?
biden and harris need to talk more about how trump is purposely wrecking the USPS to delegitimize an election becuase not enough people are aware that that is happening
I nominate  as Biden‚Äôs and Harris‚Äô Secretary of Kindness and Decency.

rural virginia republicans confuse me so much  ‚Äúwhat do you think of joe biden‚Äôs pick?‚Äù  ‚Äúif they win, this country is gone‚Äù  ‚Äúthis country‚Äôs already gone!!‚Äù  ???
A far-left radical in America is a moderate in any other developed nation. A far-left radical in America also wants what 70% of the population wants, which means that a far-left radical in America is an a real American centrist, but centrists like Biden are conservatives .
1. Start calling Kamala K Harris 2. Use that ambiguity to swap her w/ Kalia before the election 3. Kalia becomes VP 4. Biden has an accident, Kalia becomes pres. 5. She destroys the US gov. from the inside 6. ??? 7. Profit (but not really, cause capitalism needs to die w/ the US)
While prosecution sets a bad precedent, I absolutely want President Biden to make public the documents that prove President Trump's crimes and the crimes of his cabinet and staff. Let's see the verbatim records of those phone calls. Let's see the guilty emails and texts.
He promoted the falsehood in a recent speech announcing his choice of Harris for VP.
Fox's Main Female Clown Jeanine is now a soothsayer.. or perhaps she &amp; Fox have hired an assassin .. ??
I‚Äôm confused. So Republicans with the ‚ÄúLaw and Order President‚Äù are now upset with Joe Biden‚Äôs VP Pick because she is too harsh on . . . criminals??? #RepublicanHypocricy
Why are the media showing Trump‚Äôs press conferences live? It is free tv for his campaign. Record the event, show only what is true, what is newsworthy, what is non-political! No free TV without equal time to Biden-Harris. No amplifying of Trump BS and lies.
i hate that people are already dying due to catastrophic failure of planet. i hate that people are dying because they don‚Äôt have healthcare. the worst case scenario is 4 more years of Trump but i also don‚Äôt want Joe Biden who changes nothing but liberals still think they fixed it
Biden was pulling this stunt as Obama's VP, before anyone considered Donald Trump a political figure.
You got that same energy for Joe Biden? Cause he fucked it all the way up today.
I mean also it seems to me to be positive for Biden...Biden can power a moving vehicle with his own strength. He‚Äôs in good shape. Trump had to buy a train and hire people to run it. So basically a perfect representation - Biden can hard work himself, Trump can‚Äôt do squat.
You are just mad that your own daughter doesn't believe your stupid crap and is voting for Biden and Harris.
Biden and Kamala were fantastic in the debut presser tonight.
Added to the total and just picked up a Biden Harris face mask to wear all over my red county in Virginia. üíô
I hope I‚Äôm wrong but I think Trump is going to have Biden under indictment.  We have to prepare for Trump‚Äôs worst since he knows his freedom hangs on this election.
Is today the day I block Joe Biden? Maybe...
Sen. #KamalaHarris' VP selection could heighten the ticket's focus on environmental justice while prompting fresh #Trump campaign political attacks on Democrats' energy plans.
Sen. Harris gives first speech as Biden's running mate: 'I am ready to work'
The slight makes sense when you remember that Biden knows he will win without the support of the left.
To be 100% honest, I‚Äôm still sorting out my opinions on presidential elections &amp; the specific role they play in our govt. I‚Äôm also not a fan of Biden-Harris &amp; think they‚Äôre both corrupt. But the ppl who think either of those are enough to not vote against T*ump are fucking wrong
As it says NOTHING has CHANGED still the same racist! But on Nov 3rd we can change this!! BIDEN/HARRIS2020
Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball had Kamala Harris as the number one prediction for the vice presidential pick for Joe Biden for months.
Every time they mention that ‚ÄúCharlottesville‚Äù inspired Biden to run, the campaign needs to donate $1,000 to survivors and/or community healing
A cool challenge for the Biden/Harris campaign would be to stop using the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville 3 yrs ago today as a cute and fun talking point to represent the fact that white supremacy is alive and well in America and then quickly moving on
Yep, I'm guessing Biden has about 18/24 months of being President in him.
I know that this makes a moderate but I‚Äôm watching the Biden / Harris press conference and I feel so hopeful ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Vice President Biden today on August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville: "Remember how it felt to see a violent clash ensue between those celebrating hate and those standing against it? It was a wake-up call for all of us as a country. For me, it was a call to action"
The NY Times and the WaPo seem to think there might be a problem, hence the sudden volte-face in their coverage of Harris.  Given his age &amp; debility, Biden is considered unlikely to finish his first term. Voters will need to take a serious look at his VP.
#Biden/Harris2020.  This team is so awesome and both are saying the things to bring this country together!  #BlueWave2020
WATCH LIVE: Biden and Harris make 1st appearance as running mates in Delaware
We're definitely going to be doing that if Biden wins. I'm still a bit skeptical of any NATO-style alliance in the Pacific though. Back when we were the hegemon during the Cold War, SEATO still fell apart. My best hope is for more bilateral alliances, I'll take that at least.
Joe Biden invokes Unite the Right anniversary in his speech introducing Kamala as VP; he once again suggests Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù comments after August 12 2017 was the moment he decided to run for President
Mysogeny. Biden has done worse but Kamala gets the flack. This oppression and patriarchy within our community needs to be cleansed.
"Whining is what Donald Trump does best, better than any president in American history." -Biden
liking biden‚Äôs pocket square to be honest lmao
Ranked voting would be great and yes it would open things up.  Candidates like Biden won't get us there.  Biden is a quaalude. His purpose is to put us to sleep.  Fvck that. I'm wide awake and  mad.
I will absolutely vote for Biden. This vote is tactical; not a love letter. Yes, I‚Äôll vote against 45. But damn it I *hate* the shaming of people for not making the same choice. Biden has my vote, ok? He is 100% still shite. Garbage candidate. Stop shaming people for this view.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
I disagree about "locked up," at any point. After this summer of lawlessness, however, I do not think Biden has a chance. In my other life, though, I hope to get the data to be confident in my call in either direction.
Biden Internet VP Post: A Couple of Odd Things
The GOP is awful. But what's worse in my opinion is the degree to which the Democratic Party--a republican institution run by elites--colludes in absolutely everything.  Did u see Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi marching In the Streets?  It's all lives matter not black lives matter. üôÑ
Divisiveness is worse. But that's really just a continuation of the escalation of inequality which the Democratic party has colluded in equally.  Climate is worse. But Biden is very weak on that.  Judicial picks are bad, but when the Democratic party is back in charge
Undecided! What's left to decide? Where the stock market is on election day?  If she's still for Trump then she should say so. And if not, do the right thing by your family. By your country. Vote Biden/Harris and return the country to some sort of normality
You have to admit, it is nice to see so many Republicons actively campaigning for Biden/Harris!  Weird, but nice üòÇ
Bless your heart, no one expects you to give her a chance.   Your party has been absorbed by the Q nuts and grifters.   We, in the other hand, are looking forward to rational gun control, access to healthcare, and a functional government.   Why are y'all campaigning for Biden?
To be honest, most of their "attacks" have come off as actively campaigning for Biden/Harris.   "She'll undo Trump's tax breaks!" "She'll push for healthcare!" "Take away your God given right not to mask!"  Cool. Thanks, guys.
I‚Äôve been think about this as of late. After some conversations with  yesterday I‚Äôm even more convinced of my opinion. Biden is playing centrists to win. He is a centrist we have history no denying it. Like Obama‚Äôs *evolving*on marriage equality, he can move left.
I'm going to (angrily) vote for Biden but then we can all rally to try and get them to further protections for sex workers, trans women, etc
Sorry I don‚Äôt think I get what you‚Äôre saying. I understand you‚Äôre not voting for Biden/Harris. But are you saying something else?
5) But on only our 3rd day in execution, our team's new outreach strategy is succeeding! How so? Over the 3 days over this week so far, our numbers have actually inverted. We are now getting more Biden supporters than Trump supporters voting. I am THRILLED!
Military General throws his support behind Biden-Harris ticket  via   This man (General McCaffrey) is the real deal. I suspect we will continue to hear from him, and others.
Biden has done things that harmed the black community, and everyone is ready to forgive him because "he has learned his lesson." Kamala has did some things as a prosecutors (well intentioned) and has learned from it - but all the heat is for Kamala &amp; unc Joe is forgiven. Mysogeny
Biden/Harris ‚Äò20, Harris/Abrams ‚Äò24?
I get that Twitter isn‚Äôt the best place for nuanced discourse and I truly understand &amp; respect the numerous &amp; valuable critiques of Biden &amp; Harris. But to not pick even the slightly better option seems like leaning into nihilism. And is fundamentally a callous move, I think
Obviously everything is so fucked up in a myriad of ways but I still think politics is about harm reduction. All politicians lie and compromise etc. but I remain unconvinced that a Biden/Harris ticket would bring about the same chaos &amp; cruelty &amp; pure stupidity of the last 4 years
Right right. I‚Äôm just curious what not voting for Biden does. Like, do you see Trump as president and Biden as president as equal outcomes for poor people, uninsured people, etc. n
