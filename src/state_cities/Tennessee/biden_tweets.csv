Team Trump Just NUKED Biden To Hell With This NEW Ad - He‚Äôs CANCELED  via
All the GOP has to say about Biden is üíØ lies.  Trying to win with lies &amp; cheating.  God sees all &amp; don‚Äôt forget it‚ÄºÔ∏è
Trump: Joe Biden is against religion, against God. He hurts the bible, he kicked my dog -- I had a dog, he kicked the dog -- Joe is against grandma. He never puts the cap back on the toothpaste. Joe is terrible, Joe is anti-Earth, can you believe it? Terrible. Hates Earth
Biden doesn't want to take away our guns. We just need everyone to enforce the laws already set forth.
Biden is a good catholic in good standing I believe. Good enough for me

Biden is none of what trump claims.
Biden‚Äôs statement is üíØ true.  Its nothing negative with Latinos.
Listen to the bot and bote biden. Dawn is.
What the hell does Joe Biden have to do with this?  YOU LIE MORE &amp; MORE EVERY HOUR.  The Bible states Thou shall not lie‚ÄºÔ∏è
OMG.  Biden has quoted the Bible more than Trump.  I would be so scared to telling lies like he does
And liberals like Obama and Biden want you to believe that mail-in voting is fraud proof! If you can ‚Äúprotest‚Äù, you can go vote!     via
I‚Äôm pretty sure this is sarcasm, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised a bit if this were a direct quote from Biden.
Touch√©....however Biden should be packing his things for assisted living instead of the White House. How is he the best Democrat for the job at this critical time I mean seriously? There‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs run like 10 times and went 0-for until now &amp; he wasn‚Äôt senile then...
That would be a wonderful gift from Joe Biden. Let it be.
Yes you certainly are. Putting Kayne West on the ballot in 3 major states as independent runner to take votes from Biden.  Every GOP is downright DIRTY.  If not in this earth, you will face your maker on your lies &amp; üí©
Biden has no signs of dementia.  That‚Äôs the only reason #45 was given, IF he has even taken one
Oh. I‚Äôm not defending what he says.... üòê. I‚Äôm no Biden defender. He‚Äôs said some really dumb things over the last year.   I also agree that many times people speak their mind and then try to downplay later. I‚Äôm generally just sad about political landscape
Nothing like those shovel ready jobs and projects that took years to start,your meme is so far off with numbers it isn‚Äôt even funny, you do know you have access to the real numbers.biden just ripped off Bernie‚Äôs economic plan . Remember biden Plagiarizing last time he ran üòÇüòÇü§î
This is too funny. Biden can‚Äôt have a convo without reading off a prompter and it‚Äôs just pathetic that somehow he won the nomination at this point given his state of mind. It‚Äôs sad that he‚Äôs lost it, but if they actually have to stand toe to toe Trump will demoralize him
I cannot wait for Trump to devour Biden in the debates. It's going to be so bad it will probably drive you off Twitter for a few months.
I think that's too simplistic. If Obama &amp; Biden hadn't shared values, etc, their apparent deep friendship in addition to their smooth working relationship would NEVER have been as close as it was/is. Obama wanted a seasoned guy who wld tell him what he really thought. Biden did.
You are so evil. Trump is the President.  Biden is a candidate.
Biden has been working on picking his VP candidate.  All Trump does is tweet half the day &amp; lies the rest of the day.
I don‚Äôt have to hear a debate.  Trump never directly answers a question.  #BIDEN ALL THE WAY
Are you drunk again‚ÅâÔ∏è. This was many months ago from the 2016 election.  Has nothing to do with Biden.
This did not come from Biden‚Äôs mouth.
Why are you mentioning Biden‚Äôs name?  He has NOT stated anything about getting out of debates.   I guarantee one thing....Trump will probably attempt to get it virtual so he can read his notes from Administration in the background.
Biden is in mental decline.  Who is the real candidate?
Sincere condolences to you &amp; your family. I'm going to vote for Biden.

Joe Biden Says Women Need His Help to Succeed in America

Biden knows what it takes to be POTUS-His choice will be based on that issue probably more than ever before. I've always been a Kamala supporter. But I have a lot of trust in Biden's decision here. It will be the opposite in terms of vetting, etc from McCain's decision on Palin.
Biden would bring this country into total divide and chaos. He will destroy America as we know it.

I'm in a modest neighborhood in Williamson County. I will be putting a Biden sign in my yard. Nobody said anything about my Hillary sign in 2016!
this is not to say Biden is racist. But he thinks Blacks are all the same, need the same things, think the same ways,  have 1 cultural experience. This is why he doesn't know why any wouldn't vote for him. It's why he and Dems are more focused on illegal immigration than citizens
Trump is out and about all day. Holding LIVE Press Confrences everyday. Flying all over the country every week. Interviewed by MSM everyday. Joe is done. You have #TDS. It will only get worse for you and Biden will continue to regress.
Great writing, Mr Biden‚Äôs Twitter writer whatever your name is! You should make a Joe Biden mask and start giving his speeches for him.
#Biden can hardly speak, Patchouli.  Let's see if the Panderer can handle a debate.
yep. So there's part of the diversity that Biden ignores or doesn't know about. Also she claims to be whatever ethnicity that works for her that day.  She's a con artist
And yet, he assails Biden for implying the black community was a monolith?
If Biden wins domestic terrorists win
The left isn't covering for Biden. It's the centrist Democrats who are trying to brush off his casual racism.
just the statement from Biden that he thinks all Black Americans have a common thought process is preposterous.    But that's the Dem party. Thinking they have the Black vote, they don't need to do anything to further (campaign empty promises) and focus on illegal immigration
He could get one at some point. #Biden doesn't have to. It's beyond obvious he is on a steep cognitive regression.
You really shouldn't be spending your time defending Biden's racism.
NY Times reporter notes Biden staff 'anxiety' over gaffes, claims Dems 'thrilled' ex-VP off campaign trail  #FoxNews  They‚Äôre gonna keep him in the basement from now on.
It kind of sounds like you're saying Biden was right about Black Americans lacking the diversity found in Latino culture. Which would indicate you're in no position to criticize anyone for staggering ignorance.
Biden just lied and said he didn't say what he said. That's not an apology.
I have never mistakenly said that Black culture in America was not diverse and then had to "clarify" that I did not say that Black culture in America was not diverse. I admit I have an easier time avoiding such mistakes because I'm not an out-of-touch old racist like Biden.
Biden hurt the Bible? Was that one Bible or all of them?  Whoa! Biden hurt God!?! Must be powerful.   No, not the trifecta!?  Against God, Guns and Energy. ü§™

So wait,  Biden is bad for energy, but when his son worked for an Ukrainian Energy company, that was bad too? #iamconfused
Biden's answer to pretty much everything has been giving the police more power &amp; less accountability. In terms of actual results, he's well to the right of Trump on LE. It's funny watching Trump try to paint the guy who thought Reagan was soft on drug users as a leftist.
That's a nice fantasy. Biden tried to dissuade Obama from even attempting a weak version of the healthcare plan he campaigned on. Biden's already said he would likely veto M4A if it came to his desk as president. The man won't fight for the people. He's for his donors alone.
I disagree. What a politician chooses to address says a lot about their values and what they will do in office. Biden values empty symbolism.
If you believe that Joe Biden could hurt God, you might have misidentified yourself as a Christian.
Like most long-serving officials, there‚Äôs been an evolution. Most notably, Joe voted for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, and argued in the 2000s he didn‚Äôt want to redefine what constitutes marriage. Alas, Joe saw it was time for change.
Joe Biden, ladies and gentlemen. He‚Äôll be here all week.
Biden thinks all black people look alike.
I would like a candidate running against Trump who was able to speak to their own plans. Trump is terrible. Biden should be able to draw a meaningful, policy-based contrast, but instead he‚Äôs making empty emotional appeals that seem shockingly out of touch.
It‚Äôs more concerning that no one‚Äôs concerned about Kayne‚Äôs mental health &amp; getting him the treatment he needs. He‚Äôs not a threat to Biden, he‚Äôs a threat to himself if left untreated. Be goddamn human for a fraction of a minute &amp; see people who struggle as PEOPLE not FAMOUS PEOPLE
Not when you compare it to the many other instances of Biden's inappropriateness!
Biden is a pathological liar. He's a POS with terrible judgment who has been directly involved in creating half the problems he's now promising to fix. He might be better than Trump's bigoted incompetence, but we don't have to praise him.
Yeah, wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to be a multimillionaire like Biden and be able to maintain expensive toys like that Corvette, never having to even worry about needing to sell it to pay for healthcare or to avoid eviction?
But that‚Äôs kind of the point, isn‚Äôt it? To some people‚Äîlike Biden, and, presumably, many of his very comfortable supporters‚Äîthat doesn‚Äôt seem the least bit luxurious. While there are others who are getting pushed out of their homes because they‚Äôre a few bucks short on rent.
I worry more about the American oligarchs that both Trump and Biden are beholden to than the scary Russians.
Only if Dementia Biden is elected. #Libs
For most of his career, he‚Äôs lived up to the ‚ÄúMiddle Class Joe‚Äù image. Only after leaving office has the Bidens‚Äô wealth soared‚Äîa majority of which from book royalties and speaking engagements.
90 Days. Joe‚Äôs committed to ethics.  Recently his campaign made the unprecedented decision to limit staff from trading stocks, taking the additional step to prevent conflicts of interest.
Biden‚Äôs idea of strength is driving luxury cars 200 mph, xenophobia, bragging about fights he almost got in, and lying big with a straight face. We need someone whose idea of strength is stepping up to help those who need help. Biden doesn‚Äôt cut it.
Joe Biden: ‚ÄòThere Will Not Be Another Foot of Wall Constructed in My Administration‚Äô
So here‚Äôs my question. Why does Biden get defensive when he‚Äôs asked a random (or unplanned and unrehearsed) question? He belittles the question and rambles a bunch of ‚Äústuff‚Äù. And a lot of times lies.
He should just take the test. And Trump passed it already. Come on man.... Biden should take the test.
Joe Biden Snaps at Black Reporter over Cognitive Test Q: 'You a Junkie?'
And don't forget the market being over 27,000 points today WITH COVID and the Dems trying to destroy the economy. Only about 9,000 points higher than when O'Shitta left office. If #Biden is elected, kiss your 401-k goodbye.  ‚úåüèª
This is VERY concerning. I‚Äôm not convinced that Democrats can be as effective with virtual efforts. I don‚Äôt think this is the time to experiment.
No way. Debates are ALWAYS coordinated by League of Women Voters and those debates are the only ones Biden should participate in and as previously scheduled. It‚Äôs not Biden‚Äôs fault Trump bungled the coronavirus.

Gonna be so pissed if Joe Biden opts out of the debates against Trump this fall. Been waiting forever to watch these two morons go at it üòê it would make for comedy gold
Fair. And I appreciate the comment.  For me (like many others) it‚Äôs simple...  1. Trump &amp; ‚ÄòTrumpism‚Äô must be defeated. He is void of any moral compass. 2. 3rd party is not an option this election. (I voted 3rdP in ‚Äò16) 3. Biden is a decent man who has a history of bipartisanship.

Trump Ad: Joe Biden 'Hiding in His Basement' from 'Decades of Failure'
Donald Trump thinks too fast. Now I‚Äôve heard everything.   This is not a neutral analysis. People who like Trump think Trump is more mentally capable, and Biden people think Biden is. I don‚Äôt like either, and from my view they both appear to struggling big time.
Where are the pics of Biden sniffing, petting and kissing little black kids??? Great point
I KNEW they were going to try this. Biden wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance against Trump in a debate.
40% of actual voters will always vote GOP, 40% will always vote DNC. 20% independents/moderates choose all elections.  I'd like to thank the BLM &amp; Antifa activists &amp; Biden's handlers for broadcasting support for said marxists for pushing that middle 20% away from the Dems.
Not endorsing Biden suggests she‚Äôs much more sensible and honest than the rest of the lot.
Pathetic interview. Instead of asking Jill to respond to clips of  questioning Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline why not play clips of Biden. Really disappointing
Ok so Biden don't have dementia which means he is just stupid then.

there are NO Biden interviews.
Who said Iran, China, &amp; Russia are Joe Biden's enemies? Those are his owners.
ü§£ü§£ Biden is whooping  ass without even trying -He‚Äôs not hiding, he‚Äôs smart opposed to trump never wearing a mask and every time he opens his mouth HE LIES!  Good luck with L‚Äôorange &amp; his deadly buffoonery!
He's weird. You Libs are the one's telling everybody to be PC. #Biden has been told numerous times that this is not appropriate now, yet he continues. Just playing by Libby Rules. Funny how that works, huh?
Even if Biden is at the debate will Biden be at the debate?

Joe Biden's Green Dreams Are About Controlling You, Not The Climate
Biden Mixes Declaration of Independence and Constitution Into a Blender and It Comes Out Incomprehensible
No, he's not. I would 100% support it if he did push to defund the police, but sadly Biden's uncritically pro-cop career is a big part of how the police have become such a harmful force in the US.
Biden needs to debate Trump then. Let's go get him on stage tonight.
I think the ‚Äúdiscredited‚Äù claim and the genuine misconduct are closely related, and OP‚Äôs article seems to be intentionally obfuscating the valid ethics complaints about the Bidens.   That Democrats are apparently okay with that corruption is shameful.
92 Days. Joe Biden‚Äîbecause we need dogs back in the White House.   Champ and Major are up for the task.
They are just waiting on Biden's VP choice to choose a VP.
Not sure what you mean by that last line. It sounds like you're suggesting that Hunter Biden isn't a man.
Shes nutz so is Biden, intelligent women can see this as a buy for votes.
But who is Joe Biden's runing-mate's running-mate going to be?  It sure isn't going to be Joe.
A ‚Äústrawman‚Äù would be something like saying someone was arguing for voting for Trump when they were merely pointing out Biden‚Äôs flaws. I guess, by your own definition, you should be labeled a purposeful troll.
Not angry, just disappointed. The goal is to have a competent adult in charge. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Biden, but I am a huge fan of not having a whiny child.  Maybe you should read up on Trumps past. How are those tax returns coming? Porn stars? Bankruptcies? NDAs? Shady deals?
1. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to work, sure. I wasn‚Äôt arguing otherwise. 2. That‚Äôs not how voting works. 3. Sounds like you have very low expectations of Democrats, which explains your support for Biden.
Not perfect but better than Biden
If Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúlies‚Äù are the problem, then why doesn‚Äôt Biden just lie during the debate as well. Not like it‚Äôd be his first time.
Trump supporters condemn white supremacy and racism in any form, as well as violence against women or anyone. Now do Biden supporters.
Don‚Äôt forget Biden‚Äôs victim

This is a terrible way to think. Biden is bad and his VP may be bad, but I won‚Äôt ever complain or question it. Just because Orange Man Bad
I don't care who Biden picks!we need window dressing to disappear and put people in office who aren't afraid to push for protection under the law and other issues. We didn't make any progress when we had a black president we sure as Hell won't garner support with a Blk female!
‚ÄúPolls show Biden ahead even in swing states. But focus groups of swing voters show they're sticking with Trump. What does this mean for the election?‚Äù  #MAGA2020Landslide
We‚Äôre arguing semantics. People who wanted Bernie to be president more than they wanted Biden voted for Biden anyway, based on the ‚Äúelectability‚Äù narrative. If you think that means more people ‚Äúwanted‚Äù Biden, that‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs not what people usually mean by that word.
Now we‚Äôre talking...long term I agree.   So, if we take this back to the current candidates...neither one are interested in reducing the size of the govt, nor spending less.  With that said, I‚Äôll stick with Biden this goes around to get Mr. Deplorable himself out üòÅ
Then that‚Äôs the second reason lol.   Joe Biden üôÑ
That‚Äôs not what the voters have said. I recall quite a few interviews around SC and Super Tuesday with voters who said they preferred Bernie, but they voted Biden because they thought he was more electable.
I‚Äôll put money on trump not showing up to debate Biden.
I sometimes just call them Biden Bros, but I don't really like doing anything to propagate the myth that Bernie's supporters were particularly toxic.
That's not what Biden said. It's a fair bet he has no idea what anarchists think, but the president shouldn't be echoing 1920s scare tactics.
"Decent humans" with a national platform don't paint innocent people as drunkards either. And that's probably one of the least egregious of Biden's pathological lies.
Probably not, but Biden was pretty close to the worst option among Democrats. Pretending otherwise doesn't help anything.
Biden is not a decent man, and he's directly responsible for empowering the police to commit much of the abuse people are protesting today.
Its interesting how often people who supposedly support Biden tell people to vote for Trump. It's a pretty transparent attempt to bully people for criticizing Biden.
You might recall that Obama was president and Biden was VP when this was happening.
I mind those things too. It‚Äôs possible to have a consistent moral compass and thus oppose the evil things done and supported by Obama, Biden, and Trump.
Biden‚Äôs whole campaign is delusional. One moment his staff will tweet about how Americans can do anything, then someone will ask about universal healthcare and Biden will brush it off as too expensive.
I appreciate the apology. There seem to be a handful of politicians who at least make an effort, but Biden is one of the worst offenders. He lies about easily disproven things without apparent reason, so I really don‚Äôt get why the ‚Äúhonesty‚Äù angle seems to have gotten any buy-in.
Biden seems to have trouble speaking more than a few sentences without lying, so this is an odd take. It would be easier to take you folks seriously if you seemed to know anything about the man you‚Äôre advocating for.
This thread is about Biden rehashing Obama‚Äôs slogan, and Biden‚Äôs supporters are now making the comparison between the former VP and the former president. Obviously you‚Äôre the one not paying attention.
No, I don‚Äôt, and if you read my comment again you‚Äôll notice that I point out that truthfulness, if Biden possessed it, would contrast with Trump‚Äôs dishonesty. But Trump‚Äôs dishonesty doesn‚Äôt make Biden is any less of a liar. They are both self-aggrandizing prevaricators.
Aww, you post a ‚Äúfact check‚Äù that provides the supporting quote that shows Biden‚Äôs lack of empathy and his contempt for BLM and other contemporary struggles, then block when someone actually points that out. Keep sticking your head in the sand.
Who? Biden is one of the most dishonest politicians in Washington. He lies about everything from the big picture to the petty details, and he keeps going even when called out.
Most realistic Biden slogan.
Biden has low character and little empathy, and his experience suggests he has poor judgment and is racist, sexist, and easily bought.   He will almost certainly be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than Trump, but he‚Äôs a terrible person and will be a terrible president. Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves.
If I'm I fascist, you'll be Biden's Running Mate in November.   These idiots are the #Fascist!
Clyburn will take Biden to the White house.  He will be on media along with Obama.  Let's March for our future!
I so hope you are right. I cried when Kamala dropped out of the presidential race. I have been holding onto the hope that Biden will pick her.
had a great article  about Rice being the best choice to insulate BHO &amp; Biden from the Durham investigation and boom just like that this damaging news drops on COMMA LA.   I also think the ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù announcement by Politco may have been on purpose.
When eventual nominee Michael Dukakis learned of his staff‚Äôs involvement in pushing the plagiarism scandal, they were promptly fired and Dukakis issued an apology to Biden.   It would be 20 years before Joe attempted to run again.
95 Days. Joe‚Äôs not an unblemished candidate. There‚Äôs gobs of missteps and gaffes over his almost five decades in public service. What‚Äôs important: he owns up to his mistakes and learns.  Today‚Äôs example: Joe‚Äôs first run for President (1988).
Why aren‚Äôt they making as much noise about getting info from the State Dept about Biden that was given to Johnson and Grassley?
Biden please choose Kamala Harris!!! #KamalaHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP
choosing Karen Bass for VP would be a HUGE mistake. Her past working with the Venceremos Brigade in Castro‚Äôs Cuba will bring on the GOP calls of ‚ÄúSocialism‚Äù that seemed to go away after Biden won. #BidenVPChoice #KarenBass
Well, if Biden wins you‚Äôre gonna be pissed off within 1st 100 days. I look at it this way, not one President in my lifetime has cared as much as Trump. Sure he has faults , but doesn‚Äôt every person on earth?! Biden cannot and will not get us back on our feet. He‚Äôs made that clear
Why not poll Biden supporters on same question? since, ya know they didn‚Äôt accept 2016 results, weaponized FBI &amp; IC to spy on rival campaign in attempt to take out duly elected POTUS &amp; obstruct peaceful transition of power.
It‚Äôs not the mail Josh. You know that. The mail is metaphor for the same democrats that have been wasting time trying to eliminate this president since before he took office. Starting with Obama/Biden spying on his campaign. Wait, you‚Äôre not paperless Josh? I am. Bad liberal.
Yes they will show up in record numbers and Joe Biden will be our new president.
Yes and in a short time he will be delivering his congratulatory speech to Joe Biden.  He is so done
You know that strategic activism has been *proven* to work, right? Which is exactly what orgs like  have been doing. That‚Äôs why  had a seat at the table on Biden‚Äôs climate team, and thank God she did.

Yesterday Trump teed it up for Joe Biden to talk about his personal faith and what it means to him to be a Christ-follower. He‚Äôs a church-goer and a decent man. Christians devoted to Trump will have to reconcile their support for the most vile, selfish man in US political history

Uh ohhh, Biden‚Äôs looking a little unsteady. Smeared in fundraising.  Called a black journalist a junkie, said all blacks look the same to him. Stuttering and stammering. What are his handlers doing. Keep him in the basement. Please.
Tell us how Trump is a racist and how Biden is not!!
Wow Biden got destroyed in his fundraising this month. He called a black journalist a junkie and said he thinks all blacks look the same to him. You Dems must be proud. Lol
I've decided to get away from it all with a quick trip to Thighland. Promise me you won't let Biden hurt God while I'm away.
Joe Biden is a racist.
So you got everybody who gon go and support trump vs. the few who willing to look over shit and vote for Biden
Biden is rightfully too much for folks to even consider taking the ‚Äúlesser evil‚Äù even if it could potentially open up opportunities or just stop the downward spiral we in now
People see it as simply Biden vs trump and simply look it as those choices, but I look at it as Biden vs trump, pence, DeVos, his sons and other randos who he gave important political positions to
But I‚Äôm not voting for Biden exactly , I‚Äôm voting for the opportunities that will arise because we won‚Äôt have trump in office and his whole clique that he has given prominent positions to over the years
What is wrong with Biden?
Wow Trump stomped Biden in fundraising. Biden freaked out in an interview. This does not bode well for Basement Biden.
Wow Biden freaked out in a fit of rage today. Called a reporter a junkie. Scary to think of him with his finger on the nuclear button.
Wow. Biden got destroyed in fund raising! Going down fast.
Where is Bunker Biden? Where is Hunter? Heard they opened an investigation today.
Wow, I heard Biden freaked out again in an interview. What happened? Heard he called the CBS newscaster a junkie? Is he ok?
Biden, his in his basement all day. Took one interview. Freaked out. Fit of rage. Called the black interviewer a junky. Do we really want this guy with his finger on the nuclear button?
Wow, Biden freaked out today. Called the person interviewing him a junkie. He is losing it. Dangerous and demented.

Interesting that that what you are really saying is that Joe Biden can kick Trump's butt just hanging out in his basement.
you know what ... that‚Äôs why joe Biden is winning ..
first of all you only won your seat because of the fact of name recognized and you still don't get it, Dummycrats really think the POTUS want win running against Biden, you are an idiot.
Keep it up Trump. Waiting for Biden blunders without promps during interviews and Upcoming debates. Vote Trump.

Vote Biden. He believed  Obama was surprisingly clean. Now that is the type of no nonsense racial equality leader we need.
Would you prefer he make an ‚Äúoff the cuff‚Äù pick like Dan Quale or Sarah Palin? Let‚Äôs get real: the VP he chooses will be the front runner for 2024. Biden will only serve one term ( due to age). This pick is not about 2020, it‚Äôs about the country‚Äôs future.
Biden is slipping fast. Please keep him in his basement.

A 3rd party vote isn't a vote for Trump or Biden.  A 3rd party voter wasn't going to vote for either of those 2 anyway.
Does Trump realize all our troops that are not home do Mail in ballets? This man is not right!!! He‚Äôs just not!! I live in Memphis Tenn. in the SOUTH &amp; a Democrat! Alot of the South are REPUBLICANS I WAS until Barack Obama &amp; from then on DEMOCRATE. You have to win Mr. Joe Biden!

Extreme Embarrassment to our country &amp; the rule of law.  Dems call a lynching without a rope - almost as dumb as a candidate for Pres without a brain. Why would Dems ever put this in Nadler's hands? Or worse, in Biden's?Biden is not the one using a privately organised goon squad to repress the black voice

This is the difference in biden and trump Biden will at least apologize over comments that have been taken out of context. Trump would never apologize for something he blatantly said wrong, and would even double down  and try and prove why he's right.

Opinion | The Trump fiasco just got worse. That gives Biden a hidden opening.    requires no tutoring.  He's a dedicated pragmatist who approaches the work as it comes -- despite the Trump leaving a double helping of damage everywhere.

Biden‚Äôs statements that black people lack diversity or that ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù if you vote GOP aren‚Äôt  in and of themselves racist.  But when you add it to him writing the crime bill that incarcerated so many young black men, then the picture gets clearer.

Obama is a traitorous criminal responsible for serious acts of treason...never-ending his history of divisive actions and his close association with a corrupt Joe Biden...who is under investigation as we speak.
Yeah, for me it does. Republicans made their bed. You voting for Biden then,

Joe Biden has given up on the word "African." He now says "Afrin-Americans." Always. It's either dentures or laziness or brainless. I'm voting for the last option. As for the content of this "excerpt"... Yipes.
Trump does not tell you who worthy of vote or not.  That's Joe "If you don't vote for me, you're not black" Biden. The identity politics of the black vote is divisionist politics #MainstreetAmerica

What's the " radical" part of the democratic agenda? Biden is just another light republican
Why do we get Trump as the RNC choice is the bigger question IMO. But I think Biden was chosen because he has the most realistic option to pull moderates over and defeat Trump. I‚Äôm a republican, pretty moderate on some fronts and pretty liberal socially, I want Trump out of there
I actually heard some guy say: "If Biden picks a VP who is DIVISIVE I won't vote for him."  He was serious.  GOD forbid we have a "DEVISIVE" vice-president.  A voter totally devoid of insight.  THIS is what we have to worry about.

So now, let's talk about Joe. I think Joe Biden is a Christian. I think his faith is real and informs his way of living his life.   The problem most Republicans have is they believe political parties are aligned to religions when, in fact, political parties often just use them.
Trump lied yesterday and says that Biden is against God. Now, that's about all the time I'm going to spend on that lie because it's so obvious and so weirdly stated that it's beneath all of us to do more than mock it.
Even WORSE than Hunter Biden NEVER being punished for all his CRIMES, he was given privileged opportunities, one after another and he‚Äôs a misogynist JUST LIKE HIS FATHER! He treats women like material objects &amp; smokes crack &amp; everyone just keeps throwing money at him &amp; SAVING him
The valid and legitimate concern that Biden will not have the physical fortitude or mental capacity to hold the job for 4 years. (He‚Äôs already had two major aneurysms.) The delay confirms the fear: This VP is likely assuming the office of President if Biden wins.
Biden can shoot someone on 5th Ave and not lose any votes. Hope this helps.

God took center stage in the presidential election yesterday, with President Trump warning that Biden would "hurt God" while Biden quoted the Bible at a church meeting.
Last December, Joe Biden wrote about his faith for  "Scripture is clear: It‚Äôs not enough to just wish the world were better. It‚Äôs our duty to make it so."
How interesting it is to see that Biden  clip floating around &amp; ppl who are voting Trump like ‚ÄúHow can you vote for this when he says things like that?!‚Äù after they‚Äôve spent the last few years screaming ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt watch the whole thing‚Äù or ‚Äúthey took that out of context.‚Äù
"Scripture is clear: It‚Äôs not enough to just wish the world were better. It‚Äôs our duty to make it so." Joe Biden, writing about his faith for  in December
So what's the point of your tweet, then? Biden spoke about his faith and the Bible to a doctrinally conservative group of Christians. Doesn't seem like doctrine was the issue
Is anyone from the left going to say something? First he says if you don't vote for him you aren't black. Now this! If you are going to call out the statements of Trump you must also call out the statements of Biden. #Election2020 #Biden2020 #Trump2020
How many white babies or mixed babies have been aborted in 50 years? Why are you just mentioning Biden as your opponent,what about Trump? Why are you not dragging him? Your mama has got to be ashamed.
That sort of idiocy is why we have such an idiot for president. Even the Federalist Society doesn't want trump. Luckily, Biden is on the glide path to an easy win, since Trump can't open his mouth without lying.
More real than our former first "lady"  Obama's birth certificate  Nancy's teeth Schumer's good intentions  Hollywood's benevolence  Anything James Comey ever said Peter Strozk's fidelity or Biden's yammering yarns.... Real seems to be ü§î a relatively squishy concept anyway....

Yeah, but Joe Biden.
I'm happy they re-run his show a couple of times before morning.  Something smart to watch during my insomnia. I love his wit. I've seen him on a late night talk show. He is very funny.

Another major gaffe but his liberal media enablers have chosen to ignore the stupidity of this comment by Biden.  Now if Trump said something this stupid the liberal media would replay it all day.

You reeled me in the way you covered the Beirut explosion... But I don't get excited over a guy whose 50 years younger than Biden but makes as much sense lol. I am probably wrong for this. I don't wanna be right lol
"Everyone knows this"? Oh, okay. Biden is an old racist white man telling Black folks I got your vote on lock. He could have just made his point about the Latino vote, left Black people out of it and called it a day. But not Biden, he's to arrogant to do that.
Trump would just use it to boast how much he gave to charity, ‚Äúway more than tight ass Biden who gave nothing‚Äù.
The fact that alludes Biden (like so many facts do) is that there are Black people in this country that immigrated here from countries in Africa, the Caribbean and South America all with different languages, cultures and beliefs.
Joe Biden is at the uncomfortable "so Grandpa, tell me what you REALLY think" stage of Dementia/Alzheimers.
I have the balls although I‚Äôm no rich Lebrun James! Biden has communication problems. He is Not well spoken but his heart is not as vile as the current underworld king sitting on the toilet at the WH! That should earn  his vote if nothing else! Stop the divide!
You have a mental illness. But, I digress , you can honestly say Mr. Biden is fit for office? I get that ‚Äúwe the people ‚Äú elected a ‚Äúgame show host‚Äù   But, Mr. Biden is a COMPLETE fuck up. My worries are the chosen Vice President and her demands. I will never apologize or be ..
Bernie voted for that bill like nearly everyone in the Senate did at that time. But Biden WROTE the damn bill and pushed hard in the Senate to get it passed, big difference.
So trump put an ad in the paper, big deal. Biden had real power to enact the death penalty and used it.
He put the VAWA in the 1994 Crime Bill in order to get people to vote for it. The crack/cocaine sentencing disparity (Biden's contribution to the War on Drugs) was uber punitive and racist. Really interesting stuff considering his own son Hunter was doing crack and cocaine.
No they would not because orange man bad. It‚Äôs going to be so great watching all these people cry when Biden gets man handled on election night!
What policies has trump proposed that are as damaging to poor, Black and Brown communities than the ones that Biden wrote and pushed hard to pass in the Senate?
So Biden is worse Pelosi is drunk and Dubya couldn‚Äôt say nuclear (nukular) maybe some younger candidates may help
What gave you the idea that Joe "Nothing Will Fundamentally Change" Biden is trying to bring meaningful change?
What‚Äôs happening is Joe Biden has always been a racist as many past videos have shown. His mental capabilities are declining and he‚Äôs unable to hide his true self which is leading to more episodes like this one.
Except Biden is a practicing Catholic and has been his whole life....
Well for what it is worth, I believe the best path to our goal is to elect Biden.Biden will be there for 4 years and then his VP pick will be in the driver seat. My pick is Harris who said that she was for Medicare for all.Unfortunately when she said that that is when she crashed
And as we can see that didn‚Äôt really go too well. However, now that the only two are Trump and Biden, I don‚Äôt fucking know what‚Äôs going to happen in November, neither of them will outlive the term imo

Seeing clips of Trump and Biden every day has really pushed me believe we need to have an age cap on the U.S. presidency.
I agree but most media is so determined to get rid of Potus they will lie about joke about and cover up Biden's rapidly declining mental health.
Trump himself is a profane insult. A second term will be catastrophic for this country.  That‚Äôs all that matters.   Biden is an opportunist? My god. There is zero equivalence between these two men. Zero.
Seriously. Who cares who the VP pick is? There is no guarantee Biden retires or becomes incapacitated during his first term.

I watch Tucker only. That‚Äôs enough to let me know what‚Äôs going on, and that it‚Äôs not good. When I read that the guy who has predicted accurately every Presidential election for decades (even Trump in 2016) has predicted Biden to win, I fell apart. So depressing!

Trump is only good at getting rich people richer. Anyone else not so much. It will be interesting assuming Biden has the chance how he will help the income gap. He is definitely way more of a centrist and hopefully can find a better middle ground.
So because someone else is racist means Joe Biden can‚Äôt be racist?

Biden must have been a blockhead in school. And if he is not writing what‚Äôs on the TV prompter.., he has no Reading comprehension skills. Proof he will sign, read, and do anything put in front of him.
Just saying what I would advise Biden to do, if I wanted to maximize his chance to win.  The election is about DJT, yes or no.  If no, then Biden because President, not because he‚Äôs worthy, but because he‚Äôs not Trump.  A bad way to select a President, but pretty much how it is.
So we just gonna act like we haven't actually seen videos of Biden touching little girls where his dirty hand's shouldn't be?
Dude the left/Democrats are the human traffickers. This isn‚Äôt even a debate. As for Trump, he‚Äôs definitely not a racist, especially if you don‚Äôt consider Biden to be one. I bet you can‚Äôt prove one racist thing that trump has said.

I'd love for Trump to face real consequences. But it's far more important we know the extent of his damage. We need a soup-to-nuts investigation, with results made public. If forswearing prosecutions is how we get there, so be it. But we need to know.
I'll link it, for anyone interested. Trump is adeptly contending with a hostile interviewer. Biden is being thrown total softball questions and cannot form complete sentences in response.
It's not just that Republican mayor posts Biden's VP pick as Aunt Jemima. It's saying, "I had no idea people would react the way they did" when people call him out. It's the entitlement to mock black people - the generational FU. Meet Mayor Barry Presgraves. Wow.
If I'm being perfectly honest, it's just sad that Biden is still in this race. People around him who care about him shouldn't let him do this to himself.

Oh yea, he announced he was a supporter of Trump.  Hmm...  It's puzzling to me why Republicans seem to be sold on this strategy to get Kanye on the ballot. I would venture to say that it is just as, if not more, likely that he will take more votes from Trump than he will Biden.
Republicans will try to steal this election with whatever tools are made available to them. No one should be surprised that this Kanye's candidacy has been an orchestrated attempt to suppress would-be Biden voters.

Unfortunately when we go to the polls now we are forced to vote for the ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù. This election is no different. Wish Biden were 30 years younger.
If you pay attention you can see where the electricity inside Joe Biden's head flickers on and off for several seconds
‚ÄúRiden with Biden‚Äù to the junkyard ü§£
Gonna be so pissed if Joe Biden opts out of the debates against Trump this fall. Been waiting forever to watch these two morons go at it üòê it would make for comedy gold
Wow, the guy who posted this is a mayor?
I‚Äôll take Biden. Plus, I have more hope in who he‚Äôd surround himself with that can get the job done. Definitely not an ideal situation persay.
Fair. And I appreciate the comment.  For me (like many others) it‚Äôs simple...  1. Trump &amp; ‚ÄòTrumpism‚Äô must be defeated. He is void of any moral compass. 2. 3rd party is not an option this election. (I voted 3rdP in ‚Äò16) 3. Biden is a decent man who has a history of bipartisanship.
Haha especially since that clip of Biden where he is being led around like a blind person.
Int: White House Briefing Room.  Biden: About guns, the cows are not, ah ..  I can't tell that joke, but you know I'm straight with ya.  Milk!  Everyone: C'mon man!
Noted author accuses Jared Kushner of ‚Äòplanning last ditch try at disqualifying Biden ballots on election night‚Äô with Barr‚Äôs blessing
I guess Biden would have left American Citizens in China to die, rather than bring them home, and give them a chance to live.
Real headline: "Trump campaign willfully spreading COVID-19 to voters. Biden campaign is not." Fuck civility. Let's trounce these motherfuckers like they deserve. #fuckthegop #fucktrump #fuckmaga #GOPGenocide

Only President Biden can lighten our national mood in these dark times.  'C'mon man!' will be our national catchphrase.
If you have a problem with Biden‚Äôs cognitive situation, you‚Äôre gonna lose your shit when you find out who‚Äôs president.
Doesn‚Äôt matter what Biden does, the election is a referendum on Trump, pure and simple.  If I were advising Biden, I‚Äôd tell him to lay as low as possible.  In 2016 Trump won against the most unpopular candidate in USA, this time its totally about him.
Is a Biden parody?üòÇ  What a joke.‚òùüòÇüëÜ

Biden won‚Äôt go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nominationI hate to break it to you but Biden is losing bigly in November
If Joe Biden gets elected Pewdiepie will be extradited and tried for crimes against humanity ...that is the simulation trajectory we are on
If Biden can't come out of hiding long enough to debate the President of the United States then he has no credibility in running for the highest office in this nation.  Biden has to prove that he can think on his feet and represent his positions in a debate or step down.
We have a Biden sighting. He‚Äôs now working for the Indians. Good for him because he isn‚Äôt winning in November
LOL good news on Corona? That's not allowed....at least until after November....and only if Biden wins
Someone on the Biden team knew when to pounce.
No no. I was asking which Democratic VP candidate is the best of the worst. Trump was doing a great job until coronavirus came along. All while the Democrats did everything to undermine him. But hey that‚Äôs all you got. Nothing. Hence why y‚Äôall are running Biden
I believe you are correct.  It has Biden picking up Wisconsin only and Trump picking up MN and NH.
Dr. Biden. Not a porn star posing naked. That's a first lady.Joe Biden would likely agree with you although his losses are hard to imagine.
I find it absurd he thinks by pushing Kanye to run, he‚Äôll take away votes from Biden.
You are special and sweet, you stick to your views, you stand up with your fellow blue pill takers and you're ready to welcome Biden. For all this, you are loved!
You're gonna vote for Basement Biden????? LOL...
Thanks for sharing. I am happy to see I am already following most of them. An analyst on The Rising mentioned all Blacks are monolithic and will all vote for Joe Biden. It just pissed me the hell off. I know this isn't true. The dude seems like a privileged ahole.
The campaign hasn‚Äôt started in earnest, yet, which should happen after the Dem nominating convention. Even without this, Trump is only 3 points (Rasmussen) behind Biden. Republicans have all the issues. The Dems have no issues that can‚Äôt be easily campaigned against. Trump wins!
If I had to I would wait in line for however many hours it took to vote for Biden
Implying people still have the ability. üòÇ I‚Äôll keep giving you money if you slap joe Biden, deal? üòí
Salvi is a Biden supporter. Anti-American suck up.
Anyone else cringe when Joe Biden?
Lol yeah that‚Äôs gonna work for you guys. There is a difference between senility and putting your foot in your mouth. I have an elderly relative with early dementia. Biden has the same look in his eyes. It‚Äôs not pretty
Rogan isn‚Äôt voting for Biden he says almost every podcast that Biden is mentally losing his mind.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs my African American‚Äù -Joe Biden. Oops, that was Donald fucking Trump.
In case you were unaware, the God of all creation can not be hurt by Joe Biden. The Gospel however is severely damaged by deranged people, like Trump, who represent everything that the Kingdom of God is against. Our God‚Äôs kingdom is one of peace and love. Trump‚Äôs god is money.
If Joe Biden could hurt the bible I might actually vote for him.
Hey, Biden isn‚Äôt the Left! He‚Äôs a centrist, corportate lacky. The DNC is no longer left. They are centrist.
Biden could pick dog shit for his running mate and I would vote for him and his dog shit with a smile on my face. Anyone pulling this garbage about not voting for him because of his vp pick just wants to vote for trump but needs a reason to make themselves feel better about it.
Biden picks Harris as Vp. If he wins his cabinet will use 25th Amendment to remove him. Harris becomes President and taps Susan Rice as new VP!
I know it seems like an outdated concept but what about patriotism, putting our country over Party  ? If Biden is not elected, our democracy will not survive. The new Republican Party is pushing us towards a fascist dictatorship. Your dad would vote for  .
Biden's comments this morning; I would say this guy has lost his mind. I am predicting he will pick K. Harris as VP. If Biden wins they will use The 25th Amendment to remove him. Giving the presidency to Harris, who in turn will tap Susan Rice to be VP! #Hannity #FoxAndFriends
If Biden isn‚Äôt elected, we‚Äôll cease to be a democracy. We‚Äôll be lucky if we can hang on until 1/20/21. To all of you ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a Republican all my life‚Äù-this isn‚Äôt the Republican Party of the past. They‚Äôre promoting a fascist dictatorship. Keep America a democratic republic.
No one suggested an equivalence until you popped up, moron. The tweet didn't compare or even mention Trump. It just said the Biden plan is shit, because it is. Obviously the Trump plan is shittier. Doesn't make the Biden plan good.
just now Biden said all black people are the same, unlike Hispanics. I want Biden to run for President forever.
Officer Harris # 1 pick. Rice # 1 pick if Biden to win. Aspiration v. Establishment.
The union is behind Biden. I‚Äôm a postal employee and The union has never seen a dime of my money. There are more people that work in my office that are Trump supporters than our Biden supporters.
The union endorsed Biden. Not the post office. Not all of us are off our rocker. In my office there are more Trump supporters than Biden supporters.
It's called "Biden's going into a rest home, so lets scare the hell out of everyone prior to election day"
We can be, but do understand that not everyone wants to be right now. The Left in this country is having an awakening in ways it hasn't in 40 years, and that's a VERY good thing, for everyone. Understand tho, Biden is not Left, nor is he really a Democrat. AOC is Left of center.
Then you're alright by my book. We can disagree on some things; I won't vote for Biden, for example, but I live in a Red State, so it's a non-issue for me. You may feel differently. I don't think Profit, as a concept, is generally good, nor should Billionaires exist.
Biden Denied Holy Communion.
#LincolnVoter I refused to vote for Trump in 2016 because I knew he'd make a horrible President, instead voting Libertarian.   The party has become completely dominated by Trump, abandoning fiscally conservative Republicans.  I'm voting for Joe Biden!
I forget that there's an election coming up. Trump has never stopped campaigning and Biden's whole game plan seems to be "Well everyones minds are made up."  Feels like presidential campaigns don't even exist anymore because it's just been years of campaigning as the new normal.

My journey began with W. I voted Romney and still like him. If you think voting Biden would hurt, imagine how I felt choosing a Clinton #LincolnVoter
Everyone needs to understand how to decipher these leftist satanists. Joe Biden was telling you he's high on cocaine when he said that.
Joe Biden is no longer traveling to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a report.
That was Biden telling the whole world he was high on cocaine in that interview. This is the methodology behind the satanic left. Bring up things about others you are guilty of. Satanists are compelled to do this.
Biden is high on cocaine
I fear they are going to indict Biden or Obama officials on trumped up charges over the Russian investigation. Barr alluded to it. I am becoming paranoid. Every darn day there‚Äôs a new crisis/corruption!
If the media is afraid of COVID for Biden, how could he perform his presidential duties which would include leaving his bunker. Can you imagine an inauguration in his basement???
Of course Donald Trump the fake media are going to say whatever they can to make Joe Biden look good you can't make something that ugly look good
Laura Ingraham more to my debate announcement Joe Biden has dementia they're wanting a black lady to run for vice president because they know that Joe cannot handle being president so that the vice president would be taking over nothing against having a black lady president!!!

How do you know Biden‚Äôs plan, Donnie? ‚ÄúMany people say?‚Äù ‚Äú Most people don‚Äôt know, but you do?‚Äù üôÑ
Lol carrying Biden‚Äôs water. What a disgrace the NYT has become
Biden wouldn't have to debate, as so many idiots are advising him, if he'd change literally one policy position: #M4A  If he changed &amp; supported marijuana legalization as well he wouldn't even have to fundraise. He'd win 40 states and DC.  I'd still hate him but it's THAT simple.
Tried to watch Chris Wallace last night on Fox News Channel. He is obnoxious, over talks guests if he doesn't  like their responses. Doubt he would do Biden that way!
Biden can't make up his mind?
Only one lunchtime threadlift in the bunch. Officer H isn't polling well among my Dem voter pals, but Biden or bust sure tf is.

Again, Nov 3rd. Two choices, the shitshow we‚Äôre in now, or Biden. Period.
A war monger, by your own admission, who didn‚Äôt vote for military action every time. We have a choice on Nov. 3rd, Biden or trump. No way in hell should any sane American vote to re-elect trump.
I love how you people cherry pick little bits and pieces from history for your ‚Äúfacts‚Äù. Biden being diplomatic and being an angry fear monger like those in power now is something to strive for. I guess Biden stating that Bush &amp; Cheney were the opposition totally slipped by you?

I fear indictments on Biden and other Obama administration personnel, maybe  personnel who investigated the Russian interference.
Okay, I‚Äôll bite. Send me a link to a Biden ad that will change my mind.
...you DO know he still has supporters...right? Like, he beat Hillary last time with that thinking. Biden needs a good VP to win.
I absolutely know that VP will have a major impact on the Presidency, likely far more than normal. Biden is 78. He's not gonna make it past 2024 with the kind of stress he'll be under. He knows that, we all know that. He's a one-term president.
Not that my vote matters, nor am I planning on voting for Biden, but still. Ugh.  Joe can you just like, escape into the woods never to be seen from again so we can even attempt to prevent the oncoming war humanity will wage on itself over resources due to Climate change? Please?
Here's what sucks. I can't stand Kamala. She's a cop, and her supporters are he most vile, privileged little shitstains on Earth.  And yet, she's Biden's best pick. She's further Left, by voting record, than any of his other options, and she's everything he's not.  But ugh.
I don‚Äôt give a damn who is or is not a Biden supporter but as an ICU nurse who has to watch people die alone. To wish that on anyone is deplorable. I‚Äôm not a fan of either one and would love for a true contender to step up
Biden has a plan. Trump is a socialist. He redistributes wealth upward to himself and his donors.
Three of my four sons are young adults in that age group. All three registered to vote and will be voting for Biden in November. Two of them have been to protests in our town. This age group is energized.
Lol ok u got it. Karen's definitely need to vote Biden üòÅ

According to Biden it's at least the year 2040.
I'm not that optimistic yet, but worst case scenario we go with Plan B and launch the Bernie-filled Biden at the oval office window with a trebuchet.
We'll give you Joe Biden as a gift of surrender. Then in the middle of the night Bernie will climb out of Biden's broken open body and fuck you up while you sleep-off the inevitable global drunken celebration following Trump losing 2020.  Fuck metaphors. That's the literal plan.
Oh god . . . a grassroots group of former Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporters who recognize Joe Biden's flaws but know that our nation will not survive four more years of Donald Trump.I‚Äôm not defending any terrible shit Biden does/has done. I am not a Trump supporter. Like I said, on the racism meter, both of them register. But one is on a significantly different level of that meter than the other.
I‚Äôll put it this way. If Trump loses, it‚Äôll be a tough day for racism, but not as tough of a day as it should be. Wouldnt call myself a Biden supporter. Not running around waving his flag or putting his sticker on my car, but if I‚Äôm choosing between the two on the racism meter...
So true. That is why Biden was refused communion
Believe it or not, the President said that VP Biden hurt God. How he would know that? This coming from a man who's Church is the Golf Course. He had protesters attacked so he could have a picture standing in front of a church holding up a Bible up side down &amp; backwards
My guy you don‚Äôt have a single opinion that isn‚Äôt exactly the same as Joe Biden, you are a Democrat :p
Biden...  That guy says some stupid shit!
Guess Biden won't win Louisiana now!
But the D‚Äôs are losing them by the thousands. Especially the younger generations! I‚Äôm mixed black and white. And these no chance I‚Äôm voting Biden, not voting Trump either. But racism no matter how small is a NO GO for me, period!
Not really, the left can‚Äôt stand what he said either. And I follow and know plenty of black leftists. They can‚Äôt stand Biden or what he said. Everyone dismissed all the black people who don‚Äôt vote D. And is there is a handful. It‚Äôs just not true. Yes, the majority vote D.
This isn‚Äôt a game show called ‚Äúguess what Biden meant‚Äù not interested in having to decipher his words after he says them. Use the correct wording in the first place.

Biden was denied holy communion hence not a good catholic. Yet he claims he is. Biden is corrupt  please do not trust him
When morality is in my favor there‚Äôs no feigning, just fact. And as of May 4th eight women have accused Biden of inappropriate behavior. You‚Äôre voting for a racist predator and then pretending you have any high ground. You don‚Äôt.
First of all, the kids were put in cages under Biden‚Äôs administration. Second, don‚Äôt preach to me about the pandemic, I‚Äôm the one working on it. Third, I care about putting a good candidate in office. You‚Äôre voting for a predator, I‚Äôm voting for a doctor.

It‚Äôs only fitting that ole Bern would urge Biden to pick #Tulsi as his VP since she always has his back &amp; sacrificed so much for him in 2016.  And that‚Äôs why he won‚Äôt do it.  Bernie is a cowardly fake phony fraud &amp; always has been. He‚Äôs a bullsh*+ liar who has stolen your money.
Biden isn‚Äôt exactly ahead in the polls because, people like him. He‚Äôs ahead because trump is a screw up. Biden has had this election handed to him on a silver platter. He has to put in zero work. And if he wins, he‚Äôll change nothing. And we‚Äôll be right back in the same spot!
Real socialists don‚Äôt support Biden ...BOT
No the VP won‚Äôt become president. Biden will remain president. The VP will sit in the background.
You didn‚Äôt learn anything from this post. Why even bother commenting. We aren‚Äôt voting for Biden.
Yes..it's really called a shadow government, and if Biden is elected you will see it
The longer they delay (VP, debates, policy, possible cabinet) the harder it is for the Trump campaign to develop a attack strategy. I don't think Biden nor whoever his VP is will ever see a debate stage
But what about when Joe Biden is saying that we need to re-elect Donald Trump??
But, what about their rights? You can't step on their rights to be blown away or drowned in a storm. Besides, the storm is probably a hoax created by the deep state, HRC, Hunter Biden and the radical left.
Of course we have more cases we have way more people than other countries we are comparing too. I go by % not total number. In the beginning he was shutting down air travel from countries like China and Biden and Democrats was calling him a xenophobia for it.
The silent majority will win again and you will be crying like 2016 when the most corrupt person in politics Hillary lost. Plus Biden needs help finding the White House he doesn‚Äôt even know where he‚Äôs at in his basement!
I don‚Äôt understand why people think the VP pick matters at all. They think the VP is going to replace Biden lol. Literally hanging their hopes on a pipe dream.

As far as I am concerned Biden has won the debate already. 45 is too crazy to be able to hold it together on any debate platform and his enablers know that.

Trump reportedly hired her because she looked good on television.   - The first amendment explicitly prohibits mixing religion and government. This is one of the first things Biden and the new Dem House and Senate must restore. END THE RFRA.

Listen to the black pastors. Do not vote for pedophile Biden. This is Satanic. Do not bow down to the black king the devil. You should only bow to the Lord Jesus Christ. Every knee shall bow &amp; every tongue confess that he is Lord. The BLM is a satanic cult. Please young people.
Biden said the black people have no wiggle room in diversity. That‚Äôs true because your racist. You keep your own self oppressd. You would not have gotten where you were opprd or 70% of pro athletes. I guess it‚Äôs true‚ÄîBeyonce, you &amp; LeBron sold you soul to the Black King the devil
long odds but Keisha Lance Bottoms would be strong asset to Biden. She is articulate, center-left and could carry GA. No national experience but won a brutal campaign to become Mayor of Atlanta.
If I am a racist then your a pedophile. Anybody that votes for Biden is a pedophile &amp; supports child trafficking. You are the racist. Just ask all the black pastors in the black communities. Everything you &amp; BLM stand for is satanic &amp; shame on you, may God have mercy on your soul
KEEP INCOMPETENT BIDEN OUT!Biden will be a figure head doing what he‚Äôs told by the ‚ÄúREAL‚Äù behind-the-scenes President and do whatever Marxist groups like BLM tell him to do. We would see a massive decline in this country. Things that BLM want, actually happening, is terrifying.

BLM --- IS a #Marxist, terrorist organization. It has nothing to do with helping Black Americans. As for the  he never said that the KKK are fine people. He said that there are fine people on both sides of the issue, which is true. And Biden won't win the Black vote.

I am SO ready to get a good night's sleep, thanks to Biden, the adult.
I think at the end of the day, Trump pulls it out on the back of rural and suburban voters. As tricky of a candidate as he is, Biden is worse. Just my opinion. You?

If not showing up at all won‚Äôt fly, the fallback will be to rig the debate. Trump will have to spar with the kind of accusatory hectoring the media serve up in press briefings while Biden coasts along on ‚Äúboxers or briefs‚Äù and other softball questions his team has written for him

There won‚Äôt be any jobs in 4 months if Biden wins. Him and his Muslim, non-American buddy Barrack were pretty good at it last time. Maybe he can kiss your neck and touch your knee and make it all go away. Lol!
So.......When Biden says, "come on (man)", how come he's not castrated by the "woke"? Where are the, "their are 37 genders" groups?
Why should Biden answer questions when Trump is doing such a bang up job making Biden look good every time he opens his mouth?

If you can't bring yourself to vote for Biden, you still don't have to vote for Trump. You can vote for a third party candidate, write in someone, or simply leave that part of the ballot blank.  Sometimes, NOT voting is the best protest available.
Kamala. Has the credentials and checks the boxes. No one will remember she flubbed the debates and attacked Biden (least of all Biden).
I've been thinking. I often tweet that voting is the ultimate protest, but for some Republicans, it may be not voting.  They might want Trump to lose, but can't vote for Biden. In that case, they can stay away from the polls or leave the vote for President blank.
Well keep it up, I need you around to witness that Biden victory üòÇ

I said he would pick Hillary.  Because the convention had to pick Biden on the first ballot.  So Biden Clinton ticket.  Then a few days later, Biden steps down and Hillary moves to the Top and then picks a running mate.
Biden has said he needs someone who can step in immediately. I have no favorite left in the finalist. I was a Klobuchar supporter. I thought she could carry the farm belt and kicks ass in a debate. I went to see her speak. She has a lot of heart.
For once I agree with Trump. Putin has done a brilliant job. He has done a brilliant job of making Trump his water boy.

Yeah I‚Äôm sure this is right because the whole world of governments love Trump so much right?  U can‚Äôt have it both ways.  We all know they are terrified of a Biden presidency don‚Äôt we?  Of course not. He is the best friend of America‚Äôs enemies.

That‚Äôs Biden telling a lie.
He might, but I don't know. He and Biden are both terrible candidates and circumstances aren't working to the favor of either.
Sure, people may blame him for the pandemic response, economy slump, trade wars, closure of sports, but probably not the riots and violence like I forwarded. That's my point. Will ppl see that video yelling at the woman as Biden's ppl rioting?
So what is your take on Biden's OBVIOUS racist comment from yesterday?? And then to try and explain what he actually meant and not even BOTHER to APOLOGIZE??? If Trump had said what Biden had said YOU WOULD BE RELENTLESSLY yelling at Trump. You're nothing but a hypocrite......
Also, let‚Äôs say Biden wins. Is he now God‚Äôs choice? Will you give him the same support you give Trump?
‚ÄúI want to take the guns.‚Äù -Joe Biden Or did a few hundred million Americans only imagine that interview happened?
Here's another thing I don't want to say. I've seen many people ask (unqualified) how could we reelection Trump, but if voters link Portland etc. violence to Biden, then they'll likely vote against him. Every election has a broad context.
‚Äú... in terms of physical size.‚Äù  is correct about that. Biden isn‚Äôt obese and doesn‚Äôt move around like Bigfoot.   FYI, we prefer Joe precisely because doesn‚Äôt behave like Trump. Trump is a mistake this country cannot remedy fast enough.
Disappointment. Biden may be the better choice, but that doesn't make him a *good* choice.

This. So much this. Between Biden and almost anyone else might be informative, I might learn something from the dialogue, consider a point or three. In this case, I can't stomach the thought unless it was "gloves off".
People who would vote for Biden should realize they're not voting for Biden.
Joe Biden Will Pick A Black Woman As His VP
She is wrong also. Biden is about on schedule for naming a running mate. It happens around this time on every campaign.
BREAKING: The DSA has just voted to endorse Elizabeth Warren over Joe Biden.
Because it won‚Äôt be Biden. I completely believe someone will step in, pick a VP and those 2 finishe the race. They aren‚Äôt trying to find a VP, they are working on The Who the nominee is.
Biden is an idiot. Everybody knows it.

Comey has run his mouth against our President, but now we know he was every bit as corrupt as Kickback Biden.  If he doesn't go to jail then we know we have two systems of justice and we must not stand for that.
My sister is visiting a town just outside of MN, 1 homemade Biden sign and too many to count  signs. Polls are garbage and no indication of the election. #TRUMP2020 #MINNESOTA
If knew how to read charts, you self would know that your numbers are on a decline while Biden's are on a incline.
We needs to remember our #HumanityFirst principles. Look guys, some won‚Äôt vote for Biden like  and some won‚Äôt vote for Trump like  Others are just writing in  That‚Äôs their choice. After Nov 3rd were all #yang2024 let‚Äôs not forget that.
If these two states go blue on November 3rd, Trump‚Äôs chances of winning are about ~1%. Really can‚Äôt see Biden winning Georgia though.
Biden was one heartbeat away from being in charge of the Nuclear football for 8 years.  I trust him more than the idiot who sends federal troops to silence his own people or pulls troops from Germany or abandons allies on the battlefield on a whim, w/o discussing with JCOS.

"Biden is so close to a VP pick he can smell her"..  Now you know good and well he can't pick a twelve year old girl.

And every damn one of them are totally corrupt, aren't they Kickback Biden.

I just hate the idea of "debating" a habitual liar! If moderators don't fact check  Trump's bullshit in real time, how can Biden be expected to effectively respond? Refuting lies the entire time is a losing proposition, for an honest debate, which is what it will devolve into.
Go to jail Kickback Biden.
Should former Vice President Joe Biden win the White House in November, America will likely be in for a foreign policy about-face as Biden reverses, dismantles or severely curtails many of President Donald Trump‚Äôs most significant and boldest actions.

Yes absolutely no tax income.  U lose election.   Leave economy in worse shape.. blame it on biden right?

Joe is wrong - in 2016 Trump didn't have a record and could get away with lies and promises, now he has a record that Biden can and SHOULD hold him accountable to.   Anyone seeking the highest office in the land is obligated to stand up publicly and confront their challenger.

Oh yeah not to mention her lawyer was lisa bloom who was a lawyer for weinstein yet railed against conservatives. It was actually proven that bloom paid cash for people to accuse trump. Its quite funny how you allow that to be buried
Her "story" has more holes than swiss cheese. But yeah let's back this one.
the scrip was awful, cinematography could use work and the main character was the doctor, supported by obama with a biden cameo. guess that would pretty much be the 'biden' admin
Biden has said he values experience above politics (state-winning) or electability (being likable). Based on his personal experience of being VP, he believes you need someone who understands wrangling legislation through Congress. He‚Äôs absolutely right.
I wonder if Kickback Biden's name is on the list of visitors to the now infamous island of children.
Agree. Biden should be ready with his cabinet November 4th because when Trump loses he will spiral.
But Biden is good on foreign policy which is why Obama picked him. He needs someone who can credibly relate to younger voters &amp; progressive caucus. And once elected assist on current domestic issues like voting, police &amp; immigration reform where Biden is  mired in the past.
Its Obama and Biden vs Trump and Russia.
Wallace is Bush, Obama, Romney, Clinton, Biden.   He'll never forget where he was when the Romney/Ryan ticket was announced.
Meredith: she doesn't like Hillary, thinks she's a prude and hoity-toity. Would've traded paper supplies for Trump steaks as well as Outback. But the Rona has her having to home school her asshole kid. And she likes how she looks in a mask. She's Trump-Biden.
Biden is working with Bernie Sanders to get ideas to win, Biden said he wants more Muslims here in a speech today. Is he crazy or what !! He needs a mental checkup with Nancy Pelosi, Dementia is setting in !!
Biden would do well to choose Susan Rice imo. Loads of Station Department experience.
He‚Äôs saving it to try and drown out Biden‚Äôs VP announcement, if he actually has anything at all (probably complete bullshit &amp; lies)
But this is if there isn‚Äôt an EC win, right? I believe Biden is going to win handily.
TS for them. Biden IS going to WIN.
You didn‚Äôt do this with Obama, all the jobs went overseas. We the real people don‚Äôt believe you comrade Biden

Yeah. Weird new sensation to basically respond to every email and throw a few bucks on the weekly. Even got a couple of shirts. I was into Warren and doing it for her and then just multiplied that when Biden became the person.

no, without voter fraud, he...um... Biden doesn't stand a chance

Yes but id rather trump then biden.

Can‚Äôt find a Biden sign in Delaware but can find a trump sticker on a black bear
I would not call it ironic as I‚Äôm showing through do the same intentionally. Yet I am also proving a point that abortion is more serious than Covid. While I do not like Trump he is not fighting FOR Covid and is fighting AGAINST abortion. I can not say the same for Biden.
Joe Biden sent his wife to appear on  show.
No worries.  Covid has become a political weapon - the OP is using it as such. She is ‚Äúinterjecting‚Äù numbers of an evil to go against a politician. Yet that politician is not fighting for COVID to exist where Biden is w/ the evil of abortion. Her post is dumb
Again - my point is directed at the OP and her use of persuasion - not the incompetence of Trump. - To use this to pass blame on the image &amp; then to put an election count down as a header is persuasive rhetoric. I could do the same w/ an abortion ad/Biden &amp; put the countdown
8 months ago Biden said he would cure cancer if we elected him. How sick is that? Give me power and I‚Äôll cure your sickness
As my prior reply created confusion (I left it up) let me be more clear. -  To use an image and #s to pass blame on the image and then to put an election count down as a header is persuasive rhetoric. I could do the same w/ an abortion ad and Biden and then put the countdown -
I don't think this is that sort of thing. I'd say Trump is both authentic and frequently disturbing. I'd also say Joe Biden is objectively in cognitive decline.
The NYT is saying we should scrap the debates. I said months ago they wouldn't happen. The reason is simple. Biden is in serious decline. I'm not saying that should stop you from voting for him. Someone else will govern backstage. But it might be good to figure out who that is.
I want to add that I think it would be extremely sad.  My mother has dementia and it's just not funny.  Shame on Jill Biden.
Yes.  It's tradition.  If Biden can't debate, a new candidate should be nominated immediately.  Of course, this won't happen.  The elderly abuse will continue.
Honestly my 1 year old daughter could probably beat Trump in a debate. Then again, she could probably beat Biden as well.
Trump supporters. By not voting for Biden, they‚Äôre supporting Trump.
With polls shifting, I wonder if the Democrat party is rethinking its "Biden as brand, not candidate" strategy. Will he actually have to campaign, and if they think so, will they seek to nominate someone else instead? And how could they justify anyone other than Bernie?

From the perspective of an external (stationary) observer, yes. "Slowed" to light speed in fact. From the spaceship you'd see it travel away at the speed of light. Everybody*, regardless of motion, sees light travel at the speed of light.  *Except Joe Biden, obviously.
Joe Biden is so tough in one dimension that he only gets lasagnafied if he falls into a black hole.
If Joe Biden is on a spaceship doing 0.99c and he turns on a torch, the light goes at 1.99c

Looks like Joe Biden trying get a thought out
It's October 2020. At a speech on prison reform, Biden mentions that black people commit half of all murders. Trump calls it "disgraceful."  tweets out the clip, saying "Racist Joe Biden just lost black voters!" Two weeks later, Biden wins 94% of the black vote.
There's nothing going on in Biden's mind. He lost it
Biden: Worked under Obama for 8 years and his campaign rescued by Jim Clyburn. Trump violated FAIR housing and has been known to be a prolific user of racial slurs.

The obviously bad faith attacks calling Biden racist reminder me of the obviously bad faith attacks in the UK calling Corbyn anti-semitic. In both cases, people took their priors and used it to justify the slightest transgressions.  Then again, the attacks on Corbyn *worked*.
So to keep tabs, over the past week Joe Biden's two big "gaffes" are:  1. Saying black voters have less political diversity than Latinos (true) 2. After a reporter asked him if he took a mental fitness test, he jokingly asked the reporter if he took a drug test  Who cares??
Biden wants to destroy oil, raise taxes, and get back into bed with China. That‚Äôs not exactly a winning message in rust belt states.
Oh absolutely.  Biden is the inferior choice between him and Bernie.  BECAUSE OF HIS POLICIES.  Saying his car is somehow the problem is no better than saying Bernie doesn't genuinely want income inequality because "he has three houses".  It's a disingenuous attack.
Another thing is the news media cleaned up this statement for Biden. Have they ever did that for Pres. Trump? NO!
Joe Biden says just as much if not more controversial things than Trump does soooo maybe vote third party (?)
Joe Biden your nothing but a career politician that lies to get ahead. We don't want you in government at all.

Hey, you know people can still support him and also think he made a weird statement.  I'll take Joe "My dad could drive a car" Biden over Donald "Grab em by the pussy" Trump any day.  Doesn't make it not a goofy thing to say.

Nobody said it was.  But you used a VERY Republican argument with your "If you want a second house, just go get one."  Bernie having those three homes doesn't make him a hypocrite.  But throwing shade at Biden for something also true of Bernie does make YOU a hypocrite.

As the obese Haitian female caretaker repeatedly punches the wheelchair-bound boomer and tells him to "shutcho white ass up", the boomer has one final, dying thought as consciousness slips away from him: "Can you BELIEVE what Joe Biden said about African-Americans today??"
He's (once again) attacking Biden for making some dumb joke a decade ago about Indians working at 7/11, and calling Obama articulate. I've seen him play these clips dozens of times. I don't get it. Does he think literally anyone cares? Why play by the Left's rules on racism?
Fucking stupid. It‚Äôs either rebuild our democratic republic back to the Obama standings (Biden) or become more of an authoritarian state (Trump). Why the fuck could any real American struggle with this???

It‚Äôs wild that he‚Äôs trying to make shit up to call Biden‚Äôs cognitive abilities into question and he can‚Äôt even keep his own lies straight. If there are palm trees everywhere, then the man was very damn likely in Florida.
Many comments under the tweet are from MAGAs and Qanon folks who think this is related to the Obama/Biden administration...
Way to make Biden sound like a superhero, Trump.
Biden‚Äôs point is that politically, Latinos have different views regionally. That‚Äôs true‚Äîthey‚Äôre conservative in Florida, nearly evenly split in Texas, and liberal in the Southwest.   That‚Äôs not true for blacks, who vote Democrat as a block everywhere. Why attack an obvious truth?
35% of Latinos vote Republican. 5% of blacks vote Republican.  Unlike African Americans, Latinos hail from dozens of different countries.  Latinos can be black, white, indigenous, or mixed.  By literally what metric is Biden wrong? Can a single Republican tell me?

"BunkerJoe" has set the premise to be used to avoid the debates. His camp has announced that Mr. Biden will NOT attend the convention in Milwaukee because of the virus, and the health risk!...very convenient! He will use the same excuse to avoid being on stage with Our President!
Can't wait to see President Trump destroy Joe Biden on stage in front of a national audience . Will be beautiful to watch.
Another Biden word salad.  Words put together in random order that make no sense !  The man is a mess !
Excellent idea! You should get in touch with Biden‚Äôs people.
How about ‚ÄúBiden will not be present in Milwaukee to accept Democratic presidential nomination‚Äù
Shocker!  His team will do anything to keep him hidden and in a controlled environment.
This is the problem with the left's extreme rhetoric on things like climate change. If they *really* thought the world was ending in 20 years, they would take Biden over Trump--at least he'd rejoin Paris accords, etc.  By refusing to endorse Biden, they admit they're bluffing.
All the DSA/Chapo nerds are seething that Chomsky endorsed Biden, but it's a perfectly moral choice if you actually mean what you say.  You can't spend 4 years saying that Drumph is literally creating concentration camps on our border, then be like, "Meh, but I don't like Biden."
In this era of popular support for #CriminalJusticeReform (finally) Biden picking #KamalaHarrisForVP would be the absolute worst decision. Not only did she not fight against unjust laws but she happily enforced them. She's never hinted at regret, either.

Obviously all the Biden people have figured out it's probably not a very good idea to have him debate, but most are smart enough to be quiet about it.  Bill, on the other hand, is obviously not very bright, which is why you have him here saying the quiet part out loud.
Look I know you guys all think Biden is senile and incapable of debating, but you're supposed to pretend that you don't think that. You're kind of blowing your cover here man.
Bozo is going to have lot to do for biden admin.
And exactly what has Biden said he would have done different than to say President Trump is handling things wrong and that he would do things differently?
This is so patronizing. Jill Biden isn‚Äôt running for president. Why isn‚Äôt  being interviewed? This is farce.

Would you really vote for someone that has to be hidden because of his state of mind?? Seriously please tell me why you‚Äôd vote for Joe Biden. I have zero respect for him or his record but I am profoundly sad that his family won‚Äôt step up and end the embarrassment.
I don't believe your Presidential polls at all. Joe Biden leading  by 10+ points? That's laughable. Biden couldn't debate a 6th grader much less our President!?? Are you folks nuts??? Have you lost your minds?? Have you folks actually watched Biden speak?
I'm not saying Biden would debate well either. I'm saying it would just be two senile retards arguing with neither really getting a bump in the polls. It'd probably just depress turnout a bit.
Feel like I'm taking crazy pills seeing all these conservatives say how desperate they are to have Trump debate Biden. Trump was not a very good debater in 2016. Does everyone just have selective memory? He had a few funny lines we all remember but he fumbled through 90% of it.
Do you really think we would believe that you would tell us if you did see any Biden supporters ? Ha!
I wonder if Biden will challenge the election results if he were declared the winner...
But what about your trip to "Frorida"?   Biden shouldn't agree to a debate. He should just ask you to spell shit.
If The Rock ran for president....fuck a Joe Biden. America would instantly be badass again
If the do, Trump should ‚Äúdebate‚Äù Biden‚Äôs platform directly from his campaign site. Just rip ‚Äúhis‚Äù dumbass ideas to shreds.
I‚Äôd rather be voting for  but voting for Biden gets rid of Trump so
If Biden &amp; pals chicken out of the debates,  &amp; pals should hold their own televised debates where Trump pulls senile China Joe‚Äôs policies from his campaign website and rips them to shreds. Would be ratings gold AND the end of Joe‚Äôs  campaign.
So did Obama &amp; Biden...
I have always thought polls were wrong showing Trump losing. The stock market has continued to climb, liberal polls only call someone with a land line, and there is no way we have that many stupid people that would vote for Biden.
If Biden (his handlers) avoids the debates,   should hold televised sessions where he reads Biden‚Äôs policy stances directly from his campaign website and rips them to shreds.
Hiding Biden from the beat down Trump would hand hom on the debate stage will be the democrat tactic.
‚ÄòNOT a joke‚Äô: Dan Bongino has the ‚Äòscoop‚Äô on Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline and it‚Äôs just getting WORSE and worse for the Democrats

If he loses to Biden in 2020 (he should), it‚Äôs over for him. Biden won‚Äôt run in 2024, it‚Äôll be his VP. And the Republicans won‚Äôt let him win the nomination. They‚Äôll either keep him from the ballot, or theyll just straight up not support his candidacy.

And Biden speaks coherently?????
Susan Rice, what you showed in the Benghazi massacre shows how you work under pressure. You want to be VP. Susan Rice or not everyone will lose if Joe Biden wins in 2020. Mostly our country.

You are ok with what Biden.  Obama and Hillary did ???
If we do not elect Biden by clear and concise numbers we may have trouble getting trump out of office. I don‚Äôt believe our democracy will survive 4 more yrs of trump. I am going to take picture of my ballot in case I need it later. #VoteTrumpOut2020
So IMO did Barr prove in the hearing yesterday that he is dt's lackey?  Did the republicans in that hearing seem to think that was ok? I think so. We must vote in numbers even greater than mid-terms. We must put Biden in office by a landslide.If you vote for Biden you are pretty way far left, the way he is puppeted these days...AND didn‚Äôt you and Cindy say you would be voting for him? I think you did! To vote that LEFT...YES, it means NEVER Republican!
Y‚Äôall forgot all the racist legislation he has introduced or supported his entire career. It‚Äôs only convenient for him to not be a racist now... Biden is a joke and will never be the president. He‚Äôs also one of the most corrupt people to ever run for the office.
Biden will pardon his. There are no good guys left.
Does Trump realize all our troops that are not home do Mail in ballets? This man is not right!!! He‚Äôs just not!! I live in Memphis Tenn. in the SOUTH &amp; a Democrat! Alot of the South are REPUBLICANS I WAS until Barack Obama &amp; from then on DEMOCRATE. You have to win Mr. Joe Biden!
If Biden now has all the answers on how to ‚Äúfix‚Äù America, why didn‚Äôt he (as VP) share them with Obama during the Great Recession that drug on for 8 years?? Also, where are all of his legislative successes in a 36 year Senate career (other than enriching his family)??I already do that. So if I can do anything else, it'll be to vote Biden and hope Kim can get  into treatment.
Here‚Äôs my main point, Trump sucks and I‚Äôd crooked, Biden and Harris have straight up changed the laws that have ruined lives for decades... don‚Äôt get fooled by recency
I guess we‚Äôre doing this then, Biden. I‚Äôve accepted this. Sigh.
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?
Biden should hold off his pick until the GOP convention. I got $100 Pence gets shoved aside for Haley if Joe takes Kamala.

History books are gonna have an entire chapter on 2020. Remains to be seen whether Russia or China writes it.
Joe Biden, for the last 50 some odd years has been next to Philly, Baltimore, and DC, and you want to think he has more in common with a segregationist who represented dirt roads and cotton plantations. Playa please. Delaware ain‚Äôt the south.
Biden says he would stop border wall construction if elected president
Smart people see him for what he is vote for biden our lives depend on it
BTW... Biden is not Dixiecrat. Calling him Strom Thurmond is ridiculous. Biden has plenty of cringeworthy comment, and legislation to criticize; but dude is a Bill Clinton. But he also has 8 years of working under Barack Obama to see how a popular presidency is run.
Trump is a crook, Biden/Harris are literally responsible for an assload of people being in jail that shouldn‚Äôt.
They both are dammit. One has the racists on 10 and feeling like they can literally get away with murder. I‚Äôm hoping Biden picks a strong vp cause he ain‚Äôt gonna make it. I just feel like Biden‚Äôs cabinet won‚Äôt be trying to rob the country blind.
So what you gonna do ? Not vote?  We not voting for Biden, we voting for normalcy. Vote in the right congressman and senators to force the presidential hand. I‚Äôm really voting for his Vice President cause he ain‚Äôt gonna make it four years.

If Russia was interfering in the election (they are) and Biden's orbit were talking to and meeting with Russians and not including dealings on disclosures &amp; denying meetings &amp; phone calls, and lying about adoptions, etc. I would hope Trump/DOJ/FBI would look at those individuals
Compare the racist &amp; other gaffes of Biden to that of Trump, &amp; the fact that you &amp; your GOP colleagues have never spoken to that, makes you no better than him. A gaffe, btw, is defined as an unintentional act or remark, which shows no willful intent, which can't be said of Trump.
And please tell me how what Biden has done is worse than Trump saying ‚Äúgrab them by their pussy‚Äù 20 years ago....
Why does everyone forgive Biden for his past politics? I swear this country is more brain dead than him.

I think Biden's promise to reverse the Hyde Amendment has really jeopardized his chances of wooing evangelicals who don't like Trump.  There is a huge segment of America that sees this position as a deal breaker.  If it weren't for that one thing, he might win by a landslide.
Maturity! The (C) Bill still affect blks today! It's suicide to choose Biden: a true oppressor! On the other hand Trump clearly hates our ppl! So what's stopping him from doing the same as BIDEN? Either way our ppl are suffering! No one wants to give REPARATIONS but we still vote

Joe Biden, Susan Rice, and Seal Team Six - American Thinker
"Joe Biden is against your grandmother" may need some clarification.
Biden confuses cognitive test with a drug test. He just cannot connect his thoughts. It is sad that this old man is allowed to suffer publicly in such a humiliating way.
Mr. Biden, by your Freudian slips you have confirmed that the Democrats have to keep the blacks as second class citizens to keep their votes.  Give them the opportunity to learn and complete for jobs to curtail racism not affirmative action and quotas systems. Trump loves you.
That being said, all white people, including Biden should strive to be anti-racist.  Could he have used a different analogy? Sure. But if  &amp; TeamTrump are going to dwell on this line, let's make sure they share the entire quote for the full thought pattern here.
I indeed think he was pointing out a racist stereotype. Do I think Biden made it as a racist remark towards the reporter? Biden's white, the reporters is black. We cannot ignore that. As white people we make statements(some label microagressions). I don't think it was his motive.
If Trump (or any R) said "there's no diversity in the black community" the MSM would call for their resignation.  The leftist controlled MSM has Biden "clarify" and they move on.  THAT is privilege.  Democrat/leftist privilege.  It's real, it's systemic, and it happens every day.
You could write a book about the number of abortions Trump has forced and paid for but he‚Äôs not Biden so it‚Äôs fine.

The comment was conjecture, opinion and a question. White men will support Biden. Yrump supporters are their own breed. Bigger problem will be virus and access.
Both are wild cards, Trump can flip flop based on the word of the day. Biden is definitely gonna be a DNC puppet. Trump gives a better chance for the Democratic Party to change while Biden makes us stuck with the same crap. Trump does go against the est. at times at least
I am 50/50 on it. Biden was part of the Obama administration that helped us get out of the last recession and the Trump administration stacked onto it. Part of me wants to test Trump and the other part feels like Biden brings needed stability
Biden is a million times more a Christian than Trump. And there‚Äôs more to being a Christian than just one political issue. Maybe you should reexamine ur views on putting babies in cages, death penalty, denying access to food and health insurance -things Jesus actually cared about

Biden‚Äôs a devout Catholic, whereas Trump has never been to church service or seen a Bible in person (except the one in the chirch photo op a month ago).

I understand exactly what you‚Äôre saying. You guys turn everything from Trump to Biden. He has dementia? And Trump  can‚Äôt  even pronounce basic words? Says he looks like the Lone Ranger when he wears a mask? Tells people to drink Lysol? Naw you high or smoking FOH
Biden should just be better really because think niggas voting for Kanye crazy ass just because he's black is racist and stupid and I'm offended.
Lol. Amazing the details the Biden slappies leave out.
What is wrong with Biden?
Wow Trump stomped Biden in fundraising. Biden freaked out in an interview. This does not bode well for Basement Biden.
Graham is as useless as Joe Biden
Polls Predicting Biden Will Win In a Walk Are Out of Focus
Wow Biden freaked out in a fit of rage today. Called a reporter a junkie. Scary to think of him with his finger on the nuclear button.
Wow. Biden got destroyed in fund raising! Going down fast.
Where is Bunker Biden? Where is Hunter? Heard they opened an investigation today.
Wow, I heard Biden freaked out again in an interview. What happened? Heard he called the CBS newscaster a junkie? Is he ok?
Nope. You have pulled money out of Michigan where you are so far down you can't see Biden's Corvette's tail lights.
Biden, his in his basement all day. Took one interview. Freaked out. Fit of rage. Called the black interviewer a junky. Do we really want this guy with his finger on the nuclear button?
Wow, Biden freaked out today. Called the person interviewing him a junkie. He is losing it. Dangerous and demented.
The number of lifelong Republicans who are gung-ho on Biden is really a bad sign for the future of this country. If Rick Wilson and Jenn Rubin think it's a good idea, we're probably fucked.
Biden slips the word "invasion" in that... Errr... speech of his.
That's all he has. The two Biden 'scandals" didn't work. Obamagate was just a gate at the Obama's home. The Chinavirus is failing as we talk. The "mail-in" voting hoax will hurt HIS supporters just as much as anyone else.  This is all he has left.  Oh wait, what about UFOs?
Trump just smashed Biden‚Äôs fundraising by 25 million. Biden is such a pathetic joke. Biden‚Äôs going down fast.
At least he‚Äôs out in public. Bitch Biden is Dodging everybody. Just locked in his basement.
Yeah. Voters are more focused and Biden is not as hated as Clinton. Trump had numbers breaking to him in undecided. This time everything points to those rejecting him in greater numbers. I think Kanye is such a joke that he will not get enough to matter in any state.
When Is Biden leaving his Basement? Basement Biden
His impact is going to be light. Biden is different than Clinton.
Virus deaths are falling. Trump is surging in the polls. Biden appears falling in the toilet.
"Kanye West says he's OK taking Black voters away from Joe Biden ‚Äî thus helping Trump's reelection ‚Äî as he launches his wild-card presidential bid."
OK, but Biden's history with law-and-order undermines his credibility on this issue. Someone is going to have to butt heads with police culture to make this work and I don't know if he's the man for it.
Also the outshine him part is not a Biden issue.   He is looking to have someone fill a partnership role like he had with Obama.

Curious if anyone knows of a publicly-available Joe Biden speech corpus? Not interested in tweets just full-length speeches.
It's not an effective term for people who claim to want to unite the left. And there are just socially accepted topics to be a 'wokescold', many of the people who use it will shame people for supporting a 'rapist' if they vote Biden, for instance. Point is lots of people display‚Äî

Anyone who supports Trump, has absolutely no leg to stand on, when discussing Joe Biden‚Äôs inappropriate remarks
Biden will no longer travel to Wisconsin to accept presidential nomination
Biden does it all the time on podcasts. He doesn't ramble nonsensically like Trump, attacking people's civil rights, protecting Confederate traitors who cost our nation hundreds of thousands of lives (sounds familiar),&amp; ignoring the preventable crisis here he caused killing 150k+
Facts are important. Opinions aren't the same as facts. First, Biden's position is NOT to defund the police. He supports giving them more mental health resources. Second, most candidates announce the VP the week of the convention.  So, no, they aren't usually chosen by now.
Also, the one poll I've found shows that West takes *more* votes from Trump than from Biden. And this was before the South Carolina rally disaster and public breakdown. Just one poll, but still noteworthy:
Joe Rogan says Biden appears 'mentally compromised,' making voters 'uncomfortable'  #FoxNews
Addendum to the above post: I also know Stein voters who are gonna vote for Biden. And Kanye West's not gonna change that.
Don‚Äôt believe the polls. I was just polled. When asked was I Voting for Biden or Trump I said Trump. Lady asked was I sure?  I said yes. She hung up. I‚Äôm sure my voice didn‚Äôt count. Polls are not honest.  Vote Yrump 2020
Eh, maybe a few of them. But, again, they weren't gonna vote for Biden. I know a lot of Greens, and none of them are gonna be swayed to vote for West. Particularly after his anti-abortion comments and everything else.
Who's voting for him? Seriously. I understand how margins and precincts work, but what evidence has anyone seen to suggest that West will actually cause these swings? The only people I've seen saying they might vote for West weren't voting for Biden anyway.
Serious question: is there evidence that West will actually make a difference in either Wisconsin or anywhere else? I've seen no data to suggest that he will pull votes from Biden or Trump, and the idea that he will seems like a hugely racist/stupid assumption on the GOP's part.

Biden admits he hasn't taken a cognitive test. In fairness, he probably forgot.
Imagine having to pretend Biden is sane everyday.  It must be exhausting..
We don't need a "contrast of ideas." We are voting for Biden. Yes, even if he shoots somebody on Fifth Avenue.
Biden told a crowd he was running for senate, not president. Last week he called the virus ‚ÄúCOVID 9‚Äù.  But TRUMP is the one showing signs? Is that how it works in your fantasy world?
Trump can take unscripted questions from reporters for two hours. Biden can‚Äôt get through a prepared interview without notes.  But keep lying to yourself. It‚Äôs funny.
Anyone else notice that Kamala Harris gets feeds from the Biden campaign and coordinates with them.
Its not going to change this country very much by voting for Biden, but at least we won't be under an Authoritarian rule government by seeing tRump reelected.
Why would he endorse your candidates when all you do on twitter is call him names and trash him?? Y'all do this all the time. You trash Dems and then expect Biden to bend over backward for you! Don't you see this is why Bernie never got anywhere?

I mean, yeah, it was never going to happen, but I held hope that Biden would be serious about courting busters by choosing someone we could get behind in policy.    Wishful thinking. How great it would be for an M4A candidate to be sitting just behind Biden's fragile heartbeat.

Oh, I don‚Äôt even expect Biden to win Missouri at all. Biden is way more likely to win Texas or Georgia.
If Missouri succeeds in expanding Medicaid, does that mean Joe Biden will win the state come November?
If Missouri votes to expand Medicaid tonight, does that indicate that Joe Biden will win the state come November?
Trump* is trying to rush the Census and shut it down one month early so he can act on the numbers before our next President, Joe Biden, takes office. Don't let yourself not be counted! Go here now:   I just did mine -- took fewer than 5 minutes.
Wow,  Just watched your interview with Dr. Jill Biden. While I am where I am now politically &amp; via policy...I have to say she is such a strong &amp; inspiring lady. No doubt she was grateful for the interview and for your respect &amp; disposition. An important perspective.
Florida still is solid Biden. Let's keep it that way.
Imagine how much time Biden can devote to trying to remember what he‚Äôs trying to get elected for. And how to tie his shoes.
Assume Trump will win. Vote biden. (Is my opinion). :)
I would pay whatever cost to watch Trump, Biden and Jo debate. I don't think either men could hang and it would be fun to watch.
Up until now I strongly believed that Trump would win again, but it almost seems like he is trying to lose right now. I might even vote for Biden vs. Libertarian. The world is upside down!!
Duhh!!! Its obvious you are not going address Donald Epstein Trump escapades. Biden is a Saint compare to orange cow patty.

They literally do not care. At all.  for most they are invested in Biden losing.  (You are going to cry when you lose) (You did not pick Bernie you want to lose etc)  Same as Bernie's campaign celebrating Trumps victory. (see book title below)
Whatever Biden's cognitive capacity, it's higher than that moron we have as President now, who can't even construct a coherent sentence, not now or in 2016. Biden will also hire a competent team, unlike the dregs of humanity occupying most administrative positions now.

Hello? Anybody home?  "Biden campaign agrees to 3 general election debates, slams Trump team for seeking more | Fox News"
A lot of people are in this position.  I read this article today:   My challenge here is that in a 2-party system, not voting (or voting for a 3rd party) is not living in reality.  One of the two will be elected, period.  We're GOING to have one of the two.
A case in point around this conversation is Robert Jeffress saying on Lou Dobbs, "The only evangelicals who are gonna vote for Joe Biden are those who have sold their soul to the devil." That is a direct quote that you can hear in this video.
Wrong. Trump‚Äôs WH failed to point out that it was the criminal Obama/Biden Administration and NATO that turned Libya into a failed state.
"This cancer risks our democracy, even in the middle of a presidential election," she writes. "Any discussion about the election usually focuses on Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, a repeat offense from 2016 (Trump smothers out all other coverage).‚Äù
Okay dumbass let me break this down: Biden was kneeling down to be on eye level with a small child he was speaking to. I realize, having been raised by housekeepers and private school teachers, this is something you have NEVER experienced. It's what humans do.
Joe Biden should make his campaign slogan Make America atleast Kinda Decent Again

The president's response to every question in this interview produces valuable sound bites for the Biden campaign. Every single answer is wild.
I just watched the Axios interview. Your dad needs to shut up. He is ill prepared, lied, and looked senile. He can't debate Biden and expect to come off as anything but a clown.
Explain that? Can you point to anything that even remotely compares the completely incoherent babbling and pathological lying that Trump does to what Biden had done?
Y‚Äôall forgot all the racist legislation he has introduced or supported his entire career. It‚Äôs only convenient for him to not be a racist now... Biden is a joke and will never be the president. He‚Äôs also one of the most corrupt people to ever run for the office.

Every answer will begin with ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a good question and let me tell you why that‚Äôs a good question ‚Äú. Biden will somewhat answer the question and Trump will ramble on incoherently while patting himself on the back. I feel a headache coming on already.
So, Kamala Harris shouldn't be Joe Biden's running mate because she's "too ambitious." What does this mean? Is it that she'll murder Biden after he becomes POTUS so that she can become president? If that's not it, I call bullshit; and, I also call racism and sexism. üò°

Those double digit leads in Rust Belt were never going to last. I'm always worried in this hellscape but Biden not seeing the tightening, yet.   The depressing thing, of course, is that there's even a race to speak of.
Nor was it the only scenario that was played out. For the whole story -
True. Though I think this is more about keeping Biden hidden and away from Trump. The more Joe is not around, the more attractive he seems.
Who cares? As long as Biden is ahead and stays that way.
why would Biden boycott them? The only candidate who‚Äôs threatened that is Trump.
Once Biden gets the economy back on track, he needs to rollback the Trump tax cuts so we can get the deficit spending under control.

C19 has too many uncertainties for the economy. If the election heads Democratic then many policies will not be pro-growth (e.g. Biden‚Äôs promise to raise taxes).
Ending the majority of taxes means cutting programs drastically, and no one will win an election by proposing this.  Letting Biden win will only increase taxes!
Never Biden.  Trump 2020 üá∫üá∏
If Biden wins, (he won't) there would be no right-wing #Resistance.  Deep-down, the right believes that its losses are inevitable. They question it, but move on.  The left believes its losses are illegitimate and betrayal, and that severe punishment of the country is in order.
Gotta a 30 day ban from  for sharing an anti Joe Biden pic. They claimed it was bullying or harassment and won‚Äôt let me dispute it.

No at all he always said August and I'm voting Biden no matter what
My choice would be susan rice as VP and Kamala Harris as AG, but I vote Biden no matter what
You‚Äôre right, when Trump shut down China travel back in Mar., Biden called him a xenophobic- that‚Äôs so true. Because Biden says he would have been harder on China. And Nothing says ‚Äúblack lives matters‚Äù like burning down small black owned business and low income housing.

But it‚Äôs still better than when Obama/Biden left..... and China is responsible for this, not Trump. Ridiculous claims like this is why your losing your base and Trump is gaining momentum. #MAGA
Notice how few individual donors there are to Biden‚Äôs campaign? That‚Äôs because HE WASN‚ÄôT RUNNING ON AUGUST 2, 2019!
Ok. So I read this earlier and it clicked for me. Pelosi AND Biden have been getting Intel. The GOP closed door ceremony for the first time ever (right?), and Biden still not announced a vp. Correct? I'm smelling a coup. And rightfully so.
These people need to be remembered and pay a price once Biden is in office.

Vote Biden. He believed  Obama was surprisingly clean. Now that is the type of no nonsense racial equality leader we need.
Anyone who can't vote for Biden is overwhelmingly partisan and should rethink their approach to life.
I mean this with all due respect, but it‚Äôs always ‚Äúanother time.‚Äù I‚Äôd rather vote my conscience and hope some alternatives finally break through, than vote for the lesser of two evils. I‚Äôm tired of evil. Neither Biden nor Trump cut it for me. Start fixing the system now.

Biden shouldn't waste time refuting anything Trump says, but he should answer questions put to him so people can see them side by side. This is about comport and demeanor.
Wait, didn't Bernie lose the nomination by a larger margin than he lost in 2016? Y'all have exactly zero leverage, and you have negative influence on Biden. But keep masturbating each other. I guess you've gotta do something to feel needed. üòÇ
Gordon Chang: China Prefers 'a Biden Presidency' |   via
That'll be Biden's job
Obama is running a shadow campaigne for the Presidency. He is being drug down by the Democrat clowns in office. He is trying to let the left know he will be running the country if Biden is elected. If he were to succeed we would lose out country.
100% agree. I think the Kamala decision was made because Biden sees himself as the bridge to the future. I remember hearing him speak in the summer of 1987. He is a completely changed man.  He has experienced so much loss. He now things in terms of legacy and his own mortality.
I do not care which candidate Biden picks.
WHY ARE YOU ENDORSING ANYONEüò≥. BIDEN SUPPORTERS ENDORSE WHOEVER HE SELECTS!!!white, black, purple or blue. This election is about taking our country back!!!#wesupportBidensCHOICE!
I give Biden a 20% chance of finishing his term. This vp pick is maybe the most important one ever. They likely will be president before ‚Äò24.
They should have said ‚Äúwe fell for the grift. We are complicit in the current state. We were wrong and we are sorry. We are now trying to elect Biden to help repair some damage.‚Äù These guys love to virtue signal without owning up to anything.
I'll bet money you have no proof that Biden is "indecisive." He has been saying for months that he'll make his announcement in August. Please tell me how that makes him indecisive.
Would you prefer he make an ‚Äúoff the cuff‚Äù pick like Dan Quale or Sarah Palin? Let‚Äôs get real: the VP he chooses will be the front runner for 2024. Biden will only serve one term ( due to age). This pick is not about 2020, it‚Äôs about the country‚Äôs future.
Oh wow! Joe Biden knows a guy who knows a guy who said bad stuff. That's hard hitting stuff. I can see why they pay you the big bucks and you have blown through $750 million to be 15% down in the polls.
Who are you hoping for as Biden's VP pick? I'm hoping Harris or Duckworth.

Nice job Biden staff on the post.  We all know incoherent, feeble minded Joe didn‚Äôt write this.  It not true either.
Vote Biden 2020 or don't.
The only way Biden can correct Trump is if someone is talking in his ear.  Biden can't remember where he is, what race he's running for, or what day it is.
Whoever Joe Biden picks as VP, she will make a excellent choice.
Biden is letting you make a fool of yourself which seems to be going spectacularly. We are ALL Americans and we are kicking your ASS on Nov 3 and taking our country back. Before you insult (weakly) maybe do some research, reading is fundamental. #WeWillVote #LoserInChief
I guess it doesn't matter..Biden's numbers speak for themselves
Trump Warns That 'Jobs Will Disappear' If Biden Is Elected. Jaws Drop.
The decision will be to hide it, insist on mail in ballots to lock todays poll numbers in place combined with "ballot harvesting", &amp; cancel the debates due to covid to prevent America from seeing the real state of Joe Biden
Karen Bass got obliterated as soon as she was mentioned. Gives people bad flashbacks to Ferarro and was a late add to appease the people not in the room.  So that leaves Rice, Harris, or Wild Card  Rice is untested. No campaign experience  Wild Card not a Biden move  100% Harris
cryptomaga nonsense.  you know better about biden's racism than the black people who voted for him right though?
His record? 150,000+ dead  and a Depression level economic contraction. Add to that a Republican party that gave massive tax cuts to the rich but wants to end unemployment payments for regular Americans during Covid. Biden cares about you! Trump does not! #ByeDon2020
I detest Noonan, but she does have a point. I think y'all are making up for it with the commercials, but y'all need to keep helping after Biden gets elected. If you go back to attacking Dems after the election, I will hate you all.
What??? This is some misogynist BS!! Biden needs the loser's permission before he can choose a VP??? What is wrong with you??
I look forward to Lt. Col. Vindman's roll in the Biden Admin. A true American patriot!
Yes! Elect Joe Biden!
Shut up.  Bad subject, to attempt to compare BIDEN to trump.  At least he quickly recognized it and laughed at the gaffe.  He does make gaffes, well known fact His has done it for years.  He hasn't told more than 3000 lies since becoming president and tells lies to coverup.
Give me a good reason to support Biden. Not why his opponent is bad. This is why Biden will lose.
I didn't pick Biden, but I'm ok with him, and whomever he picks for vp. At present I'm not happy with the DNC, but its better than the alternative
Biden is slipping fast. Please keep him in his basement.
I must say with every passing day, I'm getting more and more excited about Joe Biden's platform. Really thankful that he's incorporating progressive ideas from Waren and Sanders campaigns. #ClimateChange #Election2020 #ClimateEmergency
Look, I know you want to push that idea (you‚Äôve responded to some ithers mentioning it).  If Barr even thinks of trying that, I guarantee there will be mass protests in DC. And Biden will not be arrested.
We know Brian Kemp cheated in his win over Stacey Abrams. But I doubt it happens to Biden.
This is not helpful. Bernie did not win the primary. Joe Biden is the nominee and it is Joe Biden‚Äôs choice. Stop stirring the damn pot.

"sugar daddy" Harris will be running the show in 2 years if Biden wins.  That should be fun.
I disagree with your next nominee assumption. We have a primary process. Thinking of Biden‚Äôs VP as the next nominee attaches unnecessary pressure and anxiety to this. He needs to pick someone he is confident in comfortable with. Voters will choose the next presidential nominee.

She‚Äôs not a senator. She is in the House of Representatives. She has been there since 2011 and was my n the state assembly before that. Maybe she could run for senate if Biden picks Harris.

Someone, I know recently suggested that Joe Biden should pick Nina Turner as his running mate. Yes, like you, I laughed. I laughed really hard. For me, it's funny because I could see her accepting the role and in November eventually voting third-party in protest.
Please stop the Politics.  Americans are hurting and politics will cost one side or the other the election in November. I‚Äôve never doubted (until now) that Trump would win. Now I‚Äôm worried that Biden might win because of unemployment being halted.

The conversation about Trump not leaving office after losing the election is stupid. I mean dumb as hell. If it's that difficult to figure out what to do, this country is a dayum illusion. If his own party doesn't go in and escort him out, Biden can get crew together to do it.
He‚Äôs ‚Äúclean‚Äù, so says Biden
Actually it was Bush and the GOP that bailed out WS, banks and AIG. Then handed Obama &amp; Biden a mess that took years to restore and handed a booming economy to trump enjoyed and ran in the ditch. You say you are for limited gov. does that include the secret police gassing 1/2

"Joe Biden is right"  Your autocorrect is apparently off.
That wasn‚Äôt the point. I was replying to the comment about Biden the devout Catholic. That was comical.
Does mean Joe Biden can‚Äôt visit?
...and I should add, WHO IN THE HELL from the Biden team let this out?? Good God son, that was a bad move
God‚Äôs goona be just fine with Joe Biden. He‚Äôs ok with pussy grabbing Trump so what‚Äôs not to like about Biden.
Should we remind him Biden actually attends church.
My new piece - Biden's Post-Pandemic Rx: Massive Government Spending - Biden has no plan to increase private sector jobs. His economic plan is to grow government. Pre-pandemic, we saw what works. It makes no sense to go back to what we know will fail.
Just saying what I would advise Biden to do, if I wanted to maximize his chance to win.  The election is about DJT, yes or no.  If no, then Biden because President, not because he‚Äôs worthy, but because he‚Äôs not Trump.  A bad way to select a President, but pretty much how it is.
If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, you ain‚Äôt a black junkie!
He doesn‚Äôt support infanticide or burning of Bibles but I‚Äôm sure Biden does or whatever they write for him to say.....
I would love for you to Get President Trump to refer to Biden as Sniffin‚Äô Joe.
Doesn‚Äôt matter what Biden does, the election is a referendum on Trump, pure and simple.  If I were advising Biden, I‚Äôd tell him to lay as low as possible.  In 2016 Trump won against the most unpopular candidate in USA, this time its totally about him.
I believe that Trump and Biden should both take identical cognitive tests and agree to have the results published.
During a January 5th Oval Office meeting, Barack Obama and Joe Biden gave Sally Yates and Susan Rice specific orders to investigate Michael Flynn.
What‚Äôs Biden gonna do for me? Raise my taxes. Flood my neighborhood with illegals or criminals. Give us open borders, zero law enforcement, higher unemployment, fuel prices....I could go on....
And the USPS has announced its backing for Biden. This would turn out REAL well.
Joe Biden is too scared to appear at the dinner table past breakfast time. For real. And his handlers are terrified of it.
As you‚Äôre doing?? You‚Äôre bringing up Biden. It doesn‚Äôt matter what president we have, this was handled poorly, and 158,000 Americans who probably had no thoughts of being dead a year ago are now dead. Not sure how much deadlier it can get
ü§£ü§£ Biden is whooping  ass without even trying -He‚Äôs not hiding, he‚Äôs smart opposed to trump never wearing a mask and every time he opens his mouth HE LIES!  Good luck with L‚Äôorange &amp; his deadly buffoonery!
So, this isn‚Äôt the Dem establishment‚Äôs minions putting out feelers to see if they can get Biden out of debating Trump. That‚Äôs great news! Let the debates begin and let‚Äôs have 4 of them. It‚Äôs an important election!
No surprise here. Tactic is to cancel debates or get  expectations so low that Biden need only get through the debate without falling asleep for Dems to claim he outperformed expectations. Suddenly Dems want to scrap presidential debates! Ha!

On the golf cart yesterday on the way to the pool, we saw 2 Biden signs in Nolensville
I believe Trump has the balls but no one under him has the will for fear of uncovering their own crimes. And while I think Barr/Durham probably have enough to indict a boatload of people, including BHO and Biden‚Äîthey will wind up in a wood chipper w/o the full support of the law
The leader of the Communist Party Leader in the US endorses Joe Biden for President. Wants Biden in &amp; ‚Å¶Trump‚Å© out! Best endorsement ‚Å¶ could get.
Trump didn't ask for Duke's support.  Biden literally supported a guy who was the leader of the KKK.  Are you this blind and partisan?
The only way dems win is to keep Biden hidden and only let him read from a teleprompter.  Even then he tends to get lost. A debate would seal a 2nd Term for Trump
It will never happen. Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt have the cognitive capacity to handle the stress of debating without fully exposing the dementia he is suffering through. Personally, I think it is elder abuse what the Dems are doing to him
The KKK is a terrorist organization and should be labeled as such.  You know who loved him some KKK Senators? Joe Biden.  I'm ridin' with Nazi Biden!
The only way Biden debates Trump is if it is in 1hr increments or less, Biden has the questions ahead of time. And it starts no later than 7:30 in the morning b/c his brain is garbage after 9am

My grandmother is more accessible than Biden.  She's buried in Woodlawn Cemetery here in Nashville
No Phillipe (sorry don't know his twitter) Biden's age problem is he can't string a sentence together.  I'm honestly not trying to be a dick...I feel for him...saw it with my dad...but he has dementia. I mean I'm sorry..I don't know what to do but we have to think about that

Agreed, so start the same structure 3 weeks before Election Day. People need not be confused-Biden is in no shape to debate. I was just giving it the benefit of the doubt. It is very likely should Biden win, he will never be inaugurated. VP pick will tell us all we need to knowüò¨

So the can gush about Biden/Harris afterwards.
In a recent poll, over 90% of people voting for Biden are voting for him because they prefer his policies, personality, leadership and largely because HE IS NOT TRUMP!!  That‚Äôs why Democrats AND Republicans are voting for #BidenHarris2020
I'd have more respect for Biden and Harris if they hadn't spent their ENTIRE CAREERS in the public sector. (Correction, Biden spent a single year trying to be a private lawyer. Barely time for a cup of coffee.)
Correct.  Biden is running for VP again and no one told him. Not that he would know the difference.
People are already referring to it as the Harris/Biden Campaign.
Harris, ‚ÄúI believe joe Biden‚Äôs accusers‚Äù odd ü§îü§î, so where is her morality now ???
A vote for Biden is a vote to win our country back
I thought, it was the Harris/Biden ticket. By the way MSM was behaving.
Sorry about that. I like Rice also. I suspect she'll be offered a cabinet-level job in the Biden-Harris administration.
LIES.  The majority of the people are so pumped about Biden/Harris.
There‚Äôs nothing you can say now, except lies bec this is a great ticket.  Oh everyone is waiting for Barr to come out with more lies in October but it won‚Äôt help you.  People are sick of you &amp; your Administration. BIDEN/HARRIS ALL THE WAY
Dan &amp; most of the guys at NRO really seem to be way out there in LaLa land. Biden said whomever became his running mate must be "strong" &amp; "able to be President on day one". That does not sound like a powerless VP to me.
Excuse me. But I'm certain Barack Obama had input on Biden's VP decision. He was a constitutional law teacher too. AND HE WAS HOUNDED BY BIRTHERS. I see absolutely no reason to waste anymore time on anything Eastman says. He just wants to attract attention to himself.
End of a phone call between a 91 yr old black lady &amp; a Biden-Harris phone canvaser. The whole short thread is so heartwarming. We HAVE TO DO THIS!!! BIDEN-HARRIS#
Also, the DNC hasn't accepted Biden as the Leader of the Party Ticket, yet.  I still think, it will be someone pulled up at the last second.  Joe may have to run as Independent yet.

Definitely a DNC pick.  No way, Biden would, if he was in his Right Mind.

Yes and all of stocks would plummet. So pray Biden never wins.
Biden is a Catholic.  However, religion is not a factor in a good candidate.
Candidates do not schedule debates.  The election commissioner does.  Biden has NOT refused any debate.
Do you really think Joe Biden doesn't know that? Joe Biden???
Gentle reminder that one of the last pieces of merchandise the Kamala 2020 campaign created was a shirt highlighting Joe Biden's racist opposition to school busing, a policy which Kamala directly benefited from as a child. And now she's his VP nominee.
This is not the entire statement she made.  Maybe she did believe the first statement.  Then the stories started changing.  This definitely won‚Äôt stop Biden/Harris from being our next President.

Alright y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm not thrilled about Kamala, but here are some of the silver linings:  1) we know from the primary that Kamala is wishy-washy on her stances. So we need to be the loudest voices, pushing #MedicareForAll and #GreenNewDeal. Biden is older, she could become POTUS
Good Lord.  Biden has been on line speaking all the time.  GOP doesn‚Äôt make the debate calls.  Anyone listening to Biden‚Äôs entire speeches (which the GOP is not doing) knows where Biden stands.  Trump never talks policies, just lies &amp; brags on himself.

Why do you support Biden? I don't claim to be a doctor but just watching him on TV makes me wonder if he does have some issues with dementia or something. He said he was running for US Senate, couldn't remember where he was and told people they weren't black if they voted Trump

No I hated Biden talking about China himself, saying they aren't that bad. Plus the statement about healthcare for illegals was a question asked in a Democrat debate where all the candidates supported giving free healthcare to illegals.
Funny conversation between you 2, I think you've got your wires crossed somewhere because from where I'm standing, looks like you both are Biden supporters and don't like President Trump. But your arguing....
Yeah they're already saying Russia is helping him again. I don't see how, most people have already made up their minds who they are voting for, Russia can't vote for us. China and Iran are meddling too but for Biden...
What I commented has been on national news more than once, not something I just made up. What about when Biden said if you don't vote for him you ain't black? Did I make that up too
I'm not even going there on name calling, most liberals call me names daily. As for the bounties that's been gone over several times, not even going to try to tell it again. How many lies had Biden told? Plenty all able to be fact checked too. Politicians lie

Let's not waste time on this. It makes us seem desparate. There is plenty of horrible actions from biden and Harris to focus on.

I can tell this is sarcastic, but for any overly credulous readers: Clinton was arguably more effective than either Bush at getting major conservative reforms passed into law. Biden is very much of the same mold.

Shit, got'em. Maybe this punitive law enforcement model actively perpetuated by both Biden and Harris is a complete failure all around.
I get the sense that a lot of liberals are in for an unpleasant surprise once Biden-Harris are in charge.  Maybe not, though, since the goal seems to be getting Trump out of office and then going back to ignoring politics altogether.
that doesn‚Äôt make sense.  So Biden wouldn‚Äôt be running (for the third time) if Trump wasn‚Äôt in office?   So what was his reason to run in 2008?

Well then Biden gone win lol
Biden has said he would veto M4A. The wing of the Democratic Party that houses Biden and Harris is the wing that attempted to primary all those progressive candidates. They're not on our side.
By that logic, choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate means Biden is for Trump.
It is going to be interesting watching how the press spins up the Biden VP pick after the party dumped her in the primaries.  Get ready for Oprah to jump on board.  #Trump2020
Kristol already making excuses for Biden.  I feel for the guy and the senior abuse he is taking but the Dems have sent him to the stage so all is fair at this point.  Just hard to watch.
Actually it was right last time. It's all percentages.. Flip a coin 10 times, you're going to get 7 Bidens and 3 Trumps. Not that dissimilar from 2016.. Biden is favored, but Trump still has meaningful chance, as nauseating as that sounds..
It surprised me because I thought his handlers would be able to overrule Biden's consistently terrible judgment in this instance. That they were unable to keep him from selecting a cop in the current political climate bodes ill for a Biden presidency.
Those acts are probably much closer to Biden's instincts than anything remotely "progressive."
No true republican would vote for biden ticket. These fake posts are ridiculous
oops...hinting Biden is racist (by hanging out with the wrong ppl and "racist" policies.   yes to banning guns by executive order, yes to getting rid of cash bail, provide full govt healthcare to illegal immigrants, Abolishing private health insurance for citizens. just my take..
Don't let optimism make you a sucker. Biden has been in politics his entire life, and he's been remarkably consistent his entire career. He's not suddenly becoming a progressive in his seventies.   The man just chose a cop as a running mate. Use some sense.
the pandering comes from her saying yes to everything everyone asked her because she thought it would give her votes (i didn't). Yes to banning plastic straws, yes to the greennew deal, yes that biden is a racist and she believes he sexually assaulted women...
Well said, April! You endured a lot from those evil racist people, but with God‚Äôs Grace and Love you made it through! I am ecstatic about Vice President Biden‚Äôs, VP pick! Sen. Kamala Harris is going to be our first black VP, and she will be amazing! We have to make it happen! üôèüèæ
Voting Green puts them closer to the 5% that triggers federal funding, and it tells Dems they are losing voters to the left. A Biden vote is reassurance Dems can keep drifting right.  I don't blame anyone in a swing state for voting Biden, but we're not all hostages.
Biden is a serial liar with fascist inclinations and a solid history writing racist "law and order" legislation. He just picked a cop for a running mate. If you think he's going to make anything "progressive" on his website a priority, you're kidding yourself.
Something tells me that Biden/Harris will not be the ultimate ticket for the dems.
Somehow I believe Biden/Harris will not be the final ticket for the Dems. Are they just placeholders?

Kamala is a cop. Biden-Harris is still better than Trump-Pence, but let's not kid ourselves‚Äîthat these our the choices is a failure of democracy.
It took her that long to figure this out??  That was the whole reason/purpose for choosing a black woman v.p.!  Just another step in their grand scheme - no way Biden will last 1 yr in office if elected.
Does anyone really believe that Biden/Harris will be on the final ticket for the Dems?
I can‚Äôt say that Biden will be different from most national politicians who might be President. He is for the Afforadable Care Act and preserving Social Security. I am too. Generally, he is moderate on most issues and so am I. He respects and supports the military. He is calm! üëç

So is Biden still a racist?? Oh well who cares! Smh , so she is an African American? Hmm India born mother and Jamaican father ? Guess that makes you a black woman married to a white powerful lawyer . How convenient to call yourself any race you want.

She is a yes if you are Trump supporter and are happy to see the Biden campaign spin out of control and crash and burn.
So now that we know Biden‚Äôs VP here‚Äôs what I predict his cabinet might look like. Now I think that a lot of these are wrong, but of the names that popped in my head for each position this was it
Today they‚Äôre all gonna say , what do you think of Biden‚Äôs  pick-dumb question-Don‚Äôt ask it!
If we‚Äôre all being honest with each other,  would‚Äôve probably had a better opportunity than Joe Biden to win the presidential race. At least she knows how to speak and remembers what she‚Äôs talking about!
Biden officially chooses Senator Harris as his running mate. A hypocritical and fake political insider who is responsible for countless unjust black prison convictions. #BidenHarris2020
As large as the dems nominating Biden?
All my Christian talk radio friends, here's that article you were just now frantically beginning to search for:   via
Joe Biden here. Big news: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate. Together, with you, we're going to beat Trump. Add your name to welcome her to the team:  #Kamala
DEMOCRATS: We MUST #MaskUp #VoteEarly #VoteInPerson We need to make sure Biden is leading by a HUGE margin on ELECTION NIGHT. Otherwise, Trump will claim election is rigged. Also can‚Äôt trust mail Because #UspsIsBroken
No matter who Biden chooses, she will have my vote. #HaveHerBack
Joe Biden has picked his running mate. Get ready to be disappointed.
Joe Biden disease
TOP ADVISERS HAVE REVEALED NEXT PRESIDENT PICK TO BIDEN.
Biggest dangears facing Biden is how far Barr, Guiliani McConnell,Graham, trump willing to go!
Rice would make a terrible VP and Harris a terrible AG. Biden and his administration is not what America needs right now. Are we really going to elect the same elites that we just recently removed form office.
For real? Because they said first week of August so I don't really believe their timeline at this point... (Totally voting for Biden/? ticket, just frustrated with all the delays)
I would love to been there when he saw the footage of Biden on the bike. He knows he couldn't possibly do that.
üòÇüòÇ I didn‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt bad.  But he‚Äôs got nothin on Biden üòÇüòÇ
Please, Even the democrats deplore Biden. If he was really ahead we wouldn't be seeing all this Covid,  BLM , and mail in voting BS.
Obviously a gaffe.  But if you push political beliefs aside, Biden is the king of gaffes.  In one day he asked an AA journalist if he did a cocaine test, stuttered when trying to say mental fitness and the said all black people think the same....unlike Hispanics. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I think Biden would be better off without Hillary.
Mayor Pete as VP, or having any important role in Joe Biden‚Äôs cabinet, is possibly the worst timeline.
Mail in ballots are rejected at far higher rates than in person voting (due to voter error). Because of this, ‚Äú... Joe Biden may need to be running ahead of Trump by more than 5 points with people who intend to vote to actually receive more valid votes in the final count.‚Äù
#Democrats need to STOP encouraging over-reliance on absentee voting. Why? In a study from Georgia in 2018, the rejection rate for absentee ballots was as high as 17%. That means Biden would need a significantly higher portion of the vote. #MaskUp #VoteEarly #VoteInPerson
I‚Äôm sure Biden will lead the way on that.   TRUE GUTS and GLORY MAN.         no dis respect of your opinion but this is a once in a lifetime event that had a herd mentality of sickness And healing.   China will have to pay for this and the leader that preaches that wins.
A classic from Conway:  I believe it‚Äôs normal for the president to say ‚ÄúYo Semites‚Äù and ‚ÄúYo Seminites,‚Äù ‚ÄúThigh Land,‚Äù ‚ÄúMinne-a-napolis,‚Äù ‚Äútoe-tally-taria-tism,‚Äù ‚ÄúThomas Jeffers‚Äù and ‚ÄúUlyss-eus S. Grant.‚Äù I believe it‚Äôs Biden who‚Äôs cognitively impaired.
Biden‚Äôs VP pick will not be what you expect or want.
Biden picking Mayor Pete as VP or announcing him as a high ranking cabinet secretary overshadowing a female vp would be pure comedy.
Does Biden even know what he is saying, or for that matter where the Hell he is even at?
Wishing/hoping China's despots care at all abt human rights or climate change or anything we care abt is foolish unless we (and everyone else) is tough with them.  Do you really think Saudi Arabia, Germany (just to name two) will support full sanctions on China? Or Joe Biden?
If you missed my  #ASKZach segment this a.m. the podcast will be posted later  But tune in  now, don't miss  on #ExecutiveOrder #Trump #Biden and   article: "Christianity Will Have Power" article
This old white woman gave more to her campaign than anyone ever. And I cried when she dropped out. I'll probably get to cry again if Biden doesn't select her to be his VP. My heart will be so broken.
Joe (joe's handlers), You do know that this is false, investigated by the Obama/Biden justice department and determined that Michael Brown did in fact attempt to take the officer's pistol before he was killed in a justified shooting? Might need to fact check before tweeting.
It's a good question. I tend to lean conservative. I'd like to think I'm at least somewhat reasonable to the other side. Not sure if that resonates with folks who don Joe Biden facemasks.
Introducing Joe Biden and his running mate: Joe Biden in a wig
Democrat Byrd was openly racist till mid-80s. Democrat Biden supported his anti-desegregation bills in MODERN history. Not 50s, 60s, 70s!  If David Duke apologized would you vote for him as Congressman or President? Seems ‚ÄúKKK Leader‚Äù would be irredeemable like the swastika.
So what‚Äôs your point? Biden is being asked to take it for a reason. And whatever reason President Trump took it.... he passed. TRUMP2020!!
- since Michael Brown tried to grab an officers gun through the car window and punched him repeatedly. Our, Obama and Biden, DOJ ruled as much. -  There. I fixed it for you. üñïüèªü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The Biden campaign needs to hit on this hard, and make it black &amp; white for the American public.  Don't dance around all of the nonsensical terms that most people cannot connect.
Well, that's not Joe Biden, Actor hiding behind mask.
I have seen no evidence that Biden's sporadic and conditional empathy is anything but performative.
"The Department has concluded that Darren Wilson‚Äôs actions do not constitute prosecutable violations under the applicable federal criminal civil rights statute."  "This matter lacks prosecutive merit and should be closed."  Obama/Biden DOJ in 2015
Who will Joe Biden pick as his VP?
Hunter Biden Hit With $450K Tax Lien, Is Resolved Despite ‚ÄòNo Discernible Income,‚Äô Biden Campaign Silent: Report | The Daily Wire
Biden is a more convincing liar. The moderators won't challenge him‚Äîthey didn't during the debate with Bernie‚Äîand Trump doesn't know enough about anything to tell when he's being lied to. I think Biden will come off pretty good.
Even if Biden were a good candidate and had something to promise I can't vote for someone to be leader that's afraid to come out of basement
Yes! Please create new ads on this topic with your typical lightning speed &amp; put on TV - not just Twitter. Biden can‚Äôt afford to allow the perception that Trump has solved this crisis. Americans need to know this is just more of DonTheCon.
Will you explain to me what you think socialism is?  I‚Äôm curious where you draw the line between police, roads, social security, agriculture subsidies, unemployment, veteran benefits, schools, etc. and Biden plans.  Don‚Äôt reference Venezuela after your tv references

Yep. We Gen X‚Äôers rode bikes without helmets , climbed to the tippy tops of trees, rode in the back of station wagons and trucks, were left home alone a lot.....and we are all okay. Biden is fine.
Biden please listen to  She is right! #KamalaHarrisForVP
what do you have to say now that the IC assessment states that your source - Derkach- is part of Russian plot to denigrate Biden? Doesn‚Äôt that make you and  #UsefulIdiots? #RussianRonJohnson #TraitorRonJohnson
I agree with you about Trump vs. Biden, but I would really like to see Trump accept Christ both for his own salvation and because Jesus would lead him towards being a much better president.
The qualifications has to be very low or Biden himself couldn't pass them

Biden is an ‚Äúaesthetic populist‚Äù who only shows up for unions when he needs something from them and is silent when workers need something from him. Don‚Äôt be fooled.
&amp; Dems need to be careful &amp; not wait too long on the IC to make more specific info on Russian threats known or they‚Äôll end up letting traitor  use Russian propaganda to tar #Biden. Must be proactive. #RussianRonJohnson #Wisconsin #RussianRepublicans
Biden hates the black community
This is fantastic viral marketing. Biden, being witty, while exercising, broadcast on state media. Let‚Äôs see Trump on a bike.
Hey Rob is your dad voting for Biden?
That is laughable! Biden has never been tough on any country in exception of Ukraine and their innocent prosecutor who was looking into his do nothing crackhead son!
...Republicans could tell Russia that Russian-controlled media are free to say anything they want, but Republicans aren‚Äôt going to launder their propaganda for them. Instead, they are doing everything in their power to exploit it.‚Äù#RonJohnson #Wisconsin
Trump Campaign Seeks Assurance ‚ÄòBasement‚Äô Biden Will Debate ‚Äòin Person‚Äô
She taking oratory lessons from Biden.
I love this. People forget who the man (Biden) is. They forget where he‚Äôs been and what he‚Äôs been through and the sacrifices he made to show up to work everyday. Research Biden, research Trump. Honestly, I don‚Äôt think EITHER should be president, but YES to what you said.
Just like Biden‚Äôs brain, there‚Äôs no way out.
Trump put Biden in a box.
Biden wants anarchists prosecuted.
These are your Democratic Joe Biden voters are work..Good luck America if you vote for more of this EVIL!
Huh that's funny because nobody can harm Biden's campaign as mush as Biden himself already has
Believe me Putin wants Biden as president of America
yep, the counter will restart on nov 4th if Biden wins or keep going
I'm in a modest neighborhood in Williamson County. I will be putting a Biden sign in my yard. Nobody said anything about my Hillary sign in 2016!
this is not to say Biden is racist. But he thinks Blacks are all the same, need the same things, think the same ways,  have 1 cultural experience. This is why he doesn't know why any wouldn't vote for him. It's why he and Dems are more focused on illegal immigration than citizens
Great writing, Mr Biden‚Äôs Twitter writer whatever your name is! You should make a Joe Biden mask and start giving his speeches for him.
yep. So there's part of the diversity that Biden ignores or doesn't know about. Also she claims to be whatever ethnicity that works for her that day.  She's a con artist
And yet, he assails Biden for implying the black community was a monolith?
If Biden wins domestic terrorists win
The left isn't covering for Biden. It's the centrist Democrats who are trying to brush off his casual racism.
just the statement from Biden that he thinks all Black Americans have a common thought process is preposterous.    But that's the Dem party. Thinking they have the Black vote, they don't need to do anything to further (campaign empty promises) and focus on illegal immigration
You really shouldn't be spending your time defending Biden's racism.
NY Times reporter notes Biden staff 'anxiety' over gaffes, claims Dems 'thrilled' ex-VP off campaign trail  #FoxNews  They‚Äôre gonna keep him in the basement from now on.
It kind of sounds like you're saying Biden was right about Black Americans lacking the diversity found in Latino culture. Which would indicate you're in no position to criticize anyone for staggering ignorance.
Biden just lied and said he didn't say what he said. That's not an apology.
I have never mistakenly said that Black culture in America was not diverse and then had to "clarify" that I did not say that Black culture in America was not diverse. I admit I have an easier time avoiding such mistakes because I'm not an out-of-touch old racist like Biden.
Biden hurt the Bible? Was that one Bible or all of them?  Whoa! Biden hurt God!?! Must be powerful.   No, not the trifecta!?  Against God, Guns and Energy. ü§™
Here‚Äôs a freebie line for Biden. ‚ÄúListen here Jack(pauses)-o'-lantern‚Äùüòé
So wait,  Biden is bad for energy, but when his son worked for an Ukrainian Energy company, that was bad too? #iamconfused
Biden's answer to pretty much everything has been giving the police more power &amp; less accountability. In terms of actual results, he's well to the right of Trump on LE. It's funny watching Trump try to paint the guy who thought Reagan was soft on drug users as a leftist.
That's a nice fantasy. Biden tried to dissuade Obama from even attempting a weak version of the healthcare plan he campaigned on. Biden's already said he would likely veto M4A if it came to his desk as president. The man won't fight for the people. He's for his donors alone.
I disagree. What a politician chooses to address says a lot about their values and what they will do in office. Biden values empty symbolism.Trump assertion that Biden would "hurt the Bible" and "hurt God" shows an astounding lack of understanding of Christian theology as well as a cynical politicalization of it.
You guys can‚Äôt do anything on the up and up can you? You are a side show everyday. Can‚Äôt wait to the peaceful administration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris!!
i don‚Äôt want to be over-paranoid but i kind of don‚Äôt see dems winning unless the cia or something helps them out?! like just a little program to add biden votes here and there, like in iowa? i‚Äôm sure they have the will &amp; the way
Do you not see that Joe Biden is a weak feeble old man that can‚Äôt put one coherent sentence together? He‚Äôs unqualified. You can hate Trump all you want but Biden is unfit mentally and corrupt with his past dealings with China.
Yes, Biden got rich selling influence. You can't be that uninformed...
He got his son millions out of  Ukraine. Trump didn't get his money out of selling influence in office. Joe Biden, don't have a business, where did his money come from. Wake up!!!!! He sold our manufacturing base to China and Mexico.
She‚Äôs horrible. Crooked as the day is long. She left people to die in Benghazi. Nobody wants to see or hear from her. Other than that, she‚Äôs great.   Biden isn‚Äôt going to win the election anyway.
They can‚Äôt! They only believe what they are told. No free thinking! Biden-Kamala will do all that for him!
Show some stats of expert stated facts!? That right, Biden truth over facts! Who‚Äôs truth?!
As long as Biden/Harris are stepping all over our Constitutional rights forcing ALL people to wear masks - suggest they mandate that ALL people must wear underwear - pubic hairs falling out can spread the Virus

He is working for the America people. Joe Biden was in Washington for 40 years, he didn't work for the people. He got Joe and his family rich.
In January, while Trump was dismissing it, Joe Biden said:
I have hope that Joe Biden will restore our democracy as it was before Trump stepped in.
Kamala Harris only speaks knowledge of what she knows that‚Äôs happened between her legs . When uncle Joe Biden miss pronounced her name she was probably on her knees giving him a pump up job . That‚Äôs why sleeping Joe was smiling and said her name wrong.  Great for each other
"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or for Trump, then you ain't black."  -Joe Biden
how are you making this criticism while still promoting and endorsing joe biden. do you hear your hypocrisy?
you were the one tweeting that bernie delegates needed to meet biden &amp; team with *charm* and be friendly, all while the tara reade story was breaking, survivors were ignored, &amp; i was losing my hair b/c bernie endorsed the alleged rapist without hesitation
Old Captain America look a tad too much like Joe Biden.
"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware"
4 Biden signs just on my mostly apolitical street. My neighbor who voted for Trump is as nice as he's ever been. And there's one lonely Trump flag a few streets over.  It's kind of tied itself into knots around the pole. I don't think the owner knows or cares.  A metaphor.
Biden gave the nation hope today, I made a donation to his campaign.
If Biden is elected I will get  ÊÑüË∞¢‰∏ª tattooed on my arm!
Please hold all Biden/Harris complaints until they've won the race. We need people to vote, and constant complaining will cause some to abstain.

No, thank you for admitting Biden has mental issues. Trump had the economy going... Stood up to China, while Biden took money from China. Now, In America we can't get Lysol and  91% alcohol, why, because people like Biden cut deals with the Chi-Cons...
its y‚Äôall talking about kamala harris like her nd biden aint our only choice fa me

Just got off the road, purposely avoided the news the whole drive back. I‚Äôm glad Biden selected  Lets do this!
This election is Trump vs. Biden. There is no 3rd option, there is no ‚Äúneither‚Äù option. Trump or Biden. Take your pick, America.
If Biden wanted to win all he had to do was pick Bernie Sanders as his VP
I am planning on voting / supporting Biden regardless. Kamala is not my first choice but I will get behind her 100%. ‚ù§Ô∏è And, I‚Äôm also very happy for Maya Rudolph too, looks like she‚Äôll have plenty of work for a while. üòÇ

Just hear me out... if Biden announced his VP pick was Ivanka then probably Trump would spontaneously combust. We could elect whomever we want because shark = jumped. This is actually a brilliant plan that you should sit with for a moment.
.  who do you think Biden will pick to finish out the last 3 years and 11 months of his term?
You sister are getting that check. I get it, but you should be ashamed of yourself. Biden need to be under some care of a doctor, not on a campaign trail, or hiding in the basement. Too much stress for this old man. Come on man!
Biden's bike ride the other day must have really hit a sensitive nerve with Trumpsters. I'm seeing a lot of ridicule about it on FB.
And Biden is the one with cognitive issues?
NO WE CAN‚ÄôT GET HIM OUT OF HERE !!!!!! Go Mr. Biden get him out.
What a contrast, Trump facing the fire ‚ÄúDo I seem rattled?‚Äù Biden cowering in his basement.

With regard to Biden on his bycycle. Serous issue. Should he be driving at his age? Did you see him swerving. Every American family must stop reckless incompetent seniors when they have lost it. Time to take his license?
Wow Trump is surging in the polls. Biden you can run, but you can‚Äôt hide. I‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs time to face the music. America can not stomach a coward. Show up or step aside!
My prayer is that Biden wins in such a landslide that all arguments against it are moot.
Tell me this, which ones did Biden help while he‚Äôs been in office for 40 years? I‚Äôll wait.
Not me! Incomprehensible,  even for Joe Biden.
Why isn‚Äôt Joe Biden coming out in public to explain his racist comments. Who knows if he even wrote a retraction tweet. He needs to explain to Chris Wallace if he is being misunderstood. It sounded racist to me.
Joe Biden doesn't even have a plan for his next pudding.
Not Joe Biden being All for One lmaooooo
"Oh Lord, please keep thyself safe from Joe Biden. Word is he's out to hurt you."
Man, you Biden worshippers can‚Äôt form a sentence without mentioning Trump.
I think it is so mean how Biden‚Äôs handlers hide him away in a basement all day. Then they bring him out and try to parade him out like a trick pony and hope he doesn‚Äôt screw up. But he is just not able to even perform for even a few minutes. He obviously is not up to this.
Why has the Democrat establishment dumped Biden on us as our choice for President? Real sick how his handlers hide him in a basement. Then parade him out and hope he doesn‚Äôt screw up. But he is demented and embarrasses himself every time.
When Biden says something racist, it‚Äôs a gaffe.  That‚Äôs just bullshit.
You have to go back to 1973 to find something on Trump yet I can go back two days on something on Biden!

Yesterday Trump teed it up for Joe Biden to talk about his personal faith and what it means to him to be a Christ-follower. He‚Äôs a church-goer and a decent man. Christians devoted to Trump will have to reconcile their support for the most vile, selfish man in US political history
It does if you vote for Biden.
If you vote for Kanye instead of Biden, you are really voting for Trump. Stop playing yourself.
Think what a disaster it would be if Biden picked Ginsburg replacement for the Supreme Court.  Trump has shown he will elect Constitutional respecting justices.
Uh ohhh, Biden‚Äôs looking a little unsteady. Smeared in fundraising.  Called a black journalist a junkie, said all blacks look the same to him. Stuttering and stammering. What are his handlers doing. Keep him in the basement. Please.
Tell us how Trump is a racist and how Biden is not!!
Wow Biden got destroyed in his fundraising this month. He called a black journalist a junkie and said he thinks all blacks look the same to him. You Dems must be proud. Lol
I've decided to get away from it all with a quick trip to Thighland. Promise me you won't let Biden hurt God while I'm away.
Joe Biden is a racist.Because they have records of doing the opposite. Biden's is pretty extensive. So you're either voting for someone who is atrocious or someone who has an atrocious record. Hence electoralism is bs.

with ranked choice there wouldn't have to have been the mass dropping out of other candidates all rallying behind biden; polls had shown sanders support among many of the candidates that dropped for biden. he would have had a larger chance to win
Joe Biden tells me I'm not Black if I dont vote him.  Told me that Latinos are more diverse than me Asked a Black Reporter was he a junkie Has a History of Segragation and hate for the gay community. I assure you Trump is not a racist
Joe Biden tells me I'm not Black if I dont vote him.  Told me that Latinos are more diverse than me Asked a Black Reporter was he a junkie Has a History of Segragation and hate for the gay community. I assure you Trump is not a racist , his policies for Black people say different
News flash  Destroying the USPS is going to hurt YOU more than Biden.
Or, as one former Biden official put it: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he really cares about what a 30-something Pod Save America host thinks about him, and that honestly might be why he‚Äôs the nominee.‚Äù  Lol
Biden also decried the snobby intelligentsia that had taken over the Democratic Party. ‚ÄúIt seems to me you‚Äôve all become heartless technocrats,‚Äù he said.   via
Well to your logic, considering it doesn't matter about the candidates, but the people that vote. Biden will win...that's right! #TheHatefulFascistLeft
I think Biden has severe dementia and only has a few years left. He needs to spend it with Dr. Jill, or his sister because he confused the two. It‚Äôs elder abuse what they are doing. Let the man eat his applesauce in peace!

Disagree.  Listening to Pence talk is worse than Biden.  Biden is a mumbling buffoon.  Pence actively and purposely chooses what he says and it sounds even worse.

the reason it's fine to criticize Biden and Kamala isn't because anybody wants Trump to be president.   it's because the weaker and more beleaguered they are stumbling into the white house, the easier it will be for the Congress to set an agenda, even over Biden's objections

One of the things that scares the hell out of me about Harris is her continued support for busing. The only good thing I can say about Joe Biden is that he at least at one time opposed this atrocious policy.  This is something they both should be asked about.
Picture it: Nov 3, 2020. Biden has just been elected POTUS. Taylor Swift &amp; I sneak into Trump election night HQ and perform the We Are Never Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can‚Äôt Have Nice Things mashup from the Rep Tour. We stream it on TikTok. Invites sent via USPS.

If we flip the Senate Trump will not be able to pass anything. If we do not flip the Senate Biden will not be able to pass anything or get any of his agenda  executed. Congress has more power than the president. Plus they will continue to place biased judges.
Biden can't even formulate a sentence
I mean Biden is not going to make it through the term. How long is he going to be in charge without all his facilities? There will be no stability in the white house till he steps down and then no telling what happens
Been saying this for weeks. He's biding his time and likely will announce some phoney criminal investigation into Biden in October simply to stir additional chaos before the election. Any accusation doesn't have to be true, it simply needs to be announced.

Harris is not for as anything. Look at her record which ever the way the wind blows. She is for Harris. But as she and Biden says first things taxes up 300%, energy jobs gone, jobs that are left given to foreigners, you will have 100 days to give up your guns on and on
Who are they polling?  I talk to dozens of people every day and I never hear anyone say they are for Biden. They all think he has left the building and that's being nice. Today after VP pick everybody is laughing about he sure doesn't want to win. They are having a hoot
She‚Äôll roll that into the Biden campaign.
Having a lot of money is never a problem but there is coming a point in the campaign cycle where each side is going become much more cautious and focused on how they spend. My inclination is that Biden will invest in traditional media + digital while Trump in organizing + digital
You aren‚Äôt an Average American, I refuse to believe that the Average American shares your lack of intelligence. Regardless, Basement Biden is going to get beat like a rent mule come November. Find a sports book and bet on Trump bc that will be the only thing you‚Äôve winning in Nov
"Schools should have never been political" says the President of the nation's largest teachers union while also giving her open support to Joe Biden. Let the kids go back to school, teachers want to teach. COVID stats are being distorted and misconstrued to create panic
Hot take: this is more interesting than your opinion of Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs running mate.
how dare he let kids gaze upon our Gods creation. And don't even pretend like you haven't seen ol' Biden screw up a speech either. You see his mandatory mask speech? the old battleaxe kamala harris backed him up on it, AND THEY WALKED AWAY CUZ THEY WERE TOO SCARED 4 QUESTIONS!!!!
being on this platform full of idiotic people as yourself. and REPUBLICANS FOR BIDEN? How does that make sense, AT ALL?
But Biden did say FDR spoke to the Country on TV during the Great Depression. That was pre dementia

Harris was a champion of women, Blasey-Ford &amp; believe all women. She doggedly went after Kavenaugh when she believed he was a teenage, sexual predator. She is now the champion of Joe Biden. Has she changed her mind or sold her soul for power? Can‚Äôt be both!

It is horrible that birtherism is again an issue. It is horrible that, according to the NYT, the Biden campaign had to consider it w/r/t Senator Duckworth. And it is horrible that too many people are indulging in this racist rhetoric, and too many are willing to not call it out.
Curious, since she's running with Joe Biden, one of whose most endearing qualities was his willingness when young not to prioritize his career at the expense of *his* family.  A good dad and a good mom--what's not to like?
I think I saw you mention this a while ago, but I'd be really interested in seeing a video on how you think Trump will attack Biden from the left during this election cycle. Foreign policy is obvious, but do you think he has the balls to go for UBI?
Joe Biden will never ever ever be President...ever.

To be fair, I think any candidate in Biden‚Äôs shoes would be chosen for the same reason.  Trump is THAT awful.  If it were Bernie, I imagine people would be giving the same reason.
The policy that Trump overturned was enacted by the Obama/Biden admin. I suppose that is the extent of his relevance to the topic. I thought we were speaking of the fact that suburbanites overwhelmingly support the president‚Äôs decision.

I was tested three weeks ago, and no results have been returned yet. I will vote for Biden, who will make sure we have adequate and fast testing.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris made their debut as running mates in Wilmington, Del., offering a vision of recovery from the coronavirus and pressing their case that the president has made things worse at every turn.
trump is not just scared of Biden/Harris, he‚Äôs terrified. Mission accomplished!
Dan is as senile as Biden if he believes that.  She won less than 1% in her own party against a senile old man.  The media will boost her big time but she is a lousy candidate with a bad record.  She does nothing to help their ticket as her few constituents are already on board.
Clearly, Joe Biden doesn't have money in the stock market... the economy seems pretty good from where I am sitting!
You‚Äôll be chipped under Biden. Taxes will go up while his pockets gets lined. üë∫üëπüëø

They're not gonna go you know you're right Biden is very flawed so I'm gonna vote for Trump. No one looks at Biden or Harris and all their problems and thinks yeah Trump's better unless they're already voting for Trump to begin with.
People need to realize it's ok to criticize presidential candidates from both sides. You don't like Biden or Harris then state why don't be afraid. Trust me your criticism of them is not going to change anyone mind on who to vote for.

Joe Biden just picked the woman who called him a racist who hung out with segregationists, and who said she believed his sexual harassment accusers.
Personally, I have never heard any tv personality or news anchor make a public comment like  made last night on  If anything happens to Biden or Harris they should be charged with a crime of inciting violence.
Fox News‚Äô Chris Wallace: Trump Wishes Biden Had Picked Anyone But Kamala Harris
Trump isn‚Äôt taking away social security.                                                             Biden had 40+ years  to do something, he has done nothing. 8 years as VP, he did nothing.
Love it!  Then Biden counters asking for all of Ivanka‚Äôs/Jared‚Äôs businesses dealings with China, Saudi Arabia, and Russia.   As long as we are looking into the kids, toss in Donnie-boy and Eric‚Äôs  business dealings with any foreign interest since Trump became Pres. Great idea!
SO DOES KAMALA HARRIS STILL BELIEVE JOE BIDEN'S SEXUAL ACCUSERS?
I am onboard the Biden ticket, however, I do not see it fair or honorable that those practicing their faith should be ostracized and not supported equally,  just as the LGBTQ community seeks support. Why should it be a one-way street? Biden/Harris must be tread carefully here.
Felt the same way as I watched the presser alone. Wondering if others were as inspired &amp; as excited about the Biden/Harris ticket. Still depressed at the demonic forces going after them. Praying,  for this win, our return to sanity,  and their protection from the tRump cultüíô
The coalition needs to be large enough and influential enough to be *capable* of forming a militia or turning violent at the very least, but building that coalition will, as a matter of fact, be more intensive under a Trump administration than a Biden administration.
Thank you Joe Biden for remembering Heather
Biden said he would select an African-American woman as his VP. He chose Kamala Harris who is NOT AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN.  Harris is Indian (India) &amp; Jamaican.  Her ancestors were Slave owners according to her Father, a Stanford University Professor.  WTF? LMAO! Biden is a RACIST!
Wow! All that can be done by Joe Biden. He is incredible!

Polls said Hillary would win popular vote by 2 million. They were accurate.   Biden isn't near as hated as Hillary. Sexism is out of the equation.   It'll be alright. And if not- it definitely isn't Kanye's fault.   btw all this motherfucker wants to do is spread positivity &amp;...
Sorry, let‚Äôs elect Biden to rid us of the Trump Covid-19
Trump can speak extemporaneously for two hours straight. Biden needs a teleprompter to say "I'm Joe Biden and I'm running for... you know... the thing..."
That's because Trump and Biden both have Dementia. Boring,,boring. Lol
While we're here, I want to emphasize that the Trump campaign is using a dead man's Twitter account to call Biden's campaign nuts
There must be someone writing Biden‚Äôs tweets for him too, not sure he could type out any kind of thought on his own
Trump supporters are sycophants. Not conservatives. John McCain was a conservative. The Lincoln Project are conservatives. Republicans for Biden are conservatives. Trump is a disgrace, and the GOP will have a massive reckoning to rebuild the party. It's a joke right now. A joke.
Biden‚Äôs America
If he had thrown in he might have gotten the nod. They were just hell-bent on Biden &amp; there was no changing their minds
We seriously can‚Äôt afford this right now. No, we shouldn‚Äôt go easy on Biden and Harris but we also can‚Äôt afford to risk 4 (?) more years of trump.
I have no issue letting the Biden admin camera tap my house to ensure we follow the rules you outline.  I mean, that‚Äôs the only logical way they could make sure we‚Äôre masked at home, right?

Well polls already showed they do. And you‚Äôre being reaaaal linear with the people that‚Äôll vote for trump. You don‚Äôt think a bunch of Yeezy wearing chads will vote Kanye over trump?  Greater chance of that than liberals that were gonna vote for Biden and hate trump.
Friends don‚Äôt get mad at people who are all in for Biden/Harris because someone‚Äôs gonna have to actually try and the moment I mail my ballot in I‚Äôm going into hibernation which is why I‚Äôve been gaining this weight my whole life.
I‚Äôm so pissed that I might actually vote for the first time and it‚Äôs gonna be Biden fuck Biden ya known
You can bet your ass that Butt-plug will be appointed to a significant national security agency if Biden wins. People on here laughed at me last year when I said that he would be a top 3 primary contender. Sure enough, he wins Iowa &amp; New Hampshire. They're forcing the ghey agenda
wondering if rump etal will throw him to the curb since their plot to draw all black voters to him has been thwarted by Biden's evil genius. (joking, but I really feel sorry for Kanye, he's being so used!)
If you think Kamala is a cop, or Trump is a moron, or Joe Biden is a ham sandwich.. what do you care? You‚Äôre not voting anyway. Why so passionate? This is not a rhetorical question.
I really don‚Äôt like Biden, and I think Harris was a terrible choice. And yet he‚Äôs roughly 150x better choice than the alternative. Voted for Bush, McCain, Romney. ‚Äò16 I voted 3rd party, but I have to vote for Biden this year. Trump isn‚Äôt acceptable. #LincolnVoter
I walked in to the kitchen to see Krista crying and I was like, ‚ÄúOh no, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù  She was listening to the Biden and Harris and had the same thoughts you had.

24 Hours After Biden Picks Harris For VP, Her 10 Dirty Secrets Come Falling Out Of The Closet
Haha!Biden cannot string three words together &amp; you claim that Trump is desperate?DEMS REALLY ARE CLUELESS!Trump has made his goals for this Country open, transparent...and UNCHANGED... SINCE DAY ONE! He's the ONLY PRESIDENT to keep his word. The only ones CLUELESS are the DEMS.
Maybe you listening to everything he says is the problem. I dont listen to everything Joe biden says, but he's still getting my vote in November ‚ù§
In one way it is funny because it highlights that Biden IS ACTUALLY a dope. On the other hand, most of us know about what Biden Really is and That Is certainly NOT FUNNY.
I think that was a Biden ad
wait if biden actually wins how much will my signed book from a few years ago be worth
From what I understand, there‚Äôs still an infrastructure of Bernie support that is still trying to get some concessions from the DNC and Biden‚Äôs campaign, which has had some mild effects/victories so far. Make of that what you will, but ‚Äúdried up‚Äù is not the term I would use here.
And Malcolm X " was " for segregation until he ( like Biden ) and many others had a change of Heart..you don't throw away a human being because they made mistakes in the past,it's what's in their heart NOW that matters.
Clearly the #1 priority for Biden/Harris is gun control when Shannon Watts is blowing up on twitter every 5 minutes about it.
Real talk, if Warren had endorsed Bernie from the jump instead of running, I think Biden still wins the primary. Flip it to a Warren run endorsed by Bernie, though, and it would have crushed both the primary and general.
WTF is this? Haha, so his argument is no one is following Biden and that Biden is fit enough to handle a handcart even though he thinks Biden is weak and falling apart?  We currently have a toddler for president..
Im voting Biden in 2020 and AOC in 2024.

Surely this was going to be the strategy regardless of who was chosen because this ‚Äúradical‚Äù and ‚Äúextreme left‚Äù business is hilarious and easily disproven by the many far left people who are disappointed that Biden stayed stuck in the center with a law-and-order dem.

I can see his concern. Dogs hate trump. They will be voting for biden.
This is right! Grow up and vote Biden Harris! Anything less. Anything is a vote for the current, corrupt regime.
I thought the left were so excited about the Harris pick that they were peeing themselves.   via
He's also stupid. His ploy to have Kanye steal black votes from Biden will only end up taking away the 2% of the black voters who planned to vote for Trump.

You should look back at everything you've said on tv that weve seen out here an see why people dont  understand. You were against so much, and everything biden stood for. Weve all seen it heard it.  Enjoy it will be short lived. You cant erase our minds of all weve seen/heard.

Joe Biden‚Äôs sole vote for his VP was rigged against Stacey Abrams.
Ok, parting shot: *Neither Biden nor Harris actually opposes M4A; they just think (rightly or wrongly) supporting it out loud would lose them the general. There‚Äôs is no way in hell that, if a single payer bill actually passed through Congress, Biden would veto it*.

Yet you support a man who has been in government 40 years and has accomplished nothing but enriching his family. Biden is a life long racist. I called out dems and rhinos. Those are the people who are doing nothing but pandering to keep their jobs.
I don't think it's necessarily because he is black. I think Jared Kushner wants to 'use' Kanye due to his high profile as a rapper and "personality", plus snag his uncommitted followers-particularly young people that think Biden/Harris are centrist.
Except that Biden is clearly not well. They're running her under his name. If he wins, he won't last long before his health means she takes over.
What about Biden today, or is that ok

Holding two conflicting truths in our heads is the only solution here.   We owe Biden no fealty.   Criticize them both until neither‚Äôs in office. Nobody‚Äôs immune, I don‚Äôt care who the alternative is, people are smart enough to hold both ideas simultaneously.
Everytime Trump or Biden fart theres a camera in their old asses to capture it. They dont need your money to get the word out. People cant pay rent, afford Drs and unemployed is at a record high. How tone deaf to brag about donated money for personal gain in a time like this is.

Joe Biden and Trump are both Old as the hills.  I think both of them will likely die of old age in the next 5 years.  They are definitely setting Harris up for the Presidency.  If Trump wins (GOd Forbid) It will be Pence by the end of the second term.  We need younger candidates.

Good. F‚Äôing. Grief. üôÑ  But Joe Biden. But Kamala Harris. ü§î  Gaslighting. Racist Dog Whistles. If you ever grew up poor or low income, Trump is telling suburban America that you‚Äôre violent and unsafe. That was intentional. Property value matters. Our humanity matters more.
So let‚Äôs not count the fact that before COVID:   Black unemployment was lower than its ever been Trump freed countless black people from prison with executive orders locked up for previous offenses that are no longer violations of the law  But he‚Äôs more racis than Biden?
üëèI think this whole story about her relationship with Beau Biden is fabricated ruse so they both have an excuse to constantly remind voters about Joe Biden's sorrow.
LIVE NOW: President Trump Holds Press Briefing Following Biden, Harris Remarks -
As a Sanders delegate. I am proud to nominate U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. My appreciation to his team and the TN Democratic Party for the opportunity to be on the platform committee and be part of  TNDP DNC Delegation. I look forward to supporting and voting for VP Biden in Nov
I'm Joe Biden, we broke a record in online sales, I mean donations.  We doubled it as a matter of FACT and we know why, fade to Kamela.  Donate 5 dollars, 10 dollars, 20 dolla ho.  Whatever you can spare in THE worst economic times in America WE care.  Is a BIG line of Horse Shit
This is true, and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with voting as harm reduction, BUT I also don‚Äôt think anyone should be surprised that the left isn‚Äôt enthusiastic about a centrist candidate, and we should demand Biden move left instead of everyone else moving right.
leads you straight to joe Biden‚Äôs website??? How do you make this up.
To your point, Biden said at the beginning of his speech that all the women being considered were suited to be ‚ÄúPresident.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure if that was an error or not.
Was absolutely amazing to see them together! Love Joe Biden/Kamala Harris!  She's a shark! Poor old Mike Pence won't know what hit him! Trump still can't get off the commode üòÇüòÇ #BidenHarris2020Landslide

Fox News‚Äô Chris Wallace: Trump Wishes Biden Had Picked Anyone But Kamala Harris #SmartNews
I just watched former VP Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris give their first speeches together. They need to mesh the two messages together a little better, but Trump should be very worried.   #DumpTrump
Let‚Äôs go all of us so called progressives we need to do better. If you don‚Äôt understand how important it is to elect Biden at this point in time. Don‚Äôt call yourself a progressive.
I stood, clapped and cheered.  I felt the sound of millions surrounding Biden/Harris and cheering for their vision of our nation!
HARRIS: "Trump is the reason millions of Americans are now unemployed. He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
Yep. Biden-Harris keeps the racist, unjust, corporation-friendly status quo exactly as it is, which has been the DNC‚Äôs only goal since before 2016.
How could anyone vote for Biden &amp; Kamala? #HeelsUpHarris
Everytime I look at Biden and Harris, I see a BIG arrow pointing straight to her! Biden is not strong enough to pull off the Presidency
After watching President Trump‚Äôs press briefings in 2020 I have become so weary of listening to the lies. Watching Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak hopeful coherent sentences was moving.   #BidenHarris2020
Wow! Did you hear Biden and Harris this afternoon! So refreshing to hear normalcy spoken once again instead of someone who constantly has to berate everyone and everything. I can't wait to hear the twitter storm brewing in the WH this very second!
JOE BIDEN: "Trump is on track to leave office with the worst jobs record of any American president in modern history."
Both Kamala and Biden nailed their speeches. So so good. #BidenHarris2020
Seeing big news articles about the Twitter hate for Harris is a big problem... I have my feelings but I truly believe a tweet against Biden/Harris is a tweet for Trump especially when we need the on the fence R‚Äôs this time
Anyone who believes Biden / Harris want to abort babies at 9 months is sick.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ very bad pick for Biden! She does nothing to draw in more voters. Republicans are very happy over his pick! #Trump2020 #KAG2020 #BestPresidentEverCan‚Äôt wait for Trump admin to make an ‚Äúerror in judgement‚Äù getting a FISA warrant on someone in the Biden campaign

The police reports for Joe Biden‚Äôs 1st wife‚Äôs deadly accident were ‚Äúlost‚Äù...yeah right
Now do Joe Biden who couldn‚Äôt pronounce it right either
Help or hurt. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Biden/Harris is getting run in November
She‚Äôs horrible....so glad Biden picker her
But why not Joe Biden?
Love looking at the replies. She dropped out of the race because no one liked her and her poll numbers sucked but now she‚Äôs a great pick. Lmao! Biden/Harris will get destroyed in November and I believe most of y‚Äôall know that. Have a nice day!
This is why we have to suck it up and vote for Biden.
Look at who made the decision. We all know it wasn‚Äôt Biden
If and when Biden decides to step aside....good grief they are already talking about it
Hillarys campaign was rigged for her, does anyone really think the D campaign wasn‚Äôt rigged this time? Joe Biden? Seriously? And now Kamala who didn‚Äôt go over well the base?
Biden‚Äôs got California in the bag now.
God has a sense of humor....that‚Äôs why he helped Biden pick Kamala Cop #DefundThePolice
Obviously you haven‚Äôt been paying attention. Liberals figured out that Bernie couldn‚Äôt get elected nationally so they kept his agenda and moved Biden in his place because Biden has no idea where he‚Äôs at and what he stands for.

How did Biden get to be top on DNC ticket Geez
CNN supported Hillary in 2016 and they are supporting Biden in 2020 and they are shameless in how they do it

I can‚Äôt imagine young blacks or young people in general could be excited about Biden. Bernie or Yang? Yes. Biden? Hard noI am so hopeful in you and Joe Biden to get us out of this mess and civil liberties to be equal. Please please do the right thing!
Both of those are lies. Trump has a presser everyday this week. Last time Biden answered questions he had a list of friendly reporters to call on. This isn't my opinion. All news networks are complaining Biden won't take questions. Not a good look.
Never is, apparently. Why are they so scared to let Biden talk? Trump takes 100 questions a day.
So what are Biden and Harris doing in refusing to take ANY questions at all? Name 1 thing that Biden has done in 48 years that benefited the USA
Eric Trump says Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP doesn‚Äôt worry Trump campaign
Shit, it's showing Based Biden. After the riots, bring back Based Biden. I agree, but I don't think hypocrisy changes votes.
I was watchin the mornin news and they was talkin about a nation wide mandate that Biden agrees with and Trump dont. Trump said he wants the american people to do the right thing not be told to do something. So tell me who really wants to control us.
What a stupid bunt. She knew this was bullschit but still slandered a good man. But she is unimportant. Biden needs to be the focus of the GOP
The 1% which you and your GOP friends keep handing money to may see their taxes go up. Biden/Harris will work for the middle/working people
Maybe you can get Biden to pronounce it right too!!!
It will be a cold day in hell before I even vote for Biden or Harris
Let me be very clear though. Biden and Harris don‚Äôt care about the average citizen, but the do care greatly about their wealthy donors. The amount of pressure even bigger amounts of unrest will press on them from those donors losing money is why they will act. It takes a nation.
Are you serious? 160,000+ dead. The economy tanked. People can‚Äôt pay their rent. People are going hungry. This is trumps doing. He‚Äôs the potus, not Biden.
Trump is Voldemort and Biden is Harry ü•∫ü§ìüò§
Second stimulus check: Where Biden, Harris stand on COVID payment proposals
Presumptive Democratic nominees Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris were together for the first time on Wednesday since Biden announced Harris as his running mate. Sen. Harris said at the press event in Wilmington, Delaware that she is ready to get to work.
And therein lies the difference.... Trump has done things TO this country. Biden will do things FOR this country.
I had finally gotten up above 600 thanks to #NoComradesUnder1k but my anti-Biden posts may have been responsible for the sudden drop back down. Sucks for them, I'm a catch!
If the Dems drop Biden and run Harris, they will lose all the Bernie votes. They will either not vote or vote 3rd Party
A victim came forward and the account was corroborated. This is a non-partisan standard that would include both Shahid Buttar and Biden.
Second stimulus check: Where Biden, Harris stand on COVID payment proposals
We need a new political party. Not before we elect Biden, but immediately after. We need protests againt the establishment view. We need those in the Democratic Party who reject this viewpoint to reject the party itself, and form a new, revolutionary party together. Before 2024.
Biden needs better social media writers. This is just very weak and shows no imagination or purpose. Why even tweet if this is the vanallis sauce you bring?
WATCH LIVE: Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
I guess you people are pretty much resigned that Biden will be too senile to complete his term. I agree
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
President Trump was asked about Joe Biden's Vice Presidential pick, Sen. Kamala Harris at Tuesday evening's coronavirus press briefing.
YEP!  Biden fate if has the spine to debate Trump this will be Bidens outcome:
So you're blaming this on Trump?? That's fucking crazy!! China unleashed a virus on the world! Then withheld information about it from the start!.. Trump did the China travel ban on January 30.. Pelosi, Schumer, Biden all bashed him for doing the ban.. Thank God he did!!
Hey, she was chosen only because she was a Black woman. With her, Biden was able to mark all the check boxes and satisfy his base. Her job now is to emphasize her race and gender, mute the conversation and label anyone who criticizes her as racist. Anything but talk the issues
Excuse me!  did report this, it was on Fox and Friends First. I saw this around the 4am show.   does report these issues, you might not have seen it, plus the news of the day is Biden and Harris and that gets more attention
Kamala Harris: Who is Joe Biden's running mate?
Well she certainly satisfied the genitalia and complexion requirements. Other than Trump couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better pick. Maybe Biden in his diminished mental capacity DID actually make this call
I'm so happy. Thank you Joe Biden for picking  ! Love you both!
I guess I‚Äôm suburban but I‚Äôm no housewife. I‚Äôll be voting Biden.
I don't think attacking the Dem ticket will get us where we need to be on police reform and justice. Biden and Harris will make informed decisions on making the needed changes with input from their left. She did her job as Prosecutor now she has a new job.
I was already voting for Biden/anybody, now I‚Äôm voting harder.
Evidently I am a morally bankrupt person if I vote for Biden, Trump, a third party, or refuse to vote üôÉ
We caught up with local democrats to hear reaction on Joe Biden's decision to pick Kamala Harris as his Vice Presidential candidate.      Read more:
So, your answer is what then, leave trump in the WH for 4 more years? Because that‚Äôs the choice, Biden or trump.
Just a reminder that Kamala essentially called Joe Biden a segregationist
It took the president roughly five minutes to refer to Kamala Harris as ‚Äúnasty‚Äù and Biden as ‚Äúslow,‚Äù but yes of course the man with the rhetoric of a middle school bully has our best interest at heart
Biden is demented so the woman who couldn‚Äôt get the nomination and dropped out will be running the country! NO Thanks!!
1 month after inauguration Biden Chapter 25 out, illegitimate Harris taps Susan Rice as VP. We could be screwed!
Hey she was all over Kavanaugh with no evidence but now defends Biden despite credible evidence.
why would you give free airtime for an anti-Biden/Harris ad? We don‚Äôt tune into  to see this propaganda.
Making fun of Joe Biden when you support Trump is like making fun of people smoking weed when you do meth.
Biden is really about to get that ‚ú®W‚ú® after announcing Kamala Harris as his running mate
Me too. JOE BIDEN/KAMALA HARRIS! THAT'S HOW AMERICA IS GREAT AGAIN. WE REGAIN AMERICA'S SOUL! VOTE!
This is from the same people that have been calling Biden ‚Äúradical left‚Äù for months. *Biden*
Biden and Harris have what it takes to bring us all back from the brink. To fully prosecute Donald Trump's corruption and to restore America and her name around the world. #BidenHarris2020 Hop on or get run over.
I‚Äôm biased. I wanted  for President. And I am thrilled with  choice. Whether you are happy or not, Biden/Harris is so much better than what we have now.
"I think Joe Biden was blessed by a primary field of very qualified women" -Claire McCaskill, NPR  FUCK YOU,  and your awful sexism. Those women weren't running FOR HIM, they were running because they were and are far more qualified than Joe fucking Biden ever will be.

Do you think that Kamala Harris will be a good fit for Joe Biden as his VP?

Whoever he picks will likely be our next president after VP Biden. My Choice would be Senator Harris.
I wonder who is really tweeting for Biden.  He‚Äôs too busy listening to his record player....
Okay but why is no one talking about how Joe Biden‚Äòs middle name is ‚ÄúRobinette‚Äù
I fear we are going to have many days past November 3 before we know anything and trump will litigate it to death if Biden wins.
Sexual ‚Äúassault‚Äù? Only one of these even qualifies as such, and her story isn‚Äôt believable.
3 of my sons are in that age group. They all registered and are voting Biden in November.

Once Joe Biden takes office and his cabinet is approved by Congress. Yes
Okay so are you with the Trump show or will you be covering the Biden show?
Na I like my 2 amendment more amd I don‚Äôt like Pedophiles Like Joe Biden so what are you all and I don‚Äôt  Support blm because you black friends said not too so ya
the sanders campaign didn't fail because the Establishment‚Ñ¢Ô∏è can never be beaten, but because Obama Nostalgia was a powerful weapon. they used the last of it to push Biden over the line. and that sucks right now, but the future is bright.
Not really,  since Biden won't win in November.
Or a huge increase in Biden‚Äôs first term.  Can‚Äôt hardly wait! üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞
I‚Äôm OK with Trump‚Äôs actions because it highlights the fecklessness of the GOP Senate and sets a nice precedent for President Joe Biden to do whatever he damn well pleases in 2021.  Not to mention the precedent that Trump‚Äôs actions set for a future President AOC.
Maybe Biden could play that game... but not as good as this cat.
Baby Brain Dem: ‚ÄúWe need Biden, he‚Äôs a moderate who can‚Äôt get called a socialist and be dismissed by Republicans! Bernie is too radical!‚Äù  Republicans:

Same for  &amp;  they are working with  to spread Russian disinformation to discredit Joe Biden. The have been told by Intelligence it is in fact Russian disinformation they are spreading at Senate hearings.
Joe Biden would likely agree with you although his losses are hard to imagine.
I find it absurd he thinks by pushing Kanye to run, he‚Äôll take away votes from Biden.

You're gonna vote for Basement Biden????? LOL...
Thanks for sharing. I am happy to see I am already following most of them. An analyst on The Rising mentioned all Blacks are monolithic and will all vote for Joe Biden. It just pissed me the hell off. I know this isn't true. The dude seems like a privileged ahole.
The campaign hasn‚Äôt started in earnest, yet, which should happen after the Dem nominating convention. Even without this, Trump is only 3 points (Rasmussen) behind Biden. Republicans have all the issues. The Dems have no issues that can‚Äôt be easily campaigned against. Trump wins!

In case you were unaware, the God of all creation can not be hurt by Joe Biden. The Gospel however is severely damaged by deranged people, like Trump, who represent everything that the Kingdom of God is against. Our God‚Äôs kingdom is one of peace and love. Trump‚Äôs god is money.
If Joe Biden could hurt the bible I might actually vote for him.
Hey, Biden isn‚Äôt the Left! He‚Äôs a centrist, corportate lacky. The DNC is no longer left. They are centrist.
Biden could pick dog shit for his running mate and I would vote for him and his dog shit with a smile on my face. Anyone pulling this garbage about not voting for him because of his vp pick just wants to vote for trump but needs a reason to make themselves feel better about it.
Thesis: Trump supporters don't actually watch videos or listen to audio of Trump speaking. Evidence: They think Biden is in worse cognitive shape than their guy.
Biden picks Harris as Vp. If he wins his cabinet will use 25th Amendment to remove him. Harris becomes President and taps Susan Rice as new VP!
I know it seems like an outdated concept but what about patriotism, putting our country over Party  ? If Biden is not elected, our democracy will not survive.

Biden is just as racist as trump if not more

I totally support Biden/Harris. We must continue to fight the good fight.
It‚Äôs hilarious to see the right try and attack Biden or Kamala when trump has done everything they are saying but 10 times worse üòÇ electing trump has given the reps no ground to stand on. you‚Äôre all hypocrits idk how much more I can watch. Bout time to check out for the election
Joe biden? You reading this?
What‚Äôs real crazy about all this is that I bet some of the people Trump has pardoned for non-violent drug offenses were in prison as a result of Joe Biden‚Äôs crime bill.
I can‚Äôt vote for either of them. I‚Äôm going to sit this presidential election out again. Did the same thing last time. I damn sure ain‚Äôt voting for the DNC ticket. Between her and the Biden bill, I bet 500,000 people have gone to jail for non violent Crimes.
chastised  for being racist, but now intends to serve as his VP? Why? Because she won‚Äôt actually have to serve with him. Biden finally confessed that he was too old to serve as President, and Harris would take the reigns in 2021.  #TrumpPence2020 #WalkAway
I'm most definitely betting with trump over Biden and that weak ass Vp selection

Joe Biden, in 2020 amidst constant BLM protests, has chosen a cop as his running mate.   Y‚Äôall ready to admit I was right about him yet?
is Biden‚Äôs choice for vice president!  #VoteBlue #Election2020
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate
To be fair, I think it was the best choice for Biden because she was surprisingly well-liked. However,  took her DOWN in the debates; pointing out her hypocrisy and her "establishment" agenda. Independent Conservatives aren't scared. She's just another problem IMO.
Thank You, President Biden.
Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate
Biden Harris 2020 is finally real
Considering having Trump these last 3+years Biden would have to nuke the planet to be any worse
Hard to win an election when your party defects to the other side. Trump "does well" with GOP because the sane ones all ran for the hills when his corrupt, incompetent, racist ass came along.  But congrats being down 10 points and Biden over 50%: a good poll for Trump. Lmao.
Trump has pretty much never led a national poll in 2 election cycles. Even if he's "only" down 7, that's at least a Biden win and likely an ass whoopin. Obama beat McCain by 7 points and that translated to a 365 to 173 victory.
I don‚Äôt know how she can say that the President has done a lot to bring the country together when every time I listen to him speak I feel as if he is attacking me and anyone who thinks like me. He has never made me fill as if he represented me. #Biden 2020
OMG!! This is serious folks!! What will Hidin Joe Biden sniff?????
Lmao fear mongering to the max
Bad news.. Harris Twitter unfollowed Biden account today.... uh oh... gonna be  Whitmer
Lmao idc who wins Biden and trump? Lmao I‚Äôm leaving this dystopia and denouncing my citizenship
Right about now i think I'd vote for Joe biden if he claimed to be the imperial poobah and changed into bush 43
This country is not going to be reformed. This is the best we can do. Once covid is better I‚Äôm leaving the US no matter who wins...hell or high water I am out of this shithole but go on and vote for Biden lmao idiot
Is Tulsi gonna be Biden vp?
Biden is a devil disguised as a catholic to tarnish my religion
In this election, voting for Biden means voting for the Constitution. Not voting for Biden is voting for Russia.

New York‚Äôs in shambles thanks to COVID &amp; also Democrats who can‚Äôt make moves under pressure. The rich are moving out quickly making my favorite city on earth possibly return to the horrors of the 70s &amp; 80s. Democrats are destroying cities &amp; I pray Biden‚Äôs not elected.
F U biden
Jill Biden is actually running for president and abusing her husband.
Do you like the fires we are currently fighting? Coronavirus, unemployment, can‚Äôt trace because we have the highest infection and our death rate is over 162,000. U talking about fires &amp; what Biden was involved in, excuse me I am in 20/20 &amp; I am concerned with now, not than
I rely on no politician to map my road. Trump is bad for Americans and Biden right now is our only hope against falling into a Dictatorship
Biden loves China, Trump loves India. TRUMP 2020
Does this mean anything to you? Biden Twitter since 2007, trump 2009. Followers: Biden 7.9m, Trump 84m. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteRed #RepublicanParty #Democrats #November3rd #Election2020
I listen to many TV stations and also read various internet and newspapers aticles.  Biden has not yet figured out how he will pay for all that he wants to do, assuming that Congress votes for all of his ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù. It seems that you are being duped but listening only to Joe.
Will #KHive disappear forever after Biden picks Whitmer as veep? I hope so. Or they‚Äôll go back to I‚Äôm With Her, Russiagate, Kavanaugh, Peaceful Riots, etc.
I think the Fed and the IRS are on the way out. But if Biden gets in then yes a big bill.
Nah. He won‚Äôt last one day after Biden takes office.
I'm confused, in 2019 Biden hadn't won the nomination. What's going on here?
I guess dumb (Schumer) and dumber (Pelosi) are figuring out their trash the economy and screw people strategy is not going to work! What everyone will get if Biden is elected with these idiots!
Good News, without a second STIMULUS check coming, Biden is a sure IN. You got to love Trump. STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES. Thank God for STUPID. God bless America.
Biden, dip shit!
I think Biden should debate him if he releases his tax returns.
Trump‚Äôs history isn‚Äôt so hot either. And at least with a Biden presidency he will be reeled in when appropriate and then R‚Äôs with pretend to care about conservatism again.
Biden and nancy are devils pretending to be Catholics to tarnish this wonderful religion
You mean Biden has had his VP chosen for him.
It's not Biden, that's for certain
So it‚Äôs Russia that makes Biden look like a bumbling idiot? It‚Äôs Russia that makes him sound like a jack ass? It‚Äôs Russia that gave him a sh-tty 50-year record in Government?  It‚Äôs Russia that makes him say stupid sh-t constantly? C‚Äômon man...
Thanks VP Biden. Looking forward to that day ü•∞
Liberal resisters and democrats are out in the open not wanting Biden to debate using ‚Äútrump corrupt‚Äù as an excuse! That is not a valid excuse. Joe must debate just like everyone else.
Biden won‚Äôt be debating him. Ever.
Yes. I‚Äôll ignore Biden‚Äôs words on taxes because the far left is pulling his agenda into huge tax increase territory. Yes, Congress would obviously have to help!!
On or off the ballot I can't imagine he makes a difference either way. Whatever morons would or will vote for him weren't voting for Biden.
I‚Äôm not defending any terrible shit Biden does/has done. I am not a Trump supporter. Like I said, on the racism meter, both of them register. But one is on a significantly different level of that meter than the other.
I‚Äôll put it this way. If Trump loses, it‚Äôll be a tough day for racism, but not as tough of a day as it should be. Wouldnt call myself a Biden supporter. Not running around waving his flag or putting his sticker on my car, but if I‚Äôm choosing between the two on the racism meter...
So true. That is why Biden was refused communion
Believe it or not, the President said that VP Biden hurt God. How he would know that? This coming from a man who's Church is the Golf Course. He had protesters attacked so he could have a picture standing in front of a church holding up a Bible up side down &amp; backwards
My guy you don‚Äôt have a single opinion that isn‚Äôt exactly the same as Joe Biden, you are a Democrat :p
Biden...  That guy says some stupid shit!
Guess Biden won't win Louisiana now!
On that note, Biden was accused of sexual assault as well but you're not whining about that. Why? Because he's your candidate? Should he provide a DNA sample? Should he disprove the claim? No? Cuz it vanished from the MSM propaganda cycle? Stop being a hypocrite, it's un-becoming
But the D‚Äôs are losing them by the thousands. Especially the younger generations! I‚Äôm mixed black and white. And these no chance I‚Äôm voting Biden, not voting Trump either. But racism no matter how small is a NO GO for me, period!
Not really, the left can‚Äôt stand what he said either. And I follow and know plenty of black leftists. They can‚Äôt stand Biden or what he said. Everyone dismissed all the black people who don‚Äôt vote D. And is there is a handful. It‚Äôs just not true. Yes, the majority vote D.
This isn‚Äôt a game show called ‚Äúguess what Biden meant‚Äù not interested in having to decipher his words after he says them. Use the correct wording in the first place. Should have never brought up AA‚Äôs in the first place. There was no reason to do so. He deserves the backlash! ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
‚ÄúVote for my racist pedo because he has the correct letter next to his name, if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre bad person‚Äù -Trump and Biden fanboys not realizing they‚Äôre the same person
Biden was denied holy communion hence not a good catholic. Yet he claims he is. Biden is corrupt  please do not trust him
When morality is in my favor there‚Äôs no feigning, just fact. And as of May 4th eight women have accused Biden of inappropriate behavior. You‚Äôre voting for a racist predator and then pretending you have any high ground. You don‚Äôt.
First of all, the kids were put in cages under Biden‚Äôs administration. Second, don‚Äôt preach to me about the pandemic, I‚Äôm the one working on it. Third, I care about putting a good candidate in office. You‚Äôre voting for a predator, I‚Äôm voting for a doctor.
I believe Biden to be another establishment Democrat and he's not the solution.  would make a better president, in my opinion
Biden is just another problem. He's not the solution. He's just like Trump except he has a "D" next to his name. He'll just keep the "status quo" of the establishment and his corporate friends. Despite all the empty promises he makes. Even independents know he's full of it.
Independents don't like Trump. However, Biden is NOT the solution. Not even close.
Lol I‚Äôm voting green. I‚Äôm focusing on getting progressives into the house and senate. Fuck Biden
No. Biden ain‚Äôt moving left sorry. I‚Äôm voting green. Also don‚Äôt bother with ‚Äúa vote for green is a vote for trump‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt work here

Biden‚Äôs record is corruption. I don‚Äôt idolize anyone. If you want to be an elitist boot licking fuck. By all means, continue. Don‚Äôt waste everyone else‚Äôs time pretending. Politicians who‚Äôve been building this corrupt system for decades. Are interested in giving up their power!

Joe Biden‚Äôs latest car AD is so tone deaf...hey idiot read the room.It‚Äôs not the crowds Democrats fear. It‚Äôs the debates. They want everyone to vote before Biden is exposed to be mentally debilitated.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden literally just because of this debate.
Obama and the Dems want everyone to vote now, before any debates, when Biden is truly revealed to be badly impaired.   The post office angle is their latest lie. Don‚Äôt buy the BS.
Vote for Biden. You already made a mistake by voting for Trump once. Don't compound it!
Take this statement and put tRump's name in there in place of Biden, change left-wing to right-wing and you have a true statement.
It really says something that Dave, who really isn't even a Biden supporter, has come up with more ideas regarding how to improve voting than all centrist democrats have done combined. He wants you to vote for more progressive candidates as well, but still.
600000 postal workers back Biden

Gullible #Biden Libs: 1)There‚Äôs a BIG difference between mail-in voting &amp; an ABSENTEE ballot (Trump‚Äôs home is in FL). 2) If you think National vote by mail is secure &amp; not pushed for one sole reason: #VoterFraud, then you‚Äôre probably not bright enough to be choosing a leader. üôÑ

No. You‚Äôre a liberal lol leftists who give a shit realize that joe biden isn‚Äôt gonna be pushed left. Especially with Kamala Harris, the authoritarian queen, by his side.
They‚Äôre doing this cause if Biden wins they know he won‚Äôt be in long
I will. I have been trying. It's so important. We can't argue among ourselves. I didn't want Biden, But I will work my ass off for him. Trump has us all divided.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden
The way biden supporters are acting right now, I don‚Äôt see them any differently than I do trump supporters.
She should be on the debate stage with Trump and Biden. üá∫üá∏ Women deserve protection against sexism regardless of political party. üë©‚Äçüíº‚ôÄÔ∏è
Biden expands lead over Trump to double digits: poll
The whole world is waking up. America needs to realize we can do better than trump or Biden, and we need to DEMAND better from our politicians. Not only that, those demands must be followed up with consequences.
Yeah right, Biden &amp; Hunter are under investigation in Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine. All those millions of dollars Hunter made illegally when Obama &amp; Biden we‚Äôre in let Alone putting pefophile island II in Joes bro‚Äôs name.
Joe biden has said out loud multiple times that he wants to cut SS. it‚Äôs not our fault his dementia has progressed to the point he doesn‚Äôt remember saying it.

You know who doesn‚Äôt like black people tho, based off their voting records from the past 40 years? Joe biden.
Joe biden already did more damage. Someone who supports black lives matter should not support the father of mass incarceration and his cop running mate.

Lmfao how do you know? Kamala Harris is an authoritarian from hell. Joe biden has dementia. Who do you think is gonna be calling the shots?
Nice. You raised the bar with Obama Biden but this works well and the "flag" E is growing on me.
If this election is stolen from Biden there won't be any options come 2024.  But, feel free to keep blaming "Democrats" for this debacle.
For Biden ?  Lololol
I think it‚Äôs a mix, I think he genuinely believes Biden is better for working people than trump, but he also knows he will get nothing done in congress if the the dems turn against him.

Hey  informed Americans know that you‚Äôre in the business of lying, and spreading disinformation and propaganda. Do you regret ALL THE LIVES LOST due to your LIES about the COVID scamdemic? Your desperate attempts to put dotard Joe Biden in the WH are pathetic!
They broke the hourly ActBlue record when Biden announced, and once again broke it after she spoke at their event.
I have said for weeks that Biden will not debate the President because he cannot even coherently even talk. His handlers know it &amp; so does Biden's wife. He should not even see the oval office.
Biden cares for people!
They are already laughing at you. Joe Biden winning would allow them to take a break to catch their breath.
No surprise as she gets older she loses her faculties just like KKK-lovin‚Äô Joe Hidin‚Äô Biden. BLM is a Marxist organization and Dolly is too naive to believe anyone born here in America is a spoiled evil communist
I‚Äôm sure Fox can‚Äôt wait to criticize Biden for the same things Trump has done for the last 4 years. I‚Äôm looking forward to the greatest hits like the tan suit scandal and the great mustard debacle.
Vote for Biden. Period.
Because I don‚Äôt disagree? I will say Biden obviously isn‚Äôt a segregationist now, but I don‚Äôt have positive things to say about them. That‚Äôs not what this is about though. This is about the GOP‚Äôs hand being up your ass and using you like a puppet.
Both of my parents were in prison for marijuana charges. (Thanks joe biden)

Why can‚Äôt you be a unifier Mr.Biden?  Smearing the president will help you with leftist, Antifa, BLM and other Democrats but Not for moderate republicans or independents! Stop ‚Äústirring up the pot‚Äù!
Biden will hand this country over to China!
I propose that Biden‚Äôs handlers make sure his basement is well stocked with Depends (maybe 4  years worth), make sure his meals are pur√©ed and his meds get taken.  We‚Äôll check back in for the next 2024 Convention.

Fk you Joe Biden and the Kamal Harris you rode in on

Unlike the Biden approach, your approach is guided by a total disregard for the lives of Americans, and has destroyed the American economy.

Asking me to vote for Biden as if he's genuinely better is ignoring that the system is broken. All Trump has done is set the new tone.  The Democrats are no more willing to help us than the Republicans. They're just okay sitting by and letting the GOP do the heavy lifting.

This is what we get to look forward to in the event that Biden wins - constant lying from the Biden camp !!!
With a straight face, Biden just said President Trump has been coddling terrorists around the world.üßêAfter Biden advised AGAINST taking out Bin Laden, now he‚Äôs ignoring that it was Pres. Trump who had Soleimani &amp; al-Baghdadi killed, the ISIS caliphate eliminated, and far more.
I agree it‚Äôs important to know more about him but he is such a small part of the picture. This is possibly the most important election ever. We don‚Äôt need to lose our focus. Get Biden into office. Hold him accountable and fight like hell for the changes we need.
Did you care about Mrs Kaine? Or Dr Biden? It seems like such a small thing to be concerned abt when the choice is literally our democracy or an authoritarian regime bent on destroying all social safety nets &amp; starting another civil war. I have other things to worry about.
Do you do so mindful of the women that Joe Biden sexually assaulted? ... or do you not believe them now?
Fuck. Joe. Biden.
I know Bernie was paid to go away but it would piss me off to know that Biden was the pick and most likely (if he were to win) have to step down next year and Harris would be the President.  Dang what games the Democrats play!
I‚Äôm no fan of his either, brother. But if my political science and voter math mind is working. I actually think Trump (politically) is much more intelligent than Biden. Trump knows exactly what base he needs to galvanize. Biden‚Äôs hiccups are misspeaks (often his actual thoughts).
It is a sad day in the mockery of Biden‚Äôs candidacy, and now, corrupt, no morals, Kamala Harris.

Then you must dislike Biden...he likes &amp; is a pedophile. That is fact...yet with Pence you spew opinion and no peskyfacts to back up accusations about sexual predators. Can‚Äôt like one &amp; detest the other...that‚Äôs called hypocrisy. You aren‚Äôt that. Just overly bias &amp; a Sheepeople
Biden is going to get the shit kicked out of him.
You only ask for proof if you are defending a belief. Opinions on commitment vary from doctrine to doctrine. Obama and Biden basically ignored any and all faith based organizations. Additionally they ignored race relations. Accomplished nothing.
Can we elect Biden just to get these memes again?
Meanwhile Joe Biden mispronounced the DNC pick for his VP Candidate today the same one who called him a racist but you know Bad Orange Man  said a word. While Senile Joe proves why he stays in the basement. Debates will be a disaster for him.
If Joe Biden is a Catholic, he has no recollection of that information.  #Dementia
RNC Chair McDaniel: Biden-Harris ticket shows radical extremists have seized control of Democratic Party
I‚Äôm looking forward to your meltdown and excuses when Biden wins in November. It‚Äôs a long term commitment seeing your posts but it‚Äôll be worth it.
Joe biden authored the ‚Äútough on crime bill‚Äù  Joe biden supports cutting Medicare/social security (it‚Äôs on video so don‚Äôt deny it)  Joe biden is the reason protestors are being kidnapped currently.
In all seriousness though guys, the people who write Biden‚Äôs tweets completely lied. It is ESSENTIAL that both sides do not lie about the other side. It‚Äôs awful and deceptive and will continue to divide. Stand for truth :)
Biden isn‚Äôt left enough at all. He‚Äôs just as bought and sold by corporate America as anyone else. I don‚Äôt owe him shit.
You‚Äôre complicit in Americans dying from lack of healthcare. Trump outflanks biden on that by a long shot. A HUGE long shot
wow Biden just got caught by some guy named ‚ÄúI care about all chickens.‚Äù How embarrassingüòÇ
THIS JUST IN. I AM A NAZI BECAUSE I EXPECT BETTER FROM A CANDIDTAE THAN JOE BIDEN
They don‚Äôt wanna stop it tho. Your candidate has CONSISTENTLY been for Continuing warfare in the Middle East. He is one of the most guilty people of furthering the prison industrial complex. If you were against those, you wouldn‚Äôt be voting biden period.
You‚Äôre for the continuing of endless war in other countries. You‚Äôre for the continuation of the prison industrial complex. You‚Äôre for the continuing of Americans dying from lack of healthcare. None of that is going to change under joe biden. Absolutely none of it.
Bishop I look up to you, always have and always will. But I have not forgotten her track record. Now I understand that in Nov. we HAVE to vote for someone and although I despise the current administration let‚Äôs not assume Biden and Harris will be our saving grace.
Yet somehow you think I have to vote for joe biden despite him not earning it from me.
I didn't vote for either Hillary or Trump in 2016. I won't make that mistake again. With Harris as VP I am excited to vote for Biden! #VoteBidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide

I was a huge Biden supporter in 1988....it‚Äôs good to be vindicated FINALLY....and Kamala Harris was my first choice this time around, so having the two of them together is just PERFECT!  What a great ticket we have, now let‚Äôs make it happen!
‚ÄúBiden sometimes misspeaks‚Äù.  Seriously, sometimes? NO; His thoughts and words are incoherent, rambling and sometimes gibberish!  Our president took the cognitive test because of progressives pressures!  Lets see your nominee take one; doubt he could pass it!

Calling Joe Biden a creep and posting legitimate photos of him invading the personal space of others is against Facebook's community standards. Perhaps  and members of congress should hold Facebook accountable for their obvious bias
No reason to be insulting (although that‚Äôs typical of the left these days). I‚Äôm well educated about the issues. What, pray tell, do you think Biden will do now that he hasn‚Äôt cared to do over the last 40 years? And do you care about the proven persistent lies from Biden &amp; Kamala?
Nice.... some teenagers read tweets and yours is vulgar!  Be more thoughtful and think before you send tweets. What do you want the American people to do wear masks while hiking, riding bikes like ignorant Joe Biden,what‚Äôs your solution?  We need masks indoor and social distance
And how many questions did Biden/ Harris take today?
I hate Kamala Harris as much as the next person. She‚Äôs performative and she‚Äôs a hypocrite. But what I‚Äôm not about to do is single her out for backing Biden despite attacking him in the primaries. Every rational candidate would do the same. Warren? She did it. Sanders? He did it.
Electing Joe Biden is a step backwards...electing trump is two steps backward. Good luck everybody!
Biden has embraced Cory Booker‚Äôs strategy for ending single-family zoning in the suburbs and creating what you might call ‚Äúlittle downtowns‚Äù in the suburbs.

Exactly the opposite, Joe Biden is a pandering racist!  Did you forget that he called Barack Obama in 2007 in the Democratic debates ‚Äúa clean, ... African American,‚Äù tell me that‚Äôs Not racist? You‚Äôre quite delusional! You give NO evidence of our president being one.
Amee‚Äôs post is literally the same mindset as Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúpoor kids are just as bright as white kids‚Äù comment. It‚Äôs toxic and terrible
Everyone knows Biden is just a placeholder. I would expect within his first month in office he would resign due to health reasons. He is like a house you buy just for the land. Fortunately, he'll be destroyed if he attempts a debate.

People aren‚Äôt voting for Biden peaple are voting for Harris. She stood no chance of winning when she was a candidate. What makes her so special now?
Joe Biden has ran for President since 1984, he has never won the nomination. Not sure he will this time either.
If Biden wins, Trump will not humbly accept defeat. And a large swath of the country will view the election results as fraudulent.   Foreign adversaries, including Russia, will circulate conspiracies of massive voter fraud.   And Trump will undermine Biden and promote it all.
Kellyanne Conway Reacts To Kamala Harris Chosen As Biden's VP
Here‚Äôs your regular reminder that good, upstanding, honest folks will vote for Trump and good, upstanding, honest folks will vote for Biden. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.
When I did this for Biden previously, it was pretty easy.
if Biden is elected, this country will embrace socialism. Do you not think that the statements Biden has made are racist?
I‚Äôm not sure she wouldn‚Äôt support the socialists in her party (Bernie, The Squad, Warren) given the power.  Heck, I‚Äôm not really sure what her convictions are about anything.  She attacked Biden for not supporting busing when she herself didn‚Äôt support the same policy.
Biden picking Harris shows me Biden isn‚Äôt a petty or vindictive person.   I remember Harris taking a big cheap shot at Biden in the debates.
Some are saying Hillary/Obama as V.P. Anyone have other ideas? It's been discovered that pedophile John Podesta, DNC campaign official, played the role of Biden while wargaming possible strategies; refusing to concede, 3 states threatened to leave in protest of Trump's 2nd term.
My Vote Blue No Matter Who mom trusts Biden/Kamala to take defunding the police seriously &amp; yells at me when I call Kamala a cop
Am I correct in thinking if something happens to Biden (worse than his current condition), Kamala would be president and Nancy Pelosi would become VP?!?!  Elon, I am going to need a spot for the Mars trip.
Wait, why do people think it‚Äôs bad that Biden read from notes when selecting Harris? Has Trump really denigrated the office of President so completely that y‚Äôall think preparedness is a weakness? This is Biden‚Äôs biggest move yet as a candidate, I wouldnt want him to just wing it.
To hear Biden quoted by another person is like the ramblings of somebody on a bad LSD trip.
This would be the essence of a Biden administration. It would challenge ideas and result in better solutions. It would also allow more progressives a a seat at the table, preferably in the cabinet.
I‚Äôve wondered this, too. What‚Äôs to be gained for Biden? Trump will obfuscate at best &amp;, more likely, just ramble incoherent nonsense. Moderators won‚Äôt hold him accountable. There‚Äôd be no real ‚Äúdebate‚Äù with Trump, either. Biden should just continue focused ads and stay on message.
I don‚Äôt see Biden or Harris on the ticket come November.

Give Kamala credit for honesty. When she said Biden was a racist who hung out with klansman I believe her. When she laughed abt smoking weed and putting others in chains for it, I believe her.  When she said her time under Willie Brown was why she Rose in politics, I believe her.
I was in the crowd in Knoxville last March and was deciding between your candidacy and that of Kamala Harris. You both withdrew in time for me to cast my vote for Joe Biden. I am proud of you for withdrawing from the VP choices, making Kamala the only logical choice. Perfection.

I‚Äôm upset a COP got chosen. Joe biden just spat in the faces of protestors by choosing her.
That‚Äôs not factual at all. We just care that she is a COP. Does that not get through your head? During the black lives matter movement, Joe Biden chose a cop. That says enough about where he stands
I'm not for Biden nor Kamala, but if we don't get Trump and Pence ass up outta there, it's gonna be straight up chaos... cause ain't nobody bout to keep dealing with these racist POS thinking they can do wtf they want wtf they want.
So I guess she‚Äôs voting for Trump. Per Biden.
Vote, just not for Biden
I can‚Äôt conceive of one thing in Harris‚Äô background that would prevent anti-Trump Republicans from opposing Biden. Did they forget that Trump wouldn‚Äôt help and therefore let more people die of covid in states if the governor there didn‚Äôt praise Trump enough?!

Serious question, what happened to her beliefs of Biden supporting "racist policies"? Does she support those policies she mentioned on order to have the opportunity to be VP?
The left protesting police violence for the last two months and the DNC chooses a cop as the VP pick. Biden &amp; Harris are more focused on winning the Republicans than uniting the Left. And Liberals are too busy siding with them. This county has no Left major party, yet. #VoteDSA

Biden's wife is at his side at every meeting. She is helping Biden remember &amp; think. To me it shows his mind must be failing. Same thing Regan's wife did. They were just more discreet about it.  Biden is trying the same thing. Not as good though. He's no Regan.
Let me guess Biden is your choice lol
the main result of a biden win in 2020 will be delaying the collapse of the country by like 5 years
No believe me I get that. I didn't want Biden. He was dead last on my list...I'm saying at this point, you have those 2 options. Period. Not saying you have to like it, I don't, but what is the point of not looking at the best available option and not voting at all?

finally make lynching a federal crime. Let‚Äôs weigh how Biden/Harris vs. Trump/Pence would handle a drug and crime surge like we experienced well into the 90‚Äôs. You can believe in prison reform and the importance of ‚Äúlaw enforcement‚Äù (i.e. in case of murder, rape, molestation).
The point is RIGHT NOW we have 2 options...Trump and Biden. That's it. Yeah you can vote for neither for...reasons? But try convincing anyone that not voting at all is better than voting for Trump. Not happening.

"... and that will conclude our first presidential debate between Joe Biden and-" "That's it? No smash??" "What?" "God, nintendo is a doomed company. At least give us the sm64 remake!"
Kamala Harris isn‚Äôt a pragmatic moderate, she is however problematic for Joe Biden.I tell you what. I appreciate the civil way you communicate with me. I'm not a Republican or a Democrat. My two biggest issues are as follows:  I'm Anti-Gun (Democratic Lean) I'm Pro-Life (Republican Lean)  I don't trust Trump I don't trust Biden  Debating might sway my vote.
Joe Biden got caught rubbing on kamala Harris and people said that's joe dang.
August 2019: ‚ÄúPoor kids‚Äù just as bright as ‚Äúwhite kids‚Äù¬†-Biden   August 2012: ‚ÄúPut y‚Äôall back in chains‚Äù¬†-Biden  February 2007: Obama is "the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean‚Äù-Biden
You‚Äôre finished Biden. Sorry have your wife read this for you.
The image allegedly posted by Smith consisted of photos of presidential nominee Joe Biden &amp; his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, titled "The New Pad Party," labeling Biden with "pee pads" to mock his age &amp; labeling Harris "knee pads" in an offensive reference to sexual activity.
If they keep talking we can really drain the swamp
Just because she is a woman of color doesn‚Äôt mean she gets a pass! She is a terrible woman who would destroy this Country! You know good and well it is her that is running! Biden will end up ‚Äústepping aside‚Äù as CNN says.
Today you said you would have Congress pass a weapon confiscation Bill and if they didn‚Äôt act quickly enough ‚Äúyou ‚Äú would issue an Executive Order immediately. Whow, Nelly - the VP do squat! Unless you plan to off President Biden first. Sounds you‚Äôre dreaming!
Mr. Biden thanks for the suggestion on the mask. I think I will follow the leadership of my President Trump  !
Unfortunately ignoring a better candidate is even worse. I cannot support a man who is responsible for the state of our nation at the moment. Funny how that describes both Biden and Trump.
I am not a leftist but I am voting third party. The Libertarian candidate is more than capable. I will not support Trump or Biden, who helped create the mess we have. Third party is currently the best choice we have.
Absolute BS. And at the same time Biden doesn‚Äôt even allow questions. Such unfair garbage.
The Obama/Biden administration treated Israel horribly! You funded Iranian terrorists!
Ridiculous! Obama and Biden treated Israel horribly and sided with Iran, the biggest sponsor of terror, sending them pallets of cash in the middle of the night! Biden funded terrorists!

I'm so bummed that Bernie got screwed over. He was my choice. That doesn't mean I'm not gonna suck it up and vote Biden but..... Biden/Harris doesn't make me jump for joy either.
Biden/Harris 2020 swag bought.   Oh man.   Folks in SE Tennessee are going to just love me.
That makes Biden look pretty fit! And while we know that Biden can still ride a bike poor Trump can‚Äôt walk down a ramp...
So I can't criticize Biden or Harris about anything? Ever?
Biden doesn't stand a chance against Trump in the debates.
How about the people that feel Trump and Biden are not worth anything and do not know of 3rd parties?
Warm feeling watching Democrats melting down into globs while all Biden can can say is ‚ÄúComon man‚Äù.
I'll vote for Biden/Harris, just to see Maya Rudolph for the next four years. One of my favorite actresses! #MayaRudolph
Obama-Biden's slogan was "Yes we can!"  I think Biden-Kamala's should be "We can try."
I hate that you feel that way. Biden‚Äôs mental incompetence is a sad situation. It‚Äôs pitiful that he‚Äôs made a laughing stock every time he says anything.
Vp debate will be the only good one. Trump is going to wipe the floor with Biden. They would be better off letting Harris and trump go at it üíØ
I'll vote Biden but geez I'll always be disappointed Bernie got screwed...again.
Trump destroyed Hillary in the debates. He can definitely destroy a racist like Joe Biden.
Her family owned slaves. Her prosecutions of Black males goes right along with Biden‚Äôs 1994 crime bill.
I want my Biden/Harris 2020 bumper sticker immediately.
I‚Äôm not thrilled with Biden‚Äôs VP pick. I think Harris has a troubling record regarding police and justice reform in California. But I‚Äôm willing to listen, and I‚Äôm happy to be proved wrong. Still an easy vote for me.
She went out of her way to prosecute and jail Black men. Fits with Biden‚Äôs 1994 crime bill perfectly.
Biden didn‚Äôt pick anything! His handlers have chosen!
I call BS! All you have to do is look around at all the boat parades and pro-police rallies! Look at all the Trump signs versus Biden signs! They must be planning on doing some heavy cheating with mass mail-in voting! God will not be mocked!
Has anyone seen a Biden sign for president?  I see nothing but trump signs
Robin Williams died in 2014.  Biden was joke then &amp; has been a joke since then.

Really? Biden? So it's cool he can't put together an actual sentence, has a history groping kids and supports a party of historical racism. You see out of touch with reality.
As if Biden already hasn't said enough dumb stuff about black people, let's vote for a man who can't put together a coherent sentence while thinking about sniffing and touching children. Way to support the party of historical racism, the democratic party.
At least Biden can ride a bike while Trump can‚Äôt walk down a ramp...
Do you remember last election when the press said he wouldn't disavow white supremacist, even though he did it almost every interview?   So why won't Biden or Pelosi condemn this behavior? It hurts businesses and people just trying to live their life.
These are people that hate Trump. If Biden is elected, it will only embolden them to do more of this. These people rioted under obama as well, they are anarchist. Democrats keep pandering to them.
They all do it. Look at illan omar, she has paid her new husband 1.6 million. Trump was rich before he became president. He doesn't take a salary, neither does Ivanka and Jared. He can not make business decisions for Trump properties. Biden is not innocent in stocks either.

Exactly what policy of Biden do you support? Abortion until birth? Open borders? Defunding police? Getting rid of fossil fuels? Getting rid of our 2nd Amendment? Free healthcare to illegals at the expense of tax-paying citizens? The promise of higher taxes?
Except Trump can‚Äôt golf while in the White House so I doubt he can stay in there very long and Biden will just waltz right in.
I didn‚Äôt like legislation via executive order under Obama. Don‚Äôt like it under Trump. Won‚Äôt like it under Biden. We have three branches for a reason.

The DNC booed God, they are attacking Christians and churches, and killing babies even after birth! The people who are controlling Biden‚Äôs policies despise God and Israel!
I think Biden should give a similar speech but say that if you re-elect Trump ice cream will be illegal. Trump hates babies. You won‚Äôt be able to ride bikes or watch TV...
You forgot to add the option of ‚ÄúMS-13 Loving Joe Biden‚Äù like the survey put out by the official Trump campaign.
But is Biden really going to make ice cream illegal?!?! üòÇ
He hates babies. He hates pie...all kinds of pie. If you elect Biden you won‚Äôt be able to have babies or eat pie. He hates sunsets. He hates the beach.

With her deep and long-standing ties to the Silicon Valley elite, Harris‚Äôs selection as Biden‚Äôs running mate has corporate leaders breathing a deep sigh of relief. Biden couldn‚Äôt be clearer he will be dedicated to shoring up a crumbling status quo.
I see the plan. In multiple democratic voting states sorting machines have been removed ect. In other states he will use Kanye to siphon off votes. If he wins Biden should not concede but challenge.

Biden/Harris dodged questions on (insert literally anything).
It has literally zero bearing on who he is voting for in the general election and in no way impacts the general election against Trump since Biden already has more delegates. He's representing the wishes of CA, as he is supposed to do.
The only problem is what else can he destroy or undermine before y‚Äôall get there?? Scary.  Gonna be a mess to clean up but can‚Äôt have another 4 years of Trump!!! Vote Biden/Harris
Vote for Biden. He‚Äôs better than Trump. He‚Äôll attract better, competent people to his administration, and he‚Äôll listen to experts.
Why are you afraid for the country to hear Joe Biden go FTF with Donald Trump??? #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Everyone knows poor Biden has dementia and Harris is just plain ridiculous.

White supremacist are a group of old Democrats who hung with Robert Byrd. Like Biden, Hillary and many other old Democrats.
Wut.  No read between the lines here. They want someone for 12 years. They want to pass off the presidency to the VP after Biden's first term, and she doesn't want to commit 12 years. I don't know if she actually wanted to commit to 8, but 12 is a long time at that age.
The more I see the more I believe that this country is so divided. Just like the days before the civil war. I am dreading the election this year. Nobody will win. Because if Trump wins every thing burns if Biden wins every thing burns. This is what I have been tweeting and seeing
My Dad feels GREAT about Biden/Harris. Most hopeful he's sounded in years. Old labor Dem. Makes me feel even more excited.  I believe that we will win.
Great quote just now by former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee ‚ÄúJoe Biden is as useless as a milk bucket under a bull.‚Äù
Uh. When did he do that? He hasn't. Go read his platform instead of believing everything Fox News tells you.  They even showed Trump in a Fox interview searching the source he claims he got that lie from and being unable to find Biden supporting that

Williams says that she will still vote for the Biden-Harris ticket, calling it the "lesser of two evils."   "In a perfect world, we would have candidates that we can throw our full weight behind, but we don't. This is our reality," said Williams.

#BidenHarris2020  So latest slight is that when Biden loses his mind as president, Harris will be president. Somehow that's 'bad'. Bad like a woman president, or Bad like the POTUS thinks the 1917 pandemic ended WWII? Which one was more BAD?
For an account with a timeline like this one to be calling anything a joke is a massive joke unto itself. Biden??? GTFO.
Vice presidents hardly ever win the presidency. That would be a horrible mistake. They're going to retire Biden &amp; move Kamala in during the 1st term  They planned this. This is why Kamala got so much undue media attention in the primary. This is why Biden was spoofed to us.
And then eventually move on to "Biden can't drink water" "Biden can't handle ramps" and "Biden abused Einstein visas and chain migration for his wife and their family" because that's how much truth actually means to them.
Not only that but Biden was one of the first major politicians to come out for same sex marriage.   People‚Äôs opinions change.

Dumbest thing you've heard so far...I guess that means you haven't heard that Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate and she identifies as African American.  Her dad is Jamician and her mom is from India.
Biden "picked" the only person with a worse record with black men.. #trainwreck better hop on the #TrumpTrain now!
You need to make an ad of the Democrat debates where Harris and Biden went after each other.  All the times she called him a racist would be good to show people.
With Kamyria Harris in office if Biden win it will be Massive voter fraud, Harris will have Mexican people here legally or not to vote for Biden, The dirty Democrates need to win so they can destroy our nation !!

Dude you are endorsing one of the authors of today's incarceration issue. They do not want to end the war on drugs, they do not want to support the American people. The only thing the Democrats have going for with Joe Biden is he isn't Trump. Vote Jo Jorgensen 2020 #Letherspeak
In choosing Harris, Biden is embracing a former rival from the Democratic primary who is familiar with the unique rigor of a national campaign.
Yep, Biden gets elected, then he is unable to serve. Harris is next up. Say NO.
Trump/Pence and Biden/Harris. Really terrible major party tickets for proponents of criminal justice reform. 2020 just keeps on giving.
At the end of the day, I am voting against Tr*mp. If you don‚Äôt vote Biden/Harris, you are voting for Tr*mp. Any argument against this ignores the reality of the US Electoral College System. If you want hope for all Americans, 4 more years isn‚Äôt gonna do it.

Biden is a racist. Said he would only find a VP that was a woman and black. Discrimination
Where's the Biden Harris merch??? Joe, you're slacking!
Great adjectives all fit her completely. We all know how far she is willing to go to climb the ladder. Biden is sure that she will bend a knee to him also. The pervert and princess prostitute wasn‚Äôt hard to figure that ticket out.

A lot of women of all colors will also be in Biden's Administration. Finally, it will really look like America. The days of White guys are gone and it is about time.
I don't think she is a great choice, the question is whether Biden , Harris is better than Trump , Pence. What do you think?
I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED I'M CRYING IN MY CAR AT WORK THIS IS SUCH GOOD NEWS THE FIRST IN TOO LONG!  Let's rebuild America better with Biden/Harris 2020.

Kamala Harris On Joe Biden Accusers: 'I Believe Them'
Biden choosing a woman running mate doesn't make me want to vote for Biden. I still will not vote for Biden or Trump. My conscience will not allow it.
Some people really want to be all or nothing when it comes to this shit and I'm just... REALLY tired of that, if I'm being honest.  I'm not saying a Biden presidency would be a leftist utopia, but fuck me, it'd be leagues better than the one we got now.
Biden just sealed his defeat with this pick. Trump wins in November.
Trumps gonna go up there and talk about the stock market. Honestly I can‚Äôt stand this guy but I got to at least capitalize off of how he drives stock prices, then when Biden comes in hopefully stocks crash so I can buy in cheaper

I'll support whomever Biden picks but I honestly don't want to hear about Benghazi every day for three months.
Evidently, some are ok with the serial predators.
Well, that's a compelling argument. You've certainly changed my mind! Biden has a 40+ year history of supporting conservative policy. You can literally pull it up on YouTube. If Ronald Regan came back to life, here be considered a moderate Democrat today.

Good question. I have done a bit of research, Derkach is real enough, a witting or unwitting tool of the GRU.  Putin is attempting to take over the Ukraine while hoping D Trump wins again in the US.   The Biden disinformation info feed is indirect, Derkach a mere GRU cats paw.
VEEPSTAKES: For all the secrecy and speculation that typically surrounds the search for a vice presidential candidate, the decision rarely sways an election. But ahead of Joe Biden's imminent announcement, this year arguably could be different.
Saying that Biden obviously has dementia is a ridiculous assertion that the Trump camp is trying to pass on to their ridiculous, gullible followers. I am a nurse in a LTC facility,  Biden does not have dementia.

Why ask him to step down? I don‚Äôt get it? So they can replace joe with someone who hasn‚Äôt had any negative ads run against them? Just have trump spend millions on ads against Biden only to make the campaign turnaround and start oppo on new candidate 85 days out?
Yes, but I don‚Äôt like biden. He threatened me once. Personally. I cant explain right now or i‚Äôll be in deep shit.

Biden's is pretty extensive. So you're either voting for someone who is atrocious or someone who has an atrocious record. Hence electoralism is bs.

The ONLY thing Biden knows about the Corona virus is his basement! Has he met with business owners, families or patients for a first hand account? Has he been to different parts of the country to see the impact?  What makes him qualified in Covid...Google?
The President doesn't even make laws. Focusing on these issues with these candidates is pointless. And we've seen how Biden handles protest. Has everyone forgotten Occupy and Standing Rock?
Nobody said it's all him, but it's a counterpoint to the idea that reform would be more likely under Biden.
I really can‚Äôt believe that people are going to keep on voting for the lesser of two evils. Joe and Kamala are going to maintain the status quo. All the BLM protests in vain if we elect Biden who wrote the infamous crime bill and cop, Kamala, who didn‚Äôt prosecute the SoT Mnuchin.

Harris was a champion of women, Blasey-Ford &amp; believe all women. She doggedly went after Kavenaugh when she believed he was a teenage, sexual predator. She is now the champion of Joe Biden. Has she changed her mind or sold her soul for power? Can‚Äôt be both!
What we should be asking is why did Biden choose a cop as VP during the year of #BLM? Kamala spent her career locking up minorities for nonviolent crimes.
If Biden were to win.... how will there be an Inauguration? How will he serve as POTUS if he can‚Äôt come out of the basement? Do the  pandemic-clairvoyant-Democrats KNOW we won‚Äôt be dealing with the Pandemic by Inauguration Day?  Hmmm? ü§î

Biden will never debate trump...book it. The minute he does it‚Äôs over for him.
Tone-deaf campaign. Michael Brown was a victim of his own behavior, not police malfeasance. The Obama-Biden Justice Dept. vindicated the officer involved. Add to that the circumstances igniting the Ferguson powder keg were created by Democrat policies. Many by Biden specifically.

Just like everything else you have ever said, this has no basis of reality. Which is it... Biden a racist or not?  Biden assault those women or not? Medicare for all or not? $93 trillion Green New Deal or not? For more police or defunding them? 18 year olds smart or dumb?

Biden doesn't even know he picked
I thought you were for American workers....   Why are your campaign hats produced in China?   Joe Biden's hats are union made right here in the U.S.A.  Sorry, I guess I'll vote Joe!
Check out where these campaign hats are produced. Trump's MAGA shit is from "Jina", and Biden's hats are union made in America.   What else do you need to know?
Despite democrats‚Äô best effort to create virus fear porn and burn their own cities in the name of nearly-non-existent police racial brutality, Trump‚Äôs economy, stock market, and unemployment rates ARE STILL BETTER than when Joe Biden &amp; Obama left office.
There will be thousands of people employed making Biden/Harris campaign signs in the next few weeks.
I‚Äôd rather vote trump than Biden tbh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Joe Biden's campaign tweeting about little girls; lots of reasons for thoughtful folks to support Biden, but maybe a bit of self-reflection, &amp; caution here, &amp; that YUCH reflex? Maybe Sen Harris' team should take over? Maybe?
It's "Joe Biden is too tough on crime and that's racist", but also "Joe Biden hates law and order and will let our cities burn." It's "we need to drain the swamp" but also "I already drained the swamp and we have the best people." It's "MAGA", but it's also "KAG."
The country needs Presidential debates. We need to see both side by side to answer questions. Make sure Biden doesn‚Äôt get the questions before debates!!!!
When will the democrats admit that Biden can‚Äôt do the job? Let him have a debate with President Trump and everyone will see how he is not able to be President. His wife and people close to him should be ashamed of themselves for using him like this.
Everyone remember when Kamillion Harris said she believes Joe Biden,s accusers. Wonder if she will flip flop on that like most Democrats are good at.
Biden will not win!!
Hell no will I vote for corruption Joe biden
I met Joe Biden last year. He was kind, thoughtful, and engaged. When I brought up trans rights, he got very serious. He leaned in and with a finger
Biden reportedly mocked for using script to tap Kamala Harris as his running mate  via
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Joe Biden and Kamala Harris used Joe‚Äôs dead son to try to score cheap political points and sympathy votes today... while completely ignoring his LIVING son, but okay, yeah sure, Trump‚Äôs the one who will ‚Äúdo anything for power‚Äù, right? Shameful.
As a Tennessean, I can‚Äôt wait to vote you out and Biden in.
A negative Biden/Harris comment equals a positive Trump/Pence comment. This election is bigger than the Presidency.
Of course if Biden doesn't win, black folks like yourself will blame white  it.
Too bad Trump doesn't have a dead son to roll out at a political rally to try to drum up sympathy votes.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è That was beyond pathetic, and petty. Not a single mention of Hunter, Biden's LIVING son, but both he and Kamala jumped on the Beau bandwagon today. What a horrible display.
You just completely misrepresented that entire exchange. Why would you do something like that? I listened to that entirely &amp; he stated that suburbia is a place where a lot of people aspire to live (ALL people) &amp; some regs under Obama/Biden allow high density/low income housing.
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via   I only had $5 to give, but if we can all give a little, it can add up to a big message to Trump #BidenHarris2020Landslide
And a believer of Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers. ü§î üòÇ
ü§£ Joe Biden and Kamala Harris roll out Biden's dead son today to score political points and sympathy votes (while completely ignoring his living son) and Soros thinks it's Trump that "will do anything"?!?ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
‚ÄúYou Ain‚Äôt Black‚Äù Biden is the only racist in this race. Kamala‚Äôs ancestor in Jamaica was a famous Plantaion slave owner.  Look up Hamilton Brown. Brown‚Äôs Town in Jamaica is named after him. #CNNNarrativeStreet
Seems like Joe Biden has a new link! Type  and check out who's website it is directed to! #WakeUpAmerica #Antifa #Biden #Trump2020
That's the dumbest and most false statement Biden has ever said lol Trump created the lowest unemployment rate in history so....
I‚Äôd give anything to hear Biden say Build Back Better 3 times in a row. #Trump2020
This Kamala/Biden event is going great. Very heartfelt discussion of Kamala‚Äôs relationship with Joe. She‚Äôs a strong speaker and they have chemistry, much more so than Trump/Pence.  I think Trump‚Äôs done for.
Under a Biden presidency, little girls everywhere will worry about this -
It's kind of crazy just how many of the most prominent politicians in the US have Jewish in-laws.  All three of Biden's kids married Jews.  Two of Trump's four (adult) kids married Jews.  Hillary's daughter married a Jew.  Kamala married a Jew.  Only Pence has no Jewish relatives
Oh for sure. And the best part is they'll end up helping the Dem ticket is they do it. "Kamala is a cop." "Biden supports Obamacare" 90% of normal people like those things lmao
The best part about those bernie cucks is that they talked themselves into a box where they either reluctantly support kamala/biden or they look like psycopaths. You can't go around saying trump is Literally Bringing Nazism Back for four years, then refuse to back his opponent.
Biden! we will vote him in, and then criticize him every single day. no free passes just because he‚Äôs a dem. biden and harris are problematic, but they aren‚Äôt reality tv star and his homophobic side kick level pure evil.
Unfortunately, Kasich has allowed his hatred of Trump to support Biden.  Kasich is a two-faced list and lackey for the DemocRATS.  He should be flooded with Tweets pointing to his hypocrisy
Looks like Joe Biden picked one of the ringleaders of the Kavanaugh hearings. Just imagine what she would do as VP. We have problems in this country if that liberal b**** Kamala Harris is the VP. Vote for Trump in 2020.
Seriously? These are the best two candidates you have?
Far dumber are the ex-Bernie bros like the Chapo guys who refuse to support Biden because Kamala's a cop, or he's too moderate or whatever.   Either you were bluffing when you swore Trump was a fascist maniac this time last year, or you're just totally amoral and don't care.
It's funny to make fun of the ex-Bernie people for reluctantly supporting Biden but it's actually pretty coherent.  A lot of these people genuinely believe Drumph is the next Hitler and the world is going to end from climate change. You can't think that way then just...not vote.
yall complained about trump for four straight years, and now yall voting for biden üò≠üò≠üò≠
Again, at this point it seems purposeful. I can't think of any other reason why Biden would completely ignore the current political climate.
IÔ∏è wouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden . The VP he picked isn‚Äôt back nor did she ever identify herself as a black woman until now.  She‚Äôs Indian
Sorry dude, but naming Super Cop as VP during nationwide protests of police brutality is fucking tone deaf, and at this point it seems like even Biden wants Trump to win.  There's no excuse for it. He chose to disenfranchise yet again.
Woke up this morning feeling fine. Biden and Harris are on my mind.
I think that removing the current openly fascist regime is important, but I also recognize that Biden is very much a part of the imperialist/fascist machine that is our nation
I plan to vote for Biden because his brand of diet imperialism/fascism will be easier to resist. I agree ousting the current fascist regime is the most important thing. What I don't get is why the DNC/libs think that a republican and a cop are the ones to do it.
The term Bernie bros is exactly what I'm talking about üôÑ you've both just demonstrated my point beautifully.   Bernie was the compromise. Leftists fight fascism/imperialism. Libs just vote for the diet version.   I'm voting biden. But I'll still be in the streets if he wins.
Ha. Right?! I mean, I like Harris quite a bit. Biden creeps me out. But I wouldn‚Äôt throw Trump a life raft if he were drowning in front of his own damn family. He‚Äôs a disgusting human being.
That being said, there are valid critiques to be made about Biden and Harris(although her blackness is not one of them). I just don‚Äôt care to be subjected to them ad nauseam. Plus I fully don‚Äôt expect this election to be free and fair, so this all feels very moot.
We are so happy #katiecouric to see the Biden Harris ticket! It has been almost 4 years since we have had a real leader.  I am looking forward to seeing intelligence,integrity, class, and diplomacy will be in our WH again! Everyone please join me in making this a landslide win.
For the record, not that anyone cares, I‚Äôm voting Biden/Harris bc I am terrified at the prospect of Trump apportioning RBG‚Äôs SCOTUS sweat to a regressive, and appointing additional federal judges, in addition to him turning the US into even more of a dictatorship.

Biden: *sees BLM*  Biden (probably): I need to choose a VP that will really energize the progressive base in these trying times, especially the poor and underrepresented communities in our country. We need to beat Trump!  ALSO BIDEN: *picks a fucking cop*
Biden just wants to collect the title for the books then let her do the work.
It‚Äôs certainly a PR release, but I suspect it‚Äôs a real shot of the conversation. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd stage it that way otherwise. Also, was the ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, man‚Äù a Biden parody? Because if so, well done.
Also, as an #Apple nerd I‚Äôm fascinated that it‚Äôs a MacBook Air. Venerable workhorse computer and best for most users/uses. Can‚Äôt say for sure, but I‚Äôm guessing it belongs to the campaign, not Biden or an individual staffer since the Dock icons seem mostly stock.
I‚Äôve seen a lot of dunking on #Biden for the upside down #iPhone, but it looks like speaker mode is enabled, so my guess is he‚Äôs letting whoever is on the phone say something to Harris on the Zoom call. Phone speaker to Mac mic as it were.
Kamala-Biden- because enough of you aren't in prison
But but but - we KNOW 45 is a monster and getting some normalcy back is going to be very valuable. A prez is partly a team and I think Biden‚Äôs team will be strong. I want M4A too but you‚Äôd have to have super-majorities in all branches to make it happen.
Y‚Äôall please go out and vote. I literally cannot do another 4 years of Trumps America where people think they can get away with blatant racism. Please go VOTE. Even if you don‚Äôt like Joe Biden, WRITE SOMEONE ELSE IN.   IF YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE, DO IT.
I‚Äôm never going to vote for Joe Biden. I may not vote for Trump either but I will never be someone who voted for that sick old man that‚Äôs been proven to be racist and constantly makes racist remarks. Not to mention he‚Äôs a pedo and there‚Äôs proof. Our choices suck man.
Kamala Harris is not a black woman like Biden said he would pick.
Going from Michelle Obama to the Slovenian mail-order bride, then to Dr. Jill Biden is even more of a pendulum swing than between the three presidents.
Nobody ever said Joe Biden was smart! #Trump2020
Trump is going to absolutely maul Biden in the debates. It‚Äôs going to be sad to see him bludgeoned so.
What happens when Biden debates Trump?
I hope you are President Biden‚Äôs first Supreme Court pick. Wanted you to be VP. If not on the court I all for Klobuchar 2024!
Biden must be losing his memory becuse how dose one put harris in as vp when she calls him a sex  saying she beleve s many women who said he did.and indirectly calls him a
Biden picking  (someone who was a cop, BUT ALSO a woman/POC) was 100% intentional. And honestly, very smart. Pulling people to Biden who were on the fence.   Do I love it? No. Do I think it‚Äôll help get Trump out of office. Yes. And what else do we want at this point?
I‚Äôm tired of choosing the lesser of 2 evils. Biden‚Äôs past racist comments and ‚ÄùStop &amp; Frisk‚Äù law that has put away countless of people for victimless crimes is just as disgusting as Trump. #WakeUpAmerica #EndtheDuopoly #MakeAmericaFreeAgain #VoteGold
Biden picked a winner in Kamala!  They will go on to win the election in Nov. Trump  will get out of our WH and hopefully he takes his trash with him! üòÇüòÇ.  It will be #BidenHarris2020 by a landslide November 3 2020!
Hey patriots, today‚Äôs announcement of Biden‚Äôs VP makes the Senate and House races even more important! Vote red straight down the ticket! üá∫üá∏
"Wow I can't believe Bernie endorsed Biden, what a sellout"  Why? It's a completely coherent position. If you're a leftist and you truly believe Trump is putting kids in concentration camps on the border &amp; bringing climate extinction, you'd have to be crazy *not* to vote Bidien.
If you're a leftist and you *truly* believe what you said about Trump running concentration camps on the borer, bringing us toward global climate extinction etc., why *wouldn't* you vote for Biden? You'd have to be an immoral psychopath not to vote for the lesser evil.
There's something so telling about that clip of Kamala laughing hysterically going, "It was just a debate!" when Stephen Colbert asked her if her attacks on Biden were sincere.  It's so honest. She finds the idea of saying what you really believe naive. It's a show for her.
no one has a potty mouth worse than you, as you criticize Biden pick.  You should be very afraid with this Kamala Harris.  Mostly because you suck so badly.
Lol you know the trump team had a video ready for anyone Biden could‚Äôve picked for VP
As a conservative, I can say this is absolutely true. Biden‚Äôs handlers and Kamala have been courting the Bernie Bros for their votes, but they have no intention of blowing up their corporate sponsors with an actual progressive agenda. Progressives need to form that 3rd party.
PACK. YOUR. SHIT.   It's over, comrade. I know it, you know it, everybody knows it. You can't complete a sentence, but you're going to BE sentenced the day after Joe Biden is inaugurated~!   Try to get a cell with a view.
Can I go ahead and cast my vote for Biden/Harris now? Nothing will change my mind. Do whatever it takes to get Cheeto Man out of that office. #BidenHarris #VicePresident #KamalaHarris
We really said we wanted a strong, progressive VP to help get us excited about a Biden presidency and he really said, ‚ÄúNo ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù
So you think highlighting that Biden and Harris are tougher on #LawAndOrder than  is a winning message?   Another solid strategy from #ConInc. Next maybe you could circle back to touting how much Trump has done for #HBCU
#Obamagate scared Biden away from Rice and now he's stuck with this üòÇ
What Trump should attack Kamala for: Her radical positions in the primaries like decriminalizing illegal immigration and gun seizures  What Trump will attack Kamala for: "she called joe biden a RACIST and she locked up poor innocent black men!!!"
The only people who can win this election are Biden or Trump. I don‚Äôt see any other option. I don‚Äôt love it but I‚Äôm gonna back it to get rid of this monster.
Biden picking a black woman who "happens" to be a cop as vp js exactly the kind of tone deaf bullshit that I've come to expect from the DNC.   It doesn't make me any less mad about it.
... Trump is going2 KILL Biden in the debates!
I‚Äôm so old I can remember when Harris insinuated Biden was a horrible racist...
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate
And there it is.
Ya'll ever cry because Biden chose Kamala as his VP or is it just me
A cop is definitely the person biden needs to even out his incredibly progressive ticket üôÑ
One thing you can bet your life on:  Right now Donald Trump is pissed off because Joe Biden is getting all of the attention on television and social media, without even saying anything.   Promise you. It's killing him!   Expect a major "Squirrel!" distraction any minute...

Biden could pick CarrotTop and I would still vote for him over Trump.
But she‚Äôs also the only person on Biden‚Äôs list who spent part of the 1970s working construction in Fidel Castro‚Äôs Cuba with the Venceremos Brigade, a group that has organized annual trips to Cuba for young, leftist Americans for half a century.‚Äú
But #Biden is so well spoken!üòÇüòÇ
At this point, there's not much #Biden does know unless someone tells him.
Just had a weird fuckin dream where Biden and Trump were playing hunger games for the presidency with someone else i'm no longer friends with
... their employers each pay Social Security payroll taxes of 6.2 percent of wages. Biden proposed in March that he would increase the payroll tax rate for Americans making in excess of $400,000, The Hill¬†reported¬†in March.  The economy plummeted after....
... payroll tax holiday.  Biden now says that it is ‚Äúa reckless war on social security.‚Äù¬†  ‚Äî Eddie Zipperer (¬†August 9, 2020  ‚ÄúIt is my expectation, in fact it would be inexcusable for Congress not to further extend this middle-class...
I'm not saying I'm Biden's VP pick...but I'm not saying I'm not.
üêÇüí©!!! Joe Biden tried to cut social security &amp; medicaid for decades.
Why do Joe Biden and the Democrats remain silent and never denounce this rioting and looting of businesses that provide jobs for hard working Americans? Oh I see...trash the businesses to prevent hiring workers to raise unemployment to hurt Trump.
Can't wait for some big-brained geniuses on here to explain to me how some of that 94% are actually just disaffected white nationalists voting for Biden to make a statement, or something.
I don‚Äôt see how a disgraced former prosecutor from San Francisco (who imprisoned African Americans at a record pace and got her job by sleeping with a disgraced Mayor) could possibly ‚Äòhelp‚Äô the Democrat/Biden ticket... not to mention she‚Äôs Indian by birth, not African American.
Splitting hairs. It was my ‚Äòbest guess‚Äô, given the speculative tweet I was replying to... the intimation was that an African American female who was a Governor is Biden‚Äôs choice for VP... please, do you have a ‚Äòbetter‚Äô assumption? üòë
Biden allowed himself to get backed in to a corner when he committed to an African American female... he has no choice but to follow through on that promise but if he does, no matter who he selects, he‚Äôs screwed. They ALL have baggage and none of them appeal to the ‚Äòmiddle‚Äô. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The only female African American Governor in the U.S. is Muriel Bowser - Governor of Washington, D.C.?!? No way... that would kill any chance Biden might‚Äôve had. ü§î
If any veteran votes for Biden, let me just say this. A vote for Biden is a vote for all of Obama and Clinton's policies INCLUDING Benghazi! Kust remember!
I don't care if Biden picks his nose, I'm voting for Joe.
Yep!   ‚ÄúChina Joe Biden‚Äù
Why I Want Biden to Lose More than I Want Trump to Win  For two months we‚Äôve been witnessing chaos and destruction in Portland and other cities run by progressive Democrats, yet no one in the Democratic Party will stand up and condemn the violence as if...

He doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúmess up‚Äù sentences. He can‚Äôt complete them. How is Trump racist? Lowest black unemployment under any president and history, but who cares, he‚Äôs racist? Gtfoh. And Biden is a pedophile. Plenty of clips to prove that for ya too
I probably should have said *their-self to include both of them. But still. Both Biden‚Äôs and Clinton‚Äôs central selling point is ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm not Trump, vote for me‚Äù and it‚Äôs just really really sad.
Even if I did align with Jo Jorgensen politically, we still can‚Äôt afford to not give Biden a vote. Yet another ineffectual moderate with no ability to rally support by himself. I have to do my part to try and make this not a complete remake of 2016.
Asked with a straight face and the answer was given with a straight face. These people are truly unbelievable!  The media is 6 to 1 or more in favor of Biden and yet ‚Äútheir truth‚Äù is that it‚Äôs the other way around. Simply amazing!

Biden needs a black woman that helps him with the black vote, and that is not Kamala... not sure Susan Rice delivers the black vote either, so it‚Äôs wide open right now, in my opinion.
The Koch brothers don‚Äôt like him because he knows they are in deep with the establishment also.  What has he lied. Cheated or stolen.  Not Biden or his son. Trump.
The liberal presidents at these universities see the benefit of not playing  thereby trying to hurt President Trump. They will hope Biden gets elected who would then bail out all of the programs with our tax dollars.
I don‚Äôt like anything about Joe Biden. His policies, the way he carries himself &amp; his business. He‚Äôs a condescending jerk of the highest degree. BUT, seeing what his friends, party, family, and his fellow Dems are doing to him is heartbreaking. It‚Äôs senior abuse. They‚Äôre pathetic
Joe Biden can‚Äôt complete a coherent sentence and you wanna vote for him? Saw a thing today that said ‚ÄúJoe Biden isn‚Äôt stupid, his mental status is just declining. Anyone who votes for Joe Biden, however, is stupid‚Äù
What about Biden‚Äôs insults? Trump never strikes first.  He wants hydrochloriquin used but the doctors won‚Äôt.  What about all the good he tries to do?
I got one.   So Biden was going to finish a sentence and ..... can‚Äôt get past that for the punch line.
Name 3 policy‚Äôs of Biden‚Äôs you like.  And 3 policy‚Äôs if trumps you don‚Äôt.

We have no racism except for you Biden. Democrats have started terrorism in 2020.

That's President Trump's plan. You know, the one that has been bringing jobs back to the U.S. Biden &amp; Obama said Trump would need a "magic wand"
If Biden manages to steal the election, it will be interesting to see how the reputation of America changes to a kowtow country due to his weak foreign policy against our enemies.
Joe Biden is explicitly running on exactly not this
She sounds perfect for a Biden VP candidate üëç
I was just wondering. Joe Biden says if he's elected he will make illegal immigrants citizens and also illegal immigrants will have free healthcare. Once he gives and illegal immigrant citizenship since they are now Americans do they lose their free insurance. Freaking idiot....
‚ÄúHe‚Äôll revitalize American manufacturing and create millions of good-paying jobs‚Äù It‚Äôs interesting that the last time Biden had a chance to do that, he did the opposite.
He's a damn clone that's what happened.. The Biden in 2008 can articulate very well. The man of 2020, is not the same person OR it could be the affects of Adrenochrome. Take your pick. I just don't like him either way.
So spot on , I can‚Äôt even imagine CNN if Trump said what Biden did. It‚Äôs unreal the hatred of the fake media
BotSentinel is biased against conservatives so big whoopie-doo. Why are you so worked up over me posting a video representing the truth that Biden himself addressed? Instead of trying to bash me why not just research it? BTW: I‚Äôm a southern suburban grandmother. #Truth

Looks like Joe Biden trying get a thought out
It's October 2020. At a speech on prison reform, Biden mentions that black people commit half of all murders. Trump calls it "disgraceful."  tweets out the clip, saying "Racist Joe Biden just lost black voters!" Two weeks later, Biden wins 94% of the black vote.
There's nothing going on in Biden's mind. He lost it
Biden: Worked under Obama for 8 years and his campaign rescued by Jim Clyburn. Trump violated FAIR housing and has been known to be a prolific user of racial slurs.

The obviously bad faith attacks calling Biden racist reminder me of the obviously bad faith attacks in the UK calling Corbyn anti-semitic. In both cases, people took their priors and used it to justify the slightest transgressions.  Then again, the attacks on Corbyn *worked*.
So to keep tabs, over the past week Joe Biden's two big "gaffes" are:  1. Saying black voters have less political diversity than Latinos (true) 2. After a reporter asked him if he took a mental fitness test, he jokingly asked the reporter if he took a drug test  Who cares??
Biden wants to destroy oil, raise taxes, and get back into bed with China. That‚Äôs not exactly a winning message in rust belt states.
Oh absolutely.  Biden is the inferior choice between him and Bernie.  BECAUSE OF HIS POLICIES.  Saying his car is somehow the problem is no better than saying Bernie doesn't genuinely want income inequality because "he has three houses".  It's a disingenuous attack.
Another thing is the news media cleaned up this statement for Biden. Have they ever did that for Pres. Trump? NO!
Joe Biden says just as much if not more controversial things than Trump does soooo maybe vote third party (?)
Joe Biden your nothing but a career politician that lies to get ahead. We don't want you in government at all.

So should Biden NOT attempt to garner votes during the run up to an election?    Weird how you think Biden saying "I own a car," seems like it's out of touch when addressing a country with the most cars per capita worldwide.  You sure BIDEN is the one out of touch here?
Hey, you know people can still support him and also think he made a weird statement.  I'll take Joe "My dad could drive a car" Biden over Donald "Grab em by the pussy" Trump any day.  Doesn't make it not a goofy thing to say.

That's one more home than MY wife inherited.  Which brings their total up to TWO more homes they own than me an my spouse.  And WE'RE lucky to have the ONE statistically speaking.  Whining about Biden inheriting a car but defending Bernie owning 3 houses is hypocritical.
Nobody said it was.  But you used a VERY Republican argument with your "If you want a second house, just go get one."  Bernie having those three homes doesn't make him a hypocrite.  But throwing shade at Biden for something also true of Bernie does make YOU a hypocrite.
Well Obama gave a campaign speech for Biden at John Lewis' funeral! Move on Jim!

As the obese Haitian female caretaker repeatedly punches the wheelchair-bound boomer and tells him to "shutcho white ass up", the boomer has one final, dying thought as consciousness slips away from him: "Can you BELIEVE what Joe Biden said about African-Americans today??"
He's (once again) attacking Biden for making some dumb joke a decade ago about Indians working at 7/11, and calling Obama articulate. I've seen him play these clips dozens of times. I don't get it. Does he think literally anyone cares? Why play by the Left's rules on racism?
Fucking stupid. It‚Äôs either rebuild our democratic republic back to the Obama standings (Biden) or become more of an authoritarian state (Trump). Why the fuck could any real American struggle with this???
Biden should debate Trump on the condition that Trump release his tax returns.

Wait people are acting like this is some big gaffe when Biden LITERALLY just attacked the entire black community. It‚Äôs hilarious. And he corrected himself right after! Just pathetic.
It‚Äôs wild that he‚Äôs trying to make shit up to call Biden‚Äôs cognitive abilities into question and he can‚Äôt even keep his own lies straight. If there are palm trees everywhere, then the man was very damn likely in Florida.
Many comments under the tweet are from MAGAs and Qanon folks who think this is related to the Obama/Biden administration...
Way to make Biden sound like a superhero, Trump.
Biden‚Äôs point is that politically, Latinos have different views regionally. That‚Äôs true‚Äîthey‚Äôre conservative in Florida, nearly evenly split in Texas, and liberal in the Southwest.   That‚Äôs not true for blacks, who vote Democrat as a block everywhere. Why attack an obvious truth?
35% of Latinos vote Republican. 5% of blacks vote Republican.  Unlike African Americans, Latinos hail from dozens of different countries.  Latinos can be black, white, indigenous, or mixed.  By literally what metric is Biden wrong? Can a single Republican tell me?

Biden shows his age more and is much more senile. They're both old, Biden acts much older though.
Immediately after the oath of office President Biden should sign an executive order to release children from cages, make all efforts to reunite them with family, and provide them with any support and healthcare they will need. This is just human decency and Christianity!
Trump might go on small tangents sometimes, but he pretty much always gets back to the point. Some folks are better than Trump, sure, but he's better than Biden if you look at what Trump has done for the economy and for minority groups.
I'd rather have a man who loves this country like Trump, who has done great things for the economy, than a senile racist pedo like Biden who has done little since the 70s when he entered the government.
The lesser of two evils definitely isn't the side with a guy who's openly racist and pedophilic and who likely has dementia like Biden. Trump has done some great stuff, he locked down the nation due to COVID-19 before it was recommended, for example. Trump is infinitely better.
Kampala is Obama‚Äôs choice. Biden is just his puppet. Harris wasn‚Äôt electable as President. Biden has more potential to win. At least until the debates.
Biden likely won't make it to 2024, which is the earliest that he even has a chance of getting the presidency.
It's very questionable if Biden will make it to 2024, much less 2025 for the inauguration, if he somehow wins the next election that he even has a chance of winning.

Is Obama running for Pres again? Any issues we had with him have been discussed and we‚Äôve moved on. Trump is president now, and he‚Äôs running against Biden.
They are laughing at us now...because of you and you ineptitude. Biden has been in the world stage, for many years. Never heard anyone laughing at us because of him.
A few news shows did stronger then in previous weeks. Possibly the Biden VP pick drove people to watch the news for some reason?
You criticized the woman for using a bad word as if you are perfect and special. He who is without sin, cast the first stone. Since you found her using the word ‚Äúbitch‚Äù so horrible, how do you feel about Joe Biden and Harris being fully for murdering innocent babies? Is that ok?

We don't have to be happy about this reality, but we do have to acknowledge it.  We have to vote.  Biggest turn out ever.  Biden Harris 2020.  Because the nightmare must end.
I always believe I‚Äôll survive, but I know many won‚Äôt. I expect it will be so ugly, even with a Biden/Harris victory.
Biden just recommended universal masking for all Americans and for ALL Governors to recommend masking. This is what‚Äôs needed to decrease viral transmission.  #RealLeadership
Kamala Harris only speaks knowledge of what she knows that‚Äôs happened between her legs . When uncle Joe Biden miss pronounced her name she was probably on her knees giving him a pump up job . That‚Äôs why sleeping Joe was smiling and said her name wrong.  Great for each other
Such political BS - the "15 days to slow the spread" lockdown that going on 6 months killed the economy and you know it. Quit saying garbage that even you know is wrong.   For someone who called Biden a racist and a rapist you sure are fast to ride his coattails now.
Maybe. Too bad presidential elections aren‚Äôt decided by board members. The optics on this are so bad I bet that Biden‚Äôs lead widens.
Another mind-blowing self-own. "Vote for the Trump Team. We're rich people who don't even slow down as we blow past your town in our armored comfort. Didn't even bother to install windows because we're not interested in your sad lives. Unlike that hard-working chump, Joe Biden."
is a liar and opportunistic piece of garbage as a politician. She is not moderate - the farthest thing from it - and she is Biden's best choice as VP for Trump's campaign.

Exactly. The president didn't mention anything about color. Which isn't racist. The person who wrote this tweet DID, which is actually very racist. Interesting. It's a lot like Biden saying "poor kids are just as smart as white kids."

Point being, if you're thinking of shit-talking or not voting for Biden/Harris because they aren't ideal, try holding your guy to the same standard and it might give you a 2nd thought, not to mention that Biden's and Harris' positions now are not what they were in the '90s.
And he's doing it to destroy his "competition" and to prevent people from voting for Biden/Harris. We can hope that those in rural areas who may well have voted for Trump will get angry enough at losing their mail service to vote him OUT.
Yes ! Go Biden/ Harris ... thank you!
Tbh, I think he only picked her because Michelle said no.  Kamala has been openly against Biden, so the whole thing just seems real fishy.  But having a black woman VP running mate is a "good look" for him and the Democratic party

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt care about Biden‚Äù = translate to you don‚Äôt care what he says or why...you didn‚Äôt care to comment on his outrage and blatant racism...but you cared to comment on this women‚Äôs post which isn‚Äôt racist at all ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I agree with you whole heartedly! We are under weak leadership and deserve better that‚Äôs 100 percent TRUE! But all I‚Äôm saying is that Joe Biden isn‚Äôt any better. It‚Äôs like we are at a point where it‚Äôs literally anybody but trump.
I still wish Trump would have Pence step down and bring in Tulsi as his new VP candidate just to see the debates.  Which if they want VP debates then there shouldn't be any issue with Trump/Biden debating.
Hot take, but I want Biden to win because I want to bully him and everyone associated with him for 4-8 years.  I want to show libs that our societal problems go deeper than Trump. I want Trump to cry about losing.  I want to be mean to Biden.  I want to be Biden's Jeff Tiedrich.
If you care about this woman‚Äôs tweets but not Biden‚Äôs outrage and blatant racism you should not have commented at all...  take a lap son
MSNBC's Mitchell Makes Over Disgraced Dem Into Feminist Hero: How Can Biden's VP Fight Sexist 'Attacks' Like You Faced?
If that were really the case... you wouldn't be so afraid.  You know he will take votes from Biden, and, you know that Trump is going to win... either way.  The rest of us aren't as stupid as the Democrat base.
So you one of those that‚Äôs just voting for whoever runs against trump to get him out? Cause if YOU do your research you‚Äôll see Biden isn‚Äôt any better. Speak facts not opinions.
She was a presidential candidate &amp; has been a senator. Did Biden pick her simply because she is black? I have no idea. But it's discounting her to say that. He clearly promised to pick a woman which I have some issue with. But I think that Kamala is a solid VP choice for him.
Kamala* is Joe Biden's running mate or future potential VP
‚ÄúClose enough.‚Äù (Probably) Biden
Experts held 'war games' on the Trump vs. Biden election. Their finding? Brace for a mess  #SmartNews
They just can't help themselves.
So, this is the approach that the right is going to take. Biden won't finish his term, so it's all about Kamala. Men like Ben are always terrified by smart women. Smart black women are their own personal nightmares.
At the convention Joe Biden is going to give an Eastwood-like speech to a chair but he‚Äôs going to think the chair is actually a person
Trump has to go.  Biden/Harris is what we've been given to do it.  They get my vote to get rid of Trump. But they need to know my vote will hold them accountable and demand better.  We will be on your asses. America deserves real leadership. It's time to shape up.
Trump gonna attack biden from the left
You are spot-on and this should be shout from rooftops. People treat championing their candidacy as not wanting to hold them accountable. Yes we will still be a marginalized group if Biden-Harris are elected, but the fact they aren‚Äôt Trump is why we must support their candidacy.
Don't get me wrong. I'm taking Chomsky's and Dr. West's advice. I will vote for Biden/Harris. But that does NOT mean I'm going to act excited. Biden and Harris' policies were inimical to brown and black communities. They work for us, remember that. Hold them accountable.
Biden shows his age more and is much more senile. They're both old, Biden acts much older though.
I didn't say I wasn't going to. What I said was, this isn't a zero sum game. When Biden was VP the first time everything wasn't gravy and everything will not instantly turn to gravy the moment these two are elected. As far as school, what if we funded that instead of gassing ppl?
Uhm...... Biden is catholic.
Kamala, is not ADOS,( AMERICAN DESCENDANTS OF SLAVERY) BIDEN WILL FIND OUT THIS IN NOVEMBER
Vote for Biden and you won‚Äôt have to worry about fighting for your kids or family. You‚Äôll be too worried about fighting for yourself when they allow the mobs of rioters to take over your city. Hear Chicago is a nice place to live now days.
Moments After Biden Announced Harris, Trump Absolutely Flattened Her
GREAT NEWS!!!  Go Biden/Harris!!!
Immediately after the oath of office President Biden should sign an executive order to release children from cages, make all efforts to reunite them with family, and provide them with any support and healthcare they will need. This is just human decency and Christianity!
The voter shaming I keep seeing from democrats is annoying as FUCK. Don‚Äôt shame me for not choosing ‚Äúthe lesser evil‚Äù especially when I live in a safe red state. Fuck Trump &amp; Fuck Biden. I said what I said.
Trump might go on small tangents sometimes, but he pretty much always gets back to the point. Some folks are better than Trump, sure, but he's better than Biden if you look at what Trump has done for the economy and for minority groups.
I'd rather have a man who loves this country like Trump, who has done great things for the economy, than a senile racist pedo like Biden who has done little since the 70s when he entered the government.
Biden had to read off a script yesterday to congratulate Kamala Harris on possibly being the VP of the United States. A SCRIPT TO CONGRATULATE SOMEONE GENUINELY WITHOUT FORGETTING WHAT HES TALKING ABOUT?! ‚ÄúCome on, man‚Äù
The horns were honking!! Thumbs were Up as I was putting out yard signs in support of Joe #Biden and #Kamala Harris for president and vice president and #MikeEspy for Mississippi US Senate. Tyranny has arrived in‚Ä¶
myles was tryna convince me voting dat Biden is somehow a good candidate lmao
Biden would have been better off picking Gabbard
Is Kamala a "top cop" or a "police defunder"? Can't be both! Looks like the brilliant Joe Biden has you over a barrel trying to figure out how to attack her.
Unity can‚Äôt be accomplished with calculated moves to silence the voices of 800+ Biden, Sanders, and Warren delegates by announcing the #VP pick during a *symbolic* protest vote. #M4A #M4AllNow #DrawTheLine #BidenHarris2020
Yesterday at 3pm ET, delegates submitted protest votes against the #DNC platform in a symbolic gesture supporting #M4A. At 2:55pm ET, I received a CNN alert that Biden had chosen a VP.
Biden gone fuck this country up üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Joe Biden day one of his Presidency "EVERYONE is fired that was hired under Trump, leave NOW". THEN he vacates the White House while 4 different intelligence agencies and 4 different security companies do a sweep for ALL the surveillance equipment Trump allowed Putin to install.
No, thank you for admitting Biden has mental issues. Trump had the economy going... Stood up to China, while Biden took money from China. Now, In America we can't get Lysol and  91% alcohol, why, because people like Biden cut deals with the Chi-Cons...
Isnt this like getting help from Scott Baio to derail Biden? Why would ANYONE care what kanye or Baio have to say or offer?
Shakura S'Aida "Geechee Woman" Paris 2016  via  Yes Joe Biden picked a geechee woman to be his MVP
A few folks have asked for my stance on Kamala Harris. In all honesty obviously anybody is better than trump. I get that. Biden has my vote. My thing is the people who continue to sit here and praise her all for what? She openly supports a country that has killed innocent people
I‚Äôm absolutely voting for Biden to ensure Trump gets out, but I‚Äôm so fucking sick of America being a country where thousands of people push for change and a better life and politicians just. Don‚Äôt? They just make life awful and that‚Äôs how things are set up here.
I love how people are (rightfully!) pointing out we have to vote for Biden to get trump out and by ‚Äúlove‚Äù I mean ‚ÄúFuck we really are trapped in a country with all the people in power being awful people and actual citizens have no recourse to actually change things‚Äù
I don‚Äôt like it but sometimes politicians do things we don‚Äôt agree with. I don‚Äôt like every single action Trump takes the same way I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt agree with every single action by Biden. That would be like me saying if you vote for Biden you‚Äôre supporting the 94 crime bill.
This election is really sad tbh. I hate how half of my timeline is being bashed for holding Biden and Harris accountable for their past actions while the other half wants to ignore it. I personally think these things need to be discussed.
Y‚Äôall bet not vote for Biden üòíüôÑüôÑüôÑ
Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election  #FoxBusiness
Harris destroyed Biden in a debate and look what happened.
Please copy-paste and distribute widely:  Senators Ron Johnson, Lindsey Graham, and Chuck Grassley are all working actively to spread Russian propaganda through the Senate against Joe Biden.  They should ALL resign NOW.  PASS IT ON.

Biden/Harris is a return to honest government that works for middle America.
Biden‚Äôs sexual assault allegations are probably true. Kamala Harris is like the most predictable pick ever and is about as establishment as you can get. I don‚Äôt think anyone is ecstatic about this. I think most people are just excited that we get to remove fascist Ronald McDonald
I've tried to explain this to Cult 45 members and they just say "well you can't say it's Trump's America. They're deciding to do that". As if Biden will force them to
Woke up today and the first thing I did was check to make sure Biden didn‚Äôt change his campaign slogan to Biden/Harris 2020-I Went Black &amp; I Ain‚Äôt Goin Back. So far so good.
The best thing for Biden is to stay in his basement.
We have decades worth of footage of Biden. We know what his usual speech problems sound like. This is not that.
Now you have to have seen the videos. If not I can send you link after link. Biden is suffering from way worse then just a simple stutter. He‚Äôs clearly no longer able to speak or think at the same level and the decline has been seen over the years to this point.
You honestly think Biden will finish 4 years in office?
Joe Biden thought we said ‚Äúdefend the police‚Äù
Trump is not perfect. But Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt done anything to convince me to vote for him. His policy positions change frequently. He‚Äôs been saying a lot of things about schools and housing but we have no reason to believe he‚Äôll actually do those things. And he has dementia
This sums up the Republican party perfectly: Drunk white guys who are too dumb to understand that, even when he loses, Trump will still be the president until Biden is sworn in the following January.
I cried with tears of joy and elation when i got the text from Joe about you being the VP!!  I also slept better last night than i have in 3.5 years. Biden + Harris = Dream Team!  Pull NO punches when you debate Liar-Pence. OWN HIM and make him regret his choices.
You‚Äôll eat what‚Äôs on your plate and you‚Äôll like it, Biden Harris 2020
No since in trump flirting the idea of replacing pence with a woman. Biden got the top notch and no one of good character would want the job. #AllRoadsLeadToPutin #TrumpEvilPlan #TrumpFailedAmerica #Trumpdeathtoll165k

Kamala Harris: Who is Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate?
Guys guys.... some of y‚Äôall think Biden is ‚Äúsleepy‚Äù because of Trumps hateful rhetoric... maybe it‚Äôs time to look at the facts and also take a serious look at Trumps mental decline.
its y‚Äôall talking about kamala harris like her nd biden aint our only choice fa me
Can't make this crap up....... Well unless you are Joe Biden!
I really think that in the run up to November, Biden-Harris team should announce who their Cabinet nominees would be to show America what a Biden Administration would look like. Make it a weekly event to help keep the buzz elevated.
A little distasteful that Joe Biden would pick Kamala Harris on the day after former WWE wrestler ‚ÄúKamala‚Äù Harris passed away.  It‚Äôs almost like they didn‚Äôt even care.
Biden could have added Jesus of Nazareth to the ticket and Liz Cheney would still tweet this about HIM.
Because of people‚Äôs comments and reaction to Kamala being picked as Biden‚Äôs VP.
Anytime anyone has pushed Biden from the left, his response has been ‚Äúgo vote for someone else.‚Äù I see no evidence that will change when/if he has the power of the presidency.
Its either you vote for Biden and Harris or don'tü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. But don't turn around and complain about Trump üôÑ
Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals  #FoxNews

‚ÄúBiden and Kamala aren‚Äôt any better but we still gotta‚Äî‚Äî‚Äú girllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll. Don‚Äôt tell no grown folks what they need to be doing LMAO you go do what YOU gotta do. Leave me outta this.
Can we please get trump out of office I‚Äôm not for Biden  either but anybody but trump
If Trump don't know that fact, hell look it up.... Google it, general knowledge don't make you smart. Specialize knowledge is everything. Joe Biden, 40 years in Washington, what did he accomplished.
Biden Harris 2020 Marsha Blackburn you are  going down with trump
Never Biden is 4 more years of trump. Y‚Äôall wanna die on the imaginary m4a hill? It‚Äôs not happening in the next 4 years. Your fake candidate ain‚Äôt getting elected. Even if he did, he would be several hundred congresspeople short...
You and me both. Will be great to watch Biden/Harris go down in flames.
Also, I'm not speaking just for myself and my vote. Most progressives feel this way. Most were ready to give Biden a chance, had the VP pick been someone who represented our vaules. A former AG is the exact opposite of that. A real slap in the face during these historic protests.
Not Pop Tarts! Say it ain't so! Are even our Tater Tots safe?   (I'd sacrifice both to get Trump out and Biden in. Must save the Republic!  )
If you don‚Äôt vote, or I see you constantly only slander Biden/Kamala, I‚Äômma just assume you‚Äôre a Trump supporter. Because by definition, you‚Äôre a Trump supporter üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
There‚Äôs no such thing as a perfect presidential candidate or VP. We know Biden &amp; Harris have glaring flaws but we have to do what‚Äôs necessary to rid this nation of Trump. You woke folks gotta deal with the reality of the situation before us NOT what you want it to be
Imagine how salty  will be if Biden ACTUALLY loses too Trump üòÇ ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the twitter content I‚Äôm here for‚Äù
Joe Biden just lost the race. Black folks (the majority) will never vote for Kamala Harris. Been tricked before....
You can tell how badly Trump is doing by how (even more than normal) Mollie and her ‚Äúfriends‚Äù are getting. Notably she hasn‚Äôt had one positive thing to say about Trump. Just mean things about Biden. What a corrupt soul.
The lesser of two evils definitely isn't the side with a guy who's openly racist and pedophilic and who likely has dementia like Biden. Trump has done some great stuff, he locked down the nation due to COVID-19 before it was recommended, for example. Trump is infinitely better.
Yal really think Biden/ Harris will be better than Trump ? ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è No need to comment for debate it‚Äôs rhetorical
If Biden wins she will take over shortly after
She a wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing, her affiliations are irrelevant. Biden picked her for those reasons cuz he knew it‚Äôd be a great distraction. He‚Äôs using his Obama clout and her blackness, ain‚Äôt neither one of em any good but they know we‚Äôre desperate
Biden will get her elected with his white privilege then will bow out cause he‚Äôs intellectually compromised
The "Biden vs.Trump Skydive Fight Video" makes it's debut on Monday, August 31st; so stay tuned and watch to see who wins!!
They could put out a press release saying that Biden Harris support KILLING Mike Fly and I'd STILL vote for them.
Danger!  Now that Kamala Harris is the vice presidential pick it's more than clear that between her and the Democrat party Joe Biden won't even be allowed to pick the color of his tie if elected, let alone lead the Country.
I bet now she won‚Äôt call Biden out for bussing again. I bet she won‚Äôt be called out for the things she did to the black community as California‚Äôs top cop. Time for the MSM to rewrite history.
Let‚Äôs get trump out of here; we‚Äôve seen the shit hole and hatred he‚Äôs created!!! Biden has to win!!!!
Given Joe Biden's condition, I think that Kamala Harris would be the de-facto  president of the United States and between her and the Democrat party Joe Biden won't even be allowed to decide what color tie to wear.
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. Both Biden &amp; Harris are now receiving National Security Daily Briefs? Unlike  they will actually READ them! I‚Äôm feeling safer already.
Black folks have been forced to pick the lesser of 2 evils, since gaining the right to vote. Just say you‚Äôre voting Biden/Harris because Trump has to go, instead of trying to hype them up as two great candidates. They‚Äôre just more competent than Trump/Pence.
Can we all agree that we can find fault with both Biden and Harris? Okay, moving on‚Äîcan we also agree that Biden/Harris will govern America better than Trump/Pence?   Okay, moving on‚Äîlet‚Äôs go work to get them elected....work like they are the big underdogs.
"Vice President Mike Pence just got some very bad news. He‚Äôs going to lose the VP debate this fall, and that loss is going to do serious damage to the already diminished 2020 election prospects of the Republican Party."
Why does the Biden Harris ticket want to kill innocent children by the execution of abortion?
If Joe Biden spent years fighting for us, THEN WHY in all the years he was in Congress he NEVER Passed a Real Debt Free Balanced Budget?  Joe Biden kept America in slavery of debt owned by China.
Why is Biden standing so close to her?
Now that Harris is the VP pick, watch how many times she falsely claims Trump is a racist. The fact that Biden felt beholden to choose a black person is racist.
Biden is the polar opposite of Trump! #BidenHarris2020
Some Progressive Political Activists Are Not Happy That Biden Picked¬†Harris
Joe Biden fought for who???? Not us black people for damn sure.
Biden is a Catholic....
The establishment thought they could will it into happening like they did with Biden.
I went #YangGang to Warren to Biden/Harris because I love America.  I refuse to be a privileged stereotype who complains about the Democratic nominees. I am not going to participate in the Liberal circular firing squad that happens every 4 years.    There is too much at risk!
LIKE I AM LITERALLY CONFUSED YALL MUST WANT TRUMP BACK IN OFFICE THE WAY YALL BUSY BASHING BIDEN/HARRIS -No it‚Äôs not what we want but the other option is TRUMP! SO WHY YALL DISTRACTING AND HALFWAY CONVINCING MORE PPL NOT TO VOTE AT ALL!? Any vote not for Biden is a vote for TRUMP
Kampala is Obama‚Äôs choice. Biden is just his puppet. Harris wasn‚Äôt electable as President. Biden has more potential to win. At least until the debates.
O you have a career in front of you! I lost a bet. I was sure you‚Äôd be the pick. Either way that $100.00 was sent to the Biden campaign! Keep making us proud? Senate or cabinet?
Come ‚ÄùHell or High Water‚Äù regardless of Joe Biden selecting Kamala Harris as his Vice President running mate beware. The Biden-Harris combination remains as a losing ticket, on the November 3 presidential election day.
that being said i‚Äôm obviously still voting biden because i understand the importance of this election and whats at stake if i don‚Äôt
if biden picked bernie as his running mate things would be sexy
Anyone who fails to reelect Trump will aid in the destruction of the American economy &amp; the subjugation of the American people.  If Biden &amp; Reich have their way America will become another 3rd world despotic state in order to move the Earth's temp down by 1 worthless degree!
Joe Biden announced his VP pick, - August 11 - Trump has a 4-hour news conference - sometimes in the VERY near future.
I agree with everything you're saying, don't get me wrong, but how does Biden differ from Trump, when Biden himself has outright said "poor kids can be just as smart as white kids" and trying to police what Blackness actually is with his "ain't Black" remark?
Well it looks like you are insane.
I‚Äôm tired of this with you. I know the importance of voting and how can impact our communities and nation. Without Blacks Obama wouldn‚Äôt be president at all. Without Blacks Biden wouldn‚Äôt be our choice for president. Stop trying to undermine voting. You‚Äôre the problem.
Biden isn‚Äôt a perfect man we know that and our country isn‚Äôt either. But Trump doesn‚Äôt care about minorities nor this country. Biden relates towards Americans, he understands hardship and his mistakes but you can‚Äôt see this and you never will.
I can go all day on policy and why Biden is the best choice for our country. Trump hasn‚Äôt handled this pandemic right nor race relations in this country. For you to hate on Lebron and others for supporting Biden and Kamala shows what side you‚Äôre on.
He‚Äôs the same man that told African American wtf do they have to lose??! He‚Äôs racist against every minority. Yea Biden‚Äôs right after everything he said about BLM and protesters and Charlottesville. Blacks people would be crazy to support Trump. He doesn‚Äôt care about minorities!
Another Joe Biden is right Trump is racist and the first in modern times where his racist rhetoric isn‚Äôt hidden that‚Äôs what he meant but people like you take shit out of context. Listen ! and stop listening to sound bites...
No idea why Biden would pick a person with extensive experience in the criminal justice system when we should be focusing on reforming the criminal justice system.
Not voting is effectively the same as voting for trump.  Not voting for Biden Harris is the same as voting for trump.
Just reading all the great responses to this ridiculous childish garbage made me feel better. So... thanks?  Biden isn't perfect. Kamala isn't perfect. I'm not perfect.  Have you seen trump???  Biden Harris 2020 Biden Harris 2020 Biden Harris 2020!!!  End our national nightmare.
#JoeBidenKamalaHarris  Joe biden &amp; Karen harris.. Portland.. Seattle.. Chicago is waiting...
üëÄ all true and all reasons why nobody is black anymore i guess cos fuck biden and kopmella üñïüèø
One more thing for tonight... systems that Harris defends are the reason people in similar situations to Pervis Payne end up being murdered by the state. I do not support a Biden/Harris ticket.   #FreePervisPayne
The left is confused. Kamala Harris stated that she wants to take away our 2nd amendment rights and up hold the constitution at the same time... It's impossible. How can I trust her. Joe Biden... come on man!!!!
Democrats rejected Kamala Harris during the first month of primaries. Now, knowing Biden won't finish his first term, they're all screaming about how amazing she is for the country.   The Democratic party is a joke.
Biden, what are you doing? Karelia ain‚Äôt black. Come on man!

Token BLACK to pander for the black voter, when she nor Biden will do anything for blacks other than in slave them to goverment dependicies. Same as liberals have been doing for decades. Obama had 40 mill on food stamps, WHY? Control.... control the food, you control the mind.
A white male Bernie supporter really used Charlamagne in an argument with me as a way to try to tell me he knew what Black voters wanted best and why I shouldn‚Äôt support Biden/Harris. At what stage of Bernie fandom does the delusion start to set in? I‚Äôm curious.

This isn‚Äôt about privilege for me. We have to get this bunch out of office. I do think Biden‚Äôs crew can right the ship but then the real work has to begin.
173.9M women in U.S. 2020. Propaganda destroyed Hillary Rodham Clinton‚Äôs chances. Women donate $1.00 TONIGHT to show support for Joe Biden. Men feel free we are in this together! $1 each equal $173.9M women, plus men, exponential!  Donate $1! TONIGHT Link
I was asking lol i just assume people that aren‚Äôt voting Biden are voting trump
Fair point, but: the alternative is far worse. (No, we are not a three-party country, especially in this particular year.) My primary priority is to get rid of the current administration. Biden/Harris, even w/srs imperfections, are far greater than the current team o'jackwagons.

Oh, for sure. I didn't mean forget. Honey, I've let my natural hair color come in after 30+ years, so there's no forgetting this debacle. #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
Biden likely won't make it to 2024, which is the earliest that he even has a chance of getting the presidency.
Does anyone remember that Tulsi endorsed Biden? Does anyone remember that Kamala is now the VP nominee, and Tulsi has literally nothing?
It's very questionable if Biden will make it to 2024, much less 2025 for the inauguration, if he somehow wins the next election that he even has a chance of winning.

Supreme Court of the United States. Trump will get at least one or more picks. Hope you can get some caffeine in ya and get out the vote for Biden this year. 2022-24 will be too late.
Seems like your guy has been using the federal government as his personal plaything. You need to step back, sister, and let the grown - ups handle things. #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
Biden was on the sideline. But now, he‚Äôs taking it to the cup. My piece for Bloomberg
Can we have a mulligan on the last 4 years? Not record it on the official scorecard? #trumpmulligan #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
The Democrats themselves have given Trump all the material he needs to make ad campaigns against Biden and Harris (and in fact, Biden and Harris gave him a lot to use against each other.) It's kind of insane how much Democrats suck at politics at this point in history.
Hard truth. If you are a drama queen about Biden/Harris, please go play in traffic. The republic is in peril and your personal purity test is just not helpful.
If I were them I‚Äôd stop telling ppl that Donald Trump once supported Biden‚Äôs new running mate. That only supports Biden‚Äôs choice far as I‚Äôm concerned. I mean ... even Trump liked her. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èDuh
Also, are there no places for women in the new hypothetical Biden world?
#Trump: #Biden Is Insulting Men Everywhere by Picking Woman as Running Mate.  That's because Trump is scared of strong, smart women.  He only likes dumb blondes with stripper names.  #BidenHarris2020 #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt
You and your criminal syndicate family are going to face so many criminal indictments. I can see why you're petrified. Better enjoy your freedom while you can because Biden will not be giving you a pardon. #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
‚ÄúI‚Äôd be comfortable drinking with Joe Biden and also comfortable with him warmingly embracing my daughter while sniffing her hair‚Äù said the white man
She could have just endorsed Bernie when the establishment backed Biden. Bernie/Warren would have won. But now, we have a cop and a racist. Exciting.

Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
I had the opportunity to see all the democratic presidential candidates last summer and it was such a great experience. Looking forward to voting for Biden/Harris in November. üëèüèΩ
If you are going to vote for Trump just say that‚Ä¶ stop trying to cover it up with all the ‚ÄúBiden and Kamala are racist too‚Äù rhetoric üôÑ it‚Äôs dumb.
I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable at all around a drunk Biden
Me finding out that Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs choice for VP:
you called Biden out as a racistist, now you are his slave so he can win the black vote. Selling your soul to the devil aren‚Äôt ya? Power is more important than having a soul right? Balcks, you have your token black running so go be sheep and vote accordingly, looser
I understand the frustration people who feel as if voting for Biden-Harris isn‚Äôt going to do much towards furthering the interests of Black people. I am one of those people. HOWEVER, the *other* candidate is Trump. It sucks, but it really is that simple.
If you‚Äôre not a troll you are clearly a butt-hurt Bernie bro. By choosing not to vote you choose fascism, racism and sexism for this country. I do think this country is worth saving. Biden admits his mistakes. Trump is a big whiny baby. You sound like him.
Trump can't win if Latinos turn out in large numbers for Biden. Period.
Trump and Biden should each take a history test.  We know Trump would fail it‚ÄºÔ∏è
When the Harris nomination came across the TV, I broke down and cried. Not because she was my first choice (she wasn‚Äôt) but because after nearly 4 yrs of abuse from  , we FINALLY have a strong ticket to elect Biden for president. #BidenHarris2020 I‚Äôm thrilled!
Already starting the messaging ‚Äúif biden steps down‚Äù.
Willing to ‚Äústep in when and if Biden decides to step aside‚Äù like that very night.  I‚Äôm hoping she won‚Äôt get that chance.
This is hilarious. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are NOT radical leftists by any stretch of the imagination.
I agree that the country could‚Äôve done better than Biden-Harris and that they probably will not enact policies that will jumpstart the systemic changes our country needs. But sadly, the current president is an orange goblin who wants the US to sink even further into Hell.
Did Biden get excommunicated while I wasn't looking?
The DNC picked Kamala Harris‚Äîa former cop who helped enforce the racist crime bill Biden helped write‚Äîover Elizabeth Warren? Pandering to BICPOC with a BIPOC candidate who is harmful to BIPOC communities ain't it.
Biden pick Harris finally good news in 2020!
Is this one of my crushes supporting Biden and Harris?? Yepppppppp
I would take Kamala over any of the Dem VP candidates from the past 30 years, with the possible exception of Al Gore: Caine, Biden, John Edwards, Joe Lieberman.
Did #MotherPence give you the special dessert tonight? #BidenHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP #Biden #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Keep wasting your time barking up this tree. Black folks know and trust Joe Biden, and he won't let them down.
Careful, #GymJordan. Your fear is showing. #BidenHarris2020 #BidenVP #KamalaHarrisForVP #Biden #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I have no recollection of when Tim Kaine joined the Clinton ticket, or when Joe Biden joined the Obama ticket, or when John Edwards joined the John Kerry campaign, or when Joe Lieberman joined the Gore ticket.  But I'll remember this one. #BidenHarris2020
Wonder if Biden is going to apologize to Harris now?
All hands on deck, huh? The GOP JV got called out to bash Biden/Harris. You're right that she won't increase black turnout because Biden is getting a 95-5 number anyway and your boy, the racist, has made those folks really angry. "What have you go to lose"? For GOP...everything.
Perfect! Thanks for your support! #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
Do you think Biden picked based on hair smell?
I am so excited to witness  being the VP ticket for Joe Biden. This is something magical.
Biden thinking he can get the black vote without taking our policy demands seriously is shameful. Picking a black women vp just to woo black voters is too.
üí• I think Biden and Harris‚Äôs theme song should be the jaws theme song cos they are coming for trump and his swamp monsters   ü¶à Duunnn Dunnn Duuuunnnn ü¶à   #BidenHarris2020
Good!! I will stop work if Biden is elected - no tax money for your administration!!
I guess Biden is just mature enough to do what‚Äôs best for the country than be petty.
Not voting for trump is a vote for Biden/Harris to then right?
Proud to say my friend  and I called the Biden/Harris ticket way back before the Democratic nomination was even close to being decided in January! All you had to do was apply common sense to know this was the ticket that would win!
So excited! What a fantastic team! #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
The billionaires people have spent months complaining about getting richer during the pandemic want Biden to win just as badly as you do. Think for a sec if Trump was really helping them like you say he is why would Wall Street be literally cheering for Biden? Y‚Äôall are hilarious
the way biden kept teasing everyone like "sign up for our news letter to be the first to find out who my running mate will be üòõ" as if literally everyone didn't already know it was going to be kamila harris lmfao
I'm very confused by this tweet. What VP could Biden (his handlers) have picked that would have cost Trump the Victory? None exists! Just another day closer to #Trump2020
Never Biden means 4 more years of #TraitorTrump  So get in line. Mind your manners. Swallow the jagged pill. Keep working after Biden is elected.

This is wrong. He said himself that he's deliberately trying to take votes from worthy opponent Biden/Harris. I hope it backfires and makes Trump lose votes.
I know someone that refuses to vote for Biden|Harris (I don‚Äôt blame him) but he said he wouldn‚Äôt vote. So I called him a Trump supporter &amp; he got mad at me. I don‚Äôt get it

Biden has stated that he is a one term president and that his VP pick would be handed the keys basically so I thinks it‚Äôs Kamala‚Äôs turn to represent moderate dems in 2024 regardless. It may be a long shot but electorally I do not see any other option
Trump/Pence-‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù Biden/Harris-‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Touch My Hair!‚Äù Trump/Pence-‚Äú..ok I like theirs better‚Äù
I feel like if you voting for biden, just keep it to yourself at this point... ur embarassing yo self mane
Get over it. Biden did.
Tonight Trump accused Biden of treason and mentioned execution. Bad move on his part. he might find himself in that position one day.
They could‚Äôve PICKED ANYONE ELSE!! But diddy and ten other lame ass muthufuckas pesuaded these folks to let this bitch run with biden? And blCk ppl are SOAKING IT UP LIKE ITS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more so to replace Trump, endure Biden,  organize within DSA, and then vote AOC for 2024
Why is there annoying scream of Harris and Biden in the middle of my Twitter feed? Haven‚Äôt seen that for Trump.
Democratic Party sets rules for criticizing Biden's VP pick Kamala Harris
Lmaoooo but y‚Äôall make sure to vote for biden tho!!!!
Meh,  Harris called Biden a  racist.
Based on what Trump tweeted after the announcement. They are falling back on the typical ‚ÄúRadical Left‚Äù rhetoric with Kamala. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anything new than what Trump has been trying to paint Biden as. So I‚Äôm not too worried about it so much with Kamala
Will someone tell me why Bunker Biden is at the top of my Twitter feed?
Good. Biden went to UDel &amp; Syracuse. Harris to Howard &amp; UC Hastings. Not only are they representative of the country, but they know the power of a public education. And having an #HBCU grad as VP would hopefully bring support to #MinorityServingInstitutions! #HigherEd #SAPro

Kudos for telling it like it really is.  Vote Biden/Harris.
Vote Biden because he isn‚Äôt Trump
This is about more than just a GOTDAMN VP pick! There are fucking Supreme Court seats at stake! Our livelihoods, our safety!!!! And y'all worried about a fucking VP pick cause you don't like Biden? Man, fuck y'all!
So where can I get my Biden/Harris sign?
they REALLY, REALLY don't want Biden to debate Trump because they know it will be a disaster!!!
I'm not the one putting lofty ideals above real human suffering and death. I'm not the one throwing a protracted bitch fit because my candidate didn't win the nomination. Biden wasn't my 1st or 2nd choice but by god I will choose him over Trump!
The amount people that don't seem to realize how bad an idea it is for Kamala Harris to be VP, especially alongside Joe Biden, proves that people really don't do research or pay attention.  I'm still voting for them, but man this sucks. #BidenVP
She not young enough for Biden....
Should be ‚ÄúTulsi destroyed Biden‚Äôs VP pick‚Äù
Hold up...that excuses valid points...and the over whelming majority of the population hasn‚Äôt ignored what Trumps record. To be clear tho Trump basically hurt a lot of people‚Äôs feelings, and more. But Harris/Biden...that‚Äôs some next level shit
See I don‚Äôt blame Biden because no doubt it would be a tough decision for me too. Me personally I would‚Äôve picked someone like a Karen Bass, a congresswoman with roots in anti-police activism, has sympathies with the Left of the party, and is the chair of the Black Caucus
Deadass not gon lie, dead ass hope biden loses. Dead ass i hate trump but he‚Äôll get his.
If I were to concede the point, I'd say something about Hillary Clinton receiving similar treatment 4 years prior, leading to her "losing" even with 3 million more votes.  Can we object to Biden's flaws (which I freely admit he has) without treating him like dogshit?
Never Biden, Never Cop
2020 is year of unprecedented challenges. We need Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They can help put us on the path to recovery, end the name-calling and division-as-strategy, and bring dignity and integrity to public service. #BidenHarris

I guess the white supremacist rubes he keeps riled up never figured this out. trump never did jack shit for the economy other than tank the Obama/Biden economy that was handed to him. All he had to do was form a plan to deal with the virus like the rest of the civilized world.
Wall street clients must be really fucking dumb if they needed assurances biden wouldn‚Äôt go left lmao
No one cares. We‚Äôre too busy celebrating a Biden/Harris ticket.

I bought some Biden/Harris merch during that time frame and the site kept crashing - figured it was high traffic. Happy to see this.
Fairly certain Biden thinks he got a new caregiver today
if she wants me to vote for her and  biden, she has to pass this :)
Hang in there, we‚Äôre gonna get there. IMO It‚Äôs better to elect Biden and have a seat at the table to advocate for M4A. It‚Äôs even better to send him with a fully Dem congress. We can make huge progress on lots of things including health care.
But the same thing happened to Biden... people drop out but I am not sure why that is a huge negative...

Yay order for a few BIDEN Harris items and a small donation finally placed! And the champagne is open and bubbling!

Joe Biden is a fraud lmao
It doesn‚Äôt matter to me who he picked. My vote goes to Biden.
Kamala Harris was the worst choice Biden could have made. Race and gender are irrelevant - she's  a political fraud and everyone knows it.
Y‚Äôall ass ain‚Äôt vote for Bernie Sanders now look..stuck with Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris üòíüòíüòí
every day joe biden pisses me off more and he knows he can because he knows most leftists know they have to settle for him
Not the biggest Biden fan but love his VP choice. Will balance things out for me personally and it bodes well for the future if he wins!
Idk how much you Don't like Biden. We gotta get Trump out
There is a struggle between surface level identity politics and real substantive transformational justice within the Democratic Party and Biden sided with the former as expected. Kamala has many deep faults that should be critiqued, but tearing down a Black Woman isn‚Äôt the way
I love M4A, but we‚Äôve got bigger fish to fry right now - like booting the sitting Prez and saving democracy. I‚Äôll take that plus Biden‚Äôs plan to get us up to about 97% health coverage for now. Then as Millennials and Zoomers come into power we‚Äôll have a big coalition for M4A.
All you're doing is making me want to vote for Biden even more than I already did. So, thanks?
joe biden seent kamala n thought it would make black ppl wanna vote for him even more but like a pedophile n a cop vice president whats hannaninnn
Sad is a Biden/ facelift supporter
