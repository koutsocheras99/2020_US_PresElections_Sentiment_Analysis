Trump has done immeasurable damage to the GOP for years to come, with the aid of the GOP to boot.
And Calabresi didn’t, for example, say that if Trump’s attacks on the election continue or worsen, his fellow travelers should consider voting for Biden. It is cheap, empty talk.
DEFENDER OF AMERICA!! God raised up Trump to save America from the leftists Marxist Communists trying to overthrow our nation.
You don't have to worry about Trump.
Obama followed a clemency policy aimed at relatively low-level offenders &amp; relied on Justice Department recommendations.  Trump has largely acted outside the normal review process, most recently giving clemency to high-profile white-collar criminals.

Although it is customary for the sitting president to give a eulogy at a former president's funeral, Bush said a "lucky circumstance" kept Trump from speaking.  "He had a lucky circumstance there because 43 (George W. Bush) was his son, so he did the eulogy,"
Whenever Trump reads something that he DIDN’T write, his face looks as if he’s holding back the biggest belly laugh.
Please see specifically the method of counting, not validation.  Trump's dream is to suppress.  He has zero other recourse.  The media is trapping people.
Did anyone think Trump could delay the election? You know Trump was only thinking of himself.
Biden didnt do shit in those years of experience except pass &amp; defend racist ass laws. Trump has buisness experience which helps out alot but anyways. I dont think you need political experience to be a decent candidate
And he sacrificed his life for Donald Trump's ego and vanity project. He attended Trump's Tulsa rally, didn't wear a mask or social distance and 9 days later he was in the hospital with COVID.

Hey guys, the economy contracted by 33% in the 2nd quarter. An unheard of number even in the worst economies in history. Trump's depends on the myth of "his good economy" holding up. So he flashes the shiniest object imaginable and the press and social media run with it all day.
And after all that Donald Trump was still able to kill him

Trump still has Barr to help throw out mail in ballots delayed on purpose by his USPS Cronie. Barr has already implied that. What are democrats in congress doing to avert that.
Without an election, trump will still be without a job on 1/20/21.  Pelosi would then take the reigns.
Or just calculation and cynicism. The Federalist Society is proto-fascist. If Trump was popular, Calabresi wouldn’t care.
I almost forgot about those liability waivers Trump had people sign for his COVID rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
I figured that, once the judicial vacancies were filled, the conservative legal movement would start distancing itself from Trump.

Anyone who isn't a Sheep,  LOVES TRUMP!
So when Biden says something idiotic, it's a joke or a misquote, according to the left, &amp; evidence of mental or physical illness to the right. And when Trump does the same it is a stroke to his foes &amp; 4 dimensional chess to his sycophants. I just think they're both dumb.

Yeah I love dunking on Trump and have no problem with people highlighting the rally. But someone that was as proudly anti-mask as Cain seemed to be was likely going out and doing other unsafe stuff. So I just wouldn't state it as fact that he got it at the rally.
Of course, the Criminal In Chief. Gave all the desperately need funds. To contributors, to Trump Campaign. Now, the states are fending for themselves. Hospital's, have no PPE's, or ventilators. Test sites, are far &amp; in between. Results take two weeks. Business is non existent.
Wouldn't it be fitting for Trump to be charged with Herman Cain's murder? Authorities told him his fascist rally wasn't safe. But that evil freak only cares about himself. Yes, Cain was a schmuck, but he is symbolic of the thousands Trump has MURDERED. #TrumpKillsUS #LockHimUp
Glad to see Trump didn't attend that over hyped talent show for Lewis today.  If you don't like someone when they are alive... don't be a douche bag and pretend you like them when they are dead. #JohnLewisMemorial
By calling Trump names and their deranged reaction the left is proving to everyone that it’s safe to go vote in person 😂
Here is the question. How many are going to die,before a higher authority.Steps in, to stop the out of control pandemic.Can we say,a cool million.Trump is a blatant racist, &amp; divider.He has helped the Corrupt Republicans. Give massive tax cuts, to the wealthy.85%stimulus to Banks
It must kill him to know that NO ONE will mourn him when he passes. I bet dollars to donuts that Melanie will have him cremated and fight to give away his ashes!! So Trump.. 👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾

He was the owner of a pizza company hardly a comparison can be made between Cain and Lewis. If trump wants to give him a federal funeral have Cain lie in state in the family quarters of the White House. After all it was trump's virus caught at a trump rally that killed him.

Like it’s insane to think about. It’s not like they went from being Romney supporters to trump supporters, it’s a completely different sect of people. Especially the ones who never gave a fuck about politics before trump.
No, this isn’t Trump’s America. This belongs to the Mayors and Governors that refuse to restore order and the rule of law!
What a petty little man trump is.
that new weekly unemployment claims also rose last week. It was the 19th straight week in which initial claims totaled at least 1 million — indicating that the recovery Trump has long promised is not happening.  That’s REALITY. And WS needs to wake up to reality.

Had Trump promoted masks, Cain would have worn one. Everyone would, and this might be over.
As a #Democrat, I am here to say that we must bring our party back to our core values to defeat Trump and the rise of extremism. We need to be of, by, and for the people. We need #DownBallotProgressives who advocate for people not corporate donors.

Mailing ballots are not a problem.  Look, we get our passports by mail, government checks by mail, drivers licenses by mail.  Mailing ballots only became an issue because Trump decided to make it one.
Uh, wrong 🙄 He’s still doing what he did for Trump in 2016. He’s just not the campaign manager. Best decision. Gotta let Brad be Brad 🤗
Even if the date of the election is changed, the US Constitution stipulates that the term of the election is limited to four years for the president and cabinet. So, having assumed the office on January 20, 2017, Donald Trump must vacate it no later than January 20, 2021.
Still waiting for you to keep your word on those 50+ Subpoenas Lindsey. We are re-electing President Trump.

Herman Cain went to trump rally on 6/20/2020 proudly not wearing a mask or distancing. He tested positive on 6/29/2020.  He died today of COVID-19.  THE SOONER WE ALL WEAR MASKS, THE SOONER WE CAN ALL TAKE THEM OFF.  GROW UP DENIERS.
There was an article in Newsweek regarding elections. Trump would declare a National emergency of some sort...? I feel like I am swimming in the ocean during a major hurricane, a few miles out.

lol..... Insecurity and ignorance sucks huh???....   The bright side is trump became president so there is hope for you yet!!!
Must be watch TV and tweet time on the Presidents schedule. All the other living past presidents will be honoring a man at his funeral. Trump must be beside himself!
Even if Guy got pushback for flying a trump flag it’s no reason to violate policy and promote his business. You are one corrupt...
Hispanics for Trump 2020
We can all agree that it was idiotic, selfish, reckless, etc. for Trump to hold that Tulsa rally, let alone do so w/o mask/social distancing requirements. However, we'll never know for a fact if that is where Herman Cain contracted it, and people are acting like that's the case.
RIP Herman Cain. It's a shame that you listened to Donald Trump instead of science. #Coronapalooza Never forget.
THE MONEY IT'S COST AMERICANS FOR THIS FARCE MAKES ME SICK TO THINK ABOUT IT. IT COULD HAVE HELPED SO MANY AND DONE SO MUCH MORE FOR SO MANY! THE TRUMP'S ARE SELFISH GRIFTERS AND IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THE CAST OF CHARACTERS!

Dear President Trump, please take action and take out CCP snake heads before they launch another virus attack on human being
Local news outlet’s ‘mail-in voting experiment’ catches Trump’s eye, and yields troubling results
is the latest example of  throw away loyalty policy. He fought masks to engraciate trump, now that hes infected, trump tosses him to the side. Sadly he has pulled his staff along for the ride.
😂 Trump is the democrat antidote
Like at least people who swing left have multiple politicians they see fit for the job. You literally think trump is the end all be all for the Conservative party which you’ll never see a candidate like trump again on that side because even his own party hates him
They should &amp; it’s to late to change. Their actions or inaction in office speak for them. They have their cult base &amp; that’s it! Trump’s a loose cannon that GOP &amp; Executive Staff cannot control. His narcissistic behaviors prove Trump’s mentally unfit to be President.
I wanna know what trump supporters are gonna do once he is out of office whether it’s now or in 4 years? Your entire personality is tied to a single human who has at most 4 years left in power. What will they become next?
CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR THE DAY WHEN WE DON'T AWAKEN HEARING THE NAME TRUMP FIRST THING. ENOUGH ALREADY. IT'LL MEAN NOTHING. PLEASE LET'S GET BACK TO MAKING AMERICA WORK FOR ALL PEOPLE AGAIN.
The science has been all over the place.  Is Trump a scientist or do you think he listens to the scientists around him?  Your TDS makes you stupid.
Trump throws out delaying 2020 election until Americans can ‘safely’ vote, sends Twitter into tailspin
No Trump we’ll not delay! If you believe this election to have security issues then put together a Bipartisan task force to investigate voting precincts across the country. Verify that the election laws of that state &amp; our rights to vote are not infringed upon. Do your JOB!
It’s truly beyond me how Trump didn’t pay his respects to John Lewis.  All the other (real) Presidents are there.   I’m speechless. #RIPJohnLewis
Hey Sparky, Who counted the in-person votes from the 2016 election? Thanks for the info...Putin "put in" the right number of votes to elect Trump. Mail in voting is harder to tamper with. Thanks for the clarification. #JoeBiden2020 #Biden2020 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

have those people sitting with him been felled? what a mess - trump is killing his own people as well as the rest of us
I THINK TRUMP'S LOST HIS MIND!
Thank you for proving again that he didn't call the virus a hoax.  February 28th we had no idea about this virus.  Pelosi was telling people to go to China Town.  Cuomo was telling people to go to the movies.  Trump was implementing travel bans.  Wake up.
No one is attacking him and praising his death. It’s just ironic that Trump claimed this whole thing was a hoax and something curable by Hydroxychlorocline and disinfectants. His death is an indictment of Trump and his outrageous lies.
"defending the rule of law".🤔  Trump is suggesting to change the law.  A law passed in 1845 specifies that the presidential election date!  Seriously?

This claim has been thoroughly debunked, yet TDS idiots like you keep pushing it. Trump referred to the Dems politicking on the virus as a hoax, not the virus itself.
98% of our representatives including you Trump are an EMBARRASSMENT!!
And now he's dead. His Twitter feed is an endless nasty rant against Democrats. He was a nasty partisan, probably self (Black)-loathing, and he paid dearly for his sycophancy to Trump. Who's using Black people, Mr. Cain? A favorite theme of his to attack Dems. #HermanCain #karma
I can’t believe Trump didn’t pay his respects to John Lewis.   Im watching to hear Obama speak. I need to hear from my Presdient today.   I can’t wait until Trump dies. Let’s just throw him into a mass grave with the 150,000 Americans he killed.
Trump aided in killing people with his arrogance in insisting that masks weren't necessary and his obediant followers listened. Look where it got this man...
Using Trump and fortitude in the same sentence is a clear indication that this tweet should be banned immediately. #BoneSpurs
We could call it Covfefe  Oh my god, Trump knew all along! Surely the Qultists will jump on this... it all adds up!
Congrats that you made up totally false numbers and didn't exaggerate so much that even the racist Trump followers would disregard it. #Fascism

You people just waking up need to do your research. The only reason this is even being brought to light is because Trump is President. And by the way, Obama covered this up to protect himself and Killary
I am sorry for the loss of Herman Cain and his family. You never want to see this happen to anyone🙏🙏🙏🙏.Mr Trump you have no regard for anyone’s life. Now you have lost one on you side and for inviting him to a rally. JSMH.
Trump and Q are partly responsible for Herman Cain's death. Trump waited 4 months to tell people to wear their masks and the Qult of Q keep pushing their conspiracy theories. If Herman had worn a mask, he'd probably still be alive- all of the evidence shows it
Trump won’t go near his funeral. He would  not want to be associated with any reflection or reminder of his incompetence.  Next he’ll say, “ I hardly knew the guy”.
Trump hints at delaying November election over claims of mail-in voting fraud
G.D.P. drops by the biggest percentage on record.  Trump (15 minutes later): “Maybe we should delay the election”  Media &amp; Twitterverse:
Deploying American troops out of Germany not only contrary to U.S. security interests but driven by Trump's pique over Merkel and his signature politics of spite.
They told the states they had to get their own, then they seized it straight from the ports as it was delivered.  Put it into the Fed. stockpile “Jared’s stockpile” then asked the govs to beg and show gratitude. All so Trump could say “My administration provided..”.
Herman Cain is dead from Covid-19. He attended the Tulsa rally with no mask. #Trump #BloodOnHisHands #TrumpVirusCatastrophe #HermanCain #TulsaRally
How that Trump Rally work for ya😂😂😂😂? Jango dies on the The Day a Hero John Lewis is laid to Rest.
Trump killed Herman Cain.
Save lives.  Blame trump.  Don't let this death be in vain.  cowering from the grave before trumps incompetence.  do the right thins.
The #COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the construction industry. Tell Congress and President Trump to include significant construction investment for transportation, schools, water, and broadband infrastructure in relief legislation.

Guess we’re getting a potential category 1 Hurricane this weekend. So it’s pretty much a Trump. A bit of wind and rain but will do pretty much nothing.
Then, all states should have early voting &amp; there shouldn't be voting suppression. In the mist of a global pandemic people shouldn't stand in line hours on end to vote. There's no arguing that President Trump is the President of the USA.

Constitutionally correct. My caveat is Trump could care less what our Constitution requires. Who is going to enforce the Constitution?

I’m keeping with my John Lewis groove. No Trump today.
Always in business' pocket. You're also silent while Trump caters to Putin's campaign against American soldiers.  When are you going to condemn the long standing Miami tradition of human trafficking from Cuba? You could be so much better but choose the safer low road.

I sincerely hope they don’t suffer the same fate Cain did after attending a Trump rally.
Thats silly. I understand you might be conservative and certain policies from liberals might seem threatening to your faith, but Thats a different discussion. Trump is using your faith as a tool to stay in power, and using what you stand for in vain, for votes. Which is worse?
I suppose the all out asut on this drug goes well beyond Trump. I fear science won’t even be able to settle the issue. As I’ve learned from you the design and analysis of any study will be flawed are we doomed?
Trump hasn’t even been mentioned or referenced at any of these funerals. That they seem so anti-Trump means that Trump is the antithesis of everything these public servants stood for - from McCain, to Bush Sr to John Lewis.
America is being torched by social 🇨🇳media.. Like   These are the platforms that are not allowing you to speak your mind if they disagree with you. I really and truly believe in the silent majority. We are here🇺🇸 Trump 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
But where is Barr, DOJ and Director Wray on this? Trump needs to replace Wray before November or he does not stand a chance of winning.
That’s how Trump gets away with all of his crimes… signed Legal documents.
And please remind me why Trump is not there, oh waxing Millenial.   Oh right, it’s because he is a sociopath. So much so that a sitting president of the United States would not be at such an important funeral.
Trump actually thinks that he is this powerful dictator who can impose his will on America &amp; Americans! This November, let’s let trump know who is in charge! Vote him out en mass and send the bigoted racist packing out of the people’s WH!
I’m asking Donald Trump you fired this Anthony Fauci,for the sake of this country .
Everything connected with trump, dies!
Nah. That’s what you need to be a trump supporter.
Why do they have to run away? Why can’t they have the backbone to condemn an illiberal, anti-American statement on the spot and break with Trump on this?

Wow! Herman Cain has passed away from coronavirus! Very sad. RIP.  Please, even tRump COVID-19 deniers, wear a mask to protect yourself and others.  This sh*t does not have to happen!!
He didn’t “die because he went to a trump rally.” He was presymptomatic **and went to a trump rally and is now dead. ** Which means there might be a bunch of people who die because they went to a trump rally and shook hands with Herman Cain.
maxine waters said she is afraid trump won’t leave the white house if he loses the election... and i think she right
Eating a meal right before swimming is “not a particularly good idea”  What Trump suggested was illiberal, authoritarian, and anti-American.

I beginning to think why we’ve seen no justice for Trump and America is most if not all the law makers have dirt on each other and to afraid to go after anybody.  Most if not all are guilty of something and that could be the #1 reason no one ever suffers the consequences

You literally just ignored every single argument they mare ti every screenshot that you posted in bad faith and then proceeded to make your original argument as if nothing happened. These same Trump supporters wonder why regular people think that they’re mentally challenged.
So the whole point of this exchange is that you hate Trump and anyone who is successful.   Also...you’re a shitty “debate assassin”.   But I already knew that.  Good night.  Some us have to work all day tomorrow to pay for your free shit.
My young Masonic Hathaway experiences on Florida college campus as a teen reefer addict revolting me when my mother went bankrupt for my drug rehab.  Trump is losing in the polls.  No worries, we’ll strike from the heritage
I have personally petitioned Trump myself on several causes, bypassing Puerto Rico’s Resident Commissioner and Speaker of the House to my own causes like a proper Sith Lord
Harris sent many African Americans (some innocent) to jail for non violent crimes. Whereas Trump signed into law criminal justice reform. Can’t really predict if that factors into November but that’s the argument.
Did you expect Dump Trump to have a heart . Maybe if it were David Duke , you know he would be front and center !

Why is everybody so sorry about Herman Cain?   He knew the risks and his underlying condition and he STILL chose to go to a trump ego rally with NO mask surrounded by other anti maskers.  I feel no sympathy whatsoever. If that makes me a bad person, then i'm bad. 🤷‍♀️

There were 5 (FIVE) Trump bumper stickers on a car in front of me today but this is Florida.
#2) USA Trump policy is to weaken Russian influence and economy by disrupting their primary source of income... Oil &amp; Gas.  Trump is 1st President to export our abundant natural gas overseas... and specifically to Poland. Poland 'was' dependent on gas from Russia.  Not anymore!
#1) Here the point: Trump Administration has been pushing Germany to stop building new multi-billion $ OIL &amp; GAS pipeline infrastructure into Russia.  Russia already uses it energy resources to Bully all EU neighbors (that we protect) and Germany is helping them by undercut USA.
Yet another commercial from mr. trump. But yet another day of avoiding the horrific place we are with the pandemic.  150000 have lost their lives and not a mention.
Got my vote by mail packet for the primary. So I am officially registered to vote Trump out of office by mail
Good on you, Matt. Seen too many people on here gloating about his death because he attended a Trump rally.
I’m hoping he has good people that will undo all the 💩 trump did. I’ll be happy with that and maybe they can sneak in a M4A
Is this a trump election tweet a deflection for crossing the 150,000 covid-19 deaths? For yesterdays AG embarrassment? Is Maxwell going to name trump as a pedophile? Stay tuned...
THIS IS TOTAL BULLSHIT. THIS GUY IS A BULLY HE KNOW HE IS GOING TO LOSE. MR. TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE RUSSIA TO HELP HIM. If we had GENERAL ELECTION NEXT TUESDAY Mr. Trump would lose everything.
Daily Caller Experienced Google Suppression, Says Editor in Chief  via   I noticed quite some time ago when I searched for anything about Trump’s accomplishments nothing showed up or I had to scroll dozens of pages for limited hits. #book burn
Any idea which news item Trump is trying to obscure with the stupid bullshit about election delays?  1. 32.9% economic contraction  2. Swann interview on Russian bounties 3. John Lewis funeral  My guess is the funeral. He views his absence as a slight, and the attendees a threat.
Shocking. Sobering. Is that what President Trump meant by American carnage?
Based on his post-Trump verbal diarrhea, I have serious doubts about how sincerely "pro-life" French is or has been. I suspect he saw it merely as another opportunity to grift, as so many of his NT pals have demonstrated how they saw it.
Delay of the election is the only way for sure, 100%, that Donald Trump isn’t President past 1/20/2021. He’s bluffing. I call.
Same old, same old that gave us the tRUMP types. There is virtually no  programmatic option that works in practice. Time to stop pretending each side is equally valuable. Tech is proving that bothsideism is damaging. I like some conservatives as ppl but not their wrongdoings.

People are idiots . My one day l had to visit Mackinac Island was the same day VP Pence had a rally. So many trump signs I thought I would vomit. But did meet a trumper that I had an intelligent discussion with. So out of many trump supporters at least one has a brain

None of this is a joke! It's unfathomable to me how anyone could possibly think that ANY amount of deaths from #COVID19 are acceptable when all Trump had to do was declare it as serious &amp; call for all Americans to stay home, wear a mask&amp; social distance if they HAD to go out! GFY

You know, Chris, we honestly try to listen to what you say. But every time we get nothing. Situations are good/not good. Pro Biden/Anti Trump. Anti Trump/pro Biden.
God Bless the unions and the teachers for having the intelligence to realize that is the right thing to do.  Florida already filed lawsuits to stop our terrible Gov from killing kids for trump.  We had our highest death count yesterday and hospitalizations are through the roof.
Just another idiotic statement made by a racist, brainwashed Karen. Stop watching Fox it's turning your reality upside down and backwards. Yes, Trump did say correctly  "Can we inject people with bleach"?  He is unable to acknowledge the enormity of the loss of lives from Covid
Trump won't even bring up the subject when talking to Putin? Wow.
Exactly ! I hope someone on his team has kept a damn list of all the 💩 trump has done so they can be undone. Wish we could undo Kavanaugh.

You Democrats did let him to respond to any questions.  He had to talk over the so called questions.  It was all about the Democrats on TV to get there Points across.  It wasn’t about getting the truth out.  It was like we are going to hang Bill Barr and the Trump administration.
The tRUMP is an idiot on every front. Period.
Brexit is a UK FU because of their tRUMP foolishness. Immigration is a global militaristic problem way bigger than EU. And trade has been very successful inside EU. That US conservatives are jealous is not the EU's issue.
Presumptive of us eliminating the tRUMP for sure. The EU is a model for the most successful multinational cooperative agreement in his/herstory. Why wouldn't the US follow the lead of proven accomplishments?

Good grief Andrew... we will still have 24,000+ military personnel in Germany.  Why must we continue to keep a 40,000 troop presence in Germany?  Poland is building a first class military base for the USA and Trump wants to expand our presence there.

I put up articles about this last week.  They insinuated trump had pushed his hotel in DC and the FBI bldg all along since his administration began.  It has been in the news over the years many times.  And he was told to knock off the crap by investigators.  But here it is again!
They all bought stock in it especially Trump.
trump halted briefings after he told people to inject bleach and put a light inside their bodies to stop covid.  Now he is promoting alien DNA, incubus and succubus, don't wear a mask, there is a cure, demon sperm, sex with demons lady.  Why did the R Senate conspire to keep him?
I think they have said that, several times, loud and clear.  They want every single trump enabler gone.    That is their mission and they are proud of it.
Focus on the Russian bounties. Make trump defend his position. Do not let him deflect.

So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you’re proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain’s death was a result of YOUR negligence.

Obama’s eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.

WOW! what a service #JohnLewisMemorial . What I am curious to know is why Trump was not at the services? As a leader of this country he should have been there.

Makes you wonder what President Trump is actually up to doesn’t it? I trust
And nobody knew it until “Professor” Trump told us.
And trump doesn't care because he has no soul!
Trump is a sad little man. Probably upset because absolutely no one wanted him there today. #PettyAsFuck
I highly doubt that! This right here is what the Democratic Party has become. Vote them all out!  🇱🇷TRUMP 2020🇱🇷
"I wish her well, frankly."  Here’s Every Time Donald Trump And Ghislaine Maxwell Have Been Photographed Together
What bothrs me is this, like everythig else Trump does, lying, cheatg, ppl he appointd all do whatevr he says evn if it sounds like it shd be against the law.  I don't undrstand how he can get away with all this garbage, including bringing other countries into our elections
bush's global kill count is many times higher than trump's. if you have this view you care more about trump not asking nicely than what he's actually doing
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally. No mask. No social distancing. Likely contracted COVID because he stupidly follow Donald Trump. #TrumpKilledHermanCain #TrumpKillsUS
Trump has mishandled crises, 150,000 of our fellow Americans are dead, we continue to grapple with systematic racism &amp; we have a careless BIGOT who could not care less if things got worse because he’s making them worse. Let us listen to Obama and VOTE!!!! VOTE EVERY ENABLER OUT!
Here's when it will really be fun: When an intrepid reporter asks Mad King Trump, "So, what did you think of President Obama's remarks at John Lewis' funeral?"
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally. No mask. No social distancing. Very likely contracted COVID by foolishly following you...Blood on your hand!!!
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
Did anyone put a clock on how long it took Mad King Trump to mention John Lewis after his death?
Given the way he's running his campaign, you have to wonder:  What does the President have on Donald J. Trump?
Donald Trump.
You have to keep in mind that Trump's biggest supporters are Nazis &amp; white supremacists.  These people love his racism.  He's one of them.  Has anyone ever checked his closet for his white hood &amp; robe?
No it’s in the constitution that both houses must approve it first.  The spanish flu was worse more deaths it didn’t get postponed. Trump definitely cannot do it.
BOOM!!!
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it
No. It’s really bad. Like Stephanie Meyers wrote 2020. Like trump is the emotional immature Edward and we are all Bella.
What I would expect on  tonight. Top story will be a live report from the NY pizza restaurant that trump tweeted out. In the 57th minute, there will be a snippet of video of Obama, Bush and Clinton speaking at John Lewis service
Even if delayed, Trump still leaves office at noon on January 20th, 2021. Absolutely nothing changes that.
Trump could never give a speech/eulogy because he can't talk about anyone but himself.  I love and miss Obama so much!!
Ask him if he knew this please National Debt Has Increased $5.2 Trillion During Trump's 3 Years as President
National Debt Has Increased $5.2 Trillion During Trump's 3 Years as President
Parts of President Obama's John Lewis eulogy will be played on a loop.  Mad King Trump's going to go berserk.
No one cares about Mad King Trump and he's going to whine about that all over again the next chance he gets.  The spotlight needs to be on him every minute.
No one there wanted trump to say a damn thing.
Donald Trump will NEVER upstage President Barack Hussein Obama!

Trump lies. People voted by mail during the Civil War and WWII.
I would normally agree, but those who follow Trump so blindly and outright disrespect the health and welfare of others around them, good riddance.

Is Trump using Covid as a cover to kill Black ppl? It’s odd that the Turning Point Israeli-first died of Covid just the other day too. Who’s next to die of Covid? Paul Ryan?
The fact that Trump is trying to delay the election which he can't do shows how horrified he is that he's going to lose. We have him scared. Now let's do the one thing that he and his republican billionaire goons can't stop. VOTE. VOTE. VOTE.

believes in the Constitution &amp; can't stop pointing this out.  There are many levers of power that Mad King Trump can pull that *could* make an election impossible.   But, if that happens I assure you that I'll wave the Constitution as patriotically as a Cdn can.
Everyone is saying trump can’t postpone the November elections.  Trust me. He will find a way. He probably already has. Hence the tweet.  I myself find it scary at how very right about trump I’ve been.  He needs to be removed from office NOW. #RemoveTrumpNow
No offense, but he brought this on himself. Basically trump killed him along w/well over 150,000 other Americans. Or do the others not count? You never seem to mention them.
McLaughlin also believes that Trump asking for something that will never happen only makes him look “weak.”  “It is also a glaring statement of no-confidence in his own ability to compete in the election,” he writes.

Trump attended a fundraiser in Texas without a mask on the day the US hit 150,000 coronavirus deaths. In addition to all his bad qualities, he's a hypocrite too.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Florida ain’t New York.....New York has the coronavirus under control.
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa campaign rally....No mask. No social distancing. Now dead due to stupidity. Follow Donald Trump....
That’s awesome May Kanye get fair coverage from the media ?Welcome to Floridian journalism. They put the duh in Floriduh. What a fuckin idiot.
Trump is the virus! 🦠
Trump murdered Hermain Cain for a rally. 150,000+ more were killed for less. Trump will let more than 1/4 of a million die before the end of August unless something radically changes.
Jim Inhofe and Mitch McConnell who have a combined age of 163 years Old, are Cowering to Dems and Denying President Trump the right to replace Holdovers at the Pentagon, cause Dems are mad that Tata Hurt Obama's feelings..It's time to retire Guys, you're too Old &amp; Tired to Fight!
I have no words for thes four other than Trump ass kissers!
We love you president trump
They are desperate! ...
Trump at 48% approval in Rasmussen! He won with 45% in same poll!
This is exactly how Trump wanted y’all to spend your day. Exactly what he wanted asked in his stupid presser. Instead of the GDP news. Instead of why he has not paid tribute to John Lewis. Instead of why he’s protecting the White House with a bunker.
When a toddler done get his way.  They will say anything until they get there way.  We should  all vote by mail.  It's safe and easier for everyone.   I forgot Russia and hack into mail in voting.  Wondering if thats why Trump want to stop it.
Just a thought. If Trump got his way and ‘delayed’ the election, both Trump and Pence would constitutionally be out of office on Jan 20. The Speaker, 3rd in line, would become Acting Madam President Pelosi. Pass it on.
If Trump had mandated masks at his Tulsa rally, Herman Cain would still be alive.
Forgiving George Wallace. He apologized to John Lewis, while Trump will never apologize for his racism and bigotry!
If you’ve had enough of Donald Trump’s chaos and corruption, here’s one way you can help end it.  Chip in ANY AMOUNT to attend the virtual grassroots fundraiser with  and  tomorrow and let’s sweep Donald Trump into the dustbin of history.
So self respecting woman votes for Trump.  Every mom I know is sick and tired of the dangerous and divisive DJT bullshit train and will be voting straight blue this year.    ...and I'll be looking forward to seeing #denialdonald removed forcefully on  inauguration day.
A Half-Century After Wallace, Trump Echoes the Politics of Division
Heels up Harris. Fraud liar and cheat. Vote for Trump and Straight Republican in 2020.
What happened to Herman Cain was predicted.  Trump knew it would happen to a percentage of attendees.  That’s why he made them sign a liability waiver.  He was ok with it as long as he got to have his rally.  I can’t understand why both sides aren’t outraged.
Imbecil, that's why Trump did prison reform, because police, including elite FBI, bully people into taking a plea. They do it to minorities too often or any one who is their enemy. These agencies have too much power.
Sounds like Trump is trying to cheat by electronic voting and vote by mail blocks that.
Please stay on this Stephanie. This may be one of the worst flagrant abuses since Trump has been in office. And why? it makes NO sense shy of profiteering...the question that is everything is who knew on Monday? Who acted? This is not something even Barr can simply brush away.
But not in a racist way.  Someone is going to show me how the lives of Trump voters who wait all day to see him freestyle on the mic....have inproved since 2016.  They look like the same dirt poor inbred Whites I would see when we drove by the trailer park.
This is called voter suppression folks. Trump is going to lose and he knows it.
It’s fairly clear that he chose to vilify the science behind mask use to please Trump. He put his faith in a charlatan rather than the true experts. That loyalty ultimately cost him his life.
Trump led Herman Cain to the gates of Hell.
This is a very nice tribute from President Trump.

Yes Herman Cain passed from Covid likely picking it up at a trump rally.  How many others have passed on who don’t have the name recognition that Cain did from that same rally?  Trump could care less
Imagine telling someone to stfu because they don’t share their viewpoints. People like you create Trump voters because the left is doing their best to not have conversations and jump to calling everyone villains and racists. This isn’t how you win people over. Be better.
Trump can say the same thing about Putin!
Anything but anything to tie Trump to this. Anything.
Trump is so out there, I swear he has lost his mind.
idea of a solution. I don't need to trash Trump to make my point. But whatever Trump sees when he looks in the mirror, and what Trump claims to see when he looks at Joe Biden are so far away from the reality.
It is amazing how little self-awareness Trump has that he would call Biden a "buffoon". Biden is self-effacing, humble, humorous, riant, generous, spirited, fit, loving, a goofy grandpop, a kind (if not overly permissive) father, a supportive &amp; proud husband. His friendships are

Trump again throwing meat to the media about this "delay the election" talk..what he tryna distract us from?
The Donald Trump Presidency.
What they are saying is that if Flynn is pardoned, he loses his 5thA rights and can be jailed to testify before a GJ.  If he refuses to testify, he could then be held in contempt. Of course. Trump could then pardon him from the Contempt and around the Merry Go Round we go.
Juan Williams saying Trump is a sore loser is amazing considering he’s 1-0 in elections so literally he has never lost.
Yesterday trump was trying to scare people from black and brown people who could possibly move into their neighborhoods and lower their house prices, today he wanted to postpone the election and this is your message?
Greatings brothers, would it be too much to ask for a min of you time or a reshare ?
In totally agree. Would it be too much to ask a ally for a minute to assist our a black radio show host?
By adding a question mark, Trump did not thereby change the necessary implication of his tweet, i.e. that the election should be postponed. Punctuation does not make an affirmative statement into a question if the meaning is otherwise clear.
Ali I can't believe we are here again worried about the Democrats stealing votes which we witnessed in Broward county Florida in 2018. Please listen President Trump ! Ali would be one of your best advisers .

Congrats   Another new record.  I bet if you keep opening more things you can kill more people!  Trump is so proud of how many people you have killed.
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today’s eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Obama’s eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
Anybody seen Trump today?  No. I thought not.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
Very SAD that now the Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump is asking COVID-19 patients for blood. Appropriate after trying to take away their health care, unemployment, food stamps, and jobs. Way to go asshole  Trump.
According to Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump,  DeSantis and  Gohmert, Republicans should not wear a face mask in public for fear of catching the COVID-19 virus, and should gather in large groups and share loud personal discussions in solidarity.
Judging by my Twitter timeline, I think I may be the only one who is quite pleased that Trump didn’t go to John Lewis’ funeral.
Trump Can’t Delay the Election—So He’s Trying to Make It a Chaotic Mess  because you don’t have the votes.  You don’t have the votes. You don’t have the votes. Yeahhhhhhh
Trump is so uneducated and ignorant he wouldn’t understand anything President Obama said in his eulogy. Trump has about 5 nouns and 10 pronouns and 3 verbs in his vocabulary.
And Trump has the audacity to offer condolences to Mr. Cain's grieving family without taking responsibility for hosting a senseless rally during a global pandemic.
Congratulations on another day of record cases and deaths in Florida because you're a fucking idiot like your mentor Cowardly Liar Dotard   Trump.

Trump did a major disservice to the family of PFC Vanessa Guillen by having an event on the day of John Lewis's funeral and at the hour of President Obama's eulogy. They deserve to have their story heard. There is no way that the meeting had to be today.
Trump has mishandled crises, 150,000 of our fellow Americans are dead, we continue to grapple with systematic racism &amp; we have a careless BIGOT who could not care less if things got worse because he’s making them worse. Let us listen to Obama and VOTE!!!! VOTE EVERY ENABLER OUT!
Given the way he's running his campaign, you have to wonder:  What does the President have on Donald J. Trump?
Trump tweets to bypass the press. He has said so himself. If his plan was to troll the press he has ample opportunity to troll them directly.
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it

Trump could never give a speech/eulogy because he can't talk about anyone but himself.  I love and miss Obama so much!!
Got a plan for you Marco. You’re a political opportunist. Send a signal to Trump that you would delay the presidential elections. What the heck! He’ll be pleased with you and you’re presidential aspersions will continue since it’s not about integrity for you, it’s about you.

The press Corp is paid to be there. Just add the context. trump is doing this to take attention away from John Lewis's funeral.   trump is acting like a toddler who wants attention. He will babble like a toddler.

Trump lies. People voted by mail during the Civil War and WWII.
Just going out in a state that has 10k+ cases a day and higher than new york now with a governor that will never do anything cause he's a trump fanboy is... concerning
If you’ve had enough of Donald Trump’s chaos and corruption, here’s one way you can help end it.  Chip in ANY AMOUNT to attend the virtual grassroots fundraiser with  and  tomorrow and let’s sweep Donald Trump into the dustbin of history.
You are the instigator! You are it's against the law what YOU TRUMP are doing! I pray this vote is is 20/80 AGAINST your ass!
Trump's decision to pull troops from Germany will weaken the US and boost Russia, says Merkel ally. Why does Trump always end up doing what the Russians want?
Finally you show the world the Dictator that you want to be. But it won't work for you and by January 20th, 2021 you will be shown to the door of the White House that you rented from me and you wasted my tax dollars for the past 4 years. No Mister Trump! I'll dance to your loss!
You do understand the actions that certain Governors took, caused a number of preventable deaths. Trump is not the only one to blame and it’s pathetic.
None of this would be an issue if Trump hadn’t championed it… None of this is medical , it’s all political…
What kind of nonsense are you spewing? Are you supporting Trump? If so, no wonder you don't make any sense.
Laura reminds me of President Trump always ahead of the curve ! If you want a true leader in Congress that will fight for Us ... Vote LauraLoomer
It's a shame Trump is being hated by Almost everybody. They claim he is unwell, but not everybody is really a doctor, right? So why would they claim that?
P.s what do we loose by giving Kanye 30 mins? Is there someone more fair minded than  ? Plz sign out petition, share or re-tweet?
Donnie you are so sad Republicans won't even vote for you! The day the great Donald Trump said why doesn't anyone like me!!!
The fact that Trump is trying to delay the election which he can't do shows how horrified he is that he's going to lose. We have him scared. Now let's do the one thing that he and his republican billionaire goons can't stop. VOTE. VOTE. VOTE.
It’s a shame all 3 drank too much of Trump’s Kool-Aid and wouldn’t listen to science and the doctors
We would be if Trump were gone
Until yesterday, the Tweet with the video where a Nigerian Doctor certified that Hydroxychloroquine, a drug promoted by TRUMP works and is harmless to health.  They are blocking everything related to this because they cannot admit that TRUMP has been right from the beginning
Herman Cain survived stage IV colon cancer.  Donald Trump’s rhetoric and disinformation is literally deadlier than stage IV colon cancer.

We could all die and trump would not give a flying fuck. If you truly think he cares about you at all, you’re buying a narrative that expired decades ago
Trump 2020. If you want communism vote the other way. Government controlled every aspect of your life.
Trump attended a fundraiser in Texas without a mask on the day the US hit 150,000 coronavirus deaths. In addition to all his bad qualities, he's a hypocrite too.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Please no one tell Trump that if there's no president elected by January 20th then Nancy Pelosi becomes president until one is elected. His reaction will be priceless.
Trump could hand Putin the nuclear codes in the middle of Fifth Avenue, and his supporters would still vote for him.
Herman Cain's death is on Trump's head. Cain got this at the Tulsa rally. Another good man lost due to  ineptitude.
Trump floats November election delay - but he can’t do that:  someone should give Trump copy of Constitution to read.
I agree with the statement however, Trump encourages his "followers" to endanger themselves and in doing so all of us.
That’s awesome May Kanye get fair coverage from the media ?
Don’t be shy, rally for Trump without masks some more 😊

Oops wrong answer from the supposedly smartest guy in the room?? Pompeo is so smart that he constantly lies for trump and power. That’s pure evil.Trump is the virus! 🦠
Trump murdered Hermain Cain for a rally. 150,000+ more were killed for less. Trump will let more than 1/4 of a million die before the end of August unless something radically changes.

So self respecting woman votes for Trump.  Every mom I know is sick and tired of the dangerous and divisive DJT bullshit train and will be voting straight blue this year.    ...and I'll be looking forward to seeing #denialdonald removed forcefully on  inauguration day.
Heels up Harris. Fraud liar and cheat. Vote for Trump and Straight Republican in 2020.
What happened to Herman Cain was predicted.  Trump knew it would happen to a percentage of attendees.  That’s why he made them sign a liability waiver.  He was ok with it as long as he got to have his rally.  I can’t understand why both sides aren’t outraged.
Imbecil, that's why Trump did prison reform, because police, including elite FBI, bully people into taking a plea. They do it to minorities too often or any one who is their enemy. These agencies have too much power.
Sounds like Trump is trying to cheat by electronic voting and vote by mail blocks that.
It’s fairly clear that he chose to vilify the science behind mask use to please Trump. He put his faith in a charlatan rather than the true experts. That loyalty ultimately cost him his life.
Trump led Herman Cain to the gates of Hell.
This is a very nice tribute from President Trump.

Calls for immediate impeachment!  Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Yes Herman Cain passed from Covid likely picking it up at a trump rally.  How many others have passed on who don’t have the name recognition that Cain did from that same rally?  Trump could care less
If Trump calls Portland protesters a "beehive of terrorists" then what do we call his Cabinet???
Dear momma :) . Want to hear some bars from Kanye? How about a 30 min interview with by charlamagne tha god?
Hey Robbie. Have you read Mary Trump’s book?  Lots and lots of early tells.
I don’t think there’s any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
That reasoning never crossed Trump’s mind.

The Donald Trump Presidency.
Juan Williams saying Trump is a sore loser is amazing considering he’s 1-0 in elections so literally he has never lost.
Yesterday trump was trying to scare people from black and brown people who could possibly move into their neighborhoods and lower their house prices, today he wanted to postpone the election and this is your message?
Greatings brothers, would it be too much to ask for a min of you time or a reshare ?
I rarely, if ever, swear in public, Twitter or Facebook. But I find myself swearing at the TV when GOP goons like Gym Jordan, Doug Collins, Mnuchin, Nunes, and, of course, their Idiot-in-Chief Trump open their mouths. No one else makes my blood boil as much as they do. 😖 😡
In totally agree. Would it be too much to ask a ally for a minute to assist our a black radio show host?
Mad King Trump has finally latched onto an issue that his #MAGA base is sure to rally around: No election.

Busy watch PRESIDENT OBAMA. NO TIME 4 Trump’s BS. #TrumpIsALoser
I have sleep issues, but they're more likely caused by my spending too much time on Twitter rather than worrying about the pandemic! 😳 🙄 And my addiction to Twitter is totally the result of following the resistance to Trump's disastrous administration. 😡
I would rather Barney run the country at this point trump needs to go 💯💯💯💯💯
Lewis showed nothing but contempt for President Trump, why should he bother?
So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you’re proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain’s death was a result of YOUR negligence.
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! 😎
I sense desperation in the air....your years as an enabler to Donald Trump are costing you.
Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today’s eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Obama’s eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
Judging by my Twitter timeline, I think I may be the only one who is quite pleased that Trump didn’t go to John Lewis’ funeral.
WOW! what a service #JohnLewisMemorial . What I am curious to know is why Trump was not at the services? As a leader of this country he should have been there.
And Trump has the audacity to offer condolences to Mr. Cain's grieving family without taking responsibility for hosting a senseless rally during a global pandemic.
And nobody knew it until “Professor” Trump told us.
And trump doesn't care because he has no soul!
Chip in ANY AMOUNT to attend the virtual grassroots fundraiser with  and  on Friday and let’s sweep Donald Trump into the dustbin of history.
Are you also wondering how many regular, ordinary, non-public figures also died as a result of the ill-advised Trump Tulsa rally that killed Herman Cain?  There are certainly others.

This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
Did anyone put a clock on how long it took Mad King Trump to mention John Lewis after his death?
Given the way he's running his campaign, you have to wonder:  What does the President have on Donald J. Trump?
Donald Trump.
No it’s in the constitution that both houses must approve it first.  The spanish flu was worse more deaths it didn’t get postponed. Trump definitely cannot do it.
BOOM!!!
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it
No. It’s really bad. Like Stephanie Meyers wrote 2020. Like trump is the emotional immature Edward and we are all Bella.
What I would expect on  tonight. Top story will be a live report from the NY pizza restaurant that trump tweeted out. In the 57th minute, there will be a snippet of video of Obama, Bush and Clinton speaking at John Lewis service
Even if delayed, Trump still leaves office at noon on January 20th, 2021. Absolutely nothing changes that.
Trump could never give a speech/eulogy because he can't talk about anyone but himself.  I love and miss Obama so much!!
Ask him if he knew this please National Debt Has Increased $5.2 Trillion During Trump's 3 Years as President

Trump kills Herman Caine with Covid mask less rally
Disagree. I may disagree with a lot of Republican stances, but my disdain for Trump has nothing to do with partisanship. He's by far the worst president of my lifetime and that's enough to get me voting the other way.  In 4 years we can try again with the liberal candidate.

While the  could have held Mad King Trump accountable, the Democratics could have pushed harder with more articles of impeachment.  I never understood why they didn't.
One could really put the blame on #HermanCain death on Trump. No #Tulsa rally and Herm is still with us. Yes, Don the con, you are to blame, but being the narcissistic asshole you are, Herm won't even get a mention in a tweet from you.

But those aren't the only issues. Trump is actively repealing environmental protections, tarnishing our relationships with allies, dividing the nation further thru his rhetoric, and licking his chops to further stack the supreme court with conservatives.
So you say the election will be rigged.... so you say the votes will be fraudulent.... Hmmm 🤔.... ok OK! I see now... that makes so much sense now! How else could of we elected a 🤡? This may be the first time I’m saying this but Donald Trump is a f***ing genius.....continued

TRULY THAT IS SOME BULLSHIT YOU JUST STATED. TRUMP IS A RACIST PIG WHO HAS TURNED THE WH TO SWAMP OF PARASITES. SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS HAVE GONE FROM RED TO VOTING BLUE...THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT TRUMP IS DOING AND SOME HAVE STATED THAT HE IS DOING THE SAME AS THE DICTATOR HE LOVES.
Today many Republican congressmen will be asked about Trump's tweet and they will all have mysteriously not seen it.
Trump sent out the tweet just as the historically low GDP numbers crossed the wires. His failure to manage the health of the country has caused massive failure in the economy. And now he has nothing to run on other than spreading division and fear if the "others".
YEP, THERE IS 5,000 REASON NOT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP...ONE IS HIS IQ IS 40, HE DOES NOT READ, TAKES NO BRIEFING, CALLS PEOPLE UGLY DISGUSTING NAMES LIKE A 5-YEAR-OLD BULLY, HAS NO SENSE OF DIRECTION, AND HE LOVES DICTATORS. THES ARE JUST A FEW...THE LIS GOES ON AND ON.
Pointing to other countries does not negate that Mad King Trump screwed the pooch and sold the pups.   ALSO: More racism, another attack on MSM, and a whole heaping helping of Whataboutism.   Mad King Trump sure packs a whole lot of shit into a bag that only holds 280 characters.
Trump tweeted the election stuff right as the GDP calculation comes out because he’s the worst president ever and still doesn’t have an actual plan to fix this country he’s just preserving his own wealth and power.
Then why is Trump doing nothing to show proof and make it available?
I'm pretty much resigned to the idea that we won't make any meaningful headway until after the inauguration.  Assuming Trump loses and we have some form of blue wave.
TRUMP IS AN AS%#. VOTING WITH THE BLUE WAVE.

I just can’t stand it when the word of the president is treated with such seriousness as this. Trump says things for attention, often in an incoherent way. The media adds context to his lies, we can’t be doing this if we want things to change.  Hope you &amp; the fam are safe &amp; well.
"Trump tells voters in suburbs they will ‘no longer be bothered’ by low-income housing"
The world according to trump:  Schools are safe. Returning to work is safe. Voting is not safe.
Trump votes.... so be careful. Do research and VOTE!!! From the bottom to the top KNOW WHO YOU ARE VOTING FOR! Also #DefundThePolice #notvotingfortrump #BreonnaTaylorsKillersAreFree #childsextrafficking
LIAR IN CHIEF! The postal service is the most trusted federal agency and has been for years. Because trump wants to suppress voters who use mail in voting. The more people who vote, the bigger the embarrassment of Trump's loss. Stop trying to disenfranchise voters.
All BULLSHIT from the Trump administration!!

Please stop just sharing what this guys says. He’s let hundreds of thousands of individuals die while he strokes his own ego. Journalists shouldn’t be using his political attacks so openly, they aren’t necessary &amp; push the Trump’s narrative. We need to hold them accountable.
Yes, I know a black pastor that voted for Obama and then voted for Trump, because he says, "Obama did  nothing for my people" then he said Trump has.
Definitely dragging behind, but what in Trump's world doesn't!
We all need to support one another. Especially with all the insanity and division going on in our country and it's not Trump's fault either!
She draws like Trump draws a hurricane path.
An editor on the show said, “Most of us knew he was a fake. He had just gone through I don’t know how many bankruptcies. But we made him out to be the most important person in the world. It was like making the court jester the king.”
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
But, you’re still Mad King Trump’s fan, so it’s easy to dismiss everything you tweet.
“Fauci is now in danger of being lumped into Trump’s envelope of envy, a space in which you must endure Trump’s endless attacks because you are something that he could never be: an accomplished person who is also decent.”
“How precisely is it that a lying, lecherous, anti-intellectual grifter doesn’t enjoy the same high standing as the honorable and the honest, the well-read and well-behaved?”
“Hold Donald Trump up to a mirror and that bulging, scowling orange face is today’s Republican Party.”
“Mr. Trump didn’t hijack the Republican Party. He is the logical conclusion of what the party became over the past 50 or so years, a natural product of the seeds of race-baiting, self-deception and anger that now dominate it.”
This is "really" the Democratic Party #Walkaway  🇱🇷TRUMP 2020🇱🇷
I can honestly say President Trump is the ONLY ONE doing anything for the benefit of the American people.  Republican politicians are ALL TALK!!!
I've spoken up about it many times on Twitter &amp; Facebook, but my audience isn't wide enough to reach the people who should bring attention to Trump's betrayal of our Kurdish allies. It's among his worst crimes. Mitt Romney gave a powerful speech in Congress condemning Trump.
Trump picked Pence because that was the only guy he didnt say horrific things about on the way to winning the party...and if he picked Cruz or Jeb there was a good chance of ending up like kennedy
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.

Yeah, bullshit. That’s the official Republican excuse every time Trump says something racist,  illegal or flat out stupid. He was “joking.” Pathetic. 🙄
To watch the lemmings in the media follow it off the cliff  . . . hysterical. People think Trump's dumb,  and sometimes they are right, other times he's playing them like a fiddle.
Not a socialist but I don’t like Trump. This is still America right?
It was horrible listening to his bullshit !   Obama is a uniting voice for everyone.  Trump only want cc white supremacy
Are you talking about me and me family? Because we voted for Hillary in 2016, we are Latinos. And we are going to vote for Trump first time
Says the person who’s been protecting trump.
Well, after 8 years of Barack "more flexibility" Obama bending over and taking it from Putin, Trump decided to face him.
Brilliant move by Trump though. We know mail in voting will have issues, if Trump wins, and Dems cry foul, he says I told you so. If he loses, it will be a stain on Biden's election as we continue to find uncounted ballots through 2022.
I am so sick of Trump's  attack ads on Biden. Biden doesnt attack Trump. Hes an honest person and I hope he will be our next President!
Trump's insane! He needs a lobotomy!🤣

Trump votes by mail using an address that he doesn’t reside in... you can just request a vote by mail balllet in FL.. this is a dumb hill to die on for Republicans considering everyone in the White House does it now..
Getting rid of affordable housing projects for low-income areas is ONLY acceptable if there’s a follow-up plan to resettle these people in better areas.  But knowing Trump &amp; how he likes to leave people with nothing to fall back on, will this happen? Most likely not. #VoteHimOut

I’ve been “concerned” about  for a long time. She’s proven herself to be a Trump-enabler.
The democrats don't really give a damn about lives. It's all about beating Trump.
I just read it. No wonder Trump is the way he is. He was groomed to be this way. Disgusting!! He's always been deviant. He's a malignant narcissist. No sympathy. No empathy. Sociopath.
Imagine being married to a staunch Trump supporter when you loathe that man with every fiber of your being. Good times!! My life!! And   It has cost me my marriage. I have NO respect for my husband AT ALL!! Clearly, our morals and values no longer align. Bye 👋

Nope, people that voted for Trump, and yes he was clearly better than Hillary. If you voted for trump or vote red you’re instantly labeled as those things regardless.
Republucans are aiding and abetting  Trump in destroying our Justice department!
44 million . . . hmm . . . even Politico only reported 27.5 . . . 44 million were uninsured prior to the ACA. So in reality,  you're saying Trump didn't make the failing ACA any worse  . . .
Trump is silent because the info wasn't great and could not be verified . . . the MEDIA is silent because what info they have was collected between 2006-2012 . . . and oops, that doesn't fit their narrative.
So the fact that I didn't vote for Trump means . . .
I remember. I was a teenager when Nixon resigned. I read the newspapers and watched the news with my Dad.  Nixon was a walk in the park compared to tRump.

You tweet lies from Trump. Not sure you are the best judge of American sentiment.
You're right. He said they are rapists.
Hey, that village called, they are missing their Trump.
So is that why Trump is trying to cheat?
You voted for Trump
They are all complicit by enabling Trump!! They all gotta go!!!!!
I'm saying Biden is going to crush Trump.   That's what I said.  I didn't say I agree with everything Biden has done or not done.
I mean, you can't possibly want everything Trump has done over the last 40 years either, right?
And he's going to crush Trump. Think that says more about your guy than ours.
Cool.  Grammar does play a part in Trump tweets.
And Trump didn't tweet it. He was on the putting green when it came out.

Are you serious? Shocked why?  What shocks me is that you support tRump. After he said your Dad had something to do with JFK’s death. Oh and wait? Didn’t he say something about your wife? YOU supporting HIM is shocking.  BTW Silver can support whoever he wants.
Why the fuck didn't Trump condemn those people standing idly by while horrible people said and did horrible things?   You seem to think Democrats should do it.  Why aren't you holding Trump to the same standard.
And this is just false.  More arrests have been made by the "political cover" than have been done or helped with by Trump.  Be serious.
Yeah, they just burned him in effigy while law enforcement looked on and Obama, like the statesmen he was, just let it go.  Too bad Trump's ego is so fragile.
Trump's not President right now?  Really?
Does trump still have his business in China?
Dr Fauci  with perfect accuracy predicted in 2017 on YouTube that a (and i quote) "A surprise outbreak would occur during the final year Of Trump's Presidency" The DEEP STATE hates Trump so much they want people to die in order to win an election!? It was planned how else?  #MAGA
Well let’s say Americans are scared of losing our Democracy with trump.
How does Trump benefit by sending law and order to cities he has NO hope of gaining a single vote in?
I thought you Trumpists don't go by polls, lol. Is not my fault that we have a jack ass of a President who can't keep his mouth shut, back in February: "We have just a few cases and it will be brought down to zero by next month" lol. At this point anybody can beat Trump.
Goal...get Trump OUT!!
I'm thinking it's not just Biden people. We HAVE to get Trump out IMMEDIATELY. Voting for Joe is our only option at this point and THEN let's try and make real changes on the independent front. Trump is just too dangerous to allow anymore time.

So when were you a Democrat? Pro-Union, Pro-Safety nets have always been a hallmark of democratic policies.  And I guess with being anti-socialism, you don't support Trump so that's good.

As  a reply to their wasted vote comments.   I reply that it is not wasted at all.  In fact, it is 3 votes, 1 against Trump, 1 against Biden,and 1 for Jorgenson.
Yes, some rich people born being rich, but I'm not talking about those, I'm talking about people like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, people that innovated. I'm not talking about pigs like Donald Trump

Amazing how trump’s apocalyptic views of “America under Biden “ are all scenes of America now , under trump. Who doesn’t get that ?
Trump denied it, the  UK denied it, no US or UK Government officials said anything. Plus, the UK Government has nothing to do with the location of the Open. and the R and A was never contacted, the organization that does. Non-story, then again, it is the "anonymous source" Times.

So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
For real? I didn’t know that... wow. Rudy... you should be ashatof yourself. Like trump loves to say “that is nasty”. Lmao. 🤮
He’s the head of the Federalist society and just now says that trump is a fascist?  Wait. Haven’t we known that for three years?  The tweet this more all of a sudden turned him. Pfft.
Everything is a joke that trump says but really what happens when its not a joke none of us will ever believe in this liar in chief for anything. If his lips are moving he's Lying that's DERELICTION OF DUTY TRUMP YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

It’s crazy ironic... #Trump has been obsessing about a wall on the #Mexico border forever (ya know, to keep “them” out).  Now, due to the way the #Trump admin has handled #covid19... Mexico is literally one of the only countries in the world allowing Americans to visit!!
Well  trump hates women also but 43% of white women support him. Explain that to me

Truly!  Every single one of Trump’s “best people” all lack one other obvious thing, in addition to your list- from Betsy Devos to Herman Cain. Compassion for anyone other than themselves. Not a whit of it anywhere in this administration.

Experts dismiss Trump claim that it could take 'years' to declare election winner
Every traditional Republican understands that mail in / absentee voting is a Republican strong point.    But trump  was  a Democrat all his life, so of course he does not understand that.
Well, I’m glad you are coming around... please &amp; always, vote... Voting by mail has been done for a long long time and has less than .002% of fraud—the only reason Trump doesn’t want vote by mail is because if people vote, he loses!
The one that pisses me off the worst is Trump 2020...no more bullshit.  As if the last 3 1/2 years have been anything but!

Along with other 60000 deaths after reopening...Trump beats Milosevic, Idi Amin, Pinochet.. he wants to get to at least 10Th place on the Murderous Dictator list. #TrumpVirus
He passed away from the Trump Virus. After the first 5K deaths Trumps owns the virus and every victim's thereafter, including Herman Cain passing.
It’s because those reporters were chosen to ask those questions. Anyone with balls enough to ask about putin bounties or trump’s epic failure on c19 might receive an angry tweet or lose access. Oh the horror.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.
Herman Cain did not believe in wearing a mask, Trump did believe in wearing a mask.  Wearing a mask protects you from getting the virus, not completely but it help's tremendously.  He died because of the virus and supporting Trump's belief's #TrumpKillsAmericans
Of course he is. Trump is going to undermine the results and declare himself the winner. Welcome to authoritarian rule! Democracy and the USA is finished.
This is why Donald Trump is president. Racists like this.
Trump supporters assume they are the “smart people” in this instance.  They are not. Not now. Not ever.
Absolutely correct, Governor DeSantis sits at the knee of Trump, both must be voted out
I am not sure if I should believe what you're saying. Say that now and say something else in the end is not the same. You called Trump a conman.and now you're bossom buddies..thanks but no thanks.
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
Trump does not care about Americans period he’s a socio pathic career narcissist and we don’t need Mary trumps book to tell us that. He’s a career liar .
Our idiot Governor DeathSantis is listening to his master Trump. He's a darn mini Trump. He's going to get voted out.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.

Chump change compared to the Trumps.
The CIA committed treason. I can prove it. The FBI is just trying to do their jobs and enforce the federal law. Sad to see their probe of Trump collusion in Russia go down the drain over errors in procedure. Comey shouldn’t have been fired, bottom line. Trump tries stifling FBI

Y’all gonna vote for trump yet claim you care about child trafficking?!??? WHAT
Too late, he sat by and did nothing while Trump betrayed his oath, our country and allies.
Remember over the spring many “primaries” got delayed/changed to accomodate the shut down. State govs may be inclined to change election dates/mail by dates in an effort to “accomodate” (ie: round up) voters.   Trump knows whatever he proposes Dems will be against. HydroxyC, etc.
That didn't age well.. I don't want to speak ill will of the dead but he was a grown man that chose to ride or die with this hoax and paid for it. he literally died for Trump.
Trump's admiration of dictators probably getting lessons on how to take a democracy to a authoritarian dictatorship using our own judiciary and laws against us.

The covid response was a total disaster for Trump. Instead of asserting himself as a strong leader who didn’t prescribe to the mob mentally he went along with the narrative from the shutdown imbeciles and lunatics. If anything is going to be his undoing it will be this.

You don't check your sources. Here’s the full statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association and AASA, the School Superintendents Association.
Don't believe this guy; he's as anti trump as they come. "Science" is trash when the analysis is designed to come out a certain way.  #hydroxichloroquine
Trump said that he could shoot somebody and they'd still support him. Well he didn't need a gun in this case.
Pogue is an anti-trump with 100s of anti-trump tweets, including disparaging tweets about Sarah Sanders.  Which means his "analysis" has ZERO credibility. He has a clear agenda.  #Hydroxychloroquine
He said it.   The most RIGGED ELECTION ever. Mr. Putin. Can you hear me??  Donald J. Trump is the most DISGUSTING excuse for a human and those who still support him.
Press: “Next, do the Alphabet!” Trump: “There is something called an English alphabet. It’s a very very Patriotic, American Alphabet. Nobody’s seen anything like it before! In fact, I’m hearing China doesn’t even have ONE and we have like 3. 3 is small but not compared to 0.”
As terrible as that is, I'm still a bit more concerned with the prospect of dictator Trump than I am about the GNP.

Good thing Herman Caine knew the Lord and is in the presence of a Holy God. Herman was a grown man. Since he had cancer he knew the risk&amp; made his own mind. So don’t blame Trump.
Remember Republicans were the ones who fought against every election integrity bill! Follow their money to Diabold who makes the voting machines. It all comes together as to WHY they are so terrified with mail in voting.they need to cheat to win. FUCK TRUMP
Again, it’s trump saying something without doing something. Bark vs bite. Amazing people haven’t figured that out yet. Everyone calm down.
Police brutality , That IS criminal activity.  tRump abuses his power, THAT is criminal activity.  Stone lies in court, THAT is criminal activity.  Cohen goes to jail for commiting crimes on individual 1, yet individual 1 walks, THAT is criminal activity, and the list. Now STFU.
Trump can't pronounce basic words like plasma 🙄 "plausma" 🤦🏻‍♀️
No more than Trump is on his knees servicing your buddy Putin.
His briefing is nauseating.  I want to throw bricks at the tv for his utterly outrageous claims of voter fraud.  Suggestion:  Since according to him an "absentee ballot" is fine, everyone needs to request one so he'll shut up.

Trump Takes A Victory Lap Over Alarm Sparked By His Push To Postpone Election Day
Looks like Trump thinks all voters in Florida and Michigan and other states are all Democrats. He appears to be shooting himself in the foot. Republicans vote by mail too...right.
I do like Republicans at least most of them but... wow Trump supporters are literally a bunch of cult members who can't think for themselves. Pure sheep. This isn't even a D vs R thing it's literally common sense vs ignorance.

Trump is such a child. President Bush gave a eulogy at John Lewis‘s funeral even though John Lewis didn’t go to Bush’s inauguration because of the Al Gore/BUSCH recount election. Trump didn’t even pay respects to Lewis when he was lying in state in the Capitol. Not presidential.

Bottom line: the N.R.A. laundered Russian money into the 2016 campaign and illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign. The N.R.A. needs to have its tax-exempt status stripped. Our documentary details all of this. But we need help to get the doc out.
Trump doesn’t care if more of his voters vote by mail. Trump doesn’t care if vote by mail is popular. The best opportunity Republicans have to suppress the vote is by reducing the number of urban voting sites where voters can vote. That’s the plan!

Republican Voters against Trump. I believe she’s in Ohio.
History will remember Donald Trump in one way and one way only: as an accessory to the murder of tens of thousands of Americans. And amazing legacy
I don't think so loll trump is done
I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Your right it’s just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.
. is a partisan hack. And a Trump-sucking sycophant. And an asshole.
Thanks to Trump and his corrupt leadership for our country going through this terrible epidemic Virus! All Trump cares about is his real estate and his selfish needs to be against the Medical professionals that we have to unite as a country to get this Virus out! Trump👎🤥
Call me crazy, but i think this is Trump coded speak for "dont worry i will keep POC out of your neighborhood."
That would be a lie. Trump IS a full blown racist.
Why not flip flop it would extend your demise. If you support trump you’re a racist.
What’s shocking is just the utter disrespect. I mean, Trump flat out told reporters “no” he wouldn’t be going to pay respects to John Lewis.

Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.

Trump’s becoming a pariah. The way his kind should be treated....instead of allowed to be President.
No joke, Trump is getting off on this - the moment he realized he could tweet praise for a different black guy who just died on the same day he planned on blowing off respect for John Lewis, I’m sure a big smug grin crossed his face and he dove for his phone.

RIP to #HermanCain who died from COVID after attending a Trump rally without a mask. Not intending this as a “gotcha” at all, but a plea to anti-maskers to maybe reconsider the whole mask thing.
See Trump is corrupt and hateful going against our Constitution! Protesters have legal rights they were not doing anything wrong but protesting against something the Trump Dictator didn’t agree with equal rights BLM👎🤥
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?

Parents aren’t going to send their children to slaughter for you and who you pray to (Trump). You decided to listen to the lies about the virus 🦠 from Trump and his enablers. You reap what you sow. You are following the Herman Cain path.
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.
He’s a fraud plain and simple.....Can’t believe Trump keeps him
How the hell does Trump keep this fraud?..very discouraging
Trump and GOP running up $3.7 trillion deficit this year.
Today Trump suggested delaying the election. Obama was reinforcing John Lewis' belief "When you see something that is not right, you must do something," "Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part."
And Trump voters are conservative, so what does that make him? Your claim was specious and an attempt to discredit the original point, which is that by and large Republicans and far right groups are the biggest pushers re: reopening/masks are ineffective/covid conspiracies.
Them they criticize Trump at Rose Garden
Q: Did Herman Cain tweet that masks would not be required at Trump's controversial Tulsa rally? And was that tweet subsequently deleted?  A: Yes.
Trump is more afraid of early voting 🗳 then the actually Election Day🤔 but want worried about it in 2016 🤷🏾‍♀️
The more people who get sick, the more of an excuse Trump and Barr will have to try and postpone or suspend the election. Remember, has no bottom and will do anything to win. Cynical? Perhaps...

so I'm guessing trump wasn't at the funeral.....
Amazing how you and Cain and Trump and conservatives can say whatever they want, no matter how despicable, but God forbid someone criticizes a conservative, she is labeled hateful, no matter how valid the criticism. Look in the mirror.
And MBS as well, but I totally agree about Putin too. Trump is coddling all the foreign dictators &amp; tyrants from North Korea, to   Russia, to Saudi. Time to shut down Rizvi &amp; Milner. Don’t let these foreign tyrants buy up our social media. Down with fascism! #bringbackbetter
Thank you, Obama!! Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, takes aim at Trump over voting rights, protest response
He died from the Trump Virus. You neglected to write that.
Rest in peace Herman Cain. Hopefully others will learn from your misplaces trust in Trump.
Doesn't take nerve,nor are they unaware or unconcerned.....they are the lowest common denominators a.k.a. ignorant racist trump supporters
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
C’mon let’s be fair Trump knows 6 words : Person,Woman,Man,Camera,Tv and Bigly. In Trump’s world Bigly counts.
Is Trump a hateful person?
Right, because when Lewis boycotted BOTH Bush's and Trump's inaugurationa he was working to bring people together?
I actually think the humiliating loss would lead to him not really returning to the job for those two months. His only agenda is “Trump.” He doesn’t care about what Mitch might want.   I think he’ll spend December stuffing money into suitcases and arranging to leave the USA.
To encourage them all to use the free filters provided to all Flint residents? Yeah I remember that. Man, I miss the days when that was the worst thing you could come up with against a president.   My turn:
Why didn't trump share his hydroxychloroquine with Herman Cain? He could have saved him.🤔
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now—you won’t get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone’s ideas before we vote.
No, Trump is a national disgrace. Trump has done nothing about Russia placing a bounty on US soldiers.... #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsANationalSecurityThreat

Congress been asking for Trump taxes for 4 years. Nigga just said “nah, y’all can’t see that”. And nothing happened. He gonna do what he want with this election.
Yea and I’m sure the 8 Trump campaign staffers who contracted COVID shortly after the Tulsa Rally must’ve gotten it from somewhere else too. Regardless I guarantee that he and those around him did not wear masks or take the virus seriously which still makes it ironic and foolish
You are losing your hold on the Republican Party!!!  #sad #DementiaDon

All those jobs lost are his fault? No. They are you and your ilks fault who refuse to fuckin do anything. But again, all Trump's fault. His whole presidency was job creation and then re-election comes around and suddenly everybody "loses" their job by quitting work.
Don't come at me with "his ego won't allow it" or that nonsense. The reality is Trump has always quit when things haven't gone his way. It's a consistent pattern throughout his entire life. Why would this be any different?
Ha ha tRump! You are so far behind in the polls, it would take more than a miracle for you to win. Since you don’t like losing, why don’t you just drop out of the race now so the GOP can at least put in a viable candidate.
I'm serious: I genuinely believe that Donald Trump doesn't give a damn about winning this election and is probably, subconsciously or otherwise, trying to lose.   What would he be doing differently if he weren't?

CORRECTION “Trump Virus” #TrumpVirus
Donald Trump and his election threats are a crisis but it pales in comparison to the social and political crisis we're facing.   Congress working within their right-wing neoliberal framework has no answers left and what was 10% Q2 drop in GDP will look worse on October 1
I guess Trump and his supporters aren’t going to watch the NBA anymore..........   All I have to say about that is.......BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!
I spent years working on GOP campaigns in several states, &amp; GOTV field work for conservative PACs. Especially in states like FL w/ many elderly voters, absentee ballots are a major tactical focus for any GOTV plan.  Trump discouraging his own voters from voting by mail is INSANE.
Trump is former Governor George Wallace!  #TrumpVirus.
Indeed I am, which is why I will always fight the Left, which hates our Constitution and undermines it constantly. It's the Left that believes the Constitution is "living and breathing," which is short for "it can be redefined." Trump's judicial appointments disagree.
I’ll take my first trump check whenever you get a chance Donny. If you just wanna attach it to the second one that comes out that will be fine.
I get it, but here's the thing. Politicians like Biden, Clinton &amp; Obama set the stage for people to elect Trump. If Biden gets elected, he will set the stage for someone far worse, like Tom Cotton. Who is just as fascist, but the press will roll over for because he's in the club.
Guys. Something has changed recently. In several of my group chats where I am the lefty and a boomer is present, previously apolitical (like G Johnson 2016) center right guys my age have started in on Trump and the boomers keep thinking that I am the one spamming the group chat.
This is a minor quibble, but I'm writing something quoting a Trump tweet and OF COURSE he doesn't use the #OxfordComma.
Trump is lying; take him off the air now!
The entire senate consists of traitors! You should have removed trump when he was impeached. Each of the senate have contributed to the decline in our economy and more importantly for the thousands of additional deaths due to the #TrumpVirus we will never forget!
take Trump off the air now!
take Trump off the air now.
why do you allow the president to continue to lie about mail-in voting?  Are you trying to get Trump re-elected?  Stop airing this bullshit!
Trump is so scare.  He needs to start thinking where to hide. (With Putin in Moscow is a strong possibility).
I wish we could have a live look-in on other political leaders while Trump is giving these briefings...
lol that's some dishonest hackery, wildly misrepresenting the criticism. Trump had time to tweet about some random Long Island pizzeria but took over 4 hours to tweet about Cain. Oh, and I know this is a shock to hardcore Trump fans, but I'm not left-wing &amp; never have been.
It’s typical trump bullshit deflection and distraction - this time from increasing deaths from C-19 and appalling economic news. He has no power to delay it, date is set by Congress not the president and in any event, per the constitution, his term ends at noon on Jan 20, 2021.
I missed Trump's tweet demanding the release of this man from Russia. It's out there, right?
Oh ugh, Trump's now back to dismissing this because the average age of those who die is in their 70s. I'm not willing to sacrifice my Mom and Dad. They are being as safe as is reasonably possible but there's no guarantee.

trump has no honor, no empathy, he calls the Cain family to express his sympathy. What he should have done is gotten down on his fat knees and begged their forgiveness for killing him.
Donald Trump just lost the last talking point he had for the election: conservative columnist
Listen to scientists, not politicians.  Praying for his family. Pro-Trump group deletes image mocking masks after co-founder dies from COVID-19
yeah with trump putting someone in charge of the usps who wants cost cutting measures this isn't going to improve also the reason they get lost is cause the goverment has the address you give them and if you move they send it to the old address
Those that are least able (the average american) end up paying for the bill and/or see our services provided by local govt. get more expensive. Trump campaign reaches $2 million in unpaid security bills just as Mike Pence rallies with cops
Herman Cain made the wearing of a mask THE issue. And he was RUGHT in his case it was THE issue and going to a large indoor ralley for trump in Tulsa without one ended his life.

You are correct.  I don't believe Rep John Lewis would want Trump at his funeral.  Only real presidents.
We aren’t delaying a damn thing.   You want baseball and football and open bars and schools then why delay voting.  Mail for those scared and masks for those who aren’t.  If trump thought he was winning he wouldn’t want a delay.  Virus my foot.
I don't even see trump stopping to address the death of Herman Cain. No loyalty whatsoever. I'd be shocked if he attends the memorial service as it's not about him. Such the narcissist in chief. 97 more days. Lord I pray you let me live to see this day. Nov. 3, 2020
Absolutely not. It’s depressing that Trump doing something so unbefitting of the office, not even attending the memorial, has people being like “yeah that’s good, it’s for the best.”

If kids can go to school, the election can be on time.  Mailing in your ballot is not any different than absentee voting so, quit with that trump lie!
Herman Cain’s death reminds me of this apt description from  about how seemingly competent people get pulled down by folks like Trump. In Cain’s case, the ultimately consequence was death.
"Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!" Cain tweeted (about T's Mount Rushmore rally) the day before he was hospitalized.
It's unclear how Cain contracted COVID-19. He tested positive for the disease 11 days after attending a campaign rally for Trump in Tulsa. Cain tweeted out a photo of himself at the rally where neither he, nor those surrounding him, were wearing masks
How about media stops chasing every shiny object Trump tosses out there? Are you kittens or discerning professionals? Sheesh! Not helping!
Dropping my ballot off to ensure it gets there. Tired of criminals being at the too of our government. If nothing else Trump has exposed those in power that don't believe in our country.

Because she was going for the nomination, that's how it works, it wasn't a mistake. Now she can go after Pence (or whoever Trump replaces him with). Kamala can get Joe to the White House and would be a great Vice President.
Sorry Democrats, but how is it that out of the ENTIRE pool of eligible left-leaning Americans, the best you could come up with is Joe Biden?  I get why the Republicans went with Trump.  At least he brings something unique.  Biden?  Nothing but a history of political baggage.

The GOP has lost all credibility during Trump's tenure.  They ignore his treason and don't care if he gets help from foreign countries to get re-elected and they apparently don't care how many Americans die because of his lack of leadership.  They should all be voted out.
We like this picture of trump better
Surprised he didn’t include one of his other favorite targets “gays”. This is Obnoxious. The sad part is trump’s racist base will jump all over this.
And the Russian tanks come rolling in from the East.  Trump did this to please his boss, Putin.
Yep.  I detest the man.  Its hard to imagine a person with so little redeeming value as Trump could be president of the US.  He is by far the worst president this country has ever had and we've had a few bad ones throughout history.  Andrew Johnson and Hoover come to mind.
I live in the 'burbs, and there are a couple of Trump signs up in my neighborhood. Would love to trade out one of those jerks for you.
That’s fantastic you own your home. Not me I’m a renter now but I’m very thankful to Trump that I can now afford to live comfortably BC of his increases during his first year.
There was no Taliban when Soviets occupied Afghanistan. Mujahadeen yes, Taliban no. Russians have always been our adversary, even to this day.  Just because trump is beholden to Putin doesn’t change the fact that russia is doing its best to defeat USA without direct confrontation
I figured when I saw Trump this morning saying he won't leave Portland until he "cleaned out" the protesters that his goons would be gone soon. Sure enough, you can always count on President Fool to be lying his ass off.

#FederalistSociety #MoscowMitch #LadyGraham #Trump  The Fed Soc doesn't care about the #Delay tweet. They're using it to dump #TRE45ON b/c  #TrumpIsLosing. Fed Soc wants to keep Senate red for judge confirmations. Signalling GOP it's ok to break with cheato &amp; try to win races.
Pretty sure that photo was shortly before Trump ratted him out to the cops.
Me too Amy 😔. Trump sucks!!
U the people in the left have wish to kill trump, make pics about it w his head, make videos of trump look a like to be shot in the head, destroy the live of a 16 year old for a fake video where celebrities n news outlets espoused his life n leftist celebrate it, in fact some of
Just a horrible deal. Perhaps Trump is laboring under the assumption that Kodak, shorn of its technology edge and top thinkers, is the company he remembers from the 60s
Hard to argue with that, I suppose. If we’ve learned anything about Trump, it’s that he’s not a details guy. And secondarily, he’s not a big picture guy. #hmmmm
Trump is a monster!  His constant deflection and reference to Covid 19 as the China Virus makes my blood boil!
Keep them in ghettos right Donald, low income people are Americans also. You are disgusting. Your dad made your millions by building low income housing in cities, you loved it then! It’s fear your selling, be it crime, housing,anything. You are a low life!
You I’ll get to see it tenfold at Cain’s funeral with Trump who will make  it a rally.
So?  It’s a snapshot in time . We now have a George Wallace (Donald Trump) in the White House. He’s a questionable GOP
We still need more.  I'm sure there are 10,000 armed trump supporters who will try to intimidate voters.
Bottom line keep them closed to hurt Trump! You should know that!
Yeah when Pennsylvania fines its footing and it's passed in July 1863  when Pennsylvania resolves to kick the ass of the second coming of Jefferson Davis who happens to be Donald J Trump
And, don't forget Mr. V.P., it was  that stopped travel from China on 1/31/2020. Day before that, the WHO Director General said no travel ban on China was necessary due to the novel corona virus. Thankfully, Pres. Trump didn't listen to the WHO!
Trump claims that the 2020 election is “rigged,” hours before he claims he will win the election “big.”  Doesn’t that mean that Trump is rigging the election in his favor? Just asking for a friend, named Joe Biden.
I see you’re just another rich Republican with NO political experience just getting in line to try to attain a powerful position in government.I’m sorry you’ve enlisted your son to soapbox for a loosing proposition.Supporting tRump who supports bounties is unAmerican.
Note to Iran - that was not a positive about Trump.   English is a backwards language sometimes but maybe don’t worry about the US. We will figure it out.
Didn’t he got the Trump’s virus in Oklahoma? So do you take responsibility sir?
It's really hard who you're accusing  In any case, Trump is at the center of all the evil going on today... After all he is the Antichrist

To everyone spazzing out: no, Trump is not delaying the election. This is what children do when you take their toy away.
Why is he so great he was a lackluster executive... A national Pizza chain is no Great American  We have too much pizza... he was willing to collude with Trump that makes him an Uncle Tom, like Carson...
Only in the modern crazy world Hitler and Stalin have ganged up over the internet to attack America directly...  With Trump all over the headlines we must never forget never never never never  Putin WILL PAY for what he has done to our country,,, and if that means his own blood..
Trump is now saying the election is rigged, but he is also claiming he will win.  The only conclusion we can draw if he is correct, is that he’s rigging the election.
I think you owe  an apology for this article on 4/24.  It hasn’t aged well.
Donald Trump knows that intrinsically  He hates people that are smarter than him, that are more moral than him... He hates successful people that made their money honestly he hates those people with a passion
So you prefer Facism? That is the road Trump is going down.  I prefer the Democracy we already have and Trump and the GOP are trying to destroy!
How about an angry crowd of 200,000 gathers in Washington DC and overwhelms the White House and whisks Trump out so that he may find his destiny...
we legit had a trump supporting white male steal a lobster out of the tank at work the other night and this was his response when the cops showed up 😂
This is a Southwest Florida thing: Trump and American flags hanging from the back of pickups. Along with the occasional Confederate flag. Moral of the story: Make sure you vote for Biden so truck guy will be even more unhappy.
This was posted in Nextdoor by an unhappy neighbor:  Theft. I was in the parking lot of Petco in Gulf center.  When I came out Someone had the guts to steal my Trump and American flag off the back of my truck. Moral of the story, look out for thieves in that parking lot!
It is my belief the Donald Trump is the direct result of Post Obama derangement syndrome.
Trump and the GOPare behaving beautifully. Overlooking all of Lewis' recent misbehaviour to respect his past. Obama on the other..goes full on political. There is a reason America is so disappointed. He reignited a race war..fucked up healthcare and threw up over foreign policy

We are intentionally using only the language that has been confirmed to be coming out of the mouth of Donald J Trump  Are contacts in Ukraine or clear... Trump humiliates Lindsey Graham when he's not around call him all sorts of things natural and unnatural
#. I want everyone to wear a mask except you (the Donald ) big shot. I hope you don’t think your going to change the Election Day .There will be such an out cry that it will make U deaf there R more anti trump than trumpets. PS YOU MF.
You share a lot more than concern with President Trump... We wonder if you have sexual fantasies about him? Maybe you imagine yourself with him... The way the führer used to fantasize about the head of the SA, Ernst Rölm.  Adolf ❤️ Ernst
Before long it's going to be Trump hiding in the bunker because collectively the left is going to find their United States Grant before the election and Trump will be booed by 500000 Great American Africans from now until election day  He'll look outside his bedroom window &amp; see.
You do know that it was Obama that got the economy from 10% unemployment in 2008 to 4.5% in 2016.... Obama got it down 5.5%... Trump for it down 1%....
After Trump and Putin Elon Musk is the most dangerous person alive today he has way too much power  Theodore Roosevelt agrees the great #TrustBuster ... SpaceX and Tesla need to be subdivided up into hundreds of companies... those concerns will be run much more efficient that way

# great  real Donald Trump thanks for fucking up the whole country. Now more and more people R getting the COVID 19 and more people out of work businesses cloesing and people will be hungry. You could have made a horror movie about this and made money.
Joe Biden is our Abraham Lincoln and then the second Civil War Jefferson Davis is in the White House... Trump is Jefferson Davis, the ""house that Jeff built"" is also Trump Tower.  In America Up Is down, left is right, and everybody right-wing Confederacy down the rabbit hole ..
Trump as gospel
Just googled Pompeo again. I had forgotten what a well-educated &amp; experienced piece of trash he was. I guess because the 1st 2 qualities are not mandatory requirements for Trump appointments.
BREAKING:  Trump just told people to avoid crowded places.  He's only about 120 days late!  If he told people to do the same thing when he was holding his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Herman Cain would likely be alive today.  RIP Herman Cain.
It is not truth or even factual, it is a assumption, and is a irresponsible statement from a known Trump hater.
This is good news because dropping all charges was the Trump/Barr agenda, right? (Sorry, a bit behind w/this atrocious Trump scandal)
Imagine how many heads Trump lives rent free in.
And Jennifer Holliday, who backed out of performing at tRump’s inauguration, is singing. White House must be reeking of stinky orange fumes by now .
Who wants to bet tRump will try to use subjugation in a sentence?
Trump asks to have the election, that he is presently losing badly, be delayed so he can steal it.
It’s legitimacy was destroyed when Trump took office, but yes, I understand your point.
As President Obama, President Bush and President Clinton give eulogies at the John Lewis Funeral, President Trump sits on the toilet threatening to delay the election.  Wake the hell up America!  #JohnLewisMemorial
No mask, trump set the standard for the easily influenced followers!
Agreed. As atrocious as he is, Trump is a symptom, not the cause.
Trump lies
They are. Very dishonest. We know what their agenda is. That's why I'm completely baffled by a video with their name on it that makes Trump look bad. Something stinks.
That's a strawman argument, I never said Trump wasn't garbage, I'm saying Biden is also garbage with more blood on his hands &amp; more ruined lives in his wake than the talking Cheeto.🤷‍♂️  It's sad that you can't argue any positives for your preferred sex pest other than,"But Trump!"
Roger Stone, Alex Jones, Donald Trump are America’s greatest liars and false information spreaders
A Trump supporter
I'm a little disappointed with the group.  Last week I asked how many would join me in filing a "false advertising" claim with the FTC against the Trump campaign.  It's a federal crime to broadcast or print lies in advertising.  I got a grand total of 3 responses. Sad!
Bickering for months until Supreme Court rules due to confusion it wasn’t a fair election. Trump and Barr repeat every time election rescheduled. Civil War ensues, sadly our democracy dies along with 500,000 innocent Americans due to COVID.
People are vile &amp; most are bond servants to to partisanship. Man, the comments. 😞 1) People that wear masks and stay home are still dying. Ask me how I know.  2) The virus doesn’t care if you’re meeting for a “rally” or a protest.  3) They’re more like Trump than they realize
Public announcements from both sides continue and sow confusion in the electorate. Many Trump voters stay home and GOP heavy election locations do not open. Dems show up in force on Election Day and in mail in ballots to give Biden decisive landslide. Trump won’t concede.
Sounds to me that a likely scenario is Trump and Barr “announce” in late October the election is being delayed due to COVID safety concerns (which Trump has of course ignored COVID up to this point). Congress clearly asserts its power to squash the idea.
Everything trump touches eventually dies
Yeah. No. That's your wheelhouse. I mean it's got to be tough. You're wrong. About everything. You're stupid but you think you're smart. You imagine yourself a patriot, but deep down you know by supporting Trump you're a traitor. Of course you hate yourself.
Dude. He went to a trump rally, bragged about how he would not wear a mask, caught covid-19, suffered for a month, and died. You idiots are so bent on owning the libs, that you'll dream up conspiracy theories as you die, never admitting you might have been wrong.
Florida Dinah will vote for President Trump again 🇺🇸❤️😀
The GOP wants Melania &amp; Trump, who confuse garish with elegant &amp; gaudy with tasteful, to be in charge of redecorating the W.H.??? How embarrassing.
One thing I can say about President Bush is that I respect him as a person even though I disagree with him politically in every sense of the word.  I can NOT say the same for Trump.
I'm all for Trump but a delay is only prolonging this "rona" hypocrisy
I’m watching John Lewis’ service, listening to George Bush speak. I’m reminded, I didn’t care for him as a president but I love him as a person. I felt the same way about his father. Will anyone say that about Trump?

Just cause I saw something about Trump trying to delay the election, i am pretty sure its in the constitution that there that he would need to be reelected by a specific point in 2020 or come January 20 2021 he will no longer be president and then congress gets to pick a new one
This virus is non-partisan.  Just curious; Trump supporters...Do you still think its a hoax??  Bill Montgomery, co-founder of Turning Point USA, dies  #FoxNews
I suggest moving the election to September 1st!
Imagine if Barack Obama had claimed that the Election was "INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT" before suggesting it should be delayed right before Trump won.  Republicans would have impeached him on the spot.

You forgot to mention it was contracted at a Trump rally where he refused to wear a mask. But then you only play at journalism.
President Trump said Florida is headed in the right direction a couple days ago.  This update goes against that.

Hey Laura, just checking.....when was it that Trump required all reporting run through HHS? Numbers miraculously drop after that date, hmmmm......
Wrong. The radical left declared war against America after the 2016 election of Trump. Actions have consequences. Reap what you sow
I agree with you. Setting up his cult base to start a civil war. Trump is dangerous and it’s not funny anymore. Who is going to stop this craziness? Barr will be behind this also.

as much as I dislike Donald Trump, some of the responsibilities if not most of it goes to Ron DeSantis our lame governor.
Thank you Mr President Trump's.
I think I may vomit. Trump has no leadership ability at all but he does very well at living in a magical world in his mind detached from reality. He has narcissistic personality disorder and he is a sociopath.
Worst 👏🏼 quarter 👏🏼 ever 👏🏼 as a result of the complete mismanagement of the pandemic by Trump. This is the #BiggestFailureInHistory and the people are hurting.

Two days ago Trump stated, "Nobody likes me." Today he suggested that we "delay the election."  If it's not obvious to you what he's trying to do, then you are as blind as a bat.  Our Democracy is at stake and Republicans just hide under the covers like scared children.
Trump wants to delay the 2020 election.  The GOP had better grow a set of brass ones and do it quickly.

I live in the suburbs.  There are plenty of people living in low-income housing.  Most of them voted for Trump in 2016.  Most of them would be homeless if not for “low-income housing.”  Most of them will now be voting Biden in 2020. #SuburbsForBiden
This entire narrative is so moronic but the media is full of morons so...🤷🏼‍♀️. Trump would pack up and live out the rest of his life as a billionaire semi-retiree with the love of his family, vacationing and unlimited golfing. This sounds lovely compared to what his life is now. 🙄
And that's why it's so critical that America get its head out of its ass and give Trump both another term and both houses..

This article was quite a read. The man obviously thinks Trump is a tool but his methodical review of #hydroxycholoroquine was illuminating. Thank you for sharing the article.
Given the Democrat history of trying to corrupt elections..   Trump would be positively foolish to give them a blank check in advance by saying he would never unconditionally accept any of the shit that they manage to come up with in November.

A write-in is prob same as a vote for Trump. In the past it wasn’t as important to vote for 1 or the other, &amp; years ago I actually wrote in in 2 diff elections. But this election is too important to waste a vote on someone who won’t win. Don’t be a coward.
They won’t rig it through mail-in ballots, that’s a fall back. They’re gonna rig it through the media. We get the results from the media. They’ve been claiming now, “will trump accept the results” numerous times. The Media will lie and fake the results.

I grew up Baptist.  I still believe in science.   Herman Cain put his faith in the wrong “chosen one” - Donald Trump.

tRump please let Speaker Pelosi school you
They had a committee of former and top officials talking about what to do if Trump loses and refuses to leave. The interviewee said they have run several scenarios on how to deal with it.
officials identified just 372 possible cases of double voting or voting on behalf of deceased people out of about 14.6 million votes cast by mail in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, or 0.0025 percent.

this is one way to keep from reporting Covid cases  Close down testing test. You sound just like tRump,  if we don’t do testing we don’t have cases
But yet Trump was called a xenophobic for trying to stop it...get mad at those people
When are we gonna get a chance to sit in that court Roman talk about how badd they are I'm getting tired of this trump
Obama was talking like some Crazy Old Preacher today, making no sense as usual, Trump is not trying to prevent folks from voting

Mental check. I’m gay. Very gay. I fully believe in Black Lives Matter ✊🏼! I hate Trump. I can’t stand Trump. Coronavirus is definitely still a thing and won’t go away any time soon.

Trump cuts Florida fundraising trip in half due to Tropical Storm Isaias
Trump finally said something today that I agree with. He said the virus should have been stopped. Absolutely right. It should have been but you were too busy calling it a hoax and saying it would magically go away. Trump is to blame. He had a chance to control it and failed
Did you learn that deflection thingie from Trump? Coz we all know the only election fraud in recent years was done by Republicans.
Andrew Duncomb was stabbed in Portland, the knife narrowly missing his spinal cord. His crime? Being a Trump supporter in #BidensAmerica. Reaction by #BLM ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ ..crickets. #Trump2020 #MAGA
Finally, this man literally thought that Trump insinuating that he wasn’t affiliated w Epstein was proof that he wasn’t like??? So does that meant that everyone who has ever denied being guilty is innocent, too? Or just him? Lmfao and he called ME dumb 😂🤦🏼‍♀️ anyways I’m done
At Lewis Funeral, Obama Lashes Trump and Calls Filibuster a ‘Jim Crow Relic’  Only Democrats would ruin a memorial service  talking about themselves and saying lies and unkind words.  Eight years of this despicable President were hell for  all of us!
Projection. You tried to add back in the defense spending Trump stole on his stupid walk and tried to buy out the FBI. This Republican Administration does Nothing for the people but screw them over and kill them.
Not going down in my Florida either. Trump must have found a new one.
Bullshit. Just like Trump you pull things out out of your ass just because you think it smells sweet. Lewis would never have turned anyone away because he wasn’t that kind.

Had he been like Trump??  For one time??  He could’ve repealed the 22nd Amendment to get a third term.  All we have...are fond political memories.  His words now though??  Resonate as strongly as when he held office.
He's clearly in better shape than Trump.
And I won’t have to dread checking the headlines in the morning to see what stupid stuff trump did.
Promise I’ll go back to my non-political tweets once Trump is out of office and I can think about anything but how our president is corrupt and destroying our country 😊

He’s been by Trump’s side several times pandering on camera. What he’s saying isn’t surprising at all. Gross...but not surprising.
Trump's statements on the voting fraud that's being attempted by the Democrats forces it into the consciousness of the country. This is what he must do to protect all voters. He knows a delay ignites frothing - but he has to fight this battle. Problem = RINOs.
The media scorned Trump when he spoke from the Rose Garden. The Divider in Chief speaks at a funeral and people get tingly.

A person i know told me President Trump would walk away 3 months after he was inaugurated  . This is what makes Democrats so mad . They throw everything at President Trump and he never walked away . Barack is losing it !
Ummmm...the left is literally setting Portland and Seattle on fire as we speak...but yeah Trump?!
Trump IS the last bastion of hope that our country will continue as a Republic....No one is standing strong other than that one man to keep this country together as it is.  He loses, it’s all lost and it wasn’t “an experiment”, it’s the Freedom the world should live under
Once again he uses a funeral to trash his predecessor.  I think it says more about his character than President Trump.
anytime you choose to air President Trump live you contribute to the spread of disinformation.  STOP give him a venue to spread LIES.

What's really incredibly injurious to all Americans is the Democrats could work with Trump and do tons of great deals for America. Trump is a business guy. Results oriented. His economic genius is obvious. His war with China a must. But they just want to insult and cripple him.

The American people are not distracted by Donald Trump's amateurish attempt to employ smoke and mirrors.  We have eyes to see the state of our Union. And in November, we will for damn sure vote to form a more perfect one.
Oh. My. God. 🙄. Yea all ya scientists got together because we just want to fuck over trump. You know, I actually wanted to like trump. I own a business and would like lower taxes. I want to like him. But he says shit that is so scientifically inaccurate &amp; fucking stupid 🤦🏼‍♂️
Donald Trump can distract the media (and Twitter) from today's economic news with nonsense about delaying an election he cannot win.  The jobless are not distracted. Those working fewer hours are not distracted. The survivors of coronavirus victims are not distracted.
Osmosis Jones was definitely one of my FAVORITE movies growing up.  The Mayor sucks and it was really Trump all along.   He is downplaying the virus just like the mayor did so long ago. (19 years?!)
People this is a free country at least for now. If your worried about Covid stay home and don't attend a political rally. Everyone acts like Trump forced people to attend... Really?? Insinuating that Trump killed people for attending his rally is just plain ignorant
How about the people around him did they get it? And I got it he only went to the Trump rally

So Trump says lower risk people are free to enjoy the world and party any way they want, but us American citizens with high risk medical conditions should just suck it up by staying isolated, and suffer depression, even when we are still at risk of infection by delivery drivers

How about we all agree on mail in voting if Biden agrees to debate Trump?  Problem solved.

What this really is - is white supremacy learning to disguise itself within universally passionate issues throughout society (issues that are usually riddled with popular conspiracy theories) - These people don’t care about child sex trafficking (ob-v with the Trump gear)
These people had Blue Lives Matter &amp; Trump gear - 95% of them didn’t have a mask, &amp; also many Anti-Vaxx signs among them. 100% of them White. No black or brown families or children within sight.
Trump doesn’t believe in democracy. It’s pretty clear to anyone with a brain at this point. A vote for trump is a vote for fascism. This is what Hitler did when he took absolute power in the early 1930s.

As Florida reports record increase in deaths for the third day in a row President Trump says "Numbers are coming down, coming down very substantially. They are starting to come down in Florida"
I call fake news. Republicans have proven that when Trump says "Jump!" the Republican response is always "How high?"  The GOP will ALWAYS do Trump's bidding because the GOP is terrified of being mentioned in a tweet.
Trump just threw out a nice little night crawler and all of you that are upset took the bait. He can delay the election with Executive Directive 51. If vaccine testing is pushed back, or if Democrats ban the only known treatment, he should absolutely delay it until voting is safe

It's time once again for Donald Trump to shit out of his mouth. But, then again, when is it not time?
Yes, the dots connect, but that doesn’t mean they lead to right place. There are people who feel wearing a mask is wrong, regardless of what Trump says. Placing someone at a rally doesn’t mean he caught the virus there or refused the mask for any reasons but his own. Just saying.

The good old days when Trump claimed Republicans lose because people put on disguises to vote illegally.  Now he is trying to blame mail-in-ballots.  Republicans lose because we can count. Trump is trying to avoid counting votes &amp; stop you from voting
And yet, he’s kicking Donald Trump’s a** in the poles!!’
That’s basically what’s been happening.  The people who refuse wear mask, without realizing it, are risking their lives for Trump.  My question to each one of them is, aside from hating the people they hate, what has Trump actually done for them?
why why why do you continue to try to rationalize Trump. He and his administration are racist despicable and he’s a dictator wannabe. Nothing to analyze.
I don't think the school stuff has anything to do with anything but this: Kids have been home for the summer. If they have to stay home longer, child care must be accounted for. Even under the best scenarios, parents will want to hand Trump his ass in this election. Kids4votes.

Welcome to the resistance, Steven Calabresi.
Didn't someone once say, "Everything Trump Touches Dies?"
I dont know if I can blame Trump for his death but Trump certainly influenced him to not wear a mask and be in a large gathering. At the same time, he was an adult and is responsible for his own decisions
With the senior population more susceptible to Covid-19, mail-in ballots would actually help Trump. It's not about who's in office. I'm against blanket mailing of ballots to voters whether they requested it or not.
Hand turning in ballots needs to be yelled from the roof tops, especially with a trump sycophant heading the post office
Me second - re-watching Trump press conferences to learn to be more confrontational and blame the press rather than take responsibility. 🤡

The "worst" quarter in modern US history? Really? One that was intentionally, and knowingly done because of a pandemic? One btw that *Democrats* continue to use as a choker on the economy? Right... Trump is the one that's totally done.
We have a functional, mobilized radical left for the first time in 40 yrs. An empowered, emboldened, right wing (thanks to the influence of the Lincoln Project) Democratic Party will be the biggest threat to that. Yes, Trump bad but if Biden loses you can expect huge protests

Convalescent plasma is going to get fast track FDA approval. Trump also just spoke about this. Look at what $KODK just did on his mention. Then think about what kinda moves we’ll get on unique fast tracked treatment. These are 2 of the plasma tickers.

Trump 2020.
Unlike Trump who believes he IS America!
Former President Obama you stooped to a National Low! Taking a jab at our Beloved President Trump during an eulogy for Mr. John Lewis. You know that is going to now be a part of your legacy. Disgraceful, Discussing and Shameful!
Trump’s eulogy of John Lewis would have gone something like this: “I didn’t know John. I get my picture taken with many people. I am told by my advisors he was a great man. A Black man to my understanding. Is that right? So now he’s gone and we’ll just have to see what happens.”
RIP Herman Cain!  You were a man of great integrity and admired by all.  Don’t worry we will get president Trump over the finish line in your honor.
Trump is the master of deflection. Which his “delay the election” antic, is he deflecting from what?
Tony Green admitted that no one wore masks, saying he thought “the mainstream media and the Democrats were using it [COVID-19} to create panic, crash the economy and destroy Trump’s chances at re-election.”
The True “Christian sheep” are not following Donald Trump or any other man. They are following Jesus and the teachings of the Bible.
My blood pressure is rising as i listen to Trump say he can postpone the election, not accept the results, and ruin the USPS so we cant vote by mail! Wtf are we going to do?
Another very valid REASON to be certain you vote for President Trump And never vote for  an illogical 🤑 money media pushed DEM
Trump stabbed Herman Cain, repeatedly, in the ear, with highly virulent ignorant bullshit. That's what killed Herman Cain.
I created this today! Someone else's idea. Will vote for Trump for sure! Look at our choices.
Why isn't #MSM covering this issue instead of giving #trump free air time to perpetuate his ridiculous notion that the 2020 election can be postponed?  just announced it will do so when #trump holds a briefing shortly. SHAMEFUL #DoBetter #GrabYourRemote *click*
They were announcing FROM THE BEGINNING that it was impossible to stop a virus when China was silent and lied till too many infected to stop. It didn't hurt #Trump enuf so keep going... So w/ your logic country should be locked until rushed mandated vaxes are given.?
Just like the NYT’s article about Trump and George Wallace jist happened to be published today when Obama launches the same attack at a funeral service!
Trump won’t admit it, but he won because people hated Hillary. People like Joe Biden this time around, so as long as Trump continues to be Trump, this is going to a crushing win by Biden.
Check out Ben Shapiro on Joe Rogan last week talking about this. Clinton was not ahead of Trump in Texas and It’s showing Trump and Biden within the margin of error IN TEXAS NOW. The local and national polls in 2016 were much more favorable to Trump then than they are now.
I am somewhat the same way.  My issue is with Herman Cain.  Is the world a better place?  Or say it was Trump that died.  Just sayin  If an action saves more lives than it cost.  Or! If it saves the planet?
Not if the Trump virus keeps klling your supporters.

I'm gonna agree with Trump about something. Do. Not. Trust. The. #USPS . If you can vote in person, do it!
This has a stink to it... That RINO stink to hurt President Trump, politically.
At least you’re honest and that’s refreshing. I did not vote for Trump but I can tell you with honesty. I research Biden’s legislative record compared to the laws and executive orders passed by Trump. Biden is a lot worse to Blacks than Trump is. Facts
Yes but listen to Trump talk as well...he hasn't a clue what he's talking about he's so uninformed and chooses to be that way. He slurs and stumbles reading. And come on he just straight makes shit up.
Which is why all this panic about President Trump refusing to leave office is unfounded.

There are Presidents that lead and then there is Trump.

President Trump statement is saying that this will happen if we go to mail in voting.  What the fake news media isn't telling you about this story is presently in NYC they are still counting votes from a primary that happened three weeks ago. This is called delay in an election

You sound like Trump whining about criticism.
He did make his own choices but doing so following his leader who said you don’t have to, this is all just going to disappear.  He made a mistake but Trump is why we have these problems to face. It never had to be this bad with so many dead and ill,that is all on his shoulders.

Sharon do you show these kindergarten psycho killer scrawl messages to the board?   How about saving them and posting them so people can see what a bunch of hateful bigoted trolls many of the Trump supporters are.   I know bigoted and Trump supporter is redundant. Apologies
He along with countless others have fallen victim of a mistake, a mistake of not listening to science and following a corrupt leader who has no idea what he is doing.  Ultimately while maybe not 100% but a majority of COVID deaths could have been avoided if Trump new how to lead.
Of Course they wanted it to look like Trump supporters with doing it. I'll say it again Democrats will do anything they have to to win this election legal or not.
You support Trump?  That's the kiss 💋 of death!  Bye bye Luna.
No matter what you think of Herman Cain, this was another avoidable and unnecessary death due to the ignorance and incompetence of Donald Trump.

Portnoy's interview with Trump was great. Asked legit fun questions and let him answer. Made ppl mad cuz he didn't go in there to be a dick.
Well to be honest Trump didn't force these idiots to come to his rally, they made that choice on their own.

If Trump watched any of it before Obama delivered the eulogy, he would see how much more of a great man, a giant of a man John Lewis was than he could ever be. How much Lewis was respected and loved, deservedly so. Wounds the fragile ego of the toddler in chief.

No. You misunderstand me. Y'all are basically saying that there is no valid criticism of Trump, that it's all just hate. I'm saying that y'all are lazy defending him like that. There's plenty of objective data that Trump's policies are not good for America. #NoHateJustFacts.

Important note: "Trump’s tweet came on the same morning the country reported an economic contraction of 9.5 percent in the second quarter of 2020, an unprecedented recession."

NOBODY forgot about him like they do you!! He's NOT running for President, this is between Trump &amp; Biden NOT the kids, otherwise you, Don Jr, &amp; Ivanka WOULD be in some serious trouble!! Be careful what you wish for, ESPECIALLY being that you're part of the Trump CORRUPTION!!
Then why do so many people of Color Love President Trump . Because they don't want Democrat Communism  !!
See how smart Trump is?  A few liberals floated extending the time to vote and some more pushed for vote by mail (though it's too late to print and mail new materials now).  So he's now got them saying we demand the election be held on time!  LMAO
If you look at David Jolly's voting record, he's as misogynist as Marco Rubio and he NEVER missed a chance to vote against healthcare access for working Americans. I'm not impressed Jolly says mean things about Trump because he shares so many of Trump/Rubio's Republican values.
I am going to sign for my 62 million friends that support Trump proudly.
Herman Cain died from COVID, President Obama is giving a powerful eulogy to John Lewis, Trump wanted to block it by getting on tv, and the Texas congressman said he caught COVID from his mask. Some lead and some are stupid.
Is that how a Trump continues to successfully dodge the virus?
Joe Biden’s beating Trump in Florida — where polls go to die
President Trump suggested that the next round of stimulus checks could be "way higher" than $1,200: "I'd like to see it be very high," Trump said. "I want the people to get it."
Money is usually what drives them, but you’re the one botching this pandemic. I think drug companies dislike you because you dislike science. #Trump #COVID19
Watch "Philly DA Larry Krasner: Trump Is a “Wannabe Fascist.” I Will Charge His Agents If They Break Law" on YouTube
NEWSFLASH to the moron trump: YOU DO NOT HAVE THE POWER OR AUTHORITY TO CHANGE THE DATE OF THE ELECTION! It is sealed into our Constitution! Oh and you’re an idiot!
You lie. America does not love Dr Fauchi. Some folks like him but many do not believe him anymore. He changes his mind too much and is known as Dr Flippin' and Floppin' We ONLY trust Dr Samendi Dr Immanuel and Dr Gold and Pres Trump.
Trump also told Medical Personnel to slow down the testing for Covid-19.
How do you know? Trump don’t like me says a communist. Girl I know communism I lived it for 18 years, I’m better informed than you are all day long. Get back at me with proven facts and then we go from there.
FAKE VIDEO! Made by trump campaign. Liars!
Trump’s suggestion to delay the election is irresponsible and politically disastrous #trumpisaclown
Lmao c’mon feel how you want about Trump but Biden? A better president? He can’t even remember what office he is running for. #VoteGold #Jorgensen2020
So you admit that trump was wrong for calling it a 'hoax', thank God one of you trumPets finally did.   Let me get this right, you're arguing Fauci said a drug that was used for its purpose back in 2005 and not the COVID-19 virus in 2020 works? Well, I'll be damned
He knows that . Have said what he said months ago myself . He can't campaign  because of the China Virus . The first time in American history you have Democrat campaigning out of his basement . The Democrats don't even want Sleepy Joe to debate President Trump ! God Bless Trump !
Barack Obama is throwing so much shade today. Since Trump aced his cognitive assessment, he ought to pick up on it. #JohnLewisMemorial
Via  “Not answering any questions," said Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican said [when asked about Trump’s election tweet].  You called it
Trump is throwing every rotten distraction he can think of at us in a futile effort to reclaim a snowball's chance in hell of being re-elected.  Deep breath. Eyes on the prize, Resisters.
Don’t hold your breath waiting. A dead man has no further value to Trump, especially when dead from Covid-19!
Trump! Because he loves our country and won’t see her be destroyed by the lunatic lefties fueled by greed and power!                   🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸
Don’t forget lawyers... Trump , who has more ongoing lawsuits than anyone in the world calling for law &amp; order is a joke. #TrumpFailsAmericans #TrumpContinuesToLieAmericansContinueToDie #VoteBlue
Please have those two Corinthians go and spend a little time with Trump.
Trump is to blame.
I blame Trump #LoserInChief
Imagine sitting on Trump’s cabinet...
turns John Lewis eulogy into anti Trump rally.  Same Marxist America hater. 😡😡😡
Rioting socialists aren't rioting socialists because Trump said they were rioting socialists and we all know orange man bad.
I believe Vegas would put the odds at 1:1 that Trump will have a signing ceremony backed by Barr and Pompeo where he signs an “executive order” to “indefinitely delay the 2020 presidential election”. It might not be legal or binding but he will do it and the DOJ will support him.
Trump knows that ,he is playing with the Democrat news media .  Vote by mail if not done right  will lead to more people voting than are registered  . Trump will be right as always  .
Too bad he supported Trump at one of his Covid rally’s.
Trump crawling in the whole he slithered out of. I would love it to end at a rally, and he's running his mouth and poof, spontaneously combustion.  #aGirlCanDream
Watch this video: Trump v. Biden. Biden wins.
Who is televising Trump's 'News' Conference?
Should I create a separate account where I rant about politics, how much I hate trump, and how shitty life is so I don’t annoy the people who ar winky here for roblox content.
I worry about trump in moscow. With his infirmities he's likely to fall out of a window.
In what is becoming more painful aware by the second as I watch 3 former Presidents speak- “What the fuck are we doing with this clown called Trump?”
Your statment is factually untrue.  Which would explain your support for #WorstPresidentInHistory Trump - you don't deal in facts, merely in your baseless assertions.  #WorstPresidentEver  #RepublicansForBiden  #Biden2020  #GoJoe
Here in Florida, everybody I talk to including myself will vote for Trump in November.
🙋🏼‍♀️ Yes, and Trump should be put in Twitter Jail! No one should be above Twitter Laws! No one!
should resign before she makes a bigger fool out of herself and her client, Donald Trump.
Trump wants everyone to enjoy the funeral. He won’t send the check until he’s told everyone enjoyed the funeral and they’re grateful to Trump.
Tune in next week for Fantasy Hour with Mika to find out where Trump met with Russian hookers to piss on Obamas bed.

Trump Can’t Postpone The Election, But He Can Delegitimize The Results.
Biden slams Trump for promoting false COVID-19 claims from 'crazy woman’
Is trump a little worried ?
Y'all have the intelligence on your side. Trump knows that. That's why he floats something, b/c he knows it will be argued on the news. He watches. He manipulates everything, and everyone.
Joe Biden says Trump's failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump
The reason I say f*** BLM is right here!
They can try setting the table for #trump, but Nancy Pelosi is still Speaker of the #PeoplesHouse. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
President Trump statement is saying that this will happen if we go to mail in voting.  What the fake news media isn't telling you about this story is presently in NYC they are still counting votes from a primary that happened three weeks ago. This is called delay in an election
Trump floats idea of election delay, a virtual impossibility
1. And yet, SCOTUS hears cases every day that challenge something that is in the Constitution. I'm not saying Trump will be successful. I'm saying that 5 conservative judges can rule to hear the argument.
GOP Lawmakers Don’t Back Trump’s Call For Election Delay
I BELIEVE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVE many more years here with us...i support our president...if CHINA send to us A PLAGUE...WE WILL SEND HER OUR FIRE AND FURY...ONLY PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ELECTED TO BE OUR LEADER IN PEACE OR AT WAR..[[. NOT the weak and traitors CONGRESS]]
Senate Republicans dismiss Trump proposal to delay election
We went from an excellent and very eloquent speaker who cared about the American people, to trump, Jesus what a downfall
Trump and his family (and most his cabinet) have voted by Mail. At one point he also said the election would go on, pandemic or not. He also wants kids back in school and business as usual nationwide because COVID isn’t “serious.” Now that he fears losing, it’s dangerous. Lol...
Trump isn’t so much worried about losing than what happens to him when he loses. He is afraid of jail and rightfully so.  Also members of the family and those who use the “just taking orders” defense should be worried too.
It's going to sting this fake news broke paper like the st pete times when President Trump wins.
The Chart shows black employment, not GDP. As a measure of economic growth, I agree that Trump’s growth is good. However, the conversation. The real median and per capita GDP of the black community has flatlined under this administration.
Surprising no one. trump is a sad, weak, jealous and very small man.
Trump has no authority to delay an election, and the Constitution gives Congress the power to set the date for voting. Lawmakers from both parties said almost immediately there was no likelihood the election would be delayed.
President Trump statement is saying that this will happen if we go to mail in voting.  What the fake news media isn't telling you about this story is presently in NYC they are still counting votes from a primary that happened three weeks ago. This is called delay in an election.
The sad truth is that if Trump had worn a mask, Herman Cain would also have worn one.
I wonder if the Lincoln project could use this in its next Anti-Trump video....
did Hermann  Cane  sign one of the release of liability  forms for the rally? #COVID19 #Trump #POTUS #realDonaldTrump
You better be careful, Ross... you start questioning trump’s buddies and he will promptly remove your nose from his rectal cavity!!
Trump will send millions of kids back to school in the middle of the pandemic, but wants to delay the election because in-person voting won’t be safe??????
They were a different Republican than with a sensible, empathetic leader. Not a power hungry Trump
There WAS a superspreader in TULSA...  THE 8 Trump CAMPAIGN workers cited in most articles Tested positive... Well before the rally  And OK GOV says he thinks He Contracted before the rally As well but would have been pre contagious AT THE RALLY  SOUNDS like a known source
I’ll say it, Trump is a mass murderer
It would take congress (both houses) passing legislation to delay the election. It’d take a constitutional amendment to keep Trump in office past noon EST 1/20/2021
How tf I got all these Trump emails in my spam folder, well at least they being directed to the right place 😂
Sounds to me a little like the GOP in Congress has had enough of Trump and want this nightmare over...
Does  Donald Trump  even know  that  Herman  Cain has succumbed to the Corona Virus? Donald  hasn't tweeted since the news of Hernan's death.  Thoughts and more thoughts.
Multiple felonies?  Fighting back is not a felony  And WHY do you continue to excuse the violence of the MOSTLY PEACEFUL protestors...  Is PARTLY VIOLENT so very acceptable for someone just because they express YOUR PARTY PREFERENCE  (This is YOUR QUESTION... alt-RIGHT BACK AT U)
That is a satire site. Regis did not leave any money to the Trump campaign..
Is discrediting and potentially invalidating a voting right that has existed for decades not interference?  Trump is actively doing this, while accusing dems of coordinating some kind of mail in voter fraud ring with zero evidence.
Lol stop the election Trump is going to lose.
Worth the watch. Wow,  is an asshole. Imagine how he talks to his staff off camera. #TrumpIsNotWell #Trump
Pass it on   Resign Trump
Umm, I learned about trump re-tweeting this doctor's claims from MSNBC.  They refused to show the clip, as its contents were DANGEROUS, and never once mentioned the doctor was black.    How do you have a blue check?  Who are you with this nonsense?
Trump floats delaying the election, but he can't do that
Hope Trump had jam in his pocket because he's toasted with that kind of news
Well said Steve. I hope the Trump base can be open minded enough to see what's happening in this country. I've been "not so nice" with regards to Trumpers, but I sincerely hope they can absorb the current state of this country and make better choices.
Herman Cain will be missed...  If he caught coronavirus AT A rally Will most probably be impossible to prove or disprove forever...  But WE WILL always remember that At the rally...he was telling Americans we cannot be immobilized by FEAR... AND  Continue to be FREE AMERICANS ❤Hehe another #JealousTrumper
Check out this podcast! Trump 2020 Senior Advisor, Corey Lewandowski Covers Elections Less Than 100 Days Out …
So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
Something is missing in Trump. Something essential to being human. Bush made some very bad decisions and listened to some people he shouldn't have. He is a much better ex president then he was a president.
For real? I didn’t know that... wow. Rudy... you should be ashatof yourself. Like trump loves to say “that is nasty”. Lmao. 🤮
He’s the head of the Federalist society and just now says that trump is a fascist?  Wait. Haven’t we known that for three years?  The tweet this more all of a sudden turned him. Pfft.
Everything is a joke that trump says but really what happens when its not a joke none of us will ever believe in this liar in chief for anything. If his lips are moving he's Lying that's DERELICTION OF DUTY TRUMP YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
A definite must read article in The Rachel Maddow blog!😳🤮🤬
Lost the most American lives in recent history. No that was Trump. Worst Stock Market crash in recent history. Trump. Worst GDP contraction, ever. Trump again, Joe.
TRUMP!!!!!!
Nice try, but you’re an enabler of Trump. You’ve do it for 3.5 years....Vote!!!
Since when anybody ORDERS TRUMP anything ??😂😂
A definite must read article in The Rachel Maddow blog!😳🤮🤬
I believe you meant to say Trump is stoking the riots and violence.
I see ! Maybe because he did not recognize President Trump ???🤡
I retired at 61.5!  If President Trump stays, you’)) be fine!

Who cares....MoscowMitch has enabled Trump for 3.5 years. Vote!!! #MoscowMitchMcConnell #TrumpKillsAmericans #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Remember this article.
Pllllease, do some research before voting trump and subjecting the American people to this “person” again. There’s so much information out there that proves he does not care about doing the right thing, or you, or anyone but himself, power and money
Trump needs to give this little fuckrunt the heave ho..
Fox News is NOT news - Pllllease, do some research before voting trump and subjecting the American people to this “person” again. There’s so much information out there that proves he does not care about doing the right thing, or you, or anyone but himself, power and money
Trump is actually already doing it Mr. **** QAnon
LMBO  "Twitter isn't enough space to change minds, I just troll 45." We all have that fam member. Mine is 2K miles away. No 1 ever spoke w/him anyway. The poem on the Statue Of Liberty reads: give me your tired, your poor, etc Trump says: What the heck, give me your deplorables!
Press: “Next, do the Alphabet!” Trump: “There is something called an English alphabet. It’s a very very Patriotic, American Alphabet. Nobody’s seen anything like it before! In fact, I’m hearing China doesn’t even have ONE and we have like 3. 3 is small, but not compared to 0.”
Who the fuck would campaign for Trump?
It’s crazy ironic... #Trump has been obsessing about a wall on the #Mexico border forever (ya know, to keep “them” out).  Now, due to the way the #Trump admin has handled #covid19... Mexico is literally one of the only countries in the world allowing Americans to visit!!
Well  trump hates women also but 43% of white women support him. Explain that to me
Trump tryna delay elections 😅😂

Truly!  Every single one of Trump’s “best people” all lack one other obvious thing, in addition to your list- from Betsy Devos to Herman Cain. Compassion for anyone other than themselves. Not a whit of it anywhere in this administration.
China Virus? I know he died from the "Trump Rallidiocy".
Experts dismiss Trump claim that it could take 'years' to declare election winner
Well, I’m glad you are coming around... please &amp; always, vote... Voting by mail has been done for a long long time and has less than .002% of fraud—the only reason Trump doesn’t want vote by mail is because if people vote, he loses!
The one that pisses me off the worst is Trump 2020...no more bullshit.  As if the last 3 1/2 years have been anything but!
Provided we elect President Trump for 4 more years, we are vulnerable to these rejects all over again in 4 more years!
Why Trump Might Quit  via    I used to think the same thing but now Im convinced that  will dump Pence for Nikki Haley to show he too can have a female running mate
Demand every last BLM protestor, rioter, anarchist, ANTIFA, white, black, brown, red, Covid +, immigrant, DACA, millennial, gay, lesbian, trans, suburban housewife.. whovever. Get out and vote!!! If not, let Trump bash their heads in for the next four years. They asked for it!!!
It’s because those reporters were chosen to ask those questions. Anyone with balls enough to ask about putin bounties or trump’s epic failure on c19 might receive an angry tweet or lose access. Oh the horror.
Don’t you think he was tested before he was allowed so close to Trump? Herman Cain is tragedy but it’s about individual choices.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.
Of course he is. Trump is going to undermine the results and declare himself the winner. Welcome to authoritarian rule! Democracy and the USA is finished.
This is why Donald Trump is president. Racists like this.
Well at least it’ll backfire on trump. His approval was low during the government shutdown.
Absolutely correct, Governor DeSantis sits at the knee of Trump, both must be voted out
Trump does not care about Americans period he’s a socio pathic career narcissist and we don’t need Mary trumps book to tell us that. He’s a career liar .
Trump’s comments on rescheduling the elections convinces me further that he won’t accept the election results if he loses.
Our idiot Governor DeathSantis is listening to his master Trump. He's a darn mini Trump. He's going to get voted out.
Trump’s voter fraud and mail in voting tweets have no evidence. He is supplying false information.
No. I didn't get to make my point. Would you mind listing the things Trump has done if it's convenient?

Y’all gonna vote for trump yet claim you care about child trafficking?!??? WHAT
Too late, he sat by and did nothing while Trump betrayed his oath, our country and allies.
Remember over the spring many “primaries” got delayed/changed to accomodate the shut down. State govs may be inclined to change election dates/mail by dates in an effort to “accomodate” (ie: round up) voters.   Trump knows whatever he proposes Dems will be against. HydroxyC, etc.
That didn't age well.. I don't want to speak ill will of the dead but he was a grown man that chose to ride or die with this hoax and paid for it. he literally died for Trump.
Trump's admiration of dictators probably getting lessons on how to take a democracy to a authoritarian dictatorship using our own judiciary and laws against us.
I believe Trump is responsible for all the COVID deaths
Dana Perino! Wasn't she the press secretary  for Bush? That was the worst administration in history...I mean until the Trump administration
The covid response was a total disaster for Trump. Instead of asserting himself as a strong leader who didn’t prescribe to the mob mentally he went along with the narrative from the shutdown imbeciles and lunatics. If anything is going to be his undoing it will be this.
Pogue is a Trump hater. Berenson must not have been a very good reporter  #hydroxychloriquineworks
Love this shirt! Got it from  #share #viral #Trump2020 #Trump #trumppresser
If Trump calls Portland protesters a "beehive of terrorists" then what do we call his Cabinet???
I actually do get along with him. We just disagree on Trump. Thanks for your input, I feel like a much more fulfilled human being. Don't forget to inject bleach against COVID-19 and protect yourself at night from demon sex..
I don’t think there’s any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
Don't believe this guy; he's as anti trump as they come. "Science" is trash when the analysis is designed to come out a certain way.  #hydroxichloroquine
save the USPS. Trump will defund until there is no mail at all.
Trump said that he could shoot somebody and they'd still support him. Well he didn't need a gun in this case.
That reasoning never crossed Trump’s mind.
Pogue is an anti-trump with 100s of anti-trump tweets, including disparaging tweets about Sarah Sanders.  Which means his "analysis" has ZERO credibility. He has a clear agenda.  #Hydroxychloroquine
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally where he likely contracted COVID. No mask. No social distancing.  Stupidly following Donald Trump in denial of the virus... #TrumpKillsAmerica
He said it.   The most RIGGED ELECTION ever. Mr. Putin. Can you hear me??  Donald J. Trump is the most DISGUSTING excuse for a human and those who still support him.

Good thing Herman Caine knew the Lord and is in the presence of a Holy God. Herman was a grown man. Since he had cancer he knew the risk&amp; made his own mind. So don’t blame Trump.
Remember Republicans were the ones who fought against every election integrity bill! Follow their money to Diabold who makes the voting machines. It all comes together as to WHY they are so terrified with mail in voting.they need to cheat to win. FUCK TRUMP
Again, it’s trump saying something without doing something. Bark vs bite. Amazing people haven’t figured that out yet. Everyone calm down.

I rarely, if ever, swear in public, Twitter or Facebook. But I find myself swearing at the TV when GOP goons like Gym Jordan, Doug Collins, Mnuchin, Nunes, and, of course, their Idiot-in-Chief Trump open their mouths. No one else makes my blood boil as much as they do. 😖 😡

Sorry, that makes no sense whatsoever. People die in pandemics, and b I'm sorry fur your loss. However, while Obama acted decisively to fight against H1N1, Trump has done the exact opposite. He has countered and maligned the very people he should have been listening to along.

Trump is such a child. President Bush gave a eulogy at John Lewis‘s funeral even though John Lewis didn’t go to Bush’s inauguration because of the Al Gore/BUSCH recount election. Trump didn’t even pay respects to Lewis when he was lying in state in the Capitol. Not presidential.
4 years ago :
Well almost 4 years in , we know Donald J Trump is not an elected official ! he was placed in office by the Russians. #DonaldTrumpIsIllegitimate
Trump doesn’t care if more of his voters vote by mail. Trump doesn’t care if vote by mail is popular. The best opportunity Republicans have to suppress the vote is by reducing the number of urban voting sites where voters can vote. That’s the plan!
First of all, Pomeo’s smirk aside, he’s clearly not in in “the joke”, secondly, didn’t Trump tell us recently he “doesn’t kid”?
Analysis | Trump’s Four-Pinocchio interview on Russian bounties By Salvador Rizzo
You honestly believe there is no possibility of voter fraud with millions of ballots floating around?   What if GOP wins, are you still going to take that position?  Is this exactly why Trump is making these statements? To take away Left arguments of “fraud” once he wins?  🤭🤔🧐
Trump should say that breathing air is good so the dems stop
I have sleep issues, but they're more likely caused by my spending too much time on Twitter rather than worrying about the pandemic! 😳 🙄 And my addiction to Twitter is totally the result of following the resistance to Trump's disastrous administration. 😡
, my pleasure. President Trump must be reelected!
All of those points he Trump wants to but the Dems won’t let him
So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you’re proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain’s death was a result of YOUR negligence.
Republicans against Trump
Republican Voters against Trump. I believe she’s in Ohio.
History will remember Donald Trump in one way and one way only: as an accessory to the murder of tens of thousands of Americans. And amazing legacy
I don't think so loll trump is done
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! 😎

Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
Your right it’s just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Thank you! He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally. He said (in caps): "people are fed up". He was a selfish pig. I save my sadness 4 the innocent pple who died because of them. The chickens have come home to roost! Ana is not rude just factual!
. is a partisan hack. And a Trump-sucking sycophant. And an asshole.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
Thanks to Trump and his corrupt leadership for our country going through this terrible epidemic Virus! All Trump cares about is his real estate and his selfish needs to be against the Medical professionals that we have to unite as a country to get this Virus out! Trump👎🤥
Why not flip flop it would extend your demise. If you support trump you’re a racist.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
Or goes to jail... Cain was a big boy. He, along w/ Trump &amp; the rest of the goons, have caused many innocent people to die. He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally &amp; said that "people are fed up" (in caps). They deleted it today.

Hey Palmer, maybe you could help me with this question... at the end of August 2016 Hillary was leading Trump in almost every major poll and we all know what happened at the end... how can we be sure that’s not going to happen again?

Today Trump suggested delaying the election. Obama was reinforcing John Lewis' belief "When you see something that is not right, you must do something," "Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part."
And Trump voters are conservative, so what does that make him? Your claim was specious and an attempt to discredit the original point, which is that by and large Republicans and far right groups are the biggest pushers re: reopening/masks are ineffective/covid conspiracies.
I highly doubt that! This right here is what the Democratic Party has become. Vote them all out!  🇱🇷TRUMP 2020🇱🇷

U act like Biden hasn’t said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...

Donald Trump.
Right, because when Lewis boycotted BOTH Bush's and Trump's inaugurationa he was working to bring people together?
You have to keep in mind that Trump's biggest supporters are Nazis &amp; white supremacists.  These people love his racism.  He's one of them.  Has anyone ever checked his closet for his white hood &amp; robe?
No it’s in the constitution that both houses must approve it first.  The spanish flu was worse more deaths it didn’t get postponed. Trump definitely cannot do it.

No one cares about Mad King Trump and he's going to whine about that all over again the next chance he gets.  The spotlight needs to be on him every minute.
Yea and I’m sure the 8 Trump campaign staffers who contracted COVID shortly after the Tulsa Rally must’ve gotten it from somewhere else too. Regardless I guarantee that he and those around him did not wear masks or take the virus seriously which still makes it ironic and foolish
I saw Barack Obama‘s eulogy for John Lewis and felt pride. I listen to President Trump every day and feel shame. What have we become?
Trump is quite literally killing his supporters. #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Let me go back and tell my patients with endometriosis that Trump supports a wackjob doctor that believes demon sperm are the problem. I bet you believe that too because your fake God does and you people only believe what he believes
Could never deliver a Eulogy like any of these three men.  While we agreed with them all regarding policy, we knew in our hearts that they cared about ALL Americans, not just their own party.  Trump doesn't have the intelligence or humanity Obama does.

Sleazy and dishonest? Trump fucked a sex worker, forced her to sign an NDA, then had his attorney threaten her with legal action all while his wife was pregnant!
This entire line is unbelievable.  No one could make that shit up.  What this moron rambles about is so out of touch with reality, than I can only understand how he can do it by virtue of reading Mary Trump’s book.  What a disturbed sociopath!

I’d walk through a crowd of psycho clowns, barefoot, on broken glass, in a hurricane, with Grateful Dead music playing non-stop it’s to vote against Trump.
It will be a challenge for the people as well. We can only hope the Republican leadership in the Senate &amp; House put country first &amp; make it clear to Trump his show is cancelled &amp; if he doesn’t go quirely they will bring impeachment charges against him. There is plenty of cause.

Yep. I live in Switzerland and this is exactly what’s happening.-you can only get a test if they suspect COVID. Luckily, Trump is ramping up testing so fast, the fake case numbers will soon exceed the population number
So are you saying that historically we've NEVER had a delayed election should prevail?   Do you think Trump should be able to override the Constitution?
Why did Trump himself do an absentee vote?
Honest ? Please don't insult our intelligence.  You have deaths of Americans on your hands . Do you think Trump has learned his lesson yet ? We have . You are so going to lose
Yes, and it begins the day Trump and Pence leave the White House for good.
Trump can't delay the election but he would if he could. That's a problem. So is his ignorance.  And his chaos-mongering.
Or, if trump wouldn’t have held a foolish rally...
Given Trump’s utter disregard for the law and his lustful emulation of dictatorships it’s easy - and frightening - to see how he would do anything to retain power.
The Trump phenomenon is part of a larger zeitgeist, the rise of authoritarianism and decline of democracy around the world. This book addresses that trend. Hope it's good!
….it's what you get when you follow a President that doesn't believe in science. Caine probably picked up the virus at Trump's rally in Tulsa. So, don't claim Trump to be some innocent in all of this. His failed leadership says otherwise.
Trump's mishandling an unpreparedness of the pandemic definitely makes him responsible. He should have been telling people to wear a mask and practice social distancing long ago. Instead, he encourages businesses to open too soon, resulting in another wave of Covid-19.

Trump cannot delay the election without changing the Constitution. He was elected to a 4-year term which ends on Jan 20, 2021... if for some reason the election is contested or the results challenged, the Speaker of the House will take over until the next President is sworn in.

Another diversion to stop the public from seeing today's economic report. Mr. Trump you alone cannot change the  voting date, didn't even happen during the civil war.  Sorry sir, your contract is up in November. Sorry!
There is nothing more dangerous than a narcissist exposed. Trump will do anything to insist he must be president. Anything.

make a statement on election delay. Stand up to trump. Delay elections in the United States and your not saying a word.
Trump floats delaying the election...   via   Trump is grooming his followers to accept a coup as a necessity. Anyone who is against Trump hates America.  Lincoln suspended civil rights, why not Trump? Right out of the authoritarian playbook...

Trump will do whatever he can do to steal the election and stay in power, including "delaying" the vote as is mandated by U.S. law to be done by a specific date. This is how dictators take power.  Wake up people, before it's too late!
Of course. Trump sees his Presidency circling the drain, especially after the horrendous reports on the economy this morning. This is the kind of stuff Tyrants do.No.  However I will vote for trump in Nov. along with many others that also haven’t participated in the polls.
Governor Abbot can you please tell me why when Oresodent Trump was here there were many pictures of him and many guest/supporters without mask? I understand you are Republican but please expect the same requirements of all people in our state and especially visitors.
Should I care that he has confirmed what I have been saying for years. What has divided me from my family, who are now members of his cult-like base. Fuck him.   Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
He is a #placeholder. The VP pick is really the one intended to be the Maoist Communist Democrat President. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #DemocratDisease #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin #Trump
I would like to see Rice as Secretary of State. She would be Stellar in healing and repairing the wounds with our Allies that trump caused with his stupidity.
he may have.. if he survived, it would have been Trump's rallying cry.  Gym Jordan on the other hand has said he is taking it.. so let's watch him either get better or die.
You’re drowning dude, more and more with each insulting post. We get it. You hate Trump. That’s fine. We don’t care, not me, my wonderful President nor his millions of loyal supporters (including the many at my favorite pizza parlor).
Trump's been reported 100 times today
Hey all you leftist idiots and fake news, Trump never said bigly. He’s been saying Big League for years and years. As in China has been ripping us off Big League for years. Just figured I’d correct your imbecilic stupidity again. #Trump2020MuthaFu*ka

Fumbled. Saved the American auto industry, health care for 20M, longer sustained job growth, longest continuous stock market growth, longest period of GDP and middle class income, killing of OBL, greatest reduction in unemployment rates and. Yeah. Fumbled.
And then get the rest of the Trumpians politicians out too before we get another Trump wannabe to run for president again.

Fact Black lives matter formed under obama, where was Blm under obama, where was Joe biden....oh yes thats right silent. When you get the vote its your responsibility to make change, the change happening now wasn't happening, sure trump has no hand in the change, but 50 years.
It is a little weird that this election is just Trump vs. Trump

Even when trump says good things like donating plasma people will try to turn it into a negative.
i’m all for getting trump out of office but the fact y’all said “give me biden” is trash and exactly why our political party system is beyond flawed

I understand. Shame we didn't meet sooner. I've been complaining about him since fall of 08 when Hillary's lawyer, Phil Berg, first brought up Mr  O's status. When he released his "birth cert" (in response to TRUMP'S challenge), we went to town pointing out multiple errors. ☹️☹️
Democrats always take the bait. And he pinned the tweet.  Next trump will say no voter ID.
Trump is scared he will lose the genera election to Biden with his poll numbers. In his press conference he cited sources such as  saying there are potential problems in voting by mail. He does not hold the power to delay the election. Congress decides date.
Trump cannot do that. We need to vote on time and without drama......like Americans! We must now prove to the free world that we are not a fucking joke. Trump is walking on dangerous ground

What about a womans right to choose abortion? This has been attacked constantly. Also, Trump is a known woman degrader.
When Trump goes to prison, he'll drag all his republican cronies right with him!!!

I have been wondering how he was doing, but hadn't heard anything at all. He was a sweet, kind, funny, smart, giving man &amp; this here I hate to say it, but it is clear that not all Black Lives Matter. This disgusting human woman has spewed her nastiness for years about Trump &amp;
Vote Trump. It’s really that simple.
You trying to get trump a brand new FBI building what the fuck that got to do it relief
There are thousands of Americans dead today that would not be if Trump were even just plain stupid, but he is NEXT LEVEL Stupid. You are proof that Trump could shoot someone and not lose a vote. You excuse all of his corruption, lies, incompetence to call him the best. Best?🤣
I’m talking about Trump
That’s a lie the intelligent agent found out this was true this was bought to Trump desk back in spring and he done nothing
On one side, Trump cheats by asking adversaries to meddle and using his office to make it hard to vote. Then, he tells his followers the election will be filled with fraud (not his). By destroying trust on both sides, he’s truly wrecking democracy.
Isn't it weird, maybe just a strange coincidence, I don't know, that some people have used Trump to improve the legacies of people Like GWB but not President Obama?
What's scary is that Trump today suggested "delaying" November elections and you and your fellow GOP sycophants will support this betrayal of democracy because you're more motivated by your fear of kompramat than by a love for and loyalty toward our country. Shame!
I am so sad to hear Herman Cain passed.  We should have elected him President.  9/9/9 was a great plan, I think he was the friendlier version of what we got with Donald Trump, he had the same conservative principles but he just made you smile.  RIP Mr. Cain you will be missed.
What an absurd example of the audacious ignorance of Trump supporters. Ignorance in two profound senses. Literally "not knowing" basic American history, civics, and on and on. But also ignorance as acts of "ignoring." Ignoring basic civility, decency, and even reality.
Proof Trump is a Fascist.  But , he won’t get away with it #JohnLewisHomegoing #Obama speech lifted us up, called us to action and I am ready to fight for Our Sacred Democratic Republic #TrumpThreatensAmerica #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
They call Trump a racist because they are and claim he's a Nazi...  ...They lie!

Trump is trying to distract from the GDP numbers. He has no power to delay elections. This man has dealt with tabloids his whole life, outlandish statements to switch focus is a trick he uses all the time. Don’t fall for it media.
I miss President Obama so much.  Watching all three POTUS hurts grieving how far Human Decency has fallen since trump and his MAGA took over #JohnLewisHomegoing #JohnLewisRIP
I've voted both parties in my lifetime and the current Dem. party is full of satanists.   Trump is hated so much because he's trying to stop it.   I'm a Christian and Trump stands with God.  Learn more and stop watching the lies on TV.  May God bless you.
Trump’s a afraid and that’s all it is. trump afraid he wants the power. trump doesn’t care, get it through your head he doesn’t care about you.
It's past the point where when things like this happen supporters will be saying things like the reason it happened was because the person didn't REALLY support trump or embrace trumpthought whole heartedly enough
Clearly targeting the secret Trump supporters
Stop it...democrats worked non-stop to destroy GW &amp; ridiculed him daily. Ditto for Reagan. ONLY revisionist history now w/ Trump. You are lying. You just upped the 24/7 negative twists &amp; lies 100x w/ Trump. It is all about still pouting over losing.
Donald tRump, you have already embarrassed the USA!!! You are outta here.....
TRUMP NEEDS TO JUST SEND IN THE MILITARY
Trump's hero
The smell of desperation is as pungent as ever coming from #Trump now....
Wow: Obama just completely ethered Trump in less than 30 seconds, without even saying his name, and then continued on about his business. That is some Mack the Knife type shit... #SDHsez
HECK NO !!!  My Mom is still alive ( Thank God ) and still a Republican , she wrote in Kasich in 2016 , but is voting Biden this year. My Father hated Clinton with a livid passion- he would have hated Trump the same way, for the same reasons. Disrespect for the office and lies
This is a scary but possible scenario that Trump could employ to steal the election. Please read and contemplate - then act by voting for Biden.
Man woman person camera tv. I guess that about sums up Trump’s remarks
#Trump just now calling on the WH press corps to assemble....
If you're saying that FB needs to stop silencing conservatives, I counter that my work takes me to so many far-right corners of FB that I find it impossible to believe there's widespread bias against conservatives on the platform. Just search for Trump then click groups. 2 of 2
He had survived a Stage 4 diagnosis from 2006. The current year is 2020. That is a delta of 14 years. Cancer and the treatment left him immunocompromised, which made him more susceptible to COVID-19. It was probably the COVID that got him, which may be from Trump Tulsa Rally.
Until trump issues an EO and uses the courts to stall.
I suggest you ask the American people what they want!  We don’t want to honor Confederates.  You and Trump’s position is racist and is on the wrong side of history.
Adult Temper Tantrum Syndrome. Whatever it takes to stay in office, right Dump? Dems, Reps, and others have successfully been voting by mail for YEARS.
Your ok with trump walking in on children getting dressed and then bragging about doing it. But against what is obviously two consenting adults, one of which is a masseuse. Typical republican sicko.
Any odds on #Trump trying to interrupt this?
I’ll give Herman Cain the same respect trump gave John Lewis
Blacks for Trump has got to be one of the most senseless groups in the known universe.
Well we know it’s not  a blacks for trump Rally
"which he almost certainly caught at that Trump rally" Thank you Dr. Bell. Where'd you go to med school by the way?
I predict #Trump will pull something to interfere with President Obama's remarks...hope I'm wrong....
. breaking ranks with #Trump has started.....
This could have been us, #Jacksonville. We dodged death by not having the #rnc2020 in our city. RIP, Herman Cain, part of the #Trump death toll.
I mean are we ACTUALLY surprised trump is trying to delay the election?
. starting to feel the heat from #Trump's destructive aura....
People of Greensburg are yelling "4 more years" for Donald Trump.   This is what we as a city have to realize and all minorities around have to understand what we are up against come November.   Voting is a MUST.
Then he went to a trump rally. Now he’s dead.
Well it is bullshit and you know it. It has been proven effective. What is YOUR agenda FDA. Does Trump now need an investigation into FDA for accuracy?
#MoscowMitchMcConnell making his move to distance from #Trump was so predictable....he wants to save his political rear end.....
I think we've been fooled. Nobody is going to jail except Trump and his supporters after the commies steal the election and take control of the military.
Trump making your kids go to school in the middle of a pandemic just for the economy
Daily reminder Trump doesn't know anything and can't adequately run the country.
If I was talented like  , I'd be writing a new version of "The night they drove old dixie down"  I got the first line: Herman Cain is my name and I jumped on Trump's gravy train...
Oh, BTW, Trump CAN'T delay the election or he will have more protests that his fake fed militia won't be able 2 handle!
That’s facts Trump keep ya head up 99% of America is behind you we love you and thank god your our President 🇺🇸2020🇺🇸
I would argue Trump et al deserves primary credit for Cain's death as well...
You'll go back to licking Trump's balls in an hour or so.
Trump killed him.
Trump killed him.
Trump country USA 🇺🇸 2020 💯🇺🇸🇺🇸
I think Trump realize he will lose and that the time is coming that he loses his freedom!!! He is getting nervous now
A recession from what I hear. tRump has blown up everything that Obama pulled us out of that he inherited from Bush !!
What makes Trump good for Americans 😂😂😂
Can I tell you something maybe you don’t know Donald Trump been president for 3 1/2 years I am just going to let that sit there
Have you ever heard about Russian collusion? That story was a hoax. Covered endlessly.  CNN pretends Trump didn't immediately say "and I'm not talking about the neo Nazis and white nationalists, they should be condemned completely" after he said fine people. Lies.
What a load of shit. 1st, when you went to that rally you all agreed that you were willing to die for Donald Trump. 2nd sitting beside someone doesn't mean anything unless your identical twins. 6 months into this, we've learned alot &amp; the most important thing is to wear a mask.
You said Herman died from going to a Trump rally. I contested it and refrained from mentioning how disrespectful it was but now-I just did. Got a comic strip to finish. God Bless Herman Cain.
Trump call White moms and dads terrorist Black people SOBs voter suppression...
Black people say that all the time if you vote for Trump yo ass not black it’s in every neighborhood right now
Possibly. But I think Trump and Biden both are in different stages of it. We dealt with dementia with my in laws and the signs are there. More so in Biden but Trump definitely as well.
😂😂😂 Trump a rapist😂😂😂 what the fuck😂😂😂
not ariana goin for trump’s doctor’s gig 💀💀💀
Trump needs to step in, release him from his sins
After Joe Biden picks his VP,it will be a Trump Landslide win anyway,the Dem fraud will be a wash
After Joe Biden picks his VP,it will secure a Trump Landslide and win,and best of all another 4 years,l would want no other for the economic recovery!

It's a mutually beneficial interest with Germany. Trump is demanding the agreed upon contribution. And the USA can use other locations like Poland.
The book will Discredit 45, I don’t think Bill Clinton has that much to fear. He’s in there along with countless others. trump has said they are best friends.
My representatives are so far up Trump's ass they can count the number of burgers he ate yesterday. So, I'll be voting them all out.
To hell with Trump.
I personally think trump is using code talk for his followers so they will guarantee mail-in voting is a complete fiasco.
Jimmy Carter would be there if he could! So that would be FOUR POTUSES - and NO trump!
The run from #Trump is starting.  When it becomes a stampede it will be glorious...
A good man, regardless of his political affiliation, has died. Why must you try and make everything about your hatred for President Trump? #shameful #HermanCain

“Minutes after news broke that US GDP fell by a record 32.9%, President Trump fired off a tweet suggesting that the US presidential election be delayed over mail-in voting.  “Only the US Congress can change the date for the general election for president.”
Yep outta dere! You know he got sick right after that damn trump rally.
And pandemic...still stands by Dr. Demon Semen &amp; Alien DNA b/c she supports him...no other reason. COVID-19 is no biggie for u or our kids, teachers but the Senators who refuse to wear masks who are now Covid positive are certainly kept away from trump. So it’s dangerous to him.
Trump's next post: THIS SPACE FOR SALE
actually, he ended his tweet with a question mark. that would mean it was a question. To much anti-trump propaganda going.
They are illegal but no one will call Trump out for it.
Dems blaming Trump for this virus. It's China that's to blame.

Sarcasm opposed to insults is my response to the idea that the man died from attending a Trump rally -in "two weeks". C'mon man, that's some serious conspiracy theory. Of all those people he died and it's proof of what? I have no idea. rock on young man.
Uh huh. You have ZERO answers for my questions but u want to tell me abt truth. Here’s truth. Military spending was GREATER during Obama. Pay raises for military were larger. Plans &amp; budgets to upgrade military equipment were already in place BEFORE trump

What does it say that even #Trump and his lackey and bootlicker were not invited to speak at John Lewis' funeral but George W. Bush was.  Trump and Pence are in a political isolation that has never been witnessed before....

I disagree. Trump would LOVE a black woman to run against. It's perfect to escalate his racist dog-whistles.
It's not that surprising when a man who is at risk for the virus, dies of the virus after POTUS encourages him &amp; others to attend a rally that will spread the virus. This isn't rocket science, stop defending the dummy that is this President. Stop being Trump's cult follower.
Herman Cain was a 74 year old cancer survivor. He attended a rally that every health official says shouldn't have happened, was a super spreader event. The rally only happened because Trump's ego, he literally died for Trump's fucking ego.

Actually trump is the worst.  You have quite a short memory🤣
I think part of it- no matter how vapid it may be- is that, especially after 4 years of Trump people want someone in power who is generally not an asshole and doesn’t seem to get off on owning the libs. In the absence of actually good policy it’s the 1 thing to look forward to
Donald Trump should resign.  Pass it on.  Today would be a good day to resign.
let’s focus on getting you out of the senate along with the remainder of your Trump ass kissing cronies. #blm#nevertrump
RD couldn’t remove his tongue from Trump’s sphincter long enough to eat a slice
What do you mean there were millions old aboriginal caves with drawings??? What where?? Just like tRump, desroy black people.
The Trump people can all stay at home on Nov 3 if it makes them feel better.
Yea that’s smart vote for a guy who has been in politics for 49 years 8 being a VP and has done shit for anyone. Real smart buddy it’s funny how a guy like Trump has been there for 3 years and gets the blame for everything when everyone else has been there a lifetime lmao#TRUMP
Good question! Also, who owns it now? Is it a Trump property?
When I saw the video of Cain and the black trump supporters at the rally looking so proud to be there, I thought how sad, and that some of them would most likely tbe the first to die. I wonder if trump even cares, being the racist that he is.
Only Congress can do that. tRump has no power to do it !!
Cain attended Trump's indoor rally in Tulsa, sharing photos of himself not wearing a mask. Several others who attended the rally subsequently became sick including the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr. Six Trump campaign staffers also tested positive.
I suspected It might Victoria, but tRump/Pence would have to leave office if the election isn't held before 20 January, R's up for relection in the Senate would gone, the D's would be the majority, a Dem would be Pres until the election is held !!
"Anyone that doesn't agree with me or critiques Trump is a communist leftist hack"

Diamond, Silk, Candice Owens, Ben Carson, Herm Cain.  Wait, did this just cut Trump’s total black support by 20% 😳
Trump is treading water and about to go under.
Trump openly calling to delay the presidential election in which he currently trails his opponent by double digits. I'm not even a little surprised.
The situation with Herman Cain is so sad. A man with a wife, kids, and grandkids, dies. And y’all celebrate death and are GLAD the dude died all because he didn’t wear a mask and likes trump. Twisted ass way to think
HELL NO.  The sooner we get rid of  the faster Mr. Biden can get on with the job of fixing what Trump broke.

He will just leave and make his Trump News Network like he planned all along.
Herman Cain died of COVID-19, let's remember right before he tested positive he tweeted some anti-mask messages and was at Trump's Tulsa rally, where he probably caught/spread the virus. This guy died for his dumb political opinions.
Two Weeks??? Irrefutable: had to be DEATH BY TRUMP RALLY. I just hope the virus spares the throngs lined up to pay respects to John Lewis.
President  has floated the idea of postponing the election, tweeting, "Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???"
I wonder if Trump is going to mention Herman Cain’s name today.
He died after contracting Covid from the lame Trump Tulsa Rally
The drinking game "Spot a Mask at a Trump/Pence Event" won't get you drunk unless you play the video in a loop.
you all play like you love America but you don’t when you say nothing about Donald Trump letting our troops die from Putin
Herman Cain has died. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 approximately two weeks after attending trump’s failure of a rally in Texas. Have there been any other deaths after that rally?  Every thing trump touches dies in one manner or another. To hi family, I am so sad for you.
Whatever trump does, the left does the opposite. Watch.
Coach has an excellent point here. Sure, we all want #Trump out of office, but do we want Pence to follow in Ford's footsteps? Who knows what modern marvel he could make with our technology. I for one am afraid of the concept of Pence's Ultrachristian Laser Supercars, for example
If Trump didn’t want it he’s so darn silly because he facilitated a situation for it to happen knowing the risks. Not out of malice just pure old man stupidity.
He gave his LIFE for TRUMP! 😳🤷🏽‍♀️ #TrumpIsUnwell #TrumpVirus
He died for Trump's ego, as many have. How many more will die?
So...  Last picture in public of Herman Cain is here, at a Trump rally around a bunch of people with no masks on:  RIP to a Boilermaker, and please please please let this be a wake-up call to any doubters.
Has anyone ever accused you if being a partisan hack which helped lead to the near destruction of our Republican by enabling man with authoritarian wet dreams. Trump was clearly unfit for office and volunteered enough info to be removed from office.

Herman Cain dead at 74 of Covid19. He was at Trump’s rally in Tulsa June 20 with no mask.
His cause of death is clearly the result of attending a Trump rally. How terrible that this virus killed this particular man while sparing so many others.

Andrew, you are a very good person. I used to be much better than I am now. It seems as if some of the gop-trumpy attitude has eroded the old me. I hope to get back to being me ASAP, but sadly, I think I am going to have to see trump &amp;  out of town first.
Every campaign says their internal polling looks good. You know how you can tell if a campaign's internal polling actually looks good? They're falling all over themselves to release it publicly. How many internal polls has the Trump campaign released?

I don’t know why Trump tweets crap like this. It just opens him up to more unwanted and unneeded criticism.
I love this, they fall for it every single time, every single day. Trump knows it too, which makes it even funnier to me! We all sat here &amp; watched as the Democrats asked AG Barr if the President had the authority to move the election day &amp; everyone heard him say no.  I love how-

All Trump has to do is declare martial law because of the lawlessness going on with protestors nationwide and he can suspend elections indefinitely.  Idiots are playing right into his hands
Media should be hounding every single Republican lawmaker and candidate from Soil &amp; Water to the US Senate about whether or not they support Trump’s idea to delay the election. I’ll get started. Thoughts  Do you think mail in ballots will lead to massive fraud?
Dear pundits about to explain Trump can’t postpone election because Constitution and Congress — criminals and dictators break laws and rules al the time, everywhere, thoroughout history. We’re not exceptional shining city on the hill unless we (and our military) all agree to be

I can send you lots of peaceful people being attacked for supporting the Police or the POTUS. 1 black elder just recently killed. There are hateful people every where. That had nothing to do with Trump, you don’t like him, fine. But this country is immeasurable better under him.
It wouldn't help him anyway. As long as enough states hold elections and those states comprise 270 electoral votes, Biden is sworn in. If not, then the Speaker of the House is sworn in.  There is no path for Trump remaining president no matter how much he tweets.
Wild to me that GOP politicians are so beholden to Trump that they are ok with him flushing down their decades long mail in voting advantage.
WRONG!! Trump hasn't caused havoc, DEMOCRATS and the bogus, lying MSM have caused havoc constantly attacking him and lying, the Mueller investigation, impeachment sham over nothing. EVERY problem has been because of their bulls**t and lies!!

Why am I seeing ad's for Terrorist Trump on social media? Do I not post my disdain enough? Should I read even more articles on his numerous inadequacies?  To my FBI agent or cookie bots- tighten up.
How do i get off MAGA twitter. Why is everything they recommend to me support trump.
This is a result of your guy, Trump, fucking up the response to the virus. Then pushing to reopen before states had dealt with the health crisis.
they rigged the election in 2016? Usually the people rigging an election don't lose. God, Trump people are absurdly stupid

I agree. Trump cannot do anything like walk down a ramp, drink water, go out without his makeup and girdles. His handlers can’t handle his mouth and they certainly can’t control his evil mind. The silent majority IS watching. 👀👁👂

My two cents, it’s all about the early track. 12z Euro took the early track “around” the islands 🌴.  Interesting to see 00z Thursday does when it comes out at 2AM EDT.  My guess is, back over the entire coastline of Hispaniola, weaker and west track returns.
Do you believe Trump did not know the troops was being killed by Russians
Tell that to the troops Trump letting get killed right now by Russia U  next can’t you see it
Those like Hannity will do anything to divert attention away from the failed President Donald Trump.

4 US Soldiers also died under Trump several weeks after he took office. Quickly covered up! Why?

Question so you OK with trump letting Russia kill our troops

Let me tell you in my county in FL people have been telling me same thing I voted trump in 2016 and now I dislike some of what he does but I will NOT vote for Biden or democrat. People overwhelming are confident in Trump some won’t say it right away but it’s clear he will win!
People might not love trump but you also don’t want a Democratic Party taking back over either right? I’ve been listening to people in clay county, they are voting Trump again some don’t like everything but nobody is perfect but  you’re refreshing and have my vote!
People who are not sure whether to vote for  let me give you some insight, watching my county, I have listened to a lot of people and all voted for trump in 2016 and all will be voting for him again why because Biden is hell to everyone! The dems included!

Trump reported incorrectly what the Federal Government is doing with respect to Portland. He is demanding that the Governor &amp; Mayor bend to his fascist rule or he will do it for them. Too* complicated to discuss in a Tweet, but bad leadership by Trump (definitely on purpose!)

I no longer follow  I will respect him from a distance because he is a man of God. There have been lies spewed. President Trump NEVER said we shouldn’t wear mask, I’m also interested in what cons he has done. I don’t like hearing such nasty insults from the pulpit.
Could be because no one is driving because Trump handled COVID-19 so poorly that everyone has to stay home.
All Trump &amp; DeSantis had to do was save the day, a crisis is automatic re-election for competent people in charge. These guys fucked up, and it's so obvious yet here you are still licking their boots like a good little cult member?

M-A-L is not on the books as residential, so Trump actually committed VOTER FRAUD!
Oh. My. God. Can it be? I feel the rapture going through me and not lifting me up because hell no. All because Trump told a truth for once!!
Obama looked generally mad today at #JohnLewisFuneral , he’s desperate to really let loose on Trump.
Dear Señor Trump: I believe is the FIRST TIME you read something about the more than 150,000 dead Americans.   I couldn’t find any previous words of empathy.   It is clear to me that you do this because you lost the battle. #COVID__19 became #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
You have echoed lies and defended demagoguery. It must sting to still be defending Trump.
Trump’s call to postpone elections is an outrageous break with American faith in democracy
No we won’t. A low key racist, incrementalist like Joe isn’t the harbinger of sweeping reforms we desperately need, and protestors aren’t delusional enough to believe that he is. I DESPISE the “lesser of two evils” argument. But when the greater of two evils is Trump? ✅ Biden

Three presidents embrace the struggle for rights. Trump suggests postponing the election.
The republicans don’t want to give the American people anything until the republicans get what THEY want and it’s not going to work that way this time. You guys put us in such a deficit America will never be the same. The DEMS will have to raise taxes because of trump.
Not like, when he accepted help from Russia or when he didn’t have the balls to call Putin out for bounties, or when he usurped the justice system by pardoning Stone, (insert 50 more examples of Trump being LITERALLY the worst American), oh and he doesn’t pay taxes...

RIP Herman Cain  Sorry for the loss of your friend President Trump
Its been almost 4 years guys, im still waiting for solid proof why Trump is considered God Emperor by so many of y'all.
”I just like to retweet and like all the answers people make to people who don't like Trump.  I'm especially turned on by   I really like how his chest looks in his profile pic.  I wouldn't mind visiting HIS basement! Wink, wink!” -
Exactly like you call a successfull black man and its obvious why bc your racism runs deep. All you try and do is misdirect and sorry ppls opinions are not fact. I provided you a list of factual racist things Biden has done.u cannot give me one factual thing of trump being racist
So according to Donald Trump I committed fraud this morning.  I mailed in my primary ballot for the Florida primary on August 18th. Oh well
Trump says second stimulus check could be 'way higher' than $1,200 | Fox Business
Trump will take it back and they will be back to being his cheerleader.
You have no idea what was said. They probably told him/her. And we could use your argument on a black man shoot in Milwaukee and a black reporter stabbed in Portland by antifa. Guess blacks lives who support Trump, do not matter.
trump killed Herman Cain
Spread the word that if you vote by mail, know the important dates for your state. Make sure you return your ballot ASAP so that the intentional slowdown at USPS doesn't mess with your vote! Be brave and don't let tRump steal your voice by making it hard for you to vote!
Trump c̵l̵a̵i̵m̵s̵ promises that November's election will be "fixed" and "rigged" #FIFY
Obama did 2 things that I'd take him 2 task 4, the TPA he wanted, but finally got shamed out of at the last min, n not telling #MoscowMitch 2 piss off 2 even up the playing field after Comey's fucking brain aneurism ouying the HRC emails by throwing the 🇷🇺 help 4 Trump into play.
With respect to hydroxychloroquine, as an AMRX shareholder, I wonder what happened?
Thanks, #FederalistSociety, for the suggestion. Impeach Trump now and save lives and the country.
$600 UNEMPLOYMENT EXTENSION: The White House and some of its Republican allies in the Senate are signaling they want to extend, at least temporarily, a $600-per-week expanded jobless benefit.

There better be relief for the American people and it should come from Trump.  He put us here in this position.
Gov. DeSantis backed the efforts of the state’s elections chief and county elections supervisors after President Trump suggested the possibility of postponing the November general election because of his aversion to “mail-in” ballots.
If Salvi is correct...then Trump did the legally correct response...Federal action would be so limited by Constitution...and liberals would have blocked it in court
Um Portland is one, DHS considers it an occupation. They're threatening Chicago, New York, and Orlando with an occupation force too. What happens when they show up in your town and grab you? Trump has turned this country into a fascist state and will be voted out soon.
Trump is trying to sabotage the election and suppress votes because it is the only way he can win.  He does not care if people die, he just wants the economy open so his numbers look good for the election. Trump has failed the US as the pandemic continues to grow.
In case you are wondering about Trump's loyalty to hydroxychloroquine...Trump has a “small financial interest” in the maker of an anti-malarial drug he has been touting as a “game changer” in treating coronavirus, according to The New York Times.
Trump had better pray that there is no evidence that his lack of response to Covid-19 was tied to his misinformed belief that he could remain in power if the election is postponed until a vaccine is created. If that turns out to be the case, he'll face capital punishment.
Ok why? Why should Trump go to prison? For getting the lowest unemployment rate in America and decades. Or for lowering taxes. Or for making it easier for middle-class and lower-class citizens to actually live better.
That article is just a bunch of different ppls opinions of how they interpreted what Trump supposedly said. If trump were racist, why has he reformed prison laws, increased HBCU funding, lowered poc unemployment rates, made 2+, one cutrent, attempts 2 legalize DACA. Many examples
The  “rule of law” and Donald Trump are not even in the same ballpark.    Safe?  150k dead millions infected and unemployed and the economy is shambles.    If this so your idea of safe, you can keep it.
don’t come down here talking about faith. You’re backing a fucking criminal every day you’re in office. Grow a pair of balls and do your goddam job.  Contrary to what you and trump believe, you both WORK FOR US.
Why I have no problem calling libs "Mask Nazis".  There is no proof Cain caught Corona at Trump rally.    If he got near any protestor at Trump rally...that protestor could have been carrier...many of them at BLM Protest with Al Sharpton night before

Federalist Society co-founder says Trump’s tweet about postponing the election is grounds for ‘immediate impeachment’
"It's not Donald tRump's right to bestow upon or take away the voting franchise. That franchise has been been paid with the blood of American martyrs &amp; it is our inheritance, all of ours."  right on point! (Scared my dogs by clapping loudly &amp; cheering at the tv!)
copper peed on a keep america great yard sign today. dogs against trump 2020
I wish you had this same energy when we found out trump knew about Russian Bounties on US soldiers and still haven’t did anything about it !!
trump: all schools need to open, kids will be fine. they won’t go to the hospital and they won’t die. they definitely won’t pass covid onto their family.   also trump: we should hold off on the election because it’s not safe and mail-in-ballots are fraud.
I could see Mitch getting more and more fed up with how bad Trump makes the Republican Party look. The constant conspiracy theories and false claims. Mitch is not blind nor an idiot.
Even the Reagan insitution doesn’t want anything to do with Trump.
Trump's been reading Plato again.
America is NOT even close to the oldest so your statement rings hollow immediately. And trump is doing his best to make sure we r not the best. The best means working with friends not praising dictators and enemies. Bringing the people together not driving a wedge between them
Yes at the hands of Donald J Trump
They're occupying cities against the will of the local leaders and black bagging innocent people trying to exercise their constitutional rights. This is what dictators do because Trump is a dictator.
Ne'er a more perfect headline other than the one I hope to see this winter: "Trump Loses Bigly! Biggest Landslide Ever!" #willingitso #VoteBidenDammit
So you cant find anything that Trump has said that is comparable? You dont need to waste your time. You won't.
Millions would have died if Trump hadn't acted in January while Democrats were calling it nothing to worry about. Think about that. MILLIONS would have died, but you don't thank YOUR PRESIDENT. Open your eyes &amp; see give credit where credit is due. Wow, the lies you guys believe!!
For the first time I am afraid for the United States.  I am seeing that this can go towards a very serious problem about the elections just like any third world country, due to the distrust that Trump is creating in the people with the vote by mail.
Actually Trump didnt start it. Clinton supporters, with or without her campaigns aide, started it.    The central park 5 ad was the sentiment of most new Yorkers at the time and was printed when the 5 teens were almost certainly deemed guilty by the public.
Trump's with it! He knows how to tweet even before he was elected. He knows how to read other tweets and share what matters most. He knows what science says, what doctors are saying, but you Biden, are led around by doctors and told what to say, and you still mess it up! #Worried
Yeah, bullshit. That’s the official Republican excuse every time Trump says something racist,  illegal or flat out stupid. He was “joking.” Pathetic. 🙄
Herman Cain ok, ok, Rest In Peace and all that but, how many more people will die like him because of Trump and his Campaign and the Republicans?   #COVIDIOT
Trump has definitely put a dent in our democracy...
Person, woman, man,camera, tv. Joe I can not wait until your able to put your cognitive abilities against Trump. Your debates against Palin and Ryan were a master class in performance.

Please show this to your relatives who keep saying Trump is a “great business man”.
We should have done more to stop trump from being elected!
This wasn’t some kind of strategic trolling move. Trump is really, really ignorant. He’s made this abundantly clear over and over again.

President Trump met with the family of a soldier who investigators say was slain on the Texas Army base where she was stationed, saying it is a "terrible story" and that he would help with funeral expenses.
Not a socialist but I don’t like Trump. This is still America right?
Not a chance. Biden will win in a landslide and after that, the only unresolved issue will be where to send trump's last presidential check. By the way, these conspiracy theory, worst case scenario stories, serve no real purpose. Report real news and lay off the what if stories.
Yes.  I worry that Trump will use them to fix the election.

Trump has Bill Barr working in the background to make everything he wants to happen. Be concerned. Very concerned.
Majority means more people voted not for trump. We learned what majority meant in 6th grade. Stop deflecting from the misuse of majority in your stupid fucking slogans. The phrases are not even remotely correct. 3 million votes less than correct.
These lazy teachers who don't want to come to work can stay at home and collect their welfare check. I would like for President Trump to send us a check in the mail for $7000, and I will be glad to have my son homeschooled.
Lmao yeah that also, Cuomo has an unbelievable amount of blood on his hands from this BUT he was a great cable news mascot as the "anti-Trump" voice for Democrats (as he slashed hundreds of millions from healthcare spending &amp; threw De Blasio under the bus)
Nobody will ever judge character until character presents itself, which others is not willing to try.  You are guilty until proven innocent.  Just because you "appear" a certain way doesnt mean you are immediately branded a 'trump supporter'
When working, I can't imagine a similar environment like at a rally. Also, we all need to work. Nobody needs to go to a rally. Trump killed him and probably others by insisting on rally in the middle of pandemic. Fanatical Trumpism...
These guys don't look like cops.  Are they Trump's own Red Army?  Their uniforms, their behavior, it all looks like something from pre WWII Nazi shit. It's really happening, America-wake up!  VOTE.

The crazy thing about this is that nobody utilized all those empty seats.   At the very least, you could have spaced yourselves out a bit.   Herman Cain beat stage 4 cancer, but decided to risk it all for a Trump rally. Sad way to go.   Cover your face. Quit crying about it.
Yet another Trumper who didn't care Trump was destroying America until the destruction knocked on their door. But welcome to the right side of history I suppose.
People are rightfully upset about all of this, but you can't dream of holding anyone in Trump's admin legally responsible for COVID19 deaths when Bush is hanging out with Ellen while New Orleans is still rotting &amp; Obama is the king of Netflix while Flint still has deadly water

President Trump’s press briefing started after 5:30 today - obama had already spoken. His “eulogy” had already been posted to YouTube by 3:30 today so he was no longer speaking when the President’s briefing started.
I can see this happening but it’s a bad idea because it would do the opposite. The next president has a responsibility to hold trump accountable.
I will say that one Trump flag went down in the neighborhood today.
But we’re supposed to believe that while Blue states are on lockdown, only 247 people could find the time to watch #BasementJoeBiden give a prepared speech. Hell, Trump can get 10x that total to watch him walk to Marine One. #JoeNoGo

Pres Trump expressed condolences for Herman Cain very first thing in his briefing today. No one knows how Cain contacted C-19; it hasn’t been linked to the one rally that’s been held. He was a 74-year old man who had battled stage-4 colon cancer &amp; was at risk like all those 60+.
It's pretty clear you don't think the rest of us read the part that said: ..."until people can properly, securely and safely vote." The delay was in the context of protecting voters (not that Trump actually cares about that).
Floyd was a criminal and drug addict. And his death had zero to do with race.  He didn’t deserve or earn to be a martyr it was all political and for people using Cains death against trump proves the ignorance and evil from the left.

Trump admin squeezing the juice so they fail &amp; become private smh
Trump clearly is racist but racism, for him, is just an extension, of a sick mind looking for escape by blaming others w a sense of false superiority. But, i too, have special hard feelings abt black Republican's &amp; i think there is an element of racism i need 2 cleanse.
I'm terrified of Trump.  Do not rest. We have not yet defeated him.
He’s as crazy as tRump.
Lmao you must have been living under a rock this year. Trump did more harm to America this year alone than all 8 of Obama's years. The 150,000+ deaths are on Trump's hands. They're stained with the blood of Americans.
And no one asked Meltdown Donnie Trump about this in his fucking rambling,  Adderall induced press conference? WTF is wrong with you press folks? 😢😷

Evening brother &amp; sister #Resisters, what a hell of a day. The racist Trump is losing his mind. But what else is new. btw, if he slows down the mail, you can actually take your ballot to the supervisor of elections in your county.  Don't allow this fool to take away your vote.
What if a foreign government came to monitor the elections so Trump can’t cheat.
Might want to look at the environment around you. Where people are being forced to wear ankle monitors just because they MIGHT be sick. That's not Trump doing that. But, then again, Obama was the only logical person on the Left.
You know better. Trump never has a plan. Sometimes he comes close but those times it’s merely a scheme.

Trump has a press conference spouting nonsense about other countries' covid problems. The media then takes the bait and argues about that instead of telling us the facts about the US. Wise up. Remember 2016. Shiny objects. Get it.

Yea too bad Trump threw a rally with no health guidelines against medical professional advice during a pandemic and killed him.

You know what he didn’t do in 40 years in office? Be the one running the country into the fucking ground and killing a couple hundred thousand along the way.   Herman Caines death is on Trump, along with 149k other Americans so far.
Their "Sense of Humor" was killed by watching  late-night "comedy" shows the past 4 years.  Hate isn't funny.  "Trump is a Liar" and "Trump killed millions" is not a punch line.     1/3 don't have functioning sense of humor
The people of Florida can beg a they want to  however lets not forget that he his Trump's puppet and doesn't care who lives or who dies. All he cares about is what Trump tell's him to do. He is a weak governor and shouldn't be reelected next go around period.
what would be more fun? just quickly picking up trump then throwing him out onto pennsylvania ave, or a slow and agonizing drag from the wh residence, onto the ellipse, out the gates? "no, no, very unfair, polls were rigged!" the whole way
Really trump shut it down?   Hmm.  I recall mayors and governors shut things down.  Oh yea because Trump doesn’t have that power
its never happening but can you imagine if biden won then asked for volunteers to remove trump after he refused to leave? the line would be so long. we could raffle tickets and fund health care for a year.
Add in Dc and PR and Dems will hold power for decades     ...Trump is saving this country #FourMoreYears
That is your TDS talking. The flag preceded Trump and will continue to fly after Trump.
The more of you who do will mean there are less living Trump supporters to drag down the rest of the country.
Weekend before the election, Trump/Barr "find"evidence of mass election interference, tell supporters do not vote on Tuesday because they "can't secure it in time". Instant cluster f*** that can put the result of the election in doubt no matter the margin
What?  How does Trump pass that test?  Just today, he floated a trial balloon about abusing power he doesn't have to delay an election.  Dems, otoh, are running their campaign on the premise of reigning in power (although it remains to be seen if they live up to that).
I hope you are right.  But evangelicals love tRump, they worship tupPence.  The GOP sheep will fall in line behind him
No offence anyone, making a trump/Hitler comparison. Sorry to hurt your feelings. I wish your wife well😇❤️
If both Trump and McConnell lose, it will be a dangerous time.
PRESIDENT NANCY PELOSI! IF TRUMP DOESN'T LEAVE
Covid takin pets too? Oh Trump is done... y’all know folk don’t play about they pets.
I’m also glad to see your not disputing the fact the left think BLM protesters are exempt from catching and spreading Kung flu but trump rallies aren’t 👍
There must be an agency that monitors the mental health of the people who bring news to the population, because it is obvious that they can transmit their problems to the rest of the people, it is very sad!  Pundits suggest Trump rally to blame for Herman Cain’s death
I would literally vote for a corpse over Trump.
Trump looks so scared/surprised like he ended up in the wrong place
He sacrificed himself for your trump virus hoax. Isn’t a hoax is it criminal. His blood is on your hands. Criminal negligent homicide.
There's one thing Trump could do today to save 100,000 American lives..... Resign.
#dyingforTrump #EverythingTrumpTouchesDies #TrumpIsTheVirus #covididiots Trump will NEVER visit you if you get sick! #coronavirus #WearAMask  Why would ANYONE take pen anyone, that's not steralized? Why are Republicans scared to death over DT?  #TrumpNotWell
Looks similar to that Donald Trump signature he holds up. This one belongs to him!  Might as well have his name on it.
Go Trump!
No covid19 vaccines 💉 for me under any circumstances. Any and all circumstances NO VACCINES
Exactly. #AmericaWakeUp Trump being worst killing over 140k++ Americans right here at home - at home. #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpKillsAmericans
Cain dies and trump mentions him immediately. Lewis passed away and trump golfed
Lying again tRump as usual.
Fine by me. *trump sully's everything he touches.
If I catch covid and die while voting Trump out please know I’ll die miserable, but happy.

The Hijacking of Homeland Security
What is it that you think your Dear Leader is mongering?  Love?  I feel confident when I say that Donald Trump is the greatest hate-monger of our time.  Also, please learn how to use a hyphen.  It may not be as much fun as using a gun, but you never see hyphens killing people.
MSNBC Host Blames Trump For Herman Cain’s Death  via
RIP Herman Cain.  He attended the infamous Trump Rally in Tulsa in June without a mask and no social distancing.  His COVID-19 illness erupted in July.  Enough said.  This is not a hoax -- everyone should take this pandemic seriously!
Had Cain went to the BLM event the night before in Tulsa...nothing would be said.  However...he was at a Trump Rally...
So you finally agree Trump killed him??!!!
Trump literally called his supporters animals! And listen, I’m here for it ❗️👏🏾😂
keep up the good fight! #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpFailsAmerica #Trump #VoteTrumpOut
Throughout this, I've often thought that if I were an epidemiologist or virologist, I'd say "screw, y'all!" and move to a country where I don't receive death threats or accusations of being a Marxist who wants to destroy America whenever I share research that contradicts Trump.
are other judges potentially recusing themselves from the Flynn case? Can Trump block AG Barr from testifying ?
Politico Editor Fantasizes About Trump Quitting the Race
And  said it is up to the DOJ. It's not. Don't let that little nugget get lost in the truckload of *trump bullshit we have to wade through day in and day out.
Trump's claims that the military is prepared to distribute COVID-19 vaccine are 100% lies
Why White Evangelicals Worship at the Altar of Donald Trump w/ Sarah Pos...  via
Is this like when Trump said he’d have a big scoop on Bill &amp; Hillary the following Tuesday or when he said Melania will have a news conference about her resume’, still waiting for both.
More propaganda. Have you ever considered you are being played by a powerful establishment that hates trump for not falling in line with their goals and hates you for simply existing?
Trump killed Herman Cain.
Wonder how Trudeau backers feeling as it came out their Liberal Wunderkind has been using US Republican (Trump's Party) Marco Rubio's campaign staff in some of his shennanigans 😁
Trump will and does try to force China to play equally. Biden will sell out.
I honestly don't think trump has a chance of winning.  It's the 23 republican senators up for re-election that do.  And the two vulnerable democrats (Doug Jones of Alabama and Gary Peters of Michigan) need to be protected.
You sure got a point, Brother Bakari, but, then again, it was "Us" against the Electoral College, Trump, and Putin. We were outnumbered.
All the above. Ha. Trump said if you wear a mask you don’t support him or something like that. So no masks.
Luv2 watch people rehabilitate trump in real time lol
Good... I was worried you wouldn't find some way to make this about Trump
And I don’t fucking care. His politics have hurt hundreds of thousands of people. I hope he rots in hell like every other person on the Trump cabinet.
You have missed the point. He was blasting Trump during a funeral service. Btw I support Trump. I have a MBA, and am not stupid. Like most crass liberals. You are quick to say diversity and inclusion but quick to criticize  those who you disagree with. Hypocrite.
Are Trump and  are holding up stimulus cause he wants an  building near his  property... So he can get CONTRACTS to house agents, visitors etc after he gets out of office. But that's not #Corruption ? #Congress
Everyone loves Fauci right?  If I remember correctly Trump hired him no?
🙄 Trump country? What, Mar A Lago?
When  crushes  on November 3rd and Trump’s team starts floating the idea of a pardon, I hope Biden laughs in their faces.  Also, I wonder if  has started making plans for dying in prison of old age.
This man Trump really trying to flake on the election.
Herman Cain just as likely caught CoronaVirus from BLM Antifa Protest hosted by Al Sharpton, held nite before Trump Rally  Event had staff work BOTH events, &amp; were most likely to get close to Cain during entering rally venue.  Trump Rally moved up 1 day due to BLM #RIPHermanCain
People are already blaming Trump for his death. Smh
These people desperately want to believe Trump isn’t just making up stuff on the spot and just spouting whatever sounds good at the time. They are willing to suspend disbelief to extremes to pretend he’s carefully mapped all this out like The Da Vinci Code.   It’s sad.
🙄 When did Trump become a nazi exactly? I seem to remember him being much beloved by the democrats and many many black people like Sharpton and Jackson right up till he beat the incredibly corrupt Clinton machine. Trump is a chad who dated women of every type and has a jew son.
Instead of Tweeting about Trump, why can't  help us get answers from Mayor Dyer and the City of Orlando? All we want is help. All we want is help. We don't need your attacks.
Res ipsa loquitur and what a deadly message indeed. trump should be court ordered to visit every grave beyond the 15 or so he predicted back in January when he called Covid a hoax.
To all liberals. When Mr. Bone Spur delays election &amp; shuts down the media. Make sure you have all your preps in place ham radio, water, food, pistol, shotgun, rifle, at least 4- 80 lb. dogs and be prepared for revolution. As I, understand the Joint Chiefs will not follow Trump.
I trust President Trump, I don’t trust Dr Fauci or Bill Gates. HCQ + Zpac + Zinc is the answer to Covid19. Why did they conspire to allow the deaths of 150,000 Americans and counting ? Why do they continue to conspire to kill Americans ? For money 💰 ? For partisan politics ? 🙏🏽
*trump and class are two words that should never ever ever be used in the same sentence.
#HermanCain- Don't know much abt him, but condolences to his family. All those who appease Donald Trump's ego abt #mask and #Hydroxychloroquine, pay attention to scientific facts if you want to live.  &amp; others crowding around your 'TrumpGod' Put your family first.
He boycotted 45 inauguration based on Hillary lies and called Trump illegitimate
Why? He went to a Donald Trump rally where masks weren’t enforced and died as a result of it. This is 100% your boy Donald’s fault. Cry about it.
Looks like we are not going to become a lawless nation after all. I think at this point, just about everyone has had enough of trump's and barr's attempts at circumventing the law. I have always believed that there are still good, decent people, who aren't part of trump nation.
Shame on you Trump for no acknowledgement of #JohnLewisMemorial not even a letter #TrumpIsAMoron #RIPJohnLewis #CivilRightsICON
- we dare Trump to do it!
Are you talking about me and me family? Because we voted for Hillary in 2016, we are Latinos. And we are going to vote for Trump first time
Trump made this guy look like a good president 😪
It is patently obvious Trump doesn’t have the Constitutional authority to delay or cancel the election, but it is the latest evidence of his dictatorial tendencies
Good luck with that, Kamala.  Count me as one who didn’t vote in 2016 who will vote Trump in 2020, and Republican straight down the ballot.  My 3 kids also didn’t vote in 2016, and are all with MAGA.  In Florida.
Democrats passed a bill in the house... you’re just as bad at lying as Trump is.
Trump-Desantis Virus = 32.9 percent annualized contraction in gross domestic product and 1.43 million new jobless claims,.
I caught some at lunch and try explaining to people who think Trump is good why you are crying, it goes right over their head!
So...doesn't seem to have helped much. We have 4% of the world population and 25% of the deaths. Doesn't look like anything Trump did helped. He's still not helping. Let's not forget he's hyping treatments the FDA did not approve. Ignored wearing a mask for months. SAD!!!
The sad thing is trump voted by Mail in 2004, and his press secretary voted by mail 12 times.
Trump is such a baby.
I’m not wasting my time arguing about the fact that the leadership of this country is Trump period. Any leadership with competence and not more concerned about himself could have have done better. If you love him you can have him but he is responsible for this catastrophe
We know. That’s how bad trump is. We look back and go “that was waaaay better”.
It was so good. It’s so refreshing to hear someone actually speak intelligently and compassionately about something that matters.   He pushed for voting while Trump is trying to delay the election.
Donald Trump is a Trojan fighting on a horse defending us from Russia. Pass it on!
#ObamaWasBetterAtEverything my President spoke Trump you cannot delay the election remember this is America not Rusia or North Korea , definitely you are not a king just a dirty disgusting looser
When this goddam  nightmare is finally over and gone, we are going to find out Trump’s  &amp; most Republican Governor’s pathetic response to #Covid was a purposeful attempt to keep voters from the polls. They were &amp; are WILLING TO LET AMERICANS DIE!
Mr Trump, I'm behind you a 100%. Some people aren't sure yet. Now would be a good time for a FIRESIDE CHAT, with the people...non-political, non-judgmental...JUST ASSURING US, from YOU, as OUR PRESIDENT &amp; FRIEND.
Trump does stuff every day that he “can’t” do.    The law is meaningless when nobody enforces it.
Trump is probably so jealous of the John Lewis funeral that he'll do a presser from a coffin at 5...
Trump Derangement Syndrome may kill you faster than Covid 19, you may want to take a chill pill!

For anyone who says No, move to another country. Because the only reason for not liking Trump is because he loves this country, its history and the patriotic citizens.
Trump Blows Up the Left with Election Delay Tweet
So predictable trump. I saw a video recently of republicans you fired from the white house that said you already had a delay plan to remain in office longer. Trying to be like your idol putin. You are not putin and never will be. You both are pieces of $h!t though.
That is a good way to buy every citizen vote. Don’t get fool by #trump #votetrumpout
China is not responsible for the US. The President of the United States is responsible for the response he has taken and continue to take. Oh I forget Putin is running the US so I understand how so many Americans have died and will continue to die with Trump as president.
Trump on Twitter is like an atheist in a Sunday School class.
With  “Delay the election” tweet, is there anyone else but me beginning to think Trump could possibly not win a single Electoral College vote and  will win all 50 States &amp; 1/2 dozen territories!  Fewer people each minute wil not be #DyingForTrump.
President Trump suggested that the next round of stimulus checks could be "way higher" than $1,200: "I'd like to see it be very high," Trump said. "I want the people to get it."
Dude.. my niece is much more qualified than trump... she's only 4 n doesn't need a cognitive test..
How so did trump ? Or trump just didn’t mess up what obama was doing ?
"especially me" Everything that Trump says has to be about Trump. He is one sick puppy.
Trump has no control over the Capitol Building, Congress does.  So Trump did not order the flag to half mast.  Probably a voice vote of both houses resulted in the flag being lowered.
Its insulting to imply that Trump is mentally ill, are you or anyone on this thread a doctor? No. So stop diagnosing others.
Remember when Biden said Trump was going to try and delay the election and MAGAs were like “LOL NO WAY. JOE HAS DEMENTIA LOL”, but now Trump is saying he wants to delay the election &amp; MAGAs are like “we should delay the election”.  Remember that. Remember that when it happened.
Trump doesn't want to delay the election, he wants to cover this up
I'm sure Trump wishes he could have watched. He's a sadist to the core.
96 days until Trump loses and contemplates how much jail time he’ll get. #SDNY
My Apple device autocorrect  has finally got smart and realized I don't ever want to capitalize the word trump.
Ok, did I just hear this right? Herman Caine died from COVID-19. It just keeps getting worse for Trump.  Did he not get the memo about hydroxychloroquine (you get it).  Damn, I Guess not, sorry not sorry he’s was an enabler for the baby in chief!
The sad part is they had him sign a liability waiver. He had to know at that point what he was getting into or maybe not,  maybe just being the sacrificial lamb for trump?
You’ve got her confused with Trump and Putin
A society that allows military occupations is not a safe society for anyone. I should know, I've visited some of those countries, it's fucking bad, Cuba does this, former Soviet countries do this, this is what dictators do. And Trump will lose in November.
Unlikely.  Dems at least try to justify their power grabs as being good for America.  Trump, otoh, nakedly does it to benefit himself.
I just did the same. tRump’s tweets about mail-in voting are a poster-child example of the type of Tweets that should be reported with Twitter’s “attempts at voter suppression” category.
On running America like a business: In business, if you act like an idiot, you lose money. In government, if you act like an idiot, 100,000+ people die, and 30+ million lose their jobs.  But you can try to blame Obama for it. #TrumpPandemic #Trumpocalypse
Not my lesbian cousin posting pictures of her at what looks like a trump rally, with no mask and waving a blue lives matter flag ☠️☠️☠️
Trump didn't just break the GOP, he broke conservatism
Christian and a Trump supporter? Can’t be both. Choose one.
1) The media buried Biden after NH. No one was crowing that “he was the only one who could beat Trump” 2) All other candidates endorsed him? Lmao. Do remember that coming into Super Tuesday, there were two major moderate candidates  (Bloomberg &amp; Biden) and two progressive ones...
Dear media: the next time Trump doesn't shit himself giving a speech and you feel the need to say he appears "presidential," watch this clip to remember what "presidential" really means. Looking at you #vanjones
The media seems to like Trump’s new tone.... they’re still talking about it. 🤮
wants us to celebrate his birthday! But im here to expose him as a Trump supporting Republican who slaps babies and refuses to wear a mask while in Target.
The economy tanked today in case you didn't notice, thanks to Trump and the Republican Senate who enables him.
Trump also has Erik Prince and his private army goons on his side
this man got really mad because he was wearing a Trump 2020 mask and someone said something to him about it. He said, “I just knew someone would say something!”  ...then why did you wear it, sir?  Ah yes, because you actually want to get reactions out of people, drama whore.
Yeah I know that one, but I think there's still a lot of grey area. And any politician using it will probably face some nasty backlash as sending the military into cities to occupy is widely hated by the very cities and states they're occupying. Trump will lose this election.
They are concerned. Trump Campaign knew the risk because they made the people sign a waiver.   FoxNews, Lou Dobbs, Sean Hannity, Trump Campaign, Trump himself promoted the #TulsaRally despite the multiple calls to cancel.   I wonder what Herman Cain thought the los days
My entire state votes by mail. Sorry, Mr. President. It works great.
Trump counts on the “fear his supporters in the White Supremacy, Militia and Far-Right movements will incite chaos and rebellion if Trump contests the results of the November election
Weekend before the election, Trump/Barr "find"evidence of mass election interference, tell supporters do not vote on Tuesday because they "can't secure it in time". Instant cluster f*** that can but the result of the election in doubt no matter the result

From the head of the Federal Electoral Commission. Go to hell, Trump. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Love the Lincoln Project!!!!! Love the real truth they put out. Paying off leans on their homes is what trump, McConnell and Rs did for crooked Brett Kavanaugh!!
President Trump has not been saying much new lately. Good for the coverage staying with three real presidents of the United States!
... comment “Trump” has to make...
When trump dies, will anyone outside of his klan show? Why would Clinton or Obama go? Why would Pelosi go? Only 1 reason and one reason only, make sure his body is really there
Trump killed Epstein and Cain
Give it a few hours &amp; Trump will shit all over the entire event... &amp; the media will allow it by covering whatever vulgar, hateful, racist comment has to make about it. Enables.
I’m going to the booth and vote.  Trump is a snake.
It's kind of ironic that someone so slow witted is paid to be in charge of rapid response for Trump.
At least he got to see Trump drink water successfully
Is that a eulogy or a campaign speech for the Democrats. This people are incredible, they are the first one to criticize Trump about anything and everything!
Holding a ‘cops for trump’ sign doesn’t do much to disprove the notion that they’re all racists.
So trump hasn’t said a word about Herman Cain? It’s almost like he’s a black man...
UPDATE! More Than $1,200 Stimulus Check (Call by President Trump)  via
Also trump: “Don’t vote because it will be a fraudulent one” 😂
Right but my point being if it eliminates Trump for now we can work on the rest later. Choices are so limited
Boy has the green eyed Monster EVER got a hold on Trump! He is completely blind with jealousy of Obama.
How does one take over a free society?   You start by questioning the motives on how we elect our officials. Trump is purposefully planting the seeds of doubt in his followers minds and the minds of undecided voters. This is straight up fraud.
Listening to BHO's eulogy for John Lewis right now. Wonder what Trump has up his sleeve now.
Exactly what I tough #trump diverting te news same time #Obama is giving his eulogies to #JohnLewisMemorial
Trump is nothing more than a game show host promoting his sponsors!
I am proud that under President Trump, historic measures have been taken to support women in the U.S. and abroad. Take a look! Thank you  and  for these unprecedented feats for millions
Just because 1/3 of the country is enthusiastic doesn’t mean trump will win, pretty simple to understand lol
Translation, we are just as ready to be rid of trump as the rest of the world.

...yet, when Trump tried to pull it off with  in 2016, the media called out Trump on it within 48 hours.  Are you also into this hypocritical double-standard, like  and others? 🤔
Or if Trump had been an adult and worn a mask in public for the last four months.
Donald J Trump, the Trump Campaign, FoxNews, Hannity, Lou Dobbs are all co-responsibles for the death of Herman Cain.   The #TulsaRally was an aberration, thousands told you not to do it. I wonder how many more people are sick?
tRump says what do you have to lose?   I say we lose everything if tRump wins again.
Didn’t Trump just now call the press pool in to take away from Obama speaking? And like always.... the media races to kiss Trump’s fat ass!
And Trump is every bit as good a President as those men were, which is why this suggestion is so unexpected
The mainstream media has been giving Trump a pass and the benefit of doubt for decades, most notoriously by allowing him to push birtherism for an entire year knowing his claim was bogus and racist.
And Trump is every bit as good a President as those men were, which is why this suggestion is just so unexpected
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
I’m appalled you know Trump doesn’t have Constitutional authority to delay or change the election date and still the headline question leading to your report  was “Could he really do it?”.  Unbelievable!
Twitter is accused of double standards for flagging posts by Trump

That’s fine. Delay the election. Trump is out of office on Jan 20th at noon anyways if he isn’t re-elected. No election just means no trump or Biden. Win-win for me.
I pretty sure #trump is planning to diverse the media against #obama coming speech in #JohnLewisMemorial
All while kissing Trump’s ass.
Every moment you spend tweeting is a moment you're not phonebanking for biden.   Hop to it, or it's your fault trump wins.
I’m sure his family is so proud of him for dying in the name of Trump. It’s a cult.
Aaaaaaand there it is, folks. He is threatening our democracy. If Trump could have his way, we would never be allowed to vote again.  Get registered. Vote.
Take that Trump! #RuleOfLaw
Thare is just one case per state every six or seven years, on average of Mail-In voter fraud. We are talking about an occurrence that translates to about 0.00006 percent of total votes cast. Trump's just terrified because you can't cheat if there's a #PaperTrail
Voted for Obama twice, didn’t realize I was so sleepy.... In 2016 I could not bare to see corrupt Hillary continue the lies and BS. I voted for Trump in ‘16 and just recently changed my votes ID to red. I am never looking back. #NoCensorship #MAGA2020
President Trump floats delay of #2020election, citing widespread mail-in voter fraud despite any evidence.
Then how about you give something that can put food on our tables! Cut the military BS, the gifts to trump, the liability protections for big businesses and anything else that doesn’t directly assist citizens! It’s not difficult!! #PassTheHEROESAct
Lmfao he didn’t say he will delay the election. He just suggested it😒😒😒   President Trump suggests delay to November election, though experts say he lacks the authority to do so
He chose not to wear a mask. Trump did not force him
May Trump be next ...
If you feel like there’s nothing you can do to help get trump out of office, fear not, you can be instrumental in denying him another term 👇🏼
I think that we can all agree that Donald Trump should be locked up.  But where? #TrumpIsUnwell #LockHimUp #TrumpCrimeFamily
I saw President Trump's Election tweet, I noticed the last sentence ended with question marks, the left is going crazy over a question.  With mostly mail-in ballots it will take weeks to count them all thus delaying the election.  How many ballots will come in late?

Maybe he shouldn't have gone to that trump rally, or repeatedly told people to not wear masks🤷‍♂️
Remember, Trump has repeatedly stated that he never jokes, and that everything he says is the literal truth
We are still baking in the middle of a pandemic.  #Trump #BreakingNews #lockdownextension #coronavirus #support #andrewyang #TheView
... but Donald Trump voted by mail. So what is he talking about.🤦🏽‍♀️ Please VOTE him out. He cares less about the constitution. Just another ploy to distract the people.  #yourvotematters #yourVOTEyourVOICE
How can u be so stupid to still believe Trump called the virus and not the democrats and media response to it avhoax
Nope.  I'll continue to watch John Lewis' service.  You should too.  PS:  President Obama will be on shortly.  He is way more important to listen to than Trump anyway.
Your stock portfolio won’t do you any good if you are in a casket 🤦‍♀️ nor will it do any good if the country is collapsing under incompetent leadership in Trump &amp; Putin’s GOP
No sympathy for idiots who are willing to die for Trump.
trump......he thinks he can. But he’s wrong!
They are literally dying for Trump. Idiots. I hope their families think it’s worth it.
So let me get this straight. trump wants to delay the elections... because he’s acknowledging that we’ll still be dealing with corona in November? But also saying that it’s going to go away and wants to pull funding for unemployment because “we don’t want to go back to work” TF?
Herman Cain dead after attending Trump rally..... #coronavirus
Miss Williams.. I do think Trump is just throwing the lefts rhetoric back at them.  He knows how to push their buttons.  Fun.

A) trump can't delay the election. It would require a unanimous act of congress 2. Even if it's delayed, on January first he still has to go and the speaker would assume presidential duties. (thanks, constitution!) iii. Even if Polosi doesn't get re-elected, would still be a dem

How will I create more jobs?   By freeing industry and individuals to do what they do best: grow the economy. I will write a law requiring what Trump has done via executive order in the legislator, peeling away 20+ regulations for every 1 new regulation...
The morning after the #Tulsarally Trump said he never jokes.
"I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,'' Trump told New York Magazine in a profile of Epstein written three years before Epstein began to be investigated. "He's a lot of fun to be with. He likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”
Remember when there was a Trump rally the same night of the Bastille show? lololol

Doesn't Trump realize that if the election is delayed, more Trump #COVIDIOTS will attend his rallies, speak in tongues in the emergency room, and then die?  Or does he think that you can mail in absentee ballots from Hell?  #ElectionDelay #TrumpIsDesperate
Just realized that Trump, Bush, and Clinton were all born during summer of 1946. Which other presidents have been closest in age?
Brilliant move by Trump though. We know mail in voting will have issues, if Trump wins, and Dems cry foul, he says I told you so. If he loses, it will be a stain on Biden's election as we continue to find uncounted ballots through 2022.
I believe that we are all a part of something profoundly good.....Well, except trump and his enablers.
Re-upping: There is no 'absentee,' only mail-ins, in FL, Trump voted by mail in Palm Beach, and several county supervisors (including Republican Chris Anderson in Seminole) are sending mail-in applications to every voter, the same process Trump attacks
we’re all better off giving trump one less platform for him to spread his lies!! also one less time we’d have to listen to him “speak”
Trump is NOT leaving. 4 more years.
trust me people i can guarantee you John Lewis did not want trump at his funeral, or to visit him while he lied in state. there’s no doubt in my mind he wanted him as far away from everything concerning him as possible. trump would’ve turned this moment into a campaign speech!!
Will you hold Trump accountable for killing your friend, or ignore it along with the 150,000 other dead Americans?
Trump suggests delaying November election  As usual, the press, this time the BLACK press has lived p to its reputation as FAKE NEWS, and they only do it because they know their constituents are too intellectually lazy to check the facts for themselves
Correct unsubstantiated leak of virus.  I suggest purposely releases to influence our election. Which would put Dems in the middle of it as they have repeatedly said they would do ANYTHING to get rid of Trump
Yea.   Had a conversation yesterday with an ex-coworker on the phone.   Knew he was a Trump supporter but kind of dismayed to see he is a full covid denier.   Plus he has a pretty-existing condition
I agree Trump and Clinton are terrible people
Trump is desperate.   is right:  the 100 or so newspapers demanding that Bill Clinton resign in 1998 have more than enough reasons to demand Trump resign immediately
or, when trump tweets that someone should be investigated, and the next day Barr opens an investigation, that is a fact.
Stop bitching about Trump..yall keep playing his game by giving him your attention...at this point we all know what the deal is gotta take care of that shit in November...it would be great if the energy could be shifted #Racism #ChildTrafficking  #Immigration
Release her, you had no problem letting Manafort and Cohen out of jail, you had no problem with  criminals like Flynn and Stone go with no jail time, you hypocritical assholes what are following Trump's agenda!
Like a new FBI building that will benefit Trump’s hotel in DC?
Black people for Trump are complete idiots you legit support a man who doesn’t care about you or your people 🤬
They were at least, as a whole, willing to publicly say "this obviously bad thing is bad" before Trump. Now, they just shrug &amp; go "~~well, who's to say what 'good' or 'bad' means~~". Plus, we're going to have Q fuckos in Congress next. That's gonna be some shit.
Trump has gone from 4 Dimensional Chess in 2016 to playing checkers in 2020.

Dan he owns Trump Tower and Mar a Lago. Get help.
A write-in is prob same as a vote for Trump. In the past it wasn’t as important to vote for 1 or the other, &amp; years ago I actually wrote in in 2 diff elections. But this election is too important to waste a vote on someone who won’t win. Don’t be a coward.
This looks like the title to a children’s book. The president holds a news conference. A work of fiction, written by, Donnie trump

Trump finally said something today that I agree with. He said the virus should have been stopped. Absolutely right. It should have been but you were too busy calling it a hoax and saying it would magically go away. Trump is to blame. He had a chance to control it and failed

Abbott is corrupt.  Trump gathered up Rick Perry to keep an eye on him. All puppets for the oil complex.

President Trump, who is still expected to land in Tampa on Friday night for a fundraiser, had planned to travel to South Florida for a Saturday event at his Trump National Doral Miami golf resort.
Remove Trump. His incompetence got us here. #RemoveTrumpNow

I’ll tell what I think is going on...The Federalists and The Council for National Policy already have a plan to rig the election and they don’t want Trump to blow their cover or to inadvertently discredit their rigged election.   The fix is (already) in...

Did you also get the footage of the trump and blue lives matter signs marching with them? Or how about the Anti-Vax propaganda that those associated with this protest had? Oh great coverage of the 500+ people without a mask btw 🥰
Trump’s America is starting to look like a war zone against American citizens.  Remember what happened to the Romanian President.   Today in Los Angeles the Federal Secret Police.
"unforeseen" does not mean what Marco thinks it does. President Obama prepared US for a potential pandemic because he was ProLife and loves America.  Trump gutted his pandemic prep bc Putin installed him to kill Americans, &amp; make US weaker &amp; poorer. Congrats to ProDeath Marco.
What this really is - is white supremacy learning to disguise itself within universally passionate issues throughout society (issues that are usually riddled with popular conspiracy theories) - These people don’t care about child sex trafficking (ob-v with the Trump gear)
These people had Blue Lives Matter &amp; Trump gear - 95% of them didn’t have a mask, &amp; also many Anti-Vaxx signs among them. 100% of them White. No black or brown families or children within sight.

Jesus, that monster's up there creating election doubt!  And he's so stupid, he's actually doing us a favor, laying bare the dastardly plan that I'd wager Barr has a big hand in.  Mail-in &amp; absentee ballots are THE SAME THING.  Heed the flashing ORANGE LIGHTS, Democrats. #Trump
Maybe just maybe hear me out solomani was in bed with Hillary and Obama so they fed trump administration false info to kill him tying up loose ends 🤔 of course we don't have the proof but very interesting
Neither Trump nor Barr can change the date of the election!!!!
If the him u are referring to is tRump then HELLLL NAWWW!!!!
#Trump: "This could have been stopped in China, but they didn't."  Does he understand how viruses work? Does he understand that viruses don't carry maps &amp; GPS-enabled devices &amp; don't give a rat's ass about borders &amp; walls?  Hell, does this dolt understand ANYTHING? #trumppresser
We can’t just beat Trump in Nov.there must be a total rebuke of the GOP.We cannot have divided government,with Mitch grifting still from the Senate helm,and fix this #TrumpDictatorship and all the damage that has been dealt.These  children need to clear out for the adults

why why why do you continue to try to rationalize Trump. He and his administration are racist despicable and he’s a dictator wannabe. Nothing to analyze.
I don't think the school stuff has anything to do with anything but this: Kids have been home for the summer. If they have to stay home longer, child care must be accounted for. Even under the best scenarios, parents will want to hand Trump his ass in this election. Kids4votes.
Welcome to the resistance, Steven Calabresi.
Hand turning in ballots needs to be yelled from the roof tops, especially with a trump sycophant heading the post office
Me second - re-watching Trump press conferences to learn to be more confrontational and blame the press rather than take responsibility. 🤡
He partied with Trump in Oklahoma!
Stop letting trump play you reporters, ask him relevant questions, don't allow him to evade questions, if you can't take the heat, close the kitchen
Convalescent plasma is going to get fast track FDA approval. Trump also just spoke about this. Look at what $KODK just did on his mention. Then think about what kinda moves we’ll get on unique fast tracked treatment. These are 2 of the plasma tickers.
Trump 2020.
Unlike Trump who believes he IS America!
Trump’s eulogy of John Lewis would have gone something like this: “I didn’t know John. I get my picture taken with many people. I am told by my advisors he was a great man. A Black man to my understanding. Is that right? So now he’s gone and we’ll just have to see what happens.”
Trump is the master of deflection. Which his “delay the election” antic, is he deflecting from what?

Yes but listen to Trump talk as well...he hasn't a clue what he's talking about he's so uninformed and chooses to be that way. He slurs and stumbles reading. And come on he just straight makes shit up.
Which is why all this panic about President Trump refusing to leave office is unfounded.
That video explains why Trump need dog whistles #hatersgonnahate #FailureInChief
There are Presidents that lead and then there is Trump.

I don't give a fk what he is; he isn't trump and that's more than enough.
So is Leo, atleast he voting for Trump
#trumpvirus. Trump is dumb enough to trust China &amp; ignore US Intel...yet Singapore, S Korea, Vietnam etc were all smart enough not to trust China. Trump must be held accountable
I call your offices' only to be hung up on or told to leave a message.  You do a great job reporting the news but nothing to protect your constituents. Also, why don't you give us your opinion on Trump's delaying the election. We need this information. Man-up!
Hell yeah! Make Trump pardon Flynn and then make him testify before Congress without the benefit of 5th Amendment protection.   Hold Flynn in contempt if he refuses to testify.   Flynn didn’t just lie to the  that’s simply ONE OF THE CHARGES he was allowed to plea to.
No we will not. Trump 2020

As long as Trump loses before Jan 20th, when Biden takes the oath of office, it doesn’t matter when the election is held.  The shorter that “lame duck” Trump is in power, the better.
So one u r a joke, two this is the same old crap &amp; three no one cares today we r feeling good having heard 3 past presidents speak giving needed nourishment to our souls. Trump &amp; his enablers look really ugly right now I would give it a rest if I were u
I am glad that Mr. Cain doesn't know that trump just tweeted out his new favorite pizza.
America was great with people like John Lewis and now we have a person in the wh who tearing America down.  Dump trump in 2020!
I have always voted by mail and will continue to do so. Trump is an idiot.

Glass houses, Steve?
Ricky is always full of BS. He’s a fake.
Why pick on the NBA and ignore Trump who encouraged Xi to put Uighur’sin camps so he could make a trade deal? Why pretend Rick didn’t send out High Speed train contract to China for personal $$ gain? Ron Johnson? McConnell-Chao?  Sure....blame athletes. That’s low hanging fruit
Important note: "Trump’s tweet came on the same morning the country reported an economic contraction of 9.5 percent in the second quarter of 2020, an unprecedented recession."
If we average the economic year of 2015, it’s is equal to 2019. In addition, Trump’s peak never exceeded Obama’s peak.
"The president’s suggestion is essentially impossible both logistically and legally. Some states begin voting in just a few short weeks, and only Congress has the power to change the election’s date."  Read
See how smart Trump is?  A few liberals floated extending the time to vote and some more pushed for vote by mail (though it's too late to print and mail new materials now).  So he's now got them saying we demand the election be held on time!  LMAO
If you look at David Jolly's voting record, he's as misogynist as Marco Rubio and he NEVER missed a chance to vote against healthcare access for working Americans. I'm not impressed Jolly says mean things about Trump because he shares so many of Trump/Rubio's Republican values.
I am going to sign for my 62 million friends that support Trump proudly.

I blame Trump #LoserInChief
I believe Vegas would put the odds at 1:1 that Trump will have a signing ceremony backed by Barr and Pompeo where he signs an “executive order” to “indefinitely delay the 2020 presidential election”. It might not be legal or binding but he will do it and the DOJ will support him.
I worry about trump in moscow. With his infirmities he's likely to fall out of a window.
In what is becoming more painful aware by the second as I watch 3 former Presidents speak- “What the fuck are we doing with this clown called Trump?”
Here in Florida, everybody I talk to including myself will vote for Trump in November.
Trump isn’t so much worried about losing than what happens to him when he loses. He is afraid of jail and rightfully so.  Also members of the family and those who use the “just taking orders” defense should be worried too.
It's going to sting this fake news broke paper like the st pete times when President Trump wins.
The Chart shows black employment, not GDP. As a measure of economic growth, I agree that Trump’s growth is good. However, the conversation. The real median and per capita GDP of the black community has flatlined under this administration.
It would take congress (both houses) passing legislation to delay the election. It’d take a constitutional amendment to keep Trump in office past noon EST 1/20/2021
That is a satire site. Regis did not leave any money to the Trump campaign..
Umm, I learned about trump re-tweeting this doctor's claims from MSNBC.  They refused to show the clip, as its contents were DANGEROUS, and never once mentioned the doctor was black.    How do you have a blue check?  Who are you with this nonsense?
Hope Trump had jam in his pocket because he's toasted with that kind of news
When you all get off the Trump tit then I’ll follow you again as I agree with a lot of your points.   But I will not caucus with fascists and racists who cannot and will not deliver the reforms needed to fix this issue.
That's a lie. Biden has committed to 3 debates. Also, tRump stumbles every time he speaks in public. His grammar is atrocious. You must not pay too much attention to him when he speaks.
That's *exactly* what Trump is doing.  Remember: for 3.5 years, he has explicitly undone, overridden, struck down, and otherwise destroyed much of what Obama worked on, created, and built. He's not done yet.
Actually, I do not. Flatlining numbers show stagnation. Trump could not continue the growth and the proof is in the numbers. If you look at them.
The tweet from President Trump, who's trailing in nearly every national poll for the Nov. 3 election, came on the same morning as the U.S. reported an economic contraction of 9.5 percent in the second quarter of 2020, an unprecedented recession.
U.S. Sen.  of Florida said, emphatically, that Election Day won’t be delayed.   The president’s suggestion is essentially impossible both logistically and legally:
Second, have you ever actually look at the income numbers? There’s been a flatline in black income since Trump.   Source: Brookings Instittute.
When asked,  said he hadn't seen  tweet.   He then explained Florida is working hard to ready itself for a Nov. 3 election:
What garbage. Herman Cain failed America, not the other way around. In campaigning for Trump, he helped sign a death warrant for well over 160,000 Americans, most of whom were innocent. Loyal Americans tried to stop him, which would have saved Cain's life.
To bad trump is complicit in his death
I am sorry for the loss of your friend &amp; former boss. I mean that. I'm also sad for Mr. Cain's family. I know that grief too well. It hurts. I'd never say anyone deserved to contract a disease &amp; die. I *will* say I wish he, &amp; many others, had listened to science instead of Trump.
If only he’d worn a mask, or skipped the Trump rally, or let God save him, or used the miracle drug hydroxychloroquine...
Did John Lewis know that President Trump gave millions of dollars to the Rainbow Coalition Sharpton's extortion racket too.
Trump, Time To RESIGN!!!
Thanks  to trump he is no longer with us
It's in the Constitution that Trump can't accept foreign emoluments - like he does every minute of every day.  It's in the Constitution that the People have the right to peacefully protest - and Trump violates that right daily.  Marco &amp; every Republican will back Trump. Be afraid
Trump has accomplished exactly what he was hoping for by starting an argument about the credibility of the the election. *Because he’s losing - if he was ahead in the polls it would be full steam ahead. #Election2020
Trump has had 4 years to prove himself. He doesn't get extra time to salvage this dumpster fire of a presidency by delaying the election. That's not how this works. #WeWillVote November 3rd.
That guy is 91 years old and would run circles around Donald Trump! 😂
Marco voted to allow the worst of Venezuela to help Trump steal another US Presidential election. Why can't Florida have even one Senator who is not a traitor?  Congrats to ProDeath Marco and every elected Republican for BREAKING FL DAILY DEATH RECORD 3 DAYS IN A ROW!
So do you think now trump might say he was wrong? Not a chance. Herman Cain was a “hoaxer” and “anti-masker”. I have NO sympathy for STUPID.
is running scared! Oops...Trump can't run! We gotcha Trump!
I love how trump wants to delay elections but doesn’t want to delay schools for k-12. What an asshole.
I think people were in shock and dismay either way I would be on an overpass waving a Trump sign with CNN Sucks on it.
It’s truly sad. Trump is getting good people killed.

Harris is correct about Trump as most corrupt president (impeached over a couple of his scandals) and that Barr continuously aides him in his wrongdoing and coverups, e.g., interference in Stone case.  If you followed the news, you could come up with many more examples!
why was he denied the trump drug, before getting infected !! no need for him and many others to die !! wakey wakey !! this  is MURDER !!
Responsible? Was he forced at gun point? Did Trump spike his drink with Covid?

Too bad he died from trump's negligence
when You get the cold or skin your knee - do you blame Trump as well?  Traffic issues - blame Trump.  Some people just have to hate.
I agree. The Democrats dislike Trump so much it's shocking that they couldn't come up with a fabulous candidate. Congress needs term limits because they all get out of touch with reality.
I just gave it to you...his own sons admitted they have gotten millions in loans from the Russians. Trump himself has talked up Putin for years now.
If Donald Trump was an MLB pitcher who just signed a mega deal she’d be sucking his Cheeto. She’s wrecked more pitchers careers than torn rotator cuff. Hello Zito and Pavano!
Remember President Trump never loses. He has Mar a Lago and Trump Tower. We lose though if he loses.
President Trump will win easily.
And now he is DEAD. Because of your boss...and his lies. You are also to blame as you are his mouthpiece to the press and push the constant lies that he spews from his mouth. How will explain that to your child when they learn about Trump and you in history class?
For all the hatred that Herman Cain directed towards the gay community I cannot say FUCK YOU AND GOOD RIDDANCE loud enough. Our country is a better place today because he’s dead. And he caught COVID at a Trump rally! 😂 Made my day. Love, Tom in St. Pete.You mean this book? Don’t worry the RNC will buy in bulk so it’s not a total flop, like it did for the previous one!

Herman Cain did not believe in wearing a mask, Trump did believe in wearing a mask.  Wearing a mask protects you from getting the virus, not completely but it help's tremendously.  He died because of the virus and supporting Trump's belief's #TrumpKillsAmericans

I am not sure if I should believe what you're saying. Say that now and say something else in the end is not the same. You called Trump a conman.and now you're bossom buddies..thanks but no thanks.
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.

Trump can't pronounce plasma, release my taxes, emoluments, Deutsche Bank, faithful, truth, I love my wife or Russian bounties on US soldiers. 🙄
Police brutality , That IS criminal activity.  tRump abuses his power, THAT is criminal activity.  Stone lies in court, THAT is criminal activity.  Cohen goes to jail for commiting crimes on individual 1, yet individual 1 walks, THAT is criminal activity, and the list. Now STFU.
Trump can't pronounce basic words like plasma 🙄 "plausma" 🤦🏻‍♀️
His briefing is nauseating.  I want to throw bricks at the tv for his utterly outrageous claims of voter fraud.  Suggestion:  Since according to him an "absentee ballot" is fine, everyone needs to request one so he'll shut up.
When I see #Apple news! lol Has anyone taken a bigger kick to the financial groin than #Apple for Trump confronting China.
Trump is setting up to nullify the November 3 Election. He’s saying it might take months and years before we find out who won. Folks, we need to hit the streets as soon as possible.
Trump does not deny that he wants to delay the election in November.
Trump bought the Miss America contest for access to young girls. And he’s clearly out of his mind.  And you’re a hypocrite and a fool.
Watching his propaganda news briefing, Trump said that things in Florida is getting better. Yesterday some 264 died and today, we’ll over 250 from COVID-19. How can he lie and the Fox crowd blelieves him. They are complecit in his crimes.
People don’t know what trump is really fighting against and that’s ok . The sheep will soon wake up
Trump, mcconnell and barr should be tried for treason as soon as possible.
Fauci is a self-serving political operative,  who enjoys sanctification given him by Democrats,  Mainstream media- Trump haters
#trumpslittlewarriors view on...  Masks: its my democratic right not to wear a mask! You can’t make me! Covid is fake!  Trump on delaying election: yup smart move! Elections can wait until covid is over and we can safely go and vote.  🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
I do like Republicans at least most of them but... wow Trump supporters are literally a bunch of cult members who can't think for themselves. Pure sheep. This isn't even a D vs R thing it's literally common sense vs ignorance.
We are in the field of math, science, and observations. The Ohio board did the right thing. Plus, not 1 anti trump/pro dr.fauci person has given a drug regimen that has been proven effective.
Can the President Cancel The Election &amp; What Would Happen? (LegalEagle’s...  via  #trump #vote #Election2020 #VoteTrumpOut
You must have the worst fucking logic ever... shame on those blaming Trump's TULSA rally? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 You must be missing a lot of facts and pictures because Herman Cain should have not went to that rally. But he believed Trump's words and died from stupidity. Plain and simple.
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via  #Trump #vote #Election2020 #VoteTrumpOut
MoscowMitch, Trump, &amp; DeSantis
#BidenPredictedTrumpDelayElection. Trump demands election be delayed.
Bottom line: the N.R.A. laundered Russian money into the 2016 campaign and illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign. The N.R.A. needs to have its tax-exempt status stripped. Our documentary details all of this. But we need help to get the doc out.
Delivery guy: “no tip?”  Me: “don’t vote for trump!”
Trump may not be eloquent by anyone’s standards, but he is a prodigious liar.
This pathetic b/c you killed him!  Trump mourns 'American Patriot, and great friend' Herman Cain
We didn’t deserve this type of health, economic, and political climate that Trump carelessly and recklessly led us to. If he is smart he’ll step down. I hear Roger Stone has room for another tattoo on his back.  Trump can end up as a tattoo on Stones back, if not it’ll be worse!
Charlie, all Trump does is lie, and self-aggrandize, and talk like the fascist he is.
Did you say ballot harvesting?
I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.
Call me crazy, but i think this is Trump coded speak for "dont worry i will keep POC out of your neighborhood."
That would be a lie. Trump IS a full blown racist.
What’s shocking is just the utter disrespect. I mean, Trump flat out told reporters “no” he wouldn’t be going to pay respects to John Lewis.
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
I just asked was he a hateful person, I looked up the word in the dictionary first but I wondered why John Lewis was viewed as hateful. So I asked about Trump to see how someone could say John was hateful but Trump wasn't. Its not that complicated.
It is! Stage one was COVID19- China virus. Remember Chinese government officials net wit President Trump's administration and President Trump, before we even found out about Coronavurus.
Diane: Don't blame innocent 2020. It was as shocked as we are. You can blame it on Trump. Why not? He did everything else wrong, why not this? Although todays earthquake didn't do any damage and turn to shit as everything else he touches!
Trump’s becoming a pariah. The way his kind should be treated....instead of allowed to be President.
No joke, Trump is getting off on this - the moment he realized he could tweet praise for a different black guy who just died on the same day he planned on blowing off respect for John Lewis, I’m sure a big smug grin crossed his face and he dove for his phone.
RIP to #HermanCain who died from COVID after attending a Trump rally without a mask. Not intending this as a “gotcha” at all, but a plea to anti-maskers to maybe reconsider the whole mask thing.
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.
Q: Did Herman Cain tweet that masks would not be required at Trump's controversial Tulsa rally? And was that tweet subsequently deleted?  A: Yes.
Onmy under President Trump's guidelines,  cutting red tape , in such short period of time Vaccine is in such advanced stages of Development
Well he could’ve been part of impeaching Trump but he’s spineless.
for the love of  can someone tell trump how to pronounce "plasma"  its not plausema
so I'm guessing trump wasn't at the funeral.....
Amazing how you and Cain and Trump and conservatives can say whatever they want, no matter how despicable, but God forbid someone criticizes a conservative, she is labeled hateful, no matter how valid the criticism. Look in the mirror.
And MBS as well, but I totally agree about Putin too. Trump is coddling all the foreign dictators &amp; tyrants from North Korea, to   Russia, to Saudi. Time to shut down Rizvi &amp; Milner. Don’t let these foreign tyrants buy up our social media. Down with fascism! #bringbackbetter
He died from the Trump Virus. You neglected to write that.
Doesn't take nerve,nor are they unaware or unconcerned.....they are the lowest common denominators a.k.a. ignorant racist trump supporters
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Is Trump a hateful person?
I’m keeping with my John Lewis groove. No Trump today.
I actually think the humiliating loss would lead to him not really returning to the job for those two months. His only agenda is “Trump.” He doesn’t care about what Mitch might want.   I think he’ll spend December stuffing money into suitcases and arranging to leave the USA.
To encourage them all to use the free filters provided to all Flint residents? Yeah I remember that. Man, I miss the days when that was the worst thing you could come up with against a president.   My turn:
Why didn't trump share his hydroxychloroquine with Herman Cain? He could have saved him.🤔
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now—you won’t get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone’s ideas before we vote.
Congress been asking for Trump taxes for 4 years. Nigga just said “nah, y’all can’t see that”. And nothing happened. He gonna do what he want with this election.
You are losing your hold on the Republican Party!!!  #sad #DementiaDon
If Trump want's to delay an election because it's too dangerous then children should not attend school until it is safe to do so.

Just what we need, Trump pizza. Great way to polarize and make the guy lose half his business
Watch THE POSTMAN with kevin costner. Shows how important the postal service can be during an apocalyptic type of reality. If trump gets re-elected, we’re there.
I don’t agree with Trump about moving the election, but if he wants to hurry up and get it over with in August, I can deal.
Exactly-1.200 doesn't even pay a month of rent in LA,CA and what about DWP-cars-food-etc-life-see them big $$$$$ peeps in DC try to Survive on that-No way No Way--Trump knows-if his wife hadn't married him--she might be one of the ladies in LA, worried on this-he knows the city.
What a shame that was his own last public tweet. Trump has more 🩸 on his hands.
Federal Court stops Trump's new "Public Charge" rules nationwide during the COVID pandemic!! This seems to mean the new Form I-944, Declaration of Self-Sufficiency will not be required, nor the invasive and extensive personal financial documentation. Questions? Call our office!
That makes me feel better. I just don’t trust trump and Barr, two truly evil people.
Not if it’s that crazy lady that is touting hydroxycloraquin which is shown to do more harm than good for COVID. Trump has a stake in the company that produces is; a Saudi company based in Malta where patent law is non existent. Trump is trying his best to move America backwards!
It’s easy.  For trump Cain became another useless black man.
They call him “Rudy” and he used to be Trump’s lawyer before unfrozen caveman Frankenstein (Barr) took over.
And don tRump was a Democrat at two different times in his overprivlaged life of affluenza
Trump wants everyone to safely vote?But he's rushing the schools to open?Yeah right..
is a clown and should retire along with Trump, Biden, McConnell, Pelosi, Schumer and all of the other politicians over 65!  And, we need term limits now!
The  cowardice will prevent  from ever doing the right thing. They’ll cheer on Trump ending elections then accuse Democrats of nonexistent voter fraud.
I went to an empty Trump rally &amp;  all I got was 💀
How can you say "our prayers"?  Trump's failed response to Covid-19 killed him.  No one believes you will pray for anyone because you lie constantly.
The Trump documentary he 'doesn't want you to see' is getting released
And Fox News appears to be covering the whole ceremony.  Trump must be strictly OAN today with his channel changer.
Damn. ⁦ got schooled by a girls’ action figure. 😂😂😂😂😂 Barbie shuts down Donald Trump Jr.'s snide tweet about new campaign dolls
That sucks. Hope it was worth going to that Trump rally.
Check out this Amazon deal: Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man by Trump Ph.D., Mary L.  via
No, Trump and Cain are responsible for his death. Also lack of common sense. Something Republicans seem to lack since Donald Trump
Just do better. If the very real responsibility is too much for you, find another job.   The media has failed to cover Trump as he should be covered. The failure is historic and has cost lives. DO BETTER. We’re screaming because we’re dying.
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
Trump uses  DAILY to spread lies a/b the election, to undermine election integrity, to suppress votes, &amp; to set the stage for trying to stop or overturn the election.    need to STOP letting Trump use #Twitter to endanger elections.
Well, he call the virus a hoax and refuse to wear a mask even though underlying health conditions. What do you think?. Republican need to use their brain and common sense and not listen to a man that is dumb as rocks-Trump
Have yall noticed how TRUMP hasn’t said anything about KANYE running? 🤔Now yall knowwww ol Twitter fingers would’ve had plenty to say if he wasn’t apart of this shambid #sitdownkanye
Good thing Trump had Herman Cain sign the Tulsa Rally #TrumpVirus waiver, right? This was so preventable.
Are you trying to distract from this news?? Worst GDP EVER!! E-V-E-R !!!!!  The TRUMP TOUCH (the Midas touch in reverse) doing what it does best bankrupting all it touches!!!
Every Trump is the scum at the bottom of the Barrel!
you’re so afraid that every American will actually get their chance to vote and you know it won’t be you in the end. The Trump family is the most corrupt family in American history. Every one of you are Traitors.
Trump said it is a Hoax.
Trump's desperation is palpable.
Another "winning" for Trump"
He was dancing loud &amp; proud at Trump Tulsa rally. Now he dead smh
Novel idea! That’s why I don’t put my Trump sticker on my car.
Herman Cain died from corona 🦠. I don’t want to imply that he contracted the 🦠 at Trump’ Tulsa rally but he was hospitalized less than two weeks after attending 🤷🏾‍♀️ 2020 is taking no prisoners
Former presidential candidate, Herman Cain, has died of #COVID19.   Cain, who was a member of the Republican Party, contracted the coronavirus “less than two weeks after attending President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June,” via
Herman Cain literally died for Trump.
Yes, but Trump is an accomplice
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!
Mr Cain was great American! Ardes supporter of Capitalism and President Trump supporter! He will be missed! MSM, Dems use this loss to promote promote political agenda: Mask were not required on Trump's rally, BUT not forbidden!
Wow, you better research! Our economy was STAGNANT, TOO MANY BUSINESS RESTRICTIONS. CAUSED MILLIONS HERE TO LOSE OUR JOBS ...PLEASE INVESTIGATE BEFORE TALKING CRAP, UNDER TRUMP WE HAD THE BEST ECONOMY EVER IN THE USA AND THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT EVER FOR ALL MINORITIES &amp; DISABLED!

He’s just a jackass. Ppl have been doing that with Trump his whole life. The average person can’t even begin to understand how someone can be stupid as Trump.  So they begin to say shit like “man he gotta know something we don’t.”

actually, the districts and electoral college helps the republicans because of gerrymandering. clinton got 2.8 million MORE votes than trump, and she still lost. and the dems ACTUALLY care about the people and districts, unlike republicans.
Cant sue the Trump campaign for it, unless he signed the NDA the Gen Z/KPOP signed online🤣🤣🤣 For rhe supporters who did not attend the rally, please express your generosity to the teenagers for saving your bloody lives from the hoax.
Absentee voting is mail in voting.. you think people are stupid. ... Well Trump supporters are stupid and unamerican for supporting a Dictator / Wannabe King. We fought a war to liberate America only to have some people wanting a monarchy?  .. #Wannabefuhrer

Attended Trump's rally in #Tulsa #Oklahoma without mask on June 20. Admitted to hospital with #Coronaviruson July 2. Died of #COVID19 on July 30. Wear your fucking masks in public everyday. 999 #Trumpvirus #nineninenine
NOT supporting Fox or Trump or Trump JR - the point of this is to help spread the word on Big Tech's censorship.
Same guy that told us its a hoax at Trump spreader rally?
Why would a black man support Donald trump?
i agree and wish for what you said!! but how do the american people get a fair election if trump steals the ballots from blue districts??
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
President Trump’s arrival on the American political scene unmasks, reveals,the loopholes in the American constitution. Am reluctant to  herald that the president is intelligent by covering which his predecessors could not discover; as a matter fact, he’s more audacious than them
Trump is suddenly talking about delaying the presidential election so you don't pay attention to this . . . This is the story you need to share, repost, and retweet. He did this, this is his virus, this is his economy   #Trumpvirus #TrumpEconomy
All trump voters please listen to your president!!!! Don’t vote on nov 3rd!!!
They are paid to post these things no good person voting for trump
You are correct, I misspoke, there should be criticism of a choice of such a polarizing figure just as I would expect criticism of Trump if he had chosen David Duke as his running mate and I would be the first to do so. My point is the ultimate arbiter is your vote.You mean this book? Don’t worry the RNC will buy in bulk so it’s not a total flop, like it did for the previous one!

You literally just ignored every single argument they mare ti every screenshot that you posted in bad faith and then proceeded to make your original argument as if nothing happened. These same Trump supporters wonder why regular people think that they’re mentally challenged.
Barr has undermined the historical integrity and independence of the DOJ He carried out political investigations of Trump's political opponents and supporyed Trump’s lunatic and completely discredited conspiracy theories about the “Dark State,”  OUTRAGEOUS
151821 have died in the US.  That means trump has killed more people than the world trade center Vietnam and hurricane Andrew combined
I am.  Trump 2020!!! #45till25
Harris sent many African Americans (some innocent) to jail for non violent crimes. Whereas Trump signed into law criminal justice reform. Can’t really predict if that factors into November but that’s the argument.
Did you expect Dump Trump to have a heart . Maybe if it were David Duke , you know he would be front and center !
Good. I support your decision and action. You make us proud Mr. President Trump.  #TRUMP2020
If Trump loses they will all go free.
I didn't know if I will be safe living in the neighborhood with a despicable and arrogant man. Barr’s new defense of Trump actually unmasks his corruption and confirmed that he reduced his role to that of a consigliore of a mob crime family. An AG' Interference with Criminal
Trump is the logical conclusion for the GOP. Comic-strip caricature of what they have become. Overblown in ego, greed and avarice. He complements it with hate and stupidity as well.
Trump ignored the pandemic with mostly in the crowd without mask and social distancing in Texas were COVID-19 is killing so many Americans. How can you trust and respect someone who's agenda is to destroy human life. An arrogant selfish and narcissistic who is destroying us.
Now was this just because he thought he should do trump a solid, or was he specifically told to do so.
Here’s proof Ladies and Gentlemen.  Google exec secretly recorded discussing 'plot to stop Trump re-election'
Yes that’s true, but we can all unite again!                                Let’s show them one more time in November, that those very same people from that hearing yesterday are the main reason why Donal J Trump is our President right now. We can do it!
I don’t know for the same reason the dems and Biden never trash China
. “Trump is..attempting to distract from his catastrophic, failed response to the pandemic by trying to divide our nation...Turning Americans against each other with total lies is unacceptable for a C-in-C...it’s especially heinous..in a moment of worsening crisis”
Which also proves I have not met one trump supporter with common sense
This guy came up to me at work and proceeded to call me a loser and how my company should be sorry I work for them after I told him I didn’t support trump (he asked) and than immediatly went on a rant on how much more of a saint he was than anyone else????

Teachers’ unions are emerging as a powerful force in determining the shape of public education during the pandemic and protecting our children from getting infested. They are fighting for stronger safety measures, while Trump and GOP governors want to put our childre at risk.
John Hopkins report says. “It is time to reset.” In the meantime Trump is back to promoting blatant falsehoods and conspiracy theories about COVID. He lied to the American public saying country’s coronavirus outbreak was in just a few states and nowhere else. “
How can you trust Trump falsely saying that We’re seeing improvements across the major large portions of our country. It’s corona-free,”  when Florida and Californis have break records today. The death toll is ticking up as well. Most states have seen increase of cases daily.

Trump Administration Refuses To Accept New DACA Applicants Despite Court Rulings
I just spit my Starbucks out! Best thing ever! Please don’t retweet this. We know how sensitive tRump is 😎 #TrumpleThinSkin
Beside creating a catastrophic disaster handling COVID-19 and eliminating many of us who are the most vulnerable in our Nation, Trump continues his disastrous obsession, spouting Covid conspiracy theories after resuming his coronavirus briefings last week. A World Power failures
Trump tries to avoid blaming Russia, even as Moscow continues operations against U.S.
If you still need this explained to you, then all I can say is ‘ bless your heart’. Oh, and as tRump learned yesterday, there is this amazing new invention called Google. 🤔
What Trump's boy who reduced his role to that of a consigliore of a mob crime family said about Trump's defiant to follow Supreme Court rulings by rejecting new applicants while launching a "comprehensive review" of DACA and whether to go forward to end the program. OUTRAGEOUS
What Trump's boy will said about his defiant relared to Supreme Court wh blocked the administration's effort to end the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Then two weeks ago, a court in Maryland told the administration to start accepting new DACA applicants.
The truth is that many of the questions were out of his prevue as AG and he should have answered as such. They were asked to show how far off the range he has gone. The fact that he even tried to answer shows that he thinks he has no boundaries and will protect tRump at all costs
a psychopath/sociopath has lost all ability to reason in a logical , moral coherent way!! #TRUMP is a perfect example!!
Anarchist Trump is destroying our Nation with the help of the most despicable so called "religious" Barr who infiltrated DOJ. He undermined the historical integrity and independence of the Department of Justice reducing his   role to that of a consigliore of a mob crime family.
Trump said he was cancelling throwing out the first pitch at the Yankees game. The Yankees said they never invited him 🤣💀⚰️
Trump dominated retired general Tata who repeated such conspiracy theories (now deleted from Tweeter) like former CIA head John Brennan wanted to assassinate Trump. As a superintendent of Wake County Schools. Tata was accused by the North Carolina NAACP of racial insensitivity.
Trump new strategy to create more divisiveness in our nominating a  conspiracy theorist who called Barack Obama a "terrorist leader with Islamic roots" . Anarchist Trump nominated this racist  to a high-level job at the Pentagon.
Biden is an ordinary professional politician, and Donald Trump's Presidency has seemed to last so long that his ordinariness seems exotic.

Wider spread and out of control for opening too soon and follow Trump's COVID-19 "guidelines". Don't wear a mask, don't follow Social Distance. CDC said the number of cases in the U.S. could be anywhere from two to 13 times higher than the official count

John Lewis was a great civil rights leader, who was instrumental in getting segregation abolished and getting the equal voting rights act passed.  And Trump doesn’t even have the ability to perform the duties of a president because of his personal rifts with John.  What a 💩!

Herman Cain did not believe in wearing a mask, Trump did believe in wearing a mask.  Wearing a mask protects you from getting the virus, not completely but it help's tremendously.  He died because of the virus and supporting Trump's belief's #TrumpKillsAmericans

We didn’t deserve this type of health, economic, and political climate that Trump carelessly and recklessly led us to. If he is smart he’ll step down. I hear Roger Stone has room for another tattoo on his back.  Trump can end up as a tattoo on Stones back, if not it’ll be worse!
Charlie, all Trump does is lie, and self-aggrandize, and talk like the fascist he is.
Did you say ballot harvesting?
I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.
Call me crazy, but i think this is Trump coded speak for "dont worry i will keep POC out of your neighborhood."
That would be a lie. Trump IS a full blown racist.

No joke, Trump is getting off on this - the moment he realized he could tweet praise for a different black guy who just died on the same day he planned on blowing off respect for John Lewis, I’m sure a big smug grin crossed his face and he dove for his phone.
RIP to #HermanCain who died from COVID after attending a Trump rally without a mask. Not intending this as a “gotcha” at all, but a plea to anti-maskers to maybe reconsider the whole mask thing.
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?
This is the part where Trump’s logic becomes insanely idiotic. How does distracting people from bad news with more bad news even work?
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.

Federal Court stops Trump's new "Public Charge" rules nationwide during the COVID pandemic!! This seems to mean the new Form I-944, Declaration of Self-Sufficiency will not be required, nor the invasive and extensive personal financial documentation. Questions? Call our office!
That makes me feel better. I just don’t trust trump and Barr, two truly evil people.
I suppose the all out asut on this drug goes well beyond Trump. I fear science won’t even be able to settle the issue. As I’ve learned from you the design and analysis of any study will be flawed are we doomed?
Bush showed up Clinton showed up Obama showed up  Donald Trump didn't show up  Rest In peace #JohnLewisfuneral
Not if it’s that crazy lady that is touting hydroxycloraquin which is shown to do more harm than good for COVID. Trump has a stake in the company that produces is; a Saudi company based in Malta where patent law is non existent. Trump is trying his best to move America backwards!
It’s easy.  For trump Cain became another useless black man.
They call him “Rudy” and he used to be Trump’s lawyer before unfrozen caveman Frankenstein (Barr) took over.
And don tRump was a Democrat at two different times in his overprivlaged life of affluenza
Trump wants everyone to safely vote?But he's rushing the schools to open?Yeah right..
is a clown and should retire along with Trump, Biden, McConnell, Pelosi, Schumer and all of the other politicians over 65!  And, we need term limits now!
The  cowardice will prevent  from ever doing the right thing. They’ll cheer on Trump ending elections then accuse Democrats of nonexistent voter fraud.
I went to an empty Trump rally &amp;  all I got was 💀
How can you say "our prayers"?  Trump's failed response to Covid-19 killed him.  No one believes you will pray for anyone because you lie constantly.
The Trump documentary he 'doesn't want you to see' is getting released
And Fox News appears to be covering the whole ceremony.  Trump must be strictly OAN today with his channel changer.

Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail By Amy Gardner and John Wagner
No, Trump and Cain are responsible for his death. Also lack of common sense. Something Republicans seem to lack since Donald Trump
Just do better. If the very real responsibility is too much for you, find another job.   The media has failed to cover Trump as he should be covered. The failure is historic and has cost lives. DO BETTER. We’re screaming because we’re dying.
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
Trump uses  DAILY to spread lies a/b the election, to undermine election integrity, to suppress votes, &amp; to set the stage for trying to stop or overturn the election.    need to STOP letting Trump use #Twitter to endanger elections.
Well, he call the virus a hoax and refuse to wear a mask even though underlying health conditions. What do you think?. Republican need to use their brain and common sense and not listen to a man that is dumb as rocks-Trump
Have yall noticed how TRUMP hasn’t said anything about KANYE running? 🤔Now yall knowwww ol Twitter fingers would’ve had plenty to say if he wasn’t apart of this shambid #sitdownkanye
Good thing Trump had Herman Cain sign the Tulsa Rally #TrumpVirus waiver, right? This was so preventable.
Are you trying to distract from this news?? Worst GDP EVER!! E-V-E-R !!!!!  The TRUMP TOUCH (the Midas touch in reverse) doing what it does best bankrupting all it touches!!!
Every Trump is the scum at the bottom of the Barrel!
you’re so afraid that every American will actually get their chance to vote and you know it won’t be you in the end. The Trump family is the most corrupt family in American history. Every one of you are Traitors.
Trump said it is a Hoax.
Trump's desperation is palpable.
Another "winning" for Trump"
He was dancing loud &amp; proud at Trump Tulsa rally. Now he dead smh
Novel idea! That’s why I don’t put my Trump sticker on my car.
Herman Cain died from corona 🦠. I don’t want to imply that he contracted the 🦠 at Trump’ Tulsa rally but he was hospitalized less than two weeks after attending 🤷🏾‍♀️ 2020 is taking no prisoners
Former presidential candidate, Herman Cain, has died of #COVID19.   Cain, who was a member of the Republican Party, contracted the coronavirus “less than two weeks after attending President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June,” via
Herman Cain literally died for Trump.
Yes, but Trump is an accomplice
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!
Mr Cain was great American! Ardes supporter of Capitalism and President Trump supporter! He will be missed! MSM, Dems use this loss to promote promote political agenda: Mask were not required on Trump's rally, BUT not forbidden!
Wow, you better research! Our economy was STAGNANT, TOO MANY BUSINESS RESTRICTIONS. CAUSED MILLIONS HERE TO LOSE OUR JOBS ...PLEASE INVESTIGATE BEFORE TALKING CRAP, UNDER TRUMP WE HAD THE BEST ECONOMY EVER IN THE USA AND THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT EVER FOR ALL MINORITIES &amp; DISABLED!

Trump ain’t even tweet a RIP for the nigga. Go grab at slice at his homeboy pizza shop tho. Lmaooooo
actually, the districts and electoral college helps the republicans because of gerrymandering. clinton got 2.8 million MORE votes than trump, and she still lost. and the dems ACTUALLY care about the people and districts, unlike republicans.
Cant sue the Trump campaign for it, unless he signed the NDA the Gen Z/KPOP signed online🤣🤣🤣 For rhe supporters who did not attend the rally, please express your generosity to the teenagers for saving your bloody lives from the hoax.
Absentee voting is mail in voting.. you think people are stupid. ... Well Trump supporters are stupid and unamerican for supporting a Dictator / Wannabe King. We fought a war to liberate America only to have some people wanting a monarchy?  .. #Wannabefuhrer

Same guy that told us its a hoax at Trump spreader rally?
Why would a black man support Donald trump?
i agree and wish for what you said!! but how do the american people get a fair election if trump steals the ballots from blue districts??
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
President Trump’s arrival on the American political scene unmasks, reveals,the loopholes in the American constitution. Am reluctant to  herald that the president is intelligent by covering which his predecessors could not discover; as a matter fact, he’s more audacious than them
Trump is suddenly talking about delaying the presidential election so you don't pay attention to this . . . This is the story you need to share, repost, and retweet. He did this, this is his virus, this is his economy   #Trumpvirus #TrumpEconomy
All trump voters please listen to your president!!!! Don’t vote on nov 3rd!!!
They are paid to post these things no good person voting for trump
You are correct, I misspoke, there should be criticism of a choice of such a polarizing figure just as I would expect criticism of Trump if he had chosen David Duke as his running mate and I would be the first to do so. My point is the ultimate arbiter is your vote.

Totally agree. Children need to go to school and exercise their brains, their social skills, etc. Dems want the Country go into deeper havoc no matter what the casualties are, for as long as it hurts Trump. Never seen so much evil in one National Political Party.

Trump literally has the number 666 associate with his first year in office - coincidence? Naw he’s the definition of EVIL 🔥🔥🔥
Lol when were items 3 and 4 debunked.  Trump just admitted he never confronted Putin in an interview this week.  And clearly the US is leading on new cases.  So much winning.
Reverse psychology? tRump always does the exact opposite of any advice given to him. Of course that gives Joe too much credit for any kind of strategy.
So we get GDP figures today. It should be a good day for Biden to blame Trump not the Chinese his handlers but Trump. It’s a pandemic Joe and you couldn’t have done anything but probably put more people in harms way. But go ahead get the hair on your legs standing up.

If we stay in fake society whats gonna happen next   love you my Trump destroy all of these fake society
Wat do you think about trump ? Is he working with pleiadians or other interdimensional beings ?
I beginning to think why we’ve seen no justice for Trump and America is most if not all the law makers have dirt on each other and to afraid to go after anybody.  Most if not all are guilty of something and that could be the #1 reason no one ever suffers the consequences
Last word for tonight. Then I may try to take a break.   Saying “what if Trump won’t leave” is voter suppression. That is likely not your aim, but NOTHING GOOD has EVER come from telling Americans their vote won’t count and they’re helpless.   So cut it out. Please. ‘Kay?
Trump hastening the deaths of his own supporters right before the election is some keen political intuition right there.
This was December. Before COVID. No way it’s improved since then. This is before the Russians paying bounties on US service heads story, too.
I saw something this year that showed Trump had lower approval ratings with the military than any Republican President in the modern age. Considering his endless disrespect for the military, it’s not surprising.
I'm really curious about who u guys voting for lol? (Only the people that dislike trump)
Florida!  My brother and sister in law are moving from CA to FL next week. So two more Trump votes in FL
25th Amendment anyone?  Trump's decision to move troops from Germany slammed as 'a gift to Putin'
when the pendulum swings it swing hard.   although,  a lot of this was pretty predictable in hindsight.  carter -&gt; reagan/bush -&gt; clinton -&gt; bush -&gt; obama -&gt; trump  the pendulum just swung REAL hard this time.
I'll be honest... I suspect Trump is in such poor health that, should he get COVID19, he would be pretty critical at best (I think his orange sunspray tan is to cover up a condition).
gonna let Trump win with the foolishness! Be clear and consistent!
no comparison to the Fed now.  Unless Trump appoints incompetence...
What’s your connection with that drug you are pushing? How much money are you making from its sales. That all you care about. Trump Virus

The disrespect for A G Barr was abominable Trump Deranngement Syndrome is out of control If the democRATS are not voted out of office we as a nation deserve the consequences of being passive It’s time to take action
151821 have died in the US.  That means trump has killed more people than the world trade center Vietnam and hurricane Andrew combinedin 2 terms! not 1. Trump is on pace to beat 398.
Trump is saying the virus us so bad but we can’t vote by mail.  Even though he does.
So what?  He picked it up at the rally.  Thanks to Trump, he’s dead.
my original point was that in order to defeat Trump, one must vote for Biden; especially in red or swing states.
Yes.  All us medical professionals are hero’s till a Democrat realizes we support Trump
and a reason to not have another Trump term.

Trump discredits Dr Fauci out of jealousy. He doesn’t care that his own people I.E. Herman Cain died from #coronavirus, let alone 150,000 others and why, it’s because #TrumpHatesScience.
HELLO DONALD TRUMP AND THERE ARE SOME BIBLICAL SITUATIONS THAT NEED TO BE CORRECTED BEFORE NOVEMBER!🤔🤗😎
What a tool trump is!
no, again there's gradients a different degrees of severity.  we have no control as peons to select the choices. so what would you have ppl do? bec another Trump term would be devasting.
Yes but they claim social injustice or what ever they call it but they make millions.  Trump will win over all this stuff going on.
true, it is, but with the astronomical chance would you rather Trump handle it or Biden?
Trump is a narcissist that cannot handle truth. Science is truth. #TrumpHatesScience
Yes. On Nov. 4th, Ms. Pelosi needs to fast track another impeachment. Once the Senate RS see how badly they lost, they'll gladly convict trump, if only as revenge for him taking them all down with him.
it's because under Trump I foresee my life continuing to be horrible. I'm disabled, and my only caretaker is my mom and she's 100% on board with Trump's rhetoric. my life is hell. so when it comes to 30% being brainwashed and the future of SCOTUS, the answer is clear.
I was pointing out both sides are to blame bro, you said well if it wasn't for trump getting rid of the pandemic task force, blah, blah, blah......point being both sides had no clue what to do, I mean China fucked us period, and you have to be blind not to see that.
I know you agree, Matt. I just could not help venting. And Trump knows as well as anyone that he's in big trouble, which is why he's ramping up the crazy. God help us..
Biden may want to arrest you, but Trump wants you dead.
that's only potentially, and definitely not racially charged and brazen like Trump's actions and rhetoric.
There is no way in hell Trump should be leading or close in any state.
Wait, Trump was in PA too?
There is no chance in hell they will let Biden debate Trump. It would be a mental massacre.
on the surface maybe. like a let's look at the Supreme Court: would you rather Trump appoint 1-2 judges for a lifetime appointment or Biden?
I fully understand all that, but having that stance will not change the candidates in November. so if you only look at it as "what is the best way for me to prevent another Trump term?" then the obvious answer is to consolidate votes behind a single opponent.
it raises the percentage of people that vote for Trump because it no longer dilutes it in the existing two party system. so his chances increase in swing states with the electoral college.
because it doesn't help the opposing candidate with the most votes to win. so that's how it benefits Trump, by not hurting him.
Cofounder of the federalist society says he now agrees with Dems that Trump is a fascist and that he should be immediately removed from office.
I support President Trump, but the Cornavirus package should be about the people in need and not the White House renovation or a new FBI building.
over who the DNC decides to f*ck us over with. we don't have control over that, but we do have control over whether or not Trump has another term.
which will only symbolically show something and potentially provide Trump a higher number of the total % of votes. so in a blue state that doesn't matter as much, but in a swing state it does.
you and I have no control over that situation. so if you would like to prevent another Trump term you can exercise your right to vote to do so. otherwise you're not.
sure, but holding votes hostage, will most likely not change those things. so in order to prevent another Trump term, it'ss most important to consolidate votes. the real core policy changes happen in the DNC committee.
sure, and what of a future Trump term? you're just ok with allowing that to happen?
the DNC f*cked us over, the candidates f*cking suck. but if you don't want Trump to our next pandemic, then the only resolution is to consolidate votes behind a single opponent. voting for any other candidates, although symbolic is a lost vote. as in it won't aid the winner.
how can voting for a candidate that has 100% chance to lose not benefit Trump?
and although that is symbolic, in essence that aids Trump's possible win.
I understand that, I just think it can happen in future elections and not when Trump is f*cking president
and Trump is?
yes, he does, but he hasn't released a future budget that cuts SSDI and Medicare $880B; Trump has. I'm disabled and rely on those programs. he also won't gas peaceful protesters in order to have a photo op with a Bible in front of a Church.
Umm.. so not cool that these comments are freakin HYSTERICAL
So there is your "intellegence".....if that doesn't make you "wonder" why Trump started "defunding WHO"......well then it's fairly obvious there was a lot moving parts in the virus.
Trump is the only President that I've seen that discourages voting.
the most logical way to beat Trump is to consolidate votes behind one single candidate to win. it's just a matter of fact. so if you don't want Trump to potentially handle a covid-22, then one would have to unfortunately vote for Biden to prevent that.
I don't know bro, The Who said it wasn't an issue back then, that's the sole purpose they are funded, so what are suppose to do? Trump was called a racist for cutting off China Travel early on, Monday Morning Quarterbacking at its finest I guess.
Or maybe he deserves it? I just want the filth of trump gone from my life.
What planet are you on.    Trump will win in a landslide.   The silent majority is real.

He was so smart he listened to Trump instead of Fauci.
The biggest landslide in history: Same prediction the entire MSM made in 2016 —- how’d that work out for you. And to think, there was actually a candidate running against Trump in 2016. This year Biden doesn’t even know he’s running.
Bill, that’s your problem; too often, you’re quick to Trump down without considering what he may be inferring.

Trump is the guy that flings the board game and all the pieces across the room when he loses.
What is is there to admit weirdos? You guys are something else, it's like you guys are all excited&amp; giving high-fives bc someone died that as a Trump Supporter, hey what happened to BLM? Oh wait, not for Black conservatives with a difference of opinions, Jesus.......homies 🤦🏿‍♂️
Problem is, that would plainly be a coup, and for a coup you need the support of the military. Trump seems to have pissed them off along with pretty much everybody else, so no, that isn't going to work.
Trump stole your radio bit!
Received my application for mail-in voting today from the Center for Voter Info here in Florida  It says county supervisors recommend EVERYONE use mail-in  It says 69% of Fl voters used mail-in in 2016  trump must be crying
Trump doesn't give a shit whatsoever about Cain passing. Not even the slightest.
I never did eat one of his pizzas, it hasn't killed me, unlike not wearing a mask at his buddy Trump's rally.
To the Republicans who also stopped supporting Trump like myself, I want to encourage that it's OK to say you were wrong about Obama, I did. It's a positive way to show the other side that you are human and it can help build trust with each other. We need that now in this fight.
The Washington, DC pizza parlor. Just kidding, who thinks of going to Tulsa if you want to have a trump death wish.
If only doctors were allowed to tell you about the cure without censorship! OH WAIT TRUMP WAS RIGHT HYDRACLORIQUIN DOES WORK!  No doubt HERMAN CAIN IS IN THE ARMS OF JESUS🙏🏼
Too bad trump wasn’t onboard
In coming speeches Trump's ass is grass, and Obama's the lawn mower.
Trump needs to fasten his seatbelt. Obama was going to cut loose on him until November, AND beyond.
If the mail in ballot is  so bad why did Trump send out info to people via mail this week on how to obtain a mail in ballot.
Would-be dictator Donald Trump would be unstoppable in a second term. That must not happen
If you follow Dems, you will know that "Do nothing Dems" from Trump and his pundits are a flat out lie. Dems are fighting all sorts of missions for the people.
The passing of a trump token, Herman was no more than a photo op to Trump. It's very sad somebody else bought into Trump's bullshit  not believing the scientists and the experts to practice safe social distancing and wearing a mask.
Did Trump actually bleach himself?
Well Don if the democrats decide to cheat like they did in 2016 i guarantee you President Trump we'll get to the bottom of it so that the elections are uncheatable.
It's going really well actually and has taken off. Have you followed  that's another group showing there's plenty of former Trump supporters.
Trump throws a temper tantrum over a respectful criticism over his undoing, yet Barack Obama was demonized, threatened, defamed, and yet it never bothered him. It still amazes me why I never questioned conservative propaganda. He is nothing at all of what they say about him.
I used to watched Fox News, I believed in the birther, and the hateful lies about him. When I learned the truth about liberal values, I've learned to truth about Dem politicians like Obama, how did the demonizing not bother him, like how Trump is bothered by criticism.
Share  video far and wide because what will it take for Americans to do the thing like wear a damn mask. What will it take for MAGA to realize Trump doesn't care about them because they are literally #dyingforTrump

Fox News, Trump, and many Republican pundits have been down playing #COVID19, how many lives lost will it take for them to be held accountable. I really believe Twitter needs to act on their misinformation to prevent more deaths.
Herman Cain died from coronavirus. Does that matter to you? How many in this line will get it and die? Guess they're willing to die for trump.
Isn’t Turning Point one of the groups touting the trump “hydroxy” regimen as a cure for #COVID? Tragic, unnecessary losses.
He will never ever loose, President Trump is always a winner.
May the ghost of Herman Cain haunt trump forever
I’m confused...it’s safe for my children to go to school, but not safe to vote? It’s safe to shop and work, but not to vote? It’s safe to go to a trump rally, but not to vote? Worried that people who value the truth and...well...America...may not vote for you? #pinnedtweet?

Well Maria...I'm sure the point was that Trump canceled the trip to throw out a pitch he was never invited to do in the first place.  HE CANCELED A FAKE TRIP! ON TWITTER!  FOR EVERYONE TO SEE!  But hey, he can "person, woman, man, camera TV" better than anyone I know
Trump is not attending John Lewis’ funeral.  What an asshole!
You don't need a PHD in History to point out that we voted right on schedule in 1864 with the Civil War still raging. I think we can handle this. Trump is trying to distract from the fact that the GDP just took a dump of about 1/3.

I said four years ago before he took office, that he would cause a civil war. And everything he has done has been to that extreme, and the GOP which has never had the people in mind, only their corporate owners. Trump will find a way to permanently stay and office, be ready.
Sweeping under the rug doesn’t begin to describe this situation. Always knew trump was a stupid egotistical person. But... this is a new type of low. Everyone involved should face severe consequences. But as usual Trump is untouchable. Frustrating!
Joe Biden is hiring somebody else to debate Donald Trump because he doesn't have the mental capability and he knows he's on his way to  Gitmo for treason and crimes against humanity, October 2020 will be a Biblical day.. they made the prison bigger to fit your treasonous friends.

Why do you continue to support Donald Trump when he has proven he shows zero regard for the American people's safety or well-being?  His COVID response alone should be enough to lose him this election. Let alone everything else.
both are horrible. but neither explicitly elicited violence or tear gas against peaceful protesters. I know he sucks. but if you don't want 4 more years of Trump. logically it makes the most sense to consolidate votes behind a single opponent.
it's history; not what's proposed. we know 100% what Trump wants.
You must be joking !! He's a Russian sympathizer. A vote for tRumP is insane !! How bout appx 20,000 lies? Bounties on our soldiers?? Using military forces to make a photo op?? He's a racist. He's a womanizing narrcisistic LOOSER !! Oh yeah a bully and a big BABY !!  Embarrassing

Remember when 🤔 Trump and Putin had a private meeting and no one knows what was discussed...now Russia has a vaccine for the virus and it'll be ready in 2 weeks...
Trump will be tweeting the craziest s*** that's ever come off his phone to distract from that funeral.
I heard Trump and Putin planned this virus 🤔 remember how they had a private meeting and no one knows what they discussed...do you know Russia says they have a vaccine for the virus...it'll be ready in 2 weeks....
And now they’re like “Big Tech is out to take down trump! Let’s repost it again and again!”
really it's more than that for me. I'm disabled, and on both SSDI and Medicare. Trump has proposed a future budget that cuts those programs $880B I require those to live.
Empirical evidence and Trump should never be used in the same sentence ever again, unless it's an indictment.
Tonight the Vodka is flowing in the Kremlin as an American President delivers a great geo-political victory to the Russians. Trump’s strategic withdrawal has been the stuff of Soviet/Russian fever dreams for 75 years. Now it’s real. Trump is a fool who has made America weak
You could have done something about Trump but instead you chose profit over holding Trump accountable.
I challenge anyone to find one thing Trump has done that has been beneficial to Russia since getting elected.
No - I said if you’re voting or wanting Trump to win get the fuck out of my party. Isn’t that what I said Archer? But nice try twisting the truth.

I understand never Biden "progressives" may have trouble trusting us former Trump supporters, but If we could break free from cult MAGA &amp; regret that our vote has put our country in the state of where it's at, then maybe listen to us voting for Biden would save our Democracy.
I know I live in the weeds here and want some specific answers from Bezos about 3P seller data, but it's *crazy* to me that they're wading through Uighurs, the JEDI contract, Trump Jr.'s tweets, Google hidden lyrics and so much more all in one hearing. #antitrusthearing
Being on both sides, the commentary that doesn't support Trump is much more intelligent, thought out, &amp; logical compared to MAGA commentary. It makes sense why MSM was always dismissed as fake news because they don't want people to be able to think for themselves by using logic.
Thank you 🙏 President Trump!!!!!
Hillary Clinton was right about Trump, she is right about Joe Biden, that is the tweet.
Trump's refusal to show up for his funeral speaks volume.
Thank you  for asking Trump about the Russian bounty of our soldiers. As a veteran, and also a former Trump supporter, I'm disgusted on the treatment towards this President has given to the Military &amp; Vets.

It's not a valid point. Opting out of voting is helping Trump which closes the door of any pathway to progressivism. It means more conservative judges, more years of tyranny this is a selfish bratty move and people have died in this country to fight for their right to vote.
First thing I think of when I see the American flag is trumpism and the Orange Idiot that's ruining our country.   I practically had to force myself to put a small US flag on my front door on July 4, something I never had second thoughts about before tRump.  #nevermypresident
Who spray tans Trump?
Please don’t give into Trump on the a New FBI BUILDING in the COVID-19 Bill.  Trump is crazy.
I believe Joe Biden has a better chance to beat Trump than Sanders. A Joe Biden presidency is a realistic pathway to progressivsim. Joe Biden's policies are a great first step for our country to move in the right direction.
Sweetheart, do you actually think Trump has ever read the Bible? And do we just wake up in a new day being forgiven? Even having done nothing to deserve it? So he can go on each day being a sexual predator and racist, but will wake up the next full of grace?
Everything that MAGA accuses Dems of doing is the projection of what Trump actually does.
Trump only thinks of what is good for Trump and what he can get out of it.
A person can go from supporting Trump, defending manipulation of the 2nd amendment, manipulation of immigration, the hateful world view of Islam, to thinking racism was over in the 60's, that everyone has to pay for medical care, kneeling for the flag is offensive to Military to
Trump doesn't give a s*** about American kids in school nor Americans losing their houses and evictions. Don't be so naive.
Trump doesn't like peaceful protest he only likes chaos.
This is the Trump campaign shifting gears.
Trump says he has not spoken to Putin about alleged Russian bounties on U.S. troops  our troops are at risk &amp; he won't do anything, because I think Putin has something on him and Trumps afraid of him. I wonder how much money Trump owes Russia?
I've reached 170 k followers. Thank you to everyone,  especially the people who stuck with me &amp; supported me from the beginning of my journey when I first began to question Trump &amp; the Republican Party. I'm just a regular guy who was lucky to be encouraged to think for myself.
This veteran who is a former Trump supporter will definitely help you remove America's biggest mistake.
You act is if you liberals don’t do the same to Trump. Get off your high horse
Ok well if that’s pathetic, then it’s rather pathetic that you’re judging trump on his past🤷🏻‍♂️ you clearly have an opinion on his past personal life as you brought it up yourself. If Trump’s past life is subject to shaming than so is hers. You can’t have it both ways

I sure can't stand Trumpin 2 terms! not 1. Trump is on pace to beat 398.
Trump is saying the virus us so bad but we can’t vote by mail.  Even though he does.
So what?  He picked it up at the rally.  Thanks to Trump, he’s dead.
my original point was that in order to defeat Trump, one must vote for Biden; especially in red or swing states.
Yes.  All us medical professionals are hero’s till a Democrat realizes we support Trump

HELLO DONALD TRUMP AND THERE ARE SOME BIBLICAL SITUATIONS THAT NEED TO BE CORRECTED BEFORE NOVEMBER!🤔🤗😎
What a tool trump is!
no, again there's gradients a different degrees of severity.  we have no control as peons to select the choices. so what would you have ppl do? bec another Trump term would be devasting.
Yes but they claim social injustice or what ever they call it but they make millions.  Trump will win over all this stuff going on.
true, it is, but with the astronomical chance would you rather Trump handle it or Biden?
Trump is a narcissist that cannot handle truth. Science is truth. #TrumpHatesScience
Yes. On Nov. 4th, Ms. Pelosi needs to fast track another impeachment. Once the Senate RS see how badly they lost, they'll gladly convict trump, if only as revenge for him taking them all down with him.
it's because under Trump I foresee my life continuing to be horrible. I'm disabled, and my only caretaker is my mom and she's 100% on board with Trump's rhetoric. my life is hell. so when it comes to 30% being brainwashed and the future of SCOTUS, the answer is clear.
I was pointing out both sides are to blame bro, you said well if it wasn't for trump getting rid of the pandemic task force, blah, blah, blah......point being both sides had no clue what to do, I mean China fucked us period, and you have to be blind not to see that.
I know you agree, Matt. I just could not help venting. And Trump knows as well as anyone that he's in big trouble, which is why he's ramping up the crazy. God help us..
Biden may want to arrest you, but Trump wants you dead.
that's only potentially, and definitely not racially charged and brazen like Trump's actions and rhetoric.
There is no way in hell Trump should be leading or close in any state.
There is no chance in hell they will let Biden debate Trump. It would be a mental massacre.
on the surface maybe. like a let's look at the Supreme Court: would you rather Trump appoint 1-2 judges for a lifetime appointment or Biden?
I fully understand all that, but having that stance will not change the candidates in November. so if you only look at it as "what is the best way for me to prevent another Trump term?" then the obvious answer is to consolidate votes behind a single opponent.
MAGA, Trump doesn’t care about you, wake up.
The younger the better? Epstein Trump Maxwell
it raises the percentage of people that vote for Trump because it no longer dilutes it in the existing two party system. so his chances increase in swing states with the electoral college.
because it doesn't help the opposing candidate with the most votes to win. so that's how it benefits Trump, by not hurting him.
Cofounder of the federalist society says he now agrees with Dems that Trump is a fascist and that he should be immediately removed from office.
I support President Trump, but the Cornavirus package should be about the people in need and not the White House renovation or a new FBI building.
over who the DNC decides to f*ck us over with. we don't have control over that, but we do have control over whether or not Trump has another term.
which will only symbolically show something and potentially provide Trump a higher number of the total % of votes. so in a blue state that doesn't matter as much, but in a swing state it does.
you and I have no control over that situation. so if you would like to prevent another Trump term you can exercise your right to vote to do so. otherwise you're not.
sure, but holding votes hostage, will most likely not change those things. so in order to prevent another Trump term, it'ss most important to consolidate votes. the real core policy changes happen in the DNC committee.
sure, and what of a future Trump term? you're just ok with allowing that to happen?
the DNC f*cked us over, the candidates f*cking suck. but if you don't want Trump to our next pandemic, then the only resolution is to consolidate votes behind a single opponent. voting for any other candidates, although symbolic is a lost vote. as in it won't aid the winner.
how can voting for a candidate that has 100% chance to lose not benefit Trump?
and although that is symbolic, in essence that aids Trump's possible win.
I understand that, I just think it can happen in future elections and not when Trump is f*cking president
and Trump is?
yes, he does, but he hasn't released a future budget that cuts SSDI and Medicare $880B; Trump has. I'm disabled and rely on those programs. he also won't gas peaceful protesters in order to have a photo op with a Bible in front of a Church.
Umm.. so not cool that these comments are freakin HYSTERICAL
So there is your "intellegence".....if that doesn't make you "wonder" why Trump started "defunding WHO"......well then it's fairly obvious there was a lot moving parts in the virus.
Trump is the only President that I've seen that discourages voting.
the most logical way to beat Trump is to consolidate votes behind one single candidate to win. it's just a matter of fact. so if you don't want Trump to potentially handle a covid-22, then one would have to unfortunately vote for Biden to prevent that.
I don't know bro, The Who said it wasn't an issue back then, that's the sole purpose they are funded, so what are suppose to do? Trump was called a racist for cutting off China Travel early on, Monday Morning Quarterbacking at its finest I guess.
Pompous Pompeo refuses to answer the simple question, instead stutters and deflects. He’s a key player in Trump’s con, along with Barr.

The biggest landslide in history: Same prediction the entire MSM made in 2016 —- how’d that work out for you. And to think, there was actually a candidate running against Trump in 2016. This year Biden doesn’t even know he’s running.

Problem is, that would plainly be a coup, and for a coup you need the support of the military. Trump seems to have pissed them off along with pretty much everybody else, so no, that isn't going to work.

Trump doesn't give a shit whatsoever about Cain passing. Not even the slightest.
I never did eat one of his pizzas, it hasn't killed me, unlike not wearing a mask at his buddy Trump's rally.
To the Republicans who also stopped supporting Trump like myself, I want to encourage that it's OK to say you were wrong about Obama, I did. It's a positive way to show the other side that you are human and it can help build trust with each other. We need that now in this fight.

If you follow Dems, you will know that "Do nothing Dems" from Trump and his pundits are a flat out lie. Dems are fighting all sorts of missions for the people.
The passing of a trump token, Herman was no more than a photo op to Trump. It's very sad somebody else bought into Trump's bullshit  not believing the scientists and the experts to practice safe social distancing and wearing a mask.
Did Trump actually bleach himself?
Well Don if the democrats decide to cheat like they did in 2016 i guarantee you President Trump we'll get to the bottom of it so that the elections are uncheatable.
It's going really well actually and has taken off. Have you followed  that's another group showing there's plenty of former Trump supporters.
Trump throws a temper tantrum over a respectful criticism over his undoing, yet Barack Obama was demonized, threatened, defamed, and yet it never bothered him. It still amazes me why I never questioned conservative propaganda. He is nothing at all of what they say about him.
I used to watched Fox News, I believed in the birther, and the hateful lies about him. When I learned the truth about liberal values, I've learned to truth about Dem politicians like Obama, how did the demonizing not bother him, like how Trump is bothered by criticism.

So the big gift to Kodak was announced Tuesday, the day after their stock trading volume went from max 215k shares/day to over 1.6m. Nothing to see here, I'm sure:
Fox News, Trump, and many Republican pundits have been down playing #COVID19, how many lives lost will it take for them to be held accountable. I really believe Twitter needs to act on their misinformation to prevent more deaths.
Herman Cain died from coronavirus. Does that matter to you? How many in this line will get it and die? Guess they're willing to die for trump.
Isn’t Turning Point one of the groups touting the trump “hydroxy” regimen as a cure for #COVID? Tragic, unnecessary losses.

There's absolutely nothing wrong in pointing this out, because regardless if you like Trump we libs actually want people to be safe and not die from #COVID19, my condolences to Herman Cain's family.
But it’s ok for racist Trump to use stereotypical racist scenarios?
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Imagine a doctor spending all his time on Twitter decrying Trump.  🤮🤦‍♂️😂
Hope your next 4 years with trump are blessed. 😂😂
Enjoy trump for another 4 years 😂😂
Well Maria...I'm sure the point was that Trump canceled the trip to throw out a pitch he was never invited to do in the first place.  HE CANCELED A FAKE TRIP! ON TWITTER!  FOR EVERYONE TO SEE!  But hey, he can "person, woman, man, camera TV" better than anyone I know
. hold Trump accountable for his tweets pushing for voter suppression.
Trump is not attending John Lewis’ funeral.  What an asshole!
You don't need a PHD in History to point out that we voted right on schedule in 1864 with the Civil War still raging. I think we can handle this. Trump is trying to distract from the fact that the GDP just took a dump of about 1/3.
This former Trump supporter is ready to vote for  Hell yes.
The whole MAGA mentality didn’t start with Trump, it started with upbringing, then molded using fear by propaganda then it’s turned to hate and motivates people to elect like minded hateful people like Trump.
Continue reporting Trump’s misinformation about election.
So...Eric, would this be 230 AM or PM?  Trump refers to the year 2030 as "230"
Trump is a liar  Anything and everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie  Shouldn’t be surprising anymore  But action should be taken!

This happened after Trump’s phone call with Putin. I wonder what else they talked about.
Trump is really doing us a favor.
That’s what Republicans like  lowered themselves too sir, trolls for retweets, likes and followers. They’ve lost the moral authority long ago when they’ve acquitted Trump for violating the constitution.
No Ad but 63,000 ads on your Campaign.  All propaganda.  You want a cultural war. But like everything you do  Only your 15 percent care  Donald Trump’s Campaign Is Pretending There’s No Pandemic
Just rcvd this in the mail..  Guess the 2016 election was invalid according to trump
I have a message from god through my guardian angels I need to get to president trump or his immediate family members/ mike pence and family.
Just do it &amp; save our great country!  Vote RED,  ticket! Trump 2020!  MAGA.    Maybe after the Dems up there are spanked &amp; thrown out the next time they win they will be WOKE!  I used to be a Democrat, I got on to them a long time ago by just being attentive!
According to Twitter, calling for Jewish genocide is A-OK, but calling out mob violence gets you banned. Got it.  Israeli legislature presses Twitter on 'double standard' between Iran's 'genocide' tweets and Trump's
Florida for Trump!
I said four years ago before he took office, that he would cause a civil war. And everything he has done has been to that extreme, and the GOP which has never had the people in mind, only their corporate owners. Trump will find a way to permanently stay and office, be ready.
Sweeping under the rug doesn’t begin to describe this situation. Always knew trump was a stupid egotistical person. But... this is a new type of low. Everyone involved should face severe consequences. But as usual Trump is untouchable. Frustrating!
Joe Biden is hiring somebody else to debate Donald Trump because he doesn't have the mental capability and he knows he's on his way to  Gitmo for treason and crimes against humanity, October 2020 will be a Biblical day.. they made the prison bigger to fit your treasonous friends.
Thanks to Donald Trump and Barr. Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton and the rest of them will be heading to Gitmo for treason and crimes against humanity by October 2020. they are so scared they are changing their depends 10 times a day they are not strong women they are pure evil.

Trump's America
Why do you continue to support Donald Trump when he has proven he shows zero regard for the American people's safety or well-being?  His COVID response alone should be enough to lose him this election. Let alone everything else.
both are horrible. but neither explicitly elicited violence or tear gas against peaceful protesters. I know he sucks. but if you don't want 4 more years of Trump. logically it makes the most sense to consolidate votes behind a single opponent.
it's history; not what's proposed. we know 100% what Trump wants.
So, Trump did read the report on the Russian bounty on our soldiers when it was first mentioned and lied saying he didn’t know about it.
You must be joking !! He's a Russian sympathizer. A vote for tRumP is insane !! How bout appx 20,000 lies? Bounties on our soldiers?? Using military forces to make a photo op?? He's a racist. He's a womanizing narrcisistic LOOSER !! Oh yeah a bully and a big BABY !!  Embarrassing
Hey  just an FYI, a lot of Trump supporters believe these conspiracy theories about corona virus.
Giving credit to where it's due, Trump has been an a****** his entire life.
Trump still hasn’t asked Putin about the Russian bounty on our soldiers.
Johnny doesn't need tik Tok for spying as Long as Trump has a Twitter account. Tell Donnie telegraph!

Trump is truly a narcissist with the whole do as I say instead of do as I do with #MailInBallots.

He will always put trump first.
Good job today Pres!                  Trump 2020 MAGA 🇺🇸.           We ❤️ you!!!!
We have 150,000 dead from #COVID19 &amp; Trump is trying to manipulate the American people into thinking that mail in voting is wrong so he could prevent people from voting for Biden. He knows his supporters would be stupid enough to go to the booths during the pandemic.
No, no sane person would vote for that empty human! Trump 2020  - Landslide!!!
You GO Leo!!!  MAGA 🇺🇸.  TRUMP 2020 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Not on my death bed would I vote for this empty VESSEL Joe Biden!                                    TRUMP 2020.                                     MAGA 🇺🇸
Your time is short. Your going to be voted out. Maybe Trump will give you a deal on a condo in Trump tower.
Thank you Vernon for all your work!  I will be voting for Trump, best POTUS in my lifetime &amp; I am not a young chick!!  Trump 2020 MAGA 🇺🇸
Why can't Trump just go to Scotland and Count windmills ?
MAGA feels if they can intimidate me like the way Trump intimidates his opposition that would scare me off twitter. Believe me if I had a nickel for every troll that said I made a profit off of this I would be rich. No profit was made, Ive learned truth and will not be silent.
Remember when 🤔 Trump and Putin had a private meeting and no one knows what was discussed...now Russia has a vaccine for the virus and it'll be ready in 2 weeks...
Trump will be tweeting the craziest s*** that's ever come off his phone to distract from that funeral.
I don’t think Trump really covered up his racism, it’s one of the reasons why he was elected.
I heard Trump and Putin planned this virus 🤔 remember how they had a private meeting and no one knows what they discussed...do you know Russia says they have a vaccine for the virus...it'll be ready in 2 weeks....
And now they’re like “Big Tech is out to take down trump! Let’s repost it again and again!”
really it's more than that for me. I'm disabled, and on both SSDI and Medicare. Trump has proposed a future budget that cuts those programs $880B I require those to live.
I moved to Florida into a suburban neighborhood during my high school years, and Brevard county is generally a white conservative neighborhood which influenced me in my upbringing and adult life to vote for Trump, &amp; you want to keep it white &amp; conservative, I’m not surprised.
I moved to Florida from New York into a suburban neighborhood during my high school years, and Brevard county is generally a white conservative neighborhood which influenced me in my upbringing and adult life to vote for Trump. He  wants to keep it white &amp; conservative.
Empirical evidence and Trump should never be used in the same sentence ever again, unless it's an indictment.
Tonight the Vodka is flowing in the Kremlin as an American President delivers a great geo-political victory to the Russians. Trump’s strategic withdrawal has been the stuff of Soviet/Russian fever dreams for 75 years. Now it’s real. Trump is a fool who has made America weak
Yesterday and everyday for holding Trump accountable.
You could have done something about Trump but instead you chose profit over holding Trump accountable.
You could have done something about Trump but instead you chose profit over holding Trump accountable.

I challenge anyone to find one thing Trump has done that has been beneficial to Russia since getting elected.
No - I said if you’re voting or wanting Trump to win get the fuck out of my party. Isn’t that what I said Archer? But nice try twisting the truth.
I'm fat af, but hate Trump.... And Biden.
Why wouldn’t Trump ask Putin about the Russian bounty on our soldiers when he was in the phone with Putin.
Actually...the only people I've seen that are sick and tired of it are those whose names end in Trump, Gaetz, Nunes, Jordan and Cruz Quite the gang right there 👆😒
My point is this, learn from our mistake because a no vote is a vote for Trump who is no where near like Biden.
I understand never Biden "progressives" may have trouble trusting us former Trump supporters, but If we could break free from cult MAGA &amp; regret that our vote has put our country in the state of where it's at, then maybe listen to us voting for Biden would save our Democracy.
I know I live in the weeds here and want some specific answers from Bezos about 3P seller data, but it's *crazy* to me that they're wading through Uighurs, the JEDI contract, Trump Jr.'s tweets, Google hidden lyrics and so much more all in one hearing. #antitrusthearing
Being on both sides, the commentary that doesn't support Trump is much more intelligent, thought out, &amp; logical compared to MAGA commentary. It makes sense why MSM was always dismissed as fake news because they don't want people to be able to think for themselves by using logic.
Thank you 🙏 President Trump!!!!!
Hillary Clinton was right about Trump, she is right about Joe Biden, that is the tweet.
Trump's refusal to show up for his funeral speaks volume.
Thank you  for asking Trump about the Russian bounty of our soldiers. As a veteran, and also a former Trump supporter, I'm disgusted on the treatment towards this President has given to the Military &amp; Vets.
You're a Brooklyn girl now, Stephanie. And those four letter expletives are the right words when it comes to Trump
Do you have any merchandise saying we are proud to be former Trump supporters?
Actually the route that Trump is wanting to use is fascism.
wouldn't clear peaceful protesters for a photo op with a Bible in front of a Church. November is a vote for Trump or not. so you are ok with something like that? secret police etc?
still better than Trump.
He wants it to up the value of Trump hotel and no other hotels come in and compete... People don't need to go back to school...they just need to pay attention

Right her big donors and her quid pro quo politics got her there. The same kind of quid pro quo that falsely accused trump of and impeached him for
Last point, if you think Biden is the same as Trump, you are in a cult.
It's not a valid point. Opting out of voting is helping Trump which closes the door of any pathway to progressivism. It means more conservative judges, more years of tyranny this is a selfish bratty move and people have died in this country to fight for their right to vote.
First thing I think of when I see the American flag is trumpism and the Orange Idiot that's ruining our country.   I practically had to force myself to put a small US flag on my front door on July 4, something I never had second thoughts about before tRump.  #nevermypresident
Please don’t give into Trump on the a New FBI BUILDING in the COVID-19 Bill.  Trump is crazy.
I believe Joe Biden has a better chance to beat Trump than Sanders. A Joe Biden presidency is a realistic pathway to progressivsim. Joe Biden's policies are a great first step for our country to move in the right direction.
Sweetheart, do you actually think Trump has ever read the Bible? And do we just wake up in a new day being forgiven? Even having done nothing to deserve it? So he can go on each day being a sexual predator and racist, but will wake up the next full of grace?
Everything that MAGA accuses Dems of doing is the projection of what Trump actually does.
Trump only thinks of what is good for Trump and what he can get out of it.
A person can go from supporting Trump, defending manipulation of the 2nd amendment, manipulation of immigration, the hateful world view of Islam, to thinking racism was over in the 60's, that everyone has to pay for medical care, kneeling for the flag is offensive to Military to
While driving around upscale Florida neighborhoods, could understand his thought process. Lots of Trump signs. Turns my stomach every time I see one.
Trump doesn't give a s*** about American kids in school nor Americans losing their houses and evictions. Don't be so naive.
Trump doesn't like peaceful protest he only likes chaos.
This is the Trump campaign shifting gears.
Trump says he has not spoken to Putin about alleged Russian bounties on U.S. troops  our troops are at risk &amp; he won't do anything, because I think Putin has something on him and Trumps afraid of him. I wonder how much money Trump owes Russia?
I've reached 170 k followers. Thank you to everyone,  especially the people who stuck with me &amp; supported me from the beginning of my journey when I first began to question Trump &amp; the Republican Party. I'm just a regular guy who was lucky to be encouraged to think for myself.
This veteran who is a former Trump supporter will definitely help you remove America's biggest mistake.
You act is if you liberals don’t do the same to Trump. Get off your high horse
Ok well if that’s pathetic, then it’s rather pathetic that you’re judging trump on his past🤷🏻‍♂️ you clearly have an opinion on his past personal life as you brought it up yourself. If Trump’s past life is subject to shaming than so is hers. You can’t have it both ways
WASHINGTON (AP) -- US to withdraw troops from Germany, sending 6,400 home and 5,400 to other countries, under shakeup sought by Trump.  Vlad’s puppet is DOING GREAT!

No accident. Trump is scared to death of competent people.
I wish all of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Trump defends Putin while attacking Dems, Dr Fauci and the media.
Dust off your fairy dust. It has blinded you! TRUMP 2020

Maybe it is time to have the discussion everyone is having about trump and Putin with the genius ACTUALLY IN THE ROOM. Force him to respond. bring towels
After Trump, no one could do much more than get the shit back to shoe level in 4 years. All we’re gonna get here is a return to status quo and protect any open supreme court seats. I don’t expect Biden to even want more than 1 term.
How much does it increase the value of Trump hotel?

When Trump has Russian guests he appears to be the happiest in pictures.
Fuck off, he’s guilty just like you, Trump and Putin.Its Angela Merkel that's giving Russia billions of dollars in gas and oil sales, while Trump tells her shes an idiot for doing so. Trump has given Ukraine lethal weapons to kill Russians. Trump is currently moving US Troops from Germany to the Poland/Ukraine border against Russia
Trump is the virus! 🦠
Trump murdered Hermain Cain for a rally. 150,000+ more were killed for less. Trump will let more than 1/4 of a million die before the end of August unless something radically changes.

Who the fuck would campaign for Trump?
If Trump had mandated masks at his Tulsa rally, Herman Cain would still be alive.
If you’ve had enough of Donald Trump’s chaos and corruption, here’s one way you can help end it.  Chip in ANY AMOUNT to attend the virtual grassroots fundraiser with  and  tomorrow and let’s sweep Donald Trump into the dustbin of history.
So self respecting woman votes for Trump.  Every mom I know is sick and tired of the dangerous and divisive DJT bullshit train and will be voting straight blue this year.    ...and I'll be looking forward to seeing #denialdonald removed forcefully on  inauguration day.
Heels up Harris. Fraud liar and cheat. Vote for Trump and Straight Republican in 2020.
What happened to Herman Cain was predicted.  Trump knew it would happen to a percentage of attendees.  That’s why he made them sign a liability waiver.  He was ok with it as long as he got to have his rally.  I can’t understand why both sides aren’t outraged.
Imbecil, that's why Trump did prison reform, because police, including elite FBI, bully people into taking a plea. They do it to minorities too often or any one who is their enemy. These agencies have too much power.
Sounds like Trump is trying to cheat by electronic voting and vote by mail blocks that.
It’s fairly clear that he chose to vilify the science behind mask use to please Trump. He put his faith in a charlatan rather than the true experts. That loyalty ultimately cost him his life.
Trump led Herman Cain to the gates of Hell.

The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump

So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you’re proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain’s death was a result of YOUR negligence.
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! 😎
I sense desperation in the air....your years as an enabler to Donald Trump are costing you.
Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today’s eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Obama’s eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
Thank you! He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally. He said (in caps): "people are fed up". He was a selfish pig. I save my sadness 4 the innocent pple who died because of them. The chickens have come home to roost! Ana is not rude just factual!
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
Or goes to jail... Cain was a big boy. He, along w/ Trump &amp; the rest of the goons, have caused many innocent people to die. He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally &amp; said that "people are fed up" (in caps). They deleted it today.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
Judging by my Twitter timeline, I think I may be the only one who is quite pleased that Trump didn’t go to John Lewis’ funeral.
WOW! what a service #JohnLewisMemorial . What I am curious to know is why Trump was not at the services? As a leader of this country he should have been there.
And Trump has the audacity to offer condolences to Mr. Cain's grieving family without taking responsibility for hosting a senseless rally during a global pandemic.
Makes you wonder what President Trump is actually up to doesn’t it? I trust
And nobody knew it until “Professor” Trump told us.
And trump doesn't care because he has no soul!
Chip in ANY AMOUNT to attend the virtual grassroots fundraiser with  and  on Friday and let’s sweep Donald Trump into the dustbin of history.
Are you also wondering how many regular, ordinary, non-public figures also died as a result of the ill-advised Trump Tulsa rally that killed Herman Cain?  There are certainly others.

This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
Did anyone put a clock on how long it took Mad King Trump to mention John Lewis after his death?
Given the way he's running his campaign, you have to wonder:  What does the President have on Donald J. Trump?
You have to keep in mind that Trump's biggest supporters are Nazis &amp; white supremacists.  These people love his racism.  He's one of them.  Has anyone ever checked his closet for his white hood &amp; robe?
BOOM!!!
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it
No. It’s really bad. Like Stephanie Meyers wrote 2020. Like trump is the emotional immature Edward and we are all Bella.
What I would expect on  tonight. Top story will be a live report from the NY pizza restaurant that trump tweeted out. In the 57th minute, there will be a snippet of video of Obama, Bush and Clinton speaking at John Lewis service
Even if delayed, Trump still leaves office at noon on January 20th, 2021. Absolutely nothing changes that.
Trump could never give a speech/eulogy because he can't talk about anyone but himself.  I love and miss Obama so much!!
Ask him if he knew this please National Debt Has Increased $5.2 Trillion During Trump's 3 Years as President
National Debt Has Increased $5.2 Trillion During Trump's 3 Years as President

No one cares about Mad King Trump and he's going to whine about that all over again the next chance he gets.  The spotlight needs to be on him every minute.
No one there wanted trump to say a damn thing.

Everyone is saying trump can’t postpone the November elections.  Trust me. He will find a way. He probably already has. Hence the tweet.  I myself find it scary at how very right about trump I’ve been.  He needs to be removed from office NOW. #RemoveTrumpNow
No offense, but he brought this on himself. Basically trump killed him along w/well over 150,000 other Americans. Or do the others not count? You never seem to mention them.
McLaughlin also believes that Trump asking for something that will never happen only makes him look “weak.”  “It is also a glaring statement of no-confidence in his own ability to compete in the election,” he writes.

Something is missing in Trump. Something essential to being human. Bush made some very bad decisions and listened to some people he shouldn't have. He is a much better ex president then he was a president.
For real? I didn’t know that... wow. Rudy... you should be ashatof yourself. Like trump loves to say “that is nasty”. Lmao. 🤮

It’s because those reporters were chosen to ask those questions. Anyone with balls enough to ask about putin bounties or trump’s epic failure on c19 might receive an angry tweet or lose access. Oh the horror.
Don’t you think he was tested before he was allowed so close to Trump? Herman Cain is tragedy but it’s about individual choices.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.

Too late, he sat by and did nothing while Trump betrayed his oath, our country and allies.
Remember over the spring many “primaries” got delayed/changed to accomodate the shut down. State govs may be inclined to change election dates/mail by dates in an effort to “accomodate” (ie: round up) voters.   Trump knows whatever he proposes Dems will be against. HydroxyC, etc.
That didn't age well.. I don't want to speak ill will of the dead but he was a grown man that chose to ride or die with this hoax and paid for it. he literally died for Trump.

I actually do get along with him. We just disagree on Trump. Thanks for your input, I feel like a much more fulfilled human being. Don't forget to inject bleach against COVID-19 and protect yourself at night from demon sex..
I don’t think there’s any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
You don't check your sources. Here’s the full statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association and AASA, the School Superintendents Association.
Don't believe this guy; he's as anti trump as they come. "Science" is trash when the analysis is designed to come out a certain way.  #hydroxichloroquine
save the USPS. Trump will defund until there is no mail at all.
Trump said that he could shoot somebody and they'd still support him. Well he didn't need a gun in this case.
Pogue is an anti-trump with 100s of anti-trump tweets, including disparaging tweets about Sarah Sanders.  Which means his "analysis" has ZERO credibility. He has a clear agenda.  #Hydroxychloroquine
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally where he likely contracted COVID. No mask. No social distancing.  Stupidly following Donald Trump in denial of the virus... #TrumpKillsAmerica
He said it.   The most RIGGED ELECTION ever. Mr. Putin. Can you hear me??  Donald J. Trump is the most DISGUSTING excuse for a human and those who still support him.
Press: “Next, do the Alphabet!” Trump: “There is something called an English alphabet. It’s a very very Patriotic, American Alphabet. Nobody’s seen anything like it before! In fact, I’m hearing China doesn’t even have ONE and we have like 3. 3 is small but not compared to 0.”
As terrible as that is, I'm still a bit more concerned with the prospect of dictator Trump than I am about the GNP.

Good thing Herman Caine knew the Lord and is in the presence of a Holy God. Herman was a grown man. Since he had cancer he knew the risk&amp; made his own mind. So don’t blame Trump.
Remember Republicans were the ones who fought against every election integrity bill! Follow their money to Diabold who makes the voting machines. It all comes together as to WHY they are so terrified with mail in voting.they need to cheat to win. FUCK TRUMP
Again, it’s trump saying something without doing something. Bark vs bite. Amazing people haven’t figured that out yet. Everyone calm down.
Trump can't pronounce basic words like plasma 🙄 "plausma" 🤦🏻‍♀️
No more than Trump is on his knees servicing your buddy Putin.
His briefing is nauseating.  I want to throw bricks at the tv for his utterly outrageous claims of voter fraud.  Suggestion:  Since according to him an "absentee ballot" is fine, everyone needs to request one so he'll shut up.

Trump does not deny that he wants to delay the election in November.
Trump bought the Miss America contest for access to young girls. And he’s clearly out of his mind.  And you’re a hypocrite and a fool.

Trump is such a child. President Bush gave a eulogy at John Lewis‘s funeral even though John Lewis didn’t go to Bush’s inauguration because of the Al Gore/BUSCH recount election. Trump didn’t even pay respects to Lewis when he was lying in state in the Capitol. Not presidential.

Bottom line: the N.R.A. laundered Russian money into the 2016 campaign and illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign. The N.R.A. needs to have its tax-exempt status stripped. Our documentary details all of this. But we need help to get the doc out.
Trump doesn’t care if more of his voters vote by mail. Trump doesn’t care if vote by mail is popular. The best opportunity Republicans have to suppress the vote is by reducing the number of urban voting sites where voters can vote. That’s the plan!
First of all, Pomeo’s smirk aside, he’s clearly not in in “the joke”, secondly, didn’t Trump tell us recently he “doesn’t kid”?
Analysis | Trump’s Four-Pinocchio interview on Russian bounties By Salvador Rizzo
Trump may not be eloquent by anyone’s standards, but he is a prodigious liar.

We didn’t deserve this type of health, economic, and political climate that Trump carelessly and recklessly led us to. If he is smart he’ll step down. I hear Roger Stone has room for another tattoo on his back.  Trump can end up as a tattoo on Stones back, if not it’ll be worse!
You honestly believe there is no possibility of voter fraud with millions of ballots floating around?   What if GOP wins, are you still going to take that position?  Is this exactly why Trump is making these statements? To take away Left arguments of “fraud” once he wins?  🤭🤔🧐
Trump should say that breathing air is good so the dems stop
Charlie, all Trump does is lie, and self-aggrandize, and talk like the fascist he is.
I have sleep issues, but they're more likely caused by my spending too much time on Twitter rather than worrying about the pandemic! 😳 🙄 And my addiction to Twitter is totally the result of following the resistance to Trump's disastrous administration. 😡

All of those points he Trump wants to but the Dems won’t let him
So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you’re proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain’s death was a result of YOUR negligence.
Republicans against Trump
Republican Voters against Trump. I believe she’s in Ohio.
History will remember Donald Trump in one way and one way only: as an accessory to the murder of tens of thousands of Americans. And amazing legacy
I don't think so loll trump is done
I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! 😎
I sense desperation in the air....your years as an enabler to Donald Trump are costing you.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Your right it’s just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.
Thank you! He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally. He said (in caps): "people are fed up". He was a selfish pig. I save my sadness 4 the innocent pple who died because of them. The chickens have come home to roost! Ana is not rude just factual!
. is a partisan hack. And a Trump-sucking sycophant. And an asshole.

Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
Or goes to jail... Cain was a big boy. He, along w/ Trump &amp; the rest of the goons, have caused many innocent people to die. He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally &amp; said that "people are fed up" (in caps). They deleted it today.

No joke, Trump is getting off on this - the moment he realized he could tweet praise for a different black guy who just died on the same day he planned on blowing off respect for John Lewis, I’m sure a big smug grin crossed his face and he dove for his phone.

RIP to #HermanCain who died from COVID after attending a Trump rally without a mask. Not intending this as a “gotcha” at all, but a plea to anti-maskers to maybe reconsider the whole mask thing.
See Trump is corrupt and hateful going against our Constitution! Protesters have legal rights they were not doing anything wrong but protesting against something the Trump Dictator didn’t agree with equal rights BLM👎🤥
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?

So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
Something is missing in Trump. Something essential to being human. Bush made some very bad decisions and listened to some people he shouldn't have. He is a much better ex president then he was a president.

Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.
Of course he is. Trump is going to undermine the results and declare himself the winner. Welcome to authoritarian rule! Democracy and the USA is finished.

If Trump calls Portland protesters a "beehive of terrorists" then what do we call his Cabinet???
I actually do get along with him. We just disagree on Trump. Thanks for your input, I feel like a much more fulfilled human being. Don't forget to inject bleach against COVID-19 and protect yourself at night from demon sex..
I don’t think there’s any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
Don't believe this guy; he's as anti trump as they come. "Science" is trash when the analysis is designed to come out a certain way.  #hydroxichloroquine
Trump said that he could shoot somebody and they'd still support him. Well he didn't need a gun in this case.
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
That reasoning never crossed Trump’s mind.
Pogue is an anti-trump with 100s of anti-trump tweets, including disparaging tweets about Sarah Sanders.  Which means his "analysis" has ZERO credibility. He has a clear agenda.  #Hydroxychloroquine
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally where he likely contracted COVID. No mask. No social distancing.  Stupidly following Donald Trump in denial of the virus... #TrumpKillsAmerica
He said it.   The most RIGGED ELECTION ever. Mr. Putin. Can you hear me??  Donald J. Trump is the most DISGUSTING excuse for a human and those who still support him.
Press: “Next, do the Alphabet!” Trump: “There is something called an English alphabet. It’s a very very Patriotic, American Alphabet. Nobody’s seen anything like it before! In fact, I’m hearing China doesn’t even have ONE and we have like 3. 3 is small but not compared to 0.”
Historian Michael Beschloss rips Trump for ‘deliberately undermining legitimacy of an American presidential election’ – Raw Story
Trump virus killed  Herman Cain
I will never know a more jarring experience than going from listening to Obama’s eloquent tribute to John Lewis to listening to Trump rambling nonsense of a press briefing...
Poor Rob has been trolled again by Trump.  Guess he thought he would spin you all up and as usual, you didn't disappoint.  Hilarious how easy you all are.
Only Trump and Barry can’t use the thread button.
I wonder how many lives would be saved if they just listened to Trump from the beginning and used #hcq
Good thing Herman Caine knew the Lord and is in the presence of a Holy God. Herman was a grown man. Since he had cancer he knew the risk&amp; made his own mind. So don’t blame Trump.
Remember Republicans were the ones who fought against every election integrity bill! Follow their money to Diabold who makes the voting machines. It all comes together as to WHY they are so terrified with mail in voting.they need to cheat to win. FUCK TRUMP
#SpecialReport Excellent press conference from President Trump!
Actually Trump is the embarrassment but it also shows you he’s running scared🤣🤣🤣
#SpecialReport Absolutely President Trump, open the schools!
Donny Trump is off the rails today.
When does Trump keep asking where are the ballots they're mailing gonna go...to the voters duh..he's an idiot
I said memorializing not memorizing. But the whatabout trump supporters don’t read
#TheFive Good idea President Trump, if school stays closed, send parents the money so they can send their kids, to an open school!
Didn't work. Obama is going to be on the news more than trump. Also, Bush and Clinton.
Psst.....Trump wanted to leave Syria
Trump is high and clueless as to what McConnell has not done. He sat on this bill since MAY
#TheFive Yes President Trump,  we need kids back in school!!!
...and plus Dems bill sat on McConnell's desk since MAY! Trump is high!
Trump tone has definitely changed with these press conference..he finally gets the economy wont get better if the virus stay around
I thought usually it took grabbing them by the .........to get him off.  #tRump
Let him try. Maybe It’ll keep him busy while the clock keeps ticking. Plus it’ll keep him distracted from future Trump distractions. And they’re coming.
It's the trump virus

Pompeo Says Barr Will Determine if Trump Can Delay Election
Trump knows he’s going to lose that’s why he wants to delay the election 🗳 and why he’s bashing mail in voting 🗳.
Trump again throwing meat to the media about this "delay the election" talk..what he tryna distract us from?
Donald Trump demonstrates zero leadership. Please do something about Russia placing a bounty on US soldiers. #PenceLies
You obviously haven’t seen how trump deals with this kind of thing. He will not acknowledge his death. If he does, he will blame it on protesters in ATL..
Trump’s ridiculous phone call with a Republican senator was recorded — and given to The New York Times – Raw Story
Rep. John Lewis was a great American and a great man. I don't see you mourning him. Herman Cain supported Donald Trump and look where it got him. Dead.
Mitch McConnell slaps down Donald Trump's demand to move the election over claims of 'mail-in fraud' as Republican leaders line up against call  via
Those comments are inappropriate &amp; totally unnecessary at this time. Whatever your opinions about Trump or political disagreements with him were, this is NOT the time to talk about him repenting before his tragic passing. God bless the Cain family, friends, etc...

Trump Takes A Victory Lap Over Alarm Sparked By His Push To Postpone Election Day
Looks like Trump thinks all voters in Florida and Michigan and other states are all Democrats. He appears to be shooting himself in the foot. Republicans vote by mail too...right.
that's the trump youth troops following hitler
Do you think they purposefully ignore actual degenerates so they can claim Trump’s base are horrible people overall and people will believe it?
Trump may not drink alcohol, but he's sipping at that #DemonSemen
Juan Williams saying Trump is a sore loser is amazing considering he’s 1-0 in elections so literally he has never lost.
have to second this...  i probably see 20 or 25 trump stickers/yard signs/etc for every biden one... but i hardly see any biden ones, if that makes sense...
Yesterday trump was trying to scare people from black and brown people who could possibly move into their neighborhoods and lower their house prices, today he wanted to postpone the election and this is your message?
I rarely, if ever, swear in public, Twitter or Facebook. But I find myself swearing at the TV when GOP goons like Gym Jordan, Doug Collins, Mnuchin, Nunes, and, of course, their Idiot-in-Chief Trump open their mouths. No one else makes my blood boil as much as they do. 😖 😡
#NobodyLikesMe WHY is Media continuing to air the gaslighting - I have been off all day your boycott is going to start       and remember all figures are lies- bff trump owns that company 😷😰😡‼️
#TheFive President Trump is the Master Troller!
Sorry, that makes no sense whatsoever. People die in pandemics, and b I'm sorry fur your loss. However, while Obama acted decisively to fight against H1N1, Trump has done the exact opposite. He has countered and maligned the very people he should have been listening to along.
Mad King Trump has finally latched onto an issue that his #MAGA base is sure to rally around: No election.
Trump is such a child. President Bush gave a eulogy at John Lewis‘s funeral even though John Lewis didn’t go to Bush’s inauguration because of the Al Gore/BUSCH recount election. Trump didn’t even pay respects to Lewis when he was lying in state in the Capitol. Not presidential.
What more does McConnell want out of trump, he could make trump resign tomorrow and run with pence and haley, but this is the party of trump...they are all trump now.
Well almost 4 years in , we know Donald J Trump is not an elected official ! he was placed in office by the Russians. #DonaldTrumpIsIllegitimate
Trump doesn’t care if more of his voters vote by mail. Trump doesn’t care if vote by mail is popular. The best opportunity Republicans have to suppress the vote is by reducing the number of urban voting sites where voters can vote. That’s the plan!
First of all, Pomeo’s smirk aside, he’s clearly not in in “the joke”, secondly, didn’t Trump tell us recently he “doesn’t kid”?
THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT DROPPED 32.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER. tRump doesn't want you to know this. That's why he floated the idea of delaying the election. DISTRACTION!! Whatever you do, DO NOT RETWEET THIS!
Busy watch PRESIDENT OBAMA. NO TIME 4 Trump’s BS. #TrumpIsALoser
You honestly believe there is no possibility of voter fraud with millions of ballots floating around?   What if GOP wins, are you still going to take that position?  Is this exactly why Trump is making these statements? To take away Left arguments of “fraud” once he wins?  🤭🤔🧐
I have sleep issues, but they're more likely caused by my spending too much time on Twitter rather than worrying about the pandemic! 😳 🙄 And my addiction to Twitter is totally the result of following the resistance to Trump's disastrous administration. 😡
, my pleasure. President Trump must be reelected!
Lewis showed nothing but contempt for President Trump, why should he bother?
So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you’re proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain’s death was a result of YOUR negligence.
Republicans against Trump
Republican Voters against Trump. I believe she’s in Ohio.
History will remember Donald Trump in one way and one way only: as an accessory to the murder of tens of thousands of Americans. And amazing legacy
I don't think so loll trump is done
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! 😎
I sense desperation in the air....your years as an enabler to Donald Trump are costing you.
Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today’s eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Your right it’s just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Obama’s eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
Thank you! He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally. He said (in caps): "people are fed up". He was a selfish pig. I save my sadness 4 the innocent pple who died because of them. The chickens have come home to roost! Ana is not rude just factual!
. is a partisan hack. And a Trump-sucking sycophant. And an asshole.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
Thanks to Trump and his corrupt leadership for our country going through this terrible epidemic Virus! All Trump cares about is his real estate and his selfish needs to be against the Medical professionals that we have to unite as a country to get this Virus out! Trump👎🤥
Why not flip flop it would extend your demise. If you support trump you’re a racist.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
Or goes to jail... Cain was a big boy. He, along w/ Trump &amp; the rest of the goons, have caused many innocent people to die. He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally &amp; said that "people are fed up" (in caps). They deleted it today.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
He needs flippers &amp; a Speedo!
Completely agree. But theres that filibuster rule, etc, plus each member of the senate would have to give a little speach abt why Trump is evil, etc.   Maybe they could do it faster. Obvi, it would be priority #1. Trump would be on lockdown!!  Lol
Have they heard Herman Cain just died because of trump virus??
Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
yo Brent I found your girl.
We must stop trump and his enablers.  Their incompetence has set our country back decades!
Very disappointing to have Trump I hope he is finally getting out and we can get our Country back to the people first!
DeSatan hitched his future to the wrong wagon.  He, the Tea Party faction of the GOP, and Trump are finished. Their ineptitude to govern, their refusal to listen to scientific experts have relegat3dmthem to history’s garbage heap.
Just got to wondering. Were there “White Voices for Trump”, or does Trump automatically speak for them? Also did any previous Presidents have Black/Latino Voices for them?
Never
WOW! what a service #JohnLewisMemorial . What I am curious to know is why Trump was not at the services? As a leader of this country he should have been there.
. we're coming for you. Each and every one of you. We will crawl over broken glass to vote. We will wear hazmat suits to vote. We will stand in line for 9 hours to vote. On Nov 3, we will annihilate the Trump Republican Party. We're taking back our country. GTF out of our way

Protesters have legal rights they were not doing anything wrong but protesting against something the Trump Dictator didn’t agree with equal rights BLM👎🤥Want to live in a free speech free life free country? Then vote TRUMP, VOTE REPUBLICAN all the way otherwise turn Socialist then somewhat communistic very shortly thereafter!!!
I want to know what Putin has on tRUmp and the rest of the GOP?
Naw! Now I'm disappointed in you  This is stooping to Trump's level of nastiness. You're more adult than this.
UNDENIABLY, Empirical Evidence is the bedrock of Irrefutable Fact and Trump has been a liar his entire adult life causing his track record to prove he simply can’t be trusted  SAFETY 1st💥 IT’S JUST TOO RISKY TO ALLOW TRUMP TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS &amp; WELL-BEING FOR FOUR MORE YEARS‼️
So instead of entertaining an idea as absurd as Trump unilaterally delaying an election, something which there is no mechanism for him to do, let’s instead worry about how we’re going to hold that election in the middle of a pandemic.
The question is not whether we will have an election on November 3rd. It’s whether or not Trump is able to sow enough chaos to squeak out a win. At best, what he’s doing now is just him trying to delegitimize Biden’s victory, not actually delay an election.
I know it can feel like Trump can do anything sometimes, but he can’t. He is repeatedly stopped in the courts, by congress, and by his own ineptitude. The only stuff he does get away with is stuff that involves Senate Republicans or his own cronies.
Then January 20th arrives. California held its elections so Pelosi is re-elected. Trump is constitutionally forced to leave. The Roberts court will deny any challenges because it’s CLEARLY SPELLED OUT. Pelosi is sworn in. Trump is kicked out by the secret service.
Most of the illegal shit Trump’s done has been confined to things the toadies in his own administration are willing to do. In order to delay the election WITHOUT congressional approval, he’s going to need to be able to simply declare “election’s off,” and...
Alright, genuine question: what mechanism is Trump going to use to delay the 2020 election?
TRUMP supporters are now saying Dems created this virus to make him look bad  and once he’s gone it will miraculously disappear!  Another great reason to vote Joe folks.
Interesting how Trump thinks we can’t have a safe election under Covid, but we can send our children back to school. #DumpTrump2020 #BlackLivesMatter #freeandfairelections

Yay, Fox and Limbaugh and friends!! Got you hooked on some major nonsense. China was “propagated”?? How has Trump dealt with Russia for 4 yrs?? The “pallets of cash” thing is pure propaganda. Isis, North Korea comments are just silly.
Your Trump interview was pathetic.
So, those people who voted for Trump because "He tells it like it is," how are you feeling about his tweets and speeches?
Trump has a schedule?
Please see specifically the method of counting, not validation.  Trump's dream is to suppress.  He has zero other recourse.  The media is trapping people.
You mean because Trump closed the border and stopped foreign flights while the left sat there and called him racist? Oh yeah.
Barr did not know that legally Trump cannot change the election date. Why didn't he know something so basic? Isn't he the AG?
And after all that Donald Trump was still able to kill him
Trump always plays right into Putin’s hands.
So many of us are on to Trump. He’s so transparent.
Trump, you are the biggest asshole to ever run this country.  Bitch be be gone.  You are the virus that effects us.
Trump Says-  I Think He's A Little OFF when he says "The Younger" are Immune or LESS at Risk to Contract the Corona Virus"  I Think Anyone Born Between 1960/65 to 1990/95 Developed A Tough Immune System based on Those Times they Lived In &amp; Things that They had to deal with!   ???
I almost forgot about those liability waivers Trump had people sign for his COVID rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
I could only listen to #Trump for a few minutes.  He is playing the victim role right now. He is experiencing severe #NarcissisticInjury.  He is depressed, paranoid and delusional.  In my opionion, this is dangerous. I am concerned about his state of mind and what he may do.
Completely unbelievable. A desperate Trump is a dangerous Trump and we're getting nowhere with this guy.
Keep in mind that Marv and Trump were often at odds over hotels and casinos.

Herman Cain died from the Trump Virus that he caught at the Trump Rally. How many more will you kill?
Trump shutting up is a plan I am down for!
As much as the GOP pretending there’s a shred of decency in Trump; can I just say when they pass around total lies about both Nancy &amp; Hillary I go 🥜?!
Even worse--he said "it would be an embarrassment to the US" when everyone knows that Trump is the GREATEST embarrassment to the US.
Jordan, Gohmert, Nunes, D. Collins, the Trump Spawn &amp; spouses, Mulvaney, HuckaSanders, MacaNinny, Gaetz, Crazy Rudy, Rubio, Scott, DeSantis, Cornyn, Kemp, Cruz and everyone sitting at the Trump Hotel &amp; Bar Breeding Ground.   They can all go to Maralago and stay there.
Now it's going to be a hurricane. We have one of the worst Corona Virus states, a dumb Trump Lacey governor, and now a hurricane!
Mr. Rather, traditions of Presidential behavior Trump violated were hard won and too easily lost.  He has permanently damaged the Union because under similar circumstances good men/women will fail to protect the Union.  Only Divine Providence can hold the Union together now.
That poor family is being used as Trump-props. He's not going to get to the bottom of anything. He is incompetent-- non compos mentis.
Well, Donald J Trump did get impeached because he was scared that Joe Biden would win the Presidency in 2020.🤣
Help me here. I don't understand the concept of Maga. Trump has been president for more than 3 years now. Does the slogan has to be something like keep America great ? If greatness has not be achieved in last 3+ years, how he will achieve in next 4 years. I am not mocking.

I feel no guilt in saying I have zero remorse for these people.  They encouraged millions to risk their lives to please Trump, and they led by example. Their deaths should serve as an example, too.  This is not a thing I would have said four years ago. Blame Trump &amp; his enablers.

I didn’t watch it because Barr is a liar.  Thanks for this. We know he is a white supremacist just like tRump !   💙💙💪🏼💪🏼
We need to end the debt ceiling, end government shutdowns, do more to bolster the Justice Department’s independence, abolish ICE, put new limits on executive power...  The GOP found so many ways to sabatoge Obama and enable Trump, and we can’t let that go on.
Looks like Dr Birx gave up trying to somehow educate Trump and is speaking truth to America. Late, but better than never. It will be interesting to see if Trump throws her under the same bus as he has thrown Fauci.
On one hand, Trump’s crimes are so many and so blatant, it’s hard to imagine them being ignored.  But I’ll bet it’s also awfully tempting to just do what they did with Bush, and just focus on the legislative agenda.  And even there we probably won’t do enough.
I am afraid Trump will try to use "emergency powers" to force a delay in the election. We must be prepared for that eventuality.
Pelosi and Reid let Bush skate because they thought impeachment would be an electoral loser. When Obama won, no effort was made to punish members of the Bush administration for 8 years of lies and gross incompetence.  Trump already forced Pelosi to impeach, but will they do more?
My biggest fear is Trump somehow pulling out a win in November.  My second biggest fear is Democrats not being willing to do enough to repair all the damage when they’re back in power.  I am a proud Democrat, but one thing I’ll never forget or forgive is how they dealt with Bush.
You support and encourage the monster Trump.
Unfortunately, we have consistently seen Trump stomping our laws and the Constitution.  Constant Impunity and refusing to follow subpoenas &amp; ignoring Supreme Court directives. Trump lawsuits have been his tactics for years. No service done minimizing danger from Trump &amp; Co.

Trump won’t go near his funeral. He would  not want to be associated with any reflection or reminder of his incompetence.  Next he’ll say, “ I hardly knew the guy”.
Holy shit!   He bragged about going to Tulsa for Trump’s rally and didn’t wear a mask.
I guess Pence can’t go to John Lewis funeral bc he’s a subservient toad ( and will be replaced on the ticket anyway as Trump only loyal to self)
This is sad. One line of thought is that he brought it on himself and endangered others. His, at best, naivete that led to his demise in a little over a month is still tragic. Responsible leadership from Donald Trump would go a long way to prevent unnecessary death
Herman Cain is dead from Covid-19. He attended the Tulsa rally with no mask. #Trump #BloodOnHisHands #TrumpVirusCatastrophe #HermanCain #TulsaRally
Want to live in a free speech free life free country? Then vote TRUMP, VOTE REPUBLICAN all the way otherwise turn Socialist then somewhat communistic very shortly thereafter!!! Just you watch and I don’t get paid for this either
Before people freak out:  No, Trump can’t actually delay the election. Only an act of congress can.  He floats dumb shit like this literally all the time cuz he has the impulse control of a toddler.  He constitutionally HAS to leave office on January 20 without an election.
Let’s stop talking about Trump wanting to delay the election. He knows he can’t. We know he can’t.  He’s just trying to distract from the terrible economic numbers that came out today and the death count from the virus.,
Donald J Trump is trying to distract from the US GDP loss of 32.9%. He knows that he doesn't have the authority to change the date of the general election.
This is one of your crowning achievements. Like the 1,000’s of deaths, infrastructure, Trump Care and a 33% drop in our GDP.
Lies after lies do not change facts..such that the virus began in China but was distributed by trump. I t is the trump virus and is unabated
Why is Trump tied to Putin? Two reasons: Money and Father Figure...with Trump, it's always about money; and he misses his father.

Something broke in 2016 when Trump was elected president.
President Trump floats delaying the presidential election, citing his own prediction of fraudulent voting
Forget tweets, Covid, economy and sarcasm and see what happens if he’s not re-elected. What is it that the Democrats plan for our future? Look deeper than day to day. What is it Trump has been holding back?
Trump Trying to stop Nov election  Trump does not have the power himself to move the date of the election, which was set by an 1845 federal law placing it the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November The date could move theoretically with action by Congress.
Now this is Hilarious!! Trump is afraid ... he’s time is up now because  he fail all Americans with his bad decisions on this pandemic. Pack your stuff Trump. Game over !

An NPR investigation has found irregularities in the process by which the Trump administration awarded a multi-million dollar contract to a Pittsburgh company to collect key data about Covid-19 from the country's hospitals in the midst of pandemic. Suspicious connections.
Donald Trump thinks that the Emergency Powers Act of 1976 gave him the power to postpone the election. He is right. The Emergency Powers Act of 1976 created the imperial presidency. We lost this battle 44 years ago. We are standing on the edge of the precipice.There will be blood
I'm sure the Republican controlled Senate would back Donald J Trump.
If the trumps don’t leave the building ... the transition will still go on ... they won’t be in charge  ... and will have put the trump brand beyond redemption ... and they will forever be untouchables for what they have done to America  ... perhaps that is the final comeuppance
Great idea from The Greatest President we have Ever had been Blessed to have! 12 more years! Our forever President! Love you President Trump!
The only one who is a great embarrassment to the USA is Trump.
All they have to do is reverse the $3 Trillion tax cut they gave the rich 2 years ago. Why doesn’t some Democratic suggest that, I want to hear the GOP scream and yell how unfair it is. Trump created the problem we have today with the tax cut.
If he doesn’t leave the building ... he won’t have the the levers of gov ... and will have put the trump brand beyond redemption
We thought there was no legal way Trump could do many of the things he has already done.
Impeachment takes too long.   Just invoke the 25th Amendment and get it over with. Trump will eventually end up in prison or a mental hospital anyhow.
President Trump for life. #Maga forever

Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election
When will Mika and Joe learn that Trump doesn’t care about what the Constitution says. Trump doesn’t believe in the Constitution or our Democracy.
I tweeted a few days that Trump may try to delay the election. When will the GOP. stand up to Trump and say enough is enough and fight for our Constitution and Democracy.
These “laws, judgements” mean nothing to tRUMP.
You can also drop the ballot off in person locally at various election and tax offices if we cannot trust Donald Trump's Postmaster General crony to obey federal law.
Ex-presidents at Lewis funeral today.   Obama giving eulogy.   Expect Trump to jump up and down waving hands around for attention.🤡

No medical license on her. Sounds like she is not all there mentally. like Trump. Just a distraction, so Trump &amp; Co. Can manipulate the US pandemic to further raid US coffers for personal profit. DOJ Barr &amp; family also.
What he really wants is to NOT have a commercial property built on the site of the FBI building that would be competition for his DC hotel.   Trump always has an ulterior motive related to money.
Bless President Trump and Bless America

The American people president Trump stop trying to cover up for your brother. We know because of him many more people died ..
Trump's reasons, will be made public some day. That's why the Criminal In Chief, is fighting so hard.Not to have his accounting firms,or business tax documents released. Then you will see decades, of money laundering, insurance fraud,&amp;filing false tax returns.Russian backed loans
We can all disagree. But Trump and masks does make us divided. You must avoid people without masks. And you should avoid Trump

Donald Trump retweeted and endorsed a small group of doctors, one of which believes that COVID 19 happens when you sleep with Satan.  Do you think Lucifer is the reason I wake up every morning with a sore throat and an itchy ass?
There are 8 other planets in our solar system where the words "donald trump" will mean absolutely nothing.
I suggest every time this dimwit, President Demon Sperm, says China virus; we scream Trump Virus.
Maybe cause deep down they know they were wrong about tRUmp, but just can't admit it!
When are you going to step in and remove the mask mandate?? We know masks don’t work and this whole thing has been a scam. Seriously questioning whether to vote for you again. Need someone like a Trump with balls.

So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
Something is missing in Trump. Something essential to being human. Bush made some very bad decisions and listened to some people he shouldn't have. He is a much better ex president then he was a president.
For real? I didn’t know that... wow. Rudy... you should be ashatof yourself. Like trump loves to say “that is nasty”. Lmao. 🤮
I have no words for thes four other than Trump ass kissers!
He’s the head of the Federalist society and just now says that trump is a fascist?  Wait. Haven’t we known that for three years?  The tweet this more all of a sudden turned him. Pfft.
Lost the most American lives in recent history. No that was Trump. Worst Stock Market crash in recent history. Trump. Worst GDP contraction, ever. Trump again, Joe.
Nice try, but you’re an enabler of Trump. You’ve do it for 3.5 years....Vote!!!
Since when anybody ORDERS TRUMP anything ??😂😂
I see ! Maybe because he did not recognize President Trump ???🤡

Remember this article.
Pllllease, do some research before voting trump and subjecting the American people to this “person” again. There’s so much information out there that proves he does not care about doing the right thing, or you, or anyone but himself, power and money
Trump needs to give this little fuckrunt the heave ho..
Fox News is NOT news - Pllllease, do some research before voting trump and subjecting the American people to this “person” again. There’s so much information out there that proves he does not care about doing the right thing, or you, or anyone but himself, power and money
Trump is actually already doing it Mr. **** QAnon
LMBO  "Twitter isn't enough space to change minds, I just troll 45." We all have that fam member. Mine is 2K miles away. No 1 ever spoke w/him anyway. The poem on the Statue Of Liberty reads: give me your tired, your poor, etc Trump says: What the heck, give me your deplorables!
Press: “Next, do the Alphabet!” Trump: “There is something called an English alphabet. It’s a very very Patriotic, American Alphabet. Nobody’s seen anything like it before! In fact, I’m hearing China doesn’t even have ONE and we have like 3. 3 is small, but not compared to 0.”
When a toddler done get his way.  They will say anything until they get there way.  We should  all vote by mail.  It's safe and easier for everyone.   I forgot Russia and hack into mail in voting.  Wondering if thats why Trump want to stop it.
Who the fuck would campaign for Trump?
It’s crazy ironic... #Trump has been obsessing about a wall on the #Mexico border forever (ya know, to keep “them” out).  Now, due to the way the #Trump admin has handled #covid19... Mexico is literally one of the only countries in the world allowing Americans to visit!!

Heels up Harris. Fraud liar and cheat. Vote for Trump and Straight Republican in 2020.
The one that pisses me off the worst is Trump 2020...no more bullshit.  As if the last 3 1/2 years have been anything but!

Why Trump Might Quit  via    I used to think the same thing but now Im convinced that  will dump Pence for Nikki Haley to show he too can have a female running mate
Demand every last BLM protestor, rioter, anarchist, ANTIFA, white, black, brown, red, Covid +, immigrant, DACA, millennial, gay, lesbian, trans, suburban housewife.. whovever. Get out and vote!!! If not, let Trump bash their heads in for the next four years. They asked for it!!!
It’s because those reporters were chosen to ask those questions. Anyone with balls enough to ask about putin bounties or trump’s epic failure on c19 might receive an angry tweet or lose access. Oh the horror.
Don’t you think he was tested before he was allowed so close to Trump? Herman Cain is tragedy but it’s about individual choices.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.
Of course he is. Trump is going to undermine the results and declare himself the winner. Welcome to authoritarian rule! Democracy and the USA is finished.
This is why Donald Trump is president. Racists like this.
Well at least it’ll backfire on trump. His approval was low during the government shutdown.
Absolutely correct, Governor DeSantis sits at the knee of Trump, both must be voted out
Trump does not care about Americans period he’s a socio pathic career narcissist and we don’t need Mary trumps book to tell us that. He’s a career liar .
Trump’s comments on rescheduling the elections convinces me further that he won’t accept the election results if he loses.
Our idiot Governor DeathSantis is listening to his master Trump. He's a darn mini Trump. He's going to get voted out.
Trump’s voter fraud and mail in voting tweets have no evidence. He is supplying false information.
No. I didn't get to make my point. Would you mind listing the things Trump has done if it's convenient?
Chump change compared to the Trumps.

Y’all gonna vote for trump yet claim you care about child trafficking?!??? WHAT
Too late, he sat by and did nothing while Trump betrayed his oath, our country and allies.
Remember over the spring many “primaries” got delayed/changed to accomodate the shut down. State govs may be inclined to change election dates/mail by dates in an effort to “accomodate” (ie: round up) voters.   Trump knows whatever he proposes Dems will be against. HydroxyC, etc.
That didn't age well.. I don't want to speak ill will of the dead but he was a grown man that chose to ride or die with this hoax and paid for it. he literally died for Trump.
Trump's admiration of dictators probably getting lessons on how to take a democracy to a authoritarian dictatorship using our own judiciary and laws against us.
I believe Trump is responsible for all the COVID deaths
Dana Perino! Wasn't she the press secretary  for Bush? That was the worst administration in history...I mean until the Trump administration
The covid response was a total disaster for Trump. Instead of asserting himself as a strong leader who didn’t prescribe to the mob mentally he went along with the narrative from the shutdown imbeciles and lunatics. If anything is going to be his undoing it will be this.

If Trump calls Portland protesters a "beehive of terrorists" then what do we call his Cabinet???
I actually do get along with him. We just disagree on Trump. Thanks for your input, I feel like a much more fulfilled human being. Don't forget to inject bleach against COVID-19 and protect yourself at night from demon sex..
I don’t think there’s any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
Don't believe this guy; he's as anti trump as they come. "Science" is trash when the analysis is designed to come out a certain way.  #hydroxichloroquine
save the USPS. Trump will defund until there is no mail at all.
Trump said that he could shoot somebody and they'd still support him. Well he didn't need a gun in this case.
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
That reasoning never crossed Trump’s mind.
trump is the only person I hate
Pogue is an anti-trump with 100s of anti-trump tweets, including disparaging tweets about Sarah Sanders.  Which means his "analysis" has ZERO credibility. He has a clear agenda.  #Hydroxychloroquine

Looks like Trump thinks all voters in Florida and Michigan and other states are all Democrats. He appears to be shooting himself in the foot. Republicans vote by mail too...right.

Do you think they purposefully ignore actual degenerates so they can claim Trump’s base are horrible people overall and people will believe it?
Trump may not drink alcohol, but he's sipping at that #DemonSemen
Juan Williams saying Trump is a sore loser is amazing considering he’s 1-0 in elections so literally he has never lost.
have to second this...  i probably see 20 or 25 trump stickers/yard signs/etc for every biden one... but i hardly see any biden ones, if that makes sense...
Yesterday trump was trying to scare people from black and brown people who could possibly move into their neighborhoods and lower their house prices, today he wanted to postpone the election and this is your message?
I rarely, if ever, swear in public, Twitter or Facebook. But I find myself swearing at the TV when GOP goons like Gym Jordan, Doug Collins, Mnuchin, Nunes, and, of course, their Idiot-in-Chief Trump open their mouths. No one else makes my blood boil as much as they do. 😖 😡

Sorry, that makes no sense whatsoever. People die in pandemics, and b I'm sorry fur your loss. However, while Obama acted decisively to fight against H1N1, Trump has done the exact opposite. He has countered and maligned the very people he should have been listening to along.
One of my followers made a good point.  Trump was impeached, doesn’t that make it illegal to be re-elected?  Even if only the House impeached him it still stands. HE SHOULD NOT BE ON THE BALLO

Trump is such a child. President Bush gave a eulogy at John Lewis‘s funeral even though John Lewis didn’t go to Bush’s inauguration because of the Al Gore/BUSCH recount election. Trump didn’t even pay respects to Lewis when he was lying in state in the Capitol. Not presidential.
What more does McConnell want out of trump, he could make trump resign tomorrow and run with pence and haley, but this is the party of trump...they are all trump now.
Well almost 4 years in , we know Donald J Trump is not an elected official ! he was placed in office by the Russians. #DonaldTrumpIsIllegitimate
Trump doesn’t care if more of his voters vote by mail. Trump doesn’t care if vote by mail is popular. The best opportunity Republicans have to suppress the vote is by reducing the number of urban voting sites where voters can vote. That’s the plan!
First of all, Pomeo’s smirk aside, he’s clearly not in in “the joke”, secondly, didn’t Trump tell us recently he “doesn’t kid”?
THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT DROPPED 32.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER. tRump doesn't want you to know this. That's why he floated the idea of delaying the election. DISTRACTION!! Whatever you do, DO NOT RETWEET THIS!
Busy watch PRESIDENT OBAMA. NO TIME 4 Trump’s BS. #TrumpIsALoser
You honestly believe there is no possibility of voter fraud with millions of ballots floating around?   What if GOP wins, are you still going to take that position?  Is this exactly why Trump is making these statements? To take away Left arguments of “fraud” once he wins?  🤭🤔🧐
Trump should say that breathing air is good so the dems stop
I have sleep issues, but they're more likely caused by my spending too much time on Twitter rather than worrying about the pandemic! 😳 🙄 And my addiction to Twitter is totally the result of following the resistance to Trump's disastrous administration. 😡
, my pleasure. President Trump must be reelected!
All of those points he Trump wants to but the Dems won’t let him
Lewis showed nothing but contempt for President Trump, why should he bother?
So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you’re proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain’s death was a result of YOUR negligence.
Republicans against Trump
Republican Voters against Trump. I believe she’s in Ohio.
History will remember Donald Trump in one way and one way only: as an accessory to the murder of tens of thousands of Americans. And amazing legacy
I don't think so loll trump is done
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! 😎
I sense desperation in the air....your years as an enabler to Donald Trump are costing you.
Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today’s eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Your right it’s just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Obama’s eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
Thank you! He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally. He said (in caps): "people are fed up". He was a selfish pig. I save my sadness 4 the innocent pple who died because of them. The chickens have come home to roost! Ana is not rude just factual!
. is a partisan hack. And a Trump-sucking sycophant. And an asshole.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
Thanks to Trump and his corrupt leadership for our country going through this terrible epidemic Virus! All Trump cares about is his real estate and his selfish needs to be against the Medical professionals that we have to unite as a country to get this Virus out! Trump👎🤥
Why not flip flop it would extend your demise. If you support trump you’re a racist.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
Or goes to jail... Cain was a big boy. He, along w/ Trump &amp; the rest of the goons, have caused many innocent people to die. He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally &amp; said that "people are fed up" (in caps). They deleted it today.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
He needs flippers &amp; a Speedo!
Completely agree. But theres that filibuster rule, etc, plus each member of the senate would have to give a little speach abt why Trump is evil, etc.   Maybe they could do it faster. Obvi, it would be priority #1. Trump would be on lockdown!!  Lol
Have they heard Herman Cain just died because of trump virus??
Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
yo Brent I found your girl.
We must stop trump and his enablers.  Their incompetence has set our country back decades!
Very disappointing to have Trump I hope he is finally getting out and we can get our Country back to the people first!
DeSatan hitched his future to the wrong wagon.  He, the Tea Party faction of the GOP, and Trump are finished. Their ineptitude to govern, their refusal to listen to scientific experts have relegat3dmthem to history’s garbage heap.
Just got to wondering. Were there “White Voices for Trump”, or does Trump automatically speak for them? Also did any previous Presidents have Black/Latino Voices for them?
Never
Biden will almost certainly win Maine by double digits. U think there will be a lot of Collins/Biden voters? I’m more skeptical considering how much Collins is tied to trump.
WOW! what a service #JohnLewisMemorial . What I am curious to know is why Trump was not at the services? As a leader of this country he should have been there.
. we're coming for you. Each and every one of you. We will crawl over broken glass to vote. We will wear hazmat suits to vote. We will stand in line for 9 hours to vote. On Nov 3, we will annihilate the Trump Republican Party. We're taking back our country. GTF out of our way

See Trump is corrupt and hateful going against our Constitution! Protesters have legal rights they were not doing anything wrong but protesting against something the Trump Dictator didn’t agree with equal rights BLM👎🤥
Clown 🤡 😂😂😂Trump Drive nuts 😂😂😂😂😂
trump has no friends only uses people, name one true friend he has?
And Trump has the audacity to offer condolences to Mr. Cain's grieving family without taking responsibility for hosting a senseless rally during a global pandemic.
is he saluting Hitler or Trump
Makes you wonder what President Trump is actually up to doesn’t it? I trust
And nobody knew it until “Professor” Trump told us.
And trump doesn't care because he has no soul!
He’s a fraud plain and simple.....Can’t believe Trump keeps him
How the hell does Trump keep this fraud?..very discouraging
Trump and GOP running up $3.7 trillion deficit this year.
TRUMP HAS NO AUTHORITY TO MOVE THE DATE OF THE ELECTION. HIS GORDY DECORATIONS AND HIS BELONGINGS WILL BE OUT OF THE PEOPLES HOUSE BY 11:30 ON JANUARY 20TH. I HEARD PUTIN ORDERED A PLANE TO PICK HIS UGLY SHIT UP. HE CAN DECORATE THE KREMLIN WITH HIS UGLY BULLSHIT FUCK HIM &amp; PUTIN
Today Trump suggested delaying the election. Obama was reinforcing John Lewis' belief "When you see something that is not right, you must do something," "Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part."
And Trump voters are conservative, so what does that make him? Your claim was specious and an attempt to discredit the original point, which is that by and large Republicans and far right groups are the biggest pushers re: reopening/masks are ineffective/covid conspiracies.
I highly doubt that! This right here is what the Democratic Party has become. Vote them all out!  🇱🇷TRUMP 2020🇱🇷
Them they criticize Trump at Rose Garden
Trump is more afraid of early voting 🗳 then the actually Election Day🤔 but want worried about it in 2016 🤷🏾‍♀️
The more people who get sick, the more of an excuse Trump and Barr will have to try and postpone or suspend the election. Remember, has no bottom and will do anything to win. Cynical? Perhaps...
No Trump is
"I wish her well, frankly."  Here’s Every Time Donald Trump And Ghislaine Maxwell Have Been Photographed Together
He died because of the Trump virus!!
As a Trump supporter how can you defend making voting harder.  You can want your guy to win, but ar what cost?!  What country do you live in if it totally ignores the value of voting?!
What bothrs me is this, like everythig else Trump does, lying, cheatg, ppl he appointd all do whatevr he says evn if it sounds like it shd be against the law.  I don't undrstand how he can get away with all this garbage, including bringing other countries into our elections
Biden down only 2 in a GOP poll in a district trump win by 17!
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally. No mask. No social distancing. Likely contracted COVID because he stupidly follow Donald Trump. #TrumpKilledHermanCain #TrumpKillsUS
Here's when it will really be fun: When an intrepid reporter asks Mad King Trump, "So, what did you think of President Obama's remarks at John Lewis' funeral?"
Thank you, Obama!! Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, takes aim at Trump over voting rights, protest response
Rest in peace Herman Cain. Hopefully others will learn from your misplaces trust in Trump.
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally. No mask. No social distancing. Very likely contracted COVID by foolishly following you...Blood on your hand!!!
U act like Biden hasn’t said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
C’mon let’s be fair Trump knows 6 words : Person,Woman,Man,Camera,Tv and Bigly. In Trump’s world Bigly counts.
Did anyone put a clock on how long it took Mad King Trump to mention John Lewis after his death?
Donald Trump.
Right, because when Lewis boycotted BOTH Bush's and Trump's inaugurationa he was working to bring people together?
You have to keep in mind that Trump's biggest supporters are Nazis &amp; white supremacists.  These people love his racism.  He's one of them.  Has anyone ever checked his closet for his white hood &amp; robe?
No it’s in the constitution that both houses must approve it first.  The spanish flu was worse more deaths it didn’t get postponed. Trump definitely cannot do it.
BOOM!!!
No, Trump is a national disgrace. Trump has done nothing about Russia placing a bounty on US soldiers.... #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsANationalSecurityThreat
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it
No. It’s really bad. Like Stephanie Meyers wrote 2020. Like trump is the emotional immature Edward and we are all Bella.
What I would expect on  tonight. Top story will be a live report from the NY pizza restaurant that trump tweeted out. In the 57th minute, there will be a snippet of video of Obama, Bush and Clinton speaking at John Lewis service
Under Trump and the GOP the federal deficit is $3.7 trillion. #GOPhypocrites
I believe it is a fact Trump is trying to undermine the election.
What do you call it when Trump suggests delaying the election? Fascism!!!
Obama makes Trump look like a damn fool.
Ask him if he knew this please National Debt Has Increased $5.2 Trillion During Trump's 3 Years as President
National Debt Has Increased $5.2 Trillion During Trump's 3 Years as President
Parts of President Obama's John Lewis eulogy will be played on a loop.  Mad King Trump's going to go berserk.
No one cares about Mad King Trump and he's going to whine about that all over again the next chance he gets.  The spotlight needs to be on him every minute.
No one there wanted trump to say a damn thing.
Donald Trump will NEVER upstage President Barack Hussein Obama!
I saw Barack Obama‘s eulogy for John Lewis and felt pride. I listen to President Trump every day and feel shame. What have we become?
Trump is quite literally killing his supporters. #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsACompleteFailureChris Hayes didn't understand the importance of the last election. He thought Trump was to the left of Hillary.
I wonder what Trump got to say about the NBA...
If I'm not mistaken, we are currently in Trump's America and the current unemployment numbers expose your tweet as a lie.
BrooklynDad  is SO on POINT!!!  The mail...is the key....so simple but so easy to be manipulated...so some tRump/Putin operative dumps 100 fake ballots in some PO box..who knows??? in every county...every state...it all adds up.
For Trump supporters, next time you get in a 'discussion' with a libtards about the good works of ANTIFA, just ask them about Andrew Duncomb, a Black, Conservative Journalist who was stabbed in the back by a 7" knife wielded by a well known ANTIFA member in Portland last weekend.
What we need to watch for is tRump stuffing the ballots with "random" bogus ballots...fake ballots for tRump and Biden....enough that the election can be declared invalid for both parties. tRump wants chaos, he declares martial law to "make sure the next election is fair + just"
Crazy! Not natural.🤪
But Trump told us that ISIS had been defeated. LOL!

Who was it who has yet to accept the results of the 2016. I certainly don't think it is President Trump, eh?
This reveals the tension or contradiction in the "patriot" movement. Trump wields the instrument of tyranny, iaw their ideology. Trump vs liberty.
2/ as he was sitting in front of his office in a rocking chair. You see, he was a fervent supporter of President Trump. His sin &amp; the 'crime' he was 'executed' for by some punk was that he was a Black American. So where is THE Reverend Al Sharpton, BLM (who he supported)? Where?
Ok, have it your way, Trump is going to lose big league.
Trump talks about it so much, if he’s involved I don’t trust him to not corrupt the process. His desperation is going to encourage him to try everything and anything to stay in the whitehouse. How are we even in this predicament?
The most hypocritical irony involved in this issue is to hear Demtards scream and cry about Trump not accepting the election results this coming November. Let me ask this simple question. When has Crooked Hillary accepted the election? Yeah, just what I thought. She hasn't.
If Florida’s faithless EC turncoats Vote for Trump again, they best hope no one finds out who they are and where they live! Might be they’ll have some’xplain in 2do! Wouldn’t want 2B in their shoes!
I love my President Trump!
Fuck Trump.

Herman Cain was a great American. I pray for his family. I also hope Trump is invited to speak at his furneral.
Trump is scared witless. Even the evangelicals are distancing themselves.
Why do you support Trump?
Don't have any respect for a man who deliberately led the effort to Not attend President Trump's inauguration. If the shoe was on the other foot they would be calling Him Racist.  Herman Cain was a hardworking Pizza delivery man, and then worked to become manager. Then CEO! Hero!
ABSOLUTELY! Wouldn't you love to see what we could accomplish with Trump if we didn't have idiot commies fighting our every move??
Doesn’t matter, Trump and Biden are basically the same person. Would be nice not to have to hear about Trump’s tweets all the time.
Facts are easy to believe, Trump supporters are abandoning him in droves.
I see you are trying to divert attention to something other than Trump’s incompetence and impending meltdown.
I am not a Trump supporter anymore but I have a mail-in ballot story to tell. I called my Supervisor Of Elections office to see where my mail in ballot was. They sent it over 14 days ago. I didn’t get it and neither did my daughter. They are sending two more. What’s up with this?
Hey people, Trump just realized the virus is coming back really, really "badly". 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡🤣💩
Really, because communist China party attacked us with this virus on the American people. Not Trump. Get your facts right!!
Trump Launches New Racist Dog Whistle To Attract Suburban Voters
"Trump beat the Deep State". Qluless.
I thought Trump supported equality? 🤡
There's no evidence of that. Biden doesn't carry the baggage of Clinton. There's no evidence Trump has expanded his base at all. The polls in the states Trump won by ~ 1% or less, which is why he won, are polling much stronger for Biden than they were in 2016 for Clinton.
Republicans Think Covid Numbers Are “Being Cooked” To Hurt Trump

If votes mattered Trump wouldn't be president. Polls track the popular vote, and they were well within the MoE in 2016. We'll see what happens in the next few months.
Elected officials are a manifestation of its citizenry.   We’ve got quite a bit of time before elections, so much more to come. Minority (MSM) projects itself as the majority.   11/3 won’t even be close. Trump will get 61-63%

Because he is trump right had man white supremacy rules in there world remember he doesn’t like to monkey things up well buddy you dropped the damn ball this time idiot
Trump can do whatever he wants. He is the damn President of The United States. You so called Demorats have tried so hard to impeach him and continuously fail. It is so comical to watch. What you idiots don’t understand is he has God on his side. God always wins!!
. –  Our dear friend Herman Cain has passed away…WA Gov bans weddings, funerals, gyms, &amp; bars (but not “peaceful protests”)…President Trump asks those who have recovered from COVID to donate plasma. TODAY

Trump hiding from twitter while the John Lewis funeral is going is such a loud message of racism!
I haven’t voted for a Republican since Bush.  Can you say the same. Because as I see it, Trump is about to have the same numbers of deaths in this country of our citizens as Bush.

That is amazing. Obama told you to get used to a low GDP that the jobs were not coming back here. More people were on welfare during Obama than anytime in history. But you believe whatever you want to believe. He had 8 years to fix it Trump did it in two. He WILL do it again.
Thank goodness President Trump had our economy on so high a plateau so we would have some 'cushion' to fall on. Imagine if we were starting at the economy Obama left us with?
Soon after, the #GOP will go into crisis mode and claim “well if he did delay the #Election2020 date, we would be ok with that”.  People will be appalled by all this.  #SusanCollins will be “concerned”.  Nothing will come of it until #Trump is removed from office.  #WeWillVote
About 1-2 weeks from now WAPO or the NYT will break a story that confirms #Trump was not kidding, and literally asked about delaying the #Election2020 date in some cabinet meeting.  Anonymous WH sources will be reported as “shocked” Trump said this.
“The people who voted for Trump aren’t going anywhere. They are the Republican party.”  Not exactly.  Many are going to die soon because they are disproportionately older (also Coronavirus a la Herman Cain)

Trump hardly 'ignores' science but does place personal choice on par with the so-called science. Especially since the 'scientists' keep changing their minds on what people should wear and do. They were handing out masks for people to use but didn't force them on attendees.
2/ As such he often puts out 'floaters' which astounds you poll tested blabbermouths. Trump is right to question what effect illegal voting will have in this election since Dems are pulling out all the stops for the use of 'mail-in ballots', a clear path for voter fraud.
Hey Chris, just how many times do you think you can repeat the word 'weakness' in your usual verbal animus you bloviate against President Trump? Since you obviously either don't know or have forgotten, President Trump is our first Transactional Populist President.

Everything you listed is on Democrats. Trump didn't order sick patients into nursing homes to kill off 60k elderly. Your Dem Governors did that. Trump didn't lock down the country your Dem Governors did that. But let's forget about facts shall we.
Yes we are all a bunch of racists. Just because we hate seeing what's happening in the black communities and want to help it. I guess you are ok with children being shot every weekend. Just because you call Trump a racist doesn't make him one. It is Dem propaganda.

Excuse me, Trump thugs. It doesn't work like that.  #portland #protests #gestapo #fascism

Still defending trump. How’s that going for you?!?
I honestly don't think he will stay through Trump's second presidency.  Once the #ObamaGate indictments are well under way and gone to trial, he'll probably resign.  That work for you?
So you have been following the Durham probe, and Obama Gate. Did you know him, Biden, and his DOJ spied on President Trump? Oh about that. The Obama Crime Fanily is correct.
Again you're a typical low educated Democrat. You see, and Hear what you want. When challenged you can't Debate. Please don't ever say President Trump lies when you clearky tell Many. A hypocrite to the core.
I'm not gonna lie I figure one of them is gonna have to be martyred to the virus before ANY of them change. I wouldn't cry if it were Barr. Trump would.
Wrong again. Read President Trump words. Not your interpretation of it. Again the CNN version. He clearly stated at the rally The hoax was what's going on. The politicizing of the Virus. Not the Virus. You won't look it up. There's no difference.
Covid is Not a worry for the US. That's what the so called experts said.  Bro you hate Trump we get it. Think rationally.  Even for a minute.
How is the President Responsible for the dead? Is Obama Biden Responsible for H1 N1? Even with a vaccine 1000's die. Maybe we should Still hold them accountable? President Trump closed flights to China in Jan. Dems were briefed before that. Who, China, Fauchi said No worries.
Because the police unions spin the same narratives as the Trump administration.Thanks! Trump appreciates my expertise as well. With my tutelage he should be able to get Covid deaths back to zero, as he promised last spring.
The sickness and the problem. Why is trump connectted to this demon?
Good luck. My heart is with you. My mistrust is a concern  I heard a huge trump compliment. He is speeding up va cases .settling  them at warp speed . Kudo  lose fauchi.he is worse then bidin. Vets Trump fixed the va compensation!God blessDJ T

I  trump back in March and that seemed to have got me right, try that! 😂
They were headed in that direction when Donald “Mr. Bone Spurs” Trump dissed McCain for being captured, thus disqualifying McCain as a genuine hero in his twisted mind.
All the stuff we are hearing about those voting by mail n the mail delayed due to tRump must be true.  Or his plans to prolong in order to finish the cheat scheme. I dont trust him at all. Lies too much n acts the definition of spoiled rich n racist.
Obama gets zero blame and all the credit. Trump just gets the blame. Like all this shit wasn’t going on way before him. But yeah his 3 years in have cause all this “systematic racism”.
This is what will cause us to lose in November: Biden didn’t offer enough...etc  You don’t realize: do ANYTHING necessary to beat Trump! Including the retweet - which costs you nothing. Except your purity.
I do. Trump doesn’t make a move without my approval. I have been his advisor on handling the Covid epidemic since January. Things are going great!
It was the logical end. The kid represented the “old” GOP that Lincoln Project wishes was still around. The one before they nominated Trump.
Trump and Barr will make sure of it.
Keep telling yourself Trump cares. Known fact, keep repeating and it will become your reality and truth.
All the good is on Obama. Haha my god but yet y’all blame all the bad on trump. How does that work? Pick and choose
He &amp; Ivanka is pure evil garbage like trump-🗳🌊🗳🗳🗳
These are real President that stood up for our country—Bush didn’t do a good job but he wasn’t a lying traitor like trump!
Don’t trust them 🗳cause like trump they will stab you in the back ASAP!
He’s largely responsible for the destruction of the federal bench by putting political hacks like Sam Alito and Neomi Rao on the bench. And *this* is what puts him over the edge and leads him to the blindingly obvious conclusion that Trump’s a fascist? Seriously?
Okay, here’s the thing. Calabresi ought to look in the mirror. He’s spent decades building up the legal theories that form the foundation of authoritarianism. He actually called the impeachment of Trump “unconstitutional” (huh?).
Thank God. Do it President Trump. Stop the madness!!
Thank God!  Thank you President Trump!!

Trump’s Sudden Photo-Op Just Happened To Be During Obama’s John Lewis Eulogy
His diagnosis came less than two weeks after he attended President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cain, who co-chaired Black Voices for Trump, tweeted a photo of himself without a mask at the event, which was attended by several thousand people.
trump just made my choice to either vote by mail or in person for me. I'll stand in line for days if I have to to vote this crazy sob out of office.
listening to Trump news conference. We are screwed, little bitch is not going down without a fight. He just said it, litigations could take years.
Media never learn. First question: postponing the election. Trump goes off on nonsense propaganda.  * Ask about GDP, the Appeals court on Flynn, Russian Bounties, Ghislaine Maxwell documents, American Troops in Germany, Herman Cain at his Tulsa Rally
Wait, I thought he had a change of "tone".of course he had it during another bout where he used the racist nickname he gave COVID-19 so I guess we're not supposed to be surprised. Should call it what it is TRUMP VIRUS. Finally his name on something more lasting than a building.
Didn’t think i was getting the second wave of trump bucks but ya boy is. It’s UP
Such a good man, but he had to die because masks became a political issue thanks to Donald Trump.
Sorry but where I live hospitals are over run. In Texas doctors are choosing who dies and who lives. Just today Herman Cain died after attending a trump rally from Covid. How stupid can you be
Trump votes by mail so what’s the problem?  If he wants no voting by mail then he doesn’t need to vote by mail
Yea Trump don't know. He is just making calls that are best for him.
Has Trump even commented on this terrible economic news?
Trump just shit his diaper
Lord help you!  Trump is not a politician!  That’s why they all hate him soooo much!!
Do you fall for all Trump's cons?
I hope other Trump followers will take the tragic death of Herman Cain as a warning that refusing to wear a mask can and does cause death.

Interesting.  You actually blame Trump for #ChinaElectionInterference.  I thought it was intellectual dishonesty instead of just #TrumpDerangementSyndrome . My apologies.
Dehumanizing Trump supporters is why Hillary lost in 2016, and the continuation of the tactic is why Biden is going to lose in 2020.
So you won't do anything to help quash our Covid rise, but you'll spend time calling donors to contribute to Trump's campaign?   Do you think Floridians will forget? We won't.   DeSantis raises funds for Trump in advance of Florida events

Yes. Trump is very good at carrying out Putin's orders
Worked for Trump ....just sayin
Pretend like Trump is down 10 points until Nov 4th. Don't get complacent, don't lose momentum.
Over 150,000 Americans have died of COVID, millions more are infected, the virus is spreading across the country, Putin has bounties on the heads of our troops and Trump is fixated on keeping Confederate memorials? Really?
Political News on NPR: Herman Cain, Former GOP Presidential Candidate, Dies From COVID-19  Herman Cain had been hospitalized for nearly a month after testing positive for the coronavirus. Cain attended a Trump campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., in late June…
Well, we're going to re-elect him. We know everyone tried really hard to destroy the economy and burn our cities down and then try to blame it on Trump, but we can see what's going on and it won't work.
When someone such as Donald Trump declares he is the king and sent by God to rule America, there is nothing anyone can do about it. So sad.
Even though Trump is partly to blame for a lot of his base refusing to wear masks, this was a choice. Just like his base, if they want to deny it’s happening, they’re free to choose- but not free of the consequences of that choice.
Millions and millions too few to have an impact on what is right though. Trump is simply in desperation.
In 2016, when Hillary was supposed to win, Barry O said the election could never be influenced to change the outcome. Now, he sez Trump can do that.  Shut up Barry; you're just stupid.
So you would delay the Elections  But you won’t delay our children going back to school due to a COVID 19 ( The Trump Virus ) #WeWillVote
Blame Trump for holding a super spreader event
I’m not even republican but Herman Cain didn’t deserve to die. This is why you should wear masks, because this is either a Karma thing or a just wear freaking masks thing, and don’t go to Trump rallies.
This is such a beautiful service. So positive and full of love. All things trump isn’t capable of. He has no business there. Nobody is thinking about him. He does not matter. The real power of the people is in and outside of that church.
Agree but I really think this is a distraction for what is a very bad news day for Trump
First, I didn’t reply to you. I didn’t care about your comment. My reply was expanding on the thoughts I shared. It’s MY thread, you jumped in. Don’t like what you see? Move on.  Trump is clueless about our government. When he does something stupid, he will be called out for it.
How about you get serious and hold the negligent president of your party responsible. It didn't have to be this way but trump failed to act.
On the contrary, coming from Trump it’s most certainly a BAD idea. He’s a failed business speculator who decided to play politics. Now a failed politician bringing the same bad ideas to our country. With the same results. Bankrupting America. #SupremeLoser  It’s his desperation.
Not many of them were doing their jobs when it mattered - when the US was endangered by a man such as Trump.  So, not many of them knew or understand what their job really is. They think it's being an "entertainment reporter" I would guess.
A Trump bumper sticker, #MAGA hat, or Trump2020 flag!
Once we get rid of Trump, we should return the favor and help Russia get rid of their dictator
Their lives are more important than their jobs.  Get out of there. Speak out if Trump is endangering you
Trump floats unprecedented idea of delaying election, which he cannot do
It’s typical Trump thinking out loud, no restraint, thinking of himself. It’s definitely desperation.  Also, a moronic idea when he adds that absentee voting isn’t an issue — because he’s been called out on that — but in his mind differentiates it as deployed in wider scope.
However, I *will* add this: Trump is quickly killing more of his base than he is the Never Trumpers or the Democrats!  There is a reason to hope.
Maybe he's a sleeper groomed to give us a false sense that Trump will win.
Trump doesn't care about his millions of countrymen with food insecurities... But don't you dare touch his carbs!#NobodyLikesTrump
Political News on NPR: Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law  A number of high-ranking Democrats have already said they would not consider an election delay, making the prospect extremely unlikely.
I’ve thought so as well. He started by sending plants into protests. There’s a warrant out for white supremacist they believe started some of the violence in protests, another well known far right was on video at Portland dressed like “antifa” Trump is aTraitor to our democracy!
#NobodyLikesTrump  #TrumpIsARacist  If anyone is doubtful that Trump is an anti-American, THIS proves it.  It sounds so much more "official" than saying "we can't shoot the poverty away, but you don't have to share your space with it". It worked for them before.
Shame on you  for spreading his nonsensical distraction.  GOP has promoted mail-in voting for years. Change your damn headline. He's losing and desperate. He's creating chaos. You're helping him.  via
"Down in polls, and on a day a major campaign supporter who advertised (&amp; attended) his maskless-Tulsa rally dies, Trump floats delaying election, which he cannot do."  How's THAT,
Trump could care less. All he cares about is crowd size. An empty shell of a man.
Imagine DYING for Donald Trump? 😟
Herman Cain was a POC so most MAGAts will not care about his passing. They'll say Cain was faking his right-wing positions all these decades in order to - one day - bring down Trump with his death.
Trump floats November election delay — but he can’t do that, per the Constitution
Eventually…  it will go away.   Trump will succeed at something, eventually.
Herman Cain's death is another harsh blow. His own supporter, flaunting the CDC and Dr. Fauci's precautions, dies after contracting COVID-19 (possibly) during attendance at his less than stellar Tulsa Rally. While we all should mourn the loss of life, Trump knows this shows 4/
to attend. There's one spotlight gone from his orange complexion. The next is the GDP news. Trump cannot stand to be held accountable for his abysmal record as President and nothing is a harder pill for this 'successful businessman' than eating numbers like those.  3/
Today is July 30, 2020 and Trump has A LOT of fires to put out and there are many reasons that the spotlight isn't on him casting him a rosy glow. That's why tweeted the diversionary tweet about delaying the election. Let's take a look at everything (that I can see so far) 1/
The peak of trumps corruption that the spineless GOP will support. trump is dangerous scum. #VoteTrumpOut
For all that denial and reelection driven policy of ’economy over people’ that Trump advocates joined in, there is a consequence. How many have been infected?  Herman Cain has had the ultimate consequence. Are you willing to make that sacrifice for Trump? #TrumpLiesPeopleDie
I know.  We're all burying friends and family now (I've lost 17 people I knew closely OR family members).  I will remember their names - each of them - when I vote Trump out in November, and JUDGE  members afterwards.
thank you for your voice. I wish more republicans would speak up. Why are they so afraid of trump? You are not.
Guess in retrospect going maskless to Trump's Tulsa rally wasn't a very good idea. Thoughts and prayers.
Trump floats November election delay - but he can’t do that #SmartNews
Blood on Trump’s hands.
Will Trump even attend the funeral??
Wondering if Herman Cain's beneficiaries/estate is bound by any contract (NDA) Cain signed w/Trump.
Even as DeSantis tries to dodge this debate so as not to be out of step with his mentor, President Donald Trump, he almost seems to be making the case for continued federal benefits.
Also: EVEN IF the election is delayed for some reason, Trump does NOT stay in office past January 20th. The Constitution puts the Speaker of the House in charge if there is no elected President or VP (as President) fulfilling his/her term in office.
Y'all may want to point out this: EVEN IF the election is delayed for some reason, Trump does NOT stay in office past January. The Constitution puts the Speaker of the House in charge if there is no elected President or VP (as President) fulfilling his/her term in office.

👍 Woke. From my tweet… “Only Congress could alter the federal statute on when states appoint their electors. #TrumpIsClueless  More indication that Trump is desperate. #TrumpResignNow”
"Pulling the country back to normal" was NEVER Trump's election pitch. Never!
Of course, it’s not something Trump can do. Even more, I’d bet his campaign and aides are not happy that he tweeted this. Foremost, it’s a clear sign of desperation. It’s his delusional mind looking for any way out. The economy is NOT getting better. He’s utterly failed COVID19.
If Congress postponed the date of the election, they could not do so indefinitely. The Constitution's 20th Amendment establishes an end date for the presidential term - noon 1/20/2021. So unless he is duly re-elected before then, Trump is out of a job on that date.
This moron is the sickest crybaby I’ve ever come across! What a LOSER!!
Lol a pastor lying like Trump ...smh you should be ashamed of yourself
Exactly , not enough time and Nancy Pelosi would be acting POTUS ,  typical Trump , not reading how this all can pan out
Trump is just sounding off because he will loose overwhelmingly and be embarrassed. He is scared you know, it’s that reality thing he can’t face. Poor Delusional Donnie.

Trump finds annoyance in the most insignificant issues, everything actually. No wonder he’s such s miserable person.

When Trump acted January 30th,  &amp;  said "Trump is overreacting". You know, you were there.   , you are deflecting from the #Reparations you and your husband owe. What's your plan for liquidation of your assets &amp; picking a slave to pay?
Memers Have a New Campaign Aimed at Getting Trump Out of Office
While they sit by and let Trump and AG Barr trample Americans rights. #CorruptAndComplicitGOP
AG Barr acts independently of POTUS Trump --this Truth is a hell of a lot better than the lies that Holder and Lynch acted independently of what Obama wanted.   via
Jim Jordan is right - They’ve been attacking you (AG Barr) ever since for simply stating the truth that the Obama and Biden administration spied on the (Trump) campaign.  via
Fauci responds to Trump tweet, claims under no circumstances has he been misleading Americans-to that I say BS !  via
You know right b4 this video 1st went viral of happening. tRump was tweeting rants of 2nd amendment. Just as tRump did before the protesters showed up on Michigan governor's door over Covid 19 shutdown.
I think in today society social media is a way for any spy to talk between the lines. Each involved has a chain to get and receive response. How many active social media accounts to tRump, N his clan of Trugs got? I count 3 each off top of my head. JS
TRUMP GOES FULL STELLA IMMANUEL:
They all need to be defunded If this country goes to socialism, our freedom will be stripped and it will cause an uprising for sure!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 KEEP AMERICA FREE VOTE TRUMP/PENCE for 20/20. Please
Analysis | Trump ad falsely suggests Biden supports defunding police
Opinion | Biden is advertising in Texas. That’s ominous for Trump.
Good, but did he suffer any peaceful pain?
Mary Trump says the U.S. has devolved into a version of her ‘incredibly dysfunctional family’
Opinion | Trump can’t land a blow on Biden, and it’s driving him crazy
Opinion | Republicans can stand up to Trump — they just don’t want to

Obama and Biden, together again to troll Trump
Ya think???    Perspective | Ivanka Trump’s Find Something New career campaign is more hype than help
Trump’s ‘Operation Legend’ was supposed to combat crime. It’s produced one arrest, and some see a political stunt.
Spin, deride, attack: How Trump’s handling of Trump University presaged his presidency
House GOP’s pleas to Republican National Committee for financial help go unanswered  Trump's keeping all the money?
Bought and paid for by Trump and his Republican buddies. Got to wonder if this was leaked to prove to Dear Leader that he's trying to keep up the bargain.
John Lewis bastardized Trump in public and Trump still lowered The Nation's flags, the flags wealthy athletes desecrate,  to half-mast.
Ted Cruz has no balls, allowing the Donald to talk about his wife and not defend her and turned around and stuck his head up Trump's ass. NO BALLS. Why is the national anthem played before any of the games anyway ? Why? Change the tradition! Can't we all just get along?
Trump retweeted a video with false covid-19 claims. One doctor in it has said demons cause illnesses.
We understand. Just vote Red in November!  They are doing everything possible to discredit President Trump. Pray that is not working with our citizens
trump and Barr are going to take you ALL down with them. #CorruptAndComplicitGOP #TrumpGestapo
Agree. I’m being absolutely serious when I say many 6 year olds could do a better job leading than Trump. More reasoning, sense of right and wrong, empathy and focus.
Honestly I want NO reminders of Trump ever. Looking forward to a time in the near future when that name is gone from memory.  However, something like this would be an appropriate official portrait (if there must be one).
Trump is working for Russia not the USA
He's Trump's buddy.  He seemed fine yesterday at Barr's hearing, so he could be asymptomatic?
You've literally done nothng to protect us from that " CONMAN" Trump, as you once called him .
Agree. As we all have mentioned many times, most children are mature and socially responsible than Trump. Also, superior cognitive capability.   In kindergarten, he wouldn’t be allowed to lead the line — how does the  explain his continued tantrums in the Oval Office?
South Carolina, wake up &amp; smell the roses! It no longer “fun” to drive your miserable roads, especially your Interstates! They are the worst of Eastern States! Get your message of equality together,or no one will even come through your state!Vote- in Jamie Harrison‼️(Dump Trump)!
Hate Trump, Hate Trump, blah,blah,blah
trump is a coward #VoteTrumpOut
Rep Jones: I do believe we as Americans have a right to our opposition  to whom we support. When you lie about our first Black President and give credit to Trump for an economy he inherited and lie about Trump's entanglements with Putin you are a disgrace to the Democratic Party.
How childish can a grownup be? How childish can one be AND be allowed to lead a nation?  Trump was jealous Dr. Fauci threw the Washington Nationals opening day pitch.   HE ‘pitched a fit’ — lied about Yankees opener —then attacks Fauci. #TrumpIsALoser
Let me not get into the DNA debates because a lot  talking twitter shit talking about y’all would continue to be a parent to the kid gettttttttt theeeeee wholeeeeeee fuckkkkkkk offfffff Donald Trump Twitter lying
Wouldn't it be hilarious if it was the Patriots, the team I love to hate!  I hate that they are so good!  I hate that my Cowboys are so meh for 25 years!  Bellichick likes Trump, but I don't think he'd force the team to stand.  They ALL just need to stay in the locker room.Because he tear gassed and use cops the exact same as trump. For those protests. But hes a dem so they forget.
They’ve reallocated the funds to pay for Trump’s legal fees. #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
Trump is a coward.
Hey tRump,  is Putin,  Xi,  and Kim ready to interfere in our elections?   I bet you talked to Putin about election interference but you are not man enough to talk to him about the bounty he put on our soldiers!  #PUTIN/tRumpbounty onoursoldiers !
Florida landslide for Trump coming.
Fox knows they have to take a different tack to survive because the Trump bandwagon has 4 flat tires and no one in the band left to play except his sycophants and family.
Trump is deeply stupid.
everyone wants them to open SAFELY.   Unfortunately for the US, because of the willful ignorance of Trump and his followers, the US cannot open schools safely.  The lack of leadership and clusterfu*k of stupid statements was/is responsible for over 150,000 American deaths.
Trump's strategy is that he has no strategy
But move on her like a B trump is better?
incase yall didnt hear, its fuck trump !
guillen family, im sending prayers and strength!!!!!!! fuck trump
Trump is too stupid to understand.
I have been a lifelong Democrat until 2016. You blew it. You hate the one man who could’ve saved us more than you wanted to defeat trump. Bernie Sanders is the answer but you skewed the question. How could you care more about power and corporations more than the people?
Trump’s America. #WeWillVote
It is the Trump virus.
And it gets me these ginormous letters from Donald J Trump almost every other week..... Never Trump Republican!
Go Regis ... Irish and a Trump supporter ... RIP☘️
Trump's stupidity and diarrhea.
Trump says we are leveling off.
Thank the gross incompetence of Trump.
It was absolutely appalling to hear his comments! He brought shame on himself by disrespecting the memory, life's work &amp; accomplishments of the very man he was eulogizing by claiming Trump &amp; his Administration are the most racist ever!
Set up so trump can “come to the rescue”...
Keeping this forefront is EXACTLY what the Republicans want. They have failed in every other attempt to bring down  .  We should stand by the anyone but trump philosophy.  Any of the “women” he has on his short list will be an asset to his Presidency and our country.
Not!! Trump 2020! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸!!
Are you a reporter or a Trump/Pence shill?
I think Trump will flee on November 3rd as soon as he knows he lost.  He won’t let SDNY follow through.  He will resign &amp; Pence will pardon.  The family will flee to a country with no extradition treaty
#Obama went full Democrat-rally #Trump bash mode (using the term "there are those") at #JohnLewisMemorial. It was painful to watch
I love my president Donald Trump!
#WeWillVote Trump and his clumsy goons out.
Only Congress has that power!  Trump's an ignorant!
We call it the Trump Economy
That's what I thought. Dems will cry NEVER. So then there's no way they can in future ask for a delay. Trump has  a plan to nullify mail in voting
Who’s the Boss, Alyssa?  That’s right. President Trump  Who’s the boss for the next 4 years?  Yep! DJT  To know him is to love him😉
Everybody's clammering for indictments. Biden is such a weak candidate, surely best tactics would be to wait until after elections. God forbid trump should lose, he can then use it as ammunition in favour of illegitimate biden presidency
So Trump "knows he is going to lose" but then she says "it's going to take every single one of us to make that happen"? The finish doesn't sound nearly as confident as the beginning.
No, wait, he might be right.  Trump was to blame too.
For some reason, I realized I have been thinking if Trump loses, I will never have to hear his name again and he will stop tweeting and we can stop talking about him. But I just realized that’s probably not the case...
i have been banned several times for posting pictures of Gobbels, comparing him to some of the statements made by trump by  and some of the remarks made by his minions! 30 days at a time! fuck zukenburg!
Graham saw an opportunity to back stab Trump so he took it....
Pence kneels not to the Lors. But to Trump, the king of avarice and depravity. #TrumpDemonSeed
Perfect excuse for   to  boot Trump off the ticket.   couldn’t compete against a real candidate. Republicans would walk away with the election.
You are absolutely correct....😘🌹👍👍👍The RINO's are BACK Stabbing Trump even more than usual now.....It's time to make some changes....
Wtf are they up to? His smugness and smirking is revealing thst there is definitely a plot brewing to cancel this election and make trump a dictator.
Remember that Death Star Trump thing? I think this is part of it.
Tragic for whom? This idiot made a conscious decision to attend Trump’s indoor Tulsa rally, where no one was wearing masks, knowing he has pre-existing health issues. I’m sorry but I don’t get it.
trump hasn’t done his job and must clear out! #TrumpDeathToll152K
Trump rally got him
Trump killed Herman Cain to satisfy his ego.  #TrumpDemonSeed
When are you going to congratulate Joe Biden for his now brilliant prediction that Trump was going to try to postpone the election?
Trump prefers flags and statues over the Constitution because flags and statues don’t have consequences. #TrumpDemonSeed
Trump put out his best Troll Tweet today and it's working great😀😀
Wtf is he smirking? This isn’t a joke. He thinks trump can do it, that’s why.
Has anyone connected trump’s bizarre and enduring promotion of #hydroxycholoroquine to a financial interest held by him or his family?
Trump didn’t even shed a tear over his brother or father dying so he won’t
This was Trump's ultimate Troll Tweet so far......my phone screen is bulging from leftist/liberal heads exploding all over Twitter......😀😀😀😀😀
Trump lowering prices for prescription drugs!
Trump and his campaign should be proud.
After Tulsa! Trump should be proud.
Cain was at the Tulsa rally.   Now his family should sue the a Trump campaign &amp; family
Donald Trump killed Herman Cain
They're in office of get rich!! And Trump-Russia pays a helluva lot.
Trump does it every day. 🤦‍♀️
Manchin has voted with Trump more than any other Democratic Senator. If they piss HIM off, that’s telling
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
What does Putin give Trump in exchange?
What and idiot; President Trump has done more than any President.  Trump 2020.
Delayed? No. Move it up. Let’s imprison Trump ASAP!
This guy is everything Trump is looking for in a lackey?
Trump freed Loon😩💪🏾😂
Trump Fake News.
The “anyone but trump” stand should apply to a Vice Presidential choice as well.  Let’s be happy he chose a female and that “every” woman on his short list has great potential and qualifications! #JoeBidenForPresident2020
DELAY THE ELECTION:  Pres Trump suggest to delay the election.  Is it a subject for intelligent discourse?   With mail in ballots being unreliable, fraudulent and the China virus keeping people home, the idea has merit. Why then are socialists against it?
It's safe now according to Trump so let's hold the election tomorrow.
You heard it trump voters. The election is delayed - why even bother going to the ballot box in November amirite or amirite?
I got my focus back Who writes this stuff? Edward A Larivee
Absolutely brilliant. It’s always a good morning when someone uses a Goodfellas quote for anything Trump related.
Your Trump flag was made in China sit tf down
I'm pretty neutral about the guy. I have noticed though that most of the left has him so far up their asses that they cough orange dust. A lot of their focus is Trump this, Trump that. Their pages are littered with negative propaganda about him. Lol, so sad..
You are 100% correct....that's why We need to be careful of which Republicans We reelect.....IT'S time to get rid of The RINO's.....and put in people that will totally have Trump's back....
Please explain to me exactly how Trump makes your Parents think or act a certain way..???Has he somehow commandeered their Freewill.....you sound totally ridiculous....

Trump has been compromised no doubt and acting like a Russian agent. So what do we do now?
I would take it! one if the first S Fl covid patients Carlos Gavidia swears  the “Trump Coctail” saved his life! He organized the 1st MAGA boat parade.... it was INCREDIBLE...road from Jupiter to Mar lago,  over  3,000 boats &amp; many on land...so patriotic 🇺🇸🇺🇸
I don’t believe there will be an election on 11-3. We’re leaving the federal reserve at any second that’s why  there’s no coins.   President Trump could announce NESARA on 11-2 A election must be held 120 days after announcement for the president &amp; ALL of Congress!   Loving it!
1/2. I read her post as being IRT POC, poverty and social housing. Why don’t you look at the stats and compare them per capita. It’s safe to assume that Trump, who has made countless racist remarks about POC was doing so in that post &amp;  was responding .../2
Florida for Trump 2020
Yeah trump's threatening america and not the rioters burning down buildings and threating to tear down the system..
Thank you President Trump!
Democratic super PAC quotes Reagan in anti-Trump ad set to air on Fox News: 'Are you better off?'
Your president is the only one with the balls to stand up to other countries and look out for our country’s best intrest. I suppose you would rather have life long politicians continue to destroy and sell out this Country for their own financial gain. Thank you President Trump!
Fearless till Trump is gone, forever!!
#BabyTantrum Trump walks out of briefing after CNN question
Josh, I don’t get it. I heard from a lot of friends that they hated (and still hate HRC). And these aren’t hard core MAGA types, they’re professionals (both men and women) who can’t stand her. And as bad as Trump is today, they’d still vote for him over her.
There will be no need for low income housing! Let the reset begin! Thank you President Trump for all your hard work for the people. WWG1WGA
Because Trump mentioned it when COVID first started and said it was worth looking into since then it is nonstop Dems blasting the drug because he said that What if it did really help WE WILL NEVER KNOW,, how come all the homeless people aren’t dying
Yesss 2020 we love reinforcing segregation just like the housing and project development did thank you Trump you have successfully regressed us as a nation beyond what you promised 🥰🥰
#RonDesantisFailedFlorida for his love of trump. Trump can’t save him from going down in history as the man who killed his state. #DeathSantis. Someday you will be held accountable.
Ah, legalizing segregation and promoting white-only suburbs. Classic Trump.   Further down the toilet we go.
Trump's Putin's Bitch!!!
I suppose you learned about Trojan Horses from trump University!😂
Finally.  Next he must realize it’s hate we feel.  Trump admit we ALL hate you
I agree 💯 and saying trump “learned his lesson” during impeachment
There's no adequate testing anywhere in the United States.  Thanks fucking trump
Swan killed it, good questions, Trump is a putt and a Russian agent. That we can be clear of now.
Correct... But Trump's move goes against his military advisers.  Tbh Germany is more than capable to defend itself. Still, moving such troops out weakens the alliance.
I had a great time aboard the official Trump boat with Captain Carlos Gavidia. See all my videos on the different boat parades using the link in bio. #trumpboat #trumpboatparade #capecanaveral #trump2020🇺🇸
Sean Hannity lies as much as Trump. #TraitorTrump
Donald Trump is a Trojan Horse for Russia. Pass it on.
The biggest reason I support Trump.  Bring our jobs back that these political hacks stood by and watched get shipped overseas to the great detriment of our middle class!
Peace keepers. Stability in Europe. In case you haven’t noticed there are evil men in the world. The next Hitler/Trump is out there.
Trump is cruel.  Cruelty is his point &amp; lining his pockets to take taxpayer money &amp; put it in his own businesses.
so trump. good meme.
Trump sure is, buddy. #TrumpTreason
If Donald trump bans tik tok I will literally cry
The insanity is really getting to me. The insomnia is real because I’m afraid to wake up in this nightmare everyday
Trump said in a new interview that he had not raised concerns with President Vladimir V. Putin about intelligence suggesting that Russia covertly offered bounties for killing U.S. and coalition troops in Afghanistan in a recent phone call he had with the country’s leader.*
*Trump says phone call with Putin was to ‘discuss other things.’

#Sleepy Joe if you’re awake would you tells us how you would handle this Virus You say President Trump is doing a horrible job Now that you have had 5 months to come up with a plan Let Us Know what the plan is!!Come On Tell US JOE
You really are the worst. Purity testing in the time of trump is the single most irresponsible platform I've ever seen. You are no socialist. You are a privved up white guy with no actual concern for others.
This is Trump’s America .  Nazis are allowed to demonstrate, country us destroyed by a oandemic, riots int he streets, is America Great again ? #shame
Funny we say the same about trump being a puppet for the far right
Since I know most of you don't actual read articles and want to blame America or trump. You may actually want to go read the article
You can bank on Nadler being one of the Regime's paid stooges...the Democrats send Iran our taxpayers money and they send some of it back to the Democrats...that's one of the biggest reasons that Trump stopped a lot of foreign aid money...because of the graft and fraud
It's coincidental to the book imo....I think Trump is showing his contempt of China because of what they did with the COVERT19....yes I spelled it that way because it was another one of their sneaky plans to bring down America...
Trump clowns always use “they.”
Nope, a vote for Trump is a vote for Trump. Biden still has to earn every vote no matter how terrible trump has been. Trump + Johnson actually defeated Clinton + Stein in the popular vote.

I saw one slosberg ad where he somehow tries to tie polsky to Trump saying they're both "liars". I'm not in the district and don't particularly like either. I just found that slosberg ad a huge stretch. I'm more bothered that I found this debate while I had DVRd a Regis tribute.
Fishy, in plain sight, trumps MO, thinks he’s clever, find trump money trail to Kodak. What’s up with Kodak?
If only it were trump sr. The world would breathe a collective sigh of relief.
The famous #Trumpcorner  FL.   We love #TRUMP USA 🇺🇸
I’ve been wondering why they both did it. Was it a moment of forgetting, or did they consciously decide “this is a significant meeting &amp; we want to convey ...”. Either way, it’s unbelievably stupid. (Or an unbelievable stroke of luck  if it leads to the demise of Trump 😏)
wish they aired in Michigan. I can't even read the comments on the local news. So many Trump supporters, I have to keep mouth shut. I'd be in FB jail right away lol
Republicans used to love absentee ballots because many of their voters are invalids and shut-ins and cant get to the polls. Trump is pulling this conspiracy out of his asshole.
And trump hasn’t?
you're #KillerCuomos brother right ?? The same guy that put sick people in  a nursing home killing thousands . Then gets caught stockpiling ventilators after saying Trump never sent him any ?? 😂🤣😂 Some of us actually pay attention #CNNFakeNews 🖕🖕
I need someone to explain to me, after all we’ve seen and heard in the past few weeks, how the f is trump still in office? How is Barr not in prison? How is gaetz not under investigation? What the hell  happened to my country??? I feel like I’m living in the twilight zone
#HydroxycholoroquineWorks ends the pandemic and allows the Trump economy to return before the election.  That is why Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Instagram erased Trump's tweet on America's Frontline Doctors speaking out!
"In an election year, everything significant that happens is about the election"... #CoronavirusHoax was designed to crash the Trump economy as Bill Maher called for.
Don’t bother there won’t be an election on November 3. Mark my words Trump will announce NESARA On November 2, after-which a presidential and all of Congress election must be held 120 days after NESARA announcement.   Trump gets a brand new Congress &amp; exposes mail in voter fraud!
i want to but my class was like 275+ and maybe half voted from trump according to facebook
Yeah!! I just saw this! I thought I read 4th highest ‘leader’ in the world somewhere a few months ago, but this source as at April 19 is ranked 5th. But he’s had another 2 pay rises since then.
Wait until they See the Political Add that Trump makes from this idiotic display today....they will really regret doing this...Bank on it...😀😀
No! NESARA &amp; GESARA Is not happening now. We’re leaving the Federal Reserve now.   NESARA Will be announced probably November 2. A new election must happen with the president and ALL of Congress 120 days there after.   Trump gets a new Congress And exposes mail in voter fraud!
Will, have you read any articles by Matt Taibbi?  The hatred of Trump has unfortunately changed the media.  They only care about one thing- electing Biden.
Trump will never have a plan regarding the virus or unemployed starving Americans. His election and political power is first and foremost, always has been. May he rot in hell
Absolutely not. Have a real hard time accepting anything  medically related with trump.
They wouldn't even show up for Trump Jax convention. So there's that.

You do what I did I bought a Trump mask on Amazon I’m sure that pissed off Amazon!
I appreciate your open mind for truth.   I think John F Kennedy was the best president in our country. I think the bushes the Obamas &amp; Clintons have destroyed our country.   Ronald Reagan did as good job as he could.  Trump is trying to drain the swamp Republicans &amp; Democrats!!!
This is a humongous deal. I know this industry - well.   The pharmaceutical industry is as corrupt as Satan himself.   Trump cannot deal with Satan so he had to find a company that would produce in America that’s not corrupt.  Bravo President Trump I’m so proud of you! God bless!

I seem to recall the original site was vetoed by Trump and this new site is where he wanted it - closer to his hotel in Washington where he can sell overpriced rooms
Democrats cannot allow the Pentagon wish list to stay in this bill either. To try to replace the money taken for Trump's stupid wall in this bill is disgraceful.
Easy, whatever makes Trump look bad in their eyes.
Grifters.  Trump Charities.  Trump a University.  Fake family will happily screw you out of your money
In all things relating to President Trump there is one line in the Old Testament, Wisdom, chapter 2, to remember: "For their own malice blinded them." (Note: "Wisdom" is in Catholic Bibles - you will not find it in King James Versions.)
I for one remember President Trump taking early and decisive action  against Covid-19  by blocking travel to and from China.  And the Democrats in general and Joe Biden in particular called him a Xenophobe and tried to keep travel open.  That tells you what they wanted .
MR HOGAN: Republican from Progressive , socialist Maryland. He is a basic anti Trumper.What  else? He can’t get elected otherwise. He has no choice as he appears on MSNBC, the NBC dnc anti Trump station. He trashes TRUMP.

Not true. Trump doesn’t work like that- that drug cost Under $10 for the supply needed for Covid. The other drug is $3000 a pill. Wake up

I don’t watch Fox News 😉 what have they done? List the things they have done besides donating money to BLM that goes directly to the DNC.besides telling people to vote as this is Trump’s fault. Obama &amp; Biden didn’t do anything for Black people or to help with police brutality
When Trump successfully stops black people from moving to the suburbs, I wonder if he can do something about all the white people that keep moving into my mostly black neighborhood. Everytime I look around more  white people are become my  neighbors. They are peaceful though.
Dude you’re so lost, it’s not even worth replying to you. Trump has been the toughest president on China. Biden and Obama worshiped China and allowed them to get away with everything and guess what? They profited from it. You need to educate yourself before commenting

Was it worth it .. I think not! trump won't even know who Herman Cain is. He probably thinks it was the brain surgeon that works for him.
Willing to die for a racist that couldn't stand Black and Brown people of color. Has trump even acknowledged Cain's passing..
I never fully bought into the fact that Trump was a racist. I was wrong. He is a racist.

Here we go. Trump sees the polls. Knows he can’t win a free and fair election. Will Republicans stand against this corruption? Doubtful. They value power over democracy and our Constitution. Ultimately it will be up to the Supreme Court to allow us to pick our president on Nov. 3
2 minutes ago trump is talking about delaying the elections.
Whenever Trump says something is "overly burdensome", all I hear is my kids' whining that picking up their legos is "too hard" and that their "arms are tired"...

I wore one of my new Trump shirts to the gym; my mother worried. She worries when I wear Trump shirts in public; she shouldn't have to, but she's not wrong. The "tolerant" Left would bash my skull over this shirt; that's what Democrats created.   #RememberInNovember #Trump2020
Holy shit, I have trump derangement syndrome
Oh my God LOL I swore it said President Trump
Max. Trump doesn’t run the individual states.
Thank you!
Absolutely but they have more to worry about Trump still going to SKIN some 🐇
trump needs to be put in a straight jacket. He's crazy.
Being an Anarchist isn’t illegal. And the agitators are your federal officers. Portland had thinned to a murmur until you amped it up. Typical Trump create a problem to solve. Take a victory lap... but he effs that up too!

You seem well versed. Must of missed this.

I’m beginning to feel sorry for some of my friends who are Trump supporters.  Their whole worldview has boiled down to those-who-support-Trump and those-who-don’t-support-Trump. The former are all very fine people. The latter are all anti-American POS.
Idiot, retarded, jealous. Yes you are right about one thing, we hate you and Love Dr. Fauci... He's our hero. Fauci is the man. Dr. Fauci does not talk crazy talk. He believes in the Science. You trump believe in magical thinking 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
28% of respondants want trump to be re-elected.
Nobody in Congress call Trump a bitch or worse in public, that’s the difference
Trump looks like he's going to have a stroke right now.. We should be so lucky. He is so hyped up, he has become incoherent. Lies, lies, lies.
trump is the most horrific American Enemy in our life time. There is no new low for this monster, not until he falls into the flames of hell!
I’m sure you are ready to do whatever trump will tell you to do.  Question:  Do you think hurricanes are the result of demon sperm or alien DNA?

Yea, I know. And Trump has let us down too.

150,000 Dead Americans =  37,500 Trump Benghazi's
Several of the weapons programs that would get funding previously lost money when the Trump administration took Pentagon funding to use on the southern border wall earlier this year. In February, the Pentagon announced it was redirecting $3.8 billion
How the hell is anyone supposed to know who the Trump Stormtroopers are versus some crazy Militia cosplay assholes who rented a minivan?! This is terrifying.
So disappointing when someone cool as fuck denies all racial issues and loves trump smh I’m so disappointed
150,000 Dead Americans = 37,500 Trump Benghazi's.
Obsession with crime and punishment.  The left wants to defund the police and do direct harm to the cops. They are REMOVING police. Trump passed prison reform  No.   We arent obsessed.
6. Controlled mass media. Perhaps. But. It by Trump. By the LEFT. THEY deplatform. THEY censor. THEY refuse to offer a balanced perspective   Not happening - at least not by Trump.
4. Supremacy of the Military - the Left goes on and on anour generals who hate Trump. Every time a Republican gets in office they must repair the mess the Democrat who preceded them did to the military. They aren’t “supreme” just offered a bit of respect.
150,000 Dead Americans = 37,500 Trump Benghazi's.  No number of dead Americans is high enough to make Trump care.  #coronavirus  #COVID19
2. Disdain for a Human Rights: For all intents and purposes, the only violations of human rights in this nation are being perpetrated by LEFTISTS. The Right are being silenced, deplatformed, canceled and marginalized. Not the Left. And Trump has NOTHING to do with that

Anyone who chooses to buy into the nonsense being shoveled about Trump can pound sand. It takes effort to find the truth and those who don’t make an effort don’t deserve to be called Republicans
They're so stupid Antifa is eventually coming for them. If Trump loses they'll be coming for the Democrats too.
If we can’t have an educator can we at least have one who believes in public education and does not see education as a way to advance a religious agenda and enrich her friends in the charter school business? Another reason to defeat Trump — if he goes, she goes.
I’m a Democrat. I hold the opinion that Atty. Gen. Barr has acted only in the interest of Trump and his cronies. I think he is corrupt. But this hearing is awful. Dems can be deservedly critical of Barr but to invite a witness and then not even let him answer questions is wrong.
Absolutely, I am in raged by these DemocRATS they R disgusting and rudest Thugs I have ever seen in Congress,trying to degrade Barr n Trump
Just found out my brother in law is a Trump supporter🥴
It must be for someone like you who can barely hear above the sounds of the trump administration breaking laws and tearing up the constitution.
Something about Trump hiring a doctor that says having sex with a demon can make you sick.

A safe bet, Miss SEC. There is no way on earth Biden’s people will let him go on stage to debate Trump or take part in another unscripted interview, regardless of how friendly the interviewer would be.  He can’t even take questions at his pressers.
Did you see this on CNN? Of course you didn’t and never will. Of course I could be wrong but they have their hands full with phony witch hunts &amp; baseless attacks on Trump as well as other important things like reporting fake news about border crisis &amp; distorting Trump’s record ,

Of course they did. They are trying to win not create material for Trump campaign ads.😊
My original prediction was that Trump would wait until August to really react to the nationwide unrest caused entirely by the Democrats. I think he’s started to ramp things up in preparation. Lots of people are exhausted by what they see. If he times it well, it’ll be a huge deal
Oh Gary. This is pathetic. Perhaps you might want to gaze over the news the last 55 days in Portland. Or other cities where, up until just recently, no federal response occurred. These are leftists, like you, who’ve been rioting. They hate the US. They hate Trump.

We have actual, tangible proof that there is a shadowy type of organization within our government, the Deep State, actively working to oppose President Trump and his agenda, having plotted against him becoming the president since the beginning of his campaign.
The conspiracy theorists don’t look so wacky now, do they? Perhaps we ought to give more critical thought to some of the things underground individuals purpose about the goings on of our government?

The prescription drug thing Trump did today. By lowering drug prices helps all Americans. I don't understand why it's not being reported more. It's historic.
Biden should ease up on that Trump is a racist stuff. Has shown a number of instances of being a racist. At some point Trump is going to throw that in his face. Then you know what he'll do, he'll lie. That's what liberal Democrats do they lie.

I watch all press conferences on C-SPAN and also Trump n Rallies when he has them they show it all Fox isn’t the station it used to be SAD 2
So the Left is saying that since Trump is supposedly determined to divide us, if he wins they promise more violence? That threat sounds like election interference to me.   Extortion: it's the Democratic way.
No. But he’s not a Republican and was certainly better than trump.
Always watch all Press n Trump on C-SPAN they show it all even the rally’s

Any idea which news item Trump is trying to obscure with the stupid bullshit about election delays?  1. 32.9% economic contraction  2. Swann interview on Russian bounties 3. John Lewis funeral  My guess is the funeral. He views his absence as a slight, and the attendees a threat.
Shocking. Sobering. Is that what President Trump meant by American carnage?
Based on his post-Trump verbal diarrhea, I have serious doubts about how sincerely "pro-life" French is or has been. I suspect he saw it merely as another opportunity to grift, as so many of his NT pals have demonstrated how they saw it.
Delay of the election is the only way for sure, 100%, that Donald Trump isn’t President past 1/20/2021. He’s bluffing. I call.

Exactly ! I hope someone on his team has kept a damn list of all the 💩 trump has done so they can be undone. Wish we could undo Kavanaugh.

The tRUMP is an idiot on every front. Period.
Brexit is a UK FU because of their tRUMP foolishness. Immigration is a global militaristic problem way bigger than EU. And trade has been very successful inside EU. That US conservatives are jealous is not the EU's issue.

A traitor, an idiot, a madman who’s planting the seeds for a civil war and talking about postponing the election &amp; none of you are calling for trump’s immediate removal. Is it the $ or are you all just cowards?
Trump is the master of deflection. Which his “delay the election” antic, is he deflecting from what?
Simple - Trump killed Mr Cain by not taking the precautions health professionals warned him of. Trump also had his goons go around the arena taking signs that told people attending to distance.
Why isn't #MSM covering this issue instead of giving #trump free air time to perpetuate his ridiculous notion that the 2020 election can be postponed?  just announced it will do so when #trump holds a briefing shortly. SHAMEFUL #DoBetter #GrabYourRemote *click*
They were announcing FROM THE BEGINNING that it was impossible to stop a virus when China was silent and lied till too many infected to stop. It didn't hurt #Trump enuf so keep going... So w/ your logic country should be locked until rushed mandated vaxes are given.?

Yes but listen to Trump talk as well...he hasn't a clue what he's talking about he's so uninformed and chooses to be that way. He slurs and stumbles reading. And come on he just straight makes shit up.
Which is why all this panic about President Trump refusing to leave office is unfounded.
That video explains why Trump need dog whistles #hatersgonnahate #FailureInChief
Who knew there would be a President worse than Bush? Dumber than Bush? Until Trump came along
There are Presidents that lead and then there is Trump.
He will try anything to keep Putin happy. He must be stopped now. He has no authority to do this but will try to push the limits. GOP patriotism over politics. Do the right thing. Treason comes with a price. What side of history will you be on?
I know some ppl get weird in the replies, but that's the internet for you!  He's 1000% a Trump dissenter.  Go on YouTube and watch his videos about masks, they are hilarious!

U.S. Sen.  of Florida said, emphatically, that Election Day won’t be delayed.   The president’s suggestion is essentially impossible both logistically and legally:
#trumpvirus. Trump is dumb enough to trust China &amp; ignore US Intel...yet Singapore, S Korea, Vietnam etc were all smart enough not to trust China. Trump must be held accountable
I call your offices' only to be hung up on or told to leave a message.  You do a great job reporting the news but nothing to protect your constituents. Also, why don't you give us your opinion on Trump's delaying the election. We need this information. Man-up!
Hell yeah! Make Trump pardon Flynn and then make him testify before Congress without the benefit of 5th Amendment protection.   Hold Flynn in contempt if he refuses to testify.   Flynn didn’t just lie to the  that’s simply ONE OF THE CHARGES he was allowed to plea to.
Strange you keep centering trump like he really matters at this point. Pretty sure family members of all the "at risk" ages groups would do whatever they can to have them be in their lives longer. Jobs vs loved ones is a false dichotomy.
Donald Trump is terrified.
No we will not. Trump 2020

The Trump presidency!
Called both of Florida's Senators today to leave this message:   I'm calling to demand that the Senator denounce President Trump's tweet calling to postpone federal elections this November. Such a statement is a direct assault on the Constitution of the United States.

You really think Trump doesn’t want the election in November?  You’re not bright  .  He wanted to throw it out there 1st because he knows Dems disagree with him on EVERYTHING.  Now,  you can’t play that card or you look like Fools... which, that shoe probably fits.
You thrived by getting paid from Trump campaign money, the rest of us are not thriving due to this administration lack of leadership during this pandemic!

As long as Trump loses before Jan 20th, when Biden takes the oath of office, it doesn’t matter when the election is held.  The shorter that “lame duck” Trump is in power, the better.
So one u r a joke, two this is the same old crap &amp; three no one cares today we r feeling good having heard 3 past presidents speak giving needed nourishment to our souls. Trump &amp; his enablers look really ugly right now I would give it a rest if I were u
I am glad that Mr. Cain doesn't know that trump just tweeted out his new favorite pizza.
When asked,  said he hadn't seen  tweet.   He then explained Florida is working hard to ready itself for a Nov. 3 election:

Important note: "Trump’s tweet came on the same morning the country reported an economic contraction of 9.5 percent in the second quarter of 2020, an unprecedented recession."
If we average the economic year of 2015, it’s is equal to 2019. In addition, Trump’s peak never exceeded Obama’s peak.
"The president’s suggestion is essentially impossible both logistically and legally. Some states begin voting in just a few short weeks, and only Congress has the power to change the election’s date."  Read
See how smart Trump is?  A few liberals floated extending the time to vote and some more pushed for vote by mail (though it's too late to print and mail new materials now).  So he's now got them saying we demand the election be held on time!  LMAO
If you look at David Jolly's voting record, he's as misogynist as Marco Rubio and he NEVER missed a chance to vote against healthcare access for working Americans. I'm not impressed Jolly says mean things about Trump because he shares so many of Trump/Rubio's Republican values.

I believe Vegas would put the odds at 1:1 that Trump will have a signing ceremony backed by Barr and Pompeo where he signs an “executive order” to “indefinitely delay the 2020 presidential election”. It might not be legal or binding but he will do it and the DOJ will support him.
Someone once said everything trump touches dies. We are witnessing that in real time, with real people dying. This is madness
I worry about trump in moscow. With his infirmities he's likely to fall out of a window.
In what is becoming more painful aware by the second as I watch 3 former Presidents speak- “What the fuck are we doing with this clown called Trump?”

They can try setting the table for #trump, but Nancy Pelosi is still Speaker of the #PeoplesHouse. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Trump isn’t so much worried about losing than what happens to him when he loses. He is afraid of jail and rightfully so.  Also members of the family and those who use the “just taking orders” defense should be worried too.
It's going to sting this fake news broke paper like the st pete times when President Trump wins.
The Chart shows black employment, not GDP. As a measure of economic growth, I agree that Trump’s growth is good. However, the conversation. The real median and per capita GDP of the black community has flatlined under this administration.
There WAS a superspreader in TULSA...  THE 8 Trump CAMPAIGN workers cited in most articles Tested positive... Well before the rally  And OK GOV says he thinks He Contracted before the rally As well but would have been pre contagious AT THE RALLY  SOUNDS like a known source
It would take congress (both houses) passing legislation to delay the election. It’d take a constitutional amendment to keep Trump in office past noon EST 1/20/2021

Hope Trump had jam in his pocket because he's toasted with that kind of news
Well said Steve. I hope the Trump base can be open minded enough to see what's happening in this country. I've been "not so nice" with regards to Trumpers, but I sincerely hope they can absorb the current state of this country and make better choices.
Herman Cain will be missed...  If he caught coronavirus AT A rally Will most probably be impossible to prove or disprove forever...  But WE WILL always remember that At the rally...he was telling Americans we cannot be immobilized by FEAR... AND  Continue to be FREE AMERICANS ❤

When you all get off the Trump tit then I’ll follow you again as I agree with a lot of your points.   But I will not caucus with fascists and racists who cannot and will not deliver the reforms needed to fix this issue.
That's a lie. Biden has committed to 3 debates. Also, tRump stumbles every time he speaks in public. His grammar is atrocious. You must not pay too much attention to him when he speaks.
That's *exactly* what Trump is doing.  Remember: for 3.5 years, he has explicitly undone, overridden, struck down, and otherwise destroyed much of what Obama worked on, created, and built. He's not done yet.
Actually, I do not. Flatlining numbers show stagnation. Trump could not continue the growth and the proof is in the numbers. If you look at them.
The tweet from President Trump, who's trailing in nearly every national poll for the Nov. 3 election, came on the same morning as the U.S. reported an economic contraction of 9.5 percent in the second quarter of 2020, an unprecedented recession.
They told me there would not be math, but is that rate Lower or higher than the number of tRump appointees who have broken the Hatch Act or have been indicted

To bad trump is complicit in his death
I am sorry for the loss of your friend &amp; former boss. I mean that. I'm also sad for Mr. Cain's family. I know that grief too well. It hurts. I'd never say anyone deserved to contract a disease &amp; die. I *will* say I wish he, &amp; many others, had listened to science instead of Trump.

It's in the Constitution that Trump can't accept foreign emoluments - like he does every minute of every day.  It's in the Constitution that the People have the right to peacefully protest - and Trump violates that right daily.  Marco &amp; every Republican will back Trump. Be afraid
Trump has accomplished exactly what he was hoping for by starting an argument about the credibility of the the election. *Because he’s losing - if he was ahead in the polls it would be full steam ahead. #Election2020

I just gave it to you...his own sons admitted they have gotten millions in loans from the Russians. Trump himself has talked up Putin for years now.
Racial propaganda from that video clip would make me think the black population in MT rose by 5000% overnight. The same b.s. Trump did against Biden with the old lady on a 4 hour hold with 911 while her house was being broken into. Tap into white fear. Smh.

“He asked for the election to be delayed?” DeSantis asked.
Trump's tweet came on the same day the economy was reported to have shrunken 9.5 percent in the second quarter.
It's not "a political statement" to point to objective, provable truths:  ✅FACT: Cain died of COVID ✅FACT: &amp; was at the crowded Tulsa rally ✅FACT: he denounced masks &amp; other safety recommendations ✅ FACT: Trump mocked distancing guides &amp; minimal precautions &amp; had them removed
Im okay with Trump but delaying the election is not necessary
It was an SNL skit...funny when they do them about Trump they don't laugh and get butthurt.
Get a trump toe tag at every rally

Does anyone really care what Trump has to say today?  We already know whatever he says will be either a lie or nonsensical drivel.  Please, press, do not repeat every asinine word he utters.  Give the public a break! Report real news and not his idiotic ramblings.
When President Trump is re-elected it will be a lessen to some and a not others. Strength, alpha male, height and charisma over ride billions of dollars of  swamp money and snowflake feelings.
President Trump is a boss.
My two cents: The point of Trump's tweet is not to actually delay the election, but merely another in a relentless series of attacks to suggest the potential results will be illegitimate.
I watched the tech hearings, found it interesting. The main reason its not getting more publicity is because of the timing. 2020 there are so many issues/big stories in America now. From what’s going on in Portland to COVID-19 to as usual Trump etc. In 2019 it get more coverage.
“Trump is priming those in his camp to doubt the legitimacy of whatever outcome emerges in the first weeks of November.” #covid19 #coronavirus
Trump is going to have a stellar post presidency career hawking reverse mortgages on daytime TV.
I still can’t get over how G.W. Bush’s legacy gets a “do over” because he’s not “as bad” as Trump.  That’s how low the bar is now...  He’s gonna give Michelle Obama a mint in a few minutes and everyone’s gonna swoon and say, “Did you see that?” “Bush gave Michelle a mint!”
tRump is incapable of sorrow or empathy. What made him such an empty shell of a human?
As in MAYBE Trump Cant fire them  But by executive order he can reduce their salaries to  VOLUNTARY 0$$$  AND establish rotation of assignments... To reduce POLITICAL influence over any given Division of an agency

he had a choice: wear a gd mask and stay away from crowds not wearing them; you know, like at a trump rally.
The day trump came down his escalator to announce his candidacy
May he Rest In Peace &amp; prayers for his family. So tragic that Trump pushes false narratives that cause people to die.

What a jackass Pardon my FRENCH  You still get your politics from the comedy shows?  Still THINK they are the last bastion Of apolitical thought?  1 is FEDERAL BUILDINGS a common target of the left and right Other is PUBLIC LAND are COWS really SUBVERSIVE?
What do you mean why? Don’t you see what the Democrat party is doing? Republicans under Trump became Democrats/socialist while the Democrats are now full blown communists. But then again in school they teach communism is good so good luck out there.
Extremely online pundits: Hey look this is a master chess move by Trump to distract you from the GDP numbers  Because we all know Independents which backed Trump and are now a group he's very unpopular with will get behind the sitting President talking up delaying an election
"For those of us who follow politics closely, my admonition is: Pay a lot of attention to those voters who don't pay much attention at all. They may be telling us something very important."
Again more Democrat sassiness in the face to dictatorship: the rolls being like "Trump says he could delay the election, BUT ACTUALLY HE CAN'T !"   What on earth makes you think he can't? It's illegal? Dude has Gestapo kidnapping folks off the street with impunity. :(
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  No. I'm not a white supremacist posing as #ANTIFA. But it's time to go to work so I can pay taxes that support all the Socialist services that #Trump's government currently provides you. Now say thank you.

It will be sort of entertaining to see the same folks who obeyed his order to lock kids in cages and throw protesters in vans drag Trump out of the Oval Office. He forgets they're not on his side, or anyone's side. They just do whatever the person who wins says.

You can also buy Trump toilet paper from multiple vendors on Amazon for a few dollars a role. This provides hours of entertainment. Is useful unlike Trumpty Dumpty and its so much more intimate and satisfying then wasting moneyon Dons death cult photo ops.

Right back at you never trumpers. As I said you add nothing to the conversation. Hate Trump run someone better. You are 0 for the last 3.

Sure. Highest marks for a first term President, ever. Followed by a once in a century pandemic caused by China who Trump has warned us for over 40 years.  Good thinking there, Professor.

Doesn't mean it was that drug that helped her...but hey you keep letting Trump shove that crap down your throat because he won't admit he was wrong and you all defend his stupidity. Btw just because his dead uncle went to MIT doesn't make him smart too.
What's going to be really embarrassing when election day shows the rest of the world that 43% of the nation is racist enough to support Trump. Why would any tourist want to visit the US even if Trump loses, especially the way he has racists attacking people openly?

Trump will say anything at this point, completely unbelievable
If you see Trump in 20 years, that's means you went to hell
With #TrumpCrimeFamily in prison there will be great #lowincomehousing available in former #Trump properties.
Trump is desperately trying to give his own children the wealth his father left him and it is driving him insane. Period.  Full stop.
This next election is going to show the rest of the world precisely how many Americans are that racist and it is going to be pretty embarrassing when it comes in at 43%. Why would anyone want to come here? Especially when Trump has them attacking people for no reason.

That's ignoring many of his supporters, who if Trump told them pigs could fly , would go outside and look up. If Biden wins there will be never ending accusations of a fraudulent election
Trump has been a pressure valve for an understandably frustrated and angry silent majority.  Remove him from office and be prepared for what comes next....BOOM!

Prove that mail in voting is fraudulent. It is not! And as you should know trump mails his ballots in.

As a diversion to the Trump tanked economy...
No wonder Trump’s going crazy this morning. 👇From the NYTs...
He made the decision to attend that rally, knowing  that he was part of the high risk population.  As much as I despise Trump, this is on Herman Cain
Does that make you feel better? Does the fact Cain previously had colon cancer allow you to intellectually absolve Trump and his rally of any responsibility? Is a life lost due to coronavirus less significant if they previously had cancer?
Oh well didn’t Trump have him sign the waiver for not wearing a mask? 🤷🏼‍♂️ so the administration is safe McEnemy. No worries
No, actually it refutes your Trump defense and media criticism that it is paranoia.

A November win for Trump.
What I witnessed was a surgical act played out by Trumps Team. So when asked how Trumps Team can be so easily controlled is that Trumo Team has been put out fake information. Thats why Trump calls real media fake news.  He is projecting like he always will. But it is amazing 👏.
But it turns hard left. Talks about BLM movement is about Democrat taken over the Country. Its done in a subtle way. Week later , I hear a Republican Senator talk about the far left. Then the crazy Demon set Doctor is on all media. Then yes Trump backs it.
This video was sent to me. Its from an friend that I worked with. It was sent after I posted what's was happening to Americans in Portland. That said he believes in Trump. This video at 1st was about how Trump will use his Storm Troops.

😂😂😂😂😂😂 Trump saves Portland. 😂😂😂😂😂 It’s amazing what the powers of a President and the feds can do...4 months before an election
Money out of politics probably the only way that happens.  Too much money to be made through war. It is literally choking our country to death.  Trump is completely unpredictable on foreign policy. That's why the state dept. hates him.
One thing above any other republican and democratic bipartisanship is war and more war and more money for war. There is no longer an anti war party. Trump is a lunatic with no ideology so once in awhile he will accidentally tell the truth about war.

Bone spurs should be blamed for the Trump virus .He I ignored it for months and has the blood of 140,000 Americans on his hands. As a “leader” he has Barr attack peace full protesters or a photo op. His solution to all our issues is to use tax payer money to golf and ignore us
Having to read about demon sperm while having 150,000 dead Americans is actually worse than I thought Trump’s presidency would be- and I knew it would be a total disaster.

When I read the comments on Trump's tweets I continue to be dismayed by the level of ignorance in Merica.  I should have acclimated by now.
Just wow . It's an effort by the right to make the Real story a hoax.  It's the White House new strategy  That's why Trump is now pushing  that narrative.
I don't know why l wrote that this is going to be President TRUMP'S LAST TERM IN OFFICE. It just came out. I am not always right.
Who was the guy who served before trump because for some reason I can’t remember I bet it’s cause he didn’t do anything good for us but that could just be me forgetting

😂they did not even let him talk good job Demtards look even more like fools after today . Don’t matter  THUMP 2020
They are all so damn racist. Damn. 😡
Terrible pieces of crap. They gave Trump plenty of campaign video footage in their “hearing”
Do you think if Trump were forced to take the citizenship test, he would fail? I could make a wager now saying he doesn't even get a 25/100. He probably couldn't even list all our founding fathers to save his life!
It’s all scripted.  He’s picking the reporters of a piece of paper.  Good luck debating Trump!  Biden’s team is going to do everything they can to get out of it.

I was for 3 months before election. Lasted 3 months later, most of that was by phone because it became so contentious. My final statement to him was tRump could enter your house, crap in your sink, you would find a reason for him doing that plus think it was the best thing ever
Right--he, like Trump, never lies, never does anything wrong, and is not partisan at all in his duties. I see you all are fine giving up 1st Amendment rights cos it's the Left getting gassed, beaten, assaulted while unarmed and peaceably protesting. Got it.
When you talk about people you don’t put them all in one bunch I define a magat as a magat a fool that does as trump says and republicans are not all magats

I didn't see the Donald Trump Jr video, but if it did in fact contain misinformation about COVID, then his account got what it deserved.
My apologies! Yes, we need more testing. The CDC fell into disarray over the past 20 years, and Trump has finished the job, making them write guidelines according to his political whims.
Don’t you think Trump has hired people to deface BLACK LIVES MATTER? We do know he is a complete racist.
Right--you voted for NO Evidence, NO witnesses. You put Trump over country. Shame on you.

on responding to COVID: Up to the states to respond.  Also Trump on protests: Damn graffiti.  Send the troops &amp; mercenaries in NOW! Can't leave it to the locals.
To defeat Trump plan you move the protest away from the Fed Bldg. Go to a park. Trump army will follow the protesters  and show their hand. Or his army will stay and look stupid. Take away their reason for being there. Use this tactic for the next 99 days.
Yeah  It's "almost" haha like the DNC is purposely ignoring the millions of people screaming for real change.  These Veep picks...wtf  And Their down votes on #MedicareForAll probably just gave trump 4 more years.  Oh well... There's always Portugal... Or Costa Rica  😔
Trump is setting the stage to cancel the elections. Needs about 3-5 more cities to show protestors against his army. Will call martial law. Postpone the elections. More protest and more confrontations arise. But he will still be President. Take it to the courts? Tie it up 4 years
It's "almost" haha like the DNC is purposely ignoring the millions of people screaming for real change.  Their down votes on #MedicareForAll probably just gave trump 4 more years.  Oh well... There's always Portugal... Or Costa Rica  😔

Too bad the CDC has been neutered and can not evaluate the drug. In any case, this is a diversion from Trump gaslighting a pandemic with catastrophic results.

Why is there always something going on (Funeral) in Washington, DC. when member (Barr) of President Trump’s Administration testifies? Today, John Lewis’ Funeral continues &amp; William Barr testifies. — Deep State is OUT OF CONTROL/their MINDS!!!!! Media doesn’t tell you Barr is …
I’m still pissed that Joe Biden had the audacity to say that Trump is the first racist president. Just so he knows, if any of us vote for him it’s because we we loathe Donald Trump but we have our eyes on him. 🤦🏾‍♀️
The long term economic effect of Trump’s first term? A new record - the lowest value ever of the $ by counterfeit printing. A new record in yearly debt, borrowing from people not old enough to vote to dole out to cronies with a cookie to fool the sheeple. Destruction of the $.
#ImpeachBarrNOW I know it would take longer to impeach him than to wait out the last few months but Barr needs to face consequences for lying and covering up for Trump!
Good Morning. I’m perplexed, how are you not reporting on the riots happening across the country? I just spent 30 minutes watching your 6am segment and the only story that resembled any of the riots was a story blaming Trump for using tear gas on June 1st.Please tell us the news!

He actually may use that one..most likely they will blame President Trump
F!!!!!! Twitter trump 2020
Have you ever stopped to think that’s what trump has you doing?
This guy is being dragged to more places than John McCain was. Lewis voiced hatred for Donald Trump when he was alive, so paying respects to him would be hypocritical. Good call, Mr. President.
IF he said real slanderous things, Trump would sue him.  Did not happen. He said he would sue the 26 women who say he sexually assaulted them. Never happened. Anyway, when a book like that comes out, it gets debunked piece by piece. I've seen none of that.
One thing people say about Bolton is he does not lie. I've seen nothing in his book proved wrong, have you? Do you think Trump would not have said that?
Trump said the concentration camps were ok!
We've been saying it for a while now, this is just irresponsible. We're still waiting to hear from  if he thinks  plan is still working. #FL18 #FlaPol
Listen Up Everyone WE ARE BEING Duped by the so called “Medical Community”. The  only thing that matters to them is to beat Trump because OUR LIVES DON’T MATTER.
It is true and I heard it come from the Holy Spirit one month ago. It’s sad that they dispelled it to hurt Trump.
There's meanness and extremist on both sides. You would think we would be further along though. We have the access to education and technology, we should not be where we are. Trump and the Republican party should not have been able to do so much damage in such a short time.

You're believing trups rhetoric,  you poor lemming.  NONE OF THIS IS TRUE.  All the pieces of trump's ads are taken from other time periods that have NOTHING to do with that ad.  I feel bad for you actually believing what BUNKER BOY says.
I have morals and unlike you I choose a leader with morals and do not follow one specially one as amoral and one that lies so much like trump, a sheep is you sir that follows him blindly I on the other side am able to see and choose and will criticize when warranted

#1) Here the point: Trump Administration has been pushing Germany to stop building new multi-billion $ OIL &amp; GAS pipeline infrastructure into Russia.  Russia already uses it energy resources to Bully all EU neighbors (that we protect) and Germany is helping them by undercut USA.

Good on you, Matt. Seen too many people on here gloating about his death because he attended a Trump rally.
Is this a trump election tweet a deflection for crossing the 150,000 covid-19 deaths? For yesterdays AG embarrassment? Is Maxwell going to name trump as a pedophile? Stay tuned...
THIS IS TOTAL BULLSHIT. THIS GUY IS A BULLY HE KNOW HE IS GOING TO LOSE. MR. TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE RUSSIA TO HELP HIM. If we had GENERAL ELECTION NEXT TUESDAY Mr. Trump would lose everything.
She was “right there with him”. So she’s sorta kinda admitting that the reason ol’ Herm is dead is because he attended a Trump Rally, no social distancing, no mask. Hmmm...  #TrumpIsKillingUs
Any idea which news item Trump is trying to obscure with the stupid bullshit about election delays?  1. 32.9% economic contraction  2. Swann interview on Russian bounties 3. John Lewis funeral  My guess is the funeral. He views his absence as a slight, and the attendees a threat.
Shocking. Sobering. Is that what President Trump meant by American carnage?
Based on his post-Trump verbal diarrhea, I have serious doubts about how sincerely "pro-life" French is or has been. I suspect he saw it merely as another opportunity to grift, as so many of his NT pals have demonstrated how they saw it.
Delay of the election is the only way for sure, 100%, that Donald Trump isn’t President past 1/20/2021. He’s bluffing. I call.

Good grief Andrew... we will still have 24,000+ military personnel in Germany.  Why must we continue to keep a 40,000 troop presence in Germany?  Poland is building a first class military base for the USA and Trump wants to expand our presence there.

I put up articles about this last week.  They insinuated trump had pushed his hotel in DC and the FBI bldg all along since his administration began.  It has been in the news over the years many times.  And he was told to knock off the crap by investigators.  But here it is again!
trump halted briefings after he told people to inject bleach and put a light inside their bodies to stop covid.  Now he is promoting alien DNA, incubus and succubus, don't wear a mask, there is a cure, demon sperm, sex with demons lady.  Why did the R Senate conspire to keep him?
I think they have said that, several times, loud and clear.  They want every single trump enabler gone.    That is their mission and they are proud of it.
Focus on the Russian bounties. Make trump defend his position. Do not let him deflect.
The “Knight” is right! Electing Biden to replace Trump is a political farce. We’ll wake up the very next morning like Murray in “Groundhog Day”. Many who voted for Trump, did it out of frustration and to flip the bird to the Washingtonian Oligarchs and their apparatchik.

Those comments are inappropriate &amp; totally unnecessary at this time. Whatever your opinions about Trump or political disagreements with him were, this is NOT the time to talk about him repenting before his tragic passing. God bless the Cain family, friends, etc...
Donald Trump Is Terrified of Voters | The New Republic
Looks like Trump thinks all voters in Florida and Michigan and other states are all Democrats. He appears to be shooting himself in the foot. Republicans vote by mail too...right.
that's the trump youth troops following hitler
Do you think they purposefully ignore actual degenerates so they can claim Trump’s base are horrible people overall and people will believe it?
The Donald Trump Presidency.
Juan Williams saying Trump is a sore loser is amazing considering he’s 1-0 in elections so literally he has never lost.
Yesterday trump was trying to scare people from black and brown people who could possibly move into their neighborhoods and lower their house prices, today he wanted to postpone the election and this is your message?
Greatings brothers, would it be too much to ask for a min of you time or a reshare ?
I rarely, if ever, swear in public, Twitter or Facebook. But I find myself swearing at the TV when GOP goons like Gym Jordan, Doug Collins, Mnuchin, Nunes, and, of course, their Idiot-in-Chief Trump open their mouths. No one else makes my blood boil as much as they do. 😖 😡
In totally agree. Would it be too much to ask a ally for a minute to assist our a black radio show host?
Mad King Trump has finally latched onto an issue that his #MAGA base is sure to rally around: No election.
What more does McConnell want out of trump, he could make trump resign tomorrow and run with pence and haley, but this is the party of trump...they are all trump now.
THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT DROPPED 32.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER. tRump doesn't want you to know this. That's why he floated the idea of delaying the election. DISTRACTION!! Whatever you do, DO NOT RETWEET THIS!
Busy watch PRESIDENT OBAMA. NO TIME 4 Trump’s BS. #TrumpIsALoser
You honestly believe there is no possibility of voter fraud with millions of ballots floating around?   What if GOP wins, are you still going to take that position?  Is this exactly why Trump is making these statements? To take away Left arguments of “fraud” once he wins?  🤭🤔🧐
I have sleep issues, but they're more likely caused by my spending too much time on Twitter rather than worrying about the pandemic! 😳 🙄 And my addiction to Twitter is totally the result of following the resistance to Trump's disastrous administration. 😡
Lewis showed nothing but contempt for President Trump, why should he bother?
So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you’re proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain’s death was a result of YOUR negligence.
I don't think so loll trump is done
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! 😎
I sense desperation in the air....your years as an enabler to Donald Trump are costing you.
Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today’s eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Your right it’s just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Obama’s eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
Thanks to Trump and his corrupt leadership for our country going through this terrible epidemic Virus! All Trump cares about is his real estate and his selfish needs to be against the Medical professionals that we have to unite as a country to get this Virus out! Trump👎🤥
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
Very disappointing to have Trump I hope he is finally getting out and we can get our Country back to the people first!
WOW! what a service #JohnLewisMemorial . What I am curious to know is why Trump was not at the services? As a leader of this country he should have been there.
See Trump is corrupt and hateful going against our Constitution! Protesters have legal rights they were not doing anything wrong but protesting against something the Trump Dictator didn’t agree with equal rights BLM👎🤥
trump has no friends only uses people, name one true friend he has?
And Trump has the audacity to offer condolences to Mr. Cain's grieving family without taking responsibility for hosting a senseless rally during a global pandemic.
is he saluting Hitler or Trump
Makes you wonder what President Trump is actually up to doesn’t it? I trust
And nobody knew it until “Professor” Trump told us.

Trump has mishandled crises, 150,000 of our fellow Americans are dead, we continue to grapple with systematic racism &amp; we have a careless BIGOT who could not care less if things got worse because he’s making them worse. Let us listen to Obama and VOTE!!!! VOTE EVERY ENABLER OUT!
Here's when it will really be fun: When an intrepid reporter asks Mad King Trump, "So, what did you think of President Obama's remarks at John Lewis' funeral?"
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally. No mask. No social distancing. Very likely contracted COVID by foolishly following you...Blood on your hand!!!
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
Did anyone put a clock on how long it took Mad King Trump to mention John Lewis after his death?
Given the way he's running his campaign, you have to wonder:  What does the President have on Donald J. Trump?
Donald Trump.
You have to keep in mind that Trump's biggest supporters are Nazis &amp; white supremacists.  These people love his racism.  He's one of them.  Has anyone ever checked his closet for his white hood &amp; robe?
No it’s in the constitution that both houses must approve it first.  The spanish flu was worse more deaths it didn’t get postponed. Trump definitely cannot do it.
BOOM!!!
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it
No. It’s really bad. Like Stephanie Meyers wrote 2020. Like trump is the emotional immature Edward and we are all Bella.
What I would expect on  tonight. Top story will be a live report from the NY pizza restaurant that trump tweeted out. In the 57th minute, there will be a snippet of video of Obama, Bush and Clinton speaking at John Lewis service
Even if delayed, Trump still leaves office at noon on January 20th, 2021. Absolutely nothing changes that.
Trump could never give a speech/eulogy because he can't talk about anyone but himself.  I love and miss Obama so much!!
Ask him if he knew this please National Debt Has Increased $5.2 Trillion During Trump's 3 Years as President
National Debt Has Increased $5.2 Trillion During Trump's 3 Years as President
Parts of President Obama's John Lewis eulogy will be played on a loop.  Mad King Trump's going to go berserk.
No one cares about Mad King Trump and he's going to whine about that all over again the next chance he gets.  The spotlight needs to be on him every minute.
No one there wanted trump to say a damn thing.
Donald Trump will NEVER upstage President Barack Hussein Obama!

Everyone is saying trump can’t postpone the November elections.  Trust me. He will find a way. He probably already has. Hence the tweet.  I myself find it scary at how very right about trump I’ve been.  He needs to be removed from office NOW. #RemoveTrumpNow
No offense, but he brought this on himself. Basically trump killed him along w/well over 150,000 other Americans. Or do the others not count? You never seem to mention them.
McLaughlin also believes that Trump asking for something that will never happen only makes him look “weak.”  “It is also a glaring statement of no-confidence in his own ability to compete in the election,” he writes.

Why? He knew the facts yet ignored them. He was a cancer survivor so he knew he was compromised. His support of Trump was more important than his or his family's health...
If it is postponed, there will be an immediate cure for COVID-19! The msm will start focusing on the delayed elections and attack Trump.

So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
For real? I didn’t know that... wow. Rudy... you should be ashatof yourself. Like trump loves to say “that is nasty”. Lmao. 🤮
He’s the head of the Federalist society and just now says that trump is a fascist?  Wait. Haven’t we known that for three years?  The tweet this more all of a sudden turned him. Pfft.

It’s crazy ironic... #Trump has been obsessing about a wall on the #Mexico border forever (ya know, to keep “them” out).  Now, due to the way the #Trump admin has handled #covid19... Mexico is literally one of the only countries in the world allowing Americans to visit!!

Experts dismiss Trump claim that it could take 'years' to declare election winner
Every traditional Republican understands that mail in / absentee voting is a Republican strong point.    But trump  was  a Democrat all his life, so of course he does not understand that.
Well, I’m glad you are coming around... please &amp; always, vote... Voting by mail has been done for a long long time and has less than .002% of fraud—the only reason Trump doesn’t want vote by mail is because if people vote, he loses!

He passed away from the Trump Virus. After the first 5K deaths Trumps owns the virus and every victim's thereafter, including Herman Cain passing.
It’s because those reporters were chosen to ask those questions. Anyone with balls enough to ask about putin bounties or trump’s epic failure on c19 might receive an angry tweet or lose access. Oh the horror.
Don’t you think he was tested before he was allowed so close to Trump? Herman Cain is tragedy but it’s about individual choices.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.
Herman Cain did not believe in wearing a mask, Trump did believe in wearing a mask.  Wearing a mask protects you from getting the virus, not completely but it help's tremendously.  He died because of the virus and supporting Trump's belief's #TrumpKillsAmericans
Of course he is. Trump is going to undermine the results and declare himself the winner. Welcome to authoritarian rule! Democracy and the USA is finished.

Too late, he sat by and did nothing while Trump betrayed his oath, our country and allies.
Remember over the spring many “primaries” got delayed/changed to accomodate the shut down. State govs may be inclined to change election dates/mail by dates in an effort to “accomodate” (ie: round up) voters.   Trump knows whatever he proposes Dems will be against. HydroxyC, etc.

For what it’s worth I think you’re doing a fabulous job!  Especially with all the BULLSHIT they constantly try and drag you down with!  🇺🇸 TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸 MAGA 🇺🇸
Trump can't pronounce plasma, release my taxes, emoluments, Deutsche Bank, faithful, truth, I love my wife or Russian bounties on US soldiers. 🙄
Good thing Herman Caine knew the Lord and is in the presence of a Holy God. Herman was a grown man. Since he had cancer he knew the risk&amp; made his own mind. So don’t blame Trump.
Remember Republicans were the ones who fought against every election integrity bill! Follow their money to Diabold who makes the voting machines. It all comes together as to WHY they are so terrified with mail in voting.they need to cheat to win. FUCK TRUMP
Again, it’s trump saying something without doing something. Bark vs bite. Amazing people haven’t figured that out yet. Everyone calm down.
Police brutality , That IS criminal activity.  tRump abuses his power, THAT is criminal activity.  Stone lies in court, THAT is criminal activity.  Cohen goes to jail for commiting crimes on individual 1, yet individual 1 walks, THAT is criminal activity, and the list. Now STFU.
Trump can't pronounce basic words like plasma 🙄 "plausma" 🤦🏻‍♀️
No more than Trump is on his knees servicing your buddy Putin.
His briefing is nauseating.  I want to throw bricks at the tv for his utterly outrageous claims of voter fraud.  Suggestion:  Since according to him an "absentee ballot" is fine, everyone needs to request one so he'll shut up.
When I see #Apple news! lol Has anyone taken a bigger kick to the financial groin than #Apple for Trump confronting China.

Actually Trump is the embarrassment but it also shows you he’s running scared🤣🤣🤣
#SpecialReport Absolutely President Trump, open the schools!
Donny Trump is off the rails today.
Trump is setting up to nullify the November 3 Election. He’s saying it might take months and years before we find out who won. Folks, we need to hit the streets as soon as possible.
Trump does not deny that he wants to delay the election in November.
Trump bought the Miss America contest for access to young girls. And he’s clearly out of his mind.  And you’re a hypocrite and a fool.
I said memorializing not memorizing. But the whatabout trump supporters don’t read
#TheFive Good idea President Trump, if school stays closed, send parents the money so they can send their kids, to an open school!
Psst.....Trump wanted to leave Syria
Watching his propaganda news briefing, Trump said that things in Florida is getting better. Yesterday some 264 died and today, we’ll over 250 from COVID-19. How can he lie and the Fox crowd blelieves him. They are complecit in his crimes.
Trump is high and clueless as to what McConnell has not done. He sat on this bill since MAY
#TheFive Yes President Trump,  we need kids back in school!!!
...and plus Dems bill sat on McConnell's desk since MAY! Trump is high!
What’s up with Trump’s face?  Did he forget to put on his makeup?
Let him try. Maybe It’ll keep him busy while the clock keeps ticking. Plus it’ll keep him distracted from future Trump distractions. And they’re coming.
It's the trump virus
LIVE: President Donald Trump is holding a COVID-19 briefing at the White House.
I’m doing mail in voting. So suck it Trump
Donald Trump demonstrates zero leadership. Please do something about Russia placing a bounty on US soldiers. #PenceLies
You obviously haven’t seen how trump deals with this kind of thing. He will not acknowledge his death. If he does, he will blame it on protesters in ATL..

Trump Takes A Victory Lap Over Alarm Sparked By His Push To Postpone Election Day
Looks like Trump thinks all voters in Florida and Michigan and other states are all Democrats. He appears to be shooting himself in the foot. Republicans vote by mail too...right.
I do like Republicans at least most of them but... wow Trump supporters are literally a bunch of cult members who can't think for themselves. Pure sheep. This isn't even a D vs R thing it's literally common sense vs ignorance.
that's the trump youth troops following hitler

You must have the worst fucking logic ever... shame on those blaming Trump's TULSA rally? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 You must be missing a lot of facts and pictures because Herman Cain should have not went to that rally. But he believed Trump's words and died from stupidity. Plain and simple.
have to second this...  i probably see 20 or 25 trump stickers/yard signs/etc for every biden one... but i hardly see any biden ones, if that makes sense...

Sorry, that makes no sense whatsoever. People die in pandemics, and b I'm sorry fur your loss. However, while Obama acted decisively to fight against H1N1, Trump has done the exact opposite. He has countered and maligned the very people he should have been listening to along.
One of my followers made a good point.  Trump was impeached, doesn’t that make it illegal to be re-elected?  Even if only the House impeached him it still stands. HE SHOULD NOT BE ON THE BALLO

Why would Project Veritas put out a video critical of Trump?
Trump is such a child. President Bush gave a eulogy at John Lewis‘s funeral even though John Lewis didn’t go to Bush’s inauguration because of the Al Gore/BUSCH recount election. Trump didn’t even pay respects to Lewis when he was lying in state in the Capitol. Not presidential.
#BidenPredictedTrumpDelayElection. Trump demands election be delayed.
4 years ago :
Well almost 4 years in , we know Donald J Trump is not an elected official ! he was placed in office by the Russians. #DonaldTrumpIsIllegitimate
Bottom line: the N.R.A. laundered Russian money into the 2016 campaign and illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign. The N.R.A. needs to have its tax-exempt status stripped. Our documentary details all of this. But we need help to get the doc out.
Trump doesn’t care if more of his voters vote by mail. Trump doesn’t care if vote by mail is popular. The best opportunity Republicans have to suppress the vote is by reducing the number of urban voting sites where voters can vote. That’s the plan!
Delivery guy: “no tip?”  Me: “don’t vote for trump!”
First of all, Pomeo’s smirk aside, he’s clearly not in in “the joke”, secondly, didn’t Trump tell us recently he “doesn’t kid”?
Analysis | Trump’s Four-Pinocchio interview on Russian bounties By Salvador Rizzo
Trump may not be eloquent by anyone’s standards, but he is a prodigious liar.
This pathetic b/c you killed him!  Trump mourns 'American Patriot, and great friend' Herman Cain
We didn’t deserve this type of health, economic, and political climate that Trump carelessly and recklessly led us to. If he is smart he’ll step down. I hear Roger Stone has room for another tattoo on his back.  Trump can end up as a tattoo on Stones back, if not it’ll be worse!
Trump should say that breathing air is good so the dems stop
Charlie, all Trump does is lie, and self-aggrandize, and talk like the fascist he is.
, my pleasure. President Trump must be reelected!
All of those points he Trump wants to but the Dems won’t let him
Republicans against Trump
Did you say ballot harvesting?
Republican Voters against Trump. I believe she’s in Ohio.
History will remember Donald Trump in one way and one way only: as an accessory to the murder of tens of thousands of Americans. And amazing legacy
I don't think so loll trump is done
I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Your right it’s just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.
. is a partisan hack. And a Trump-sucking sycophant. And an asshole.
Thanks to Trump and his corrupt leadership for our country going through this terrible epidemic Virus! All Trump cares about is his real estate and his selfish needs to be against the Medical professionals that we have to unite as a country to get this Virus out! Trump👎🤥
Call me crazy, but i think this is Trump coded speak for "dont worry i will keep POC out of your neighborhood."
That would be a lie. Trump IS a full blown racist.
Why not flip flop it would extend your demise. If you support trump you’re a racist.
What’s shocking is just the utter disrespect. I mean, Trump flat out told reporters “no” he wouldn’t be going to pay respects to John Lewis.
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
“Trump Moves To Delay The Presidential Election Until He’s Not Losing” by Eric J Scholl

Completely agree. But theres that filibuster rule, etc, plus each member of the senate would have to give a little speach abt why Trump is evil, etc.   Maybe they could do it faster. Obvi, it would be priority #1. Trump would be on lockdown!!  Lol

yo Brent I found your girl.
I just asked was he a hateful person, I looked up the word in the dictionary first but I wondered why John Lewis was viewed as hateful. So I asked about Trump to see how someone could say John was hateful but Trump wasn't. Its not that complicated.
We must stop trump and his enablers.  Their incompetence has set our country back decades!
Very disappointing to have Trump I hope he is finally getting out and we can get our Country back to the people first!
DeSatan hitched his future to the wrong wagon.  He, the Tea Party faction of the GOP, and Trump are finished. Their ineptitude to govern, their refusal to listen to scientific experts have relegat3dmthem to history’s garbage heap.
It is! Stage one was COVID19- China virus. Remember Chinese government officials net wit President Trump's administration and President Trump, before we even found out about Coronavurus.

Never

Diane: Don't blame innocent 2020. It was as shocked as we are. You can blame it on Trump. Why not? He did everything else wrong, why not this? Although todays earthquake didn't do any damage and turn to shit as everything else he touches!
Trump’s becoming a pariah. The way his kind should be treated....instead of allowed to be President.
No joke, Trump is getting off on this - the moment he realized he could tweet praise for a different black guy who just died on the same day he planned on blowing off respect for John Lewis, I’m sure a big smug grin crossed his face and he dove for his phone.

RIP to #HermanCain who died from COVID after attending a Trump rally without a mask. Not intending this as a “gotcha” at all, but a plea to anti-maskers to maybe reconsider the whole mask thing.
See Trump is corrupt and hateful going against our Constitution! Protesters have legal rights they were not doing anything wrong but protesting against something the Trump Dictator didn’t agree with equal rights BLM👎🤥
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?
Clown 🤡 😂😂😂Trump Drive nuts 😂😂😂😂😂
trump has no friends only uses people, name one true friend he has?
is he saluting Hitler or Trump
Hey Palmer, maybe you could help me with this question... at the end of August 2016 Hillary was leading Trump in almost every major poll and we all know what happened at the end... how can we be sure that’s not going to happen again?
Parents aren’t going to send their children to slaughter for you and who you pray to (Trump). You decided to listen to the lies about the virus 🦠 from Trump and his enablers. You reap what you sow. You are following the Herman Cain path.
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.
He’s a fraud plain and simple.....Can’t believe Trump keeps him
How the hell does Trump keep this fraud?..very discouraging
Trump and GOP running up $3.7 trillion deficit this year.
TRUMP HAS NO AUTHORITY TO MOVE THE DATE OF THE ELECTION. HIS GORDY DECORATIONS AND HIS BELONGINGS WILL BE OUT OF THE PEOPLES HOUSE BY 11:30 ON JANUARY 20TH. I HEARD PUTIN ORDERED A PLANE TO PICK HIS UGLY SHIT UP. HE CAN DECORATE THE KREMLIN WITH HIS UGLY BULLSHIT FUCK HIM &amp; PUTIN
Today Trump suggested delaying the election. Obama was reinforcing John Lewis' belief "When you see something that is not right, you must do something," "Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part."
And Trump voters are conservative, so what does that make him? Your claim was specious and an attempt to discredit the original point, which is that by and large Republicans and far right groups are the biggest pushers re: reopening/masks are ineffective/covid conspiracies.
Them they criticize Trump at Rose Garden
Q: Did Herman Cain tweet that masks would not be required at Trump's controversial Tulsa rally? And was that tweet subsequently deleted?  A: Yes.
Trump is more afraid of early voting 🗳 then the actually Election Day🤔 but want worried about it in 2016 🤷🏾‍♀️
The more people who get sick, the more of an excuse Trump and Barr will have to try and postpone or suspend the election. Remember, has no bottom and will do anything to win. Cynical? Perhaps...
Onmy under President Trump's guidelines,  cutting red tape , in such short period of time Vaccine is in such advanced stages of Development
No Trump is
Well he could’ve been part of impeaching Trump but he’s spineless.
He died because of the Trump virus!!
As a Trump supporter how can you defend making voting harder.  You can want your guy to win, but ar what cost?!  What country do you live in if it totally ignores the value of voting?!
for the love of  can someone tell trump how to pronounce "plasma"  its not plausema
Biden down only 2 in a GOP poll in a district trump win by 17!
so I'm guessing trump wasn't at the funeral.....
Amazing how you and Cain and Trump and conservatives can say whatever they want, no matter how despicable, but God forbid someone criticizes a conservative, she is labeled hateful, no matter how valid the criticism. Look in the mirror.
And MBS as well, but I totally agree about Putin too. Trump is coddling all the foreign dictators &amp; tyrants from North Korea, to   Russia, to Saudi. Time to shut down Rizvi &amp; Milner. Don’t let these foreign tyrants buy up our social media. Down with fascism! #bringbackbetter
Thank you, Obama!! Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, takes aim at Trump over voting rights, protest response
He died from the Trump Virus. You neglected to write that.
Rest in peace Herman Cain. Hopefully others will learn from your misplaces trust in Trump.
Doesn't take nerve,nor are they unaware or unconcerned.....they are the lowest common denominators a.k.a. ignorant racist trump supporters
U act like Biden hasn’t said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
C’mon let’s be fair Trump knows 6 words : Person,Woman,Man,Camera,Tv and Bigly. In Trump’s world Bigly counts.
Is Trump a hateful person?
I’m keeping with my John Lewis groove. No Trump today.
Right, because when Lewis boycotted BOTH Bush's and Trump's inaugurationa he was working to bring people together?
I actually think the humiliating loss would lead to him not really returning to the job for those two months. His only agenda is “Trump.” He doesn’t care about what Mitch might want.   I think he’ll spend December stuffing money into suitcases and arranging to leave the USA.
To encourage them all to use the free filters provided to all Flint residents? Yeah I remember that. Man, I miss the days when that was the worst thing you could come up with against a president.   My turn:
Why didn't trump share his hydroxychloroquine with Herman Cain? He could have saved him.🤔
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now—you won’t get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone’s ideas before we vote.
No, Trump is a national disgrace. Trump has done nothing about Russia placing a bounty on US soldiers.... #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsANationalSecurityThreat
Under Trump and the GOP the federal deficit is $3.7 trillion. #GOPhypocrites
I believe it is a fact Trump is trying to undermine the election.
What do you call it when Trump suggests delaying the election? Fascism!!!
Obama makes Trump look like a damn fool.
Congress been asking for Trump taxes for 4 years. Nigga just said “nah, y’all can’t see that”. And nothing happened. He gonna do what he want with this election.
Yea and I’m sure the 8 Trump campaign staffers who contracted COVID shortly after the Tulsa Rally must’ve gotten it from somewhere else too. Regardless I guarantee that he and those around him did not wear masks or take the virus seriously which still makes it ironic and foolish
You are losing your hold on the Republican Party!!!  #sad #DementiaDon
I saw Barack Obama‘s eulogy for John Lewis and felt pride. I listen to President Trump every day and feel shame. What have we become?
Trump is quite literally killing his supporters. #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
If Trump want's to delay an election because it's too dangerous then children should not attend school until it is safe to do so.

Not if it’s that crazy lady that is touting hydroxycloraquin which is shown to do more harm than good for COVID. Trump has a stake in the company that produces is; a Saudi company based in Malta where patent law is non existent. Trump is trying his best to move America backwards!
It’s easy.  For trump Cain became another useless black man.
They call him “Rudy” and he used to be Trump’s lawyer before unfrozen caveman Frankenstein (Barr) took over.

I’m sorry about the death of Herman Cain but my spirits are lifted knowing he died for something he truly believed in: hearing Donald Trump riff about how he can walk down a ramp and drink water from a glass.
Trump wants everyone to safely vote?But he's rushing the schools to open?Yeah right..
and in Trump world, It's just a normal Thursday!!
that’s because trump is a bigger threat to not only Americans but the rule of law oh and you turned a blind eye to a sex offender

Real Presidents are attending the honorable John Lewis Funeral--Trump is the other guy!!  He will not be included in the presidents club because he's not presidential nor a leader! He's a menace, a threat, a danger &amp; responsible for killing 150,000 Americans!! Truth.
Florida hopes have been tempered in last 2 days, w/state reporting consecutive fatality records, w/86 deaths on Tuesday and 217 Wednesday. DeSantis, a Republican acolyte of President Trump, has come under growing criticism for his handling of the pandemic.
One more business Trump killed...... poor bastards!  A positive review by Trump is the kiss of death!! #ETTD
Well I think we all know the fear mongerig intentionally imposed over COVID is an excuse for the Democrats to incentivizing the Mail in voting  (Fraud ) ! Therefore President Trump is rightfully questioning if we should delayed the election since the safety is so important !
So stupid &amp; dangerous!! Unlike most of us, Trump doesn't have that thing in his head telling him you'll look like a lying hypocrite with completely obvious motives if you say this, but here we are:

A Closer Look at Melania Trump’s Latest Cause: A Makeover of the White House Rose Garden
Beware. Trumps new effort to send out $1200 or more to every American is intended to buy votes. checks probably won’t be received until shortly before mail in voting starts. Needed. Yes. But Trump is incompetent performance has caused a multitude of problems and suffering.
Damn. ⁦ got schooled by a girls’ action figure. 😂😂😂😂😂 Barbie shuts down Donald Trump Jr.'s snide tweet about new campaign dolls

That sucks. Hope it was worth going to that Trump rally.
"As more states turn to mail-in voting, Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the method, often with unsubstantiated claims. He has attacked mail voting nearly 70 times since late March, including at least 17 times this month" -The Washington Post:
95 percent of liberals said they plan to vote for Biden and 86 percent of conservatives said they plan to vote for Trump. Among moderates, Biden leads Trump 63 to 22 percent.

Just do better. If the very real responsibility is too much for you, find another job.   The media has failed to cover Trump as he should be covered. The failure is historic and has cost lives. DO BETTER. We’re screaming because we’re dying.Does anybody understand tha basic rules of punctuation? President Trump didn't say to delay the election, he explained the problem with Mail-in-vote and asked a reasonable question. I clearly saw a question mark at the end of his sentence. Did anyone else see it?
Mika,  President Trump is not responsible for the death of his friend and Patriot. We are all sad about losing him. But those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, your husband killed his employee and girlfriend. So be aware.
When trump is gone half the staff  will also find themselves out of work.
President Trump  should veto any bill that funds Mail-in-vote. He must veto it, not matter how much money he wants to give away. "Sen. Klobuchar: We Will Fund Vote by Mail -- 'It's a Hell of a Lot Safer Way to Vote'  via
China not only mishandled the COVID-19 virus, they created it. I often wonder if China purposely released this virus to diminish our economy which could assist in hurting Trump's re-election allowing a weaker President to take over that they could once again use and abuse.
When Trump successfully stops black people from moving to the suburbs, I wonder if he can do something about all the white people that keep moving into my mostly black neighborhood. Everytime I look around more  white people are become my  neighbors. They are peaceful though.
Trump says he wants a larger stimulus check because he “loves the people”. Please make that happen because Americans need help NOW!!!
I recommend that President Trump send corrupt Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci to their labs and into a Bubble ball and stay there until the real Doctors use available medications to save their patient's lives.
Trump, Dr. Fauci participate in roundtable at American Red Cross HQ  via
Donald Trump said he wants a larger stimulus check. Are you negotiating that with the Republicans? If not, please do it. Americans need help NOW!!!!
Shit Trump
Wow,  I think you should live in Venezuela buddy. But then again, you have never lived under a dictator. President Trump is the only thing holding our nation together right now. It sure isn't these "Peaceful" protestors ya goof!

Tramp's sheer and utter stupidity is allowing this to take place. We all know that trump spoke with Putin 7,8, or 9 times in the past few weeks. Obviously Putin gave him his orders to reduce the troops
Giving Trump’s accomplishments their due  -  -
Anyone surprised at that? He spends tens of millions hiding tax information yearly. A look inside these documents would free him from suspicion.  Mr. Trump? Hello? Sir? Mr. Trump? Is this mic. On?
😂😂 Trump played you again.
This can't be a real trump account. This fake trump is way smarter.
Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
Trump supporter and 2016 Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has died at age 74 from COVID-19, after catching coronavirus following his attendance of Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20th, 2020. Rest in peace. No more senseless deaths!
Spreading the Trump virus everywhere.  #Goppartyofdeath
I don’t think he’s serious. He’s messing with fake news. Trump knows they’ll go crazy over this. He’s like a cat playing with a mouse.
I agree with President Trump that voting by mail will cause major problems and voter fraud. When we have normal elections they seem to have a lot of difficulty, add mostly mail in and there will be total chaos!
But trump can take time during his speech to twice send Well Wishes to assistant child rapist ghislaine maxwell &amp; discuss how he does know her. Prob because he couldn't deny it w all those pictures w them all together floating about...
Sorry for the workers but it’s a direct effect of no leadership in Washington. Liberate here and there from trump and here we are
Trump says what pandemic? Proving he is incompetent.
Fake news cnn getting trolled by Trump again. He knows how to push your buttons and get under your skin. You fools fall fir it every time 😂😂
"Trump has no authority to delay an election, and the Constitution gives Congress the power to set the date for voting."
That little #twitterjack is teally cute isn't he? Jack,  you are violating our Freedoms os speach and interfering with our 2020 election, even after you lied to Congress that you are not, your first action was suspend Donald John Trump Jr.
Whenever Trump says something is "overly burdensome", all I hear is my kids' whining that picking up their legos is "too hard" and that their "arms are tired"...
Trump is her bosses boss (yes at least 7 levels up). So why hasn't she been given a BCD (bad conduct discharge) already?
Just vote out all the old guard republicans. After many many elections you learn how it all works. There are hundreds of millions of opinions and ours are each only one. There are 2 real choices as of now. For Biden or for Trump, against Biden is for Trump. Help stop madness.
Bernie can't win. I wish he or another candidate could but again a vote against Biden is a vote for Trump. Plain and simple. I have wasted votes before, not this time. It is imperative we get this one gone from the office.  Your freedom and future depend on it.
A vote against Biden is a vote for Trump. That is the sad fuc-- ng truth we have to face. I am not wasting a vote on one who cannot win. It is what it it is.
2/2 it does not surprise me at all that trump is using racist fear as his campaign's theme His total failure of leadership during the pandemic shows he's no president never was never will be he's a bomb thrower &amp; a embarrassment Who used the presidency as a get rich quick scheme
U.S. AG Bill Barr mocked Democrats and   allowed to expose themselves for the fools they are Monday during a House Judiciary Committee hearing Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) attempted to use the occasion to attack President Donald Trump on the coronavirus.
I think people are confusing Trumpism wbeing a Conservative Republican. 1st off, Trump isn’t conservative. 2nd off, he doesn’t hold the moral principles that once difined this party. He’s literally the embodiment of Hitler. We’re on a slippery slope here if people ignore history.
AG Barr is a liar and needs to reaign immediately! His legacy of sucking Trump's dick and bending over to please him by launching new DOJ investigations into his political opponents will leave him with the credibility of Richard Nixon! He will be going to prison Jan 20, 2021!
As soon as President Obama gets to reclaim 8 years of Republiturd obstruction!  Trump had FULL CONTROL of 2 years and didn't do a fucking thing. Now, he wants to blame Democrats for his failure to deliver on his campaign promises and his failure on his fucking wall? GTFOH!
Amd Trump has wrecked this entire country for four years!  Nadler will not cave to the GOP! He actually has a pair of balls!
Barr is a fucking tool that caves to Trump's every whim. The man is as honest as Mark McGwire saying he didn't use steroids!
What answers?  All he was doing was regurgitating the same bullshit lies that President Trump already spewed for months on end!  Barr has zero interest in the truth. He cares only about making his Fuhrer happy!!!!!
This could only happen under tRump

A 70 year old puppet of The Trump administration. Barr is the most crooked AG we have ever had. Using these out of touch old guard pedo racists To Find any good at all. Remember this administration stirs the pot and starts bad trouble, rather than good trouble.
They're so stupid Antifa is eventually coming for them. If Trump loses they'll be coming for the Democrats too.
It's the Epstein law. Barr has known him since the 70s Trump has known him as well along with some other predators.  These are the ties that bind. Look and see. There is a reason for all of this.
Barr lies for Trump.
Just found out my brother in law is a Trump supporter🥴
We the American people don’t want Trump to say anything trump can never add up to Congressman Lewis the man that he is and was his whole life Trump is evil
Trump is claiming to be the most transparent president ever. That is why he spent 10s of millions of dollars to hide his tax returns.  Now we see why these investigating would like to see this information to see what else he is hiding.
Democrats show him the play book  that Barack Obama and Joe Biden leaves show the American people the truth Barack Obama Leave the American people with enough supplies Donald Trump sold them to his Allied countries Democrats need to show proof I’m sick of lies

It just seems that Jim Jordan does nothing but spew misinformation that has been debunked for a long time.  The Trump campaign was not spied on. The FBI got involved because of bad actors in the Trump campaign. That is not spying.  Look what they found. Criminals!
Something about Trump hiring a doctor that says having sex with a demon can make you sick.
We see through all these republican protectors of the president asking Bill Barr the  Trump re election questions and saying what a great job he is doing.  All those standing up at the most corrupt president in American history.
You all keep going back to this bullshit, but only to distract from the thousands of deaths Trump is responsible for. Show me the evidence that this “spying”  caused the end of our democracy like Barr’s and Trump’s action do.

Well this is interesting! Didn't see this on the fake news. Explains a lot about what's going on. People trying to defeat Trump admin before they can expose all these disgusting people.

There is a reason Barr protects Trump. The Epstein  Connection goes back to the 70s with both of them. Barr's father hired Epstein In the 70s to teach at a private school. ( kid in a candy store) follow that trail and see where it leads.
The republicans want everyone back to school and work no matter what.  They are removing the monies given to people on unemployment in order to force people back to work, safe or not. There will be dead children and adults in the wake of the Republican plan. Fu-- off Trump.
They and their cronies are invested in these corporate entities, if they need anything, they call McConnell's phone as he has been bought and paid for years ago. Trump and all of the Gop care way more about money than they do people. Their God is money. Greed kills.

A safe bet, Miss SEC. There is no way on earth Biden’s people will let him go on stage to debate Trump or take part in another unscripted interview, regardless of how friendly the interviewer would be.  He can’t even take questions at his pressers.
God Bless you, President Trump!🙏

One.  But does that really matter?  We should all know that Biden is a placeholder only.  We should also all know that they will do anything to get power back including stuffing ballot boxes and using machines that only mark votes for one candidate no matter who you picked.

It’s all disruption and chaos in November. Mark my words trump’s private army will be at polling places with armor and assault weapons at polling places indimidating voters in Democratic cities
Well we all know that is a false statement. The most corrupt president in American history is Donald J trump. So the Trump- Pence administration is the most corrupt in our history.  Major incompetence and stupidity.
Don't worry about the 1.7% that's what the 2 party system wants you to blame trump(or whoever you don't like)on. Instead focus on the 46.9% knowing a 1% swing to either candidate would have resulted in a landslide victory. .2% would have won it fairly easily

This is a reflection of trump's America. He is dividing the entire nation. He is itching for a Civil War. Donald J trump is a sociopath. He is a psychopath. This division and divisiveness must stop.
My nephew lives in Seattle. This is one small area of town. The rest of Seattle is going about their daily business like none of this is even happening. Trump has blood on his hands. They told him to stay away he wouldn't do it
Portland Oregon was doing pretty darn good and the protesters or winding down. Then moron trump decided to send in goons and violate the Constitution. He is the king of chaos. He wants a Civil War in the United States.
My nephew lives in Seattle and this depiction that you C with fighting is so so minor. The pictures of Portland intimate that the entire city is a mess. The city is perfectly fine and going about their daily activities. Trump is looking for a Civil War.
Feels nice to retire after being elected twice! Trump won’t know the feeling.
All lies all been disproven and you just keep bringing it up. Donald J trump extorted Ukraine. Been proven. It's just the sheep in the Republican party let him get away with it.
Not gonna happen, they don’t want trump getting mad at them 🙄
To be clear you were asked not to come. The mayor and the governor said stay away. The incitement of violence is on you. They were dealing the best they could and things were settling down. You and trump are the cause of all of the hate that's going on. It is unconstitutional!!
Just saw on MSNBC that  is joining Ed. Sec’y DeVos in supporting Trump’s demand(?) that Florida schools reopen. In my opinion, Rick Scott was a lousy governor &amp; he’s an even worse senator.
You are a liar Joe. You &amp; Barack were in the White House for eight years, accomplished nothing&amp; blamed Pres Bush 4 everything. Pres Trump is in Office for 3.5 years &amp; despite of all the EVIL you unleashed on him he has acomplished more than you did in your entire miserable life.

It's no use arguing with the willfully ignorant my man. If after all this time people can still call Trump some savior despite the literal mountain of evidence showcasing what a sack of shit he is, nothing will save them. It's doubly confusing for a black trans woman though.
President Trump said putting a bottle rocket up your ass and igniting it was good. They would be doing it just to spite him period.

Was the zoom in on the trump flag necessary lol
No. As much as I trust Trump, what would your answer be if Biden or Obama was the President?
We need the instant testing before opening more places. This is getting much worse and will soon be in your town or city. Why is everyone so impatient? Ok because Trump refuses to support the citizens financially during this pandemic. Gop corporate socialist is killing people.
is more disconnected from reality than a a Trump Supporter.
Trumps America is turning into his commercial where there is violence anger and hate. What the hell is wrong with these people? Take your goon squad and get the hell out of peaceful city's before things get out of hand. Trump is trying to make this worse.
Not yet, but I’m a Floridian, so my days are numbered because my wonderful Florida leaders have bought Trump’s propaganda. Now, here we are.
Hundreds of Feds poured into Chicago as part of Trump's "Operation Legend," aimed at tackling violent crime and gun offenses.  Mayor Lightfoot initially resisted the initiative, but later said Trump has her support, as her city struggles with gun violence.
Of course. If you don’t vote Biden, you’re voting for trump.
FINALLY! Someone fights fire w fire. trump has been landing low blow after low blow &amp; pretty much no one even punches back. And when they do punch back?
...and you think Biden could have done a better job controlling COVID-19? He called Trump all sorts of bad names when he shut the Chinese planes bringing more Chinese into America. Yeah, he would do great . . . or maybe you could have done better - NOT.
Like you can’t vocalize your concern for child sex trafficking, while ignoring that Trump also had a deep relationship with Epstein, and documents regarding that are leaked. Like what is this cognitive dissonance?
There’s a weird trend right now with conservatives being really infatuated with child sex trafficking, while simultaneously ignorning that Trump also has a part in it.
If Trump cared about people like they do buildings,there would be no help needed at hospitals plenty of PPE, an instant covid test Troops tracking and tracing instead of instilling fear and anger in cities. These forces should be used to suppress the virus not suppress the people
More conspiracy theoerists will be comung out of the woodwork before the election, trying to blame Trumps failures on anybody but him.  Trump and his cronies plan the big lie to decimate America even more. Confusing those who do not know. Dividing the nation more. Vote him out.
Well my favorite driver likes almost all of Trumps tweets. I hate it but I still am a fan. I’d say Bubba is the only one that doesn’t vote for trump for sure. Maybe Reddick
President Trump has failed the American people it’s time for a change in in leadership.
You're not very good at this. Go ahead, try again...
You know if you did your job it showed you actually cared about this country we would not have to put up with Trump. How about you just start taking care of your own district. You know the one that's literally falling apart around the people. You are definitely worse than Trump!

Pure and righteous?! Where are you getting your crack rocks? You posted that in one of your 15 second windows of bliss, obviously. That come down is going to be brutal on you. You poor fellow.
Is this not a given for years already? They haven't accepted the last election results. There is a permanent coup attempt by the liberals for the entire Trump presidency thus far. Are there not federal troops deployed in liberal cities right now? What planet are we on here?!
The only hope for this country is Donald Trump.
Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump are failures to this country and state, there's no way I'm going to school when there's more than 4 million cases. #8minutes #NotMyKid
So much winning. You are responsible for the disastrous trump virus. 142K dead on your watch, Donald. So much winning. 🙄
The prescription drug thing Trump did today. By lowering drug prices helps all Americans. I don't understand why it's not being reported more. It's historic.
We may know why John Roberts is doing what he is doing one day. Does he want Donald Trump to lose November 2020 because there is a name John Roberts on the flight logs of Jeffrey Epstein's Lolita Express. Is it him?
Biden should ease up on that Trump is a racist stuff. Has shown a number of instances of being a racist. At some point Trump is going to throw that in his face. Then you know what he'll do, he'll lie. That's what liberal Democrats do they lie.

I heard after Donald Trump gave his speech about his lowering the prescription drug prices for American people. A lot of the democratic  were upset a bunch of them will heard saying" not getting kick back  it's going to cost them money in there illegal Cayman Islands account.
You know what people are calling Trump a racist a white supremacist. They haven't shown One Clip with him saying anything racist. There is plenty with Joe Biden showing his racism though. If Trump said those things, they'd be screaming it from the rafters.
Trump will sell our closest secrets to the highest bidder. That will guarantee a future credit line for he and his cronies. Traitor.
...South China Sea. I'm willing to bet that they are disarmed. Congressman didn't say it, but I do. President Trump must fire THEM? THEY ARE A DANGER TO NATION. The country is not safe.

Real News in the Trump Campaign! Cartoons. Does he miss Blues Clues too? Because he definitely needs a Notebook!
I just spoke to a liberal friend of mine. He said what Trump history about prescription drugs is political. I said maybe but at least he's trying to save lives. The liberal Democrats are killing them, in their cities for a vote. Their garbage.
I'm a diabetic and I take insulin. The prices are absolutely ridiculous, some points in my life I had to choose not to eat or take insulin an live. What Donald Trump did today I was so choked up I almost cried. Obama and Joe Biden got rich off these drug companies. Their garbage.Riddle me this.. how is it Ok for Obama to preach at Funeral, how bad President Trump is, yet every other American is BANNED from attending church services?
Your dedication to  is shattering the liberal myth of identity politics. Good Luck, every Trump vote counts to keeping #AmericaFirst. #MAGA #KAG2020
And since you misunderstood  here's some clarification for ya.
If prayers worked, trump wouldn’t be president.
It really shows the political genius of President Trump to send that tweet this morning. He got everyone on record to demand the election take place on the day it is scheduled and then pointed out to them mass mail in voting would cause massive delays in the election. Brilliant.

Because that never happens when Trump says anything.
y’all heard trump tryna stay in office by holding off the election because it isn’t “safe”??? YOUR TIME IS UP PINHEADD
Trump’s term is over in January. He needs to know if there is no election, Nancy Pelosi will become president in January. He cannot extend his term. He will only invalidate his election since he swore to serve until his term is over.
There was Trump pic w/ his comment. Came to defense of my  No conservative tweets on his feed.
For those never-trumpers that hv never bn able to get over Trump's locker room talk... #BidenRepublicans
Such a shame his chapter ended being defiant &amp; following behind Donald Trump.
Marcus incited Trump supporters to NOT visit his Camping World stores. I shall honor that.
These are direct orders from trump. Voter suppression is what he wants.

Maybe Trump is in town, the weather is wonderful here; the ⛳ is calling and are breeze.
I'm still very sad that Gohmert tested positive and  couldn't fly on Air Force One with Trump today.  He could have breathed heavily into Trump's rancid orange face the entire trip.  Lost opportunity.
Anybody who wants an absentee ballot like Trump can request one.  Americans do not want unsolicited ballots put in the mail with no traceability or verification.  Don't be a dimwit!
Is Donny dousing him with bleach yet?  Damn, apparently he was this close to getting on Air Force One with Trump.

My husband’s dad wasn’t as bad as trump and the family removed his car keys. Then when they found out he had several sets of keys hidden around the house, they sold his car.
My sister is named Karen. She believes in conspiracies and is a trump supporter. She blocked me on Facebook after I told her the government isn’t poisoning us by air. Jet exhaust fumes are not waves of chemicals being dumped on us.
Just watched your interview with Trump's press secretary.   She said that covid treatments like Remdesivir, plasma and steroids are possible ONLY because Trump broke down bureaucratic walls???? He had nothing to do with them.   And you didn't challenge her.
Sue them. There needs to be a class action lawsuit against MSM for lying. They are malicious and purposely preventing Drs from writing a script. They would rather see ppl die, then Trump be right. That’s intentional malice!
Class action lawsuit against Big Tech, MSM and Fauci. They are MALICIOUS LIARS! They are preventing DRs from using HCQ because the hate Trump and they don’t want him to be right. They would rather see ppl die. That’s intentional malice.
States preventing Drs from prescribing HCQ should be sued for malice. The dirty dems are banning the drug because they hate Trump. They would rather see people die, then Trump be right. That is Malicious!
For a stable genius, Trump knows so little about the most serious issues (scandals) of his presidency. But then he’s says stuff like he “knows better than the generals” or “better than experts.” Well, which is it man, Einstein or imbecile? (that’s “rhetorical”
You are kiddin right? If any #American who believes in  #1A and #2A doesn't vote for Trump, this country is forever lost as we know it. Hope you listened to Mark Levin this week &amp; what Biden meant when he said "transform America" attacking local rights in suburbs.
Barr spars with Dems on Trump ties, riots at fiery House hearing  #FoxNews DEMOCRATS are such evil folks. Why do they seek to destroy the US Constitution?
Trump and republicans.
Tucker, You are totally wrong about the poll saying we think the country is going in the wrong direction. Riots Black Lives Matter Antifa Anarchy This is what we mean as the wrong direction. We love Trump!
None of these people have ruined our great country like trump has in just 3.7 years. If it’s not painful to the gop, it certainly is to the rest of us listening to them.
Trump whining about Fauci being highly regarded, and “ why not me?” was PATHETIC.
Agreed. The left media, sadly, are more interested in fermenting Trump hate than helping the citizens of the US. Never have we seen such disdain for everyday Americans. Shades of Germany in 1939. We must turn them off.
Rep. Doug Collins: Why do Dems support anarchist activity over law and order?   ALL POLITICAL TRYING TO UNFAIRLY EFFECT THE ELECTION OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.

When Trump wins re-election they now have a place to run to.
Well it looks like Trump finally built his wall, but around himself undoubtedly!   You HAVE to realize by now that he hates ordinary ppl b/c they’re poor/dirty peasants. Thankfully, he is NOT our king and that is NOT his castle #movingdayiscoming #LOSER
Not defiant. Stupid. What have these men done to improve the circumstanced to those enslaved in the Dem run cities &amp; used for face ops during elections, then forgotten. Trump puts his money where his mouth is. Look at the improved circumstances for these beleagured Dem tools!
All this crap will end after Trump gets re-elected!
So the posturing continues.. that will change November 4 after Trump is re-elected.
Ha!  If you’re a Trump enabler then you’d better pray that all the Past Presidents never get in one room and get their hands on Trump.  They would take turns whooping his ignorant ass.
A person with a narcissistic personality, like trump, cannot be humiliated. When it gets to that point, he will say he didn’t want to win anyway. He rigged the election for a Biden win, so his base will never accept Biden as legitimate on his own.
This ad is false. Why would a burglar break into grandma’s house? She has no money and has sold everything of value to pay for utilities and groceries. This ad is aimed at seniors living alone. Vote trump and the burglars will disappear like magic.
Pretty simple: Never Trump. #sad
Birx has lost her credibility. She sold her soul and career to trump. Dr. Fauci continues to fight for the American people. He’s hired security to protect himself and his family from death threats. Deborah Birx is a turncoat..
I would crawl through broken glass, swim through an alligator infested swamp, and jump from a plane with a faulty parachute just to vote trump out of office.
One of the petty things of trump is refusing to hang the portrait of President Obama. I read where it was placed in a small room. This pisses me off. I hope Biden takes Trump’s portrait out to the dumpster. But Joe isn’t petty.
Biden takes aim at Trump over coronavirus in new ad blitz courting seniors   Democrats killed the seniors.
Hunting trump supporters should be a sport
He as well as Obama want to destroy the suburbs:  google AFFH suburbs.  Thank God for Trump
Matt, put on your thinking cap.. The impeachment of trump wasn’t a failure. He was impeached and it’s forever. You and your corrupt republicans didn’t have a trial to remove him from office. You failed and have failed forever.
The gop has destroyed itself. They may have had help from trump, but make no mistake, they had a hand in their own demise.
What in the hell is wrong with trump’s neck? Tree roots holding his head to his shoulders?
Why not? You pay large conglomerant farming companiex who lost money due Trump's trade war but no other industry that suffered through the Trump Tariff wars. You've paid the largest And wealthiest oil and gas company incentives to look for morr carbon producing energy.

Wait... Trump stands with protesters in other country’s and brags about protecting them?
But they will use taxpayer dollars to build a useless wall, send trump on his million dollar golf trips, pay for his adult kid’s vacations and on and on. Don, jr goes on his vacations to kill endangered animals. This makes me ill.
Joe has Clint Eastwood eyes. Come on Joe, throw some of Clint’s quotes at trump. “Do you feel lucky?” “Go ahead, make my day”. I could do this all day and only stop when I run out of material..
I don’t want to accuse trump of thinking, but he’s got to know how horrific he will look being escorted from the WH.
Getting rid of trump and his corrupt administration will definitely help the economy. A win/win situation..
You are attempting to view trump in a rational manner, but his decisions are irrational. It’s very difficult to even guess what’s going on in his damaged brain. My opinion is the only thing that’s keeping him in the WH is it’s safety.
1.  I can’t wait to see “Jaba the Trump” try to throw a baseball. 2. We should join the Major League Baseball players and flood the streets with good patriots taking a knee during the National anthem.

He said he would spend millions defeating trump. So far, nothing..
Trump killed more than Vietnam a war he never even was in
I’ve never called him president trump and I don’t capitalize his name.
Tragic and senseless murder. May God give comfort to his family during this difficult time. #senselessmurder

Sarah Sanders on newly released FBI document: More evidence of 'mass conspiracy' to take down Trump
They are armed and unidentified thugs dressed in military camouflage. They are not trained nor deputized. They’re arresting, detaining and kidnapping American citizens. Trump praised them for gassing the Portland mayor. Who does that?
I asked about Bloomberg’s big promise several weeks ago. We can’t rest until trump is out of office.
Does he realize how much better our lives would be if we had never heard the name Donald trump? I wake up in a panic every morning wondering what danger he has rought upon us during the night.
He didn’t cancel the convention, the Jacksonville sheriff canceled the convention since he couldn’t find enough security to protect trumps lard ass. I hope he found out about the other states that weren’t paid by trump for rallies..

Wait... does this guy work for the American people or Fox “News” and Trump.  Can’t be both.
Yep.  Trump certainly doesn’t change.  He’s consistently awful.
In a way, that’s good news. Into the new year means trump can’t take credit for it, stockpile it or price it out of reach for average Americans..
As all good liberals whose mantra is “do as I say, not as I do” Dr. Fauci does not disappoint.Can you imagine Trump doing something like that?The CNN &amp; MSNBC wolves would be howling for his head. Closer &amp; closer to marxist-fascist rules for society. If you’re one of us-no rules.
This is the kind of stuff that former presidents discussed civilly in conference WITH Chinese leaders. Trump’s plan is to continue playing tit for tat until it boils over. Then claim no responsibility.🤯via

Shut up Meghan. You’re nothing without your dad’s name and you’ll live off that name forever. Mary Trump is a clinical psychologist and you’re what? Mary has your number and diagnosis. You have some anger issues.
He didn’t cancel it. The Jacksonville sheriff could not provide the security for that large venue.  Perhaps he heard trump doesn’t pay his bills and didn’t want to deal with that crap..

Pres. Trump cancels the Jacksonville GOP Convention, per his press briefing. "It's not the right time for that." Sounds like North Carolina is back on.
Nah, not her- she’s a piece of trump work
No one likes the Epstein #chaos, but President Trump (like many REAL Americans, excluding you), believe in due process - Innocent Until PROVEN Guilty. His love of #America &amp; it's processes are why he was elected.

Why are you not in jail? Your corrupt, hateful, dogged efforts to destroy decent people is legend. Remember Arthur Anderson &amp; the fraudulent destruction you wrought on thousands of innocent working Americans. THEN you head up the manufactured Trump witch hunt. How do you do it?
Just saying  is it possible that the Obama Administration spied on the trump campaign until he was inaugurated?  Where is the coverage of origins of the Russian narrative? Just admit you all hate Merica and let’s move on. We are tired of your propaganda. Q signs on tv
You know... now I’m glad Trump treated “Ted the wanta be Texan” and his entire family with such disrespect.  He’s undeserving of respect or even the smallest display of ethical courage.  Ted is always grabbing the left over moral low ground.

Paul, if you referring to the leaky canoe Biden is paddling w his mask on-his only contribution to any meaning leadership  buy that farce, you will end living in a world akin Veneuela, Cuba, China &amp; all totalitarian regimes. Trump is our last hope.

Trump has two tones. “deaf” and “destruction”
They're scared, no one has ever seen a president like Trump and the Great Awakening is coming.
On my way to work listening to MSM say how Jack is going to silence those who disagree, i e. Q!  They're actually calling Q a conspiracy theory who believes the Deep state is trying to remove Trump.  Is there not an investigation ongoing? Looks like plenty of evidence to me.
You are so right! Don’t rely on polls... we were so certain Trump was going to lose and then shocked and speechless the evening of Election Day 2016. VOTE!

Rid this country of the Traitor Trump! #WeWillVote
All the cable news networks talking about trump rejecting the election results, and possibly postponing election 🤔 wtf?  Is the media making trump a villian so democratic voters just accept the dem primary results??
Who cares if trump rejects election results.  Good for him.  How do democrats rejects the primary results??
I think President Obama's eulogy of John Lewis probably knocked Trump a couple more points down in the polls.
Obama just called out Trump for screwing with the USPS and trying to suppress the voting rights of the American people.
Trump has used a rollback of a federal anti-segregation rule to appeal to White suburbanites, a racist move like we have come to expect from Trump. Conspicuously absent from the funeral of John Lewis, he continues to prove what a no class loser he really is.
That is how much they hate President Trump.  TDS!!!
Twitter, what is your opinion of Mary trump?
No, they probably don’t recycle those bottles. Anyhow, I’m in FL where 90% are elderly Trump supporters. It would take all day to get to my car.
Do you believe the current polling that dementia joe is leading trump.
Yea we know trump is the devil.🙄.  Joe is no leader. And the democrats are no different than republicans.
Any psychology folks on twitter?    If trump is such a germaphobe, why would he have hang ups about wearing a mask?
There is a lot of talk about it between conservatives?? Lmao! You do realize Texas is a major republican state right? Nobody believes anything you say about president Trump resigning... Do you have evidence of these republicans talking about it? I'll wait...
Trump destroyed Hillary in their debates.  I’m sure he’ll do the same with Biden.   Biden is not functioning with half of Hillary’s brain power.
This is the lady you believed and re-tweeted #Yikes
I keep hearing journalists pose the absurd idea that trump may refuse to leave office if he loses election.  (— ridiculous. If he loses, he will be a regular civilian.  He would be trespassing if he didn’t leave.
I thought I just saw something for Cory lajoie trump car.
Explanation: Trump
Your cable network has reduced your channels to two. On one channel is biden, the other trump. Which one do u watch?
I don’t want a trump 2nd term.  But the dnc is forcing it on us with their quack candidate joe biden
Ah, but we have the videos of Trump!
Partisan bullshit from the left has killed more people in 2020...it’s disgusting...all to get rid of Trump

That's just an excuse for Trump's cruelty. Which Barr carries out. Gleefjlly. He and Trump ought to be cellmates!
But I won’t vote trump
Get your head out of trump land and listen to facts and truth. Plenty of studies done proved that drug did not work and in many cases made things much worse for patients. You trumpster's can't see the true facts in front of you, unbelievable!
He did a really good job to my point of view!! I’m voting trump again!
Ms president FB it’s punishing trump supporters, they have restricted my account 3 day las week and now 30 days! Unbelievable what is going on in this country, very sad 😢
Zuck loves Trump
And while I’m venting...Donald Trump isn’t “giving” us anything. It was our money to begin with.
Best you can say is that Donald Trump was always an asshat.
I support President Trump
President Trump guaranteed no costs for testing and has worked with most large insurance companies to waive cost associated with COVID-19 hospitalizations. Those on Medicare, Medicaid &amp; uninsured will pay zero. Fortunately, most don’t require hospital stays and recover at home.
So the thinking of voters is—  We have to get rid of trump because he’s self serving using govt for his own benefit.  What do u call the dnc that cheats Bernie to elevate joe because he won’t change anything.
Are people asking this question because they know the dnc used fraud to elevate joe, and he is illegitimate anyway??  So even if trump loses to Biden, the results are meaningless.  Joe is a fake candidate
Are u referring to the trump administration era— with massive unemployment or a democrats administration that didn’t have pandemics?
🤣🤣🤣🤣So Trump!
This is ridiculous!!! Biden should be having debates with President Trump by now... less than 100 days.... get debating show us what you boys have! Biden has Dementia and Trumps got the Presidency.... let’s go 😂😂😂
Sounds like you just described trump
Ummm... Who’s the POTUS? Not Pelosi. Who kept saying it will go away magically? Trump! We all know who’s responsible, definitely not Pelosi
Trump doesn't want to get booed!
Trump will win big.
You think so? Quinnipiac poll (highly respected pollsters) has Trump down 13 points in usually tight Florida! He’s done-put a fork in Donny

How is biden different than trump?  What would biden change?  Be specific.
Trump did this!!!
Pelosi 🤦‍♂️.  Always trying to make it look like she hates trump.
Simple fact is, the majority of the states/cities these “peaceful” riots are happening in are blue. President Trump offered his support prior to things getting bad and was declined (too proud to take rep help), look what happened. Now they want bailout. 🤔
It does not matter whose admin. this started under, simple fact is, the majority of the states/cities these “peaceful” riots are happening in are blue. President Trump offered his support prior to things getting bad and was declined, look what happened. Now they want bailout. 🤔

If trump is a bad leader that automatically means joe Biden would be a good leader.   (— is this statement true?
WE NEED THIS!  Estimated 95,000 men women and children marching against Putin. I wonder what excuse Trump and Barr would use to send in the Storm Troopers if this were in Portland.
I understand. I am in FL too. Every time I see a trump 2020 stand hawking his crap I want to scream. The various cars and trucks loaded with bumper stickers, Confederate flags etc. 🤬🤬🤬
If you are a feminist will u be voting for:  A. Biden B. Trump
Trump and Barr's America! Wake up!!!
The same journalists who trashed Bernie the entire primary, trash trump daily, and constantly elevate Biden.  If u are a voter msm wants u to vote joe.  Just in case you can’t read between the lines.
I’ll admit trump is bad, terrible even.  I will also admit that Biden is equally if not worse than trump.
If TRUMP loses maybe it will be the patriotic americans that will not allow a peaceful transition   I think that is a promise
This bitch votes for Trump because her parents told her to
Without congressional approval Trump gave 7.3 billion dollars of pandemic funding to millionaire church leaders who support him while many small businesses were turned down.
Trump said he would next term.  My problem is that joe has been advocating for that for years.
I'm voting Trump, and doing it by mail.
I'm sure that's what you meant.. not being hit by a truck. So glad your concerned about us all making it to the election alive. That way we can all make sure Trump stays in office where he belongs
What exactly has he done for this country. Did he break all time unemployment numbers? Did he have record stock market numbers? He hasn't had to listen to whiney little Trump haters. Get back to your safe space, get your blanket, and cuddle up to some CNN crybaby 😫😫😫
Don't need to waste a minute listening to more trump lies!! He's proven himself to be an all around failure over and over again.  You should wake up and see the truth and not spread his lies, racism and hate.
When trump tries to convince England to have the British open at one of his golf courses, is that different from Hillary’s pay 4 play access.
“All the plans we have for a safe and legitimate general election in November depend heavily upon the ability to expand vote-by-mail. Yet those plans would be completely upended if the United States Postal Service collapses.”
Dems are big on their nominee not being trump.  Who else is not trump?  A. Howie Hawkins  B. Bernie Sanders  C. A write-in not named trump D. Person. Woman. man. Camera. Tv
#LMAO #Portland has chosen their path. Find Joy in those decisions. I wish #Trump wud let it be what it is. Let residents vote for change or leave. #Riots #blmportland #blm #AllLivesMatter
Trump needs to resign!
You are obviously not at your Florida home where all that Trump crap is constantly up in the face. I’m afraid to put up any Democrat signs or stickers. I feel like prey down here.
Please let them take trump and his cronies far far away.
Uh excuse me they are blaming Biden for this, uh no trump is president
Trump doesn't care about his own kids!
Why Trump is stlll in office is beyond me. The #GOP is negligent and evil. They support Trump.
Trump did this!
Poor wittle Scotty!! Go cry to Trump. Maybe he can fire someone and fit you in. Most of his staff has no experience or talent either.
Yes, truly a crime... While President Trump rushed to have a hospital Ship standing by, Cuomo opted to send infected seniors to nursing homes instead, that spread the virus and killed innocent uninfected patients.
I have family &amp; friends who live in Northern VA. They either work 4 or do work 4 the Gov. Everyone lives 500k homes wth I love Obama  Stickers on cars, most voted 4 HRC. They r now Trump  Supporters but they will not tell anyone from their  Neighborhood. I'm in Fl &amp; I tell no one
The protestors are out there due to the inept administration. If Trump didn’t create turmoil and spurn by hateful rhetoric, there would be no need for the protestors. Your argument is “Trumped” by the law of cause and effect.
I think you’re just as much of the problem in America as the ones you claim to be “paramilitary”. You do realize that the Trump administration is much like religion, great to follow, but what happens when it’s too late to realize you’ve been on the wrong side all along?
We knew about Trump in the 1990's in NYC!
mask law now.
Troops are not terrorizing your citizens your own citizens are terrorizing thanks to all the shootings in Chicago while you spend time complaining about Trump instead of protecting the people
Trump's America
That was 2016.  Now he supports our President!!! Trump and Pence 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Great job! You and William Barr did a wonderful job on explaining what the plan is to stopping all of the violence.      Thank you for putting a face to some of the violence that has been happening. God Bless You! Trump and Pence 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Trump did this!
So it’s President Trump’s fault if the States didn’t handle the virus correctly AND it’s President Trump’s fault for sending Federal Agents to protect our Cities. Which is it?  Feds for the virus is okay but Feds for violence is bad?  BTW, The virus is China’s fault.And Trump will step over his body and keep going. He sacrificed his life for naught never to have his name uttered again by the chosen one. Black people are dying 3 times more than whites. How senseless to die being so utterly reckless.
Fo r years, israel has had the cure to diabetes.
Trump turns on Fox News. Turns off John Lewis funeral coverage and sets up his hair-coloring appointment.  Time on his hands.   Trump will clean up the suburbs, because in his demented mind he did “more for Blacks then MLK, John Lewis, or Obama”.  #wakeUpGOP
Trump won’t attend final funeral tribute to     silent.  Trump is “cleaning up suburbs”  silent.   dies of Covid19 after joining Trump at a pandemic hotspot. #BlackVoicesforTrump SILENT.  Their silence is Deafening!
I see #HermanCain has passed and trump has already moved on to a new pizza man.
Herman Cain joined Trump with no mask to Trump’s Oklahoma rally.   #RIP #HermanCain 999
And you missed the one tape of trump giving Putin some massive head.
Cut to Trump’s Texas MEET, GREET, AND SPREAD COVID.  must be pulling his toupee off in rage.
You can spread Covid19 with Trump for $10 Billion in economic losses! #WOOHOO
Fauci has to illustrate using his hands to get thru to Trump. 🙃
Trump 2020 bitches. Your getting buried. Trump will win again.
Trump doesn't give a shit about anything but his money and his honey (Ivanka)
Real Americans are smart people,dummy. We wipe our ass with your fake news.Trump will win again. You, Lemon and Cuomo are a bunch of clowns.
Bullshit only because is election year. Thru Puertorricans will vote for Biden we haven’t forgot the way Trump put us as second class American citizens after Hurricane Maria. After sacrificing the life of our men and women since WWI.  Did you know that Puerto Rico have more men
Did you look at the polls that you sent me? What was the average? Was the average +15? Or is it +3, within the margin of error? You proved my point, but you're too busy trying to be big brain that you missed it. Hillary &amp; Trump were neck &amp; neck, especially in swing states.
All of the polling for Joe Biden shows he's ahead of Trump way more than Hillary ever was against him.
So I'm driving in Bridgeton, NJ (Salem County) for a work assignment... and I see these two flags flying on this home's lawn.  I get close enough to snap a picture.  An American/Confederate flag &amp; a Red TRUMP flag.  In NEW JERSEY.  YES... I know it's Salem county... but DAMN!
I want you to go and find me an inaccurate poll for the general election of 2016 within a week of the election. All polls showed Hillary and Trump within margin of error, and she won the popular vote by +3.
5 weeks is a long time - like 1 less GA Trump voter long time.
Bad enough you can’t drive through Palm Beach without feeling like you aren’t white/rich enough to be there, now they are making sure that all the POC who work for them have to travel from satellite slums on the east side. Since it’s not worth the hassle, Trump hires foreigners.
I appreciate you being the toughest questioner in the WH Press corps, but this opening sentence plays right into the narrative that it’s the Dems fault. The failure lies with Trump &amp; Mnuchin’s inability to negotiate a package that provides actual assistance to those who need it.
True. American. Patriots will put and end to the crazy Goverment the Democrats have tried to force us to except ! They are crazy and out of control ! They have shown all Americans there true colors ! President Trump will win ! And put an end to all this insanity!
Your time is getting closer to prematurely be over for ever ! Trump 20/20 nov 3 . Democrats will be finished for ever
$5 says he loses in a landslide. Too many voters now see that everything he does is driven by outdated views on what made America so great.  Trump divides people, lies and exacerbates problems. He is not working to solve anything.
Trump family investment in the production.
We had to change the theme of our restaurant, which was faded glory red white and blue with all the flags of our country hung from the rafters. People began to assume we were political. Business divebombed. Trump is not as popular as he thinks.
Oxford U, funded by Gates were set to study hydroxy in Europe.  Study was HALTED as Covid19 patients administered this malaria drug immediately developed heart arrhythmias.  Top research docs vs Trump voodoo.  Go with Oxford! Also, if it worked, guess what? EVERYONE WOULD USE IT!
Freedom from decent folk, Devin invites you to join him in Debachery and Lechery with men pretending to be female Trump supporters. It’s a Catfish Delight! Let all your secret glory hole desires be filled in the Parler!
I'd love to see fairness and retribution for the horrible things he did to USA and Trump. I'm trusting God who is the only Judge who swing this.
Introducing Trump's No Way Dancers!  😂😎
I couldn’t agree more. Trump would rip  Biden a new one.
is flat nailing Trump to a wall right now. Making Mario proud. You watching this  ?
Trump is an embarrassment. “Nobody Likes Me”. 🤪
It’s Trump’s effect on us all
All these POLITICIANS trying to be HEROES INSTEAD of preparing us,  FOLLOWED the GOVERNOR in Brown nosing TRUMP instead of looking at the science and warnings . YOU ALL DROPPED THE BALL AND ARE STILL BOBBLING IT TO OUR DEMISE .
98 days till Trump is gone 98 days from now, you go to bed and when you rise 97 days till Trump is gone.  97 days till Trump is gone 97 days from tomorrow, you go to bed and when you rise 96 days till Trump is gone!
Oh my, lets see..trump is an evil psycopath, murderer, rapist, liar in chief, narcissistic piece of shit, egomaniac moron, grifter, cheater, and so many other horrible things #WhyIDontliketrump
Soon as that stimulus drop Trump turning the hurricane machine on high😂🤣
Not every trump supporter is a racist he is but not all.
Join South Florida workers and local leaders on Friday to send a message to the 3 stooges: Senator Rubio, Senator Scott and President Trump, that they need to pass a the HEROES Act and fund unemployment insurance fully at $600/week! ✊🏼✊🏾✊🏽✊🏿
Democrats have proven they want one thing. Maybe two. I want to attack President Trump in every way possible. They also want to destroy the Constitution and the survivability of each American business.
This is why electing Joe Biden, though necessary I believe, will be pointless because the democrats will NOT do a single thing to prevent the next Trump. We must take over the Democratic party.
We cannot blame Trump for the outcome of the Covid virus. Obama was the most corrupt President and Trump is trying to fix things. Really hard to do when he is attacked for everything and ignorant people don't help stop the spread. Lets also look at CDC.
IMPEACHED PRESIDENT TRUMP IMPEACHED PRESIDENT TRUMP ENJOY YOUR RETIREMENT.
here's an insight into why many DETEST news staff. Trump's Tulsa rally on FOX crushed MSNBC &amp; CNN attracting 8 MILLION viewers but NBC News terms it "underwhelming"-Actually TIKTOK users sabotaged it &amp; Media creates a TRUMP FAILED narrative.
Trump INTERFERES IN EVERYTHING. Barr is 🤥
Trump at 2016 rally: help me Putin!
Correct the Problem that Donald Trump fails to Correct or deal with....
After Nov. 3rd please take sad hurt pix of all Trump clan members on their way out of town.
The answer is always yes to the question “Did Trump lie?” The subject is immaterial.
Trump is the Typhoid Mary of Covid. Herman Cain attended Oklahoma Trump shindig and has been hospitalized with Covid19 ever since.  Trump never mentions Cain. Trump can’t even wish him well.
Tell me when we have effective vaccines AFTER Biden is in office, and how many obstructionist GOP members are ousted along with Trump. Then I’ll give you my answer.
Trump’s strategy is to gin up fear. He does this by tearing America apart. Putin could not have pick a better foil.
Trump wins every time his supporters infiltrate peaceful protests to destroy property.  State law enforcement and   simply need to ID persons attending protests NOT to actually support BLM, but send message across nation the #BLM is a danger.  ID and report it out.

lol lunatic right wingers crying because people protest donald trump, meanwhile trump acts like he wouldn't accept Democratic decision of an election
This shit is so god damn over
Trump is that relative you hope stays away from your funeral, so people can mourn respectably without it turning into a sideshow.. so it’s a good thing.
Remember...   "All that matters is that we get Trump out of office even if we're voting in another piece of shit cut from the same cloth"  Smh lol
The biggest problem will be Trump declaring a National Emergency, a "State Of War,"  turn off internet communications and postpone elections.
WILL GO BLUE TO KICK TRUMP OUT. ASK ANYONE OVER 55 IN FLORIDA. #bodybagPolitics
Ivanka has been temporarily sidelined due time bible mishap. Get Melania out in a super tight outfit and spike heels 👠 in the ROSE GARDEN!  The WH Press Corps will eat it up! Have her plant the TRUMP ROSE 🥀 we can sell on line with MAGA hats!
Yo, “our people” are dying! You’ll lose election! It’s NOT just killing blacks and 80 year olds! 😣  Trump’s politics are killing AMERICA.   All issues are viewed as Right vs Left and Black vs White. MSM reports 24/7 on extremes while  98% occupy a middle ground.
I have a Trump Wall joke, but it fell apart￼. 😷
I dont think they want trump there.
Trump is toast. Biden enters office with pedal to the metal. Keep your sell orders to a minimum.
One of the biggest problems of Russia gate was that it was significantly overhyped by many of us. It's true trump is a criminal, but not a manchurian candidate.

Didn't lewis say Trump would be re-elected over his dead body?  ;)
Really, the democratic party has disassociated itself from the people, the things they do and what they say are out of the reality of the American people, in the end, more and more supporters of Trump join in, the shot came out of the butt.
Until Trump, yes.
Maybe no one told you Trump has been in office for three years.
Trump’s number 1 mission since he was 10
Please, wise ones, tell us all that must be done--in all fields...law enforcement, IT, Congress, media focus on new P and VP rather than Trump's shenanigans (our customary entertainment).
Rick nails it. The washing off the stain of staunch Trump support from Senate cloakrooms and congressional clubs has already begun. #passtheSoap #noWorking #FindANewJob #BeBest
He made no progress on what he campaigned on.   NO infrastructure investment, revitalized NO inner cities,  helped NO “forgotten men” but white nationalists.  All he DID was stir up a race war. Them vs us.   Obama, as the foreigner.  Ivanka, the princess.  Trump conned America.
It’s great he came to his senses but a question came to mind immediately I read this. What character did he expect the country to have during a Trump presidency?
Trump has played more golf on your dime then Obama did in 8 years Your Dime Mrs.
When is some going to out thistle Fuck,maybe Trump will do us the honor
This should be more alarming to you than anything else. Joe Biden effectively has one of the easiest presidential runs and US history. Because people are so discontent with Trump that all he has to do is sit back and do nothing and he will blow out Trump.
Lol wow. I'm no Trump supporter, but him throwing out the first pitch for 1 game would never make me jump ship. Let them move to the Mets. We have no room for bandwagon fans.
No should surprise us. William Barr wipes Trump’s booty. I apologize for the words, but we can’t expect anything normal from this administration. Keep our eyes 👀 open and get ready for war. Trump forgot one thing. We are the United States 🇺🇸
We can not stand down, back off. All eyes 👀 opened 24/7..Can’t fall asleep for a second on this lunatic sociopath. I read John Bolton’s book 📖 I got the Mary Trump’s book 📚 on Tuesday for my birthday. I’m on my 3rd time reading because I keep retaining. Trump is Diabolical 😱
He’s been doing it since day 1. Then again, every Trump business has done nothing but bleed money, and they’re all desperate that their biggest fraud of all is ending soon.
Trump is fighting like any criminal that is trying to avoid prison.
I live in a senior community in SW Florida, I’ve lost a majority of my acquaintances here because I won’t wrap myself in the trump flag. No big loss. In fact, it’s edifying to know who is a good neighbor and who would kill and eat you in case of hurricane or national crisis.
They blame trump if the sun rises in the east.
Don't try to confuse his poor little brain with any actual facts. They don't want facts. They want someone to masturbate their egos and tell them everything wrong in the world is Trump's fault.
Trump + 3 years = 👇🏻
The sleepwalkers, maybe. Not the rest of the country. Everyone impacted is wide awake and watching politicians posture while Trump crashes their careers in to a brick wall.  #historic
Hey l👀k Ma! We’ve been conned!  Con artist:  1. persuade someone to do or believe something, typically by use of a deception. 2. Donald J. Trump
AMERICA’S WAR VETERENS ARE OUT IN FORCE —&gt; PROTECTING AMERICA AGAINST TRUMP 😳 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
America is the antithesis of everything Trump and his clan promote.  The million lies The false superiority The racist dog whistling The be best bullying Cosmetic piety  Gold leaf/designer 👜 wannaB celebrity  The jig’s up. The fraud exposed. American exceptionalism is moving on.
This would require a NATIONAL call to service. Federal funding and workers retrofitting existing schools where feasible or setting up class rooms on open space lands.  TRUMP is doing none of this! He is busy inventing one-off jobs to nowhere for his daughter.
Definitely, Trump has something on Lindsay.
Trump said he had conversations with world leaders..Sure he did! He called PUTIN and NBA..All this time he has been preparing for the massive invasion he’s putting into place. We’re headed into ARMAGEDDON. He’s even been having our soldiers killed!!! #FactCheck
I started reading Mary Trump’s book. Trump is a demon and much more dangerous than people can imagine. He is causing all this chaos with the virus, economy etc..to deviate us away from what he’s doing. He’s setting up the stage for a massive invasion👁 #Eyeswideopen 👀
If anyone is a lowlife it’s you “ TRUMP “ your own niece puts you out for the creep you are. I purchased the book 📖 just like I also read John Bolton’s book 📚 which I purchased #DumpTrump #LockHimUp #BidenForPresident2020
Families are fighting over politics. Thanks to the divisive rhetoric spewed by a master of illusion. Donald J Trump
Donald Trump will say he was given a "small loan" of a million dollars by his father and in the same breath call himself a Republican. LMAOOO
Trump appears to not care about US Troops since he did not question his friend Putin about the bounty on US Troops. It’s time for Trump to resign in shame now. Where are the republicans.
Trump: where is Puerto Rico?
Even trump’s own children are unemployable...
Why have the Indian leaders taken to copying the orange buffoon’s (DT)antics? I saw some one paunchy leader from Bengal doing a photo-op of hitting a golf ball, now someone emulating Trump’s Goya act. Shameful idiots.
Treats from Trump are the worst. Stay safe Tony.
IN ISRAEL THEY GOT THEIR OWN TRUMP IN BIBI THE BUTCHER.

Putin wouldn’t do it any better.   Trump undermines (in attempts to destroy) the foundation, character and grace of the office he “temporarily” holds.   He mocks established protocols and all who possess integrity, professionalism and knowledge he sorely lacks.
It’s good to see life long Democrats and Republicans uniting for America and for Trump.
the trump virus sounds about right. we should all call it that. he earned it.
How crazy the CDC proposal to send kids to school. Their proposal is just as crazy as Trump proposal.  Keep your kids as on line learning only until it’s safe

100% of educated suburban moms kicked Trump to the curb l6 months in to his 1st term.   November 2rd or BUST!
I’m assuming someone or many are listening in. Trump is so fucked.
Step 1: Trump loses in the largest landslide in US history. Step 2: don’t worry about how he is escorted to the 🚁
States don’t have resources to mend services required to rebuild community. Cheap labor lured Corps to deinvest in US.  Fed’l reinvestment required. Living wages, training, education for next-gen jobs.  Trump ran on THIS, got elected, sat on his hands. Launched race war.
Trump may be an obtuse ignorant divider along racial lines BUT he is following a suburban white fear script that he believes will work. It won’t. Everyone see through his hate mongering. It’s turning more white voters against him.
Mayors of cities overwhelmed by joblessness, homelessness, gang violence, drugs, have long required social programs/infrastructure $ Trump spoke to this on campaign trail!   He DID NOTHING.  Jobs. Safety. HC/house for homeless.  Hand gun/gang control. Neighborhood policing.
Is the WORST president in the history of this nation. He is an embarrassment, lying, traitor, hateful, racist, corrupted, ignorant dictator that only cares about himself and his big fat ego.  #VoteTrumpOut #VoteByMail2020 #DictatorTrump
Every other voter vs Trump, his 20 Senate friends, 1000 yahoos &amp; 4 kids.   #1025
Her reputation is done. After trump is gone who will she lie for and defend . She would have been a great secretary for hitler.
And it’s failing badly like everything trump.
Geaux Girl Trump!
Idiots can’t turn off their idiotic brains. Also, there really is NO “Trump campaign”. He’s a one man show. And the show must go on.
The career and reputation fall out caused by association w/Trump will make Nixon out to be an alter boy.
If there is a God and He is merciful Trump wins.
A mf that says racist shit and a mf that passes laws that make it easier to put people that look like me and you in prison. Not gon happen bro. Just bc he a democrat means i gotta vote for him? Nah. He just as shitty as trump bro.
No tf he not bro. Go on google and search up joe biden and the laws he's passed to have black people massly incarcerated. We hate trump bc of the shit he say ab minorities we should hate joe biden for what he does to minorities too. He tryna paint a picture das fake.
And now Philly's District Attorney threatens to arrest Trump's paramilitary goon squad.   No bueno. 😔
Stop sticking it to our Holy Father!! Who's side are you on Coffin? If you're unhappy about a family member you don't publicize it!  Trump wants things to come out &amp; doesnt want to frustrate the process &amp; EXPOSE this evil trafficking enterprise.  Pray 4
Trump is a serial liar. He's lied all his life now he doesn't know the difference between a lie and the truth.
All your lies aren't true, Trump
All the Trump stooges!
Freedom of speech,Trump. You or anybody else will not take it away without a fight. If you don't like freedom of speech and opinion then keep your mouth shut. You spew bullshit
No, your probably right..Biden will terrorize us all..and people will be wishing they had Trump back. #socialismisBidensagenda
Nah lol. I hate trump as much as the next mf but yall gotta stop acting like joe biden the answer too.
It's not our country anymore, it's Trump's :(
No way but Trump say he didn’t know him.. shit don’t tell me it was a lie. Lol 😂
Got the BRITISH OPEN for TRUMP . Interesting.  ILLEGAL??? SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG.
This will keep Trump busy for a few hours today. #distractionsSaveLives
Tell it to trump. Last night he said deaths didn’t matter because we are old and dying anyway or have conditions that merit our deaths to unburden the medical system.
Trump
Open your ears Huge! He is conning you. He’s playing the evangelical trump card.
Objectively speaking Donald Trump is easily the worst president we've ever had post-slavery. He's literally what you get if you took all the bad things about Nixon &amp; Reagan and put them into 1 president.
This tweet implies a lot of things and the biggest one is that Trump has really been ignoring his responsibilities for not only 6 months but also 3.5 years. His handling of this pandemic has only magnified how little he's truly done as the leader of the free world. Dude is TRASH.Open your eyes he works for  himself...he’s greedy corrupt toxic  human . He’s crapping all over his base by eliminating fair housing, giving  them false info on virus and the people you mention came up thru the ranks inspired by John Lewis not selfish Trump.  Get real.
The smallest thing in life is to defend my honor. Reason why, as sit here criticism towards our President. Yet I seen a family going down and I picked them up. God bless President Trump!!
Only 247 People Are Watching Joe Biden Attempt to Read a Teleprompter in His Basement  Quite an improvement over the day he had 19 people watch his event. That was the day that President Trump raised $20 million online.
trump is WAY beyond asshole Toure
And you are believing the bullshit Trump is spewing. They did nothing more to Flynn than they do to drug dealers,  illegal arms dealers, illegal aliens and every other lowlife the cops deal with everyday.
No... I credited Obama with the decrease in unemployment from 2008 to 2016. After that it was Trump’s economy since he took office in January 2017, which is why I credited him with bringing unemployment down 1%. It’s his fault now because he’s the sitting president.
The Magas have been promising chaos &amp; civil war since middle 2016 if Trump didn’t win, so no change there.

Sure seems to be a lot of real conservatives coming out against Trump.  When I heard that George Will would be voting for Joe Biden I thought I had stepped into bizarro land. Another prominent conservative ws calling for impeachment because of the change election day tweet by djt
Are you awake! Trump is a dictator. He used our military against our own people for a photo opt. Our general called him out for it. He goes after black lives matter and let’s his goons stand in front of a court house with ar-15s and says liberate. You wake up
You sir are the most delusional person I have seen on Twitter, believe me I have seen many! RIP mr. Cain after the Tulsa trump rally with no mask!
I set an alarm on my phone for 8 pm every night to pray for President Trump. 🙏🏻
The republicans really need to change their ways is the gop is to continue. If it can after trump! Republicans news flash trickle down does not work! Stupid old belief
I can't help but think Joe will really do the job, not pretend. Twitter won't be his priority.  I'm thinking once  Trump is gone Twitter goes with him. It will return to what it once was.
Susan’s a writer - doubt she’d have to look that up, but 🤷‍♀️? Looking up, double/triple verifying, multi-sourcing &amp; looking for best answer is what smart people do. Dumbfucks like Trump try &amp; fake it, &amp; it’s hilarious! “Nuclear triad”, “per capita”. 🤣🤣🤣 You funny too, lol🤠🤪🤡
Most defenate I never heard hard core Democrats confessed  There voting for Trump till the other day I was at the food store

This looks strange to me. Does anybody else think that that is a real picture of Mike Singletary, but Trump is a cardboard figure?
By killing the president they made intentions clear... Punishment swift  These scumbag Republican Senators that are still voting with Trump these people are hated by our founding fathers, they are hated by the righteous ghosts of the Roman republic, and the American republic.....

Justice Dept? Where was Barr’s stubby thumb of suppression &amp; redaction? Guess trump will start with the Peter - Lisa tweets again, since concepts like integrity &amp; professionalism will always be foreign to him.
And shamed del Mar is our guy if he is up to it he should be put into the headlines and face Trump he should be our lightning rod... bring them to the Congress and let him just walk around harassing Repub whenever he sees them he can have an office inside of Nancy pelosi's suite.
The only question is how we can get between Donald Trump propaganda and is batshit crazy Minions because that has to happen  Trump needs to be taken down publicly by somebody with equal and opposite abilities so to speak  A person like Bill Maher ... Trump should be heckled .....
Epstein was a Russian asset, that’s why bony really knows where his fortune came from, kinda like bankrupt Trump. Trafficking underaged girls to rich and powerful had one purpose, gather material for blackmail.  Unfortunately Epstein “hung himself” after Barr met with him in jail
He's intentionally deceptive and he enjoys it and as his power has increased so is his craziness  Among The four horsemen of the Apocalypse is Donald J Trump
We may soon find out what Putin is blackmailing them with (them = Trump, Barr)
The economy contracted by 32.9% in Q2  Is America now ready to give Trump credit for finding a balance between saving covid-19 and avoiding economic apocalypse?  Our economy would have tanked. He saved lives and gave us an economic future As usual ..Trump got it right
They're lying they're all lying Trump is telling them to lie Trump never took the f****** drug he's not stupid he's a liar he lies on intentionally everybody knows it
he's not cross-examining him correctly he shouldn't let him get a word in that son of a b**** pig f***** Evangelical idiot is screwing up this country  and now he's going to declare the bar is going to decide about our elections he's triangulating with Trump
Pompeo thinks he's going to triangulate with Trump and Barr   Pompeo is crazier than the evangelicos he represents
Should we begin to characterize the people that go to the Trump rallies  it would be the easiest group of Americans to ""put through the wringer"" since the know-nothings whose political movement died suddenly in 1861...  In other words tear them a new one
Trump hates Dr. Fauci but loves Dr. Stella because #TrumpHatesScience
BREAKING trump says he barely knew Herman Cain ....talked to him once very briefly
Anyone else have an aversion to the color red because of Trump? Ever since those horrible hats, I now associate the color red with him and MAGA and republicans. Anyone else have this issue?
Good luck with collecting that...about as worthless as Iran putting an arrest warrant for Trump
They represent everything my dad hated. My dad even called out Trump and my dad died in 2007... Call him out,,, he said, that so-called TV show The Apprentice was the only good thing that ever happened to John J Trump .. the sins of the father, the sins of Fred...
#FederalistSociety #MoscowMitch #LadyGraham #Trump  The Fed Soc doesn't care about the #Delay tweet. They're using it to dump #TRE45ON b/c  #TrumpIsLosing. Fed Soc wants to keep Senate red for judge confirmations. Signalling GOP it's ok to break with cheato &amp; try to win races.
Pretty sure that photo was shortly before Trump ratted him out to the cops.
Me too Amy 😔. Trump sucks!!
U the people in the left have wish to kill trump, make pics about it w his head, make videos of trump look a like to be shot in the head, destroy the live of a 16 year old for a fake video where celebrities n news outlets espoused his life n leftist celebrate it, in fact some of
Just a horrible deal. Perhaps Trump is laboring under the assumption that Kodak, shorn of its technology edge and top thinkers, is the company he remembers from the 60s
Hard to argue with that, I suppose. If we’ve learned anything about Trump, it’s that he’s not a details guy. And secondarily, he’s not a big picture guy. #hmmmm
Trump is a monster!  His constant deflection and reference to Covid 19 as the China Virus makes my blood boil!
Keep them in ghettos right Donald, low income people are Americans also. You are disgusting. Your dad made your millions by building low income housing in cities, you loved it then! It’s fear your selling, be it crime, housing,anything. You are a low life!
You I’ll get to see it tenfold at Cain’s funeral with Trump who will make  it a rally.
So?  It’s a snapshot in time . We now have a George Wallace (Donald Trump) in the White House. He’s a questionable GOP
We still need more.  I'm sure there are 10,000 armed trump supporters who will try to intimidate voters.
Bottom line keep them closed to hurt Trump! You should know that!
Yeah when Pennsylvania fines its footing and it's passed in July 1863  when Pennsylvania resolves to kick the ass of the second coming of Jefferson Davis who happens to be Donald J Trump
And, don't forget Mr. V.P., it was  that stopped travel from China on 1/31/2020. Day before that, the WHO Director General said no travel ban on China was necessary due to the novel corona virus. Thankfully, Pres. Trump didn't listen to the WHO!
Trump claims that the 2020 election is “rigged,” hours before he claims he will win the election “big.”  Doesn’t that mean that Trump is rigging the election in his favor? Just asking for a friend, named Joe Biden.

Also, would trump delaying the general election also affect the local elections that would decide congressional representation?
Issa joke. Trump can’t postpone the election anyways. Just like that the guy is dead serious about thinking trump is getting 6 years on one election cycle. Lol
Note to Iran - that was not a positive about Trump.   English is a backwards language sometimes but maybe don’t worry about the US. We will figure it out.
Didn’t he got the Trump’s virus in Oklahoma? So do you take responsibility sir?

To everyone spazzing out: no, Trump is not delaying the election. This is what children do when you take their toy away.
Why is he so great he was a lackluster executive... A national Pizza chain is no Great American  We have too much pizza... he was willing to collude with Trump that makes him an Uncle Tom, like Carson...
Looking forward to David Begnaud’s breathless CBS reportage on our perennial-victim Puerto Rican pseudocountrymen and how tough TS Isaias and Trump negligence are on them while they’re carpetbagging in Florida. Hardships on actual Floridians?  Nah. Doesn’t fit the narrative.
Only in the modern crazy world Hitler and Stalin have ganged up over the internet to attack America directly...  With Trump all over the headlines we must never forget never never never never  Putin WILL PAY for what he has done to our country,,, and if that means his own blood..
Trump is now saying the election is rigged, but he is also claiming he will win.  The only conclusion we can draw if he is correct, is that he’s rigging the election.
I think you owe  an apology for this article on 4/24.  It hasn’t aged well.
Donald Trump knows that intrinsically  He hates people that are smarter than him, that are more moral than him... He hates successful people that made their money honestly he hates those people with a passion
The Dems talk safety of the people in line as a reason to do mail in voting. If it’s such a safety concern then delay it ?Talking safety aren’t we?  Trump gets the Dems to fall for the bait every time.   Why r mail in ballots already ❌ off for Dems in NJ ? This on news weeks gap
So you prefer Facism? That is the road Trump is going down.  I prefer the Democracy we already have and Trump and the GOP are trying to destroy!
How about an angry crowd of 200,000 gathers in Washington DC and overwhelms the White House and whisks Trump out so that he may find his destiny...
Where’s his mask ?   😷.   Another fraud.  Did I hear him say get the kids back to school.  Isn’t that what Trump has been saying for the last month ?   Pass the $600 now and get people there $$ Chucky.
If trump was pushing the all at the funeral it would be on CNN 24/7 wall to wall coverage saying how can this man say this stuff at a funeral.   But obama can say what he wants and gets no pushback from liberal media
we legit had a trump supporting white male steal a lobster out of the tank at work the other night and this was his response when the cops showed up 😂
This is a Southwest Florida thing: Trump and American flags hanging from the back of pickups. Along with the occasional Confederate flag. Moral of the story: Make sure you vote for Biden so truck guy will be even more unhappy.
This was posted in Nextdoor by an unhappy neighbor:  Theft. I was in the parking lot of Petco in Gulf center.  When I came out Someone had the guts to steal my Trump and American flag off the back of my truck. Moral of the story, look out for thieves in that parking lot!
It is my belief the Donald Trump is the direct result of Post Obama derangement syndrome.
Trump and the GOPare behaving beautifully. Overlooking all of Lewis' recent misbehaviour to respect his past. Obama on the other..goes full on political. There is a reason America is so disappointed. He reignited a race war..fucked up healthcare and threw up over foreign policy

You share a lot more than concern with President Trump... We wonder if you have sexual fantasies about him? Maybe you imagine yourself with him... The way the führer used to fantasize about the head of the SA, Ernst Rölm.  Adolf ❤️ Ernst
Before long it's going to be Trump hiding in the bunker because collectively the left is going to find their United States Grant before the election and Trump will be booed by 500000 Great American Africans from now until election day  He'll look outside his bedroom window &amp; see.
You do know that it was Obama that got the economy from 10% unemployment in 2008 to 4.5% in 2016.... Obama got it down 5.5%... Trump for it down 1%....

Trump as gospel
Just googled Pompeo again. I had forgotten what a well-educated &amp; experienced piece of trash he was. I guess because the 1st 2 qualities are not mandatory requirements for Trump appointments.
BREAKING:  Trump just told people to avoid crowded places.  He's only about 120 days late!  If he told people to do the same thing when he was holding his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Herman Cain would likely be alive today.  RIP Herman Cain.
It is not truth or even factual, it is a assumption, and is a irresponsible statement from a known Trump hater.
This is good news because dropping all charges was the Trump/Barr agenda, right? (Sorry, a bit behind w/this atrocious Trump scandal)
Imagine how many heads Trump lives rent free in.
And Jennifer Holliday, who backed out of performing at tRump’s inauguration, is singing. White House must be reeking of stinky orange fumes by now .
Who wants to bet tRump will try to use subjugation in a sentence?
Trump asks to have the election, that he is presently losing badly, be delayed so he can steal it.
It’s legitimacy was destroyed when Trump took office, but yes, I understand your point.
As President Obama, President Bush and President Clinton give eulogies at the John Lewis Funeral, President Trump sits on the toilet threatening to delay the election.  Wake the hell up America!  #JohnLewisMemorial
No mask, trump set the standard for the easily influenced followers!
Agreed. As atrocious as he is, Trump is a symptom, not the cause.
Trump lies
They are. Very dishonest. We know what their agenda is. That's why I'm completely baffled by a video with their name on it that makes Trump look bad. Something stinks.
That's a strawman argument, I never said Trump wasn't garbage, I'm saying Biden is also garbage with more blood on his hands &amp; more ruined lives in his wake than the talking Cheeto.🤷‍♂️  It's sad that you can't argue any positives for your preferred sex pest other than,"But Trump!"
And why did they stop travel throughout their country, but allowed travel abroad? Fentanyl shipments were suffering under Trump so send America this virus.  Should be concerned an act of war. #MAGA
President Trump killed Herman Caine. Blood on your hands.
Roger Stone, Alex Jones, Donald Trump are America’s greatest liars and false information spreaders
A Trump supporter
I'm a little disappointed with the group.  Last week I asked how many would join me in filing a "false advertising" claim with the FTC against the Trump campaign.  It's a federal crime to broadcast or print lies in advertising.  I got a grand total of 3 responses. Sad!
Bickering for months until Supreme Court rules due to confusion it wasn’t a fair election. Trump and Barr repeat every time election rescheduled. Civil War ensues, sadly our democracy dies along with 500,000 innocent Americans due to COVID.
People are vile &amp; most are bond servants to to partisanship. Man, the comments. 😞 1) People that wear masks and stay home are still dying. Ask me how I know.  2) The virus doesn’t care if you’re meeting for a “rally” or a protest.  3) They’re more like Trump than they realize
Public announcements from both sides continue and sow confusion in the electorate. Many Trump voters stay home and GOP heavy election locations do not open. Dems show up in force on Election Day and in mail in ballots to give Biden decisive landslide. Trump won’t concede.
Sounds to me that a likely scenario is Trump and Barr “announce” in late October the election is being delayed due to COVID safety concerns (which Trump has of course ignored COVID up to this point). Congress clearly asserts its power to squash the idea.
Everything trump touches eventually dies
Yeah. No. That's your wheelhouse. I mean it's got to be tough. You're wrong. About everything. You're stupid but you think you're smart. You imagine yourself a patriot, but deep down you know by supporting Trump you're a traitor. Of course you hate yourself.
Dude. He went to a trump rally, bragged about how he would not wear a mask, caught covid-19, suffered for a month, and died. You idiots are so bent on owning the libs, that you'll dream up conspiracy theories as you die, never admitting you might have been wrong.
Florida Dinah will vote for President Trump again 🇺🇸❤️😀
The GOP wants Melania &amp; Trump, who confuse garish with elegant &amp; gaudy with tasteful, to be in charge of redecorating the W.H.??? How embarrassing.
One thing I can say about President Bush is that I respect him as a person even though I disagree with him politically in every sense of the word.  I can NOT say the same for Trump.
I'm all for Trump but a delay is only prolonging this "rona" hypocrisy
I’m watching John Lewis’ service, listening to George Bush speak. I’m reminded, I didn’t care for him as a president but I love him as a person. I felt the same way about his father. Will anyone say that about Trump?

You forgot to mention it was contracted at a Trump rally where he refused to wear a mask. But then you only play at journalism.
President Trump said Florida is headed in the right direction a couple days ago.  This update goes against that.

Wrong. The radical left declared war against America after the 2016 election of Trump. Actions have consequences. Reap what you sow
I agree with you. Setting up his cult base to start a civil war. Trump is dangerous and it’s not funny anymore. Who is going to stop this craziness? Barr will be behind this also.

as much as I dislike Donald Trump, some of the responsibilities if not most of it goes to Ron DeSantis our lame governor.
Thank you Mr President Trump's.
I think I may vomit. Trump has no leadership ability at all but he does very well at living in a magical world in his mind detached from reality. He has narcissistic personality disorder and he is a sociopath.

I live in the suburbs.  There are plenty of people living in low-income housing.  Most of them voted for Trump in 2016.  Most of them would be homeless if not for “low-income housing.”  Most of them will now be voting Biden in 2020. #SuburbsForBiden
This entire narrative is so moronic but the media is full of morons so...🤷🏼‍♀️. Trump would pack up and live out the rest of his life as a billionaire semi-retiree with the love of his family, vacationing and unlimited golfing. This sounds lovely compared to what his life is now. 🙄
And that's why it's so critical that America get its head out of its ass and give Trump both another term and both houses..

This article was quite a read. The man obviously thinks Trump is a tool but his methodical review of #hydroxycholoroquine was illuminating. Thank you for sharing the article.

Actually Trump is a lot like then circles because he's f****** up everything around the world God knows what's going on in yeaman under his command... God knows what political assassinations he's ordering
Trump is a madman.
Stop killing people just because Trump said a drug showed promise.
Yeah he’ll help you out  Which way did you come in⁉️  Your not serious  You’ve got to be delirious SMH🤦‍♂️   The man is a clone lemming of tRUMP  Monkey see monkey do  Look at the stats of Florida NOW   Was great June 1st  But WHAT HAPPENED FROM THEN TILL NOW⁉️  Oh yes, the beaches
Again...I don’t often agree with Biden (or Trump) &amp; we may have varying visions of what succes ahead looks like...but this is still true! Many will tell you we are doomed specifically BECAUSE of our “heart” &amp; history. Ignore them.
The Trump administration and GOP also have no plan in place to deal with a continually declining birthrate, instead insisting "it will fix itself in time". Without plans in place to stabilize a decline, it will eventually lead to a deep crisis in our country, like that of Japan.
However, Social Security Chief Actuary Stephen Goss, a Bush-era financial advisor [for the Ways and Means Congressional committee] backed by the Trump administration, is still insisting on a favorable 2020 report that was made before the pandemic.

The briefings need NO Donald Trump &amp; none of his sycophants, including Dr. Birx. Otherwise, Americans should not waste time listening.
Trump is against low income housing in the suburbs.  That’s another way of saying Trump rather see homeless people in the suburbs. #RacistInChief
This pussy didn’t even stand up to the guy that killed our troops? Fuck yall trump supporters
Trump was so jealous of you throwing the pitch. He just can’t stand to be outdone. Nobody likes him bu hu hu
Trump screwed the farmers and paid them off with our tax dollars
That’s because he owes Russia over 500 million dollars and they have the hooker piss on him tape. He also owes China over 600 million dollars in loans . Trump is going broke, that’s why he keeps stealing from the government”emoluments”
Talk about our country going to shit. Let all republicans let their kids to grow up to be like trump if you really believe in him
But they remember who got them and us where we are today....Trump Hell

..a couple of news cycles before the next Trump outrage and the, shall we say active? anger of that same group? I'm not seeing it...
Why start now? You always put trump first! Nov. 3 dump trump!
It’s like a vicious cycle for Trump.  He screws up and then he gaslights us into believing it never happened.  Then he blames it on someone else.
The law that Trump got rid of encourages DEREGULATION in local zoning, which Trump's own HUD was in favor of in 2018. Classic GOP twisting themselves into intellectual pretzels to appeal to the base with "black people = poor and crime" messaging.
Brevard County has a joker of a County Sheriff a real Trump man... Dumbass rednecK  He's making a name for himself but we should have suspicions about the quality of policing in Brevard County Florida... These rednecks are tight and they go back generations

A trump advocate espousing on the dangers of actions regarding foreign policy...  ... Gd is watching
The comments made by Trump re his refusal to leave office if he looses the election are grounds for treason.

Calling this "insistence" inline with the ongoing Trump minion b.s.  You guys are the pros at exaggeration and lies
Trump knows his only hope of winning besides cheating is mobilizing his ignorant and/or racist base. That could be enough to continue minority rule if WE do not get out &amp; vote.
Trump’s back channel to Putin. What a country!!

OMG Trump is spewing trash on the news again. Its all about him
Hell yeah!  I'm voting for Donald Trump!!!!
A Federal Mask mandate has been issued for Every. Single. Country. that's "Flattened The Curve" saving lives, preventing economic disaster.  Trump and Republicans are ramping up debunked conspiracy theories to distract from their septic, idiotic failure #VoteByMailEarly #VoteBlue
Sleazy Donald Trump is just a Trojan Horse for Russia. He will do whatever they want!  Everything Trump accuses others of doing, he has done himself!  If you can’t see that, you are blind.
Thank you President Trump you care. You are the first President in my  67yrs that has put the citizens first. 2024 on your last day in office please leave the incoming administration directions why the People of the United States matter and the swamp doesn't
Tied? Biden &amp; Trump are only tied in Georgia polls??  That settles it, then. Georgia is the most ignorant of the sister states (Georgia &amp; Florida) on a % basis.
So much this.  I honestly can't understand their campaign strategy, they are running to the right of Trump on several issues and telling not just their base, but well over half the entire country to pound sand on several major policies.  I can only assume they want to lose?🤔😖
I lost most respect &amp; all trust in the Pentagon when they defended &amp; supported bringing back landmines. Also no objection to funds diverted to border wall or Trump’s dumb parades.
As of today,  the trump 2020 virus  hss killed 151,000 American's
Whatever you do, don't let #RacistInChief start trending, because Donald Trump might get his feelings hurt.
Since Trump has no real political allies  nor organization, the Koch forces filled the Executive and Cabinet structures. Win-win for Koch.
The propaganda starts from above as an intentional lie from Stephen Miller, Bannon, Trump, Barr &amp; ilk,  then spreads like wildfire via ignorance &amp; stupidity.
Trump came out a while back and said he was revoking Brennan’s security clearance. That was public info. I haven’t seen anything about the rest of these clowns.
#Gohmert tests positive for Covid19 after #BarrHearing- before flying with Trump. #Barr, #JimJordan, #AndyBiggs, #MikeJohnson and other republicans refused to wear a mask.   This is why we vote brainless and irresponsible OUT! #VoteBlue2020 #VoteByMail
The Dem clown show was disgusting. These Simple Simon’s showed their true colors. Incapable of having an intelligent discussion with AG Barr they resorted to shutting him down. Trump 2020.
Seriously Lori,  Everytime I heard a Democrat speak, all I could hear was a mean fart bag exploding.  You are so right, they are mean, cold, obnoxious and not for protecting our rights for protection.  All they care about is trying to fake making Trump lk bd
Good luck with that! Trump should cut all federal funding to that city period.
How on earth can you make such a wildly generalized statement when there are millions of Trump supporters?!  And actually, the divide comes when the Deep State abuses and kills our children.  Step out of your box.
“A picture is worth a thousand words.” Sometimes. Other times it’s just dumb af, like tRump supporters.
Please don’t do that stupid and transparently partisan thing where you oppose Trump’s decision to bring some troops home cuz you hate the man. You don’t have to celebrate it. Just let it happen.
Trump, the biggest orange head WHINER ever, Fox now tells the facts, and you hate the facts
exactly so go do some research. I have. Facts don’t lie. Trump has helped minorities more than any other president “sugar”. He’s not racist, Joe Biden is super racist but you won’t admit that. Joe Biden has called a former kkk member a mentor &amp; he’s put MANY minorities in Jail!
Trump
Anything the Trump touches is for his and cronies benefit only.
via  Redeploy them out to secure our national parks trump wants to destroy!!!!
Not that I want the GOP to win a single seat, anywhere in November. But they’ve got to be seriously replacing Trump at the top of the ticket.
Stay strong Adam. Your a great man. We need more like you at the Capital before we lose what democracy we have left. Trump must resign now before he starts a civil war. People are scared
Rep. Louie Gohmert tests positive for coronavirus, cancels Trump trip
Because Putin has some bad shit on trump. Taxes money Eric trump said they get all the money they need from Russia. I believe they have a bad tape with trump and Russian hookers. He will continue to kiss Putin’s ass
BREAKING: President Trump just defended Russia arming the Taliban against US Troops, claiming that America also armed the Taliban so they could fight Russia.  If this isn’t treason, I don’t know what is!  Trump chooses Russia over America EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
It’s “socialism” when Democrats do this but it’s heroic when Trump does it.
What’s your point? I should vote for Trump? Good luck with that.😷

Trump wants to kill social media because he doesn’t like people making fun of him.  That’s how shallow our President is.
Trump’s government bought 62 million doses of hydroxyquine. If we sell one dose to every trump supporter for 12 bucks we’ll have money to increase testing for the rest of us. One dose each probably won’t hurt them too much.
I have a new handle for the Trump/ Pence team.  Abbot &amp; Costello meet Frankenstein.   They also met the werewolf and visited Mars.
Herman Caine remains on oxygen after Tulsa Trump rally.
Even Trump is too Fascist for Fox News!
Trump’s just mad because Joe Biden took press questions and Fox News covered it.  BTW Biden looked awesome!
If you really want to see Democrats heads explode, President Trump should issue a permanent travel ban to and from China.
Ugh! If I’m going to buy a book from a Trump...  it will be from the only honest one ...called Mary!!!’
why didn't you tell us all that you are the number 3 or 4 African American who will vote for Trump, oh and if you have daughters don't let them near Trump
So a one-way-street who has been bashing Trump for years has thoughts? Zzzzzzzzzzz
Based on statistics, my 1st thought is: “Most likely the work of the violent right wing trump supporters”. I do not condone no matter who is responsible .
Coronavirus outbreak: Live updates and news for July 29, 2020  via
And send them to other cities to occupy before the election. But first we will have a massive military parade to show Americans not to protest the trump administration!
NATO is an alliance for Russian deterrence. It is in the best interest of US national security to maintain it, not to mention European regional security. Trump making this out to be a punishment for Germany is ridiculous. Watch for a more aggressive Russia.
In fact, these aren't peaceful protestors at all. They're very Crminally Violent Marxist ANTIFA &amp; BLM Rioters. That's why a Republican President Trump of this Great Nation has done what Democrat Mayors and Governor's failed to do. That is; Uphold the Law. No excuses.
You’re going down liar you’re no match for President Trump

That would be a concern. One other is that Kodak has had a huge brain drain due to 40 years of egregious business decisions. It is not the company Trump probably remembers from the 60s
That’s true. Trump’s failing and looking for anything to distract attention away from him.
Incompetent Trump has killed over 100,000 Americans by intentionally ignoring COVID and refusing to stop Putin from killing our troops. I'll take Joe any day over your corruption, laziness and ignorance. #PutinOwnsTrump
Imagine having to block trump supporters because you have no argument whatsoever and talk to hear your self speak
Diving further into the bizzare abyss of  Trump’s protectorate, let’s clarify a few things 1) taking down wild, misleading video is good 2) nothing is caused by demon anything 3) decrying political interference w/medicine thru a spectacle supported by partisans is projection
Trump is so much in bed with Putin I believe he won't touch this man simply for the fact of money and lots of it. When he gets defeated don't be surprised if he packs his family to avoid prosecution and moves in with Putin!!!
So far the Trump supporters I know have not changed their opinion on him. They think he is great and doing a great job. They blame the media and truly don’t think the virus is as serious as the media says
Sleazy Donald Trump is just a Trojan Horse for Russia. He will do whatever they want!
Thought he lived up Trump's butt.Clearly, Trump doesn't understand how the Constitution works but someone around him does - therefore, 8 hours later, he holds a press conference in complete opposition of  his original tweet.  Question is, can he still be impeached given his "retraction?"
ask Trump how it feels to go through life like that
A write-in is prob same as a vote for Trump. In the past it wasn’t as important to vote for 1 or the other, &amp; years ago I actually wrote in in 2 diff elections. But this election is too important to waste a vote on someone who won’t win. Don’t be a coward.
😂. On the other hand I naturally starting sobbing when Trump talks too... Tears of laughter and my ears 🤕

Trump finally said something today that I agree with. He said the virus should have been stopped. Absolutely right. It should have been but you were too busy calling it a hoax and saying it would magically go away. Trump is to blame. He had a chance to control it and failed
5-6 years ago if you told me Trump would win presidency &amp; say/tweet all the things he's said/done...I would've never believed any of it. Not to mention, I would never think he'd get away with any of it...but here is 2020 for ya
must be stopped.

Maybe just maybe hear me out solomani was in bed with Hillary and Obama so they fed trump administration false info to kill him tying up loose ends 🤔 of course we don't have the proof but very interesting
I’m gonna call it 3 months early. Trump loses the election and blames it on the DNC messing with mail-in votes. Then proceeds to go on a rampage with his followers, all while having no evidence.
Does anyone besides me get nauseated, and angry when they see Trump ?
That’s to be expected from a Trump groupie, they’re all the same, #DeathSantis, Marco, Yoohoo, and gaetz.
We are dropping off our mail-in ballots before Election Day at a designated place. We don’t trust Trump and the Rs not to try to interfere with USPS. 🌊
I don't think the school stuff has anything to do with anything but this: Kids have been home for the summer. If they have to stay home longer, child care must be accounted for. Even under the best scenarios, parents will want to hand Trump his ass in this election. Kids4votes.
If I die here in Florida, the thing I would ask is that everyone remembers Governor DeSantis has followed trump's advice on the pandemic every step of the way.  #DeSantisResign #DeSantisiskillingus #DeSantisFailedFlorida
With the senior population more susceptible to Covid-19, mail-in ballots would actually help Trump. It's not about who's in office. I'm against blanket mailing of ballots to voters whether they requested it or not.
Trump is the master of deflection. Which his “delay the election” antic, is he deflecting from what?
My blood pressure is rising as i listen to Trump say he can postpone the election, not accept the results, and ruin the USPS so we cant vote by mail! Wtf are we going to do?
Just like the NYT’s article about Trump and George Wallace jist happened to be published today when Obama launches the same attack at a funeral service!
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via   #ConstitutionorTrump #WeWillVote #AmericaOrTrump
So Biden was correct to predict that the Liar in Chief would bring it up? trump's entire presidency - every lie, every drop of his epic incompetency - is ripe for a 'scathing denunciation.'
Meanwhile asswipe trump wallows in his own feces daily.
I'm gonna agree with Trump about something. Do. Not. Trust. The. #USPS . If you can vote in person, do it!
Thank you Sir. You would gain respect from Democrats like me who have voted for you if you specifically voiced your disagreement with President Trump’s floating the idea of delaying the election. Other Republican LEADERS have done so.
Absolutely 100% agreed here!!!  Former Bush adviser endorses Trump to 'give conservatives a robust majority on the Supreme Court' | Conservative Institute
He’s going to need them Bc post offices will b closed that’s what trump is doing he’s warning the republicans not to mail ballots

Agreed! I’ve been a silent cheerleader for them. I don’t trust that they’re not going to flip the script after Trump is out and start pushing money toward electing Republicans, so I don’t give them money, but I love that their current goal is the same as ours.
I have no doubt Trump would like to delay the election that he's going to lose. I also think he's trying to deflect from the news that he's giving Putin a pass on paying the Taliban to kill U.S. soldiers, and that Trump has horrifically mishandled #COVID19 &amp; our economy.

My understanding is the Trump’s term expires at noon on January 20. Pence’s term also expires. So if we don’t have a presidential election, the speaker of the house (Pelosi) would become president.   This is why I don’t understand Trump’s delaying talk.

Trump can’t delay the election - and I don’t think it’s in his interest to do so becaaue his term expired on January 20, 2021 but I’ll defer to experts on that. Elections are run by individual states.

Trump wants to be a dictator. Fight for our democracy. The President does not have the power to delay the election. Register to vote, get your absentee ballot, send your ballot in early to ensure it gets counted.
Trump voted by absentee ballot folks!  He already sent it!  What a two faced liar!
So Trump is basicly an Arsonist? Setting fires, getting off on watching them burn, then claiming he is the hero putting them out!

#RepublicansForBiden I am a conservative R who did not vote Trump in 16. As a High School History teacher I fear for our democracy. If elected Trump will push this country into another civil war and further erode the foundations this country was formed by. Vote blue Nov. 3!!!!

Imagine what life would be like right now if Trump had used the Defense Production Act to make N-95 masks, enough for every man, woman, &amp; child in America. We’d be back to normal life by now.
BUT then Trump said, He's NOT withdrawing from Portland, and there'll be all kinds of reports but DON'T believe them!! I guess it depends on his mood at the time, for their sake, though I hope so!!
It's very late at night and I'm awake again. It is so evident our country will be destroyed if Trump is re-elected. So why is it even a question? I spent my entire life helping children in public schools as a teacher and a principal. How can anyone think of re-electing this man?

I think it’s time for me leave Facebook. It’s so full of negativity. The constant posts are overwhelming, Covid, trump, battles on the steeets, it’s all so negative. Meanwhile the consistent same people post negative life situations cause by themselves frequently.
This is just why I say people puke out horrible statements then turn around and try to apologize.  That just doesn't work for me. You are an adult you knew it was wrong. So for me your apologie is unacceptable.  Just comment on trump.

You don't have to worry about Trump.
According to strategists in a think tank like panel, they are planning different scenarios that trump can do.  He said Trump holds so much power that it’s going to be a challenge. He said troops on the street right now are his dry run for the election.
Trump has all the power and he is showing it little by little.  He will have military in the streets to prevent voting.

Haha ! You still don’t think Trump is nuts! Tell him he can throw out the 1st pitch at the Brooklyn Dodger opener Thursday at Ebbetts Field -probably has dreams of Phil Rizzutto dancing in his head🤡

Not to mention after complaining that the Democrats in the last bill tried to keep Kennedy Center people paid , this time Republicans added close to $2 billion for a new FBI building in DC. Purpose is to prevent a hotel  being on that site in competition to Trump Hotel
One thing we can know for sure, Barr like Trump..if their mouth’s open they are lying
Mary Trump's "Too Much and Never Enough"
All countries that successfully controlled the virus had a NATIONAL plan. Trump pushed states to open prematurely, remember “liberate Michigan”? But now he puts militia in Portland unrequested by the Governor. So which is it? Governors in charge or not? Bullshit!
Not in TRUMP’S home state. Florida is a political war zone. CALL TO ACTION.
I was considering this, Trump will have taken probably a year of my life due to his inaction on the coronavirus. A year of not seeing my children, my friends...He is and always has been an incompetent. Those in doubt of this, just listen to him, read his tweets, note his actions.
EVERYTHING Trump has done or attempted to do is the "deal of the century " and a massive failure well before his insane presidency. Conservatives have always buried us and  relied on democrats to dig us out.This is worse than usual however Biden will do it.
We only speak truth to Trump. He’s earned every deserved insult, criticism and and judgment made against him.  And so much more!!! We can’t wait until you are gone from the presidency and gone so the rest of the work never has to see you again.
That’s because it happened under Obama ! Not trump
Light foot needs to change her tune and ask for help. She cannot do it herself! She hates Trump so much she would rather see children die!   Chicago residents tell Lawrence Jones city, state leaders need to step up, help end violence

You sound crazy!  Trump is a billionaire that didn’t need to be president, he didn’t need the headaches, he didn’t need the harassment, he didn’t need the bullying that he’s dealt with from the fake media!
Speak truth!!  These sleeping sheep just don’t get it!  The see what their mayor and governors are doing but yet they blame trump!  Some people are going to stay dumb that’s just a fact!
disappointed in our DOJ allowing Obama Administration to Spy on President Trump &amp; commit perjury &amp; waste millions on a Fake Russian Dossier. Barr will be remembered as another Sessions.
Not a mystery but why would you ever speak truth to the American people!  Those of us who follow Trump we knew this was coming two years ago!!  You keep lying to America!  Foolish!

Never regain power for decades with generation x, z and to follow..  start a new party..if it’s not too far right wing I might convert.  More has to be done.  Trump is trying to put a demise to the post office because of mail on votes.  I think I might lose my mind.
No way the media will cover for him
Donamd Trump is still an Impeached President. Cut the crap Gym.
Make sure the usually short sided Democrat campaign knows how to protect our elections. You know it’s a Putin/Trump election.  They destroyed Hillary. We better get this right.
Class is beyond politics. Which is why the Bidens paid tribute to Lewis and Trump left town.
Actually Coulter might have jumped ship. Satan was griping about Trump's incompetence.
He did pay his respects by not attending. We can’t handle more Trump shit shows....they are constant anyway
Not necessary to have Trump throwing bull at Joe putting him on the   defensive We know which is a patriot, intelligent,compassionate, not a racist has a SOUL!
We love President Trump and will be re-electing him.
I would agree with you.  I'm not sure that Biden has the will or (whatever) to do real-time fact checking of Trump during the debate.  He should pass.

#TrumpEliminatesPostOfficesToStopVoting Report on CNN by voter rights expert Ross Berman,the reason Trump intends shutting every post office down is to stop votes by mail,&amp; fact vote by mail is very safe but people wait last minute to send &amp; overwhelm post office.Send right away
Well  trump hates women also but 43% of white women support him. Explain that to me
Every traditional Republican understands that mail in / absentee voting is a Republican strong point.    But trump  was  a Democrat all his life, so of course he does not understand that.
Divino! 👌 Trump read my thoughts
Along with other 60000 deaths after reopening...Trump beats Milosevic, Idi Amin, Pinochet.. he wants to get to at least 10Th place on the Murderous Dictator list. #TrumpVirus
He passed away from the Trump Virus. After the first 5K deaths Trumps owns the virus and every victim's thereafter, including Herman Cain passing.
Herman Cain did not believe in wearing a mask, Trump did believe in wearing a mask.  Wearing a mask protects you from getting the virus, not completely but it help's tremendously.  He died because of the virus and supporting Trump's belief's #TrumpKillsAmericans
Trump supporters assume they are the “smart people” in this instance.  They are not. Not now. Not ever.
I am not sure if I should believe what you're saying. Say that now and say something else in the end is not the same. You called Trump a conman.and now you're bossom buddies..thanks but no thanks.
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.

He doesn’t know how to pronounce the word plasma. Another word he doesn’t know how to pronounce is Remdisivir. Obvioulsly he won’t  pronounce it right because it’s the first time he talked about it. Dr. Fauci has been talking about it for 6 months vs.Trump’s hydroxycloraquin. Smh

Trump can't pronounce plasma, release my taxes, emoluments, Deutsche Bank, faithful, truth, I love my wife or Russian bounties on US soldiers. 🙄
Police brutality , That IS criminal activity.  tRump abuses his power, THAT is criminal activity.  Stone lies in court, THAT is criminal activity.  Cohen goes to jail for commiting crimes on individual 1, yet individual 1 walks, THAT is criminal activity, and the list. Now STFU.
Trump can't pronounce basic words like plasma 🙄 "plausma" 🤦🏻‍♀️
His briefing is nauseating.  I want to throw bricks at the tv for his utterly outrageous claims of voter fraud.  Suggestion:  Since according to him an "absentee ballot" is fine, everyone needs to request one so he'll shut up.
When I see #Apple news! lol Has anyone taken a bigger kick to the financial groin than #Apple for Trump confronting China.
Trump is setting up to nullify the November 3 Election. He’s saying it might take months and years before we find out who won. Folks, we need to hit the streets as soon as possible.
Trump does not deny that he wants to delay the election in November.
Trump bought the Miss America contest for access to young girls. And he’s clearly out of his mind.  And you’re a hypocrite and a fool.
Watching his propaganda news briefing, Trump said that things in Florida is getting better. Yesterday some 264 died and today, we’ll over 250 from COVID-19. How can he lie and the Fox crowd blelieves him. They are complecit in his crimes.
Trump, mcconnell and barr should be tried for treason as soon as possible.
Fauci is a self-serving political operative,  who enjoys sanctification given him by Democrats,  Mainstream media- Trump haters
I do like Republicans at least most of them but... wow Trump supporters are literally a bunch of cult members who can't think for themselves. Pure sheep. This isn't even a D vs R thing it's literally common sense vs ignorance.

Analysis | Trump’s Four-Pinocchio interview on Russian bounties By Salvador Rizzo
Trump may not be eloquent by anyone’s standards, but he is a prodigious liar.
This pathetic b/c you killed him!  Trump mourns 'American Patriot, and great friend' Herman Cain
We didn’t deserve this type of health, economic, and political climate that Trump carelessly and recklessly led us to. If he is smart he’ll step down. I hear Roger Stone has room for another tattoo on his back.  Trump can end up as a tattoo on Stones back, if not it’ll be worse!
Charlie, all Trump does is lie, and self-aggrandize, and talk like the fascist he is.
I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.
Call me crazy, but i think this is Trump coded speak for "dont worry i will keep POC out of your neighborhood."
That would be a lie. Trump IS a full blown racist.
What’s shocking is just the utter disrespect. I mean, Trump flat out told reporters “no” he wouldn’t be going to pay respects to John Lewis.
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...

If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.

I just asked was he a hateful person, I looked up the word in the dictionary first but I wondered why John Lewis was viewed as hateful. So I asked about Trump to see how someone could say John was hateful but Trump wasn't. Its not that complicated.
It is! Stage one was COVID19- China virus. Remember Chinese government officials net wit President Trump's administration and President Trump, before we even found out about Coronavurus.

Trump’s becoming a pariah. The way his kind should be treated....instead of allowed to be President.
No joke, Trump is getting off on this - the moment he realized he could tweet praise for a different black guy who just died on the same day he planned on blowing off respect for John Lewis, I’m sure a big smug grin crossed his face and he dove for his phone.
RIP to #HermanCain who died from COVID after attending a Trump rally without a mask. Not intending this as a “gotcha” at all, but a plea to anti-maskers to maybe reconsider the whole mask thing.
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.
Q: Did Herman Cain tweet that masks would not be required at Trump's controversial Tulsa rally? And was that tweet subsequently deleted?  A: Yes.
Onmy under President Trump's guidelines,  cutting red tape , in such short period of time Vaccine is in such advanced stages of Development
for the love of  can someone tell trump how to pronounce "plasma"  its not plausema
so I'm guessing trump wasn't at the funeral.....
Amazing how you and Cain and Trump and conservatives can say whatever they want, no matter how despicable, but God forbid someone criticizes a conservative, she is labeled hateful, no matter how valid the criticism. Look in the mirror.
And MBS as well, but I totally agree about Putin too. Trump is coddling all the foreign dictators &amp; tyrants from North Korea, to   Russia, to Saudi. Time to shut down Rizvi &amp; Milner. Don’t let these foreign tyrants buy up our social media. Down with fascism! #bringbackbetter
He died from the Trump Virus. You neglected to write that.
Doesn't take nerve,nor are they unaware or unconcerned.....they are the lowest common denominators a.k.a. ignorant racist trump supporters
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Is Trump a hateful person?
I actually think the humiliating loss would lead to him not really returning to the job for those two months. His only agenda is “Trump.” He doesn’t care about what Mitch might want.   I think he’ll spend December stuffing money into suitcases and arranging to leave the USA.
To encourage them all to use the free filters provided to all Flint residents? Yeah I remember that. Man, I miss the days when that was the worst thing you could come up with against a president.   My turn:
Why didn't trump share his hydroxychloroquine with Herman Cain? He could have saved him.🤔
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now—you won’t get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone’s ideas before we vote.

That makes me feel better. I just don’t trust trump and Barr, two truly evil people.
Not if it’s that crazy lady that is touting hydroxycloraquin which is shown to do more harm than good for COVID. Trump has a stake in the company that produces is; a Saudi company based in Malta where patent law is non existent. Trump is trying his best to move America backwards!
It’s easy.  For trump Cain became another useless black man.
They call him “Rudy” and he used to be Trump’s lawyer before unfrozen caveman Frankenstein (Barr) took over.
And don tRump was a Democrat at two different times in his overprivlaged life of affluenza
Trump wants everyone to safely vote?But he's rushing the schools to open?Yeah right..

actually, the districts and electoral college helps the republicans because of gerrymandering. clinton got 2.8 million MORE votes than trump, and she still lost. and the dems ACTUALLY care about the people and districts, unlike republicans.
Cant sue the Trump campaign for it, unless he signed the NDA the Gen Z/KPOP signed online🤣🤣🤣 For rhe supporters who did not attend the rally, please express your generosity to the teenagers for saving your bloody lives from the hoax.

Obama used the politics that Lewis lived for in his eulogy which is deeply appropriate and seems to be what Lewis would have done. If people see that waving the banner of voting rights as anti-trump… well… I think that might say more about the president than anything else.

W  very mediocre President, good human being. trump horrible president, horrendous human being.
Just say nothing Trump could do would be worse to you than supporting legalized abortion and be done with it.
Thats a random thing to say 🤔

He downplayed the pandemic called a hoax. Donald Trump is not fit to be president. He FIALED
If you don’t like lying, you must hate Donald Trump, who gets caught in a public lie about once a day.   Do you smell burning toast? Is your left arm numb?
Well said.  Funny how the democrats drop their liberal facade and go full warmonger when Trump brings home the troops.

me going out to my kitchen to throw some shit away and my mom and sister are talking about how great trump is and how Biden and Bernie are communists. Then my sister told my mom i don’t support trump. My mom got so mad LOOOL I hate it here
On a side note - it’s very weird that Trump keeps referring to the virus as though it’s something most people are not familiar with.
James,  "Cases" in the video again today like Obama's virtual videos  Trump, Open &amp; shut Case
This is how you dudes that worship trump look like when you go to the pool
P.S. Appropriate that Bolton's image adorns the above link. This is the result of his thinking. So you'll forgive me that I rolled my eyes when everyone was going goo-goo for his sudden turn as an anti-Trump "patriot" while making millions on a book.
Trump Demands That All Election Results Be Known On Election Night
A new book by  journalists takes you behind the scenes at Trump's Mar-a-Lago and into a bizarre world where politics and national security matters spill out into full view of club members.   Read an excerpt from "The Grifter's Club" here:
#TrumpEliminatesPostOfficesToStopVoting Report on CNN by voter rights expert Ross Berman,the reason Trump intends shutting every post office down is to stop votes by mail,&amp; fact vote by mail is very safe but people wait last minute to send &amp; overwhelm post office.Send right away
Biden is an angry old man.  I have NEVER heard Trump curse at a constituent.   Bet this group is voting TRUMP2020!  Detroit auto worker who Biden snapped at over guns speaks out on  via
They know nothing will come from their statement.  They are saying that now so that when trump is out they can say "we stated we disagreed with him".  CYA. Thats all it is.
Every internal move Trump is making demonstrates a real decline in popularity. And they know it.
Buy stamps &amp; other post office supplies, YES! But we should temporarily stop mailing anything unless absolutely needed.  is short-staffed due to #COVID19 &amp; Louis DeJoy ordered cuts. We need to reduce volume to allow postal workers to process voter ballots in spite of Trump.
This is actual Brownshirt shit. Building dossiers on journalists as though they are criminals. This is the end-run result of Trump calling the press the “enemy of the people.”
Lmao now this is about trump? Girl just say you hate Nicki and call it a day.
The Constitutional Case Against Trump’s Use of the Department of Homeland Security is going to be a hot messy process
This is actually a very dishonest tweet. There is no proof Hermain Cain got the virus from his rally, its all speculation. Not, only that but to say Trump, "made wearing a mask political" is bullshit. The media made this all political from the get go!! not Trump. Be honest dude
We all got a chance to ur guy Trump make a fool of himself
Some of them are dying of Corona Virus because they follow the advice of dumb people like Mr. Trump!
Vote Trump!  Don't forget the 3 strikes you're out policy by Clinton which created insane levels of black incarceration!
Needless to say, it was disappointing to hear. All the red roses that vow to not vote for Joe but yet they don't want Trump. What do they figure will happen?
we tried to deface a “trump 2020” graffiti by writing “sucks” over the 2020 but we didn’t do it dark enough cuz ppl were coming so now it looks like it says TRUMP SOCKS
The Trump Family is known for their NDA’s and that should not count
Trump's hunger to lie more is never satiated.
Maduro is asking me to tell you if you can build something that float like a raft with a sail so you can sail from the us to Venezuela...you could refuel in cuba and keep sailing down here. Bu hurry up b4 Trump the dictator put you in jail
Trump 2020!
Trump is so jealous b/c he knows he will never be  As respected as they are. Not even close.

I must say Trump managed to change the subject from the serious unemployment situation and the worst GDP in history.
The plan for autocracy is set in motion...
Trump’s smile better than mine 😂
The podium stood erect as Obama trash 🗑 talked President Trump and Obama contemplation private pillow talk with John Lewis , even the casket edged up. Soul mates no pun
Every traditional Republican understands that mail in / absentee voting is a Republican strong point.    But trump  was  a Democrat all his life, so of course he does not understand that.
Kodak is switching to produce drug ingredients and received a multimillion dollar loan from the Trump administration
Trump is not a hipocrat,  remember how Mr.lewis behave during the inauguration, never recognized his victory,  and boycott the event. ....plus the impeachment, hard to forget too.
All after trump’s executive order authorizing #NoVisaRequiredTravel to and from Poland!!! 🇵🇱   Now, we have FACELESS THUGS, THAT DO NOT SPEAK AND CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED, ROAMING OUR STREETS.   Gee, I wonder why?
#BLMprotest ran up to the last election and then immediately disappeared after #Trump was elected. Now that he is up for re-election we have protests again that will also immediately end once the election is over. Can you all see the puppets hand in the sock? I can. #blm.
Biden was giving a hypothetical, knowing Trump will do whatever he can to “fix” the election. Trump, if he could, would actually do it!!
With out Trump this country will be another Venezuela
Let's track the Trump $$ some more. $600K seems small beans compared to what we can find on
He’d use the loss of his family to manipulate potential donors into contributing to Trump. #DeSantisResignNow
And BTW Kim, did you ever get the money Parscale owed you for promoting Trump, because it’s not like you do this because you truly want him to win, right Kim?  The only way you’ll promote him is if he pays you to promote him.
Not Biden, his handlers will refuse to debate Trump. They have been looking for a way out. That's why they keep him in the baseman.
People, the owners of  are not Americans, they came from Australia 25 years ago to fuck us up, and spread colonial racism in our country, not to mention lies and Pandemic misinformation, without them, no Trump presidency, and no 150,000 people dead #DyingForTrump
--&gt; Horrible numbers came out today --&gt; John Lewis was eulogized by 3 presidents. --&gt; Obama killed it. Trump didn't go. Sent nobody.  --&gt; Herman Cain died prob because he attended Trump's Tulsa Rally. --&gt; Repubs have no $ plan.  ... &amp; trump diverts by trying to postpone election.
Trump isn't the one who's setting crime records in Chicago, and he's not the one causing the civil unrest. That was your MAYOR! Might want to ask her why she hates our country.
I think it's much more likely that Trump is not actually engaged in the struggle that the Qanon people think he is.  Powerful pedophiles exist, in almost every major institution worldwide, but Trump isn't fighting them.
Divino! 👌 Trump read my thoughts
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.  #unconstitutional
Isn’t it sad that Trump had NICER things to say about Herman Cain than he did John Lewis?
Trump inauguration walkout song.
When Trump wins re-election with mail in ballots, will the opposition question the integrity of the election? Anyone who says no is either ignorant or intellectually dishonest.
Funny how tRump learned so much about the minutiae of the entire nation’s voting systems just by trailing in the polls.
U tell me nothing i don't know but seem unaware that  Dems are less uninformed re early treatment. Science requires open-minds. Accepting all Fauci sez on faith, &amp; accepting prevention of RX's &amp; censorship is authoritarianism. It kills people &amp; pushes independents toward Trump.
“We are closing all doors.” The Trump administration goes after Cuban bank in London.
Doctors stand behind President Trump, call for reopening America thanks ...  via
Don’t be impressed with them. Just enjoy the floor crumble under the Trump campaign.
Almost $3T in Trump's 4 years.
1,529 people died today in the United States due to COVID-19 and we had 70k new cases.  That’s the highest number of deaths recorded since May 14th.  Trump’s incompetence is killing thousands of people.
Russians really don't like Putin. They follow him hoping for scraps. And they hate Trump. They think he's a fucking clown like we do And having Trump around would only intensify that.   No Russia is a trailer park with nuclear weapons.
Lol? I criticize Trump on the daily. Shut the hell up. It has nothing to do with gender.
Along with other 60000 deaths after reopening...Trump beats Milosevic, Idi Amin, Pinochet.. he wants to get to at least 10Th place on the Murderous Dictator list. #TrumpVirus
He passed away from the Trump Virus. After the first 5K deaths Trumps owns the virus and every victim's thereafter, including Herman Cain passing.
Because it’s all about Trump. Never mind that Barron won’t be going to brick and mortar school come September, but we have to send all our kids?!?!  #TrumpHatesScience #TrumpKillsAmericans   👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼
Don’t trust them. Don’t ever. But if they collectively abandon Trump it’s lights out at Trump campaign HQ. Like there’s no money and no point to continue.
Trump talked about the re-infestation in foreign countries vs. how good we are doing in the US. You know the next step is his claims a total lockdown would have been useless.
We all expected Trump to threaten to delay the election, right? This shouldn’t come as a surprise, but it should continue to motivate us to act.
why has Trump not been given a psychological evaluation?
Not only that but all the media outlets inferred he contracted the virus after attending a Trump rally with no evidence.
Trump doesn’t joke, even when he’s making fun of people. Have you ever even seen him laugh?
According to MSM Trump reneged on delaying the Election! All of America is on his ass!
No shjt. You Republicans still don’t get Trump do you.   He did it so democrats would say people can get out and vote
And dems so shocked that Trump is concerned.   Amazing.   4 LA men admit to Skid Row voter-fraud scheme, DA announces
Oh, they will be. Then you'll find just how much of a shell game the Trump empire really was. I'm betting he actually worth from 5 to 10% of what he says. Everything else is leveraged up the heinie.
Best mask ever! #trump #mask #virus #coronavirus
Y’all, if Trump lost Fed Soc...
Herman Cain did not believe in wearing a mask, Trump did believe in wearing a mask.  Wearing a mask protects you from getting the virus, not completely but it help's tremendously.  He died because of the virus and supporting Trump's belief's #TrumpKillsAmericans
I’d vote for Mickey Mouse before I vote for Trump.
#ObamaWasBetterAtEverything Obama had some smooth BS . Likeable on the surface which Trump really isn’t good at . Policy wise. No comparison
Madness. How convenient.. there’s a new post master that was hired by the trump administration..
His "Secret Service" isn't going to get near him with the actual USSS puting up a fight. And Park Police (uniformed USSS agents). And the US Marshals. And DC Police. And that's all before the military get to the scene.  Trump ain't got the stones to put up a fight.
Ted Suhl, a manager at Southeastern Asset Management, the largest shareholder of KODK with 55.3% ownership position had his bribery prison sentence commuted by Trump last year. This week Kodak  up 2,189% after  Trump backs pivot into drug industry.
You know Obama is a criminal, and the entire left has been filling people minds with lies about Trump. You're just a sad case of TDS! You also know John Lewis was a racist himself, and he did NOTHING for his city. Period but make himself rich.
To who? Putin isn't that vain. He's not going to keep Trump around as a prize.
Yes i do but I'm just saying, having biden would be the worse choive to have as president. No police, segregation may make a comeback, far more blacks in jail. You can say what you want about trump but before covid or in this the chinese virus, he was doing great
Trump supporters assume they are the “smart people” in this instance.  They are not. Not now. Not ever.
Republicans flat-out reject Trump’s suggestion to delay election  via
If he did, then why wouldn't he say so? Trump seems to say everything that's on his mind.
Yea i feel you Trump is a racist apologist at best. But he can think all he wants. Our checks and balances are too solid. Cuba was easy pickings with so many living in dier circumstances. I miss BO...I'm getting nostalgic lol
That's it in a nutshell. Putin has no loyalty to him. He drop Trump like an 80# bag of cement. And then call in all of his loans. Mar-A-Lago might be on the market sometime next year.
trump visit KODK fact. KODK secured loan to produce pharmaceuticals(hydroclorowhatever). stock then quadruples. Y’all don’t see these drugs are just money in they pockets.
I am not sure if I should believe what you're saying. Say that now and say something else in the end is not the same. You called Trump a conman.and now you're bossom buddies..thanks but no thanks.
Dear white supremacist Nazi, the  is coming for you in 2021, you are only out of jail because of Trump, when he's gone, so will you.

Yeah no I can tell you’re not a Trump supporter lol. Yes, there are many individuals on both sides of the spectrum whom are a danger to our democracy. It’s been known that there was voter fraud in the 2016 election. American laws will never be like Cuba, however, we have a...

I caught Obama talking as I walked by the TV today and I wondered what political event he was speaking at. Then I realized it was a funeral. And they say Trump is classless.
Trump will deport them in due time. When you enable Nazis they always wind up turning on you eventually.
No, there’s no praising them. But it might be a signal to all the conservative judges that they aren’t obligated to support Trump.
My man. I'm no Trump supporter. Didn't vote for him and I dont plan to. But you think he is the only one talking about the validity of our democracy? Both sides attack it as it suites them. Remember how Russia got Trump elected? Trump cant be Castro because America can't be Cuba.
If you believe in Karma, then Trump is in a lot of trouble.
The CIA committed treason. I can prove it. The FBI is just trying to do their jobs and enforce the federal law. Sad to see their probe of Trump collusion in Russia go down the drain over errors in procedure. Comey shouldn’t have been fired, bottom line. Trump tries stifling FBI
Yeah but Trump is not popular (due to his own putrid actions) surely that is more meaningful than either of those things
I agree, I do not vote by mail, only in person and for the record, I vote for Donald Trump, that will not change, a letter came to my house to vote by mail without my name on the outside or inside, with envelope  with paid mail and so I sent it
Fuck Covid and fuck Donald Trump.
Obama had people entering illegally in cages. Trump terminated that practice. My family came to the US legally even though it cost my grandfather 3 years working at a labor camp in Cuba basically a slave in order to do so. You just have no idea how bad it is in other places
Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
BASKETBALL IS BACK  Also Donald Trump is a White Supremicist, full stop!
Everytime someone says Trump was joking without fail they are proven wrong within 24 hours.
LMAO "trump next to a black person". OMG.
What reason would u have for voting for Trump unless you are racist?  Voting republican? They are destroying us.
CBC in full deflection spin by painting Trump as a madman and with  Trudeau as an innocent victim...
I can't wait till  holds those who support trump's murderous, corrupt regime accountable.  We can't allow allies oppressive dictators walk free in the US.   for Attorney General!!!!!!  You are killing us!
That *does not* mean mass ballots automatically sent to every voter. “Universal” simply means it would be an OPTION for every citizen in every state, with or without needing to list a reason. Trump would still need to differentiate if that is EXPLICITLY what he’s talking about.
I’m not comparing them in how they got into power. I’m comparing them by the way they present themselves. They both have authoritarian thoughts and motives. Hence, Trump’s tweet today:
Go Trump... 🇺🇸
No mask!  Blame Trump
#Civilization5 : I just had what I call a "Trump Moment"... I pressed the "launch" button while looking at a specific place in the map, not realizing the nuke was pointed somewhere else nearby... now I'm in an unintended war with an opponent much better prepared to kick my ass.
I will always hate him for his “it’s time to come together” post Trump win victory speech.   Like, “we’re pay attention. Are you?”
Be aware the trump trap
Kids don’t have serious cases look it up, what trump doesn’t want is mail in voting because it’s so easy to cheat that way, someone’s dead cat got a voter registration card in the mail, I dont click on your videos anymore because of how soyboy you’ve become Hila is cool tho
One of these weeks we'll wake up to a Black Mirror reality of Trump fucking a pig on television. Then he'll do something worse by Tuesday.
Guess we’re getting a potential category 1 Hurricane this weekend. So it’s pretty much a Trump. A bit of wind and rain but will do pretty much nothing.
When you're a Republican and have lost the Federalist Society....
Trump can't get it through his thick skull that mail in voting benefits both parties equally. On top of that, don't he realize people in the military also vote by mail.
Trump Meets with Family of Slain Soldier, Offers To Pay for Funeral
3rd party is a win for trump though
Tweet is pointing out his death was needless. Not disrespectful at all.
Trump knew about this for years, he even joked about Epstein's pedophilia. He didn't distance himself from Epstein until the property dispute.
Then, all states should have early voting &amp; there shouldn't be voting suppression. In the mist of a global pandemic people shouldn't stand in line hours on end to vote. There's no arguing that President Trump is the President of the USA.

Nah, You’re obviously right about their hatred for Trump, but that has nothing to do with that, at least not the main reason, it’s part of a long process to a New World order, this, per George Soros own words.

President Trump asks recovered COVID-19 patients to donate plasma -
It’s inherently racist because we live in a system that guarantees that IF a memeber of the minority group DOES accend to heights, it’s predicated on that individual demonstratively NOT being an Ally to his/her minority group.
So now we're back for circle and you understand my first take. He doesn't have to do anything at all to appeal to any of us and he can just hide. Like I said he's literally failing upwards just because Trump is so awful not because he's offering us anything to vote *for.*
Now you can't even trust the post office To deliver your mail in vote damn Republicans you are really on a roll. Remember to put your names in the history book all you scumbags who  keep supporting trump agenda. Republicans who has broken the laws of the land and covering up for

Thank u 4 doing the rounds on Spanish press, I'm seeing and hearing nicaraguens and venezuelans falling 4 the same BS a lot of the older cuban generation fell for with Trump and you being a reputable republican calling it as it is really is necessary. 2 much  stake!
Oh, so you’re the Trump whisperer?  ok lol
That not new! But today his true colors came out 4all to see. His presidency was d groundwork for much of what’s happening today. He thought it would continue when HRC became President never expected Trump to win but certainly took measures just in case. Disgrace is too nice
Donald is never realizing how desperate and weak his tweets are making him look. 👀

As Trump floats delaying election, DeSantis and Florida voting officials say there’s no need
And yet....Trump raw dogs porn stars and WW Evangelicals love him and wax poetic about his mIl order bride Melanie. Even Newt G.'s Calista did not face this level of vitriol.  It's something about HRC.  Oh yeah, she's actually intelligent and can form a coherent sentence.
I said on policy. Remember he's a status quo, corporatist, neoliberal, right-of-center politician that refuses to offer even one major concession on policy for the left who is offering old Obama era policies. You know, the neolib trash that got us a Trump in the 1st place.
Trump supporters probably mad everyone kneeled 🤣 Dont watch 🤷🏽‍♂️#NBAisBack #NBA
We have to fight against left with all our votes for Trump. There are a lot of American that think left can not destroy our freedom and system. Then it left wins we have to go to war once more to defend our nation vs "democrats".
What about this tho?
I’m a hate group because I hate you and trump so much
It’s literally our only hope, because unless high ranking generals come out and stand next to biden with a contingent of armed troops at his back, trump ain’t stepping down and he doesn’t care about laws or the constitution or anything else
Gilliam a pop. African American progressive entering his gubernatorial race with DeSantis and the incumbent Nelson couldn’t win in a wave midterm.  Idc what the polls say, Biden has a very steep climb for Florida. I’m a resident here and outside of South FL. It’s Trump country
I was saying this the other day... As soon as I see an American flag I automatically think they’re either racist or Trump supporters.
I love this ... trump hates this
He's wrong. How long have we been having vote by mail...not issues with widespread fraud. Now in 2020 we suddenly found out about election fraud by mail, and Trump discovered it?!! We going with that? Reach much?
You made it sound like my mention of the co-morbidity factor was off-base when it was not.  So i mentioned that. Of course not one factor. I also begged NPR to have a psychiatrist explain Trump's particular sociopathy was more like a 5 yr old's &amp; to respond to the R re hands-up.
This is being the complete lie. 🤫
Love this President Trump! Always working for the American people!
As terrible as that is, I'm still a bit more concerned with the prospect of dictator Trump than I am about the GNP.
DemoKKKrats are delusional.    NONE has said: “Mr. President this is what we recommend, it will help”   When Trump banned flights from China they called him “xenophobic”.  That in fact saved thousands of not millions.
If you want youth and Black voters to turn out, they have to LOVE the candidate.  No one loves Biden.  Hillary lost in 2016 in part because the Obama coalition on Black voters didn't show up.  Black voters don't hate Trump.  He is more popular now than he was in 2016.
Trump is talking about Americans here. Referring to protesters as a beehive of terrorists to be “cleaned out.” Horrifying fascist language here.
Trump murdered... are u parrot of CNN? Projection was 3.3 mil dead By banning China at 2 deaths, closing USA at 54 deaths, Trillion $economy, he SAVED 3.15 Million ppl Would’ve been more if DEM Governors didn’t obstruct #Hydroxycloroquine &amp;didn’t seed infected into nursing homes
Trump: “Absentee ballots are good, but mail ballots are a huge fraud.”
He doesn’t know how to pronounce the word plasma. Another word he doesn’t know how to pronounce is Remdisivir. Obvioulsly he won’t  pronounce it right because it’s the first time he talked about it. Dr. Fauci has been talking about it for 6 months vs.Trump’s hydroxycloraquin. Smh

All I can say is, #BigTech, have your fun now, because after Trump wins re-election and takes back the House with a #MAGA Speaker, he is gonna kick your ass sideways.
Just found out Donald trump is the hero ...MIND BLOWN
That's a lie.

He's literally failing upwards just bc Trump is so awful. Most people voting Joe are doing so *against* Trump, not *for* Joe or any policy. He's flavorless tofu. This is peak hostage situation. He's literally our only option and only marginally less damaging than Trump on policy.
Donald Trump messed things up so bad that people with U.S. passports literally can’t travel almost anywhere in the world.
The Federalist Society just pulled a Hamilton on Trump
Lol ! It'll be useful if working in close contact with people who can suddenly cough or project body fluids or to avoid touching the eyes . The shield protects the nose as a port of entry also.  But if social distance is ok more than 6ft none of those are necessary

So this cracker Trump got the nerve to say November election should be postponed cause of COVID-19 concerns but this the same man calling it a hoax?
Who cares about the Flynn case? Nobody cause Trump will pardon him anyway. Who cares about the Steele Dossier? Nobody except #DevinNunes. Who cares about the Portland protests, except #SeanHannity? and who cares about #BilldeBlasio - nobody. Sums up most of politics I follow.
Donald is trying to be distracting everyone from this:

How were these reporters told they were only at the press conference to fluff Trump?
I clench my teeth so tightly when I hear Trump speak my teeth ache for hours.
Screw Pollo Tropical!! they donated their money to the Trump campaign!! That’s why I only buy their yuca bites now
I think Bernie voters hate the DNC more than they hate Trump. They may look at letting Trump win as a way of breaking the DNCs back so they can take over in 2022.

Police brutality , That IS criminal activity.  tRump abuses his power, THAT is criminal activity.  Stone lies in court, THAT is criminal activity.  Cohen goes to jail for commiting crimes on individual 1, yet individual 1 walks, THAT is criminal activity, and the list. Now STFU.
#AddAWordRuinATVShow? That's easy, Trump.
TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This isn’t news, it’s opinion shows punctuated with clips of trump to make you mad and whatever soft peddle propaganda the DNC wants in front of your face.
18-30 voters and black voters will NOT turn out to vote for a candidate they aren't excited about. Also former Bernie Campaign staff are saying no way Bernie voters vote for Biden.  We are headed for an epic Trump rout and take back of the House. This will be huge.
I find it so ridiculous how republicans talk about voting fraud like they’re the most perfect little angels. I’m sure y’all would be committing voting fraud too just to save your lord and savior Trump
Trump is POS he going delayed to Presidential Election he can not do that. that is Illegal you know Election Day will be on November 3rd This Years
Trump can't pronounce basic words like plasma 🙄 "plausma" 🤦🏻‍♀️
Are you suggesting Donald could ever  e winning NY or Ca? 😭😭😭
The Man  Donald Trump told Frank Sinatra his costs were 'a little rich'. His response was incredible
Nah it was a real estate dispute. Regardless, he kept up his close association with Epstein associate Alan Dershowitz and of course expressed his sympathy for Ghislaine Maxwell after her arrest
Trump campaign takes a brief pause on its TV advertising -
Trump hopes to address UN in person this September as other nations stay virtual, envoy says -
President Trump asks recovered COVID-19 patients to donate plasma -
His briefing is nauseating.  I want to throw bricks at the tv for his utterly outrageous claims of voter fraud.  Suggestion:  Since according to him an "absentee ballot" is fine, everyone needs to request one so he'll shut up.
Helmut Norpoth, a political science professor at Stony Brook University--who forecasted ⁦ 2016 and has accurately predicted 25 out of 27 elections--said that Trump's reelection chances are above 90% #MAGA #mypresident
But according to Donald it is not being that big of the deal. He wants to open schools but we are unable to vote? He would have to be admitting his failure created "the emergency that is Covid." 😏
When I see #Apple news! lol Has anyone taken a bigger kick to the financial groin than #Apple for Trump confronting China.
Folks, Trump is gonna win.
You brought up trump didn’t you
Panic? Did  not take Covid-19 seriously? Did  attend Trump’s rally in Tulsa WITHOUT a mask? How did that work out?
It’s outrageous that Trump is going to try and hold up the election results!
”Cain, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after attending President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa without wearing a mask, has died at the age of 74.”
I am outraged that a Trump is giving a campaign speech as opposed to a Presser. Biden should have equal time.
Obama presses for voting rights in pointed eulogy honoring John Lewis  How great to hear an eloquent leader speak like a leader and not some ignorant imbecile that prides himself on remembering five words in ten minutes ⁦
No such thing. Real conservatives love Trump.
Dear   will leave the  January 21st, otherwise President Nancy Pelosi will activate the National Guard to get you, and Trump out
--&gt; Horrible numbers came out today; --&gt; John Lewis was eulogized by 3 presidents; --&gt; Obama killed it. Trump didn't go and sent nobody; --&gt; Herman Cain died probably because he attended Trump's Tulsa Rally; --&gt; Repubs have no $ plan.  --&gt; trump holds a useless press conference.
I'll explain what is happening here.  No one gives a damn about Biden. No one likes Biden. No one is excited about Biden. 2/3 of the Biden vote in a recent poll were voting AGAINST Trump, not FOR Biden. 90% of Trump voters were voting FOR Trump.  If that hold, Biden loses YUGE.
He died a Trump-Ass-Kissin’ fool! He undoubtedly has also infected many others! God spared him from cancer &amp; he turns around &amp; praises tRump! Cain’s very public defiance of experts &amp; his very public praise of Trump, led to his very swift &amp; unnecessary death! #TrumpIsAnIdiot
My point was we knew all sorts of reasons why ghetto &amp; crowdwed latin commun too would be hit hard from stats despite the initial surge among jet-setters. We no longer read or check anything out. Compare Zelenko 3/28 &amp; NYT 4/02 &amp; it's clear. Trump is a symptom, not just a cause
Trump just said the entire world cares about our America’s voting system 😭
Trump's taken one question and has gone all over the place for almost 10 mins now. He couldn't pass a sobriety test.
Wallace apologized, begged for forgiveness in one of the grandest Churches in Alabama in the late 70s.  Being forthright, honest in his transgressions,and humble, he received over 90% of the African-American vote while running for governor in 1982.  Trump can’t duplicate that.
Yeah thats not the trump test. Weve been asking for rapid testing for month and he didnt do it. IN FACT he keeps taking money away from testing. 151,000 dead and counting. A competent president would have prevented most of that and used DPA for rapid tests months ago.
Trump says Nov elections might take years to resolve. Obama was not scared of elections like Trump, get ready to march to the  and demand Trump's removal. #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
Watching Trump on TV outright lie to the citizens of the United States.  Oregon &amp;other states have been voting by mail for years.They have the data to prove it works.  I object to Trump doing a campaign speech on national TV. Biden deserves equal time to address all US citizens
Trump's campaign is ... actively adding Republicans to the list
Trump is setting up to nullify the November 3 Election. He’s saying it might take months and years before we find out who won. Folks, we need to hit the streets as soon as possible.
Trump says it’s totally safe to send our kids back to school.  Trump also says we should delay the election until it’s safe.  They say Trump supporters are either billionaires, or easily manipulated idiots. Check your bank account to see which one you are.

Oh he is serious about "delaying" the election, but what he really wants to do is cancel it.   #trump #maga #fascism

Trump bought the Miss America contest for access to young girls. And he’s clearly out of his mind.  And you’re a hypocrite and a fool.
Trump just said only one child under 18 has died. We've had two cases in Florida.
she is with Trump all the time..
Was it a bad idea 4 d left to demonstrate &amp; protest without masks &amp; without social distancing 4 d last 3 months in d thousands? Imagine how many more people were infected &amp; died of COVID from all d protests? compare d last 3 months to 1 Trump rally! #SelectiveOutrage #TUMP2020
Maybe he shouldn’t have defended trump for so long. What did he think would happen.  Screw his guilt
Watching his propaganda news briefing, Trump said that things in Florida is getting better. Yesterday some 264 died and today, we’ll over 250 from COVID-19. How can he lie and the Fox crowd blelieves him. They are complecit in his crimes.
Not with trump
trump is a moron. a liar. a philanderer. a grifter. a thief. l don't care about Biden and he wouldn't be my first or second or even third choice. What I care is that trump loses. I'd rather have Biden than trump any day.

OK MAGAs get it. The GDP is the worst in history. There is no economy and if you think it's coming back soon, you are fooling yourself. Trump has decimated this economy and has no plans other than fleecing the American public. If you don't get it now, you never will. GOP failure.
We don’t have to “settle.” There’s better. There’s more. And I promise you Biden is not the answer. Trump isn’t either. But we’re gonna be stuck with one of these mfs regardless. We need to be 3 steps ahead. Let’s stop causing unnecessary division within our own in the meantime.
And then, if someone chooses to write in Bernie for instance, niggas would still claim that’s a vote for Trump. You either want us to use our right to vote as we choose or you only support voting as long as they vote for the candidate of your chlice
Trying to guilt trip black people into voting by saying “not voting is a vote for Trump” is a form of gaslighting. Let’s not shift the blame on the people being oppressed

Its deeper than the delivery deal with USPS. It was done behind closed doors. I've worked for the USPS. It's deeper than that. Just the workforce, fleet vehicles, and access to mailboxes would be even more profitable. Bezos and Trump care about one thing above all others...money.

I see trump is doing another dog and pony show. No thanks. Done with that.
I block them. They only serve to annoy. I come here for support and hope. Whatever you do, do not follow Trump. He thinks it gives him good numbers, and believe me you can never miss a tweet or comment from him. The media sees to that.
Took Trump long enough to realize what most of us already knew for many months. Did Trump see his VP's "rally" today. It is the Repugnicans who don't wear masks, and that is from Trump's poor example from the get-go. Fauci tried to teach him from day 1, but NOOOO.
TMZ said he contracted covid after a trump rally... 🥴 hopefully he does sleep in peace

Trump is a Virus. #TrumpVirus
#TrumpVirus #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpKillsFlorida #TrumpKillsTexas   TRUMP IS THE VIRUS.
Trump is scared.Trumps time in America is almost up. Maybe he can hold high office in North Korea. Maybe he can be leader of the kitchen in prison. The possibility is endless.
trump will do anything to delay the election in hopes the economy will be more favorable when the election is held. Problem is that he didn't address the virus and still hasn't, therefore there is little possibility the economy will turn that much before the election.
A common argument I hear for Trump is that he has bolstered the economy. Today's economic report emphasizes something I try to emphasize a lot to family, friends, etc. The stock market does NOT equal the economy. The stock market is fine. The economy is in the shitter.
Atop bad GDP numbers, higher than expected unemployment numbers, Senate was unable to pass relief bill. Trump is definitely deflecting attention with his election delay rhetoric.
Trump tosses a rally of what looks like the klan while a great man is out to rest. Trump always trying to steal a show as if he was worried about ratings. #DumpTrump

Him saying he might postpone the election is not fake news. Nor is Barr refusing to say under oath that he can't do it. Trump is a threat to our democratic republic. That's why he has his Nashi goon squad.
The dates of federal elections — the Tuesday after the first Monday in November — are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change. The Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.
I am listing to Rosalynn King reading 1 Corinthians 13, about love. We laughed at Trump when he named this as his favorite chapter but did not know how the  chapter is traditionally pronounced. We should have cried because he does not understand the law and instruction of God.
It may not happen legally but it may happen. Trump is above the law, that has been established. You must have noticed he openly breaks the law and gets by with it. Barr has already said he can postpone the election.

Sorry #Trump you are not king.

I’m really worried about what comes after Trump. So say he loses and Biden goes in and gets some big wins (like expanding ACA the right hates)… what will come about then. I’m fearful that Trump isn't the worse out there. Mail in voting allows you to drop off your ballet tho!

Trump has done more to benefit USA Trade than any president since Reagan.   Trump led the USA to record low unemployment. Especially for minorities. Along with rising wages.  Trump undid much of Biden's racist Crime Bill that targeted Black Americans.
Trump Tax Cuts allowed businesses to expand and hire new workers.  More importantly his cracking down on China's unfair trade practices has created opportunities for US Businesses to create jobs.  The Trade Deals he and Lighthizer have negotiated will benefit the USA for decades.
That should strike joy into Trump’s whatever substitutes for a heart.

Just like you have done zero on the Russia paid bounties. Even if you ignore it it’s still got back to you. Do something lame fat Orange. At least investigate rather then dismiss it. I’m a veteran and I wouldn’t trust Trump to protect me.

Been feeling this for a while, but it seems we are living through an unfortunately real version of the movie Gladiator right now.
Trump is trying to purposely undercount poor people and persons of color to shortchange them on political representation and state/federal money. Republicans want a permanent underclass that they rule over

#TrumpEliminatesPostOfficesToStopVoting Report on CNN by voter rights expert Ross Berman,the reason Trump intends shutting every post office down is to stop votes by mail,&amp; fact vote by mail is very safe but people wait last minute to send &amp; overwhelm post office.Send right away
Every traditional Republican understands that mail in / absentee voting is a Republican strong point.    But trump  was  a Democrat all his life, so of course he does not understand that.
Divino! 👌 Trump read my thoughts
Along with other 60000 deaths after reopening...Trump beats Milosevic, Idi Amin, Pinochet.. he wants to get to at least 10Th place on the Murderous Dictator list. #TrumpVirus
He passed away from the Trump Virus. After the first 5K deaths Trumps owns the virus and every victim's thereafter, including Herman Cain passing.
Herman Cain did not believe in wearing a mask, Trump did believe in wearing a mask.  Wearing a mask protects you from getting the virus, not completely but it help's tremendously.  He died because of the virus and supporting Trump's belief's #TrumpKillsAmericans
Trump supporters assume they are the “smart people” in this instance.  They are not. Not now. Not ever.
I am not sure if I should believe what you're saying. Say that now and say something else in the end is not the same. You called Trump a conman.and now you're bossom buddies..thanks but no thanks.
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.

As terrible as that is, I'm still a bit more concerned with the prospect of dictator Trump than I am about the GNP.
He doesn’t know how to pronounce the word plasma. Another word he doesn’t know how to pronounce is Remdisivir. Obvioulsly he won’t  pronounce it right because it’s the first time he talked about it. Dr. Fauci has been talking about it for 6 months vs.Trump’s hydroxycloraquin. Smh

Trump can't pronounce plasma, release my taxes, emoluments, Deutsche Bank, faithful, truth, I love my wife or Russian bounties on US soldiers. 🙄
Police brutality , That IS criminal activity.  tRump abuses his power, THAT is criminal activity.  Stone lies in court, THAT is criminal activity.  Cohen goes to jail for commiting crimes on individual 1, yet individual 1 walks, THAT is criminal activity, and the list. Now STFU.
Trump can't pronounce basic words like plasma 🙄 "plausma" 🤦🏻‍♀️
His briefing is nauseating.  I want to throw bricks at the tv for his utterly outrageous claims of voter fraud.  Suggestion:  Since according to him an "absentee ballot" is fine, everyone needs to request one so he'll shut up.
When I see #Apple news! lol Has anyone taken a bigger kick to the financial groin than #Apple for Trump confronting China.
Trump is setting up to nullify the November 3 Election. He’s saying it might take months and years before we find out who won. Folks, we need to hit the streets as soon as possible.
Trump does not deny that he wants to delay the election in November.
Trump bought the Miss America contest for access to young girls. And he’s clearly out of his mind.  And you’re a hypocrite and a fool.
Watching his propaganda news briefing, Trump said that things in Florida is getting better. Yesterday some 264 died and today, we’ll over 250 from COVID-19. How can he lie and the Fox crowd blelieves him. They are complecit in his crimes.
Trump, mcconnell and barr should be tried for treason as soon as possible.
Fauci is a self-serving political operative,  who enjoys sanctification given him by Democrats,  Mainstream media- Trump haters
I do like Republicans at least most of them but... wow Trump supporters are literally a bunch of cult members who can't think for themselves. Pure sheep. This isn't even a D vs R thing it's literally common sense vs ignorance.

Bottom line: the N.R.A. laundered Russian money into the 2016 campaign and illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign. The N.R.A. needs to have its tax-exempt status stripped. Our documentary details all of this. But we need help to get the doc out.
Delivery guy: “no tip?”  Me: “don’t vote for trump!”
Trump may not be eloquent by anyone’s standards, but he is a prodigious liar.
This pathetic b/c you killed him!  Trump mourns 'American Patriot, and great friend' Herman Cain
We didn’t deserve this type of health, economic, and political climate that Trump carelessly and recklessly led us to. If he is smart he’ll step down. I hear Roger Stone has room for another tattoo on his back.  Trump can end up as a tattoo on Stones back, if not it’ll be worse!
Charlie, all Trump does is lie, and self-aggrandize, and talk like the fascist he is.
I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.
Call me crazy, but i think this is Trump coded speak for "dont worry i will keep POC out of your neighborhood."
That would be a lie. Trump IS a full blown racist.
What’s shocking is just the utter disrespect. I mean, Trump flat out told reporters “no” he wouldn’t be going to pay respects to John Lewis.
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...

If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
I just asked was he a hateful person, I looked up the word in the dictionary first but I wondered why John Lewis was viewed as hateful. So I asked about Trump to see how someone could say John was hateful but Trump wasn't. Its not that complicated.
It is! Stage one was COVID19- China virus. Remember Chinese government officials net wit President Trump's administration and President Trump, before we even found out about Coronavurus.
Diane: Don't blame innocent 2020. It was as shocked as we are. You can blame it on Trump. Why not? He did everything else wrong, why not this? Although todays earthquake didn't do any damage and turn to shit as everything else he touches!
Trump’s becoming a pariah. The way his kind should be treated....instead of allowed to be President.
No joke, Trump is getting off on this - the moment he realized he could tweet praise for a different black guy who just died on the same day he planned on blowing off respect for John Lewis, I’m sure a big smug grin crossed his face and he dove for his phone.
RIP to #HermanCain who died from COVID after attending a Trump rally without a mask. Not intending this as a “gotcha” at all, but a plea to anti-maskers to maybe reconsider the whole mask thing.
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.
Q: Did Herman Cain tweet that masks would not be required at Trump's controversial Tulsa rally? And was that tweet subsequently deleted?  A: Yes.
Onmy under President Trump's guidelines,  cutting red tape , in such short period of time Vaccine is in such advanced stages of Development
for the love of  can someone tell trump how to pronounce "plasma"  its not plausema
so I'm guessing trump wasn't at the funeral.....
Amazing how you and Cain and Trump and conservatives can say whatever they want, no matter how despicable, but God forbid someone criticizes a conservative, she is labeled hateful, no matter how valid the criticism. Look in the mirror.
And MBS as well, but I totally agree about Putin too. Trump is coddling all the foreign dictators &amp; tyrants from North Korea, to   Russia, to Saudi. Time to shut down Rizvi &amp; Milner. Don’t let these foreign tyrants buy up our social media. Down with fascism! #bringbackbetter
He died from the Trump Virus. You neglected to write that.
Doesn't take nerve,nor are they unaware or unconcerned.....they are the lowest common denominators a.k.a. ignorant racist trump supporters
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Is Trump a hateful person?
I actually think the humiliating loss would lead to him not really returning to the job for those two months. His only agenda is “Trump.” He doesn’t care about what Mitch might want.   I think he’ll spend December stuffing money into suitcases and arranging to leave the USA.
To encourage them all to use the free filters provided to all Flint residents? Yeah I remember that. Man, I miss the days when that was the worst thing you could come up with against a president.   My turn:
Why didn't trump share his hydroxychloroquine with Herman Cain? He could have saved him.🤔
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now—you won’t get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone’s ideas before we vote.
Congress been asking for Trump taxes for 4 years. Nigga just said “nah, y’all can’t see that”. And nothing happened. He gonna do what he want with this election.

What a shame that was his own last public tweet. Trump has more 🩸 on his hands.
Federal Court stops Trump's new "Public Charge" rules nationwide during the COVID pandemic!! This seems to mean the new Form I-944, Declaration of Self-Sufficiency will not be required, nor the invasive and extensive personal financial documentation. Questions? Call our office!
That makes me feel better. I just don’t trust trump and Barr, two truly evil people.
Not if it’s that crazy lady that is touting hydroxycloraquin which is shown to do more harm than good for COVID. Trump has a stake in the company that produces is; a Saudi company based in Malta where patent law is non existent. Trump is trying his best to move America backwards!
It’s easy.  For trump Cain became another useless black man.
They call him “Rudy” and he used to be Trump’s lawyer before unfrozen caveman Frankenstein (Barr) took over.

Trump wants everyone to safely vote?But he's rushing the schools to open?Yeah right..

actually, the districts and electoral college helps the republicans because of gerrymandering. clinton got 2.8 million MORE votes than trump, and she still lost. and the dems ACTUALLY care about the people and districts, unlike republicans.
Cant sue the Trump campaign for it, unless he signed the NDA the Gen Z/KPOP signed online🤣🤣🤣 For rhe supporters who did not attend the rally, please express your generosity to the teenagers for saving your bloody lives from the hoax.
Absentee voting is mail in voting.. you think people are stupid. ... Well Trump supporters are stupid and unamerican for supporting a Dictator / Wannabe King. We fought a war to liberate America only to have some people wanting a monarchy?  .. #Wannabefuhrer

UNDENIABLY, Empirical Evidence is the bedrock of Irrefutable Fact and Trump has been a liar his entire adult life causing his track record to prove he simply can’t be trusted  SAFETY 1st💥 IT’S JUST TOO RISKY TO ALLOW TRUMP TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS &amp; WELL-BEING FOR FOUR MORE YEARS‼️
So instead of entertaining an idea as absurd as Trump unilaterally delaying an election, something which there is no mechanism for him to do, let’s instead worry about how we’re going to hold that election in the middle of a pandemic.
The question is not whether we will have an election on November 3rd. It’s whether or not Trump is able to sow enough chaos to squeak out a win. At best, what he’s doing now is just him trying to delegitimize Biden’s victory, not actually delay an election.
I know it can feel like Trump can do anything sometimes, but he can’t. He is repeatedly stopped in the courts, by congress, and by his own ineptitude. The only stuff he does get away with is stuff that involves Senate Republicans or his own cronies.
Then January 20th arrives. California held its elections so Pelosi is re-elected. Trump is constitutionally forced to leave. The Roberts court will deny any challenges because it’s CLEARLY SPELLED OUT. Pelosi is sworn in. Trump is kicked out by the secret service.
Most of the illegal shit Trump’s done has been confined to things the toadies in his own administration are willing to do. In order to delay the election WITHOUT congressional approval, he’s going to need to be able to simply declare “election’s off,” and...
Alright, genuine question: what mechanism is Trump going to use to delay the 2020 election?
TRUMP supporters are now saying Dems created this virus to make him look bad  and once he’s gone it will miraculously disappear!  Another great reason to vote Joe folks.
Interesting how Trump thinks we can’t have a safe election under Covid, but we can send our children back to school. #DumpTrump2020 #BlackLivesMatter #freeandfairelections

So, those people who voted for Trump because "He tells it like it is," how are you feeling about his tweets and speeches?
Trump has a schedule?
Barr did not know that legally Trump cannot change the election date. Why didn't he know something so basic? Isn't he the AG?

Help me here. I don't understand the concept of Maga. Trump has been president for more than 3 years now. Does the slogan has to be something like keep America great ? If greatness has not be achieved in last 3+ years, how he will achieve in next 4 years. I am not mocking.
Just read what Trump tweeted .If it’s not safe to vote until January 2021 then the $600/week should be extended until January 2021.

Just read what Trump says ! If it’s not safe to vote until January 2021 then the $600/week should be extended until January 2021.
I feel no guilt in saying I have zero remorse for these people.  They encouraged millions to risk their lives to please Trump, and they led by example. Their deaths should serve as an example, too.  This is not a thing I would have said four years ago. Blame Trump &amp; his enablers.
Should we do a Go-Fund-Me for the post office?   Trump has made us a pathetic country.
Which is why it was a lovely service. Nobody needs Donald Trump. We need a real president.
Trump you are the biggest fraud of a president this nation has ever seen.  You will pay big time for it.
WTF... That was the scariest thing I have seen.
And now Trump says he feels bad about his friend
What do I do with my Trump supporting son who tells me its not the governments responsibility to keep people safe??!?
Why sir are you concerned about mail in fraud? You have not been concerned about what your Senate intelligence Committee found with Russian involvement in the 2016 election in favor of Your golfing buddy Trump.
That would just kill Trump. 😘😂
Trump just said Florida is doing better. WTF????
I meant to send that to TRUMP, Sorry
Trump has no shame!
Remember this trump! RIP but if he had wore a mask 😷 to YOUR reckless rally in Tulsa he would probably be alive today! trump the #coronavirus is NOT A #HoaxVirus it’s REAL which is why including Cain 150K⬆️have died while you advocate not wearing masks😷👎🏽#NotMyPresident
Trump squawks. Not appropriate or American values that i hear.
Your PRESIDENT Trump Derangement is comical.  He’s also gonna win this election in a landslide.  ✌️

Obama's eulogy at John Lewis' funeral was a political speech, these are same people that accuse Trump of church photo op
Trump does the very same thing, albeit usually with a different angle than Obama.
Let's see trump wants to delay election day due to Covid-19 concerns. But y'all need to get back to work and send your children to school now! #ResignNowTrump  #TrumpVirus  #GoJoe2020
Vile and vicious Trump
I hope Trump listened and heard how real Presidents sound!
There’s only one CEO of America he’s an object failure and I’m no fan of the DNC they are as corrupt as republicans but Trump is the not only corruption he is incompetent and if others are so be it he’s in the top unperforming position
Dear Trump Fans,  1. There is not a person on this earth that is “trying to abolish American energy.” That is a fact so why is he saying that?? 2. No one is going to suddenly “take away all you guns!” Maybe some better control but that is all. Fake Fears help none of us.
Trump should shut them down
President Obama is currently speaking at John Lewis’ memorial. I bet Trump is holding his impromptu press conference at the White House to try and change the narrative back to him.  He’s so childish.
If the trend is your friend ... The trump notion of delaying The election ... would mean the Donald’s numbers will keep going down ... and the GOP with him
The trading volume was through the roof on Monday, the day before Trump's announcement. Insider trading palooza.
No one is praising his death. I put this on Trump for holding a stupid rally with no masks. Now people will suffer. How many more have to die? WEAR A MASK! R.I.P. Herman.
Hahahahaha. He knows Trump better than the people who support Trump, a vast majority of whom are outright saps, marks...
I didn’t watch it because Barr is a liar.  Thanks for this. We know he is a white supremacist just like tRump !   💙💙💪🏼💪🏼
We need to end the debt ceiling, end government shutdowns, do more to bolster the Justice Department’s independence, abolish ICE, put new limits on executive power...  The GOP found so many ways to sabatoge Obama and enable Trump, and we can’t let that go on.
Looks like Dr Birx gave up trying to somehow educate Trump and is speaking truth to America. Late, but better than never. It will be interesting to see if Trump throws her under the same bus as he has thrown Fauci.
On one hand, Trump’s crimes are so many and so blatant, it’s hard to imagine them being ignored.  But I’ll bet it’s also awfully tempting to just do what they did with Bush, and just focus on the legislative agenda.  And even there we probably won’t do enough.
I am afraid Trump will try to use "emergency powers" to force a delay in the election. We must be prepared for that eventuality.
Pelosi and Reid let Bush skate because they thought impeachment would be an electoral loser. When Obama won, no effort was made to punish members of the Bush administration for 8 years of lies and gross incompetence.  Trump already forced Pelosi to impeach, but will they do more?
My biggest fear is Trump somehow pulling out a win in November.  My second biggest fear is Democrats not being willing to do enough to repair all the damage when they’re back in power.  I am a proud Democrat, but one thing I’ll never forget or forgive is how they dealt with Bush.
Unfortunately, we have consistently seen Trump stomping our laws and the Constitution.  Constant Impunity and refusing to follow subpoenas &amp; ignoring Supreme Court directives. Trump lawsuits have been his tactics for years. No service done minimizing danger from Trump &amp; Co.

When your the CEO and your company fails and collapses you get fired if Trump has any honor he’d resign in disgrace
Trump is directly responsible for the  spread of the Pandemic in this country. His early denial of its existence, calling it a Democratic hoax, his subsequent failure to act, his promotion of unproven drugs, his decision not to wear a mask, his inability to
Thanks for getting GOP Senators on record disagreeing with Trump!
Putin was on him to get those troops moved out Germany.   Putin orders. Trump obeys. History will remember Trump for his fealty to Russia.
More trump lies
#Trump is testing us.  We are smarter than he is
Trump has accomplished much criminality with complicit, Greedy &amp; likewise grafting Republican Congress with no ethics &amp; lies. Please make a note of it and understand the jeopardy.
Golfing with Trump?
The question is how weak and desperate is Trump willing to appear?
He is living in a delusional world. And at some point Putin is gonna let us know all the kompromat he has on tRUmp and all the GOP sycophants!
He can’t. But Biden who is on Senate record for using n word during hearings is okay. 17 verified instances of Biden using racial slurs on camera, and Trump’s the racist. Ignorant of facts much?

Trump continues to kill AMERICANS
Germany needs to get in line since there is a long list of countries, people and organizations that Trump has insulted.
It is beginning to look like the Trump fans are bound and determined to commit suicide and take as many of the rest of us as they can with them. Or, they just really, really stupid!
Actually sorry about this - he was one of the less toxic members of the Trump admin, and he had actually done some good in his life. But in the end, he got on the Trump Train, and it killed him. R.I.P.
Trump suggests delaying election amid fraud claims, but has no power to do so  Who didn’t see this coming? #ElectionDelay #DonaldTrump
Holy shit!   He bragged about going to Tulsa for Trump’s rally and didn’t wear a mask.
I guess Pence can’t go to John Lewis funeral bc he’s a subservient toad ( and will be replaced on the ticket anyway as Trump only loyal to self)
This is sad. One line of thought is that he brought it on himself and endangered others. His, at best, naivete that led to his demise in a little over a month is still tragic. Responsible leadership from Donald Trump would go a long way to prevent unnecessary death
Want to live in a free speech free life free country? Then vote TRUMP, VOTE REPUBLICAN all the way otherwise turn Socialist then somewhat communistic very shortly thereafter!!! Just you watch and I don’t get paid for this either
Before people freak out:  No, Trump can’t actually delay the election. Only an act of congress can.  He floats dumb shit like this literally all the time cuz he has the impulse control of a toddler.  He constitutionally HAS to leave office on January 20 without an election.
Donald J Trump is trying to distract from the US GDP loss of 32.9%. He knows that he doesn't have the authority to change the date of the general election.
This is one of your crowning achievements. Like the 1,000’s of deaths, infrastructure, Trump Care and a 33% drop in our GDP.
TRUMP
Something broke in 2016 when Trump was elected president.
President Trump floats delaying the presidential election, citing his own prediction of fraudulent voting
Forget tweets, Covid, economy and sarcasm and see what happens if he’s not re-elected. What is it that the Democrats plan for our future? Look deeper than day to day. What is it Trump has been holding back?
Trump Trying to stop Nov election  Trump does not have the power himself to move the date of the election, which was set by an 1845 federal law placing it the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November The date could move theoretically with action by Congress.

An NPR investigation has found irregularities in the process by which the Trump administration awarded a multi-million dollar contract to a Pittsburgh company to collect key data about Covid-19 from the country's hospitals in the midst of pandemic. Suspicious connections.
Donald Trump thinks that the Emergency Powers Act of 1976 gave him the power to postpone the election. He is right. The Emergency Powers Act of 1976 created the imperial presidency. We lost this battle 44 years ago. We are standing on the edge of the precipice.There will be blood
I'm sure the Republican controlled Senate would back Donald J Trump.
If the trumps don’t leave the building ... the transition will still go on ... they won’t be in charge  ... and will have put the trump brand beyond redemption ... and they will forever be untouchables for what they have done to America  ... perhaps that is the final comeuppance
Great idea from The Greatest President we have Ever had been Blessed to have! 12 more years! Our forever President! Love you President Trump!
The only one who is a great embarrassment to the USA is Trump.
All they have to do is reverse the $3 Trillion tax cut they gave the rich 2 years ago. Why doesn’t some Democratic suggest that, I want to hear the GOP scream and yell how unfair it is. Trump created the problem we have today with the tax cut.
If he doesn’t leave the building ... he won’t have the the levers of gov ... and will have put the trump brand beyond redemption
Impeachment takes too long.   Just invoke the 25th Amendment and get it over with. Trump will eventually end up in prison or a mental hospital anyhow.
If Donald Trump can fly to New Jersey for celebrity golf weekends, we can have an election.
Trump wants to delay the election because it's not safe, but schools need to open now?   KEEP KIDS AT HOME!!!
When will Mika and Joe learn that Trump doesn’t care about what the Constitution says. Trump doesn’t believe in the Constitution or our Democracy.
I tweeted a few days that Trump may try to delay the election. When will the GOP. stand up to Trump and say enough is enough and fight for our Constitution and Democracy.
You can also drop the ballot off in person locally at various election and tax offices if we cannot trust Donald Trump's Postmaster General crony to obey federal law.
Ex-presidents at Lewis funeral today.   Obama giving eulogy.   Expect Trump to jump up and down waving hands around for attention.🤡
Trump is the lowlife I wouldn’t want in my backyard
No medical license on her. Sounds like she is not all there mentally. like Trump. Just a distraction, so Trump &amp; Co. Can manipulate the US pandemic to further raid US coffers for personal profit. DOJ Barr &amp; family also.
What he really wants is to NOT have a commercial property built on the site of the FBI building that would be competition for his DC hotel.   Trump always has an ulterior motive related to money.

I suggest every time this dimwit, President Demon Sperm, says China virus; we scream Trump Virus.
Maybe cause deep down they know they were wrong about tRUmp, but just can't admit it!
When are you going to step in and remove the mask mandate?? We know masks don’t work and this whole thing has been a scam. Seriously questioning whether to vote for you again. Need someone like a Trump with balls.

Reps/Trump have packed the SC already. We have to pray the RGB remains healthy enough to stay until after the Presidential election is finalized, and that the Dems win decisively. Otherwise we have lost our democracy

Hey guys, the economy contracted by 33% in the 2nd quarter. An unheard of number even in the worst economies in history. Trump's depends on the myth of "his good economy" holding up. So he flashes the shiniest object imaginable and the press and social media run with it all day.

Trump floats November election delay, but it won't happen
Mailing ballots are not a problem.  Look, we get our passports by mail, government checks by mail, drivers licenses by mail.  Mailing ballots only became an issue because Trump decided to make it one.
Must be watch TV and tweet time on the Presidents schedule. All the other living past presidents will be honoring a man at his funeral. Trump must be beside himself!
The science has been all over the place.  Is Trump a scientist or do you think he listens to the scientists around him?  Your TDS makes you stupid.
Thank you for proving again that he didn't call the virus a hoax.  February 28th we had no idea about this virus.  Pelosi was telling people to go to China Town.  Cuomo was telling people to go to the movies.  Trump was implementing travel bans.  Wake up.
Hope it’s true 😎..it would give Trump the election in November on a silver platter..👏👏👏👏🇺🇸😎
Stupid tricks get stupid prizes.  People do dumb shit all the time.  Can't blame Trump for people's stupidity.
This claim has been thoroughly debunked, yet TDS idiots like you keep pushing it. Trump referred to the Dems politicking on the virus as a hoax, not the virus itself.
Do you realize that Herman was a grown man capable of making his own decisions?  President Trump didn't ban mask wearing.  Do you people need government to tell you what to do every step of the way in your life or are you capable of making your own decisions?

Don’t you think he was tested before he was allowed so close to Trump? Herman Cain is tragedy but it’s about individual choices.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Well at least it’ll backfire on trump. His approval was low during the government shutdown.
Absolutely correct, Governor DeSantis sits at the knee of Trump, both must be voted out
Trump’s voter fraud and mail in voting tweets have no evidence. He is supplying false information.
No. I didn't get to make my point. Would you mind listing the things Trump has done if it's convenient?

If Trump calls Portland protesters a "beehive of terrorists" then what do we call his Cabinet???
I don’t think there’s any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
save the USPS. Trump will defund until there is no mail at all.

All of those points he Trump wants to but the Dems won’t let him
So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you’re proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain’s death was a result of YOUR negligence.
I don't think so loll trump is done
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! 😎

Yea and I’m sure the 8 Trump campaign staffers who contracted COVID shortly after the Tulsa Rally must’ve gotten it from somewhere else too. Regardless I guarantee that he and those around him did not wear masks or take the virus seriously which still makes it ironic and foolish

I saw this coming months ago. trump wants the election postponed. He failed us on covid to fear monger voting.  We won't allow it, he has no right to do it. Over glass, dead bodies and in a hurricane I will vote!
Trump virus there I fixed it 150000 dead  at some point the potus needs to take responsibility. Ps in nyc it got here from Europe
All BULLSHIT from the Trump administration!!
What??? Who’s this imposter? To actually challenge Trump and his cronies attempt to add funds to the Coronavirus Bill that benefits his hotel in Washington...
Totally agree. Children need to go to school and exercise their brains, their social skills, etc. Dems want the Country go into deeper havoc no matter what the casualties are, for as long as it hurts Trump. Never seen so much evil in one National Political Party.
Trump 2020
If the doctor's magic prescription actually worked, wouldn't the rest of the world be using it already? If it's a hoax, why do we need her "cure?" But really, why is trump pushing this drug so much? Someone must have stock in it.
The only accomplishment she has had it's time for Democrats to get a new leader.  Impeach Barr.  Impeach Trump again.  It's not too late
Yes. Please Vote!!!💙 Teachers don’t support Trump plan to unsafely open schools. Our children will not be a sacrifice for Trump re-election campaign!
Unless it's the result of a stroke and then, if so, there might be cognitive impairment. That's an important thing to know about Mad King Trump.  And, yes, his legs are below the belt.

#NobodyLikesTrump Hey. I like Trump. Depends on which one you referring to.
Real Story: Left losing the Black vote.  So violence is their answer.  Black Trump supporter stabbed by “peaceful protestor.” DemocRats in action.  (Watch video in article.)
Dude, just ”man up”to your opportunism, but you gotta admit, your boy Trump is racially ill... You are even parrotting false generalities fousted upon you by those that hate you...
Opportunism, righteous indignation are key traits for hardcore Trumpers, Black or White.... Intelligence is not. See TX Republicans like Gohmert... Being paid to support someone isn't new. Trump paid actors to hang by the escalator when he began his illustrious career in 2015...
Mitch McConnell just sold out Donald Trump  via
An editor on the show said, “Most of us knew he was a fake. He had just gone through I don’t know how many bankruptcies. But we made him out to be the most important person in the world. It was like making the court jester the king.”
But, you’re still Mad King Trump’s fan, so it’s easy to dismiss everything you tweet.
Trump, Biden and the Little Sisters of the Poor  via
I've spoken up about it many times on Twitter &amp; Facebook, but my audience isn't wide enough to reach the people who should bring attention to Trump's betrayal of our Kurdish allies. It's among his worst crimes. Mitt Romney gave a powerful speech in Congress condemning Trump.
Trump picked Pence because that was the only guy he didnt say horrific things about on the way to winning the party...and if he picked Cruz or Jeb there was a good chance of ending up like kennedy
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
Nooooooooooooooo, don't get him wet, he might be a trump supporter when he changes
I have a joke about Eric Trump, but it will never see the light of day.

Your exaggerating a lil here, Obama had a following but not anywhere  near The Trump cult... your being disengenuous
This is correct...there were plenty of Obama stuff even more Trump stuff a little Hillary and nothing for Biden
Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn’t, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it’s overkill  saying all that Biden’s gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
the democrat party is so divisive that if the vaccine for Covid comes out before November then It is very unlikely for Trump to win
I actually agree. Models have forecasted some time of slow down, but it remains to be seen where, when, and how much it slows down
President Trump is the most pro Israel President in History.
Watching "Catch 22" for about the 20th time. 1st time since donald became prez. The most insane cast and story I'd ever seen. The difference is, now they all seem so normal. It's trump and the GOP who now freak me out. Did I change, or has the world just flipped upside down?
No worries man! We can all always learn from each other. Mechanical issues wouldn’t surprise me, especially since it’s been a recurring issue with the NOAA hunters.  Maybe we’ll get an update on the Hunters in the 11pm update, but we’ll see 🤷🏼‍♂️
GREAT BUSINESSMAN TRUMP!
Look at A. It says 29/2330Z.  Z stands for Zulu.  All meteorological model runs and mission planning are done in Zulu time, due to the fact that it’s a universal time we can use instead of switching between time zones.
FUCK YOU TRUMP IT IS OUR MONEY AND WE SAY NO!  PERIOD!
While you’re correct that 2330 translates to 11:30pm, it’s in Zulu time. Therefore, 2330 Zulu translates to 7:30pm EST.

Twitter defends blocking Trump tweets but not Iran’s Ayatollah Khamenei
Only Trump would be jealous of Dr. Fauci.    He’s upset About Dr. Fauci’s Rating. Perhaps Mr. Self Pity should look in the mirror.  Dr. Fauci has worked under 6 Presidents and Donny can’t act like one.   There’s a Con -Man &amp; a Porn Star Prosititute running America Brilliant !

Trump again attempts to stoke racial divisions in housing message
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
Trump is not working for putin, he just knows a war would wipe out 90 million people, which the globalists say is the exact number we need to reduce out of the american population.... the cabal that wants war keeps spreading lies to start a war... trump isnt taking the bait
Trump isnt helping russia. russia isnt invading germany. giuliani took out the italian mob because it was his job, not to help russians move in, if they moved in after that wasnt his probalem...i havent noticed a russian mob problem anwhere.

Which applies to Trump bestNot all German soldiers were Nazis.  It was a political party.  The Wehrmacht was probably intermixed with true believers and dissenters but the SS were hardcore Hitlerites.  Just like not all members of the US military support Trump.
Trump (AKA the GOAT POTUS) is just trying to give  a chance to come out of the basement and present a campaign to the American people because this campaign ad is all we really have to go right now

If I remember John Lewis refused to attend president Trump’s inauguration. May he Rest In Peace.
This guy was sick of his Trump Elections signs getting run over. He took matters into his own hands to great success.
Just asking as I am just a deplorable. But the reason they might be dragging this out is if Trump pardons him can he still be part of Trumps government team if he is pardoned? Thank you
There's not a person alive that is more fraudulent than yourself. Vote anyone Street curb anything but Trump 20/20
So we should watch while you try to try our president while he is still President? No thanks, we get enough of anti Trump  rhetoric from your network
The agreed amount? You do know that it’s not a fee like Trump thinks it is. It’s a % of their GDP to defense spending. Aim is for 2%. We spend roughly 3.42% but we also operate in the Pacific. Trump thinks that it’s a fee that is paid to NATO. He’s an idiot.

Think this has something to do with a Trump's tweet this morning in regards to the election?

Once Poser was revealed for the Never Trump fraud he is, he switched his ad to this b/c he wants voters to assume he's a veteran like Cain... Poser says he cosponsors 100s of bills... much like the anti-Trump one he cosponsored.
#Resist Don’t anyone tell Trump but the Joint Chiefs pulled the fuse on the football. Trump kept wanting to try it. On Germany. He doesn’t like Germans. They kicked his Grampapa out. Many people are saying it. Many very smart people.
My guess is we'll get an extra 15 to 25% more Democrats to vote for Trump after that statement. I do hope it is true &amp;  she said it! Probably would only say it if Joe picked AOC.  AOC would then be her "boss" when Joe steps down, after his stroke. Even she couldn't take that!😳🙈
Let's be very clear on this.  The impeached president of the United States - whose henchmen have declined to remove him from office - is openly defying the law of the land.  The United States is dead. Trump has canceled it.  And your leaders are allowing it.  And so are you.
Seems like everyone around Trump is getting it except for him, could he be COVID Donnie spreading it but never contracting the disease?
Trump isn't a racist.   Democrats are the slave owners.
He not only bowed down he continues to gargle his balls. I get mailers from dear old Ted asking for money to help support his good friend Trump’s agenda.
This is a joke right? I mean what is she smoking???? Cruz? And she said Cruz doesn’t consider Trump to be his buddy??? This woman is psycho. Seriously no credibility at all.
Pick whatever metric you want. Even before the crash obama outpaced trump on jobs added by a wide margin. Trump will be the first president since hoover to lose more jobs than gained. LOL! IS IT GREAT YET?!?!?!?!?
Literally the only guy trump nominated that isn't a complete fool
Old ways are hard to break. Every old "BS" way exposed gets President Trump more and more American Constitutional voters👍🦅🇺🇸🗽
I’m voting for President Trump no matter what! You? KEEP IT GOING!
“Nobody likes me” declares Trump. I wonder why? Of course there are 140,000 reasons why. He has proven time and time again he is unethical, self-aggrandizing, lies perpetually for no reason and has no compassion or empathy for “average working Americans”. I guess he is right.
From Sept. 19th 2019 - President Trump speaks at the United Nations event on religious freedom

Ok, this is pretty sick stuff. Why are so many people blind and deaf. Don’t blame it on the virus either. Trump has been doing this for 4 years now long before the virus struck.

I faxed #Catholic parishes today informing them that our  broadcasts will air speeches from Pres Trump daily, like at the UN, NASA, Warsaw. A Deacon writes back that it’s “blatant and unadulterated partisan politics”. Wake up! It’s called democracy! 🤔🙄
Fred Trump was sued, the DOJ investigated, sent in undercover black operatives, and they learned that the Trumps don't discriminate against blacks, and the CASE WAS DROPPED.  No allegations were ever made against Donald Trump.  Court documents are facts you should refer to.
You're changing what Trump said, that's another form lying.  Be honest and accurate when you hate because it makes you look dumb when you lie about what someone said when what they said is on YouTube all day.
Trump did not say Mexicans... He said Mexico is not sending their best people.  They are sending rapist...bla bla bla, and   guess some are good people.  If you're going to hate be accurate while you hate.
YEAP - They sued Trump for not renting to black people.  If you were smart you would know it wasn't Donald Trump who got sued.  But simple people don't need to hear the whole story.
YEAH, married to a black lady and my son is Latino and he's married to a Filipina and they're all Trump supporters and they're all called racists by hateful stupid people.   My parents are racists, but their Trump hating Democrats so I expect that out of them.
I can't find one person who calls Trump a racist capable of providing evidence that Trump is a racist.  Even the comments about the "fascist playbook" sounds stupid because there is no such "playbook."  Do you have any critical thinking skills?  No?  I didn't think so.
Critical Thinkers identify #FakeJournalists &amp; #FakeNews by headlines alone~ "Trump reportedly made unexpected first pitch announcement out of irritation with Fauci"  Only Trump knows if he was irritated; not the #FakeJournalist who can't report the fact without a biased barb.
Totally agree. At 71, I have lived through good and bad times. Trump promised a lot. He delivered huge tax cuts for the wealthy. We now have record deficits and find ourselves fighting for our health. No plan for Healthcare during a pandemic is not forgivable.

There continues to be a sentiment that somewhere- somehow there is a Genie in Trump’s lamp. The more people rub, they find out they just get worn out trying. There is no Genie or magic that suddenly makes him more intelligent, thoughtful, kind, empathetic, honest or trustworthy.
With Trump there is always a Tweet or a video that reflects his true nature. He has always been a racist. His father was one too. The fact that he loves to hear himself talk gives all of us a window into his true nature. Just listen to his words.

3+ years later, the “Great Pumpkin Audit in the Sky” is no closer. How gullible are his supporters to think Trump ever intended to allow anyone to see and unravel his house of cards? Pay no taxes; too bad we all can’t get that break.
President Trump should give you an award for increasing people's IQ from 69 to 72.
The left supports criminals they would love to see chaos all through the United States  they just can't wait to see people's homes invaded. They cannot take control. And innocent people will die .           'a lot of bloodshed' against Trump supporters
If the debates were good policy debate, which is impossible with trump btw because he doesn’t know how our government even works, they would get bad rating and most people wouldn’t even understand or care. It’s a shittty popularity contest
I agree, the 2016 debates were turned into a clown show and they haven’t had real policy debate in a long long time. Trump turned the whole thing into a reality tv show on top of the declining quality of them. I blame the audience, us, on not holding any standards
Why won’t President Trump attend Lewis viewing????

If you are paying attention, you would know that it was Trump's intelligence (FBI, DOJ, CIA) were colluding to overthrow him--first time in American history.  Durham is investigating and charges against Comey, McCabe, Rosenstein, Strozk coming soon.
I spent 20+ years in uniform (USASOC) and have a rating too, now work for DOD; I'm not impressed.  I asked you a simple question and you can't defend your childish hate of the POTUS with facts.  The media lies about Trump nonstop programming simple minded people like you to hate
This is emblematic of Trump’s Presidency. A grifter who promised a Great Wall that would be paid for by Mexico. Americans instead get a piece of crap paid for by shifting funds from needed Congressionally approved military projects. Typical of Trump.
From Gandhi, MLK to Congressman Lewis, peaceful and persistent protest wins in the face of tyranny. Americans have a Constitutional right to redress their government and a willingness to stand up. Vote out Trump and those that have enabled him to divide us.
I follow both. I follow Trump to be able to mock him in real time. Look in my timeline just yesterday and you'll see me pleading with people to follow Joe. My posts and retweets are 100% anti-trump So please don't think just because we follow Trump that we support him in anyway!
FL - hoping the “hidden” Trump supporters get out and vote as I suspect they will. If that happens, by midnight Election Day all the prognosticators will be out of business for another 4 years.....
Twitter definitely provides a new definition into the minds of the common Joe Smo.  Just ponder on how many of these clowns have voting rights that will affect your kids grand kids?  Trump The Trunk needs to tighten up the voting regs after his re election.
Our government under Trump is out of control. It is operating with no regard for the Constitution or Democratic principals. We are not Russia or China. We vote and we can see where 3 1/2 years of Trumpism has brought us. Trillions in more debt, over 140k dead.
Damn Straight. I hear Trump's favorite Country Norway is hiring entry level morons
lol.. Trump the Trunk 2020.  Dont loose any sleepover Joe the Smo Biden. He wishes he could hold a candle to you.
His name is Louis DeJoy and he wasn't elected, he was appointed by Trump to slow the mail down.  He is a big Trump donor.  But yes, we need to keep our eyes on him
This is exactly why all Americans should let their voices be heard and vote. That way, when Trump loses there will be no question as to what we thought of the “Trumpism Experiment”.
Yes, Trump actually woke up and realized his “base” can’t win him another election. His malfeasance and inability to unite our nation is just too much for the majority of voters to accept. Vote Blue to begin to mend our Democracy.

Reinstituting the taxes on the ultra rich and corporations as they were prior to 2017 would be a good first step. Trump has presided over the largest budget deficits in our history. He reduced taxes and increased spending- no plan for sustainability.
I WILL VOTE TRUMP because Joe has to select someone named TOKEN to be his VP, because Joe supports Socialism and Lawlessness, and because of this video which every American should view twice-
After weeks of protests,Portland had settled into a more manageable routine with less real property damage and no injuries. Then came Trump’s stormtroopers. Secretive police, strong arm tactics and injuries as protests grew exponentially. Trump spawns division and chaos.

Speak up, Carlos. Do you want open borders so the criminals can come in and attack your community? That’s Biden. Do you want security at our nation‘s borders in at the same time warmly and safely welcoming immigrants? That’s Trump.

Nothing brings people together more than a common cause In our case it's racism, intolerance, greed, cruelty, murder n' mass incarceration of minorities especially blacks, and F*CKING TRUMP'S GOTTA GO......
Trump is incapable of uniting a diverse nation like America. His attempts at recasting himself as a “law and order” candidate, is ill conceived and destined to fail. He is taking advice from the absolute worst people. Miller and Bannon make no attempt to hide their racist agenda.
Trump has made it clear that he doesn’t want a free press. He sees himself as a all knowing and powerful leader that is above all this “democracy” stuff.

Can’t wait to see what new crap he has in store. Trump is so obsessed with the past that he can’t see or plan for what’s ahead.

Where’d those libertarians go? They were so outraged at Obama for saving the car industry and now trump is shelling out trillions, deploying federal police around the country, and has ballooned the size of the government by a significant number. Wonder what happened?
Donald trump has been a fraud and con man for 70 plus years. Is banned from running a charity because of self dealing, he had to pay 25 million dollars for running a fraudulent university. He had 70 years to not be a conman fraud, why do you think that will change?
He got subpoena to testify to Congress. So he's hiding up Trump ass, with Pence n' Pompeo.

Trump is just like the captain of the Titanic. Both stayed in denial until the water was up to their waists. Then they finally took action to help the rich while the poor stayed locked down &amp; slowly died

Many American Jews Need to Atone for Their Sins against Donald Trump
This may actually be the linchpin for the end of Trump’s presidency. It’s a sign of desperation and a total lack of historical perspective. Other President’s that were failing have tried to show force in the face of social change and ended up being rolled over in the process.
I thought these briefings were canceled in the first place because it makes Trump look incompetent, self-centered, and petty. Without doctors and other professionals giving actual useful information, these briefings are no more than a diatribe. On second thought, why stop now?
legally run deficits.They will be forced by law to lay off police fire emergency responders teachers and other critical personnel.Republicans know this. Trump created this situation with his disastrous response &amp; was aided by Moscow Mitch and the Republican Senate. #GOPTraitors

They don't know how. That's why I'm 20+ year registered Independent. I vote Blue all the time because the alternative isn't an alternative. Dems are well intensioned good hearted impotent dweebs. They don't know how to inspire passion until after someone like Trump pisses us off
If you have any doubts about Comey ,Brennan Or anyone else on the Russia probe from CNN and MSNBC especially Rachel Maddow they're all liars and should all be arrested.       Hannity: The FBI spied on candidate Trump
Can you tell me why you hate Trump with bigoted fervor based on actual facts and not the lies #FakeNews tells you?  I really want to know if you have critical thinking skills.
Let me translate:  Donald Trump became successful and didn't make me rich along the way so I'm going to trash him and hope that a lot of stupid liberals buy my book.  YEAP - I used the Stupid Liberals to get wealthy and they bought it.
This just in:  Trump brags, " i put my pants on all by myself today "
Dear idiot. The state Governors were in charge of all the healthcare and lockdowns in their own states.  The only thing Trump could do was to get ventilators, equipment, PPE, military doctors, Corp of Engineers to build hospitals.  He did all that and more.  The Governors FAILED
Yeah, I do want to get something off my chest.  I think all the people who call Trump a racist do so based on lies, lies told by  &amp;  et al and these people hear these lies, without any critical thinking skills, go out and repeat the Trump is a RACIST lie.  Here's TRUTH
Can we talk about important things without lying?  1. Joe Biden's dementia is a very real problem and we should address now rather than with the 25th Amendment  2. The attempted overthrow of the Office of the POTUS  3. Why news agencies lie about Trump
The democrats are destroying America just to trump . These bastards want socialism and they wanted to destroy our faith.the democrats are behind burn loot murder and the other group against America
If #Trump moved to the center it would be landslide. If he continues to be positive, and talk use of mask, vision for the future. And what you can work with Dems yes he has to work with them. It’s call #America. If #PresidentReagan did it no reason Trump can’t. #Trump #USA

Nobody blamed the two Ebola deaths on Obama.  Trump isnt running around shooting infected XOVID19 needles into passersbys. Please quit being an idiot.
Projection much. Really, and Trump the republicans are in it just to help us poor little people. Let us eat cake. And just because you say FACT in all letters, doesn't make it so.  You are a parody.

Oh Boy, seriously. Now we have Trump’s Press Secretary explaining what Trump meant by yesterday’s comment wishing Maxwell the best of luck. If it looks like and smells like a pile; we don’t need to taste it too.

Remember You SAID YOU'D VOTE for YOUR MOTHER in 2016 NOW you go with the Flow..Yea JUST like a Rep.. youll probably STILL VOTE trump just wont admit it SOME people Dont FORGET..
Two of the 4 are in China.. You would rather blame Trump coward
Agreed. What really creases me is that Trump cares nothing abt Rx prices—he's only doing this as what will assuredly be 1 of many last-ditch efforts 2 buy votes. He's a capitalist pig, as bad as they are+doesn't give a monkey's how much they overcharge. Despicable+transparent.
is the only waterhole for desperate Trump voters, they go there to be lied to because it makes them feel good, never mind it's all lies and misinformation, the poor bastards don't know any better
Due to the Trump’s late, slow, disastrous approach to the coronavirus pandemia, USA is a huge graveyard with more than 150000 deaths and he is still misleading people . Trump’s inflammatory comments aggravated the racial crisis due to police brutality! Trump is unfit! Vote blue!
Ask yourself this... how many Joe Biden flags or lawn signs have you seen in your neighborhood compared to Trump flags and lawn signs ?!?! That’s the real question!
I don’t think Trump spoke today!
You mean this book? Don’t worry the RNC will buy in bulk so it’s not a total flop, like it did for the previous one!
Idiot, what do you expect when  is the only Trumpian cable station in the nation? Matter of fact, 63 million voted for Trump, so Fox is doing really bad when only 3 or 4 million of them even bother to watch.

Trump lives rent free in your head all day
Obama used the politics that Lewis lived for in his eulogy which is deeply appropriate and seems to be what Lewis would have done. If people see that waving the banner of voting rights as anti-trump… well… I think that might say more about the president than anything else.
I’m not seeing how the politics of openness, inclusivity, and enfranchisement are connected to Trump in any way, save for the fact that Trump is has taken measures against all of those things.
The real death rate is being hidden by the trump White House.
TRUMP 2020..
What a sentence by  “Far from a strongman, Mr. Trump has lately become a heckler in his own government...”
We need to vote every Republican out that has enabled Trump and made our country the laughing stock of the world.
Yeah, that’s not going to happen. Florida has already turned Blue and it’s looking like Texas will go Blue too. Nobody likes Trump. Nobody.
Sigh, a “Trump 2.0” president is gonna beat this guy in 2024
Trump hasn’t been successful in subverting the law. The problem is much of the constitution assumed that those in office would be ethical gentlemen. Trump is neither. Even Rubio said today there will be no postponing the election.

What's happening here?😳
Trumpian weather coming at 10:00 PM? Oh please,  cannot be trusted with a Hurricane, you might get a call from Trump telling you to say it's a hoax by Democrats, and you will comply, like you did with Coranavirus, a hoax you told Americans as they died by the thousands
W  very mediocre President, good human being. trump horrible president, horrendous human being.
Just say nothing Trump could do would be worse to you than supporting legalized abortion and be done with it.

Trump Demands That All Election Results Be Known On Election Night
“President Trump needs to be told by every Republican in Congress that he cannot postpone the federal election. Doing so would be illegal, unconstitutional and without precedent in American history”
A new book by  journalists takes you behind the scenes at Trump's Mar-a-Lago and into a bizarre world where politics and national security matters spill out into full view of club members.   Read an excerpt from "The Grifter's Club" here:

I had taken as political hyperbole Dems’ assertion that Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic &amp; is itself grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment again by the House of Representatives and his removal from office by the Senate
They know nothing will come from their statement.  They are saying that now so that when trump is out they can say "we stated we disagreed with him".  CYA. Thats all it is.
Every internal move Trump is making demonstrates a real decline in popularity. And they know it.

#BLMprotest ran up to the last election and then immediately disappeared after #Trump was elected. Now that he is up for re-election we have protests again that will also immediately end once the election is over. Can you all see the puppets hand in the sock? I can. #blm.
Biden was giving a hypothetical, knowing Trump will do whatever he can to “fix” the election. Trump, if he could, would actually do it!!

Trump isn't the one who's setting crime records in Chicago, and he's not the one causing the civil unrest. That was your MAYOR! Might want to ask her why she hates our country.
I think it's much more likely that Trump is not actually engaged in the struggle that the Qanon people think he is.  Powerful pedophiles exist, in almost every major institution worldwide, but Trump isn't fighting them.

Isn’t it sad that Trump had NICER things to say about Herman Cain than he did John Lewis?
When Trump wins re-election with mail in ballots, will the opposition question the integrity of the election? Anyone who says no is either ignorant or intellectually dishonest.
Funny how tRump learned so much about the minutiae of the entire nation’s voting systems just by trailing in the polls.
U tell me nothing i don't know but seem unaware that  Dems are less uninformed re early treatment. Science requires open-minds. Accepting all Fauci sez on faith, &amp; accepting prevention of RX's &amp; censorship is authoritarianism. It kills people &amp; pushes independents toward Trump.

Russians really don't like Putin. They follow him hoping for scraps. And they hate Trump. They think he's a fucking clown like we do And having Trump around would only intensify that.   No Russia is a trailer park with nuclear weapons.

Don’t trust them. Don’t ever. But if they collectively abandon Trump it’s lights out at Trump campaign HQ. Like there’s no money and no point to continue.
Trump talked about the re-infestation in foreign countries vs. how good we are doing in the US. You know the next step is his claims a total lockdown would have been useless.
We all expected Trump to threaten to delay the election, right? This shouldn’t come as a surprise, but it should continue to motivate us to act.
why has Trump not been given a psychological evaluation?
Not only that but all the media outlets inferred he contracted the virus after attending a Trump rally with no evidence.
Trump doesn’t joke, even when he’s making fun of people. Have you ever even seen him laugh?
According to MSM Trump reneged on delaying the Election! All of America is on his ass!
No shjt. You Republicans still don’t get Trump do you.   He did it so democrats would say people can get out and vote
And dems so shocked that Trump is concerned.   Amazing.   4 LA men admit to Skid Row voter-fraud scheme, DA announces
Oh, they will be. Then you'll find just how much of a shell game the Trump empire really was. I'm betting he actually worth from 5 to 10% of what he says. Everything else is leveraged up the heinie.

His "Secret Service" isn't going to get near him with the actual USSS puting up a fight. And Park Police (uniformed USSS agents). And the US Marshals. And DC Police. And that's all before the military get to the scene.  Trump ain't got the stones to put up a fight.
You know Obama is a criminal, and the entire left has been filling people minds with lies about Trump. You're just a sad case of TDS! You also know John Lewis was a racist himself, and he did NOTHING for his city. Period but make himself rich.
To who? Putin isn't that vain. He's not going to keep Trump around as a prize.
Yes i do but I'm just saying, having biden would be the worse choive to have as president. No police, segregation may make a comeback, far more blacks in jail. You can say what you want about trump but before covid or in this the chinese virus, he was doing great

If he did, then why wouldn't he say so? Trump seems to say everything that's on his mind.
Yea i feel you Trump is a racist apologist at best. But he can think all he wants. Our checks and balances are too solid. Cuba was easy pickings with so many living in dier circumstances. I miss BO...I'm getting nostalgic lol
That's it in a nutshell. Putin has no loyalty to him. He drop Trump like an 80# bag of cement. And then call in all of his loans. Mar-A-Lago might be on the market sometime next year.
trump visit KODK fact. KODK secured loan to produce pharmaceuticals(hydroclorowhatever). stock then quadruples. Y’all don’t see these drugs are just money in they pockets.

Trump will deport them in due time. When you enable Nazis they always wind up turning on you eventually.
No, there’s no praising them. But it might be a signal to all the conservative judges that they aren’t obligated to support Trump.
My man. I'm no Trump supporter. Didn't vote for him and I dont plan to. But you think he is the only one talking about the validity of our democracy? Both sides attack it as it suites them. Remember how Russia got Trump elected? Trump cant be Castro because America can't be Cuba.
If you believe in Karma, then Trump is in a lot of trouble.
Yeah but Trump is not popular (due to his own putrid actions) surely that is more meaningful than either of those things
Fuck Covid and fuck Donald Trump.

That *does not* mean mass ballots automatically sent to every voter. “Universal” simply means it would be an OPTION for every citizen in every state, with or without needing to list a reason. Trump would still need to differentiate if that is EXPLICITLY what he’s talking about.
I’m not comparing them in how they got into power. I’m comparing them by the way they present themselves. They both have authoritarian thoughts and motives. Hence, Trump’s tweet today:

Trump knew about this for years, he even joked about Epstein's pedophilia. He didn't distance himself from Epstein until the property dispute.
Then, all states should have early voting &amp; there shouldn't be voting suppression. In the mist of a global pandemic people shouldn't stand in line hours on end to vote. There's no arguing that President Trump is the President of the USA.

It’s inherently racist because we live in a system that guarantees that IF a memeber of the minority group DOES accend to heights, it’s predicated on that individual demonstratively NOT being an Ally to his/her minority group.
So now we're back for circle and you understand my first take. He doesn't have to do anything at all to appeal to any of us and he can just hide. Like I said he's literally failing upwards just because Trump is so awful not because he's offering us anything to vote *for.*

I love this ... trump hates this
He's wrong. How long have we been having vote by mail...not issues with widespread fraud. Now in 2020 we suddenly found out about election fraud by mail, and Trump discovered it?!! We going with that? Reach much?
You made it sound like my mention of the co-morbidity factor was off-base when it was not.  So i mentioned that. Of course not one factor. I also begged NPR to have a psychiatrist explain Trump's particular sociopathy was more like a 5 yr old's &amp; to respond to the R re hands-up.
This is being the complete lie. 🤫
Love this President Trump! Always working for the American people!
DemoKKKrats are delusional.    NONE has said: “Mr. President this is what we recommend, it will help”   When Trump banned flights from China they called him “xenophobic”.  That in fact saved thousands of not millions.
If you want youth and Black voters to turn out, they have to LOVE the candidate.  No one loves Biden.  Hillary lost in 2016 in part because the Obama coalition on Black voters didn't show up.  Black voters don't hate Trump.  He is more popular now than he was in 2016.
Trump is talking about Americans here. Referring to protesters as a beehive of terrorists to be “cleaned out.” Horrifying fascist language here.
Trump murdered... are u parrot of CNN? Projection was 3.3 mil dead By banning China at 2 deaths, closing USA at 54 deaths, Trillion $economy, he SAVED 3.15 Million ppl Would’ve been more if DEM Governors didn’t obstruct #Hydroxycloroquine &amp;didn’t seed infected into nursing homes
Trump: “Absentee ballots are good, but mail ballots are a huge fraud.”
They pontificate in these what if’s as if any of these reporters have the slightest inkling of what motivates Trump voters.
Tell that imbecile  who said Trump was ‘joking’ about delaying the election, to turn on the #TrumpPressConference.
All I can say is, #BigTech, have your fun now, because after Trump wins re-election and takes back the House with a #MAGA Speaker, he is gonna kick your ass sideways.
Just found out Donald trump is the hero ...MIND BLOWN
That's a lie.
The Federalist Society, the people who gave Trump a list of the most radical right-wing judges on the planet. Yeah, you guys have a lot of credibility, doing harm to the country, that is.
He's literally failing upwards just bc Trump is so awful. Most people voting Joe are doing so *against* Trump, not *for* Joe or any policy. He's flavorless tofu. This is peak hostage situation. He's literally our only option and only marginally less damaging than Trump on policy.
Donald Trump messed things up so bad that people with U.S. passports literally can’t travel almost anywhere in the world.
The Federalist Society just pulled a Hamilton on Trump
Lol ! It'll be useful if working in close contact with people who can suddenly cough or project body fluids or to avoid touching the eyes . The shield protects the nose as a port of entry also.  But if social distance is ok more than 6ft none of those are necessary
So this cracker Trump got the nerve to say November election should be postponed cause of COVID-19 concerns but this the same man calling it a hoax?
Who cares about the Flynn case? Nobody cause Trump will pardon him anyway. Who cares about the Steele Dossier? Nobody except #DevinNunes. Who cares about the Portland protests, except #SeanHannity? and who cares about #BilldeBlasio - nobody. Sums up most of politics I follow.
Donald is trying to be distracting everyone from this:
Imagine trump does all this nonsense and Nancy fucking Pelosi is sworn in 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How were these reporters told they were only at the press conference to fluff Trump?
Screw Pollo Tropical!! they donated their money to the Trump campaign!! That’s why I only buy their yuca bites now
I think Bernie voters hate the DNC more than they hate Trump. They may look at letting Trump win as a way of breaking the DNCs back so they can take over in 2022.
#AddAWordRuinATVShow? That's easy, Trump.
TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This isn’t news, it’s opinion shows punctuated with clips of trump to make you mad and whatever soft peddle propaganda the DNC wants in front of your face.
18-30 voters and black voters will NOT turn out to vote for a candidate they aren't excited about. Also former Bernie Campaign staff are saying no way Bernie voters vote for Biden.  We are headed for an epic Trump rout and take back of the House. This will be huge.
I find it so ridiculous how republicans talk about voting fraud like they’re the most perfect little angels. I’m sure y’all would be committing voting fraud too just to save your lord and savior Trump
Trump is POS he going delayed to Presidential Election he can not do that. that is Illegal you know Election Day will be on November 3rd This Years
Are you suggesting Donald could ever  e winning NY or Ca? 😭😭😭
The Man  Donald Trump told Frank Sinatra his costs were 'a little rich'. His response was incredible
Nah it was a real estate dispute. Regardless, he kept up his close association with Epstein associate Alan Dershowitz and of course expressed his sympathy for Ghislaine Maxwell after her arrest
Trump campaign takes a brief pause on its TV advertising -
Trump hopes to address UN in person this September as other nations stay virtual, envoy says -
President Trump asks recovered COVID-19 patients to donate plasma -
Helmut Norpoth, a political science professor at Stony Brook University--who forecasted ⁦ 2016 and has accurately predicted 25 out of 27 elections--said that Trump's reelection chances are above 90% #MAGA #mypresident
But according to Donald it is not being that big of the deal. He wants to open schools but we are unable to vote? He would have to be admitting his failure created "the emergency that is Covid." 😏
Folks, Trump is gonna win.
You brought up trump didn’t you
Panic? Did  not take Covid-19 seriously? Did  attend Trump’s rally in Tulsa WITHOUT a mask? How did that work out?Same could be said for your comments, sir. Please tell us you're not like trump who always thinks he's the smartest person in the room. Do you think you're the smartest person in the room. Sure sounds like it.
Did you know Trump voted illegally? It was in the papers here, but nothing was done of course. See, in FL, you have to list a residential address. M-A-L is not on the books as residential, so Trump actually committed VOTER FRAUD!
Oh. My. God. Can it be? I feel the rapture going through me and not lifting me up because hell no. All because Trump told a truth for once!!
Obama did 2 things that I'd take him 2 task 4, the TPA he wanted, but finally got shamed out of at the last min, n not telling #MoscowMitch 2 piss off 2 even up the playing field after Comey's fucking brain aneurism ouying the HRC emails by throwing the 🇷🇺 help 4 Trump into play.
Yes at the hands of Donald J Trump
So can we now say that Donald J. Trump KlLLED Cain? AFAF
Not a socialist but I don’t like Trump. This is still America right?
Not a chance. Biden will win in a landslide and after that, the only unresolved issue will be where to send trump's last presidential check. By the way, these conspiracy theory, worst case scenario stories, serve no real purpose. Report real news and lay off the what if stories.
King Trump?
King Trump??
The crazy thing about this is that nobody utilized all those empty seats.   At the very least, you could have spaced yourselves out a bit.   Herman Cain beat stage 4 cancer, but decided to risk it all for a Trump rally. Sad way to go.   Cover your face. Quit crying about it.
You’re lying. #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpIsNotWell #Trump #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #GOPTraitors #GOPCowards
As the wall goes up, illegal Crossings go down and so does the fvcking wall  This is proof that anything that Donald J Trump touches is destroyed
Hey Mikey Poo. Your azz will NOT be in Office as of November 3 ,2020 so suck sucking Trump's DlCK on twitter. we got it! you bend for a friend. Got it !  NOW #STFU and go BL0W your Mother Bear!
look in the eyes of a person and you see their soul. He has none (Like TRUMP) both have serious problems
DONALD TRUMP JR. SUCKS DlCK  JUST SAYING
Donald Trump- is/was NEVER needed in any celebration in  life of our great #RepJohnLewis
#dyingforTrump I think TRUMP is asymptomatic. A lot of lies and molecules spew from his mouth daily. A lot of people in his admin have contacted #TrumpIsTheVirus Why do these people obey their 'trump god' and not the GOD of the Universe who wants them to live. #TrumpIsNotWell
So, the Attorney General, and this Trump Administration, this Republican Congressman and Women, thus all who voted for them are irrelevant Mr. Nadler.....no sir, you are.
No offence anyone, making a trump/Hitler comparison. Sorry to hurt your feelings. I wish your wife well😇❤️
#dyingforTrump #EverythingTrumpTouchesDies #TrumpIsTheVirus #covididiots Trump will NEVER visit you if you get sick! #coronavirus #WearAMask  Why would ANYONE take pen anyone, that's not steralized? Why are Republicans scared to death over DT?  #TrumpNotWell
Fine by me. *trump sully's everything he touches.
And  said it is up to the DOJ. It's not. Don't let that little nugget get lost in the truckload of *trump bullshit we have to wade through day in and day out.
Res ipsa loquitur and what a deadly message indeed. trump should be court ordered to visit every grave beyond the 15 or so he predicted back in January when he called Covid a hoax.
*trump and class are two words that should never ever ever be used in the same sentence.
#HermanCain- Don't know much abt him, but condolences to his family. All those who appease Donald Trump's ego abt #mask and #Hydroxychloroquine, pay attention to scientific facts if you want to live.  &amp; others crowding around your 'TrumpGod' Put your family first.
Looks like we are not going to become a lawless nation after all. I think at this point, just about everyone has had enough of trump's and barr's attempts at circumventing the law. I have always believed that there are still good, decent people, who aren't part of trump nation.
Trump is such a baby.
Right but my point being if it eliminates Trump for now we can work on the rest later. Choices are so limited
Translation, we are just as ready to be rid of trump as the rest of the world.
Thare is just one case per state every six or seven years, on average of Mail-In voter fraud. We are talking about an occurrence that translates to about 0.00006 percent of total votes cast. Trump's just terrified because you can't cheat if there's a #PaperTrail
*trump doesn't joke. He has no sense of humor whatsoever.
The morning after the #Tulsarally Trump said he never jokes.
Trump wanting to postpone the election is an ACTUAL threat to democracy but people are too busy pretending that politics are about their team winning to rationalize that.
‘On the golf course — I gotta go’: Republicans wimp out after being confronted with Trump’s call to delay elections
Right . Trump can actually think for himself and not a puppet like Biden would be
Yes yes yes ... Trump is going to take over the country, just like you thought.
Trump is terrified . You are so right. He’s terrified of a rigged election!!! That’s what he’s terrified about!!!
Chuck your not telling the whole story again.. king trump just sent in his royal guard to kidnap people. #Cult45 #DementiaDon #ChuckLikesToKissTrumpsAss
Yeah Trump has the right ideas, but often doesn’t execute them properly. Again if Germany cares about NATO so much, why aren’t they meeting their contractual obligation? America pointing that out isn’t the US not being a good partner.

Pres Trump might not be correct. However the Bush team was a complete disaster, and we’re still paying for their errors. So I don’t listen any of their criticism.  The Obama team didn’t have any answers either. I think we need a rethink in the USA, not a return to Bush years

- you have nothing to offer! Read your cousin  Mary Trump's book. You just might learn some serious medical issues about your immediate family. You don't have time to worry about Hunter; he's most likely working an honest job!
Delay the election but send children back to school now. Got it. trump's statement is purely self-serving, ridiculous, and narcissistic. He wants more time to make his case to America. The 150,000 people that died because he denied Covid and failed to act would like more time.
Trump's DELAY - He will be dragged out of the WH 1/2021 His suggestion of delay Election 2020 tweet is for him to try and get the economy afoot &amp; a speedy vaccine. That Won't Work
Trump can take his #Fracking to Ma-A-Lago to dig for oil! People have died. Stop killing our #Environment US Geo Survey acknowledges drilling for oil&amp; fracking have caused earthquakes! (so why did SJU &amp; Haiti have earthquakes) Stay away fr poor people of color with your poison!
Would Mr. Trump want to delay the election if a democrat were in office?   I know he just loves to throw hand grenades in the room...so let’s use this as a rallying cry to make sure we have a well run and closely monitored voting process.
Trump tweeted about delay the election shortly after new data showed the economy shrank by a record one-third in the last quarter.   Pathetic and coward..!
July 30th, 2020, the day *trump went full dictator.
What are your thoughts on *trump going full 3rd world dictator this morning, preemptively talking about canceling November? Since you're my Senator, I'd really like a response. 🤔
President Trump has no say on when to hold the General Elections. For the preservation of our democracy, all members of Congress Republican or Democrat, Supreme Court Justices must make it clear the elections will occur in November.
They cannot help themselves.  It makes Trump look bad so it will be blasted across the headlines.  Had we let this virus run its course this would be done already.  But that would not fit the narrative that joe will save the day.
But Trump has voted by mail. Why is it good enough for him but not for everyone else?

Statement from the Press Secretary Regarding the Implementation of President Trump’s Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship
I’m not a leftist.  More a recovering right winger, but you cannot tell me that old chestnut holds water.  Trump has had over 3 years to fix stockpiles.  He was left with a comprehensive Pandemic Prep plan that he just ignored.  This is Trumps Mess. Let’s not wipe his ass. Again.
Terrible to have to blame the guys that have been gone over 3 years for all the wrong that Trump creates
This is what real leadership looks like. Real leaders make decisions not based on what's politically expedient but what's best for the populace as a whole. If we had this kind of leadership in Washington fewer families in this country would be in mourning. Trump failed the U.S.
Doctor admits the obvious. The U.S. was slow in recognizing the Covid threat from Europe. No kidding, sherlock. We had a president playing politics with one of the deadliest diseases to hit the world in 100 years. He said the dems made up Covid to hurt him. Trump failed the U.S.
Nothing to worry about here, consider the source. Barr is not credible. The trump administration is in the throw it against the wall and see what sticks phase. Clear sign of desperation. Don't give life to their desperation. Rise above the pettiness and speak to the issues.

Damn....look how oppressed they are....out in the street defying orders to stay home without consequence...barely anyone wearing a mask...give these protestors reparations... they are obviously suffering from slavery over 400 years ago. Trump 2020 baby. You won't be dancing then.
No they found the truth and they embraced it so much... they spread the word. Too bad for you, Trump will be back in office. If you ask nicely, maybe the hodgetwins will send you some tissues in November 😎🤙💯
Did I get it right me Barrrrrf... they should all be pressing this hard! He is a Trump pocket pal
He's wearing a *trump/Rambo tee-shirt.   That's all.

So whose side is Trump really on?  Well, here’s a clue: Tucked away on page 203 of the COVID stimulus package backed by Trump, is an obscure provision that delivers a whopping $135 billion in tax breaks to millionaire real estate developers and hedge fund managers. (1/6)

Oh well, I’m sure Trump doesn’t care, it’s all just blown out of proportion anyways! I say he still flies on Air Force One anyways, maybe have a face to face meeting with Trump and Pence while he’s at it! #whocares
All the money in the world, don't bring you happiness. Look at TRUMP's family. Both are more concerned about making $$$$ MORE!
Do some research, HCQ is the preferred treatment for COVID world wide.  The US is only country where this drug has been politicized and attacked.  Why?  Because Trump liked it.  How many have the media killed through their jihad against this effective. TDS kills
I always used to begrudgingly say Trump is going to win big in November. Then COVID came and now this. I think we’re gonna see him lose by somewhere in the range of 15-20 million votes and the house and senate are going to have near super majorities.
With Trump - 150,000 dead.   I’ll take my “chances” with Biden.
Are you sending the same message to the RNC and Donald Trump?
Matt, now you know how President Trump is treated by the national press when they won't follow up with the "rest of the story" when it turns out he did the right thing
If further proof of trump's  mental illness was needed, here it is. Trump is surrounded by doctors daily, get this man some help. He thinks it might be ok to drink disinfectants, and now he's standing in support of Covid remedies coming from a group of quack docs. He needs help.

So you think the WHOLE world is in on this conspiracy to hurt trump at the polls ? Are you a #MagaMoron or a #PutinBot ?  Tip: If you get all your knowledge from #FauxNews then you are the first one
Ok people like you is why we have trump in the WH - ppl that said both Hillary and trump are bad choices - seriously you can’t choose the BETTER alternative ??
The thing is Trump has made this a black &amp; white issue - if you want to open up then you need to wear masks and respect the virologists knowledge - we could have opened if trump hadn’t denied science &amp; hoarded PPE #MAGAmoron
You are not saying that trump knows about the economy ? 🤣😂 the best part is that he is shooting himself in the foot - we could have opened if he would have promoted masks and aided with PPE &amp; proper protocols #MAGAmorons
Donald Trump begins rolling back DACA in defiance of the Supreme Court.  “Law and order,” he has said. lolololol

GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel: Enthusiasm For Trump Higher In 2020 Than It Was In 2016
You should have gotten it by now. This is Trump's America. This is what Trump has done to the United States of America. He has destroyed it. He has disgraced it. HE MUST BE VOTED OUT
It’s astounding that Trump is JUST NOW realizing that no one likes him.   Like watching all of GOT and during the finale saying, “they are dragons in this show?”
Truth? It's OK Trump snubbed Lewis. It's one of his only honest acts in office. Racism &amp; cowardice make Trump totally unfit to honor Lewis in any way. His forced, emotionless Teleprompter speech would've soiled the occasion. A giant needs no fake tributes from small, petty men.
Is that trump country?
Gummy Trump- it’s called promoting fake news that could be very harmful during a pandemic.. I know you aren’t the sharpest knife in the drawer but when you lie as much as your family does you will have consequences. #Cult45 #DementiaDon
It’s not a joke that trump really is running things like a reality show - the whole family is garbage
Oh gummy trump you don’t want to do this trust me.. #Cult45 #DementiaDon
It's really sad that Trump's Presidency has divided the country to them vs Us.  The thought process now is, 'my side is the right side and your side is wrong.'  It's sad that we're a country of conspiracy theories…
If President Trump and his administration are fascist, then she would have been silenced year ago.  Every time she speaks she proves Republicans are not fascist.
Voting for Trump, then glued to the MSM tears. Just like 4 years ago, only BIGGER!
Lol youre a 🤡. Have you seen your buddies on the left....check the burnt cities and liars in congress promoting the portests for political gain. Its ok though. Trump will be back for 4 more years in November. You liberals can get pissed all over again. Keep Twitter
This guy loves to criticize others while taking no responsibility for his own failures. Mccarthy was silent  back when trump called Covid a hoax, and has maintained that silence to present day. Mccarthy is a hypocrite. Get your own house in order before you start in on others.
Clueless!!  Trump asks why he doesn't have high approval on coronavirus efforts like Fauci
Can we for the moment not focus on what trump wants or what he likes. Let us with a laser like focus put the needs of the American worker first, period. Enough of this nonsense.   Trump does not support parts of Senate Republican coronavirus relief bill
Like Barr saying it depends on what kind of foreign help for *trump. Like that? Depends? That's a crime. You know. I know it, and I bet damn well Barr knows it too. But anything to cling to power. Right Linds?
Or is it because President Trump cancelled the Jacksonville Republican Convention
‘Profoudly disturbing’: Trump slammed on CNN for obsessing over whether people ‘like him’ during crises

Ok. I believe Trump mishandled it early on just like most of the world but when he did ban flights from China and later Europe he was called a xenophobe by Biden.... calling him a racist for trying to shut down incoming flights. A lot more should have been done... no doubt...
What a surprise, trump has told yet another lie. THE GREAT DECEIVER is deceived by his own deception. At this point, trump probably can no longer distinguish between light and darkness, nor good and evil.  He is reprobate.

Were you surprised by any of his responses? Me either.  That's the point. I shouldn't know what he's going to say before he says it. Ask me how I knew trump was going to drag out the (boogie man) now that he's down in the polls. They always do. Same stuff, different year.
... I’ve been supporting Biden since bernie endorsed him, glad you eventually came around, but it’s a little ridiculous that it took trump going full gestapo for KYLE to even consider voting for him...
Watched the whole hearing...no questions asked, no information gathered, Democrats wanted thei 5 minutes of fame....next time just send a cut out of the Trump official...
Explain! oops! You meant to say Donald Trump is straight up lying ALL HIS LIFE &amp; worst since he became POTUS
Bravo to these great gentlemen. If only we had a president who wasn't dillusional enough to believe that he is always the smartest person in the room. trump denied the existence of Covid-19 from day one. Next, he attacked science in an attempt to cover up his stupidity.
People do this because they know that we have a president, and republican senate that are simple-minded enough to believe what they see without a full investigation. trump is easily manipulated and with zero fact checking, will start spreading rumors about anything.
ANYONE but tRump 2020! This Republican will not be voting for Trump!
What is the Democrats plan by insinuating Trump will not leave office ifdefeated?  Multiple lawsuits when Biden loses?  They will be still contesting 2016 and the 2020 elections forever?
And *trump is trying to burn down Portland.
Let’s not forget Keith Schiller, Trump’s private body guard (Russian Pee tape) who was given an $185,000 “job” with the campaign years ago in return for his silence.

No thanks.  America doesn't need anything from a trump.
Good for him. He deserves every good thing that comes his way. He has been classy, and has maintained his professionalism in spite of the crass, vicious, and blame-shifting attacks leveled against him by trump and other senate republicans.
So how is your favorite African Dr.  doing? Will you be paying her more money today for more BS?  AFRICAN DOCTOR IN TEXAS WHO IS A TRUMP SUPPORTER. SIT ON THAT ONE!🤔
What, not again. Once again, good old Dr. trump is dispensing sound medical advice. It is exhausting trying to keep track of all the buffoonery that comes from this man. You think it's a new day and maybe, just maybe, he  learned from past mistakes. That would be a no.
So this has now confirmed that not only are the entire Trump Family are not playing with a full deck, but that they are scarred shitless.  POOR FVCKER.  Who feels sorry for these #SpermSpawns?  Be Nice Now!
Hey   YOU DO REALIZE THAT THIS IS ALL HAPPENING UNDER THE MORON'S WATCH, CORRECT?  YUP. ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING UNDER DONALD J. TRUMP'S WATCH.  YUP. YOU GOT IT!  IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THIS AND NO ONE ELSE!  PUT THAT IN YOUR FVCKING NEWS!
You should be ashamed of cheering trump's inept handling of the Covid crisis. If we had a conscientious leader, thousands of Americans would still be alive. Your failure to speak up while the Denier in Chief was mismanaging this crisis is the greater shame. You failed America.
Trump call #protesters 'Anarchist who hate USA. BUT he insults/tweeted Americans are FOOLISH &amp; STUPID Helsinki 7/16/18 with PUTIN:  "Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity"#ThePresidentIsACrybaby
Ughh! this guy is an idiot. Ever heard of fact checking. It's no wonder he has had several failed business ventures over the years. And, this republicans is who you want running the country. Your continued support of this genius says more about you than it does about trump.
Breitbart is Trump news and nothing more

Dear Trump : It's called KARMA. So we're tweeting your words abt others back to you!
30 million people are still unemployed at this very moment because of COVID-19. So, you can’t talk about how ‘low’ you think unemployment rates are. Sure, the Trump administration bailed out Wall Street but certainly did not bail out the people.Of course it’s a trump guy. Racist mf
Just more proof those who's been in the government the last 50 plus years hasn't done shit to help with equality in the black communities INFACT they still ain't because they're and you are pushing to confuse and divide this country. United we stand divided we fall. Trump 2020
Oh that's right! I defied death once and am trying to hold my breath for the entirety of 2020 now that we have over 100 new COVID cases a day. I'll just continue to live in the pile of rubble that is my town. The hoaxers can go shelter in the new trump store.
LOL you know Trump would love this!
He was Dying of stage 4 cancer. There was a reason Trump tweeted about pizza and it was connected to Cain.
Too stupid to admit. The coonery and foolery is real!! You can’t make this ignorance up. Trump became a murderer and people like Paris begs him for death. Covid doesn’t play. It doesn’t care who you are.
Ouch...#NobodyLikesTrump   Mary Trump's Book Is Now Outselling "Trump: Art of the Deal"
Trump. He is the best President in my lifetime. ❤🇺🇸
Yeah. Good luck with getting any of those worthless Democrat hacks to think of anything that might help the public. Their sole focus is hurting Trump at the public’s expense.
What a horrible thing to say, Ashame on you! Why don't you put the blame on the State's and local government? Their lack of judgement waiting on the government to make choices that they should been doing! Of you wouldn't want to do that, because it's so much easier to blame Trump
Awww, did these Barbie dolls upset you jr? You are pitiful...😂🤣  Donald Trump Jr returns to Twitter following suspension to complain about new Barbie collection
He's already got multiple positions in Trump's cabinet.
Well Gee, is Louie's wife sick? Oops that's not nice.. I usually try to nicer as much as POSSIBLE. But Donald Trump and most Republican big mouth, mean as they can be, Congressmen and Senators, have made me a not-always-nice tweeter lately!  #PersonalityChange #IDontLikeMeanFolks
You literally could not be any more detached from reality. Trump is by far the greatest president of my lifetime. He has accomplished more than most presidents before him. Trump will win again by an even larger margin because people are waking up and fleeing the Democrat party..
It probably would go away if the media stfu about it. Just like the rioting went away when Trump released all them solders and the blamestream media is trying to twist it around like they're kidnapping people lmao. Every 4 years something happens.
It wasn't Trump it was faucci but you won't blame him because he's your go to guy obviously.
Team Trump must get to President Trump
Instead of trolling me do your research and read the shit. I bet you were the first to believe Trump said inject yourself with Lysol too lmao.
Retweet reminder..  Trump&amp;Administration, have worked against our Nation getting a hold on this virus, since the very beginning, and they still are. Trump doesn't care↩  Putin paying to kill our Soldiers. Does he know if Russia is responsible for Covid19?
This is why I don’t believe the polls! Explain how Biden is ahead when he has less than 10% like/followers than Trump on Facebook?
Joe, keep hiding from the public eye. We’re watching. You will lose to Donald Trump by a large margin in November!
There could have been many places that he contracted COVID-19 from. Plus they handed out mask at the rally and he chose not to wear one. Who’s to say he got it there? Apparently he had also been traveling to Arizona prior to diagnosis. Left just want to blame Trump for everything
No, it should go on as scheduled.  Trump needs to just shut up about it. He’s practically won already. The Democrats whole platform since his inauguration was get him out, and they haven’t even been able to do that. There’s no need to delay it.
Those that voted for Trump see the light and see the darkness of the loser left agenda. Once he started showing us your true colors that's when y'all started going nuts and psychotic. Who's actions should we trust. Obviously not y'all confused liberals.
He contacted it from a Trump Rally.
Trump does not have the power himself to move the date of the election, which was set by an 1845 federal law placing it the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Only the joint House and Senate can change the date. Carry on.
If the left continues to say its not safe and if no voter ID is required a delay would be the only option. I personally would stand in line in a storm to vote for Trump.
I believe that the vote will be fair no matter what!! Yes I’m voting for you mr trump. You need to try to win not think about losing!! If you lose you lose. Please stop. This makes you look weak
Actually my God is a big G not a little g. Maybe you should get to know Him. All through the Bible He works through people others discount. Trump is not perfect. He doesnt have to be because my God is. Trumps policies line up more than the left and protect my freedom to Worship.
According to, Donald "Epstein Visas" Trump, thars goood people on both sides. But more of  the gooder people are on his side than on ours, in his opinion.

Me too!!❤🇺🇸 Trump 2020
I wouldn't give President Trump too much credit. He doesn't have as much authority as you'd like to believe. The feds are there because the "protesters" were encroaching onto and vandaling federal property. They basically gave the feds permission to come in and defend that area.
well ain't that a genius in charge of the city...but his arts &amp; crafts in front of the Trump Towers was more important...smh
William Barr is so far up Trump’s butt that I don’t think he can think anymore. Such an arrogant and fool. Counting down the days and then we are coming for you, too.

The people who will refuse to get the mass-produced Covid vaccine bc they’re not sure what the government put in them, are the same people advocating for mass-produced Hydrochloroquine as the miracle cure for Covid-19 simply bc Trump said it’s good. Ignorant 🙄

Opinion | Now we know why Trump sought foreign help to beat Biden
don't bash Trump for speaking the truth when you had me censored from Facebook for posting something created by nurses and confirmed on point by nurses. You're game is over.
And Liberals honestly believe this guy can beat Trump. The only way he’ll win is by cheating and stuffing the ballot boxes... but of course he’s a democrat, it won’t be the first time they’ve stuffed the ballot boxes to win an election.

Opinion | Americans are suffering. Trump offers them a doctor who warns of sex with demons.
Yup, that’s tRUMP to a tee. I might add narcissistic moron though
who tf are you???  literally uses facts to make his points yet you have the nerve to call him disingenuous???? Seriously where do you get off?? For the record Trump will win again easily so get your knee pads ready.😂😂
Sir you are a partisan hack. You lie as much as Trump.
I remember actually celebrating in 2016 in front of my TV when #Trump won the election. It was one of the best celebrations of my life. A climatic win over the doubting #MSM  I expect a repeat! We must be heard again! LOUDER than before. It's our duty! #MAGA2020 #SilentMajority
I voted for  in #Florida. Even though she'd dropped out before our primary (which is a ludicrous part of our current system btw). I think Biden is one of the worst candidates out of the final 8-10 in the race. But I'll still vote for him over a blatantly despicable Trump!
I have no idea how he or Trump do it.  I'd be calling in drone strikes on most of those idiots.

Take Trump out of the equation. What about all the Drs that are actually treating patients?  What about the countries that are using it? Dont let hatred of Trump blind you. Fauci has  investment he wants to be profitable!
Don’t be fooled by this “change of tone” from Trump. Him telling you now to wear a mask is like gifting condoms at a baby shower.

1 - 100. Because Trump recommended it and it could have probably saved over 100,000 lives, and they would rather have dead Americans than Trump be reelected and him finally drain the swamp and expose their crimes.

America is tired. 👇🏾
Trump can do a rally without the rally by doing it on youtube.
I call BS on this article!! Trump could careless about Fauci who is killing Americans by politicizing Hydroxychloroquine. He he would admit it works instead of protecting his investments we could stomp covid out.
Good read from The Atlantic on trump
He's right.  It's also the only places all the riots were happening. It's also the same democratic ran cities that the mayor's and governor's held the police back so their sheep could attack it's own citizens. Also they make terrorist threats like this while blaming Trump.
Yes, he did get rid of NAFTA.  You have to stop reading the slanted press.  Your facts are all over the place.  Believe me, if I stopped at the first article that was critical of Trump and believed it, I would probably feel the same way you do.

Live Trump States:
It should go viral and if these celebrities talk trash too you see their intentions too. Trump is putting out the military to take down these maniacs and fox just showed who they really support by their actions. Trump is protecting citizens and they still want to bitch and whine!
If you don’t want to be reminded of our terrible president- then perhaps you should take a little Twitter break until November 4th.  Until this election is put to bed I’ll bet you won’t find anything “Trump free” on any news media or social media. Take care!
Know this; if and when the ANTIFA and BLM anarchists bring their violence and chaos out to the backwoods, Trump win or not, a bunch of them are just going to go missing. And it won’t be because of unidentifiable special police in unmarked vans.   It’s lonely &amp; dark in the woods.
My face when a member of the media says patently stupid things and people actually listen and nod as though the media member has any clue what they’re talking about.   In this case; don’t vote for Trump or there may be more violence...from the violent anarchists already rioting.
I mean do you feel like Trump is in such control that he will win no matter what, because he has to because that’s just part of the operation, or...  Is there a chance it could go the other way by people people voting, or even it being rigged?  Does he know he will win?

Trump will stop at nothing.  This is starting to be widely reported.
I just had a total epiphany.   Last year president Donald Trump signed the right to try act which gives patients with a potentially life threatening disease the right to take any medication they choose. Now we have covidd patients being denied hydroxychloroquine.  Hmmmm🤔🤔🤔🤔

This is the inane doctor a total idiot who Trump was touting today. Why? One reason among many is due to the fact that he is trying to give credibility to Hydroxychloroquine so he can unload his stash.
Kudos to Kaitlin.  Trump just couldn’t answer.  #Unhingedtrump
Barr says, “History is written by the winners.”  All I can say is if you &amp; Trump consider yourselves winners, we are in deep trouble.
Trump on a rampage pushing hydroxychloroquine again.  Could it be that he has so much $ invested in it that he’s trying to unload it?  Sounds logical.
Despite Trump's goading, Biden steers clear of 'law and order' debate: THATS BS--HE SPOKE FOR DEFUNDING THE POLICE. BIDEN IS A COMPLETE JERK THAT SHOULD NOT BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. HE WILL NOT SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE VIOLENCE GOING ON. HE IS A RACIST-HE SPOKE OUT AGAINST BUSING
It is just ridiculous! They didn’t want him there to ask questions. The Dems just want him there so they could badger him. Forget getting getting to any truth! It is all about their hatred for President Trump.
Who do you work for!?  YOU?  You have no real answers or suggestions, you answer your own questions just to rip Barr and Trump and get your BS point across.  Supposed to be an opportunity for witness to answer questions.

This is what scares me about Trump possibly being reelected there’s way too many of these kind of people out there.
Pence has been a loyal lapdog to the point of sycophancy. Replacing him sounds exactly like something Trump would do - on Twitter.
I will never understand the mindset of people who associate with Trump. Yeah, I get the "proximity to power" theory. But Trump's history is littered with people who left their relationship with less than what they started with. And that's the best case scenario.

THIS GUY IS AN IDIOT. I SUPPOSE TRUMP SHOULD LET THEM DESTROY FEDERAL BUILDINGS -HARM AND KILL PEOPLE-TAXPAYERS WILL BE THE ONES THAT END UP PAYING FOR THE DAMAGE. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY. DEFUND DEMOCRATS NOT THE POLICE.
THAT IS BS. DEMOCRATS ARE DOING NOTHING TO STOP THE VIOLENCE. THEY WANT TO KEEP IT UP TO MAKE TRUMP LOOK BAD. IF TO WANT TO SEE DICTATORSHIP LOOK AT DEMOCRATS IF THEY WIN. THEY WILL CONTROL EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE !!!
Fake news. But if the report happens to be true, it won't last through Trump's next mood swing/tantrum (take your pick). This is not the first time we've heard he's going to be more "presidential". 140,000 people could tell you how that turned out if they were alive to do so.
Watcha expect from a true Trump supporter...
Relocating workers to places Trump won to sway voters is not abuse it’s strategy
Facebook surveils us so advertisers can target us — and Trump is exploiting their business model to push lies about voting. Congress and FTC need to investigate #Facebook.
Donald Trump's re-election campaign is buying ads on #Facebook that spread dangerous disinformation about voting. Facebook’s business model is subverting democracy. Tell federal regulators to investigate!
How many more ads will #Facebook let Donald Trump run that are filled with false and vote-suppressing content? We can't wait to find out. Federal oversight bodies need to investigate — and act.
Facebook’s ads use OUR user data to let Trump spread lies and suppress voting. We need oversight bodies to investigate #Facebook and act.
Donald Trump bought ads on #Facebook making false statements about vote-by-mail in an effort to suppress the vote. I want key federal regulators to investigate.
You’re right George. This former Pres. Has qualities  that every human being let alone Pres. Should possess- heart, empathy, caring, love, devotion &amp; more. Trump’s mental makeup is totally devoid of those traits.
Public Enemy Number One  Donald J Trump Defunded the American Citizens!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I don’t want to be in the same country with Trump
Trump needs a bra to go with that girdle
I have a Trump Joke. But, it is being audited. Very complicated.
So let me get this straight. She despised Trump for the things he did to her father but now changes her opinion based on the opinion of her new husband?  Okey dokey then.
I’m one of those donors donating $25 a month. To get rid of Mitch McConnell and get someone in there that we can all respect. Wish I could give more. I too am wondering why Meghan McCain is giving you a hard time and also gave Mary Trump a hard time. Don’t understand it.
Classic Trump caring only about himself.
None of that is Trump’s fault.
For his ride-or-die culties, Trump could shoot their kids in the middle of 5th Ave and they'd be all "Eh, that kid had it comin".
Seems you have selective outrage. I’ve never seen you speak out against Trump’s deplorable behavior and demand his repentance.
TO HELL WITH THESE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS--THE LAW MUST PREVAIL. NO MORE SHOOTINGS-KILLINGS, DESTROYING BUILDINGS. THIS IS BEING DONE JUST TO TRY TO GET TRUMP OUT BUT IT WILL NOT WORK IN FACT MORE PEOPLE WILL VOTE FOR HIM !!!
Trump canceled the republican convention in Jacksonville. So, it’s not safe enough to have a convention but it’s safe enough for kids to go to school? 🧐#FakePresident #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
So this is the kind of American the republicans want?  Really?  Why?  Just Dump Trump and get our country back to what it was before him. Please.

You go girl! There is no excuse for the kind of disrespect being shown to women in general by Mr. Yoho and other members of our government in this day and age. Mr Trump is the biggest violator &amp; worst role model.
Trump on Portland mayor who was tear-gassed by federal agents: 'They knocked the hell out of him': LOL HE SHOULD  HAVE GOT DOUBLE GASSED ! OR-HE SHOULD BE REMOVED  FROM OFFICE.  TIME TO STOP THESE VIOLENT PROTESTS. THE INJURIES,DAMAGE-LOSS OF LIFE -LOOK AT CHGO LITTLE KIDS KILLED
Why isn't YOUR son's school opening in August?  Not safe for him?????
Better yet, don't elect someone who's name is Trump
Romney was so certain he was going to win in 2012 that he didn't bother to write a concession speech, proving two things: he didn't know the electorate in 2012 (and hasn't learned anything since), and he's a pretty decent writer on the fly.
And so it begins.  Trump cancelled the RNC here in Florida TODAY. All of a sudden MSM is reporting inflted numbers?!? HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK WE ARE???
Lmao same fucking ones out here saying Kasich speaking proves Joe is a republican. Apparently, it’s only THEIR votes they want him to “earn,” not moderates or never trump voters.

Where the hell are you Mitch McConnell? Do you have the guts to go against Trump in this time of crisis or you too concerned about the money your wife is raking in to stand up.
Trump knows that he can’t win the election legitimately so he’s turning every screw to see which one works I.e. messing with our Post Offices &amp; now the upcoming internal war with deployment of storm troopers &amp; more.
Trump is destroying our country with no end in site.
All I can say is THANKS Mitch!  You had the power to convince your colleagues in the Senate to remove the dictator from office. Look where we are now. Major cities taken over by storm troopers. He’s out of control!

If there is no election Trump/Pense term ends without a successor. Guess the idiot doesn't realize that puts Pelosi in office Inauguration Day.
Trump's flailing has become so excruciating and desperate I can't watch even one second of him live. I trust you and a handful of other respected journalists and opinionists to feed me his nonsense in tolerable bites.
Trump keeps on doing all of this stuff which is outrageous and nobody seems to want to stop him after Republicans agree that he's doing things the right way why can't somebody stop him and Mitch Mitch is just as bad
listening to trump tonight at 6pm spew lies is sickening. If mail in ballots are not safe, then he shouldn't be allowed to vote that way! This crazy man has some serious mental issues! Where are the sane Republicans!  Please get this mentally sick person out of office!

Pres. Trump urges plasma donations.
That's called COVID-19, idiot. That's not on Trump. If anyone, it's on the liberals because republicans want to stop the benefits while liberals want to continue it. As long as these benefits are going, people with minimum wage aren't going to want to go back to work.
He attended trump’s Tulsa event where it was taboo to wear a mask and be socially distant
When is the last time Trump went to a funeral?  Maybe Herman Cains?  Probably not, might interrupt his golf game.
His blood is all over Trump's hands.  Where was the hydroxychloroquine miracle drug?
First, Hermain Cain...now Bill Montgomery, founder of  . Both dead of the plague they helped to create. Dying desperate, alone and suffering. Let us take this moment of solemn reflection, on the nature of cosmic justice.
Is there any other Republican looking to stand with  call for Trump authoritarianism other than  and #BillBarr? Time to stand up GOP! Honor above party.
Not one bit. All 3 are part of the corrupt deep state that has robbed the American people of their freedom and dignity for years. They are the epitome of the swamp that Trump is draining.
That moment Donald Trump says he wants to suspend the election, and you realize we're all Gary K. Longstreet now.   Irony.   Time to end this #AmericanHorrorStory .     HELL NO
Cuomo is not the president. Trump should have lead the nation. He’s an ass.
Trump floats unprecedented idea of delaying election, which he cannot do
When Jesus meets the religious people of his day - a group called the Pharisees - he straight up calls them exactly what they are: hypocrites. He says they make themselves look good on the outside, but on the inside they are really ugly. Trump is a ugly liar.
Trump is a racist for lying about banning travel, tho ...
1. Trump and his minions accused Hillary of running a pedophile ring out of a pizza place in NY. 2. Trump always projects 3. Anonymous releases court docs stating Trump is pedophile 4. Maxwell in custody, and Trump wishes her well 5. Trump hawks pizza place in NY on twitter Hmmmm
Trump's election tweet draws fire from Dems and acknowledgement from GOP that MAIL-IN voting is a major concern.
Because in April he attacked Biden for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election and well, Trump just suggested to delay the election. Haha
Not true.  Many of us are voting Trump so we can keep what we work for.  Some of us suburban women have to work and don't sit on the couch in yoga pants watching talk shows and daydrinking while their kids play video games.
I believe Trump had to let this play out.  Fauci destroyed himself.  It needed to be done without interference.  Yes we’ve suffered through the FAKERY but we’re alive and safe.
Trump floats November election delay - but he can’t do that  #SmartNews
Because it wasn’t this broken until Trump started breaking things!
So Trump wants to “delay” the election, as expected. Just a tad afraid of losing? I believe it would be unconstitutional and the move of a petty dictator. He won’t go away quietly.   Maybe he will just go away “like a miracle.”
I appreciate the tax cuts. They really helped my family. Also Seniors on Social Security received their biggest cost of living raises in many years. Thank you President Trump for doing your best to keep campaign promises.

Twitter Reacts to Herman Cain Getting Coronavirus Post Trump Rally
Herman Cain died from attending Trump's Tulsa rally. Good thing not that many people showed up.
Barack was and is the birther. He and Moochelłe wasted more of our money on their little dates to NY and vacations in Europe and Hawaii than the Trumps. I am sure that President Trump uses his own money to pay for his family's excesses. Remember, he does not take a salary.
Trump worships at the altar of Ebenezer Scrooge.
What a bunch of 🐂💩 President Trump has been a great President even though he has had to fight you "Swamp People" all the way. I am not ashamed of voting for him and I will vote for his re-election. GOD BLESS AMERICA AND OUR POTUS. 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️

Great idea.  Only helps Trump.  Black and brown suburbanites want to protect their investments just as much as white suburbanites.  Education and home ownership, you are on the wrong side...
Let me postulate for just a moment: Y would they want to make it difficult to run for federal office: because they’re opening the flood gates, which Trump is trying to close, for people from authoritarian states whom they will need to rule over.
'My blood boils': Trump's admission angers ex-GOP lawmaker  AS MINE DOES ALSO. WE NEED TO REMOVE TOXIC TRUMP FROM OFFICE ASAP. WHY IS  TRUMP STILL IN OFFICE TODAY? AFTER ALL THIS TOXIC PRES. HAS DONE TO SO VERY MANY AMERICANS?? REMOVE TRUMP NOW. KG.
Then Trump will forfeit the election by not taking the field which will award Biden the presidency by default. Trump will have to be removed by force.
Trump actually likes working Americans. It's the Americans not working that he would like to see go back to work.
Imagine being the #Democrats and killing this many people!  just so you can say it’s  fault! just so you can win an election. so you don’t go to jail! #Trump has said from day 1 #hydroxycholoroquine is a cure! These assholes tell u it will kill u!
Pretty clear Trump was elected in 2016 against Democrat and Russian tampering in election.  Talk about that sabotage, Chris.

This is Trump's America. No badges, no cameras, and no Miranda rights read.  These are not police serving the people. These are secret police serving the establishment. They are violating citizens rights to serve a narrative that America isn't in the power of Nazis and KKK.

This crap has to stop, how can trump and the resnublicans get away with breaking the law, to what they say is upholding the law, the constitution doesn't mean crap in this country
If Fauci had his skin in the game, he would have filed for bankruptcy by now.  If he would have panicked early, after predicting a pandemic, we wouldn't be dealing with this bullshit.  Trump is not a doctor nor probabilist. Fauci is paid to prevent these events.
The worst part about this election for me isn’t that Trump might win.  It’s that losing this election won’t put back all the revelations of racism, classism, and just destructive ideologies I’ve read &amp; heard from people I trusted and looked up to these last few years.
Hard agree with this take. Let’s not pretend this is Trump’s desire and there aren’t a whole bunch of people who have been pushing for this for a long time and are cheering right now.
His attitude?  So, it's cool for the President to say "all this for a flag" and sell our country out to foreign countries,  but Trump has an attitude towards rioters and looters and this is an issue?  Sorry, you are just NOT thinking clearly and have shown us all.  #Trump2020

Because Trump knows it would be hypocritical to ask after the US paid bounties to Osama bin Laden to kill Soviet troops in Afghanistan in the 1980s.

So how do you clear trump without anywhere near full investigations and condemn the Clintons after YEARS of investigations that found nothing??
No one is laughing about that🙄And you are proving my point! You say that rape claims against trump have”been proven” to be false. NOT TRUE. There is a case in court right now...all he has to do to clear his name is give DNA..and he won’t. The 14 yo girls case wasn’t proven...
No one is going to jail. Politicians, celebrities are somehow above the law. Money gets you everywhere. There will just be a lot of posturing. In the end, nothing changes. Been that way for decades. Thought Trump would fix it, but 3 years, years later, nothing.
I feel Susan Rice is the best fit for VP, not that the others aren't up for the job, but with the relationship that's been destroyed by trump, Susan with her experience would be the best choice!

Bahahaha...are you seriously celebrating a list of trumps accomplishments put together by....trump???? 😂😂😂😂
If they are too lazy to get a job, crappy or not, they do not deserve the benefits. They only claim the benefits because they get more through it. They should be grateful for what they have received. But, no, they just want another reason to cry and attack the right and Trump.
As I said, this is resulting in a bad economy and people like you want to keep a bad economy just so you can blame Trump. If you really care about the people, why don't you give everyone in the country $600 out of your rich pockets.

Trump hates Americans think about it.🧕🏽👵🏽👨🏽‍🦰👨🏾‍🦳👩🏼‍🦳🧔🏻👩‍👩‍👧👨‍👨‍👦‍👦
trump is exhausting so is fox republican fake news.💙😷🌊🇺🇸🗳📫🩸🤕🤮🤧🌊🌊🌊🤟🏼
I do agree with you, though, about trump and de vos.  Neither of them care about anything other than their goals.....whatever that may really be.
She is part of his ticket to infamy.  "The Trump name will live on!" In China.  In Russia.  Doesn't matter if he trashes America to get there.
If they go back to Trump because they got called on their actions, then they really DON'T MEAN THEIR APOLOGY.  You Stop it.
I’ve got a great place to hold the debate. 2 podiums on either side of the Lincoln Memorial with the mediators appropriately placed. No chance to spread or catch the China Virus &amp; a great place to watch President Trump verbally whip Joe’s bumbling butt!
After Trump signed executive order widening availability of prescription drugs to help lower prices, pharmaceutical executives refuse Trump outreach.
"I used to be all for Trump and his racist, nationalist, womanizing grifter ways, but now that I'M DIRECTLY EFFECTED, well I just can't agree with him any longer".Why is it that I keep meeting African Americans that I have never met before, that have no conservative connection to me or anyone I know that love Trump? Hmmm
Its Angela Merkel that's giving Russia billions of dollars in gas and oil sales, while Trump tells her shes an idiot for doing so. Trump has given Ukraine lethal weapons to kill Russians. Trump is currently moving US Troops from Germany to the Poland/Ukraine border against Russia
Welcome to Floridian journalism. They put the duh in Floriduh. What a fuckin idiot.
Trump murdered Hermain Cain for a rally. 150,000+ more were killed for less. Trump will let more than 1/4 of a million die before the end of August unless something radically changes.
Jim Inhofe and Mitch McConnell who have a combined age of 163 years Old, are Cowering to Dems and Denying President Trump the right to replace Holdovers at the Pentagon, cause Dems are mad that Tata Hurt Obama's feelings..It's time to retire Guys, you're too Old &amp; Tired to Fight!
We love you president trump
They are desperate! ...
So instead of entertaining an idea as absurd as Trump unilaterally delaying an election, something which there is no mechanism for him to do, let’s instead worry about how we’re going to hold that election in the middle of a pandemic.
The question is not whether we will have an election on November 3rd. It’s whether or not Trump is able to sow enough chaos to squeak out a win. At best, what he’s doing now is just him trying to delegitimize Biden’s victory, not actually delay an election.
I know it can feel like Trump can do anything sometimes, but he can’t. He is repeatedly stopped in the courts, by congress, and by his own ineptitude. The only stuff he does get away with is stuff that involves Senate Republicans or his own cronies.
Then January 20th arrives. California held its elections so Pelosi is re-elected. Trump is constitutionally forced to leave. The Roberts court will deny any challenges because it’s CLEARLY SPELLED OUT. Pelosi is sworn in. Trump is kicked out by the secret service.
Most of the illegal shit Trump’s done has been confined to things the toadies in his own administration are willing to do. In order to delay the election WITHOUT congressional approval, he’s going to need to be able to simply declare “election’s off,” and...
Alright, genuine question: what mechanism is Trump going to use to delay the 2020 election?
This is exactly how Trump wanted y’all to spend your day. Exactly what he wanted asked in his stupid presser. Instead of the GDP news. Instead of why he has not paid tribute to John Lewis. Instead of why he’s protecting the White House with a bunker.
Just a thought. If Trump got his way and ‘delayed’ the election, both Trump and Pence would constitutionally be out of office on Jan 20. The Speaker, 3rd in line, would become Acting Madam President Pelosi. Pass it on.
If Trump had mandated masks at his Tulsa rally, Herman Cain would still be alive.
Forgiving George Wallace. He apologized to John Lewis, while Trump will never apologize for his racism and bigotry!
If you’ve had enough of Donald Trump’s chaos and corruption, here’s one way you can help end it.  Chip in ANY AMOUNT to attend the virtual grassroots fundraiser with  and  tomorrow and let’s sweep Donald Trump into the dustbin of history.
So self respecting woman votes for Trump.  Every mom I know is sick and tired of the dangerous and divisive DJT bullshit train and will be voting straight blue this year.    ...and I'll be looking forward to seeing #denialdonald removed forcefully on  inauguration day.
A Half-Century After Wallace, Trump Echoes the Politics of Division
What happened to Herman Cain was predicted.  Trump knew it would happen to a percentage of attendees.  That’s why he made them sign a liability waiver.  He was ok with it as long as he got to have his rally.  I can’t understand why both sides aren’t outraged.
Imbecil, that's why Trump did prison reform, because police, including elite FBI, bully people into taking a plea. They do it to minorities too often or any one who is their enemy. These agencies have too much power.
Sounds like Trump is trying to cheat by electronic voting and vote by mail blocks that.
Please stay on this Stephanie. This may be one of the worst flagrant abuses since Trump has been in office. And why? it makes NO sense shy of profiteering...the question that is everything is who knew on Monday? Who acted? This is not something even Barr can simply brush away.
But not in a racist way.  Someone is going to show me how the lives of Trump voters who wait all day to see him freestyle on the mic....have inproved since 2016.  They look like the same dirt poor inbred Whites I would see when we drove by the trailer park.
This is called voter suppression folks. Trump is going to lose and he knows it.
Interesting how Trump thinks we can’t have a safe election under Covid, but we can send our children back to school. #DumpTrump2020 #BlackLivesMatter #freeandfairelections
Your kidding. Trump has never felt responsible for anything in his life. He is a psychopath.
It’s fairly clear that he chose to vilify the science behind mask use to please Trump. He put his faith in a charlatan rather than the true experts. That loyalty ultimately cost him his life.
Yay, Fox and Limbaugh and friends!! Got you hooked on some major nonsense. China was “propagated”?? How has Trump dealt with Russia for 4 yrs?? The “pallets of cash” thing is pure propaganda. Isis, North Korea comments are just silly.
Your Trump interview was pathetic.
This is a very nice tribute from President Trump.
Every time a trump supporter dies I get a chub.
Trump admin raises $25 million overnight in Kodak play
in your interview, didn’t Trump say he’d have a new health care plan to reveal in two weeks? Two weeks is coming up on Sunday. Will you follow up with him? Millions of Americans want to know.
Yes! Florida schools open early and everyone I know with school age kids are not sending them. My sister has opted to officially Home School both hers as it was required to decide in early July and DeSantis has been pushing for in school. Hate that guy almost as much as Trump!
Remarkable on the same day of an exquisite  memorial service for a remarkable man John Lewis , we hear Trump talking about postponing an election. Don’t let this happen Don’t let John Lewis down
I'm voting Trump unless I'm dead, God willing.
You media people couldnt stop talking about Steele dossier when you thought it would help you get Trump. Now that Steele might hurt you and help Trump.........crickets
Calls for immediate impeachment!  Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Imagine telling someone to stfu because they don’t share their viewpoints. People like you create Trump voters because the left is doing their best to not have conversations and jump to calling everyone villains and racists. This isn’t how you win people over. Be better.
Trump can say the same thing about Putin!
Anything but anything to tie Trump to this. Anything.
Trump is so out there, I swear he has lost his mind.
idea of a solution. I don't need to trash Trump to make my point. But whatever Trump sees when he looks in the mirror, and what Trump claims to see when he looks at Joe Biden are so far away from the reality.
It is amazing how little self-awareness Trump has that he would call Biden a "buffoon". Biden is self-effacing, humble, humorous, riant, generous, spirited, fit, loving, a goofy grandpop, a kind (if not overly permissive) father, a supportive &amp; proud husband. His friendships are
Trump has a schedule?
This is the most heinous act of his entire presidency. He is our Commander in Chief. His allegiances to Putin R scary and dangerous and Vlad is a professional ex KBGer he knows Trump is in over his head and stupid. Really stupid. He’s a traitor and shld be tried as one.
There was a time when I thought it couldn't get worse than Dubya, but in the face of what we're going through he's looking mighty fine these days.    This is what real leadership looks like, and Trump having no presidential qualities is another reason #WhyIDontLikeTrump
Barr did not know that legally Trump cannot change the election date. Why didn't he know something so basic? Isn't he the AG?
Watching from the USA. It’s a much fan as it is to watch trump and his 5 nouns, 3 adjectives and 3 verbs.
Trump, you are the biggest asshole to ever run this country.  Bitch be be gone.  You are the virus that effects us.
A virus he caught at a rally in Tulsa that Trump insisted on having despite the recommendations of experts.  Clearly, #TrumpVirus and #TulsaRallyVirus are both more appropriate.
He might just quit.
Fort Lauderdale man accused of making threat to kill Trump, complaining about his COVID-19 response
Keep in mind that Trump is smarter than the Generals!....Putin puts a Bounty on Soldiers lives!  Keep in mind that Trump is smarter than the Doctors......150000 deaths so far.  Keep in mind that Trump is smarter than Economists......6 Bankruptcies and the collapse of our economy
after attending a trump rally without a mask ... sorry .... but ..... 😂😭
Trump Says-  I Think He's A Little OFF when he says "The Younger" are Immune or LESS at Risk to Contract the Corona Virus"  I Think Anyone Born Between 1960/65 to 1990/95 Developed A Tough Immune System based on Those Times they Lived In &amp; Things that They had to deal with!   ???
I could only listen to #Trump for a few minutes.  He is playing the victim role right now. He is experiencing severe #NarcissisticInjury.  He is depressed, paranoid and delusional.  In my opionion, this is dangerous. I am concerned about his state of mind and what he may do.
Completely unbelievable. A desperate Trump is a dangerous Trump and we're getting nowhere with this guy.
Time to watch Hulu instead of listening to trump who is a lying POS about Portland.

Keep in mind that Marv and Trump were often at odds over hotels and casinos.
Pompeo defers to Justice on question of Trump election tweet
Donald J Trump threw the media the delayed election bone, and they ate it up.🤦🏿‍♀️
Please tell trump about the bar-coding and tracking through the system.
The utter nonsense coming out of Trump's mouth right now
The babbling idiot Cowardly Liar Dotard  Trump blames Democrats for Republicans wanting to screw everyone except big corporations. Trump wants to funnel all the relief money to corporations who they hope will trickle it down to citizens.  Years?
trump is so stupid that he thinks ballots are generic. Each ballot is bar-coded with a person's name &amp; address and can be tracked through the system.
Donald J. Trump regarding Washington Post it’s fake news only when I say it’s fake news...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Take that moron Trump OFF the television. We don't need to listen to him LIE and LIE and LIE. It makes me sick just to hear him talk. Stop covering these stupid press conferences.
If the farmers are doing so well, why is there a shortage in the food supply chain? #trump
tRump is asking Democrats to get on-board to help Americans!  how long have you waiting for Republican approval of democrats plan. He is so manipulative that people think he’s right 🥶🤮
An endorsement from trump. The kiss of death. (Hey Donald, I heard there was a child sex ring in the basement!)
It’s a shame he died like many others after Trump Virus rally in Tulsa... 😞
If his economy is so great, why do we need an economic bailout? #Trump
trump said Florida cases were coming down, they are NOT! Cases increased over 71k in 7 DAYS!
It is my observation that Biden supports China fully, Why? They do not Want a strong President like Trump, so they are Financing Sleepy Joe &amp; the Dems fully against Trump, so they can continue to abuse our USA and the world. #MAGA2020! They are in for a big surprise!
What Trump doesn’t understand -oh never mind, everything
Trump is in office thru at least 1/21/21.. no? And the Senate can still confirm a new appointment to SCOTUS by new years eve.
Where is the original?
Herman Cain died from the Trump Virus that he caught at the Trump Rally. How many more will you kill?
Opinion | Trump’s suggestion to delay the election is the most anti-democratic thing any president ever said
Trump shutting up is a plan I am down for!
WTF did Trump really just say Herman Cain died of the “China virus” ????? thought we handled that misnomer months ago 🤷🏻‍♀️VOTE AMERICA
As much as the GOP pretending there’s a shred of decency in Trump; can I just say when they pass around total lies about both Nancy &amp; Hillary I go 🥜?!
Even worse--he said "it would be an embarrassment to the US" when everyone knows that Trump is the GREATEST embarrassment to the US.
That is such great news and thank you President Trump we will never hear this on the news
Jordan, Gohmert, Nunes, D. Collins, the Trump Spawn &amp; spouses, Mulvaney, HuckaSanders, MacaNinny, Gaetz, Crazy Rudy, Rubio, Scott, DeSantis, Cornyn, Kemp, Cruz and everyone sitting at the Trump Hotel &amp; Bar Breeding Ground.   They can all go to Maralago and stay there.
That whacky doctor who backed Trump’s touting of hydroxychloroquine may have uncovered an important link to “alien sex.” Apparently many of the women screwed by Trump describe it that way. Good time for a House Investigation. People might read this one. #DumpTrump2020
That poor family is being used as Trump-props. He's not going to get to the bottom of anything. He is incompetent-- non compos mentis.
What they are saying is that if Flynn is pardoned, he loses his 5thA rights and can be jailed to testify before a GJ.  If he refuses to testify, he could then be held in contempt. Of course. Trump could then pardon him from the Contempt and around the Merry Go Round we go.
By adding a question mark, Trump did not thereby change the necessary implication of his tweet, i.e. that the election should be postponed. Punctuation does not make an affirmative statement into a question if the meaning is otherwise clear.
Ali I can't believe we are here again worried about the Democrats stealing votes which we witnessed in Broward county Florida in 2018. Please listen President Trump ! Ali would be one of your best advisers .
Do you really think the current DOJ would haul Mike Flynn before a Grand Jury were Trump to pardon Flynn?

Yes, Donald Trump’s election website. You can’t make this stuff up, or wait, I guess you can. Lol 😂
Well, Donald J Trump did get impeached because he was scared that Joe Biden would win the Presidency in 2020.🤣
Help me here. I don't understand the concept of Maga. Trump has been president for more than 3 years now. Does the slogan has to be something like keep America great ? If greatness has not be achieved in last 3+ years, how he will achieve in next 4 years. I am not mocking.
This guy is such a disingenuous fool. Every single day Donald Trump does something that would have sent Conservatives into a frenzy had Obama done it. Obama speaks as a private citizen and Erickson is all righteous anger. What a hypocritical dope.
Just read what Trump tweeted .If it’s not safe to vote until January 2021 then the $600/week should be extended until January 2021.

Imagine Insulting a bot.
I feel no guilt in saying I have zero remorse for these people.  They encouraged millions to risk their lives to please Trump, and they led by example. Their deaths should serve as an example, too.  This is not a thing I would have said four years ago. Blame Trump &amp; his enablers.
I would rather Barney run the country at this point trump needs to go 💯💯💯💯💯
we only vote Trump in my FL suburbs
Congrats   Another new record.  I bet if you keep opening more things you can kill more people!  Trump is so proud of how many people you have killed.
Should we do a Go-Fund-Me for the post office?   Trump has made us a pathetic country.
Which is why it was a lovely service. Nobody needs Donald Trump. We need a real president.
Trump you are the biggest fraud of a president this nation has ever seen.  You will pay big time for it.
Anybody seen Trump today?  No. I thought not.
Very SAD that now the Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump is asking COVID-19 patients for blood. Appropriate after trying to take away their health care, unemployment, food stamps, and jobs. Way to go asshole  Trump.
According to Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump,  DeSantis and  Gohmert, Republicans should not wear a face mask in public for fear of catching the COVID-19 virus, and should gather in large groups and share loud personal discussions in solidarity.
Judging by my Twitter timeline, I think I may be the only one who is quite pleased that Trump didn’t go to John Lewis’ funeral.
Why sir are you concerned about mail in fraud? You have not been concerned about what your Senate intelligence Committee found with Russian involvement in the 2016 election in favor of Your golfing buddy Trump.
Trump Can’t Delay the Election—So He’s Trying to Make It a Chaotic Mess  because you don’t have the votes.  You don’t have the votes. You don’t have the votes. Yeahhhhhhh
Trump is so uneducated and ignorant he wouldn’t understand anything President Obama said in his eulogy. Trump has about 5 nouns and 10 pronouns and 3 verbs in his vocabulary.
Trump has no shame!
Congratulations on another day of record cases and deaths in Florida because you're a fucking idiot like your mentor Cowardly Liar Dotard   Trump.
Vote red or this is what will be running the country. Trump 2020.

Are you also wondering how many regular, ordinary, non-public figures also died as a result of the ill-advised Trump Tulsa rally that killed Herman Cain?  There are certainly others.
Remember this trump! RIP but if he had wore a mask 😷 to YOUR reckless rally in Tulsa he would probably be alive today! trump the #coronavirus is NOT A #HoaxVirus it’s REAL which is why including Cain 150K⬆️have died while you advocate not wearing masks😷👎🏽#NotMyPresident
You and ur father scare me trump.
Trump is a sad little man. Probably upset because absolutely no one wanted him there today. #PettyAsFuck
I don't think it's going to happen anyway but if Trump delays the election it may not trigger the mechanism that seats Nancy Pelosi. I think that she only becomes President if there isn't a result but an election has to take place?

Trump did a major disservice to the family of PFC Vanessa Guillen by having an event on the day of John Lewis's funeral and at the hour of President Obama's eulogy. They deserve to have their story heard. There is no way that the meeting had to be today.
Obama's eulogy at John Lewis' funeral was a political speech, these are same people that accuse Trump of church photo op
Trump tweets to bypass the press. He has said so himself. If his plan was to troll the press he has ample opportunity to troll them directly.
Vile and vicious Trump
Got a plan for you Marco. You’re a political opportunist. Send a signal to Trump that you would delay the presidential elections. What the heck! He’ll be pleased with you and you’re presidential aspersions will continue since it’s not about integrity for you, it’s about you.
I hope Trump listened and heard how real Presidents sound!
World wide deaths for Hydroxychloroquine from heart arrhythmia during 40 years from 10s of millions of doses total 54
Dear Trump Fans,  1. There is not a person on this earth that is “trying to abolish American energy.” That is a fact so why is he saying that?? 2. No one is going to suddenly “take away all you guns!” Maybe some better control but that is all. Fake Fears help none of us.
Trump should shut them down
Children want the normal they were promised. It isn’t happening because of the ineptitude of the Trump Admin &amp; the entire US government as a whole.  Even if we make it through this global  pandemic, we‘re traumatizing young people, ruining their present &amp; destroying their future.
There seems to be an emerging trend at the funerals of American heroes - Barack Obama delivers a stirring eulogy and Donald Trump isn’t welcome to attend.
Trump plays her like a fiddle
Throw paper towels at him! #Trump #TrumpIsNotWell
Just going out in a state that has 10k+ cases a day and higher than new york now with a governor that will never do anything cause he's a trump fanboy is... concerning
If the trend is your friend ... The trump notion of delaying The election ... would mean the Donald’s numbers will keep going down ... and the GOP with him
If you’ve had enough of Donald Trump’s chaos and corruption, here’s one way you can help end it.  Chip in ANY AMOUNT to attend the virtual grassroots fundraiser with  and  tomorrow and let’s sweep Donald Trump into the dustbin of history.
Hahahahaha. He knows Trump better than the people who support Trump, a vast majority of whom are outright saps, marks...
Finally you show the world the Dictator that you want to be. But it won't work for you and by January 20th, 2021 you will be shown to the door of the White House that you rented from me and you wasted my tax dollars for the past 4 years. No Mister Trump! I'll dance to your loss!
I didn’t watch it because Barr is a liar.  Thanks for this. We know he is a white supremacist just like tRump !   💙💙💪🏼💪🏼
Laura reminds me of President Trump always ahead of the curve ! If you want a true leader in Congress that will fight for Us ... Vote LauraLoomer
We need to end the debt ceiling, end government shutdowns, do more to bolster the Justice Department’s independence, abolish ICE, put new limits on executive power...  The GOP found so many ways to sabatoge Obama and enable Trump, and we can’t let that go on.
Looks like Dr Birx gave up trying to somehow educate Trump and is speaking truth to America. Late, but better than never. It will be interesting to see if Trump throws her under the same bus as he has thrown Fauci.
On one hand, Trump’s crimes are so many and so blatant, it’s hard to imagine them being ignored.  But I’ll bet it’s also awfully tempting to just do what they did with Bush, and just focus on the legislative agenda.  And even there we probably won’t do enough.
Pelosi and Reid let Bush skate because they thought impeachment would be an electoral loser. When Obama won, no effort was made to punish members of the Bush administration for 8 years of lies and gross incompetence.  Trump already forced Pelosi to impeach, but will they do more?
My biggest fear is Trump somehow pulling out a win in November.  My second biggest fear is Democrats not being willing to do enough to repair all the damage when they’re back in power.  I am a proud Democrat, but one thing I’ll never forget or forgive is how they dealt with Bush.
It’s a shame all 3 drank too much of Trump’s Kool-Aid and wouldn’t listen to science and the doctors
Unfortunately, we have consistently seen Trump stomping our laws and the Constitution.  Constant Impunity and refusing to follow subpoenas &amp; ignoring Supreme Court directives. Trump lawsuits have been his tactics for years. No service done minimizing danger from Trump &amp; Co.

Herman Cain survived stage IV colon cancer.  Donald Trump’s rhetoric and disinformation is literally deadlier than stage IV colon cancer.

Yeah blame him for everything. Trump 2020.
More trump lies
#Trump is testing us.  We are smarter than he is
So how are our November elections looking
Trump has accomplished much criminality with complicit, Greedy &amp; likewise grafting Republican Congress with no ethics &amp; lies. Please make a note of it and understand the jeopardy.
Hoping nobody else who attended Trump’s ego show in Tulsa, OK, is ill or worse. #HermanCain
Golfing with Trump?
The question is how weak and desperate is Trump willing to appear?
Trump is another level
Vote the trump administration out completely
Donald J Trump is THE GREATEST EMBARRASSMENT TO THE USA!!!
We could all die and trump would not give a flying fuck. If you truly think he cares about you at all, you’re buying a narrative that expired decades ago
Trump 2020. If you want communism vote the other way. Government controlled every aspect of your life.
Please no one tell Trump that if there's no president elected by January 20th then Nancy Pelosi becomes president until one is elected. His reaction will be priceless.
Trump could hand Putin the nuclear codes in the middle of Fifth Avenue, and his supporters would still vote for him.
Herman Cain's death is on Trump's head. Cain got this at the Tulsa rally. Another good man lost due to  ineptitude.
Trump floats November election delay - but he can’t do that:  someone should give Trump copy of Constitution to read.
I agree with the statement however, Trump encourages his "followers" to endanger themselves and in doing so all of us.
Trump 2020.
You should probably have a look at that data ur suppressing. Priorities?
Oops wrong answer from the supposedly smartest guy in the room?? Pompeo is so smart that he constantly lies for trump and power. That’s pure evil.
Yesterday, I put out this tweet to highlight the dangerous stupidity of those forcing coronavirus on us &amp; mentioned the fact that Herman Cain, who got coronavirus after a Trump rally, was still in the hospital.  In light of the news that he has died, today I would call it murder.
Isn't this Hydroxychloroquine ban nuts?
PS: That all expires on July 31st. Come join the winning team and join other Republicans who have seen the light and support Joe Biden and Democrats who won't kiss Putin's ass and won't constantly let America down like Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump has constantly done.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
It is beginning to look like the Trump fans are bound and determined to commit suicide and take as many of the rest of us as they can with them. Or, they just really, really stupid!
I feel sad because this was so preventable.  They keep listening to Trump to their deaths and we are powerless to do anything to get them to listen.  I have tried reason, I have tried angry it’s no good.  They are just hypnotized by this con man. 😢
I am not aware of the China Virus but the COVID-19 virus continues to cause unchecked havoc in America because America has a dumb-ass pig-headed Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump as our president until November when the FBI will arrest him for cowardly acts against America.
"A recipe for Disaster "             TRUMP
If He weren't Murdered by Trump in Tulsa you could have met him?
The pandemic is surging, race issues at all time important crossroads, worst economic numbers in history today, #JohnLewis has died, #Trump’s friend #HermanCain has died from a disease he caught at a  rally, 1,400 people died of #Covid yesterday... he tweets this
Actually sorry about this - he was one of the less toxic members of the Trump admin, and he had actually done some good in his life. But in the end, he got on the Trump Train, and it killed him. R.I.P.
Trump nationalizes it.
Does Cowardly Liar Dotard  even realize his phone calls with Putin are recorded by the FBI? He would be stupid not to. The FBI can't arrest him now because Trump's little bitch AG Barr said they can't. But after the November election they can.
so you agree that what Trump is trying to do with pushing back the election is treason?
Trump step down and take DOn JR and Eric trump with you.
Trump are you saying that when you lose , ur not leaving the ppls couse.
I think you should take as much Hydroxychloraquine as possible. Also, I encourage you to support the President by finding indoor Trump rallies/outdoor as well. Just remember masks are for the enemy of the people. DO NOT WEAR ONE! Thanks and have a nice day!
Ohhh. It’s a “harmful idea”. So is the deaths of 153k citizens who are vastly more important that a grifter con man like trump.
This is sad. One line of thought is that he brought it on himself and endangered others. His, at best, naivete that led to his demise in a little over a month is still tragic. Responsible leadership from Donald Trump would go a long way to prevent unnecessary death
does  have proof President Trump killed Cain? Because that’s what it sounded like I just heard in a HARD NEWS report
Will this news encourage the right wing to wear a mask? He was last seen at Trump's rally in Tulsa without a mask,. Now he's dead.   Former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain dies after battle with coronavirus
BREAKING: Herman Cain, has died from Covid 19. If you remember he attended the tRump rally with no mask. RIP.
Before people freak out:  No, Trump can’t actually delay the election. Only an act of congress can.  He floats dumb shit like this literally all the time cuz he has the impulse control of a toddler.  He constitutionally HAS to leave office on January 20 without an election.
Donald J Trump is trying to distract from the US GDP loss of 32.9%. He knows that he doesn't have the authority to change the date of the general election.
This is one of your crowning achievements. Like the 1,000’s of deaths, infrastructure, Trump Care and a 33% drop in our GDP.
Trump should b supporting our drug companies encouraging research and development....he is on the wrong side of the debate
TRUMP
Something broke in 2016 when Trump was elected president.
Trump tweeted the election stuff right as the GDP calculation comes out because he’s the worst president ever and still doesn’t have an actual plan to fix this country he’s just preserving his own wealth and power.
President Trump floats delaying the presidential election, citing his own prediction of fraudulent voting
I'm pretty much resigned to the idea that we won't make any meaningful headway until after the inauguration.  Assuming Trump loses and we have some form of blue wave.
Trump Trying to stop Nov election  Trump does not have the power himself to move the date of the election, which was set by an 1845 federal law placing it the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November The date could move theoretically with action by Congress.
Legally, this is called redlining. A charge Trump paid dearly for in the 1950s and 1960s. It led, quite rightly, to the 1968 Civil Rights Act. Trump is an evil con man. #DumpTrump2020
Trump did you listen the gdp dropped 33% in April May June 2020. The worst ever. However we have the worst president ever. November cannot come quick enough.
Trump is a ridiculous, tiny man.  I'm less frightened by him than I am furious of a GOP which has literally decided to stand by and watch him careen our democracy off a cliff.  Every one of them must go.
If Trump wants to have even a chance with women voters - QUIT SEPARATING CHILDREN  REMOVE CHILDREN FROM CAGES NOW! STOP BORDER DETENTIONS OR WE WILL VOTE YOU OUT, and LOCK YOU IN A CAGE with STEPHEN MILLER and a CONFEDERATE FLAG!
An NPR investigation has found irregularities in the process by which the Trump administration awarded a multi-million dollar contract to a Pittsburgh company to collect key data about Covid-19 from the country's hospitals in the midst of pandemic. Suspicious connections.
Trump just suggested that the 2020 election should be delayed because of possible voter fraud. We have paid  taxes by mail. The Census is done by mail. America voted through two world wars and Vietnam, often by mail. Trump used it. Trump is killing America. #DumpTrump2020
Donald Trump thinks that the Emergency Powers Act of 1976 gave him the power to postpone the election. He is right. The Emergency Powers Act of 1976 created the imperial presidency. We lost this battle 44 years ago. We are standing on the edge of the precipice.There will be blood
I'm sure the Republican controlled Senate would back Donald J Trump.
If the trumps don’t leave the building ... the transition will still go on ... they won’t be in charge  ... and will have put the trump brand beyond redemption ... and they will forever be untouchables for what they have done to America  ... perhaps that is the final comeuppance
Putin told his sad little bitch to do it and Trump always does what Putin tells him to do. Trump has still done nothing on Crimea except sending money to Russia to "help" Crimea. Maybe time to remove Trump by force?
I just can’t stand it when the word of the president is treated with such seriousness as this. Trump says things for attention, often in an incoherent way. The media adds context to his lies, we can’t be doing this if we want things to change.  Hope you &amp; the fam are safe &amp; well.
The only one who is a great embarrassment to the USA is Trump.
"Trump tells voters in suburbs they will ‘no longer be bothered’ by low-income housing"
So the flaccid Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump is building a railway to Mexico and a pipeline from Canada to Mexico that will spill oil across America just so rich oil billionaires can make more money. Republicans won't impeach Trump so America needs to vote Trump and Republicans out!
All they have to do is reverse the $3 Trillion tax cut they gave the rich 2 years ago. Why doesn’t some Democratic suggest that, I want to hear the GOP scream and yell how unfair it is. Trump created the problem we have today with the tax cut.Trump and Barr have NO power to delay the election. It’s just a distraction from his disastrous pandemic response and the worst economic downturn in US recorded history.
That’s because the left has no morals. Of course they used his funeral as a political platform. Look who’s their candidate! Sleepy dementia Joe. He’ll NEVER debate President Trump. He doesn’t have the balls.
Why? He knew the facts yet ignored them. He was a cancer survivor so he knew he was compromised. His support of Trump was more important than his or his family's health...
If it is postponed, there will be an immediate cure for COVID-19! The msm will start focusing on the delayed elections and attack Trump.
So if Trump has been doing this since his first day in office.. why is ot still one of the largest problems we still have in America? Shouldnt it be solved or at least gotten better by now? ARE you suggesting #TrumpIsWeak
Fuck that  Medicare For All Cancel Student Debt Abolish Private Prisons Green New Deal Net Neutrality  Tuition Free College Housing For All Legalize Weed  You Republicans that paved the road for Trump to enter power do not get to dictate when or how we fight for our policies
So if Trump has been doing this since his first day in office.. why is ot still one of the largest problems we still have in America? Shouldnt it be solved or at least gotten better by now? ARE you suggesting #TrumpIsWeak

So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
Something is missing in Trump. Something essential to being human. Bush made some very bad decisions and listened to some people he shouldn't have. He is a much better ex president then he was a president.
For real? I didn’t know that... wow. Rudy... you should be ashatof yourself. Like trump loves to say “that is nasty”. Lmao. 🤮
He’s the head of the Federalist society and just now says that trump is a fascist?  Wait. Haven’t we known that for three years?  The tweet this more all of a sudden turned him. Pfft.
Everything is a joke that trump says but really what happens when its not a joke none of us will ever believe in this liar in chief for anything. If his lips are moving he's Lying that's DERELICTION OF DUTY TRUMP YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
Lost the most American lives in recent history. No that was Trump. Worst Stock Market crash in recent history. Trump. Worst GDP contraction, ever. Trump again, Joe.
Nice try, but you’re an enabler of Trump. You’ve do it for 3.5 years....Vote!!!
Since when anybody ORDERS TRUMP anything ??😂😂
I see ! Maybe because he did not recognize President Trump ???🤡
I retired at 61.5!  If President Trump stays, you’)) be fine!
Trump killed Herman Cain at Hia Tulsa rally
Who cares....MoscowMitch has enabled Trump for 3.5 years. Vote!!! #MoscowMitchMcConnell #TrumpKillsAmericans #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Remember this article.
Pllllease, do some research before voting trump and subjecting the American people to this “person” again. There’s so much information out there that proves he does not care about doing the right thing, or you, or anyone but himself, power and money
Trump needs to give this little fuckrunt the heave ho..
Fox News is NOT news - Pllllease, do some research before voting trump and subjecting the American people to this “person” again. There’s so much information out there that proves he does not care about doing the right thing, or you, or anyone but himself, power and money
Trump is actually already doing it Mr. **** QAnon
LMBO  "Twitter isn't enough space to change minds, I just troll 45." We all have that fam member. Mine is 2K miles away. No 1 ever spoke w/him anyway. The poem on the Statue Of Liberty reads: give me your tired, your poor, etc Trump says: What the heck, give me your deplorables!
Press: “Next, do the Alphabet!” Trump: “There is something called an English alphabet. It’s a very very Patriotic, American Alphabet. Nobody’s seen anything like it before! In fact, I’m hearing China doesn’t even have ONE and we have like 3. 3 is small, but not compared to 0.”
Who the fuck would campaign for Trump?
It’s crazy ironic... #Trump has been obsessing about a wall on the #Mexico border forever (ya know, to keep “them” out).  Now, due to the way the #Trump admin has handled #covid19... Mexico is literally one of the only countries in the world allowing Americans to visit!!
Trump tryna delay elections 😅😂
Trump Meets With Family of Murdered Ft Hood Soldier Vanessa Guillen, Offers To Pay For Funeral [VIDEO]  #MyPresident #Trump2020
Truly!  Every single one of Trump’s “best people” all lack one other obvious thing, in addition to your list- from Betsy Devos to Herman Cain. Compassion for anyone other than themselves. Not a whit of it anywhere in this administration.
China Virus? I know he died from the "Trump Rallidiocy".
Experts dismiss Trump claim that it could take 'years' to declare election winner
Well, I’m glad you are coming around... please &amp; always, vote... Voting by mail has been done for a long long time and has less than .002% of fraud—the only reason Trump doesn’t want vote by mail is because if people vote, he loses!
The one that pisses me off the worst is Trump 2020...no more bullshit.  As if the last 3 1/2 years have been anything but!
Provided we elect President Trump for 4 more years, we are vulnerable to these rejects all over again in 4 more years!
Why Trump Might Quit  via    I used to think the same thing but now Im convinced that  will dump Pence for Nikki Haley to show he too can have a female running mate
Demand every last BLM protestor, rioter, anarchist, ANTIFA, white, black, brown, red, Covid +, immigrant, DACA, millennial, gay, lesbian, trans, suburban housewife.. whovever. Get out and vote!!! If not, let Trump bash their heads in for the next four years. They asked for it!!!
It’s because those reporters were chosen to ask those questions. Anyone with balls enough to ask about putin bounties or trump’s epic failure on c19 might receive an angry tweet or lose access. Oh the horror.
Don’t you think he was tested before he was allowed so close to Trump? Herman Cain is tragedy but it’s about individual choices.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.
Of course he is. Trump is going to undermine the results and declare himself the winner. Welcome to authoritarian rule! Democracy and the USA is finished.
This is why Donald Trump is president. Racists like this.
Well at least it’ll backfire on trump. His approval was low during the government shutdown.
Absolutely correct, Governor DeSantis sits at the knee of Trump, both must be voted out
Trump does not care about Americans period he’s a socio pathic career narcissist and we don’t need Mary trumps book to tell us that. He’s a career liar .
Trump’s comments on rescheduling the elections convinces me further that he won’t accept the election results if he loses.
Our idiot Governor DeathSantis is listening to his master Trump. He's a darn mini Trump. He's going to get voted out.
Trump’s voter fraud and mail in voting tweets have no evidence. He is supplying false information.
No. I didn't get to make my point. Would you mind listing the things Trump has done if it's convenient?
Trump himself said he doesn't joke
Chump change compared to the Trumps.

Trump literally hasnt even given condolences kn the passing of an icon.  Yea so let's falsely say ridiculous things as the president now hides in his bunker.  We miss Obama and we all are counting the days until the loon is out
Y’all gonna vote for trump yet claim you care about child trafficking?!??? WHAT
Too late, he sat by and did nothing while Trump betrayed his oath, our country and allies.
Remember over the spring many “primaries” got delayed/changed to accomodate the shut down. State govs may be inclined to change election dates/mail by dates in an effort to “accomodate” (ie: round up) voters.   Trump knows whatever he proposes Dems will be against. HydroxyC, etc.
That didn't age well.. I don't want to speak ill will of the dead but he was a grown man that chose to ride or die with this hoax and paid for it. he literally died for Trump.
Trump's admiration of dictators probably getting lessons on how to take a democracy to a authoritarian dictatorship using our own judiciary and laws against us.
I believe Trump is responsible for all the COVID deaths
Dana Perino! Wasn't she the press secretary  for Bush? That was the worst administration in history...I mean until the Trump administration
The covid response was a total disaster for Trump. Instead of asserting himself as a strong leader who didn’t prescribe to the mob mentally he went along with the narrative from the shutdown imbeciles and lunatics. If anything is going to be his undoing it will be this.
Pogue is a Trump hater. Berenson must not have been a very good reporter  #hydroxychloriquineworks
Love this shirt! Got it from  #share #viral #Trump2020 #Trump #trumppresser
If Trump calls Portland protesters a "beehive of terrorists" then what do we call his Cabinet???
I actually do get along with him. We just disagree on Trump. Thanks for your input, I feel like a much more fulfilled human being. Don't forget to inject bleach against COVID-19 and protect yourself at night from demon sex..
I don’t think there’s any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
Don't believe this guy; he's as anti trump as they come. "Science" is trash when the analysis is designed to come out a certain way.  #hydroxichloroquine
save the USPS. Trump will defund until there is no mail at all.
Trump said that he could shoot somebody and they'd still support him. Well he didn't need a gun in this case.
That reasoning never crossed Trump’s mind.
Pogue is an anti-trump with 100s of anti-trump tweets, including disparaging tweets about Sarah Sanders.  Which means his "analysis" has ZERO credibility. He has a clear agenda.  #Hydroxychloroquine
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally where he likely contracted COVID. No mask. No social distancing.  Stupidly following Donald Trump in denial of the virus... #TrumpKillsAmerica
He said it.   The most RIGGED ELECTION ever. Mr. Putin. Can you hear me??  Donald J. Trump is the most DISGUSTING excuse for a human and those who still support him.

Poor Rob has been trolled again by Trump.  Guess he thought he would spin you all up and as usual, you didn't disappoint.  Hilarious how easy you all are.
TRUMP CALLED IT THE CHINA VIRUS AGAIN. EXPECT VIOLENCE ON ASIAN AMERICANS TO GO UP!
Only Trump and Barry can’t use the thread button.

Good thing Herman Caine knew the Lord and is in the presence of a Holy God. Herman was a grown man. Since he had cancer he knew the risk&amp; made his own mind. So don’t blame Trump.
Remember Republicans were the ones who fought against every election integrity bill! Follow their money to Diabold who makes the voting machines. It all comes together as to WHY they are so terrified with mail in voting.they need to cheat to win. FUCK TRUMP
Again, it’s trump saying something without doing something. Bark vs bite. Amazing people haven’t figured that out yet. Everyone calm down.
#SpecialReport Excellent press conference from President Trump!
Actually Trump is the embarrassment but it also shows you he’s running scared🤣🤣🤣
#SpecialReport Absolutely President Trump, open the schools!
Donny Trump is off the rails today.
I said memorializing not memorizing. But the whatabout trump supporters don’t read
#TheFive Good idea President Trump, if school stays closed, send parents the money so they can send their kids, to an open school!
Psst.....Trump wanted to leave Syria
Trump is high and clueless as to what McConnell has not done. He sat on this bill since MAY
#TheFive Yes President Trump,  we need kids back in school!!!
...and plus Dems bill sat on McConnell's desk since MAY! Trump is high!
I thought usually it took grabbing them by the .........to get him off.  #tRump
What’s up with Trump’s face?  Did he forget to put on his makeup?
Let him try. Maybe It’ll keep him busy while the clock keeps ticking. Plus it’ll keep him distracted from future Trump distractions. And they’re coming.
It's the trump virus

Trump Takes A Victory Lap Over Alarm Sparked By His Push To Postpone Election Day
Looks like Trump thinks all voters in Florida and Michigan and other states are all Democrats. He appears to be shooting himself in the foot. Republicans vote by mail too...right.

Do you think they purposefully ignore actual degenerates so they can claim Trump’s base are horrible people overall and people will believe it?
Trump may not drink alcohol, but he's sipping at that #DemonSemen
have to second this...  i probably see 20 or 25 trump stickers/yard signs/etc for every biden one... but i hardly see any biden ones, if that makes sense...
I rarely, if ever, swear in public, Twitter or Facebook. But I find myself swearing at the TV when GOP goons like Gym Jordan, Doug Collins, Mnuchin, Nunes, and, of course, their Idiot-in-Chief Trump open their mouths. No one else makes my blood boil as much as they do. 😖 😡
#NobodyLikesMe WHY is Media continuing to air the gaslighting - I have been off all day your boycott is going to start       and remember all figures are lies- bff trump owns that company 😷😰😡‼️

Sorry, that makes no sense whatsoever. People die in pandemics, and b I'm sorry fur your loss. However, while Obama acted decisively to fight against H1N1, Trump has done the exact opposite. He has countered and maligned the very people he should have been listening to along.
One of my followers made a good point.  Trump was impeached, doesn’t that make it illegal to be re-elected?  Even if only the House impeached him it still stands. HE SHOULD NOT BE ON THE BALLO

Why would Project Veritas put out a video critical of Trump?
Trump is such a child. President Bush gave a eulogy at John Lewis‘s funeral even though John Lewis didn’t go to Bush’s inauguration because of the Al Gore/BUSCH recount election. Trump didn’t even pay respects to Lewis when he was lying in state in the Capitol. Not presidential.
4 years ago :
Well almost 4 years in , we know Donald J Trump is not an elected official ! he was placed in office by the Russians. #DonaldTrumpIsIllegitimate
Trump doesn’t care if more of his voters vote by mail. Trump doesn’t care if vote by mail is popular. The best opportunity Republicans have to suppress the vote is by reducing the number of urban voting sites where voters can vote. That’s the plan!
First of all, Pomeo’s smirk aside, he’s clearly not in in “the joke”, secondly, didn’t Trump tell us recently he “doesn’t kid”?
You honestly believe there is no possibility of voter fraud with millions of ballots floating around?   What if GOP wins, are you still going to take that position?  Is this exactly why Trump is making these statements? To take away Left arguments of “fraud” once he wins?  🤭🤔🧐
Trump should say that breathing air is good so the dems stop
I have sleep issues, but they're more likely caused by my spending too much time on Twitter rather than worrying about the pandemic! 😳 🙄 And my addiction to Twitter is totally the result of following the resistance to Trump's disastrous administration. 😡
, my pleasure. President Trump must be reelected!
All of those points he Trump wants to but the Dems won’t let him
So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you’re proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain’s death was a result of YOUR negligence.
Republicans against Trump
Republican Voters against Trump. I believe she’s in Ohio.
History will remember Donald Trump in one way and one way only: as an accessory to the murder of tens of thousands of Americans. And amazing legacy
I don't think so loll trump is done
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! 😎
I sense desperation in the air....your years as an enabler to Donald Trump are costing you.
Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
Your right it’s just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Thank you! He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally. He said (in caps): "people are fed up". He was a selfish pig. I save my sadness 4 the innocent pple who died because of them. The chickens have come home to roost! Ana is not rude just factual!
. is a partisan hack. And a Trump-sucking sycophant. And an asshole.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
Thanks to Trump and his corrupt leadership for our country going through this terrible epidemic Virus! All Trump cares about is his real estate and his selfish needs to be against the Medical professionals that we have to unite as a country to get this Virus out! Trump👎🤥
Why not flip flop it would extend your demise. If you support trump you’re a racist.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
Or goes to jail... Cain was a big boy. He, along w/ Trump &amp; the rest of the goons, have caused many innocent people to die. He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally &amp; said that "people are fed up" (in caps). They deleted it today.
He needs flippers &amp; a Speedo!
Completely agree. But theres that filibuster rule, etc, plus each member of the senate would have to give a little speach abt why Trump is evil, etc.   Maybe they could do it faster. Obvi, it would be priority #1. Trump would be on lockdown!!  Lol
Have they heard Herman Cain just died because of trump virus??
Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
yo Brent I found your girl.
We must stop trump and his enablers.  Their incompetence has set our country back decades!
Very disappointing to have Trump I hope he is finally getting out and we can get our Country back to the people first!
DeSatan hitched his future to the wrong wagon.  He, the Tea Party faction of the GOP, and Trump are finished. Their ineptitude to govern, their refusal to listen to scientific experts have relegat3dmthem to history’s garbage heap.
Just got to wondering. Were there “White Voices for Trump”, or does Trump automatically speak for them? Also did any previous Presidents have Black/Latino Voices for them?
Never
Biden will almost certainly win Maine by double digits. U think there will be a lot of Collins/Biden voters? I’m more skeptical considering how much Collins is tied to trump.
WOW! what a service #JohnLewisMemorial . What I am curious to know is why Trump was not at the services? As a leader of this country he should have been there.
. we're coming for you. Each and every one of you. We will crawl over broken glass to vote. We will wear hazmat suits to vote. We will stand in line for 9 hours to vote. On Nov 3, we will annihilate the Trump Republican Party. We're taking back our country. GTF out of our way

trump has no friends only uses people, name one true friend he has?

Hey Palmer, maybe you could help me with this question... at the end of August 2016 Hillary was leading Trump in almost every major poll and we all know what happened at the end... how can we be sure that’s not going to happen again?
Makes you wonder what President Trump is actually up to doesn’t it? I trust
Parents aren’t going to send their children to slaughter for you and who you pray to (Trump). You decided to listen to the lies about the virus 🦠 from Trump and his enablers. You reap what you sow. You are following the Herman Cain path.
He’s a fraud plain and simple.....Can’t believe Trump keeps him
How the hell does Trump keep this fraud?..very discouraging
Trump and GOP running up $3.7 trillion deficit this year.
TRUMP HAS NO AUTHORITY TO MOVE THE DATE OF THE ELECTION. HIS GORDY DECORATIONS AND HIS BELONGINGS WILL BE OUT OF THE PEOPLES HOUSE BY 11:30 ON JANUARY 20TH. I HEARD PUTIN ORDERED A PLANE TO PICK HIS UGLY SHIT UP. HE CAN DECORATE THE KREMLIN WITH HIS UGLY BULLSHIT FUCK HIM &amp; PUTIN
Today Trump suggested delaying the election. Obama was reinforcing John Lewis' belief "When you see something that is not right, you must do something," "Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part."
And Trump voters are conservative, so what does that make him? Your claim was specious and an attempt to discredit the original point, which is that by and large Republicans and far right groups are the biggest pushers re: reopening/masks are ineffective/covid conspiracies.
I highly doubt that! This right here is what the Democratic Party has become. Vote them all out!  🇱🇷TRUMP 2020🇱🇷
Them they criticize Trump at Rose Garden
Trump is more afraid of early voting 🗳 then the actually Election Day🤔 but want worried about it in 2016 🤷🏾‍♀️
The more people who get sick, the more of an excuse Trump and Barr will have to try and postpone or suspend the election. Remember, has no bottom and will do anything to win. Cynical? Perhaps...
No Trump is

As a Trump supporter how can you defend making voting harder.  You can want your guy to win, but ar what cost?!  What country do you live in if it totally ignores the value of voting?!
What bothrs me is this, like everythig else Trump does, lying, cheatg, ppl he appointd all do whatevr he says evn if it sounds like it shd be against the law.  I don't undrstand how he can get away with all this garbage, including bringing other countries into our elections
Biden down only 2 in a GOP poll in a district trump win by 17!
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally. No mask. No social distancing. Likely contracted COVID because he stupidly follow Donald Trump. #TrumpKilledHermanCain #TrumpKillsUS
Here's when it will really be fun: When an intrepid reporter asks Mad King Trump, "So, what did you think of President Obama's remarks at John Lewis' funeral?"
Thank you, Obama!! Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, takes aim at Trump over voting rights, protest response
Rest in peace Herman Cain. Hopefully others will learn from your misplaces trust in Trump.
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally. No mask. No social distancing. Very likely contracted COVID by foolishly following you...Blood on your hand!!!
U act like Biden hasn’t said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...Why are Trump supporters so ugly 🤢
FU Graham!! Stop pandering to trump for once! You KNOW that election fraud is basically nonexistent! To get a ballot you MUST be registered, the ballot MUST be sent to the registered address and the signature on file MUST match the returned ballot. THEIR IS NO FRAUD!
I guess scumbag trump can’t hear well, I am sure Nancy will have the voting done honest and fair and on time, but now would be a good time since it it ok to send kids back to school
He attended the Trump rally during his life.... I don't see the problem. Keep shying away from the facts that don't align with your point of view, ostriches seem to get along just fine.
I totally agree especially for Presidential election mail in ballots should not be allowed only in extenuating circumstances.   President Trump just to let you know stop wortrying if Man likes you you are here to please God not man. You are the best President ever! Ok !
If Biden wins pandemic ends  If trump wins they’ll create another pandemic   Democrats have run out of options.
Daddy Trump has to sign off on it, which he will, do our accounts will be stimulated by the end of the month 🤸🏽‍♀️ hopefully sooner
Was not trump who impose this was the governor
is it really possible for #trump to get elected 3 terms?
it’s the trump crop top for me!
I've had 10 months straight of 100+ kills in Eve for the first time ever, the Trump Virus has been good for blowing stuff up! #tweetfleet #eveonline So silver lining I guess?
I was wondering when Trump was going to address the trending. The hashtags are childish to say the least. If y'all gonna troll, troll smart.
I hope and pray every Democrat knows that trump has put his crone in charge of the post office, so if you vote by mail chances are,, you lost your vote,, get off ur ass and go to the polls
That is good,I would bet Mr. Lewis wouldn’t want him to come, he is still a better man then trump will ever be
⁦ Trump why don’t you go hide out in the bunker because that’s where your residential picture it will be posted. Shame on you. You’ve just showed 🇺🇸 how much of a true racist that you are. Jealous Of John Lewis’s legacy , just like Pres Obama
Hey Donald you weren’t invited! ⁦⁦ shame on you Trump! #WeWillMakeSureToVoteYouOutThisNovember
yeh the news doesn't really put numbers in perspective and discard the false the data-- And oh-- the other red states will follow with increasing alarm rates because that means no Trump rallies.. BUT , lets all gather to commit crime. #FakeNews #TruthMatters #AmericaWakeUp
So you believe if Trump quits golfing nobody will ever die again? Dude, I hate to break it to you but people are going to die no matter what. Even after we quit talking about Covid, people wii continue to die.
No Trump is not the 1syt line of defense for a local city. How long have ALL politicians in both sides been in office? And you wanna put all the blame on 1 man who has had less than 4 years? USA was doing great before covid
Hey  when will you learn EVERYTHING TRUMP TOUCHES DIES. That includes 1000’s of #Florida residents &amp; your political career once we boot you in 2022 for your utter incompetence during the #COVID19 pandemic. #RonDeSantis #RonDeathSantis #ETTD
This is exactly why Trump will win again.
Kamala Harris I think you would make an amazing vice president. I had difficulty with the stream I watched as much as I could. We need to elect a Vine for a 2020 president. This catastrophic epic failure in the White House Trump needs to exit stage left. #EnoughIsEnough
The whole "There will be a time for this." is why Trump is here in the first place.
We want you and Mitch we’re coming for your seat. I’m sure Vlad will have a place for you and their government Trump too... Bye-bye #100DaysToTheElection #ThatGuyTrumpHasJustGotToGo I meant that piece of garbage has got to go. Four more years I will not be sane no longer
Did you see the latest CBS poll? Trump wins Ohio. Sad.....
Actual U.S deaths from covid are severely inflated for reasons for example to blame and make Trump look bad. The Dems will stop at nothing for power.
Will there be an actual debate between Joe Biden and trump?
Joe flipped, he’s done.  Guess your for the crazy. Never liked Trump, he’s a bully for weakness, however he’s the best choice against the fall of this country.
Wow he is such a freaking winner....... just another dumb ignorant Trump bitch. Oh racist you betcha! #ThatFatBastardInTheWhiteHouseGotToGo #OpenYourEyesPeopleWeAreBecomingADictatorship.VoteForJoeBidenVoteJoeBiden2020 #VoteJoeBiden2020
Not only trump,,, the whole damn Republican Party, if they so interested in dictatorship they need to go to Russia
I don’t like Donald Trump, but I have to admit... it’s not a bad idea if kids are remote.
Better vote Trump my man.
😂 I thought maybe you were a republican with some integrity. But then I remembered no republican can support trump and have integrity. The two are mutually exclusive.
You think trump fields tough questions??   he doesn’t answer anything straight forward and nothing is his fault. He’s a privileged 4 year old who boasts about picture tests. All of you orange occupant supporters are WEIRDOS!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Perfect, I love President Trump!
I'm hoping that all of Trump's supporters and enablers end up in prison or in a hole like Sadam Hussain.
Ya don't think everyone in the vicinity of trump is tested daily or more? Lol smh
you might as well vote for trump, it’s illogical to “write somebody in” especially when the opposer has a great # of people who WILL be voting him

Republican support for wearing masks leaps to 58% after Trump wears one in public for first time   They are so weak and spinless.
Under the TRUMP administration, the US had the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression!  We lost 192,000 American manufacturing jobs, wage growth was averaging just 2.2%, and 14 MILLION Americans left the workforce and around 800,000 went into poverty!   Fixed 😂😂😂
This is not true. Trump didn’t do shit for me. Take it from a black guy.
This is on the conservatives. Can’t even argue that. Mainly the trump administration. And they could care less
Have we lost our minds?  Children are currently dying of COVID-19. Teachers are currently dying of COVID-19. Loved ones are dying of COVID-19.  But Donald Trump/Betsy DeVos/Ron DeSantis/Richard Corcoransaid we need to open up schools or else.   🤷‍♂️
trump the thing that could ever make better would be if you flushed yourself down the toilet
Somebody should ask Trump how he feels about this at a press conference.
july 23. .  2020.  DONALD J TRUMP IS THE BEST PRESIDENT EVER
Except, it’s literally Trump’s America! Like, currently/right now! 🤡😜Bravo friend, although, Cain got what he deserved! I hope Trump is next!
BRAVO! HILARIOUS! If Trump died right this minute,  more than 100,000 innocent Americans likely would not die by November .
I am a Vietnam Vet DAV, etc... and you don't speak for me, Bozo. Choose between Trump and a socialist takeover. You are either uninformed or you are NOT a patriot.
Conservatives, you DON’T have to support Biden to stand up against Trump.  is a clear and present danger to the US.
Time for Trump to go!  These kind of statements go against everything regarding democracy in this country. This is the last straw with this man!
Hey Dirt bag, Get with the program. If Trump came to Wyoming they would vote your ass OUT. Your so disconnected with the voters of Wyoming.
Donald J Trump is responsible for Herman Cain’s death he believed you you lied to him
No it’s your fault for calling it a hoax and not dealing with it for three months it’s Donald J Trump’s fault! #TrumpVirus
Friend, after the outrageous attacks on every level of our great nation for the past 4 years by Trump and his criminal administration it's just now occurring to you that something is wrong... You are likely too slow to offer anything of use to America.  Sad.
Bravo friend! The shirt is more than many people do. In part, many are fearful of becoming a target to these angry, ignorant, criminal, violent Trump supporters.
Another Trump success?
Bravo! Hopefully Trump and his crime family are next!
Ha ha ha ha! Laughing my ass off! Let us pray that Trump and his crime family are next! Lol
No David, you don't have to wonder.  Of course that's what he did, that's what he always does, like a 6 year-old in a  74 year old body. The great news, Herman Cain died! Bravo! Now on to Trump and his whole family of nasty, dirty criminals!
Pelosi must adress the inevitably of moron Trump,the Putin operative,who possibly cannot get re-elected,to  desperately hang to Power,..the only way being delaying the Nov 3 Election!..
The Trump Depression! Maybe, " The Greatest Depression In American History. " Trump would perceive that as something to celebrate.
Trump’s Never Wrong... He Just Talks Like A Schitzophrenic! It’s Real I tell ya (he slaps his own face) It’s Alien dna, (he slaps his own face), It May be that Corona thing! The cycle repeats! Madness
Yeah, you killed him at your very poorly attended "rally" in Tulsa. Lured him to his death.  How many other people did he, through your negligence, infect with this DEADLY Trump Virus?  Hope you are all happy.
So, I did speak to a supervisor and they told me they don’t have to do that anymore. New policy. New PM General appointed by Trump. I appreciate your input tho.
You are so misguided, the problem is BS out of the Democrats is destroying our country. They are willing to destroy our country because they hate Trump. Trump is damned with anything he does Why was H1N1 under Obama worse than COVID but the country wasn’t shut down. No mask 🤔

I can’t stand Trump &amp; won’t vote for him but. um..Biden is just as racist as Trump if not more.He has a long history of racism.He voted AGAINST desegregating schools for Gods sake.  He uses women &amp; minorities for their vote.That’s it.Neither of them are ideal.we need a woman. 🤷🏻‍♀️
I’m not saying she is.I’m saying that all the normal celebrities,most of them vited for Trump.I would bet my life on it. It’s been leaked and shown many times.And no ones stopping watching movies &amp; listening to music and buying products. So a BB plyr is the least of the prob
95% of every celebrity u watch on TV and listen to’s music votes for Trump then pretends they don’t for Clout. If u dont think those millionaires are voting their tax bracket then they r doing their job at fooling u.
I haven't voted in a long time , 2020 is Trump's year 💞

They shot it down because Trump uses it and it does work if taken at the early stages( pre vent) this is political and the democrats are paying alot to hospitals to keep people sick and more if they die from covid. That means the numbers are so inflated. Sad
Trump by a landslide
Well well well hey democrats times running out, November 3rd! Trump by a landslide! Trump 2020++ vote republican ticket and enjoy the fantastic results!! Trump will MAGA guaranteed!!! All true Americans need to vote out all crooked democrats!!!! Guaranteed this is going to happen

The economy first, healthcare, uniting country. Plenty of time to get Trump.
Wasting votes. All efforts should be to get Trump out of office. With him goes Barr and all of Trump’s lackeys.
Fire Barr and ALL Trump’s minions. Unite Americans. Then dismantle all Trump’s Executive Orders. Make healthcare a priority.
It’s all about the money even at the expense of political correctness for them. THey got their names in the news as anti-Trump by mandating masks but when people said ok we’ll shop somewhere else they caved.
So eat Trump.
Yeah that Obama economy was going great. Continuing at a surprising pace. Then Trump turned it so it went down, down, down, down.  Foreign policy? For dictators, against our allies? Hated throughout the free world. What a terrible legacy, which you helped create.
Aren't they Trump associates?

You also one payroll tax on this next bill that gives us money you should be the shade payroll tax has nothing to do with this it just help Donald Trump
don't forget the infamous recount in 2000 and chose Trump tooIf Salvi is correct...then Trump did the legally correct response...Federal action would be so limited by Constitution...and liberals would have blocked it in court
Trump is trying to sabotage the election and suppress votes because it is the only way he can win.  He does not care if people die, he just wants the economy open so his numbers look good for the election. Trump has failed the US as the pandemic continues to grow.
Why I have no problem calling libs "Mask Nazis".  There is no proof Cain caught Corona at Trump rally.    If he got near any protestor at Trump rally...that protestor could have been carrier...many of them at BLM Protest with Al Sharpton night before
I wish you had this same energy when we found out trump knew about Russian Bounties on US soldiers and still haven’t did anything about it !!
Yeah, bullshit. That’s the official Republican excuse every time Trump says something racist,  illegal or flat out stupid. He was “joking.” Pathetic. 🙄
To watch the lemmings in the media follow it off the cliff  . . . hysterical. People think Trump's dumb,  and sometimes they are right, other times he's playing them like a fiddle.
WISHFUL THINKING TRUMP YOU ARE PACKING YOUR BAGS IN NOVEMBER!!!
you bemoan Trump using mail-in ballots as a device to change the subject from Covid or the GDP plunge but then all you do is talk about his mail-in bs. You're victims. cc
I can see this happening but it’s a bad idea because it would do the opposite. The next president has a responsibility to hold trump accountable.
Lmao you must have been living under a rock this year. Trump did more harm to America this year alone than all 8 of Obama's years. The 150,000+ deaths are on Trump's hands. They're stained with the blood of Americans.
It was horrible listening to his bullshit !   Obama is a uniting voice for everyone.  Trump only want cc white supremacy
What if a foreign government came to monitor the elections so Trump can’t cheat.
Might want to look at the environment around you. Where people are being forced to wear ankle monitors just because they MIGHT be sick. That's not Trump doing that. But, then again, Obama was the only logical person on the Left.
Donald Trump should resign, pass it on
I don’t know whether to cheer or be suspicious.
Great!  But, ⁦ - This doesn’t even come close to redeeming yourself from your utter #Covid fiasco. And I pledge to do everything I can to see you NEVER hold public office again in my State.
Trump has a press conference spouting nonsense about other countries' covid problems. The media then takes the bait and argues about that instead of telling us the facts about the US. Wise up. Remember 2016. Shiny objects. Get it.
If Trump contests the election, we better take to the fucking streets.
Trump will NEVER have that.
I'm not concerned about what you are doing. I relish questions to our leaders. First question, why did Trump ignore the virus potential for months? Why did he brag about grabbing pussy? Why did he have raw dog sex with a porn star?
Do you realize that you're trolling Trump with that tweet.
personally, I’m shocked Ron DeSantis hasn’t done this immediately after Trump’s tweet, considering how quickly he agreed to open schools after Trump said he wanted schools open.
Trump couldn’t write better commercials himself 🇺🇸 #Trump2020Landslide
what would be more fun? just quickly picking up trump then throwing him out onto pennsylvania ave, or a slow and agonizing drag from the wh residence, onto the ellipse, out the gates? "no, no, very unfair, polls were rigged!" the whole way
its never happening but can you imagine if biden won then asked for volunteers to remove trump after he refused to leave? the line would be so long. we could raffle tickets and fund health care for a year.
Add in Dc and PR and Dems will hold power for decades     ...Trump is saving this country #FourMoreYears
If both Trump and McConnell lose, it will be a dangerous time.
Trump looks so scared/surprised like he ended up in the wrong place
No covid19 vaccines 💉 for me under any circumstances. Any and all circumstances NO VACCINES
RIP Herman Cain.  He attended the infamous Trump Rally in Tulsa in June without a mask and no social distancing.  His COVID-19 illness erupted in July.  Enough said.  This is not a hoax -- everyone should take this pandemic seriously!
Had Cain went to the BLM event the night before in Tulsa...nothing would be said.  However...he was at a Trump Rally...
Throughout this, I've often thought that if I were an epidemiologist or virologist, I'd say "screw, y'all!" and move to a country where I don't receive death threats or accusations of being a Marxist who wants to destroy America whenever I share research that contradicts Trump.
Is this like when Trump said he’d have a big scoop on Bill &amp; Hillary the following Tuesday or when he said Melania will have a news conference about her resume’, still waiting for both.
Wonder how Trudeau backers feeling as it came out their Liberal Wunderkind has been using US Republican (Trump's Party) Marco Rubio's campaign staff in some of his shennanigans 😁
You sure got a point, Brother Bakari, but, then again, it was "Us" against the Electoral College, Trump, and Putin. We were outnumbered.
You have missed the point. He was blasting Trump during a funeral service. Btw I support Trump. I have a MBA, and am not stupid. Like most crass liberals. You are quick to say diversity and inclusion but quick to criticize  those who you disagree with. Hypocrite.
When  crushes  on November 3rd and Trump’s team starts floating the idea of a pardon, I hope Biden laughs in their faces.  Also, I wonder if  has started making plans for dying in prison of old age.
Herman Cain just as likely caught CoronaVirus from BLM Antifa Protest hosted by Al Sharpton, held nite before Trump Rally  Event had staff work BOTH events, &amp; were most likely to get close to Cain during entering rally venue.  Trump Rally moved up 1 day due to BLM #RIPHermanCain
I trust President Trump, I don’t trust Dr Fauci or Bill Gates. HCQ + Zpac + Zinc is the answer to Covid19. Why did they conspire to allow the deaths of 150,000 Americans and counting ? Why do they continue to conspire to kill Americans ? For money 💰 ? For partisan politics ? 🙏🏽
He boycotted 45 inauguration based on Hillary lies and called Trump illegitimate
Are you talking about me and me family? Because we voted for Hillary in 2016, we are Latinos. And we are going to vote for Trump first time
Good luck with that, Kamala.  Count me as one who didn’t vote in 2016 who will vote Trump in 2020, and Republican straight down the ballot.  My 3 kids also didn’t vote in 2016, and are all with MAGA.  In Florida.
So...doesn't seem to have helped much. We have 4% of the world population and 25% of the deaths. Doesn't look like anything Trump did helped. He's still not helping. Let's not forget he's hyping treatments the FDA did not approve. Ignored wearing a mask for months. SAD!!!
Trump is such a baby.
Donald Trump is a Trojan fighting on a horse defending us from Russia. Pass it on!
When this goddam  nightmare is finally over and gone, we are going to find out Trump’s  &amp; most Republican Governor’s pathetic response to #Covid was a purposeful attempt to keep voters from the polls. They were &amp; are WILLING TO LET AMERICANS DIE!
Trump Derangement Syndrome may kill you faster than Covid 19, you may want to take a chill pill!
For anyone who says No, move to another country. Because the only reason for not liking Trump is because he loves this country, its history and the patriotic citizens.
With  “Delay the election” tweet, is there anyone else but me beginning to think Trump could possibly not win a single Electoral College vote and  will win all 50 States &amp; 1/2 dozen territories!  Fewer people each minute wil not be #DyingForTrump.
The sad part is they had him sign a liability waiver. He had to know at that point what he was getting into or maybe not,  maybe just being the sacrificial lamb for trump?
Says the person who’s been protecting trump.
McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff Trump suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election - The Washington Post
I’m going to the booth and vote.  Trump is a snake.
Just because 1/3 of the country is enthusiastic doesn’t mean trump will win, pretty simple to understand lol
Aaaaaaand there it is, folks. He is threatening our democracy. If Trump could have his way, we would never be allowed to vote again.  Get registered. Vote.
Remember, Trump has repeatedly stated that he never jokes, and that everything he says is the literal truth
How can u be so stupid to still believe Trump called the virus and not the democrats and media response to it avhoax
Well, after 8 years of Barack "more flexibility" Obama bending over and taking it from Putin, Trump decided to face him.
Brilliant move by Trump though. We know mail in voting will have issues, if Trump wins, and Dems cry foul, he says I told you so. If he loses, it will be a stain on Biden's election as we continue to find uncounted ballots through 2022.
Trump suggests delaying November election  As usual, the press, this time the BLACK press has lived p to its reputation as FAKE NEWS, and they only do it because they know their constituents are too intellectually lazy to check the facts for themselves
If mail-in ballots are good enough for Trump’s base, they’re good enough for ALL voters.
If the wicked is Trump i support you
Remember during one of the investigative hearings for the impeachment of  Trump’s Chief of Staff  had a cow about the insinuation he was racist and offered his long relationship with  Is Meadows at the funeral or did Trump stop him.
Trump tried to keep Covid out and you leftists played the race card ad nauseam to keep him from doing anything regardless. STFU!
For God’s sake, Biden &amp; Bolshevik Bernie are on VIDEO admitting they wouldn’t have done anything to stop Covid regardless and we wouldn’t have even known about it. Only reason we even know of it and doing anything is because “Trump is POTUS and we must play games regardless.”
Especially when Democrats tried to prevent Trump from doing anything about Covid, using the tired “racism” card even.
Of course. We wouldn't expect any less from this loser, his Administration &amp; his followers who I refuse 2 give up on although it seems more apparent every day that if you still support  then you must be Evil yourself.  #RESISTANCE WILL WIN
Darlin, NOBODY makes  face look more orange. He takes care of that himself in the tanning bed he installed in the White House.   Trump won’t sunbathe like normal people because he’s afraid of being mistaken for a beached whale.
Pretty much. Much of it being thinly veiled “he should’ve worn a mask! Trump killed him!” smugness.
“Oh but Herman Cain didn’t wear a mask hurt durr!” And? You leftists kept playing the racism card to spite Trump anyway regardless of what he did to try and prevent Covid in the first place. Don’t pretend you ever cared about  in the first place.
That would guarantee a Trump re-election.
It’s one thing to not like Trump or any politician and yet be fair in your criticism. It’s another thing to continually err &amp; then blame the opposition when you’re the one at fault. Again, see Democrats using the race card to stop Trump from preventing Covid entry into the US.
I guarantee one thing Trump talked to Putin about was fleeing to Russia as an exile before or right after the election on the Trump Organization plane full of traitors like #BenedictBarr,  Pence and the rest of Trump’s Cabinet.
In 1 video  said “to be defined by your enemies is to be nothing at all.” Which is exactly what the Left is. No matter what Trump does no matter how reasonable they blame him because they STILL can’t take the L. And they continue to show it with  passing
Donald Trump is terrified because he knows his presidency is crumbling before his eyes and his attempts to use attacks by his #GestapoGoons is backfiring.
"Cain had attended Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis."
Could Trump have handled Covid better? Sure. But stop pretending he’s the only one at fault when Commie China fanned it out in the first place. Not to mention the Democrats fought against him using the tired “racism” card when he wanted to temporarily shut off flights.
All these things can be true at the same time: - Trump is morally unfit for office. - Biden is morally unfit for office. - Trump has helped millions of Americans. - Trump has ignored the plight of millions of human beings. - The only good thing about Biden is that he isn't Trump.
I am so sick of Trump's  attack ads on Biden. Biden doesnt attack Trump. Hes an honest person and I hope he will be our next President!
Running on his record is automatic defeat. Bye bye Trump
re herman cain's death  the trump people - including his son - keep attacking biden for not having traditional campaign events.   joe biden's campaign events never killed anyone. trump's rally did.

Trump 2020 #BackTheBlueKeepOurChildrenSafe
But the worst part of the tweet isn't that it didn't age well, it's that making an allegation without proof is irresponsible.  As if Trump never does that.
And to think that the coronavirus may end up going down in American history as only the second most monumental event of 2020.   I know Trump doesn't technically have the power to do this, but do any of us think this is going to end well?
sorry but empty platitudes of what trump can't do while *nobody* in power does *anything* to rein him in does not mollify me

I am a proud, life time Democrat now ex voting for TRUMP again!!!
Trump’s completely oblivious to that.
Trump’s demon sperm created his demon seed.
Who has been pushing the violence? The Democrats, ever since Trump won the election, you are are just pawns for the DNC, they don't care about y'all, only your votes. Remember Maxine Waters saying if you see Republicans eating dinner at a restaurant call them out? You ARE hate.
I saw so much donald trump in his promo. Good cus I mean you know heels draw heat i guess lol
Trump is unable to be a president.  Congress needs to step in.
It is so disgusting to watch an AG that has no respect for the law or anyone except Trump.  I hope they can be held accountable but it won’t be until they leave office. Just counting the days.
Trump gets confused and thinks it’s Melania saying “no erection for you.”
I apologize I thought you asked me to read the AFFH legislation which I know inside and out because it affected my industry.  It's not a bad thing that Trump is doing. It's actually helping to keep another housing crash from happening.  He's way ahead of all of us..noone gets it
Trump votes by mail using an address that he doesn’t reside in... you can just request a vote by mail balllet in FL.. this is a dumb hill to die on for Republicans considering everyone in the White House does it now..
And what does that have to do with the price of real estate? Nothing...God said to be charitable and kind..he also said to be aware of the serpents in the temple...and he has warriors...the Dems have made a temple unto themselves ...Trump is tearing it down for us.
Go Trump

Yes because it’s happening while trump is president...makes total sense
Hasn’t he pretty publicly stated he’s a one term president? The only reason he’s running now is because Trump is in office.
Trump investment of some type otherwise he wouldn’t be pushing it. You and he should be ashamed of themselves and you should be ashamed of yourself giving out bogus health information it’s very dangerous and a cost lives!
No he won’t ever. He will put Donald J trump first every time!
"The very rude Dorothy and her NASTY red shoes are very unfair to Mr Trump! Flying monkeys MUST ATTACK NOW."
So Trump is to blame for his handling of a situation nobody has ever faced while following “expert” advice and facing name calling about his proper actions up until March? Run out of wars to cheer on?
Their's literal video evidence of this. Watch Trump's 4th of July from Mount Rushmore or his rally compared to any virtual interview or staged speech Joe has done the last 5 months. Joe won't even take any unapproved questions. Open your eyes.
What, not enough money because Trump has been siphoning off cash to himself and his cronies?
Still keeping with your discriminitory housing record from the 70's eh Mr. President. At least you haven't surprised me yet.
Biden calls the demon seed woman a "disgrace" and calls out Trump for pushing her nonsense.
if they open up Biden will have to debate Trump live on stage. This lockdown is of course going thru the election.
He LITERALLY cannot do an interview or press conference without pre written questions and notes for his answers. Trump can stand in front of a crowd and speak for 2 hours, joe can't do 5 minutes.
Wow. For those of you that support Trump, please explain to me how this is not 100% racist.
And yet you are complicit in all of this madness. Seth MacFarlane continues to make oodles of money for and with Fox, which helps prop Trump up. How is MacFarlane any different from Zuckerberg?

Trump is setting up to nullify the November 3 Election. He’s saying it might take months and years before we find out who won. Folks, we need to hit the streets as soon as possible.
Watching his propaganda news briefing, Trump said that things in Florida is getting better. Yesterday some 264 died and today, we’ll over 250 from COVID-19. How can he lie and the Fox crowd blelieves him. They are complecit in his crimes.

If it wasn’t for Trump’s Tulsa rally he would still be alive.
“Major COVID flare ups in many of the countries that the Media was touting as doing so well. Some of these countries are now a disaster. Donald Trump doesn’t want you to know this. Also, highly inaccurate numbers being reported by many other countries!!! WTF
He was dancing loud &amp; proud at Trump Tulsa rally. Now he dead smh
Negligent genocide. Y’all are just making up terms to blame Trump for the China Virus aren’t you! Turn off CNN and quit trying to invent ways that you think are going to keep Trump from being re-elected. You are gonna be sad come November 4th...
HERMAN WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY IF IT WASN’T FOR TRUMP’S TULSA RALLY! NOW HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A POLITICIAN DEATHS! PLEASE, RETWEET A MILLION TIMES! RIP HERMAN.

From now on,until the end of your life; you will be known as the selfish careless jerk, the sociopath from Rhode Island, a Trump sychophant who forced his staff to be exposed  to a life threatening virus to keep their jobs so you could pretend a pandemic wasn’t happening!
No. They still are at risk that Trump will tweet a mean thing about them.
I had a dream last night.  It was all fear and frustration SORT OF LIKE LIVING IN A PANDEMIC UNDER A TRUMP REGIME. In the dream,  my sister loses my car but steals a van which we then 🤦 decide to drive, only the brakes don’t work!
Cant sue the Trump campaign for it, unless he signed the NDA the Gen Z/KPOP signed online🤣🤣🤣 For rhe supporters who did not attend the rally, please express your generosity to the teenagers for saving your bloody lives from the hoax.
He was the guy using no mask at a Trump rally?
Less one GOP vote for Trump🙏

President Trump’s arrival on the American political scene unmasks, reveals,the loopholes in the American constitution. Am reluctant to  herald that the president is intelligent by covering which his predecessors could not discover; as a matter fact, he’s more audacious than them

Ivanka’s use of the word “look” implies he could actually be competent but gives the appearance of being bad at the job. Sadly, Trump is actually the most incompetent man ever to be in the oval office. He, along with those who help him,  are literally tearing America apart.
Trump: We must open up our economy. Trump: We must open up our schools. Trump: Delay the election until it's safe enough to vote!  Hell No.
Even if Donald Trump tries to stop the Presidential Election, states would still be able to hold their primary elections. Even if they dont, the states Governor of Cal would be in a place to appoint a interim until the election and Pelosi would likely remain as interim
Trump snd the GOP Senstors are the only Frauds
Lies as usual... Trump, Wrong Wsy Ronna Mc Daniels and thrir death cult are pathetic pathological lists ans need to stop tweeting and see a shrink
Money wasted because he’s not worth a penny all trump does is blah blah lie lie me blah blah lie me
Trump is a dictator.
Trump knows he will lose bigly. Trump is a desperate moron.
President Trump is maddening with the idea of postponing the election date; although it sounds foolish, it is also a way trampling the character, the innate respect, of the American people.
Donald Trump : Considers delaying the presidential election due to #COVID19  Donald Trump : Cancels the Republican National Convention due to concerns around #COVID19   Also Donald Trump : Schools should open for in class learning #COVID19 is overblown  Which is it you #COVIDIOT
The sole person responsible for the 150K love ones we loss to the Trump Virus. He hasnt a thing to help to control the spread of the pandemic.
Get ready, because you FIREED! Trump won't commit to accepting result if he loses election
Trump will without a doubt incite violence from his supporters if the elections happen and he loses...
The only thing that's pathetic, that it's Thursday the 30th and BLM and Antifa are still terrorists violent and garbage organizations. Do not represent blacks, and have not made black lives better.  Because of You idiots, Trump will be elected, thanks! #Trump2020

President Trump now suggests delaying the November election.
Racist tweet. It's now the Trump virus
I saw this coming months ago. trump wants the election postponed. He failed us on covid to fear monger voting.  We won't allow it, he has no right to do it. Over glass, dead bodies and in a hurricane I will vote!
It is this kind of petty stupidity that makes you so-called journalists one of the lowest IQ and hateful people in this country right now. Enemy of the people... and why Trump will win
Trump virus there I fixed it 150000 dead  at some point the potus needs to take responsibility. Ps in nyc it got here from Europe
Totally agree. Children need to go to school and exercise their brains, their social skills, etc. Dems want the Country go into deeper havoc no matter what the casualties are, for as long as it hurts Trump. Never seen so much evil in one National Political Party.
Over my dead body!  Can Trump cancel the November election?
If the doctor's magic prescription actually worked, wouldn't the rest of the world be using it already? If it's a hoax, why do we need her "cure?" But really, why is trump pushing this drug so much? Someone must have stock in it.
Bean, that's what you have for brains!!!! Weet tbe DEMONCRAPS DESTROY AMERICA. SO NOW WE SND TRUMP ARE SAVING IT. VOTE RED OR AMERICA 🇺🇸 WILL BE DEAD!!!!!
Trump is not well, check out his right hand shaking as he enters the helicopter.
Reverse psychology? tRump always does the exact opposite of any advice given to him. Of course that gives Joe too much credit for any kind of strategy.
Some day entire books will be written on just how much money Trump stood to make on hydroxychloroquine
Dude, just ”man up”to your opportunism, but you gotta admit, your boy Trump is racially ill... You are even parrotting false generalities fousted upon you by those that hate you...
Trump, Republicans &amp; Democrats, the destruction didn't happen with Trump's election. Both parties are complicit.
Opportunism, righteous indignation are key traits for hardcore Trumpers, Black or White.... Intelligence is not. See TX Republicans like Gohmert... Being paid to support someone isn't new. Trump paid actors to hang by the escalator when he began his illustrious career in 2015...

Trump is the logical conclusion for the GOP. Comic-strip caricature of what they have become. Overblown in ego, greed and avarice. He complements it with hate and stupidity as well.

Trump doesn't  care that people who have little left, and soon nothing, like me, are left hanging. He doesn't realize that he just handed me a whole lot of time to get as many voters registered and voting blue as possible. I hope others do the same.
The new FBI building is to block a hotel being built down the street from Trump Tower. It has nothing to do with need. It is only to protect Trump Tower, you know the hotel that doesn't change sheets between guests. And has a trump book in every room no bible

The truth is that many of the questions were out of his prevue as AG and he should have answered as such. They were asked to show how far off the range he has gone. The fact that he even tried to answer shows that he thinks he has no boundaries and will protect tRump at all costs
Trump couldn’t be more ridiculous if he tried. Putting this insane so called doctor out front to reinforce his pathetic conspiracy theories, shows how desperate and mentally unstable he really is.

Heels up Harris. Fraud liar and cheat. Vote for Trump and Straight Republican in 2020.
What happened to Herman Cain was predicted.  Trump knew it would happen to a percentage of attendees.  That’s why he made them sign a liability waiver.  He was ok with it as long as he got to have his rally.  I can’t understand why both sides aren’t outraged.
Imbecil, that's why Trump did prison reform, because police, including elite FBI, bully people into taking a plea. They do it to minorities too often or any one who is their enemy. These agencies have too much power.
Sounds like Trump is trying to cheat by electronic voting and vote by mail blocks that.
It’s fairly clear that he chose to vilify the science behind mask use to please Trump. He put his faith in a charlatan rather than the true experts. That loyalty ultimately cost him his life.
Trump led Herman Cain to the gates of Hell.

Kick them out the league? Are they free or free* ? Charlamagne tha god can use your help to interview sleepy job Biden? Can you assist him/us with this?
Calls for immediate impeachment!  Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Yes Herman Cain passed from Covid likely picking it up at a trump rally.  How many others have passed on who don’t have the name recognition that Cain did from that same rally?  Trump could care less
Dear momma :) . Want to hear some bars from Kanye? How about a 30 min interview with by charlamagne tha god?
Hey Robbie. Have you read Mary Trump’s book?  Lots and lots of early tells.
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
That reasoning never crossed Trump’s mind.
Judge blocks Trump's public charge rule on immigration
There was a time when I thought it couldn't get worse than Dubya, but in the face of what we're going through he's looking mighty fine these days.    This is what real leadership looks like, and Trump having no presidential qualities is another reason #WhyIDontLikeTrump
trump is the only person I hate
A virus he caught at a rally in Tulsa that Trump insisted on having despite the recommendations of experts.  Clearly, #TrumpVirus and #TulsaRallyVirus are both more appropriate.
This is what they do, and why Trump is now the face of the party.  Experience doesn't matter, only confidence.

Why is the liberal media not giving black communities access to their elected officials?   Or  sign petition to help America ?
Trump knows he’s going to lose that’s why he wants to delay the election 🗳 and why he’s bashing mail in voting 🗳.
Trump again throwing meat to the media about this "delay the election" talk..what he tryna distract us from?
The Donald Trump Presidency.
Juan Williams saying Trump is a sore loser is amazing considering he’s 1-0 in elections so literally he has never lost.
Yesterday trump was trying to scare people from black and brown people who could possibly move into their neighborhoods and lower their house prices, today he wanted to postpone the election and this is your message?
Greatings brothers, would it be too much to ask for a min of you time or a reshare ?
In totally agree. Would it be too much to ask a ally for a minute to assist our a black radio show host?
What more does McConnell want out of trump, he could make trump resign tomorrow and run with pence and haley, but this is the party of trump...they are all trump now.
I hear ya.  Hobby Lobby, Chick-fil-A, and Trump rallies too.
THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT DROPPED 32.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER. tRump doesn't want you to know this. That's why he floated the idea of delaying the election. DISTRACTION!! Whatever you do, DO NOT RETWEET THIS!
Busy watch PRESIDENT OBAMA. NO TIME 4 Trump’s BS. #TrumpIsALoser
I would rather Barney run the country at this point trump needs to go 💯💯💯💯💯
Lewis showed nothing but contempt for President Trump, why should he bother?
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today’s eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Obama’s eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
Judging by my Twitter timeline, I think I may be the only one who is quite pleased that Trump didn’t go to John Lewis’ funeral.
And Trump has the audacity to offer condolences to Mr. Cain's grieving family without taking responsibility for hosting a senseless rally during a global pandemic.
And nobody knew it until “Professor” Trump told us.
And trump doesn't care because he has no soul!
Chip in ANY AMOUNT to attend the virtual grassroots fundraiser with  and  on Friday and let’s sweep Donald Trump into the dustbin of history.
Are you also wondering how many regular, ordinary, non-public figures also died as a result of the ill-advised Trump Tulsa rally that killed Herman Cain?  There are certainly others.
Trump is a sad little man. Probably upset because absolutely no one wanted him there today. #PettyAsFuck
I highly doubt that! This right here is what the Democratic Party has become. Vote them all out!  🇱🇷TRUMP 2020🇱🇷
Vet your Candidates America.  Infiltration is happening in BOTH parties.   Vote for Darlene Swaffar, Republican Candidate for Congress FL 22 Pro Trump Pro Law and Order  Pro Constitution NON Establishment Let's DITCH DEUTCH and DRAIN THE SWAMP!
bush's global kill count is many times higher than trump's. if you have this view you care more about trump not asking nicely than what he's actually doing
Trump has mishandled crises, 150,000 of our fellow Americans are dead, we continue to grapple with systematic racism &amp; we have a careless BIGOT who could not care less if things got worse because he’s making them worse. Let us listen to Obama and VOTE!!!! VOTE EVERY ENABLER OUT!
Given the way he's running his campaign, you have to wonder:  What does the President have on Donald J. Trump?
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it
What I would expect on  tonight. Top story will be a live report from the NY pizza restaurant that trump tweeted out. In the 57th minute, there will be a snippet of video of Obama, Bush and Clinton speaking at John Lewis service
Even if delayed, Trump still leaves office at noon on January 20th, 2021. Absolutely nothing changes that.
Trump could never give a speech/eulogy because he can't talk about anyone but himself.  I love and miss Obama so much!!
No one there wanted trump to say a damn thing.
Donald Trump will NEVER upstage President Barack Hussein Obama!

Children want the normal they were promised. It isn’t happening because of the ineptitude of the Trump Admin &amp; the entire US government as a whole.  Even if we make it through this global  pandemic, we‘re traumatizing young people, ruining their present &amp; destroying their future.
There seems to be an emerging trend at the funerals of American heroes - Barack Obama delivers a stirring eulogy and Donald Trump isn’t welcome to attend.
The press Corp is paid to be there. Just add the context. trump is doing this to take attention away from John Lewis's funeral.   trump is acting like a toddler who wants attention. He will babble like a toddler.
Trump lies. People voted by mail during the Civil War and WWII.

Trump's decision to pull troops from Germany will weaken the US and boost Russia, says Merkel ally. Why does Trump always end up doing what the Russians want?
You do understand the actions that certain Governors took, caused a number of preventable deaths. Trump is not the only one to blame and it’s pathetic.
None of this would be an issue if Trump hadn’t championed it… None of this is medical , it’s all political…

Is Trump using Covid as a cover to kill Black ppl? It’s odd that the Turning Point Israeli-first died of Covid just the other day too. Who’s next to die of Covid? Paul Ryan?
The fact that Trump is trying to delay the election which he can't do shows how horrified he is that he's going to lose. We have him scared. Now let's do the one thing that he and his republican billionaire goons can't stop. VOTE. VOTE. VOTE.

We could all die and trump would not give a flying fuck. If you truly think he cares about you at all, you’re buying a narrative that expired decades ago
Trump attended a fundraiser in Texas without a mask on the day the US hit 150,000 coronavirus deaths. In addition to all his bad qualities, he's a hypocrite too.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
I agree with the statement however, Trump encourages his "followers" to endanger themselves and in doing so all of us.

Today many Republican congressmen will be asked about Trump's tweet and they will all have mysteriously not seen it.
Trump sent out the tweet just as the historically low GDP numbers crossed the wires. His failure to manage the health of the country has caused massive failure in the economy. And now he has nothing to run on other than spreading division and fear if the "others".
YEP, THERE IS 5,000 REASON NOT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP...ONE IS HIS IQ IS 40, HE DOES NOT READ, TAKES NO BRIEFING, CALLS PEOPLE UGLY DISGUSTING NAMES LIKE A 5-YEAR-OLD BULLY, HAS NO SENSE OF DIRECTION, AND HE LOVES DICTATORS. THES ARE JUST A FEW...THE LIS GOES ON AND ON.
Trump tweeted the election stuff right as the GDP calculation comes out because he’s the worst president ever and still doesn’t have an actual plan to fix this country he’s just preserving his own wealth and power.
Then why is Trump doing nothing to show proof and make it available?
I'm pretty much resigned to the idea that we won't make any meaningful headway until after the inauguration.  Assuming Trump loses and we have some form of blue wave.

Trump doesn't play three-dimensional chess. Don't ascribe such credit to him. He tips over the Checker board when he finally realizes he's losing.
“I  didn’t  realize  that  was  something  one  could  do”)  Trump  never  realized  one  can  think of  others...The  plan  was  to  get  out  of  debt  to  Russian  Oligarchs  through  raping  the  United States.
The  “make America...” slogan  was  only  a  slogan, a  dog  whistle.    Trump  is  a  narcisisst.   He  has  never  even  realized  a  person  can  give  a  thought  for  anyone  else  (Like  King  George  in  Hamilton  referring to  Washington  giving  up  power...

Oh my goodness, Donald Trump says that NJ has only one person under the age of 18 that dief. Doesn't he realize that children have died across the USA also under the age of 18?  I think we've had even children under the age of five who died.  This man makes me ill.
How could it have been stopped Donald Trump regarding the loss of jobs?   You are the only one with the power to take control and protect the people by closing down everything to get the virus under control and YOU DID NOTHING!
Donald Trump we know what to do with regards to protecting the elderly. This is not new information. We need new information, we need to protect children that you want to go back to school. Stop saying the but same the bullshit every fucking day.
Trump has to stop going back to millions of lives saved, that was March, we're in fucking August. FFS

This just in, Herman Cain says he no longer will vote for Trump.
Trump has lost a Federalist Society founder by tweeting about moving the election date. After tolerating caging children and pissing on the U.S. Constitution and rule of law it’s funny to see what it takes for Trump to finally grab a hypocrite by the pussy.  They know he’s toast.
PLEASE  don't ruin this HISTORIC day with the THREE President's eulogy to #JohnLewis by airing Donald Trump's BULLSHIT today.    Let us keep all the wonderful words spoken about John Lewis in our heart, mind and soul and not let it be tainted by Trump's lies. Thank you.
I never imagined there would be a president who would screw up more than Dubya.... And then there was trump
Tje econemy worst in the countries history , virus out of control , Trump making noises about cancelling the election ,unemployment out of sight , democracy failing and perhaps Trumps golf outings being threatened , we are a that point of no return .
I think Ma -a Largo should be designated a virus detention center as they used an island to seperates the plague carriers from the rest .Have Trump  cater to them for their needs ( continue to shuck a mask ).
Donald Trump is responsible for every single person that died in the USA because of #COVID19 (except the first 15 people).    There may have been many Trump supporters that died and at some point Donald Trump needs to FUCKING wake up.
Trump is not capable of having friends. He alone, along with Herman Cain's lack of critical thinking, bear the responsibility of his passing. Removing the safe distance signs, no masks all contributed to this outcome. Very sad.

Saw LAB CORP on TV today with President Trump &amp; doctors with report on their test results for COVID 19 &amp; how great their turnaround time of test results were now at 2-3 days! Complete lie!! Here in Florida the average time frame is 7-10 days!😢
With the outrageous proposals Trump is touting to deny the vote , I think he is daring ppl to drag him off his perch .This happens when you place ppl between a rock and a hard place.
If Trump called back some of the exorbitant tax breaks he gifted the rich with , we could continue the unemployment payout of ,$ 6oo that gives a sort of a surviving sum . I advise all to read Mary Trumps depiction of Trump that she wittnessed in the Trump household .
With all the suggestions for treating the virus, given by Dr. Trump  , I expect the next fix will be blood letting as in ancient times .Dont laugh . I'll  bet there are some that will try it .
Tim, c'mon. Think about it.  Moving the election is a great idea.  All #MAGA Patriots! The election will now be held on December 1st!  I repeat, all Trump supporting true Americans, don't forget to go vote on DECEMBER 1st.  Not Nov 3rd. Don't vote then.  DECEMBER 1st.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Trump works every day to form a more perfect disunion.
1 order away from it. Trump is testing the waters in cities he does not like with the homeland security forces he has sent. I'm sure he is checking to see how obedient they are So far they are totally controlled on his leash. We are looking at tough times ahead if we want freedom
I don't know every detail about the tragedy. I do know not to follow people blindly &amp; not to drink everyone's KoolAid. Trump Supporters are so lost because they are so tied into the propaganda coming out of Fox! It is very sad to see so many ignorant lost people in this country!

iRep. John Lewis called for the impeachment of Pres Trump in a dramatic speech on the floor of the House of Representatives, giving voice to a growing list of House Democrats calling for an inquiry into the president’s interactions with a foreign leader.  Wrong side of history
How dare you!  Our election is NOT in your hands or under your authority to change or delay. Stand down, Mr. Trump. Your term is almost up.
More proof, as if it was needed, that Trump is an anti-American autocrat that does not believe in freedom, justice, democracy, and especially the Constitution.
You should delete it. Retweeting something like this is equivalent to trump retweeting the hydromoronqueen dr who also thinks alien ejaculate causes demons or wtf ever.

Donald Trump could NEVER stand up in a church, among the family and friends and talk ONLY about John Lewis.    He doesn't know how to do that at all.
Do you remember yesterday?  Lmao. Trump the idiot had a "team" the last election for voter fraud. Evidence: ZERO. source you ask? No problem. 😉
It's what Mitch McConnell will do that will be a huge problem.  What Trump does, kits of it can be reversed.  Remember when Trump reversed all of Obama's stuff? Joe plans to change it back.
I'll be voting by mail, as I have in Florida since I became eligible to vote.  But make no mistake...if that was not an option, I would belly crawl through a field of broken glass and salt to cast a vote against Trump in November.
People are risking their lives for Trump and money they don't need. Insane
They're blaming it on Trump.
Herman Cain was killed by Trump's negligence holding the Tulsa rally. Trump led those poor souls to their death! How many more people have died or will die because of Trumps Negligence? Shame on all involved with Trump!
Donald J Trump actions in Tulsa is no different than the actions of mass muderer Jim Jones! Trump packed people into convention hall knowing he was going to kill some of them!
Herman Cains death is on Donald J Trump! There are videos of your employees removing dont sit here stickers so you could pack people in! Your a murderer
Trump cancelling the fair housing program that Obama initiated was a  act to put down a court decision against Fred Trump ( his father ) who tried to block the poor and black trying to get a step up in housing capabilities .In essence catering to the white affluent population.
And your thoughts of Trump and Putin?

This tweet has to be the result of Donald Trump taking #hydroxycholoroquine   This man's brain is fucking fried.  Absentee voting and fucking mail-in voting is the same fucking thing FOR FUCK SAKE!  He wants to stop the election until safe but let's send our children to school.
After this whole discussion, what is your interest in this topic? You seem very invested in complaining about all the Trump policies and his ineffectiveness as president. These are all opinion on your part and yet you haven't shown me verifiable proof of any of it.

I am voting for trump
Trump rescinded Obama's fair housing rule.Trying to keep the suburbs for the upper class .Blacks are targeted with this bias  happening .What he's  doing is loading up on the white votes paying attention to disparity in  population percentages, black verses whites .
Note how well these states have done in the last few years under President Trump.
isnt it telling that when Obama was president and he delt with the party of " No" as per orders from Rush Limbaugh,.that he never used executive orders as Trump so freely uses  ? Imagine the s..t storm if he had, from the right  ?
The policies Trump has pushed has created an economic boom, until covid came around. More money flowing and more people working. Is that a bad thing? Or is it better for people to rely on govt, and not themselves. Teach a man to fish and he'll have a way to eat. no?
The fastest responding President ever works harder than all other low life POLITICANS. JFK had to play games with our National Sex symbol. Obama screwed his own people. Trump made America great until Mike Bloomberg paid Wuhan Lab workers to concoct Coronavirus and release it.
President Trump is dealing with Covid-19 virus, the terrorist riots in RAT run Cities, a nasty, dirty D'RAT campaign  plus his own, China, Russia, etc...  All of these demands plus more at once without any Help from the D'RATs!! The unjustified  Attacks are getting worst!!

I trust the Patriots in this Country to Vote for Trump, however, I do NOT trust the 👹👹👹RATs!!
Trump runs the government and dozens of his people were indicted and found guilty. Yet under Trump government  no Obama people have been found guilty not even Hillary. So I assume your news sources are full of shit.
I have seen this for along time. It has just gotten unbearable as we get closer to the election!! Vote for a Trump and a straight GOP Ballot!! The RATs have sold their souls to the 👹!! MAGA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I believe that we occupied Germany to keep Russia out.  Besides, if we did have to fight Russians, I'm sure everyone would rather have a war in Europe, as opposed to a war in this country  I understand Trump's position, but leaving Europe to its own devices isn't safe.
Hummm, one on one picture taking today, in Texas with Donald Trump.  This should be interesting.

Lets use our energy to vote Trump out of office and that will remove Barr from office as well.  The senate will never convict Barr.
Is there any country we used to be on good terms with that trump has not betrayed?
Good thing Obama's not in charge. He waited 6 months to react to his H1N1 pandemic - I guess he was too busy being told to take over of our healthcare system.  Trump reacted on day one.
Wait, so you think people who live in suburbs are white and all poor people are black? And you think TRUMP is the racist?

Well it is becoming clear that Trump's covid-19 press conferences are some of the best advertising Biden can get!  The more Trump talks the more people want to vote for Biden! #DumpTrump
How Trump's coronavirus briefings convinced one of his voters to turn to Joe Biden
What has this countries standards been lowered to ? Trump received intel of bountys being paid by Putin to kill American troops . This alone should cause doubt about Trumps  qualification to lead .
It looks like Trump is handing Putin another gift pulling the troops out of Germany! Is it November 3 yet?
Likeing, as I do, Kamala Harris , Biden should measure baggage pointed out in her rise to her station . Biden is moving against the tide as it is . Trump will throw everything at him whether true or not .Play safe , Joe . Think about Duckworth for instance .
This has nothing to do with Trump. I read a French report and shared it with my very sick friend. It is a true story. It is my story and it is not political. You are just so negative.
Another good Trump decision for the American people however Anything good he does is never reported by network news

That is Trumps dream, Trump would love to move USA  to a single party system and have Republicans control the government.
The plan is every one of us get off of our lazy asses and overwhelm Washington D.C.with a sea of masked faces,Show Trump that if WE wanted to,no barrier would keep us from him.

News flash,statement uttered by Donald Trump is found to be TRUE!
President Trump has a lot of great points that he just doesn’t use.  The biggest tax break to a family is the Child Deduction.  Ask families with children if they want to lose that.Trump and Barr have NO power to delay the election. It’s just a distraction from his disastrous pandemic response and the worst economic downturn in US recorded history.
That’s because the left has no morals. Of course they used his funeral as a political platform. Look who’s their candidate! Sleepy dementia Joe. He’ll NEVER debate President Trump. He doesn’t have the balls.
Why? He knew the facts yet ignored them. He was a cancer survivor so he knew he was compromised. His support of Trump was more important than his or his family's health...
If it is postponed, there will be an immediate cure for COVID-19! The msm will start focusing on the delayed elections and attack Trump.
So if Trump has been doing this since his first day in office.. why is ot still one of the largest problems we still have in America? Shouldnt it be solved or at least gotten better by now? ARE you suggesting #TrumpIsWeak
Fuck that  Medicare For All Cancel Student Debt Abolish Private Prisons Green New Deal Net Neutrality  Tuition Free College Housing For All Legalize Weed  You Republicans that paved the road for Trump to enter power do not get to dictate when or how we fight for our policies

So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
Something is missing in Trump. Something essential to being human. Bush made some very bad decisions and listened to some people he shouldn't have. He is a much better ex president then he was a president.
For real? I didn’t know that... wow. Rudy... you should be ashatof yourself. Like trump loves to say “that is nasty”. Lmao. 🤮

Don’t you think he was tested before he was allowed so close to Trump? Herman Cain is tragedy but it’s about individual choices.
Does Trump even realize that older people get their insulin and other very important medications via the USPS. They have done this month after month and their lives depend on it.
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.
Of course he is. Trump is going to undermine the results and declare himself the winner. Welcome to authoritarian rule! Democracy and the USA is finished.
This is why Donald Trump is president. Racists like this.
Well at least it’ll backfire on trump. His approval was low during the government shutdown.
Absolutely correct, Governor DeSantis sits at the knee of Trump, both must be voted out

Trump’s comments on rescheduling the elections convinces me further that he won’t accept the election results if he loses.
Our idiot Governor DeathSantis is listening to his master Trump. He's a darn mini Trump. He's going to get voted out.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.

Too late, he sat by and did nothing while Trump betrayed his oath, our country and allies.
Remember over the spring many “primaries” got delayed/changed to accomodate the shut down. State govs may be inclined to change election dates/mail by dates in an effort to “accomodate” (ie: round up) voters.   Trump knows whatever he proposes Dems will be against. HydroxyC, etc.
That didn't age well.. I don't want to speak ill will of the dead but he was a grown man that chose to ride or die with this hoax and paid for it. he literally died for Trump.

I don’t think there’s any evidence to support your claim that Trump wants to place black people below white people. There have been no actions or statements that support that. I was trying to go straight for WHY you would perceive things that way.
You don't check your sources. Here’s the full statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association and AASA, the School Superintendents Association.
Don't believe this guy; he's as anti trump as they come. "Science" is trash when the analysis is designed to come out a certain way.  #hydroxichloroquine

Trump said that he could shoot somebody and they'd still support him. Well he didn't need a gun in this case.
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump

Trump is setting up to nullify the November 3 Election. He’s saying it might take months and years before we find out who won. Folks, we need to hit the streets as soon as possible.
When does Trump keep asking where are the ballots they're mailing gonna go...to the voters duh..he's an idiot
Trump does not deny that he wants to delay the election in November.
Trump bought the Miss America contest for access to young girls. And he’s clearly out of his mind.  And you’re a hypocrite and a fool.
I said memorializing not memorizing. But the whatabout trump supporters don’t read
#TheFive Good idea President Trump, if school stays closed, send parents the money so they can send their kids, to an open school!
Didn't work. Obama is going to be on the news more than trump. Also, Bush and Clinton.
Psst.....Trump wanted to leave Syria
Watching his propaganda news briefing, Trump said that things in Florida is getting better. Yesterday some 264 died and today, we’ll over 250 from COVID-19. How can he lie and the Fox crowd blelieves him. They are complecit in his crimes.
Trump is high and clueless as to what McConnell has not done. He sat on this bill since MAY
#TheFive Yes President Trump,  we need kids back in school!!!
...and plus Dems bill sat on McConnell's desk since MAY! Trump is high!
Trump tone has definitely changed with these press conference..he finally gets the economy wont get better if the virus stay around
I thought usually it took grabbing them by the .........to get him off.  #tRump
What’s up with Trump’s face?  Did he forget to put on his makeup?
Let him try. Maybe It’ll keep him busy while the clock keeps ticking. Plus it’ll keep him distracted from future Trump distractions. And they’re coming.
It's the trump virus
Trump looks terrible. His skin texture. (Never mind the spray tan.)
LIVE: President Donald Trump is holding a COVID-19 briefing at the White House.
November 3rd is going to be epic!  🇱🇷TRUMP 2020🇱🇷
I’m doing mail in voting. So suck it Trump
Pompeo Says Barr Will Determine if Trump Can Delay Election
Trump knows he’s going to lose that’s why he wants to delay the election 🗳 and why he’s bashing mail in voting 🗳.
Trump again throwing meat to the media about this "delay the election" talk..what he tryna distract us from?
Donald Trump demonstrates zero leadership. Please do something about Russia placing a bounty on US soldiers. #PenceLies
You obviously haven’t seen how trump deals with this kind of thing. He will not acknowledge his death. If he does, he will blame it on protesters in ATL..
Trump’s ridiculous phone call with a Republican senator was recorded — and given to The New York Times – Raw Story
Rep. John Lewis was a great American and a great man. I don't see you mourning him. Herman Cain supported Donald Trump and look where it got him. Dead.
Mitch McConnell slaps down Donald Trump's demand to move the election over claims of 'mail-in fraud' as Republican leaders line up against call  via
Those comments are inappropriate &amp; totally unnecessary at this time. Whatever your opinions about Trump or political disagreements with him were, this is NOT the time to talk about him repenting before his tragic passing. God bless the Cain family, friends, etc...
Trump, mcconnell and barr should be tried for treason as soon as possible.

If I have to crawl through broken glass that is on fire to vote Donald J Trump out of office ,I will do just that ..
Trump Takes A Victory Lap Over Alarm Sparked By His Push To Postpone Election Day
Looks like Trump thinks all voters in Florida and Michigan and other states are all Democrats. He appears to be shooting himself in the foot. Republicans vote by mail too...right.
I do like Republicans at least most of them but... wow Trump supporters are literally a bunch of cult members who can't think for themselves. Pure sheep. This isn't even a D vs R thing it's literally common sense vs ignorance.
that's the trump youth troops following hitler
Do you think they purposefully ignore actual degenerates so they can claim Trump’s base are horrible people overall and people will believe it?
We are in the field of math, science, and observations. The Ohio board did the right thing. Plus, not 1 anti trump/pro dr.fauci person has given a drug regimen that has been proven effective.

Trump may not drink alcohol, but he's sipping at that #DemonSemen
Juan Williams saying Trump is a sore loser is amazing considering he’s 1-0 in elections so literally he has never lost.
You must have the worst fucking logic ever... shame on those blaming Trump's TULSA rally? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 You must be missing a lot of facts and pictures because Herman Cain should have not went to that rally. But he believed Trump's words and died from stupidity. Plain and simple.
have to second this...  i probably see 20 or 25 trump stickers/yard signs/etc for every biden one... but i hardly see any biden ones, if that makes sense...
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via  #Trump #vote #Election2020 #VoteTrumpOut
Yesterday trump was trying to scare people from black and brown people who could possibly move into their neighborhoods and lower their house prices, today he wanted to postpone the election and this is your message?
I rarely, if ever, swear in public, Twitter or Facebook. But I find myself swearing at the TV when GOP goons like Gym Jordan, Doug Collins, Mnuchin, Nunes, and, of course, their Idiot-in-Chief Trump open their mouths. No one else makes my blood boil as much as they do. 😖 😡
#NobodyLikesMe WHY is Media continuing to air the gaslighting - I have been off all day your boycott is going to start       and remember all figures are lies- bff trump owns that company 😷😰😡‼️
#TheFive President Trump is the Master Troller!
Sorry, that makes no sense whatsoever. People die in pandemics, and b I'm sorry fur your loss. However, while Obama acted decisively to fight against H1N1, Trump has done the exact opposite. He has countered and maligned the very people he should have been listening to along.
One of my followers made a good point.  Trump was impeached, doesn’t that make it illegal to be re-elected?  Even if only the House impeached him it still stands. HE SHOULD NOT BE ON THE BALLO

Mad King Trump has finally latched onto an issue that his #MAGA base is sure to rally around: No election.
Why would Project Veritas put out a video critical of Trump?
Trump is such a child. President Bush gave a eulogy at John Lewis‘s funeral even though John Lewis didn’t go to Bush’s inauguration because of the Al Gore/BUSCH recount election. Trump didn’t even pay respects to Lewis when he was lying in state in the Capitol. Not presidential.
What more does McConnell want out of trump, he could make trump resign tomorrow and run with pence and haley, but this is the party of trump...they are all trump now.
#BidenPredictedTrumpDelayElection. Trump demands election be delayed.
4 years ago :
Well almost 4 years in , we know Donald J Trump is not an elected official ! he was placed in office by the Russians. #DonaldTrumpIsIllegitimate
Bottom line: the N.R.A. laundered Russian money into the 2016 campaign and illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign. The N.R.A. needs to have its tax-exempt status stripped. Our documentary details all of this. But we need help to get the doc out.
Trump doesn’t care if more of his voters vote by mail. Trump doesn’t care if vote by mail is popular. The best opportunity Republicans have to suppress the vote is by reducing the number of urban voting sites where voters can vote. That’s the plan!
First of all, Pomeo’s smirk aside, he’s clearly not in in “the joke”, secondly, didn’t Trump tell us recently he “doesn’t kid”?
Analysis | Trump’s Four-Pinocchio interview on Russian bounties By Salvador Rizzo
THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT DROPPED 32.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER. tRump doesn't want you to know this. That's why he floated the idea of delaying the election. DISTRACTION!! Whatever you do, DO NOT RETWEET THIS!
Trump may not be eloquent by anyone’s standards, but he is a prodigious liar.
Busy watch PRESIDENT OBAMA. NO TIME 4 Trump’s BS. #TrumpIsALoser
We didn’t deserve this type of health, economic, and political climate that Trump carelessly and recklessly led us to. If he is smart he’ll step down. I hear Roger Stone has room for another tattoo on his back.  Trump can end up as a tattoo on Stones back, if not it’ll be worse!
You honestly believe there is no possibility of voter fraud with millions of ballots floating around?   What if GOP wins, are you still going to take that position?  Is this exactly why Trump is making these statements? To take away Left arguments of “fraud” once he wins?  🤭🤔🧐
Trump should say that breathing air is good so the dems stop
Charlie, all Trump does is lie, and self-aggrandize, and talk like the fascist he is.
I have sleep issues, but they're more likely caused by my spending too much time on Twitter rather than worrying about the pandemic! 😳 🙄 And my addiction to Twitter is totally the result of following the resistance to Trump's disastrous administration. 😡
, my pleasure. President Trump must be reelected!
All of those points he Trump wants to but the Dems won’t let him
Lewis showed nothing but contempt for President Trump, why should he bother?
So, so sad. Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma where social distancing signs were removed by Trump campaign staffers and masks were not required. I hope you’re proud of yourself, Mr. President. Cain’s death was a result of YOUR negligence.
Republicans against Trump
Republican Voters against Trump. I believe she’s in Ohio.
History will remember Donald Trump in one way and one way only: as an accessory to the murder of tens of thousands of Americans. And amazing legacy
I don't think so loll trump is done
I would call it more of a Nazi rally. You were still able to work with Nazi's even if you're on the wrong side. A lot of Trump's tactics are Nazi-like especially the past 2-3 months. Klan is just more of entitled and very narrow-minded White people.. not a real movement.
Thanks! I must assume, then, that you recognized the character played by Robert Duvall in that pic and the implied connection to my joke about Eric Trump, n'est ce pas? Hope you chuckled to yourself! 😎
I sense desperation in the air....your years as an enabler to Donald Trump are costing you.
Yes. And that is why so many deaths are on Trump. If he had modeled and emphasized mask wearing and discouraged the push to reopen so fast fewer people would have died.
Imagine if the Republicans did that for the first two years of Trump, Now maybe you might want to reconsider that change? Harry Reed did it for all judges other than Supreme Court. Republicans than included the Supreme Court. How did that work out for you?
Very apparent, Trump will never be called eulogize anyone....besides, will they let him out of prison to do it.
I mean he died from the virus... who cares if it's from the rally or not... honestly it's his fault as much as its Trump's fault.. you have to be a fucking idiot to go to a rally where you know most aren't smart enough to wear masks.
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today’s eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Your right it’s just disappointing to have Trump as our President
Trump's little crony. Did nothing to help him.
Obama’s eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
Thank you! He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally. He said (in caps): "people are fed up". He was a selfish pig. I save my sadness 4 the innocent pple who died because of them. The chickens have come home to roost! Ana is not rude just factual!
. is a partisan hack. And a Trump-sucking sycophant. And an asshole.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
Thanks to Trump and his corrupt leadership for our country going through this terrible epidemic Virus! All Trump cares about is his real estate and his selfish needs to be against the Medical professionals that we have to unite as a country to get this Virus out! Trump👎🤥
Call me crazy, but i think this is Trump coded speak for "dont worry i will keep POC out of your neighborhood."
That would be a lie. Trump IS a full blown racist.
Why not flip flop it would extend your demise. If you support trump you’re a racist.
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
Trump killed him... just like thousands of others... just for a fucking campaign rally LOL...
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
Or goes to jail... Cain was a big boy. He, along w/ Trump &amp; the rest of the goons, have caused many innocent people to die. He praised Trump 4 not making masks mandatory for the July 4th rally &amp; said that "people are fed up" (in caps). They deleted it today.
“Trump Moves To Delay The Presidential Election Until He’s Not Losing” by Eric J Scholl
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
He needs flippers &amp; a Speedo!
Completely agree. But theres that filibuster rule, etc, plus each member of the senate would have to give a little speach abt why Trump is evil, etc.   Maybe they could do it faster. Obvi, it would be priority #1. Trump would be on lockdown!!  Lol
Have they heard Herman Cain just died because of trump virus??
Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
“My Statement on Donald Trump’s Shameless Repeal of DACA” by Joe Biden
yo Brent I found your girl.
I just asked was he a hateful person, I looked up the word in the dictionary first but I wondered why John Lewis was viewed as hateful. So I asked about Trump to see how someone could say John was hateful but Trump wasn't. Its not that complicated.
We must stop trump and his enablers.  Their incompetence has set our country back decades!
Very disappointing to have Trump I hope he is finally getting out and we can get our Country back to the people first!
DeSatan hitched his future to the wrong wagon.  He, the Tea Party faction of the GOP, and Trump are finished. Their ineptitude to govern, their refusal to listen to scientific experts have relegat3dmthem to history’s garbage heap.
“All the Corrupt Things the Trump Administration Did This Week” by Max Ufberg
Just got to wondering. Were there “White Voices for Trump”, or does Trump automatically speak for them? Also did any previous Presidents have Black/Latino Voices for them?
Never
Biden will almost certainly win Maine by double digits. U think there will be a lot of Collins/Biden voters? I’m more skeptical considering how much Collins is tied to trump.
“Day 1,287: Trump continues to act in the best interest of Vladimir Putin” by TrumpTimer
WOW! what a service #JohnLewisMemorial . What I am curious to know is why Trump was not at the services? As a leader of this country he should have been there.
. we're coming for you. Each and every one of you. We will crawl over broken glass to vote. We will wear hazmat suits to vote. We will stand in line for 9 hours to vote. On Nov 3, we will annihilate the Trump Republican Party. We're taking back our country. GTF out of our way
Diane: Don't blame innocent 2020. It was as shocked as we are. You can blame it on Trump. Why not? He did everything else wrong, why not this? Although todays earthquake didn't do any damage and turn to shit as everything else he touches!
Trump’s becoming a pariah. The way his kind should be treated....instead of allowed to be President.
No joke, Trump is getting off on this - the moment he realized he could tweet praise for a different black guy who just died on the same day he planned on blowing off respect for John Lewis, I’m sure a big smug grin crossed his face and he dove for his phone.

RIP to #HermanCain who died from COVID after attending a Trump rally without a mask. Not intending this as a “gotcha” at all, but a plea to anti-maskers to maybe reconsider the whole mask thing.
See Trump is corrupt and hateful going against our Constitution! Protesters have legal rights they were not doing anything wrong but protesting against something the Trump Dictator didn’t agree with equal rights BLM👎🤥
I was just seeing if the person saying one person is hateful was also capable of determining if Trump was also hateful. Its called being bias, not being able to be impartial. How does me asking a question implies hatred? Even if I was fishing for a impartial opinion?
Clown 🤡 😂😂😂Trump Drive nuts 😂😂😂😂😂
trump has no friends only uses people, name one true friend he has?
And Trump has the audacity to offer condolences to Mr. Cain's grieving family without taking responsibility for hosting a senseless rally during a global pandemic.
is he saluting Hitler or Trump
Hey Palmer, maybe you could help me with this question... at the end of August 2016 Hillary was leading Trump in almost every major poll and we all know what happened at the end... how can we be sure that’s not going to happen again?
Makes you wonder what President Trump is actually up to doesn’t it? I trust
And nobody knew it until “Professor” Trump told us.
And trump doesn't care because he has no soul!
Parents aren’t going to send their children to slaughter for you and who you pray to (Trump). You decided to listen to the lies about the virus 🦠 from Trump and his enablers. You reap what you sow. You are following the Herman Cain path.
And yet the Trump Death Cult refuses to face the implications of his death squarely and instead are doubling down on their idiotic Covid mythology and butthurt about libs being means to them.
He’s a fraud plain and simple.....Can’t believe Trump keeps him
How the hell does Trump keep this fraud?..very discouraging
Trump and GOP running up $3.7 trillion deficit this year.
TRUMP HAS NO AUTHORITY TO MOVE THE DATE OF THE ELECTION. HIS GORDY DECORATIONS AND HIS BELONGINGS WILL BE OUT OF THE PEOPLES HOUSE BY 11:30 ON JANUARY 20TH. I HEARD PUTIN ORDERED A PLANE TO PICK HIS UGLY SHIT UP. HE CAN DECORATE THE KREMLIN WITH HIS UGLY BULLSHIT FUCK HIM &amp; PUTIN
Today Trump suggested delaying the election. Obama was reinforcing John Lewis' belief "When you see something that is not right, you must do something," "Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part."
And Trump voters are conservative, so what does that make him? Your claim was specious and an attempt to discredit the original point, which is that by and large Republicans and far right groups are the biggest pushers re: reopening/masks are ineffective/covid conspiracies.
I highly doubt that! This right here is what the Democratic Party has become. Vote them all out!  🇱🇷TRUMP 2020🇱🇷
Them they criticize Trump at Rose Garden
Q: Did Herman Cain tweet that masks would not be required at Trump's controversial Tulsa rally? And was that tweet subsequently deleted?  A: Yes.
Trump is more afraid of early voting 🗳 then the actually Election Day🤔 but want worried about it in 2016 🤷🏾‍♀️
The more people who get sick, the more of an excuse Trump and Barr will have to try and postpone or suspend the election. Remember, has no bottom and will do anything to win. Cynical? Perhaps...

As a Trump supporter how can you defend making voting harder.  You can want your guy to win, but ar what cost?!  What country do you live in if it totally ignores the value of voting?!
What bothrs me is this, like everythig else Trump does, lying, cheatg, ppl he appointd all do whatevr he says evn if it sounds like it shd be against the law.  I don't undrstand how he can get away with all this garbage, including bringing other countries into our elections
for the love of  can someone tell trump how to pronounce "plasma"  its not plausema
Biden down only 2 in a GOP poll in a district trump win by 17!
so I'm guessing trump wasn't at the funeral.....
Amazing how you and Cain and Trump and conservatives can say whatever they want, no matter how despicable, but God forbid someone criticizes a conservative, she is labeled hateful, no matter how valid the criticism. Look in the mirror.
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally. No mask. No social distancing. Likely contracted COVID because he stupidly follow Donald Trump. #TrumpKilledHermanCain #TrumpKillsUS
Here's when it will really be fun: When an intrepid reporter asks Mad King Trump, "So, what did you think of President Obama's remarks at John Lewis' funeral?"
And MBS as well, but I totally agree about Putin too. Trump is coddling all the foreign dictators &amp; tyrants from North Korea, to   Russia, to Saudi. Time to shut down Rizvi &amp; Milner. Don’t let these foreign tyrants buy up our social media. Down with fascism! #bringbackbetter
Thank you, Obama!! Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, takes aim at Trump over voting rights, protest response
He died from the Trump Virus. You neglected to write that.
Rest in peace Herman Cain. Hopefully others will learn from your misplaces trust in Trump.
Doesn't take nerve,nor are they unaware or unconcerned.....they are the lowest common denominators a.k.a. ignorant racist trump supporters
Here’s Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally. No mask. No social distancing. Very likely contracted COVID by foolishly following you...Blood on your hand!!!
U act like Biden hasn’t said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
C’mon let’s be fair Trump knows 6 words : Person,Woman,Man,Camera,Tv and Bigly. In Trump’s world Bigly counts.
Did anyone put a clock on how long it took Mad King Trump to mention John Lewis after his death?
Is Trump a hateful person?
Donald Trump.
Right, because when Lewis boycotted BOTH Bush's and Trump's inaugurationa he was working to bring people together?
You have to keep in mind that Trump's biggest supporters are Nazis &amp; white supremacists.  These people love his racism.  He's one of them.  Has anyone ever checked his closet for his white hood &amp; robe?
No it’s in the constitution that both houses must approve it first.  The spanish flu was worse more deaths it didn’t get postponed. Trump definitely cannot do it.
BOOM!!!
I actually think the humiliating loss would lead to him not really returning to the job for those two months. His only agenda is “Trump.” He doesn’t care about what Mitch might want.   I think he’ll spend December stuffing money into suitcases and arranging to leave the USA.
To encourage them all to use the free filters provided to all Flint residents? Yeah I remember that. Man, I miss the days when that was the worst thing you could come up with against a president.   My turn:
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now—you won’t get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone’s ideas before we vote.
No, Trump is a national disgrace. Trump has done nothing about Russia placing a bounty on US soldiers.... #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsANationalSecurityThreat
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it
No. It’s really bad. Like Stephanie Meyers wrote 2020. Like trump is the emotional immature Edward and we are all Bella.
What I would expect on  tonight. Top story will be a live report from the NY pizza restaurant that trump tweeted out. In the 57th minute, there will be a snippet of video of Obama, Bush and Clinton speaking at John Lewis service
Under Trump and the GOP the federal deficit is $3.7 trillion. #GOPhypocrites
I believe it is a fact Trump is trying to undermine the election.
What do you call it when Trump suggests delaying the election? Fascism!!!
Obama makes Trump look like a damn fool.
Congress been asking for Trump taxes for 4 years. Nigga just said “nah, y’all can’t see that”. And nothing happened. He gonna do what he want with this election.

No one cares about Mad King Trump and he's going to whine about that all over again the next chance he gets.  The spotlight needs to be on him every minute.
Yea and I’m sure the 8 Trump campaign staffers who contracted COVID shortly after the Tulsa Rally must’ve gotten it from somewhere else too. Regardless I guarantee that he and those around him did not wear masks or take the virus seriously which still makes it ironic and foolish
No one there wanted trump to say a damn thing.
Donald Trump will NEVER upstage President Barack Hussein Obama!
I saw Barack Obama‘s eulogy for John Lewis and felt pride. I listen to President Trump every day and feel shame. What have we become?

Exactly-1.200 doesn't even pay a month of rent in LA,CA and what about DWP-cars-food-etc-life-see them big $$$$$ peeps in DC try to Survive on that-No way No Way--Trump knows-if his wife hadn't married him--she might be one of the ladies in LA, worried on this-he knows the city.
While he's on my TV eulogizing John Lewis, this popped up in my feed.
trump's goal. To beat Stalin's death numbers.Clearly, Trump doesn't understand how the Constitution works but someone around him does - therefore, 8 hours later, he holds a press conference in complete opposition of  his original tweet.  Question is, can he still be impeached given his "retraction?"
ask Trump how it feels to go through life like that

The Federalist Society calling him out is BS. It’s an attempt to save some Congressional seats and repolish the GOP brand in light of Trump’s fading prospects. They had many opportunities to stand up for the country and passed. Not buying it.
What do u think it was in the civil war ww1&amp;2 ? They had elections.. UE just making excuses Bc trump is way behind and u don’t want Biden .  This is going to b a landslide nothing u or trump can do about it !!
Trump virus asshole
Trump finally said something today that I agree with. He said the virus should have been stopped. Absolutely right. It should have been but you were too busy calling it a hoax and saying it would magically go away. Trump is to blame. He had a chance to control it and failed
must be stopped.
Trump and GOP hate science because it effects their bottom line.

Gee I wonder why LOLOL The stable genius is going to win by a landslide!  Poll: Trump voters have higher enthusiasm than Biden supporters
I’m gonna call it 3 months early. Trump loses the election and blames it on the DNC messing with mail-in votes. Then proceeds to go on a rampage with his followers, all while having no evidence.
Does anyone besides me get nauseated, and angry when they see Trump ?
That’s to be expected from a Trump groupie, they’re all the same, #DeathSantis, Marco, Yoohoo, and gaetz.
I don't think the school stuff has anything to do with anything but this: Kids have been home for the summer. If they have to stay home longer, child care must be accounted for. Even under the best scenarios, parents will want to hand Trump his ass in this election. Kids4votes.
If I die here in Florida, the thing I would ask is that everyone remembers Governor DeSantis has followed trump's advice on the pandemic every step of the way.  #DeSantisResign #DeSantisiskillingus #DeSantisFailedFlorida
With the senior population more susceptible to Covid-19, mail-in ballots would actually help Trump. It's not about who's in office. I'm against blanket mailing of ballots to voters whether they requested it or not.
My blood pressure is rising as i listen to Trump say he can postpone the election, not accept the results, and ruin the USPS so we cant vote by mail! Wtf are we going to do?
Just like the NYT’s article about Trump and George Wallace jist happened to be published today when Obama launches the same attack at a funeral service!
I am somewhat the same way.  My issue is with Herman Cain.  Is the world a better place?  Or say it was Trump that died.  Just sayin  If an action saves more lives than it cost.  Or! If it saves the planet?
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via   #ConstitutionorTrump #WeWillVote #AmericaOrTrump
So Biden was correct to predict that the Liar in Chief would bring it up? trump's entire presidency - every lie, every drop of his epic incompetency - is ripe for a 'scathing denunciation.'
Meanwhile asswipe trump wallows in his own feces daily.
I'm gonna agree with Trump about something. Do. Not. Trust. The. #USPS . If you can vote in person, do it!
Thank you Sir. You would gain respect from Democrats like me who have voted for you if you specifically voiced your disagreement with President Trump’s floating the idea of delaying the election. Other Republican LEADERS have done so.
Absolutely 100% agreed here!!!  Former Bush adviser endorses Trump to 'give conservatives a robust majority on the Supreme Court' | Conservative Institute
He’s going to need them Bc post offices will b closed that’s what trump is doing he’s warning the republicans not to mail ballots

Anybody out here feeling comforted that Trump can’t unilaterally delay the election and set the stage for dictatorship without a helping hand from congress wasn’t paying much attention during those impeachment hearings.
Agreed! I’ve been a silent cheerleader for them. I don’t trust that they’re not going to flip the script after Trump is out and start pushing money toward electing Republicans, so I don’t give them money, but I love that their current goal is the same as ours.
Nice Aunt Crabbly.  Wipe away your crocodile tears.  As much as I welcome more Trumpsters and TRUMP going to meet their maker early it is not me.  On the other hand, if we balance the good that would come from Trump's  demise what is the problem?
The thing about fascism is that anybody who knows how to look for it can see it coming a mile away.
I have no doubt Trump would like to delay the election that he's going to lose. I also think he's trying to deflect from the news that he's giving Putin a pass on paying the Taliban to kill U.S. soldiers, and that Trump has horrifically mishandled #COVID19 &amp; our economy.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

We could gain control of the COVID 19 in weeks. Problem is Russia Russia Russia has Trump by his short hairs and Putin wants to see US Economy collapse.  Mark my word!
he had a choice: wear a gd mask and stay away from crowds not wearing them; you know, like at a trump rally.

My understanding is the Trump’s term expires at noon on January 20. Pence’s term also expires. So if we don’t have a presidential election, the speaker of the house (Pelosi) would become president.   This is why I don’t understand Trump’s delaying talk.

Never use the term "very sophisticated way" in a description of Trump, especially when he's idolizing a doctor who claims demon sperm causes medical problems. I'll never get over that this is what we've been reduced to, a POTUS, who is likely totally out of his mind. And corrupt.He is not your president whether like it or not. Donald Trump is. I had to put up with this bozo for eight years, but I always thought of him as our president.
And Trump will step over his body and keep going. He sacrificed his life for naught never to have his name uttered again by the chosen one. Black people are dying 3 times more than whites. How senseless to die being so utterly reckless.
I agree RIP ... 🙏 HERMAN CAIN. strength peace  and prayers to your family.  I also believe POTUS TRUMP should reach out to Dr. BEN CARSON and have him continue the lead of C19 , he's also an excellent investment to our party of good peopole. 🙏♥️🇺🇸

This is what happens when Trump is upstaged by a dead black man, and the black POTUS that is eulogizing him.   Trump to WH staff: "Cancel everything that I wasn't going to attend anyway, so that I might attempt to divert the attention that no one is paying me!"
Its amazing DONALD TRUMP was in fact in his logs but this list you have does not have him on it LOL
You are lying He never said that but he did Mention Trump ...🙄oh and Trump is on Epsteins flight log
this looks worse
Why not ask Trump instead? the actual logs not doctored show he did fly with Epstein :)   FACT check bullshit before making a fool of yourself
People are really this stupid? Tom is not on the logs but umm Trump is :)
Trump is on that list :) not Tom
Donald Trump is not the only one who has to shake hands with dictators. Obama went even further, he sent Iran over 1.7 billion dollars as a gesture of friendship. 😂
Even his own party is against this — Republicans flat-out reject Trump’s suggestion to delay election
And still today Trump doesn’t know that the Mujahadin, have nothing to do with the Taliban!
Cain tested positive for the novel coronavirus earlier this month, 11 days after attending President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He tweeted a photo of himself at the rally in which neither he nor those around him wore masks. Trumps hand is in his death.
trump politicized them . You’re afraid to call him out on the issue.
The news from the Texas rally aftermath will be know in two weeks, as the Tulsa one has shown! Trump is condemning his followers to an “uncertain” future!
Trump turns on Fox News. Turns off John Lewis funeral coverage and sets up his hair-coloring appointment.  Time on his hands.   Trump will clean up the suburbs, because in his demented mind he did “more for Blacks then MLK, John Lewis, or Obama”.  #wakeUpGOP
BULLSHIT. NO MAIL IN BALLOTS VOTE IN PERSON OR ABSENTEE. NO NEED TO DELAY SHIT. OPEN THE POLLS NOV 4. TRUMP 2020
Trump won’t attend final funeral tribute to     silent.  Trump is “cleaning up suburbs”  silent.   dies of Covid19 after joining Trump at a pandemic hotspot. #BlackVoicesforTrump SILENT.  Their silence is Deafening!
Herman Cain joined Trump with no mask to Trump’s Oklahoma rally.   #RIP #HermanCain 999
How do you spell "obstruction"?
I  thought  he put Putin  first. trump  definitely  puts Putins  interest above  American  military  members .  He is  still  okay  with  Putin  paying  terrorists  to  kill  American  military  members .
Not so fast, Donald.
More  trump  lies .  He's  had over  3 1/2 years  and trumps major  accomplishments  are  1) holding  a  lot  of  hate rallies   2) cheating  at golf  costing USA  taxpayers  $150 million  3) being responsible  for  150,000 deaths  and counting  in the USA .
Trump is desperate. He knows he is going to lose the election, so he thinks he can change the November election date. Trump is unhinged!  2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Floats Whether to ‘Delay the Election,’ Something He Cannot Legally Do
What happened Trump? I thought you produced the best economy ever? Too bad it isn't virus proof.
trump  is  responsible  for  the  150,000 deaths  in  the  USA  from  covid19 . warned of  a  pandemic  in 9/19 trump  failed to  notify  the  public . When  he finally  took action  in 3/20 the  virus had already  spread  over  the  USA .  BIDEN  11/3/20.
I  realize  that  the  nuclear  option  should  be  the last  one used, but Germany  should  prepare  for  a  Putin  / Russia  invasion  or provocation . All of  the  NATO  Nations should  ban trump  from  entering  their Countries .
Donald Trump signs executive order targeting social media companies
Trump no where to be found.
Cut to Trump’s Texas MEET, GREET, AND SPREAD COVID.  must be pulling his toupee off in rage.
You can spread Covid19 with Trump for $10 Billion in economic losses! #WOOHOO
Did you not hear your boy McConnell say he purposely block everything Obama tried to pass as much as possible. Trump picked kavanaugh because they blocked Obama from doing so. Stating let the next president do it. Get your stuff together. Stop the foolishness
Fauci has to illustrate using his hands to get thru to Trump. 🙃
trump is a racist.  What I  don't understand is that the racists are going to vote for him no matter what he does, why is he still pushing his racist agenda?
I wish God would stop talking to all of the insane people. trump has faith in this doctor.  Anyone still believe that trump is not insane.
Mr.President, the only thing these ANARCHISTS &amp; LOOTERS understand is a strong hand ! " IN TRUMP WE TRUST! GOD BLESS AMERICA ! We are ready to fight for our FREEDOM !
23 DAYS IN A ROW. But Trump...
Trump says U.S. is sending Texas 500 cases of remdesivir as coronavirus deaths hit record
trump wanted to know when they could meet because he hasn’t kissed Putins ass in a long time.
trump is a traitor.
And the best way to do that is to reduce unemployment payments from $600 to $200. That way people don’t have enough money for rent so they forget how hungry they are. trump is an idiot.
So I'm driving in Bridgeton, NJ (Salem County) for a work assignment... and I see these two flags flying on this home's lawn.  I get close enough to snap a picture.  An American/Confederate flag &amp; a Red TRUMP flag.  In NEW JERSEY.  YES... I know it's Salem county... but DAMN!
5 weeks is a long time - like 1 less GA Trump voter long time.
Trump thinks the bulk of his followers are billionaires. They’re are in for a surprise, he doesn’t want them near his neighborhood!
Of course you haven't spoken to him. That would be disrespectful to Daddy Putin.
. Thought you night like confirmation on the “Nobody likes me” whine. See what happens when you kill 150,000+ people?
I appreciate you being the toughest questioner in the WH Press corps, but this opening sentence plays right into the narrative that it’s the Dems fault. The failure lies with Trump &amp; Mnuchin’s inability to negotiate a package that provides actual assistance to those who need it.
trump is their boss. He’s incompetent.
trump is okay with Putin paying terrorists to kill American military personnel. He is a traitor.
trump is a traitor and Putins puppet.
$5 says he loses in a landslide. Too many voters now see that everything he does is driven by outdated views on what made America so great.  Trump divides people, lies and exacerbates problems. He is not working to solve anything.
If there was any doubt that trump is insane, that doubt has now been removed.
Business decisions are made in the interest of the owners of the business. trump jr. Is a RWNJ tweeting lies so his account is temporarily suspended. The right decision.
Trump family investment in the production.
'Nobody likes me': Trump ponders pandemic popularity of Fauci and Birx - (Barr likes him 😁)
Oxford U, funded by Gates were set to study hydroxy in Europe.  Study was HALTED as Covid19 patients administered this malaria drug immediately developed heart arrhythmias.  Top research docs vs Trump voodoo.  Go with Oxford! Also, if it worked, guess what? EVERYONE WOULD USE IT!
is flat nailing Trump to a wall right now. Making Mario proud. You watching this  ?
Trump is an embarrassment. “Nobody Likes Me”. 🤪
Do elephants also vote in the elections? Trump has no chance!
98 days till Trump is gone 98 days from now, you go to bed and when you rise 97 days till Trump is gone.  97 days till Trump is gone 97 days from tomorrow, you go to bed and when you rise 96 days till Trump is gone!
Trump says he still thinks hydroxychloroquine works in treating early stage coronavirus
But not corrupt like the trump crime family.
you are going to help Trump get re elected, the massive failure to keep peace in protest is on YOU. YOU are to blame for the GIFT you are giving the radical right.
Another one of Trump’s authoritarian believers! We should pack all them up and send them off to Russia, Turkey or Saudi Arabia where their views of democracy aligns to his believes.Another white men not understanding the struggles of black, brown &amp; yellow fellow Americans.
When Barr complained about Trump’s tweets was it because of gossip from his staff?
Full offense, if you’re a trump supporter I find you to be less intelligent because... how?
Trump INTERFERES IN EVERYTHING. Barr is 🤥
Trump at 2016 rally: help me Putin!
You can listen to this guy or listen to other guy (Trump). It's your choice, your life.
You're never fooled anyone with your so called change regarding the pandemic. Nice try, but we see through your lies, tweets, and your very person.
Twitter Removes Video by Frontline Doctor on Success of HCQ on COVID Patients After Trump Retweets Her... Think About That - Twitter Is Removing Info That Saves Lives!  via
After Nov. 3rd please take sad hurt pix of all Trump clan members on their way out of town.
The answer is always yes to the question “Did Trump lie?” The subject is immaterial.
Trump is the Typhoid Mary of Covid. Herman Cain attended Oklahoma Trump shindig and has been hospitalized with Covid19 ever since.  Trump never mentions Cain. Trump can’t even wish him well.
Tell me when we have effective vaccines AFTER Biden is in office, and how many obstructionist GOP members are ousted along with Trump. Then I’ll give you my answer.
Trump’s strategy is to gin up fear. He does this by tearing America apart. Putin could not have pick a better foil.
Trump wins every time his supporters infiltrate peaceful protests to destroy property.  State law enforcement and   simply need to ID persons attending protests NOT to actually support BLM, but send message across nation the #BLM is a danger.  ID and report it out.
It won’t work and if trump wasn’t desperate and an idiot he would know that.
What’s Trump doing? Watch as he tries to win re-election on the backs of his base: the low informed
There’s money in it for Trump... he’s been at it for a while... didn’t like the new site...
FB needs to stop this --
We’re so lucky, Trump won’t be attending! True to character, racist to the core.
Our Tweet masters are second to none judging by how Trump enjoys their work!

Perfect description of trump and his sycophants.

Ivanka has been temporarily sidelined due time bible mishap. Get Melania out in a super tight outfit and spike heels 👠 in the ROSE GARDEN!  The WH Press Corps will eat it up! Have her plant the TRUMP ROSE 🥀 we can sell on line with MAGA hats!
Children are now dying from versus. Trump cancels convention in Florida but says schools should reopen. His priorities are backward as usual. To reelect him would mean our priorities are backward.
Yo, “our people” are dying! You’ll lose election! It’s NOT just killing blacks and 80 year olds! 😣  Trump’s politics are killing AMERICA.   All issues are viewed as Right vs Left and Black vs White. MSM reports 24/7 on extremes while  98% occupy a middle ground.
trump is lazy ignorant and incompetent. He should RESIGN.
trump hates the USA.
republicans hate the USA. That’s why the Senate republicans didn’t convict Putins puppet trump. trump continues on his mission to destroy the USA.
republicans call telling the truth about trump an attack.
trump is controlled by Putin. trump is a traitor. trump is okay with Putin paying terrorists to kill American military personnel. Vote for JOE BIDEN 11/3/20.
Hahahaha.                                                  Translation: trump will be cheating at golf that day.
b) Seeking immigration amnesty is not a crime, but having committed a crime exempts a person from getting it. c)The Obama administration, not the Trump administration, built the cages that hold many immigrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border.
I rather have Donald Trump as our president than having Andrew "The Killer" Cuomo as governor and Bill "Lenin" de Blasio as Mayor.
By the way, the NYY invited president Donald Trump to throw the first pitch in August, which prompted Mayor Bozo to write, "After CONDEMNING racism, the next step isn’t inviting it to your pitcher’s mound."
Trump is toast. Biden enters office with pedal to the metal. Keep your sell orders to a minimum.
Go Trump 2020!!!!
PATRIOTS !  NO LONGER BIDEN ! WE NEED TO STOP SAYING DEMOCRATIC EXTERMIST !  THIS IS A COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT THIS IS A TAKEOVER OF OUR COUNTRY !  THE ELECTION WILL NOT HAPPEN !  We have already heard MSM SAY TRUMP WILL BE REMOVED  COMMUNIST DO NOT GO ! MUST BE REMOVED!
This is Trump’s America. Not who we are. #Biden2020
Since no fans will be there to stroke his ego, he’s not interested. Glad he won’t stink up Yankee Stadium.

More trump lies. Pathological doesn’t begin to describe his sickness,
If republicans weren’t racist we wouldn’t have to talk about them. However trump, the white supremacist in Chief, is their leader.
trump never made up a lie he didn’t like. He uses this same lie everyday.
.That will hit them in the pocket. They sure can’t raise any money off of trump’s name and legacy.
trump is already compromised and this RWNJ wants trump to be owned by more people. SMH.
Until Trump, yes.
Wait.. wait.. hold on I can’t stop laughing. You think President a Trump is going to lose all 50 states....😂😅
Trump’s number 1 mission since he was 10
Please, wise ones, tell us all that must be done--in all fields...law enforcement, IT, Congress, media focus on new P and VP rather than Trump's shenanigans (our customary entertainment).
Rick nails it. The washing off the stain of staunch Trump support from Senate cloakrooms and congressional clubs has already begun. #passtheSoap #noWorking #FindANewJob #BeBest
He made no progress on what he campaigned on.   NO infrastructure investment, revitalized NO inner cities,  helped NO “forgotten men” but white nationalists.  All he DID was stir up a race war. Them vs us.   Obama, as the foreigner.  Ivanka, the princess.  Trump conned America.
trump has declared war on America. He is sending his gedtspo to selected cities to sow violence and chaos. trumps idea of America is what was 1930’s Germany. We must vote for Joe Biden on 11/3/20 to stop this fascist madman.
Few in the media were as negative about Trump as I was, or as pessimistic about the future, in Jan 2017 but even I didn’t predict 5 straight days of 1,000 people dead a day, &amp; the president playing golf on that 5th day while smiling for a photo from the course. Truly astonishing.

Well folks it’s July and for the past month the RNC and the trump campaign has been burning dollars on negative ads in Florida against Joe Biden . I smell fear, or maybe trumps diaper. The gop is supposed to have Fla. locked up.
Your loyalty should be to the citizens of Florida. Not yo your "daddy" who helped get you elected.
En Trump,..
The way Trump virus expands.
You enabled Trump to destroy us, its unforgivable
I try to give my honest reaction and I comparmentalize my feelings and reactions based on topics and subject matters, with that said, Donald Trump has friends and is human, as a civilian before he became President, sometimes we have to bow out of scrutiny when it is appropriate.
I believe that the closer that they come to indict the people in Obama's little group that committed treason against Trump the more virus and the more riots we'll have to cover up the shit.
Next to the definition of pathological liar is a picture of Donald Trump.
Doing Laundry in Virginia us working folks need clean clothes 😉 Trump 2020 keep on Trucking
Well Trump's supporters have jobs and contribute to society Biden supporters like to feel his leg hairs don't mind being sniffed and are all sitting back waiting on a stimulus check President Trump is giving them NOT Joe Biden, I suppose that makes his supporters stupid to 🙄

The sleepwalkers, maybe. Not the rest of the country. Everyone impacted is wide awake and watching politicians posture while Trump crashes their careers in to a brick wall.  #historic

AMERICA’S WAR VETERENS ARE OUT IN FORCE —&gt; PROTECTING AMERICA AGAINST TRUMP 😳 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
America is the antithesis of everything Trump and his clan promote.  The million lies The false superiority The racist dog whistling The be best bullying Cosmetic piety  Gold leaf/designer 👜 wannaB celebrity  The jig’s up. The fraud exposed. American exceptionalism is moving on.
Picking up a fight with Trump about the Chinese Virus? What can be more ridiculous?
This would require a NATIONAL call to service. Federal funding and workers retrofitting existing schools where feasible or setting up class rooms on open space lands.  TRUMP is doing none of this! He is busy inventing one-off jobs to nowhere for his daughter.
So will mine! Trump 2020
I'm no fan of Republicans, but I admire the grit of Liz Cheney. She has the balls to speak out while the others show no courage to speak against Trump. I predict she will change her party affiliation and become a Democrat.
Families are fighting over politics. Thanks to the divisive rhetoric spewed by a master of illusion. Donald J Trump
Celebrating Trump’s win
Let's face it. Trump is an idiot.
Just a little memory check, didn’t Bernie Bro’s promise to create chaos if he wasn’t elected to run against President Trump ?
The states that Trump encouraged to open are the states that opened too early. I blame Trump as well as the governor s.
I think he is underestimating the hate for Trump around country. The only way Trump can win is to steal the election.
But you still support the racist fascist trump. SMH.
"Acknowledge your faults and learn to improve upon them." you should give that advice to Trump

Wonderful! A poke in the eye of Donald Trump!
Why have the Indian leaders taken to copying the orange buffoon’s (DT)antics? I saw some one paunchy leader from Bengal doing a photo-op of hitting a golf ball, now someone emulating Trump’s Goya act. Shameful idiots.
Treats from Trump are the worst. Stay safe Tony.Why is it that I keep meeting African Americans that I have never met before, that have no conservative connection to me or anyone I know that love Trump? Hmmm
Its Angela Merkel that's giving Russia billions of dollars in gas and oil sales, while Trump tells her shes an idiot for doing so. Trump has given Ukraine lethal weapons to kill Russians. Trump is currently moving US Troops from Germany to the Poland/Ukraine border against Russia
Trump is the virus! 🦠
Trump murdered Hermain Cain for a rally. 150,000+ more were killed for less. Trump will let more than 1/4 of a million die before the end of August unless something radically changes.

When a toddler done get his way.  They will say anything until they get there way.  We should  all vote by mail.  It's safe and easier for everyone.   I forgot Russia and hack into mail in voting.  Wondering if thats why Trump want to stop it.
If Trump had mandated masks at his Tulsa rally, Herman Cain would still be alive.
If you’ve had enough of Donald Trump’s chaos and corruption, here’s one way you can help end it.  Chip in ANY AMOUNT to attend the virtual grassroots fundraiser with  and  tomorrow and let’s sweep Donald Trump into the dustbin of history.
So self respecting woman votes for Trump.  Every mom I know is sick and tired of the dangerous and divisive DJT bullshit train and will be voting straight blue this year.    ...and I'll be looking forward to seeing #denialdonald removed forcefully on  inauguration day.
Heels up Harris. Fraud liar and cheat. Vote for Trump and Straight Republican in 2020.
What happened to Herman Cain was predicted.  Trump knew it would happen to a percentage of attendees.  That’s why he made them sign a liability waiver.  He was ok with it as long as he got to have his rally.  I can’t understand why both sides aren’t outraged.
Imbecil, that's why Trump did prison reform, because police, including elite FBI, bully people into taking a plea. They do it to minorities too often or any one who is their enemy. These agencies have too much power.
Sounds like Trump is trying to cheat by electronic voting and vote by mail blocks that.
It’s fairly clear that he chose to vilify the science behind mask use to please Trump. He put his faith in a charlatan rather than the true experts. That loyalty ultimately cost him his life.
Trump led Herman Cain to the gates of Hell.

That reasoning never crossed Trump’s mind.

trump is the only person I hate
A virus he caught at a rally in Tulsa that Trump insisted on having despite the recommendations of experts.  Clearly, #TrumpVirus and #TulsaRallyVirus are both more appropriate.

Trump knows he’s going to lose that’s why he wants to delay the election 🗳 and why he’s bashing mail in voting 🗳.
Trump again throwing meat to the media about this "delay the election" talk..what he tryna distract us from?
The Donald Trump Presidency.
Juan Williams saying Trump is a sore loser is amazing considering he’s 1-0 in elections so literally he has never lost.
Yesterday trump was trying to scare people from black and brown people who could possibly move into their neighborhoods and lower their house prices, today he wanted to postpone the election and this is your message?
Greatings brothers, would it be too much to ask for a min of you time or a reshare ?
In totally agree. Would it be too much to ask a ally for a minute to assist our a black radio show host?
What more does McConnell want out of trump, he could make trump resign tomorrow and run with pence and haley, but this is the party of trump...they are all trump now.
I hear ya.  Hobby Lobby, Chick-fil-A, and Trump rallies too.
THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT DROPPED 32.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER. tRump doesn't want you to know this. That's why he floated the idea of delaying the election. DISTRACTION!! Whatever you do, DO NOT RETWEET THIS!
Busy watch PRESIDENT OBAMA. NO TIME 4 Trump’s BS. #TrumpIsALoser
Lewis showed nothing but contempt for President Trump, why should he bother?
Think about this one. I have seen every past president be able to cite Bible verses like Obama did in today’s eulogy. But never once from Trump. What a fraud.
Obama’s eulogy was very inspiring. I miss a President who can deliver an inspirational message that is positive and filled with unity and hope. We lost something precious when we got saddled with Trump.
I want all trump administration gone ASAP and GOP. They are all scum. The ride has been very bad. Killing Americans should have been stopped. We stopped being USA. A lot of people need to lose their jobs in the next administration. FBI and CIA and generals. All at the top.
doesn't care, he's a loyalist.  But he better be careful, those close to Trump are testing positive and now sadly dying. I do not know if DeSantis has any health issues other than being overweight. Maybe his  family can be of influence for his sake if not for ours
Judging by my Twitter timeline, I think I may be the only one who is quite pleased that Trump didn’t go to John Lewis’ funeral.
And Trump has the audacity to offer condolences to Mr. Cain's grieving family without taking responsibility for hosting a senseless rally during a global pandemic.
And nobody knew it until “Professor” Trump told us.
And trump doesn't care because he has no soul!
Chip in ANY AMOUNT to attend the virtual grassroots fundraiser with  and  on Friday and let’s sweep Donald Trump into the dustbin of history.
Are you also wondering how many regular, ordinary, non-public figures also died as a result of the ill-advised Trump Tulsa rally that killed Herman Cain?  There are certainly others.
Trump is a sad little man. Probably upset because absolutely no one wanted him there today. #PettyAsFuck
I highly doubt that! This right here is what the Democratic Party has become. Vote them all out!  🇱🇷TRUMP 2020🇱🇷
Vet your Candidates America.  Infiltration is happening in BOTH parties.   Vote for Darlene Swaffar, Republican Candidate for Congress FL 22 Pro Trump Pro Law and Order  Pro Constitution NON Establishment Let's DITCH DEUTCH and DRAIN THE SWAMP!
bush's global kill count is many times higher than trump's. if you have this view you care more about trump not asking nicely than what he's actually doing
Trump has mishandled crises, 150,000 of our fellow Americans are dead, we continue to grapple with systematic racism &amp; we have a careless BIGOT who could not care less if things got worse because he’s making them worse. Let us listen to Obama and VOTE!!!! VOTE EVERY ENABLER OUT!
Given the way he's running his campaign, you have to wonder:  What does the President have on Donald J. Trump?
Trump and Barr are unconstitutional thugs running Stormtroopers in cities, yet many want a national mask mandate and Federal law enforcement out there arresting people not wearing. Bet if a guy got gassed,  beat and dragged off by cops for no mask they would cheer it
What I would expect on  tonight. Top story will be a live report from the NY pizza restaurant that trump tweeted out. In the 57th minute, there will be a snippet of video of Obama, Bush and Clinton speaking at John Lewis service
Even if delayed, Trump still leaves office at noon on January 20th, 2021. Absolutely nothing changes that.
Trump could never give a speech/eulogy because he can't talk about anyone but himself.  I love and miss Obama so much!!
No one there wanted trump to say a damn thing.
Donald Trump will NEVER upstage President Barack Hussein Obama!

Children want the normal they were promised. It isn’t happening because of the ineptitude of the Trump Admin &amp; the entire US government as a whole.  Even if we make it through this global  pandemic, we‘re traumatizing young people, ruining their present &amp; destroying their future.
There seems to be an emerging trend at the funerals of American heroes - Barack Obama delivers a stirring eulogy and Donald Trump isn’t welcome to attend.
The press Corp is paid to be there. Just add the context. trump is doing this to take attention away from John Lewis's funeral.   trump is acting like a toddler who wants attention. He will babble like a toddler.

Is Trump using Covid as a cover to kill Black ppl? It’s odd that the Turning Point Israeli-first died of Covid just the other day too. Who’s next to die of Covid? Paul Ryan?
The fact that Trump is trying to delay the election which he can't do shows how horrified he is that he's going to lose. We have him scared. Now let's do the one thing that he and his republican billionaire goons can't stop. VOTE. VOTE. VOTE.

We could all die and trump would not give a flying fuck. If you truly think he cares about you at all, you’re buying a narrative that expired decades ago
Trump attended a fundraiser in Texas without a mask on the day the US hit 150,000 coronavirus deaths. In addition to all his bad qualities, he's a hypocrite too.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
I agree with the statement however, Trump encourages his "followers" to endanger themselves and in doing so all of us.

Today many Republican congressmen will be asked about Trump's tweet and they will all have mysteriously not seen it.
Trump sent out the tweet just as the historically low GDP numbers crossed the wires. His failure to manage the health of the country has caused massive failure in the economy. And now he has nothing to run on other than spreading division and fear if the "others".
YEP, THERE IS 5,000 REASON NOT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP...ONE IS HIS IQ IS 40, HE DOES NOT READ, TAKES NO BRIEFING, CALLS PEOPLE UGLY DISGUSTING NAMES LIKE A 5-YEAR-OLD BULLY, HAS NO SENSE OF DIRECTION, AND HE LOVES DICTATORS. THES ARE JUST A FEW...THE LIS GOES ON AND ON.
Trump tweeted the election stuff right as the GDP calculation comes out because he’s the worst president ever and still doesn’t have an actual plan to fix this country he’s just preserving his own wealth and power.
Then why is Trump doing nothing to show proof and make it available?

Agreed. What really creases me is that Trump cares nothing abt Rx prices—he's only doing this as what will assuredly be 1 of many last-ditch efforts 2 buy votes. He's a capitalist pig, as bad as they are+doesn't give a monkey's how much they overcharge. Despicable+transparent.

Due to the Trump’s late, slow, disastrous approach to the coronavirus pandemia, USA is a huge graveyard with more than 150000 deaths and he is still misleading people . Trump’s inflammatory comments aggravated the racial crisis due to police brutality! Trump is unfit! Vote blue!

Obama used the politics that Lewis lived for in his eulogy which is deeply appropriate and seems to be what Lewis would have done. If people see that waving the banner of voting rights as anti-trump… well… I think that might say more about the president than anything else.
I’m not seeing how the politics of openness, inclusivity, and enfranchisement are connected to Trump in any way, save for the fact that Trump is has taken measures against all of those things.
The real death rate is being hidden by the trump White House.

Sigh, a “Trump 2.0” president is gonna beat this guy in 2024
Trump hasn’t been successful in subverting the law. The problem is much of the constitution assumed that those in office would be ethical gentlemen. Trump is neither. Even Rubio said today there will be no postponing the election.

They know nothing will come from their statement.  They are saying that now so that when trump is out they can say "we stated we disagreed with him".  CYA. Thats all it is.
Every internal move Trump is making demonstrates a real decline in popularity. And they know it.

Don’t trust them. Don’t ever. But if they collectively abandon Trump it’s lights out at Trump campaign HQ. Like there’s no money and no point to continue.
Trump talked about the re-infestation in foreign countries vs. how good we are doing in the US. You know the next step is his claims a total lockdown would have been useless.
We all expected Trump to threaten to delay the election, right? This shouldn’t come as a surprise, but it should continue to motivate us to act.
why has Trump not been given a psychological evaluation?
Not only that but all the media outlets inferred he contracted the virus after attending a Trump rally with no evidence.
Trump doesn’t joke, even when he’s making fun of people. Have you ever even seen him laugh?

His "Secret Service" isn't going to get near him with the actual USSS puting up a fight. And Park Police (uniformed USSS agents). And the US Marshals. And DC Police. And that's all before the military get to the scene.  Trump ain't got the stones to put up a fight.

You know Obama is a criminal, and the entire left has been filling people minds with lies about Trump. You're just a sad case of TDS! You also know John Lewis was a racist himself, and he did NOTHING for his city. Period but make himself rich.
To who? Putin isn't that vain. He's not going to keep Trump around as a prize.
Yes i do but I'm just saying, having biden would be the worse choive to have as president. No police, segregation may make a comeback, far more blacks in jail. You can say what you want about trump but before covid or in this the chinese virus, he was doing great

If he did, then why wouldn't he say so? Trump seems to say everything that's on his mind.
Yea i feel you Trump is a racist apologist at best. But he can think all he wants. Our checks and balances are too solid. Cuba was easy pickings with so many living in dier circumstances. I miss BO...I'm getting nostalgic lol
That's it in a nutshell. Putin has no loyalty to him. He drop Trump like an 80# bag of cement. And then call in all of his loans. Mar-A-Lago might be on the market sometime next year.
trump visit KODK fact. KODK secured loan to produce pharmaceuticals(hydroclorowhatever). stock then quadruples. Y’all don’t see these drugs are just money in they pockets.

I caught Obama talking as I walked by the TV today and I wondered what political event he was speaking at. Then I realized it was a funeral. And they say Trump is classless.
Trump will deport them in due time. When you enable Nazis they always wind up turning on you eventually.
No, there’s no praising them. But it might be a signal to all the conservative judges that they aren’t obligated to support Trump.
My man. I'm no Trump supporter. Didn't vote for him and I dont plan to. But you think he is the only one talking about the validity of our democracy? Both sides attack it as it suites them. Remember how Russia got Trump elected? Trump cant be Castro because America can't be Cuba.
And Trump says he's the best president since Lincoln! He's the worst ever!
If you believe in Karma, then Trump is in a lot of trouble.
Yeah but Trump is not popular (due to his own putrid actions) surely that is more meaningful than either of those things
I agree, I do not vote by mail, only in person and for the record, I vote for Donald Trump, that will not change, a letter came to my house to vote by mail without my name on the outside or inside, with envelope  with paid mail and so I sent it
Fuck Covid and fuck Donald Trump.
Obama had people entering illegally in cages. Trump terminated that practice. My family came to the US legally even though it cost my grandfather 3 years working at a labor camp in Cuba basically a slave in order to do so. You just have no idea how bad it is in other places
BASKETBALL IS BACK  Also Donald Trump is a White Supremicist, full stop!
Everytime someone says Trump was joking without fail they are proven wrong within 24 hours.
LMAO "trump next to a black person". OMG.
What reason would u have for voting for Trump unless you are racist?  Voting republican? They are destroying us.
CBC in full deflection spin by painting Trump as a madman and with  Trudeau as an innocent victim...
I can't wait till  holds those who support trump's murderous, corrupt regime accountable.  We can't allow allies oppressive dictators walk free in the US.   for Attorney General!!!!!!  You are killing us!
Pence rear ended? Trump 2020 bus collided with dump truck?   The universe has a wicked sense of humor 😂😂😂
That *does not* mean mass ballots automatically sent to every voter. “Universal” simply means it would be an OPTION for every citizen in every state, with or without needing to list a reason. Trump would still need to differentiate if that is EXPLICITLY what he’s talking about.
I’m not comparing them in how they got into power. I’m comparing them by the way they present themselves. They both have authoritarian thoughts and motives. Hence, Trump’s tweet today:
Go Trump... 🇺🇸
No mask!  Blame Trump
#Civilization5 : I just had what I call a "Trump Moment"... I pressed the "launch" button while looking at a specific place in the map, not realizing the nuke was pointed somewhere else nearby... now I'm in an unintended war with an opponent much better prepared to kick my ass.
I will always hate him for his “it’s time to come together” post Trump win victory speech.   Like, “we’re pay attention. Are you?”
Kids don’t have serious cases look it up, what trump doesn’t want is mail in voting because it’s so easy to cheat that way, someone’s dead cat got a voter registration card in the mail, I dont click on your videos anymore because of how soyboy you’ve become Hila is cool tho
One of these weeks we'll wake up to a Black Mirror reality of Trump fucking a pig on television. Then he'll do something worse by Tuesday.
Guess we’re getting a potential category 1 Hurricane this weekend. So it’s pretty much a Trump. A bit of wind and rain but will do pretty much nothing.
When you're a Republican and have lost the Federalist Society....
Trump can't get it through his thick skull that mail in voting benefits both parties equally. On top of that, don't he realize people in the military also vote by mail.
Trump Meets with Family of Slain Soldier, Offers To Pay for Funeral
3rd party is a win for trump though
Tweet is pointing out his death was needless. Not disrespectful at all.
Trump knew about this for years, he even joked about Epstein's pedophilia. He didn't distance himself from Epstein until the property dispute.
I say we have PRESIDENT TRUMP RALLIES 🇺🇸🇺🇸♥️♥️
Then, all states should have early voting &amp; there shouldn't be voting suppression. In the mist of a global pandemic people shouldn't stand in line hours on end to vote. There's no arguing that President Trump is the President of the USA.

Or that he got Covid at a trump rally
“Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE DEAD UP!”  Fixed your deleted tweet. Bye.
Trump must not let him
FYI- Trump does not remain as POTUS if there isn’t an election in November.
Nah, You’re obviously right about their hatred for Trump, but that has nothing to do with that, at least not the main reason, it’s part of a long process to a New World order, this, per George Soros own words.
President Trump asks recovered COVID-19 patients to donate plasma -
It’s inherently racist because we live in a system that guarantees that IF a memeber of the minority group DOES accend to heights, it’s predicated on that individual demonstratively NOT being an Ally to his/her minority group.
So now we're back for circle and you understand my first take. He doesn't have to do anything at all to appeal to any of us and he can just hide. Like I said he's literally failing upwards just because Trump is so awful not because he's offering us anything to vote *for.*
Now you can't even trust the post office To deliver your mail in vote damn Republicans you are really on a roll. Remember to put your names in the history book all you scumbags who  keep supporting trump agenda. Republicans who has broken the laws of the land and covering up for
Trump’s pronouncements today about delaying elections and beehives of terrorists are only trying to grab headlines away from 150k dead from Covid, GDP contracting in Q2 at highest rate ever, and 17 million Americans out of work.
I believe it's too replace funding that went to his wall. And he wants the FBI building to stay where it is so no one builds a hotel there (across from Trump Plaza).
Trying to defend the inept DemocRATS who would not allow  the AG to answer the question?  They were there to grandstand and carry the Anti-Trump banner.
Have you tried the Demon Sperm?
Sounds like a bit ch ass KAREN to me. trump is a bit ch ass KAREN.
Trump thought he'd leave the blue states to screw themselves, as if he weren't the entire country's President!! He's violated his oath to this country. #resigninshame
Thank u 4 doing the rounds on Spanish press, I'm seeing and hearing nicaraguens and venezuelans falling 4 the same BS a lot of the older cuban generation fell for with Trump and you being a reputable republican calling it as it is really is necessary. 2 much  stake!
Oh, so you’re the Trump whisperer?  ok lol
That not new! But today his true colors came out 4all to see. His presidency was d groundwork for much of what’s happening today. He thought it would continue when HRC became President never expected Trump to win but certainly took measures just in case. Disgrace is too nice
Donald is never realizing how desperate and weak his tweets are making him look. 👀
Jealous.   Obama’s eulogy of Lewis went like this  He marched  Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump  He marched some more  Trump Trump Trump Trump
As Trump floats delaying election, DeSantis and Florida voting officials say there’s no need
And yet....Trump raw dogs porn stars and WW Evangelicals love him and wax poetic about his mIl order bride Melanie. Even Newt G.'s Calista did not face this level of vitriol.  It's something about HRC.  Oh yeah, she's actually intelligent and can form a coherent sentence.
I said on policy. Remember he's a status quo, corporatist, neoliberal, right-of-center politician that refuses to offer even one major concession on policy for the left who is offering old Obama era policies. You know, the neolib trash that got us a Trump in the 1st place.
Trump supporters probably mad everyone kneeled 🤣 Dont watch 🤷🏽‍♂️#NBAisBack #NBA
We have to fight against left with all our votes for Trump. There are a lot of American that think left can not destroy our freedom and system. Then it left wins we have to go to war once more to defend our nation vs "democrats".
What about this tho?
I’m a hate group because I hate you and trump so much
It’s literally our only hope, because unless high ranking generals come out and stand next to biden with a contingent of armed troops at his back, trump ain’t stepping down and he doesn’t care about laws or the constitution or anything else
Gilliam a pop. African American progressive entering his gubernatorial race with DeSantis and the incumbent Nelson couldn’t win in a wave midterm.  Idc what the polls say, Biden has a very steep climb for Florida. I’m a resident here and outside of South FL. It’s Trump country
I was saying this the other day... As soon as I see an American flag I automatically think they’re either racist or Trump supporters.
I love this ... trump hates this
He's wrong. How long have we been having vote by mail...not issues with widespread fraud. Now in 2020 we suddenly found out about election fraud by mail, and Trump discovered it?!! We going with that? Reach much?
You made it sound like my mention of the co-morbidity factor was off-base when it was not.  So i mentioned that. Of course not one factor. I also begged NPR to have a psychiatrist explain Trump's particular sociopathy was more like a 5 yr old's &amp; to respond to the R re hands-up.
This is being the complete lie. 🤫
Love this President Trump! Always working for the American people!
Herman Cain was a great soft spoken on point  gentleman. Never seemed to get upset always defending our Country RIP MR. CAIN THK YOU🙏 On another note ! I'm surprised POTUS TRUMP HAS NOT brought forward DR. BEN CARSON into the C19 picture for a GREAT DR'S ADVICE .. JUST SAYING 🙏
DemoKKKrats are delusional.    NONE has said: “Mr. President this is what we recommend, it will help”   When Trump banned flights from China they called him “xenophobic”.  That in fact saved thousands of not millions.
If you want youth and Black voters to turn out, they have to LOVE the candidate.  No one loves Biden.  Hillary lost in 2016 in part because the Obama coalition on Black voters didn't show up.  Black voters don't hate Trump.  He is more popular now than he was in 2016.
Trump is talking about Americans here. Referring to protesters as a beehive of terrorists to be “cleaned out.” Horrifying fascist language here.
Trump murdered... are u parrot of CNN? Projection was 3.3 mil dead By banning China at 2 deaths, closing USA at 54 deaths, Trillion $economy, he SAVED 3.15 Million ppl Would’ve been more if DEM Governors didn’t obstruct #Hydroxycloroquine &amp;didn’t seed infected into nursing homes
Trump: “Absentee ballots are good, but mail ballots are a huge fraud.”
They pontificate in these what if’s as if any of these reporters have the slightest inkling of what motivates Trump voters.
Tell that imbecile  who said Trump was ‘joking’ about delaying the election, to turn on the #TrumpPressConference.
All I can say is, #BigTech, have your fun now, because after Trump wins re-election and takes back the House with a #MAGA Speaker, he is gonna kick your ass sideways.
Just found out Donald trump is the hero ...MIND BLOWN
That's a lie.
The Federalist Society, the people who gave Trump a list of the most radical right-wing judges on the planet. Yeah, you guys have a lot of credibility, doing harm to the country, that is.
He's literally failing upwards just bc Trump is so awful. Most people voting Joe are doing so *against* Trump, not *for* Joe or any policy. He's flavorless tofu. This is peak hostage situation. He's literally our only option and only marginally less damaging than Trump on policy.
Donald Trump messed things up so bad that people with U.S. passports literally can’t travel almost anywhere in the world.
The Federalist Society just pulled a Hamilton on Trump
Lol ! It'll be useful if working in close contact with people who can suddenly cough or project body fluids or to avoid touching the eyes . The shield protects the nose as a port of entry also.  But if social distance is ok more than 6ft none of those are necessary
Trump is a fascist and wannabe authoritarian. And I’m a proud anti fascist. He and all his cronies need to go far away and never surface again. #WhyIDontLikeTrump
So this cracker Trump got the nerve to say November election should be postponed cause of COVID-19 concerns but this the same man calling it a hoax?
Who cares about the Flynn case? Nobody cause Trump will pardon him anyway. Who cares about the Steele Dossier? Nobody except #DevinNunes. Who cares about the Portland protests, except #SeanHannity? and who cares about #BilldeBlasio - nobody. Sums up most of politics I follow.
Donald is trying to be distracting everyone from this:
Imagine trump does all this nonsense and Nancy fucking Pelosi is sworn in 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How were these reporters told they were only at the press conference to fluff Trump?
I clench my teeth so tightly when I hear Trump speak my teeth ache for hours.
Screw Pollo Tropical!! they donated their money to the Trump campaign!! That’s why I only buy their yuca bites now
I think Bernie voters hate the DNC more than they hate Trump. They may look at letting Trump win as a way of breaking the DNCs back so they can take over in 2022.
Someone PLEASE TALK ME OFF THE LEDGE. I see shit like this and I am convinced trump will win.
Police brutality , That IS criminal activity.  tRump abuses his power, THAT is criminal activity.  Stone lies in court, THAT is criminal activity.  Cohen goes to jail for commiting crimes on individual 1, yet individual 1 walks, THAT is criminal activity, and the list. Now STFU.
#AddAWordRuinATVShow? That's easy, Trump.
TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This isn’t news, it’s opinion shows punctuated with clips of trump to make you mad and whatever soft peddle propaganda the DNC wants in front of your face.
18-30 voters and black voters will NOT turn out to vote for a candidate they aren't excited about. Also former Bernie Campaign staff are saying no way Bernie voters vote for Biden.  We are headed for an epic Trump rout and take back of the House. This will be huge.
I find it so ridiculous how republicans talk about voting fraud like they’re the most perfect little angels. I’m sure y’all would be committing voting fraud too just to save your lord and savior Trump
Trump is POS he going delayed to Presidential Election he can not do that. that is Illegal you know Election Day will be on November 3rd This Years
Are you suggesting Donald could ever  e winning NY or Ca? 😭😭😭
The Man  Donald Trump told Frank Sinatra his costs were 'a little rich'. His response was incredible

Trump hopes to address UN in person this September as other nations stay virtual, envoy says -
President Trump asks recovered COVID-19 patients to donate plasma -
His briefing is nauseating.  I want to throw bricks at the tv for his utterly outrageous claims of voter fraud.  Suggestion:  Since according to him an "absentee ballot" is fine, everyone needs to request one so he'll shut up.
Helmut Norpoth, a political science professor at Stony Brook University--who forecasted ⁦ 2016 and has accurately predicted 25 out of 27 elections--said that Trump's reelection chances are above 90% #MAGA #mypresident
But according to Donald it is not being that big of the deal. He wants to open schools but we are unable to vote? He would have to be admitting his failure created "the emergency that is Covid." 😏
Folks, Trump is gonna win.
You brought up trump didn’t you
Panic? Did  not take Covid-19 seriously? Did  attend Trump’s rally in Tulsa WITHOUT a mask? How did that work out?
It’s outrageous that Trump is going to try and hold up the election results!
”Cain, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after attending President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa without wearing a mask, has died at the age of 74.”
I am outraged that a Trump is giving a campaign speech as opposed to a Presser. Biden should have equal time.
Obama presses for voting rights in pointed eulogy honoring John Lewis  How great to hear an eloquent leader speak like a leader and not some ignorant imbecile that prides himself on remembering five words in ten minutes ⁦
No such thing. Real conservatives love Trump.
Dear   will leave the  January 21st, otherwise President Nancy Pelosi will activate the National Guard to get you, and Trump out
--&gt; Horrible numbers came out today; --&gt; John Lewis was eulogized by 3 presidents; --&gt; Obama killed it. Trump didn't go and sent nobody; --&gt; Herman Cain died probably because he attended Trump's Tulsa Rally; --&gt; Repubs have no $ plan.  --&gt; trump holds a useless press conference.
I'll explain what is happening here.  No one gives a damn about Biden. No one likes Biden. No one is excited about Biden. 2/3 of the Biden vote in a recent poll were voting AGAINST Trump, not FOR Biden. 90% of Trump voters were voting FOR Trump.  If that hold, Biden loses YUGE.
He died a Trump-Ass-Kissin’ fool! He undoubtedly has also infected many others! God spared him from cancer &amp; he turns around &amp; praises tRump! Cain’s very public defiance of experts &amp; his very public praise of Trump, led to his very swift &amp; unnecessary death! #TrumpIsAnIdiot
My point was we knew all sorts of reasons why ghetto &amp; crowdwed latin commun too would be hit hard from stats despite the initial surge among jet-setters. We no longer read or check anything out. Compare Zelenko 3/28 &amp; NYT 4/02 &amp; it's clear. Trump is a symptom, not just a cause
Trump just said the entire world cares about our America’s voting system 😭
Trump's taken one question and has gone all over the place for almost 10 mins now. He couldn't pass a sobriety test.
Wallace apologized, begged for forgiveness in one of the grandest Churches in Alabama in the late 70s.  Being forthright, honest in his transgressions,and humble, he received over 90% of the African-American vote while running for governor in 1982.  Trump can’t duplicate that.
Yeah thats not the trump test. Weve been asking for rapid testing for month and he didnt do it. IN FACT he keeps taking money away from testing. 151,000 dead and counting. A competent president would have prevented most of that and used DPA for rapid tests months ago.
Trump says Nov elections might take years to resolve. Obama was not scared of elections like Trump, get ready to march to the  and demand Trump's removal. #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
Watching Trump on TV outright lie to the citizens of the United States.  Oregon &amp;other states have been voting by mail for years.They have the data to prove it works.  I object to Trump doing a campaign speech on national TV. Biden deserves equal time to address all US citizens
Trump's campaign is ... actively adding Republicans to the list
Trump is setting up to nullify the November 3 Election. He’s saying it might take months and years before we find out who won. Folks, we need to hit the streets as soon as possible.
Trump says it’s totally safe to send our kids back to school.  Trump also says we should delay the election until it’s safe.  They say Trump supporters are either billionaires, or easily manipulated idiots. Check your bank account to see which one you are.

Maybe he shouldn’t have defended trump for so long. What did he think would happen.  Screw his guilt
Watching his propaganda news briefing, Trump said that things in Florida is getting better. Yesterday some 264 died and today, we’ll over 250 from COVID-19. How can he lie and the Fox crowd blelieves him. They are complecit in his crimes.
Not with trump
trump is a moron. a liar. a philanderer. a grifter. a thief. l don't care about Biden and he wouldn't be my first or second or even third choice. What I care is that trump loses. I'd rather have Biden than trump any day.

So u realize what party is pushing fascism?  (d). Fascism is control of major industries by government. Trump doesn’t want that n having jobs n plants being rebuilt here in the US. He’s been opposite of fascist. One party keeps changing the rules. It’s a fact. Fascists take guns
I’m no fan of Trump, as my Twitter feed will tell you, but this has already been debunked as false. There’s plenty of really awful stuff he really did say, so no need to give the pro-Trumpsters any excuse to dismiss your opinion because of “fake news.” Jijiji Just saying...
If a Democratic President had done anyone of the zillion things Trump has done, you would be clamoring for impeachment or the 25th amendment.

GWB has been the biggest individual beneficiary of the two greatest disasters for our country in this century. First, 9/11, although he squandered that benefit, with a lot of help from Rumsfeld and Cheney; second, the installation of Trump in the presidency.
They are. But not from now,since started. Flu takes more lives yearly &amp; nobody claimed or yelled anything,the economy did not collapsed ,but libtards got into power and with an specific agenda to destroy us from within and guess what? They are about to fullfill that ,if no Trump!
I would walk through glass to vote for Donald J Trump this November.
Bernell Trammell's life mattered.   But because this man backed Trump the left mob doesn't think so.
Trump last week (skin color was mentioned in thread &amp; China is virus home) Tweeted we will take (since Hong Kong take over) all that wish to come as legal immigrants. That could be millions. Media doesn’t even mention that if U notice. He attacks China for virus but wants 2 help

What does it mean to be republican nowadays anyway? None of the long held positions still apply after trump and just being opposed to D positions isn’t a platform. I suppose pro-business, and if Ds are in power deficit spending.

#1Trump cannot use his executive powers, even in a national emergency, to delay the  November 2020 election. Only Congress can set the date of the presidential election.  And even if the election was delayed, Trump's and Pence's terms would still end at noon on January 20, 2021.

It’s not going to work. If someone is a Trump supporter they know exactly who you are.
Im sure trump has shares on hydroxychloroquine. Never seen someone push something that has no clear scientific evidence with covid-19.   So tired of seeing his face. Hope in november after he loses he goes under a rock.  Freaking turtle
Not a chance. There is no breaking through to people in the Trump cult. Some are literally paying with their lives. Remember Jonestown?  Blind devotion is a powerful thing. And deadly.
I'm voting in person and I'm voting for President Trump!
With benefits expiring, Trump and GOP are lost without a map. As the coronavirus crisis rages, Republicans are attacking Dems for being too generous, while Trump attacks Dems for not being generous enough.

Hey, he wanted to die for Trump's economy, like other Republicans have said, they're willing to sacrifice their lives for Trump, so he, and many others Republicans are now dead, just like they wanted

Searing, but wrong. You can be a buffoonish heckler, and still be a brutal strongman. Trump absolutely could be both. He's not quite the latter, but that's more because he—thank God—lacks that final gene or chromosome allowing him to issue the "kill order." But he's gotten close.
This is active sabotage against the post office for the purpose of undermining vote by mail and the November election. It’s a delibate strategy of voter suppression perpetrated by Trump and his cronies.
This guy’s commentary on American politics is worthless. I also recall him saying Trump is going to jail.
President Trump asked for the November elections to be delayed.  So what?  Get over it.
I was just thinking of the same thing today. Trump has made us look like what he calls a s-hole country.
What’s shocking is just the utter disrespect. I mean, Trump flat out told reporters “no” he wouldn’t be going to pay respects to John Lewis.
Trump has shown that he will do anything to take away the rights of the 8K #Dreamers in #FL26, keeping their lives in limbo as he scrambles to find ways to destroy DACA.  He must process DACA renewals &amp; new DACA applications now. Dreamers are Americans &amp; we will fight for them.
I mean quite frankly, as much as I despise Trump, Herman Cain was a full grown man in complete use of his capabilities. He had choices. He chose to attend and to not wear a mask so Herman Cain killed Herman Cain.
Republicans, you had to have known that Trump would make a fool out of you. It's what he does best. Just take the L, and rethink what you're doing. Ask yourself if his constant humiliation of you is really worth it.

You have all the reason, but I am going to vote at the ballot box, and my vote goes to you President Donald Trump. Let’s make America great again, and good bless America 🇺🇸
Right, but that was only clear to you. Bc that’s how YOU personally  interpret Trump’s tweet. He has never clarified that, and Claudia never said anything abt mass ballots. Vote by mail (not on a mass scale) IS a thing. She is clarifying this bc Trump doesn’t, &amp; it’s important.

I just asked was he a hateful person, I looked up the word in the dictionary first but I wondered why John Lewis was viewed as hateful. So I asked about Trump to see how someone could say John was hateful but Trump wasn't. Its not that complicated.
Agreed. I’m just saying, she IS right. There isn’t a difference. Bc voting by mail &amp; MASS voting by mail are different things. She’s not wrong just bc you interpret Trump’s tweets in a way that he’s actually never clarified. He presents them as the same thing. (Not by accident.)
Absolutely not! #VoteNovember3 #Vote2020

I’m less worried about Trump succeeding than him failing w/ violence.   Example: .5% of his base is enough to create massive, widespread violence whether or not it changes the result of the election. And they’d be doing it while Trump was still President &amp; in control of DHS.
that's the point. BLM is not a government sponsored event. Trump's rallies are. They are the government actively endangering citizens. That's the difference between BLM, gas station, or anywhere else someone can get the virus. And I ask, for what reason was it necessary to do it
Trump the man, and "Trump" the idea are only electable as a very American response to a black president. There's no mystery to solve.

Thank you for waiting for an answer. If he went to a BLM protest and got it there, I am sure you will be saying the same thing I am saying about him getting it a Trump rally. Of course you can get it anywhere, the point is the government should not be promoting dangerous events

Just a reminder that Donald Trump's tweet about the election is another ploy  to take away attention from Russia putting bounties on U.S soldiers.  And removing 12,000 troops from Germany to benefit Russia.
False. My state (Florida) transitioned from absentee to vote by mail, &amp; you 100% have to request the ballot, just the same as before. The ONLY difference is whether the ballots are counted before or after live voting. So, yeah, Trump DOES NOT vote absentee. He votes by mail.
Trump is loosing terrain due to the mismanagement of the Pandemic. Accused China for his carelessness dealing with all situations with Americans and the races issues. He showed no respect for anyone or everything. We the Prople are tired of his clownish and ignorance.

#HermanCain is just another casualty of #TrumpsEgo  Trump's desire for an #antimask revolution puts everyone in jeopardy and he doesn't EVEN care. #NeverForget it's ALWAYS about how this serves Trump NOT America  #COVID19 kills, it doesn't care who
President Trump says FBI and DOJ will investigate killing of Fort Hood soldier #VanessaGuillen .  received the grieving family, including Vanessa's mother, Gloria, in the Oval Office today. The family wants Trump to support #IAmVanessaGiullen military justice reform bill.
There is a reason Trump is never invited to give eulogies at funerals.
Donald Trump killed this man with propaganda, misinformation and LIES.  This is what happens if you believe in Trump.
And Trump is??? 😂😂😹😹
He died from the Trump Virus. You neglected to write that.
You are wrong. The ONLY difference is that absentee votes are counted after live voting &amp; vote-by-mail is counted before. Also, fun fact, there is no absentee voting in FL. Only vote by mail. So Trump DOES NOT vote absentee.
Trump after fucking up the country cause he’s a horrible leader
Doesn't take nerve,nor are they unaware or unconcerned.....they are the lowest common denominators a.k.a. ignorant racist trump supporters
It happens every few months when he makes a public appearance and doesn’t act like an ass like trump does
THANK YOU!!! Omfg the ignorance abt this absolutely kills me. The ONLY difference is if ballots are counted before or after live voting.  Also, there is no absentee voting in the state of Florida anymore. It’s ONLY vote-by-mail. So, TRUMP does NOT vote absentee. He votes by mail.

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
The SHIT IS GOING TO HIT THE ROOF....a LOT OF FAKERS ARE REALLY FUCK...TRUMP 2020 FICKERS ...GOD BLESS 🙏
Wow... The fact he died after attending the #Tulsa Trump rally just makes it that more worse. Though unclear about whether he contracted COVID-19 at the rally, people will always wonder.
Is Trump a hateful person?
You are wrong, this is a funeral and it’s being used for politics campaigning. Not the platform.   congressman John Lewis targeted Donald Trump in a personal manner, this is why he will not speak. John Lewis Was his enemy just like you are don’t expect Trump to be at yours!
I’m keeping with my John Lewis groove. No Trump today.
Trump could NEVER
Is nothing, darling. Be having the good day. 😉
I’ll have a beer with Bush. I don’t want to be near trump.
Absolutely not we are showing out November 3rd!
trump keeps reminding us how much of a dumb, insecure piece of shit he is
Even if you don’t like trump have some respect for the man that died, everyone is so full of hate now
Girl bye.  Ffs Trump just did an influencer tweet for a Company he supports. You guys would have impeached Obama in a hot second.
Always in business' pocket. You're also silent while Trump caters to Putin's campaign against American soldiers.  When are you going to condemn the long standing Miami tradition of human trafficking from Cuba? You could be so much better but choose the safer low road.
Today I was reminded why  can't stand   Despite Trump's amazing brain, best common sense, a memory better than ANYONE, etc, he'll never be able to speak like Obama; not just speak but speak with meaning and heart.  #trumpcanlearn #Trump #Obama

Unfortunately the left constantly uses pretzel logic. DACA order was unconstitutional from Obama, he can't create laws! That is up to congress. Separation on powers. Trump orders it stopped, 5 clowns say OMG that is "capricious", you can't do that. The liberal 2 step shuffle!
Why didn't trump share his hydroxychloroquine with Herman Cain? He could have saved him.🤔
Civil war started in 2011.  Trump took Assad’s side
Trump meeting with Vanessa Guillen's family during Lewis's funeral...despicable. Utter trash and I can't believe hispanic networks are falling for it This is how latinx struggles are pitted against black liberation - we are treated as distractors of progress
and sales it for $440 who is going to buy that ? I'll tell you who! it's privileged rich white kids who think just by wearing this they support BLM and posted a black square in their insta yet they vote for Trump. Virgil should  at least give his proceeds to Black Lives Matter.
After watching people entertain scores of bad-faith arguments, Obama just put on his mask and walked off, and it was like, oh yeah, Trump could've done that months ago but instead decided to publicly wonder if we should be drinking disinfectant.

Trump saying this after misinforming people and promoting business/society to open back up as if there was/is no covid-19 in our communities is voter suppression.
This is why you can’t politizie science or health. Herman Cain attended Trump’s rally that people nor himself were wearing masks &amp; he caught the virus. After being hospitalized for a month the man died from corona. RIP Herman. Please guys, wear your mask &amp; social distance..

NEW: President Trump’s suggestion on Thursday morning that the presidential election should be delayed drew surprise from top Florida Republicans who said they expect voting to take place in November as guaranteed by federal law.
Seriously.  Only teachers also get blamed for every thing wrong in society, are accused of being overpaid, and now we are supposed to save the economy by throwing our bodies onto Trump's pyre. I don't see journalists having those problems.
Trump will accept the election results via an audit to validate all mail in ballots as authentic.
Honor and decency??  He started a phony war that has killed a million people and is still going on.  What is wrong with people? Trump is awful but he is nowhere near the Bush family’s body count. Yet...
If Biden gets elected, Trump's orders in service to Russia will be rescinded.

American people are hurting because you created this economy devastation supporting a dysfunctional Trump closing yours eyes while American are dying and suffering. You are a hypocrite. US just reported 1,400 fatalities 24 hours, that is one per minute. You contributed as he did.

The threat of the virus would go away overnight if President Trump would do this. 😎
If Trump want's to delay an election because it's too dangerous then children should not attend school until it is safe to do so.
If Obama felt this way about voting rights during his term, we could have avoided Trump altogether.

You clowns have no shame ..what does this have to do with paying your respect to someone that has done a lot for this country   You just want to defend Trump no matter what  I see you promoting that crazy alien doctor as well..never too late to wake up
It speaks so strong that Donald Trump isn’t present.
What's funny is I just today got blocked by a Trump partisan for being appalled at Trump's latest assault on liberty.  Maybe open your eyes to a world that isn't binary, It's the real world, actually.
So much respect for that man. Such a far cry from  “He was a great great man. Tremendous. I liked him a lot. We would talk real estate together. A lot of people don’t know that about Jack - but he was a big real estate guy. Almost as big a trump, who we know is also tremendous..”

I don’t have to wait to know that Trump isn’t Innocent .   He knows what goes on , people forget that everyone knows stuff like this is happening day in and out but let it go because they profit from it . All of them .
Just so we’re super clear on this: Trump’s Rally killed Hermin Cain.

Americans are screwed either way with Trump or Biden.  There’s no such thing as a better choice , if both are evil .  Both are carrying our agendas that don’t help Working Americans.
Trump’s loss needs to be monumental, a cataclysmic event for the history books, a tsunami of votes that overwhelm in its certitude of our repugnance &amp; total disavowment of everything he stands for. AND we must not forget we need the Senate &amp; House. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

ICYMI: Delay the election? Trump suggests postponing Election Day to avoid mail-in voting
I gotta laugh how trump admin wants to blast Chavez and Maduro, yet he’s pulling their move by attempting to delay or postpone election. Trump is literally every corrupt Latin America  despot president that try’s to consolidate his power.
Biden but both are bad .  Trump ain’t the answer , all of them are corrupt and use power to manipulate .  Both are evil and having him in power has created more division .
What a shame that was his own last public tweet. Trump has more 🩸 on his hands.
Yes it will be voter fraud like always been, perfect example NYC..and NJ the voting is full of shit...we need to ckeck ID..and stop the voting by MAIL..if the ads hold can go and protest..WE CAN GO OUT AND VOTE..TRUMP 2020 FUCKERS..
Well done Terrence, his live matters too, but because he supported our President Trump they killed him. We are dealing with killer and crazy people!  God bless America 🙏🏻 God bless our President Trump 🙏🏻

Two of the 4 are in China.. You would rather blame Trump coward
Agreed. What really creases me is that Trump cares nothing abt Rx prices—he's only doing this as what will assuredly be 1 of many last-ditch efforts 2 buy votes. He's a capitalist pig, as bad as they are+doesn't give a monkey's how much they overcharge. Despicable+transparent.
is the only waterhole for desperate Trump voters, they go there to be lied to because it makes them feel good, never mind it's all lies and misinformation, the poor bastards don't know any better
Due to the Trump’s late, slow, disastrous approach to the coronavirus pandemia, USA is a huge graveyard with more than 150000 deaths and he is still misleading people . Trump’s inflammatory comments aggravated the racial crisis due to police brutality! Trump is unfit! Vote blue!
Ask yourself this... how many Joe Biden flags or lawn signs have you seen in your neighborhood compared to Trump flags and lawn signs ?!?! That’s the real question!
I don’t think Trump spoke today!
Idiot, what do you expect when  is the only Trumpian cable station in the nation? Matter of fact, 63 million voted for Trump, so Fox is doing really bad when only 3 or 4 million of them even bother to watch.

Trump lives rent free in your head all day
Obama used the politics that Lewis lived for in his eulogy which is deeply appropriate and seems to be what Lewis would have done. If people see that waving the banner of voting rights as anti-trump… well… I think that might say more about the president than anything else.
I’m not seeing how the politics of openness, inclusivity, and enfranchisement are connected to Trump in any way, save for the fact that Trump is has taken measures against all of those things.
The real death rate is being hidden by the trump White House.
TRUMP 2020..
What a sentence by  “Far from a strongman, Mr. Trump has lately become a heckler in his own government...”
We need to vote every Republican out that has enabled Trump and made our country the laughing stock of the world.
Yeah, that’s not going to happen. Florida has already turned Blue and it’s looking like Texas will go Blue too. Nobody likes Trump. Nobody.
Sigh, a “Trump 2.0” president is gonna beat this guy in 2024
Trump hasn’t been successful in subverting the law. The problem is much of the constitution assumed that those in office would be ethical gentlemen. Trump is neither. Even Rubio said today there will be no postponing the election.
Sorry to bait you. The comment was to trick some Trump supporters with an absurd statement :)

I had taken as political hyperbole Dems’ assertion that Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic &amp; is itself grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment again by the House of Representatives and his removal from office by the Senate
They know nothing will come from their statement.  They are saying that now so that when trump is out they can say "we stated we disagreed with him".  CYA. Thats all it is.
Buy stamps &amp; other post office supplies, YES! But we should temporarily stop mailing anything unless absolutely needed.  is short-staffed due to #COVID19 &amp; Louis DeJoy ordered cuts. We need to reduce volume to allow postal workers to process voter ballots in spite of Trump.

Don’t trust them. Don’t ever. But if they collectively abandon Trump it’s lights out at Trump campaign HQ. Like there’s no money and no point to continue.
Trump talked about the re-infestation in foreign countries vs. how good we are doing in the US. You know the next step is his claims a total lockdown would have been useless.
We all expected Trump to threaten to delay the election, right? This shouldn’t come as a surprise, but it should continue to motivate us to act.
why has Trump not been given a psychological evaluation?
Not only that but all the media outlets inferred he contracted the virus after attending a Trump rally with no evidence.
Trump doesn’t joke, even when he’s making fun of people. Have you ever even seen him laugh?
According to MSM Trump reneged on delaying the Election! All of America is on his ass!

And dems so shocked that Trump is concerned.   Amazing.   4 LA men admit to Skid Row voter-fraud scheme, DA announces

You know Obama is a criminal, and the entire left has been filling people minds with lies about Trump. You're just a sad case of TDS! You also know John Lewis was a racist himself, and he did NOTHING for his city. Period but make himself rich.
To who? Putin isn't that vain. He's not going to keep Trump around as a prize.
Yes i do but I'm just saying, having biden would be the worse choive to have as president. No police, segregation may make a comeback, far more blacks in jail. You can say what you want about trump but before covid or in this the chinese virus, he was doing great

That's it in a nutshell. Putin has no loyalty to him. He drop Trump like an 80# bag of cement. And then call in all of his loans. Mar-A-Lago might be on the market sometime next year.

Trump will deport them in due time. When you enable Nazis they always wind up turning on you eventually.
No, there’s no praising them. But it might be a signal to all the conservative judges that they aren’t obligated to support Trump.
My man. I'm no Trump supporter. Didn't vote for him and I dont plan to. But you think he is the only one talking about the validity of our democracy? Both sides attack it as it suites them. Remember how Russia got Trump elected? Trump cant be Castro because America can't be Cuba.
If you believe in Karma, then Trump is in a lot of trouble.
Yeah but Trump is not popular (due to his own putrid actions) surely that is more meaningful than either of those things
I agree, I do not vote by mail, only in person and for the record, I vote for Donald Trump, that will not change, a letter came to my house to vote by mail without my name on the outside or inside, with envelope  with paid mail and so I sent it
Fuck Covid and fuck Donald Trump.
Obama had people entering illegally in cages. Trump terminated that practice. My family came to the US legally even though it cost my grandfather 3 years working at a labor camp in Cuba basically a slave in order to do so. You just have no idea how bad it is in other places
BASKETBALL IS BACK  Also Donald Trump is a White Supremicist, full stop!
LMAO "trump next to a black person". OMG.
What reason would u have for voting for Trump unless you are racist?  Voting republican? They are destroying us.
CBC in full deflection spin by painting Trump as a madman and with  Trudeau as an innocent victim...
Pence rear ended? Trump 2020 bus collided with dump truck?   The universe has a wicked sense of humor 😂😂😂
That *does not* mean mass ballots automatically sent to every voter. “Universal” simply means it would be an OPTION for every citizen in every state, with or without needing to list a reason. Trump would still need to differentiate if that is EXPLICITLY what he’s talking about.
I’m not comparing them in how they got into power. I’m comparing them by the way they present themselves. They both have authoritarian thoughts and motives. Hence, Trump’s tweet today:
Go Trump... 🇺🇸
No mask!  Blame Trump
#Civilization5 : I just had what I call a "Trump Moment"... I pressed the "launch" button while looking at a specific place in the map, not realizing the nuke was pointed somewhere else nearby... now I'm in an unintended war with an opponent much better prepared to kick my ass.
I will always hate him for his “it’s time to come together” post Trump win victory speech.   Like, “we’re pay attention. Are you?”
Kids don’t have serious cases look it up, what trump doesn’t want is mail in voting because it’s so easy to cheat that way, someone’s dead cat got a voter registration card in the mail, I dont click on your videos anymore because of how soyboy you’ve become Hila is cool tho
One of these weeks we'll wake up to a Black Mirror reality of Trump fucking a pig on television. Then he'll do something worse by Tuesday.
When you're a Republican and have lost the Federalist Society....
Trump can't get it through his thick skull that mail in voting benefits both parties equally. On top of that, don't he realize people in the military also vote by mail.
Trump Meets with Family of Slain Soldier, Offers To Pay for Funeral
3rd party is a win for trump though
Tweet is pointing out his death was needless. Not disrespectful at all.
Trump knew about this for years, he even joked about Epstein's pedophilia. He didn't distance himself from Epstein until the property dispute.
Then, all states should have early voting &amp; there shouldn't be voting suppression. In the mist of a global pandemic people shouldn't stand in line hours on end to vote. There's no arguing that President Trump is the President of the USA.
We are ok with that. Even better he was not a narcissist rapist white supremacy idiot like Trump. #RepublicansForBiden #RepublicansAgainstTrump
Please tell me you have a plan ready, for when you win the election, and Trump refuses to abide by the decision.  Please.  I’m worried for me and, most importantly, my family.  #Biden2020

RESIGN! You won't do anything unless Trump tells you to! You do not care about Floridians!
Trump must not let him
Nah, You’re obviously right about their hatred for Trump, but that has nothing to do with that, at least not the main reason, it’s part of a long process to a New World order, this, per George Soros own words.
President Trump asks recovered COVID-19 patients to donate plasma -
It’s inherently racist because we live in a system that guarantees that IF a memeber of the minority group DOES accend to heights, it’s predicated on that individual demonstratively NOT being an Ally to his/her minority group.
So now we're back for circle and you understand my first take. He doesn't have to do anything at all to appeal to any of us and he can just hide. Like I said he's literally failing upwards just because Trump is so awful not because he's offering us anything to vote *for.*
Now you can't even trust the post office To deliver your mail in vote damn Republicans you are really on a roll. Remember to put your names in the history book all you scumbags who  keep supporting trump agenda. Republicans who has broken the laws of the land and covering up for
Trump’s pronouncements today about delaying elections and beehives of terrorists are only trying to grab headlines away from 150k dead from Covid, GDP contracting in Q2 at highest rate ever, and 17 million Americans out of work.
I believe it's too replace funding that went to his wall. And he wants the FBI building to stay where it is so no one builds a hotel there (across from Trump Plaza).
Trying to defend the inept DemocRATS who would not allow  the AG to answer the question?  They were there to grandstand and carry the Anti-Trump banner.
Have you tried the Demon Sperm?
Sounds like a bit ch ass KAREN to me. trump is a bit ch ass KAREN.
Trump thought he'd leave the blue states to screw themselves, as if he weren't the entire country's President!! He's violated his oath to this country. #resigninshame
Thank u 4 doing the rounds on Spanish press, I'm seeing and hearing nicaraguens and venezuelans falling 4 the same BS a lot of the older cuban generation fell for with Trump and you being a reputable republican calling it as it is really is necessary. 2 much  stake!
Oh, so you’re the Trump whisperer?  ok lol
That not new! But today his true colors came out 4all to see. His presidency was d groundwork for much of what’s happening today. He thought it would continue when HRC became President never expected Trump to win but certainly took measures just in case. Disgrace is too nice
Donald is never realizing how desperate and weak his tweets are making him look. 👀
Jealous.   Obama’s eulogy of Lewis went like this  He marched  Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump  He marched some more  Trump Trump Trump TrumpI trust Pres  opinion on #PuertoRico equality today far more than Pres Trump’s DOJ opinion. #52ndState
“New States may be admitted by THE CONGRESS into this Union;” US Const. Art. IV, § 3, Cl 1. Pres Trump’s  can draft any opinion it wants. If #PuertoRico voters choose #statehood, Congress has the final say and will support you! #PRStatehoodNow
Biden and Dems would disband Customs and Border Patrol, if given the chance. That alone is enough to make a sane person vote for Trump in 2020!

#TrumpIsGreat, Yes Trump 2020,
It’s always partisan politics!  There was nothing serious about that. Trump did nothing wrong.  It was obvious. The Dems were grandstanding.   It was such a “solemn moment” wink wink!   I’m guessing u saw all that REAL evidence against Biden  Son?  The billion $ quid pro quo?
He will have h him thrown out the window when trump loses and moves to Moscow
The way Trump has been treated here is just horrible! It’s not the media’s job to campaign for or against a  Presidential nominee!   America’s Conservative roots and voters are being demonized by the Liberal media! They insist there’s no absolute truth. The culture war continues.
Trump is an acting Cult Leader. He has warped peoples minds. They trust and believe in his every word. He is the Leader. His actions and behaviors affect many. He needs to accept responsibility of all the deaths that are happening under his watch.
Do you in the GOP support anything Trump Does,
I guess scumbag trump can’t hear well, I am sure Nancy will have the voting done honest and fair and on time, but now would be a good time since it it ok to send kids back to school
Defend the Clean Air Act from Trump Administration Attack
Congress decides election date, not Pres Trump, &amp; we’re not changing it. His false comments about elections &amp; vote by mail are right out of a dictator’s playbook &amp; show he’s unfit for office. We cannot elect VP  &amp; turn the page on this disastrous presidency soon enough.
Trump must be removed out of office and thrown to jail! #WeWillVote
He attended the Trump rally during his life.... I don't see the problem. Keep shying away from the facts that don't align with your point of view, ostriches seem to get along just fine.
Donald Trump tried voting by mail in Florida, and when it was rejected because he doesn't live in Florida, he changed his address to that of Mar-A-Lago where members are contractually forbidden from using it as their permanent residence. The fraud is inside the White House.
Trump wants Election Day to be delayed. Booohooo is someone Scared he won’t win ?
The Trump documentary he 'doesn't want you to see' is getting released

It’s called throwing as much mud as possible at Trump and hoping any thing will stick! The mud doesn’t even have to be true just as long as it’s salacious and can convince a  biased media to run with a false narrative! During the campaign Trump will talk about Biden-China/Burisma
The child
Because before the pandemic Trump had record low black unemployment and record low black on government assistance. He’s also trying to reform the crime bill that Bill Clinton put in place. If you’re smart you’ll vote to keep him. He was never racist until he ran against them.
#EveryoneLovesTrump Yes     People should love Trump for what he is doing with this Country, Making America Great Again 2020, #EveryoneLovesTrump
Maybe because of a pandemic and because the Democrats have dragged there feet for 3.5 years. Not approving or screening Trump's nominations. Do a little research before putting things in writing.
This #corrupt #trump #thetraitor is a wannabe #davidkoresh. He wants to lead #AMERICANCITIZENS down the road to their death. WAKE UP AMERICA
Trump, is what is happening to America.
You’re a LIAR! Trump isn’t corrupt no matter how many times you say he is! The Left said they would resist Trump and that is the CORRUPTION!   You have dragged your voters down the dark road of evil politics! AG Barr has more integrity in his little finger than u will EVER have!
This was a long investigation. Trump has nothing to do with this !
I can tell the photo is fake because the dog would have been attacking trump like the eagle that he attempted to use as a prop. 😂🤣
This really exceeds the reason, hours and days  testified on #bengazi . #trump #thetraitors followers won't even talk of this. Are they trying to kill all of us?

Doesn't matter what you think of Trump but he has shed light on this shit.....no one trust the media or government... Very interesting to see ghe Nov elections
We almost long Portland guys, thanks to Trump we still have it. Give it up for the best president in all of history 👏🏽. Oh and we’re about to lose the whole U.S. to a pandemic, but don’t worry about that for now, Trump will handle it right?
Go Trump #Trump2020
Your Party has a KNACK of losing to the MOST PATHETIC opponents.  Two times against George W. Bush (the worst president ever).  Now likely a second time to Trump.
No. She actually LOST.  To Trump.
Basically Run ahead of Trump: John Cornyn Run behind Trump: Steve Daines About the same as Trump: John James
Credit where credit is due...  Trump has done 1 good thing. He got rid of the no insurance penalty with the ACA.
1) I am not voting for Trump; 2) You are likely going to lose to Trump; 3) the ACA was a bailout for Insurance Companies and kept health care DEPENDENT on Insurance.  There is no field, this is no game.  Biden is on the other side.
No I am not supporting Trump. How hard is that to understand. I support NEITHER Trump nor Biden.  Get it - neither.  Neither is promoting a progressive agenda.  Learn how we got into this mess in the first place (playing the two party game).
I'm not voting for Trump.  Or Biden.
Go Trump Twenty Twenty
If Biden wins pandemic ends  If trump wins they’ll create another pandemic   Democrats have run out of options.
Not Donald Trump who refuses several times.
What a different world we see!   You’re an American right? And you WANT to see the President either fail or die? It’s amazing how TDS can affect your soul.   I would liken it to a racist from the 50’s who spit on the 4 negro students in Little Rock! You have PURE HATE for Trump!
Daddy Trump has to sign off on it, which he will, do our accounts will be stimulated by the end of the month 🤸🏽‍♀️ hopefully sooner
Yup, Trump will be reelected!
LIAR! What is it with women and power? Why are you degrading your gender by applauding evil while despising what’s right?   I love how the Dems try to predict Trump’s next move. He’s ready to declare martial law! We are watching God harden the hearts of millions before our eyes!
Thank you for not forcing us to watch Trump as others do.
Trump reportedly told aides to get Yankees to let him throw first pitch - but they hadn't actually invited him
Kissing his ass. We know barr has #trump #thetraitors ear just by the way  name is brought up every few questions.  We know where trump gets it. No accountability
If #trump #thetraitor hadn't given billionaires a tax break  wouldn't need to raise families taxes. What a shit show gaslighting has become you don't scare us #AMERICANCITIZENS are stronger together!!!!!
Barr resembles #trump #thetraitor and the #greedy #gop,#corrupt resemble #trump .
is it really possible for #trump to get elected 3 terms?
I’m not against criticizing Trump, I’m against bending backwards to please the media and Dems (but I repeat myself)
Trump doesn’t do well cooped up
Haha, truly pathetic when a Trump supporter is afraid to admit he does in fact support the President. Your whole timeline is white supremacist rage and retweets of the OAN network. Later, fool
it’s the trump crop top for me!
Trump says he won’t go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol
jobs jobs jobs Eric. MASS Exodus from China will curb the coming recession. Only your father Donald Trump could make something like that happen and really separate himself from the socialist democratic party. The only thing I know of that will save our economy .
. callous #COVID19 response fails America. It has jobless benefits cuts from $600 to $200 per wk, no funds to keep firefighters, teachers, nurses &amp; cops on the job, &amp; lacks housing help, but includes new FBI building to help Trump’s DC Hotel.
I have no expectations of the #corrupt #criminal #greedy #traitor #BillBarr to answer questions truthfully anymore than if #trump #thetraitor was testifying.  For some reason #gop and this #administration are trying to make all this #corruption look like it's #Democrat based.
That's Gov DeSantis playing with numbers a la Trump
This is a serious issue that needs to be pushed and pushed until we get answers. I’m far from a trump fan, but this makes you wonder what to believe. I watched the entire conference.
Facebook will not remove Trump ad using Ukraine picture of protesters - Business Insider. The picture's photographer confirmed to Business Insider on Wednesday that the image is of pro-democracy protesters in Ukraine six years ago.
Conservative wonders if Trump won’t throw first pitch because he’s afraid of walking down the ramp or players kneeling   U scarred
The UN has become irrelevant!  A strong and powerful response to this criminal activity is desperately needed. The Feds have been very patient so far.   It is Trump’s duty as President to protect the people and their property from external and INTERNAL Criminal forces! ACT NOW!
I can all but guarantee  won’t be voting for Trump... that’s ok though!
Ignore all the polls. Trump has a good shot at keeping Florida. I live here
Please watch/share. tRUMP is trying to set the stage in able to the results.
Trump will never will this election fair and square!! He is a thief in chief!!
I hope and pray every Democrat knows that trump has put his crone in charge of the post office, so if you vote by mail chances are,, you lost your vote,, get off ur ass and go to the polls
I thought Trump aside this aide is going to be huge. It’s the same 1200 if passed.
That is good,I would bet Mr. Lewis wouldn’t want him to come, he is still a better man then trump will ever be
Really I’m just hoping that if Trump wins Michigan, his coattails would also help John James
Oh please... I’ve never been a Trump reporter.  😆 How are the riots on the President? One has nothing to do with the other whatsoever.  The terrorists of Antifa/BLM started all of this violence and destruction. The division is caused by demented identity politics. Wake up...
Its not about Trump.  You can’t restore a democracy undemocratically.  Biden is a joke and an insult.  I would never vote for him.
BREAKING NEWS please #protesters use this guideline because trump is using anything he can to corrupt this needed protest to stamp out inequality in our #country #democrecy #Constitution
is compromised by #trump #thetraitor,   and #jaredkurshner I have no idea they are both unqualified.  So #trump #thetraitor doesn't want  to be running the worthless #COVID19 task force.
Trump won’t even visit John Lewis #JohnLewis
Look... if you want to see who Trump cares about, just see the way he treats those close around him. It really doesn’t take a Einstein.
if Trump says liberals and #WallofMoms hate our country, then he must be a liberal since he supports #PutinsBounties against our American troops. #ResistanceTaskForce
What narratives is Trump pushing that you obviously find so offensive?
Looking like trump and  Kanye West 😂🤣😂🤣😂😂
The same people complaining about what Trump is doing to this beautiful country are literally the ones “peacefully”destroying everything in this country.  Brilliant. Fucking brilliant. I was never a Trump supporter until this rioting and terrorism started.
⁦ Trump why don’t you go hide out in the bunker because that’s where your residential picture it will be posted. Shame on you. You’ve just showed 🇺🇸 how much of a true racist that you are. Jealous Of John Lewis’s legacy , just like Pres Obama
Hey Donald you weren’t invited! ⁦⁦ shame on you Trump! #WeWillMakeSureToVoteYouOutThisNovember
yeh the news doesn't really put numbers in perspective and discard the false the data-- And oh-- the other red states will follow with increasing alarm rates because that means no Trump rallies.. BUT , lets all gather to commit crime. #FakeNews #TruthMatters #AmericaWakeUp
So you believe if Trump quits golfing nobody will ever die again? Dude, I hate to break it to you but people are going to die no matter what. Even after we quit talking about Covid, people wii continue to die.
This is just hilarious. If Trump were the fascist you on the left claim, you have given him countless Kristalnachts to move in and seize control. In fact, the only people who have embraced telling Americans what to do and taking rights away are Democrat mayors and governors.
No Trump is not the 1syt line of defense for a local city. How long have ALL politicians in both sides been in office? And you wanna put all the blame on 1 man who has had less than 4 years? USA was doing great before covid
The only thing I hate about twitter is that Donald Trump has one.
Who has the power to prosecute except the president? Trump do your duty and prosecute all of them.

Biden could very well win but SC? I’d bet my home and my entire life savings on Trump getting a similar margin there as in 2016

Trump 2020 and if not since the polls say biden they are the same pools said Trump down in 2016 Fixed, Biden will destroy this country and he wont run it his VP will how sad
So should trump.
True but without Fairfax, Loudon, Prince William, Trump would have won VA by about 4
Actual U.S deaths from covid are severely inflated for reasons for example to blame and make Trump look bad. The Dems will stop at nothing for power.

This isn't Trump. This is antifa and BLM. This is the far left.
I kinda suspected something like this due  to his inaction. Who is out there who can kick butt? Do we know why Trump appointed Barr? Maybe he was just God’s choice? Maybe he isn’t the same as what he was? People do change you know. Preacher said he will raise the bar of justice.
Trump is calling rioting Marxist anarchists destroying public property domestic terrorists. Because they are.
i tried discussing politics with my mother. the moment i called trump a rascist that i didn’t support she became defensive and asked for proof of *air quotes* the rascist things he’s said/done. lord oh lord this election will be a shitty year.

America's Greatest Triumph (Trump) I think the video meant to say. Please fund the cops with more money and better training, not less money. Thanks for showing this video. Now I know I'm voting for Trump's Keep America Strong.
The Law and Trump are one in the same. The citizens of Portland who pay taxes needs to not be worried about basic security!
And just like that the Trump campaign crumbles.
I'm  a part of all three: I detest #trump #thetraitor  I'm a former #republican  I will never vote #republican again
The only reason Trump sent federal troops to your city is because you allowed Portland to become a haven for criminals masquerading as protesters. And now you think defunding the Police is somehow a good idea? Trump has my permission to do what’s necessary to end this crap!
And you trust Trump?? 🤔🤔
I doubt that the majority of the people of Portland actually think you care about them! Your hatred for Trump is also a hatred of everything that is right for America. If Obama had made the same policy decisions as Trump has made you and the rest of the haters would be overjoyed!
Folks who love America, love Donald Trump.
In your dreams!!  4 more years!  Hispanics and veterans for Trump have your back mr president!   4 more years!
Trump says deadly Covid is a 'downer' while bragging about being in 'so many rap songs'   Trust what I say nothing positive
Key Trump campaign donor steps back from supporting president’s latest election bid
You think trump fields tough questions??   he doesn’t answer anything straight forward and nothing is his fault. He’s a privileged 4 year old who boasts about picture tests. All of you orange occupant supporters are WEIRDOS!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don’t hold it against people for supporting Trump in 2016, it was a hard choice for some people and even though it didn’t seem that way to me, I understand. However, we’ve now had over 3 years of his “policies” and I think at this point the goal should be to have him fade away
More garbage from trump my goodness try focusing on my important things like the crisis we are going through now - the pandemic for example
These pieces of garbage are going to kill us with the TRUMP VIRUS 🦠
Trump signs order to lower the cost of medicine 🤷‍♂️ not bad #bigpharma
Perfect, I love President Trump!
Trump has talked about how his life was better before he was president. I say give him the life he wants. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #TrumpIsUnwell
If I die from the “Trump Virus” my head Stone will read “ I die because of the Trump Virus”
If I catch the “TRUMP VIRUS” and die my headstone will say because of the “TRUMP VIRUS 🦠 I died”
I'm hoping that all of Trump's supporters and enablers end up in prison or in a hole like Sadam Hussain.
#trump #thetraitor is a #KimJongUn wannabe
Every time less and less peoples show to support Trump and Pence.
Ya don't think everyone in the vicinity of trump is tested daily or more? Lol smhSame could be said for your comments, sir. Please tell us you're not like trump who always thinks he's the smartest person in the room. Do you think you're the smartest person in the room. Sure sounds like it.
Did you know Trump voted illegally? It was in the papers here, but nothing was done of course. See, in FL, you have to list a residential address. M-A-L is not on the books as residential, so Trump actually committed VOTER FRAUD!
Oh. My. God. Can it be? I feel the rapture going through me and not lifting me up because hell no. All because Trump told a truth for once!!
Obama did 2 things that I'd take him 2 task 4, the TPA he wanted, but finally got shamed out of at the last min, n not telling #MoscowMitch 2 piss off 2 even up the playing field after Comey's fucking brain aneurism ouying the HRC emails by throwing the 🇷🇺 help 4 Trump into play.
Yes at the hands of Donald J Trump
So can we now say that Donald J. Trump KlLLED Cain? AFAF
Not a socialist but I don’t like Trump. This is still America right?
Not a chance. Biden will win in a landslide and after that, the only unresolved issue will be where to send trump's last presidential check. By the way, these conspiracy theory, worst case scenario stories, serve no real purpose. Report real news and lay off the what if stories.
King Trump?
King Trump??
The crazy thing about this is that nobody utilized all those empty seats.   At the very least, you could have spaced yourselves out a bit.   Herman Cain beat stage 4 cancer, but decided to risk it all for a Trump rally. Sad way to go.   Cover your face. Quit crying about it.
You’re lying. #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpIsNotWell #Trump #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #GOPTraitors #GOPCowards
As the wall goes up, illegal Crossings go down and so does the fvcking wall  This is proof that anything that Donald J Trump touches is destroyed
Hey Mikey Poo. Your azz will NOT be in Office as of November 3 ,2020 so suck sucking Trump's DlCK on twitter. we got it! you bend for a friend. Got it !  NOW #STFU and go BL0W your Mother Bear!
look in the eyes of a person and you see their soul. He has none (Like TRUMP) both have serious problems
DONALD TRUMP JR. SUCKS DlCK  JUST SAYING
Donald Trump- is/was NEVER needed in any celebration in  life of our great #RepJohnLewis
#dyingforTrump I think TRUMP is asymptomatic. A lot of lies and molecules spew from his mouth daily. A lot of people in his admin have contacted #TrumpIsTheVirus Why do these people obey their 'trump god' and not the GOD of the Universe who wants them to live. #TrumpIsNotWell
So, the Attorney General, and this Trump Administration, this Republican Congressman and Women, thus all who voted for them are irrelevant Mr. Nadler.....no sir, you are.
No offence anyone, making a trump/Hitler comparison. Sorry to hurt your feelings. I wish your wife well😇❤️
#dyingforTrump #EverythingTrumpTouchesDies #TrumpIsTheVirus #covididiots Trump will NEVER visit you if you get sick! #coronavirus #WearAMask  Why would ANYONE take pen anyone, that's not steralized? Why are Republicans scared to death over DT?  #TrumpNotWell
Fine by me. *trump sully's everything he touches.
And  said it is up to the DOJ. It's not. Don't let that little nugget get lost in the truckload of *trump bullshit we have to wade through day in and day out.
Res ipsa loquitur and what a deadly message indeed. trump should be court ordered to visit every grave beyond the 15 or so he predicted back in January when he called Covid a hoax.
*trump and class are two words that should never ever ever be used in the same sentence.
#HermanCain- Don't know much abt him, but condolences to his family. All those who appease Donald Trump's ego abt #mask and #Hydroxychloroquine, pay attention to scientific facts if you want to live.  &amp; others crowding around your 'TrumpGod' Put your family first.
Looks like we are not going to become a lawless nation after all. I think at this point, just about everyone has had enough of trump's and barr's attempts at circumventing the law. I have always believed that there are still good, decent people, who aren't part of trump nation.
Right but my point being if it eliminates Trump for now we can work on the rest later. Choices are so limited
Translation, we are just as ready to be rid of trump as the rest of the world.
Thare is just one case per state every six or seven years, on average of Mail-In voter fraud. We are talking about an occurrence that translates to about 0.00006 percent of total votes cast. Trump's just terrified because you can't cheat if there's a #PaperTrail
*trump doesn't joke. He has no sense of humor whatsoever.
The morning after the #Tulsarally Trump said he never jokes.
Trump wanting to postpone the election is an ACTUAL threat to democracy but people are too busy pretending that politics are about their team winning to rationalize that.
‘On the golf course — I gotta go’: Republicans wimp out after being confronted with Trump’s call to delay elections
Right . Trump can actually think for himself and not a puppet like Biden would be
Yes yes yes ... Trump is going to take over the country, just like you thought.
Trump is terrified . You are so right. He’s terrified of a rigged election!!! That’s what he’s terrified about!!!
Chuck your not telling the whole story again.. king trump just sent in his royal guard to kidnap people. #Cult45 #DementiaDon #ChuckLikesToKissTrumpsAss
Yeah Trump has the right ideas, but often doesn’t execute them properly. Again if Germany cares about NATO so much, why aren’t they meeting their contractual obligation? America pointing that out isn’t the US not being a good partner.

Pres Trump might not be correct. However the Bush team was a complete disaster, and we’re still paying for their errors. So I don’t listen any of their criticism.  The Obama team didn’t have any answers either. I think we need a rethink in the USA, not a return to Bush years

- you have nothing to offer! Read your cousin  Mary Trump's book. You just might learn some serious medical issues about your immediate family. You don't have time to worry about Hunter; he's most likely working an honest job!
Delay the election but send children back to school now. Got it. trump's statement is purely self-serving, ridiculous, and narcissistic. He wants more time to make his case to America. The 150,000 people that died because he denied Covid and failed to act would like more time.
Trump's DELAY - He will be dragged out of the WH 1/2021 His suggestion of delay Election 2020 tweet is for him to try and get the economy afoot &amp; a speedy vaccine. That Won't Work
Trump can take his #Fracking to Ma-A-Lago to dig for oil! People have died. Stop killing our #Environment US Geo Survey acknowledges drilling for oil&amp; fracking have caused earthquakes! (so why did SJU &amp; Haiti have earthquakes) Stay away fr poor people of color with your poison!
Would Mr. Trump want to delay the election if a democrat were in office?   I know he just loves to throw hand grenades in the room...so let’s use this as a rallying cry to make sure we have a well run and closely monitored voting process.
Trump tweeted about delay the election shortly after new data showed the economy shrank by a record one-third in the last quarter.   Pathetic and coward..!
July 30th, 2020, the day *trump went full dictator.
What are your thoughts on *trump going full 3rd world dictator this morning, preemptively talking about canceling November? Since you're my Senator, I'd really like a response. 🤔
President Trump has no say on when to hold the General Elections. For the preservation of our democracy, all members of Congress Republican or Democrat, Supreme Court Justices must make it clear the elections will occur in November.
They cannot help themselves.  It makes Trump look bad so it will be blasted across the headlines.  Had we let this virus run its course this would be done already.  But that would not fit the narrative that joe will save the day.
But Trump has voted by mail. Why is it good enough for him but not for everyone else?

Statement from the Press Secretary Regarding the Implementation of President Trump’s Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship
I’m not a leftist.  More a recovering right winger, but you cannot tell me that old chestnut holds water.  Trump has had over 3 years to fix stockpiles.  He was left with a comprehensive Pandemic Prep plan that he just ignored.  This is Trumps Mess. Let’s not wipe his ass. Again.
Terrible to have to blame the guys that have been gone over 3 years for all the wrong that Trump creates
This is what real leadership looks like. Real leaders make decisions not based on what's politically expedient but what's best for the populace as a whole. If we had this kind of leadership in Washington fewer families in this country would be in mourning. Trump failed the U.S.
Doctor admits the obvious. The U.S. was slow in recognizing the Covid threat from Europe. No kidding, sherlock. We had a president playing politics with one of the deadliest diseases to hit the world in 100 years. He said the dems made up Covid to hurt him. Trump failed the U.S.
Nothing to worry about here, consider the source. Barr is not credible. The trump administration is in the throw it against the wall and see what sticks phase. Clear sign of desperation. Don't give life to their desperation. Rise above the pettiness and speak to the issues.

Imagine being so unintelligent that you choose to believe Donald Trump’s medical advice over that of Dr Fauci.   Mind blowing.
Damn....look how oppressed they are....out in the street defying orders to stay home without consequence...barely anyone wearing a mask...give these protestors reparations... they are obviously suffering from slavery over 400 years ago. Trump 2020 baby. You won't be dancing then.
No they found the truth and they embraced it so much... they spread the word. Too bad for you, Trump will be back in office. If you ask nicely, maybe the hodgetwins will send you some tissues in November 😎🤙💯
Did I get it right me Barrrrrf... they should all be pressing this hard! He is a Trump pocket pal
He's wearing a *trump/Rambo tee-shirt.   That's all.

Kushner isn’t the only Trump insider getting paid off during the pandemic. Forty lobbyists with ties to Donald Trump have helped clients secure more than $10 billion in federal COVID aid. (4/6)
So whose side is Trump really on?  Well, here’s a clue: Tucked away on page 203 of the COVID stimulus package backed by Trump, is an obscure provision that delivers a whopping $135 billion in tax breaks to millionaire real estate developers and hedge fund managers. (1/6)

All the money in the world, don't bring you happiness. Look at TRUMP's family. Both are more concerned about making $$$$ MORE!
Do some research, HCQ is the preferred treatment for COVID world wide.  The US is only country where this drug has been politicized and attacked.  Why?  Because Trump liked it.  How many have the media killed through their jihad against this effective. TDS kills
I always used to begrudgingly say Trump is going to win big in November. Then COVID came and now this. I think we’re gonna see him lose by somewhere in the range of 15-20 million votes and the house and senate are going to have near super majorities.
With Trump - 150,000 dead.   I’ll take my “chances” with Biden.
Are you sending the same message to the RNC and Donald Trump?
Matt, now you know how President Trump is treated by the national press when they won't follow up with the "rest of the story" when it turns out he did the right thing
If further proof of trump's  mental illness was needed, here it is. Trump is surrounded by doctors daily, get this man some help. He thinks it might be ok to drink disinfectants, and now he's standing in support of Covid remedies coming from a group of quack docs. He needs help.

So you think the WHOLE world is in on this conspiracy to hurt trump at the polls ? Are you a #MagaMoron or a #PutinBot ?  Tip: If you get all your knowledge from #FauxNews then you are the first one
Ok people like you is why we have trump in the WH - ppl that said both Hillary and trump are bad choices - seriously you can’t choose the BETTER alternative ??
The thing is Trump has made this a black &amp; white issue - if you want to open up then you need to wear masks and respect the virologists knowledge - we could have opened if trump hadn’t denied science &amp; hoarded PPE #MAGAmoron
You are not saying that trump knows about the economy ? 🤣😂 the best part is that he is shooting himself in the foot - we could have opened if he would have promoted masks and aided with PPE &amp; proper protocols #MAGAmorons
Donald Trump begins rolling back DACA in defiance of the Supreme Court.  “Law and order,” he has said. lolololol

GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel: Enthusiasm For Trump Higher In 2020 Than It Was In 2016
You should have gotten it by now. This is Trump's America. This is what Trump has done to the United States of America. He has destroyed it. He has disgraced it. HE MUST BE VOTED OUT
It’s astounding that Trump is JUST NOW realizing that no one likes him.   Like watching all of GOT and during the finale saying, “they are dragons in this show?”
Truth? It's OK Trump snubbed Lewis. It's one of his only honest acts in office. Racism &amp; cowardice make Trump totally unfit to honor Lewis in any way. His forced, emotionless Teleprompter speech would've soiled the occasion. A giant needs no fake tributes from small, petty men.
Is that trump country?

Oh gummy trump you don’t want to do this trust me.. #Cult45 #DementiaDon
If President Trump and his administration are fascist, then she would have been silenced year ago.  Every time she speaks she proves Republicans are not fascist.
Voting for Trump, then glued to the MSM tears. Just like 4 years ago, only BIGGER!
Lol youre a 🤡. Have you seen your buddies on the left....check the burnt cities and liars in congress promoting the portests for political gain. Its ok though. Trump will be back for 4 more years in November. You liberals can get pissed all over again. Keep Twitter
This guy loves to criticize others while taking no responsibility for his own failures. Mccarthy was silent  back when trump called Covid a hoax, and has maintained that silence to present day. Mccarthy is a hypocrite. Get your own house in order before you start in on others.
Clueless!!  Trump asks why he doesn't have high approval on coronavirus efforts like Fauci
Can we for the moment not focus on what trump wants or what he likes. Let us with a laser like focus put the needs of the American worker first, period. Enough of this nonsense.   Trump does not support parts of Senate Republican coronavirus relief bill
Like Barr saying it depends on what kind of foreign help for *trump. Like that? Depends? That's a crime. You know. I know it, and I bet damn well Barr knows it too. But anything to cling to power. Right Linds?

Ok. I believe Trump mishandled it early on just like most of the world but when he did ban flights from China and later Europe he was called a xenophobe by Biden.... calling him a racist for trying to shut down incoming flights. A lot more should have been done... no doubt...
What a surprise, trump has told yet another lie. THE GREAT DECEIVER is deceived by his own deception. At this point, trump probably can no longer distinguish between light and darkness, nor good and evil.  He is reprobate.

Were you surprised by any of his responses? Me either.  That's the point. I shouldn't know what he's going to say before he says it. Ask me how I knew trump was going to drag out the (boogie man) now that he's down in the polls. They always do. Same stuff, different year.
... I’ve been supporting Biden since bernie endorsed him, glad you eventually came around, but it’s a little ridiculous that it took trump going full gestapo for KYLE to even consider voting for him...
Watched the whole hearing...no questions asked, no information gathered, Democrats wanted thei 5 minutes of fame....next time just send a cut out of the Trump official...
Explain! oops! You meant to say Donald Trump is straight up lying ALL HIS LIFE &amp; worst since he became POTUS
Bravo to these great gentlemen. If only we had a president who wasn't dillusional enough to believe that he is always the smartest person in the room. trump denied the existence of Covid-19 from day one. Next, he attacked science in an attempt to cover up his stupidity.
People do this because they know that we have a president, and republican senate that are simple-minded enough to believe what they see without a full investigation. trump is easily manipulated and with zero fact checking, will start spreading rumors about anything.
ANYONE but tRump 2020! This Republican will not be voting for Trump!
What is the Democrats plan by insinuating Trump will not leave office ifdefeated?  Multiple lawsuits when Biden loses?  They will be still contesting 2016 and the 2020 elections forever?
And *trump is trying to burn down Portland.
Let’s not forget Keith Schiller, Trump’s private body guard (Russian Pee tape) who was given an $185,000 “job” with the campaign years ago in return for his silence.

No thanks.  America doesn't need anything from a trump.
Good for him. He deserves every good thing that comes his way. He has been classy, and has maintained his professionalism in spite of the crass, vicious, and blame-shifting attacks leveled against him by trump and other senate republicans.
So how is your favorite African Dr.  doing? Will you be paying her more money today for more BS?  AFRICAN DOCTOR IN TEXAS WHO IS A TRUMP SUPPORTER. SIT ON THAT ONE!🤔
What, not again. Once again, good old Dr. trump is dispensing sound medical advice. It is exhausting trying to keep track of all the buffoonery that comes from this man. You think it's a new day and maybe, just maybe, he  learned from past mistakes. That would be a no.
So this has now confirmed that not only are the entire Trump Family are not playing with a full deck, but that they are scarred shitless.  POOR FVCKER.  Who feels sorry for these #SpermSpawns?  Be Nice Now!
Hey   YOU DO REALIZE THAT THIS IS ALL HAPPENING UNDER THE MORON'S WATCH, CORRECT?  YUP. ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING UNDER DONALD J. TRUMP'S WATCH.  YUP. YOU GOT IT!  IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THIS AND NO ONE ELSE!  PUT THAT IN YOUR FVCKING NEWS!
You should be ashamed of cheering trump's inept handling of the Covid crisis. If we had a conscientious leader, thousands of Americans would still be alive. Your failure to speak up while the Denier in Chief was mismanaging this crisis is the greater shame. You failed America.

Naw! Now I'm disappointed in you  This is stooping to Trump's level of nastiness. You're more adult than this.
Affordable short-term healthcare plans can flourish thanks to Trump
Please see specifically the method of counting, not validation.  Trump's dream is to suppress.  He has zero other recourse.  The media is trapping people.
You mean because Trump closed the border and stopped foreign flights while the left sat there and called him racist? Oh yeah.
Did anyone think Trump could delay the election? You know Trump was only thinking of himself.
And he sacrificed his life for Donald Trump's ego and vanity project. He attended Trump's Tulsa rally, didn't wear a mask or social distance and 9 days later he was in the hospital with COVID.
Hey guys, the economy contracted by 33% in the 2nd quarter. An unheard of number even in the worst economies in history. Trump's depends on the myth of "his good economy" holding up. So he flashes the shiniest object imaginable and the press and social media run with it all day.
And after all that Donald Trump was still able to kill him
I almost forgot about those liability waivers Trump had people sign for his COVID rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Hey  I've heard Joe Biden being referred to as a "puppet" many times. Maybe your father should consider changing his nickname from "Sleepy Joe" to "Puppet Joe". God bless the Trump Train!!

Of course, the Criminal In Chief. Gave all the desperately need funds. To contributors, to Trump Campaign. Now, the states are fending for themselves. Hospital's, have no PPE's, or ventilators. Test sites, are far &amp; in between. Results take two weeks. Business is non existent.
Glad to see Trump didn't attend that over hyped talent show for Lewis today.  If you don't like someone when they are alive... don't be a douche bag and pretend you like them when they are dead. #JohnLewisMemorial
Here is the question. How many are going to die,before a higher authority.Steps in, to stop the out of control pandemic.Can we say,a cool million.Trump is a blatant racist, &amp; divider.He has helped the Corrupt Republicans. Give massive tax cuts, to the wealthy.85%stimulus to Banks
No, there's more.
McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff Trump suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election - The Washington Post. He’s a clear and present danger to our democracy. Remove him!
I hope when trump chokes down his final bucket of KFC, they spare the real military from carrying his casket and use the Space Force instead.
I respect your decision, not only because I agree 100% with you, but is the only good choice we have. Don’t need to look behind anywhere, it’s very clear! We got this, go Trump 2020

Trump floats November election delay, but it won't happen
Mailing ballots are not a problem.  Look, we get our passports by mail, government checks by mail, drivers licenses by mail.  Mailing ballots only became an issue because Trump decided to make it one.
You support and encourage the monster Trump.

Must be watch TV and tweet time on the Presidents schedule. All the other living past presidents will be honoring a man at his funeral. Trump must be beside himself!
maybe someone can find out how all those grinning fools are doing today.   What was the actual human cost of Trump’s pathetic need for adulation which failed so spectacularly?  #HermanCain #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
The science has been all over the place.  Is Trump a scientist or do you think he listens to the scientists around him?  Your TDS makes you stupid.
The GOP is garbage and they will be tossed out in record fashion come November.   1400 dead yesterday  Q2 GDP - 32.9% 1,400,000 NEW UI Claims  Trump and the GOP have failed Americans every step of the way and now it’s inescapable.   #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #AreYouBetterOff
have those people sitting with him been felled? what a mess - trump is killing his own people as well as the rest of us
Thank you for proving again that he didn't call the virus a hoax.  February 28th we had no idea about this virus.  Pelosi was telling people to go to China Town.  Cuomo was telling people to go to the movies.  Trump was implementing travel bans.  Wake up.
Hope it’s true 😎..it would give Trump the election in November on a silver platter..👏👏👏👏🇺🇸😎
Stupid tricks get stupid prizes.  People do dumb shit all the time.  Can't blame Trump for people's stupidity.
The Trump virus has 150,000 US deaths
This claim has been thoroughly debunked, yet TDS idiots like you keep pushing it. Trump referred to the Dems politicking on the virus as a hoax, not the virus itself.
98% of our representatives including you Trump are an EMBARRASSMENT!!
And now he's dead. His Twitter feed is an endless nasty rant against Democrats. He was a nasty partisan, probably self (Black)-loathing, and he paid dearly for his sycophancy to Trump. Who's using Black people, Mr. Cain? A favorite theme of his to attack Dems. #HermanCain #karma
This congress will never allow an extension of a Trump presidency
Lol, anyone that agrees with Trump is a white supremacist? Let us also remember that Democrat cities are the ones being mismanaged - so much so that they let their own cities get burned to the ground. Sad that democrats have become what they are today!
So very very sad to hear about the death of  😭😭😭 My condolences to his family. He was a great man and a great voice for Donald Trump  and conservatives.
Do you realize that Herman was a grown man capable of making his own decisions?  President Trump didn't ban mask wearing.  Do you people need government to tell you what to do every step of the way in your life or are you capable of making your own decisions?
You people just waking up need to do your research. The only reason this is even being brought to light is because Trump is President. And by the way, Obama covered this up to protect himself and Killary
Trump won’t go near his funeral. He would  not want to be associated with any reflection or reminder of his incompetence.  Next he’ll say, “ I hardly knew the guy”.

Then your tweet makes no sense to me then I guess.  Trump only voters cost us the house and damn near cost us the Senate.  These Walk Away people are going to ruin what we have a chance of rescuing with their liberal policies.  Be vigilant.  It matters.

Shit like this is why you hear Trump distracting with racist tweets and lies about absentee ballots
The big lie is anyone in aAmerica can get a test. Not true!!! Also test results can take 7 to 10 days to get results which is useless. Stop lying and exaggerating. Not hard to see why Trump hired you, a Trump lackey.
Anyone notice that the number of cases started dropping almost immediately after the Trump Administration started requiring the COVID numbers be reported to them and not the CDC?
Trump's reasons, will be made public some day. That's why the Criminal In Chief, is fighting so hard.Not to have his accounting firms,or business tax documents released. Then you will see decades, of money laundering, insurance fraud,&amp;filing false tax returns.Russian backed loans

That's an outright lie. There was never any proof that Trump, or his father, denied applicants based on race. There's hearsay on both sides of the issue and ultimately they made Trump put up some signs in black neighborhoods to advertise.
I am confused...I admit it...oh not about trump or even covid...figured those out...bada-bing...bada-boom.. nope...what confuses me is - how many kitchens does Steve Schmidt have?
