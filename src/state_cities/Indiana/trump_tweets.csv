Trump buddy of course. 👍🏼
I haven’t seen this much undermining since the Trump administration.
Every time I hear Trump’s voice now with no video, I see  in my mind
A wash:
I'm not going to lose sleep over some never-Trump Republican speaking for 10 minutes at the Democratic National Convention.  However, it is just plain asinine to even question having  literally one of the most-known people in the country, speak.
Nah, just 40 or so....
At least we have our freedom for now. Trump is the best thing that ever happened to America. I’ve been around for a while. I’ve never seen the Democrats be this evil and screening over the American people.
I feel like we are still just scratching the surface of deranged Trump. This shit show is just revving up. Buckle up world, it's gonna get really cray the closer we get to November. We'll yearn for these simpler times. 😔
The Dark Age of tRump
And the Republican Party has been taken over by a right wing fanatic named Trump! Oh and how many Americans have died because of an incompetant Trump? Try 158,000 and counting. Shame on you and your fake Prolife stance.
Wrap your head around this, Katie Blair.  He's a "Trump Puppet"!
Don’t feel the need for a come back on an opinion of mine. I guess that’s just the diffrence between us.   Lots of people only can be badass through social media.   I don’t need to be one of those.  Have a great day all.  Trump 2020.
For people who are saying that Kanye West will cause Donald Trump to be re-elected, perhaps the Democratic Party should have put up a stronger candidate than Joe Biden, or Biden could do more to appeal to voters.
Keep spreading the truth
Someone grab Trump, and prove he can do more push ups.
😂   When Trump wins again, show me video of you screaming crying about it.
I want someone to give me the "fuck me eyes" like pence does with Trump.
It’s gorgeous! Definitely worth the trip. This time, we’re on Carova Beach, northern part of the Outer Banks. But wow. Apparently it’s a requirement to fly Trump &amp; white supremacy flags once you park on the beach. Ew.
The Little Sisters of the Poor were handed a HUGE win at the Supreme Court in the continued fight for religious freedom. Life &amp; protection of rights are our Constitutional &amp; fundamental rights as Americans, &amp; they must continue to be protected.
Yea right, especially when Trump is complimentary to Ms. Maxwell who is a trafficker!

“Despite painful drops in revenue, small business owners are remarkably optimistic about the future, with more than half expecting they will return to pre-pandemic levels of profitability in the second half of the year.”
How ridiculous is this? Trump has backed Putin to the moon and back!
Not true! You know Biden is Scared to debate Trump right!?? FACT‼️
Does Dipshit Trump  Really think he can  change the voting  date November 3   Only because he’s  falling in polls not  Because of covid  Either ! CAUSE  HE NEVER CARED  HIS SLOW RESPONSE  MANY PEOPLE DIED  UNDER HIS WATCH 😢
So add 5% to Trump and there you got it.
Please state what freedoms Trump has taken away.  He has done more things for black minorities, gays, etc than amy other president.  The only freedoms he's taking away is from the rich elite and pedophiles
We worked with the French to win our freedom. With the fucking Soviets to beat back fascism. We can work with Trump-hating Republicans.
Wow your as delusional as the left and you blame Trump keep your warped opinions in Canada
Why do you hate Donald Trump
Trump leads this country and will continue to lead this great Nation in the pursuit of greatness
Oh he’s a chip off the old Trump block then.
Thanks President TRUMP 💖🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Except Trump is a leader. Takes no pay. Securing the boarder.  Low taxation.  Confronts China. Makes NATO pay. So many other things that help not hurt the country.  Biden Obama just the opposite.  They and family getting filthy Rich.
Oh yes. They DO vote! Amish turned out in record numbers to vote Trump in and you can bet they'll do it again! For the record, most of my family is Amish. 😁🇺🇸
Get people back to work! Stop hindering the President ! Stop with the hate for trump supporters!
if Trump bans tiktok he will lose the entire vote of all 18-30 year olds, no questions asked.
So, how many socialists did Donald Trump create by banning TikTok?  #TikTokBan
Chris Wallace challenges Biden to follow Trump on 'Fox News Sunday,' says ex-VP must 'get into game shape'
Hardly any people there Mr. Trump. Not many showed! Obama always drew a bigger crowd since you are running against him. LOL
Trump knows he will never ever be loved, honored and respected as Obama! He doesn’t even come close.
If one claims to be Prolife, one will do whatever it takes to preserve and protect human life and not follow the lead of an evil President! This governor will go down in flames with Trump at the cost of many human lives!
I’ll be voting! For Trump 😁
Donald Trump also donated to the Clinton foundation, but we're not gonna talk about that right.
There are 96 days to the election. This is the equivalent to the Trump campaign pulling the fire alarm.
I'm no Trump, but happy birthday!
I voted for President Trump the first time and I WILL VITE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AGAIN  and so will most of our great American people
Teachers and retired teachers and educators at all levels must vote Trump out so we can get rid of DeVos. Another major problem. Lots of voters in that group.
He’s another loyal to Trump like DeSantis.
At Noon on January 20, 2021, Joe Biden officially becomes President, regardless of what Trump claims.  It just becomes a matter of getting him out of The White House.
Do you not care that Trump is trying to undermine the election? Is his approval of you more important than the integrity of our election system? Or do you just not care? You swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. If you are not willing to do your job then please step aside.
Another sign of a weakened campaign. Trumps retreating to Texas, he's lost the strategic initiative in the campaign, and is reduced to reacting to poor polling numbers. The Trump campaign is seemingly in full retreat. A welcome sign.
Indiana for Trump
Do we have to wait seven years for you to ask about Putin's bounties on our troops? You are too afraid of getting a mean tweet from Trump. Stand up for our troops or let someone else take charge.
I think Trump should tell his people to vote after the 3rd!  Or, delay the election until next Summer:  20th Amendment, Section 1. The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January....  Welcome President Pelosi!!!!!
I don't know if replacing him with Pence helps any. Pence has absolutely no charisma, and Trump would have a serious amount of voters that would be so infuriated at the replacement that they just wouldn't vote.
Is this real?
Over the past 20 years there’s been .00006% cases of fraud in all mail-in ballots cast in presidential elections. Trump wants to delay the election because he knows he has a .00006% chance of winning.  Quit enabling him, Liz! Btw, do you mail in your ballot? I do.
You complete fool! You don’t even have the courage to say what this man died of, Covid. Trump, you have his blood on your hands all over your ego, dishonesty and inability to lead. Shame on you because all who have died as a result of your ineptitude and lack of empathy.
Trump is probably thrilled about Cain, because it knocks the GDP story down the page.
Do you hear this    ? Are you going to stay silent while Trump stirs up chaos, or will you defend the Constitution like you promised? Speak up or go home and let a real leader take charge.
Yes they do
You post this crap like Donald Trump has anything to do with your lazy ass mistakes you make. Your decisions to be a hater!Patriots please pray for President Donald Trump in his time of need
you might want to focus on this. Apparently Trump said the quite part out loud once more.
Actually that is the days of home alone and Donald Trump as well as him cavorting with Epstein and underage girls.  So no, you'd have to go back further.
I swear that trump is setting up an insanity plea when he finally gets called into court for his criminal actions.
Election year, and the liberals are on edge even worse, I can see how Pro Trump tweets might get pulled. It's bullshit but I can see that being why
I don't see why Trump hasn't passed a law making it illegal for COVID to infect people.. I can see it now  "Hello 911 I think my wife is sick with Corona" "Sir it is illegal for COVID to infect people, it can't do that."
Astonishing bias by Fox.   Headline is that Trump will make insurance cover preexisting conditions.   Above “read more” is quote from Trump about how unprecedented this is.   If you click that, you see it’s already covered and Trump has tried to undo it...
I can't believe people are stupid enough to still be supporting Trump. He's been a corrupt asshole his whole life. It has been very public the entire time. Idgits.

Y’all I can not rn😂😂 it would be a Trump supporter saying that him losing by over 2 million votes in 2016 is fake news when it’s public record😭😭😭 they really show their education for politics is lower each day
I fully expect these last few months to be a flurry of attempts to fulfill campaign promises to his base and in general upset as many apple carts as possible on his way out. Who better to undo the damage than one of the men who left Trump a well oiled machine of government?
What do you think Trump will attack and blame in his presser in a few moments?
Yup, that's exactly why Trump is doing this today.
And notice how the IC is naming names. That's how close we are to the end of Trump.
I KNEW IT WAS ABOUT TRUMP! I KNEW IT!
Good job, guys.
Dude, you are a fan of Trump. You don't get to talk about anyone else's mental decline.
Writing in Kanye, doesn't matter what I do in Indiana, the state's going to Trump
Biden is using “Build Back Better” as his slogan. I’ve never seen a less inspired campaign. But at this point Trump seems completely disengaged from the election.

"Trump Swings Against TikTok, WeChat" by BY SHIRA OVIDE via NYT New York Times
This is Trump holding an entire nation hostage until they do him a favor by re-electing him.
Debates are for people who divulge all of their taxes.
I will say that video seemed very standard-Trump. The accusation is absolutely troubling, and the way plenty of people will defend even more so, but watching it I don't see how anyone who already supported him is going to be particularly shaken.
Yup. Remember when Trump said, "When I lose, I doubt you'll never see me again."?
I'm from Indiana. If (when) tRump loses...do we have to take Pence back?
Racist policies + racist words = racist person aka Biden. Half of America either doesn't see it or ignores it because "at least your not Trump," although your rhetoric is much more racist than anything Trump has said.
America population 325 million. South Korea population 51 million. Almost 7 times more people here. Americans dead from COVID 160000. South Koreans dead from Covid 3000. More than 50 times more dead here. Trump “it is what it is”,”democratic hoax” “gone by Easter”Trump failed us
Oh shut the fuck up. This has nothing to do with Hollywood. All manner of businesspeople have kowtowed to China in recent decades to make money, including Trump. There's plenty shade to go around. This is just another grab for book sales. Do you ever write anything useful?

How many politicians will start saying they are positive or have been exposed to #COVID19 to avoid a meeting and their photo taken with Trump rather than openly saying don’t come to my state and hold a rally 🤷🏻‍♂️ 😂  #coronavirus
The NYAG will get to Trump and the NRA first before the FBI does.  The RICO lawsuit she filed was forfeiture of the NRA. And this is state, not federal - which means Barr won't be able to intervene.
Yeah..... That's not gonna happen. I learned a long time ago that truth and history to a conservative is whatever they're saying right now. History and facts don't matter. If a dem did what trump does, they'd sing a whole different tune.
I don't care who the VP will be. We got to get Trump out! #Biden2020
Yes, Trump has been.
Trump is throwing EVERY distraction he can.
Trump has tweeted/retweeted 13 times this morning attacking the FBI investigation (Crossfire Hurricane), U.S. election system, China, TikTok, and Joe Biden.
If Trump bans Fortnite and League of Legends, that would make one of the best presidents of all time. I'm not happy about it, but it's true.
Let's say you are right. He uses speechwriters and approves what they say. He employs a team. That is exactly the behavior we need in a president. Trump clearly does not.
Trump great speech at the Whirlpool plant
As a Christian, I hope trump will win. He’s not the best the republicans have to offer, but he’s leaps and bounds better than Biden.
Wonder if Trump knows he misspelled children. Wonder if he did it on purpose.
So we’re comparing a serial killer and someone who just thinks Trump is a bad person? I guess you could actually say that Trump has killed many more people than Dahmer
Do you have any kids little trump? Hopefully not.
Base will not be a problem for the GOP this election. I just don't know if there's enough of a middle to swing the election to Trump.
Donald Trump talking to Doperah Windbag about it be ever decided to run for President. His message never changed from then to now.

Trump making an executive order banning TikTok is so wildly unconstitutional Im going to scream
You actually might like it...you can continue to be the Coronabro you are, hate freedom and life, and bash Trump again for another 4 years
Yeah, bragging about being blocked like this tells me pretty much everything I need to know about a person. Edgy rudeness isn't cool or funny  Unless you're bragging about being blocked by Trump or JKR or something, in which case go for it
According to this detailed report, Facebook is violating its own policies on misinformation for political or financial motives, and firing employees that flag their conservative bias.   via
Reading many of the rightists who openly lambast Trump but remain committed to the right, I get a sense of a pledge that is slowly waning; slipping away in the face of what they grudgingly recognize as an obviously greater threat.

It would be a hell of an irony if Trump was ultimately defeated in a beauty pageant format.
Barr tried to drop criminal charges against Trump by interviewing prosecutors from the SDNY, but they ignored him and resisted.  I see many obstruction of justice charges coming for him, including perjury and espionage.
No it won't, to even pretend to believe that is fucking insane, let alone thinking Trump didn't cause this by sticking his thumbs up his ass and making up facts that got people killed.
Yeah, that's what caused the pandemic. I guess February though May never happened, it was all just a dream! Trump was right all along, it'll get to 15 cases and just disappear like a dream!
Trump voters should definitely spend 11/3 waiting in line for that vaccine that totally exists
When Trump resigns, be prepared for ANYTHING!
imagine thinking that voting for trump is a godly act. holding trump up next to God himself...and thinking there are any overlapping ideals or sentiments. I just wish more christians sat down with their own humanity and humility, and explained that choice to God earnestly
Here's the kicker: the right is actually going through the same civil war. And it's not just because of Trump (though he's obviously a catalyst). The dismissal of rightists as fundamentalist racists who think like a monolith is what curbs cogent criticism of them.

Literal LOL  Stop repeating quotes without giving proper context  Without evidence, Trump says coronavirus vaccine possible around Election Day which would be 6-12 months sooner than previously stated by top infectious disease experts
Much as they try Trump, Pence and company cannot control the narrative on this administration's incompetence and irresponsibility. #TrumpHasNoPlan
If Trump is to blame for everything else, logically he's to blame for that too. Kind of like God.
Hillary, of all people, you should not be worried about trump taking time for himself and playing golf during this madness. You should be focusing on what you’re life is going to look like in prison with your husband.
1. Obama didn’t do anything illegal  2. They looked into trump because of his alleged ties to Russia  3. Trump 3 years later was accused of giving prioritized treatment to foreign dictators for political gain (the exact thing the Obama administration was worried about)
Do you think the NYAG announcement is related to Trump?
There will be no RNC/GOP when Trump is removed. It will be RICO'd and mass asset forfeiture/seizure will occur.
She knows Trump won't be on the ballot.
Living in a state that is lead by a Trump supporter that blindly follows his lead feels like a death sentence  I wish you would follow science and not a lunatic. Your job is to protect your people. You’ve failed
Trump is already rage-tweeting today.
Trump or the NRA.
It's either the NRA or Trump.
This is a joint investigation, so Cyrus Vance Jr. will be in the press conference. I think it's Trump, not the NRA. The NRA hasn't been cooperating with them.
No way it's going to be about the NRA. They haven't been cooperating with their investigation.  State AGs only do national announcements if it targets an entity and/or a national figure (e.g. Trump).  This has nothing to do with the NRA. These are just speculations.
Let me clarify why I feel this way. Let me preface by saying, in no way is trump the best president, not even close. I still support him but he could be better. My problem is, as a Christian, i Don’t know where I’d be headed if Biden was president. I highly doubt he would
It looks like these two men Barry and Big Mike of the Fairy family  are supporting Trump now. Proof Trumps not racist or homophobic 😄👍
Ben, honest question, do you think Trump will win? Because every day I think about the ramifications of Biden winning, and it scares. It legitimately scares me, and I have to distract myself from reality to become calm again.
fuck trump and fuck everyone who voted for him
Because Trump is a true leader, Biden can't lead because he never knows where he is

Just sent some dude from Scarlet Crusade into a frothing rage when I asked him to explain his stance on why Trump isn't racist.  Funny thing about political trolls is they're used to making us play defense. Put them on defense and they have nothing to stand on.

Hey Jim, tell us the story about President Trump colluding with Russia again!!!!!  I know you have talked about it for 3.5 years now, but it just keeps getting better every time you tell it!
Trump!
Do you really think that trump cares he is an asshole? He plays on people's fears and then points to a bad guy and says go get him. His equally ignorant fanbase don't care either.
The age of Trump.
I’m watching “The Swamp” on HBO. It’s about the drain the swamp-stance Donald Trump promoted.   It’s follows several Republicans who really believe in this philosophy, including Rep. Matt Gaetz.   I met Gaetz and his press secretary. They believe and live by this mantra.
I never really found myself politically speaking until Donald Trump was elected President. Then things became crystal clear. I stand for everything that he does not with 100% clarity. #FlushTheTurdNov3rd
We got that from Trump and we got Biden asking a African American reporter if he is on cocaine.  Nice country.
Useless. All it will take is one crazy-ass tweet from trump and the entire media will run that way.
PA folks should be talking about this. Trump’s new EO on federal hiring could be devastating for MPA’s and PhDs who, in the past, have automatically qualified for GS9 and GS11, respectively. How many will enter grad school if those qualifications are removed?
Trump will win mostly due to pandemic-aided voter suppression and because the trump-loving racists that will come out in droves. Biden will screw up the VP pick from the looks of it and once again we will snatch defeat from jaws of victory.
Trolling Trump!
Trump's awful, but that tweet screencap is obviously faked.

In this case, I think doctor should be in quotes, like Trump's "doctor" who was spouting all kinds of weird crap.
Trump won't make it when Volume 5 comes out. It's going to expose a lot of people, especially Dems.
Hi! So most presidents donate their salaries:   Additionally unemployment was on a 6-year downward trend before Trump even took office:   And on drug prices, experts say it’s mostly talk, no substance:
Is this even real? How can you be a trump sympathizer? He manipulates information to make himself look good. That kind of deceit should have you questioning your government but you will blindly follow this man because “he helps the economy” as if that is all that matters.

So dismayed to see  of the PBS  being needlessly attacked by  over the details of the HEROES Act. Woodruff was just trying to ask a few clarifying questions, but Pelosi took them as personal attacks. It felt more like something Trump would do.
You’re making it up as you go along. Bush worked with Lewis on a number of initiatives, including the re-authorization of the Voting Rights Act. One of the salutary features of the American system—until Trump—has been not to demonize people with whom we disagree. Not a bad lesson
I’m mostly surprised that the White House agreed to Trump being interviewed one on one, armed only with colored rectangles.
If you run into a smartass by the name of, Joe Biden will end racism, handle  their on our side. They have a pro Trump page. I will admit the fucker had me going, and I think it hilarious. 👍👍   that was great 😆👍

Heard the Democrats want to bring back William Barr and blame him and the Trump administration for this blast to distract from his covid 19 response.
Agree w/ Nicholas. Only the very recent &amp; overt defectors have condemned the right as a whole. Exceedingly rare to see any of that before Trumpism. While there were always conflicts on the right, none of them created tangible division like Trump has.
No way trump would allow himself to look this awful on purpose, 0% chance it’s staged IMO. I think he just got outclassed by the interviewer

I wonder if some of his staff have decided to let him hang himself in these interviews, or possibly there's no one left in the WH smart enough to realize it's a bad idea. Whatever the reasons, these interviews are stand alone campaign ads against Trump. I love to hate them.
He keeps trying to pivot away from the Russia line of questioning and switch to more China rhetoric. Swan does an impeccable job here holding the course while Trump flounders.
Best endorsement for Trump yet. You know you're the best when your senile opponent is promoting you. 😆
⁦ ⁦ ⁦ Where is your indignation? All of you were aghast at Obama’s use of Executive Orders, yet you remain silent while this cretin tears apart our republic? Pray for your souls.
And we thank you for Jonathan Swan, which is the best interview of Trump ever done. Trump is so stupid, out of touch, and a total embarrassment. Dear God help us!
I ask myself that everyday too. How is someone not in jail!!  Trumpy Bear, Trump Jr, Ivanka, Jim Jordan, Barr. Whew...to damned many to list....
The WH occupant: “Again, nobody has done more for Black Americans than I have,” he said.   That quote in comparison to a picture of John Lewis makes him look smaller than a speck of dust.   Real heroes &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Idiot fascists.

Trump is so stupid, he doesn’t know he is stupid. And that my friends is the fault of the republican sycophants in his administration and congress. The could have delivered us from this nightmare but they didn’t. Vote everyone of them out November 3!
They really gave Trump a second grade ISTEP example bar graph to hold up.
44 is ~90% of 49. So if 49% of likely voters choose trump, 90% of likely trump voters choose graham.
Trump removal from office
Our press corp must be the most pathetic in the entire world. It's August 2020! Trump has been in office for almost 4 years!
As soon as Trump is forced to resign, the whole RNC will be indicted too.
You know here Trump’s tan doesn’t look as ridiculous. Maybe he does deserve to be president. Everything else content-wise here is dumb
Hard to trust someone whos been covering Trump for 4 years and hasnt been able to convey he has no idea what hes doing. Even this tweet is trying to make him statesman-like
Trump borrowed from the Chinese playbook by banning tiktok.
No... he does not!! More Trump fake news
Bull! No one believes you anymore. And that mandatory photo of trump fed building are  forced to mount, will soon be in a dump somewhere.
Trump's greatest hits. I think I need to go scrub my eyeballs now.
Fantastic thread. Given Trump’s significant allergy to intl law, LOAC, &amp; war crimes convictions, any sense of residual impact w/in DoD or services as result of CinC pressure/wishes (even at margins)? Deemphasis of LOAC (by some) b/c of CinC views? Similar dynamics to civ-mil rel.
isn't trump a sexual predator or am i missing something
Yes Donald J Trump 4 More Years Make America Great Again!! #WWG1WGA
I think it quite possible he would end up pulling as many voters from Trump as Biden.
Look up Trump’s plan. Cost cuts affect future retirees...but that’s supposed to hurt the election? It’s a proposal for the next FY...but that’s supposed to hurt the election? USPS can’t compete with private industry and has fallen behind. Not Trump’s fault.
The Trump administration is cutting short the 2020 census by a month. 😣  What should we be doing to challenge this? The damage to democratic representation, as well as the harm to social science, will be immense.

No. This is part of the FBI investigation into Trump.

Navarro is being extraordinarily disingenuous but I'm not sure I'm more upset at him for that or for Sciutto asking Trump's trade advisor about his medical expertise
A highschool friend went off the deep end when Bernie lost the primary. Went on about conspiracies and talking about how the system needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. I agree with them but stated our goal is to defeat Trump, not fix the broken car, just push it to victory.
Yuck. She's about as deep in Russian pockets as Trump, at least she spreads the conspiracy theories. Even Hawaiians are turning away from her and she's one of their own.

I seriously think this is more of a tall tale, a creation myth of you will. It has all the hallmarks of one. After all, we all know none of the Trump kids make anything. They destroy and claim something as their, but they never make anything - it's too much like work.

I believe these Lincoln Project types will not be able to reintegrate with a Republican party infected with racism, homophobia and xenophobia. I personally welcome them to the fold and hope they stay. We need broad inclusion to keep the Trump base in check.
On September 17, 2020 Trump will be reaching for a stack of bibles.  #WhiteHouseSiege
It’s interesting that Facebook announced they were going to make a TikTok clone and then Trump says he’s going to shut down TikTok. 🤔🤔🤔
Why can’t we get Trump, his children, and their spouses to do this?
Now do Trump!
I realize kids, in a sense should stay out of this, but this is about the decisions of the parents (Trump, Ivanka). If it’s not OK for their kids, why is it OK for yours? Imagine if Obama did this.
Anyone surprised that the Manhattan DA is investigating Trump Org. for bank, tax, and insurance fraud?
Postponing the 2020 election would require a congressional vote, but many GOP leaders — including Gov. Eric Holcomb — oppose the delay.

One of the best things about the Trump years is showing how utterly useless "fact checking" sites like PolitiFact are. Enjoy your plummet to obscurity!
what blows my mind is that the same people who call me a chinese genocide denier say trump is the worst president beacuse he's starting a new and unnecessary cold war with china
He already lost in SCOTUS.
For someone who has personally engaged the Covid/Trump virus, you sure didn’t learn much.
Trump campaign better be working on secondary election campaign strategies/ads against Michelle Obama and Hillary. Just my gut feeling.
The only reason Trump hates dogs is because no self respecting canine would have him. #TrumpIsNotWellDear Diary, Trump talked about me.
President Trump is working on an Executive Order to order something already existing under #ACA #Obamacare which the DOJ is working to potentially undermine in court. Fixed it for you Bloomberg.
Vote for tRump, get DeVos. Shameful. She’s a mess. She’s been against public education almost her whole adult life.
A presidents' approval rating being low is not the same as wishing for a puppet government of the United States or a military coup.  I hate Trump. I would still be horrified if he were assassinated by a foreign government and a leader were to be installed by that government.
Peter, Did he suspend student loan payments?  If so, that seems like a good thing.   And, if so, that doesn’t seem like a difficult concept.  I don’t support Trump. But with so much negativity right now, why bash a good thing over semantics?
If I don’t vote for Biden, then I’m voting for Trump. But if I don’t vote for Trump, then I’m voting for Biden. So, since that cancels out, I get to participate in democracy the way I’d like to by voting for the candidate whose values match mine. Sounds about right to me.
Fear Mongering 101, Professor Trump lecturing!

I believe that President Trump has stayed alive because he has his own personally paid security detail, not the secret service! He has the money, loyalty &amp; smarts to avoid "Government Protection"!  The Praetorian Guard took out many a Roman Emperor!  God protect our president!
No trump supporter is getting your very accurate information Robert! I mean we all wish, but they are getting 3rd hand info from the covidiots and or Fox News, etc. We can't penetrate their narrative and beliefs!
E-Mac I think that it's sad what has become of Joe Biden. Someone should step in and end this and let him retire in peace. I'm a Trump supporter and think he will beat Biden but he should not be running.
Yes.  Trump has huge scandals and isn’t taking COVID seriously.  At least I’m certain Biden would do a better job at risk mitigation of COVID, with better national strategy.  COVID is my biggest issue now.
Get something straight before I block you: Donald Trump is NOT my messiah.    Grow up.
I guess Trump's Country Club members got their money's worth tonight!
You do realize that a trademark is different from a patent, right?    There’s nothing strange about registering a trademark for a business, and because of term limits - why WOULDN’T it make sense for any member of the Trump family to make/sell voting machines in a few years?
My personal opinion is that Trump is a piece of shit, and that everyone that supports him owns apart of that.
shut up lmao
Btw I can see trump’s cult members doing the same thing if he told them to!
Sadly there is a large group of people in our country getting a totally different narrative then what we are getting regarding trump. They have been spoon fed a magnitude of lies and have no clue he is this evil. We need to get to them somehow before it's too late!! But how?
same thing here .. been following for about 6 mos but was removed... it’s probably my trump 2020 profile pic
You need to watch “Frances and Friends” on Sonlife broadcasting.  They are worshipping at the alter of tRump.  Anyone that doesn’t vote for the orange pumpkin is called ignorant and a sinner.
Supporting Donald Trump at the dirt mall is the best metaphor I didn't have to think of.
Will there be even a single day before we hear about 'Trump and his lackeys FORCING the schools to close!'?
Pacers without Nate McMillan have a much higher ceiling, but also a much lower floor.  Have a feeling, for Simon, high floor will always trump low floor when it comes to bottom-line revenue governance.
Trump is a poor man’s idea of a rich man.   A weak man’s idea of a strong man.   And a dumb man’s idea of a smart man.
No one knows for sure how this is going to effect the voting.  Republicans think it will siphon minority and/or young votes from Biden.  There are just as likely discouraged R voters who don't like Trump, but won't vote for a Dem.
Can you imagine! They must be a uglier than trump and that's saying a lot!

To paraphrase MLK, Trump wants socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor.
LOL I live in Indiana the land of Mike Pence 😂 I didn’t realize the most conservative state in the rust belt was a communist state. Trump is rather popular here, I probably wouldn’t call his supporters commie’s. That’s not very nice now.
When you make a mistake, own it move on.  Conjuring up insane justifications is simply pathetic!!  If you truly believe what you are stating, then explain why Trump corrected himself seconds later.
Trump loves misprouncing words so people focus on him being extremely dumb and not a fucking awful human being
Had Trump said these things, the replies would be outrage. Instead the left just yawns or just says who cares. The hypocrisy is such a joke. Why don’t they condemn this form of racism?
Biden clearly thinks blacks can’t make that decision. “You ain’t black.” And “Blacks aren’t diverse.” Meanwhile President Trump has made black lives better with lowest black unemployment, criminal reform and freedom and opportunity for ALL races. #Trump2020Landslide
Ofcourse, we’re better than most of the politicians we elect. I really wish y’all would have chosen a better candidate. Somebody like Beto or even Sanders would have prompted me to consider a Democratic nominee, but I just can’t get with what is essentially a Dem. Trump.
It’s not an imaginary scenario. It’s an educated assumption. If you’re not willing to admit this is how most Biden endorsers operate, than you’re just as unable to admit when you’re wrong as trump is. Have a great day
Trump is Hitler
You’re so gullable and ignorant, that you’ll accept and apology from a candidate who has made comments similar to this multiple times. When trump makes questionable comments, you would not accept and apology regardless, so don’t even act like the apology matters.
Y’all are too far gone at this point. If this were trump, you would of been irate and no apology would matter to you. The fact you don’t recognize your own hypocrisy is beyond me. You can’t pick and choose the bigotry you tolerate, that’s not how it works.
Yes, but if this was trump you would be throwing a fit. How are y’all not noticing how much Biden exposes your hypocrisy😭
Please educate President Trump on the teachings of Jesus!
Biden can choose my oldest most battered garden gnome and it will possess more drive and intellectual agility than Trump's entire cabinet. And he'll have my vote regardless.
Where Do Republicans Go From Here?
Eeeeek #Mutts4Mike 🐾 has many concerns about the crime bill. It’s 2020 and we are WAY behind in criminal justice reform. The #Puppers would encourage you check out the First Step Act Bill that was signed into law last yr by Trump regarding federal prisons and compare it to this
Yes! I will be nearly 70 come Election Day but I will suit up, mask up and do whatever to make sure Trump presidency is no more!
Eww Meghan. It does mean that in this time. Stop hating Trump because you’re  bitter. His policies are GOOD for the country.
when i was getting takin away in the ambulance the emt asked me questions to see if i was with it and he said “do you know who the president of the US is?” I said, “Unfortunately that would be Trump.” lmfao he said “okay i’ll take that.”
We’re living under a Trump presidency. There’s a lot we’ve experienced. 😬
What if ‘leaders’ like Jesse Jakson, Al Sharpton or Obama talked to them about looting and rioting? President Trump can say all he wants but these bigots denounce him and keep African Americans in the Democrat plantation.

And we must never beleive Donnie will look out for the publics health and well being!  Trump = FAILURE!

Have fun trying spreading your virus. Trump has and will continue to win. Haven't seen 1 Biden sign and just watched a Trump bost parade.
Nothing Trump hasn’t done already
AGREED...he’s running for cover and with no Republican POTUS coming for a while he’s not getting a pardon.  But, he could resign for medical purposes and the GOP could pick another candidate.  Trump could cross his fingers and hope for a GOP win and a pardon...or go to jail!
Trump and Kanye are both insane!!
What a truly heartless individual. A chip off the old Trump. #November2020
Such bullshit. Parents here are still bitching about our school being virtual because the governor is creeping closer to Trump probably because the election is coming up and the politically appointed state health commissioner is toeing the Republican line on schools.
Trump is a #FakeChristian
Indiana here! Voting for President Trump!
I would love to see those positive results. Guarantee DeWine didn’t actually test positive, just wanted to send a message to Trump and have the spotlight on him again. Sad little man
Democrats think if they keep repeating all of this it’s going to change someone’s mind to vote for Joe Biden? Everyone knows the virus is China’s fault. We know the President Trump acted quickly and he was criticized by the Dems. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #WuhanCoronavirus
Danold, trump who?
Watching Trump and Biden video clips on this here free website and thinking: "This ain't the best we can do...but this IS America."  phew.
He held it upside down, no wait that was trump......never mind
That’s as intellectually lazy as Trump saying it is what it is.
Yes sir! Thank you! Trump 2020!
You're right, you HATE and you love Trump because he does hateful things.

"Donald Trump didn’t become “presidential” after his election, as he promised. He is a sociopath, a narcissist, a pathological liar, a misogynist and a bully.  Many believe that he is a racist."

"The scope of the allegations by the New York attorney general represent a serious challenge to the longtime political juggernaut and a top ally of President Trump."
And Pence is a huge disappointment to the American people. I hope he doesn’t think he can return to political life in Indiana when Trump loses the election. We don’t want him here!
Please for the love... let Trump debate him
More credit probably goes to Trump just being himself.
Imagine if President Trump said this?

Watching the Trump Axios interview my 5 yr old has the following observations: 1- “I don’t think he has a heart.” 2- “He should try to be nice to people.” 3- “He’s always interrupting his questions.”  #TrumpIsALaughingStock
Can Trump defeat himself?  He has been succeeding at it. What if he stopped all his criticisms of others ?
I pray President Trump is re-elected! Trump/Pence are better equipped to lead our nation than Joe Biden and any of his potential VP picks.
American made is making a comeback but you’re not in office. Oh, right, President Trump is in office. Joe and I thank #45 for bringing American Made back.
He obviously didn't get the antidote to prevent covid19 that trump and other Republicans took!!
I feel that way a lot as I can’t believe the shit tRump does ang gets away with. I have to step away at times for sanity. Oh. And  own a small biz. It’s SOOOO frustrating
I really feel bad for Joe. I’m a Trump guy but really hate to see mental decline especially in seniors. Seriously.

BS. The only way that stuttering, dementia stricken Biden wins is if there is nationwide ballot fraud. He is no match for President Trump. Bring on the debates!
You were gonna lose the ‘16 gubernatorial. Hoosiers we’re done with your bullshit before Trump bailed you out. You’re a failure on so many levels.
Giving Trump a platform I’m which to bloviate and spew lies is a waste. Don’t debate him at all!
Trump vs. Biden
Honestly, I’m fine with Trump accepting the nomination from the White House. In light of the pandemic, the House can write him a 1 day Hatch act waiver. It’s the other 364 days I’m worried about.
Some of Trump’s “very fine people!”
I hope so!  I need to think positively.  Biden is light years ahead of Trump in abilities!
Maybe it is because Trump has a higher rating at this time in his presidency than Obama had, and Obama didn't have the news media up his ass every day??? I seriously think Trump will win 40-42 states in November.
Yeah, let’s focus on the 2016 election while Trump sabotages the 2020 election. Wake up folks, this is just another one of his diversionary tactics.
The President who is surrounded/ protected by people instantly tested/screened for COVID submits his absentee ballot, this is how he shows he cares about us, let them die!   Trump campaign sues Nevada over bill expanding mail-in voting for general election
I hear you, but there in lies the problem. "They're all bad... except for my guy."  Holcomb is the Indiana chair for Trump's re-election campaign.

Doesn’t he always talk nonsense? I wonder what Lebanese officials were thinking when Trump made those comments.
Most establishment media polls show President Trump trailing in a matchup with Joe Biden, but a closer look at the data shows that most of these polls may be built simply to discourage conservative voters from showing up.   History repeats itself.
Donald Trump did not hijack the Republican Party. He is the culmination of their vision from the last 50 years.   Out today is a new book from  one of the most successful Republican campaign strategists ever.
Let's go  Time for you to step up for all Hoosiers. tRump is going down so "what have YOU got to lose." All IN Voters want this right, do it!
Voter suppression exists, and THIS time it won’t exclusively affect under privileged, black dominated areas. By delegitimizing mail in votes and slowly killing the USPS, trump is proving that he can’t rely on voter turnout this time. He’s floundering. Take note.
Yesterday 1400 Americans died of COVID, the richest country is losing the war against COVID. Testing in UK 90 min turnaround, US 5 to 14 days. Americans have priorities we want to be the war against COVID, Republican's want to punish Trump's enemies! What side are you on America?
Agree. Biden can misspeak and makes gaffes and the GOP will have a heyday with it.  Nothing to gain; he’s polling well.  Trump probably doesn’t want to debate but he’s a  bully and moderators don’t moderate properly.  They should mute for interrupting and going over time limit.
Another rule Trump violates on a regular basis.
Blaming Trump for the deaths would be like blaming you for them..totally inaccurate.
$1M to create between 16 and 30 jobs???  Yup, sounds like trump math.  We’ll follow the $$ and see where it really goes.  You’ve never been altruistic in your life—I smell a rat.
We all need to challenge ourselves to find a way to vote for Trump at least 25 times and majority of those need to be in a swing state.
Once again he’s little by little trying to make people doubt the validity of the election if he loses and when we don’t have results right away...cause good chance we won’t and that’s to be expected this election.

The El Paso shooter was radicalized by socialism based solely on white identity politics. He just used Trump’s wall stance as a means to achieve an alternative leftist agenda. And Trump denounced him, while the DNC corporate donors fund BLM and Antifa. Weak comparison.
I have the word Trump muted on Twitter and it's like a much needed trigger warning any time a tweet is muted.
maybe just maybe they lie about trump too . Hmmmm.  it sucks when the media turns on you doesn’t it?  Think about it …
How many dems switched? Two. Strom Thurmond and David Duke (who denounced Trump and supports Ilhan Omar). My point is there was no conspired agreement in the 60s to switch ideologies. Example: Dems today support affirmative action while Reps support merit.
Americans don’t want to see fighter jets in a bill that is intended to help Americans survive! Trump stole money from the defense budget to build pieces of a wall on the border and now Mitch and his buddies are trying to get money back for the military. GOP = SHAMELESS!

Sometimes I think you are both heads of the same snake. Zero faith in you. Follow Trump’s lead and help him please.
Maybe, just maybe, those people are afraid to come back to work for companies that aren’t fully safe in the middle of a pandemic.   And the GOP is fighting for COVID liability protection for those same companies in case their workers catch it there.   And Trump has no plan.
I think the party made the pick...and found something when vetting. Now they are in the oh F$!# mode and hunting down another...
Did Trump find a surrogate to take his cognitive test? He does not seem well at all.
In his recent interview with Jonathan Swan on  Trump claimed no one from BLM has reached out to talk with him. Is this so, and are there plans to have a conversation with the White House on how to move forward with police reform?
Biden is going to be exhausted rescinding all of these Trump Executive Orders!

In all fireworks explosions wouldn't there be several going off everywhere?? That's BS it was an intentional fucking explosion put in place by the same people responsible for Trump. The location was a message that it will be in a huge populated area next? Just my opinion?
Dude, she loudly and proudly spelled out her contempt for Trump and distrust of Hillary in 2016. She also stated she wrote in a candidate, but didn't vote for either. Reread my comment, S L O W L Y and comprehend a viewpoint other than your own.

I'm working on my front porch in Carmel right now and a guy walking his dog just passed by while holding up his phone and watching the  Trump interview.
Oh more of the public paid for NPR fake news to prop up a politically dead man come Nov. 3 2020 when American again call their bluff. You really want to paint Trump as the underdog again? Useful idiots!
This story is news. It illustrates the lens through which Trump sees and evaluates everything- his own narcissistic ego and empty soul. He is void of heart and empathy towards others. I applaud John Lewis for never acknowledging this illegitimate president.
There is a lot of international huff &amp; puff over a fad app. #TikTok is big now, but it’ll be irrelevant in a few years like all apps of this nature.

Wow that clip was hard to watch. The fact that Trump is president is pretty damn scary. He has no clue on what going on or having his staff BS for him.
#CuomoBusinessDestroyer has done a fine job, he is very good at whining and blaming the states problems on #OrangeManBad .    How does this help fix NYC crime problems.  Deblasio’s BLM mural in front of Trump Tower and taking $1bil from police budget didn’t do the trick!
Really confused how this has anything to do with Trump.
It's very simple, and I'm serious, put a bounty on Trump and his culprit's heads. We play by the rules(like we always do)and let trump do his evil shit, we get 4 more years of Republicans!!

I absolutely do , to me if you need a mask to go to Walmart and you can go to Walmart , you can wear a mask to the polling stations on November 3 rd , why doesn’t President Trump say that during his briefings ???
Anyone who (incorrectly) believes social media platforms censor conservative voices should search “George Floyd” on this website right now and look at what comes up.   See also:
What a source....FOX is really stooping lower everyday...whose gonna watch FOX when Trump loses and his crazies turn off their TV’s.
I have been with trump sense day one. Small business owner of a water well repair business. The drill rigs work in all the fields. Sense he has taken office it has completely turned back around!
I feel trapped. I don’t care that my state will go for Trump (IN), I have to register my vote against him. I don’t want to vote in-person, but I also don’t want my vote to be “lost in the mail.” It’s criminal being forced to choose risking my families health and voting. I hate it
The Trump cohorts!
You saw no Biden supporters at a Trump rally. I wonder why genius.
How about let’s scrap the election and leave Trump in charge. He’s running against Sleepy Joe who is not sure what zip code he lives in.
Persist...LOL, You're so 2017.  The next 4 years of Trump again are going to be tough for you. Hang in there.
Trump was so close to getting the suburban parent vote back in shutting down TikTok.    He caved to get the under 18 vote.    #waitForIt

Trump has no healthcare plan. Trump has no Covid plan. Trump has no economic recovery plan. Trump has no infrastructure plan.  The only plan trump has is to be the dictator.
Trump is way ahead of you.
Since President Trump has done more to lift up and support the black community than any other president, including the first black president, he’d not be phased. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Trump Temple Coin. I have one. Very prophetic.
We all know. Trump will crucify Biden.
Hold up,  consulted with Trump over buying  ????  PLEASE do not sell to them TT...  PLEASE do not.President Trump is working on an Executive Order to order something already existing under #ACA #Obamacare which the DOJ is working to potentially undermine in court. Fixed it for you Bloomberg.
Also what is your take on the video Trump posted of campaign since extending past the two year term limit. Do you see any problems with that?
Not terrorism either. The white supremacist and Trump supporters shooting up public places on the other hand? Those are terrorists
Trump isn’t thinking about American people when he talks about using an executive order to pass a stimulus bill. He’s thinking about himself. He’s trying save his failing campaign because he knows he’s been caught red handed
If I don’t vote for Biden, then I’m voting for Trump. But if I don’t vote for Trump, then I’m voting for Biden. So, since that cancels out, I get to participate in democracy the way I’d like to by voting for the candidate whose values match mine. Sounds about right to me.
Fear Mongering 101, Professor Trump lecturing!
I guess Trump's Country Club members got their money's worth tonight!
My personal opinion is that Trump is a piece of shit, and that everyone that supports him owns apart of that.
shut up lmao
You need to watch “Frances and Friends” on Sonlife broadcasting.  They are worshipping at the alter of tRump.  Anyone that doesn’t vote for the orange pumpkin is called ignorant and a sinner.
Pacers without Nate McMillan have a much higher ceiling, but also a much lower floor.  Have a feeling, for Simon, high floor will always trump low floor when it comes to bottom-line revenue governance.
Can you imagine! They must be a uglier than trump and that's saying a lot!
I had heard Trump wanted it canceled because of the weather....
Kanye West indicates he is running for president to siphon votes from Joe Biden | Fox News
The “Wishing it away” Trump did between January and March IS Trump’s fault. That plus the fact Trump shut down the Pandemic Team solely because Obama created it, are the 2 main reasons we are where we are. Add to that, he muzzled the doctors for telling the truth. And here we are
Lowest ratings ever in the history of the world (using Trump language here)!  By Wednesday most Americans are tired of hearing anything that has to do with Trump...TBS = Trump Burnout Syndrome!
Women for trump set women back by 100 years.... ooop I said it
To paraphrase MLK, Trump wants socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor.
I just stated a fact. Do you want me to go Trump’s Administration for Alternative Facts?
I wish you were the Democratic nominee. I cannot in good conscious vote for Trump or Biden. This may be the first year I won’t vote. I don’t feel I have a good choice from either party.
More uneducated women vote for Trump, than those women with college degrees. If you could read, you’d know that.
LOL I live in Indiana the land of Mike Pence 😂 I didn’t realize the most conservative state in the rust belt was a communist state. Trump is rather popular here, I probably wouldn’t call his supporters commie’s. That’s not very nice now.
Biden clearly thinks blacks can’t make that decision. “You ain’t black.” And “Blacks aren’t diverse.” Meanwhile President Trump has made black lives better with lowest black unemployment, criminal reform and freedom and opportunity for ALL races. #Trump2020Landslide
Kanya could not coordinate a single car funeral.This is all Donald Trumps doing. He's using Kanye and Kanye is allowing it for the publicity and money. Is shameful since everyone sees Kanye is mentally unstable.  But thats the game Trump plays. He's using a black person yet again
Ofcourse, we’re better than most of the politicians we elect. I really wish y’all would have chosen a better candidate. Somebody like Beto or even Sanders would have prompted me to consider a Democratic nominee, but I just can’t get with what is essentially a Dem. Trump.
It’s not an imaginary scenario. It’s an educated assumption. If you’re not willing to admit this is how most Biden endorsers operate, than you’re just as unable to admit when you’re wrong as trump is. Have a great day
Trump - "we cannot let any Democratic state vote that will vote against me."  What a total lack of any basic common sense. The narcissistic mind is a terrible thing to waste.
You’re so gullable and ignorant, that you’ll accept and apology from a candidate who has made comments similar to this multiple times. When trump makes questionable comments, you would not accept and apology regardless, so don’t even act like the apology matters.
Y’all are too far gone at this point. If this were trump, you would of been irate and no apology would matter to you. The fact you don’t recognize your own hypocrisy is beyond me. You can’t pick and choose the bigotry you tolerate, that’s not how it works.
Yes, but if this was trump you would be throwing a fit. How are y’all not noticing how much Biden exposes your hypocrisy😭
Check your facts. Under Trump AND the GOP House before 2019, the debt went up 3 Trillion. That’s under complete GOP control. 2019 and 2020 has increased because of COVID-19 primarily. We are leading the world in deaths, because Trump torched the Pandemic Team Obama had installed.
Biden can choose my oldest most battered garden gnome and it will possess more drive and intellectual agility than Trump's entire cabinet. And he'll have my vote regardless.
Eeeeek #Mutts4Mike 🐾 has many concerns about the crime bill. It’s 2020 and we are WAY behind in criminal justice reform. The #Puppers would encourage you check out the First Step Act Bill that was signed into law last yr by Trump regarding federal prisons and compare it to this
Yes! I will be nearly 70 come Election Day but I will suit up, mask up and do whatever to make sure Trump presidency is no more!
So if he’s running for president AGAINST Trump, why would he be meeting with Trumps appointee?  He’s a joke. A farce. He makes himself look more ignorant with every word spoken. He couldn’t design a straw much less anything to do with education. He’s a Trump distraction
Eww Meghan. It does mean that in this time. Stop hating Trump because you’re  bitter. His policies are GOOD for the country.
You should have seen this coming - all you had to do was check trump and you chickened out
He’s a mental wreck and needs to have an intervention. Trump will spit him out when he’s done and they Kanye will see what he’s done to himself and that will lead to self harm.
The next Tic Tok will spring up overnight under a new name and carry on. This is the same thing every failed and bankrupt Trump business does. Youth will not be silenced. And Gid bless them for it.
Amen and Preach. Anything less is a vote for Trump.
I predict Eric Trump should stick to watching Spongebob and reading Hooked in Phonics and leave the politics to the adults.
And we must never beleive Donnie will look out for the publics health and well being!  Trump = FAILURE!
Agree...Trump, Pence and this Administration are all deranged and obviously you are drinking more than your share of their cool-aid!
Trump is planning on banning TikTok in 45 days if a US company doesn’t buy it. Capitalism at its finest, everybody.
I know a lot of us will feel better once Trump is gone
Pew Research on Trump's handling of Covid:  63% say he is doing a poor or only fair job 37% say he is doing good or excellent job  62% say the US response is less effective than other developed countries.
True, but a large number of those white working class voters in the midwest that Trump got last time are, uhh, irish, polish, and italian catholics.
Have fun trying spreading your virus. Trump has and will continue to win. Haven't seen 1 Biden sign and just watched a Trump bost parade.
AGREED...he’s running for cover and with no Republican POTUS coming for a while he’s not getting a pardon.  But, he could resign for medical purposes and the GOP could pick another candidate.  Trump could cross his fingers and hope for a GOP win and a pardon...or go to jail!
And he’s not done yet. He still has time to add trillions before the election to buy some votes. I’m voting early so Trump and Barr dont screw me out of my vote. I suggest everybody do the same and get this prick out of the WH and into prison where he belongs.
Seriously?  Seriously?  How can anyone of faith support Trump?  I just don't get it.
You are delusional. The deficit was 19 trillion when Numb Nuts came in. It’s over 26 trillion now. He’s handing out cash like candy w/o any way to pay for it. He’s doing it as a bribe in an election year. This is Trump’s spending spree. Not Dems.
This was just a segment on MTP daily. Some Republicans in Ohio telling Biden who he has to pick for him to win his vote. I started laughing.  People who will vote for Trump anyway.
Trump is a #FakeChristian
Sorry but any vote not used or not used for Joe Biden is a Trump vote. So you have to ask yourself, is any one VP pick WORSE than 150k+ dead Americans?  I'd be interested in your response.
Trump taking a page from Jerry Falwells recent exploits.  Since Falwell posted his "look at me" selfie, looks like Trump had to one up him.  And both men claim to be Christians.  Do not stand near either of them.  Lightning will chain from person to person. God will not be mocked
Democrats think if they keep repeating all of this it’s going to change someone’s mind to vote for Joe Biden? Everyone knows the virus is China’s fault. We know the President Trump acted quickly and he was criticized by the Dems. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #WuhanCoronavirus
There is nothing tRump will not say.
He keeps playing around like this and God will talk with him immediately.  He will not like the outcome, guaranteed. Jesus makes it clear we are not to judge others. Here is the President calling Joe Biden "against God" Every true Christian RIGHT NOW must walk away from Trump.
You can’t be pro God and pro Trump.  It’s one or the other.
Trump only cares about himself and what he says. That’s why it is so easy for him to ignore most comments by all those around him. He goes into a meeting believing he knows it all and comes out with the same attitude as when he entered. He will not listen!
Will the Governor be greeting you or did he get the Trump Virus?????
We have a paper trail linking $30million from NRA to Trump. Show us the paper trail between the DNC, BLM, and Planned Parenthood. BTW, Planned Parenthoodgives cancer screenings to low-income women. Seems like a good thing to me.
Trump is lying today, lying tomorrow and lying the next day...repeat.  It is what it is!
I only need one reason not to vote for Trump...he has zero integrity!  Waiting for my ballot to come in the mail!
Translation: Trump tells NRA to move to a corrupt state where laws don’t matter.
I wonder if this means the NRA has it’s finances frozen. Remember, NRA funneled $30million into Trump’s war chest back in 2016.
Just a sidebar, but is anyone else eager to hear what the NY AG is going to say about Trump’s financial records? I am all ears...
And Pence is a huge disappointment to the American people. I hope he doesn’t think he can return to political life in Indiana when Trump loses the election. We don’t want him here!
You only need to see this comes from the NY Post, which equals Breitbart, OANN, Newsmax, and every other Trump Media Cartoon Fishwrap published today.
Imagine if President Trump said this?
I didn’t know there was an uncensored. Jose, in the regular one, used to get on my nerves but he’s been anti trump and pro blm and stuff lately so I’ve revised my opinion of him a bit.
These are the Trump supporters and followers that need to go Twitter people.  Please make sure your registered in your state and if mailing in, be prepared to double stamp your envelope, even if pre-paid and send it in as early as possible. #BlueWave2020
Folks Cornyn is about as bad as they come in Texas and thats saying a lot. Will you please follow  and spread her tweets so that she can trounce John Cornyn and stop his mindless Trump following and turn Texas Blue??
John Roberts adhered to the rule of law and the Constitution. This upsets Pence, because when Trump loses, Pence goes back to being irrelevant, again. Without Trump to carry him, Pence will go back to the same buffoon who embarrassed Indiana for 3-1/2 years. #rfrawasajoke
Still think we should have compassion for poor Kanye (more like Con-ye)?  Mental illness is horrible but when it hurts others, as harming an election does, then they must be stopped for their own good.This will only damage him more and Trump knows it.
As a counselor who has tons of counselor friends and works at a major hospital, I do not know of a single one of us who is a Trump supporter. I know no different Cyprus or nurses who support him either. Plenty of the people who run the hospital worship him though. Businessmen.
God is not now nor has ever been interested in politics. The people wanted a king so God gave them what they asked for, and we’ve been paying for our stupidity ever since. If you think God appointed Trump or any Oresident, you don’t know God.
The RNC purchased Hannitys book and is giving it away to donors. I saw the email myself.  Trump could not stand Mary's book being number 1 so he had Hannitys book purchased by the RNC. Its like the author buying his own book, only with Americans money.
His base doesn't read. The RNC purchased Hannitys book and is giving it away to donors. I saw the email. Trump could not stand Mary's book being number 1 so he had Hannitys book purchased by the RNC. Its like the author buying his own book, only with Americans money.
Supurb.  Sean Trump, the son Donald buys 5 3 packs of underwear for at Christmas time!!
The RNC purchased Hannitys book and is giving it away to donors. Trump could not stand Mary's book being number 1 so he had Hannitys book purchased by the RNC. Its like the author buying his own book, only with Americans money. Another "Trump Deal" thats really a lie.
Watch her.  She's reading from a script.  She keeps looking down at it.  She must have a "Trump Binder" like KayLIE does.  They cant speak unless they have their binders telling them what to say. They are Trumps Stepford Wives. So sad they chose to let that happen to them.
I really feel bad for Joe. I’m a Trump guy but really hate to see mental decline especially in seniors. Seriously.
Wait you must have read wrong . I’m voting for Biden not trump #pedophiletrump
BS. The only way that stuttering, dementia stricken Biden wins is if there is nationwide ballot fraud. He is no match for President Trump. Bring on the debates!
Just another Wednesday for Trump and his zombie followers and blackmailed co-workers.
What many people who Trump keeps in line with threats of telling their secrets is - he is going to tell them anyway once he gets fired.  They are just delaying the inevitable.
Trump vs. Biden
I just tried to watch trump answer questions.. Can not do it. Please tell me how anyone could think he is capable of being president.#TrumpIsNotWell
Ever wonder why all the MAGAs first words are almost always name calling? They listen to their teachers well. Trump can hardly utter a sentence without calling someone something. Name calling and yelling are signs you've already lost rational thought.
Absolutely no debates before early voting. That will make Trump and the Goon Squad mad as hell.  Also cute how Trump thinks he gets to pick moderators like he handpicks his interviewers and questions. Although that Axios interview, well that didn't work out so well for him.
If he gets a "golfing trip" like Lindsay does, then this was his own doing. If not, and my bet is that it is not his own doing, then this was planted by Trump for some reason. Hard to believe Trump would say the words "Apologize to Obama" ever. We shall see.
Someone too progressive will turn voters and give them an excuse to vote for Trump just as Hillary did.
Some of Trump’s “very fine people!”
If Kanye gets more than 10 votes (the number of his family members that can vote) then the election is truly rigged. He needs mental help badly. His latest comments were enough to enrage the entire BLM movement. Can you imagine him and Trump in a debate? "Yo, Yo, Yo Semites!"
Maybe it is because Trump has a higher rating at this time in his presidency than Obama had, and Obama didn't have the news media up his ass every day??? I seriously think Trump will win 40-42 states in November.
Yeah, let’s focus on the 2016 election while Trump sabotages the 2020 election. Wake up folks, this is just another one of his diversionary tactics.
The President who is surrounded/ protected by people instantly tested/screened for COVID submits his absentee ballot, this is how he shows he cares about us, let them die!   Trump campaign sues Nevada over bill expanding mail-in voting for general election
You cannot be a fundamentally good person and support Donald Trump, volume 3853289235329532.
Trump Mafia strikes again! I hope that someone steps up and gets he and his family round the clock security protection
actually it’s been proven that facebook is an even larger nation security threat but Trump doesn’t care because we ruined his rallies🤷🏻‍♀️
So open the schools without many of the teachers?  BRILLIANT!!! This man is a dream to be running against for office. Just run all of his interviews back as attack ads. No one makes Donald Trump look and sound more ignorant and out of touch than Donald Trump does.
When Trump says there is no truth to something, you can take it to the bank its a fact.
Is he still talking? Isn't it time for his "trout fishing" trip?  Oh well as long as he and Trump and McConnell keep saying idiotic things daily, Biden never even has to hold a rally. They are winning for him.
They threw their full support behind Trump.  Tells you all you need to know.  Biden will have to rebuild them from the ground up.
Voter suppression exists, and THIS time it won’t exclusively affect under privileged, black dominated areas. By delegitimizing mail in votes and slowly killing the USPS, trump is proving that he can’t rely on voter turnout this time. He’s floundering. Take note.
Yesterday 1400 Americans died of COVID, the richest country is losing the war against COVID. Testing in UK 90 min turnaround, US 5 to 14 days. Americans have priorities we want to be the war against COVID, Republican's want to punish Trump's enemies! What side are you on America?
Kayleigh’s right. No one could have handled the virus the way Trump has...That’s why Biden is going to win.
President Donald J. Trump! 🇺🇸
I want to see Biden stand up to Trump in a way Hillary did not, as well as make it obvious just how stupid Trump really is.
Americans don’t want to see fighter jets in a bill that is intended to help Americans survive! Trump stole money from the defense budget to build pieces of a wall on the border and now Mitch and his buddies are trying to get money back for the military. GOP = SHAMELESS!
Biden could go on vacation until 11/03 as long as DOnald Trump keeps talking. He is the "bigliest" support of Biden there is. Idiot Trump said today that he;s done more for Black People than anyone but Lincoln!!! Why would you ever debate a lunatic like that??
The Economy is Cratering. Welcome to the Trump Depression. by
Actually reflects dissatisfaction with required peaceful protest for systemic racism with underlying police brutality plus lack of leadership for pandemic &amp; dire economic fallout by a criminal &amp; GOP sychophants.  "It is what it is."            ~Trump (death of nearly 160,000)
Way to judge everyone there Commander sinless!! God will love speaking with you about that. Look, I understand your love for Trump has made you intelligence blind, and thats ok.  You do you. But when you just want to name call, I've got 1 word for you - BLOCKED!! Buh-bye!
The writers of the best comedies ever, could note come up with something this funny, yet sad at the same time.  AXIOS on HBO: President Trump Exclusive Interview (Full Episode) | HBO  via
Joe, let me apologize for Donnie...he’s busy with a FOX news propaganda interview and has no time to try to find some compassionate thoughts and words to share with the people of LEBANON!  Trump is SOULLESS!
No one cares.... Lie today, lie tomorrow, lie the next day.....it is what it is!  Trump is a FAILURE!
Lie today, lie tomorrow, lie the next day.....it is what it is!  Trump is a FAILURE!
If you actually think this is the wife of that loon then look again.. writing style is the same... the 3 second instant response time to anything trump tweets is exactly the same too.
Trump playbook...what companies are you talking about?  You know the employer can notify the unemployment office and notify them a person has been recalled to work and the unemployment payment stops!  Nice try...GOP FAILURE!
"Stupid is as stupid does - and NOBODY does stupid like Donald Trump" - America
It gave me more insight into the inner workings of trump’s wasting-away brain. He chooses a particular thought or idea that he likes and wants to believe, and then he convinces himself it is correct beyond any reasoning and everything/everyone else is incorrect or fake.
This is the same look sane Americans have whenever Trump speaks, or KayLIE speaks, or Tucker speaks, or Lindsay speaks, or McConnell speaks, or Ivanka speaks, or Don Jr. speaks, or when Eric puts a full sentence together.
I think the party made the pick...and found something when vetting. Now they are in the oh F$!# mode and hunting down another...
I love how every other sentence Trump says is "I will sue them." Have any of you ever heard of him actually suing anyone and winning anything? He's a bloated bag of narcissistic hot air.  Come on 11/03/2020.  You cannot get here soon enough.
Does that match you spending for the White House expansion (which Trump or you wont be around to enjoy anyway), and the extravagant military spending, as well as cutting the unemployment benefit. Either tell both sides or don't speak.
Watching Dave Portnoy sucking Trump’s dick is the height of “not being political”
Biden is going to be exhausted rescinding all of these Trump Executive Orders!
The insult is that Trump isn't a caring individual, but you wouldn't understand that , since it seems you hate him so much
Clay hasn’t gotten better everything right, but what he has done is stick to the data and provide common sense to this, which has been far more than most of the media who are more concerned with getting Trump out of the White House.  He’s been right far more than wrong.
IF ONLY, panelists stopped Trump from talking when he isn’t answering the question.
Trump is making moves from the White House to the golf course or moving to his phone to play on Twitter....you have been fooled bigley Doc!
He's just a biased person who doesn't care about facts. Fortunately the economy is coming back strong to prove what an amazing president Trump has been
I disagree with my brother always on politics...still my brother and I love him.  P.S.  going to love it when Trump loses and I can rub it in my brothers face forever!
Watching this Trump Axios interview. Serenity now.
Show some fucking respect you orange POS #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpCrimeFamily #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #JoeBiden2020
I wonder if the ratings for Trump’s trials will be off the charts? I know I’ll be watching every day.
I think Trump and DeathSantis are immune to Covid. Satan wants no part of them getting into Hell because it is clear that they will totally take over the place from him.
I will stick by my stance that Biden should not do debates. Trump is unstable, thats already been proven, so whats to gain? The media wants them to make both men look bad - thats their job. Trump makes himself look idiotic every day. Joe should sit them out. Just my opinion.
Just a reminder - The Police Union Head put the unions FULL BACKING behind Donald Trump.  This will be "just another day" for them going forward until Biden takes over.
Lindsay got that "Sunday Golf Outing" with Trump and after every golf trip he comes back and say the exact opposite of what he said the previous week. Man, whatever Trump has on Lindsay is really good stuff. Trump could tell him to dance naked and you can bet he will dance naked.
To those who feel certain that Trump, Barr, and the rest of the GOP are going to play a “Shell Game” with polling places on Election Day to suppress the vote totals, vote early if you can. That way they can’t run the clock out on you.
The truth is we know how History will remember John Lewis. We also are well aware of how History will remember Donald J Trump. One was a “Hero”. The other is a “Zero”.
This story is news. It illustrates the lens through which Trump sees and evaluates everything- his own narcissistic ego and empty soul. He is void of heart and empathy towards others. I applaud John Lewis for never acknowledging this illegitimate president.
That's one of the big issues right here. Trump supporters are fine with "protests", but aren't "allowed" to disagree or protest themselves without being demonized or violently verbally and physically attacked. Freedom should go both ways.
We are still working for a revolution. Biden is no better than trump, not one of these 10 doesnt apply to both of them
Amen. Thank you for your reminder to those flipping out. Every minute Biden waits to announce is another minute Trump and the a Republicans cannot attack whomever he picks.
Why are people wasting their time watching these Petri-Dish Campaign Rallies Trump has. Bottom line...if a doctor or scientist isn’t taking questions from the press, you may as well be listening to Kayleigh the Klown orchestrate the bullshit.
And they delivered all those $1200 checks with Trump’s name on ghem
What a source....FOX is really stooping lower everyday...whose gonna watch FOX when Trump loses and his crazies turn off their TV’s.
Trump had a ton of Hannity's books purchased and then given away as gifts to donors. That put Hannity's book above Mary Trumps book on the charts. Again, Trump spent a ton of money to get back at Mary Trump. Still think he's not a narcissistic little boy inside?
You saw no Biden supporters at a Trump rally. I wonder why genius.
Ill vote. Neither biden nor trump is worth my vote though.
"..You realize that significantly more Trump voters than Biden voters are uneducated, right?.." you're not serious are you?

Do we hear Trump hate still dripping out of that old mouth of yours!
Since President Trump has done more to lift up and support the black community than any other president, including the first black president, he’d not be phased. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Trump is in no shape to stalk behind Biden like he did Hillary.  He would fall over.  Plus when he gets pissed he cannot just walk off like he does his pressers. It will be a total disaster for Trump - and I can;t wait to watch!!!
Whoops you made a type - this should read "President Trump is committed to defending Russia and the US knows it."  Actions sir speak louder than idiotic words and idioms. Trump has defended statues and government buildings with 150k+ dead. Facts - they don't lie.
Trump has refused to accept our own intelligence community determination and has done nothing for Russia "interfering in Western democratic elections in 2016 and 2017" as you say. You don't mention anything specific done in retaliation for those acts, because there were none.
So true! The only thing Donald Trump can so with any consistency is lie, oh and mispronounce every other word. Trump was going to have en Executive Order written to ban it but then Bill Gates said he would just buy it if Trump did that, so that put the breaks on it for now.
Garbage....vaccines take time to develop.....let’s let science do their work and not get ahead of ourselves!  Trump let 155000 people die and more coming....SOULLESS!
Explain why Trump is responsible? Do you have facts he created the virus? You complained when he shut the country down from China. You realize you have been endocrinated?
After looking at your Twitter page i've decided that nothing I provide as facts will offer assistance to reality.  So keep living in your alternative universe.  I'm just afraid how you will react when Trump is reelected.  I only hope you actually educate yourself with real facts.
One of the Trump Children is probably due for a cut of the sale.
Like everything else he touches, this will blow up in  face.... #tiktokban #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpHasATinyDick
This is Tucker Trump, a son that Don doesn't speak much of.  Don takes him to rallies that they attend together.  It's very sad how much Don neglects him.  It's almost as if #TrumpDoesntGiveATuck
Trump is yours - admit it. Nothing is more obvious!!
This is Tucker Trump, Donald's son.  Don doesn't talk about him much, but from time to time he lets him go to some rallies with him. It's sad Don doesn't much claim him - it's almost as if #TrumpDoesntGiveATuck
Seriously, we could be in a much better place right now if Trump and his Administration would have been 1000% focused on proactive measures!  Failed response is on Trump and the GOP!
No, President Obama was much more intelligent in his abuse of power... spying on journalists, disabling opposition 501c3s, and then spying on Trump and all his cronies. President Obama was much smarter.
Trump knows it will not be a unanimous vote with a Romney there and he MUST be able to tell America he was unanimously voted in by the party. Narcissists cannot have deserters making them look bad.
I couldn't agree with you more on all of your points. No other time in history have the Republicans held a closed door vote. I also think that it may not be a unanimous vote with Romney in there and Trump doesn't want that seen.
Because followers of narcissists do what their master does and that is "project". They know they are followers so thats what they call others. Don;t Trump calls Joe Biden "Sleepy" because thats all he does. When they call you something they are telling you that is what they are.
Anyone else think he just might be a Trump supporter?
Man, I remember you predicted Trump would resign if it looks like he is going to lose..I think he is setting the table with these recent stops at Walter Reed!
You are proving my point. You say Trump just took pics and basically wasn't involved, but You assume Gates needs to go to prison. We all have our opinions without really knowing many facts... That being said, you may be spot on.
...they say ohhh no, covid, we can’t go out of our houses. but then say it’s okay to protest in groups of 200+🤔. they don’t care about black lives or lives in general they only care about money. Remember trump gave up MILLIONS to save this country🤫
...you don’t wanna vote trump or republican because “we’re all racist”. Even though he’s done more for the African American citizens than Obama did in 8 years and Biden did in   40 years. Democrats only care about black lives because it helps them in the long run...
Dude it ain’t even an american company. I swear y’all just wake up every morning prepared to give a melodramatic “I hate trump” monologue
I get that, but truth seems stranger than fiction. I'm still shocked about Clinton and Trump and Bill Gates being in photos with that moron.
Excitement FOR, not AGAINST, a candidate drives voter turnout.  has over 10 times the following as  Granted, Trump’s enemies and other countries follow him, too, but not to that extreme. The polls are wrong... again. The  picked the wrong candidate.
Just a tip to those not paying attention. When Trump starts a sentence with “I’ve heard from a lot of people” or “people already know this”... he just made it up.
That is the biggest bold faced lie I have heard to date. Trump bullied States into opening too soon in defiance of CDC recommendations. There was also an insufficient amount of testing and contact tracing that might have mitigated the spread of the virus. It is now out of control
So what you’re saying is if I never have another echocardiogram than I no longer have cardiomyopathy or heart failure? That’s WONDERFUL! After 7 years I’m miraculously healed &amp; no longer have to pay for all these meds to keep me alive! Thank you so much for the clarity Dr. Trump!Good grief have these people watched trump talk. He can’t get out a simple sentence.

It has been different.  I can imagine how hard it must be for Trump to draw a contrast between himself and someone who rarely comes out of his house.  I understand why they don’t want Biden to come out but it definitely makes it hard to compare and contrast.
We need your support since we can get the word out. They can't stop all of us . Stay and keep helping Trump. After the election we all can leave. Just saying.

Honestly, I’m fine with Trump accepting the nomination from the White House. In light of the pandemic, the House can write him a 1 day Hatch act waiver. It’s the other 364 days I’m worried about.
I’m from Indiana and he is my senator. We have 2 republican trump guys. Ugh

Louis DeJoy gave $2,000,000 to the Republican Party under Trump who rewarded him by making him the head of the Postal Service DESPITE NO EXPERIENCE AT THE POST OFFICE.  The first thing he did was CUT SERVICES &amp; create a MASSIVE BACKLOG of mail delivery.
Is trump going to ban Twitter too? I'd like to see him try.🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
And he won’t because it is way to complex for him to handle. How many will lose their lives because it’s way to tough for trump to figure out.
Herman Cain paid a high price for not listening to the science instead of trump.  This didn’t have to be this bad if people wouldn’t make this political and treat as a public health emergency. The cost didn’t have to be 150,000 people dead.
I did read Mary Trumps book and she clarified that Trump has never been smart. Go imagine that.Actually very sad that all of you listen to the garbage that is fed to you. I want to know why Trump is so racist? Because he ran under the Republican ticket? Don't be fooled that if he ran Democrat those fools would idol him. It's only bc he exposes them that there's hate!
Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, was guided by his Christian faith in politics, business and his personal life, his pastor said at his funeral Friday.

Press reporting of this really needs to pay attention to the distinction being made by US intelligence in the article. NPR's tweet here is "both-sides" sloppiness. But article headline is accurate. China OPPOSES Trump b/c he's unpredictable. Russia actively WORKING against Biden.
Donald Trump really said “Nobody loves the Bible more than I do.“ WTF??? His lying is getting more bizarre
31,000,000 jobs lost since Trump.  Feel the MAGA yet?

President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered an unspecified ban on “transactions” with the Chinese owners of the consumer apps TikTok and WeChat. The twin executive orders — one for each app — take effect in 45 days.

Her own damn fault. The data was there from the beginning. Even at the local level, it’s all sucking up to Trump.
He needs more than his MAGA cult to win an election. A lot of independent voters don't think he can do the job. There are also Republicans who don't like him. #GOP will implode on itself when Trump loses. Hopefully they can recover because I liked being a Republican.
I'd be a little more worked up about the lack of a Trump/Biden debate if the presidential "debates" didn't consist entirely of shit any fool could Google during a commercial break.
If Biden or his son committed crimes they should be charged.  If Trump or his family committed crimes they should be charged too.  We need new leadership. PERIOD. I think they're all corrupt and self-dealing. Why are all politicans rich? Think about it...
Question... How has Trump given us our Country back? Or how will he?  It has been 4 years and not much has changed. He gave the rich (himself &amp; family) a huge tax cut. He gave rich companies (including his own) a huge tax cut too. What did we get?
Even for a president known for his blunt criticism, Trump's remarks stood out and they signaled how contentious the campaign may get over the coming months.
Maybe this is crazy thinking but President Trump has taken us back to a constitutional republic. Under the constitution of the United States no president can serve more than 2 terms. His first term was under the United States, Inc....two different entities.
Because trump said today he has a lot of enemies so we may not see him for a while
President Trump at the podium: On my map, and you know there is no one who has a better map than me. It shows me that Bangcock is the capital of Thighland. This was on the cognitive test I passed, very easy test. Joe Biden couldn't pass it. Me: I bet he can pronounce Thailand!

Whether you want Trump for president or not, Biden's statement is unquestionably racist and should disqualify him from the presidency.

It's already being normalized in the media. Yes, COVID-19 is obviously an enormous issue but Trump's transparent efforts to suppress/manipulate votes is not being covered as such but only being reported in compartmentalized and vague ways. The press is ignoring the big picture.
These questions seem based on the notion that somehow Trump will perform well at the debates. He won't. He was terrible in the debates against Hillary. At worst, the debates will be a wash for Biden and won't affect the horserace.

AND THIS! Killed grandma's and grandpa's in nursing homes and painted BLM as well Didn't use the Ship Trump sent and none of the hospitals Trump had built for NYC. HELL NO THEY SHOULDN'T GET A DIME. NO STATE SHOULD WE THE PEOPLE SAID NO.
Because trump is indebted to Russia so a bigger American military is good for russia
Small dollar donations. Fuh sho.
Is this supposed to make ppl vote instead for Donald “grab ‘em by the pussy” Trump? Just assume we’re voting for Biden for the judicial nominations.
DeWine tests negative after positive test before Trump visit  via FOX 55 News
Oh, Biden is much farther down that path than Trump!!
- one another and while yes, it is infuriating that the president is more focused on trying to ban a social media service for no good reason, we can just find a new service to communicate and make change on. we aren't lazy. and we're damn sure we're gonna get trump out of here.
Hahahahahahahahhhaaaaaa is all a conspiracy. Fauci is really playing a scientist and trump is god.
when there's still a whole pandemic flooding the united states and the president is worried about a social media service bc "they were mean to me&gt;:(("  Trump signs executive order to ban US transactions with owners of TikTok and WeChat in 45 days
if you still support trump after this year i'm just gonna assume you have worms for brains because you have to be a literal mesozoic era APE to believe this dude has done anything right.
Very naive. At this point in history stating proudly that you are "Never Trump" means you hate America, you hate our history, and you hate everything good America stands for. Figure out what team you're on and fight.  You could move to New Zealand, they speak English.
Nope....many times Trump called the Virus a hoax.
Trump all of a sudden rocking the ou "favourite" in his tweets
How do you hurt God? Isn't God all powerful?   Do you think maybe trump doesn't believe God is all powerful and that Joe Biden can hurt God?
Why are you kissing Trump's rear end? Trump/GOP economy. The rich have gotten richer. You just believe that people are lazy. Well What will you say when we have average people living in the streets? Let them eat cake? Soup kitchens? Trumpvilles? #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
Uh oh, you're getting mad. Point remains, the dossier hasn't been disproven and there were interceptions of Russian transmissions that mention trump.
Actually a pretty valid point since you are comparing apples to oranges.  How much salary did Barack accept in his 8 years?  Let’s compare that to Trump.
Yet, yesterday we had amoral, hedonist President accusing his political opponent of being anti-God. Trump who does not know how to hold a Bible, or quote the Bible.  #ETTD
No, like I said, the entire investigation was done under the idea that you can't indict a sitting president. So there was never a moment where Mueller was attempting to charge trump with anything. That doesn't mean he didn't commit a crime. You should really read the report.
Media Elite: No. The problem is that the GOP haven't gotten their act together themselves. The GOP in the Senate can't agree among themselves. Trump doesn't negotiate in good faith so Pelosi/Schumer shouldn't be talking to him #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
Never forget the "myth" of the hidden trump voter in 2016. Some "myth" that was. Just like COVID-19 is a "hoax".
Ohio Gov. got a false positive COVID19 test 4 hours later tested negative. He didn't to meet Trump. People that did the tests said my bad.
Headline:  "Next coronavirus relief package must include a big defense boost, GOP leaders argue"    WHY???  Didn't DoD just give Trump $5B for his wall that the really didn't need???  Appears DoD is OVER-FUNDED.
UPDATE: Hours after a positive test caused Governor Mike DeWine to cancel a meeting with President Trump in Cleveland, a second test came back negative.

They said "BREAKING: President Trump signs executive order to ban TikTok and WeChat in 45 days"
Why would anyone accept a job in the Trump administration at this point?  They just all be going down with the Titanic.
President Trump issues executive order barring U.S. entities from doing business with ByteDance (parent company of TikTok).  The order, which goes into effect in 45 days, says the risks posed by the platform are “real” &amp; constitute a “national emergency.”
I agree.  Trump is horrible.  I cannot see any way he can win--well, I take that back.  If he came up with a deal where the govt would pay a hefty stimulus check to Americans, reinstated $600/wk unemployment benefits and had something like Medicare4All for citizens...
Trump Tool: Once again, won't do town halls. Won't talk with  all of his constituents just certain ones. Wants to put restrictions on private bizs that he doesn't like.  161,729 #COVID19 deaths.
Now Trump is moving forward trying to ban    doesn’t need to do anything.  Just sit back and let the Trump Train drive itself off the cliff.
If it Trump then yeah!

Absurd. Anything not a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Trump. Grow up.
The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential  has rejected a request from  to either add an additional general election debate or move up the calendar for the contests.
I keep saying that I hope Susan Collins is really, really proud of herself.  Yeh boy, ol' Donnie boy sure did learn his lesson being impeached didn't he??  Trump has been this way his entire life, yet the Rs follow him like he's Jim Jones.
no vaccine promoted or encouraged or mentioned or associated in any way with the trump government has my confidence.
Trump is using Live and Let Die at his rally. I just wanted you to know. ❤️✌️
Never Trump at this time is just plain stupid
Are you so blinded by hatred for Trump to not understand that every president campaigns while in office. Even the criminal Obama.
✨trump is sexist✨
NBC News reports: "Facebook removes troll farm posing as African-American support for President Trump."
Did anyone consider the fact that he might be saying that Trump is so deficient that it might be best for Biden to not add fuel to the fire?
Trump Painting in the Studio , short &amp; sweet this lil' ditty.   via
Still peddling the "Russians hacked the DNC" line, I see. I read the Week, and mostly enjoy it, but Russiagate is just unmitigated crap. Hillary Clinton is morev responsible for the outcome of the 2016 election, and more responsible for Trump than any other factor.
I don't care what your views are, if you don't think Trump would slaughter Biden on Live TV in a debate you are lying to yourself
My left foot is better than Donald Trump
Trayvon Martin 2012, Mike Brown 2014, Eric Garner 2014, Tamir Rich 2014, Sandra Bland 2015, Freddie Gray 2015. All happened while Biden was VP and while Obama was President.  So why is police brutality is Trump's fault?
but atm they are synonymous, unfortunately. There's really no deep diving on this one either. Republicans have done nothing to draw a line in the sand or separate themselves from Trump. Other notable and visible Repubs have doubled-down, even. Straight ticket Dem on Nov 3.
it’s trump being president for me
alright never trump or his enablers
Trump loves to say Ch-EYE-na.
This means you too trump
NY AG head fake. Oh u got Trump. No I am sueing the NRA for bad business practices Media.
Now, the part we didn’t mention is that both parties use gerrymandering to win districts they don’t have a majority in. The last two Republican won elections resulted in wins from suit, Bush claimed Florida had fewer viable votes, Trump claimed much the same in other states.
The media seems to be doing this thing again with double standards where Joe has to be on point 24/7 or we ask whether he's suited to the task... Meantime, Trump is an endless, constant stream of lies, incompetence, and corruption too big and ridiculous to hold accountable.
No one is rocking yellow to no trump rally

Um that is what you hear from the right and believe it, and they try to stop it by the laws they put in with mandatory masks and the self isolation. You believe TRUMP and the right when they think that kids are immune to Covid-19 when there are cases where kids have Covid-19.
I laugh that you really think Children are Immune to Covid-19, also I am laughing that you got your stuff taken down from facebook now all we need to do to take out Trump is to take out his social media accounts. #ConsequencesForTrump

Another one trump these deaths are on your hands
It probably is but you still don't brag about passing a dementia test. That leads me to question someone's mental state. And then say the last five questions were hard. By the way, Trump never released his results. He just said he did great. There is scoring for that test.
Don’t you mean January 2021. Trump will be evicted from the White House when his lease is up that month.
Could it be...they thought it would...sanitize their insides, a la Trump and bleach?
Yes, because if President Trump would have shut everything down that early everybody would have been on board? Heck, the called him xenophobic for shutting down travel from China.
Trump Republicans deserve to be removed from office, up and down the ticket. The new GOP will form around the creators of the Lincoln Project and RVAT. These people need a voice in our government when Trump and his supporters are defeated. Maybe, it’s time to heal the nation.

Zero seen, zero heard = another lie told by Trump.
No. It's not. The report determined that the chaos from troll farms was to aid trump and harm Clinton in the election. Efforts to create racial animus were to further this goal.  And I'm still waiting to see that documentation of the 15+ people that antifa killed this year alone.
Why should he respond to bully Trump
Ohh so you're saying that had you implemented a national strategy the trump admin would've been able to prevent those deaths?   Of course not. And that's why you left the response up to states: so you could avoid responsibility (and blame political opponents) if things went bad.
Trump is a lunatic!
Well look up the racist history of the democrat party.!! Maybe you will learn something The reason why I’m a republican is because of people like mik jr, Rosa Parks, Abe Lincoln. Do I Agree with everything Mr Trump says? Of course not ! O
True but I'd still rather have Trump, he be lit sometimes

You still haven't answer if there is 0 reason why not to vote in person...Why did Trump vote by mail?

You are a little cuckoo with conspiracies aren't you??? Didn't Trump say that mail-in voting was okay in Florida which is one of the worst states at managing the voting process???
Idk why people feel the need to send me Joe Biden stuff  I don't give a fuck about him either lol  Fuck Trump the most thi
That is vote by mail and you have not addressed Trump's back pedal and lie about Florida's voting system.

She literally said that Florida is okay to Voting but other states that won't give trump his win aren't okay? Okay that is the most bullshit I ever heard of.
I bet Biden knows how to say "Yosemite." I wouldn't be using the term sticky fingers since Trump stole from his own charity, stole from people at Trump University, etc...
Trump was not invited. Please stop repeating the lie that it was his decision not to go.
I work with the elderly and you have them take the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for one reason. It is not stop the madness. Why did they feel Trump needed to take the test?
GOP myth. Just another excuse to prevent people from voting. That is all this is about with the GOP. And again Trump saying that FL is great at managing voting is just an all out lie. Remember the last significant voter fraud case was by a GOP in NC.

No the bigger question is why your people felt that Trump needed to take a dementia test to begin with... They must of thought he is having a problem. It is not a test you take  just because. By the way, is this out because Trump can't say "Yosemite." Or was he just ill prepared
I wonder if he would think the last 5 questions on the dementia test would be hard. Remember: Trump bragged that he passed a dementia test. It speaks more of people telling him to take a dementia test. You don't have individuals take that test unless you think there's a problem.
Banks neglects to point out that many companies store our user data whether an US comp or other. They keep, sell, and lose our personal data all of the time with little recourse for us. We have our identities stolen and our personal info exposed. This is all about Trump Tulsa

I couldn't watch the whole thing. TRUMP never stays on course and he never SHUTS up and listens
Trump quite a few. Biden zero nada zilch
That is what I was thinking when I saw this after work and they will blame Trump for it also
I have so many thoughts about this interview but I think it actually speaks for itself.   Watch the whole thing (and then make sure you are registered to #vote this November)

She is filled with envy.  She can't get a handout from Donald Trump because our President believes in working hard, if you can.  Notice, all his children were raised to work.
I love his reaction when Trump says "You can't do that?"  Bitch watch me do that! I just did it!"

And now Trump wants Microsoft to pay him protection money should they be successful in their bid to buy Tik Tok. Jim Banks gladly looks the other way as the POTUS strong arms American companies.
But he's not doing it because Barron's school is closed until October.  Now, show us where Trump is demanding that Barron's school re-open now
That's different. US companies are free to steal, sell, &amp; lose our data and private information at will. Banks could care less about that. This is really about Trump's super spreader event in Tulsa in which Tik Tok user disrupted it.
And for each American that has died of Covid19, he says to you "it is what it is"!😐 He is insane!😐Trump says coronavirus death toll 'is what it is' as he insists pandemic is 'under control' in U.S.
Doesn't private companies in the US do the same thing??? US companies lose and sell our information all of the time. You don't care about that.  This has more to do w/Tik Tok users disrupting Trump's Tulsa super spreader event that took out Herman Cain. Glad few showed. #ETTD

The US Postal Service has been in a decline for years even before President Trump. Everything is digital now there's not much for the postal service now. That's why workers are being laid off

FULL INTERVIEW - Jonathan Swan of Axios questions President Trump on COVID, the upcoming election and other topics. It's worth a watch:
Exactly just imagine what it's going to really be. Just like 2016! I don't do polls I don't know anyone that do do the polls and we're all voting for Trump!
For a min I thought this was a troll video.. Because I felt like Trump's answered were cut up but...nope... This isn't good
donald trump
“I don’t know who to believe” is the laziest shit I have heard and it always comes from people who won’t acknowledge that Trump habitually lies and they want to be on his side because they just want to hurt/be mean and engage in retaliatory politics. Lazy bullshit.
Thank President Trump! Keep fighting! 👊🏻🇺🇸👊🏻

Anything to distract from the #COVID19 pandemic 157,729 deaths. Incompetence all around. How is your own state of TX doing? 179 new deaths. You need to talk about the Trump fascism. #ETTD
Is old Joe scared to debate President Trump?  Sure sounds that way.
And with Trump, you have to question is this all retribution for his Oklahoma City event where Tik Tok users reserved all of those tickets and didn't come. Trump's ego was bruised #ETTD

Republicans who have never accepted the incompetence and lack of leadership by Trump in the #COVID19 pandemic.  157,729 deaths. If Trump leaves the country like every business he has owned, it will be greatly diminished or owned by someone else. #ETTD
Lol... you’re utterly shameless. Trump has skyrocketed the debt with tax cuts for the wealthy and unrestrained spending his entire presidency. Now that it’s nearly over, suddenly you’re worried about the debt.
Not here in northeast indiana or nw ohio as near as i can tell. Trump flags, signs, American Flags, nothing biden anywhere. But you never know for sure get out the VOTE.
Do you think Jim Banks should represent #IN3 rather than Trump?
Comey, McCabe, Clapper, Evelyn Farkas and other Obama operatives said there was definitely evidence of Trump/Russia collusion. Behind closed doors "UNDER OATH" they all said there was no evidence of collusion.  How sick how these Obama officials lied

I agree with what your saying but sadly trump could have stoped it. He would of been the better man, just like Biden and Obama yet he didn’t. It’s like the health plan he has somewhere in the closet that will never come.
Jim, you may win in your safe district, but Trump will lose with or without you.  You will be in the minority until you are an old man, Jim.  No committee chairmanships.  No power positions.  Nobody will trust someone who blindly followed when elected to lead.  Out of power, Jim.
Trump is so irrational and incompetent to be president. If it wasn’t for his team our country would be more of a shit show then it already is.
Pres Trump.  I’m just a mid west nobody that makes about 75,000 a year.  I do not trust people but so far you have proved me wrong.   Please help us.  Military kids and American flag loving.   History can not be erased but learned from.  I can go on and on.

If fmr V.P.  doesn’t have the courage to show up and debate   then why should voters show up for him? If Biden backs down Trump should go and leave Biden’s empty podium on stage to show voters who will stand up for them. #Debate2020 #Debates #Debate
Basic known FACT: Trump hates that a beautiful man of color is SMARTER, MORE PROFESSIONAL and 100% more loved. How else do you explain his constant competition with Obama ?? WTF

It’s a simple pick, lesser of two evils. Biden will at least run this country like a president should. Trump is running it like all his businesses straight to the ground. To your point Trump could  have ended the cages thus proving to be better but he didn’t. There all corrupt.

I 100% guarantee that this is a stock image mockup and these ladies have no idea their image is being used in a Trump ad.
Indiana &amp; Proud!!!  Trump 2020!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻✝️💙
But  doing things correctly won't give the lying "win" about vaccines that Trump needs.
It a joke because that's the average flu deaths every year. We have more deaths from car accidents should we all stop driving. More babies are killed by abortion every year. You are afraid because you are told to be by people who want Trump out.
The problem is that this is the last ditch attempt to get Trump out and it to will fail.
Hey Scott you want to come to Indiana I am more than willing to help. I have tried posting and made it known I'm willing to help get folks registered to vote and how important it is for President Trump to be re-elected.
But Trump is sitting at the dinner table with a country that put bounties on r soldiers heads.  I don’t think anything is worse then that
True but not everybody supports the old ways. I support BLM and I’ll continue to support it. Yes their r some stuff bout it I don’t support. Just like I support Trump but there some stuff he does I don’t support
Let me ask u this how did you feel bout Russian putting bounty on r troops heads and Trump just ignores it and continue to try and break bread with Russian.
Thought trump was shutting down TikTok 🥺🥺🥺
Trump had a lot of enablers and they must pay the price!
Pretty sure national security is part of his job description. .
Trump 2020!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💙🎈🎈🎈
Watching your show!  Keep it going!!  Trump 2020!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💙👏👏👏👏
I think the dinosaur would vote for Trump. That is big oil, right? He has made steps to rape our environment for big oil.
I think the problem might be that the color is wrong. Has anyone offered Trump an orange face mask?
She must be kicked out because of her crimes!!! To say, oh we will wait and let the election get rid of her is stupid!!! She could very well win again because she's a hero to many democrats because of her hatred of Trump!!! This is about broken laws not her popularity!!!
things trump should care about :  the literal global pandemic the US can’t seem to figure out.  racism within our country.  children in cages at the border.  what he actually cares about:  banning tiktok because it’s a chinese app.....
Dagen you are the best!  You are one of the only good ones we have left!  Stay firm my friend!!  Trump 2020!  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸✝️  Hope you are doing well after the loss of your sweet Mother!!🥰🙏🏻✝️💙
Nah fuck that trump is a piece of shit and can’t banned everything from China
For those who don’t know just do what India did   Change the region in your phone from us to uk   Becuase trump is banning tiktok Saturday #tiktokban
Wasn't originally planning on voting for Biden, but the more I think about how ravaged the judiciary will be with 4 more years of Trump, and how at the very least a public option is an improvement, I'm willing to pull the lever for him, as much as I don't want to. #Biden2020
Trump and DeVos’s Plan to Reopen Schools Hides a Sinister Agenda by Peter Montague
Seriously Rudy, but then if anyone knew about propaganda it would be you and your Trump gang!
I'll never understand why so many conservative politicians break their backs to carry water for Trump.
Mother May EyeI has my allegiance so Let's talk about faith in Trump....  via
How sad it must feel to “wake up” every day afraid of a Trump sign...😂😂😂
I typically vote R or libertarian.  So no, my third party vote is NOT a vote for trump.
Omg this is so sad! I cant stand Trump and his supporters can be a pain in the ass but this is senseless
Trump and his cronies are stealing so much money from the American people, I wonder how much of it is going to Russia, and how much of that is being used by Russia to pay the taliban to kill our soldiers.
Let’s be real, I would knowingly walk into a room filled with people who tested positive for Covid with active symptoms to vote against Trump!
Struggling to think of a single good thing that has come out of the Trump presidency.
Absolutely, Mr. President!!  Trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻✝️👏👏👏👏
Your family is actively trying to dismantle this country.  Do you actually think we would focus on Hunter Biden and not on the blatant criminal acts coming from the Trump camp?
He's a joke!!! Like Trump never achieved the best unemployment figures ever!
This is Trump making good on his promise. Don’t wanna pay your tab? Fine. Don’t come calling us when your getting your shit pushed in Merkel.
There it is lol. Fuck Donald Trump and anyone who stands with him
They hate the same things the Trump hates. This makes them believe he is good as they have the same person or group to blame. Typical cult operations.Trump Tower Yellowstone.
'Stunning': Dr. Gupta reacts to video at Trump's club
Colombia will be buy it a half of there communist country
Jfc..I know the vast majority of Trump supporters are ignorant miscreants so save your dime store sleight of hand bullshit for the droolers on Facebook and Parler. The vast majority of us non-Trump supporters don't have time for this imbecillic shit.
This isn't a dictatorship Trump and you can't stop people from going on that site even with your stupid executive order.
Another "democratic hoax" he likes tossing that around
We're all being lied to by people on TV? Meanwhile where did you hear there were supplies being hoarded? 🤔  I actually saw their people and government begging for help and trump saying no.
Why is it big news? Obamacare/ACA already took care of that. Also, Trump’s own DOJ is in court trying to undo it.
WHY WOULD HE DO IT WELL BECAUSE JE OT CAUGHT USING RUSSIA TO WIN THE ELECTION IN HOPES YU OLD VOTE FOR HIM...
China virus was under control.  We are now dealing with the trump virus, Covid-19 + stupidity of your cult=trump virus.
Crazy how many people call this ho "madam president" in the comments, yet blame trump for not accepting the results of an election
WTF? REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE. WE ALL KNOW HE IS CHEATING NOW YOU HAVE YOUR PROOF. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SICK OF THIS GARBAGE. HE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED..NOW!!!
I was just looking to see if I knew anyone. Whew 😅 Most everyone I know has always  despised trump.
Cite CNN and an article that quotes Schumer. Lmao. The democrats are absolutely preventing this to cast a negitive light on the r's who have negotiatited in good faith all to try to prevent Trump from getting reelected. It's so obvious but yet the left keeps ignoring it.
Anyone else notice, trump has a type?
Fox will do anything to help Trump. Even keeping him off the air.
The media will not stop doing this. They want a Trump second term. Expect them to bolster Trump and undercut Biden the rest of the way.  Guaranteed.
And as always, House Democratic leadership is too weak, feckless, and impotent to a damn thing about it. Trump and his henchmen abuse their power daily, and nothing, *nothing* is ever done to stop it.
Maybe this is the thighland that trump speaks of? 🤷🏼‍♂️
Worth pointing out that some guy responded and correctly predicted 4 years early that Trump would run for president.
You mean the trump party? Yup
American Bridge posts 1,043-page Trump oppo book online   just the beginning of many dominoes #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpIsALaughingStock
“While I certainly have a good relationship with the president of the US, the notion that I would ever make decisions regarding the Postal Service at the direction of the president or anyone else in the administration is wholly off base,” DeJoy said.
.... another  grifter.... trump trash in a fancier package.....
Scott is a TOTAL JERK💩💩!!!MAKES ME 🤢🤢 🤮🤮🤮!!!!  TRUMP 2020, BEST POTUS EVER🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I thought it was just another hoax. This should have been done by trump a long time ago!
Yeah, trump’s great economic prowess is unraveling. Find another job while you can, Kayleigh.
🚨 HUGE NEWS 🚨 Obamacare still exsists and Trump has forgotten because he’s unwell and pathetic suck ups like  and  are pretending their dear leader finally accomplished SOMETHING. #TrumpIsALaughingStock #Obamacare #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
After Trump is gone and MILLIONS of us will crawl over broken glass to defeat him, have you thought about your next career trajectory??
Only your base is stupid enough to take this bait. Trump’s in court trying to kill this protection in the ACA. You people lie as easily as you take a breath.
What if Trump called a news conference and nobody came? You all are just being used as a punching bad for a mini rally. There is no news to report that you couldn’t get somewhere else. Stop enabling him.
Hey law and order crowd, executive orders aren’t laws.  The insurance companies don’t have to comply. Congress passes laws, not emperor Trump. Remember when Obama passed executive orders and the right went ballistic calling him a tyrant. Remember that? lol ah karma.
No one. Maybe Trump.
I Follow Back Quickly. Hans.
Let’s play “who really said it” Tony Soprano or Donald Trump? #DonaldTrump
Yes, I can...I honestly HATE TRUMP
He built trump tower, every other business was a failure until his business became his name. He loans his name out to other builders. He builds nothing. He’s a con man
Lies Lies Lies. Wake Up. Trump 2020. ❤️❤️❤️
We are fighting facisim and racism and bigotry globally. Trump is not an anomoly. He is a symptom.
How many Americans perished from the Trump Virus during this pep rally? And he calls the PRESS “killers”?
It did REACH his desk and tRump did nothing about it,all he cared about was winning the election! How sad
In other words: #DemocraticParty idea. Only not permanent.  #Trump2020 #tRump #studentloans #TrumpHasNoPlan #Democrats
No surprise (of course illegal), because Trump acknowledged on national TV that he would accept foreign help. He and the  know it’s their (only?) hope to not lose in a landslide.
In a word: #Obamacare. #MedicareForAll #TrumpHasNoPlan #Trump #healthcare
Wait, you're saying Trump lied? No way. Not Trump.
Trump supporters: "I like Trump because he's fighting for the little guy, like me."
trump just now, on virus:  "It's disappearing. It's going to disappear."
complicit in #trump lies from his private business.
I'd love some actual proof that trump told the truth about something and was wrongly called out for lying, just for a change. When government starts blaming the press and demonizing them we have fascism.
China prefers Trump because they know they can get what they want from him though good old fashioned bribery. No additional effort required.
This will be nothing more than a mini trump rally ON THE TAXPAYER'S DIME.  #UnfitToBePresident  #TrumpCrimeSyndicate
How much is it to attend? What’s Trump’s cut?
Thanks Doc🙂 Appreciate the mention. Can I add my brother in law too  to this? He Fvckin hates trump too 👍
If where pictures of unzipped pants they draw the line, let’s get one of Trump. Problem solved! (?)
YES! No more hired hoodlums and yes man! Out with all these people Trump put in powerful and influential positions!
I hear them say Trump has done so much and I say what has he done for you and they can't answer.
*I* am God, emperor Trump
What a stupid question to ask, of course it's not ,look at the mess this moron Trump has got us in, people dead, no jobs for some, eviction for others, no food ,no money, no pleasure, it's a total disgrace what he's done for this country.
How many Americans have died &amp; will die because our public health officials in #trump- #Pence admin are COWARDS?
Scared to go himself so he's sending Pence. LOSER TRUMP !!!!
"Schism." That one alone could give Trump an aneurysm.
You say Russia and Trump, but I'm hearing WHAT ABOUT HER EMAILS?
Sad thing is, many of those tens of millions of Americans will continue right on voting for Trump and the GOP.  America, 2020.
During the Covid presser today Doc Levine spoke about “caution fatigue.” Fatigue from mask wearing, physical distancing, hand washing, etc.  I have it. I have caution fatigue. No amount of “doing things” helps me. I hate this pandemic &amp; I hate Trump so fucking much.
So is this where they draw the line? If so, can we get a picture of Trump with his pants unzipped? At this point, I’m willing to deal with having to look at it, if it gets him lose the “evangelical” vote...
Drone strikes have increased under Trump.
How about Trump tower in New York, what a reception he would get there, lol !
So is this where they draw the line? If so, can we get a picture of Trump with his pants unzipped?
Well, Trump should know by now that I am Not #Feeble,
To all of those saying that the pandemic is not Trump’s fault: his utterly incompetent and counter-productive response is! It didn’t have to be this bad! The proof is in how other countries did! He (and his enablers) own this!
And cancel culture isn't a thing lol...Either way isn't it sad that we all have so little faith in our own election system that we feel like doing this kinda stuff is even necessary? Even before Trump the whole system was shady. But hey, us Americans seem to be easily distracted.
I want to know how Barr and trump and all their toadies are all over the place without masks and don’t get sick.
So I’m just thinking about the pics I’ve seen of really overweight white men with guns and trump tshirts- and I’m pretty sure none of these guys has ever dieted or trained for an athletic event- unless you count Fortnite or Grand Theft Auto ?
Trump will probably make him his personal pastor.
Trump is not the anti christ, if by no other reasoning than the antichrist will be well liked by everyone lol.
Stay true President trump!!
Many choices. Trump, Miller, Bannon, take your pick...
If Trump isn’t putting a tariff on cocaine why does Rob Ford care?
If I was a kid my Fox News dad would sacrifice me on the alter of trump.
Can’t wait to see little Barron Trump with his backpack and hazmat suit head off to private school from wherever he and Melania are living, cuz we know it isn’t the White House!
Can someone tell me why this guy didn’t run for President? I love  but  should be elevated to a position where he can fix what tRump has decimated
Weird that you highlight Russia doing things to hurt Biden but don’t mention that China and Iran are doing anything they can to hurt Trump. Biased-much?
Incorrect. According to Trump and the GOP, there's nothing wrong if *they* do it. But if a Democrat does it, there would be hell to pay.  In other words, per the GOP, "If you're a Republican, they let you do it."
Are you writing for the Onion? Because this tweet is your fantasy. We are smart enough and cosmopolitan enough to recognize a kiss ass when we see him and an idiot like Trump when we see him.
Trump doesnt like wp because of Bezo. He ownes amazon and doesnt write nice things about the wanna be dictator. Doesnt make them fake, ever.  Facism 101, discredit the press, worked on you.
Amazing how when there is anything about trump you idiots dont like it's fake news, but it didn't exist until he was in office. You'll swallow anything that racist Moron tells you. There are actual facts in the article you can look them up, unless that's too much work
Perhaps a glimmer left? I’m worried about Republican State legislators deciding when to stop counting ballots after Nov 3rd, basically deciding the electors (for Trump).  We really need a BLUE WAVE!!
This will continue to be the case, and will get worse as we near the election. The vast majority of MSM wants a second Trump term. Expect them to report accordingly.
Trump should give her a freedom medal
Even greater Corona virus numbers- 160,000 and counting.  Great job tRump. #25thAmendmentNow
U r the puppet, u r the puppet...hehehehe Remember this? That was trump at debates!!! The fvcking moron is about 6 yrs old stupid kid who also bullies other kids but hides when it comes to fight! Chicken shit President!
So yeah, Biden is an arrogant POS who things POC owe him their vote BUT Trump is now doing the same and telling Black people who they are “obligated” to vote for.
Yes, the Trump campaign will treat anyone else with kid gloves... This is a dumb take, sorry.
it makes sense from a cult perspective. The most fanatical gun types are also the same ones who watch Faux News incessantly, believe everyone (including baby refugees from Mexico) is out to get them, and think Trump is God.
Facebook, Twitter remove Trump video that claimed children are 'almost immune' to Covid-19
good piece, but i think one of the reasons Trump has been unable to speak about an agenda is that he's losing his ability to speak, period. It seems more and more evident that he is sliding into dementia.
Honestly I believe Trump up by 6 in Texas more then I believe Biden up in Texas. Texas will be a purple state at some point, but I honestly don't see it in 2020.
The parallels between the way the far-left thinks about Trump and the way Palestinian leadership thinks about Israel (ie responsible for everything bad in the universe) grow by the day. They too can only argue against terrorism on the grounds it hurts The Cause.
WRONG. The left attacked him in Jan for this:
And yeh, what he is saying is if Donald Trump had pulled his head out of his ass back in Feb, we would not be in the economic situation we are in now, due to Trump's blundering through this national emergency.
Trump didn't even START to get serious about the Pandemic until it was a roaring mess. Before then it was "Magically going to disappear". Keep making excuses for an asshole that really could give two shits for you, or any other supporter? You think Trump cares if you live or die?
He isn't bitching about job loss. He is bitching about a POTUS who called it quits 3 mos. ago because COVID bored him. Trump bitched and bitched about states not reopening, so what did the idiots in red states do? Open BEFORE they were ready.
In other words, Trump is a "coastal elite" that his supporters always rail against?  Is that what you're saying?
Hey, joe is famous for his gaffes so this is nothing new. And nothing compared to the terrible things Trump has said.
Well thats just lazy and ignorant. Heres 3, took 10secs on google. Counter terrorist act Violent control act Campaign reform act.   Heres a link to WP article a out Obama's H1N1 response, you like trump are just wrong. Theres even a video so you dont have to read too much.
Good grief,  asking sexist  about #JoeBiden’s comment on diversity &amp; he was “shocked” by answers from POC 🙄... then he mitigates #trump’s racist comments  as “unfiltered” #MAGA❤️...  continues to have a WHITE MALE PRIVILEGE PROBLEM. Unwatchable.
Cuomo does what science tells him not Trump.
#trump &amp; #pence want us to die, there is no other explanation.   #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteTrumpOut   #VoteJoeBiden2020
I am with you about Trump! GOP and the crooks in his administration are trying to make him look good, but he is an Embarrassment! Trump needs to RESIGN NOW!
So when's the appeal?  We all know the drill by now. Court rules against Trump.  Trump appeals endlessly.
So, you will vote for trump if you don't like who Biden picks? What is wrong with you?
The thing that will baffle them the most is the normalization of all this, and the fact that Trump still polls around 40 percent. In other words, historians will be much more baffled by America than by Trump.
There's a reason why Trump wants to sabotage the U.S. Postal Service. In a pandemic, people need mail-in ballots.  If the mail is delayed, as Trump is doing, fewer people will vote. If fewer people vote, Trump can win the election.  Support the post office. Support democracy.
Warren is going to be a very important leader the next four years, regardless of the position she has. We desperately need her ideas and guidance to rebuild what Trump has destroyed.
Well I dont have enough characters to actually list all the bills he wrote, co-wrote to help Americans. I can tell you that the 30sec Google search gave me a ton to read, Trump, not so much. And Obama's pandemic response was good. But 45 through out the book, cuz hes an idiot.
This big man baby trump is resentful at a bunch of kids who messed up his rally, that's what this is all about.
I’m pretty sure that the Republicans want the stimulus talks to fail and are causing it to happen. Then trump can “save the day” by writing some insane EO to give people money.  Essentially, making it look like he cares but the others don’t.  Utter bullshit, but sure.
Amazing how little these actually speak the truth. Unfortunately, 3 months into his 1st term O had to deal with H1N1, 12k people died in 1 year.  Trump had 3 years, 160k dead in 8months. Trump has been accused of multiple assaults, paid porn stars, etc. Maybe change the channel?
The conceptual center of Republicanism isn’t Reagan...it’s Rush Limbaugh. Where Do Republicans Go From Here?
I was a working class kid who went to Andover, Georgetown, Tufts and Yale (without having anyone take my SAT for me), who has lived abroad for extended periods. Trump's a fraud. And so are you. Unfortunately, you are both very familiar, and money can't cover your stink.
Feels like you’re hoping to catch me in a mindless “her der TRUMP DA BESTEST EVER” moment.    Didn’t like Killary or Trump I’m 2016. Not really loving Trump vs. Biden in 2020.
hey dinesh, do most americans also say yo-semites or is it just possible that trump has difficulty reading and this is a really dumb thing to try to defend for days and days
🙄🙄 where’s full humble public apology to  &amp; her husband by   ? Probably in same place with #Trump’s apology to the Obama family for his repugnant Birtherism.   No person of conscience willingly works for, supports or associates with Trump
Trump supporters
Oh, if we all could measure up to trump's unprecedented sophistication.
this entire line of defense from dinesh is so surreal  why bother even trying to defend trump flubbing words  he just said yo-semites
If Trump actually banned league of legends it would be one of the only good things he has done for this country
#trump is killing our children.
. .  #BreakingNews   ... uh ... not really, we knew this about our . , right?  "We used to only think of Kim Jong Un as unpredictable. Now we had . as unpredictable"
I disagree.  I think it’s clear that a conflict has been constructed and reinforced by the media.  Why else do you think he’s receiving death threats and his entire family needs security? The long arm of the media’s narrative, in my opinion. Going after Trump only makes it worse.
“They blame his death and the deaths of all the other innocent people on Trump, Abbott and all of the politicians who did not take this pandemic seriously” “people who refuse to wear masks “ignorant, self-centered and selfish,” and included this warning: “May karma find you all.”
Once I see just one ruling that results in immediate public facing detail on Trump’s criminal activities, I’ll start believing in the justice system again. Until then, I’ll stay skeptical and frustrated.
You made it political by sucking up to Trump
Translation: I'm cool with 4 more years of Trump if I'm not completely in agreement with the Dem ticket. I'm so privileged that I'll be fine with 4 more years of chaos, so fuck all of you.  It's a rough translation....
Dumfahk.  Trump is in court trying to take away Healthcare for millions
on my way to work i spotted a car parked on a street in town with million dollar houses on it with the bumper stickers “trump 2020” and “vote democrat stay poor” and i
Dinner D’Supper would like us all to know that Trump is very sophisticated. No, really.
I see lots of signs for local races and more BLM &amp; Giant Meteor signs/stickers than Joe/Trump signs.
Hell, if they have enough gas.
I haven't decided who I'm voting for yet, but that's been the best reason I've found to base a decision around the election. Biden is probably the single worst possible option to oppose Trump (except maybe Hillary), but a Biden White House might allow for a party realignment.
It does - if ‘never’ means until all Tea Partiers and Trump-enablers are purged from the once-respected party they perverted and defiled.  Once accomplished, we’ll see whether we have a Phoenix rising from the ashes OR just the ashes.
Because Trump knows more than the experts? And if they don’t listen, they’ll get new „experts.“ All of this will result in more sickness and deaths and delayed safe return to some level of normalcy. I’m so tired of this! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
has a mental illness but that is not the reason for his love of #Trump’s evil. THAT IS PURE UNMITIGATED GREED. #KanyeWest is NOBODY’s friend &amp; he is complicit in the deaths of Americans from #COVID19.   He is no better than the rest of #MAGAts lying for Trump.
Yes my friend. The GOP is getting to abandon Trump, just like rats jumping ship! The more the people see and hear the more are running away!
Quiros’ condo at the formerly known #Trump Place on sale for $2.2 million in 2019  Quiros set to enter guilty pleas in EB-5 fraud case in 2020  .  .  #vtpoli   #BirdsOfAFeather?   #AmericaOrTrump
I believe you are right! GOP is just using trump, as is most of the people around him!
Trump fluffer.
That was anti Trump and pro LG. We are all good. My Whirlpool made appliance shit the bed.  told me buy LG. #Costco said we give you free 2 year warranty extension. I was like buy buy buy!
Right now? I'm afraid so.  We won't have normal till the GOP has been tamed and Trump is somewhere he can no longer harm people
... please tweet out  apology to #CentralPark5 &amp; the #Obama’s ... basically all non old white men🙄.   humbly apologized but media enjoys helping #Trump. ... Remember when media gave  a pass on “racism ended with Obama”?
Well he lost my business, I deleted it last night, couldn't stand anymore of Trump's lies on there, his campaigning on there took me over the top.
... seriously when will media demand answers to why  got a patent for voting machines? The conditions in her sweatshops in China? #trump is all in for the #TrumpCrimeFamily- #China relationship &amp; we clearly have no idea what National Security issues there are.
Please don’t allow Trump to cut payroll taxes. This will open the door to defunding Social Security, Medicaid, SNAP, etc. This has long been a Republican goal. Tisa Farrow in Vermont
I’m sure they’ll all be screaming about the deficit when Biden is president but the goal is to get rid of trump. I have no expectations.
Please don’t allow Trump to cut the payroll tax by executive fiat. This is a thinly veiled attempt to open the door to defunding Social Security, Medicaid, SNAP, etc. This has been Republican goal for a long time. Tisa Farrow
Please use your voice block Trump from cutting the payroll tax. This is a thinly veiled attempt to open the door to defunding Social Security, Medicaid, SNAP, etc. - long a goal of Republican lawmakers. Tisa in Rutland
Please don’t allow Trump to cut the payroll tax by executive fiat. This a thinly veiled attempt to open the door for defunding Social Security, Medicaid, SNAP, etc. - long a Republican goal. Tisa in Rutland
Joe Biden just needs to stop talking altogether and let Trump derail himself.
Rep. Welch, please don’t let Trump cut the payroll tax by executive fiat. This a thinly veiled tactic to open the door for defunding Social Security, Medicaid, SNAP, etc - long a Republican goal. Tisa in Rutland
Please don’t allow Trump to cut the payroll tax through executive fiat. This would open the door for defunding Social Security, Medicaid, SNAP, etc. This has been a Republican goal for a long tome. Tisa in Rutland
Ah... I pictured younger but that makes more sense for the scenario.  Pre-puberty, it’d be Trump. Post, 100% not Epstein. It’d be a harder decision. If 15-18 then Biden, if 12-14 Trump maybe
Like he would probably just do not a lot of anything because he’s a lazy arse. I’d expect he’d just sit their rambling about himself and conspiracies and would look crazy.  Biden, would certainly sniff their hair and touch them uncomfortably (not to say Trump wouldn’t tho)
How old is the child though?  Biden has been seen being weird with kids of all ages (so definitely not). Epstein and Trump target(ed) teenagers. I for some reason feel like generally speaking Trump would less likely say/do something sexual than the rest.
Just like Trump's 2016 campaign strategy...and it worked.
jfc. Why do candidates always have to be exciting? I want good people who have good skills; I could care less about charisma. if all we care about is exciting, isn't that how we get folks like Trump??
The fact that you took the time to type this out is TRULY PATHETIC. Wow.🙄
Yes, ignoring the polls is step one in electing Biden! Polls do not account for voter suppression, voter intimidation, foreign interference, and a multitude of other illegal schemes Trump and his enablers will employ! Step two is VOTE!!
Remember that one time a wounded vet gave your husband a Purple Heart. And he said he always wanted one, and accepting it as a gift was much easier than earning it. You know - because he was a draft dodger and all.
Why is trump going after TickTock so hard? Because a bunch of teenagers embarrassed him?! What a petty fool!
That proves To Me The Commie Democrats Are Trying To Ruin America, Anyway possible!They Always Pick Criminals To Run For President, Hillary Was the Commie Democrats Shoe In Criminal! The Commie Democrats Still Cannot Accept POTUSA Trump For The Win Over Her! Dems hold grudges🇦🇴☪️
Trump needs to go to jail.
Of course it is a lie, remind me the last time Trump told the truth.  I'll wait....
Lol. You think Jim Acosta will help you fix the usps problem Trump made..?!? I literally cant. Grow a brain
Perfect illustration of why we have almost 160,000 dead fellow Americans within five months &amp; about 5 million Americans infected with #COVID19. The trump-mcconnell- death cult/political party is telling us they want to do more! #vtpoli #NotMeUs
Every minute or so a person in the United States is killed by Trump &amp; Co.
White male privilege rears its ugly head again. It's easy for you to make it a single-issue problem, but millions of Americans are suffering, and your helping get Trump reelected is only going to make things worse.
The America we loved years ago and was on a trajectory of progressive change could die forever if Trump has 4 more years, i fear we would never recover from his tyranny..
155,000 dead fellow Americans in five months; 4.5+ million infected with #COVID19 - brought to you by trump-mcconnell- death cult/political party. And the #gop says they're not done with us yet! Still carrying that "R" next to your name? #vtpoli #NotMeUs #FridayMorning
It’s clear: Trump prohibits young people from freely voicing their opinion in a way they like (and he doesn’t). Make no mistake: this is just the beginning. I hope young people will respond accordingly and vote him out!
Yeah, I get it. He's old, he has a stutter. He's less sharp than he was. However, unlike Trump, he will (a) work hard and (b) surround himself with experienced and qualified advisors. I'm OK with that. I wanted EZ. I'll happily vote Biden.
Further, if you find out that the NRA has misused your dues for fancy vacations and private flights but you're mad at Tish James instead of the NRA, you are probably a Trump voter.
I could add that calling out Biden as senile is a Trump campaign strategy, amplified by PhotoShopped photos and creative editing. But, as you have demonstrated, it works on some people.
Happened four years ago to me, it’s why I left Facebook. It was called the Trump Campaign at that time.
“But hey, cruelty and financial mismanagement? That’s practically the Trump brand.”
Repeating the 2016 bullshit, how about all the abhorrent Trump behavior 🦗🦗🦗
he has a stutter. Trump as temporofrontal dementia. look it up.
I am not a person of faith, but still hold true to all it means to be a Christian because it is good.   Trump is not a believer either.   He is a user of others faith. The ultimate cheater. A true agent of evil.   The ultimate sinner.
I never claimed it was? Were you replying to someone else? I only referenced NYC because the bonehead trying to claim the death toll is so high because of the 23k dead in NYC due to that idiot Cuomo. I was telling him that this is a national issue &amp; Trump FAILED to manage it.
TFW you are trying to run a get out the vote effort but you spent a decade of your adult life not voting.  Not even in 2016. We are here, in Trump's America, because liberals like Molly stayed home. #vtpoli

Is it possible Trump doesn’t know the preexisting condition provision that was included in Obamacare also applies to ALL commercial and Employerr plans? His followers may really think he gave them something they didn’t already have.
Read this. Oops, I take that back, have one of your assistants read it to you.
The house had all of that ready in May &amp; it’s been sitting on #MoscowMitch desk since May,he wouldn’t let Congress vote on it so trump “could play Superman” to his uneducated base #WakeUp
Yeah absolutely not but schools have the power to threaten them into sending them by fining them or sending the kid to juvey Hopefully we see leniency with this but with trump yelling about covid being “not that bad” I doubt we will.
Yeah, so terrible that Trump forced all 5 of the Democrat run states that account for the majority of Covid deaths to inact policies like forcing elderly positive patients in nursing homes. Shill harder, no ones believe you.
I found more Catholics than you did that agree with Trump. Now what??

You must have missed the EO Trump just announced. Unplug from CNN and leave your buble sometimes.
I always ask Trumpers why? Why trump? And I NEVER get a response. They literally have nothing.
Well, given your profile name nobody is surprised you’d say that. And to go further, why does everybody blame Trump of the virus?? Y’all forget, or just don’t care, that the Dems CODONED our great President when he made moves. Y’all said he was being an xenophobic 🤷‍♀️
Agreed! Trump does exactly what he says he’ll do! He’s probably not the best spoken president but he’s hands down the best president!!    Trump2020
Vote for tRump, get DeVos. Shameful. She’s a mess. She’s been against public education almost her whole adult life.
The intel report that was referenced stated that China wants trump out. The report also (supposedly) references China's activities.
Trump has already reversed failsafes that protect our lands, our animals and our oceans.  He has done this for big money.  We can't let him destroy the Grand Canyon and the American Indians that live on the land.  Trump has done more to destroy this country's environment.....
all that plus them supporting Trump during a pandemic means Republicans don’t even care about the well-being of the state itself. When Republicans are disinterested in the well-being of the state we are way passed a point
At this point, the only people listening to trump are in his 30% base. Oh...and Russia.  Now, if Russia is for trump and China/Iran are for Biden...I say China/Iran will win the election.  Yes folks - I'm not sure this election belongs to us.   I am furious and disgusted and sad.
DO YOU SUPPORT President Trump? Do you denounce domestic terrorist like ANTIFA and BLM?
What will  do when Trump signs the EO to end Tik-Tok?!  Sorry, what will WE do?! 😥😥😥
Banking on Trump signing an EO that keeps the additional weekly unemployment amount near $600.   Pure campaigning. Buying votes.
As long as  sticks to his message he will be fine. Joe has not succumbed to wrestling in the mud with pig trump.
Chris Wallace is awful n he is a Liberal n what he says on Fox is ridiculous...why would he say something that is a huge lie about Trump being racist...now Wallace knows this is not true...so heads up Chris..we know u r a hater of Trump..quit the falsehoods..we no when ur lying!!
A presidents' approval rating being low is not the same as wishing for a puppet government of the United States or a military coup.  I hate Trump. I would still be horrified if he were assassinated by a foreign government and a leader were to be installed by that government.
The difference is that trump will allow insurance companies to charge $1000 for a rider for a re-ex.
the point of that video was not to call Trump-voters sinners, but to let young and old people alike know that it’s okay to break from evangelical christian tradition and vote for a democrat rather than a conservative who does not represent the ideas of the american people anymore
President Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare
Daniel we are so damn lucky.  Trump will leave before the pandemic does.  Maybe more lives will be saved.
yes, he needs to take it immediately...he's to scared to then the Liberal plans would be blown up...he will never be a leader he is not capable...but the people behind this sham will run n ruin the country!!!!!!!!!!!!! VOTE TRUMP

Exactly why it is failing!  Trump should be coordinating a national response.  What we have is one country and 50+ different response plans.  We need 1 plan and 50+ different people responsible for executing that plan.

not saying its okay by any means. But its not new. Look up “What Are (Russian) Active Measures”   But trying to tie in a narrative that Trump is somehow working with them to do so is garbage  He may be benefitting from the Kremlins campaigns, doesnt mean theyre “working together”
I sure hope so! They've been around long enough to see how 2 sitting Presidents have dealt with difficult times. Many of them have shown they don't like Trump. Because of Trump there's a good chance they will make our country stronger and respected again. C'mon kids, do it!
what science, Chinese virus is all over the world,. Only trump vaccine will get rid of it.

Yes.  Trump has huge scandals and isn’t taking COVID seriously.  At least I’m certain Biden would do a better job at risk mitigation of COVID, with better national strategy.  COVID is my biggest issue now.
My prediction was that Trump would win the primary, lose the general, and destroy the  in the process. I hit two out of three.

Speak for yourself. I got my degree w/o cheating and didn't need to pay someone to take my SATs.  Trump is a phony.  He's less than everything he claims to be. He knows it.  That's why he's constantly bragging. Confident, secure people don't behave like him.
Trump is about to speak and try to appear the Robin Hood America needs during a pandemic.  Democrats handed him this moment. I am furious.

Unfortunately Repubs insist on stalling negotiations b/c they want to defund the post office, using tax $ to help Trump's hotel and martinis lunches. They don't give AF about working people. Repubs had NO PROBLEM exploding the deficit for tax cuts for the rich and corporations.
Only according to Trump.  Remember it was HE who has asked for help from BOTH countries.
Wish I would've tracked the work hours I've put in to adapt to the pandemic while not technically employed by my university/off contract this summer. Should've invoiced the Trump admin for them. Not that he pays his bills anyway.
Biden has never been president. I think he do a lot better than Trump.
This heifer said what?! 😡
They will if Trump gets reelected.
Good to know early in the election year how the GOP values our lives. Millions have lost jobs and businesses. They can't feed their families. They may have no rent or mortgage money, but thank goodness, trump can play golf. Our own "Let them eat cake" moment. Bye Don!
So you going to vote for Trump because if I didn't make some slip-ups and Trump is such a racist you do that and then you get everything you deserve
Are you talking about Trump or Biden because they both have made racist comments. Biden has a longer history of doing it. Either way, we are going to vote for a guy that has a reputation of making racist comments.
This is my general concern in regards to Trump vs. Biden, Trump is trying to label everyone protesting him as a dangerous terrorist, what's going to happen when he's not worried about a re-election?
The China Iran part is bogus news but Russia is still intent on cheating for Trump.

Rs are dragging their feet because they know Trump is a loss in November and they need to leverage all they can to move through any needed bills.  keep eyes on whats moving through Senate

Good grief have these people watched trump talk. He can’t get out a simple sentence.
If I knew, I wouldn’t be perplexed. Pence was not popular here—he was losing when Trump picked him.
Just a reminder that elections are not some sort of magic cure for our social problems. We've been the subject of a global social engineering experiment for many years.
Trump on Kim Jong Un visiting the White House 06/18 “He speaks and his people sit up in attention I want my people to do the same.”  You fill this role rather well for trump.
I read Republicans are stalling on purpose so Trump can do EOs at last minute and be a hero. Like thst makes up for this mess.
I think other counties saw how effective Russia was last time they saw a reason to do it also. All due to Trump allowing this.
Everytime I say Trump can’t get any dumber. He proves me wrong every time
Trump is a sociopath. Money doesn’t make him better, just less in touch with most of Americans. His education does not make him intelligent, which is evident by anything he says or tweets. He is a horrible human, that is destroying America, that is why there is hostility

I’ve read a lot about Abe Lincoln &amp; studied his speeches.  Despite Donald Trump’s claims, Donald Trump is no Abe Lincoln.    He’s more like Andrew Johnson - impeached, incompetent  interlopers who didn’t have the capacity to fill the shoes of the one who preceded them.

Donald Trump you should probably look at Joe biden's Church paper some really good shots in there you should do so right away though because after this tweet of course they'll try to do away with them all
All these things are about the trade war, nobody cares about tiktok "harming" Trump.  I doubt they're banning tiktok as a security risk, its more likely to reduce CCP propaganda on American youth.  If its sold to an American company problem resolved.
My Euro friends all think Trump’s a joke.
You are correct. These people haven't hit rock bottom. They haven't lost enough. If they continue to support Trump, more and more will start to realize it's not going to get better its only going to get worse. They don't care that Trump is a Traitor to the country.
For the memories:
Supporting Donald Trump at the dirt mall is the best metaphor I didn't have to think of.
Canada imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products is fully justified.  Trump's bullying and protectionism on behalf of price gouging U.S. corporations was no more than a criminal act.  Ideally, tariffs in any form should be banned Worldwide with no exceptions or excuses.
Its not even just Trump that thinks stifling free speech is not worth a Chinese market.  It is bipartisan that American companies should respect American values.
Wow! Trump, a guy born into riches who never faced a challenge, wished HE were born Black so he could have their “advantages”. This guy was racist even before the dementia. #TrumpIsLosing
I want to say that I hope the Trump followers that caught COVID and died don’t vote for him. But that sounds crass so maybe I won’t say that?
Trump is amazing in killing 160000 Americans with a projection close to 300000? 🤔 Please......
oh no .... do a Trump and blame someone else
If you're making $50k a year and spending $40k on your new truck... the economy is something you pretend to hold dear, but don't.  Only the ultra-wealthy Trump supporters care about their economy.
This is the guy the media non-stop said was the safe choice to beat Trump and they lambasted the guy who wants to give everyone healthcare, during a pandemic🤦🏼‍♂️
There won’t need to be a peaceful Transfer of Power until 2024.And then it will just be to His Son or Daughter.   #Trump #Dynasty
Trump and Biden are in a battle to see how many Black ppl they can make hate them during the election 🔥🔥🔥
Well um Trump um is um bad. How can he um i don't know. My sister is the love of um my life. Like that? Lol 🤣
For as much as the anti-Trump crowd likes to make fun of the pro-Trump crowd (and understandably so), they sure do love to latch onto their own conspiracy theory in which Trump is always one step away from going to prison, losing an election, etc.

If you vote for trump it’s on you. Trying  to Win over the right is not going to win us anything. C cup when did you become a moderate
UPDATE:  U.S. intelligence officials believe that Russia is using measures to denigrate presidential candidate Joe Biden ahead of the November election and that individuals linked to the Kremlin are boosting President Donald Trump’s reelection bid.
Democratic leaders launched a last-ditch effort to revive collapsing Washington talks on vital COVID-19 rescue money, summoning Trump administration negotiators to the Capitol on Friday in hopes of generating progress.
My grandparents voted for him, but the last 2 elections,  they were huge Obama supporters,  but then they voted for Trump, because they had some huge issue with Hillary.  I'd vote for an inanimate carbon rod before I'd vote for Trump
I will be voting also for Trump because he is a lot smarter than Biden ...Obama...Pelosi...n Shummer...and the names go on but this will be enough for a start
I truly believe the democrats have plans to cheat with the mail in voting and that is why they are raising the issue of Trump not leaving the white house. They are right in one way he shouldn't leave unless it can be proven Biden won 100%. No cheating.
#iBullshitYouNot   The Trump campaign sent a letter to the Debate Commission to ensure that Joe Biden would appear Live on Stage to Debate.  Check the address he used for Joe Biden
USPS is not a political toy. Trump et all are playing games in order to ensure that many eligible voters either don’t vote or risk their health to do so.
Rick Wilson is a Psychopath that gets himself off by attacking President Trump! #InstutionlizeRickWilson
Funny that you think trump has ever even read the Bible
Trump having never touched a gas pump, a mower or a washing machine doesn’t mean it’s our fault that he’s so disconnected. We understand that fully.
CNN is flooding Trump with every little thing they can. Doesn't matter if it's true or not.

Ms. Cupp, I watched your video today stating how opposed you are to Trump, but then also stated Biden's choice for VP would determine whether or not you voted for him. You are aware that a write-in vote helpsTrump, right? You need to vote Biden if you want Trump out. That simple.
Donna was winning about poor Joe being attacked. Well my goodness just stop and think about how bad Donald Trump has been attacked by the democrats on everything. So stop with the pity for COME ON MAN JOE.
U.S. intelligence has assessed that China is hoping President Donald Trump does not win reelection, Russia is working to denigrate Democrat Joe Biden and Iran is seeking to undermine democratic institutions.
Yes the whole world created a fake pandemic to make trump look bad. Damn I should’ve known
People who defend Trump pretty much only have opinions as evidence because they don’t depend on fact hence why they love that Q stuff.
Trump: no more Tik tok Instagram: 👀👀👀👀👀👀 itd be a shame if someone...you know.... took their concept. 👀👀👀👀😘
Lincoln 1865, reflecting on the Civil War: "there was always just enough virtue in this republic to save it; sometimes none to spare, but still enough to meet the emergency".    Trump is the greatest emergency to our republic since these words were spoken.
So you like spreading false information huh ... Obviously you didn’t read the Mueller report ... Clearly states Trump campaign didn’t do anything with Russia ...  But stupid people can’t handle facts ...
Trump is a poor man’s idea of a rich man.   A weak man’s idea of a strong man.   And a dumb man’s idea of a smart man.
Yet Trump swears he’s the best thing that ever happened to African-Americans. 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️🤮
Trump most definitely is not a Manhattan. They all hate his ass.
I thought maybe he was saying that Trump is that drink from the aughts that Carrie Bradshaw loved so much. (actual thing - when our buddy Steven Miller uses it, it is a weirdly coded reference to Jewish stereotype and Soros. I love to see if come out of Mr Bean's fingers)
Pretty slow day. Maybe I'll browse on over to Reddit and... oh... oh my

If the closing of Trump’s was so political how did the judge sign off on shutting it down? Get fucking real!
No one knows for sure how this is going to effect the voting.  Republicans think it will siphon minority and/or young votes from Biden.  There are just as likely discouraged R voters who don't like Trump, but won't vote for a Dem.
Everyone I know is voting for Trump because he’s smarter than the Biden clan.. n I do mean klan...one person I know is voting for Biden has no clue who would really run the country r evil as crap.. if u have a brain .. use it..vote Trump n let’s not be like Venezuela!!!!
my hot take is that what trump says bears little weight at all on process theology or traditional, and even contemporary uses of divine sovereignty. instead, it’s just him being an ass. Or, a title:   The Theology of Showing Your Ass
He's only a few hundred anti-black gaffes behind Trump.
What are the job prospects for someone like this after Trump loses? Big Oil/Tobacco flack?
I suspect that GOP Senate has decided that Trump will lose and possibly lose Senate so they have to go back to Tea Party basics and complain about government spending.  If they thought they might win, they'd spend everything to save economy
If you thought Trump people had to change their stance on a dime often, we'll see how this goes down, although at first all the 'no school' people are standing firm.
Psychopath Fake News Jim Acosta, the American people is going to re-elect President Trump anyway!
This is what congress is up to , thank god for trump to cancel this bill
Yes and I think he has unfinished business w/Russia (Putin)! I have felt all along that Trump is working with Putin to advance his company. Plus Trump gets most of their money fr Russia bc the US won’t lend to him anymore! So much corruption!
Trump just says stuff hoping the uninformed believe his lies.
Trump is a xenophobe. Daddy bought his way into Wharton, he’s not a billionaire, he’s committed crimes around the world. His base is poorer, less educated, &amp; many have not left their home states. No wonder he seems like such a genius to them. They view him as a white savior.
The only writing trump does is tweeting. You can tell trump doesn’t write his speeches because he reads like a 3rd grader who has to read out loud in front of the class and can’t pronounce what was wrote for him.
LOL Trump grew up in a 1%'er culture in NY man; don't make him out to be some child of a foreign service officer LOL
Wow. Really digging in on this, aren’t you? Odd battle to pick. Also you’re ignoring (inadvertently, I’m sure) the agonizingly obvious consideration that Trump is simply mind-bogglingly stupid
Ya, or maybe he can sniff some of Trump's adderall. Trump has been speaking so well lately. I'm sure he isn't declining mentally. He knows what elephants are.
Trump is pro vax...... I thought he was anti vax..... Killery isnt in jail?   He promised to do thet before the election...
It was a very valid statement. You come her asking me how I know, but we are literally commenting under a post that not only claims to know, but judges who Biden wants by his side.
And if you’re voting for trump you’re racist, xenophobic, homophobic, and you support rapists and sexual abusers
President Trump says "this may be the last time you see me for awhile"... that's a hell of an implication.
Yes, and I am almost positive that when MLK said those words he was talking about systemic racism. Democrats are not judging us, they’re give us a voice. While people should see character, it is also important that you recognize your white privilege as well.
😂😂 never did I say I cannot be racist, I most definitely said I am not racist. I love all races beautifully, and I acknowledge that all are very different in their cultures and in their heritage. You as a man who supports trump is already prejudice by default.
From here on let’s blame all social media trolling of the orange one on MySpace, just for giggles. It’ll be nice to see it be relevant for the first time in a decade and I look forward to Trump anger tweeting at Tom

As opposed to my fellow Republicans who think if they get a black rapper on the ballot, African-American voters will vote for him over a white Democrat and they'll help Trump!  At least Biden didn't call black voters stupid like those Trump-loving Republicans did.
People who make videos and hashtags like this secretly want Trump to win so they can keep making videos and hashtags like this for another four years.

And the fact that we can even stand and defend this decision when every media outlet and democrat criticized trump for ‘killing the children’ from COVID-19. And mind you, second wave is still coming so giving the lame excuse of positivity rate doesnt work.

Oh no, please don’t tell me you’re one of those people that believe in that reverse racism crap.
Your comment made no sense sir. Studies show that minorities like to be considered different, nonetheless human. I want people to know I am a woman, and I am Latina, and I am black. I’m extremely prideful to be all of those things. I know where I come from, and I will never deny.
You really tried that one 😂😂😂😂 as a matter of fact, my mother is white and I do love her. As well as any human being on this earth.
That’s ALL it has to do with it 😂😂 racists believe that their race is superior to others. It most definitely matters. I never once said that I believe my race is superior, therefore, your argument is thrown out the window

This is a typical Trump official.  All con, zero facts.  All bullshit, zero science.  It’s like a traveling snake oil sales show.  Who’s the next sucker?
What a sham. I can’t believe you believe that in your heart.
Okay? Your point. Y’all will never admit that trump himself is a pedophile. Not to mention he’s raped and assaulted women as well. He is a womanizer. He is prejudice. And these are things he’s proven ON NATIONAL TV. So you literally can not deny it as much as you try.
Don’t be distracted. Joe is not a perfect candidate. Far from. And Kanye West openly acknowledges his role in running is to help trump. We’ve got a choice to continue with trumpism and chaos for the next four years or we can choose a one term president in Joe. Think big picture.
...was your daughter/mother/sister/niece you’d be very very quick to believe them and their trauma. If it was any other man who did this, and these woman came forward, let’s say someone like Obama, you’d be very very quick to believe them and their trauma. Check your morals.
I’m sorry.. are you calling these women liars?? Have you done any research on victims of sexual assault?? It does not matter if you come forward the same day or 10 years later, it does not invalidate what you have experienced and gone through. But it’s okay, I’m sure that if it..
"The purpose is to use this attack on the NRA to taint Donald Trump and Republicans ahead of the November election.”
You really love the taste of Trump's ass, don't you?  Come up for air dude.
Everyone already knew this but just to put this into context with Trump’s latest rant about god and religion.
Lol I did not vote for bill clintin, but I know you thought you did something there. I am well aware of bill clinton. How about you read the many court transcripts of woman, and children, testifying against trump in open court.
That explains both the support of Trump
I love how you point that out but don’t point out the countless women trump has sexually assaulted/raped, let’s not even talk about the young girls he’s abused. Find another argument.
Meanwhile, Christian Karen supports Trump legislating hate. WWJD ya dumb white bitch Karen??

That’s exactly what trump has done!!!!!! If he ever has considered having a woman, it was to prove away his sexism and prejudice.
That’s why they’re terrible. The Republican Party loves to take away the rights of those who are colored and different. The Democratic Party makes sure that everyone is heard and prideful of the differences within them.
We could literally say the same thing about Biden... come up with a new argument
Psshhh, he has no intention whatsoever to appoint them his VP. It’s all a look, a face for the public eye. The accusations that he’s been facing for racism most definitely did not start now. He’s been saying racist things for decades.
Ummmm because like any other president he leaked who he considered. And racist? Umm I am a black Latina sir 😂 and I also happen to be a woman so try again
I think they see trump as a means to an end. They thought trump would be so bad he'd cause a far left revolution but instead Democrats went with old school neo liberal so they are pissed
What’s Trump saying?
His argument? That the guy (Trump) who has actually been charged with raping kids isn’t the bad one.
Pretty sure he most definitely didn’t, and if he said he did, it was to turn the public eye away from his racism and prejudice.
That’s a terrible defense
Why isn't Bill Clinton, one of the fondling fathers, in prison? Why are democrats running another of the fondling fathers, Joe Biden, against Trump? Biden couldn't win against my dog, or any other dog for that matter
Rich people are a minority in the world. Trump has the support of the rich people because that’s the only people his policies have helped. The rest of the world hates him.
Trump can reflect for years in prison without regret. I know I  will suffer none.
I’ll bet you Trump wins the debate
OOPS I DID IT AGAIN:
Naw White Women who voted for Trump took care of that for the gender. Well behaved women rarely make history. And this is entertainment, dunce. Black women aren’t monolithic like yourself.
For the past 3+ years Trump, some of his family members, and the Senators in his back pocket have been stealing money meant to be used for other purposes. They've been stealing from children, special needs, seniors, and the medical community. They're greed will be documented.
tRUMP was mentioned how many times in the DOCUMENTARY???  More than any other person.
No serious campaign has spent money on getting a poll back to say what they want (the Trump campaign does, but I say again, no serious campaign). Internals that are leaked are leaked because they come back good. The leaking is the strategic decision, not the poll (3/)
Yet AGAIN...  You can follow Christ or Trump.   Not both.
lol. There are plenty videos out there of PEACEFUL PROTESTERS doing nothing to provoke anyone &amp; just holding signs that were gassed. A handful have lost eyes as a result, but you're just an ignorant Trump supporter, so you'd rather refuse actual facts &amp; go by Trump's lies instead
Atleast Biden has the humility to correct his mistakes and own up. Meanwhile trump is just a kicking and screaming child.
When reopening schools has been accepted as a HUGE  mistake,  TRUMP gets 100% of the blame.
Now is not the time to be complacent. Now is the time to get people out to vote. Fight for votes like those numbers are reversed. Nothing less than overwhelming numbers will defeat Trump, and even then he will cheat.
Clip was from 12 years ago. Proves Joe’s gaffes have been the same for years and there no mental decline. But Fox feels differently about Trump:
Its like Trump WANTS TO WIN, but he's losing.
Don't forget the 500 billion trump got on the stimulus to take care of all of us ...wait a minute  ... that may have went to him and his cronies without any oversight on our tax dollars. 500 billion  500 billion 500 billion let that sink in

I'm sure Candace Owens, Diamond and Silk and a host of black Trump supporters would subscribe to that as well. Their voices matter. But Fortunately, the voices of the majority of the Black community matter even more. BLM!
Trump is far from perfect. We dont need to point out his flaws, the left always does. I think people defend him so much bc 24/7 lies by media. I also truly believe he wants what's best for ALL and that most who hate him are caught up in the lies. I want them to see the truth.

As  launches Farmers for Trump, I’m reminded of one of the best Pence anecdotes from  bio. Pence often talks about growing up having looked at a cornfield in his back yard. But it was from a house in one of the newest, nicest neighborhoods in Columbus, Indiana.

I pray for the day Trump doesn’t have an outrageous sound byte that starts the evening news.  I pray for the day I don’t have to look at his smug unintelligent face every day.  I pray for the day I don’t see the #TrumpCrimeFamily anywhere except in handcuffs.
Just like I think a lot about how dystopian things are right now, and how much worse they would be if Trump had an ounce of competence (... Or if Pence was president).
Trump's military leaders hesitated to give him military options because they were afraid he'd start a war.  This is, literally, the same thing Hitler's generals did when Hitler wanted to work towards invading England.
We should be used to the  playing politics w/ kids, but this over top even for them. Schools are strapped for funding &amp; there’s a pandemic, but sure, take money from students because Trump is demanding schools open.   Prediction: The “savings” will go to private schools.
I honestly don’t know why I continue to get junk mail from Trump. Even if the GOP did anything good I am repulsed by his grifter approach, his lack of compassion, his bubba level of intellectual curiosity, his enablers, his lack of “we’re all Americans”. We are better than this
You are worried that trump may damage beyond repair institutions you hold dear? What institutions will the wrong veep pick damage beyond repair?  I'll wait for your answer.
"I know that four more years of Trump will further damage, possibly beyond repair, the institutions we hold so dear in this country."  You are willing to sacrifice those institutions over a veep pick.  That's petty.
Trump just needs to run adds showing Biden interviews and he will win.

Okay man. I'm not gonna debate terminology with you. You can dislike the term all you want. Doesn't make it any less true.   Trump, by definition, is an unpopular President. End of discussion.
Had Trump said these things, the replies would be outrage. Instead the left just yawns or just says who cares. The hypocrisy is such a joke. Why don’t they condemn this form of racism?
Oh, one thing, the pedo-thing... I’m no Clinton fan, but Trump has FAR closer ties to the pedo-king/queen than most.

“Take away your guns, take away your Second Amendment. No religion, no anything,” Trump said of Biden on Thursday. “Hurt the Bible. Hurt God. He’s against God. He’s against guns.”  This equating of God with guns is symptomatic of one the biggest problem with the American church.
She was "liked" by more voters than Trump. 🙄  And it's the 2nd time in my voting lifetime we've had an "unpopular" President. What part of the system do you think is working? Where the majority of voters don't have a voice.

A debate is not gonna change anyone’s vote , people will vote   to save America or vote Trump
Oddly enough Boris is backed by the same folks as Trump. The Mercer family. They used Cambridge Analytica to ratfuck Brexit and the 2016 US elections.  They are also using Breibart (cuz they own it) to spread disinfo from Russia....  Watch #TheGreatHack on Netflix

Ah, another useless executive order by the lying "reality" show clown. How about some real legislation? Thought trump mastered the art of the deal? Don't bother at this point.  Vote trump out, reverse all he has done, no presidential portrait.
And how is Trump going to save America?  Is it the way that he has been saving America with rampant out of control COVID numbers?  The US makes up 4% of the world's population, yet 25% of the world's cases and deaths.
Trump has a parallel economy running. We will move from the petrodollar to sound money(think gold! What price is gold at currently?). We are seeing indicators of this move with the treasury taking over the fed reserve earlier this spring. Moving away from the petro$ is a must!
Shouldn’t Trump be dealing with this pandemic and making it go away instead of taking away the only app that kids use during it? 😂 like gtfo
Here Is The BEST EVER Description Of The Trump Regime!
Oh I hope Trump wins too!!! Folks divorced but Pops did his thang that’s my guy!
No. If Trump ditches Pence, it’ll be for Ivanka. Nikki is too ambitious for Trump, which means he fears she’ll turn on him the second it becomes beneficial to do so. Not to mention Ivanka is the chosen successor.

“Mr. President, What Are Your Priorities?” Is Not a Tough Question Trump is running for reëlection, but, unlike four years ago, he can’t even say why.
It’s so obvious why Joe Biden isn’t ever going to debate President Trump!
Never trump? Then you're voting for Biden even if you hate trump if you vote Biden you might as well kiss America land of the free good bye and say welcome china
Um, they are aware that Trump is late to the TikTok banning party right? India banned a lot of this shit outright weeks ago.
Yeah they’re both incompetent, but trump acts like he was right the whole time, despite being proven wrong to his face.
Yep, you can waste your vote if you want to! Voting for neither Trump or Biden is basically the same thing as not voting at all.
When investigations find no wrongdoing, then they leave organizations untouched. That's what happened with the Clinton Foundation. (Trump's Foundation was, however, dissolved due to fraud.)   Does anyone really watch this quasi-Goebbels Network you're on?

Wanna think about how God views Trump? A literal PLAUGE fell upon the United States while he was president
when i was getting takin away in the ambulance the emt asked me questions to see if i was with it and he said “do you know who the president of the US is?” I said, “Unfortunately that would be Trump.” lmfao he said “okay i’ll take that.”

Trump hates and seeks to destroy any Authority outside of his control that could possibly bring him to Justice.
I know another thing he's not capable of...writing his own tweet!! Gezz. At least we know Trump does his own work
Unless it was just a bs story to avoid tRump.
lol  you thinking this isn’t connected to Trump
Same could be said about trump and family.
America was built upon an idea based on freedom and justice. Trump presidency was built on an idea based on authoritarianism.  Send the message: The US will NOT be run down by dictators, rulers or wannabe kings.  We will not surrender our democracy. Ever.
Look at the thousands of people not wearing mask or social distancing.  Lets see the counts in a about a week. How many will be dead? Why? So that tRump can have his rally.
trump is always whining about free speech: masks, flag, brietbart, etc. But when free speech means hate speech, targeting minorities, weak and disadvantaged, suppression is needed to maintain a civilized exchange of ideas free of hate, intimidation, racism and lies.
Mike Pence is right. Trump/Pence 2020!!
Whoa. Trump is being a fucking president right now.
I would turn your attention to when I explained I said trump was blantly racist and your response was, and I’m paraphrasing of course, well black cities have the high crime and poverty why do you blame that on Trump??? Just take a few moments of introspection my man see ya
Trump so worried about banning Tiktok but not the KKK or COVID
But I agree. Trump is an all timer villain.
By demanding schools open, trump is displaying a complete lack of regard for education as a whole.  With no national plan to mitigate and make schools safe for our teachers, administrators and students, trump is again choosing his political gain over safety of others.
Didnt Obama attack President Trump at Congressman Lewis's funeral?  Or did you just happen to forget that?
We’re living under a Trump presidency. There’s a lot we’ve experienced. 😬
i truly cannot believe i am related to a buncha trump supporters.... ew
at some point here soon the trump campaign is gonna realize all they have to do is not say anything and just wait to react to biden's constant stream of weird bigotry and the dems are gonna be embarrassed even harder than they were last time
I love how John Roberts presided over the trial of Donald Trump in which he was acquitted of crimes he and his lieutenants 100% committed, and the Vice President goes on record saying that Roberts is a “disappointment to conservatives”. They don’t even back their own. It’s chaos.
Trump says he 'heard' this was a bombing. His frequent use of the 'I heard' qualifier makes you wonder if his briefings are informed by gossip. It's really unsettling to hear this kind of language from the leader of the free world.

Correct, but it did help Trump win election. Lose; Lose

Why Trump's advisers feared he'd accidentally start a war
Liberals really believe they doing a thing when they dunk on trump. Then turn right around and say yes trump is right about china. 🤡
It has been different.  I can imagine how hard it must be for Trump to draw a contrast between himself and someone who rarely comes out of his house.  I understand why they don’t want Biden to come out but it definitely makes it hard to compare and contrast.

Humility? I'd shit myself if Trump used the word "monolith" this elegantly in a sentence.
I really think Trump is gonna try &amp; attack Joe with his family. My ❤️ hurts just thinking about it. The president of the US is a disgusting lunatic! Joe lost a wife &amp; daughter was a single dad and then lost a son! Married an intelligent women who loves him and his son;( I can’t!
I agree. Everything about him is reminiscent of the book of Revelation. A lot of what Revelation predicted has seemed to be coming true since he took office. The horsemen are here, in the form of Trump, Putin, and Kim Jong Un. Making a lot of people nervous.
I am sick that trump uses religion as a propaganda point.  He has demonstrated over his lifetime that religion is not something he values. To come after Biden, who is a devout Catholic, is reprehensible. His rhetoric is sacrilegious.
Forget Thighland, wait until Trump tries to pronounce the country of Niger when it pops up on a teleprompter.
I don’t believe in god, and I hate Trump.
There is no comparison between the decency of Joe Biden and grotesqueness of Donald Trump. Biden’s life has been marked by overcoming personal adversity in service to others while Trump is devoid of empathy and all he has done has been in service to self.
who else thinks trump is acting unreasonable no  just me  ok then

Biden essentially said "all blacks are the same." Yet you will stand up for that?  Ill call Trump an idiot when he says something dumb. No problem.   Biden is somewhere on the scale between problematic and racist but liberals will never admit it.
My 19 year old just said Trump needs to be issuing an executive order to give her a stimulus check😂😂😂
It is absolutely imperative that we investigate the Trump family and business and if they did what we believe they did, then prosecute, convict, and imprison. No president of the US should ever have the power accorded Trump wher the congress failed to check his abuses of power.
Wait Trump banned Fortnite? Lmaoooooo
I am not a political strategist but I will tell you that if you want to win...stay in your basement and let trump lose.
I want to see Joe Biden debate Trump and I want to see him and angry but calm. Drag him with squinted eyes and disgust
America doesn’t need Trump to explain anything. America needs to use their right to vote to put their proverbial knee on his neck while he claims there are fine people on both sides.

Donald Trump banning tiktok unless they sell is the most blatant form of corruption between big tech and government i’ve ever seen. Clearly big tech had a hand in this.
It's not the President's fault. You definitely need to vote for #Trump if you want the Durham investigation to continue if you want to see indictments. If Biden is elected all of this will be swept under the rug! There's many other reasons as to why Biden shouldn't be President!
Trump's tax cuts overwhelmingly helped the richest people in America.

The coronavirus is killing Americans. The Trump virus is killing America.
No apple pie without ice cream and motherhood is only for mothers!  Trump is so rattled by his failures, even if he doesn’t recognize them, when he speaks nothing but Babel falls out.  So sad for us &amp; the World he represents the USA who was the forefront in democracy!  Vote Blue!
If Cyrus Vance indicts Trump before the GOP nomination convention, do you think he will be the GOP nominee?
One of many Bible verses Trump should read -- if only he could read.  Micah 2:1 ESV "Woe to those who devise wickedness and work evil on their beds! When the morning dawns, they perform it, because it is in the power of their hand."
But it should.   You all have enabled this. Especially your husband's "newspaper" trash rag the federalist.   Y'all never checked his worst impulses.   In fact GOP helped spread misinformation that have made the pandemic worse.   Let the GOP party die with Trump. Its well earned.
Yes and many other black people would also justify a democratic vote with the fact that trump is racist. You don’t think being racist is disqualifying?
Um at the point that trump believes I. Drugs that don’t work and flouts conspiracy theories and pushes reopenings too early. Oh and turning the us school system into coronavirus incubators for all the students and staff.

We know where trump is moving too
Wtf does that matter? Are you actually arguing Trump has a Christian prerogative that warrants voters support?
At the very least, Dems should be able to acknowledge Religions that say "Hey, that's killing a baby, that's wrong" is a legitimate position. Until they can do that, there's no where else for Religious people (for lack of a better term) to go other than Trump.

Proving, once again, Trump knows nothing. This is about illegal corruption and top executives using funds as their personal piggy bank. Not the 2nd amendment or guns.
Not going to push for Biden in any significant way and I'm not sure if voting for him will matter in Indy but cannot fathom a 2nd term of Trump doesn't do more harm than 1 term of Biden. I cannot imagine a president who's black bagging protestors won't do worse in the future.

I know a lot of people intimidated by intelligence. It's especially difficult for weak, insecure men. They have to demean someone else to, um, feel better? They certainly don't look better. Trump is small.  What a bad, weak, little boy we have running our country into the ground.
Agree with all  said. Trump has managed to make our nation more dangerous than ever and that he doesn't possess any form of compassion or humanity. Other countries are feeling sorry for us. If I wanted to migrate to the U.S. I'd stay put. Might be safer.
Trump need to slide me my stimulus before the plug slides me into a lake. 😬
Remember, Trump thinks HE’S God. So many of his demented followers tell him that. I say, Go Biden.
No, but I do vet. I started my account years ago, but never even tried to use it until trump was elected.

Trump cannot temper his rantings or behaviors for the place or time.  He's just one hot mess of spontaneous blubbering.
I dare you to do a 2008 to 2020 video comparison of Trump.
Won’t matter.  He will still beat Trump.  It’s unreal
Evangelicals love authoritarianism. Its why they force their beliefs on others and expect everyone to accept their moral superiority. Just look at purity culture for example.   So ya...of course they'll vote for Trump.

Mr Trump is Dr Feelgood. He will tell you anything to try to make his base feelgood !
Yep, and Trump has no contact with any religion. Except he “eats his little cracker, and drinks his little wine” and damn sure ought to know about the 2 Corinthians who walk into a bar, right?
We got Trump. The rest are career politicians and scared to lose and fight for the people of this country.
I love the spirit of that tweet, but I must disagree. Here’s why: Twitter is almost like an ankle bracelet on Trump’s ankle. It tells us where he is and what he is up to. For those, like me, that believe he is a full time criminal, knowing what he is up to is very important.

We need your support since we can get the word out. They can't stop all of us . Stay and keep helping Trump. After the election we all can leave.

That all said, Trump is the worst in any religion or non-religion.
Yea....let’s nit pick the semantics. You all don’t seem to remember that Obama was the most rogue and lawless President in history. Trump doesn’t even begin to sniff Obama’s level of corruption. And don’t get me started on the Clinton’s....
Before the “pandemic”, things were the best they’ve been in years!! This build back better slogan is so juvenile and pathetic. But the irony is, that “Joe’s plan” is to do what Trump was/is already doing, and try to spin it as his idea...
You know...dear leader said some bs about kids not getting the virus.  But, we know the truth and Trump lies like a.....
We will see. Personally I believe he is to Trump what Wm Barr is to Trump.
2/2 I do not excuse dizzy dean frivolity. The Trump Years have been harmful, bitter pills and that's NOT alright.
1/2 Voting not like being old enough to buy a drink. It is a responsibility for the welfare of our nation. Personally believe we witnessed how rights can be wrongs and had to accept that when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost to Trump.
Trump is banning gaming and tik tok 😳
Yes ! 🇺🇸 Trump/Pence 2020 🇺🇸
And you can’t help but think “what do Trump’s books look like?” as you do.
Ok, now say it loudly: trump is a COSMOPOLITAN GLOBALIST. I would like to see the WH reaction and all those rednecks who keep calling him and themselves patriots. Trump will revoke your pardon after that.

Are u talking about the Trump virus ya mean?
Trump has never thought anything through!:-)
He called the criminals but he was more concerned about Trump using video than the acts of violence.
You’ve openly admitted that you will raise taxes on the middle class. And furthermore, Trump has brought many manufacturing jobs back the the US that Obama (and u) drove off to foreign countries.  You are not the path forward. #Trump2020
Bro fuck trump. Can we all at least agree on that 🤪
Also, they're coming via USPS, so I blame Trump and his damn lackeys for this delay.
Roberts must go on w/or w/o GOP.  Problem: GOP wants all to forget Roberts' hands tied during a moment of truth: Trump facing impeachment for foreign collusion to dismantle opposition candidate's son. He sat over a mockery of justice even though nature of charges very serious.
Donnelly lost because he supported the wall and other Trump things which lost him D votes and did not bring in a single R vote.
Cool he agrees with Trump
Trump issues orders banning TikTok and WeChat from operating in 45 days if they are not sold by Chinese parent companies
Not over 160,000 and counting, because she wouldn’t have disbanded the pandemic response office like Trump did!
Trump doesn't need to win the black vote. He needs to depress turnout.
I 100% agree. But I don’t think Donald Trump would do any better.
Hint: when you see accounts with names like "Truth14," “Honest Paper,” and “Pure Honest Journalism” they are probably #disinformation #fakenews   via
Why does everyone act so surprised when Trump speaks nonsense? He is given way too much credit, as if there is some other expectation. Look: Everything he says is nonsense. If he ever speaks with reason, THAT is when I’ll be shocked.
Oh, so now I can teach my students how horrible trump is .,.good. Until now I was required not to demonstrate my political preferences and not to impose my opinion on students. Thank you Sen Cotton. What a relief.
Am I the only one to suspect the Gov was not very happy to greet trump ... hmmm ...very creative!
The Venn diagram between Donald Trump and the Republican Party is a perfect circle.
Open any book on phonetics or linguistics and read the difference between variants and ...inability to read correctly. Nobody would probably notice trump’s mistakes (happens) if he or his lackeys didn’t point to the errors of others.

Sometimes I think Trump really wants to be a stand-up comedian. Other times I think he really wants to be trade show model.
Red-lining, decimating voter rights. Trump demonizing BLM protests &amp; kneeling during the national anthem, calling white supremacists good people, giving cabinet positions to known racists. His constant dog whistles, his past of refusing to rent to POC. Calling Hispanics rapists..
If Trump continues to be president the pandemic will never end, maybe vote based on that
The Patriot Act had/has massive bi partisan support. Freedom of press is another. Assange? Journalists being arrested, tear gassed. Yes, Democrats caged children too. Trump is separating them from their families &amp; sending parents home. That’s evil.  The drug war, private prisons,
He blackmails us w/a govt shutdown over $$$ for a wall, now, take it or leave it as to GOP stimulus bill or he'll end Soc Sec making it look like Dems' fault. Clear Trump wants to hurt the nation he blows hot air abt 'making great again'. If not clinical, he's guilty of tyranny.
it should. not much difference between Trump and Republican right now
First off, establishment dems are not “the left”.  They are much closer to aligning with Trump than progressives. Their policies pretty much match Reagan’s. On the political scale they are center right.  Patriot Act?? You need examples of War for profit? Caged children? Racism?
Dark indeed. Also, consider these numbers:   Hiroshima and Nagasaki death toll: between 129,000 and 226,000.  Death toll in Trump administration’s handling of COVID-19: over 150,000 and counting...
We are either hated by our allies for trump’s betrayal or ridiculed by enemies for his stupidity. Please explain it to him.
Trump has been on a search and destroy mission inside our govt beginning with the slaughter of many of Pres Obama's Executive Orders. That's no way to 'make America great again'! Some semblance of unity between the parties is a must.
I would hope that after four years of Trump you would realize how important rhetoric really is in a position of power. Implying that Black Americans lack diversity is asinine regardless of any point he was trying to make.
Someone told Trump these OH -MI- PA supporters only care about God, guns and gays....and that's what he's verbalizing.

I understand some people still support Trump because they think he has good policies for business and the economy and etc. but put that man on a committee or something, not the president of the United States 🤦🏾‍♂️  Your first government job should not be being president.
Joe Biden just sitting back and letting Trump ruin himself all alone. Literally the country is burning, Biden has done nothing, bc well why should you when its all happening anyway.  Side Note. Both candidates are like the bottom tier presidential candidates. Ever.
We have Trump because HILLARY choose to implement her Pied Piper Plan to ensure he would rise to the top of the GOP, but you know this. She knew exactly what he was (daughters BFFs, Bill golfing, whoring), but risked him anyway because she thought he’d be easier to beat than Bush
Bill Clinton is a Pedophile too so I wouldn't necessarily say Trump is worse. Both are bad. Clinton showed up on Epstein's Island with two 16 year old girls. Just saying.....
Trump-Biden moment.   Used to call them blonde moments.
How is this liberal think tank if these guys have trump tattoos ...look closer. Hehe.
The terrible leaders he HAS to be talking about, are the Dems that disregarded the urgency of the China virus. As we all know, Trump shut down travel from China early, and was chastised by the entire Dem/Leftist/MSM. Trump also listened to the experts, who weren’t always right...

Sorry, was away from phone. Obama destroyed US? And trump put it together??? Sorry, Daniela, what a cooked up world are you living in? Please, don’t take it personally, I don’t mean to offend, just cannot imagine even comparing these 2 personalities.
You’re right....China was wrong to inflict this on the world. Cuomo was wrong to send Covid patients into nursing homes. MSM/Dems were wrong to politicize a global pandemic. Experts were wrong in telling Trump that 2M+ would die, but he acted quickly to mitigate. Etc..Etc..
I'm sure the GOP is wondering why they supported Trump? They could have ended this at 1st yr and saved their seats had voted to impeach him! Maybe not all of them .The GOP base would have moved on to Pence or whatever other bozo they wanted in and may have won back the WH?
Think both Trump and Biden should address the nation instead with their Top 10 Presidential Priorities and a narrative on each.
Hope not Vatican City. Who lives in that locale other than the Pope? Separation of church and state still exists. (Think Trump sometimes is being facetious but no one picks up on it.)
In other words - I am not VERY enthusiastic to vote for Biden (belonging to 40%) but VERY enthusiastic to vote AGAINST trump (65%). Sometimes hatered is stronger than love :(
I believe the Covid-19 19 is real.  I also believe Covid-19 is being politicized to inhibit Trump’s re-election.
Only in Trump’s America would an “Anti-Fascist” group be labeled as terrorists.
Hmmm ...that’s an interesting idea. We always assume that candidates have good professional designers ...but McCain’s screen malfunction in 2008 and trump’s “ascending from hell’ in 2016 were really disastrous

Sorry Joe, I don't think you could have done any better, at least Trump will remember it.

How is your hearing? It’s not Durham but Vance and not Obama but trump ...
Of course there is a curiosity about who Trump knows w/this knowledge. What else does that person know... about COVID-19? Trump keeps saying 'it is going to get better'. How does he know that? (A thought: none of the other pandemics has been as complicated.)
For what? Because you want it? Have you heard trump is under investigation by Manhattan DA? It’s not made up investigation in Ukrain, it’s real.
Then you should be sure to remove me from the victims who are being used for human trafficking.  My life has been a commodity for the people like you Ivanka Trump to make money off of.

The Trump campaign really can't use the "What about Biden's mental state?" nonsense. Case in point ⤵️
Thank you, Manuel. I appreciate ur tweet. I should admit, I strongly oppose trump and his policies. I believe he and Pompeo approached Venezuelan situation very unprofessionally, as most everything trump does. I also believe Putin played a role in this.
If that’s not Trump’s platform, I don’t know what is.
Thats how I look every time I hear Mr. Trump.
If only Lewis had regretted being blackballed for not showing up at Trump's inauguration! Hmmm. If only Trump could go back...way back, and out of curiosity slip into Lewis's shoes, even he would give Lewis his props! Those black jacks, rocks, brogans, night sticks, 2 x 4's hurt.
So, Bush is now left bcz he started war in Iraq? And how good is trump as negotiator - completely betrayed and abandoned our allies (Kurds)? Who will now trust our military? Russian flags on our bases? Very patriotic!

His facial expressions perfectly reflect mine the day after Trump won the election in 2016. “Really?”  🤔
Where did you get this rhetoric? Leftist? Trump was registered Dem by 2012. What does ideology (right/left) have to do with Foreign power interference in US election?
Unfortunately, it’s Putin’s and trump’s fault. I am originally from Russia and I know Putin’s gov-t was involved in disrupting our election. By not punishing Russians and always agreeing with Putin, trump makes the situation even worse.
Okay, well you obviously know that most counties that vote for Trump have very few people in them. If you want to talk in terms of people...just do it. Look at the popular vote total.
All you# Indycar fans! Think in November. If Covid19 had been handled differently, we might possibly be in our seat May 23. Dump tRump!
I had to watch this multiple times and still don't really understand what Trump is trying to say
I love this version where Trump/Kemp has that dead stare back even better
Notice, I never said our system is democratic - the phenomenon of trump is the best proof of it.
Ok, Jeff, spend a year or two in Russia, Belarus, Venezuela, or Cuba and then talk about fair election and overwhelming support (I lived long enough in the Sov Union and Russia and have some experience). Trump lost an absolutely winnable (for Venezuelans and democracy) game.
Maybe all those Indycar tRump loving people should reconsider their vote come November. If this had only been handled better in the beginning. Sad.

For a second round of #COVID19  relief. Would you rather.   #stimulus #tax #Poll #Trump #Senate #Congress   Please share this.
I want everyone to at minimum to look at this part of the interview and Trump pushing out this abstract four bar graph the size of the whole page
Trump: "...(my speech in Tulsa) was the highest rated speech in the history of Fox Television on a saturday night, and no one is talking about that."  Swan: "With all due respect, I'm asking you about the public health crisis and the 6,000 dead Americans a day."
What country are u talking about? Yes, those who don’t go out are safer... but it was trump and Rep governors who said - open up, open up. Now - go to school! What second wave? We are still in the first one. Check the summer death rate!
They're not inaccurate either, as much as you'd love to believe that. If they told you your preferred candidate was winning, you'd be telling me how great polls are. I mean, look at Trump, spewing about the Rasmussen poll every time it gets near 50%.
Good luck with all of this. You know good and well Trump is going to lose.
Remember when the biggest issue in America was this tan suit? Well for the Trump complicit #GOP Anyways!  Happy Birthday Mr. President
What an insane idiot (Trump). This would be hilarious if not for the fact that, as the interviewer noted, 1000 people are dying per day.
There aren’t any undecided anymore.  There’s members of the Trump cult, and the rest of us.
For two months after Trump initial travel ban, Biden said the action was xenophobic.... then he conceded as Trump action saved thousands of lives.

The fact that that clip came out in October and Trumo still won shows how shitty of a candidate Hillary was. The same thing is happening in 2020. Joe Biden is barely cognizant. The Dems have thrown everything at Trump and his numbers are still about the same.

So the final walk off from  would be the GOP to pass a relief bill that supersedes what Trump wants and bolster the Postal system so that GOP chances to maintain seats with mail ins. Trump against mail ins will cause the GOP to lose and they know it! Which is ok!
Black Joe Biden forgot his meds again. He still needs time to process Trump is gonna win in November and his so called purge movement is losing.
Microsoft says it will pursue talks to buy TikTok in the US after consulting President Trump
I hope they cancel each other out, if that is possible. When Trump loses, they'll become irrelevant regardless. Blue Wave going to wash them out!
A perfect way to end 2020 would be an electoral college tie between Trump and Biden.
Why endanger your child's future, maybe, with Biden when you can endanger him right now for Trump?
TikTok could be banned in the U.S.
So why do all these Trumpers have to voice their "opinions" while sitting in their cars? It's odd behavior, but supporting Trump is odd in itself!
#kanyedelusiondisease still getting to ya. Poor thing obsessing over Trump like a dog in heat. Follow Biden's example, set an alarm and take your meds before dementia sets in.
Why is there pics of u daddy and Epstein!? 😂 Trump must go!
Trump has got to go! He wants us all dead! The trump virus kills!
I’m beginning to think the only reason the Democrats wanted to have this hearing with Barr, was to simply abuse him. They have a burning hatred for Trump, and that hatred stems from a desire for power.
You’re wrong. The Dems are the cheaters. Trump is cleaning it up. Wake up......

How Trump Politicized Schools Reopening, Regardless of Safety | by Diane Ravitch | The New York Review of Books
Get a life
Hindsight is 20/20; trump could have done some things better, no doubt. But to say he didn’t do anything or he didn’t save lives is factually inaccurate.
Most prominently travel bans which saved thousands of lives. Then ventilator production, we went from too few to sending them all over the world. Furthermore, Trump coordinated with state governors to preserve the balance of states rights.
Yes federalism. Ergo, the governors are to blame for their own COVID responses, not the trump administration. The federal government is responsible for the international issues, such as closing down travel to China and Europe (which Trump did). We never ran out of ICUs. We ...
Evidently you don’t understand how Federalism works.  You should Google it. What could of been differently?  Nobody ran out of ventilators. Trump sent a Hospital Ship to NY area for NON covid and within 24 hrs they screwed it up. What would you have done Einstein?  Tell us all!
They had good emotional ones before, but these are just a visual representation of the replies to Trump's tweets
So in other words he’s probably going to try and avoid any debates with Trump
November 3, 2020 is the most important election in history.       🇺🇸🇺🇸Trump Pence 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸
Dems ended unemployment benefit negotiations. The USA has surpassed 50 million tests.  Trump has replenished the medical stockpile.  Clearly, you don’t understand the current situation.
Of course it bothers me! Pelosi and others called Trump racist/alarmist for his Covid response. In January.   Your tweet is so typical. Dems are the party of love for all unless you are a conservative. God forbid you be a Black conservative! Standing Proud Sir...
Donald Duck is more conservative than Donald Trump! Open your minds sheeple
Wanna know what Trump DID ban before Tik Tok?  Transgender people from the military, people from predominantly Muslim countries from coming to America... ya freedom right guys?
Trump banned Tik Tok before passing any sort of gun law reforms
Trump banned Tik Tok before he passed a federal mask mandate
Trump banned Tik Tok before he had Breonna Taylor’s murderers arrested.
RIght. Noonan has been awful for longer than Trump has been in public life. Just because she doesn't like him, she's not on the right side of history.
He’s a trump voter it doesn’t matter. He just had to come back up for air after gargling Trump’s nuts.
You can’t argue with a trump supporter. They are too fucking dumb to debate.
Fake news is anything that doesn’t come out of trumps mouth to you. I don’t give a damn what you think is stupid, it’s all invalidated when I know you deepthroat Trump 24/7. Get out my mentions, smoothbrain.
If there was even a small tiny whiff of Donald Trump’s name in this, the fake news would go into a feeding frenzy.
If you’re gay and support trump can you educate me on why? I’m genuinely trying to understand
One of the important things that has differentiated the USA from China is that the USA doesn’t ban media like China does (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc). If Trump gets re-elected, you can kiss the liberal international order as we know it goodbye.
This is happening bc Trump won and all the other ways of trying to get him out of office failed (Russia Russia Russia, billy bush, sleaze balls schiff/nadler). This is the last hope of the left to make trump look bad.
Loooonely....Trump is so looooonely...
Why are you so confident Trump is guilty? If there was anything- it would have come out before he was elected in 2016... there’s nothing
People are dying and Trump is worried about  He really has to go. #Biden2020
Pretty sure Trump needs to worry about things more important than banning TikTok which doesn't store US users data in China.... it's stored here! Let's worry about Covid and the economy and racial division, how about that?!
Regardless of the point he was making about this particular case, my point is that he always chooses to criticize the Left, but never criticizes the Right for anything, which is especially glaring amid the Trump era.
Everyone (liberals) are condemning Trump for being at Epstein's parties. How about exposing Obama for flying on the Lolita Express to Orgy Island. The flight manifests don't lie.
If Cold War is over and we (or OUR, definite not trump’s, allies) don’t need our troops in Europe, why wouldn’t you loudly demand that our military budget be cut or why don’t I hear your sarcasm about sneaking several billions for Pentagon into the rescue package stalled in Senat
Look at whose there and what our country has become, and since Trump showed up, they reveal themselves as corrupt hustlers.  Schemes they had going (money flow) got disrupted. Pressure applied? One guesses...  Agencies really bother me too. Holdovers = shadow gvt of ex POTUS.
Trump should stop supporting and acknowledging  just because he obeys everything Trump commands. Honduras is sinking because of all the corruption from this government. They had to steal the elections to keep at power
Well unlike David, Trump *literally* did do that. He told Xi Jinping that they're doing "exactly the right thing" by putting those people in concentration camps.
I'm sure the sentiment is more that it's potentially spyware than anything else. Though I would agree that trump only disliked it because it was used as a means to discourage attendance to his last rallies

True, but it’s better than Trump
Me too! They are so silent on Trump that I was beginning to wonder if they even pay attention to the news. But they do...
No ass hole, it was you for waiting to long to address the pandemic until after it had flooded the nation. Its the Trump Virus now because of his inaction. And McConnell for not getting house relief bills such as the Heroes act &amp; other he just left on his desk &amp; refused to act on

Yet again you prove yourself a highly partisan churchman, only choosing to criticize the left, while always remaining silent for those on the right, especially Trump.
This also describes Trump.
What if Andy Serkis, Christopher Walken, Peter Cullen, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Donald Trump, and Sacha Baron Cohen all auditioned for Batman?  I have zero clue, but here's a video:Trump didn’t kill anyone from Covid. If anything he’s prevented deaths. Go blame your governors. It’s their fault.
The trump virus is spreading and the economy continues to tank. This is why you guys in Washington are discussing a SECOND relief package. I may have been born at night. But, not last night!

I love how Brett Farve is still trying to stay relevant. One minute he is in the news in opposition with trump then the next he is in agreement. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Trump has made us such a s***hole country that even his supporters don’t want to live but hope to take some of us out as well.
Is there a certain number of US Covid deaths trump must provide to keep Russia interfering on his behalf?
I live in Indiana where I guarantee Trump will win by 8-15 points.  I don't plan on voting Biden as of now, but if I lived in a different state I would have the same thoughts as you do.
Will Congress make a deal on supplemental unemployment benefits or will the White House take unilateral action on financial relief? Catch up on the latest with   tonight at 8p.m.  #WashWeekPBS
Just read the dumbest post ever...Trump is great because he is ushering in the “second coming of Christ”. That’s not how it works -if you believe in it that is...
tRump can hardly convince an intelligent person that he's a devout Christian. He lies, and has broken how many Commandments?
I wish reporters would stop saying trump says he asked Putin about Russian interference, Putin said he didn’t do it, and trump believes him.  Trump knows about it, helps Putin, and asks for more interference.
If Biden wins; China wins but if President Trump wins; Russia wins. I see nothing good from these two outcomes  Seeing Trump as ‘unpredictable,’ China would prefer he not win reelection, intelligence official says
If you don't want people to invalidate your very real and credible concerns about a Biden campaign then I sure as hell better not catch you invalidating someone else's very real and credible concerns about Trump being re-elected. Criticize Biden as the solution? Sure.
But then again I look at the awful shit going down in these protests and understand at least a little bit why they're so scared of trump's regime. Not quite enough to make me bite the bullet yet but I definitely understand
I don't blame them for being scared tbh. Historically presidents have usually treated their citizens (unfortunately) with a higher level of dignity than foreigners. Trump doesn't care. If you disagree with him, you're not a citizen. You're the enemy. That's unprecedented
I’ve been saying that the crazy vote will be split between trump and Kanye.
The GOP is using Kanye the same way Putin uses trump and the GOP.
Even trump supporters are depressed.  Their refusal to wear a mask is their way of saying I’m as good as dead under the trump administration anyway.
Still trying to understand why there are Mexicans out there who support Trump... #Puzzled 🤔
Donald Trump! I have thought this many times!
Is there anybody on Twitter that used to be a Trump supporter, but isn't anymore?
Trump vaguely and loosely somewhat-sort-of followed a very very small handful (because his hands are tiny) of the critical responses that medical professionals were screaming from the hilltop that we needed to take. This whole thing has been a cringey disaster.
But at only 6%, that means 94% are way smarter than the white fools who support trump.
Me too.  He picks anyone dumber than a bottle of Heinz 57 and I’m voting for Trump.
Trump is pissed at them TicTackers and K-Poppers 😂
Shame on all of you Trump enablers. You are equally responsible for tearing down our America!
Hahahahaha Never in my life have I ever seen thousands of protesters show up to protest a President arrival on their soil... like they have Trump, baby balloon and all! Officials laugh at him behind his back! They hate him! No one respects us!
Don't compare the two. Biden has dementia. Trump is at least capable of coherent thought
Lol. This takes some work to make it “OfFeNsIvE” but trump straight up tweets racist hateful shit.  I’m surprised liberals aren’t the only ones who want him to shut him damn month. Better a lot of republicans do this when they check the news every day:
I am honestly mesmerized after watching Jonathan Swan’s interview with trump. I’ve never seen someone filibuster a completely one on one interview for almost 40 minutes
But I’ll tell you what, I’m no fascist.  I will challenge any authoritarian state until my death. Trump’s regime seeks control, challenges all dissent, and is power hungry.  He is the fascist, not concerned citizens like myself.
You’re right, I don’t like him.  He is a direct arm of the trump campaign, spinning up scare-tactics that make conservatives view liberals as dangerous criminals. He’s literally fake news and is mimics Tucker Carlson exactly (I know R’s like Tuck, but he’s a partisan alarmist).
As a career prosecutor and criminal justice professor, I never thought I would be in a position to choose between the Republican Party and the FBI. Now I suppprt the Lincoln Project to defeat Trump
If Trump announced that fresh air and sunshine is good for you. Pelosi and DemonRats would mandate masks and staying within 6 feet of an running vehicle tailpipe.
And Trump is called racist. The world is upside down.
#TinaFey      can we pitch a grand lineup for #celebrityjeopardy  with a Politics edition? Palin vs Trump vs W. Bush or maybe Bill Clinton. Would be priceless. Baldwin v Fey v Carvey?
They certainly aren't honest and forthcoming about their money and taxes like Donald Trump is-
I've seen 1 in East Central Indiana.  But lots of Trump and Jesus Matters signs.
Fascist zealots? That’d be Charlie.  The man is defending the closest thing we’ve seen to a fascist (Trump) and these young university kids who, may still have a lot to learn, are chasing him off so he can’t clip together unapproved footage of them for his tacky YouTube show. 🤡
Neither Trump or Biden are looking to change that. That’s what I’m looking for as a voter.  Find me a candidate who wants real, fundamental change away from exploitation (b/c stock market growth is all that matters) to valuing ALL of the people who make it all happen
Funny. Trump says he has total responsibility. But, when asked about pressing issues c19), he says he doesn’t take responsibility at all. Weak man
We were on Mars way before Trump. People won’t be on mars for a very long time after trump is dead.
Since Trump’s been President!
It’s the internet tough guy syndrome, Trump’s basicalky the same
It’s so true!  - Nepotist? Trump kids in the White House.  - Rapist? 25+ accusers.  - pedophile? Epstein’s friend.  - Senile? Cofveve x1000
6. Do you support being ripped off by China ?   7. Do you support socialism ?   8. Do you support the federal reserve ?   9. Do you support total government control ? 10. Do you support a “ new world order” ? IF YOU ANSWERED “NO” to 3 or more you support Trump
I don’t think they will actually manufacture the hydroxy.  I think they will package it for sale using the millions of doses trump bought.  I think trump has a group who bought all those doses planning to make a bundle.  Doesn’t work, so Kodak can at least return their$.
I don’t think there is a number that’s too much for trump.  He acts like he’s trying to kill us all.  For red state governors, it depends on how much their voters push.
The main reason I’m somewhat against Trump has to do with the fact that he throws stuff against the wall to see if it will stick, instead of using a superior method that’d make him less of a punching bag on some things! I do like the fact that we are trying to stay out of wars...
Trump 2020! 🇺🇸
Lol it’s definitely funny, and Trump would be killed for it. This headline probably isn’t fair, but I laughed very hard at it. 😂
I mean, it's Pewdiepie, Trump, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos ... I'm seeing a pattern!
For years, I thought people typed Trump like "Tr*mp" or whatever because they couldn't stand typing his name, but it was because if they Tweeted negatively about him, they would receive death threats. 😌  Says a lot more about said person if their followers threaten to kill you.
Dems say “a vote for libertarian is a vote for trump” that’s like admitting defeat before the election even began! Are y’all so outnumbered you need these third party voters? I guess their votes do matter huh
And it will turn up voter enthusiasm for Biden.  Thank you, Mr. Trump.
decides this is no reason to panic after more than a dozen schools across Indiana had positive COVID issues within first week of reopening. Guess he like Trump is willing to sacrifice kids &amp; staff lives. #GovHolcomb it appears agrees with Trump “it is what it is.”
If he did take a test, he wouldn’t brag about how he “aced” it like trump did.   It’s quite literally a test to see if your brain can hold onto thoughts and complete simple tasks  There are no grades, no extra credit. Only proof that you are (or are not) very cognitively impaired
This, and his obsession over fair treatment is a symptom of narcissistic personality disorder.  Trump’s mental health is undoubtedly the bigger issue than Joe’s.
Dude “aced” that cognitive test designed to screen for the severely disabled. We aren’t we patting trump on the back more for not being as brain dead as he seems?
Frankly he doesn’t have to. Trump has made so much of an ass of himself Joe just has to show up on a ballot to win.
Proof that calling some trump supporters “deplorables “ was being way too kind.  Homicidal maniacs seems more fitting.
Since trump wants all schools to open, and his son’s private school will not open, is he going to go to public school like everybody else’s kids?
Doc on Trump’s decision to stop watching the NBA because of kneeling: “Well, we lost one guy.”
And this is all we could come up with in the Presidential election in the greatest country in the world? President Trump vs former VP Biden? 4 years ago was Trump vs Clinton
I think it will just split the insanity vote that normally goes to trump.
The  abandoned interest in governing in 2016.  In 3.5 years, the  passed one piece of key legislation (corporate tax cut), a version of which was supported by his predecessor. The legislative remnants of the Trump admin will be gone by spring.   Winning . . .
They’re the ones who think the virus doesn’t exist or is just the flu and the number of deaths is made up.  When you’re totally clueless, trump looks better.
My biggest prayer right now is that Trump wins 40 states and the popular vote and the Democrats reverse course and go back towards the center abandoning their SJW communist bs.   I know it's not realistic.  #Trump2020Landslide #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
Before you click, I’ll save you some time.  There was an explosion caused by the ignition of ammonium nitrate. Nobody knows what started the fire. Lebanon was already in the midst of upheaval. Trump thinks it was an attack.
'Breathtaking' — Trump Has 'Caught' Obama &amp; Biden Spying On Campaign, 'Now It's Up to' Barr
Trump campaign, RNC sue Nevada over expansion of mail-in voting
Did y’all know that Trump’s Tulsa rally was the highest rated Saturday night in Fox’s history?  Not enough people are talking about that.
Truth is:: Trump inherited a GREAt economy, fantastic unemployment numbers and a country that had been brought back from a recession by President Obama. Look at it now! Along with almost 160,000 Americans dead because if mishandling a pandemic! Truth
Why do you care where Hunter is?  Is he running for president? You should ask why Trump has committed such flagrant crimes while in and out if the White House! Focus, Blondie!
Ivanka Trump always sounds so stuupid, just like Daddy!
As much as I think many of the ideas presented are possibilities. What are the chances that Trump finally admits his health issues, goes into hiding, and allows Pence to be de facto POTUS w/o actually him officially being Pres?  Is it possible?
Breaking News! We have discovered Trump’s COVID-19 response plan...........finally! #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpHasNoPlan
If trump were making life for China as miserable as he claims they are, they wouldn’t be working surreptitiously to get him re-elected.
In the Jonathan Swan interview, trump mentioned “this plague we set up.”  I wonder if the failure to act was intentional because it looked like it was mainly hurting blue states.
That’s what the trump-loving part of the GOP wants.  I’m surprised he isn’t getting a lot more of the vote.
They can endorse who they want, it doesn’t change how their employees vote or the work they do  Unions endorse candidates who are good for their workers, trump (obviously) is not good for them. They can still vote for him, and they sure as hell cant affect votes. SO WHY IMPLY IT?
I do trust Trump and I did retweet!
You bet I am voting for Trump! If I have to craw to the polls I will vote for Trump!
I'm not a leftist, I vote for the candidate who I believe is best suited for the job. More often than not that person is a Democrat, but an occasional libertarian or Republican gets my vote. Am I qualified for the list? And by the way I detest President Trump
Trump seems to have flawed analytical skills if he’s saying that mail-in ballots are only “helpful” in Florida? Am I right about my word usage there?
I do feel like passing the Civil Rights Act was a momentous occasion! It was a landmark decision that changed the lives of every day Americans forever! I do feel like Trump’s work has been a step in the right direction! However, he hasn’t done enough to satisfy moderates like me!
Trump had done some for people who are still among the minority in the USA! But, he hasn’t done enough to end the problems there are in my opinion! There’s still a war to fight on multiple sides, in my humble opinion!
That’s a Southern Trump maple 🍁 tree 🌳
Why the fuck do I keep getting trump ads on YouTube.
Just another if the tens of thousands lies Trump has uttered
Well I guess that it is what it is and everything is under control lmao. Trump you are the worst President and person in our country.  Just step down and move to Russia.  Its terrible how many people that you have scared since you have been President.
Honestly respect to the reporter he was not taking any of Trumps shit &amp; trump kept getting pissed bc he was laughing at him hahaha
Show me which rulings he went pro LGBTQ. Gorsuch, trumps more moderate pick has ruled more liberal than Kav.  Besides trump doesn’t care about anti-LGBT, only Pence and some of his base do. My argument was Kavanaugh is pro-big business, that’s why he’s a trump stooge.
I think Trump should forfeit his salary since he just watches TV and plays golf
Why, Trump is doing us all a favor showing his incompetence by himself through these interviews. He doesn’t need anymore help in losing the election.
And let’s talk about kavanaugh, the man with an entirely corporate voting record PRIOR to the accusations  The guy who has proven himself to be a trump drone, which was the larger concern about him going in. Unlike postal workers, he wields a lot of power:
You suggest they’ll break the law to somehow remove ballots for trump—And how exactly?  Your mind is sick. The poor folks who run the mail in this country want order, they want their job—same as you! They have no ability to influence an election other than to endorse a candidate.
You’re doing exactly what Charlie is doing—you’re saying nothing, but implying everything  You’re equating information with speculation, then denying you own words.  Is this how Fox News has taught you to argue? Or is it learned from listening to trump babble?
I don't think they legit think Trump would crush him intelligently in a debate. I think they're probably banking more on Trump bullying the fuck out of him in a debate, and Biden won't be able to respond without looking like a chump because he is also not that intelligent
Trump just has to win November 3rd and we be in one.
This is all possible to me. Despite the Democrat fear mongering about Trump. I think it's more plausible Trump is winning but doesn't get to 270 and then the state delegations would vote for him to be president again and the Senate picks Pence to be VP
Your point? You're honestly going to sit here and say Trump is in a better mental state than Biden when we see him in real time misunderstand like 3 charts?
It’s trump’s fault.  He ignored the virus while golfing and trying to figure out how to use it for his political and/or financial gain.
I’ve heard that Trump was attempting to make the vaccines voluntary, and also use the military to test the vaccines as they went out. You are right though, he may be a false prophet too.
He won’t be friends with Putin and Un. Does that make Trump a communist?? He certainly doesn’t stand up to Russia or China Trump doesn’t care how many Americans are dying.. lock down works. It keeps the virus from spreading
Good for you!  I do not trust that trump and GOP governors have children’s best interests in mind.
But yet again you are saying Trump is the worst candidate to ever exist.  So you will vote for whoever the Democrat candidate is.  You don't bother to say why Biden is great, you just point out that Trump is bad.  Going back to how this whole thing started.
Donald Trump should pass an executive order that in so doing would stop mail in voting that doesn't follow normal absentee ballot rules, that includes Voter ID. They should cite the recent disasters and the safety of voting in person
You know the answer to your own question. Trump says or does something stupid almost every day. Biden is just letting Trump hang himself. No need to say a word.
Oh my god. It’s always “everyone is out to get trump” and never “hey maybe the people he’s trying to put out of business are trying to vote for someone else”
Lol. It’s because trump, and his donor he appointed to be in charge of them, have been actively taking the postal service apart for months.  Wouldn’t you endorse the other guy too?
what country is trump living in?😂😭
I had to switch to CNN ecause MSNBC thought I’d enjoy watching trump stumble through a laundry list of disinformation.
Does anyone actually believe a word this asshole says?somebody lock him up! Please! I never want to hear the  words great or wonderful again. This racist pig called Trump needs to stay inside!Lies! Lies! Lies! Loser
Trump’s campaign slogan:  I can win if nobody votes.
sorry if i’ve seen a little tense lately. my third finger in is sore from all the trump, blue lives matter, and confederate flags i passed on my way back to muncie.
Another Trump campaign
Trump effect.  Dr Fauci is actually 26 😉😂
The security that the Secret Service provides at Trump's resorts is worth many times more than what the president earns in a year. On top of that the federal government is paying Trump's company for services like hotel rooms and golf cart rental. He makes more than he donates
I know Biden is still gonna have problems, but I also want him to Trump to lose just to shove it to all the racists that support him.
Righttttt, thst &amp; when ppl are Trump supporters I’m like...you call me a sheep but you believe everything this guy says?? Alright 😂😂 they’ve all formed like a single cult of religious &amp; Trump supporters &amp; don’t think they are the ones being herded it’s deceived 🤷🏼‍♀️
CHIP IN to help us beat Congressman Greg Pence in the fall! His brother is VP Mike Pence and they are lock-step sycophants to Donald Trump. Let’s send them all packing Nov. 3! #DontPenceMeIn #LakeVsPence2020
White Lives Matter Trump gonna make White people Great again
NO- Trump is the enemy of the people!
You should go have your head checked yourself. I guarantee you are undiagnosed with something. Narcissism is big amongst Trump and his followers. I appreciate everything I have, but this world is burning, even here in the USA, and I will not turn a blind eye to PEOPLE.
11/11 So, as you think about times and places where competent leadership mattered and made a difference, think back to summer 1990 and compare it to 2020, and two GOP presidents. One competent, brave, morally courageous, thoughtful, caring, and patriotic. The other is Trump.
6/n I first heard about coronavirus more than 7 months ago, in the context of interrupted supply chains from Wuhan (that is what economists do on holidays, they worry about supply chains). The Trump administration has had more than seven months to respond to COVID-19.
They’re mainly letting out the wealthy and connected.  Public school children don’t have that advantage.  Barron Trump’s private school is opting for virtual classes.  Workers, their parents, grandparents, and children are human sacrifices.
It's not my fault if I don't vote and Trump wins, it will be Biden's fault for not earning my vote.  I realize you guys decided you will vote blue no matter who 30 years ago, but I'm out of the cult.  I will never ever ever vote GOP, but I won't blindly give to Dems anymore.
I have always been a conservative but I don't fall right in line just because someone is a Republican. I also don't understand the evengelic dooling over President Trump. But that is what makes America great! We can have different views &amp; still get along. America has lost that.
A load of crap. Trump screws over the middle class to give more money to his wealthy friends.
He has been silent for months (perhaps to allow President Trump to keep digging holes?) so not much to say. Voting for him is basically voting for his VP. They both are both out of touch. I like Pence though. But I am not a "lesser of two evils" kind of guy
Mail-in-voting is legal and control by States i believe it makes Trump look bad playing the victim on something that can't be change. Lot more oversight is the only answer and YaH.
Trump has killed so many people.  I don’t know how many lives would have been saved if he’d just acknowledged the virus was real.  Now the cult thinks the whole thing is a hoax, refuses to wear masks, and carries on as if it’s not happening.  It’s mass psychosis.
Tell her it will drive trump bonkers if she uses TikTok to start a movement to get all 18 year olds registered and inspired to vote blue in Nov.
How does this photo prove you aren't a Karen? 😂 My mom rides a motorcycle too. She abandoned us all when I was a kid and is a total Trump-supporting, fake Christian Karen now, too. So I guess if the shoe fits. 💁🏽‍♀️ (Also, I have a vagina, bitch.)
President Trump said several times during the last administration that President Obama should not be golfing during an American crisis...
I initially supported Pataki, then Rubio. By the time Indiana voted, it was just Cruz, Kasich, and Trump so I voted for Kasich
Indiana Judge I will most assuredly vote for Trump you can count on it!
I can’t tell a bot from a real trump supporter.  They both spread false information that’s sent to fox,other conservative outlets, and GOP congressmen.
I agree, and will vote for Biden like I did for Clinton.  Not a fan of either but both are clearly better than Trump even if it’s only because he sat the bar so low!  IF Trump wins the frustrating thing will be the DNC again blaming Bernie instead of looking in the mirror.
Trump has the thinnest skin....
Nah! We are ALL excited to be rid of Trump and Joe Biden will be a great replacement to return this country to its true greatness!
Is this all you do just post shit about trump?  🤡
Wow! Trump really is a pos. More testing = more cases? If we did not have more cases, more testing would not result in more cases. Bozo.
Catturd! Makes my day! Love trump girl also!
Do you remember Faucci and Birx literally telling Americans that the virus would kill 100-240k people with good social distancing? It was going to be closer to 100, but everyone started protesting, and somehow it's Trump's fault. Please.
I’m beginning to think Joe is going to be 47 because Pence will briefly be 46 after trump suffers a major stroke.
Trump is responsible.  Ducey is responsible.  Fox is responsible.  I live in a red state, &amp; whenever local news reports on Covid cases, propaganda-brain-washed trump supporters refute facts with fake facts from Fox.  They’re killing people.
We will come out of this pretty well once this is all over as long as Trump wins.
I didn't say it said anything about Trump supporters? Epstein abused between a few dozen to a hundred different underage girls and this report is an account by ONE girl. So for you to say Trump didn't abuse THIS particular girl, therefore he is completely innocent, is hilarious.
You guys are all nuts. You're fighting against a straw man that you've created in your minds. I understand that this is what you WANT to believe,  but as a famous Rockstar once said: you can't always get what you want. You'll all get what you need when Trump gets voted out tho.
Honestly who gives a damn if Trump doesn’t voluntarily leave office or attend the inauguration. The laws establishing the transfer of power from one administration to the next have been in place for over 200 years and they certainly won’t be changed on behalf of Trump
Vote by mail is here to stay makes Trump look weak playing the victim when it`s law. Close oversee is best that can be done.
Valerie Jarrett Gets Questioned Over Obama &amp;...
If crowd size=ratings, the trump show is gonna be cancelled.
Trump banning TikTok bc he’s mad we keep ruining his rallies
A note concerning qualifiers (and language by degrees): to call anything surrounding the Biden orbit the silliest goddamn thing you've seen in years belies the entire Trump Presidency*.
As much as trump is a danger to this country, his supporters are just as bad.  They don’t profit from his cruelty the way the wealthy do, but they’re the nastiest, most uncaring people too.  Go back to work and stop collecting free money is their cry.  No compassion.
Sounds like a lame excuse for her actions which seem premeditated to me! That’s not mental illness. That’s just Trump hate which Donald Trump promotes daily!
Barr Makes It Official—He’s Trump’s New “Fixer”
Trump wants to get rid of • The Post Office • Moms in Portland • Obama • Sarah Cooper • TikTok  Trump doesn't want to get rid of • The KKK • Ghislaine Maxwell (I wish her well) • Coronavirus  #SaturdayVibes #SaturdayThoughts
Trump is planning on banning Tik-Tok in the USA on Staurday.  Yes.  Fuck yes.  Absolutely, fuck yes. Tik-Tok is literally the worst social media platform out there rn.  Hate it.  It's so stupid tbh.
Trump focusing on banning TikTok over everything else in this country is very funny to me because - of course. Nothing new. Happy to be here in the U.S. where our president cares more about banning a social media app than stopping police brutality.   #RIPtiktok
trump really be like: tiktok bad very bad!! 😡😡😡 conoravirus good it’s all good 😀😀
Trump never beat Obama, he beat Clinton. In a head to head matchup Obama would landslide Trump. Trump just barely beat Hillary and Obama is quite a bit more popular than her
I’m a retired teacher, and I saw that for the most part, kids love diversity and equality.  They have ideals.  There is so much racism and cruelty in the trump administration that it makes sense to me that younger people won’t stand for it.
You have no idea what you're saying.  They don't "clear" him at all. There isn't anything at all in there that says "Trump did NOT engage in any shenanigans, don't worry Trump supporters". Lmfao, you guys claim to hate fake news but  sure love it when its about your orange daddy.
How in the world do you interpret them as clearing Donald Trump? They don't at all! Do you just say whatever you wish to be true so Trump supporters can see something they like and retweet it? THIS is how fake news gets spread.
where’s the plan?? Where the deal??  Just a phony lying piece of crap!  #TrumpOut202
Selling beans and advertising a pizza parlor, trump needs to start his ads with,”I’m not a real president, but I play one on tv.”
So basically, right now trump is campaigning for Pelosi for president.
If any of this were true—why doesn’t trump himself point it out? Or any of his conservative friends?  Why didn’t “good guy trump” come forward sooner?  How long could he be friends with them and not know they abuse people? Especially when he, himself, abuses women?  🤔
Even if your baseless claim were true—how do you guys reconcile the other 15 things trump has done illegally?
The science ain’t clear, and if it was, you fools wouldn’t believe it unless it came from trump’s mouth.
“QAnon isn’t a cult—it’s a lifestyle that teaches me to question everything (except trump) and especially whether or not every celebrity ever is a just liberal shill and a pedophile”
Good for LT Gov Mutz and LT Gov. Davis.    Still, this leads me to muse upon the internal polling of the Trump campaign in Indiana.
Sadly, I think Mr. Trump thinks lying is governing.
That's just not true lmao we have always had corrupt administrations. If you think that the ways Trump's administration has been able to openly exploit the system is new, you're sorely mistaken. Our government has been this corrupt for all of American history
And yes, there are many things that would help Trump. But it's not our fault for pointing out his flaws, it is his fault for having them in the first place. Blaming the people pointing out the bullshit is ludicrous
More than half of Americans aren’t trump supporters 😂😂😂
How? Money? A beautiful wife? The highest office in the world? Oh wait, Trump has all of that.
You might be a moron if you insist trump is not racist.
Feel free to ascribe insanity to liberals, that’s your issue. The reality is the NBA is a pretty diverse, culturally aware organization which I have no doubt is full of your “crazy liberals.”  The last person I can recall being anything th like trump was Don Sterling. Look him up
Now ban Trump!
Lol, closet Trump supporters in the NBA   Yeah, franchise owners maybe—Donald Sterling types. I imagine there are 1-2 left in the NBA and frankly they deserve to be ridiculed until they leave.
BREAKING: Evidence Shows FBI Tried to Tie Citizen Trump to Epstein CaseIt looks like former President Bill Clinton and Attorney Alan Dershowitz are implicated in the case by the victims, but not so with President Trump.   But with No Success
Is this like Hillary saying why isn't she 1000 points up on Trump in 2016
So Hong Kong is in on the hoax to exaggerate the impact of the coronavirus in order to hurt Trump in the election too?
the Trump Recession shows US economy is falling apart, but maybe not as much as Europe. Experts say the STIMULUS PACKAGE saved it from being worse. PUSH FOR A BIG STIMULUS ACT WITH PAYMENTS TO CONSUMERS NOW!! You could help the economy more the way!
I will vote Blue up and down because Democrats believe in police departments also and will bring this country back to the greatness we experienced before the total moron Trump arrived on the scene and destroyed so much.
Of course we will. We will be much safer with Biden than with the lying autocrats of Trump Pence! Losers
Should read:  Trump Virus Wipes Out Years of Economic Growth.  #TrumpVirus
You’ve lost your mind just like Biden. Trump is the only logical choice.
However there are many other ways that we, as a civilization and race, can protect our allies and uphold peace outside of military force. All of which Trump also fails to do. As I've said, the subject of how our military causes more harm than good requires far more context
The situation is far more nuanced, especially me being someone who is anti war, for me to say whether it is good or bad. I think that it definitely benefits Russia for us to do what Trump did, but I also think that the us focusing on the military aspect in the first place is bad
This^  Ryan is a fraud, like his cofounder
Not hard to better than that fool. He’s incompetent.  Democrats aren’t destructive or dangerous. Trump is
While I understand why Trump wants to delay the election this must not happen the Democrats will say Trump is only trying to rig the election Biden has already said Trump will try and steal the election a delay will make it seem he was right!
You know I love you Nate but you missed it on this one. You had a man who wanted to make a statement by attending Trump's rally &amp; not wearing a mask, and it backfired on him. He is literally now dead.
So let’s get this straight. Trump says is ok to reopen schools putting millions of children, teachers and staff at risk but now suddenly feels election should be put on hold until we can all go out safely to vote in person. #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpIsALaughingStock #Vote2020
And how many of those folks attended Trump's rally in Tulsa? How many of those folks bragged about being out not wearing masks because it's a hoax?  This is as simple as reporting facts and you are turning this around on other people attending rallies regarding social injustice?
Speaking of frauds, where is your cofounder, Ryan?
Obama didn’t give us Trump, Hillary did. Had Obama been eligible to run for reelection he would have trounced Trump as badly as he did McCain
Trump is responsible for 152,000 American death, including Cain’s.  His refusal to act until it was too late and his insistence on opening up too early combine with his failure to get testing supplies, which is no accident, as he said Slow the testing down please.
Trump is the human equivalent of a Feringi, he has no honorThis us such bullshit!  Trump's lawyers are in the Supreme Court trying to get rid of covering preexisting conditions.   Look it up. "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
People open your eyes.  Fight for fair elections and more polling places.   Make sure trump can't interfere with mail in ballots.   Secure drop boxes to drop the off.  You know Joe Biden.  He has been where you are.  #VoteJoeBidenToSaveAmerica  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
I see no masks. Let’s see who’s gonna die from another Trump rally.
Wow. Trump wants to be on Time cover but don’t thinks that the one. Cover depicts the way most of us feel- treading water and trying not to drown.
And Trump's incredibly poor performance as President has gotten us to a point where we have neither. Way. To. Go.
Trump wouldn’t let a little thing like a pandemic stop him from continuing on the planned path of destruction
Believe Bolton said trump was unable to discern where his personal interest left off.he just has a criminal mind &amp;a mob mentality. This country has nothing  to gain&amp; everything to lose if this mental defect remains in office. He has made a huge mess &amp; doesn’t have ability2 fix it
That’s what trump wants. Privatized for profit. Greed
Trump is morally and ethically bankrupt, dems are worse.
As if hurting the economy isn’t your his only bullet to get trump out.
Idc how you feel ab trump but dude is straight comedy lmaoo
Trump starts the weekend playing golf at his club in Bedminster
WHO offered trump the testS and he REFUSED!!!!
So democrats have negotiated and the republicans and Trump seem to not care about the people suffering and won’t negotiate back. Vote these people out in November!

why anyone would drink hand sanitizer. Not on trump cures list. Very sad. Information on tv is  hand sanitizer containing methanol isn’t even safe to use externally. Primarily those made in Mexico. Some containing ethanol contain methanol. Preferred contain 70% isopropylalcohol
The Republican "plan" is laughably insufficient. Just like Trump's response to the pandemic.

I love you Mr Trump.  Please do everything possible to get back in office.  Or we will turn into Russia or China.  I think China gave us more of the virus and we were the target.  He saw what you were doing for the economy &amp; wanted to stop you.  And he did.
Trump and his slimy pals are making money off the pandemic,  but this woman is facing prison for buying paint. Wtaf.
Can’t believe anyone would want to keep trump/pence regardless of who Biden picks
If Trump buys Greenland that would actually be fucking awesome imo

Trump... today is my birthday. If it’s not too much to ask can you publicly resign as a sweet sweet gift. I’ll ask every lawyer I know to help save you. Believe me. I know the best lawyers.  (I know, like, 4 lawyers...)

And yet when you confront trump with facts he calls them a hoax lol him being elected is a hoax I rather have Biden trump is a lying sack of shit and will get what's coming to him. Vote for trump and your not a real American .. I'm against trump because I'm a real American
No, not everyone. I identify Trump supporters as treasonous racist imbeciles because that’s what they are. It’s a description, not an insult. If they found it insulting, then they wouldn’t still be Trump supporters. Funny thing is, they only ever argue about the “racist” part.
But let's be honest, this is the solitary greatest moment of the Trump presidency, as history will show. Fittingly, Trump isn't actually involved in it.
Really, how much are you paid (as If that’s a sign of worth: Trump CLAIMS to be a billionaire and he’s still a scumbag)?  Is the re-election organization, “Illiterate Treasonous Racist Imbeciles for Trump” paying you by the grunt or the tweet?

Trump's so petty and vain.
Trump doesn’t know what it’s like to wake up everyday not knowing if you’ll be able to play your senior season sports
When you had a chance to be tough you sat around like a Big Sissy for 3yrs afraid to say anything about Trump's sympathy for Russia's Putin regime and now your PunkAss trying to stick you chest out and be tough with a woman...GTFOH with that BS #SpineLessWuss
I doubt it was the Illuminati. I think your inability to think is on you. But then, Trump supporters always need to blame somebody else for their being failures in life.
Dont tell Trump.

Trump is a future faker. It's another narcissist tactic.
So then there’s really nothing to worry about and you all will take care of trump at the polls.
In the Mob it’s very common to let the Don wet his beak, so I’m sure there’s Trump money in there, too...
But you didn’t and she still had more votes Trump just had better cheating.
Get him!
Clinton Balanced the Budget Bush took us into Iraq.   Obama took a 1.4 trillion dollar budget Deficit and reduced by a trillion.   Trump was running nearly Trillion deficits with 3.5 percent unemployment.
There's no reasonable upside in the election based upon that. All that would do is alienate the lower informed moderates to jump back into a conspiracy. Less conspiracy is going to be way better right now. I just heard a Trump guy go nuts that "The Rock" is caught by QAnon.
So Dems should start calling this Trump investigation the "August Surprise" to take the wind out their sails in October. It'll be an October dud. Womp womp
Speaking of birds:  Quack quack quack.

President Donald Trump is making big claims about cutting drug prices and about a COVID-19 treatment. Here's a look at that and more from the past week.
It’s true tho. They have been stacking the courts. If Trump doesn’t go then Mitch has got to. We have to take the senate back for sure. The political “game” they are playing here is ruthless and winner take all. So, I hope they don’t go Kamala as VP.
The fact that these trump supporters are using a song by TECH N9NE as their anthem should tell you all you need to know about the thought they put into literally anything they do. LOL.

It’s the fact that President Trump is disrespectful and crass in all his ways especially when he doesn’t like people. Lashing out outrageously; He doesn’t reserve the grace of the Office of The President, so he doesn’t get the same respect. Sorry not sorry. That’s his fault
OMG! That is shameful! Is this the United States Of America! We MUST Get Trump Out Of The White House!!!!!

No, there is nothing worse than a hypocrite who, when called on his libels, tries to change the subject.  YOU have your head in the sand. Trump is taking us into fascism, and that's just fine with you. Because Jesus (who you don't even understand). Pathetic sanctimony.

Pence IMHO is the poster boy for so called "Christians" who support Trump.  Hypocrites and thinly veiled white nationalists.
Your fake phony crap charts mean nothing. The economy was booming. The Democrats shut down everything and want to blame Trump. Its not gonna work. Joe cant answer simple questions. The poor guy has DEMENTIA.

Trump said “only I can steal your information!! Ban Tik Tok!”
When are you gonna look into our dead soldiers your buddy paid to have killed?  "President Trump says he plans to ban TikTok from the US"
The pathetic turn out for Trump’s address in Tampa tells you all to need to know about the death of racist politics in America.
With everything else going on in this country, this he expedites?  President Trump says he plans to ban TikTok from the US
do u believe that if Trump does ban tiktok that it will encourage/motivate more of the GenZ voters to go out and vote?
Just my opinion but do any of us believe that President Trump would of worked so hard on the child trafficking if he was as some put it "involved " because of pictures taken with them ? But then we all have seen pictures with people of color and they still want to call him racis

Dear President Trump, you have a calling from the One true God to serve our country in truth &amp; righteousness. But what I’m hearing frightens me.The republicans voice has become like the Democratics, mean &amp; hurtful. I agree we are in a battle for Justice, but not by hateful force.
Saying testing is the problem is akin to saying a thermometer causes fevers. Donald Trump needs to leave the veracity and necessity of COVID testing to his public health experts. The question is where is this Killer virus emerging,to answer that question to protect people we Test

I mean, Trump never actually does anything. He just tells people to. He doesn't have the official power to delay the election, but if he demands it be delayed, people will have to choose how to respond. I'm not saying it will happen, I'm mostly confident it won't.

Also what is your take on the video Trump posted of campaign since extending past the two year term limit. Do you see any problems with that?
Not terrorism either. The white supremacist and Trump supporters shooting up public places on the other hand? Those are terrorists
A presidents' approval rating being low is not the same as wishing for a puppet government of the United States or a military coup.  I hate Trump. I would still be horrified if he were assassinated by a foreign government and a leader were to be installed by that government.
Trump isn’t thinking about American people when he talks about using an executive order to pass a stimulus bill. He’s thinking about himself. He’s trying save his failing campaign because he knows he’s been caught red handed
Peter, Did he suspend student loan payments?  If so, that seems like a good thing.   And, if so, that doesn’t seem like a difficult concept.  I don’t support Trump. But with so much negativity right now, why bash a good thing over semantics?

E-Mac I think that it's sad what has become of Joe Biden. Someone should step in and end this and let him retire in peace. I'm a Trump supporter and think he will beat Biden but he should not be running.
Yes.  Trump has huge scandals and isn’t taking COVID seriously.  At least I’m certain Biden would do a better job at risk mitigation of COVID, with better national strategy.  COVID is my biggest issue now.

Btw I can see trump’s cult members doing the same thing if he told them to!

No one knows for sure how this is going to effect the voting.  Republicans think it will siphon minority and/or young votes from Biden.  There are just as likely discouraged R voters who don't like Trump, but won't vote for a Dem.

More uneducated women vote for Trump, than those women with college degrees. If you could read, you’d know that.
When you make a mistake, own it move on.  Conjuring up insane justifications is simply pathetic!!  If you truly believe what you are stating, then explain why Trump corrected himself seconds later.
Trump loves misprouncing words so people focus on him being extremely dumb and not a fucking awful human being

Check your facts. Under Trump AND the GOP House before 2019, the debt went up 3 Trillion. That’s under complete GOP control. 2019 and 2020 has increased because of COVID-19 primarily. We are leading the world in deaths, because Trump torched the Pandemic Team Obama had installed.
Where Do Republicans Go From Here?
So if he’s running for president AGAINST Trump, why would he be meeting with Trumps appointee?  He’s a joke. A farce. He makes himself look more ignorant with every word spoken. He couldn’t design a straw much less anything to do with education. He’s a Trump distraction

He’s a mental wreck and needs to have an intervention. Trump will spit him out when he’s done and they Kanye will see what he’s done to himself and that will lead to self harm.

I pray President Trump is re-elected! Trump/Pence are better equipped to lead our nation than Joe Biden and any of his potential VP picks.
American made is making a comeback but you’re not in office. Oh, right, President Trump is in office. Joe and I thank #45 for bringing American Made back.
He obviously didn't get the antidote to prevent covid19 that trump and other Republicans took!!
Watch her.  She's reading from a script.  She keeps looking down at it.  She must have a "Trump Binder" like KayLIE does.  They cant speak unless they have their binders telling them what to say. They are Trumps Stepford Wives. So sad they chose to let that happen to them.
I feel that way a lot as I can’t believe the shit tRump does ang gets away with. I have to step away at times for sanity. Oh. And  own a small biz. It’s SOOOO frustrating
Trump Campaign Wants Presidential Debate in Early September  #Newsmax via
Trump does not have a plan.   Trump is not a leader.   Trump is actively harming all Americans.
Twitter temporarily restricted Trump campaign's ability to tweet over false Covid-19 claims
will there be indictments of Obama crewmembers regarding spying on trump
Those same expressions are used in my house every time Trump is on. Especially #6.
Oh wow, WaPo had to issue a correction. It’s the Trump campaign, not  What an unfortunate error.
The only thing Trump is negotiating is what time to play golf this weekend.
Wait you must have read wrong . I’m voting for Biden not trump #pedophiletrump
You were gonna lose the ‘16 gubernatorial. Hoosiers we’re done with your bullshit before Trump bailed you out. You’re a failure on so many levels.
Giving Trump a platform I’m which to bloviate and spew lies is a waste. Don’t debate him at all!
Just another Wednesday for Trump and his zombie followers and blackmailed co-workers.
What many people who Trump keeps in line with threats of telling their secrets is - he is going to tell them anyway once he gets fired.  They are just delaying the inevitable.
I just tried to watch trump answer questions.. Can not do it. Please tell me how anyone could think he is capable of being president.#TrumpIsNotWell
Ever wonder why all the MAGAs first words are almost always name calling? They listen to their teachers well. Trump can hardly utter a sentence without calling someone something. Name calling and yelling are signs you've already lost rational thought.
Absolutely no debates before early voting. That will make Trump and the Goon Squad mad as hell.  Also cute how Trump thinks he gets to pick moderators like he handpicks his interviewers and questions. Although that Axios interview, well that didn't work out so well for him.
If he gets a "golfing trip" like Lindsay does, then this was his own doing. If not, and my bet is that it is not his own doing, then this was planted by Trump for some reason. Hard to believe Trump would say the words "Apologize to Obama" ever. We shall see.
Someone too progressive will turn voters and give them an excuse to vote for Trump just as Hillary did.
I hope so!  I need to think positively.  Biden is light years ahead of Trump in abilities!
If Kanye gets more than 10 votes (the number of his family members that can vote) then the election is truly rigged. He needs mental help badly. His latest comments were enough to enrage the entire BLM movement. Can you imagine him and Trump in a debate? "Yo, Yo, Yo Semites!"
I hear you, but there in lies the problem. "They're all bad... except for my guy."  Holcomb is the Indiana chair for Trump's re-election campaign.
And that's the real reason we ended up with Trump.
tRump is immune to the Hatch act, but would still break precedent.
Two decades of pandemic war games failed to account for Donald Trump
actually it’s been proven that facebook is an even larger nation security threat but Trump doesn’t care because we ruined his rallies🤷🏻‍♀️
So open the schools without many of the teachers?  BRILLIANT!!! This man is a dream to be running against for office. Just run all of his interviews back as attack ads. No one makes Donald Trump look and sound more ignorant and out of touch than Donald Trump does.
When Trump says there is no truth to something, you can take it to the bank its a fact.
Is he still talking? Isn't it time for his "trout fishing" trip?  Oh well as long as he and Trump and McConnell keep saying idiotic things daily, Biden never even has to hold a rally. They are winning for him.
They threw their full support behind Trump.  Tells you all you need to know.  Biden will have to rebuild them from the ground up.
"When asked about the death toll during a recent interview, President Trump replied, “It is what it is.” " How presidential of him-- has he expressed any sympathy for those who have died from the virus?? Nope unless he could make it about himself-no way #COVID19 #NotMyPresident
TRUMP could be impeached for 60 High Crimes and misdemeanors ??? You're delusional ! You Liberals are Idiots ! If congress could impeach Trump for drinking a Diet Coke they would ! F*ck off TROLL !

Neil Young Sues To Stop Trump Campaign From Using His Songs: The singer and songwriter has filed a copyright infringement complaint over the use of "Rockin' in the Free World" and "Devil's Sidewalk" at numerous rallies and campaign events.
Doesn’t he always talk nonsense? I wonder what Lebanese officials were thinking when Trump made those comments.
Most establishment media polls show President Trump trailing in a matchup with Joe Biden, but a closer look at the data shows that most of these polls may be built simply to discourage conservative voters from showing up.   History repeats itself.
Donald Trump did not hijack the Republican Party. He is the culmination of their vision from the last 50 years.   Out today is a new book from  one of the most successful Republican campaign strategists ever.
Let's go  Time for you to step up for all Hoosiers. tRump is going down so "what have YOU got to lose." All IN Voters want this right, do it!
Agree. Biden can misspeak and makes gaffes and the GOP will have a heyday with it.  Nothing to gain; he’s polling well.  Trump probably doesn’t want to debate but he’s a  bully and moderators don’t moderate properly.  They should mute for interrupting and going over time limit.
Another rule Trump violates on a regular basis.
$1M to create between 16 and 30 jobs???  Yup, sounds like trump math.  We’ll follow the $$ and see where it really goes.  You’ve never been altruistic in your life—I smell a rat.
We all need to challenge ourselves to find a way to vote for Trump at least 25 times and majority of those need to be in a swing state.
🤦🏻‍♀️Donald Trump Can't Pronounce Yosemite! Watch!  via
trump is the president!! If anyone provided him with any feedback that didn’t fit his gut reaction he is not feeling it! He relies on his rotten gut and so far that gut has been on a constant Alka-Seltzer drip!! Not worth a damn
Kayleigh’s right. No one could have handled the virus the way Trump has...That’s why Biden is going to win.
President Donald J. Trump. #Trump2020Landslide #Trump2020 #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #bidenisnotwell
Nice spin, but we both know Trump is not happy that his buddy Kobach lost.  Come on, now.
The El Paso shooter was radicalized by socialism based solely on white identity politics. He just used Trump’s wall stance as a means to achieve an alternative leftist agenda. And Trump denounced him, while the DNC corporate donors fund BLM and Antifa. Weak comparison.
I have the word Trump muted on Twitter and it's like a much needed trigger warning any time a tweet is muted.
maybe just maybe they lie about trump too . Hmmmm.  it sucks when the media turns on you doesn’t it?  Think about it …
How many dems switched? Two. Strom Thurmond and David Duke (who denounced Trump and supports Ilhan Omar). My point is there was no conspired agreement in the 60s to switch ideologies. Example: Dems today support affirmative action while Reps support merit.
I want to see Biden stand up to Trump in a way Hillary did not, as well as make it obvious just how stupid Trump really is.
Biden could go on vacation until 11/03 as long as DOnald Trump keeps talking. He is the "bigliest" support of Biden there is. Idiot Trump said today that he;s done more for Black People than anyone but Lincoln!!! Why would you ever debate a lunatic like that??
Should the GOP dump Trump/Pence and run Romney?  I bet the numbers would improve 🤷‍♀️ #nevertrump
We need more genuine America Loving Patriots with the courage to stand Up!  I have now finally bought a mask because my governor mandated it... but it says plainly on it... "Trump 2020".  I'm 68 and don't give a damn about the left... bring them on!
Way to judge everyone there Commander sinless!! God will love speaking with you about that. Look, I understand your love for Trump has made you intelligence blind, and thats ok.  You do you. But when you just want to name call, I've got 1 word for you - BLOCKED!! Buh-bye!
The writers of the best comedies ever, could note come up with something this funny, yet sad at the same time.  AXIOS on HBO: President Trump Exclusive Interview (Full Episode) | HBO  via
Trump supporters are a group of folks that have "Gumption" look it up sonny!  We can handle everything and anything to save our country. The left has created this crisis and chaos and we know it!  We will not go gently into the night. You drew first blood, we will draw the last!
If you actually think this is the wife of that loon then look again.. writing style is the same... the 3 second instant response time to anything trump tweets is exactly the same too.
38 minutes of your day to see how big of a 🤡 Trump is. Seriously, you'll think you're watching   Please vote.
Imagine if Trump weren’t President
"Stupid is as stupid does - and NOBODY does stupid like Donald Trump" - America
Sometimes I think you are both heads of the same snake. Zero faith in you. Follow Trump’s lead and help him please.
Maybe, just maybe, those people are afraid to come back to work for companies that aren’t fully safe in the middle of a pandemic.   And the GOP is fighting for COVID liability protection for those same companies in case their workers catch it there.   And Trump has no plan.
It gave me more insight into the inner workings of trump’s wasting-away brain. He chooses a particular thought or idea that he likes and wants to believe, and then he convinces himself it is correct beyond any reasoning and everything/everyone else is incorrect or fake.
This is the same look sane Americans have whenever Trump speaks, or KayLIE speaks, or Tucker speaks, or Lindsay speaks, or McConnell speaks, or Ivanka speaks, or Don Jr. speaks, or when Eric puts a full sentence together.
I love how every other sentence Trump says is "I will sue them." Have any of you ever heard of him actually suing anyone and winning anything? He's a bloated bag of narcissistic hot air.  Come on 11/03/2020.  You cannot get here soon enough.
Does that match you spending for the White House expansion (which Trump or you wont be around to enjoy anyway), and the extravagant military spending, as well as cutting the unemployment benefit. Either tell both sides or don't speak.
Did Trump find a surrogate to take his cognitive test? He does not seem well at all.
Watching Dave Portnoy sucking Trump’s dick is the height of “not being political”
In his recent interview with Jonathan Swan on  Trump claimed no one from BLM has reached out to talk with him. Is this so, and are there plans to have a conversation with the White House on how to move forward with police reform?
Just let tRump speak.
Brianna Keilar is currently annihilating Mercedes Schlapp (senior advisor to Trump) on CNN right now. Awe-inspiring interview.
In all fireworks explosions wouldn't there be several going off everywhere?? That's BS it was an intentional fucking explosion put in place by the same people responsible for Trump. The location was a message that it will be in a huge populated area next? Just my opinion?
Clay hasn’t gotten better everything right, but what he has done is stick to the data and provide common sense to this, which has been far more than most of the media who are more concerned with getting Trump out of the White House.  He’s been right far more than wrong.
Dude, she loudly and proudly spelled out her contempt for Trump and distrust of Hillary in 2016. She also stated she wrote in a candidate, but didn't vote for either. Reread my comment, S L O W L Y and comprehend a viewpoint other than your own.
Nice piece from  (not nice to tRump)
IF ONLY, panelists stopped Trump from talking when he isn’t answering the question.
If you’re a Trump supporter and you can watch this and actually defend this nonsense, then I’m not sure I can help you.  Good grief what an idiot #AmericasGreatestMistake
Keep in mind,  can be a Republican and not support Trump. And she can be unbiased when reporting the news. And give her feelings and opinions.   It's not like she's Megan McCain.
What does trump and turtle(Moscow Mitch) hope to accomplish by throwing the country into a deep depression filled with helplessness and poverty and starvation? WE WILL RETALIATE!

I wonder if the ratings for Trump’s trials will be off the charts? I know I’ll be watching every day.
I think Trump and DeathSantis are immune to Covid. Satan wants no part of them getting into Hell because it is clear that they will totally take over the place from him.
I will stick by my stance that Biden should not do debates. Trump is unstable, thats already been proven, so whats to gain? The media wants them to make both men look bad - thats their job. Trump makes himself look idiotic every day. Joe should sit them out. Just my opinion.
Just a reminder - The Police Union Head put the unions FULL BACKING behind Donald Trump.  This will be "just another day" for them going forward until Biden takes over.
Lindsay got that "Sunday Golf Outing" with Trump and after every golf trip he comes back and say the exact opposite of what he said the previous week. Man, whatever Trump has on Lindsay is really good stuff. Trump could tell him to dance naked and you can bet he will dance naked.
Amazing interview. trump made a fool of himself as usual.
I'm not sure that the effort to frame Trump as the 2020 candidate of mental acuity is going well.
I'm working on my front porch in Carmel right now and a guy walking his dog just passed by while holding up his phone and watching the  Trump interview.
Oh more of the public paid for NPR fake news to prop up a politically dead man come Nov. 3 2020 when American again call their bluff. You really want to paint Trump as the underdog again? Useful idiots!
To those who feel certain that Trump, Barr, and the rest of the GOP are going to play a “Shell Game” with polling places on Election Day to suppress the vote totals, vote early if you can. That way they can’t run the clock out on you.
The truth is we know how History will remember John Lewis. We also are well aware of how History will remember Donald J Trump. One was a “Hero”. The other is a “Zero”.
There is a lot of international huff &amp; puff over a fad app. #TikTok is big now, but it’ll be irrelevant in a few years like all apps of this nature.

I was thinking the same thing. Trump is running the country into the ground.
Wow that clip was hard to watch. The fact that Trump is president is pretty damn scary. He has no clue on what going on or having his staff BS for him.
#CuomoBusinessDestroyer has done a fine job, he is very good at whining and blaming the states problems on #OrangeManBad .    How does this help fix NYC crime problems.  Deblasio’s BLM mural in front of Trump Tower and taking $1bil from police budget didn’t do the trick!
We are still working for a revolution. Biden is no better than trump, not one of these 10 doesnt apply to both of them
Amen. Thank you for your reminder to those flipping out. Every minute Biden waits to announce is another minute Trump and the a Republicans cannot attack whomever he picks.
Really confused how this has anything to do with Trump.
Why are people wasting their time watching these Petri-Dish Campaign Rallies Trump has. Bottom line...if a doctor or scientist isn’t taking questions from the press, you may as well be listening to Kayleigh the Klown orchestrate the bullshit.
It's very simple, and I'm serious, put a bounty on Trump and his culprit's heads. We play by the rules(like we always do)and let trump do his evil shit, we get 4 more years of Republicans!!
I mean R naturally leans older so more of them have died since 2016. Very insignificant # of Clinton --&gt; Trump voters, and Hawkins + Jorgensen are much lower profile than Johnson + Stein  it'll be very interesting to see how ppl vote :)
This is a preview of what Trump will try in the General Election. If he gets away with changing the census he will feel empowered to do the same in November.  Where is Congress.

I totally get what you are saying, but this is not normal, we must not put down biden, we need to back him as our life depends on it. We will kick his ass out of office if he sucks. We can do that, but we can't do anything if Trump gets 4 more years. Please no repeat of 2016!!
I'm voting for biden even if he's not doing everything we want, we can't have trump, let's not turn people off from voting for Joe please. We will have democrats making the changes he will be just fine compared to doofus Donnie!
I absolutely do , to me if you need a mask to go to Walmart and you can go to Walmart , you can wear a mask to the polling stations on November 3 rd , why doesn’t President Trump say that during his briefings ???
Anyone who (incorrectly) believes social media platforms censor conservative voices should search “George Floyd” on this website right now and look at what comes up.   See also:
Trump had a ton of Hannity's books purchased and then given away as gifts to donors. That put Hannity's book above Mary Trumps book on the charts. Again, Trump spent a ton of money to get back at Mary Trump. Still think he's not a narcissistic little boy inside?
I feel trapped. I don’t care that my state will go for Trump (IN), I have to register my vote against him. I don’t want to vote in-person, but I also don’t want my vote to be “lost in the mail.” It’s criminal being forced to choose risking my families health and voting. I hate it
The Trump cohorts!
Ill vote. Neither biden nor trump is worth my vote though.
How about let’s scrap the election and leave Trump in charge. He’s running against Sleepy Joe who is not sure what zip code he lives in.
Persist...LOL, You're so 2017.  The next 4 years of Trump again are going to be tough for you. Hang in there.Actually very sad that all of you listen to the garbage that is fed to you. I want to know why Trump is so racist? Because he ran under the Republican ticket? Don't be fooled that if he ran Democrat those fools would idol him. It's only bc he exposes them that there's hate!
Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, was guided by his Christian faith in politics, business and his personal life, his pastor said at his funeral Friday.

But Putin loves Trump for:  Conceding Syria Ignoring Ukraine Crimea Destablizing America Increasing Deficit/Debt Attacking Allies/World Order Withdrawl from Nuclear Accords Ignoring Coronavirus Pandemic  All these things please Master Putin. Im sure he would love to see U.S. fall
The Trump administration disappears, everybody returns through the portal and gives the mad titan a standing ovation!
Using my simulation, which doesn't assume the poll results are the most likely vote result in states, but simply indicating a trend, my most likely result shows to be  Biden 320 Trump 218
No. There is absolutely NOTHING Rock&amp; Roll about Trump.
Seems like Trump doesn't care about us or if we die.  #TrumpKillsSeniors
Her own damn fault. The data was there from the beginning. Even at the local level, it’s all sucking up to Trump.
He needs more than his MAGA cult to win an election. A lot of independent voters don't think he can do the job. There are also Republicans who don't like him. #GOP will implode on itself when Trump loses. Hopefully they can recover because I liked being a Republican.
I'd be a little more worked up about the lack of a Trump/Biden debate if the presidential "debates" didn't consist entirely of shit any fool could Google during a commercial break.
If Biden or his son committed crimes they should be charged.  If Trump or his family committed crimes they should be charged too.  We need new leadership. PERIOD. I think they're all corrupt and self-dealing. Why are all politicans rich? Think about it...
Question... How has Trump given us our Country back? Or how will he?  It has been 4 years and not much has changed. He gave the rich (himself &amp; family) a huge tax cut. He gave rich companies (including his own) a huge tax cut too. What did we get?
Even for a president known for his blunt criticism, Trump's remarks stood out and they signaled how contentious the campaign may get over the coming months.
Maybe this is crazy thinking but President Trump has taken us back to a constitutional republic. Under the constitution of the United States no president can serve more than 2 terms. His first term was under the United States, Inc....two different entities.
Because trump said today he has a lot of enemies so we may not see him for a while
President Trump at the podium: On my map, and you know there is no one who has a better map than me. It shows me that Bangcock is the capital of Thighland. This was on the cognitive test I passed, very easy test. Joe Biden couldn't pass it. Me: I bet he can pronounce Thailand!
This is just a stunt for his friend, Trump, and should be treated as such.
Or just call it a day in the world of Trump
Trump should be replaced by Cardi cause she’s the best and she’s the most amazing woman. Trump really did nothing good for America. He forces governors to do everything and so we just don’t like it. Cardi for president!!! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I really think Cardi should take Trump’s place and become president. What do you guys think? 😉🤔
Sean you are crybaby #2, Trump's #1! You have a problem with everybody in the world but your lover Trump. You just nick pick everything  Democrats do! You're trying everything in your power (which ain't much) to get Trump re-elected. You know your ass in trouble when he loses.
How do we tell Donald Trump he is #NotGod?
Nope! That was Trump! Epstein and a certain madam who is now in Jail! Conspiracy vs Fact: conspiracy is in your head! Fact is in Jail!
Nope! That would be the Trump Epstein Foundation!
"You ain't black." "Are you a junkie?" Black Americans have no diversity of thought.  All Joe Biden statements in past 3 months that would have been labeled horrendously racist if Trump said them.
Because it's his army of bots and trolls that are doing it. If it was his own family I bet he would send the entire military after the people.  This reminds me of stuff that happens in places like Russia. Its almost like they coached Trump...
OMG. Trump's lost it.
The Commission on Presidential Debates said Thursday it sees no need to alter the schedule of this year’s debates after President Donald Trump’s campaign called for a debate to be held in early September.
Not Trump's thunder thighs, sure as Hell.
I was raised in a VERY Republican household and went along with it until I actually started paying attention to these “GOP Christians”. Now I just want the leaders of this country to be good decent humans who are going to make the world better for our kids and never ever Trump!
I don't care what their relationship is, I just know that Fauci stands behind Trump at those briefings while he lies to the American people and says nothing. Goes on TV interviews right after and contradicts Trump but not during. And people die. Not a good man.
In Trump's appalling physical condition, he couldn't wrestle a flea.
Trump supports the NRA before he supports our troops who had a bounty over their heads.
iPhone stans and Trump supporters the same people
It's run by TFP Action. Trump for President. Can't believe most students feel this way. But they did have a fit when Obama did graduation. It's got to be a plant or something!
He being trump only cares about religion when he has photo op or is pandering for votes
Whether you want Trump for president or not, Biden's statement is unquestionably racist and should disqualify him from the presidency.
Who the Hell cares what this tertiary-syphilitic maniac has to say, anymore? Trump thinks he's God.
Says TFP Action. Could that be Trump for President??
Try explaining that to someone like Trump, who thinks he's the sole God.
Just a reminder: Trump is an old school bigot, in that....he’s still trying to flame old fears of Catholics.

If to not vote for Trump but also eschew Biden is a personal aesthetic choice it might make sense. But to reject Trump as unfit to govern, and not vote for Biden, is “nonsensical.”

Four words for Trump: The Jonathan Swan interview.
I'm starting to think the people who say the Republican party is dead because of Trump don't know many conservatives.
If it's 2016 all over again, that means Russia is balls deep in the Trump campaign at this point.
Biden serious about picking Susan Rice? Given that her son is a high key Trump supporter?
We'll, I'm sure The Atlantic will retract their story and immediately do a deep dive into the FBI misleading the FISA Court in order to spy on the Trump campaign.  Right?
People making the world worse. FaceBook and other social media sites that value profits over facts.
Maybe from Red Cross but Trump won't send any.
It's already being normalized in the media. Yes, COVID-19 is obviously an enormous issue but Trump's transparent efforts to suppress/manipulate votes is not being covered as such but only being reported in compartmentalized and vague ways. The press is ignoring the big picture.
These questions seem based on the notion that somehow Trump will perform well at the debates. He won't. He was terrible in the debates against Hillary. At worst, the debates will be a wash for Biden and won't affect the horserace.
Maybe We should billboard Trump’s Tweets. The UN Jobs report, That might help...... LOL

In an abrupt reversal, President Donald Trump is encouraging voters in the critical swing state of Florida to vote by mail after months of criticizing the practice—and while his campaign and the GOP challenge Nevada over its new vote-by-mail law.

I dont want to "defeat Trump" in November.   He isn't the focus or the goal.  Compassion, progress, and equity are some of my goals and aspirations. I wish they were more widespread.
“Trump wins 2nd term.”
Let’s do it like Trumpy would. The one occasion with which I agree: The Trump campaign would pay US, in advance, $500,000,000 per day for use of OUR house for campaign activities. That’s a bargain for the use of our collective history as a backdrop for campaign activities.
This is so upsetting. I blame Trump for all of it. #TrumpLies #TrumpVirusDeathToll160K
Not just us! If we had listened to somebody besides each other, Trump would have not gotten past us!
And THAT'S why Trump will win again. Because it's about him even when nobody was talking about him. Joe was saying they're hiding Biden (correct) and he's in a significant mental decline (also correct) and instead of arguing that point the response is what about Trump
Trump's "it is what it is," says Fallon, "reminds me of that moment after the attack on Pearl Harbor when FDR said, 'Eh, what're ya gonna do?'"
The no-audience, low-laughter Tonight Show monologue about Trump's HBO/Axios interview has an extra layer of eerie moodiness appropriate for our grim time.
actually no! But then again! Most of us political types are used to picking media types! Not that Obama and Trump are examples of your wisdom.
There are big differences, of course, re the Nixon pardon vs one for Trump.  Do any of those differences make it less likely that Pence pardon’s him?

You choose to believe that TikTok really collects data for Chinese government, and I consider it skeptical. That’s why you think what they are doing make sense. But I just said that TikTok might be innocent and Trump is still doing that because he wants to win back some trust.
In an abrupt reversal, President Donald Trump is encouraging voters in the critical swing state of Florida to vote by mail after months of criticizing the practice — and while his campaign and the GOP challenge Nevada over its new vote-by-mail law.
That tiktok collects data for the CCP is always skeptical. It is also possible that Trump chose to do this because he wants to look good for the coming election. We don’t really know what is true. So this thread seems meaningless.
I wonder what the reactions would be if a clip of Trump saying #ItIsWhatItIs to  was played at every funeral from each COVID-19 related death. How would that go over?

Thank you Mr. President Donald J Trump,  no man has the courage you have,  your place in History has already been established, since the first Executive Order signed by you in 2017.
Biden will enable us to become a full blown plutocracy. Trump is trying the same thing, but Trump is also causing civil unrest, which I believe is what will save our future. A Biden victory will usher in complacency and leftism will lose all it's momentum.

Option 3, Trump wins and in 4 years the Dems can give us a worthy candidate rather than waste another 8 years begging for scraps. I'll be writing in. Best case scenario with Biden still permanently fucks us in the long term.
If Trump wins and comes into WH and continues to play the justice game for 4 yrs as he has, we wont win anything get media out, all those politicians who have committed crimes, out for good and exercise power.
Also Pelosi, all democrats have sold USA to China, I cant wait until communism shuts your mouth, and you say maybe with trump it would have been different, Ukraine: Poroshenko awards Orders of Ukraine to US Senators McCain and Graham

I don't think Biden is going to make anything better, he's gonna trap us in for another 8 years of no change. Trump we can knock out in just 4 years.
bishop? with that photo for profile, that which you say about President Trump has all to say about your character, you deserve a communist nation, when it does you'll remember this day this tweet.
The U.S. is averaging 65,000 new infections a day, and more than 1,000 people a day are dying from COVID-19. In total, nearly 160,000 Americans have died of a COVID-19 infection, and focusing only on case fatality essentially ignores that number.
By the time the other side of America realizes we needed a character like Trump's to fight this fight, it would be TOO LATE, and for that they will have what they deserve communism. "Trump on fate of TikTok: China is 'absolutely' stealing our data" |
Trump goes full authoritarian Dictator because a bunch of TICTOK teens made him look like a Fool. Will be challenge in court and he will lose. But until then TICTOK is going no where anyone ever hear of this thing called a VPN.

His 'vengeful soul' you are using very slandering words, I ask you do you know all the truth that he knows from that whitehouse desk? Is what you know truth, President Trump is fighting the War you would runaway like a coward, the truth will be revealed, u will witnessed.
I like that, "accidental conservative". After voting Democrat my adult life I jumped to President Trump in 2016 and have watched Democrats descend into madness since then. Now I'm questioning everything. Has it always been this bad but there wasn't a Trump to expose it?
Hard to conceive of any American of color voting for a person whose own wife says he is psychotic - unless they already own a MAGA hat.  If my hunch is correct, then Trump will be the candidate hurt by West running.
I think the public knows most than enough to judge Trump's character and leadership competence.  He's been on TV forever.  Similarly, all I want to hear from Biden is who will replace him in a year or two, and what few concessions to progressives he might make.
Trump says the results of OBAMAGATE should come out soon ... "It's breath-taking."
I hope that Trump's attorneys give him the go ahead. Either way, he may do it anyway. In which case, it will stand for a while. People need some money, but so much as to give them more money for staying home than working.
Did Biden denounce anyone burning the bible? NO!  Trump did!  Trump is no angel, and we didn't hire an angel or a man of the cloth. We hired a man who will defend us against our enemies, and will bear the burden for the lost lives of our soldiers and the lives of the enemy.

Yeah it kind of does since Trump has tried to do everything the Rep have promised for 15 years. Oh and your dad was a traitor.
What’s the theory?  If Biden wins I’m guessing 2 week Mask Mandate then they just quit reporting it and push to put Trump in jail for all the deaths. I think Trump still wins 45 states and this isn’t even close.

My Life is fine, I am retired with mulitple houses in mulitple countries.  I made record income thanks to Trump caring about only the Rich.  So I dont need your prayers they are worthless anyway if you support the Con man In Office
OOO And forgot Trump ONLY cares about himself and is using the Backs of Americans to make money because he SUCKS as a Businessman.
Now the Facts.  Trump is Impeached..  Always Will be Impeached.  Economy is stagnant COVID isnt inflated, it is under-reported.  and Only on causing violence on the streets are the Cops.
trump — 🤦‍♂️DO NOT OPEN THE SCHOOLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!        🤦‍♂️👎😩🤦‍♂️😢😱🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️.               At least ACT like a president who cares!  (From Florida).
Thank you, President Donald J Trump,
trump - People are NOT happy that you are president!!!!!  🤦‍♂️
you will.  Seems alot of trump supporters are willing to DIE for him look at Herman Cain
November cannot come fast enough.  To get rid of the true Virus to America......  Con Man Donald J Trump.
As much as a joke as it sounds, there are definitely a good number of republicans who won’t be voting for Trump unfortunately
Fauci backs Birx's coronavirus assessment following criticism from President Trump
Welcome!, when you look back at yourself, you'll see it was an evil spirit that got possession of you, its not the real you, I watch it in my sisters who think Im a threat, crazy, etc., you feel better? Look for in Youtube Donald Trump the long road to WhiteHouse, you will cry.
Thanks Clown.  I will this Republican thanks to Donald J Trump will vote Blue on my entire ticket.
Never-Before-Seen Trump Tax Documents Show Major Inconsistencies
Why? Please don't go there for an alleged child sex trafficker.   via
Did Trump just say Epstein’s death could have been suicide or murder? He couldn’t care less that Maxwell was a child sex trafficker, and evangelicals still cling to this false idol.
This is how you interview this president. Also, it’s clear that Trump has absolutely no comprehension skills whatsoever. Good job  .
Don't confuse Trump's rants (disagreement with something to which we also disagree), his intention to do something (the method proposed may change, his/our intention remains the same), and his version of the truth (our benefit, we need to get back to work/school). We understand!
Whenever they are, skip the live audience and deprive Trump of fuel.
If Trump wasn’t President he’d be knocking on Trumps door asking for money.
Not soon enough. NOW!  House Democrats call postmaster general to testify on USPS changes under Trump
trump - WAY TO LITTLE WAY TO LATE!!!!!!😊😊😊🤦‍♂️🤥🤥🤦‍♂️🤥🤥
And Democrats use it proudly. For control, to shame &amp; destroy the lives of every American because they lost an election. They would rather people be homeless, jobless, hopeless then thrive in the Trump economy. It's sickening. Their need for power kills.
I think this has a very long answer. I think that Trump is #PutinsPuppet Putin is literally a agent of chaos. So i think that the virus is now a variable that plays into distracting the world from his RISK advances to restore the #USSR
Trump has made nothing mandatory. That’s why Dems hate him.
When he came down the escalator at tRump tower &amp; announced he was running &amp; made the first hateful speech
This gives President Trump the win. Democrats have zero platform, zero implementable ideas, zero candidate. The only reason low information people will vote Joe Biden is because the legacy media has succeeded at making the dummies hate President Trump for no reason.
Unbelievable Fixel Castro must be having a party his dream come true in American soil, left, left, left.  All this because of Trump? She was not supposed to loose, fight back America Like your life depends on it.
I've said it Trump will win by a98% of the vote
Condition it on no live-audience. Deprive Trump of fuel
THERE'S only one way to avoid this democrats Vote for Trump, your life depends on it, Dem Politicians don't care about you the voter.
Right to Pray in Public Schools, sign by President Donald J Trump,  one more MAGA moment. Unbelievable that it needs to be done, this way.  Thank you God.
Thanks, but I doubt this is going to save the election. And if Trump wins again, anything you’ve investigated up until then will be totally meaningless. There’s no such thing as oversight when a dictator is ruling the country.
Truth be told, Trump and friends are delaying roll out of bailout for the people. Why? Stock Market manipulation. Now is a good time to buy, cause stocks will jump on that news. Trump is going to take advantage of the poor for selfish stock gains.
Lmao! This coming from a Trump robot!
IT GOES ABOVE OBAMA!  McCabe said Gang of Eight (Ryan, Nunes, McConnell, Burr) had no objection investigating Trump. Why hasn't Dem Media been all over Burr since May for manipulating his stock with secret info about COVID?

I’ve lost several. I know NO trump supporters who have ended relationships with Marxist’s. Tell u something?
It’s not embarrassment. That would be a democrat. And why would they put out a trump sign? It’s fear for our lives which is sad.
No. No they don't. But you can bet they will try to indict President Trump on hoax charges after he leaves office!
STFD puppet. Trump Don’t GAF about you.
I love these videos, YOU ARE MY PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP,  anxiously waiting to Vote, March, I stand with you.
This is so stupid. President Trump has never hinted that he wouldn't leave if he didn't win the election. This is just Democrat fan-fiction, fantasy genre.
#VoterFraud is beginning. If you think they will ever let President Trump win you're wrong. They learned their lesson from 2016 and we will never have an honest election again.
Live, from Berlin this Saturday yesterday in Germany, - when will it happen in USA.  We know from BLM rallies manifestations nothing will happen? lets do it America, lets stand by Our Man, President Trump &amp; tell him lock them up &amp; We Want HCW MAGA!
ms huckabee- Please immediately give us a list of what trump will do to “rebuild” our economy &amp; WHY he HAS not done it up to now— Guess what????  We all know you are also telling lies!!!! Susan in Florida 🤦‍♂️😊🤦‍♂️🤥😩
Mr. Scaramucci— WHY don’t the people inside trump’s campaign SPEAK UP?  They are not helping the U.S. by remaining silent!!!!  🤦‍♂️🤥🤦‍♂️🤥
Sex Traffickers Sentenced to Combined 81 Years in Prison  via  BaQery
If you haven’t seen what threat it poses, then that’s because you haven’t looked.  Until Trump said he was banning it, this was a bipartisan issue
We are NOT even thru the 1st wave. Trump WON'T put the restrictions on things to make this country safe but he is already thinking that it is over because he has worn his mask for 3wks. Well Mr President it is NOT that simple. Make EVERYONE wear masks and stay at home.
I have seen more people show up to a small town's memorial day parade, than what these people are trying to show supporters to Trump.
40,000 people came over from China after Trump enacted his so-called “ban’, which was only for most foreign nationals who had recently visited China. It wasn’t a ban against everyone from China. Also, the virus was already in other countries. As usual, Trump did a half ass job.
I see where you were going w/this but trash trucks do their job day in &amp; day out, no holidays but Christmas morning, no matter what vile messes we give them. Trump does anything to avoid any &amp; all his responsibility/work &amp; he IS THE VILE MESS we have to deal with!🤦🏻‍♀️
Thanks for video ... Very informative video, inferring that Trump is not culpable. Wonder if Epstein's Little Black Book still exists, I notice that the attorney did say the book would need to be authenticated by someone, housekeeper or Jeffrey Epstein (but he's dead).
trump - NO PAYROLL TAX CUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    🤦‍♂️🤥🤦‍♂️🤥🤦‍♂️🤥🤦‍♂️🤥🤦‍♂️🤥🤦‍♂️
Facts as in this is an article from April about how many Chinese flew directly to the US mostly from Jan 1 thru Jan 31 when Trump put a travel ban in place? Facts like this Jan 31 travel ban was called rac*st and premature by the entire Democrat party including Biden? Good facts.
I make fun of Trump all the time.
2 week mandatory masks from Biden then we hear how Trump could’ve ended it that fast.
You do realise that Tik Tok is being banned because Trump has EGO problems regarding empty rallies...   Besides... Tik Tok isn't what you should be afraid of... IT'S ME!
I believe that Herman Cain took Trump’s words as gospel and eventually he came under the surge of the virus. Many of those souls who listen to this president will suffer the same fate.
No truth to that at all. Millions of Americans have voted by mail, including Trump and Don Jr. Plus, no sitting President has the right to delay the election. It is set in stone.
As usual NY Governor brings forth the facts and data that follows. Trump’s briefing information is out and out vague promises and wrong data.
Looks like Trump just solidified the democratic base... Just kidding! He did that when he said I was a hoax
trump - We cannot cannot wait for the election &amp; YOU will be gone!!!!!  You will HAVE TO LEAVE — and we will all CHEER!!!!!🤦‍♂️
You really think Trump banning TikTok is because people are "exposing" him/the government? Its about what they're doing with the data they collect. Even some of the most progressive people like  know that....
President Trump never tried to postpone the election 😂 The Lincoln Project for facts. Really? They are rewriting history to be "slave" based and you think they are a good source for info?
I'm simultaneously disappointed that this is what it'll take to convince young Republicans that Trump is bad and thrilled because he just lost the vote of my entire generation.

At the very bottom of the vid is President Trump walking toward the center door after working for the American people all day long. The flashes are the press taking photos.
Sorry, wall prevents violations of Federal Law  (drug-smuggling, human-trafficking) and National Security (prevents addiction/overdose deaths from foreign sources). Both override environmental issues! Article II  Trump shall execute laws (federal). Can't infringe on his duty!
wear a trump mask IDGAF JUST FING WEAR ONE! selfish assholes 🤬🤬🤬🤯
I get a lot everyday ... I just delete them. Trump has more important things to deal with.
trump-what a great idea!  We will ALL drain the swamp and N-O-T VOTE FOR YOU!!!  We can’t wait🤦‍♂️🤥👎
Seemed to be being ignored like all Trump orders as I signed up for mail in ballot Wednesday and Boom got it today.
You know what he said, You ain't black if you support Trump! To me that is his number 1dumbest comment so far..
If Europe had more cases, it would show, tests or no tests. So for Trump to make that stupid comment CONSTANTLY only goes to show that he ONLY cares about his ego and NOT the American people.
The umbrella? Is that SOP in the Trump WH?
Cool you made this easy for me. Patio pizza and owner Guy Caligiuri, in St James Long Island (NY) is shit and has been added to the I will never spend a dime in this store it is a trump store list
My journey: I voted mostly #GOP for 25 yrs until 2016. Then I read both party platforms side-by-side. Then, #Trump as its candidate? His LIFETIME showed exactly who he is, NOT his words. I left the GOP &amp; told them why, even if it didn't matter. It cleansed my soul. #VoteBlue2020.
He has been building his back up plan for months
He has been building his army since June. Unapologetically preparing to attack anyone that opposes. #Gaslighter #OrangeArmy  #TrumpThreatensAmerica #HeMustGo #WPE
Trump supporters are probably being mean because you propped yourself as a pro Trump guy for months, probably to get likes, and then you drop the “I’m voting Biden” bombshell. What did you expect?  Don’t be so weak minded to even contemplate suicide. Be better than that
Many of us conservatives are afraid to support POTUS openly. But I am telling you there are plenty of closet supporters who will re-elect Trump regardless of what the far left polls. The butt hurt will begin again unless the Republicans take the house and keep the Senate.
No, Trump really won’t have to answer to anything. If he wins this election, he will be a full-blown authoritarian. Nobody will be able to say anything to him unless they want to risk finding themselves in prison.
trump -  YOU are going to LOOSE THE 2020 ELECTION — LOOSE - LOOSE - LOOSE - 😄🤣😄😃😜
Do it ... America loves Trump
I don’t think it was accidental at all - it was the last ditch effort to unseat Trump - China, Dems, Communists - they are all in on it.
You're clueless!  Obviously, you know nothing about the economy. If Bush screwed it up, Obama had plenty of time to fix it, just like Trump fixed Obama's piss poor economy!
You forget to add this to the choices.  Trump &amp; the current administration.
He has done alot in 3-1/2 yrs, when you consider all that has been thrown at him. Just one legal procedure disarms, He's had Congress, Justice dept., assassin attempts&amp;[2 ticks you spray &amp;dont die, pelosi,schummer]. A TITAN,  my vote is his, TRUMP 2020, Best President of USA ever
1985, the same Man as today, he won me over, MAGA 2020. I Worked Hillary's campaign, walked, knocked in Little Havana, Miami;Obama's country,-not Hillary she was detested.Walked it with an American who came from Ohio, it wasn't happening. Researched Trump after 20 videos I SAW IT
247 people watching Bidens live stream. There is no way the actual number of people who will vote for him is this high. If a pollster asked me who I was voting for I'd say Biden just because I don't want my life ruined by Democrats. But I would vote Trump on election day.
But the legacy media told me Biden was trouncing President Trump! 🙄 2020 is going to be 2016 all over again but with bigger tears and more hysterical reactions
Help me here... trump wants to delay the ELECTION but it’s all cool for schools to open... #TrumpVirus #Election2020 #NobodyLikesTrump #COVID19 #ThursdayThoughts
Ohh. I like this. Let President Trump threaten Article 51 and see how quickly the lockdowns, masks and Covid go away!

Please President Trump, veto the mail-in voting for national elections.  We the people can and will stand in the polling sites while social distancing. If the mail-in voting does happen America will die in a rushing Blue wave.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a “delay” to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
A million miles is a little far fetched. Our focus right now is register voters, beat Trump/GOP, and have a mix of moderate/progressive agenda legislation that gets signed. The future is bright for progressives if younger voters vote. Let's focus on number one, voters.Actually it's too expensive. The deductibles render it useless for people like me. At least with Trump I am not fined for buying useless insurance. If you need any test or MRI you have to pay $5000 every yr before they will a percentage. My house only cost $10,000.
Good. Its about time someone calls out the media for lies and for pushing agendas instead of reporting actual news. Theres so much going on in the world and all the media covers is CV, Trump and protesting. Pathetic.
Joe Biden and Donald Trump are both rapists and pedophiles. But sure, He GoEs To ChUrCh. Tf outta here, neither of them are religious like they claim. We are a melting pot, you people need to get off your Christianity high horse.
What is pathetic Cochran, you could not get to work on time and when you did, all you did on WGN Radio is blast Trump, not take calls from listeners, so you blew a $1,000,000.00 a year PLUS job! Your wife I am sure is proud!

Trump and Barr used a loophole to deploy the National Guard to U.S. cities. It's time to close it.  A path has been laid for future presidents to make the National Guard their own personal security force. Unless we act, we are inviting future abuses.
You do realize Trump donates his entire salary, right? And the US government doesn't exist to give out/redistribute money.
Buy American? Trump makes over $1 million from store selling products of foreign origins
I am so sick of this evil! Pray for the children and that President Trump keeps on saving them. He has saved many through cutting funds on planned parenthood, and by stopping trafficking rings. The other guy wants to sniff kids. Vote for President Trump to save the children. 🙏🏼
Omg 😆 people are waking up and standing up for our #POTUS!! WATCH: Crowd shouts down reporter during Trump presser  via
We seen it Jimmy! Most people watch FOX! How much you bet that Nervous Nancy and Chuckie Schumer make a deal by Monday?  There's no way they will let Trump take care of the people on his own. That would be the end of Biden and chances for Dems to take the Senate &amp; keep House!  🇺🇲
Additionally, if we’re talking about the presidential election, we can’t pretend that Joe hasn’t had his fair share of racist moments. That’s not to say that he’s as bad as Trump, but I don’t think voting Joe in could be considered voting out racism
U.S. Intelligence: GOP Is Accepting Russian Help for Trump

Trump is insane.  Thanks to  we already have those protections.

I mean a dude did throw a shoe at him. Not that people wouldn't at Trump he's just scared to let people that close
Media is so fake Bill Clinton is a pedi yet you won’t see it cause it doesn’t negatively affect trump 🤷🏼‍♂️ a lot of y’all fav celebs sick too ...
Trump 2020!!!
President Trump knows he’s in danger. May God keep our President safe. In Jesus name I pray these words. Amen 🙏🏼 🕊
I'm confused. Is  now a supporter of #obamacare "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
It reminds me when bugs bunny tales the Kangaroo to batten down the hatches, The kangaroo says I already did batten them down, Bugs says well batten then down again. This is what trumps executive order sounds like. Trying to make a law or law already exist. Typical Trump #idiot
But ex trumpets who don’t want to vote for a democratic will vote for him. He’ll take votes from tRump 🤣🤣🤣
This negotiating strategy reminds me of the way Trump negotiated with Kim Jong Un.
I’m one of many too scared to change their plan due to circus acts like this. Couldn’t stomach it under ACA dare not under trump. Someone is always waiting to pull the rug out from under us. And to think what $$ we’ve put into it. Sick.
Why are politicians coming out the woodworks to condemn WAP but haven’t shown this much condemnation for Trump’s response to COVID or passed laws against police brutality. This is why America is what it is. Politicians with their priorities all messed up.
I’m just learning that a possible bait/switch could be in the works. trump is such a narcissist, I don’t think he can handle not winning, by any means necessary. So, maybe he is looking for a way out; health related or something, so he won’t look “bad”.
oh yeah. no. family, love, friendships. all have equality. at that point it is the individual relationship that matters and even then some things trump that.
is such a spineless sycophant he won’t even attend negotiations for Americans. He gave up the Senate long ago to Trump. He’s so afraid of a presidential veto he has to have it ok’d first. The Senate can OVERRIDE a veto by 2/3, but you’ll notice he’s NEVER done it.
Trump has never heard of him.
Biden wants your guns. Don't hate trump that much to hand it over. He really wants to take them.
We already have protection for pre existing conditions under Obamacare. Trump is in court trying to take it away. KEEP UP
Imagine the proctor "Mr trump, what are your feelings about the 2nd amendment?"  "Take the guns 1st, due process 2nd" "I banned bump stocks."

Trump says he's prepared to sign executive orders on coronavirus aid
Rest in Peace Mr. Cain.
Sure, Trump wasn't a target either...
tRump will kill them. 🤢
Yeah, well your Canadian so....
I smell a rat. Trump just did this because it's the most popular feature of ACA. He did this so that there is less public resistance when he tries to kill the rest of the ACA.  In court, or however he can. Gives cover to GOP Senate and SCOTUS too.
Oh that thing already in the ACA that the trump administration is suing trying to get rid of?  You really aren't very smart Boris
From our leaders and now from this Trump guy that he chose to run the    It’s not the workers who are calling for this place to run this way, we want to serve and do the best for the American people. We need more voices on our side
Trump wants chaos.
Terrific essay by ⁦ wherein he explains the terrain of a conservatism rooted in a thicker conception of community and society.  (Don’t tell him, but social conservatives have been saying all of this for a mere three hundred years).
I knew someone had been doing something... I had a feeling that close to voting time something had to  come out that an investigation would prove us right all along about the SOB in the WH!
We kinda do need him,Trump is about to send us back to the 50's lol
Yes because no matter what could come up couldn’t ever be worse than what Trump is on a daily basis.
So y'all want voter fraud Kanye fucken West all he's doing is trying to help Trump yall knw he's Trump's lil nigga im sure in private he say you my nigga Bunns ijs you vote for kanye takes from Joe an helps Trump win its a set up ijs
JoeBiden: I can’t believe I have to say this, but we can’t let Donald Trump open up the Grand Canyon for uranium mining.
Even though there was no bomb dropped tonight. Trump tossed out a few hints. Saying "if im around" this wasn't about the election. He knows he will win hands down. Bread crumbs folks. Follow along.
Nobody knows better than Trump that the overwhelming majority of his base is non college educated low information voters. I mean hell even the educated ones will tell you basic English words mean something entirely different than what a dictionary says.
This is amazing, but  has no intention of getting justice for her. He only listens to Mitch, Trump and Barr and they want no part of holding officers accountable. He is an embarrassment to our state and his position.
Biden is a better candidate than Donald Trump .
Trump has said worse lol
Trump reminds me of the article where reporters went into Eastern Ky in 2016 and interviewed people who wanted to keep their insurance under the Affordable Care Act but wanted Trump to get rid of Obamacare. They got quite a shock when they found out it was the same thing.
$1.5 trillion isn't the middle.  $2 trillion is, and they wouldn't be able to agree on it anyway.  Has Trump given up on the FBI building?
Well a vote against Biden is a vote from Trump. Lol
The ACA already does this. And tRump is in court trying to overturn it.  What an idiot he is.
Good Trump. Need more of this.
So.... Obamacare but not signed by a Black guy ?  Trump is desperate to steal everything from Obama’s legacy.
What were YOU wearing?! All we saw on national TV was Trump in a suit and tie. You sound kinda bitter, Chris.

On a side note. Has there ever been a more debasing job than a WH press pooler during Trump? Even a fluffier for Ron Jeremy in 1977 wasnt this debasing.
Trump beating the media up!!!
So does Trump's EO only pertain to unemployment benefits or does it address the stimulus checks of $1200 also?
And until public health is vital to Donald tRump, the economy will remain sick.
What’s with this save the children stuff all the trump supporters are all of the sudden pushing?
Definitely Trump's Fault !
Yea you know that’s not what is happening. Republicans are all the sudden pretending to care about debts and deficits again so they can kill any deal and make Trump look like a hero saving the day. But I guess keep doing the political operative spin thing on twitter.
Trump talking about us!
I think #Trump just turned into a Democrat nominee during this press conference
When Donald J Trump got in office, he had to say "What the Hell" has been going on in the oval office?! He's lowered drug prices, and much more. There is no way to spell out all he's done in 1,000 tweets. Drugs, Jobs, Criminal Justice Reform, Opportunity Zones, China, on and on!
Trump EO, Dems won't get their giveaways
Trump and #MoscowMitch refuse to meet in the middle.
But Trump is still denying it
If he’s dumb enough to take AND post a picture like for the public, imagine the kind of private blackmail material Trump/Cohen had on him in 2016 to make him and the other evangelicals fall in line with Trump
He will have his “I Have Sinned,forgive me”speech just like Daddy did. The ? Is will he do it just before the election so  daddy trump can welcome him back to the flock - he is the redeemer right?
Ok so what did trump actually say/ mean ? Sounds like he’s not signing an executive order ?  No details so we’re supposed to guess
Trump is going to single handily destroy Social Security via his payroll tax idea - so if the virus doesn’t kill our senior citizens they’ll starve to death while missing their medications!
160,000+ Americans dead from Covid-19 and  is working on f**king TikTok. So good to have a President focused on the important problems. Thanks Trump voters!
Trump just said "hopefully if im still here"
Trump talks about "cities and states that have been in trouble for years of bad management," but neglects to realize that bad management is the fucking President of the United States. Deferring payroll taxes? I'm working. I don't need a deferral, kthx.
No way Joe Biden would have done a better job on the China Virus! Of course we'll never know. These jackass's like Juan Williams act like Joe would have done better. Does anyone truly believe a weak person is better at gettin' things done than a strong person. Is Trump! NO WAY!
Might sound weird, but i think if trump was going to drop a bomb statement the press wouldn't be there in these numbers
I just tuned into    WTF is going on with tRump? He's giving a press conference at his golf club with his golfing buddies as an audience?  #TrumpIsNotWell  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
I care and then I don't. If he's helping Trump, he's not our friend. Maybe he should stop playing Jesus and get some treatment.
JoeBiden: I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That’s why as president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone.
Just like you did,  in 8 yrs VP and the other 35ish years? Yeah right and no thanks Joe. You've been key in establishing the swamp, over your many years. President Trump's done more for us and our great country in 3.5 yrs, than you've done, in over 40. Trump 2020!

You dont know what you’re talking about, there is just as much science to prove you wrong! you just want anything to destroy trump since you have absolutely nothing to offer America but hate!

How could you let the Courier Journal call you a Trump Democrat. You’d better explain yourself. Many of your supporters are angry about this.
Amy, I’ve supported you all along, but the Courier Journal article is very disturbing. If you try to identify with Trump you will lose our support and the election. Trump will not win this election.
Trump gets more done in three days on the golf course than Nancy Pelosi has in her Life!
A pro Biden Republican makes sense but like you I've never heard of or met a pro Trump Democrat.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering people through the expansion, a much higher matching share than for low-income disabled and elderly people traditionally covered by Medicaid.
You really think he was a “good Christian” before he hooked up with Trump?   You are naive at best. Wake up, he is and was a slime-ball hypocrite, using the school as a cash cow for his lifestyle.
I do know there are plenty of Pro-Biden Republicans though. Don’t personally know of any pro trump democrats. We’ve got better sense.
Twitter Democrats are deleting conservative followers from accounts and have been all damn day. Do something about these dishonest Democrat cheats President Trump because Democrats feel compelled to cheat and  can't win without cheating.
Booker is all class...McGrath is a pro Trump supporter. But fuck mitch so #SettleforAmy
She doesn’t praise Trump. You must be listening to Republican lies.
What is wrong with you? It appears you stand with Russia you’re doing their dirty work for them and giving their talking points against Biden. Republicans have really upset me standing with corrupt, fraudulent trump. It’s a sad situation. Put your country first ! Vote him out
It's interesting how all these Idiot's come out and talk about how Trump blew it on the China Virus! If they had the answer and sat on it, then they have Murder on their hands.  Monday morning quarterbacks.  Pitiful!

Nothing. Don’t get hung up on your numbers. It’s all about RESIST so stop posting whiny tweets and post instead about what you see in your community and what you know about tRump and his supporters and post it.
I mean tbf it is just not the reasons they think it is. Trump will be the last president of the United States.
What's Trump doing about that?
Yeah, they should have given Trump the money he wanted so he would make more money on his hotel. 😏

Yes, cause 100% by the Covid scare, over reaction and lies by the democrates, what was Joe Biden doing when Trump was closing down China, he was calling him a racist!
I am his supporter, and I am getting behind Amy McGrath. We all must! Mitch McConnell has done more to damage this country than even Donald Trump has. #DitchMitch

Thank you Tracey for the pic in your Trump bikini!❤️❤️
They just need the real estate to exist, so they can extract equity out of it when necessary.   This is also what many Russian oligarchs and mobsters did with Trump Tower. They bought a bunch of the condos for cash, Trump asked no questions, and they sat empty for years.
Hey Joy, the reason Trump is always trying 2 keep ppl focused on Lying about Joe Biden taken guns away, is because he's trying to cut SS, med, and Medicaid.  With the rest of his crooked party!!!
I think “disavowed” is a pretty strong word for what Trump said-  “Started speaking very quickly” (FALSE) and  “wasn’t happy” and  “You’d have to ask them.”  He didn’t mention “very fine people” tho, so I guess it’s all good.
And the Trump campaign magically had a statement ready to go along with that “both sides” intel report that just happens to mention a potential Biden VP pick. Seems legit.
Rove is working with Trump to reprise this number. Not again, not ever.
I’m not gonna give them too much credit for their intelligence level either so yeah, we can stand back and watch. Hopefully from a safe distance like maybe a few hundred miles. I have not yet figured out why most bikers are Trump supporters. You talk about two different breeds🤪
And if you need any further proof that both sides Intel article drops with a Trump campaign statement ready to go, the Trump campaign statement just happens to mention a Biden front runner for VP.
Nah. Noose tightening for Obama and Hillary. Don't worry. Trump won't send them to Gitmo.
If only we had a president worthy of the office. My daddy once told me, "Never trust a man who lies". What ever happened to all those promises this president made?
I do like his Trump impressions but that's about as far as it goes for me. The daughter obviously an idiot lol
POST OFFICE !!   You are all dealing with LIVES here - many get meds by mail, voting can be done properly by mail (our ballots took over a week to move 5 miles).  IF there is an FBI or any defense money in there, Trump needs to rejoin the Democratic or Reform Party.
Russia is working to undermine Democrat Joe Biden
Trump won’t let them release election interference stuff unless they do the both sides thing. China has taken Trump to the woodshed and gave Ivanka and Jared a blank check. Please with that Trump campaign BS
Do you ever wonder why problems don't get solved?  Usually it is due to one or more of these: - focusing on the wrong thing - allowing emotion to trump critical thinking - lack of a decision making process  #decisionmaking #criticalthinking

He puts the thoughts that have been swirling inside my head into beautiful paragraphs. This is true of the Biden/Trump race, as well. Biden was not my first pick, but he's the only choice if we are to build a better democracy down the road.
Well today two big things happened: Trump’s rape case was allowed to proceed without executive privilege, and McGahn can be subpoenaed by Congress. Is there more? Looks like things are unraveling.
I’m convinced that behind every Trump supporter, there’s a fetish for foreign women

Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, was guided by his Christian faith in politics, business and his personal life, his pastor said at his funeral Friday.
trump* is SELFISH, GREEDY, &amp; a COMPLETE and TOTAL IMBECILE.  The fact that we all KNOW he is STEALING from taxpayers... HE DOES NOT CARE
I don't think trump* has a Prayer in HELL, trying to convince SENSIBLE people, he is right. Obama didn't MAKE a dime on his "vacation" because he doesn't OWN property to which he would CHARGE - HIS SECRET SERVICE to stay overnight, which in turn THAT $$ goes into his POCKET
Public health disaster right there. Thanks trump.

women and children will cry themselves to sleep at night because of you. What a bad human. Tell Trump’s ass hello. Do they pay you extra to be the chair of his re-election? Or do they just require you to hurt/kill constituents? Your legacy will be pain. Shame on you.
It looks to me like an underhanded tactics that Rodger Stone has done in the past and is trying to do now in order for Trump to steal the election just as he did in 2016 with the Russians someone needs to look into this and expose it do your thing Lincoln project

President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he’s considering delivering his Republican convention acceptance speech from the White House.
“Whether you call it Vote by Mail or Absentee Voting, in Florida the election system is Safe and Secure, Tried and True,” President Trump tweeted Tuesday.
Trump will stop at nothing, and I mean nothing, to get what he wants. Don’t ever be surprised what he does. He loves power and thinking that everyone worships him. He will never admit, he is a loser.
some of these pictures look photoshopped, and if they are, shame on you. You would protect Trump, knowing he is connected with Epstein and Maxwell. You make me sick. To try and protect him.
Is that safe, we all know how  loves his kids , just, and not how normal people love them.  Tell all and send him and everyone involved, to Prison for life. America, our kids are worth more than someone like Trump. #WeWillVote #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

Totally false total lies not surprised from a trump supporter you do anything to keep the racist cheating liar in office until you realize he doesn't care about you or anyone else in America except himself he wants to be the dictator of America that will never happen
Yeah but people said the same shit in  2018 but it doesn’t inspire confidence when Dems constantly roll over for trump
Barack Obama was a true president and a Gentleman and intelligent he deserves our respect Trump are none of those
Trump does not deserve any respect he has no respect for anybody else in this country why does he deserve any respect he constantly lie and cheats the American people
If you ask voters in Indiana we've always known he's been just like Trump a liar a cheat and willing to do whatever he needs to to get what he wants even if it's illegal

I think we must realize that Trump is the consequence of decades of underlying rot. Sorry.
Look to the Biden Republicans to support the  Trump Democrat
Terfs are just the freakin worst. Hell, Trump supporters are often gleeful in their malice, but terfs are angry, angry, angry. The hate is just *right there.*
I wonder why they endorsed Joe Biden over Trump. Also mail in voting has always been a thing in the US and it’s been how people voted in elections like 1920 and 1864 with no problems whatsoever. I know you’re all about BS Charlie but this is the most blatant
Give the money directly to Trump and let him decide what to do with it!!
has there ever been any evidence of trump actually being mad about these ads or is this just something libs tell themselves so that they can feel like they owned trump
Y’all really still like Donald Trump huh?
They really just want Trump But Polite and I wish they'd just admit it already
President Trump claimed Monday that he has the authority to issue an executive order on mail-in ballots, whose increasing use, he argues, could increase election fraud and uncertainty, though it is is unclear what he could do to curtail the practice.

Anyone but trump
Trump has proven he will cheat and kill to win. Shutting down the post offices it's just another way of trying to win.
I wasn't a fan of Bill Clinton when he was elected and I was hated Trump even more when he was elected. I've learned to trust my instincts, neither of them should be in charged of any. Donald had a case against him and Epstein in New York involving a 13 year old girl.
You can't hold on to hate.  It will destroy you and the one you hate can win.  You may hate trump, use love of yourself to change what trump has done. Make changes through the love of yourself and others. Hate will make you like trump, love will change America.
We all know why trump wants to destroy Tik Tok - Tulsa. Another of his personal vendettas using the executive power to manipulate this election.  we see you.
Trump is doing a great job of that.
Clinton has rumors of having a child with a young girl long before he even ran for president. I was a fan of his when he ran. I don't like Trump either since he and Epstein had charges in New York due to a 13 girl. That only got dropped because the girl was threatened.

it’s truly a race against the clock huh, between microsoft buying tik tok and trump banning it😗 #riptiktok
trump doing more to get rid of tik tok than actively stop the spread of covid and declare the kkk a terrorsit organization is absolutely pathetic.

Thinking you are the president that just let his criminal friend out of prison.  Because he was old. You commit the crime, you do the time. You were just making sure he kept your name out of it. Can you say Prison for trump?

Wow first time we’ve heard this from the trump admin. It’s likely a desperate stretch to connect with a public who unfortunately have lost confidence in the White House

not people I know calling trump a genius and actually believing what they say...
I have to be honest. This is his reaction now, but in a couple months I will not be very surprised when he still goes along with it. It seems to be the way he’s been working. Experience dictates that he acts like Trump is crazy and than rubber stamps the whole way.
Trump is a threat to the constitution. If you can't see that then you're a dumbass
Treason is the only word for trump and Putin. He keeps calling Putin, but not because of the Bounties that was put on our soldier’s heads. He is worst than any other leader, even Hitler.#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
This is why I am against sending our kids back. Don’t think this virus is not effect our kids. It is and there are kids that has died. We have protected our kids, and now with no plan in place, trump wants to send them back. He is trying to kill our future.
It's pretty pathetic when you would rather have people suffer by having the economy get worse than to risk having Trump get re-elected if the economy improves.
One quality I could never stand is bullying others, to fuel their belief that they are better. Way back when, when I was in school, I stood up for the ones that was being bullied, and talked to everyone that was ignored by others. And I still do. That is why I don’t like trump.
But you agree with all the deaths he has caused? I have never seen America in such a horrible state. He is the worst leader in the world, past or present. But you go right ahead and help keep destroying and killing America and vote for Trump.
Godfather’s Pizza guy Herman Cain just died because he supported Trump’s anti- mask agenda at their Tulsa rally! Is this guy next?
Do not let him fool you, he knows exactly what he is doing.  Trump is doing what his best friend Putin wants him to do. Destroy America to weaken us.Trump is doing just that. He is killing everyone off.He hates Americans, he knows he is going to prison, so kill as many as he can.
Trump admits he reads the everything, that he reads a lot. But still didn’t know about the bounty on our troops head.
Trump's numbers in the polls must really be down for him to talk about delaying the election.
Gosh why ever would Trump be floating insanity about delaying the election and trying to suck all of the air out of the news cycle when the only thing that he's ever campaigned on is collapsing in flames
I take a nap, and wake up to Trump calling for a delay in the election. Sleep drunkenness to the max rn
On second thought. I forget with Trump that it can be BOTH.
BBC News reports, Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 U.S. presidential election until Americans can vote "properly, securely, safely." President continues assailing vote by mail option.
Must be something good in those new Maxwell documents. Don’t take Trump’s bait here. He was always gonna try this.
So let me try to understand this philosophy...for 4 years now social media freely and openly publishes lies about President Trump concerning Russia, Ukraine and Charlottesville, but censors world class doctors who share proven data that hydroxychloroquine helps treat COVID.This was the game of trump all along. He wanted his elite cohorts to be able to profit from sickness and death and hydroxy puts money into his own pocket. He runs the government like a money laundering scheme, which he’s done for decades.

Trump’s problem is that he never exited campaign mode. His motivation for being president is simply that he wants to be president, devoid of any real policy (and because he took a Black man being elected president as a personal affront).
I really believe to be a Republican these days you have to be brain dead if you support Trump.

Not sure which would be worse... biden, trump, or pelosi...i keep puking trying to decide.
Trump suggests delaying November election, something he doesn't have the power to do  - ABC News  (via
Why not show some true leadership Donnie? Instead he tweets: "2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA."
Aww the pedophile supporter thinks information a week behind spoonfed by politicians is close to the truth. When journalists join the politicians it has never been a good thing. trump's lap dog is willing spreading lies that will get people killed.Well coming from someone who is ignorant enough to worship trump it would be easy to not understand the truth even if it bit you on the ass. Could you understand that. 🤔
🖕we welcome everyone here. Trump is not just a danger to the US he is a danger to the global community. You don’t speak for us. If you don’t like free thinking open forums, you might try parler. Oh yes and one more 🖕.
Pathetic republican sheep trump and his 1% laughing at the little people (Working class) and not understanding what they are laughing about.
IDK about the China virus, but the Trump virus has, as of early 2020, mutated into something that science cant event identify. Hopefully we will have a vaccine by November 3rd.
Keep on it. We’ll make It. Constant pressure is still needed.  Ten years from now, Trump will be a forgotten president. His legacy will be best remembered as a kinda folks that usually doesn’t find itselves fighting for their lives in politics.  Anyway, Joe Biden Wins.
Vote all democrats out of office they are destroying America... trump 2020 and beyond... trump has done more for Americans in 4 years then all the democrats combined..
And oh by the way trump gave us the best economy ever
Vote all democrats out of office they are destroying America Trump 2020 and beyond...
Wish YOU were still running. So impressed with your words and knowledge plus your empathy!! Indiana Pete, Biden needs your help! Trump and Pence are full of lies and constant distractions!!
I can’t wait until Trump encounters an asymptomatic person! He’s on borrowed time &amp; eventually he’ll get the #COVID19. It’d be extra fantastic if Pence received that COVID19 gift too.
Check your facts. Too many conditions in ACA.  No loop holes for insurance companies in Trump's
Not true. Obamacare has loop holes for the pre existing conditions.  Trump 's would not. It would cover all.
Disgraceful. IMHE suggests we could save 70,000 lives from now to December, if we implemented a national mask wearing mandate. But, yeah, let’s keep politicizing it. 😑 #Trump #COVID19Pandemic
Lane Ruhland: WHO is paying for your legal services? Is it D Trump?  Is it Kayne West?  Who exactly ARE you working for? Are you working for two separate presidential candidates?  Whose idea was this two-pronged legal services plan? Did you, all by yourself, decide to double dip?
AFRAID--FEAR--ANTI-AMERICAN
donald trump yesterday said that Joe Biden will hurt God if he's elected president! Hurt God? Whaaat? Is this guy sane at all? Wow! This guy is a real "shiticus"
Trump is a racist. #DumpTrump2020 #TrumpIsARacist
Yes. “If I had lost the election in 2016, we would be in a war with N. Korea right now.” - Trump 😳
Time to elect someone who cares more about South Carolina and less about defending trump all the time, elect someone who won’t be a golf buddy.
President Trump is currently on FOX NEWS &amp; OANN, with a news conference. It is not on CNN, WTF? They don’t want Americans to hear good news?
President Trump announced Friday evening he would hold a news conference. --
We are in a place right now in our country where I wonder if we can ever come back from the devastation that Trump and his administration has done to the rule of law and the American people.
The truth lies in the words: ‘he went to Wharton’.  I went to Harvard, Yale, USC, Notre Dame, Northwestern, Vanderbilt, Marquette, St Louis U., Kentucky, IU, U of Chicago, and Purdue.  Whew!  Great campuses.  I concede that tRump does know thighs of many lands. Bilious airs? TRUE
Gonna have to agree to differ on that. The Dems want to help people out - which will help Trump in the election! - and a handful of GOP senators are just dicks. Even McConnell basically says that.
Iran and China don’t want any more of Trump either. Russia does. Russia is usually seen as the ringleader of that group. It all makes my head hurt.
You are a weak and wishy-washy Trump supporter. I do not want our fabulous President to give you any credibility.
The republicans are failing to pass another coronavurus relief bill so they can have trump sign an executive order for the next bill. Boosting his numbers. This is fucking insane.
Who thinks it's ok for Putin to actively denigrate Biden and promote   How can anyone not push back on a hostile foreign country meddling in our elections?  I know Trump wants to win at any cost - but democracy?
If Biden said he would unban tik tok if Trump does he would have a lot of boomers voting for him.
I am PROUD to Support President Trump and other Republicans. Had been a lifelong Democrat. If you love America; My advice is #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever Otherwise; The Democrat party will be the destruction of America.
Well that Dinesh totally explains why Trump repeated it but pronounced it in the "crude lingo" immediately after. 😂😂🤣🤣 He was covering all bases. Truly a man of the peeple.
#TrumpHoaxedAmericatRump hates America. tRump only lives himself and Ivampa
Despicable.  Kanye has ruined whatever decent reputation he might have had.  Kim, fo something or your name and your children’s name is mud.  tRump is using him. tRump’s minions are enablers to take advantage of the mentally ill. Who are the really sick ones, eh donald?  Shame!
I can’t wait until November 4th, after a huge Trump win, so he can send in the National Guard to put a beat down on these antifa thugs, rioters, and looters👇😂👇😂👇😂👇

Keep up the great work Nancy! You make Donald Trump's campaigning cost free! America sees through your twisted strategy. It's just not black folks you're using as pawns now though. See how that works out.
How is Trump still calling it the “China virus” like has he not gotten enough backlash from that? It’s gross.
Is Trump actually Kayne Westes’es illegitimate Father
Voting for trump.
For one they are private companies. #idiot they have rules that #everyone must follow #toadie. trump has been pampered by these companies for far too long #asshat if anyone should be in court it should be the users #pondscum we were all subject to a higher standard. #daydrinker.
They do notice that about Biden. That's why they then turn around and focus on picking Trump apart. To get the attention away from Dementia Joe.
No I have voted for Republicans in the past. But if they are in any way in line with trump, that’s a deal breaker.

Sheep can not tell the difference between peaceful protesters and Alt-Right rioters and trump knows this.
She looks insane. Ever wonder why the left is so unhinged? They never anticipated a Donald Trump chapter. He doesn’t fear them and is exposing all their lies.  They hate America and it is becoming clearer everyday. Save America from destruction. Vote for
God bless and protect our great President Trump your annointed.
If trump has to read everything from a teleprompter or paper because he doesn’t have the brain span to remember, he will spend all his time thumbing through his papers and won’t even have time to reply. 📉 game over.

“We have the best test in the world.”  people call us and say, how do you do that? Your testing is amazing in the United States🙄. This testing was brought to you by… The Trump administration
Right you are. A shame it will be politicized into a 2nd. Amendment issue. The theft, fraud and deceit will become a nonissue. Trump will lie about this multiple times a day.
Name one thing in life that donald trump did achieve at, I’ll wait.
The lame stream fake news socialist media are doing fake polls showing President Trump losing so that when he wins re-election on November 3rd. they can say he cheated and will use their fake and meaningless polls showing Biden winning as “proof” of it.   Keep America Great 🇺🇸🇺🇸!
Did trump just kill fortnite league of legends and Starcraft 2 in a single motion?

And not like trump tried with those graphs. Cause i think thats what you are doing...lol
So everybody in the world is trying to trick Americans? I know trump lies. But he took control of the data because he believed the same conspiracy. Guess what still over 1k deaths a day! Either you believe thats a problem or you think its the world vs you. Playing victim?

I have and will continue to do so. I would also recommend that every resistor that follows trump to unfollow immediately. I have never followed him and I never miss a tweet.
I feel like new outlets should task ONE White House correspondent to just ask Trump “can you define ____” every time he says something propogandish.
We know that. It is you that can’t come to terms with it. Most of your views seem pretty eithe or and that just doesn’t work for me. I was a big fan of your father and was shaken to the core at the way trump treated him.
The SDNY trying to dismantle the NRA is flat out stupid. And yes, will rile the people up. Not just Trump's base.  The #ClintonFoundation is an international criminal enterprise Why can't Feds prosecute under RICO?? There isn't "Law &amp; Order" if the Clinton's are not prosecuted

What kind of idiot believes these ridiculous Trump lies.
Why do you think Clinton, Kissinger, Gates, Fauci, Brennan, Trump, GW Bush, McConnell, Obama, Murdock, Adelsen &amp; Netanyahu and all corporate donors are "Communists"?
Also the revolution started before trump was in office. Or did blm not matter then? 7/13/13....who was president? Was it trump? Wait, i think biden was in office as some authority figure or something. Again you are showing how ignorant you are. Why would i listen yo you? LMFAO.
Yall begging us to vote for another warmonger who wants to increase police budgets. Sorry bout yuh! I really dont give a fuck. Black people matter. And clearly biden doesnt see it that way. So yes trump sucks,...wait no revolution? Are you ignorant to what we have changed already
What can a person say, sigh... sounds like Trump is desperate.
Trump's latest stance is that Joe Biden is against "God, Guns and Energy". . . What is 2020
Lock up the trump #notmypresident
Well 50 percent of the white vote has been voting Republican for decades. If anything most of the time it’s been more than 50. So if Trump is down to 50 that means Biden has a decent chance
God says Trump is not his chosen one....
And this my friends is just one more reason why President Trump will win big time this coming November!!🇺🇸🇺🇸
Hardly. I would trust Sally Yates before I would trust Trump or Flynn . .both of them are traitors.
He's fleecing the American people. #Grifter #Trump

You do realize that Governor DeWine has tested positive for the trump virus? Ohio governor tests positive for coronavirus ahead of Trump visit
YOU VOTED TO ALLOW THE TRILLIONS TO THE RICH 'FRIENDS' WHO ALSO DONATE TO YOU. JFC Stop pretending you honestly care about #WorkingPeople. You voted for Trump's increased military budget, extending the mass surveillance "Patriot" Act and supported Trump's &amp; Obama's tax cuts too
Ohio Gov. DeWine tested positive for COVID-19 shortly before he was to greet President Trump on a tarmac in Cleveland. Via
I think that was money funneled from Russia thru NRA for Trump
So they aren’t just a platform for free speech, they are now censoring free speech🤔🤔🤔  Time for congress through legislation, or President Trump through executive order, to rescind their special exemptions because they no longer are just a platform👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇!
President Trump needs to sign an executive order allowing schools that want to open up for in-person learning to do so.   What has happened to our country?  Daycares are open for in-person business BUT SCHOOLS CAN’T???  Demokkkratic mayors and governors are scum🤮👇🤮👇🤮👇🤮👇🤮
Trump could say the sky is chocolate and Republicans would twist themselves in knots to agree.
So basically, the socialist liberal demokkkrats are guilty of collusion 🤔🤔🤔!!!  They are ALWAYS guilty of what they accuse President Trump, or any conservative for that matter, of.  And social media, for political purposes, censors President Trump?  UNBELIEVABLE 🤮🤮
At the last minute, President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, are searching for places to impressively yet safely accept their parties' presidential nominations.
He’s waiting for trump to roll over and wake him up.
Political Tribune/Stephen Foster: “Trump has golfed several times on the taxpayer dime since declaring the country re-opened as we continue to face multiple crises. But you won’t hear McEnany complain one bit about any of that real dereliction of duty.... whine more about Obama.”
Anyone else notice that jr is hung up on trying to project his daddy’s ailment on to Biden? It’s really all he’s got and even that is BS. trump is a failed businessman he has a low IQ he’s a narcissistic racist with daddy issues. His economy was handed to him by Obama.
fuck trump
trump won’t miss your vote either you fucking racist
Can you tell Trump &amp; the rest of the GOP it’s a health crisis. That’s who’s ignoring the facts &amp; Trump won’t even mandate masks nor send for more testing sites.
And they are all altered images. Hello. Wake up. Photoshopping and lies and children’s lives in your hands Trump. You’ve destroyed mine.
This is true and the #media have not handled it well so far. #Trump #Election2020
It still is pulling votes from Biden and that’s scary. I feel the only reason Hilary didn’t win is because of the same thing. Those votes add up and could allow trump to win.
its funny cause nobodys voting for trump cause they "hate biden more", theyre all weird cult-like diehard supporters  where i feel like everyone voting for biden is just like "we know he sucks but at least we can bully him enough to do what we want" lmao
Trump, because with him we have to deal with the stupidity as well.
donald trump and his wooden headed myrmidons will stop at nothing to have him re-elected in November. One of their devious stratagems is to get Kanye on the ballot in battle ground states to chip away black and young votes from Biden. Don't fall for it. Don't vote for Kanyetrump!

Not a complete one for how many mutations we have allowed to develop. But you know, like trump said, "yes, people are dying. It is what it is" right?
As for doctored images.  I’m sick of them both positive and negative. The Trump ballooned up fat pics and the ones where his head is superimposed on Superman are equally gross.
I've had it with the MAGAts. I'm about to go batman on all of their asses  Trump support equals trash in my book in any capacity
If you’re scoring at home… The CDC is more accurate than Trump
You get a smaller tax return. LOL i never paid a penalty. If you did thats because you wanted too. Your 401k raised becauae he printed money and threw it at the corporations that influence the stock markets. Trump will kill you, now your 401k is worth 0. He allowed you,You a pet?
If Biden can do it at home so can Trump.
Trump is saying that Covid confinement can lead to marital problems. You’d have to be a real moron to listen to this guy speak about failed marriages.

I truly believe he is doing so to help trump win again. I think Kanye is trying to pull votes from Biden and is probably being paid to do so by trump!

Oh my goodness you can say it a million times, but no one with a brain believes anything that comes out of Trump's mouth.
Where are Trump’s tax returns? Where’s the medical plan? Where’s Jared’s Middle East peace plan? Hell, where are his golf scores since that’s mostly what he does. Start there. See if he can follow through and tell the truth about something.

i guess i missed the part where she said she supported trump... i think she's just basically pointing out the fact that he has passed a lot of good bills and has done a lot of good, (not saying he hasn't done bad), and that the media doesn't cover like any of it.

Trump calls it like he sees it. Is he the ideal candidate? Sometimes yes and sometimes no. But he is exactly what we need to shake up the system. Democrats haven’t done shit for blacks. Try embracing his policies for a change.
isn’t holding back tonight! He is showing Trump for the fool that he is.
How is Trump racist at all? You people do not understand the term racist or racism. You are not very bright.
Trump is in meltdown mode because he knows he’s FAILING this country. He knows he’s a CONMAN and that he’s fooling his base. What a joke.
Except he’s not making that face at Biden.  He’s making it at your Dear Leader, Trump.  You should look up self own.  #TrumpHasNoClue #TrumpIsNotWell

You make a lot of unsubstantiated accusations - klansman, sexual abuser, racist etc.  Look at the trump Biden record.  Don’t be duped, just because the Dems let you think you live in the house doesn’t mean they see you any different than being in the field.
I will never forgive liberals who overlook the horrid war crimes this man is responsible for because he is “better than Trump”
Honestly do you believe that 𝐁𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧 would debate Trump.

yeah but you emphasized how horrible trump supporters have it. joking about abuse is horrible, and I definitely don’t condone it, but it’s awfully weird to be so upset by this comment but still support someone who has abused women and children, and he talks about it.
Geeze, you sound just like your buddy Trump. Projecting, projecting, projecting
it doesn’t just happen to trump supporters😂 the amount of hate speech and actual physical abuse us “libtards” and “snowflakes” get is unreal😂 and here’s an even more unnerving incident from a die hard supporter of our nation’s president.

Vote by mail in whichever state it is applicable. Just be sure that you vote early enough to allow your mailed vote to arrive in time. tRump’s PostOffice appointee is working for tRump &amp; against fairness in voting. He is hamstringing mail carriers. Vote! Vote early to be counted
didn’t back off one inch. He pressed trump the whole way. It was like watching Nolan’s Richardson’s Arkansas defense.
Biden is a congenital liar too. IF you establishment idiots were HONESTLY interested in what actual #WorkingPeople need you would not be repeating "Trump bad" as your plan to get #JoeBuyDone elected

Trump: “They are dying, that’s true. And it is what it is.”  👀👀👀  Why does 40+% of US citizens want to vote for a President who is so casual about them dying?  (Link has part of the transcript for Trump &amp; Jonathan Swan’s Axios interview.)
We see it, he was disrespectful by protesting Trump’s inauguration.  Trump simply returned the favor.  To hold him to a different standard than Trump is racist.
It is going to take decades to clear Trump out of the government. This is why elections at all levels matter. This November will not be enough
Yes! His relaxed manner &amp; simple questions were the perfect foil for Trump’s idiotic ranting. Bravo.
If you elect joe Biden in November, you will be electing senility and dementia for leadership. If you elect Donald Trump, you will elect leadership and a fighter for America! Vote like your life depends on the outcome, BECAUSE IT DOES.
Fred Trump. You can’t get much worse than that.
Mike, you’ve been hanging with the Trump family far too much.  Remember, they never tell the truth.  You’re becoming like them.

I hope that one of Biden’s first days include requiring the immediate resignations of all agency heads installed by tRump, i.e. Tata, the Postal Service head.  They are all ridiculous tRump suck-ups and bring disgrace to America
At trump’s camp they don’t think that being corrupt is that big of a deal.
What an ignorant response. #Trump
Monday's executive order will also set in motion an experiment under which hospitals in rural communities could receive a more predictable stream of Medicare payments in exchange for delivering better performance on certain measures of quality.
We are still having record weeks. What is impacting our business is  's #WarOnImmigrants. We cannot get the help we need because Trump won't let them in the country and Americans apparently don't want to make pizzas.
I hate when you go to social media for entertainment only to see the most negative posts. How can I enjoy anything when the world is falling apart and Trump is president?

Some people are just crazy. It is just like I told this trump supporter when he talked about BLM I told him about mentally ill trumpanzees who looked up my information including kids etc, and I told him mama bears are scarier than papa bears,  believe that.

Give this a little thought. Did you ever stop to think that Trump is the only leader in the world that is actually innocent and fighting these people. They sat on this for years and our POTUS pursued it.
Try some critical thinking. Pedos running rampant prior to Trump presidency with the FBI sitting for years on knowledge. Trump wins presidency and the arrests commence, plus Trump signs EO that will destroy the guilty ones.
I know this may come as a shock to you but the EO confiscating all of the money came straight from Trump and no one but Trump. Perhaps you will applaud him when this is all done.
Remember....all other presidents kept this under wraps. Trump is the one bringing this to light.
This is Trump moving forward with rounding up the pedos. Just give it a little thought. Trump signed on EO confiscating money of guilty individuals. He is the white hate and has come to achieve the goal of taking down these demons.

If Biden can’t even debate Trump then he’s not prepared to be president.
NOT TRUMP! More like the governor and mayor of Seattle. Most incompetent people need to blame others.
Disgraceful. #Trump
She is a calculating little gutter snipe. She actually believes she can be president some day. That is what this little performance was all about. What a joke. You think the GOP would be stupid enough to do Trump 2.0?
I feel like McConnell and Trump would call a lame-duck session just for this, so probably after the election.
Looks like it’s time to boycott the Hampton Inns chain to get their attention on this complicity with the Trump fascist regime.
Aren’t all of the Trump sycophants using the same self tanning orange coloring as their Dear Leader?
When Trump is out of office, I look for him to flee the country or croak from a heart attack.
Oh, doesn't matter where you are, we're all putting up with her dumb ass. You can pretend to like her, but we know deep down inside, you think she's as dumb as the rest of us do. It's okay, you don't have to admit it. Oh, and IN is dumber... 85% Trump. Sad!
You just jealous because you could have made those death stats so much higher. Does Trump even know how to pandemic? He can't even reach 0.1% of the country dead. Trump's killiin' game is weak! Let them Clinton's show you how to make people dead!
Yes please do this only if you are voting for trump
Damn right. Trump has to go. Nothing else matters until that happens.
I’d love to see trump self destruct on live tv, but I don’t think his campaign will let him do it. If they’re smart anyway, they haven’t proven to be so far.
if The President listened to himself, He wouldn’t like Trump either
Now is the time to make sure you’re registered to vote! Just in July, #Trump's campaign with the #RNC has: - Reserved $90 million in ads - Hired 1,500 field organizers Republicans are gearing up for a fight!! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #DumpTrump #MotivationalMonday

We will be okay, if we elect Donald Trump and take back the House and maintain the Senate. We need to flip some Democrat mayors and governors to RED.
I soooooooo look forward to a Trump/Biden debate!
An official with the Republican National Committee is saying no final decision has been made.
This is an accurate representation of my brother every time Trump is even mentioned on TV. Whoever is speaking even get’s the “T” out of their mouth, he is flying off the handle.  I’m proud of the boy.
This is a bot account. Look the trump supporters always looking for somebody else that supports their beliefs. There are just such a small number of them they need robots.
She is terrifying...I couldn’t watch but 11 seconds of it. I got scared I was going to be brainwashed and turn into a trump supporter😂🤷🏼‍♀️
I was scared to keep watching....is this one of those cult videos. Where if you watch long enough you become brainwashed and become a trump supporter🥴
I hate when I am told of I don't like the president I should leave. Like all of a sudden they are okay with immigration.
Trump doesn’t answer many questions. Or he just lies. Biden will answer questions, Greta.

Hilarious!   Greg Gutfeld: Biden regurgitating Trump's stance on masks, 'it's not news'
Joe Biden is American through and through. That guy in WH not so much!
Yeah real. brave😂 when you are in a public setting And wealthy, you are going to have these people come forward. However, Biden happened while he has been “serving” the people and being paid with taxpayers money.
It really is another election of pick the least shitty candidate, but this time it’s which is less racist and less of a pedophile. Trump is garbage and Biden the trash can he goes in. #HelpAmerica2020 😴
Mr. President, please leave the  alone. Sure I’d prefer to vote for Biden by mail. I’d also crawl to the end of the earth to vote for Biden if that’s where you put the only ballot box.
Biden is the sad clown, at the circus, we paid to watch.  I want my money back for the show. Biden is a really bad clown.  A sell out, with out a plan, for tomorrow.  Let alone, a damn clue, how to make the people in the big top applaud.  Retire!
Funny. voting Biden is signing a death warrant
Ah, yes, the old "We can't get anything to stick to Joe Biden, so let's go after the black female instead."  How pathetic and desperate can you get?
"He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground." Kamala Harris–
Good place for her but how crazy is this:
I'm still going to vote for Biden/Harris, but only because they're the best chance at beating Trump. It can't be denied that they're both bland candidates, without any real interest in changing the system, but at least they aren't making it much worse.
What a deceitful manipulation of facts.  Typical Biden and libs in general.......
Don't mistake "vote blue no matter who" as support for Biden/Harris. "Vbnmw" is strictly a vote against Trump.
Biden doesn't need cartoons.
So proud and will vote proudly for you and Joe Biden.
For sure. Biden and Harris!
Biden could have picked Jesus and ya'll would still complain.
Getting Biden / Harris after thinking we are getting Bernie is like being told you’re going to Disneyland but instead you’re taken to an abandoned warehouse where you’re forced to kill your childhood pet with a hunting knife but somehow it’s still better than the other option.
I'm just favoring his tweet so that I can bump it in November after Biden/Harris wins.
Crazy Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate. Mr. President, I have one question for you. Is he trying to throw the election??? He just made your re-election bid a hell of alot easier. This is funny. #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
Like, if you're just not excited about Biden, that's fine, I get that. But it's completely false to say that he doesn't give progressives any reason to get excited when his platform is overwhelmingly progressive.
Didn’t she say she believed the victims who accused Biden of sexual assault?
How do you see the Biden trump going?
Biden picks Kamala and trump supporters are shitting their pence! #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris #
The most racist man I know of is going to call someone else racist..not to mention Biden was literally the VP to the first black president???
No contest.  Biden\Harris signed sealed and delivered.
Right know Kamala Is thinking, .... Damn how did I get myself into this?  It started between wild willies legs, and ends up in Biden’s lap.
Something fishy is up,  between Biden and Kamala,  I think it’s between her thighs and Joe’s nose.
Something fishy is up,  between Biden and Kamala,  I think it’s between her thighs and Joe’s nose.
Do you still believe Joe Biden accusers, about sexual harassment?  If not, what changed your mind?
At least he can talk. I’d be more worried about Biden...
YESSSSS!!!! KAMALA IS BIDEN’S VP!!!!  Literally have chills... this is what hope is my friends.   We got this.  #TeamBiden
Goose bumps and excitement!!!!!!  Biden/Harris!!!!!
Whomever Biden picks, it needs to be a Bachelor type tv special. Imagine the ratings. You know Trump has.

I was really looking forward to a WWE style promo of Biden calling out God.Lots of questions for the President today.   Biden is continuing to limit his media hits, furthering his "sit back and shut up" campaign strategy.
This is all, of course, assuming that Biden wins the election in November.
How do we elect Biden and get rid of 45 asap. What will you do
Anyone flying a Biden 2020 sign on your boats?
Thank you glad your voting for Biden this November and God bless
No one will be safe in Biden’s America
That's not good.  That's because 45 doesn't care about the planet.  Biden wants to change the planet 1st day in office and I believe him.  We got to change this planet
Trump team is knocking on a million doors a day. Biden? Zero. We’ll see if the ground game still matters.
I see nowhere in this thread where Joe Biden was called a hero. I said Mr. Date is an American hero. I don't particularly like Joe or Kamala. I will however be voting for them, because Trump is an insane narcissist.
No problem all of us need to work at a team to elect Biden and get rid of 45
by what facts your seeing currently.  Do you think Biden will win and will it be the same day or days or weeks
Because people are energized Biden will win right
The teachers union backed Biden. Does anyone see an issue with the people teaching our kids having a "preferred" candidate? I would say teachers supporting and manipulating our children is worse and more scary.

Yeah. Being in Indiana, voting Green is my only option for pushing Dems left. If I could find something positive to say about Biden, I'd already be shouting it at the top of my lungs
by what your seeing lately. can Biden win and will it be the same night or take days
I have questions. Will Biden ever take questions that don’t have ore-written answers popping up on his teleprompter? Next...WHAT ARE THEY SIGNING???
A friend shared their opinion on Biden/Harris and a lot of their white cis friends jumped on them for it. I've watched them repeat the same thing over and over while having to detail how that ticket also harms people like them and their family. I hate that people can't even
do you think Biden will win in a landslide and how long will it take to know the results
Will Biden win in a landslide victory
What states do you think will put Biden over the edge and win the election?
I've just made my decision. I support the Biden-Harris ticket for November 3rd.
But, your other option is... Trump... Joe and Kamala have my support. We'll see what you're saying when the Biden administration legalizes pot.
I also get those who will say “the guy in there now has cognitive issues,” but at least it’s out there! We know what we get with him if he wins. If Biden wins, do we get a seasoned political veteran or a ceremonial figure head while Harris and his advisors run the show?
But I do not understand how anyone (even those who hold the positions above) could watch Biden sit in hiding in his basement, avoiding the public eye, and not be curious as whether his cognitive abilities are legitimate concerns.
Biden winning Fox News poll but look at people’s answers when asked about their neighbors 👀
Me too.  I pray Biden wins and I  pray that kanye and 45 both get help when there out this November

An illuminating if unsurprising finding from the new Pew Research national poll:  whites without a college degree Trump 64%, Biden 34%  everyone else Biden 68%, Trump 30%
It's gross when people jump on someone who is explaining why they're sad they have to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket because it's the less harmful option. "Less harmful" means there are still valid concerns and it should signify that your privilege might not be welcome here.
I'm not sure I'd be holding my breath that Joe Biden will give you a much deserved pardon, however they will certainly be more susceptible to public pressure than the current administration. Good luck Edward.
Klain — who served as Biden's Chief of Staff from 2009 to 2011 — would remain a top candidate for White House Chief of Staff in a Biden administration.
#NEW: Biden has hit $50 million in fundraising since announcing the selection of Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) as his Vice Presidential pick.  #CONTEXT: Kamala Harris raised $40 million in her entire Presidential campaign. Biden raised just over $60 million in all of 2019.

if y’all “vote” biden into office don’t forget to remind anyone who visits the white house to leave their young girls at home ✨
You really don't get it, do you? Not voting for Biden IS voting for Trump. Grow up already.
Also yesterday: Biden announced his support of a plan that would have every governor enact a mask mandate. He said it could save 40,000 American lives.   20/x
In other presidential election news, the 2020 Democratic  nominees Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will sign the required documents to officially become the party nominees today.   That's ahead of next week's  9/x
To put that number in perspective,  reported yesterday that Senator Harris's short-lived Presidential campaign raised $40 million during the entire campaign.  Biden raised a little over $60 million in 2019.   8/x
The Biden campaign announced last night that they raised $48 million dollars in the 48 hours after announcing Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) as Biden's VP selection.   That's per  7/x
haha trump should get another 4 years because biden isnt my exact perfect candidate
Great thank you for calming me down.  I want 45 out so bad and Biden in so bad
I'm nervous about Biden debating.  Do you think he will do good
“Joe Biden has released a  video in which he credits his Catholic faith, Pope Francis, and the example of nuns for his personal inspiration.   ... despite his promise to renew legal action against the Little Sisters of the Poor should he win election.”
I'm glad Trump is upset; that nasty a-hole sure doesn't care who he gets upset. Sen Harris is going to mop the floor with Pence in the debate and Biden is going to do the same thing with Trump.
How are things looking in your state for Biden now that he has Harris as vp
I think Joe Biden should show off Sen Harris. His ratings got a boost when he chose her for his running mate. She was my pick for president. I think she may well be our first woman president.
Well 45 doesn't want us to have mail and USPS anymore.  A reporter asked him about lies. He thinks Harris wasn't born in the usa. Says Biden has horrible ideas for the virus and hes doing great.
Creepy Joe Biden and Kamala Hairyass combined still don't even come close to President Donald Trump when it comes to Twitter followers
Pence(Wednesday): “We’ve created more jobs in the last 3 months than Joe Biden and Barack Obama created in their 8 years in office”  Trump(Thursday): Witholds money from USPS so it affects their jobs.   Ok.
$48 MILLION for the Biden campaign in the two days after Biden announced Harris as the nominee, per  That's an enormous fundraising haul.
To every new Yorker Democrat Republican voting for Biden Independents etc.... 45 said today that hes going to win new York.  By what your seeing will he or he is full of it
Joe Biden struck political gold when he chose Sen Harris to be his running mate.
Great from a fellow Hoosier too voting for Biden
ALL THAT SAID: redistricting did make this a little more Democratic, but it's still very Republican.   If Cooper can't win this district in November, no Democrat (Biden, Cunningham, or Davis) will win it.
To everyone that's voting for Biden Republicans voting for Biden Democrats Independents etc.... are you ok with a mask mandates for 3 months to get this virus under control. I certainly am ok with it
I wholeheartedly agree. Biden and Harris aren’t definitely my first choice but Trump and Pence are monsters. I hope we can have mail in voting but Trump’s comments today worry me
2/2 "a nice and decent man". A lot of people here sat 2016 out because they felt they couldn't vote for either candidate. Almost without exception those people were planning to vote Biden to restore the status quo.
Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris will be his running mate Tuesday.
Hey DumDum Donnie. You saying Kamala Harris was meaner to Biden as you call him slow Joe is the epitome of no self awareness. This country will be so much better off without you it will seem like a paradise. #AllRoadsLeadToPutin #ResignNow
1/3 I'm from Indiana which went for Obama in 2008 and Trump in 2012. I assure you Joe Biden would have taken Indiana with a VP pick who was considered 'a nice person'. Instead he picked someone who is despised by the centrists who sat it out in 2016 because they hated (unfairly)
Far left Joe Biden has just called for a mandate requiring Americans to wear a mask in public for AT LEAST the next 3 months. No thanks Joe! Americans have had enough of you and your party’s tyrannical shaninagins. That’s why you are going to lose, and bigly.
"Kamala Harris: Where does Biden's running mate stand on Middle East issues? Joe Biden's pick for vice president has been a staunch supporter of Israel and an outspoken critic of Saudi Arabia”
I'll be voting Biden in November. The real question is whether Joe just signed us up for 4 more years of Trump by picking Kamala. 13% of Americans were undecided, where do you think most of them live? Swing states, and a bunch of them just landed on the wrong side of the fence.
You admit to being mean and condescending to Joe Biden, but think that's okay because you weren't the meanest or most condescending.  Brilliant plan, Skippy.  "Yeah, I'm a child rapist, but Epstein was more child-rapey than me, so I'm the good guy."  BRILLIANT!!!
Biden isnt my first choice either, and hes no saint, but I dont live in a country where thats an option rn.  and sacrificing a practical choice that can move us in the right direction isnt worth fake morality points that can and will cost lives
voting for #Trump is dumb. voting for  Biden is dumb. any vote in the system is a vote for the system. #dontvote
Biden Voter: "Defund The Police!"  Trump Voter: "Defund The Post Office!"  The Rest of the World: "Defund The United States!"
normally i would agree with this and like i said i don't fuck with purity politics but the people who have been marginalized and oppressed have been discussing the danger and past damages of Biden and Harris
I don't expect any growth beyond pandering from Biden/Harris cause they've never been held accountable for any past wrongs, they just move along because americans have political amnesia
I think in terms of effecting policy Biden and Harris can be as dangerous as Trump. They already have been more dangerous. One of Trump's most dangerous features is how he radicalizes and mobilizes his base and he will not lose that if he loses the presidency
appoint but Biden and Harris are a dangerously potent combo considering the escalating nature of the police state over the course of our lives. I'm not gonna shame anyone who wants to vote Biden/Harris and I'm not one for purity politics or trying to keep my hands clean
no matter who the president is. What we're choosing when we vote for Biden or Trump is what that violence looks like. I choose not to endorse that violence to any degree but instead organize against it. If dems had a backbone we could count on them to block whoever Trump might
I see what you're saying but given their histories in regards to the PIC I don't see Biden or Harris doing anything to reduce state violence and I have zero faith in their supreme court appointee. As the american empire continues to falter the state will become more fascist
Today on Brand New (Linked): After previously announcing the adoption of  Decimal and Mercury as the campaign’s typefaces along with the announcement of Joe Biden’s VP, Kamala Harris, the new Biden Harris logo has been updated to Decimal
Biden might not be the guy whos going to do all of the things we want, but he can open up talks, clear a way, start UNDOING roadblocks that TRUMP is trying to set up.  Meanwhile another Trump term means another 4 years of work just to undo what hes done and get back to square 1.
This is going to matter.
list of reasons I am voting for biden/harris
In Biden's speech about Harris, he talked about representation. Kamala Harris is the first female African-American or Asian-American VP nominee.  5/x
Here's a story on the pick from  at     4/x
Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vice Presidential nominee Kamala Harris introduced their ticket together in Delaware.   “I have no doubt I picked the right person to join me as the next Vice President of the United States of America, that’s Kamala Harris," Biden said.  3/x
This is a straight up lie. Trump was talking about the statue removal debate and Biden knows it. Go watch the video for yourself. This is the only way these people know how to get votes, it sure won’t be based on policy.
Fuck Joe Biden.
Are we referring to moderate candidates like Biden (mix of left and right views) or actual centrists (equating the left and right as equally wrong)?
I just want Biden to win so bad. his speeches I can stand he cares. I just want to throw a shoe at 45 right now
If you’re going to abstain from voting or write in a third party candidate because you don’t like the Biden/Harris ticket just put MAGA in your twitter bio.
Biden: "if you have a problem figuring out whether you are voting for me or Trump, then you ain't black"
Keep drinking the juice .....  Biden didn't want his kids growing up in a racial Jungle at school  Biden said you can't walk into a 7-11 if you don't have a little Indian accent  Biden so wrote the the 1993 Crime Bill which led to punitive sentences for non violent offenders
Watching Joe Biden Introduces Senator Kamala Harris as Running Mate     #bidenharris #biden #harris #realchange #empathy #compassion #leadership #hope #possibility #victory
I was impressed, in the debates, that Harris couldn't find anything worse about Biden.
I just disagree with the narrative, “Well a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for Trump.” Those in power try to guilt trip us with that b.s. They’re going to shame me for voting on the candidate I see most fit, because the establishment &amp; DNC doesn’t approve? Nah. I’m good.
Amen god bless.  Omg I wish Biden would win your state this November and your governor ousted too
That’ll be my reaction as Biden wins in a landslide. Trump is going to lose in a landslide.
Scaredy Trump Flees to Fox News After Biden Chooses Kamala Harris  via
#Mamala had me in tears. When  spoke from her heart about Beau Biden and his love for his dad  I ugly cried. And when Harris shared with us that she has had many titles, but none more important than #Mamala, I lost it again. ❤️❤️
You inspire me alot by you changing your mind.  It gives me hope Biden can win.  We need to work as a team Republicans and Democrats to elect Biden and get rid of 45 this November
I'm voting by mail 😃. What state are you voting in and what made you decide to vote for Biden and change sides
THAT’S WHAT BIDEN-HARRIS FASCIM 2020 WANT YOU TO THINK!!  JK, I totally agree with you. They aren’t even close in badness but it is a two party system 🤷‍♂️ (I know a lot of people who are commenting spend their time making an electable third party so no offense to those people)
thank you for voting for Biden this November
Don’t think that if Biden and Harris are voted in, America will be saved. We MUST continue to hold them accountable for their actions and push them to step up to the promises they made.
bro I know Kamala Harris has her issues... but there’s no way in im voting for t*ump over Biden/Harris
Joe Biden did nothing to help while Vice President.
The Democratic Party does not care and will attempt to push Kamala Harris, a cop, onto us for the 2024 presidency including this election. You are voting for her, not Joe Biden. #VoteGreenParty
Joe Biden speaks in complete sentences.
We have China on and Iran wanting Biden. Russia wants 45
I feel very confident Biden will beat 45. We just need your state or Wisconsin to turn blue.  I feel more positive in your state because it's so close to California and west coast is blue
I've noticed some resisters block me for no reason. But I gain more because in the end we need to be a team and beat 45 this November and elect Biden
A lil reminder: Biden and Harris may be awful candidates for the election, but a vote for anyone else is a vote for trump. Stay angry but don't be fucking stupid
To all Floridians please see that 45 wants to risk college athletes there lives to play due to the virus and your governor too. Its not right.  If you really want to save your children family friends anyone please vote for Biden
No where in the original tweet did anyone say don’t vote and mfs voting for the sake of voting and not holding our elected officials accountable is how we got here in the first place. Not wanting to vote for Biden =\= wanting Trump to be president.
Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris will be his running mate Tuesday.
Also, tariffs were announced 5 months before US Steel's announcement, no company decides to invest $750mm in that short of a time frame  And sweet heavens, what's wrong with Biden reviewing and doing his research before making a decision?
And also you can questions someone’s loyalty to progressive ideals if they’re ready to champion the Biden/Harris ticket as something to be proud of or something that’s the proverbial right thing to do. My overall point is there’s no room for virtue signaling in this.
I see a lot of people criticizing kamala Harris and joe Biden (rightfully so) but I would just like to remind everyone that our current president’s father was a member of the KKK and he is also breaking our constitution on a daily basis.
I'm from Indiana and a Democrat and voting for Biden
Congratulations to  and, perhaps more important, her constituents in Minnesota.   Another win for the ascendent progressive wing of the Democratic party &amp; an important counterpoint to yesterday's unsurprising announcement from the corporatists running the Biden campaign.
Soap Star Joe is about Biden. Most ppl don’t know that.
Great  newsletter this morning about Senator Harris being named as Biden's Vice President.
i'm pretty divorced from electoral politics now a days so i've been shocked to discover people actually think Joe Biden has a chance of beating Trump?? and naturally if this doesn't happen it will be the fault of the non voting left
1) Kamala Harris is biracial. Stop erasing part of her identity by just saying she's Black.  2) Read up on Lori Lightfoot if you want to know why some of your BIPOC friends have concerns about someone with her leanings on any ticket.  3) Voting for Biden is still the lesser evil
Biden said he wants police reform then announces one of the most strict District Attorneys as his VP. Make up your mind man 🤡
I am so very happy with Biden’s choice for a running mate. An inexplicable sense of peace and happiness came over me when he made the announcement. Good times are on the horizon! #BidenHarris2020
President Trump going after Biden's VP pick this morning:
Trump and Pence are going down and his sycophants and racist enablers will be remembered when they are up for election even in red leaning Indiana who help elect the President Obama &amp; VP Biden in 2008.
After the announcement, Democratic fundraising committee ActBlue — which allows for small-donors to make contributions — processed $10.8 million, the Biden campaign's largest day for grassroots donations.   Story from the times here:  8/x
There is also some reporting to suggest that Harris being on the ticket will bring in money from the tech industry in Silicon Valley. Harris — being from California — is close with many big tech leaders.   7/x
The GOP is already firing back at Harris's nomination, calling attention to her comments on Biden from early in the primary. New ads are trying to tie her to far-left policy and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.  Here's a tweet from the President.  6/x
Around 4:15 PM EST, the Biden campaign released that his pick was Harris in an email and text to supporters.   They also tweeted this at 4:17 PM on Biden's twitter account:   5/x
Biden's team — amazingly — had no major leaks about who the nominee was. Biden started calling the candidates who were not selected in the middle of day.   Reports were released that Congresswoman Karen Bass and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer had not been selected.   4/x
Former Vice President Joe Biden — who captured the 2020 Democratic nomination — has finally named a vice presidential pick: California Senator Kamala Harris.   Harris was a competitor of Biden's this election cycle, but dropped out before Iowa.   2/x
seriously the amount of people who a few weeks ago were all about defunding the police are now posting how excited they are about biden/harris? so what I’m hearing is you didn’t actually care
#Hail ! #BidenHarris The Democratic Coalition — Donate via ActBlue #EndThisTwilightZoneEpisode
thank you for your service and thank you for voting for Biden this November.  We need to be a team no matter Republicans and Democrats and elect Biden and get rid of 45. God bless from a Democrat
What's wrong with celebrities, is everything a conspiracy to them. Trump don't need to cheat to beat Biden. Just because you see a red hat Jamie, don't mean that person's out to get you.
No problem anytime.  I  can't find many Biden voters in our state.  I'm happy to find some though.  Its growing.  I wish our state would turn blue
I'm from Indiana too and voting for Biden and a Democrat
And Trump is the sharpest tool in the shed? Biden suffers from a stutter that he has mostly overcome. Trump had people take tests for him. Biden is compassionate and empathize with others, Trump could care less about anyone but Trump. Big difference.
Correction, you believe in Trump. Bernie supports and helped write the initiatives that Biden is running on. This has been a collaboration of those you say you support but in truth we know where you stand - with a racist dictator that wants to undo our democracy.
In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
Can't wait to see 45 out and Biden and Harris win
No problem anytime.  We need to work as a team to elect Biden and get rid of 45 asap
This could be game-changing for the Biden campaign. Harris could bring in a swath of big money from Silicon Valley⬇️.
Omg yes and for the better when 45 is out and Biden and Harris take over
I don't object to voting for Biden, just the "if we lose, we lose forever" reasoning. It doesn't lead anywhere good.
Good, strong move by Biden.   No go win this thing!
I fear you may be right. But Biden needs to appeal to Midwestern voters who voted for Obama, not the White supremacists allowed by police to stage a putsch in the Michigan State House.
Way too many people on my feed just assuming that Biden/Kamala will definitely win. Haven't we learned anything?
Biden might be thinking she can't be accused of being far left, but the Trumpers either believe whatever they're told, or simply don't care if he's lying. I think this matchup just got a lot closer today and I don't think I can take 4 more years of the orange one.
as a lib myself, i am less than thrilled about kamala. super tone deaf of biden in my opinion
I am ready for Biden / Harris to fix the mess that 45&amp;co. continue to make of our country. A prosecutor is just who we need. An African-Asian American female prosecutor, especially.
The party of "defend the police" picked a cop...Biden and Trump are both senile and useless...my kingdom for a relevant 3rd party!
I refuse to watch trump and Biden debate but this I can get behind...
We found her a couple years ago, she endorsed Biden.
Is it the official position of the Biden-Harris campaign that Joe Biden is a racist? It seems that one of two things is true: either Biden accepts Harris’s position that he’s a racist, or she called him a racist in an effort to score cheap political points. Which one is it?
Democratic Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton (VA-10) on Biden's pick for VP:
PICKED TO HELP JOE FINISH OFF AMERICA  via    Meme the Left talks about Creepy Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Hairyass
You seem like a smart young lady, I say that, of course, because I fully agree. I imagine you will be doing the same as me in November, voting for Biden Harris because they're left of fascist.
Trump \ Pence  Vrs. Biden \Harris No Biden's running mate has been picked, no surprise, it was Kamala Hairyass
I may have been "Biden" my time earlier, but now I'm kamALLa in.
I think considering other options she's best choice for Biden to win
If you don’t understand how important it is to defeat 45 (to prevent catastrophic warming, economic collapse, etc.), then I’m not sure you understand what’s going on rn. It makes your opinions on the world less trustworthy. If you do, you’re voting for Biden and Harris.
BREAKING: Donald Trump rips Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as VP  via   has an ignorance that only his base can love!!!
Watching news as it broke Biden chose Harris (superb choice). A knock on door: new neighbor with champagne bottle to introduce himself. Sat on front porch 2chat for 45 minutes. Came back in 2see Trump, instead of congratulating her, had already called Harris “nasty”. #BidenHarris
Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris will be his running mate Tuesday.
Biden's pick of Kamala Harris as 2020 running mate: IU experts available to comment. See full bios and contact info:
But “the greater good” is such a vague and therefore meaningless term imo. Who’s greater good? I just don’t think any type of morality can be used to justify voting for anyone. I’m voting democrat solely because I dislike Trump more than Biden/Harris not because I think they’ll..
I’m a vote, but I’m getting to the point where I’m starting to feel like voting for presidents is nearly meaningless. I focus on local and statewide elections tbh but that’s me. Unfortunately my ballot will probably say Biden/Harris
How about calling Biden a racist during the primary’s? Change her mind on that to?
A point I just considered. Obama turned over orchestration of the recovery act to Biden when the latter was VP. Harris is a prosecutor. Who better to oversee what we are going to need to do with Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Bill Barr and the rest of the current criminal cabal?
The correct choice. Kamala Harris can verbally handle any human being on the planet.
California has been a disaster for a while now and Kamala has already called Biden a racist so this ought to be interesting . I will be curious if the term "sexist" comes up often now.
I'd be far more excited if Biden and Harris were the versions of themselves that the far right seems to think they are.
Warren comments on Harris being named Biden's Vice Presidential nominee...
This is specifically about Biden. Harris is 🤷🏻‍♀️ to me but she does such a good job in the senate and we rly need people like her to stay and advocate there and grill the stupid ass people trump nominated lmfao like Barr
Yes called it! Biden-Harris 2020
Not at all!!!! Old school acquaintance on FB saying Biden didn’t actually name an African-American running mate because she’s “Jamaican Indian”. Etc
Oh so happy! Best choice! From an independent in Indiana. America needs Biden/Harris!
Literally sitting here with tears of joy running down my cheeks. My god how much did we need this?!! Fired up! 🔥 ready to go! Let’s do this! Proud to finally be able to say BIDEN HARRIS 2020!
Biden-Harris 2020. Time to get to work.
Insane power move by Biden by having the woman who used to sell T-Shirts about how racist he was publicly kiss the ring to be his Vice President
The YouTube comment presidency. Also literally no one on the Left considers Harris (or Biden) to be Radical.
Let's elect Biden and Harris, and then let's yell at them a lot.
As a former Speech teacher and debate coach, there is not a better debater than Kamala Harris. I can’t wait to see her make chopped liver out of Mike Pence. This is an extraordinarily stark choice. Biden/Harris against Trump/Pence.
Now that Biden has picked Kamala Harris is his running mate, what’s the over/under on POTUS caught on a hot mic dropping the N-word.
it almost feels like biden wants trump to win
This is the most excited I have been in 3+ years. Biden has hit it out of the ballpark with his announcement of Kamala Harris as his Vice President. I feel so incredibly hopeful.
I really liked her as a candidate. My main concern/hope is that Biden’s campaign management is better than Hillary’s so this reassures me a bit.
Joe Biden is a skeletal mouthpiece for radical, neo-Marxists.  Kamala Harris had 3% approval within her own party.   I can't imagine why the Democrats want to push mail-in voting.   #MAGA2020
Fuck Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
Kamala Harris will sink the #Biden campaign. Just watch.
I'm not the most pleased with Biden/Harris, but will I crawl over hot coals to vote for them in November? You bet your ass I will
Biden has picked his vice presidential running mate: Kamala Harris
There's the official announcement. Biden/Harris will be the 2020 Democratic ticket.
#BREAKING: Former VP Joe Biden has picked  as his running mate.
#BREAKING: Joe Biden has chosen California Senator Kamala Harris to become his running mate.
#BREAKING: Bass and Abrams are also out as Biden's running mate.
#BREAKING: Michigan Gov. Whitmer will not be Biden's running mate.
CNN is reporting that Congresswoman Karen Bass (CA-37), who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, was told by Biden himself that she is not Biden's pick for VP.
Also unacceptable that Biden supports the Jones act.  🇵🇷
Joe Biden will not be announcing his running mate today, per Biden campaign official.
How about a big blue Biden birthday cake
Likely before Biden announces his VP.
I can’t get specific, but I have been told that Biden’s VP pick is a woman.
There are sources saying that Biden has made his Vice Presidential selection and will announce as early as today.
Oh god, I missed the Biden stuff. There's just so much to take in tbh. What a horrible person
thank you for voting for Biden this November your a true inspiration to me seeing that we need change.  We all got to work together as a team Democrat and Republican to elect Biden.  God bless from a Democrat
And that's why Biden is waiting for his VP announcement.
I believe that's why Biden is waiting on his announcement.
Hoping its Bass.  Mostly because I want someone to make a shirt with the Democratic donkey and a caption that reads "Ridin' ass with Biden Bass"
There will be Republican primaries in 4 years to determine that. If chosing the best VP candidate is so important then why did Biden back himself into a corner on who could be considered?
When does Biden make his Vice Presidential announcement?   (Retweet to get more responses)
Some of Biden's 2020 primary competitors, such as Sanders, Klobuchar, Buttigieg, Harris, and Warren, also received speaking slots.
Very true but LBJ was smart, Biden's an idiot
Would I prefer Joe Biden pick a woman of color as VP? For sure. (I vote Harris.) But it’s his decision to make in terms of who he thinks is best suited, and with whom he thinks he can best work. Period. “Vote blue no matter who” aren’t just empty words for me this election cycle.
Would I prefer Joe Biden pick a woman of color as VP? Yeah, I would, definitely. But it’s his decision to make in terms of who he thinks is best suited, and with whom he thinks he can best work. Period. “Vote blue no matter who” aren’t just empty words for me this election cycle.
Imagine no religion, well not Biden, he's Catholic.
People need to chill the fuck out. Obama didn’t pick Biden until late August 2008.
Biden: I'm gonna treat this like it's December 23rd and people are dying with anticipation for their gifts.   Me: Motherfucker, you're Columbus Day not Christmas. 🤷🏿‍♂️
Biden posting like it's 2100 back in 2012
Biden would say sorry i messed up. How is everyone doing.  He cares unlike 45
POTUS: “I’m not a believer in polls, but ours are going up and Biden’s are going down”.
No wonder they like Biden. They are as detached from reality as he is!
Trying to steal the attention from Biden’s VP announcement.
It would seriously be so funny if some random guy chartered a flight just to create a false narrative that Buttigieg was traveling to see Biden.
Joe Biden and Donald Trump both have big “we’ll just wing that part” group project guy energy.But Biden leads you in every poll on the planet..except for the fake ones you make up!
It's a shame that there is even a chance Trump won't be in office again.  Biden has issues that are being ignored.   Shocker!

Where is Joe Biden?  Can he not even stand up before media and answer questions?  But elect him as President?????
No I am not shocked because it makes Obama &amp; Biden look like idiots with their foreign policy of 8 crazy years. Obama did the bowing down to foreign leaders &amp; apologizing to everyone.

She is claiming that Joe Biden is supporting Sharia Law.
Hmmm. Understandable. I think some of my family's confidence waned a little when Biden gave his speech about the mask mandate the other day, because he actually sounded like a normal human being. Like someone told him to slow down so he didn't keep stumbling. Made him look better
I’d assume Biden.
If you are in dialogue with some GOP friends that are open to discussion what are the best responses when they say Biden/Harris will make the US a socialist country? Not to get them mad or argue, but start them thinking.
If you’re voting #Biden &amp; you’re voting on Election Day I beseech you to go to the polls as soon as they open. With many worried about mail-in ballots due to Trump’s sabotage there could be extremely long lines later in the day. Your courage is admirable. Your vote is sacred.
I just begged my sisters to vote for Biden even though I absolutely disapprove of him. Get trump out of office.  Please.
I only hope that the Trump administration decides to spy on Biden and Harris just like the Obama administration did to Trump . I mean, come on ....what’s fair is fair?

Biden, but work to help progressives down ballot in your state and others.
Vote your conscience but have solidarity with fellow leftists.  I stand in solidarity with #NeverBiden leftists.  I *am* a #NeverBiden leftist.  If you’re holding your nose for Biden, fine.  But don’t snipe at people who disagree.  It’s unwarranted character assassination.
My grandmother said that Biden "won't be able to control" Kamala Harris, and I'm just WOW.
Biden is the biggest fraud.
If #BidenHarris2020 happens, Its going to be a continuation of the status quo and the disastrous neoliberal corporatist politics for at least 8 years. Think about that..  Nothing will fundamentally change. Not under Trump. Not under Biden.  #GeneralStrike
Yeah Biden who is nearly brain dead will be great.  How can you vote for a man who is nearly 80 with undeniable symptoms of dementia.  ???
Did you actually thin Joe would make it to election day? Imagine the Bernie supporters if she ends up the head of the ticket. What does happen when polling goes south and Biden keeps losing his mind?
Unless you are hunkered down in a basement eating Tapioca and are unable to go out to groceries, big box retailers , etc. in which case u can apply for the Biden Absentee ballot!
With a parachute? Or are you that worried that Biden's gonna win?
Neither will this suburban housewife!!! Biden/Harris 2020🙌🙌
Respectfully, get out of my mentions, brother. I wish you well. We disagree about what needs to be done.  Your time would be better spent organizing for your candidate. You’re not going to win me over. Biden already lost my vote. Go hold your nose. I’ll be voting my conscience.
By your vote shaming logic, every minute you’re not spending phone banking for Biden is a minute you’re spending phone banking for Trump.
If Biden wants swing state progressives, all he needs to do to get them is meet these popular and reasonable demands.
Braun is at his least believable when he says things like Biden/Harris represent a "radical left ticket of liberal anarchy."
Our country is already collapsing under your watch, and we are the laughing stock of the world. Biden will bring back civility, cooperation and compassion to our country. Unlike you, he will put the needs of the American people above his own needs.
You mean she’s not going to steal a speech from Jill Biden?
Jesse with Green ballot access would’ve gotten a lot more than 5 percent. He’s the only independent candidate in 2020 who would’ve had even a shot at beating Biden and Trump.
Lib Journos, especially  and  are too busy figuring out how to provide immense cover for Biden during the debates to cover the #Trump peace deal with UAE and Israel.
What they don't get also is that their "logic" works in reverse: Not voting or voting 3rd party means I'm not voting for Trump which means it's a vote for Biden. And on it goes
Antifa dot com lead you to a biden fundraiser until it went down due to it going viral on twitter
Some preemptive  &amp;  fact checking:  "Most pro-abortion ticket ever" Biden is a devout Catholic.  "Most anti-Israel ticket ever" Harris is married to a Jewish attorney. Her stepkids call her "Momala," a play on her name &amp; the Yiddish “Mamaleh,” which means little mama.
Let it be known that I’m not happy about my options for president. I’ve NEVER voted in a presidential election but I will cast my first vote for Biden bc I cannot handle another term w/trump &amp; pence.

If you want to know my thoughts on the false choice between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, this sums it up.  #NeverBiden #NeverTrump
Oh, so Trump’s train uses fossil fuels and just blows past the town spraying everyone with smoke. Biden is eco-friendly and you know will stop to talk to residents.
So, Herman Cain is tweeting out editorials against Biden and Harris this morning. You know, the guy who died two weeks ago, because of Trump.   Every time I want to say something is peak 2020, they raise the mountaintop on me.
If you don't think that Trump is losing his mind, you're not paying attention.
The insult added to injury: Joe Biden and crew have absolutely no chance to defeat Trumpism. Understand, we cannot just defeat the man. We have to toss the ideology in the scrapheap. That’s not going to happen under a “nothing will fundamentally change” Biden administration.
Very unsafe speed for a train in a populated area! Biden responsible as always CC:
Trump: 'Nobody More Insulting to Biden Than' Harris Was  #Newsmax via
Let’s be honest, the DNC chose you because they knew Biden was going to lose. They needed to pick someone whose seat would go to a Democrat without fear of a Republican taking the seat. You are the sacrifice. 😆
So.... Biden is physically fit?
To be perfectly honest,  I think Biden picked her to 1. Help with the black vote and 2. Help with the woman vote. It's called pandering and he's pissed off some  black voters with some things he's said. To try and win some back, he chose a black(she's not) woman. My philosophy...
You might have a certain privilege if you are able to equate the cons of a Biden victory with the cons of a Trump victory.
There we have it: the confession before the crime. Janine is gonna do something to Biden. We are disappointed but never surprised by how low they'll go. Or shes dog whistling to her automatic weapon loving fans
Kamala was my first choice a year ago and she still is. I'll let others be Anti-Trump. I will be positive and support Biden-Harris.
Kamala really said this? And there are people who will vote for her and Biden? Not thinking long term, are they!
This is how screwed up Sleepy Joe is in the head.  Schools should teach America History &amp; Civics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Biden: Schools should ramp up 'Islamic faith' studies, Muslims must 'mobilize' against Trump  via
John Kasich still has influence in Republican politics.  He may well be able to put Ohio in play, and keep it there, for Biden.  And, if we want people to reach across the aisle, it’s good that he’s making the effort.  AOC can have more time without this cancel Kasich bs.
I WISH I could see the “List of Rules” that the “Free Press” had to abide by at Biden’s press conferences today!!!  Rumors are that they couldn’t show Harris in any state of emotion, nothing unflattering, not if her voice is raised, etc...   Trump is NEVER given that courtesy.
Sorry Kamala, liberals in California know you and now will not vote for Biden.   You two are made for each other, you don’t know where your going and have no idea what your doing.  The blind leading the blind.
Donna. I agree with you. I’m sure you know you have some haters and trolls on this feed. Keep up the good work. Go Biden\Harris.
I had to turn it off after three minutes. Joe Biden is a liar and a fraud! Kamala is no better, sending all those folks to jail while she sits there having the luxury to talk about smoking (and inhaling)! #DrainTheSwamp
If you google  it will take you to Biden / Harris website.                 That says it all.
Biden-Harris campaign launch uses the Style Council version of Move on Up to end their press conference. Hope Paul's ok with that.
Biden/Harris: At least we aren't Trump/Pence
Sick of dumb ass niggas...just last week they were posting black and white selfies on social media talking bout, "I'm such and such and I will never tear down another black woman/man...blah, blah, blah..." Biden chose Kamala and the bullshit started...😑 #BidenHarris2020
Biden speaks lies.
I hope Trump is seeing how many "suburban housewives" have turned out to see Biden/Harris!
I haven’t felt hope is so long till yesterday when Biden announced Harris as his running mate!! Finally! Evict Trump Nov 3!
since Kamala is a great counter to 2 of trump's big strategy points at this point in the election, she seems like she could quell some fears ppl have about biden. As opposed to him picking COMMIE YANG or another candidate that would be more appealing to me
Mmm. I think the difference is pretty big, cuz after all it's not about what republicans think, it's about independents, and having 2 of the most centrist dems being pres and VP helps nullify one of Trump's biggest attacks. Also "Cop"mala helps biden be more "law and order"
i used to think this, but also there's a huge chunk of the pop not being considered here -  independents, who biden is currently crushing it with  also keep in mind, Trump's main message is Biden is a far-left wing puppet, putting in a progressive VP would support that
Absolutely wrong. She is a complete opportunistic, hypocrite simply after leftist power. She tore into Biden and now will go out and praise him. Black America should see that and remember it. It’s her way.
I’ve spoken via Zoom with independent presidential candidate Valerie McCray.  She’s a very friendly and knowledgeable person.  She’s a psychologist from Indianapolis.  I couldn’t support her because her politics just aren’t different enough from Biden, but I made a new friend.
Kamala called Joe Biden a "segregationist" last year. This is not going to go well for the democrats in the next 3 months.
No, I feel like we’re having a very friendly conversation. You seem like if you’re voting for Biden, you’re doing so under duress. I respect that. I’m not making the same choice, but I’m not going to vote shame you.
Mr. President, I am a life-long Republican.  I have never voted for a Democrat for president.  And that will change in November.  I will vote for Biden-Harris because it is the ONLY option that gives our nation a chance to find its way back.  No regrets voting for them!
I assume “honking” meant “thinking”, in which case I absolutely am thinking long term.  Long term, Trumpism doesn’t end with Trump. The next Trump will likely be much shrewder and smarter.  And we’ll have what to stand up to that next Trump? Biden? Harris? Really?!
Biden tells blacks how to vote.
Believe all women.  Then Biden is too.
~55K die yearly cuz they have no health insurance.  150K+ #COVID19 deaths.  Millions out of work and have lost health insurance.  Supermajorities of Dems, indies want #M4A. Most GOP want it, too.  That’s a lot of pressure already.  Biden still says even if we pass it, he’d veto.
Question for you: which policies of Joe Biden’s do you think will end the material conditions that produced Trumpism?
NEWS: Joe Biden has selected far-left liberal U.S. Senator Kamala Harris to be his running mate in the November election. Harris is known to oppose nearly every policy agenda IFI supports, and her record proves it.
If Biden is hiding his gaffes, Trump is not ashamed to put his own on full display nearly every single day.
Look I dislike everything Trump is. But biden clearly has some mental instability more so than Trump
I get that not everyone studies math that closely, but that’s not how this works at all.  I live in Indiana. A vote here for Mickey Mouse has as much effect on the Electoral College as a vote for Joe Biden, which is to say it has no effect at all.  But you know that.
Why are you agreeing to spread FALSE RUSSIAN propaganda about Biden? You are no longer a patriot of the U.S.  You are now complicit with Trump in working for the Russians, komrad Grassley!
Facts at first I’m like uhh kamala cause I do not care for Biden at all. But the. I’m thinking and I’m like Lauren look at the symbolism in this and what this mean for women, especially black women.
I’ll admit it. I’m way more excited about Harris than I am Biden. She would have been my primary vote. I’m glad she’s on the ticket #BidenHarris2020
Nope, definitely not about me. It’s about the 55,000 human beings who die every year because they don’t have health insurance.  Joe Biden told a room full of his wealthy donors nothing would fundamentally change for them, which means the status quo that got us Trump won’t end.
And don’t forget in non-sports news Biden has a VP. What a day for news. One I will never forget.
The mess that Biden made?
Not me. I said why are you wasting time in my mentions when you could be out organizing for Biden. Get to it!
If by "Keep America Great" you mean living in a country needlessly ravaged by a deadly virus that has killed more than 165K people, closed schools and caused economic calamity, I'll take radical left liberal anarchy and government-run healthcare all day long. Biden/Harris 2020!
Biden just lost by a wider margin than before
Vote your conscience. I’ll vote mine.  Go organize for your candidate.  Every minute you spend not phone banking for Biden is a minute you spend phone banking for Trump.
Oh, for heaven’s sake. Is that one of Biden/Harris talking pts? TRUMP2020
Do you guys know where I can get a Biden yard sign around here?
Kamala Harris proves that politicians have zero values. Biden was accused of sexual assault and Harris said she believed the women who was assaulted. Then she accepts the VP slot. How can she reconcile this?
Can Dr. Jill Biden be First Lady &amp; Secretary of Education? 🧐🧐
Biden-Harris.   On fire!
Biden/Harris = 4 More Years!!! A lifelong do nothing racist and a Senator from the worst state in the country. LMAO #Trump2020 #Trump2020Landslide #LiberalLogic
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
See this is what I'm talking!! I love you Bernie for supporting Biden/Harris!!! We need trump to go down!!
Carmel Dems are all in for Biden/Harris 2020! Let’s get to work.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “National Women for Biden Bimonthly Call” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
hoping that biden will be more progressive and effective if he wins and gets majority in congress
Hell at this point that might be just an old dude hugging the president. This shit is gonna get nuts in the next month or so. I’m still not convinced Trump and Biden will be the nominees. This is a goat fuck of mammoth proportions.
Because they don’t want Biden to. Duh. Obvious. Trumps asked like million times.
I support #Biden/Harris, you keep supporting these losers so we can vote you out in 2022, loser.
One more thing: it’s significant that Biden picked the woman who wasn’t afraid to call him out on a debate stage. We need more leaders who elevate people who challenge their thinking. Only weak people surround themselves with sycophants.
They need to just let the VPs debate and leave it at that because Trump will break Biden in half on national television in front of the world.
Can't wait for the debates!  I hope Biden debates Trump.  It will be good TV since college football is about gone.
obama was probably little more to the left but couldnt get anything done cause congress was more to the right, while is biden wins there will be a more progressive congress
2/2: Don’t be surprised if any of the ‘Trump ministers’ says Biden will look for guidance from the Pope rather than the his cabinet.  They tried it with JFK and they not very creative.
Me walking up to vote for Biden and Harris
Biden picked Kamala. That might be the dumbest choice he could have made. She was terrible in the debates.  The fact that everyone knows she had an affair with the mayor to get her job will not win her any votes. Trump may seriously win 40 states, and I'm not rooting for him!
Joe Biden choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate is hilarious 😂😂😂 2 of the biggest idiots in politics
I do recall her calling Biden a racist on live TV. smh
Sleepy Joe Biden has done nothing in his 47 years in politics. He picked Kamala Harris as his VP. She is following Sleepy Joe’s footsteps. Kamala Harris has done nothing in her political career either.
Biden/Harris 2020!!!!! That is all.
Can I bet on Biden?
I totally called Harris being picked as Biden's VP months and months ago. As my prize, I get to vote for the least appealing presidential ticket I've ever voted for.
She's probably the most unlikable candidate possible.  Great news for Trump.  She locked up almost as many black men as Biden.
I’m a demsoc and a big Bernie supporter, but four more years of Trump will be a much farther setback for the movement than Biden.  You may be able to handle 4 more years of Trump, but others can’t afford it. He is a threat to our democratic institutions, basic rights, and health.
If you hate that the ticket is Biden/Harris, you should have showed up and voted for, Bernie, Pete, Warren or whomever you supported. Much needs to be fixed, but until there is record voter turnout in the primaries, we won’t see change. Put your privilege aside and vote in Nov!
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.
I wasn't super thrilled to vote  but I was because Trump is awful.  But seeing that  is Biden's running mate has me excited again.  Can't wait to watch her bring the smackdown on Pence during the VP debate.
IndyStar: Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his VP running mate
I am so excited about the pick of Kamala Harris as Vice Presidential runnning mate to Joe Biden.  This is a historic moment.  Call him courageous Joe!! Game On!
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate
i doubt harris would suddenly become less prominent like kaine if biden lost
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Omg I am so so happy!! Kamala will make a wonderful VP!!! Biden/Harris 2020!!
The mainstream media can say all day long that Trump is a racist but we all know who the real one is.  "You are not black if you don't vote for me".  How many insults are Black voters supposed to take from Joe Biden?
Omg is it true!!!! Biden picked Kamila Harris I am screaming!!!!
Biden/Harris we now have a Presidential Race!
Biden/Harris we now have a Presidential Race!
Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris as running mate!
Where’s my Biden-Harris yard sign?!
Yes because Bernie doesn’t take corporate PAC donations. Biden has more billionaire donors than Trump and somehow won the nomination despite having seemingly no visible support while Bernie had thousands of volunteers all over the country.
"Do not hold grudges" — Joe Biden
Yeah, I love how the headline says "Joe Biden has selected..."   How much you wanna bet that's not true? 😂😂
Biden has played a significant role in what we find objectionable about the current state of things. I shared the original segment from Krystal Ball because she made good points far more eloquently than I, and I reply because I think your critique is off base.
But when I read these words, nothing he's saying is wrong....  So how exactly is this convince me NOT to vote for Biden?
Me voting for Biden so that Trump is out of the office
Yes, so unreasonable to question Biden mental fitness...any number of videos..
Hopefully it is going to be
Joe Biden selects his running mate with announcement coming as early as Tuesday
Calling out hypocrisy of “vote blue no matter who crowd” who coalesced around a senile corporate stooge that has played a major role in every position liberals/progressives pretend to be against. Come on  , you’ve never told me one policy you like from Biden or Harris.
I still say Biden won't be the nominee  so this is all a smoke show but, Who decides what is/isnt a mysoginist remark?
I mean Biden’s the same way then. Idk, I just think it’s a product of being in front of the camera all day, but maybe I’m wrong.
The American Dream will soon become the American Nightmare if the Dems get control of our government!
Come on corn pop!  Biden would probably be more comical though yes.
We must put country above party. That's what Kasich is doing. There are so many patriots who are doing the same thing. The Lincoln Project has been incredible. Republicans for Joe BIden too and so many more. The problem with most of the GOP right now is they aren't doing that.
If Biden names a woman VP candiate, as predicted, will your wife have to be on stage during the VP debate?
Truthfully not sure Biden can even pick his nose at this point.
#teamPete understood the #ROTR, so when Biden said he was going to select a woman for VP we were disappointed back then. Now when we hear private jet to DE, we Trust Biden not to go back on his word about VP so don’t have those expectations anymore.
Trump finishes his press conference after shots are fired at the White House. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is still living in his basement because he fears for his safety due to COVID. #TrumpIsTheGOAT
And yet he and his surrogates claim Biden is confused.
Greg wants us all to hide in our basements until Biden is elected. #Trump2020
You do realize all of your executive orders will be reversed by Joe Biden?
Voting for Biden no matter what. NO MATTER WHAT!
I’m on Biden’s shortlist of irrelevant Hoosiers. You can trace my car going directly to the Kroger tomorrow.
Against this nightmare of clowns and huge turnover, I’ve been saying for weeks this is a Biden power move. He’s stacked with talent and people will vote deep because shallow didn’t work out so well.
Voting for Biden NO MATTER WHAT❤
Go cry to daddy. Your upset Russia wants tRump and he is losing and China wants Biden. Waaaa
And people are questioning Biden’s mental acuity?
It would be great to hear the perspective of those that support Trump. I don’t want to hear why you won’t vote for Biden but rather why Trump gets your vote.
Biden who?
If you look at this chart, you will see that Trump is back to his approval rating before Covid hit. His supporters really aren't giving up on him. I just don't see how Biden can win.
He is definitely a clown, but the problem is that there are SO MANY videos of Biden touching kids inappropriately, and that will be enough for many people (mainly women) to not vote for him this fall. The DNC needs to consider another candidate if they want a chance to win.
Sure they are fed up, but there are no democrat leaders who are anti-abortion. That wipes out about 10-15 states of votes for democrats. There are still people out there who believe abortion is murder. Biden wins in a landslide if he says he will overturn Roe v Wade...
I'm not a maga, I'm a libertarian Trump is an asshole and Biden is senile. We, as hard working Americans, deserve much better than those two. I don't take politics that seriously, I hate all of them.
Biden has this city locked...
He can’t vote for Biden and claim to be a conservative
You know I've over-indexed on politics recently when I read #RIPKamala and my first thought was Joe Biden picked someone other than Kamala Harris as Veep rather than thinking about the Ugandan Giant!
Ummmm I don’t believe that Biden can get a bike to 30mph but nice try.
So what lies were made up there froggy? Biden is a lifelong politician who has done absolutely nothing. What makes you think he suddenly has the answers? You vote for Biden and within one year you’re stuck with who he picked because of race and gender. That’s f’n scary
Biden doesn't even remember Ferguson. Someone is writing his texts. Buying a gun this week. Haven't had one in 20 years but it's time to put my family first.
😂 I never heard the dementia accusation until that article.. I do recall them saying he was mentally unfit because they didn’t like his policies or his tone. Anyway.. Biden is a laughing stock.
You’re kidding right? It has been plainly proven that Obama and Biden knew of meddling in the 2016 election and chose to do nothing because they thought Hillary would win in a landslide. So don’t tell us a Joe Biden would do something. We know better
Lol. Your leader Obumma/Biden knew it in 2016 but felt that there was no way that Hillary would get beat so just let it go. Now you a holes want to try and spin it and pin it on Republicans? You guys are laughable
Anything and everything. I trust Ice more than joe Biden
The division was started with Obumma and Biden a decade ago. The media are all in on it. If not, then explain why the media shows pictures of black children who have been killed by police when the people are actually menacing adults. I.e Mike Brown
Wait... BIDEN is spreading false information?  JFC.  A vaccine in time for Election Day?  Wonder how many people the president chose to let die so he could hang on to this bombshell.
We recognize how big of a threat Trump is. We just understand that centrism has never beaten fascism. It only enables it. We recognize that Biden might beat Trump, but his politics has no hope of defeating Trumpism. And the next Trump the GOP puts forth might be intelligent.
It’s only going to get worse.   Republicans are selling America’s soul.
Let’s have a face-off!  All trump and Biden have to do is pronounce these words: Anonymous. Yosemite. Swift. Origin.  Winner gets to be Pres, ok?
This is his first term and he has done more for America than any other president in our generation. Check the federal registry! He is making America great! Either your living under a rock or Joe Biden’s ass is pressed against your lips🙄.
And Biden step aside as well.
Joe Biden has one of the most amazing basements I've ever seen... and mine is pretty damn great.
Want to join me for this Joe Biden for President event?
Let’s see...no one knows who she is and she doesn’t help Biden win a state.  But neither does Harris, Bass (also an unknown) or Warren.  Sounds like a great choice though.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Biden National Volunteer Call with Special Guests” – sign up now to join me!
“We’ll just pressure Joe Biden after he gets elected” ...  Uh, okay ... happy to try but if you mean through insider political means, that ain’t gonna work.  You need to get millions of people in the street to demand it.  #COVID19 wasn’t enough pressure. Joe is bought off.
And you represent a right wing racist, fascist regime either you as the messenger. I choose Biden!
Catholics don’t support abortion.  Biden does.  Case closed.
Listen to the clip. He did say it.  This post is the lie. Biden has already walked it back. Ah, the beauty of the democrat party, they don't mean what they say,  but they are able to imagine what republicans really mean when they make a simple comment.
If I don’t vote for Biden, then I’m voting for Trump. But if I don’t vote for Trump, then I’m voting for Biden. So, since that cancels out, I get to participate in democracy the way I’d like to by voting for the candidate whose values match mine. Sounds about right to me.
E-Mac I think that it's sad what has become of Joe Biden. Someone should step in and end this and let him retire in peace. I'm a Trump supporter and think he will beat Biden but he should not be running.
Yes.  Trump has huge scandals and isn’t taking COVID seriously.  At least I’m certain Biden would do a better job at risk mitigation of COVID, with better national strategy.  COVID is my biggest issue now.
China gained ground with Clinton and the Obumma regime. They are now up against strong tariffs and they are not happy. Of course they want Biden to win because they know the truth about Hunter
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “League 46 and LGBTQ+ for Biden: An Out for Biden Event feat. Dr. Jill Biden and Chasten Buttigieg” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
No one knows for sure how this is going to effect the voting.  Republicans think it will siphon minority and/or young votes from Biden.  There are just as likely discouraged R voters who don't like Trump, but won't vote for a Dem.
And if Biden somehow wins in November, EVERYTHING will magically open back up just fine in January.  And they'll probably give him a Nobel Peace Prize.
Thighland.  Brilliant.  Hope you don’t criticize Biden anytime soon—you’ve shit the bed on live tv more in the last 2 weeks than your depends can possibly hold.
The "you can't be Catholic and support Biden" has already started, much sooner than in the 2016 election cycle.  I cannot imagine the homilies we will have to endure in the weeks leading up to November.  It will be an exhausting 88 more days.
How’s your elite friends doing? We all know you and Biden got a dinner date to discuss the next plan and scheme. Just tell the people your all a hoax, people are catching on it’s all a shit show and reality tv condensation. Give us our government back it’s obvious both sides
Tonight!  Join Dr. Myers and Indiana for Joe Biden as we talk healthcare.
Idk why joe Biden’s managers let him even speak at this point LMAO. I hope to have the overflowing confidence of old white men one day
Kanye West indicates he is running for president to siphon votes from Joe Biden | Fox NewsBut Biden leads you in every poll on the planet..except for the fake ones you make up!
Ahhh great, another mini-rally that will inevitably help Joe Biden's polling numbers.  Please, never stop with these mini rallies. After yesterdays mini-rally, I talked my neighbor, a long time Republican, into voting for Biden based on your talk. So please, keep it up!!
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Ill vote but not for either of these fools. Biden dug the ditch is in. Cant pretend hes a legit leader
What we know is he is the guy running against trump. You don’t think we don’t know he’s problematic? Our choices are often between problematic people because the whole system is fckd but Trump gotta go then we will deal with Biden.
You really want to talk sex rings with #UrineTroubleTrump is directly tied to Epstein and Maxwell? Really? Mr Grab them by the pu$$y? Wow did you say the perfectly wrong thing. Please keep campaigning for Biden with this kind of talk. Your doing great reminding people.
I’d assume Biden.
I just cant believe biden is worse than trump. Hes not, hes the same but with experience. We need revolution
You better have a talk with your boss. He seems to have a hand in many businesses in China, which is overseas, which you claim is bad for Biden, but Ok for Trump? Hippocrit -a person who pretends to have certain beliefs, attitudes or feelings when they really do not
Is biden not the same with better optics? I truly dont see either as ‘better’ trump is just dumber
I just also cant vote for biden i think trump is despicable and the opposition is equally despicable. Im ready to die for revolution
Netanyahu only agreed to this to help out Trump and divert attention from his Corruption trial. If Biden wins, Netanyahu will pull the plug on this before you can blink.
Our country will have a president one way or the other. Decide if you want stupidity and lies, or intelligent and not exactly what you want. Trump is destroying us, Biden has been around for a long time and hasn’t destroyed us yet. Vote Biden. Please!
Vote your conscience but have solidarity with fellow leftists.  I stand in solidarity with #NeverBiden leftists.  I *am* a #NeverBiden leftist.  If you’re holding your nose for Biden, fine.  But don’t snipe at people who disagree.  It’s unwarranted character assassination.
Oops.. the Biden parody song is from the band The Outfield. Song title is I don't wanna lose your love.
Whats also "out there" is your collusion with Kanye. So I guess. according to your standards, we should be looking into that as well?  No one campaigns harder for Biden/Harris than the Trump family.  They speak, Biden's numbers increase.
Biden is the biggest fraud.
We laugh at you/Tucker every night as you both continue to campaign for Joe Biden.  Keep up the sterling work, the both of you!!  +12 points today and growing. I cant wait to see how much we gain after this mini rally today where you talk about saving a war that wasnt happening
Respectfully, get out of my mentions, brother. I wish you well. We disagree about what needs to be done.  Your time would be better spent organizing for your candidate. You’re not going to win me over. Biden already lost my vote. Go hold your nose. I’ll be voting my conscience.
By your vote shaming logic, every minute you’re not spending phone banking for Biden is a minute you’re spending phone banking for Trump.
If Biden wants swing state progressives, all he needs to do to get them is meet these popular and reasonable demands.
Evan I'd like to thank you for the work you are doing to help Joe Biden/Kamala Harris win in November. Every single time Republicans/Trumpers talk or act in an outright ignorant fashion like this, Joe's polling #'s go up. He is up 12 points today and with this pic, even higher
NOT EVEN KANYE is there!!!!  Biden's polling numbers are +12 today and the more they do ignorant things like this, the higher they will go, so please Republicans and Trumpers keep up this sterling work!!! We are counting on YOU to help elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Our country is already collapsing under your watch, and we are the laughing stock of the world. Biden will bring back civility, cooperation and compassion to our country. Unlike you, he will put the needs of the American people above his own needs.
You mean she’s not going to steal a speech from Jill Biden?
Trump - "Kamala is nasty" - "AOC is dumb" - "Elizabeth Warren is nasty"  So I'm confused - what is the common interest there Jared?  Keep talking.  Biden's poll numbers increase every time you speak.  Biden up 12 full points as of yesterday and with all the BS today, even more.
Jesse with Green ballot access would’ve gotten a lot more than 5 percent. He’s the only independent candidate in 2020 who would’ve had even a shot at beating Biden and Trump.
Let it be known that I’m not happy about my options for president. I’ve NEVER voted in a presidential election but I will cast my first vote for Biden bc I cannot handle another term w/trump &amp; pence.
If you want to know my thoughts on the false choice between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, this sums it up.  #NeverBiden #NeverTrump
If you don't think that Trump is losing his mind, you're not paying attention.
The insult added to injury: Joe Biden and crew have absolutely no chance to defeat Trumpism. Understand, we cannot just defeat the man. We have to toss the ideology in the scrapheap. That’s not going to happen under a “nothing will fundamentally change” Biden administration.
Kanye, who he is funding right this moment to take votes away from Biden. Which is illegal.
He has next to nothing to throw at Biden and Kamala. “Biden is mentally unfit” so is Trump. “Biden says racist things” so does Trump except Biden has Obama and now kamala. “Kamala is a cop” trump wishes he had her criminal justice record. “They are far left” no they arent
To be perfectly honest,  I think Biden picked her to 1. Help with the black vote and 2. Help with the woman vote. It's called pandering and he's pissed off some  black voters with some things he's said. To try and win some back, he chose a black(she's not) woman. My philosophy...
I know.  Then again, these rabid conservatives would have painted anyone Biden chose as a "Marxist".
If your looking for a laugh look at Lori Hendry's Twitter feed.  She has said that Kamala Harris isn't black, that Trump retweets her all the time, and that Joe Biden sexually assaults every women he ever met. Her greatest goal in life is to have her privates grabbed by any Trump
Im voting. Not for biden or trump.
I hope Trump is seeing how many "suburban housewives" have turned out to see Biden/Harris!
I haven’t felt hope is so long till yesterday when Biden announced Harris as his running mate!! Finally! Evict Trump Nov 3!
B4 Biden said he was going to choose a woman for his ticket, I was so hoping for Kamala! I can't wait for the vp debate! She is going to make pence sit like the dog he is!! She's going to rock it as our 1st woman veep! I wana be part of the #KHive Plz give her my Love, from Joy!
I’ve spoken via Zoom with independent presidential candidate Valerie McCray.  She’s a very friendly and knowledgeable person.  She’s a psychologist from Indianapolis.  I couldn’t support her because her politics just aren’t different enough from Biden, but I made a new friend.
Kamala called Joe Biden a "segregationist" last year. This is not going to go well for the democrats in the next 3 months.
No, I feel like we’re having a very friendly conversation. You seem like if you’re voting for Biden, you’re doing so under duress. I respect that. I’m not making the same choice, but I’m not going to vote shame you.
I assume “honking” meant “thinking”, in which case I absolutely am thinking long term.  Long term, Trumpism doesn’t end with Trump. The next Trump will likely be much shrewder and smarter.  And we’ll have what to stand up to that next Trump? Biden? Harris? Really?!
~55K die yearly cuz they have no health insurance.  150K+ #COVID19 deaths.  Millions out of work and have lost health insurance.  Supermajorities of Dems, indies want #M4A. Most GOP want it, too.  That’s a lot of pressure already.  Biden still says even if we pass it, he’d veto.
Question for you: which policies of Joe Biden’s do you think will end the material conditions that produced Trumpism?
2 hours in on Fox and Friends, and they keep rolling the tape of Harris challenging Biden at the 1st debate. That is literally all Trump’s Buttsniffers have.Biden saw Harris’ toughness and picked her for VP, anyway. How many times has Trump picked a critic for the greater good? 0
I look forward to NOT hearing a peep out of Fox "News" once Biden/Harris win.  I say this because if they start spouting off, they stand a great chance of being held accountable for their "news" putting people in danger.
Look I dislike everything Trump is. But biden clearly has some mental instability more so than Trump
Yea the green party has the platform that is closest to what id like but they sorta seem to have boned dario hunter. Still not gonna vote biden or trump tho ill figure out my 3rd party pick soon enough
Yep. But what was expected outta biden. Fuck both these tickets
I get that not everyone studies math that closely, but that’s not how this works at all.  I live in Indiana. A vote here for Mickey Mouse has as much effect on the Electoral College as a vote for Joe Biden, which is to say it has no effect at all.  But you know that.
Biden=trump
Between  and Dr. Jill Biden, NO ONE is getting through when they should not!!
Nope, definitely not about me. It’s about the 55,000 human beings who die every year because they don’t have health insurance.  Joe Biden told a room full of his wealthy donors nothing would fundamentally change for them, which means the status quo that got us Trump won’t end.
Not me. I said why are you wasting time in my mentions when you could be out organizing for Biden. Get to it!
Vote your conscience. I’ll vote mine.  Go organize for your candidate.  Every minute you spend not phone banking for Biden is a minute you spend phone banking for Trump.
No Cory, she just wants to get rid of Trump sycophants like you who are party above people. I know you dont care but 160k+ Americans have died with more to come. Kamala and Joe Biden care and will actually DO something about it. I suggest LinkedIn when your time is up.
Biden-Harris.   On fire!
Trump or Biden. Period. We cannot afford to be divided now. Let's take our country back, then we can fight amongst ourselves, but if we don't do it now, we won't have country to fight in or the right to be able to. #BidenHarris2020
Hell at this point that might be just an old dude hugging the president. This shit is gonna get nuts in the next month or so. I’m still not convinced Trump and Biden will be the nominees. This is a goat fuck of mammoth proportions.
I support #Biden/Harris, you keep supporting these losers so we can vote you out in 2022, loser.
Me walking up to vote for Biden and Harris
Biden picked Kamala. That might be the dumbest choice he could have made. She was terrible in the debates.  The fact that everyone knows she had an affair with the mayor to get her job will not win her any votes. Trump may seriously win 40 states, and I'm not rooting for him!
approves of Kamala Harris.  Here is proof that he donated to her campaign not once but twice.  Cannot wait to hear him speak highly and approve of Biden's choice for running mate.  Or else Trump will look more of a fool than he already does. Hmm, let's watch what he does!
You are absolutely brilliant!  I nominate Kimberley Johnson for the Biden Cabinet!!! 👍💯
I totally called Harris being picked as Biden's VP months and months ago. As my prize, I get to vote for the least appealing presidential ticket I've ever voted for.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Omg I am so so happy!! Kamala will make a wonderful VP!!! Biden/Harris 2020!!
Yes and yes, a really good sign.  Particularly happy that Biden choose the better choice, not the one he was most familiar with.
Now that we know it’s Kamala, I can’t wait for the debate. She will chew Pence up and spit him out. She destroyed Barr in the AG hearing. I said a year ago when Trump got impeached trying to sabotage Biden’s campaign, this is the best ticket.
Omg is it true!!!! Biden picked Kamila Harris I am screaming!!!!
Looks like Biden has Harris legs now! 😂
Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris as running mate!
Yes because Bernie doesn’t take corporate PAC donations. Biden has more billionaire donors than Trump and somehow won the nomination despite having seemingly no visible support while Bernie had thousands of volunteers all over the country.
Biden has played a significant role in what we find objectionable about the current state of things. I shared the original segment from Krystal Ball because she made good points far more eloquently than I, and I reply because I think your critique is off base.
Me voting for Biden so that Trump is out of the office
Yes, so unreasonable to question Biden mental fitness...any number of videos..
Actually that number represents white men who are CEO's of corporations more than anything. They love their money and they they know Trump will help them keep it. Its does not represent all of us, thank God!! I'll be voting Biden.
Calling out hypocrisy of “vote blue no matter who crowd” who coalesced around a senile corporate stooge that has played a major role in every position liberals/progressives pretend to be against. Come on  , you’ve never told me one policy you like from Biden or Harris.
I guess it depends on how you look at it. Biden goes to church and has an issue with one of the Catholic beliefs. Trump spends all his time at his golf courses, when he’s  not being Putin’s wife or writing love letters to Kim Jung UN. I’m not the one with a comprehension issue.
#teamPete understood the #ROTR, so when Biden said he was going to select a woman for VP we were disappointed back then. Now when we hear private jet to DE, we Trust Biden not to go back on his word about VP so don’t have those expectations anymore.
I hear you. But it is possible that trump did unintentionally make the mistake. He is obviously very driven to prove his cognitive abilities and show his superiority to Biden. He might not do this intentionally.
You do realize all of your executive orders will be reversed by Joe Biden?
When Biden announces his VP pick, he should just announce the entire Cabinet, and it will be like Avengers Assembling to save the world. It would be a beautiful moment for sure.
As long as Trump keeps talking, Biden has nothing to worry about.  And Trump cannot shut up to save his life.
And people are questioning Biden’s mental acuity?
Biden who?
If you look at this chart, you will see that Trump is back to his approval rating before Covid hit. His supporters really aren't giving up on him. I just don't see how Biden can win.
He is definitely a clown, but the problem is that there are SO MANY videos of Biden touching kids inappropriately, and that will be enough for many people (mainly women) to not vote for him this fall. The DNC needs to consider another candidate if they want a chance to win.
Sure they are fed up, but there are no democrat leaders who are anti-abortion. That wipes out about 10-15 states of votes for democrats. There are still people out there who believe abortion is murder. Biden wins in a landslide if he says he will overturn Roe v Wade...
I'm not a maga, I'm a libertarian Trump is an asshole and Biden is senile. We, as hard working Americans, deserve much better than those two. I don't take politics that seriously, I hate all of them.
It’s not do nothing see Bush Sr, Cheney, Biden, Pence. They are the gateway to Congress. Those 200 judges aren’t being tee’d up by Trump. That’s all Pence.
If it does they aren’t voting for Biden.
Biden has this city locked...
Biden continues today to fight his tendency to stutter.  Republicans (FOX) plays up this as if it’s dementia instead of the speech impediment he has fought his entire life.
So that means  approves of Joe Biden then, cool.  I guess he's backing Biden because he is pissed that his Dad loves Kanye more than him!!
President Joe Biden
😂 I never heard the dementia accusation until that article.. I do recall them saying he was mentally unfit because they didn’t like his policies or his tone. Anyway.. Biden is a laughing stock.
Mueller said POTUS Capone is exempt from our laws while he’s POTUS.The next day,Trump committed extortion in broad daylight by trying to get Ukraine Prez,to announce an investigation on Biden.Mueller essentially said if he weren’t POTUS, he’d be indicted. Lies are facts to Trump
Pastor, I'm curious to hear your examples as to how he has "powerfully ran this country". No response to Covid as of yet, he has released felons twice on Fridays, he just publicly judged Mr. Biden as a non-Christian and you and I know that judging is God's not ours. Examples pls?
Biden not announcing his VP yet is absolutely messing with the Republicans heads. They will have little time to get their hate ads put together, nor will they have time to prepare Trump for any debate.  Utter genius on Biden's part.
We recognize how big of a threat Trump is. We just understand that centrism has never beaten fascism. It only enables it. We recognize that Biden might beat Trump, but his politics has no hope of defeating Trumpism. And the next Trump the GOP puts forth might be intelligent.
I will wear a bike helmet if I am riding fast, say beyond 10 mph. Or in a busy city like Chicago streets. But if it’s a casual, slow ride and in rural areas, no. Biden’s ride looks like the slower rural variety.
And Biden step aside as well.
Biden's first press conference should be like an episode of Oprah. Televised live and he should publicly fire all of Trumps Cronies.  "AG Barr, your fired, Postmaster, your fired too, Birx, your fired!" America would rejoice in that cleansing moment - and they all deserve it.
Mail in ballots should now be hand delivered to your county clerk. That is truly the only way you are ensured your vote will be counted. I cant wait until Biden wins and we can go back to having systems that work for Americans instead of for Trump only.
All Biden has to do for the REST of his presidency is play any of the millions of videos or sound bites of Trump and say, "Need I say any more to explain why we are here?"
That's called the Affordable Care Act that Obama created and Trump has spent 3 1/2 years trying to burn down. Now he wants to act like it was his idea. He just endorsed an Obama bill AT HIS OWN RALLY! Nobody helps Joe Biden more than Donald Trump. See ya on 11/03/2020!!
“We’ll just pressure Joe Biden after he gets elected” ...  Uh, okay ... happy to try but if you mean through insider political means, that ain’t gonna work.  You need to get millions of people in the street to demand it.  #COVID19 wasn’t enough pressure. Joe is bought off.
And you represent a right wing racist, fascist regime either you as the messenger. I choose Biden!
So Biden isn’t allowed to disagree with the issue of abortion and a woman’s right to choose, which IS LEGAL, but the “Walking Sin Machine” in the WH gets a pass?
Who said I supported Biden? Fuck him too.
If I don’t vote for Biden, then I’m voting for Trump. But if I don’t vote for Trump, then I’m voting for Biden. So, since that cancels out, I get to participate in democracy the way I’d like to by voting for the candidate whose values match mine. Sounds about right to me.
1992..Clinton...OMG they’re going to take our guns!!! 2008...Obama...OMG they’re going to take our guns!!! 2020...Biden...OMG they’re going to take our guns!!! 3 different decades...Same BS
And if Biden somehow wins in November, EVERYTHING will magically open back up just fine in January.  And they'll probably give him a Nobel Peace Prize.
Kanye West indicates he is running for president to siphon votes from Joe Biden | Fox News
I wish you were the Democratic nominee. I cannot in good conscious vote for Trump or Biden. This may be the first year I won’t vote. I don’t feel I have a good choice from either party.
Yes Dan, unlike your Satan Worshipping Messiah, Biden is still very much Moderate. The problem with the GOP is, you’ve traded in your allegiance to Lincoln, in exchange for an Ouija Board for your Faith. Look at Falwell as an example. Good pic with his pants unzipped, wasn’t it?
Don't worry you've sicked Kanye on them. Joe will certainly never get a single black vote now right????  After all, you've done more for black people than anyone, right? and Joe Biden isn't Catholic, right? And Covid has disappeared, right? And the new health care plan is out?THE ONLY TRUTH IN JOE BIDEN'S SPEECH IS WHEN KAMALA HARRIS SAID "I WILL DO ANYTHING JOE BIDEN WANTS ME TO DO". WILL SHE BLOW IT FOR JOE BIDEN !
Biden attends church regularly.  Trump had peaceful protestors teargassed so that he could use a bible as a prop outside of a church for a photo op.
Very unsafe speed for a train in a populated area! Biden responsible as always CC:

How’s your elite friends doing? We all know you and Biden got a dinner date to discuss the next plan and scheme. Just tell the people your all a hoax, people are catching on it’s all a shit show and reality tv condensation. Give us our government back it’s obvious both sides

I've supported  for President even before he announced his candidacy. Honestly I'm the only person I know who had him as their first choice. Why? Because he can win! I don't care if Biden is your second, fourth, or seventh choice. As long as  and  .
Trump will stand and answer questions from the press, daily.  Obama? No.  Biden? Never.  Trump cares about your Rights more than any Dem.
Stop pretending like Biden is equal to Trump and wake the fuck up. Think about how much better we would be dealing with Covid-19 if Biden was president rn. Thousands upon thousands of lives would be saved. Trump needs to be removed.

Julie, someone should tell him quick! I’m sure he is completely clueless to this. Someone to tell Joe Biden if he can’t be trusted to babysit the grandkids alone - he can’t run the country. Julie, SOMONE SHOULD TELL HIM!!!
But that would hold Biden to a higher standard than Trump.
My husband got told he was, “just like Biden.” My husband said, “Why, thank you.” 😌
So is Hilary and Biden. We are fucked.
If Trump is reelected thousands upon thousands of people will die that would have otherwise been alive if he didn't get reelected. Stop with this fucking nonsense, Biden sucks but it's still soo important that he beats Trump.
You're delusional. Trump is sooooo much worse than Biden. We have literal concentration camps because of Trump and hundreds of thousands are dying from Covid because of Trump.
Do you want 4 more years of Trump destroying this country? Because that's how we will get 4 more years of Trump. Biden is awful but he's still sooooo much better than Trump. Don't be stupid, vote to get Trump out.
It's Biden or Trump. Anyone that thinks anyone other than Biden or Trump has a chance is delusional.
Besides, who needs to criticize Davis, when we could instead band together to criticize the neolib dipshits going "Angela Davis says vote Biden, so let's use her for a disingenuous appeal to authority on this one thing and then never Google anything else she's ever said or done."

Biden and Harris are the same-old shit with different identity, progressive rhetoric, no soul, and no humanity.  Will I vote in 2020? Probably. But if you deny this as a valid way of thinking, just because 45 is terrible, you have no clue what the working class is experiencing.
Why am I expected to vote for someone whose platform is on record as being "nothing will fundamentally change"?  I want fundamental change.  I want humane treatment.  I demand something different from what I've known my entire life.  Biden and Harris offer NONE of that.
I am not looking to be edgy, confrontational, or provocative.   My list of reasons to vote for a Biden-Harris ticket are dwindling.  What has democracy and capitalism done for me and other working-class people, that defends their lack of clear, pro-worker initiatives?
That one asks this question shows the success of a dubious canard against tactical voting that's been promulgated &amp; fed by the problematic myth of American individualism.   Trump's an existential threat to our republic. Right now, Biden's our best hope. That's all one need know.
Anyone who says Biden and Trump are the same are pretty much beyond hope, blinded by ignorance, agenda, or both.
I was disappointed that you were not picked as the VP. However I do respect the choice that was picked. I hope and pray you are asked to be part of the Biden administration hopefully when Biden is elected. I’m thinking the National Security Advisor, or the US

My state is full of them. I got messages from a few friends in my local LGBT community saying that they’re voting for Trump because Biden didn’t pick Bernie or AOC for VP. A few guys I’ve run into lately are Trump supporters also.

“Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum — every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing," Biden declared.

That confrontation may have clinched her the VP way back then. Biden imagined what it'd be like to have her on his side.
“She’s good on her feet and I think one of the reasons Joe Biden picked her is he had to debate her, and he knew it wasn’t easy,” Kildee said.
😳 would you rather Biden tho honestly lol because both suck but Biden is like....yikes lol can we just get through four more years of red hats lol and probably have two more terrible choices next election haha
VP Pence congratulated Harris' nomination and was quick to criticize her position on several issues. "I mean, we all know, look, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left."
The fact that alternatives to Trump or Biden do exist isn't arcane knowledge, it's stuff anyone could just remember from watching the election or find out for the first time via 30-second Google Search.
We do. Plenty of progressive policies that get ignored, multiple progressive candidates in the primaries (Biden wasn't in the discussion until the entire field mysteriously dropped under him), or they're third parties "who'll never win" because They're Not Supposed To.
Joe Biden is a fraud that doesn't give a shit about any of us. Also Russia told me to say this. Clowns.
She didn't get traction because much of the Democratic Party sees her as a cop. Which she was. It's not that she was too far left - it's that she wasn't far left enough, and others were better at campaigning to the center (Biden, Buttigieg)
This comment sounds as though it was intended to protect Biden.
"progressive radical" 🤣 Sorry. Progressive radicals know Harris isn't one.  Republicans paint every Democrat as a "progressive radical" - it's the standard playbook. It's never been true.  I could not be more disappointed in Biden/Harris. Too tame. Still voting for them though.
I’ve noticed it’s all whit3 men who are refusing to vote for Biden/Harris...
I doubt that Biden picked her. I think she was picked for him by the DNC. I believe that he is incapable of making such a decision.
Biden was asked to commit to choosing a woman VP on live TV and said yes, then he was asked to commit to choosing a black woman and said no. Take that how you will. I'm voting BIDEN-HARRIS-2020

I wish! They will thank her for her fundraising! If Biden loses, she will be as Hillary! As an African American woman , this saddens me!
Ever wanted to do something but something or someone makes you do the total opposite? Well that’s what happened to Biden today. The Mob attacked him saying he needed to pick a women who is African-American. I know he wanted Whitmer but it’s Phony Kamala and Sleepy Joe.

HAPPENING TODAY:  Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris will speak today...together.
this is what I'm talking about, biden won't save us from this situation.
Because Trump is hurting himself more than anything Biden might say could hurt Trump. That's a reason to stand back and let Trump disgust voters. But it doesn't follow that refusing to debate is either smart politics or good for our increasingly insufferable political discourse.
For all of those that don’t agree about Biden/Harris, we all have opinions and freedom of speech. Agree or disagree with my Tweets is fine with me. Bottom line Vote! Be blessed 🤭🤭🤭

I wouldn't be running in this race because I just declared myself Joe Biden's VP.
I've been saying I'd vote for a hot bag of vomit if it meant trump would leave, Biden and Harris are a way better choice!
They'll just deny it when questioned about it.  Apparently Biden is worried he'll lose California?  🤣
I would probably be MORE willing to vote for Biden and Harris if they did drugs, hung out with gangsters, and were sexually liberated. We love that real-world experience

Biden said he’d pick a woman. Press &amp; JB considers a bunch of talented women w impressive careers &amp; skills.   Increasingly likely he’d pick a WOC. Press &amp; JB considers a bunch of talented women w impressive careers &amp; skills.  IT WAS NEVER THAT HARD TO PICK A WOMAN.

kamala is jamaican and indian.  Where does this help Biden
There is no reason to moan about the VP pick.  There were so many excellent possible running mates...I actually had three choices I liked about equally.  And the others Biden didn't pick could be useful in his administration.
Yeah I don't have an answer. I'm not excited, but I'm not about Biden either.  I'm for damn sure voting for them though.
So in case you all are wondering about Kamala Harris 's ethnicity.  As much as she wants to be African-American she is Indian - Jamaican. Poor Joe Biden as confused as he is mayb he thought he was picking an African-American. #mysouthbend

The country was on fire because of police brutality, not the president. Being VP is a lot more different than being President. Biden has lost a lot of brain cells since then.

Biden is the furthest thing from a socialist. He’s one of the most moderate democrats to be on the ticket in decades. It’s all irrelevant. I agree that the two party system is wack. Everyone has an agenda and none of it is in the best interest of the all Americans.

Trump is winning this easy. When he won when he had 38% in this kind of polls this time he has 47%.   He is a magic man will win easily.   My prediction electoral college   Trump- 334 Biden- 205  Popular vote   Trump- 55.7% Biden- 39%
If Trump wins this November, media,etc will continue forcing panic for four more years.  If Biden wins, same outlets will suddenly proclaim the virus is dying off.
I agree that Trump is uniquely horrible (except in some areas of foreign policy) but things are not going to magically get better simply because Joe Biden gets into office.

Lowest unemployment rate for black ppl ever, prison reform bill signed, more money to inner cities etc. now what has joe Biden done for them
I would rather hear what Biden is promising to do in his first 30 days. 🙂
Biden: Hasn’t completed a thought since he began hiding in his basement a couple months ago.  “You ain’t black”   Harris: Before yesterday, all Harris has done to this point is bash Biden. Calling him a racist, as well as publicly admitted she believes in Biden’s accusers.
Offer those who say they have changed a chance to prove it. I hate Biden as our candidate but here we are I guess...
Right cause the president who's done more for black ppl in one term than any president since Lincoln is a clown. Meanwhile "poor kids are just as bright as white kids" Biden is a better option. Gotcha
that isn't "blaming hillary". the polls had her 70-30 over trump and he won. they show biden 70-30 over trump. see where this is going?  that's the biggest problem. the goal shouldn't be to "get trump out" and "vote blue no matter who". that's how you end up with someone worse.
“Hi I’m Joe Biden, and I forgot this message”
Haha most likely.. the antichrist  Why do u think Biden will be assassinated?
That is total bullshit. Kamala came from rich privilege. This has nothing to do with poor little girls becoming successful. Joe Biden still doesn't write his own tweets.
Great investment.     Hope rises.  #BidenHarris2020
Democrats are welcoming the selection of California Senator  the running mate of former Vice President  for the upcoming #presidentialelection.
Why are u voting for Biden over Trump.

Remember when the Obama/Biden administration started those detention centers
Can we all just tell these celebrities we’re voting for Biden &amp; Harris so they can stfu. Like duh. Anything is better than Trump. We are literally stuck between a rock and a hard place. #SettleForBiden2020 🤷🏽‍♀️🙄
Your facts have been disproven by declassified documents. Obama and Biden and their lackeys spied illegally. Those are the facts.
I see a couple maps that actually give Indiana to Biden. That's literally not going to happen, at all. You don't know this state very well if you think he has any shot of winning it. My vote gets buried in this state.
I find the accounts calling out police brutality and endorsing biden/harris rather curious.
Thinks Biden has a platform of "liberal anarchy"
Very dangerous people driven by conspiracy theories to hurt the Biden Harris ticket. QAnon’s New Conspiracy: Democrats Are Stealing African Children  via
He was....he cannot take communion. Priest or Bishop (not sure) will not allow it. If you are Carholic you cannot vote for Biden.
Loved it. I can feel her powerful mind through the TV.  Together her n Biden are a breath of fresh air in this stale atmosphere
President Trump... Took it There Today... The Angry Black Woman... When A Women Of Color And Strength And   Intelligence Shows That... Now  She Is Always Nasty... Guess What I Will Show That Strength And Intelligence At The Polls... (Biden And Harris) ✌🏾💯💯
And this is the problem with ye running it’s just taking votes away from Biden 4 more years of trump it is I guess smh
Biggest problem with leftists debating whether people should vote biden/Harris is that people don't mention that the system is designed to only allow people in who support it.I get refusing to take part in it, I also get seeing it as the only way to push progressive policy.
Trump trolled the hell out of Biden on this one. 😂
If Joe Biden is the answer why didn't Barack Obama support him for President in 2016?
My prediction: The polls are 100% right.  Biden will win the popular vote by 15 million votes.    The bad news: those 15 million votes will come from blue states like NY and Cali and Trump wins the college vote by the same margin.
MY DAD WHO HAS BEEN VOTING REPUBLICAN FOR YEARS SAID HE IS VOTING FOR BIDEN &amp; KAMALA.
Joe Biden introduced his newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, with the former vice president and California senator appearing for the first time together as the Democratic presidential ticket.
If Joe Biden did such a great job for 8 years why was Trump elected?
Watching Biden and Harris speak is about to make me throw up. LIES LIES LIES
Did she take back all those negative things she said about Joe Biden? It’s like watching a television sitcom about high school kids the way they act. LMAO!!!!
Nice campaign commercial for Joe Biden on WANE-15 while WPTA ABC21 and Fort Wayne's NBC run regular newscasts. Is the WANE-15 Biden appearance a paid political program?
Watch live: Biden and Harris appear together for first time as running mates  via
We are watching the first Biden Harris Campaign event. We have your local news as well so just turn to  and you’ll get all you need.
The Biden/Harris campaign appearance pre-music reminds me of Sesame Street mixed with '70s disco. Anyone else?
This music before the Biden/Harris appearance.
Bingo, if biden wins he ain't going to do shit. Because he isn't capable at this point. The party owners will run everything.
Everything trump is guilty of, biden is guilty of. It's just a matter of scale.
I didn't say it was. I'm sung biden is in cognitive decline and it's obvious. He'll he was attacked on the subject in the first couple of debates.
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris to speak together at 3:50 P.M on MSNBC!?😊
If you fancy 4 more years of Portland,Seattle, Chicago, LA, NYC 100X..VOTE BIDEN and his new flip flopping side kick.. NEVER ONCE have I seen or heard EITHER of them SPEAK out against the violence, looting, killing, destroying or illigal occupation. If I’m wrong slip me a video

Bernie bro’s are in a tuff spot, they don’t like Biden for obvious reasons and they can’t stand trump. I’m hoping most of them stick to their morals and don’t vote for Biden but we’ll see
A lot of people supporting Biden can’t make a credible argument without mentioning trump sadly

Biden’s your opponent, Donny.
Oh honey you do realize Vice President Biden and Senator Harris are going to wipe the floor with you, right?
like yes u can criticize Biden and Harris for being the terrible people they are but don’t waste your vote?
If you vote for Biden you voting for the police.......you are “backing the blue” by voting blue (democrat). 😂 these niggas petty
Joe Biden and his newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris will make their first joint public appearance Wednesday afternoon and you can watch it live at approx. 3:50 p.m. on
So she definitely made mistakes as an AG. Super harsh on petty crimes. However, her time in senate has shown she has really changed some of her views. She has brought tons of great legislation forward that helps LGBTQ+ people. Here’s a decent article
Joe Biden is making his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris.  You can tune in to this event right here on our Facebook page at 3:50 p.m.
I'll definitely check it out, ashamed to admit I voted Trump in 2016 because I hoped the magnitude of the office and the grown ups in the room would temper his flaws...sadly I was sooooo wrong.  If I vote this time, it will be Biden
Mfs hate Trump but fw Biden 😬
We’ve seen both Harris and Pence also. Debates are important, no more so than this year, to see if Biden can put together 3 coherent sentences, before people are asked to vote for him.
Racist individuals support Trump because he’s racist.   Mentally declining individuals don’t support Biden because he’s mentally declining.
Are you saying she ISN'T voting for Joe Biden?  That's a pretty safe bet... 😉
Kamala Harris Gives New Meaning to the Biden Campaign  via
It should have been Tulsi...but you can bet your ass I’ll be voting for Biden. We have to. I get Harris is not the most ideal pick, but we have the power to hold them accountable once they are in office just like we try to do to trump. And trump needs to go.
If support of abortion means a Catholic is not Catholic, then the Democrats have never had a Catholic on the ticket with the possible exception of JFK. So Tobin’s tweet makes no sense. And how is it Biden was Catholic in 2008 and 2012 but not now? Tobin must have ...
Hmmm...another don't follow the CDC recommendations guy. You need to speak with your master. Trump is digging his own hole. Why would Biden want get in the way??? #ETTD #GOPComplicitTraitors
in order to stop the exodus of black voters,BUMBLING BIDEN picked a women who isn’t African American,whose ancestors owned slaves and who made a career of incarcerating black men.
It’s all for show. All of it. Anyone else sick of people posting pics of themselves in masks? November 4th, whoever wins, this is in the rear view mirror. When Trump wins, they’ll realize the scare tactics didn’t work. If Biden (Harris) somehow wins, they accomplished their goal
“Biden has said more racist things than i can count”  Okay so what about Trump...
Walter, mine told me to vote for Biden, so that’s what I have to do. He knows best.
Joe Biden is making his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris. Here's how to watch ---&gt;
. joins Steve Shine to discuss Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP choice and his bill on qualified immunity
I believe we have walked into a new dimension, now that Biden has made an outstanding choice...  We MUST ALL VOTE, NO MATTER WHAT THE POLLS SHOW... VOTE, VOTE, VOTE
After watching her flip flop on Medicare for all and come off as incredibly phony at the debates with her preplanned one liners I look forward to seeing her lose 2024 to Andrew Yang.  That being said she makes Joe a Biden much more palatable.
Can’t wait to vote for team Biden Harris.
Now that Mr Biden has a veep candidate, do we get to start picking his administration?
i’m laughing so hard fuck biden and fuck kamala. if i had qualms about not casting a vote for president this november those qualms are now completely gone. i cannot in good conscience vote for either of the two presidential candidates. 🤷‍♀️
If Biden's strat is to just shut up and let the race baiting fascists remind everyone what we're voting against, it's working on me. I'd vote for an old shoe if it ran against race baiting fascists, but if they're gonna be loud bc of Kamala, I guess that energizes me even more.
So it took just over an hour after Biden announced Harris as his VP pick for Trump to call her “nasty”.
No lie election night is going to be so got damn fun lol. Idk who will lose their fucking minds more! People losing it if Trump gets re-elected or the Trump fan boys losing and Biden gets the W Ahahhah. I can’t wait.
Law and order? Biden? Dems? Have you lost your ever loving mind? They are the opposite
Remember patriots, that Biden is a pawn and placeholder! He is faking dementia to lead up to a replacement and escape prosecution! Whomever is chosen to be running later, it is the same! Probably will be someone sinister but charismatic #dontbefooled
NBC News reports: "President Trump criticized Sen. Harris on Tuesday, for past comments she made about Joe Biden shortly after she was announced as Biden's running mate.  “I was a little surprised that he picked her.""
I’m not really a Shaun King fan and a Biden/Harris ticket wouldn’t have been my first choice. But switching to support whatever nominee can get us the hell out of this shit show is not something to frown upon.
This is a bad move.  Biden was going to win California anyway.  I would like to have seen him choose a swing-state running mate.
Union Worker Responds to Biden's Threat Against "AR-14"  via
No but from now on Kamala will be the face of bidens campaign.  She will be the one trotted out on the talk shows and be the primary speaker at engagements because Biden isn't, obviously, capable of getting thru anything without a gaff.
Biden should release his whole cabinet plans next.  Let’s vote them all in! Show everyone what the ticket holds and what a real government would look like again. #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris #BidenVP #JoeBiden #Biden2020
No doubt those voting for Trump out of spite and resorting to hate speech are going the wrong direction, but Biden's neo-liberal VP selection, watered down progressivism platform and his supporters bullying of the left wing to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho isn't a "unified front" either.
I hope Jason Sudekis is the perm Joe Biden though.
Trump, Pence, Biden and Kamala can all suck my dick idc. Glog glock 3000 on it cause I hate all them mfers
There’s no way in hell I’m voting for Biden, but this seems way out of context and very misleading.
Men like biden think they can act the way they do because of women like kamala. Remember her past.
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Yeah, bully the progressive wing. That totally helped Clinton in 2016... oh wait, that's right it DIDN'T! Uninspiring, counterfeit liberals like Clinton, Biden and Harris are the exact reason we lost in 2016 and sadly will lose in 2020.
Same for me. It’s a stress relief! I couldn’t have guessed I would have felt so strongly about things today myself. Now we know exactly who our team leaders are and what we have to do. Biden/Harris 2020!!
Well she has a lack of substance to match the shallowness of Biden. A middle finger to the progressive wing of the party that guarantees another disastrous 4 years of the orange idiot like 2016. The Dems just can't learn their lesson can they?
I'll bet more folks will watch this debate then Biden/Trump debate
Well, he already sold his soul to Joe Biden.  He's more concerned about his "legacy" than about what is really happening to people, I'm afraid.  Why rail against "politics as usual" and then meekly accept it when they gang up on you to stop you?
Yup shows that when Biden needs her too Kamala will call his ass out and that is what we ultimately need
This biden clown look needs to be edited over his clips where he talks about cocaine and spaghetti sauce.

She hates black people maybe more than Joe Biden. We need that Dave Chappelle skit and have the white people take her to their side.
This image is fake.  Biden’s staff no longer allows him to interact with people of color.
You mistake me voting for someone, as liking them. Me not voting does absolutely nothing. Me voting for Trump, goes against everything that I believe in. Me voting for Biden/Harris is only to get Trump out. That's it.
is definitely not leaving office peacefully this November if he loses to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris lol
A lot of people think the Establishment picking #KamalaHarris as #Biden's VP is a winning strategy, apparently. Mmmm. They chose a cop with a history of corruption in the middle of a populace uprising over police corruption / violence.  No. #BlackLivesMatter
Kamala Harris chosen as Biden's running mate...  Here is the proper time to use this statement...  Hopefully, George is looking down right now and saying: “This is a great thing happening for our country,”
Kamala Harris Hates Black people maybe more than Joe Biden.
If I were Biden I'd announce that unless Trump gets within five points, no debate.  Doesn't want to waste time debating an also ran.  It would drive Trump crazy.
I feel like we’re going to repeat the last election because obviously a lot of people aren’t voting for Cheeto and everyone’s against Biden due to his past and his mental health.   Soooo....
Joe Biden chooses Kamala Harris to be his running mate. Somewhere between the #B1G announcement and the #Pac12 announcement.
This nigga Biden bro 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭II BET
Exactly what I tell everyone who still is Trump-leaning. Biden will surround himself with Experts and Professionals, not Yes-men!
We need to acknowledge the shortcomings of those vying to represent us, however much they are a better choice than the alternative, Biden and Harris have a lot to answer for, and they need to own that. Yes push forward, but also hold them accountable.
Excited for Biden/Harris to take office so that liberals can go back to not caring about police and feds beating protesters, cause in the end all that matters to them is optics.
Anyway Kamala will guarantee Biden wins by fighting Trump/Pence with facts and reason, something that is proven to hurt their popularity.
Was in a group chat with some people my age who swore up and down Biden wouldn’t pick her but here we are lmao
heh, Biden/Harris: “Agree with our opinions, or we will make you agree.”
Congrats to Joe Biden for choosing your VP poorly. Watch for that poll number gap that's been closing between Trump and Biden to close even more rapidly with this announcement.
I understand what you mean. I don't like Trump or Biden either.
Biden already sucks, this changes nothing.
BREAKING: Joe Biden has chosen California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.  It’s a move that fulfills the wish of Democrats clamoring to see a woman of color on a major party’s presidential ticket for the first time in history.
Oh no, Kamala will make Biden support the police, something he fully does already!
Who do you think Biden should have chosen?
Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP candidate:
Joe Biden did all that "if you gotta think about who to vote for between me or Trump then you ain't black" shit to pick the Indian who has been masquerading as black 🤦🏾‍♂️
Don’t get mad at police.  Wasn’t their fault. California so unlawful.  Biden’s pick will help that be the norm for US if elected.

Nearly every damn woman who ran this year was far and away a better choice than Biden.  Agreeing to vote for him to defeat Trump is not the same as staring down the absolute bullshit that put him to the forefront and belittled every woman who was considered "unelectable".
Oh yeah and if you vote for the Biden / Harris ticket you can’t say ACAB 👍🏼
So much for police reform Biden lmaooooo

Pssst... If you're going to compare pervert levels, I'd take Biden of the Epstein friend, serial wife cheating, pay a pornstar, walk into a teenage dressing room unannounced, trump any day. But I'm not a creep, so you kids do what you want. I'm just here to laugh at you.
The problem with your scenario is biden helped sink the damn boat to begin with. Then when another even better boat came along he sabotaged it to make sure his buddies who sell lifeboats profit.
"Xi Jinping and Ali Khamenei prefer Joe Biden to Donald Trump. Vladimir Putin prefers Donald Trump to Joe Biden. That’s according to William Evanina, Director of the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center.
Holy fucking shit can we please vote this fucking misogynistic, bigoted, piece of shit out of office. #Vote
Biden no longer NEEDS a certain kind of VP, he's confident he is going to win.  So he can choose whomever he feels the most comfortable with.  Probably Rice, or Whitmer.
Biden doesn't need anyone to be his VP...different scenario now because of the COVID pandemic and Trump's horrible response to it. Before, he needed a black woman VP.  Now he's confident enough to choose anyone, and he'll choose the most comfortable pick (or whatever Obama says)
This is what will finally drive a stake into the abysmal brain trust known as the Trump campaign.  I'm not looking forward to a Biden presidency, but when kids start dying because Trump said "kids have to go to school," it will be the final straw for many.
Not a trump follower. More of a Justin Amash fan. There are many legit criticisms of trump but focusing on the petty ones cheapens the real ones. Also joe Biden doesn’t know where he is half the time. Or even who he is sometimes. Sad but true.
#MayorPete  Biden promised a woman VP, and he'll probably live up to THAT promise.  But he doesn't NEED any particular one to get elected.  It would be different w/o this pandemic and Trump's horrible response.  Biden can choose the one he's most comfortable with.
#MayorPete  Biden is not going to give him the VP spot, but  Pete must be rewarded for doing the bidding of Obama and the DNC by dropping out just before Super Tuesday so the "moderate Dems" could coalesce around Biden.
It ended the First World War... Biden thinks it ended the civil war... yeah he is way off
Lying Joe Biden.... as always
Ok. I'm sure you'll need those tissues with all your weirdly specific Biden fantasies. You have yourself a good time little guy
Yeah I think he meant WW1. How many people here a year ago could honestly name the combatants in WW1 let alone the virus that accompanied the end of it. Also...
I love Mayor Pete (I’m in Indiana) but Biden promised a female VP. If he goes back on this promise it will be distasterous for him. #VPPick
Things listed on a resume...”I uncovered that Harris unfollowed Biden on Twitter”
Lol but Chris you are watching  have you listened to Biden obviously not🤷‍♂️
#MAGA2020 logic, the 1 accusation against  must be taken seriously, while the numerous ones against  should be ignored.    Accusation against Biden=no proof needed.  Accusation against Trump=proof isn't enough.  #Hypocrisy #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
A pox on both their houses. Trump &amp; Biden seem to be having a contest over who is the bigger moron.
It truly serves no purpose debating a liberal.   Their hatred for Trump is so bad they will over look anything just to say he is bad #SaveTheChildren #Trump2020 #KAG2020. Biden is a bafoon and as long as that is the best they have the will remain ridiculous!
If you think about, 3 Biden signs are a lot for Warsaw/Wawasee. Maybe Trump is in trouble in Indiana

Trump is actually performing better in National polls against Biden than he was against Clinton at this same time last year by +0.9. And well...he won.
Does it matter when he picks her?  I mean, that is really the only "exciting" thing happening this election, so Biden is going to milk it for all he can.

Biden did not write that.
This is what we'll continue to have with biden and his ilk in charge.
Youre a terrible representative. You’re district is covered in the shit of your failed leadership at home, and all you can do for the bation is blame one man whose been in office 1/10 of the time you and Babbling Biden have had to fix these issues.  RETIRE!!!!
What's different is Biden has dementia.
Congress is not using a roadblock that is legal.  They are doing exactly what they accused Trump of... quid pro quo.  Give us this and we will give you that.  Wierd that it's legal for them and Biden but with no proof Trump should be impeached
She should be allowed to debate. I'm a Democrat, but really don't like Biden or Trump. I would definitely like to hear more about Jorgensen.

I understand your feeling. This was me the last election. I voted Johnson. There is a part of me that feels complicit in the last four years. I’ll be voting Biden - not because he is an amazing choice but because I can’t do this anymore.
The right: *insert post bitching about Biden and Democrats   The left: *insert post bitching about Trump and Republicans
Yeah, because I really think George Bush is a reformed war criminal.  He should probably be the keynote speaker in Milwaukee.   Maybe he could give the acceptance speech for Biden, since Biden will probably meander off into who knows what universe.
their corporate sponsors and lobbyists, who shoveled tons of money into their campaigns.  Joe Biden has already told Wall Street that "nothing will fundamentally change."  He can swear on a stack of Bibles that he wants to pass Medicare4All and a Green New Deal, but once elected
Especially because in less than a year they would take the presidency from senile Joe #biden #NoThanks #Trump2020
I don't see why Biden would have to wear a helmet he doesn't have to worry about damaging his brain it's already done
Go back to your brunches and your hero worship of Obama and Biden.
Ukraine is not Russia, nor is it a part of Russia. How is Russia "actively" trying to hurt Biden?  What exactly can they do?  Are they allowed to have an opinion on who wins the election?  You Russophobes are beyond the pale, really.
I think Biden's running mate is telling him that he got picked to run!  Biden wont make it till November his decline is rapidly advancing.  Seems like Bernie is more likely to be candidate. Not sure how it could be anyone else!
You are a fool for thinking Biden can do anything!  I'm talking to the person writing his post. He surely is not, he can't even work a phone.
It would be helpful if Joe Biden himself actually did his tweeting on the Twitter.
What Biden said was correct, not racist.
Even in this funny, perfectly edited piece; President Trump still comes off far more intelligent than Biden.
I agree. In my opinion if Biden is elected he will have to resign soon after inauguration because of mental incapacity, and whoever is Vice President will become president. That’s assuming, of course that he actually becomes the nominee.
Apparently, you don't believe the VP pick can handle the scrutiny. So like Biden, you want to keep her undercover until Nov. 2nd. You are right, neither Biden or Kamala Harris can withstand scrutiny, so keep them both in hiding until Nov. 2nd- as you wish. We'll all be better off
NBC News reports: “Michigan Gov. Whitmer traveled to Delaware last weekend for a private meeting with Joe Biden, two Democratic officials tell NBC News.”
FUCK BIDEN
Who will  pick as his VP? Democratic voters are eager to hear who the presumptive Democratic nominee will pick to be his running mate.
Now! That's funny! Com'on Man! VP Biden! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤮🤮🤮
So scary but this is exactly the reason I still see Trump flags in rural Indiana. White pride from ignorant people. I pray everyday for Joe Biden’s victory.  And then for him to have the wisdom to bring peace to this broken nation.
exactly but trump is the racist? biden should no longer be worthy of a vote from any african american person but the people are brainwashed by the media and will still give it to him anyways 😞

And you are still down about 14,000,000 jobs to the Biden era recovery...
biden is not wrong the latino community is more diverse then we are we stuck hating one another as long as that happens its go b like that black people as a whole  mind warped for so long we just start getting to the  point to even think about being diverse
Is this supposed to make ppl vote instead for Donald “grab ‘em by the pussy” Trump? Just assume we’re voting for Biden for the judicial nominations.

Lol. Yeah, imagine that. Your phony “Spygate” is spinning it’s wheels because it’s all bull💩. But you, on the other hand, are going to have to resign after you lose to Biden, because he is NOT going to pardon you. Pence is your only hope, but your legacy will be infamy.“Thousands of countries”. There’s around 200 depending on who you ask, but nice try, and Biden absolutely knows the countries you’re talking about, what a moron.
Did everyone just forget that Joe Biden is a rapist?
I can't believe the amount of people in comments sections that don't understand how conventions work, they all think delegates from states bernie won are supposed to vote for Biden lmao
If you call yourself a Christian and you vote or support Biden/Harris.. go to church, read a Bible. Murdering babies is wrong
Biden didn’t even pronounce it right!!!!
Biden carries KS-02
Just like "Weekend at Bernies", they will wheel Biden around on a two wheeler from event to event and tell him what to do.
I think Republicans are banking on kids being dumb enough to vote for Kanye this year. But honestly his political beliefs are way more right sounding than liberal leaning. I’d be afraid he takes from the Tr*mp base more than Biden’s
Stop it he is not going to lose to that pedo Biden and his Vp that sold her booty all the way to the top 😂
Donated. I can’t wait to sip my coffee out of my Biden Harris mug while wearing my Biden Harris shirt! #letsgo #bluewave #vpharris #votejoe #election2020
I wonder if she sold her booty to Biden also. Probably the reason he picked her.
It doesn’t matter....Biden will be in an Alzheimer’s or Dementia Unit before the end of their first 100 days.  We’ll have a Jamaican-Indian as President.
#Biden picked #Harris because of  #shampoo
The old logo is awful. Not only is the N pointed, it's also higher than the E if you look at the bottom. And the E us higher than the D. Also, why the hell did they go with "Biden President"? It's just awful. They really couldn't have just added "for" and made the bottom bigger?
And ppl say Trump is racist 😂 😂. Biden is 💯 racist
Absolutely! I rooted for  for VP, but, given that few people are better off than they were four years ago, the Biden-Harris ticket may still win, even if it's weaker than Mondale-Ferraro once were.
It won’t matter!  Biden and Harris can weather the storm and send a little hurricane their way.  It is hard to believe, but I believe truth will win out.  When everything is exposed there will be a lot of people walking away with their tails between their legs!
I just pray Biden doesn’t win lol
Honestly only reason why Biden picked her is cause he knows women and black ppl will vote for him just so she can get in the office. But she is a damn moron
Joe Biden may have just harmed his chances more than helping them. Kamala Harris record as a prosecutor speaks for itself.
IDK why my sphere is surprised, he essentially did the same thing with Clinton. Voting for Biden to stop fascism
Biden-Harris: baby-killers. Merciful Lord, forgive them, thy will be done.
She is a loser, but so is Joe Biden, so really... who cares. #Trump2020
Guys, just remember that Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist multiple times.. this just won Trump this years election 😂😂
Biden/Harris!!!  what a fantastic choice!
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Why is Fox News so interested in who Joe Biden picks as his VP? Who cares!
So #KamalaHarris is Biden's VP! I guess he chose her for her likability.
Refreshing?  Hillary was just 4 years ago  I’m still holding out hope he picks Sarah Palin.  Still think Biden wins but it does keep it interesting.
If Joe Biden said this he would be “losing it” ... this dude is just stupid .. such an embarrassment to this country and the office
Is that FOR Biden or AGAINST trump?
What would Biden do, or any President do you idiot??? Trump didn't create this virus and he's done everything that's possible to do ( tell me what he hasn't done and we'll prove it right or wrong with facts)??? Fauci said he saved thousands by stopping China travel here!!!
Who fricken cares. Listen to Biden for 5 minutes. MSNBC=TDS Network!
Just took a drive in the country...Johnson &amp; Shelby Counties, Indiana. Trump flags everywhere! Not a Biden...anything to be found.
Would be good, but be prepared for any bad surprise. Who is actually running Biden's campaign? I do not envy those people, and they may very well make a costly VP mistake.
Biden quips to Fox News he decided on VP, campaign says it's a joke  #FoxNews
Trump said Biden is more left than Sanders ever dreamed of. Whaaat?
Michigan is probably paying Biden to take her off of their hands. Been in lock down for 6 months?
Listen to Biden for 5 minutes. Besides that you sound like juveniles.
Read this. Oops, I take that back, have one of your assistants read it to you.
Biden hasn't hurt religion or Gid, you fucking moron.  He's a Helluva lot more religious than you, and he reads books (you're scared now aren't you?)  He's a devout Catholic while you're a devout pagan.  You know, you never met a lie you didn't tell, have you?
That's beside the point, as long as the evidence against Biden is valid, the immediate sources notwithstanding. Biden left the evidence of his corruption in Ukraine for the Russians to find and deliver via their man Derkach and  That's Joe's own fault.
So that means that China wants to to keep their old buddy Biden!What happened to you John? I was a huge supporters, your hate and jealous of President Trump is sickening. Sad! And now you are speaking at loser Biden's convention. You are horrible!  #TurnVtRED #WakeUpAmerica #OhioVoteTrump #TrumpPenceNov2020
Leaving the Biden/Harris press conference.
Thank you Shelly. I do hope more people who are not completely sold on Biden reach the same conclusion.
I'd argue that "most" is inaccurate, the vast majority of Sanders supporters are voting for Biden. The problem that the others have is that no matter who wins in November, dying people still won't be able to afford medicine, and refugees in border camps are going to remain there.
You think the election (perhaps of Biden) will result in a quickly improved federal response—after the inauguration!—that substantially lowers the attack rate (when, by then, probably 40-60M Americans will have been infected)? I don’t think it can happen fast enough.
The Biden problem.
IMO Biden is good but also hard to pin down ideologically. On foreign policy and culture war stuff he’s a basic lib, but his economics seem markedly to the left of 🌐twitter but still to the right of🌹twitter.
I didn’t know it was a record that could be broken. Maybe Biden supporters have better things to spend their money on?
Trump this, Trump that.  Biden this, Biden that.  Blah!  They're ALL missing the point!  We're in the END OF DAYS!  REPENT, for the Kingdom of GOD is at hand!
Depression hitting hard today. Senate took their August recess, no help on the way for struggling Americans, an eviction crisis looming, Biden/Harris ticket offering no answers, virus continues getting worse... It seems like the whole country is heading straight for a brick wall.
I agree.  I’m looking forward to Biden and Harris  😂
I love ❤️ her. Voting for Biden.
There is a long way to go, we have to get through the Bocage, through Market Garden, through the Bulge, and into Bavaria... but right now we need to get off the f——- beach. Vote Biden!! Our Constitution, the American Experiment, depends on it.
I suppose  could change the date &amp; time too ?
What is a Victory Fund? does Biden know something we don't know?
Joe Biden's Brother James owns property on Water Island, 8 miles away from Epstein Island.
Should Biden make sense, speaking truthfully, coherently and  respectfully when answering questions of professional reporters (ignoring the nut jobs), Greta OR just spit-up garbled whatever, while rudely lying his ass off in a three ring psycho-circus?  Got a preference?
Biden reaches out... lol
Please ask him real questions, call him out on his bullshit, and not let him just blab on making up stories about Biden having committed treason and Harris not being legally qualified to be VP.  Thank you.
#BidenHarrisLandslide2020 James Biden (Joe's brother) owns property 8.2 miles away from Jeffrey Epstein's Island. I'm sure it's just a coincidence though...
Has Biden taken any questions lately?
Did you hear the lawyer from the FBI pleaded guilty! lol All your lies are being exposed and Biden is part of it! You act like no one knows Biden had a house on an island 7 miles away from your buddy Epstein.
Sen. Kamala Harris’ U.S. citizenship and her eligibility to be Joe Biden’s running mate.
Where can I get a car magnet (bumper sticker size) that has some version of “Pete supporter for Biden/Harris now” ?? Now that we have a ticket, I’m ready to swap out my Pete “Build bridges not walls” magnet.  Don’t worry we have been donating to Biden for ages.
"If Biden and Harris manage to steal this election..." is as far as I got. #USPSsabotage is a product of the regime who's ass you kiss.
Biden Seeks To Appoint Vice Presidential Squad, Hopes to Have Several Running Mates  #vt #satire
Anyone can rig the mail in voting. But more people will say Trump cheated but less will say about Biden. I'll take a video of me putting my vote on it while it's going to the mail.
I don’t know - he gives a pretty good speech. I don’t like him, but, speaking-ability wise, he is waaay ahead of Biden or Trump though Trump is getting pretty good at the Mussolini type rally.

Joe Biden is just as bad as Trump and will do more behind the scenes to solidify and codify the leaps in executive power Trump has taken. He will not reform the police, he will not fix income inequality, his healthcare expansion doesn't go far enough, his foreign policy will
I don’t have to imagine it. We had it for eight years with President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.
Everyone wants Biden so we can have a real President instead of Don the con.
Biden will before Trump slow ass would 😂
Vote for Biden anyway. At least he is not robbing the country blind.
Agree  If they can do it at the WH  Biden can do it anywhere that's convenient.
Me, too. But the press calling a candidate by her first name is a sexist disrespect, too. Trump is Trump, Biden is Biden, Pence is Pence, and Harris is Kamala. That’s bullshit.   So was calling Secretary Clinton Hillary.
And you know it how?! QAnon is your source or garbage eaters at fox or onan(perfect name for circle jerks)....you think Mr.Biden will not perform better than senile wannabe mobster fr Queens who cannot read and has vocabulary of 47 words that mean zero?! Is this your reality, Son
Trump&gt;made in China Biden&gt;union made in the USA
2 federal unions and the Post Office workers union endorsed Biden, trump doesn’t believe in unions. The most corrupt president ever is endorsed by a bunch of thugs.
So, Joe Biden’s choice has confirmed that trump hates women and considers them the enemy, and that Pence is terrified of them. Nice job Joe. That’s a big demographic.
They need to let Biden-Harris do that too then. No discrimination allowed at our WH!
To me, this is one of the reasons Biden’s choice is so perfect. It has triggered trump’s misogyny big-time so he’s showing it off and broadcasting it to the whole nation. There’s no doubt how much he disrespects women and thinks they should just “stay in their place” and shut-up.
Can Trump and Pence use the FBI and DOJ to spy on his opponent like Obama/Biden did? Is that what you mean by fair?

I will be enthusiastically voting for Joe Biden. Not the lying cowardly draft dodging treasonous traitor trump!
Yes! That’s why the other side (a) doesn’t want votes to count or (b) more votes for Biden/Harris to be called “rigged” and non-binding.

If the far left was in charge then Joe Biden wouldn’t be the Democratic nominee.
I think the "Should you vote for Joe Biden" debate is the first time in a while I've seen a large, acrimonious disagreement between socialists and socdem/demsoc types. it's interesting, and it really really sucks
No I can’t thank Johnson Clinton and Biden for that. That’s the most ignorant thing anyone has said. There is systemic racism and a justice system that targets black men. The fatherless homes is because you lock up black men at a high rate. Dude. It’s not aDemocrat thing
My friends from across the political spectrum are saying now awful Kamala is (even apolitical people) and I’ve even seen some of my SocDem friends saying they don’t think they’ll be able to vote Biden now  hehehehehe

Better yet: to satisfy fair campaign rules, for every hour that the press covers these rallies, Biden/Harris2020 should get equal time for their own "briefings."
If Biden wins, Harris will likely be president by 2022. No one is going to primary Biden or Harris in 2024.  The Democratic establishment is still harpooning Sanders for even suggesting somebody primary Obama in 2012.
Biden is far from my ideal candidate, I would have preferred someone more progressive. But I am an adult, I already lived through a dictator taking over a country using Democracy in Turkey. If you think it won’t happen here, think again. It already is.
Realizing it will be non stop Biden Harris tweets for the next 3 months
If Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would be so great for the country why are they so afraid to answer any questions clearly they’re not answering questions because they don’t have any answers to the questions so they avoid any questions
Conspiracies? She literally said she order it by executive order. She’s said it many, many times that she would confiscate all AR15’s and other types of “assault” weapons. Which is very subjective. And she is also pro-mandatory vaccine. As is Biden. There’s no conspiracy, facts.

Joe Biden has Bernie Sanders support because he said he would back Medicare for all.
Joe Biden has already said he's for Medicare for all. If think trump will legalize marijuana, think again. He is in the pockets of big business and that includes pharmaceutical companies. They won't allow legalization because it's too much competition!

I AM VOTING FOR BIDEN/HARRIS! Nothing you say would change my mind. Republicans are corrupt.

He actually said Biden ignores science, but he won’t!    I think if I start laughing hysterically I might never stop.
You need to meet them in the middle, give a little so Americans can get the relief needed.  When Trump loses, Biden will take care of the States.  This division needs to end!

HOW DISGUSTING IS THIS?

Jesus Horatio Christ! Enough with the f'n polls already! They all said in 2016 that HRC was a guaranteed win. Biden's about on par with where she was back then. We won't know until it's over and after the USPS fuckery, gerrymandering etc. we might never really know.

You seem to confuse "disagree" and "mean." I gained respect for Biden *because* he chose someone who will be a counter-balancing force when difficult decisions have to be made.   You've provided an excellent example of why it's bad to surround a president with "yes" men.
Virginia Mayor Calls Joe Biden's VP Pick 'Aunt Jemima' in Facebook Post  via blackenterprise

That was President Obama and VP Joe Biden who rebuilt our economy. It was only 11 1/2 years ago. Did you just start reading the paper.
Looking forward to hearing you speak! Your voice is important and hopefully you will become part of the new Biden/Harris administration! Good luck Andrew. Best to Evelyn.

"Environmentalists are increasingly maneuvering to make sure that the advisers in a potential Biden Administration understand both the peril and the promise of the moment: we either go big or we go under. "
So if Biden wins in November and gets inaugurated in January but then quickly steps down so Kamala becomes the President, would she still be allowed to run for two terms after that (thus having almost 12 years as president)?
No one has been able to tell me what policies lead them to support Biden.  It's a policy-less political campaign.  The 'lesser of two evils' just keeps getting shittier and shittier.
y-you started the conversation though? you’re comfortable talking about Biden’s accusers with a 12 year old but not Trump’s accusers???
Why does Biden think has has the pleasure of issuing mandates?
my toxic trait is that there's two trumpisms I say all the time and they are calling coffee "covfefe" and calling Biden "swampman joe bidan"
Biden who?
I mean if we have to convince progressives to vote for Biden/Harris more then Independent or undecided Republicans, we are in big trouble.
But how is going after undecided Republicans and Independents playing scared defense? Anyone watching AOC is already voting for Biden/Harris in all likelihood. This seems more to be on the aggressive side, going after votes in Ohio, PA, Michigan etc.

Do you actually want Biden to win this election, or not?
It’s not about people not being able to vote (Republicans can’t vote, either!), it’s about claiming that voting is “rigged” in general, so results cannot be trusted. Trump knows that Biden will get more votes no matter what — he will claim all results invalid. What do we do?
They think Barr will arrest Biden
Lmao 😂 I’m a waste of your time because you haven’t proven shit except the left is unhinges with hate. Gonna suck for you all thinking Biden/Harris is your saving grace, when Trump crushes them. But keep believing your skewed polls 😂 I’m out
😂I want to see the number of people surveyed and where. Another reason for black support of Biden was his VP choice,Black moderates went public saying if the VP was a black female he’d lose.😂is he will anyhow, but just the same. RACE leverage much?😂she cetainly isn’t qualified
There’s plenty of evidence that Biden is too handsy with women and children. Good lord.
The GOP are going to have Bursima shit from Russia! They will try to get Biden with Lies!
Your voice on the pod needs to be permanent. (Also, wish your voice had made it to the Biden team to create a little more ceremony around the announcement! They also dropped the ball on the website - no updates to the social media kit to include Harris!)
Trump won't debate Biden. Trump has temporofrontal dementia. Look it up.
I understand what you're saying. I agree, cannabis should be legal but, we stand a better chance of getting reform with Biden/Harris than trump/pence.
She didn’t. And even her neighbor corroborated that she told her about what happened with Biden. How many women put up with sexual assault to further their careers? That doesn’t make it right but I’m sure she knew if she came forward it would ruin her. There is lots of evidence.

Instead of being a condescending elitist blue maga mouthpiece, have you considered maybe advocating for people who don't support Biden to make positive change by doing something beyond voting? Like running for local office, demonstrating, or striking?
So in the first 24 hours after Biden chose her, Distort D'Newza is questioning whether Kamala is "really Black." Eric Trump favorited a tweet calling her a whore. And then all the "nasty" comments from 45.  I'm tired already.
This bullshit hits every blue maga talking point, but at least it's succinct.  -Vote or you're racist/ableist -We can pressure Biden after we give up our only leverage (staying home) for free -If you disagree you can't read read (elitism) -I'm muting all criticism
Literally from 18 hours ago. And if you think there are any important stories the conservative corporate outlets completely ignore because they're inconvenient boy do I have a deal for you
Kavanaugh assaulted no one. There was not one shred of evidence against him and every other “claimant” retracted their story and said it wasn’t true. Kamala Harris claimed to believe Tara Reade who actually had evidence against Biden but I guess she doesn’t care now.

Joe’s been signed on to 3 debate dates since June, 1 in Sept/ 2 in Oct. Although Trump wants his campaign to have a say in picking the moderators, historically that is not how it’s been done. Biden’s campaign wants it to remain non partisan as released in this statement: “Our 1/

Trump vs. Biden is not a choice between the lesser of two evils.  It's a choice between evil and someone honest and sincere who you agree with only 80 percent of the time.  So make your choice between an enemy of democracy and an 80 percent friend.
What specific policies does a Biden/Harris ticket put forth (being ‘not Trump’ is not a policy)?
Guy died like two weeks ago and he's already back attacking Biden and Harris.
🤣 Biden must win? Good luck with that. He’s gonna forget to show up.
For starters, the Biden campaign didn’t pick 💩 😂 secondly, the funny part of it all is the left is pushing the BLM nonsense so the VP pick is a cop, lawyer who prosecuted young black men. See the irony? Also an honorable mention goes to the fact she called Biden a racist 😂
Kamala Harris’s Cultural Impact  RightOn #BidenHarris2020Landslide #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica #Biden
No it’s an issue that YOU care about. Trump makes stupid gaffes but I never considered that he should take a cognitive test as a mandatory proof that he’s fit for office. He decided to do that on his own terms It backfired because Biden doesn’t play stupid games. Now Trump 1/
Biden is fit, slim and active. Trump is obese, doesn’t exercise (swinging a club doesn’t constitute exercise) and admittedly lives off burgers and DC’s and has a lousy diet per the WH doctor. My money is on Biden FTW. 😂
And I say, as I have numerous times, that isn’t your call or my call. That’s between Biden and his doctor. Just like Trump and his doctor decided that it was important that he take the test for whatever reason, they felt it was warranted. Trump then decided to make his 1/
I NEVER said I didn’t believe Trump’s doctors. I don’t believe Trump’s account, because he’s not truthful. His doctor’s aren’t speaking out publicly regarding his test or releasing his test results as part of his medical record. Biden’s doctors HAVE released his medical records.
It’s the Post. Right wing propaganda. You can’t read the paper in front of him, it’s blurred. He’s holding his phone mic toward the computer screen because there’s a likely a 3rd person on the call talking in a conference with Biden/Harris. Next.You’re an acab believer who supports Biden (the crime bill author) and Kamala (a hypocrite prosecutor).  Lol.  😂🤣😂🤣. You hate yourself.  HAHAHA
I know, I’m going to vote for Biden. I’m also not going to be quiet when I disagree with him, and neither should our dem elected officials
I don’t agree with your premise. Rashida pushing Biden left within the dem party doesn’t help Trump. I would argue it helps Biden by keeping the left engaged with the process. Swing voters don’t pay attention to or care about this type of stuff. Clearly you aren’t swayed by it
I don’t agree, FDR-Wallace was more progressive, &amp; there are more examples. Regardless, Biden &amp; Kamala are clearly to the right of Bernie &amp; squad, of course they will do all they can to push them left. It doesn’t help Trump, it’s actually necessary to keep the left engaged
I disagree. The point is to put pressure on the Biden camp and remind them that there are real progressives in congress that won’t keep quiet if promises are not kept, and that will continue to push him to adopt the positions of the large majority of the party.
If there's one thing we must do during a pandemic is to ensure they health insurance companies can keep profiting - Joseph Biden
Trump has a solid base Biden not so much. You can’t tell me that the Biden Harris ticket excites you. His brain is mush and she’ an idiot. Are country is screwed if he is elected. He will give our country to China or the highest bidder.
Rashida is going to vote for Biden in the general and encourage her constituents to do the same. Isn’t that what really matters when it comes to beating Trump? Why does she have to pretend she’s OK with the platform not including Medicare for all if that is her honest position?
I’m voting Biden. Please stfu about politics AND twitter, stay in your lane. — See, I can do it too!   But real talk, how you gonna be mad at home girl Tay Tay for using HER Twitter to voice HER [‘merican] right opinions when you’re sitting over there doing the exact same thing?
Well my account is older, maybe you won’t call me a bot. I agree with the cat, it’s a good thing for our elected officials to be honest and upfront ab their views. It’s not as if she’s encouraging her constituents to not vote for Biden, this is just a statement of values
His true cult supporters are so deep into their love for him, that he can convince them that this is Biden, or even Obama's fault.
Such a perfect metaphore of the Biden campaign. Lol
Total bullshit everything you just said. That’s a cnn msnbc talking point. Liberals showed their hands how they lead. Do as I say not as I do all the while their city is burned to the ground. Biden-Harris ticket is a total shit show.
It's a shame that there is even a chance Trump won't be in office again.  Biden has issues that are being ignored.   Shocker!
I’m not going to argue with you. Biden has problems and I really think most people know this. If you have ever known someone with dementia, you can tell. Trump has his faults, everyone does but at least he faces reporters and answers their mostly stupid questions.
A work call: How old are you?? You sound like a millennial! I hope you vote and when you vote it’s not for Biden and chlamydia. Vote and vote trump!   Why call somewhere and get political on me lol I won’t respond 😂😂 I literally am not allowed
Drinking some wine and thinking how awesome it will be when Biden is president and you are in prison!
He did answer questions and a lot of them. I listened to them. Stupid questions deserve no answers. Biden has not answered 1 question. One can read with dementia but cannot answer questions w/o script.
"Now just a minute! This is a press conference! The last thing I want to do is answer a lot of questions!" -General Maynard Mitchell (or is that Joe Biden's handlers, who can tell?)
Good thing Joe Biden has a pla......wait nevermind
Whatever Trump and them are trying to do won’t overcome turnout and the disapproval of white voters in swing states who like Biden more than Trump. I’m increasingly convinced they’ll have to depend on Russia efforts specifically
on CNN askng that we not be distracted by trump's crap.  She couldn't be more correct. He dangles wild theories and BS to distract from a broken economy and a deadly virus. To win, we must stay focused on how the Biden/Harris ticket will help us recover democracy.
Just like with Ukraine. Trump wanted to damage Biden by pressing president Zelensky to make a public announcement stating that he was investigating the Biden’s, By releasing a warning letter to 46 states about possible mail in ballot delays, The damage has already been done.

I Would force myself to watch a RACIST NBA GAME one time If I could see Kamalas reaction when she wakes up one morning and she opens her eyes to see Biden sniffing her hair and neck.... 🥴
If Kamala and Biden were to share a bus, who gets the back ??????? 😳
fuck it I'm not voting for trump, Biden, or even Kanye. I'm voting for Donald Glover I'm sure that man would make a great president
If you know Biden will win, just say that.
I'm convinced Biden call these MFs coons and porch monkeys and they'd still vote for him
I live in Indiana to and while I'd usually agree I'm not quite so sure this time around. His trade wars bs has hurt the farming community and people can see he's fucking up the COVID response. Clinton got wiped out in 16 but Biden is more appealing to independents than she was.
If you don’t vote Biden in, Trump is re-elected. It’s about who you want less. Don’t be delusional.
The greatest Biden/Harris soundbite ever.
Where is Joe Biden?  Can he not even stand up before media and answer questions?  But elect him as President?????
Hey if you want your 401K to tank, the stock market to tank, and for our military to be weak, vote for Biden!
Trump will win the election in 2020 by numbers NEVER  seen. IN 4 years he will win on... 1-POLICY 2-PRINCIPLES 3-FIGHTING FOR US  CITIZENS  4.TAXES  5.ECONOMY  ALL PEOPLE 7. WILL CUT TAXES     Much much more LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE  BIDEN AND HARRIS 🤣🤣🤣
Battle looms over Biden health care plan if Democrats win big
If you recall they have.. the powers that be choose to do nothing..what the fuck do you expect?#SaturdayVibes
Voting third party is voting for Trump. Vote Biden because at least he’s not Trump. That’s it
When we tell people a worse trump is coming this is what we mean. This is what a Biden presidency will lead to
Pleasantly surprised in my all white north side Indy neighborhood when 1 Trump flag went up 3 BLM signs went up in other yards the next day.  My Biden sign is on its way to go with my  sign!  Also seeing a lot like my yard flag here all across town!
Thanks but no thanks. Radical-left can loot, riot &amp; burn down American cities, they can stand in line to vote. Or not, Elder Abuse Victim Biden &amp; Drug War Warrior Harris have already lost.  So you can keep Chicago System of vote early/vote often  NeXT.
3 Viral Falsehoods About Kamala Harris..She  too is a  looser  just as Biden is both liers and say what they think  the  people  want to hear not   what is  real both  the  worst  the Dem   and     all they hAve  to offer   guess  what  Dems  loose again  I VOTE TRUMP again 2020
Dump Trump, Elect Biden/Harris or else....
How would you respond if the media completely pretended Biden didn’t exist?
No I am not shocked because it makes Obama &amp; Biden look like idiots with their foreign policy of 8 crazy years. Obama did the bowing down to foreign leaders &amp; apologizing to everyone.
But you will not mention how Biden said that blacks lacked diversity of thought or that he basically called a black reporter a crackhead, hypocrite, Tiedcrite.
From what I see in the Ohio country side, it is Trump/Pence by a landslide. I see the occasional Biden bumper sticker but no signs.
New Biden/Harris campaign slogan. #SLOHO
You do realize that picture was taken during the Obama/Biden administration.
Biden said if he won, he'd appoint Corn Pop to Attorney General.  We can't let that happen.
Joe Biden C'mon Man REMIX - WTFBRAHH  via
Latest New Jersey poll I can find has Biden up 18. That was at the end of July.
And in Indpls! Ivy Hills near Castleton. All Biden,  BLM signs, etc.
I can at least agree that if Biden and Kamala don't commit to some form of progressive reform of something that I won't vote for them.
Biden mum about Trump crackdown on Chinese stocks
Aww man what a great picture of Harris or is that Biden?
Remember the 1960 election with whiskey votes and ballot boxes floating down Rio Grande. Joe Kennedy fix vs Joe Biden fix

I still don't see how Trump is responsible for China infecting the world with the virus. My brain isn't capable of the mental olympics. But to the original point, yeah it's pathetic that Kamala called Biden a rapist then blew him for the VP spot.

Pelosi says Trump is 'openly working to destroy' the USPS ahead of election – live
Sen Biden should do the same to him
She is claiming that Joe Biden is supporting Sharia Law.
Except these are not private sins where this would apply. Biden did not sin against a private person, but against the public good and more importantly against God.
Harris has made Biden look even worse!!!
I honestly think the DNC handing the nom to HRC In 2016 is why we have Trump now and why we will have him for 4 more years. Biden was just an awful choice and it showed me nothing changed in the DNC changed.
Mike Bloomberg to speak at DNC as Dems wonder whether he will spend big for Biden
And somehow you think Biden won't be.  "Joe Biden's Body Language during the Tara Reade Interview"
I bet you don't believe that now, considering Hillary Clinton won the popular vote and Joe Biden will do the same.
This clip of Kamala Harris from 2015 might have the Befuddled Biden team rethinking their choice of running mate.
I see why normal people are upset with Ellen's stupid shows...and Kamala as a guest...boy we could only wonder what that subject will be about...certainly not Kamala's history or Biden's...no it was something totally stupid...who would guess from these two?
😂 Biden thinks he’s still in China. I think it’s legal to Control the Press there.
Exactly! It shows that even though  is talking about Biden, he’s actually describing  #TrumpCircus #ByeHannity
So the question becomes if Trump refuses to accept the results, will Roberts swear in Biden?
Biden currently leads Trump on 4/5 of America's "Most Important Problems" as reported by the American people. See what they are (I bet you can guess) and my breakdown here.    Also, subscribe and share if you like what you read!
There is an astonishing number of Biden United  yard signs in the holler’s of Western Indiana. Outnumbering Trump signed 3:1.
Anyone who is legitimately running for Biden is ignoring the fact he’s an actual pedophile to own trump, please remember this
Bill Gates..unforunately is a Liberal Biden supporter...this is why he says this..If he gets the virus..he would definitely want this drug as soon as he could swallow it..has proven to be very effective at the first of the virus...but let him talk..no one listens to him.
So Joe Biden?
Agreed!  Biden is a hopeless case. Those who have such delusions would be better off trying to pull Kamala Harris to the left; she is probably going to be the actual President if Trump is defeated.  We know of course that nothing good can be expected of Establishment Candidates.
I suspect the Trump &amp; Biden campaign ads we’ll see in the next few months will be studied for generations. But with such a polarized nation, do they matter? Is any American still “undecided” on who they’ll vote for in Nov? If you are, I’d love to hear why &amp; what will change that.
Try to stay objective Bryon.  Oh sorry, libs are never objective.  So your answer is the Democrat/Socialist Party.  You trot out a man (Biden) who has dementia for your leader knowing full well he can’t serve.  What a bunch of nonsense.  Stop drinking the kool aid, Bryon.
Joe Biden every day
Mika is unhinged for certain.  She is so caught up in her hatred for the President she is unable to be objective.  She hates those of us who support the President.  Her answer is Socialists Biden and Harris! She is right that our country is in danger, but not from Trump.
For 245 years Americans have faced death to secure our freedoms and democracy. I will stand in any crowd for any amount of time to secure them by voting for Biden/Harris. #VoteForDemocracy #BidenHarris #Vote #JailtheGOPtraitors
I am so damn tired of ignorance pertaining to Biden/Harris.  You are a danger. All of you are.
Russia Russia Russia, you’re super pathetic.  Did Putin write Biden’s crime bill?  Did russia make Kamala keep innocent people locked up? PS- Clinton was a worse choice than trump.
Join dumbass for Biden:
I don't get it: why the hell didn't they just pick #HeelsUpHarris to begin with? Look at the money, they got $26 mill on her first day. Biden brings in little. All makes no sense.
Point being, what is  doing to support the discount merchandise retail industry in these hard times? Because you KNOW Jill Biden be shoppin’ at TJX.
Well I'm a veteran and trump killed the man directly responsible for the deaths of several of my friends while Biden and his gang spent 8 years kissing that man's ass so I think I'll be fine
M4A. Biden stands at a pharma and health insurance lobby ATM and -miracle of miracles- opposes M4A.  Which is why I will never, ever vote for Biden.
Hmmm. Understandable. I think some of my family's confidence waned a little when Biden gave his speech about the mask mandate the other day, because he actually sounded like a normal human being. Like someone told him to slow down so he didn't keep stumbling. Made him look better
You're hurting Americans by not dealing with the Trump virus running rampant in our country.  At this point, we're just trying to keep you from stealing the election and trying to not catch the virus, then holding on until January when President Biden will implement a real plan!
The government pays you. The President is not a dictator (though Trump is trying). When Joe Biden is President he will still pay you too.
This is wrong. Biden has made mistakes, but at least he has some damn integrity and at least acts like somewhat of a leader. He won’t put this country in a ditch. Please vote.
The silliness and the mentally damaging effects of race ideology in our politics:  Do you really believe Kanye is sincere in his Presidential bid to beat the current President?  Do you really believe Kanye is going to take the “Black” vote away from Biden?
What's to stop President Biden from using an EO to ban foreigners from staying at Trump Hotels for "national security" reasons?
SEND BIDEN BACK TO HIS BASEMENT!!
Imagine: Biden puts everyone who ran in his cabinet. What would be their ideal department?
I’ve been a Democrat since I was 18 but I’ve been voting Republican lately.  The Biden-Harris ticket may be my ticket back. We will see 🇺🇸
But you were considering voting for him (Trump) depending on Biden’s VP selection?
Um, no. Her family has been through a lot because of dementia. I can vouch for that. You do not get to invalidate her experiences because you want to make fun of Joe Biden. It's ok for you to dislike him, but it's not ok to tell someone their experience isn't real.
Biden/Harris support abortion at any stage as you well know. Harris is totally anti-Catholic. Saying Trump is killing the ProLife “party” shows your lack of understanding about the ProLife movement. He is the most ProLife Pro Catholic (NonCatholic) President we’ve ever had.
One week until the Dems flip the script and boot Biden for someone else...
Seeking to amplify his law-and-order message, President Donald Trump on Friday told hundreds of New York Police Department officers that “no one will be safe in Biden’s America" if the former Democratic vice president defeats him in November.
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
Joe Biden is a rapist.  That is all.
If you are in dialogue with some GOP friends that are open to discussion what are the best responses when they say Biden/Harris will make the US a socialist country? Not to get them mad or argue, but start them thinking.
The truth about Biden hurts doesn't it?
This isn't "Biden's America" as Trump would have you believe. This is where we are right now, in Trump's America. I thought I could make it. I thought "I'm good at being alone." And I was, I was so good. I could get through a pandemic living alone. But...
joe biden is gonna win the election mark my words
#MedicareForAll. Biden says he'd veto it.

All of the Trump Trolls on Facebook seem to be replying to my pro-Biden posts with the same photo or gif of Biden sniffing a little girl's hair.     Meanwhile, Trump was sued in 2016 for child rape and, bragged about seeing half-dressed, underage girls at his Miss Teen USA shows.
Harris is already spewing deceptive rhetoric. Obama/Biden did not turn this economy around,Trump did. Look up the facts. I dare you. Because of the left's coordinated attacks on our economy, using this over blown, planned narrative about the virus, our economy is hurting now.
THE ONLY TRUTH IN JOE BIDEN'S SPEECH IS WHEN KAMALA HARRIS SAID "I WILL DO ANYTHING JOE BIDEN WANTS ME TO DO". WILL SHE BLOW IT FOR JOE BIDEN !

Duh, you think that, yeah, it is just a little manipulated. Any body with a brain can tell that Hannity is talking about Biden. Puleeeese....really? Desperate are you?
Biden Catholic? In name only. Catholics that vote for ProChoice candidates are not Catholic.
Vote for Biden--at least he's decent and sane!
As a practicing Catholic I’ve never voted for any candidate that is Pro-Choice no matter the party affiliation. None of ur points can hold up to the # of deaths from abortions. God has used many men like Trump to do His work but God has never used a baby killer like Biden/Harris
Can you explain why are you and Mr. Biden a better candidate compared to your counterpart?
...because you bring a knife to a gun fight.   are trampling all rules. You think the USPS is it? Wait until Barr starts issuing subpoenas for Hunter Biden, Comey etal. Or Johnson releases a version of the Russian interference painting it as a hoax. Dems have got to get busy
Biden scares the hell outta me
Joe Biden’s selection of Kamala Harris has brought out the worst in folks. **Note to self: if you post it or share it, you own it.**
Motherfucking bullshit election sabotage! I'm waiting for independents and "swing" voters to pledge to Biden/Harris RIGHT NOW or I never want to hear from them again. Ever.  I'm not kidding.
Now...now. The big question is: Will Mellie plagiarize Michelle Obama or Jill Biden???
I'm realizing that Joe Biden may be an elderly white guy with some old ideas, but that he also clearly sees the future of the Party and makes choices based on building toward that future. We shouldn't underestimate him. I think that we've given the country a fantastic nominee.
The DNC is playing with fire. All Trump has to do is make the case that Biden is a placeholder for Harris. Look for a new nickname for Biden (or her) evoking the idea of him planning to resign (or the inevitability of resigning due to health).
But this is better.
Like Kamala ripping parents away from children for truancy or Biden ripping parents away from their children with the crime bill?   Ooooooookay
If you’re voting for Biden you’re not a devout Catholic. You’re voting for partial birth abortion. Late Term Abortion. Funding of Planned Parenthood. Suing the Little Sisters of the Poor. You’re worried about COVID-19 deaths! What about the 60 million babies aborted!? Evil.
Pretty sure it’s bc we’ve  moved on from  a debate line  that  happened  almost a YEAR ago, but go off..  Regardless, hope we can all put our big kid pants on and vote for Biden/Harris  in Nov right👍
Thats why they didnt endorse Biden!
If you’re voting #Biden &amp; you’re voting on Election Day I beseech you to go to the polls as soon as they open. With many worried about mail-in ballots due to Trump’s sabotage there could be extremely long lines later in the day. Your courage is admirable. Your vote is sacred.
to my bitter Bernie bros, it's super annoying when you hide behind "don't vote shame me" while talking about not voting Biden when that's LITERALLY all we did to everyone else during the primaries. That was like... our whole thing. Fuck you
There they are: President Joe Biden and VP Kamala Harris.
Personally I plan to vote Biden out of spite. I hope his utter lack of leadership drives this country into the shit so I can scream even harder in 2024.  Maybe people will wake up then. In the meantime, we have to keep challenging corporate Dems in the House and Senate.
You know what? Joe Biden isn’t gay enough.
You’re the one that brought it up- you’re the one who supports crime bill Biden and his prosecutor vp, while democrats call for defunding police.  But please feel free to get schooled, if you’d like.
I just begged my sisters to vote for Biden even though I absolutely disapprove of him. Get trump out of office.  Please.
I won't, because I can't... but I will blame Biden for every failure on the way, point out every American that suffers and dies due to his negligence.  I hate him. I hate him so fucking much that I want him to win - so that I can blame all the failures of 2024 solely on Biden.
I changed to be anonymous because I’m surrounded by angry trumpsters and can’t die because my kids would be stuck with my asshole ex.
I have no doubt Biden is in better health. Can you imagine Trump bike riding currently?
I think the news of Trump’s bullshit play will cause every Biden voter on Earth to figure out how to vote timely!
That is well known..she is a liar and cheat..the things in the debate that she called and accused Biden of are sickening..she is totally her own best fan..she is only interested in herself folks...watch n listen...we do not want either one of them...their afraid of any questions
THANK YOU!! I feel like this should be obvious. Not to mention reports that other countries are interfering, what just happened with PR, the fact McConnells stacked the courts. But Biden can't call it out because that's how he won the primary so here we go
Many Pelosi and Shumer should do the same. How about Biden?
She and Biden are both ridiculous choices for our country...the things they r pushing for r nothing more than   horrid Socialists....Everyone vote for TRUMP/PENCE Biden n Kamala are bad for this free country!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Biden and Harris should earn votes by their own Merits not by our Silence!  I want Trump gone but not at the cost my VOICE!
She’s cackling at the thought that anyone would take what was said at “a debate” seriously.  So does that mean that she called Biden a racist and a rapist just to get her mug on CNN the next morning?
Joe Biden is ethical. We do not expect him to give up his salary.  He will not screw the tax payer like the unscrupulous trumps are doing now.
I imagine Barr has prepared a whole bunch of pardons should all of their dirty tricks fail and Biden is president.
The Biden/Harris campaign staffers shoo away reporters after a press conference. Don't you even think about asking a unscripted question!
My apologies Vice President Biden and Senator Harris. I meant to take you off before responding to that idiot.
I only hope that the Trump administration decides to spy on Biden and Harris just like the Obama administration did to Trump . I mean, come on ....what’s fair is fair?
Postal carriers union endorses  warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake -   #BidenHarris2020 #SaveUSPS
“Thousands of countries”. There’s around 200 depending on who you ask, but nice try, and Biden absolutely knows the countries you’re talking about, what a moron.
Tell any of your family who is supporting Biden. Cause he supports this type of destruction. Will you denounce Antifa?
You  tweeting Biden? We know now because of the Durham investigation it was Obama/Biden that cheated. Go Air Force!
Kamælah Hurries was just elevated by Joke Biden, IMHO. . .as This Nation's Top ISLAMOMARXISED-DEMONRATS' DOGGIE SEXTRAORDINAIRE NONPAREIL!!!   Arguable, of course; so, I leave the judgment to San Francisco's Slick Willie!   Hehehe...
No, this really sounds like Biden and Hunter. Confused? Brian and Ed K. were always confused b4 Twitter banned them for being fake like you.
It should be Clinton’s, Al Gore, Obama, Biden’s, Benghazi , Pelosi, Schumer, Nadler, &amp; probably a bunch more DEMS that saved the economy from a depression. The economy is not the STOCK MARKET. It’s not having 50 million unemployed &amp; a climbing stock market from prior president.
Did everyone just forget that Joe Biden is a rapist?
I got reasoned into (probably) voting Biden. It goes like this:  In 2024, when the US is a worse shit show than it is now, who do you want to blame? I'd rather blame Biden and the Neoliberal establishment who refused to fix anything for 4 years.
2/2 When you have Group 1 voting for A (perhaps a few Bs and Cs) &amp; Group 2 voting for B, C, &amp; D as well as E-Z- I mean, again, it’s a flawed system, but I’m sure you can see the math; &amp; if you can’t see that Biden is at least the lesser of two evils, nothing I say really matters.
Agree. On another note, I do have a new name for Biden &amp; Harris though. SloHo
Someone needs to tell Biden to encourage all who are able to vote in person. The pandemic can’t get in the way at this point. He needs to alter his messaging around this
lol the biden one

Let the healing begin today.  VOTE early!  Take a friend or two.  I’m encouraged we’ll see a Biden/Harris 2020 victory, &amp; if you’re not registered you can do so on Kanye’s site!  💕
Biden has had more than 50 yrs in politics and he succeeded in what? Only thing he did that he was proud of was getting black men locked up he actually went and talked at a KKK funeral that was his friend you better start thinking ppl!!!!!
The Biden Administration showing me all the strides they’ve made toward being progressive
A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll shows that Joe Biden's lead has expanded to double-digits. The GOP have taken various approaches to attacking Sen. Kamala Harris, and the controversy around a new Cardi B song.   begins now on 90.1
Revisiting the clip that pushed Biden closer to victory - makes me giggle every time 🤭 #BidenHarris2020
Absolutely!  President Biden and VP Harris will make it so! #BidenHarris2020
If every single person should ware a mask outside, according to Joe Biden. Why isn’t him &amp; Kamala wearing them inside where the Virus is more dangerous?
You don’t have to be crazy about Biden/Harris but if you are crazy about living in a democracy instead of a djt dictatorship the vote for Biden against djt. It’s only four years before you can choose again.
Never Trump. Never Biden. Vote for my dick.
Please vote Biden/Harris to save our Democracy!  PLEASE
Do you want to know what Biden/Harris think of Americans?  Their silence on their party leaving Washington with no deal says it all.
the point would still hold if you get the point: there is no direct correlation btwn having radical politics, or even being seen as an influential/authoritative voice on the radical left, and arguing that people should vote Biden this election. One ex demonstrates this, I named 2
HUGE SHOW...  on Trump's mid-east peace deal  on Big Ten cancelling football  on the Biden/Harris ticket It's BEER SAMPLE FRIDAY  ...and it's  with  filling in for Hammer all afternoon long! LET'S DO THIS!!

Joe Biden *sitting across from the King of Bahrain and his robot bodyguard* heh. listen jack, in my day we had tin cans and we had air rifles. i could stand back thirty, forty, thirty yards with one'a those and if you don't know about that, I guess that's the, the big roast beef.
Apparently Joe Biden isn't familiar with Israel and United Arab Emirates. 30 plus years in the Senate, Vice President for 8 years.  This from the guy who didn't know Finland was its own country.  JFC

I’ve seen a little too many Biden signs
We need to vote and work like Biden is 10 points behind.
If that’s how you see it 🤷🏻‍♂️.   Biden’s platform is being criticized by the Right as radical Leftwing because it’s so progressive - it just didn’t go far enough to appease voters who drew their line in the sand with full-on socialism.
That sounds like Joe Biden!!!
Biden has brain aneurisms ... and won’t take a simple test to prove he is competent bc he isn’t. Why isn’t this a big deal to y’all?!
You do realize that every single poll out there shows Biden leading Trump?
or people who don’t feel comfortable voting for biden or trump because of their predictory &amp; racist behaviors (and other obvious things), so instead of not voting  all, i urge them to vote 3rd party.
i stear people who would usually vote for trump because they don’t like biden to vote 3rd party
I really said I wasn't voting for Bernie or Biden. Now look where we're at.
🤷🏻‍♂️ Never been one to give in to demands of hostage takers. Primary voters were clearly in favor of Biden, but leftists demanded their votes weigh more than all others. “Reactionaries” you mention aren’t trying to circumvent the vote by getting their preference on the ticket.
Our lives and ways of democracy depend on it so Biden gets our vote.
Now do Biden drooling and trying to speak the English language...
I can't believe the amount of people in comments sections that don't understand how conventions work, they all think delegates from states bernie won are supposed to vote for Biden lmao
His sabotage will backfire. We want more absentee ballots to make it easier to vote. But that asks which candidate needs it to be easier. Biden voters would crawl across hot lava to vote. Other than hard core Trumpeters, republicans are not so enthused.
This is a BIG deal (I won’t quote Joe Biden) but many thanks to the MInd Trust and our many partners who are making this happen for our families!!!
Brandon why must it be comparative? Both are awful but the thinking that Biden is a savior is incredibly naive biased and frankly idiotic....hope you’re well
"This is the most important US #election," said John M. Koenig, former chargé d'affaires of the embassy in Berlin. "How interested are the Germans in the US election? They are obsessed with it," said John B. Emerson, former ambassador to Germany.
And Barr has said that none of the principals involved in these cases are "political" so he will continue rolling them out during the final months of the campaign.  Which means we can fire him immediately after Biden wins.
How you can compare Biden's racist statements to all the racist stuff coming from trump is amazing. trump and his father got busted for housing discrimination by the doj. I'm sure you know that.
to be honest as a black man in America we are screwed either way Donald chump hasn’t done crap but set us back 60+ years and Biden well like you said hasn’t done anything for the minority’s so here we are screwed again

The only thing we can do is stay vigilant cause I already know if Biden gets elected all the people that cared about blm bc it’s trendy will want to go back to the status quo😭 shit maybe if trump stays the next 4 years we’ll start a revolution 💀
Remember when Bushed spied on American, locked up whistleblowers, and drone bombed people around the world. Then Obama got in office and just did more of that than Bush could ever dream of... Somehow...I don’t trust Joe Biden to stop the secret police.
Trump has requested his mail-in ballot, so make sure you do the same!! #Election2020
Cruz is the subordinate. My boss gets on me once in awhile too.  Harris called Biden out on his racism and segregationism ams she now gonna agree to run with him worse yet joe still picked her. Well Obama actually did. If Cruz talked to Trump like that he would be gone
As much as I joke I know my shit the Biden camp isn’t gonna gaslight me into voting for that pedo

To wrap up this thread I do not identify with the right or left fuck Trump, Pence, Biden, and Kamala. There isn’t a lesser of 2 evils here and if you think that you have a privilege of thinking either side aren’t fascist international criminals
Nah, Trump is a traitor and has blood on his hands.  Biden might be a little weird and sure, he helped pass some questionable laws, but he’s not a traitor and if there is blood on his hands, it ain’t like he was influenced by Putin.   Also, I said uninformed, not different.
Thought he is racist. He asked an African American reporter if he’s a cocaine junkie because he asked about his cognitive testing. You can’t accuse Trump of one thing then give Joe Biden a pass because he’s Democrat.
Dont forget Joe Biden saying, that if you don’t know if your for him or Trump then you ain’t black. You can’t work at a 7/11 or a Dunkin Donuts if you don’t have a slight Indian accent. The Latino comm is more well rounded and diverse than African Americans. Hell even Kamala
People are shitting on Biden n kamala like trump isn’t a fascist. It’s the exact same people that were weeping and hopeless when trump got elected. Get your shit together y’all
The attempts to make Joe freaking Biden, about as boring an establishment figure that exists in Democratic Party politics, into some sort of crazy radical are such utter weak sauce you can tell the wingnuts’ hearts aren’t in it.
Please GOD let Biden &amp; Harris win this Election
Trump wanted to sue the state of California because they wouldn’t allow private prisons there..I know that’s a reason why  doesn’t back medical or recreational in this state..when Biden wins these prisons as well as the justice system and many laws news adjusted!
I will vote for Joe Biden against  any day to save America.
That was just the beginning though, starting in the early 80s President Reagan, Joe Biden, and other conservative members of the government put multiple “tough on  crime” amendments to the crime code into place that specifically targeted black and brown communities
How much do you want to pay for him to vote in person? Do you think Obama voted in person? Do you think Biden voted in person?
A vote for Biden is a vote fore Harris !
I meant to send you a tweet and forgot but it was essentially, “the only people less excited than conservatives for Biden’s selection are Kamala’s parents. ‘Vice President Kamala? Why couldn’t you be President Kamala?’”
You voted for Hillary over Trump, but won't vote Biden over Trump? Interesting thought process......
No, shes corrupted just like Dementia Joe Biden
huge portions of the 2020 Democratic platform are results of leftist activism. Biden’s climate change plan was literally written by the Sunrise Movement......Green New Deal? That’s because Biden was getting ATE UP by activists. That’s just one policy, a 2 trillion $ commitment
i think we should definitely critique biden and harris but the way y’all talking on here makes me think y’all want another four years of trump....
100% False! Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and the decent TRUE Patriot Americans are coming to take our Country back from the ugly,hateful, divisive people that are running it now. Bye bye Trump and the rest of you haters! #BidenHarris2020
Do you get the feeling she would actually be the acting president?  Another possibility is Biden's handlers &amp; Harris might conflict &amp; Harris would get shut out by them.

I was born yesterday but I stayed up all night. Even if you don’t like trump. Compared to Biden. He’s the best choice. But that’s not why I’m voting for   #BestPresidentEver45

Everytime I ask this question. I never get an answer. Or,  give me a policy or promise that Biden is running  on as the reason you’re voting for him....Crickets. If you’re voting for Biden because you hate Trump. That’s a dangerous recipe.
For this #LincolnVoter Biden doesn’t need to answer any questions, except to say yes to the Democratic nomination. Trump is a constant threat to our democracy. You can’t run the country from the golf course, and you can’t lie your way out of a pandemic.

If the left want #heelsupharris that bad, why didn't they pick her from the beginning? What the eff more does biden do for them? It's not like he brings any money in, the donations have increased a lot since naming her.
By Fr. James Martin saying Biden is Catholic because he was baptized Catholic is wrong. You don’t practice your faith or follow the teaching: you’re not on the team.
One of the interesting ways to look at your own country is how it's covered in international press. This is a completely unbiased report on the assault on the post office currently underway, and a clear and coherent response by Joe Biden and his campaign.

I have never ordered any type of yard sign ever - but my Biden/Harris one is on the way.   #BidenHarris2020
I can’t wait for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are President and Vice President so I can get back to just doing science. Lincoln had his team of rivals trump has his team of panic stricken cabinet members and senators who are afraid he will tweet them. Please totally Vote Blue.
Just a happy reminder
...ability to sit and do nothing. Sure, we must send a clear message to those in power, but we can’t during a pandemic. I agree with  I look forward to helping Biden and Harris win in 2020, and then I will fight to primary them in 2024. #BidenHarris2020
We live in IN and we are going to vote for Biden... I think people just need to go out and vote and see what's next

If you call yourself a Christian and you vote or support Biden/Harris.. go to church, read a Bible. Murdering babies is wrong
The Facebook app crashed when I was starting to read a thread of people saying that if you don't vote for Biden you're showing your privilege and the app won't open back up and I'd like to think that's divine intervention. I didn't need to read that you're right
If #BidenHarris2020 happens, Its going to be a continuation of the status quo and the disastrous neoliberal corporatist politics for at least 8 years. Think about that..  Nothing will fundamentally change. Not under Trump. Not under Biden.  #GeneralStrike
Oh and Biden and his people said moving the embassy to Jerusalem would make Arabs turn on Israel. Today shows different. My whole point is don't lie and push a narrative that trump is all encompassing bad and Biden is good. That's a lie
I was just told I didn't support black people because I won't vote for Joe Biden... 🤣😃🤣😃
Also speaking of corruption it would be nice if Biden would stop simping for China a country he does business in BTW
A lot of Americans also supported the Iraq war. Opinions change. For instance now Democrats including Biden side with BLM. So either call BLM out or acknowledge Biden supported a bill that in Democrats view today was racist.

When Obama/Biden slashed payroll taxes there wasn’t this energy about SS.  There are ways to protect SS.  Using payroll tax cuts as a way to say that SS is going away is insincere and ignorant.

I personally agree with you that both Biden and Trump are awful, but more Democratic primary voters voted for Biden than Sanders despite huge name recognition and insanely great fundraising, etc. I don't see any path for a third party candidate to win even two states.
Gee - do you think it had anything to do with  using Trumpian tactics in a debate to call into question Biden’s mental capacity? Stop whining.
No matter how things look, we know that, the same God that smashed a Hillary Clinton win, will also smash a Joe Biden win.   We just gotta vote, God will handle the fairness of the election.   God has people in the right places too!
They're going to keep passing the buck down the road at the expense of tens of millions of people so that it can all fall on the laps of Biden and a potentially Dem senate and Dem house in 2021. Just like in 2009.
Biden didn’t even pronounce it right!!!!
And corrupt Killary work have been a better choice? I’ll pose a question. Who are you voting for. If Biden? Why what promises or policies is he running on that you believe in?  BTW. I have a high school age kid. There’s no reason for the schools not to open. And sports played
the president of the united states admitted he's actively suppressing the vote on fox news today; if that's not fascism i really don't know what is. as much as i hate to say biden 2020, please vote for biden in november

Change Biden to Trump and Left to Right... and you got it!
Al his time, let Biden work on little ole Ohio, Florida and Texas.
I suppose there was nothing left to debate? I hope Biden puts up a better fight
And now, the right is crying that Biden will get cozy with China, destroying America (completely forgetting that this happened).
Did you actually thin Joe would make it to election day? Imagine the Bernie supporters if she ends up the head of the ticket. What does happen when polling goes south and Biden keeps losing his mind?
I almost let it rip a while ago til i realized Joe Biden was in the thread.  But then again I don't think he'd mind
Joe Biden because of a heartless illegal immigrant I went from living a good life driving tractor trailer to barely existing on $800 a month,you heard me right I was a truck driver making good money until a drunk immigrant slammed into my truck on purpose,&amp; now I exist on crums.
I'll vote Biden, just so he can be blamed for the shit show America will be in 2024. Once the left has been robbed again, I'll either be looking toward revolution or immigration, because I don't have the fucking energy to fight this dumb shit anymore.

Hillary said; “I want to help anyway I can.” That should be taken as a  threat to all mankind. Hillary helps no one but herself and the cost/price to partner with Hillary, Biden and Obama is Benghazi for all. They never was punished for that.

Biden has shown more signs of racism than Trump! Trumps words get misconstrued to make him look racist bc most Libs only read headlines rather than listening for themselves. Your news networks don’t show Joe’s blatant racist comments, which are clearly racist, in the headlines 🙄

Biden has been in agreement with the experts Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx.  The #StableGenius promoted a doctor that believes in Alien DNA/demon sperm and ignored the experts’ guidelines. He’s the only one to blame for 167K+ deaths and getting the US banned by 30+ countries.
Good luck then, I want trump cause kamala is shady and biden just has a terrible record for 40+ years.

What a stupid and baseless attack. But honestly, Biden could’ve chosen a garbage can to be his VP and the  would’ve been like, “Garbage Can wants to raise your taxes for absolutely no reason, defund the police and force a green new deal!”
It's pretty simple math. Every anti-Biden/DNC twitter post by  suggesting to NOT vote for Biden/Harris results in fewer votes for Biden, thus supporting the re-election of Trump. It's disgraceful.

Biden is going to lose .   Another 4 years of the trumphole.
I met up with  in Indianapolis today to talk about a little bit of everything. Hoosiers, here's what your US senator says about the Biden/Harris ticket, a coronavirus vaccine, a downtown protest under investigation and more:
Remember folks pointing out that Trump or Biden is going to be president is "simping." Jfc guys, can we get a little more nuanced.
NO! Vote for Biden! Don’t let 45 become 46!!!!! Educate yourself! Anything but a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump and MAGA country!!!!
Interesting you have: ❌No TV ads  ❌No briefings/tv town halls ❌No yard signs anywhere   And we are 2 months away from the election. Seems you’re relying on blind Democratic voting and expecting to ride the tails of Biden/Harris on top of the ticket. 🤷🏼‍♂️🤔

I’m sorry, joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the radical left? Well shit, I must be on fucking Pluto because they are not for the fucking people either.
My wife told me that yesterday, when she was at work at a dept. store, a black couple were shopping there and talking enthusiastically about Biden and Harris. They were encouraging their friends to vote. This is in deep red Greenwood, Indiana, folks!  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
I have seen zero evidence of dementia from Biden. It’s  Trump who has  clear cognitive decline — especially if you watch video from even four years ago. He can barely starting a coherent sentence together. how can any sane person think Biden is the one with health problems?
i very much agree with that, but i feel like its obvious to tell the mood of the country is swinging to the left, the young generation wants change. I think biden will at least allow that change to continue slowly, whereas trump wont allow shit, maybe won’t have elections in 2024
this is what I mean by people giving "opinions" that aren’t based in fact. Biden has move considerably left since becoming nominee because of pressure and tactical decisions by those on the left who decide to do the real work. Read here:

I’m so inspired by the choice of Kamala Harris as the VP on the ticket with Joe Biden! She is an excellent choice and a force to be reckoned with!!
Thinking about how the Biden campaign is actually promising a positive thing instead of a negative (a return to normal instead of just being anti-Trump) and how it’s probably going to win and lmao
some of the same people who talk about how Biden rigged the DNC but didn’t even go try and vote for Bernie. And they’re both underwhelming

Susan Rice was my prediction but I guess her being mired in that whole Obamagate mess would draw too much attention to the fact then-President Obama and Vice President Biden actively &amp; illegally plotted to undermine the legitimacy of the incoming administration.
Both Biden and Harris could eat alphabet soup and crap out something smarter than Trump
I still can't figure out Biden's Harris pick. Just on a purely nuts &amp; bolts strategic level, Biden already had California's electoral votes. What does Harris bring to the table--other than an even more unpleasant personality than Hillary's?
Lib Journos, especially  and  are too busy figuring out how to provide immense cover for Biden during the debates to cover the #Trump peace deal with UAE and Israel.
You should put Brutus’s dagger 🗡 &amp; the 25th A in her other hand as Opportunistic Kamala will get impatient if Biden takes too long to step down.
I don’t know how else to explain to Joe Biden that I don’t have $5 to donate.
Seeing the claims against President Trump by the Harris/Biden 😂 ticket are laughable.  The economy stuff, the pandemic stuff, not addressing the riots or looting.  It’s all laughable.  Her Ebola comparison yesterday included 🙄😂🤦‍♂️ Lol  Just stop.
Think it’s just a me issue. lol  It was more starting the day seeing nothing but DT/Biden trending heavily and then literally under sports categories I see a new tweet by Pat and...more politics.  Just hit me all pre-coffee and wrong

Just like "Weekend at Bernies", they will wheel Biden around on a two wheeler from event to event and tell him what to do.
Just as coverage of Biden and Harris on the campaign trail was going to start, suddenly Trump breaks in with “breaking news” that Palestine and Israel met a peace agreement. Since when has he even been working on that? He’ll do anything to block their coverage!
Deep thoughts ...with Joe Biden.
Being soulless how would you know, Joe.  When you spoke on stage with your VP running mate, you welcomed her family to be part of the Biden family.   Any chance you'll ever welcome to the Biden family the granddaughter whose actual existence you refuse to acknowledge? Doubtful.
You sir, are contributing to a campaign of voter fraud and election rigging. Using Putin talking points and phony charges against Joe Biden.
Had you been accused, vilified, your family attacked, prounouced guilty w/o due process you would be angry too &amp; don’t tweet you wouldn’t bc you would.   Biden’s vp pick Capriciously Opportunistc Kamala was quick to side with the women who accused Biden. Retraction coming soon?
Antifa dot com lead you to a biden fundraiser until it went down due to it going viral on twitter
Biden and Harris are not the radical left. Not at all.
Says the party with Biden at the top of the ticket....
Yes because Republicans are known for rioting in the streets who can forget all the stuff they destroyed after Obama was elected...on the other hand if Biden doesn’t win we know what the resistance is going to do
Difference is republican voters won’t riot  loot &amp; assault police officers like the Democrats will if Biden doesn’t win
Kamala Harris who said of Biden's accusers in April 2019: “I believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it.” Does she still believe Reade's allegations?
To imply she's against immigrants is pretty shitty considering.....her parents. She will definitely back M4A if it passed Congress. I believe in her ability to help us push Biden left.
Bruuuuuuuuuh lmao roastin Biden I’m weak
Ok its August and campaigning hasn't begun and Biden has been allowed to hide for 4 months. That's over I gurantee he screws it up. In the last week alone he pissed of black voters twice. And he only did 2 interviews
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‘should be a great concern to all Christians’  #FoxNews
No one is blaming trump for Seattle defunding cops. No one is blaming trump for Chicago murders either. They are blaming Democrats. All Democrats had to do was run shit normally and I'd agree the election was theirs they didn't so it isn't. Plus Biden is awful
I feel like Biden is our only chance for yang to be involved. Hoping Biden understands yang needs to be in his cabinet
It is and besides Biden is going to have to campaign or he definitely loses. And plus you have flying murder rates and riots daily. Trump wins.

During a pandemic that's coming to an end while campaigning against an idiot who's been able to hide. Once Biden is forced onto the campaign trail I gurantee that changes. The man is as bad as trump when talking
People don't like him. They'll still vote for him I promise. I don't like trump but I accepted he was going to win after the Democrats picked Biden.
i’ve also heard “lol biden has dementia you can’t have a president w dementia” ok well trump is a narcissistic sociopath who also has extreme medical and mental illnesses but i don’t hear y’all talking about that
I’m really having trouble understanding their whole “you can’t criticize Biden” thing. Can’t I prefer him be president while still recognizing what a corrupt piece of shit he is?
i’ve noticed a lot people people i know who voted trump said he was the lesser of two evils as they didn’t like either option. well guess what, don’t be pissed when we all vote biden now bc he’s the FAR lesser of two evils.
Some preemptive  &amp;  fact checking:  "Most pro-abortion ticket ever" Biden is a devout Catholic.  "Most anti-Israel ticket ever" Harris is married to a Jewish attorney. Her stepkids call her "Momala," a play on her name &amp; the Yiddish “Mamaleh,” which means little mama.
She wasn’t wishing him dead or any ill will.  She was expressing what we all know-Biden has dementia.  The Democrat/Socialist Party knows that.  They are playing a game to hold onto power and they will use Biden or their own mothers to get it.  Evil.
Biden attends church regularly.  Trump had peaceful protestors teargassed so that he could use a bible as a prop outside of a church for a photo op.

Every 80 seconds someone in America is dying from Covid . You are lazy and incompetent.  Obama and Biden had two people die from Ebola. You killed over 160 000.
Oh, so Trump’s train uses fossil fuels and just blows past the town spraying everyone with smoke. Biden is eco-friendly and you know will stop to talk to residents.
So, Herman Cain is tweeting out editorials against Biden and Harris this morning. You know, the guy who died two weeks ago, because of Trump.   Every time I want to say something is peak 2020, they raise the mountaintop on me.
Hey  Jeanine pirro warns "something's going to happen before the election, and he’s not even going to be on the ticket." Referring to Joe Biden. What does she know? Is he in danger? Was she making a threat? This must be investigated
Yes they are...and Biden isn’t.
If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America
Very unsafe speed for a train in a populated area! Biden responsible as always CC:
I'm voting for Biden/Harris Only because I believe Trump is worse for Black ppl and America.  I've lost neighbors, and a lot of my friends have lost family to Covid-19...a largely preventable situation had the Trump administration been prepared AND acted to protect us.
I will be unemployed if Biden wins. Which will trickle down to you eventually.
Except......it appears Trump voters are more likely to vote for West than are Biden voters. Biden voters don't tolerate clowns very well.....think orange.
And lest we forget, Biden armed Ukrainian Nazis
The only thing these masks are keeping away is Joe Biden from smelling women and little girls.

It’s a bad ticket. Really bad. Just weeks ago she called Biden a racist and said she believed his sexual assault accuser.   This tells the American people that she will flip her policies on a moments notice. Oh, and  destroyed her.
Sincerely, is this all the crowd? Well after all, it’s the Biden/Harris ticket.....
Stop drooling over Status Quo Joe Biden, he ain’t no Saint! But he’s all we’ve been given)...#MorningJoe
Let’s be honest, the DNC chose you because they knew Biden was going to lose. They needed to pick someone whose seat would go to a Democrat without fear of a Republican taking the seat. You are the sacrifice. 😆
The former Republican presidential candidate's daughter said she and others on the website's editorial team would be continuing Cain's legacy by sharing the information and ideals he believed in.
So.... Biden is physically fit?
My dad thinks Biden will commit suicide so the Democrats can set up Harris to be president. WTF!?
I live in Indiana. Polls show Trump beating Biden by more than ten points here. A vote for Biden is also a vote for Trump if the electoral college goes that way for him in this state.   I fought as hard as I could for Bernie here but I'm not volunteering for Biden.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden announced Wednesday evening that his campaign has raised $26 million in the 24 hours since he named Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.  #Daybreak8
I've had a big smile on my face all day. I didn't think I would be THAT moved by her joining the ticket.   Biden and Kamala have great chemistry together already whereas running mates usually need time to warm to and feel comfortable with each other.

I think Republicans are banking on kids being dumb enough to vote for Kanye this year. But honestly his political beliefs are way more right sounding than liberal leaning. I’d be afraid he takes from the Tr*mp base more than Biden’s
I can’t imagine what your life is going to be like when Biden loses- we all see your tweets- you’re already flipping out because Biden is already tanking.  It’s so bad- you have to copy/paste responses. Please don’t shoot up a school.  Call the number.
I think it's the result of a fiery speech Biden made during a campaign stop at the Corn Palace that not only put the state in play but put it firmly in his camp.
Clinton had a 96% chance so I'm not holding my breath. I think if Democrats don't clamp down on the riots in their cities a lot of people who don't want to vote for trump will. Biden and Harris both have a lot of dirt in their past that will come back up
Fuck biden
Why would you run a train-themed ad against JOE "THE GODDAMN AMTRAK STATION IN WILMINGTON IS NAMED AFTER ME BECAUSE I RODE IT SO GODDAMN MUCH" BIDEN.
America was truly united by the 2023 State of the Union where President Biden proposed his War on Malarkey, giving him a stunning mandate for his second term to continue carrying it out.
Again- read the thread- I’m not a trump support- but obviously you find Biden’s demeanor just fine.  You must like kids rubbing your legs too.
Do you still believe Joe Biden’s accusers? 🤷‍♂️
We have a republic and soros and Biden want a democracy.
You obviously haven’t filled Biden through the years. He’s known for racism
She didn't call him a racist though.   She even said to him "I do not believe you are a racist."  She did criticize his record on race relations, but by picking her it seems to indicate some growth on his part.
Tucker just showed that on Aug. 12, 2020 (yesterday), Biden from the podium mispronounced Kamala Harris’ first name IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY!  Was that intentional, Kirsten?  Have more important matters to actually discuss regarding our country right now?  Good grief lady.

It took two people to write this joke of a column? You honestly expect us to believe Joe Biden picked his VP. He doesn’t even know what office he’s running for.

Trump will not vacate or acknowledge Biden as the President.  We need to prepare for this.  I am so scared that Trump is going to turn OUR country into a dictatorship, his followers could be preparing to commit violence if Trump doesn't win.  We need to prepare, not just vote.

Kamala was my first choice a year ago and she still is. I'll let others be Anti-Trump. I will be positive and support Biden-Harris.
I think Black celebrities showing love &amp; support to Sen. Harris is fueling a narrative that she is OUR co-leader. When in reality, Biden chose her to project a Black (false) sense of uprising and hope. Especially now. But it’s just too ironic. I’ve done research. This is scary.
Buttigieg has a place in a Biden/Harris administration. It’s gonna be awesome. But Russian bots in conjunction with 4chan, QAnon, and butthurt Bernie Bros are gonna be pushing the “Biden and Harris are racist cops” narratives hard to try to discourage as many from voting as psbl.

She is not an American born citizen so she is not qualified to be Vice President, as she cannot assume the duties of President if Biden steps down. Speaker of the House becomes President. They are gambling that it will be Pelosi?

Kamala really said this? And there are people who will vote for her and Biden? Not thinking long term, are they!
I didn’t watch. Did Biden actually give coherent answers to questions?
yep, he put positive covid patients in long term facilities...no, that was Cuomo. Bounties? Is this the new Russian hoax? Only labeled racist once he ran as GOP. Before that, he was rubbing elbows with all the left loons. The 1% that can't pass the test must be Biden. Trump 2020
I also believe the accusers Kamala believes: the women who each claimed he invaded their personal space but did not take it as sexual harassment. Biden apologized to each.

Biden and Kamala both are missing one important thing that they both need to be President. They must know how to lead and stand for something. Both lack this. They both follow. Neither can lead on anything. Trump leads, a born leader.

I'd like most people chances against Biden and Trump in a debate
Donna. I agree with you. I’m sure you know you have some haters and trolls on this feed. Keep up the good work. Go Biden\Harris.
If the president were drunk, it would be an upgrade.  He just saw his fate after watching  accept Biden's offer.
Well, well, well.
Those words r perfect for Joe's running mate..remember she's the one who called him a racist..how do u deal with that nasty n shrill statement out of Kamala's own mouth!! ..on live TV..Biden is a stepping stone for her..it will be great fun 2 watch these 2 kiss butt to all

#ErinBurnett #CNN you are a lady's lady,&amp; your absolutely as pretty as they come.I would love to speak my honorable truth as it pertains to Joe Biden the pervert liar,but I refuse to disrespect your name by using his in the same tweet.
I wonder if she sold her booty to Biden also. Probably the reason he picked her.
So I watched Biden and Harris speak. I don’t know which I did more. Laugh or roll my eyes.  So they Blame EVERYTHING NEGATIVE ON TRUMP. That’s normal. What’s funny. It’s all because of Democrats.not going back to school, loss of jobs, shutting down the country, 6 trillion. 😄

I live in Indiana, Biden is not going to win in my state.
I had to turn it off after three minutes. Joe Biden is a liar and a fraud! Kamala is no better, sending all those folks to jail while she sits there having the luxury to talk about smoking (and inhaling)! #DrainTheSwamp
I have 3 friends who had been waiting to make any donation to Biden. All 3 made substantial donations yesterday to honor Kamala being chosen for VP.
And only said that she slammed Biden, how could he pick her?, over and over and over again.  He’s got brainwashing magats down to a single presser.
Make no mistake, she and Biden will do far worse than Trump. 2A will never be the same after their first 100 day agenda and 4 SCOTUS picks in the next term. #gunvote
Here’s where it took us... it’s now gone.  Will anyone ask basement Biden?
reminiscent of 2016,  you and Mika were touting every poll until 270 electorals were rung up and even then remember? You never thought she’d lose! How can you even think Biden can run this country? He can’t rub two thoughts together without catching them on fire.
Trumps pissed at China cause they are backing biden
Great! Now people are going to write in Stephen A! This obviously hurts Biden’s chances! The horror
Do we know that Warren even wants a cabinet position? As for "deserving" a cabinet position I would put Amy K and Pete B at the front of that line. Their decision to end their campaigns before Super T was the most consequential candidate contribution to Biden's win, IMO.
You think u were the only gal that was bused??? Joe Biden will never speak again cause she will never shut-up talking about herself...VOTE TRUMP&gt;&gt;&gt;Kamala and Biden will hit you r taxes severely...n that is just one thing
Hilarious..she put 1500 people in jail over marijuana. Kamala called Biden a racist while in the first debate..how do u change ur thinking on that?? She is a NO..she will be a green deal person with AOL..n take r personal insurance away..ur guns..say Hell no for her in anything!!
No he walks off after a number of stupid questions. There is a difference. Have you seen Biden take any questions after a press conference? He can read, he cannot answer w/o a script probably.
the fact that biden didn't choose obama to be his VP is two thumbs down from me
WATCH LIVE: Biden and Harris make 1st appearance as running mates in Delaware

Vote Biden/Harris if you're in a competitive/swing state otherwise it doesn't fucking matter and protect yourself because it's still a goddamn pandemic out there.
If you google  it will take you to Biden / Harris website.                 That says it all.
I need some analysis on if the right's "Joe Biden's America will be the worst part of Trump's America but more" message is actually landing or just reminding people how God awful Trump is/has been

The news keeps saying “rollout” re Biden Harris and I just keep laughing because Schitt’s Creek.
Trump has Biden/Harris on his mind.  He is worse than ever with incoherent ramblings!
Thanks kindly President elect Biden and Vice President elect Kamala Harris! I am so excited about new things happening.
capitalism disguised in leftist identity politics has convinced democrats that the best we can do, and what we deserve, are destructive politicians like biden, harris, etc. and that those whose demand more are delusional and ungrateful
And Trump is on now babbling and losing his train of thought more than ever!  You can tell he is bothered by something.  Guessing Biden/Harris is on his mind.
Describing the Biden/Harris ticket as “liberal anarchy” and “radical” is plainly untrue. It’s the statement of someone who has chosen party over constituency. You were elected to represent all Hoosiers — not just Republicans. It’s awful that you would rather divide than unite.
Did Joe Biden Kill the Quds Force Commander?   Asking for a friend?
Since Joe Biden finally left his house, can we have a debate between Biden and Trump?

Your “savior”.  Lol
The Biden/Harris speeches were live on all channels in Indy. Frumpy’s pressers never are. The tide is changing.
It's hard for me make the choice to support Biden (I live in IN so it won't come to that), on one hand a vote for Biden is a vote for continuing Bush-Obama polices and possibly lead us to a worse Trump. Or Trump wins, which keeps Dems fighting and we reset in 4 yrs.
You are predicting "something horrible" will happen to Joe Biden in the next two months? You should be investigated by the . and soon. What a vulture.

Great... Now Biden can sniff and kiss all the underage children in attendance.
Never trust anything a politician says when they're campaigning to be president. It's all lies. Check the record. She and Biden have been conservatives their entire careers.
I’d would trust Biden to be president of my HOA much less of the USA.Where did you find that Biden got Hunter job in Burisma? Complete speculation, not a single reliable (and even unreliable) source said it.
First, Shokhin became Prosecutor General (like AG in the US) in 2015 (not 2005), second, have you ever seen enybody to brag to the whole world that he committed a crime? No. Because Biden forced Poroshenko to fire Shokhin who was a CRIMINAL.
.. shouldn’t have been anywhere near all those firms (I am sure Burisma was not very pure either) but it has nothing to do with Joe Biden’s actions.
No, trump extorted Zelensky for personal gain using the fact that Ukraine needed weapons to fight Russia. Biden wanted to oust Shokhin to make sure western loan won’t get to criminals’ pockets - he acted on behalf of the US, EU, and WB. I agree, Hunter or any fam member 1/
...”No credits until this guy is AG.” Poroshenko at first resisted (o am sure he got a slice from extortion), them Obama sent Biden to Kyiv and Biden Gabe an ultimatum. Shokhin had to leave. Ukraine got its loan. Now, think logically - why would Biden tell everyone on TV /4
Hmmmm...Over $2 billion? That’s how much they wasted on Hillary, right, $2 billion? I’m thinking they’re going to have to spend way more on ads than they did in 2016 because they have to limit how much time they keep Biden in the spotlight.
Just listening to Joe Biden TV add, everything he says in this commercial Donald Trump is and has already doing or it’s done! What is wrong with thi idiot?
This tells the real truth about Biden &amp; Harris!
Cause they are in the Tank for Biden
I didn’t know  had more characters he played for his shows! Granny Petrol—the spiritualist guy, what’s his name? Shim Sham? Oh God, I am DEAD! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 All his vote-for-Joe-Biden platitudes, too! Oh my God! 💀

What do some of my non voting followers think about Angela Davis saying to vote fir Kamala/Biden? This isn't shady, I'd like real answers
O don’t think it will be smart of him to endorse Biden. He can and should criticize trump, it gives him a good standing in the future (hopefully renewed and detrumpifird GOP); endorsement of Biden first, will be insincere and second, will hurt his chances in the future.,
Give Biden a break when you’re describing him this way. He’s been racist for years, and won’t change. And his deterioration, happens to people his age. I just wish his family would intercede or protect him from being used like this....
What I was like to know when Harris and Biden walk out on the stage for their address to the American people with their mask on, why aren’t they 6 foot apart or did Biden sniff Harris and assume she’s virus clean?
I'm confused...how does a Jamaican father and an Indian mother make an African American child??? And just remember what Biden said!
Biden is not a leader and never really has been his entire career.  The guy is a consensus-seeker, and he is happiest when he thinks everybody got something they want.  Maybe admirable if there were two sane sides, but we're dealing with a malevolent evil right now.
Biden you are a pervert!
Can’t wait for Biden to kick all these bottom-feeders out of the briefing room and then have a bunch of shithogs like Jake Tapper and Chuck Todd to go to the barricades for them

Yes Biden and Harris take this!🖕👆
Your done Biden!
Joe Biden you are a pervert!
We need another candidate.  Biden chose the wrong VP pick.  And Trump's not good anymore.
It feels like Biden is resigning before he’s even been elected🤔
Let me tell you this: Science is proving that Trump was right all along. It’s a shame you guys hate Trump so much, and are so desperate for power..that you’d put your Party over the success and well-being of Americans and the USA. Biden is only gonna do what Trump’s already doing
Well your businessman mentality is really funny! If anything they are more moderate than left. Biden has always been , his voting record reflects that. Harris never been a leftist, again a moderate Democrat. But hey go with the Trump talking points, shows you'll tote that line!
Basically, Biden won’t be the President if elected. 😬
Harris is Eloquent. Something Biden campaign needs.
I'm a white guy dont lump me into that group.  Biden/Harris 2020
I did not expect a ringing endorsement of Senator Harris from you, but hey, I’ll take it. Welcome to Team Biden, John. I assume you’ll also be joining the Lincoln Project?
They almost look....married. Deep State pick: Kamala If you think Obama was bad, this Commie will burn down this country with Executive Orders, Martial Law, and whatever comes in to her power-hungry lawyer mind. (She will inherit the Biden win...wind. )
Oh, but I do. Many people can’t risk staying at home and not voting because their socioeconomic status may depend on Biden and Kamala winning. It’s going to be a rough wake up call when you goofs learn that every politician isn’t squeaky clean.
Joe Biden and Kim kardashian huh what a combo lol
"she’ll help Biden run out the clock — and that’s exactly what he needs to do."  Which clock? His? Tiktok.
Dude you’re clueless. Nobody is bashing Biden for his pronunciation. They’re all laughing at the hypocrisy of the Left, because they jumped Tucker’s ass last night for “saying her name wrong”...and then Biden said it the same way.

Donald Trump is doing a great job campaigning for Joe Biden at his own presser.
Someone please explain how that makes any sense. Trump ordered attacks on multiple terrorists and took out some very bad people. Biden is spouting lies and nonsense.
We have put ourselves in a situation where people are legimately having a dilemma on whether to vote Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris. It’s not rocket science who is the better option. You are allowed to be mad but you cannot sit there and act like both are equally terrible.
Wow! Went to Biden political sight!
Cavuto is as bad as Biden and Harris they are all three just alike, idiots!
Lol....There’s like 50-60 people there. If Trump was coming, that entire lawn in the back would be packed with people...and all the roads would be lined with people cheering and flags waving.  Ooh...feel the energy of the Harris/Biden ticket...
.  has done more for the average American in 3 years than Biden has done in his whole 40+ year career.
joe biden really out here denying america's immanence with this speach. this is bad faith.
Some of y'all gotta toxic relationship w/ electoral politics. You swear up and down that the presidency is corrupt and then go apeshit every time power predictably gets consolidated. Who did you think Joe Biden was going to pick? The ghost of Joseph Stalin?
Biden should commit to putting Katie Porter in his cabinet today. I don't even care where, she's the best elected official we have
Kamala Harris wants to: 1. Take away your guns by Executive Order.  2. Raise taxes by 70% 3. Get rid of Private Insurance   Joe Biden has said: 1. He cannot ban guns by executive order.  2. Latinos are more diverse than African-Americans.  This will end well.
I think the broad popular view is Medicare for all who want it, which Biden does support luckily. He wants a public option that competes with private.
- This is Biden's platform   - This is Trump's platform  Read through these websites, pick your favorite causes and see how each of them address it. Then tell me Biden won't be the best chance for a progressive future THIS ELECTION.
Love You and the show Dana, but Donna Brazile needs to be gone from Fox. She is a proven cheater and liar and Fox should have never hired her. Well, since she’s there, ask her how she intends to cheat and lie for Biden As she did for Hillary.
It’s takes like 4 years for a president to undo what the one before him did. We vote Biden in. Nothing is going to change in the next 4 years lol
But she said Biden was Racist...
We get it. Kamala was a cop. She did some extremely shady things that targeted certain demographics. Biden was for the Iraq War and other things regarding warfare in the Middle East. You should hold her and Biden accountable 100%.
Liberals and conservatives are in for a wake up call when they learn that nearly everyone in office has voted for and done shitty/terrible things. Sure, Kamala and Biden aren’t the greatest, and are even unappealing, but they are absolutely the better ticket this election.
Many don’t get the meaning of probability of winning and I hope this new graphic gets the point across. This means from an urn of 10 balls to draw, 3 of them are winning balls for Trump (not that his polls are 3:7 against Biden). That’s not too steep a slope.
Column: Biden picks Kamala Harris. Trump should dump Mike Pence and replace him with a yacht.
Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to mask his abuse of women and minorities i.e. sexist and racist virtue signaling.
THIS!!!!! Hi I guess I’m back on my political soapbox for the next 3 or so months. Please don’t abstain from voting and please don’t vote third party. Please don’t vote Bernie. Bernie’s great! But not voting for Biden/Harris in any way is voting for Trump. Period.
Your options are Biden or trump. Third party candidates will not win. With or without your vote, there will be a Biden or trump presidency. Abstaining from voting or voting third party = a 2nd term. Look in the mirror and check your privilege. Thanks.
Can hardly wait for this to play out:
88% support Medicare for All. Biden says he would veto it.
Personally I think if by chance Biden would win , he would suffer one of those clinton suicides leaving harris to be directed by "The New World Order" billionaires.
That's why Pelosi endorsed all the members of the Squad and Biden worked closely with Bernie on policy issues...
Serious question: what are the odds on Trump awarding himself the Presidential Medal of Freedom before Biden is inaugurated just so he can say he has one too?   I'm saying 50/50
I mean, first off Biden never officially said he would only pick a black woman, but he said "a woman". Also, I see no issues with bringing a historically oppressed and underrepresented group to the office of VP. Seems like a step forward
If Biden hasn't made a sufficient trajectory shift on US emissions, then SOMEBODY better primary the crap out of him or Harris (assuming she also does not support policies sufficient to the task). We can measure this stuff and know if we're on track or not.
Joe Biden didn’t have a Vice President yet either.
Joe Biden made a terrible decision with horrible Harris.
Man if ya'll wanna vote for Biden/Kamala then do that. If you don't, then don't. But shaming people for not doing what you're doing isn't the wave, no matter the situation in my opinion
wow yeah super not thrilled with the vp pick. they’re really making it harder and harder for progressives/leftists to give them their vote. unfortunately Biden-Harris is still the lesser of two evils. i’m settling nov. 3rd and i hope y’all are too
I said from the beginning when Biden became the frontrunner that Kamala would be an awesome choice for VP. So excited for this election. Can't wait to see who Biden picks for his cabinet, sec of state, etc. This feeling of hope is amazing!
I'm not the biggest Kamala Harris fan, but this is a legitimately good position to hold and one that I hope she still holds and pushes for (despite the lack of pro-prosecution statements I've seen in Biden's climate policy)
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
After what Black people collectively have been through this year, I'm going to unapologetically relish that Sen. Kamala Harris, a Black &amp; South Asian woman, is on a major U.S. party ticket! There will be enough time to hold Biden-Harris accountable to the people. We can do both!
Biden picked Harris.....
Let’s DO THIS...Team Biden/Harris for the WIN!!!  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
While the whole Biden is late to picking a VP thing was clearly just faulty memories.  A running mate being selected and Nate still dithering on the 538 model is truly unique to this election cycle.
Interesting EP of  :   1) prediction about Airbnb IPO being shelved was squashed   2)  prediction about Kamala being Biden's running mate was spot on ( the news came out 15 mins after finished listening lol)   Also,  rocks.
Biden was still the least progressive of all the people in the primary...lol
Biden will be in her pants the first time they are alone, just like Bill Clinton was with Monica Lewinsky!

Yeah I don’t mean to insinuate that Harris isn’t a great choice. 😀  I’m still ridin’ with Biden.
Support the Biden/Harris ticket or giddey up outta my way 🐴
Looks like Kamala Harris is Biden’s VP pick. Get ready to vote #Trump!
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.
Uh akshually Joe Biden was sitting VP in 2012.
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate
I was hoping that Biden would choose Harris #goodpickJoe
I am terribly sad to note that I am not Joe Biden's pick for VP.  Admittedly, I am not female nor do I have any political experience, but I'm still saddened by the slight.  I'll still vote for him, but with a sigh.

The real question is: if "haunting his dreams" doesn't do anything to change concrete decisions made by a Biden admin, what's the next step Chomsky would recommend? Many of his proposals so far have been better than expected but for now they're just that--proposals.

Biden is weak mentally and physically. Biden had to drop out of a past presidential race for lying and plagiarizing.  Biden has been in office for 40+ years and has done nothing about “systemic” racism.  Clearly you’re thinking of the wrong candidate 🤔 #Trump2020
It’s so that when Biden makes one gaff or garbles his words, everyone will be primed for it and jump on it. As always, Trump will be graded on a curve.
There is physical evidence that joe Biden sniffs little girls’ hair
And then by that logic every Democrat Senator is working with China and Iran to help joe Biden win 😐

Cool. Now do the criminal story line on Obama, Biden, the Clinton’s, pedophile Hollywood actors, Leftist, Dem-supported Antifa, etc. It’ll be 10x more “delicious”....
It is pretty shocking that democratic primary voters thought the candidate who literally offered only negative policies (ie I’m not Trump) would somehow be able to appeal to a wider electorate who aren’t nearly as concerned about Trump...if Biden wins it’ll be COVID’s doing.
The only plan the dems have, threaten us with coronavirus.  I'm still not voting for Biden.
Or they have a Case File Opened against Biden in Ukraine. He is being investigated. Could be charged. He's just as guilty. Also read the Mueller report. Says nothing about Trump being involved. He would have been charged. He wasn't.
Biden is a Ukrainian Puppet and has a Ponzi Scheme going there. He actually has a warrant out for his arrest
Give me a better source than that. I have evidence Biden is in bed with Ukraine

You don't see a crowded church there- I am sure that Secret Service nor Jill Biden would allow that
Joe Biden is and says he is a Catholic, the things he says and the things he is for are all against Catholic Religion! Abortion and hatred of the American people and the Republican Party and the President of the United States of America!🦅🇺🇸
None of the plans put forth by Biden (taken from Bernie and AOC) will solve any of the challenges of climate change.  Joe Biden is not the solution to the problems he helped create.
Trump said, if I am re-elected, I will forgive payroll taxes. Like a forgivable loan! What is Biden going to say during a debate? No, I will not forgive it, force everyone to pay the back-taxes with penalties and interest?
God, I wish Biden was controlled by the Bernie Sanders wing of the party. You’d have to know nothing about politics to think that 😂
You’re nuttier than a Payday.  How has Trump done “anything” to social security?  Biden already said “I’m going raise your taxes”.  Evidently you don’t work or care about those that do
Just putting this out here so I can tell everyone I told you so.  Biden's VP is going to be Valerie Jarrett.
I actually don’t give a shit who Biden picks for VP and neither should you! It makes absolutely no difference to the average American! becuase regardless of who it is, it will be more of the same... He can pick Santa Clause for all I care, it won’t make one bit of difference!
Welp. This just might win the election for Biden.
These regrettable remarks are part of Biden's long history of racially tinged comments, such as his quip that you can't go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have an Indian accent or that any African Americans who don't support him aren't black.
Our non-scientific poll gives Trump a 33-7 yard sign margin over Biden in the key areas of northern Michigan and Wisconsin. We did not see any of the fabled Trump Boaters. Enthusiasm seems mixed.
We really must elect Biden
Biden should make the actual VP announcement while riding a bicycle. Every news org would be forced to play that clip, and it would show him to be fit and healthy.
Biden:  Build Back Better?  That is what you are going with?  Are you sure? Do you want to call a friend?
There appears to be zero urgency to do anything about it because everyone thinks Biden is way ahead.  I can't put my finger on it but this all feels very familiar.
Biden you can’t even read! You can’t leave your granddaughter and innocent kids alone long enjoy!
Obama brought more than "Hope". Obama created "Example" that we hold onto.  will set some things straight for us, clean up mess made by current admin, and be exemplary in "caregiving". Doesn't sound like much but a massive undertaking. Jill Biden is going to surprise us!
I think Biden needs to have a black VP running mate. #BLM
Whoever runs with Biden will be running the country.
It matters when Joe Biden is on a steepening mental decline.
Let's use McCabe's logic.  has repeatedly said that "China is not a problem." Also, he and his party, will not condemn the Chinese gov for not deterring the spread of Covid. THUS, using McCabe's logic, Biden must be a Chinese asset and we need a full  investigation.
Joe Biden is Supposedly Catholic But He Hasn’t Condemned Arson and Vandalism of Catholic Churches and he believes in abortion!
Hopefully, very few Biden supporters watch or buy their stuff. Also, something tells me that those who will vote for W were not planning to vote for Biden. I haven’t yet seen serious analysis of the “Kanye voter.”
These are Joe Biden’s followers!
Biden you’re an idiot! And a pervert!
Biden is a idiot!
Disingenuous. Whoever  picks as VP will most likely become President if Biden is unable to serve a full term. That’s why Biden will surely not pick a progressive as VP. Just another corporate shill to maintain the status quo.
I'm at the point where settling for Biden makes some sense. I mean, he's a war hawk who supports border camps and the war on drugs, but maybe doctors won't be able to discriminate against trans people.If Mr. Knight does not support Biden and Trump wins, there will never be a chance to bring us back from the brink.  There will not be a future where you can elect somebody you like better because trump will set himself up as president for life.
so... it was a debate and now I'm the VP candidate, it doesn't matter?  C'mon man (in Biden's voice)

If you “don’t know any of Biden’s policies” then that is a product of your own ignorance. It takes five seconds to look up DIRECT policy stances. Don’t demand change and then refuse to give any effort in researching those who can make it happen.
Read the responses to this tweet to find multiple people list a number of Biden’s policies while ignorant individuals (such as the author of the original tweet) try to use every logical fallacy to argue against them.

Well if I’m choosing between two allegedly racist, demented, nepotist, pedophiles, I’m 100% choosing the one who has far fewer credible offenses in every one of those categories, and that’s Biden.
Super cool cherry-picked, sourceless screenshot just to make Biden look like more of a racist idiot than the man currently in office.  Good try.
I'm voting for Biden simply to buy you guys (and myself) less resistance, less violence, and a higher likelihood of success in the near future. If that makes me not a leftist in your eyes, that's fine. And I also won't tell you you're not a leftist for not voting for Biden
Charlie is gonna keep cranking out these weak ass attempts to shed blame on the Biden campaign until well after the election
While his is not a radical disability platform (&amp; he is not my preferred candidate), it’s important that Biden reached out to disabled folks. I want a revolutionary platform, “But evolution is good, and in disability policy, it’s often a lot slower and unimpressive as this.”
Exactly. That's what it feels like those of Vaush's ilk are doing: shitting on people and saying they are not leftists simply because they don't understand "the political game" or don't understand why voting for Biden is a good strategic choice. As a result, alienating them.
You don’t have to be crazy for Biden to know trump is a power crazed loon.  Vote for Biden.
This this this this this do NOT for a SINGLE SECOND think that your contribution to our movement is going to start and stop with voting Biden in November. It is the smartest choice strategically, but you can't justify it if you aren't going to fucking follow up.
So what? The general populace thinks Biden is far-left. That might be cringe to us, but if he wins, it will show everybody that the left is viable and it's what the ppl want. So what will you do with that? How will you take advantage of that power surge, regardless how misguided?
This Biden discourse is fucking tiring, guys. It is unquestionable that, compared to a trump re-election, Biden will be less harmful in the short term, and a lot of the pressure on our protests will ease off. Focus more on what we are going to do during that time.
Cancel me, say I'm not a real socialist or lefty if you want, but I genuinely want us to get more time, a little less resistance, no matter how small, so we can take this movement farther. If that means you cancel me, leave me behind, and protest Biden in 2021 even harder,
Now, for those that follow me that very much don't agree and don't want to vote for Biden, do it. More power to you, my dude. And if you are a rape victim, by all means don't vote for him. That is perfectly reasonable. I will not shame you as Vaush did or say you're not a leftist
Look, I'm not gonna pretend. Biden is absolute garbage. Harris is absolute garbage. They're both neoliberals, and neoliberals enable fascism. Capitalism enables fascism. However, in this election, voting them in, to me, is the best option to buy us more time.
It is perfectly, perfectly valid to say letting Trump win will validate that fascism works. However, if you are telling victims of rape they have to vote for Biden regardless of how much it hurts them or retraumatizes them, you are a piece of shit.
breaking down exactly why voting for Biden will work, how this "game" you are entailing works, etc. The only sole video entirely dedicated to this topic you have (afaik) is that last one. I think it would really help your point instead of just pushing more ppl away.
I think instead of making the people who really really really don't want to vote for Biden angry by calling them grifters and assuming they know how to play "the game" I think it would be really cool and really helpful to make a full video
While I very much don't agree with Vaush's characterization of the people I follow who don't have the privilege to stomach a Biden/Harris ticket as grifters, he was right about not voting at all. If you don't vote, they will continue catering to boomers.
While I won't tell anyone either way to vote for Biden or vote down ballot, there is absolutely no excuse to not vote at all imo. Like, shit, at least vote Green party so maybe they get some funding. Not voting completely throws any potential out the window
So, Biden picking a cop as his running mate was pretty much the death sentence huh? Lol maybe THIS year we vote libertarian? Like all of us?
Even if Biden wins, I don't think I'll ever truly be happy until Trump is either in prison or dead.
I mean if you are a fan of George W. Bush, Colin Powell, and Mitt Romney, the Biden/Harris ticket is a perfect fit for you.
🇺🇸YOUR NEXT VICE-PRESIDENT: Sen. Kamala Harris! Making history, making women everywhere proud, making us ALL stand taller. An inspiration to WOC! I’m beyond excited about Joe Biden’s pick and am aligned with her as we take on the Pence Bros! #LakeVsPence #BidenHarris2020
Don't forget Biden !
Biden Selected, Not Elected - Look For The Dirtiest Election In US History  via  send in the clown!
Same! I've been pushing the opinions I have because people literally shit on leftists every day when they say they're not voting for Biden. We are not super relevant unfortunately and most people are liberals
For as much as Vaush says he's into left unity and not alienating people with different beliefs than you he sure is quick to call leftists with legitimate concerns about a Biden/Harris presidency grifters
I literally had to try super hard to find any sort of videos on his position for this election and he's just going off saying people are dumb fucks instead of going in depth on why voting for Biden is going to work. Don't just assume people know how "the political game"
Vaush realizes that what he is saying isnt helping anybody and will probably make most lefties double down on not voting for Biden right? Like, being an asshole doesn't convince people. Maybe make a whole explanational video on this and we'll see.
Vaush is pretending like voting for Biden isn't the predominant thing people are already going to do lmao
Settle for Biden 2020
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks   This is the kind of thing we would have to deal with if he wins! #KAG 🇺🇸
If someone offered to give me a million dollars to vote for Joe Biden I would not take the money No amount of money could make me vote for a worthless liberal! I love my country and have too much respect for myself to ever vote for a progressive liberal!
It costs $0 for white people to hush and listen to BIPOC about their frustrations regarding Biden/Harris.
Biden on women, everyday: "You gotta sniff 'em."
Oh, and as far as I can tell, Biden isn’t racist. He isn’t homophobic. He isn’t a lot of things that Trump definitely is.
Has Biden done shady things? Duh. What politician doesn’t have something on them? You can’t seriously say Biden is shady then go vote for Trump. He’s the shadiest, stupidest one I’ve ever seen.
I am thrilled that you will be Biden’s running mate! You are a great choice for VP, and I think you’re ready to be Pres if called on. Your thoughtful leadership is BADLY needed. My entire family is on board… #BidenHarris2020
If only Presidential elections were about ideologies and proper governance, but, they aren't. Joe Biden picked Kamela Harris so they can be the ultimate NeoLiberal/Centrist swing vote. The Left just has to suck it up to save this country from Trumpism.
Joe Biden with the head of the KKK Robert Byrd
Am getting so Damm sick Joe Biden putting WHITE PPL DOWN        F **k HIM
Have you guys heard that song Havana ft Young Thug by Kamala Harris?!? No wonder Joe Biden picked her. That shit slaps!!!
Yeah that's my biggest fear tbh about Biden and Harris winning. It will make the problems seem solved because we would avoid some of the more drastic direct action at the cost of making it seem like we really changed something for the better when we didn't
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.
But yeah it is really coming down to a lesser of two evils and I do genuinely think Biden being more covert and nice about it enables liberals to think problems are solved and we're all good
goes to Biden’s site
But that's generally the vibe I get from people advocating for voting Biden. Is because they're genuinely scared for their lives and don't think Biden would take direct, fascistic action to harm people
But, for instance, I don't think that Biden would send federal police into a state where BLM protests are happening against the wishes of said state in order to brutalize protesters. But then again that is me  hoping he wouldn't lmao
I think what he is saying is that Trump can make more direct, drastic action (in the same way that you say "we can't wait") that would cause more immediate harm than Biden would. Not saying that that would make me vote for Biden, because I'm generally in agreement.
They have been teeing it up for months.  Bernie bro’s won’t vote for us, Russia is meddling in the 2020 election, built in excuses to disguise that they would love Biden in office but they are ok with Trump and a scapegoat or two!
ay man whats the alternative tho? people complaining about Kanyes mental health but then go and vote for Biden or they complain that Kanye racist and misogynistic and then vote for Trump 😂
Ludicrous! Almost as much as his Biden hates God thing is! Hahahahaha hahahahaha
Man, yesterday started with me seeing a video of Ben Shapiro reading WAP and ended with Biden picking Kamala Harris as his running mate. What a fucking rollercoaster.
I have. The studies cited within the fact check actually say that it helped. Dr. Fauci says that it saved many lives. Yet, Biden called Trump a xenophobe and wouldn't have shut down any of our borders. Many more would have died b
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate is that supposed to impress me? It doesn't It only serves to make me even more determined to vote for Trump!
Biden coulda picked Candace Owens and got the same response.  Cuz by yall logic, it's a black woman = automatically beneficial for black people.
You're right dude, and I don't shame you for not voting Biden. Shit I'm even considering it and have been for months. It's a shitty decision and if you genuinely believe it'll be a better option more power to you comrade
No, I'm trying to engage in a conversation with you lmao I don't want to vote for Biden and if you think so you've got it real twisted my friend
So like, just don't give them any funding or chance at all? And what you are saying sounds a little bit like then options are either move Biden left (which would be... Dubious to say the least without bumfuckery happening), or revolution
Wonder what the over/under line is on how long it take for Biden to get caught sniffing her hair?
Also keep in mind I am leery of any argument that involves convincing Biden or Harris to "move left" since every single decision the Biden campaign has made feels too uncannily close to deliberately choosing to shit on progressives.
What do you think we should do as leftists, now what the ticket is set? Comment to explain if you want! I still don't have a set decision since I think Trump is really bad short term and Biden would be bad long term, but I'm willing to consider the arguments
get ready American Harris said “I will do WHATEVER it takes to get Biden elected”.  Looks like a lot of blow jobs will be coming our way. Never thought the ancestor of a slave owner would stoop so low?
Fascist far right. It’s damage control at this point. I’m settling for Biden sadly. But don’t want Trump.
The fact  isn’t speaking at the Democratic Convention, but anti-choice and anti-union Republican John Kasoch is pretty sad. If the Biden campaign wants to use Kasich for an Ohio ad, go for it, but keep him away from the convention.
Voting for Biden is just damage control at this point. We are still allowed to criticize him and his running mate, especially if we are voting for him. I’m a little disheartened that he seems eager to put Republicans in his cabinet.
Well we know for a fact it happened under Obama/ Biden. I'm not compromising my stances.
It's not nitpicking, I'm not gonna vote for someone I'm fighting against. I'm not gonna vote for profit prisons. I'm not gonna vote for someone who is tough on crime in low income areas. Dems fucked themselves. What do you think Biden/Harris will change?
jesus christ, just read the fucking letter. the “white moderate” in the letter literally refers the person who looks at people fighting for justice and says “you need to be patient” or “you’re too radical”. it’s absolutely not a reach to say joe biden is that moderate.
I think Yang represents something entirely different than both sides of the party. There’s a large base in the party who’s left of Biden but is not getting behind another failed Sanders (or someone of his ilk) “revolution.” Yang is perfect to bridge the gap and bring new people.
This only holds validity of Jo plans on doing what you believe Biden and Harris are not going to. So.. Jo, wanna tell us what you think about defunding?
There were supposed to be this many. The initial estimates by Fauci and Birx were 100-240k deaths. If he hasn't banned travel to China and Europe the number would've been much much higher. Joe Biden wouldn't have banned travel anywhere.
President Trump responds to Biden's selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate
Despite the negatives behind Kamala Harris as well as Joe Biden, I would love *pause for emphasis* to see Kamala destroy Mike Pence in a debate. From one Hoosier to another, it's what I've always wanted. 🤩
Joe Biden with the Tuesday afternoon news dump.
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.
I'm in the middle of a liquor store parking lot, floored at this VP pick, legitimately wondering if Biden is doing this to shit on progressives intentionally. Like. WHAT
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his VP running mate.
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate  via
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate  via
It could not matter less to me who Biden chooses for veep. He could name Jesus Christ or Gandhi or Buddha or whomever and it’s still gonna take me getting completely trashed on Election Day to convince myself to vote for him. “Lesser evil” oh haha fuck you.
I’m voting for Biden as damage control. I won’t be afraid to point out flaws of the VP pick.
we don’t even know who Biden’s VP will be &amp; I’m not ready for the eruption of misogyny, and most likely racism, that is already present for the VP pick.   We owe her better than that.
This is great! His attacks on Biden’s morality is excellent for Democrats! It makes home look even mire like the imbecile he us! It’s great! It’s so absurd people can see how crazy Trump is!
Yes! Biden is smarter, fitter, kinder, mire experienced... he will return America to the greatness it has enjoyed up until Trump. Yes!!!
Did you see Joe Biden riding his bike with a mask...but no helmet! You can’t make this up!
Did Biden remember to bring the girls home and critique on the couch watching TV.
Biden comes out of his basement and sees his shadow.  That means 4 more years of Trump?
This must piss off the GOP. Their talking point / primary policy is that Biden is incapable of functioning. Yet Trump showed us he was unable to hold a glass of water in one hand, needed a general to hold his hand to walk down a ramp, and Trump is unable to read a teleprompter.
my dad just called joe biden bi joeden
Did you mention Biden as if he isn't a part of the Swamp? Lmao. Been in politics for 50 years.
Donald Trump calling communion a sip of wine and a cracker then talkin about how Biden is anti-religious
Biden should not have limited his options by saying that he’s choosing a female VP and strongly suggesting that it will be a minority woman. If there’s a man out there who could help flip Texas then choose him, and work on diversity with cabinet positions
Hell no Donal still got elected after raw dogging a pornstar paying her and his mistress admitting to grabbing pussies which is illegal and buddying up with the Turks the Russians and the North Koreans Biden could shoot somebody on 5th avenue and not lose my vote
MUST WATCH: Tucker Carlson Warns America About Biden’s Possible VP Picks  via
Are the Republicans who called VP Joe Biden not politically correct enough, when it comes to the comments he made about a black reporter needing a test to see whether he is on coke or not, going to be held accountable? Many of you always say there’s a double standard! ...
Just saw Joe Biden on a bike! The picture of fitness as opposed to your morbidly obese ass!
Biden needs to be given equal time for every press conference or briefing, especially the partisan way he does them complete with derogatory terms for democrats.
Just the simple fact that we have a petulant, childish president who calls those who disagree with him names gives Joe Biden an edge in this election. What adult calls people names????
Well the right thinks he's socialist, far left, and hates God so proportionally I wouldn't be surprised if centrists thought Biden was on the left LMAO
Nah. You cant blame the voters for the actions of the person they voted for unless that's what they support. I blame Biden, Trump, and the system that upholds them for the consequences of voting for them. Any one of them could solve the issues in this country but they choose not.
Again you are asserting that I don't agree with you that Trump is worse but, again, saying Biden is part of the reason why Trump was elected and why we have the problems we do is also a valid position.
Even though the "as bad" argument is arbitrary when Biden was part of the setup for the "worse" option
Legislation that has perpetuated and exacerbated racism, as well as killed untold numbers of minorities in this country is not just "shitty legislation." It's why we have the BLM movement that we have right now. And again I never said Biden is "as bad" as Trump
You can vote for Biden without justifying anything he has done, especially him writing the crime bill and simply apologizing for it instead of taking any sort of meaningful policy positions to reverse it.
Yo why are you getting so mad chill. I never said that's what you were doing. I'm saying that too many people are invalidating the very real concerns of others when it comes to Biden. That has nothing to do with using him as damage mitigation.
I understand your concerns but there are also concerns the other way. From both minorities, sexual assault survivors, and progressives. Its perfectly understandable to use Biden as way to get Trump out of office but pretending he's anything more is dubious at best
I cant remember his exact wording but saying extremely racist things even today doesn't exactly help your case. I don't doubt that Trump will do that. I'm saying that there are plenty of POC that don't want Joe Biden in office for very valid reasons. As well as rape victims.
I don't blame anyone for voting Biden but pushing him as anything other than SOLELY a way to get Trump out of office and nothing more is questionable at best.
Youunderstand that Biden wrote a crime bill that has demonized black ppl for far longer than Trump has been in presidency right? I'm not invalidating yours or others concerns about re-electing trump but that's a two way street bc there are plenty who have been demonized by Joe.
Wut? Just because somebody is privileged doesn't mean they can't have concerns for others about a given candidate. I understand that both candidates are bad and mitigating damage is a valid way to feel with voting Biden over Trump.
He's not wrong. If you don't want people to invalidate your (very valid) concerns about a Joe Biden presidency then please don't invalidate the concerns of others who are concerned about a Trump re-election. This is coming from a leftist.
Bruh Biden isn’t even campaigning anymore. He’ll be lucky if he gets 10% of all votes.
I live in Indiana where I guarantee Trump will win by 8-15 points.  I don't plan on voting Biden as of now, but if I lived in a different state I would have the same thoughts as you do.
If Biden wins; China wins but if President Trump wins; Russia wins. I see nothing good from these two outcomes  Seeing Trump as ‘unpredictable,’ China would prefer he not win reelection, intelligence official says
If you don't want people to invalidate your very real and credible concerns about a Biden campaign then I sure as hell better not catch you invalidating someone else's very real and credible concerns about Trump being re-elected. Criticize Biden as the solution? Sure.
But yes. Biden makes it harder and harder to make that choice every single fucking day. It's like he wants to lose or at least doesn't give a shit about fucking over progressives openly and blatantly
Not to mention federal police being deployed to areas that aren't Washington DC without the consent of the governor's in said state. It's a shitty choice and Biden isn't gonna solve anything but I don't blame them. Shitty choice no matter what.
i support you ~ but too say Joe Biden is against GOD makes you look really badJoe Biden owns Fox News reporter during morning bike ride
The Trump campaign is a cesspool of mismanagement, nepotism, grift, and idiocy
Every day, we see your desperation and your corruption, delaying mail, lying about VP Biden, manipulating the election to cheat.  You’re delaying the relief to Americans and blaming democrats.  Crooked Donald!
Voting for Biden/Harris no matter what they drop. NOTHING can be worse than what we have seen with trump both before and during his term and his administration
Yes we will...Biden/Harris!
People just remember the vote is not just for Biden-Harris. It's also to replace Bill Barr, Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper, Betsy Devos, and the entire corrupt regime......we need change now so don’t forget to vote.
As a whole we're fucked up kamala and biden y'all really happy for that
With Biden as her fellow running mate, and historical family slave holding, this team is gonna get a lot of black votes... NOT
Vote Biden. The country will not survive 4 more years of trump. We will be struggling to get thru to January
2/we were simple. Why would u vote against ur best interests? Because some c slave told u 2. It's that simple. If u notice once biden was declared the nominee racial hostilities REALLY ramped up. It was the sign whites could go back 2 the status quo.☮✊🏿#BLM #BDS #M4ANOW

The moment she becomes Biden’s running mate, her entire “progressive” look goes right out the window. WOW I COULDNT HAVE SEEN THIS ONE COMING.
Joe Biden wants to defund the police.  That would make our communities less safe. I have 2 daughters who’s safety is my number 1 responsibility.  This is the core reason I can’t vote for Biden.  Every other political issue comes in at a distant 2nd to safe streets.  Have fun!

Trump tries scaring suburban women; Biden tries to meet their real needs
And Joe Biden knows what year it is
I think my favorite part about Harris being VP nominee is that she literally  said she believes Biden's sexual assault/harrassment accusers, which means she has zero integrity because she chose to accept the nomination anyway.   She believes women, but she supports their abusers.
She also called him a racist on national television. The democratic party is a farce. America deserves better than Biden/Harris. The disrespect for Gabbard is unreal.
Biden is 190 years old, its obvious what is going on
About right I’d say for Biden
It makes me wanna cry 😭   knowing how many will STILL buy their lies from DNC,Harris,Biden &amp; the media after all this time of rock solid proof in the future of blk/minority communities  🙁🙁🙁
Nope,nor do they to Harris or Biden and in many ways Trump too
Neither him nor Biden will do it. Both are benefiting from its continued status as schedule 1. Plus Cheeto doesn’t have any cabinet members educated on cannabis because he picked a bunch of corporate shills like himself
🤪🤪  Biden/Harris. There will be NO PROGRESS in the blk communities whatsoever
Biden wrote the bills that Harris uses to put innocent blk Americans in prison  record numbers,many for victimless “crimes”
#1: Biden didn’t “Choose” Harris,the DNC did 4 him. #2: How is Biden empathic??  #3: Harris is NOT black
Into some of the WORST politicians in Washington to ever exist since Nixon??   Btw,I’m very much against Cheeto too &amp; most of his actions.  Biden &amp; Harris are inherently evil 👿

Aye remember when Joe Biden said “if you don’t vote for me your not black” when he was talking to Charlamagne 😭😭😭 maaaaaaan 2020 hits differently and it’s not a good hit either lol.“Person, woman, man, camera, uh, uh, TV.  They ask you again later and if you say them in the right order you get extra points.” I know I’d be terrified to debate that guy. #TrumpIsNotWell #Biden
Every day, we see your desperation and your corruption, delaying mail, lying about VP Biden, manipulating the election to cheat.  You’re delaying the relief to Americans and blaming democrats.  Crooked Donald!
Yes we will...Biden/Harris!
Totally.  Missed.  "LOTTERS"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  *WHITE PEOPLE...... *(SOME)
Lol biden
I hope Biden's team, his attorneys, anyone in our government has been preparing counteraction for when this goes down. Personally, I can't take much more of this and I'm suffering. Watching the transition to authoritarianism while people cheer it on is just too much.
What failure in the Obama/Biden WH? They led with dignity and class. Economy was turned around after the worse recession not prompted by a global pandemic, but greed. If politicians had the American ppl on their minds, we’d have health care that makes sense. The man n WH b/c of u
Me too! I am so anxious I can barely sleep. It is heart-rending to watch those who know better and can do better stand by and do nothing! I am so sad, but so ready to stand and vote. Biden/Harris 2020
People just remember the vote is not just for Biden-Harris. It's also to replace Bill Barr, Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper, Betsy Devos, and the entire corrupt regime......we need change now so don’t forget to vote.
I do.  I don’t want any doubters at this time. Trump has got to go. If Biden/Harris do not do what the American people can respect, they can go too in 2024. Democracy is at stake with that guy in the WH!
Yes! I hope there are fewer like you. If Chump is doing so many unconstitutional things out in the open, I can only imagine what’s going on beneath the surface. Biden/Harris 2020.
She apologized for working with R Kelly, the rapist,  but not Joe Biden, the rapist 🥴 Fadga only believes women when the accused is a black man 🤢
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
I thought you were running against Biden???🤔🤔🤔  You just can’t keep  out your lying mouth.  She’s in your head so bad cause everyone loves her. I can’t wait to see you leave in January.
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. “Hey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?” she asked. “Ready to work! Let’s go (Dr. Jill Biden)!” he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
This country has transformed in my lifetime. Biden can not square this person with the image he portrays of himself.   Former S.F. Mayor Willie Brown writes about dating Kamala Harris, appointing her to posts  via
Please DJT keep helping Biden/ Harris ,keep talking! I would, if I were you go on television 10 times a day and quadruple down on everything you say. Tell the world you are a Golden God or an Orange one anyway! #FailedPresident
As the A.G she failed at running her office, then she failed at managing her campaign, but somehow she's right to manage the country when Biden dies. We should promote her for incompetence and poor management skills. 🤷🏿‍♂️
i don’t know who needs to hear this, but this is NOT the election to push for a 3rd party. it’s just not.   please vote biden-harris. tr*mp needs to get the fuck out of the white house
I question whether there were any intentions in the part of Biden at all. I do think that the hadith is in line with modern Dems attempt at totalitarianism and the silencing of speech.
March 2020, Tara Reade alleged that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her and was ignored by the Democrat party.  #metoo
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
- I’ll say it again: nobody on the #right gets to talk about #Biden’s past until you deal with yer boy #trump. Until then,  #stfu. -
In 2013, Joe Biden and Hunter Biden flew aboard Air Force Two to China. Ten days later, Hunter Biden's firm inked a $1,500,000,000.00 deal with a subsidiary of the Communist Chinese government's Bank of China.
But Biden backs the thugs at home
Bill, just say it.... you back Biden, a Democrat
I kept on smiling the entire time that she and Joe Biden were speaking.
Vacate the People's House, immediately. We need to fumigate before President Biden moves in.
I'm 5'2 and I am not going to be able to take over as President for years if something happened to Biden 🤨🤨🤨
Kamala Harris You are Amazing and I can’t wait to vote for you and Joe Biden, you both gave me hope that things will get better for we the people and our country. God Bless Both Of You.💙💙
Rudy Giuliani’s daughter endorses Joe Biden for president -
Or Biden saying it from a cue  card thinking it said aunt Jemima
I would ask to be put up for adoption if my mom got me a JOE BIDEN ACTION FIGURE
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
This is who Biden chose? 🥴
Really is this simple. But your life is still fine, so just keep voting and saying yes to the system. You don’t choose your place in time, but you can choose to make it better. It’s deeper than Trump/Biden.   You watched home alone? Read what that child star tells you with his xp
Biden could have picked Jesus Christ as his running mate and I still wouldn’t consider voting for him.
I wont lie...I’m not too much into politics and I thought Biden made the right choice picking an African American female...bro...i did not know she was Uncle Ruckus’s Wife😭😭shorty ova racist.
I get a lot of crap talk from old Trump voters who criticize Biden’s physical and mental health, but when I turn the tables on them they get all offended and attack me. 🙄
The same way Joe Biden gets a pass on sexual assault
I also think they might have stolen the whole “unity” idea from  with their “Biden-Sanders unity task force.”
And Joe Biden knows what year it is
Yeah idgaf what shitty propagandas and past events y’all throw on Biden and Kamala. Nothing they’ve done compares to the atrocities of Donald Trump.
Biden and Harris what a team against Trump and his corruption
I think my favorite part about Harris being VP nominee is that she literally  said she believes Biden's sexual assault/harrassment accusers, which means she has zero integrity because she chose to accept the nomination anyway.   She believes women, but she supports their abusers.
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday.
She also called him a racist on national television. The democratic party is a farce. America deserves better than Biden/Harris. The disrespect for Gabbard is unreal.
The left has called every Republican from Ronald Reagan to Bush 41,43, McCain, and Romney, who was laughed at for calling Russia our geopolitical foe in 2012, a fascist. According to recent intelligence Russia wants Trump but China and Iran want Biden. Where are you from?
Trump picked a racist white dude who was a failed governor as VP. Biden picked an accomplished woman of color. I think we know who cares about America.
Remember when Joe Biden was accused of sexual assault? Pedo Joe 2020 👍🏻🇺🇸
Remember when Joe Biden was accused of sexual assault? #metoo
Idk how I'm going to vote. All choices are super terrible in regards to decency (Trump) and policy/philosophy (Biden/Harris). That's not to say I don't have disagreements with Trump but I have more disagreements with Biden/Harris. I'd be on board had it been Klobuchar
I honestly can't vote for Biden/Harris. Tbh I'm not a fan of Trump either. I don't like his conduct, his hardline stance on immigration or his overall more protectionist leanings. I'm more with Reagan/Romney/McCain on policy &amp; philosophy. Idk what to do this election.
And yet I still can't vote for Biden/Harris. I had an emotional reaction after the announcment to vote for Trump but idk. The only good GOPer on my ballot that i have more in common on policy is my great governor of Indiana  and I'll happily vote for him.
Kamala doesn’t have the trust of the black community. They crucified her during the debates for her actions as AG of California from 2011-17 and DA 2004-2011. She was a sharp enemy of Biden then and threw lots of low blows...now they’re partners? Doesn’t look good.
still cant believe out of 27 candidates we even got Joe Biden
the Internet moves extremely fast. pictured: Joe Biden and sgt. Kamala Harris arresting young activist Bernie Sanders for peacefully protesting (1964)
And she on the reecord calling Biden is a racist and a rapist. Should be fun watching her reinvent that narrative.
Sorry, I don't like Trump or his more nationalist &amp; protectionist policies but it doesn't mean I can just turn my back on conservative policy positions I've had since before him and enthusiastically endorse the far-left Biden/Harris ticket.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Kamala Harris. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Is this serious or is it a seriously bad joke? All I can say is WOW!!!! Anyone that would vote for this ticket must have their head firmly planted up their own ass!!!!
It's one thing to oppose Trump for his demeanor and say you'll vote Biden just to get rid of Trump but they are enthusiastically supporting policy positions opposed by the GOP even before Trump. That says something about the "principled" folks.
Most black people in this country hate come Kamala Harris. Biden just put the final nail in this coffin. He's done...
Biden picks the first Jamaican/Indian woman to be his VP.
I honestly can't tell if Biden's campaign is like really dense on purpose rn
I wasn't going to vote in this election. I didn't like the choices of Trump or Biden, however, with the thought of far-left Kamala Harris a heartbeat away from the presidency I'll hold back my vomit and vote for Trump.
Trump vs Biden Pence vs Harris  I'm looking forward to the debates.
For the record a brown paper bag is better than Mike Pence as VP. Love Harris as Biden’s running mate! #KamalaHarrisForVP #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBiden2020
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
"I would be inclined to go a different route than what he's done," President Trump said commenting on Joe Biden's potential VP choice. "He said he had to pick a woman. He said that, and you know, some people would say men are insulted by that and some people would say it is fine
Whoever would you vote for Biden.  You do realize the ol Bernie here advocates for communism right?  And Biden is fully on board with that?
And finally. Basically it doesn’t matter who Biden picks. We must get racism, hate, and incompetence out of the #WhiteHouse #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
Biden VP candidates that he could pick and not lose my vote a thread #Biden2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteTrumpOut Hela from Thor
No, but Jr. might run or DeSantis or Pompeo. So yes, more Trump. That's why Biden's VP pick is so important. She needs to be able to beat one of the above right-wing nuts.
Nope. Riden with Biden all the way! ❤️
Biden could pick Sarah Palin and he’ll still have my vote, although I would give him a side eye for picking her...lol 👀
Is CNN in the tank for Biden?  Just checking everyone’s sanity 😂
Damn, you also stan Gaga? Who denounced her work with rapist R Kelly, but not rapist Joe Biden?🤢 Explains your support for abusers🥴
No, there are many edited and non-contextualized of things Biden has said. Has he always been perfect? Of course not. But has he ever paid for a full-page in The NY Times calling for the execution of kids like yours (who happened to be innocent)?
Its true and its an historical accomplishment. Criticize our "system" all you like, make alterations if you can track the results but by no mean "fundamentally change" it. That's madness and that's what Biden says he wants to do.
He also said we need to pull out of this Vietnam war..
So you're basically a hypocrite. Chastising people for wanting to vote for Biden because they hate Trump, but you're voting for Trump because of some BS lies about Biden. Makes perfect sense. What rock have you been under with all the racist shit Trump has said/done?
What keeps me up at night is wondering if our votes will count if Russia changes them. Or that mailed ballots get lost. That people will believe the fake dirt on Biden they'll kick up. That they'll actually arrest Biden. I wonder what we can do to stop it.
I’m pissed and offended at the Republican Party for thinking that we would vote for crazy ass Kayne instead of Biden in the first place...we were done with Kayne years ago
I thought some fat orange guy said Biden never comes out of his bunker?!
Oh God! He’s attacking Dems, Biden, mail in voting...they’re trying to steal the election.  You’re getting interference from Russia again, you slowed the mail, so, who’s stealing the election?  Babbling sack of shit.
You. Are. Lying. But guess what? I do not care what kind of fabricated bs Bill Barr or your committee releases on Biden before the election. I will vote for him anyway and declare that if Trump can do it, so can Biden. FATWO
Biden’s been the nominee for months, you can’t equate Obama and Clinton picking since they had actual competitive primaries.......
Not feeling that voice...Biden needs a voice that speaks with authority like Morgan Freeman or that "Safe drivers save 40%" Guy Dennis Haysbert
It’s not true that Joe Biden is a predator? Are you okay? 🥴
Trump has the vote fix in on the US side by sabotaging the USPS and Russia has the fix in with hacked voting machines and fabricated dirt on Biden. This is all I think about along with COVID.
Don’t let Ye trying to take votes from Biden distract y’all from the fact that Rick Ross had a masseuse, and 2 Chainz brought “Essential Workers” to their Verzuz #iykyk
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
From attacking Biden saying he wants to “hurt God” then question Joe’s faith, to constantly attacking Democrats.  Donald has been an evil, lying, hateful, unintelligent, arrogant waste of space for decades and he’s escalating so he won’t go to jail.
Is America really ready for an atheist president like Joe Biden?  Someone that is OK with closing churches and burning bibles?
If Biden wins and Kamala is his VP and something happens to Joe. It will be interesting to see how the 1st black president will handle the country...
Your giving Biden too much credit here sir.
How can he get away with this? Its always the same. Biden does not the the Black community can think.. So when does the R word come into play? He does not respIct. (Al) the back people.It's a shame that there is even a chance Trump won't be in office again.  Biden has issues that are being ignored.   Shocker!

Where is Joe Biden?  Can he not even stand up before media and answer questions?  But elect him as President?????
Ahhh great, another mini-rally that will inevitably help Joe Biden's polling numbers.  Please, never stop with these mini rallies. After yesterdays mini-rally, I talked my neighbor, a long time Republican, into voting for Biden based on your talk. So please, keep it up!!
No I am not shocked because it makes Obama &amp; Biden look like idiots with their foreign policy of 8 crazy years. Obama did the bowing down to foreign leaders &amp; apologizing to everyone.
Ill vote but not for either of these fools. Biden dug the ditch is in. Cant pretend hes a legit leader

What we know is he is the guy running against trump. You don’t think we don’t know he’s problematic? Our choices are often between problematic people because the whole system is fckd but Trump gotta go then we will deal with Biden.
You really want to talk sex rings with #UrineTroubleTrump is directly tied to Epstein and Maxwell? Really? Mr Grab them by the pu$$y? Wow did you say the perfectly wrong thing. Please keep campaigning for Biden with this kind of talk. Your doing great reminding people.
She is claiming that Joe Biden is supporting Sharia Law.
Hmmm. Understandable. I think some of my family's confidence waned a little when Biden gave his speech about the mask mandate the other day, because he actually sounded like a normal human being. Like someone told him to slow down so he didn't keep stumbling. Made him look better
I just cant believe biden is worse than trump. Hes not, hes the same but with experience. We need revolution
You better have a talk with your boss. He seems to have a hand in many businesses in China, which is overseas, which you claim is bad for Biden, but Ok for Trump? Hippocrit -a person who pretends to have certain beliefs, attitudes or feelings when they really do not
Is biden not the same with better optics? I truly dont see either as ‘better’ trump is just dumber
I just also cant vote for biden i think trump is despicable and the opposition is equally despicable. Im ready to die for revolution
Netanyahu only agreed to this to help out Trump and divert attention from his Corruption trial. If Biden wins, Netanyahu will pull the plug on this before you can blink.
If you are in dialogue with some GOP friends that are open to discussion what are the best responses when they say Biden/Harris will make the US a socialist country? Not to get them mad or argue, but start them thinking.
If you’re voting #Biden &amp; you’re voting on Election Day I beseech you to go to the polls as soon as they open. With many worried about mail-in ballots due to Trump’s sabotage there could be extremely long lines later in the day. Your courage is admirable. Your vote is sacred.
I just begged my sisters to vote for Biden even though I absolutely disapprove of him. Get trump out of office.  Please.
I only hope that the Trump administration decides to spy on Biden and Harris just like the Obama administration did to Trump . I mean, come on ....what’s fair is fair?

Our country will have a president one way or the other. Decide if you want stupidity and lies, or intelligent and not exactly what you want. Trump is destroying us, Biden has been around for a long time and hasn’t destroyed us yet. Vote Biden. Please!
Biden, but work to help progressives down ballot in your state and others.
Whats also "out there" is your collusion with Kanye. So I guess. according to your standards, we should be looking into that as well?  No one campaigns harder for Biden/Harris than the Trump family.  They speak, Biden's numbers increase.
My grandmother said that Biden "won't be able to control" Kamala Harris, and I'm just WOW.
If #BidenHarris2020 happens, Its going to be a continuation of the status quo and the disastrous neoliberal corporatist politics for at least 8 years. Think about that..  Nothing will fundamentally change. Not under Trump. Not under Biden.  #GeneralStrike
Yeah Biden who is nearly brain dead will be great.  How can you vote for a man who is nearly 80 with undeniable symptoms of dementia.  ???
Did you actually thin Joe would make it to election day? Imagine the Bernie supporters if she ends up the head of the ticket. What does happen when polling goes south and Biden keeps losing his mind?
Unless you are hunkered down in a basement eating Tapioca and are unable to go out to groceries, big box retailers , etc. in which case u can apply for the Biden Absentee ballot!
We laugh at you/Tucker every night as you both continue to campaign for Joe Biden.  Keep up the sterling work, the both of you!!  +12 points today and growing. I cant wait to see how much we gain after this mini rally today where you talk about saving a war that wasnt happening
With a parachute? Or are you that worried that Biden's gonna win?
Neither will this suburban housewife!!! Biden/Harris 2020🙌🙌
Evan I'd like to thank you for the work you are doing to help Joe Biden/Kamala Harris win in November. Every single time Republicans/Trumpers talk or act in an outright ignorant fashion like this, Joe's polling #'s go up. He is up 12 points today and with this pic, even higher
Braun is at his least believable when he says things like Biden/Harris represent a "radical left ticket of liberal anarchy."
NOT EVEN KANYE is there!!!!  Biden's polling numbers are +12 today and the more they do ignorant things like this, the higher they will go, so please Republicans and Trumpers keep up this sterling work!!! We are counting on YOU to help elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Trump - "Kamala is nasty" - "AOC is dumb" - "Elizabeth Warren is nasty"  So I'm confused - what is the common interest there Jared?  Keep talking.  Biden's poll numbers increase every time you speak.  Biden up 12 full points as of yesterday and with all the BS today, even more.
Lib Journos, especially  and  are too busy figuring out how to provide immense cover for Biden during the debates to cover the #Trump peace deal with UAE and Israel.
Antifa dot com lead you to a biden fundraiser until it went down due to it going viral on twitter
Some preemptive  &amp;  fact checking:  "Most pro-abortion ticket ever" Biden is a devout Catholic.  "Most anti-Israel ticket ever" Harris is married to a Jewish attorney. Her stepkids call her "Momala," a play on her name &amp; the Yiddish “Mamaleh,” which means little mama.

Oh, so Trump’s train uses fossil fuels and just blows past the town spraying everyone with smoke. Biden is eco-friendly and you know will stop to talk to residents.
So, Herman Cain is tweeting out editorials against Biden and Harris this morning. You know, the guy who died two weeks ago, because of Trump.   Every time I want to say something is peak 2020, they raise the mountaintop on me.
Kanye, who he is funding right this moment to take votes away from Biden. Which is illegal.
Trump: 'Nobody More Insulting to Biden Than' Harris Was  #Newsmax via
Let’s be honest, the DNC chose you because they knew Biden was going to lose. They needed to pick someone whose seat would go to a Democrat without fear of a Republican taking the seat. You are the sacrifice. 😆
So.... Biden is physically fit?
BIDEN -HARRIS speeches lastnight were PURE BULLSHIT. Full of lies. They didn’t show anything. The only thing they guaranteed is Trump will be re-elect November 3,2020
He has next to nothing to throw at Biden and Kamala. “Biden is mentally unfit” so is Trump. “Biden says racist things” so does Trump except Biden has Obama and now kamala. “Kamala is a cop” trump wishes he had her criminal justice record. “They are far left” no they arent
You might have a certain privilege if you are able to equate the cons of a Biden victory with the cons of a Trump victory.
Kamala was my first choice a year ago and she still is. I'll let others be Anti-Trump. I will be positive and support Biden-Harris.
I know.  Then again, these rabid conservatives would have painted anyone Biden chose as a "Marxist".
If your looking for a laugh look at Lori Hendry's Twitter feed.  She has said that Kamala Harris isn't black, that Trump retweets her all the time, and that Joe Biden sexually assaults every women he ever met. Her greatest goal in life is to have her privates grabbed by any Trump
Kamala really said this? And there are people who will vote for her and Biden? Not thinking long term, are they!
This is how screwed up Sleepy Joe is in the head.  Schools should teach America History &amp; Civics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Biden: Schools should ramp up 'Islamic faith' studies, Muslims must 'mobilize' against Trump  via
John Kasich still has influence in Republican politics.  He may well be able to put Ohio in play, and keep it there, for Biden.  And, if we want people to reach across the aisle, it’s good that he’s making the effort.  AOC can have more time without this cancel Kasich bs.
I WISH I could see the “List of Rules” that the “Free Press” had to abide by at Biden’s press conferences today!!!  Rumors are that they couldn’t show Harris in any state of emotion, nothing unflattering, not if her voice is raised, etc...   Trump is NEVER given that courtesy.
Donna. I agree with you. I’m sure you know you have some haters and trolls on this feed. Keep up the good work. Go Biden\Harris.
I had to turn it off after three minutes. Joe Biden is a liar and a fraud! Kamala is no better, sending all those folks to jail while she sits there having the luxury to talk about smoking (and inhaling)! #DrainTheSwamp
If you google  it will take you to Biden / Harris website.                 That says it all.
Biden-Harris campaign launch uses the Style Council version of Move on Up to end their press conference. Hope Paul's ok with that.
Im voting. Not for biden or trump.
Biden/Harris: At least we aren't Trump/Pence
Sick of dumb ass niggas...just last week they were posting black and white selfies on social media talking bout, "I'm such and such and I will never tear down another black woman/man...blah, blah, blah..." Biden chose Kamala and the bullshit started...😑 #BidenHarris2020
Biden speaks lies.
since Kamala is a great counter to 2 of trump's big strategy points at this point in the election, she seems like she could quell some fears ppl have about biden. As opposed to him picking COMMIE YANG or another candidate that would be more appealing to me
Mmm. I think the difference is pretty big, cuz after all it's not about what republicans think, it's about independents, and having 2 of the most centrist dems being pres and VP helps nullify one of Trump's biggest attacks. Also "Cop"mala helps biden be more "law and order"
i used to think this, but also there's a huge chunk of the pop not being considered here -  independents, who biden is currently crushing it with  also keep in mind, Trump's main message is Biden is a far-left wing puppet, putting in a progressive VP would support that
B4 Biden said he was going to choose a woman for his ticket, I was so hoping for Kamala! I can't wait for the vp debate! She is going to make pence sit like the dog he is!! She's going to rock it as our 1st woman veep! I wana be part of the #KHive Plz give her my Love, from Joy!
Absolutely wrong. She is a complete opportunistic, hypocrite simply after leftist power. She tore into Biden and now will go out and praise him. Black America should see that and remember it. It’s her way.
Mr. President, I am a life-long Republican.  I have never voted for a Democrat for president.  And that will change in November.  I will vote for Biden-Harris because it is the ONLY option that gives our nation a chance to find its way back.  No regrets voting for them!
Biden tells blacks how to vote.
Believe all women.  Then Biden is too.
NEWS: Joe Biden has selected far-left liberal U.S. Senator Kamala Harris to be his running mate in the November election. Harris is known to oppose nearly every policy agenda IFI supports, and her record proves it.
If Biden is hiding his gaffes, Trump is not ashamed to put his own on full display nearly every single day.
2 hours in on Fox and Friends, and they keep rolling the tape of Harris challenging Biden at the 1st debate. That is literally all Trump’s Buttsniffers have.Biden saw Harris’ toughness and picked her for VP, anyway. How many times has Trump picked a critic for the greater good? 0
I look forward to NOT hearing a peep out of Fox "News" once Biden/Harris win.  I say this because if they start spouting off, they stand a great chance of being held accountable for their "news" putting people in danger.
Yea the green party has the platform that is closest to what id like but they sorta seem to have boned dario hunter. Still not gonna vote biden or trump tho ill figure out my 3rd party pick soon enough
Yep. But what was expected outta biden. Fuck both these tickets
Biden=trump
Why are you agreeing to spread FALSE RUSSIAN propaganda about Biden? You are no longer a patriot of the U.S.  You are now complicit with Trump in working for the Russians, komrad Grassley!
Facts at first I’m like uhh kamala cause I do not care for Biden at all. But the. I’m thinking and I’m like Lauren look at the symbolism in this and what this mean for women, especially black women.
I’ll admit it. I’m way more excited about Harris than I am Biden. She would have been my primary vote. I’m glad she’s on the ticket #BidenHarris2020
Between  and Dr. Jill Biden, NO ONE is getting through when they should not!!
The mess that Biden made?
If by "Keep America Great" you mean living in a country needlessly ravaged by a deadly virus that has killed more than 165K people, closed schools and caused economic calamity, I'll take radical left liberal anarchy and government-run healthcare all day long. Biden/Harris 2020!
Biden just lost by a wider margin than before
No Cory, she just wants to get rid of Trump sycophants like you who are party above people. I know you dont care but 160k+ Americans have died with more to come. Kamala and Joe Biden care and will actually DO something about it. I suggest LinkedIn when your time is up.
Oh, for heaven’s sake. Is that one of Biden/Harris talking pts? TRUMP2020
Do you guys know where I can get a Biden yard sign around here?
Kamala Harris proves that politicians have zero values. Biden was accused of sexual assault and Harris said she believed the women who was assaulted. Then she accepts the VP slot. How can she reconcile this?
Can Dr. Jill Biden be First Lady &amp; Secretary of Education? 🧐🧐
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
See this is what I'm talking!! I love you Bernie for supporting Biden/Harris!!! We need trump to go down!!
Carmel Dems are all in for Biden/Harris 2020! Let’s get to work.

Trump or Biden. Period. We cannot afford to be divided now. Let's take our country back, then we can fight amongst ourselves, but if we don't do it now, we won't have country to fight in or the right to be able to. #BidenHarris2020
hoping that biden will be more progressive and effective if he wins and gets majority in congress
Because they don’t want Biden to. Duh. Obvious. Trumps asked like million times.
One more thing: it’s significant that Biden picked the woman who wasn’t afraid to call him out on a debate stage. We need more leaders who elevate people who challenge their thinking. Only weak people surround themselves with sycophants.
Can't wait for the debates!  I hope Biden debates Trump.  It will be good TV since college football is about gone.
obama was probably little more to the left but couldnt get anything done cause congress was more to the right, while is biden wins there will be a more progressive congress
2/2: Don’t be surprised if any of the ‘Trump ministers’ says Biden will look for guidance from the Pope rather than the his cabinet.  They tried it with JFK and they not very creative.
I do recall her calling Biden a racist on live TV. smh
Sleepy Joe Biden has done nothing in his 47 years in politics. He picked Kamala Harris as his VP. She is following Sleepy Joe’s footsteps. Kamala Harris has done nothing in her political career either.
approves of Kamala Harris.  Here is proof that he donated to her campaign not once but twice.  Cannot wait to hear him speak highly and approve of Biden's choice for running mate.  Or else Trump will look more of a fool than he already does. Hmm, let's watch what he does!
Biden/Harris 2020!!!!! That is all.
Can I bet on Biden?
You are absolutely brilliant!  I nominate Kimberley Johnson for the Biden Cabinet!!! 👍💯
She's probably the most unlikable candidate possible.  Great news for Trump.  She locked up almost as many black men as Biden.
I’m a demsoc and a big Bernie supporter, but four more years of Trump will be a much farther setback for the movement than Biden.  You may be able to handle 4 more years of Trump, but others can’t afford it. He is a threat to our democratic institutions, basic rights, and health.
If you hate that the ticket is Biden/Harris, you should have showed up and voted for, Bernie, Pete, Warren or whomever you supported. Much needs to be fixed, but until there is record voter turnout in the primaries, we won’t see change. Put your privilege aside and vote in Nov!
I wasn't super thrilled to vote  but I was because Trump is awful.  But seeing that  is Biden's running mate has me excited again.  Can't wait to watch her bring the smackdown on Pence during the VP debate.
IndyStar: Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his VP running mate
I am so excited about the pick of Kamala Harris as Vice Presidential runnning mate to Joe Biden.  This is a historic moment.  Call him courageous Joe!! Game On!
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate
i doubt harris would suddenly become less prominent like kaine if biden lost
Yes and yes, a really good sign.  Particularly happy that Biden choose the better choice, not the one he was most familiar with.
Now that we know it’s Kamala, I can’t wait for the debate. She will chew Pence up and spit him out. She destroyed Barr in the AG hearing. I said a year ago when Trump got impeached trying to sabotage Biden’s campaign, this is the best ticket.
The mainstream media can say all day long that Trump is a racist but we all know who the real one is.  "You are not black if you don't vote for me".  How many insults are Black voters supposed to take from Joe Biden?
Biden/Harris we now have a Presidential Race!
Biden/Harris we now have a Presidential Race!

"Do not hold grudges" — Joe Biden
Yeah, I love how the headline says "Joe Biden has selected..."   How much you wanna bet that's not true? 😂😂
But when I read these words, nothing he's saying is wrong....  So how exactly is this convince me NOT to vote for Biden?
Hopefully it is going to be
Actually that number represents white men who are CEO's of corporations more than anything. They love their money and they they know Trump will help them keep it. Its does not represent all of us, thank God!! I'll be voting Biden.
Joe Biden selects his running mate with announcement coming as early as Tuesday
I guess it depends on how you look at it. Biden goes to church and has an issue with one of the Catholic beliefs. Trump spends all his time at his golf courses, when he’s  not being Putin’s wife or writing love letters to Kim Jung UN. I’m not the one with a comprehension issue.
I still say Biden won't be the nominee  so this is all a smoke show but, Who decides what is/isnt a mysoginist remark?
I mean Biden’s the same way then. Idk, I just think it’s a product of being in front of the camera all day, but maybe I’m wrong.
The American Dream will soon become the American Nightmare if the Dems get control of our government!
Come on corn pop!  Biden would probably be more comical though yes.
We must put country above party. That's what Kasich is doing. There are so many patriots who are doing the same thing. The Lincoln Project has been incredible. Republicans for Joe BIden too and so many more. The problem with most of the GOP right now is they aren't doing that.
If Biden names a woman VP candiate, as predicted, will your wife have to be on stage during the VP debate?
Truthfully not sure Biden can even pick his nose at this point.
Trump finishes his press conference after shots are fired at the White House. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is still living in his basement because he fears for his safety due to COVID. #TrumpIsTheGOAT
I hear you. But it is possible that trump did unintentionally make the mistake. He is obviously very driven to prove his cognitive abilities and show his superiority to Biden. He might not do this intentionally.
Greg wants us all to hide in our basements until Biden is elected. #Trump2020
I’m on Biden’s shortlist of irrelevant Hoosiers. You can trace my car going directly to the Kroger tomorrow.
Against this nightmare of clowns and huge turnover, I’ve been saying for weeks this is a Biden power move. He’s stacked with talent and people will vote deep because shallow didn’t work out so well.
Go cry to daddy. Your upset Russia wants tRump and he is losing and China wants Biden. Waaaa
When Biden announces his VP pick, he should just announce the entire Cabinet, and it will be like Avengers Assembling to save the world. It would be a beautiful moment for sure.
As long as Trump keeps talking, Biden has nothing to worry about.  And Trump cannot shut up to save his life.
It would be great to hear the perspective of those that support Trump. I don’t want to hear why you won’t vote for Biden but rather why Trump gets your vote.
It’s not do nothing see Bush Sr, Cheney, Biden, Pence. They are the gateway to Congress. Those 200 judges aren’t being tee’d up by Trump. That’s all Pence.
If it does they aren’t voting for Biden.
Biden continues today to fight his tendency to stutter.  Republicans (FOX) plays up this as if it’s dementia instead of the speech impediment he has fought his entire life.
He can’t vote for Biden and claim to be a conservative
So that means  approves of Joe Biden then, cool.  I guess he's backing Biden because he is pissed that his Dad loves Kanye more than him!!
President Joe Biden
You know I've over-indexed on politics recently when I read #RIPKamala and my first thought was Joe Biden picked someone other than Kamala Harris as Veep rather than thinking about the Ugandan Giant!
Ummmm I don’t believe that Biden can get a bike to 30mph but nice try.
So what lies were made up there froggy? Biden is a lifelong politician who has done absolutely nothing. What makes you think he suddenly has the answers? You vote for Biden and within one year you’re stuck with who he picked because of race and gender. That’s f’n scary
Biden doesn't even remember Ferguson. Someone is writing his texts. Buying a gun this week. Haven't had one in 20 years but it's time to put my family first.
They're thinking people will vote for Biden purely because he was Obama's VP. And they are correct, to a certain extent.
You’re kidding right? It has been plainly proven that Obama and Biden knew of meddling in the 2016 election and chose to do nothing because they thought Hillary would win in a landslide. So don’t tell us a Joe Biden would do something. We know better
Lol. Your leader Obumma/Biden knew it in 2016 but felt that there was no way that Hillary would get beat so just let it go. Now you a holes want to try and spin it and pin it on Republicans? You guys are laughable
Anything and everything. I trust Ice more than joe Biden
The division was started with Obumma and Biden a decade ago. The media are all in on it. If not, then explain why the media shows pictures of black children who have been killed by police when the people are actually menacing adults. I.e Mike Brown
Mueller said POTUS Capone is exempt from our laws while he’s POTUS.The next day,Trump committed extortion in broad daylight by trying to get Ukraine Prez,to announce an investigation on Biden.Mueller essentially said if he weren’t POTUS, he’d be indicted. Lies are facts to Trump
Wait... BIDEN is spreading false information?  JFC.  A vaccine in time for Election Day?  Wonder how many people the president chose to let die so he could hang on to this bombshell.
Pastor, I'm curious to hear your examples as to how he has "powerfully ran this country". No response to Covid as of yet, he has released felons twice on Fridays, he just publicly judged Mr. Biden as a non-Christian and you and I know that judging is God's not ours. Examples pls?
Biden not announcing his VP yet is absolutely messing with the Republicans heads. They will have little time to get their hate ads put together, nor will they have time to prepare Trump for any debate.  Utter genius on Biden's part.
It’s only going to get worse.   Republicans are selling America’s soul.
Let’s have a face-off!  All trump and Biden have to do is pronounce these words: Anonymous. Yosemite. Swift. Origin.  Winner gets to be Pres, ok?
So people are concerned about the fact that Joe Biden is senile, right?
This is his first term and he has done more for America than any other president in our generation. Check the federal registry! He is making America great! Either your living under a rock or Joe Biden’s ass is pressed against your lips🙄.
I will wear a bike helmet if I am riding fast, say beyond 10 mph. Or in a busy city like Chicago streets. But if it’s a casual, slow ride and in rural areas, no. Biden’s ride looks like the slower rural variety.
Joe Biden has one of the most amazing basements I've ever seen... and mine is pretty damn great.
Biden's first press conference should be like an episode of Oprah. Televised live and he should publicly fire all of Trumps Cronies.  "AG Barr, your fired, Postmaster, your fired too, Birx, your fired!" America would rejoice in that cleansing moment - and they all deserve it.
Mail in ballots should now be hand delivered to your county clerk. That is truly the only way you are ensured your vote will be counted. I cant wait until Biden wins and we can go back to having systems that work for Americans instead of for Trump only.

That's called the Affordable Care Act that Obama created and Trump has spent 3 1/2 years trying to burn down. Now he wants to act like it was his idea. He just endorsed an Obama bill AT HIS OWN RALLY! Nobody helps Joe Biden more than Donald Trump. See ya on 11/03/2020!!
Catholics don’t support abortion.  Biden does.  Case closed.
Listen to the clip. He did say it.  This post is the lie. Biden has already walked it back. Ah, the beauty of the democrat party, they don't mean what they say,  but they are able to imagine what republicans really mean when they make a simple comment.
So Biden isn’t allowed to disagree with the issue of abortion and a woman’s right to choose, which IS LEGAL, but the “Walking Sin Machine” in the WH gets a pass?
Who said I supported Biden? Fuck him too.
E-Mac I think that it's sad what has become of Joe Biden. Someone should step in and end this and let him retire in peace. I'm a Trump supporter and think he will beat Biden but he should not be running.
Yes.  Trump has huge scandals and isn’t taking COVID seriously.  At least I’m certain Biden would do a better job at risk mitigation of COVID, with better national strategy.  COVID is my biggest issue now.
China gained ground with Clinton and the Obumma regime. They are now up against strong tariffs and they are not happy. Of course they want Biden to win because they know the truth about Hunter

No one knows for sure how this is going to effect the voting.  Republicans think it will siphon minority and/or young votes from Biden.  There are just as likely discouraged R voters who don't like Trump, but won't vote for a Dem.
Thighland.  Brilliant.  Hope you don’t criticize Biden anytime soon—you’ve shit the bed on live tv more in the last 2 weeks than your depends can possibly hold.
The "you can't be Catholic and support Biden" has already started, much sooner than in the 2016 election cycle.  I cannot imagine the homilies we will have to endure in the weeks leading up to November.  It will be an exhausting 88 more days.
How’s your elite friends doing? We all know you and Biden got a dinner date to discuss the next plan and scheme. Just tell the people your all a hoax, people are catching on it’s all a shit show and reality tv condensation. Give us our government back it’s obvious both sides
Tonight!  Join Dr. Myers and Indiana for Joe Biden as we talk healthcare.
Idk why joe Biden’s managers let him even speak at this point LMAO. I hope to have the overflowing confidence of old white men one day
I wish you were the Democratic nominee. I cannot in good conscious vote for Trump or Biden. This may be the first year I won’t vote. I don’t feel I have a good choice from either party.
Yes Dan, unlike your Satan Worshipping Messiah, Biden is still very much Moderate. The problem with the GOP is, you’ve traded in your allegiance to Lincoln, in exchange for an Ouija Board for your Faith. Look at Falwell as an example. Good pic with his pants unzipped, wasn’t it?
Don't worry you've sicked Kanye on them. Joe will certainly never get a single black vote now right????  After all, you've done more for black people than anyone, right? and Joe Biden isn't Catholic, right? And Covid has disappeared, right? And the new health care plan is out?You got nerves to title your book don't lie to me after all the lying you just did to us, the American people!  OOOOH!

Trump will stand and answer questions from the press, daily.  Obama? No.  Biden? Never.  Trump cares about your Rights more than any Dem.
Stop pretending like Biden is equal to Trump and wake the fuck up. Think about how much better we would be dealing with Covid-19 if Biden was president rn. Thousands upon thousands of lives would be saved. Trump needs to be removed.
I know the perfect song to play for the Inauguration of Joe Biden/Kamala Harris- Move Bitch-Ludacris

But that would hold Biden to a higher standard than Trump.
My husband got told he was, “just like Biden.” My husband said, “Why, thank you.” 😌
So is Hilary and Biden. We are fucked.
If Trump is reelected thousands upon thousands of people will die that would have otherwise been alive if he didn't get reelected. Stop with this fucking nonsense, Biden sucks but it's still soo important that he beats Trump.
You're delusional. Trump is sooooo much worse than Biden. We have literal concentration camps because of Trump and hundreds of thousands are dying from Covid because of Trump.
Do you want 4 more years of Trump destroying this country? Because that's how we will get 4 more years of Trump. Biden is awful but he's still sooooo much better than Trump. Don't be stupid, vote to get Trump out.
It's Biden or Trump. Anyone that thinks anyone other than Biden or Trump has a chance is delusional.

Biden and Harris are the same-old shit with different identity, progressive rhetoric, no soul, and no humanity.  Will I vote in 2020? Probably. But if you deny this as a valid way of thinking, just because 45 is terrible, you have no clue what the working class is experiencing.
Why am I expected to vote for someone whose platform is on record as being "nothing will fundamentally change"?  I want fundamental change.  I want humane treatment.  I demand something different from what I've known my entire life.  Biden and Harris offer NONE of that.
I am not looking to be edgy, confrontational, or provocative.   My list of reasons to vote for a Biden-Harris ticket are dwindling.  What has democracy and capitalism done for me and other working-class people, that defends their lack of clear, pro-worker initiatives?
That one asks this question shows the success of a dubious canard against tactical voting that's been promulgated &amp; fed by the problematic myth of American individualism.   Trump's an existential threat to our republic. Right now, Biden's our best hope. That's all one need know.
Anyone who says Biden and Trump are the same are pretty much beyond hope, blinded by ignorance, agenda, or both.
I was disappointed that you were not picked as the VP. However I do respect the choice that was picked. I hope and pray you are asked to be part of the Biden administration hopefully when Biden is elected. I’m thinking the National Security Advisor, or the US

Do you think Kamala Harris was the best pick for Biden?
My state is full of them. I got messages from a few friends in my local LGBT community saying that they’re voting for Trump because Biden didn’t pick Bernie or AOC for VP. A few guys I’ve run into lately are Trump supporters also.
Unlike Biden! The GOP approach is Psuedoscience posing as science.
Excuse me! Biden used the Pandemic Response Team’s Plan! No bleach involved!
“Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum — every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing," Biden declared.

Which polls, and at what times during the election?  Because in the election I remember watching, Biden was so unpopular that he had to skip an entire primary, won in SC, and then had everyone save Sanders and Warren drop to support him immediately before Super Tuesday.
I bet you rather Joe stay in the basement after that performance today! I bet you and Fox want Kamala to go in her basement now too! Yall keep bashing Biden about a teleprompter, I can't tell, he's so professional. Trump can't even hide the fact he's reading from a teleprompter!

That confrontation may have clinched her the VP way back then. Biden imagined what it'd be like to have her on his side.
“She’s good on her feet and I think one of the reasons Joe Biden picked her is he had to debate her, and he knew it wasn’t easy,” Kildee said.
She's a woman of different nationalities! Which means she will pull votes in front every nationality, Black, White, Hispanic, Asian and many more!  Smart pick Biden!
😳 would you rather Biden tho honestly lol because both suck but Biden is like....yikes lol can we just get through four more years of red hats lol and probably have two more terrible choices next election haha
VP Pence congratulated Harris' nomination and was quick to criticize her position on several issues. "I mean, we all know, look, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left."
The fact that alternatives to Trump or Biden do exist isn't arcane knowledge, it's stuff anyone could just remember from watching the election or find out for the first time via 30-second Google Search.
We do. Plenty of progressive policies that get ignored, multiple progressive candidates in the primaries (Biden wasn't in the discussion until the entire field mysteriously dropped under him), or they're third parties "who'll never win" because They're Not Supposed To.
Joe Biden is a fraud that doesn't give a shit about any of us. Also Russia told me to say this. Clowns.
She didn't get traction because much of the Democratic Party sees her as a cop. Which she was. It's not that she was too far left - it's that she wasn't far left enough, and others were better at campaigning to the center (Biden, Buttigieg)
This comment sounds as though it was intended to protect Biden.
"progressive radical" 🤣 Sorry. Progressive radicals know Harris isn't one.  Republicans paint every Democrat as a "progressive radical" - it's the standard playbook. It's never been true.  I could not be more disappointed in Biden/Harris. Too tame. Still voting for them though.
I’ve noticed it’s all whit3 men who are refusing to vote for Biden/Harris...
I doubt that Biden picked her. I think she was picked for him by the DNC. I believe that he is incapable of making such a decision.
Biden was asked to commit to choosing a woman VP on live TV and said yes, then he was asked to commit to choosing a black woman and said no. Take that how you will. I'm voting BIDEN-HARRIS-2020

Because Trump is hurting himself more than anything Biden might say could hurt Trump. That's a reason to stand back and let Trump disgust voters. But it doesn't follow that refusing to debate is either smart politics or good for our increasingly insufferable political discourse.
For all of those that don’t agree about Biden/Harris, we all have opinions and freedom of speech. Agree or disagree with my Tweets is fine with me. Bottom line Vote! Be blessed 🤭🤭🤭

Did you max out your donations for Biden? Did your family max out their donations for Biden? Did your community max out their donations for Biden? Coz if not, they are donating for Trump.
Judging from the fact that this is the line of attack they're going with, Biden seems to have made a politically shrewd selection, at least.
🗳 lets go Biden-Harris!
There’s NOWAY they (DEMS) could win without flat out cheating OK this is a joke did Harris call Biden a racist? it’s true I think so too but what????  #MAGA2020
Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris as his running mate earlier today. What do you think of a Biden-Harris ticket?
Current mood of Kamala Harris and everyone that hoped that Joe Biden would pick Kamala as V. P. I know one person who got a Big smile on their face right now. And that person is John Lewis! O. K. John now help guide us to the promise land, the WH. It's now or never!Biden/Harris
I wouldn't be running in this race because I just declared myself Joe Biden's VP.
I've been saying I'd vote for a hot bag of vomit if it meant trump would leave, Biden and Harris are a way better choice!
They'll just deny it when questioned about it.  Apparently Biden is worried he'll lose California?  🤣
I would probably be MORE willing to vote for Biden and Harris if they did drugs, hung out with gangsters, and were sexually liberated. We love that real-world experience
Joe Biden should schedule a presser every day at the same time as Donny DollHands.
Biden/Harris Ticket are you happy with his choice? We are absolutely happy with this choice. We can no longer have the current President for 4 more years. So please! Let's alley out to vote on Nov 3 2020. We need 3 things on Nov 3rd. 1. Biden/Kamala Victory 2. Defeat Trump 3.God
President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was “a little surprised” that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, had selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.
That big boom everyone heard about 3 hours ago was all the republicans head exploade as joe biden announced his running mate
Agreed Biden isn't perfect, but worlds better than Trump. Easy decision.
My vote for Biden/Harris isn’t in question. I just feel so let down by this whole damn election and I wish it had been warren😭 but I’ll be voting biden.
The 46th President and VP of the United States: Joseph R. Biden and Kamala D. Harris
You do realize that you and Biden are  a part of the same crony and crooked establishment that has inacted policies and legislation that does nothing but further complicate and increase the difficulty of the lives of Americans. Especially those that you claim to be helping.
Real newspapers say Obama’s and Biden warned Trump about Flynn!
Nope! Biden already said he wouldn’t block prosecutions of Trump or admin!
Biden chose an ex prosecutor who laughed at sending single black moms to jail because their kids were LATE to school, sent countless Black people to jail knowing California’s history, and said she wouldn’t do anything specifically for black people if she became president 🥴
Biden said he’d pick a woman. Press &amp; JB considers a bunch of talented women w impressive careers &amp; skills.   Increasingly likely he’d pick a WOC. Press &amp; JB considers a bunch of talented women w impressive careers &amp; skills.  IT WAS NEVER THAT HARD TO PICK A WOMAN.
You cretin need to know Biden is even more conservative than Boris Johnson.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden insists he can unify a fractured nation, and he’ll test his theory with an unusual nominating convention intended to span the spectrum of U.S. politics.
Biden and Harris!
But seriously, no Biden/Harris buttons yet? #BidenHarris
Kamala Harris lmao, so they do have somewhat of a plan. Biden isn’t going to make it through a full term so all these Dems will vote for Biden to somehow win then push him out the door when he succumbs to his dementia and Harris becomes the first female president.
So who else is excited about Joe Biden's V. P.  Pick? We are Super excited and can't wait to watch Trump/Pence get the living shit kicked out them in November! We all need to vote now more than ever.  #BidenHarris2020
democrats “Fuck white people” - Biden ✅ “Fuck the rich” - Biden worth 10 million ✅  “Fuck the establishment and police” - Biden 40 year polical career ✅ Harris - Served as California AG lol ✅  “omg 😍this ticket” - democrats
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
She didn’t attack Biden.  That’s called accountability, something you do not understand at all
kamala is jamaican and indian.  Where does this help Biden
There is no reason to moan about the VP pick.  There were so many excellent possible running mates...I actually had three choices I liked about equally.  And the others Biden didn't pick could be useful in his administration.
Yeah I don't have an answer. I'm not excited, but I'm not about Biden either.  I'm for damn sure voting for them though.
So in case you all are wondering about Kamala Harris 's ethnicity.  As much as she wants to be African-American she is Indian - Jamaican. Poor Joe Biden as confused as he is mayb he thought he was picking an African-American. #mysouthbend
#NEW: Biden's photographer just shared this photo
You forgot Joe biden has accusers too. At some point you need to know dem and gop are one party with two ends. It's a big club and you ain't in it.

Biden-Harris.......for the win !!
It’s insanely impressive that the Biden VP pick did not leak to Twitter before a mass text was sent out. We really were all the first to know.
Biden picked Kamala Harris.  Oh boy, the base is going to be pissed.

NYT announces Biden VP is....   Warren and Klobuchar. They will share the role.
I’ll vote for Biden and a wet burlap sack with a dead rat in it.
Biden tells Rep. Karen Bass she is not pick for VP
Plans to unveil Biden's running mate choice are in place for whenever he is ready to announce. His campaign has encouraged supporters to sign up for text message alerts that they claim will be the first way people learn of the decision.
So we are at the point where Biden came out of the house and started passing out donuts to the press all smiles. Am I the only one who remembered Biden telling he was the VP pick but not telling us in 08?
#BREAKING: Joe Biden has chosen his vice president.   Now we wait, though the announcement could come as soon as today
That’s the guy Trump and Xi had locked up! He is a fighter for the liberation of Hong Kong! Now, I know I will vote for Biden!
Nope! If Biden wins, you are going to an American jail!
People are freaking out because Biden hasn't names his VP pick yet. Convention starts 8/17. Obama named Biden as his VP pick on 8/23/08....2 days before the Democratic Convention.  Chill out all you worryworts!
It's not that I necessarily trust Biden. He's just going to do what he's going to do.
Do you trust Joe Biden to get the coronavirus pandemic under control in the U.S.?
Nervously excited awaiting Biden’s VP Pick. She will change America For Good.
This morning Joe Biden tweeted that if he's elected president he wouldn't waste any time getting the coronavirus under control. What are your thoughts?
Men, do you agree? Are you insulted by this? Today President Trump said that some men are "insulted" by Joe Biden's decision to promise to select a woman as his running mate.
It’s cuz Biden is old, and he is essentially crowning the 2024 Dem presidential nominee with this pick
Explain why you think this is a 'prime' slot.  I don't see it as that great, except it is on night Biden accepts nomination.
Can Biden just hurry up and announce his VP already? He clearly knows who it is, or else he wouldn't be doing a big song and dance about the reveal.  I get the idea is to buy time until the DNC can find another conservative to run, but it feels more like wasting than buying time.
Why do feel like Biden's announcement is going to be all  flashy and like "I'm taking my talents to South Beach."
In contrast, Biden was already in his bunker.
South Bend's former mayor Pete Buttigieg is one of the featured speakers on the DNC's biggest night. He'll be speaking Thursday night, just before Joe Biden accepts the Presidential nomination. Kamala Harris is also slated to be one of the last speakers before Biden. VP hint?
I would say Joe Biden should pick Candace Owens unfortunately she's a couple years too young

Problem with our younger politicians is the ones who weren’t creepy were drummed out. It was at 1 point, a 3 way race between Biden, Sanders, and Warren. As we’ve learned, Warren only stayed in so long to hurt Sanders, much like half the field dropping at once to hurt Sanders
Super kind to call  part of the Biden family.
Seriously he’s really turned the last couple of weeks. You’re gonna see a lot of this though, as Biden closes it out and people figure out they have nowhere to go.
You getting more senile or just plain oh lying as usual! It wasn't the great pandemic of 1917, it was 1918. Also it was the pandemic of WWl where people lost their lives and it wasn't 100, 000,000 people! WWII ended in1945! If Biden lied like that Hannity say he's senile!
I guess you had to have been there. After the huge SC victory, Super Tuesday loomed, which is a very costly battle. And all the money started going Biden's way once black voters spoke. That's pretty much all the insight required.
He already declared that he's the winner of the VP ticket and will go to white house victorious without Biden.
For all the secrecy and speculation that typically surrounds the search for a vice presidential candidate, the decision rarely sways an election. But ahead of Joe Biden’s imminent announcement, this year could be different.
I'm voting for Biden no matter who he chooses as VP. All of the women are fantastic choices.
I would say it’s at least a 70% chance that Biden finds a spot in his administration for Pete. I like to think they’ll have a treasure chest of cheap toys like a dentist office he gets to pick from after every meeting. No sticky hands though. They leave marks on the walls.
Let’s not pay attention to the polls! Bernie Bros are trying to sabotage the election! Biden might be two- four points ahead! We are a long way from a landslide!

Joe Biden has already assured voters that his running mate will be a woman, but beyond that, it's a guessing game. Who would you like to see as his VP?
Hey folks, I have been cut off from the world for the last 5 hrs. Did Biden pick his VP yet?
Everyone should do as ex vice-president Joe Biden says..shot your shot gun at THERE knees...WAKE UP AMERICAN CITIZENS FIGHT BACK ALL RACES AND RELIGIOUS BELIEFS STAND UP ARM UP THIS IS A WAR ON AMERICA EITHER YOU LOVE AMERICA OR YOU HATE AMERICA SIDE'S ARE DRAWN CLEAR NOW
Jill Biden says that if her husband is elected president and she becomes first lady, she plans to continue her work as a teacher.  "I want people to value teachers and know their contributions and to lift up the profession," she said.
Joe Biden is likely to announce his running mate this week, and there’s renewed buzz about it being Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.  Is she a good choice?
I have a prediction! Biden will announce his VP tomorrow as a distraction to cover the Sullivan/Flynn hearing

In the past 48 hours Trump has announced that if re-elected, he will permanently defund Social Security. Vote Biden.
Something amazing about the Wilkerson is how it rhymes American 'wokeness' with Ambedkarite Buddhist liberalism. For Ambedkar IIRC we could have a nice meritocracy if only we destroyed Hinduism, root and branch. Makes you think about "Biden wants to hurt God" in a new light.
Oh, Mr. Biden: can we trouble you with a tiny Constitutional matter?
Starting... aren’t most of you clowns never-trumpers anyway? Flimsy as the wind. Why are you campaigning for Biden? Just shut the hell up. Nobody is listening to you.
I think Trump has handed Biden a hammer that he'll be able to use on him the rest of the way, despite Kudlow's attempts to backpedal. Dems have used threats to SS very effectively in the past.
Maybe their the only ones who believe China is dangerous and that Biden doesn’t care and is willing to take their money and throw Americans under the bus. Or maybe they believe trump is a straight shooter and not a snake like the rest of Washington.
As if this will go into affect! No Blue State will do this! Congress will shut it down! If the Senate goes Blue, they will override his vetos, If Biden wins the Heroes Act gets signed! The economy is saved!
Biden as VP was acceptable to me. In that case no harm no foul. However over the last few months his tweets have been irrelevant, incendiary, misleading, and pure B.S at times. His gaffs; almost un forgivable. Dont vote for this person.
Lol you must also think Biden is a smart manAgreed. Voting for Biden.
SUCH A SWEET STORY  You had me at 1992 tho, y’all met the year I was born. And I’m still into grunge music 😆
The point here is clear. Where there is internet, there is dick pic. Apparently a tit pic too, but I think that’s all talk 😉😂😆
Which means he's shading people who won't vote for Biden or Trump. Pretty obvious he's trying to shame leftists who won't fall in line with the Dems.
Did they photoshop President Trump's photo by Biden? He looks a tad heavier and angrier. There are subtle differences.

already saw a biden/harris sign in trump country
And this is exactly why Biden picked her. Any questions or criticisms will immediately be called sexist and/or racist. Well played Biden.
Biden, Harris and Dolly just go with flow to get the votes.
You're 100% correct!  Fake polls ... It will be another Groundhog day 2016 (Hillary was supposed to win) and 2020 (Biden was supposed to win). I didn't think that Media and Dems could lie and fake so much to the point where Dem voters disbelieve the lies. They're running scared!

I would think a South Park writer would not only be able to see through Biden/Harris for what they are, but would be funny too. Guess that's why I've not watched in years.
She’s not running for president. Biden is. He needs to stand on his own. Or will,u vote for a president whose VP needs to speak for him and protect him? And Trump will decimates Harris.
Oops-  Those are Biden's gigs...  Just saying.
If elected, Biden will step down so Harris can be President. Scary.
Biden-Harris campaign raises 6 million dollars in 2 hours after the announcement.
I agree. But Biden and Harris are both flaming liberals compared to the administration thats in there now. Think about your choice in real terms not in terms of how you would like it to be.
These are sick sick Democrats who will be voting Biden/Harris. Subhuman.
April 16, 2019 Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said Tuesday that she believes women who say they felt uncomfortable after receiving unwanted touching from former Vice President Joe Biden.  Wonder how she will reconcile her comments...
I would vote for Biden if he had picked Rin Tin Tin as his running mate. Trump has to go.
It is time for the American people to get a break, Biden/Harris will give us a fighting chance and see the country through the greatest of crisis.
This news is so huge. Kamala Harris will deliver for the American people. This team, Biden/Harris will win.
Biden can't even remember who or where he is most of the time let alone relentlessly prepared. Are you on drugs man?

Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket.
It's all good now that she can be President. All is forgiven. She knows Biden will never be able to be POTUS and she would be the real one. Dems want the first woman President appointed, not elected.
Biden will manipulated by the Liberals!  Rep. Jayapal clearly admits it!  The sorry truth is that Sleepy Joe is spineless, when he's coherent, which rarely happens in any 24-hour period!
The Establishment really, really likes Buttigeig. And old people like Biden do too. They honestly believe that young people will gravitate towards him, despite all evidence of the contrary.  Mayo Pete is what they wish the elite's failsons and faildaughters ended up being.
Biden the liar since the 70's his a liar, and much worst things, a no unscrupulous politician,
Biden IS a liar, a show for work do nothing, kissing way too many children, #SavetheChildren
Democrats don't care is the VP nom is qualified, all they care about is turning out the black vote for Biden.
They won't air Biden or that drunken Nancy Pigosi when she slurs her words, they could go all day with them two.. And doesn't Geraldo have a vault to open..
Biden thinks Arizona is a city, so I doubt he knows when World War 2 was.. But thanks for playing, I could do this all day..😆
Outrageous!  What has Joe Biden for Black People ... If anything, he has kept them down!
no will let you have the chance, how about addressing pedophiles, 47 yrs in washington and you never heard a thing biden?, #savethechildren
🤣😂😁😂🤣 that's some funny shit right there, millions voting for Biden... 🤣😂😁😂🤣 I have literally seen one location with Biden signs ..
Is that why Biden was riding a bike?
Biden officially endorses a criminal that assaulted a uniformed police officer and tried to take his service weapon to use against him. Biden is pro criminal
Umm, Biden and Trump supporters?
I would have voted for Biden if he had picked a progressive VP, had a couple of progressive voices in his cabinet, and/or moved on cannabis prohibition at the federal level. Small asks. But they look like they're going full mythical moderate Republican so he doesn't get my vote.
Are you sorry for what the woman that was raped by Biden went through?  You’re ridiculous.
They are. 13 of my neighbors (all seniors) have told me you were right in 2016. I regret my vote. He doesn’t care about us. Come November this Senior is Voting Biden.
It’s not. I am out walking my dogs here in Florida right now and all I hear from the Seniors is why did The President just turn his back on us when we elected Him. Biden has a new voter I need my Social Security and Medicare to live.
Trump you are so full of god dam shit Biden won’t raise taxes on the poor people just look at what your trying to do with doing away with social security taxes and if that happens you better look around every corner you come to because their just might be a little old lady cus u.
Because Joe Biden is not a child only children who are just learning how to ride a bike should wear a helmet ⛑
Our American under President Biden, who will suddenly disappear for VP to take place and suddenly disappear dead, so the one who would never be elected Servant of CHINA Pelusa would reign, They want to see America destroyed.

Something is wrong when white folks refuse to embrace diversity. I thank God for Black Lives Matter, they will help to elect Joe Biden.
Biden will enable us to become a full blown plutocracy. Trump is trying the same thing, but Trump is also causing civil unrest, which I believe is what will save our future. A Biden victory will usher in complacency and leftism will lose all it's momentum.
Reason I won't vote for him. This isn't about purity tests, I genuinely believe Biden will do permanent irreversible damage to leftism in this country. If he wins a dystopian future is almost a guarantee.
No it's not because I organize and put in work at a local level and actively participate in every election I can. The general election doesn't weigh my conscience as a leftist. Based on what he's promised, Biden will do the most long term damage to minority groups, that's the #1
trump - 🤦‍♂️YOU — that’s 🤦‍♂️YOU are  the biggest political crime and scandal in American history!!  We can’t wait until 🤦‍♂️you LOOSE the election to Joe Biden!!!!       (From Florida)
Right now it's Short Term Damage (Trump) vs Long Term Damage (Biden) vs not playing into a system that was never designed to give you a voice in the first place. I know my choice.
Option 3, Trump wins and in 4 years the Dems can give us a worthy candidate rather than waste another 8 years begging for scraps. I'll be writing in. Best case scenario with Biden still permanently fucks us in the long term.
I don't think Biden is going to make anything better, he's gonna trap us in for another 8 years of no change. Trump we can knock out in just 4 years.
you better deploy and start using your 2nd amendment and the so many riffles, so sad to have so much ammunition and loose POTUS, to a biden, onama, diblassio, schummer, etc etcYes Biden and Harris are going to build back better!
Look up all his racist quotes. There are so many. If Trump said anything close to what Biden does it would run 24-7 for weeks. Never just believe anyone including me. Go to as many sources as you can find. Propaganda is wrapped in truth so you can get truth from the worst news
Go look up Biden's history, especially with race. Ask why he can say Black parents want to take care of their kids they just don't quite no what to do and he would put social workers in their homes in the 2nd primary debate and no one says anything about it.
With a foreign power. Shut out your bias as best you can and explore things. Calling politicians liars has no meaning because they all lie. Biden is a liar. Trump lies. Stop looking at the personalities. Look at legislation. Majority of Dems voted for all Trump's legislative.
Do you not remember when Trump banned travel from China Nancy Pelosi went to Chinatown and encouraged everyone to come on out because it was safe. They said Trump was racist to stop travel from China. Remember Biden encouraging everyone to go vote in Florida. Poll workers sick.
Everyone take this in, it doesn’t matter that both sides are trying to fuck you with no lubeAs long as you remove Trump so Biden can fuck you too. #oops #BLM #nohomo4me
Your talking about Biden I guess!

Trump supported gay marriage long before he even ran for POTUS. Biden hasn’t evolved into anything. What a joke you people are.
“Biden Republicans.” Think about it. It is just a long way to say, “RINO.”   #MAGA #MAGA2020 #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
“Yea but if Biden is elected he will destroy this country”
“If Biden is elected America is doomed”
Yeh.Yeh. Biden is at least 10x smarter, coherent, honest, alert, better educated than trump could hope for.  So trump just lies &amp; says he's a genius. College professors remember him as uniquely mediocre &amp; unmemorable for anything else. One Wharton prof. called him lazy.
My mom is a democrat but like the kind that is *very* excited for Joe Biden, ugh 😑
I bet she   dont have an issue at all with the teachers unions going all in for democrats. They are keeping schools closed because of "covid" so teachers can stay home and campaign and fill out fraudulent ballots for Biden. Ask her about that.
For every one you’ve got of Biden, we have a hundred for Trump.
Trump doesn't want Mail In voting to happen, because he knows that more people will be able to vote that way, and a larger turnout is typically better for Democratic candidates (Joe Biden in this case). He can't say that though, so instead he's claiming that it'll lead to fraud.
Yes I’m a Biden supporter and have several police friends.
He’s spent his life abusing his political career to become a millionaire, further promote racial division w his crime bill &amp; other radical “policies”, sold out this nation to terrorist countries, spy on the US citizens &amp; more. Biden &amp; Harris are treasonous, racist democRATS.
Of course Joe Biden is Catholic.   Promoting far-right Catholics — the type that regularly attack Pope Francis — and their conspiracy theories as “some people say...” is bad journalism.
Watching  campaign on the civid crisis PROVES dems held up aid and obstructed Trump to maximize damage and pain to USA so they could run on it.    we need to run nonstop adds showing Biden against travel ban. Pelosi holding up aid. Cuomo nursing home deaths
One question are you voting for Joe biden. I did twice.
There should be an ad asking republicans why they are voting for Biden...
Biden/Harris administration is a justified hierarchy✊✊
Same reply she got from someone else... And Trump supporters are the sheep 😂 Either a bot or she just  enjoys plagiarism like old Joe.
Would you like to know how many right wing justices Biden helped get into the Supreme Court?
So like I said, I’m not going to vote for trump. But Biden has done nothing to try and get any part of me to vote for him. He himself has already bred hate into his message when he said you ain’t black if you don’t vote for him. He said he has no sympathy for my generation.
Well I’ve lost faith in this country years ago. It’s obvious it isn’t working, look at the pain in the country. Trump is only making the weaknesses more apparent as he actively tries to make everything worse. I’d say by them pushing Biden, it secured my doubt in the Dem party.
Our country somehow made the worst mistake they could to promote this man. I know that of everyone who ran Pete and Biden couldn’t handle what’s happening. Biden being notoriously hard on crime is abominable for our situation we are in. Is trump better? No, they are both trash.
Sounds like a great endorsement for Biden/Harris to me.
Snuck a selfie with  during this meeting with Christian leaders.   She said we were the first group she convened since joining  because of the importance of the faith vote to the Biden-Harris ticket and spoke eloquently about her own personal Christian faith.

Biden will be answering plenty of questions after he is officially nominated by his party. At least we know we will get truths and not fabricate lies like we do with Trump. What good is having a press conference if all you get for answers is lies?
Joe Biden's a joke.
If we compare the ratio or lies from Kamala, Biden, and Trump... Who had the highest proportion of lies to truths?
Already making up excuses for a Biden loss
My point, if you haven't gotten it yet, is you are STRIVING to perpetuate a system that creates monsters like trump, McConnell, et al. Biden is part of that system. So was Clinton. So was Obama. So was Bush, the other Clinton, the other Bush, etc. So is trump.  We have to change.

How many more is he going to magically scrape from his pool of voters? And think of all the ones he’s lost already. Think of the Republicans and independents who voted for him in 2016, who are going public that they will vote for Biden. Your candidate is in trouble.
Biden isn't even campaigning. His surrogates aren't doing anything either. I live in a purple town that leans heavily blue. I haven't seen one sign or sticker for Biden. Not one. Trump wins in a landslide.
Right so why is Biden advocating for a national mask mandate that makes no sense for large parts of the country?
So the new strategy is to congratulate leftists for getting Kamala Harris on the ticket (????) by pretending that “close to M4A” is progressive and invoking the GND (which Biden, the presidential candidate with fossil fuel execs on his team, still opposes)
I’ve seen thousands of Trump flags....still haven’t seen a Biden flag....
You mean: Trump plans to hit Biden in the only way he thinks he can as a last resort.
I definitely don’t like Trump. Kamala might secure the win for Biden though.
There is zero chance I will vote for Biden, because his record is an abomination to anyone who supports consent, is anti war, and stands firmly with defunding the police.
Can Trump be removed from office as soon as he gets voted out?  What would need to happen for Biden to take over immediately?
Rump could have lawyers intervene to try to deny extensions but I don't see his lawyers succeeding. They can also intervene in the case of close votes and recounts, or if there is provable major fraud. As long as we give Biden a blowout victory, Rump is toast.
Because lies are all Republicans got.

He’s actually right. I live in Kentucky, a red state. I have friends who are conservative Republicans and my friends are not voting for Trump. Five out of six are voting for Biden. I have another friend who has never voted for anybody in his life, he’s voting for Biden.
Hating poor people and letting them die is literally Biden's entire record, but go off.  This is a weird defense a New Jim Crow segregationist.
That’s the best you could do?? 1975. Biden made racist comments literally 7 days ago. Not to mention his long long history of same.
Perhaps, because, at that moment, she had center stage &amp; his mind was on what she's saying? It's called respect...dignity...INTEGRITY. I knew at the outset "a certain class of people" would see an opp to try to make Biden look bad. But Truth Will Always Be Stronger Than Lies
I’m really annoyed with the lefts stance of “don’t publicly question Biden/Harris until after they are elected!”  What? That’s how bad our democracy is now?
Right. Trump &amp; Biden are both shitty but a third party candidate has no chance of winning.
Actually, Biden is a well-educated gentleman with a law degree (not to mention a serious christian upbringing). Trump was a mediocre student outstanding only by virtue of his mediocrity. Biden stays mentally active  but Trump, morbidly obese, his mouth is his most active quality.
I am so ready for you to be Biden's AG and charge him.
yeah good luck getting biden to pass m4a. good luck abolishing capitalism from within capitalism (the only way to possibly divert the climate crisis). also love the just straight up right wing bullshit ‘communists have no job’ that’s literally 100% baseless...
They can't do it the next day.  But the longer Biden remains POTUS (shudder) the bigger danger he becomes.  This moron with the nuclear football?  He could flashback to the cuban missile crisis and launch.
Look people who never voted before have registered to vote. Droves of Republicans are leaving the party &amp; are voting for Biden. Trump has disenfranchised millions &amp; millions of Americans. They are ready to vote like never before. Unless Russia performs a miracle DT won’t win.
Called the Biden/Kamala ticket in July 2019. Just call me votestradamus.
President Biden will do. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #TrumpDeathToll170K #MoroninChief
Completely missing the point. Biden should start holding weekly press conferences so he doesn't look like a weak old man.
High praise Rick. Your  blazed the trail for more and more talented, media savvy compatriots to join the fight. I'm glad the Biden campaign has found some top-shelf SocMed talent.
If progressives/leftists are not voting Biden, I wonder if they realize you can't seriously push progressive priorities in a crumbled nation that would result after four more years of Trump. Nobody will be talking #MedicareForAll while fending off fascist hit squads (e.g.).
Did Joe Biden suggest a fart mask ?
Sedaris isn’t saying “Biden” is anything. Look at the date on that essay.
Outright delusion and travesty of ignorance is thinking Joe Biden is capable of being POTUS. He was the best you people could muster?!
Blame Donald Trump. He failed to take any federal action to thwart the impact of this virus, &amp; did nothing. Elect Biden so at least we can have College Basketball season. LIBERATE THE WHITE HOUSE!

Did Harris get Biden fired from the television show that he created? It's a lot easier to forgive a few mean words in a debate than that.  Besides, it's a tweet, he's not standing outside the guys house challenging him to a duel. Don't be so judgmental.
While like many other progressives I see Biden as having done very little to win me over on policy, I am becoming increasingly convinced Biden is in this to win it. I am pleasantly surprised with this aspect. #BidenHarris2020
Thank you for your service Mr. Biden your service is invaluable to the trump administration to give them the easiest election in history
I'm voting a straight Republican ballot Mr. Biden.
Team Trump released their first ad about the new ticket. In it, the campaign declares their new nicknames for the Biden-Harris ticket, “Slow Joe” and “Phony Kamala.”   What other nicknames are fitting for these misfits?

Sadly it means I have to vote for biden to see her in office but oh well it is what it is just wait till 2024 when we can elect AOC 😁 she would be amazing even Ilhan Omar is good too
Do you think one of those parallels, long experience and relationships in the Senate, gives Biden’s legislative agenda more legs than Obama’s had. So much, I guess, depends on the party composition, but that was always a knock on Obama’s admin, that they struggled on the hill.
I think the author doesn’t understand that Israel will always be supported by the US, but it’s obvious Harris and Biden will be less supportive than Trump
President Trump answers dozens of questions daily from a hostile media.   Biden and Harris have answered no questions from a friendly media since announcing the ticket.   Could it be they have no answers to our countries problems?
Simple, if you're voting for Trump, you only vote once.  If you're voting for Biden, vote as many times as you like.
He is racist. My black friends and neighbors definitely are not all the same. They aren't all Biden voters either. Of course Biden doesn't even think they are black if they don't vote for him.
“Trump is our last hope!” “Biden is the only way to heal this nation.”  Me: “Have you guys heard of Jesus?” “He’s eternal and conquered death. He’s God incarnate.”
What is sad is my black neighbors are scared too? I hear all the time how they want the police here. But, we all know that there won't be enough of them and our Mayor and Governor want the violence. Never let people like Joe Biden tell you all black people are the same.

I have to assume this dam will break eventually. It's unsustainable. I'm fine with team Biden playing prevent defense for a while, but he'll have to make the rounds eventually, and this really raises the stakes for when he does. If he doesn't ever, of course, that should cost him
Ooo, sweet burn, bro. Even tho Biden and Harris gave speeches 2 days ago, the day after he announced Harris would be his VP. Not in his basement.
That’s his point I think. If Democrats start acting like an opposition party for once they’ll  beat him pretty handily. 2 1/2 months should be enough time. Just don’t let Trump, who’s willing to run left of Biden on issues to win, actually run left of Biden. I would love to 1/

One of these guys believes in and has faith in God, and the other guy is Trump (who has zero morals, no integrity, and is only out for himself). So I’m pretty confident in saying Biden has morals. Do I necessarily agree with his politics... no, but he’s a better man than Trump
What about him? I’ve only said two things about him... 1. He can’t remember what day it is 2. According to Trump, Biden has more powers than the Avengers  I said I’m glad I found the person who determines whether or not someone is moral. Who knew you were the guy?
Don boy seen here backing Tucker Carlson bringing us the hot takes. America is, in fact, not movable. Physically, ya can’t move it. But Biden? Super movable...like a person. Hot takes, people, HOT TAKES.

Joe Biden is making Calvin Coolidge look charismatic. And Coolidge has been dead for almost 90 years.
That would be a great question to ask the people who shut it down. It was an unprecedented move. Considering the medical experts and the democrats didn’t even want a travel ban in the beginning. I believe vp biden said trump’s actions were xenophobic and racist.

congratulations!!! Can’t wait to vote for you and Joe Biden in November
Anyone who sees allegations against Biden but no allegations against Trump is not a logical person. Both of them have allegations; neither of them have anything proven. Why don’t you just admit that this is about party adherence and your “moral outrage” is nothing but a facade?
A certain part of twitter seems to be upset that Biden picked a qualified woman of color instead of a qualified white woman. That’s unfortunate. Kamala is not perfect, but no one is. Please stop acting like this is the end of the world. Thanks.
She left because she didn't want to cause more devision in the party she believes in bringing people together not separating them like you do and believe me her and Biden are going to win in November and leave you out in the cold
But the thing is, Biden voted for the iraq war. He spent 8 years bombing the middle East with Biden. He says that Palestinians don’t necessarily deserve sovereignty. Trump is outwardly mean. Biden arabs you in the back while smiling. Frankly, the former is preferable imo
The reason there are even cages for the kids on the border is because Obama/Biden built them. They obama admin also built more border fencing in their admin. There is no material difference between the two tickets. The only difference is emotional.
It literally does not matter who wins this election. This is not twitter hyperbole. The things that make Donald trump bad are the things joe and kamala have spent their careers building. Biden cut social security, authored the crime bill and so much more

OMG you are completely afraid of this woman and of Joe Biden their numbers are already up in all of the Swing States and are beating you by six points or more and it's going to be enjoyable to watch you loose
Anyone else feel completely unsurprised by Biden’s VP pick? Not in a bad way. I just feel like her name’s been floating around this forever.
Just my opinion but it will be one in a plethora of Biden political gaffes yet to come.
I already bought my official Biden/Harris yard sign.
Well the degrading of someone didn’t take long. Y’all put this together quickly. Must be spying on the Biden campaign.
Gross. As for Biden picking Harris, #FyouAndKamala2
NEWS: Kamala Harris takes the VP spot on Biden’s Democratic ticket.
WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket and acknowledging the vital role Black voters w…
With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden announced Tuesday that Kamala Harris will be his running mate.
#BREAKING Joe Biden has picked his running mate
If DJT doesn't make some of the mistakes he's made in 2020, he wins in a landslide, all bc the Dems couldn't get behind a candidate until late spring. No party can afford to be that far behind, especially vs. an incumbent, or in the case of Biden's VP running.. a perceived "heir"
I know of people didn't vote for John McCain bc he picked Sarah Palin as his running mate. Lots of people believe Biden is a "one-termer," meaning this is voting for potentially 12 years of the presidency. Let's say DJT wins in November... more...
Lol that's hilarious considering what Obama/Biden did
I mean she also retweeted joe Biden’s post so.......... explains it
Right on. Cuomo cannot (or will not) see the other side of the debate. His hatred for Trump blinds him.   Does he really want a weakling like Biden? Probably not, but he will never say that.
Biden busy hurting god this morning. Stupidity and desperation running rampant in the WH.
What a joke. You can bash and bash anything about Trump nonstop. But Biden is off limits? You just proved your bias. That’s why Obama never was pressed or under the microscope. Hypocrites!!!
#Vision Jesus Showed About Donald  Trump and Biden  #JesusIsLord  #Prayer  via
So are you to not open your mind and see the actions not the words of the republican. Yet accept the words and not the actions of the democrat. Stay on the plantation and enjoy what Biden allows you to have.
See again.
Lol an uncle tom huh? I’m sure this is the same in your eyes but try her out...
Thank god joe Biden will round up anarchists like this
2/2 you need to educate yourself instead of spouting msm. Trump got things done that Obama and Biden didn’t/couldn’t. Will higher minimum wages hell or hurt blacks. I see a lot of machines taking human jobs. McDonalds and wal mart has you working checkout instead of an employee!
Take a quick read of this and then tell how good Biden is and how he works for you. Note it’s a new york times article.
Joe Biden's controversial remarks about race this week risk alienating young Black voters who despise President Donald Trump but are not inspired by his Democratic rival.
U.S. intelligence officials believe that Russia is using a variety of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Bide election and that individuals linked to the Kremlin are boosting President Donald Trump’s reelection bid.
Biden's ratings are absolutely NOT skyrocketing, liberal or otherwise. All wishful thinking and lies of the lamestream fake news liberal media.
So now you know my friend base? That’s interesting. Keep deluding yourself with the Biden’s racist, but Trump is worse. Tell me which one helped black folks get out of prison and which one helped put them back in chains. Tell my why Rev Al snuggled up to Trump before he ran. Lol

I'm telling y'all gotta go look into   . We don't need Biden or Trump
Biden might be a child molester but we definitely know Trump is a pussy grabber.The Lincoln Project aren’t wolves in sheep’s clothing, they’re wolves in wolves’ clothing. They are just Republicans who don’t like Trump’s unsubtle ways of trying to achieve Republican policy goals. If they help get Biden elected, great. But don’t expect them to help beyond that
this kinda sums it up
#AmericasGreatestMistake is Donald Trump!! Our lives depend on trashing Trump 2020!! Joe Biden will heal America!
Biden is supposedly targeting Texas but you wouldn’t know it from Democratic convention lineup   I guess  and the  have changed their mind on Texas and  👿
Joy, please please please ask him why he’s not in the line up for the convention. I can’t get it in my head why the dnc is dissing him. I pray to God it’s not Biden, Harris or Obama’s idea. They can’t take Texas w/o Beto. I’ve been pissed all week about this.
Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake
First of all, she had an affair with Willie Brown (San Fransisco Mayor) to advance her political career in California. She also said bad things about Biden until once again she had a chance to advance her political career. BTY, the woman isn't even black. Wake up!
Trust me, minorities love Trump unlike racists Biden!
I think the fake news had him confused with Creepy/Crazy Joe Biden!
#LiesLiesLies #GOPLies  Jobs were not created they were regained, and Obama/Biden still created more jobs in the same time frame. You can easily do an internet search to find that.
I kinda feel like playing Electric Avenue the moment Biden shows up like that's his theme song is a point against trump. It's a great song.
Watching Biden speak and it's so refreshing to hear from a person who is so sincere and straight forward and a class act.
Joe Biden/ Kamala Harris all the way in 2020
Trump: Biden is beholden to the radical left!  Biden: Hold my beer.
You think Biden and Harris are radical? That they would bring Anarchy? Do you want me to help you build a bigger box to live in? Hoosiers, vote for you want to lead. Live the life you want to live.
I'm the happiest I've been since Barack Obama was elected.  Kamala Harris is a great choice for VP.  The Biden / Harris ticket will rebuild America.
I get what you are saying, but I disagree. If they are diametric opposites, then yes supporting both might be useless. Imagine society as a spaceship with people as the engines. It is possible that your desired vector can be attained using both groups. Not that I support Biden.
Democrat Joe Biden chooses Senator Kamala Harris for White House running mate
I am glad that Biden and Harris Dem ticket is smart and caring and they will have the ability to heal our nation!! Plus I picked this ticket combo last year!!

Joe Biden has a track record of disasters and racist behavior in his political career!! 50 years of doing nothing but causing divide in the country! Stay home Joe!!! You are not a good candidate at all!!!
Happy we may have a female VP next year, but I was really hoping the nominee would make Biden more palletable and not sour the deal...
Trump is so GD jealous of everyone, he spews lie after lie about Biden, Kamala Harris, and everyone else that doesn't kiss  his ass.  He makes me sick; physically sick.
Joe Biden was like “oh yeah, I’m ACAB”  A Cop As Biden’s VP
Fascinating point: Biden may not have gained a single Black woman vote by choosing the first Democratic Black Woman VP.
Biden names Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate
If I vote my conscience and America dies, 🤷. If you need my vote so badly, get Biden to adopt the Green platform.
Why is it that a vote for someone that isn't your guy is a vote for your guy's opponent? Wouldn't it be a vote for Biden, seeing as he is leading the polls?
This isn't the time to not vote for for Biden because of a VP pick. This is a matter of taking back the soul of America.#voteblueineveryelection
Joe Biden is a total idiot, damn i can't believe anyone would think or consider him as a candidate
But you want Biden. Your Alpha ha
Jesus, I cried. Thanks for posting. Indiana is considered a lost cause so we aren’t seeing as many Biden commercials as others. Secretly I believe he has a chance. Even here 💙
We’ve talked about this for a year. If Biden wins, he could resign and make Hillary  yea baby!
Biden could get thumped in central PA and still win the state if he can improve on Clinton’s performance in the Philly ‘burbs. Also he likely will win Lackawanna by more than 3 pts and may even come close in Luzern.
Biden done something that trump would never do, he apologized. But yeah, vote for trump or don’t vote. Jhc. Wtf.
Let this soak in, "Russia continues to meddle in the election to aid President Trump, using a range of measures to denigrate Joe Biden, intelligence officials said". NYT 8/7/2020.
If the idea is too siphon off black votes from Biden, the strategy seems presumptuous and laughable. I can’t believe there are people out there clamoring to vote for Kanye.
If Biden wins he'll have to sell Insta and WhatsApp for starters.
When is somebody gonna ask Biden what he reads?Absolutely not.   I’ve seen Biden signs, but not many.   I’m hoping most yards without signs are voting for President Trump.   Keep America Great 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
As I understand it, Biden is advocating 100% mail-in voting. To the best of my knowledge, this has never happened.
Biden will actually answer them.
Is it ok if Biden runs from questions from female reporters and just refuses to answer ones he doesn’t like too, or do you just put up with that from the “president”?
.   Alex Morse Speaks Out   Massachusetts congressional candidate #MA01  Plus Kamala Harris as Biden's VP #UsefulIdiotsPod
Let me explain the difference....he requested an ABSENTEE ballot, which people have done for years. What Biden wants is universal mail--in voting where ballots are mailed to EVERYONE.  Do you see how that could be ripe for fraud? By BOTH sides? I hope that distinction is clear.
I genuinely do fear that if Joe Biden wins, it will prompt many people to throw their hands up and pretend everything is different and better just because of a change in leadership.  Even with Biden in charge, we can’t stop fighting for institutional change.
I want to clarify that though I critique the Dem ticket, I will be voting for Biden in November, &amp; if you’re a cis white leftist like me &amp; feel comfortable sitting out when the fight is between a corporate democrat &amp; a fascist, you should seriously think about what you stand for.
To clarify, when I critique leftists not voting for Biden, I am speaking VERY DIRECTLY to white cis leftists such as myself. If you’re not in THAT demographic, I am in no way speaking on what you personally should do. That would be absurd.
If you don’t want to vote because you feel Biden isn’t left leaning enough for you just wait until you hear about this guy named Donald Trump
IF I were a Native American; I would not vote for Elizabeth Warren. I am not. However, I am a BLACK AMERICAN and I will not vote for Joe Biden. Hell, I would not vote for any Democrat. #WalkAwayFromDemocrats    #BLEXIT2020

This headline should really probably reference Biden. You know, the guy telling black people they really aren't black. Talking about beating up Cornpop. Saying black people aren't diverse. Hahaha. Oh, and during "Defund the police" asks a cop to be his VP
Don’t like joe biden but vote for him so i’ll have the same birthday as the president
Biden may not be perfect, but he's compassionate and believes in America and its citizens.  Trump is neither.
Poor Biden he had five (5) sentences to remember to say AND HE COULDNT REMEMBER THEM AND HAD TO READ THEM. He is going to have to face the reporters questions sometime. Last time he took questions he had them wrote down and someone wrote out the answers for him. He even knew who
Vote for Biden. He is not crazy vindictive
Pence: "Well I've got some red meat for you: We're not going to let Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris cut America's meat!" Be honest.  Do you not feel 100% safer now that Pence is going to protect his meat?   (I am becoming vegetarian now, for sure!)

Take questions Biden ... you must be afraid you will look demented
Biden is laying the groundwork for a Democratic dynasty. He’ll step aside in ’24 and hand it to Harris, at that time, a de facto leader. He’ll go down as a selfless savior of the nation.  In the meantime, Harris is a visible VP rooting out corruption.  That’s the plan. I think.
Biden picked Harris because she’s safe, but energizing. There’s no chance that her seat will be filled by a Republican. She’s popular with the middle of the party where most of the votes are.  Get that and you’ll get why he picked her, and she accepted, disagreements aside.
Joe Biden Choosing Kamala Harris For VP Is A Slap In The Face To Black Americans

I don’t listen to anything hidin biden says
Biden was always meant to be a "Trojan Hearse" for Harris. Prop him up to get through the herd He wins then they drop him. She carries the progressive torch and follows party &amp; Hillary instructions. She couldn't win on top.

Sounds more Socialist than Democrat, but unfortunately going all Socialist won't work in this country. Reality bites, get used to it, but don't blame it on the Dems. Bernie supports Biden, he gets it.
You used sex with a married man  to get up that ladder and you said you believed joe Biden sexual assault woman yet now you’re vice president with a sexual predator you seem to connect yourself with sexual predators I will never vote Democrat again
How can you be for America when the left supports rioting, looting, burning and torching buildings, closing churches, defunding police. You’re nuttier than Biden! Get you head out of your butt. Trump 2020 when the silent majority rises!
Actually I'm voting for Biden by not voting for Trump.

Wait! What? She is ready to lead? I thought that Biden was the one running for POTUS. Are you ready to fess up to the dementia yet?
You are absolutely correct. Following blindly is what got us into this position in the first place. When Biden is elected we need to hold him accountable for every decision. We need a bipartisan effort to fix this mess.
Joe Biden was part of an administration that took major steps towards making medication more affordable for everyone. Equating Republicans and Democrats is childish and lazy. One party works tirelessly against the obstruction of the other to give you healthcare.
I wonder if Biden, Obama, and Sharpton will be speaking at the funeral?
We won't know until the Democrats "find" enough votes for Biden to win.....however long that takes.
It might be a move in the right direction; if she was BLACK. She isn't; and she has done more harm to BLACKS than Biden.
Won’t be nearly as entertaining and the trump Biden debate
You want someone to o challenge Trump?  Isn’t that the role of Biden?  You calling for a debate?
I didn’t think I’d start my day telling a bishop to piss off, but here we are. Joe Biden is Catholic. Bishop Tobin is bearing false witness in this matter.
I don’t like either choice but am concerned about the impact to the second amendment rights should Biden be elected.
Listen, I understand completely that Biden/Harris is not the ideal duo to run the country, but can you really sit there and accept another 4 years of an evil, selfish, warlord running this country and slandering our name? We’re becoming a joke. Just shut up and vote blue.
can someone please explain #novote2020 to me, like i’m profoundly anti biden but leaving your vote on the table is essentially being complacent in the destruction of the country
Lebron appreciates joe biden for what? being a pedophile..james is a joke! TRUMP 2020

Lol we’re not excited we’re MAKING ourselves be excited and looking for the best. Gays definitely can’t have Trump another four years AMERICA can’t have Trump another four years and while Bernie mf Sanders will forever be my 1st choice he won’t be nominee and so Biden it is
Biden is the nominee, Kamala is who the people will not be voting for when they lose.
Who pretends their fav musician can be president and says this is reality. No dude, thats make-believe. Children play that. I dont want biden or trump, but im not gonna hype up kanye when he is having trump staff run his election stuff. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I knew #Biden was going to pick Kamala Harris #BidenHarris2020
To my recollection Pence has never been accused of sexual misconduct.  Biden has and Sen. Harris stated she believes his accusers
Who did y’all really think Biden was going to pick
😂😂😂  The DNC lost me when they anointed Biden at the beginning of the race. Now they’re just putting salt into an open wound.   Maybe  can actually get a chance next time around
So Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate?  Pack it up, everyone.   I guess we’ll try again in 4 years?
My reaction when I heard Biden chose Kamala Harris as his vice president running mate. #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP #KamalaHarris #BidenVP #BidenVP #BidenHarris
The only reason the Biden campaign is NEARLY as progressive as it is is because of the CONSTANT backlash and activism from leftist/progressive organizers nationwide.   Silencing them is to accept a moderate platform. I do not accept a moderate platform. Vote Biden, but advocate.
“Criticizing Joe Biden means Trump wins” I’m sorry but silencing people with genuine concerns for some feigned idea of a unified Democratic Party And ignoring the cracks present in the coalition aren’t going to win us an election. Vote Biden, but VOICE YOUR CONCERNS.
We should STILL VOTE FOR BIDEN however we should NOT BE SILENT when we have disagreements with his campaign. Ignoring the problems apparent in his administration’s picks for the sake of feigned unity is not going be how we beat Donald Trump.
It would be quite an honor had it been with an actual contender in this race. America is not buying what the Democratic Party is trying to selling. This race was decided long before Kamala Harris was announced as VP candidate. Joe Biden is mentally unfit to assume the presidency.
Democrats made a mistake putting all their eggs in the Biden basket to begin with. They shouldnt have shut out Bernie when he had tons of enthusiasm behind him.
Why does it still surprise me that Trump’s reaction to any news about Biden and Harris ends up being a sophomoric, sexist, racist rant about THEM being mean and/or disrespectful??? When someone tells you who they are by their actions...believe them.
How about her egomaniacal attacks on Brett Kavanaugh?  Failures as a CA prosecutor   Oh, she was bussed to school, and Biden was against it.  Just another political opportunist.

Is Biden purposely trying to hand the election to Trump on a silver platter? Because he just did.
Looks like the immediately popular pick of Harris struck a nerve.  And to think ANYONE in the Trump campaign has any moral superiority is laughable.
Former Vice President Joe Biden has selected U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate in the 2020 presidential election.
She’s more than welcome to rectify them and become more progressive over time however the core issue is that in an election where POC coalition support is crucial, the Biden campaign chose someone who undercuts whatever support he throws forward for movements like BLM.
🙋‍♀️RT  Raise your hand if you’re voting for the Biden-Harris ticket! #BidenHarris2020
This is just weird She called Joe and his policies racist, and believes the women that accused Biden yet she is his VP pick?
So it’s Biden and Harris to take on trump in the election? Good god we can do so much better all around. What a fucking joke this elections is gonna be.
Kamala harris running with biden guys we fucked either way
I just wanna know who in Joe Biden’s campaign say months of people on the streets protesting police and said “We need a cop as VP. It’s what the people want”

That wall will not keep out those determined to get in. It needs to come down in Biden’s first week as president.
Not one thing said here should be surprising. It was alsways going to be Harris after Biden committed to a woman VP. Warren is going to be charge of Treasury.

where you at? you hiding in the basement with Biden? Your players wanna play, make a statement.
Biden was seen riding a bike. Trump ever even rode ? 😂
BS. Biden didn’t want a travel ban. Cuomo put Covid positive patients in nursing homes. Trump offered help to the Governors but many declined the federal assistance. The virus fallout is NOT Trumps doing no matter how many times the media delivers this type of message.
and  vision for the first woman to succeed the first Black President, great on paper, not so much in real life. Not backing Joe in 2016 was the worst decision for our country Obama ever made. Biden was perfectly capable then.
Who is “tearing down biden”. All i see is most MSM hiding and protecting the senile old man that doesnt know where he is most of the time. If he was a conservative gop candidate facing an incumbent liberal, you would be demanding debates.
Its too late to make substantial change on climate change. You all fucking failed there. Marijuana policy isnt in the agenda homie. Dont play that. And biden specifically said, he wants to increase funding to police departments. You cant train police social workers and exect good

They aren't stupid enough to directly approach Biden. Their support will just be on social media like the Russian troll farms. There will be Chinese troll farms working for Biden.
But if the theory stated above is true it’s not really a selfish act. He’s intentionally stealing votes from Biden so his buddy trump can get re-elected.
Where have we heard this information before? Are all Democrats masters of plagiarism or all just mentally challenged like Joe Biden. #TrumpLandslide2020

Biden doesn’t fuck porn stars. Biden doesn’t cheat on his pregnant wife.  Biden doesn’t ignore the Coronavirus &amp; let 160,000 people die.  Biden didn’t deny &amp; ignore Russian bounty on our troops.  #VoteBlue #Biden2020 #FlipTheSenateBlue
donald trump yesterday said that Joe Biden will hurt God if he's elected president! Hurt God? Whaaat? Is this guy sane at all? Wow! This guy is a real "shiticus"
God forbid any group of players have differing opinions on how things are handled. Typical brow beating into solidarity of thought that Biden dementedly let spew out of his mouth that behind closed doors the Dems count on
Biden is a good man
😂🤣😂🤣 Hiden Biden is denigrating himself😂🤣😂. Russia, Russia, flipping Russia😂👌
Who thinks it's ok for Putin to actively denigrate Biden and promote   How can anyone not push back on a hostile foreign country meddling in our elections?  I know Trump wants to win at any cost - but democracy?
If Biden said he would unban tik tok if Trump does he would have a lot of boomers voting for him.
Then, why didn't the Me Too movement support the lady that Biden sexually assaulted? Are there 2 Me Too Movements? There is back-up on this assault; it was on Larry King way before Biden thought about running.
We really didn’t dissect Joe Biden saying people getting access to universal healthcare would be an insult to his dead son enough.  That man is willing to let thousands of not millions suffer because of some vague notion that alleviating their suffering would be AN INSULT.
Sleepy Joe Biden? More like sleepy michael miller.
Good luck with that #Biden
Pelosi, Schumer, Obama’s, Biden, Gates and all the evil doers and Socialist! Please move to China!!
Shouldn’t even be close!  Hiden Biden is going down
But, boy, is she giving Dana  heartburn
Joe Biden's 4 trillion tax hike will hit middle and working-class Hoosiers the hardest. We can't afford Joe Biden and the liberal Democrats!
I have a working theory that Joe Biden wants to lose
Thanks for the info you are sending, whoever this is (undoubtedly one of Joe Biden's "handlers"). Your boy is quickly failing. You didn't have this planned, did you people? Lol!
And while he’s blabbering on about nonsense, pissing all of us off, his minions are propping Kanye up to rob some of Biden’s votes. Bait and switch.
