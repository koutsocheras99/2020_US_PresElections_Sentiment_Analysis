Biden won‚Äôt last a full term
Obvious meltdown !! I love every second of it !! I bet him and Mika or whatever or Fuckin name is talk about trump ever night at home before nighty night !!!! What a disgrace they both are !!! How could anyone sane think that joe Biden could be President !!!
And you're a Democratic strategist? What did you expect? When Harris ambushed Biden in the first debate, her fans were cheering- she really got him! That there are those in Biden's campaign who haven't forgotten is no surprise. I expected this. Maybe I should change careers.
On the contrary, I would think that her eyes being on the 2024 nomination would make her that much more engaged &amp; involved in what is going on throughout a 4-year Biden term. A unique opportunity to be an incoming POTUS that had direct input on the previous four years = winning!

That‚Äôs why I feel they could swap with anyone. They lose nothing. Last minute ‚Äúhealth crisis‚Äù I can totally see it happening. I think there‚Äôs a better chance Biden gets replaced than Biden actually debating Trump in a traditional format on live TV.
They could run a god damn ham sandwich vs Trump and it would get the same votes Biden would.
I agree that they could swap Biden out. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any movement for Biden. Just the fever pitch Trump hate that any Dem can run on. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Biden gets out last minute.
This is all garbage.  The USPS has been in shambles for decades.  Obama and Biden had 8 years to fix things but did nothing.

It only matters if he votes for Biden and gets others to do the same.  A statement is just the first step.
So when Biden says something idiotic, it's a joke or a misquote, according to the left, &amp; evidence of mental or physical illness to the right. And when Trump does the same it is a stroke to his foes &amp; 4 dimensional chess to his sycophants. I just think they're both dumb.
Vice President Biden also wrote an op Ed for the New York Times at the end of January about the coming pandemic. Seems pretty prescient for a guy who is being accused of being in cognitive decline.

I never expected to see politicians just say screw it.. destroy what ever you want.  I wish I know the end game they are hoping for but even if Biden wins, someone will have to put a stop to this or citizens will and even Democrats can't allow that.  It's bigger than we think
Biden, will say anything for votes (like most politicians).  For 40 years, the guy has done NOTHING.  He is a puppet. The face of the Anti-American Left.  Americans (including women) are on to you, Joe.  Trump in a Landslide!
99 DAYS LEFT!!! Please take your safety OPTION and enroll in vote by visting:   Or calling :561.656.6200  EMcD with Joe Biden üíô Take action with us here:
One week until Biden panders and selects a minority woman to be his VP.   Won‚Äôt be the most qualified.  Won‚Äôt be the best resume.  Won‚Äôt be ready day one.   Will be someone who can check off a few boxes, because as we‚Äôve seen libs only care about what helps them win, not help USA
Swing voters in Michigan focus group say they are voting for Trump, call Biden a ‚Äòpuppet‚Äô: Axios Report
We already know that there will never be a Trump / Biden debate. Not even one.
This isn‚Äôt real folks!! The only ‚Äúvotes‚Äù he‚Äôll get are from other delusional people that probably wouldn‚Äôt have voted for Biden anyway. We‚Äôve got 99 days to go. Ye will have many other thoughts between now and November.
My latest Newsmax Platinum story
President Trump has done nothing for affordable healthcare for all Americans. So, when you hear that Biden and the left want to destroy our health care system, my friend, that's not true. Don't play into their political game to try to win the election because at the end...

AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
Neither does Biden.
Chris Dodd is a lot less influential than you think he is. The real power behind the throne is Dr. Jill Biden.
Washington post is lying again. Lying is not going to help your candidate Joe Biden.
Unlike Joe Biden, Trump will never condemn Putin for placing bounties on US Soldiers heads.
My Monday Newsmax column The Biden camp admits its candidate lacks the courage to lead
no way trump will debate Biden..NFW.....he's a moron...unteachable and lacks self control...Joe will destroy him simply by breathing and looking at him like the fool he is....
You are completely delusional. The person in charge is TRUMP NOT Biden.
üö®üö® ‚ÄúThe choice of Biden or Trump in the White House is huge, not just for the US but for the world generally to deal with #climatechange‚Äù üö®üö®
We don't need corruption in the White House we had 8 years of that before Trump who had to clean up their mess, Joe needs to retire not Trump. Trump has his head together, Biden needs to take care of his medical issues
Can Donald Trump repeat Putin, Bounty, Taliban, American Soldiers, without fumbling? When is able to stand before the American people and repeat those words then you may come back and comment on Joe Biden's gaffes.
Unfortunately, it is no longer "we the people" it is 'we the elite'. Biden was their choice, made possible by power alliances with major media &amp; others forming a narrative of relative elect-ability, &amp; people bought into this bc that's the majority of what was given to them.Prediction: Trump camp is going to abandon the ‚Äòlaw &amp; order‚Äô campaign for a bit since it‚Äôs not working.They will be throwing everything at the wall to see if anything sticks.Most likely strategy is to attack Biden as a racist/sexist &amp; attack the VP candidate to depress D turnout.
we got some former candidates raising money for Biden via ‚Äúgrassroots movements‚Äù and some just sucking cash out of Super PACs lmfaooooooooo like I cannot take the hypocrisy and headassery I‚Äôm seeing
I hate that we‚Äôve resorted to a 2nd primary- except none of us get a vote. I sincerely believe Biden knew who he was going to pick a long time ago &amp; this whole thing has been an attempt to amplify multiple voices. It was working that way until recently. Now it‚Äôs needlessly ugly.
It also would cost us FL. Old school party boss Democrats are this stupid. I trust Biden isn‚Äôt.
A bunch of old, formerly powerful and influential pol√≠ticos want their last day in the path of the Democratic Party. All I have to say is there is a reason Biden is still around and they ain‚Äôt.
Black people have been getting used politically for years by Dems to our detriment. That continues this election year. Democracts have put up the worse candidate for issues of impact to Black people. If you don‚Äôt believe me look at Joe Biden‚Äôs draconian record on black issues.
Good morning and TY Carmen!üôèüèº Happy Friday! üéâüçªüéâ
Joe Biden believed in segregation btw
So don‚Äôt go guilting people for not voting because the system is broken and it‚Äôs absolutely idiotic to think people should vote for the lesser of two evils and see that as ‚Äúprogress.‚Äù The only reason why Biden isn‚Äôt seen as negative as Trump is because his mind is so fried
What is it that Biden provides that Trump doesn‚Äôt? Both are against UBI Healthcare for all, ending foreign occupation, Free education, etc. there isn‚Äôt a single policy that Biden supports that I‚Äôm in favor for. Tired of neoliberals thinking people have to settle.
Guilting people using a mans death into voting for someone who isn‚Äôt any different than Trump ideologically speaking is disgusting. Name one thing that Biden is against that Trump isn‚Äôt either. It‚Äôs pointless to vote and to settle on candidates that are simply corrupt bureaucrats
Pure evil!!!!!!!!!! repent now, confess your evil doings. YOUR JUDGMENT IS COMING. YOU ARE NOT ETERNAL SIR....... YOU, HILLARY, BIDEN, BILL, OBAMA AND ALL OF THE ONES INVOLVED.
And just so you know Kamala Harris our president has been scared of s*** it's your little Joe Biden that scared and hides in the basement.ü§£

Fortunately, this can all be nipped in the blood If and when Biden wins Florida on election night.
TY for the tag fatal!‚úäüèª‚úäüèΩ‚úäüèø
Untrue! What really concerns Ms. Greenhouse is that there are any Conservatives on the Supreme Court! That said she looks forward to Joe Biden ‚Äúfixing‚Äù that by packing the court!
I would pay to watch Joe Biden debate Joe Biden.
Is Joe Biden capable of fulfilling his duties of President? If he wins,, will the Democrats exercise the 25th Ammendment immediately after the elections? Are they trying to cheat?
I‚Äôm still mad y‚Äôall really left us with senile ass Joe Biden to run against Trump I truly hate this country!!
Joe Biden, Jim Clyburn, and many other Democratic leaders said this and got hammered by Roses on here.
I‚Äôm far more concerned about another four years under the aspiring dictatorship of a madman. Come on man, if you were truly a Democrat you would have a long laundry list of why Biden is far more preferable than T
F**k off Bernout. Don‚Äôt slide in here with that nonsense. Biden is in excellent health. Bernie Sanders will never be President.
I like AOC. I like Biden. Period.
I'm not buying this... Biden won't run for a second term so the VP is the de facto 2024 candidate. You're gaslighting.

either joe biden or joe budden gotta change their names cause i always mistake one for the other in these headlines
I‚Äôm speaking of the Politico pieces that came out in the waning days of her campaign which detailed much of the internal drama. And simply speculating what Biden‚Äôs campaign is likely concerned about while vetting VP prospects.
Biggest concern with Harris from Biden‚Äôs perspective imo isn‚Äôt the debate moment, but the pieces on how dysfunctional her campaign was. It was rife with internal drama &amp; the staff leaked like a faucet.   The culture of the campaign is tea leaves for the culture while in office.

You hit right there. This was all about checking Chris Dodd. Biden knows they pics of his notes if he gives them a chance.
I support Biden's choice, whatever it is.

One of the main differences between President Trump and Joe Biden if he was to win, Trump Makes his own decisions while Biden will have to be told what to do.

IMO Biden probably holds Susan Rice in this regard. She has the resume, they‚Äôve worked together extensively.   The race isn‚Äôt close, hasn‚Äôt been, &amp; this gives Biden more latitude to make a governing decision before a political one.
If there‚Äôs a VP who would put their 2024 ambitions first &amp; undermine the President to get there, becoming a primary source of drama in the White House, Biden probably won‚Äôt pick them (contrary to conventional wisdom).   He‚Äôll go with who he feels will be a good governing partner.
have you two morons bought and read the new book out called "FALLOUT" ? Oh my God it exposes how scandalous and corrupt the Obama and Biden administration was. Boomerang boomerangüí•üí• Criminals

Karen Bass is a rightfully respected Congresswoman who is a great leader for the CBC.  She is not going to be VP. Leftists are propping her up as a hit on Kamala. Biden isn‚Äôt going to give away his lead in Florida and he‚Äôs going to pick someone who isn‚Äôt also of retirement age.

New story on NPR: As States Take Pandemic Lead, Biden Is Said To Weigh At Least 2 Governors For VP
Between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, it's like "I'll have the liver or I'll have the filet."
Actually Biden has a long history of being a nudist.  He always went swimming in the buff in the pool at the VP residence (despite female SS agents being "assigned").  With his dementia, I can see it now.  He'd wander out of the private quarters in the WH to greet child tourists.

Never Ending Biden Corruption
Dummy Mummy Biden#SimpleDonkeyVoters
An organized gang attacked a 14 year old girl and the trumpers think it‚Äôs grand.   We need Biden‚Äôs America a hell of a lot more than we need trump‚Äôs.
Biden will fix what you ruined.
Biden is not choosing anyone, his puppet masters are. Let's get the facts straight
The best ad you could air is a compilation of all of the gaffes of Biden in just the last months. The country needs to see what fake media refuses to let the people of this country see so they can understand how sadly his mental capacity has deteriorated.
Never ever i a million years would I vote for. Racist, rapist, pervert who is so senile that they won‚Äôt even let him do a real interview on tv. Anyone who would vote for Biden has a few screws loose. Trump has done an amazing job with our country. #Trump2020
Before Obama paid to have this virus brought to this country we had the best unemployment numbers in history and will again as soon as Trump is re-elected. This country is gone if Biden were elected...but the people of this country will not let that happen.
Oh shut up...your husband should be in jail for spying on Trump‚Äôs campaign. The evidence is very clear that Obama &amp; Biden was running the show. They BOTH had and have no business being in our government. The people are tired of your lies and corruption.
The silent majority are the Republicans who are voting for Biden
I want Kamala to be the pick, but as of right now the only way Biden could lose me would be to pick Nina Turner, and then I'd probably hold my nose and eat that bowl of crap.  We have to remove trump, period.
Biden has yet to crack 80% approval with blacks while Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election with 88% black approval  #MAGA2020

So...the [locally] elected officials is the ‚Äúchange‚Äù you‚Äôre referring to? We FINALLY have a wave of progressive politics becoming more mainstream, but Biden  isn‚Äôt a part of that. Biden is a STILL all about maintaining the status quo and i KNOW you‚Äôre smart enough to KNOW this.
They're losing just about everybody except for the Biden voters that are trashing our cities. But there's plenty of fraud votes combining illegals and dead people to make up the loss.
5. Within ANY OTHER time frame, Joe Biden and Donald Trump would be buddies...why? Because they respresent the interest of their privileged friends, policical/business buddies, and THE DONORS...NOT the American ppl, NOT the working class, and DEFINITELY NOT Black people.
4. Joe Biden‚Äôs entire campaign has pretty much been  A. Obama‚Äôs buddy B. Im not Trump  What the FUCK kinda marketing ploy is that??? THE AVERAGE AMERICAN VOTER DOESNT KNOW ANY OF BIDENS POLICIES because OF JUST THAT. He‚Äôs STILL an old fashioned establishment Democrat!!
Ok, lets go:  1. The two party system will FOREVER be bullshit if we continue for ANY REASONS other than proposed POLICIES  2. YOU cannot frame yourself as a ‚Äúresponsible voter‚Äù by supporting someone with an such an anti-progressive track record as Joe Biden
Buckle up, every1! Any former Rep that speaks out agst 45 will be slandered/libeled over the next 99 days. Have faith. No one believes it. Thx 4 taking the heat off Biden, even just 4 a sec. üíôüëçüèª
The sad reality is: in many ways, Joe Biden actually IS worse. This is why being socially aware of his entire political career is so important.

Voting isn‚Äôt *just* about winning or losing, but also what policies we condone...and supporting Joe Biden despite his overwhelmingly BULLSHIT ASS track record will only allow the DNC to continue to think we‚Äôll accept the barest of BARE minimums, AT BEST.
I have a hot take for y‚Äôall that i don‚Äôt think the TL is ready for; i am perfectly okay with Trump getting re-elected so that the Democrats can finally learn their goddamn lesson in thinking we‚Äôll support ANY candidate they prop up...cause Joe Biden is NOT the move.

I live in Eastern Central Florida and haven't seen a single Biden yard sign... Not 1.
I have been a Democrat before...I worked on Pres. Clinton's  &amp; Pres. Carter's campaigns;  I can tell you first hand that the m.o. of the Dem Party is to throw a lie against the wall to see what sticks...just like Biden calling Trump a racist,which is freaking laughable. U r sheep
AND...in case msm has not told you yet...the facts are coming out and Obama &amp; Biden were dead inthe middle of spying on Trump's campaign using phony documents, they altered docs. and fyi...what Nixon did pales in comparison to what they did.
You don't know what hell is...just let Biden win and let the Far Left Socialist/Communists take over. The lack of common sense in those on the Left is mind boggling. You will reap waht you sow. Trump had this country with the best economy &amp; employment numbers ever pre-virus.
You can beat Biden off? I‚Äôm sure.
What?  That is not how it works.  If they don't vote fairly regularly they get scrubbed off the voter rolls.  The registered voters in this state are fairly regular.  And they will vote for Biden over trump...
Biden doesn't tweet now....
We know if Biden is elected these LEOs will be assaulting gun owners' homes w/ flash bangs, tear gas &amp; live rounds to "hell yes we're going to take them all." They'll instantly stop being "Trump's stormtroopers" &amp; morph into "Biden's anti-terrorism task force" while you cheer. /1

There is also no chemistry.  Warren attacked Obama and Biden constantly and she said he was running in the wrong primary, etc.  Long bad history.  They do not have common ground.
I'm going down to Democratic headquarters tomorrow to try to buy a Biden yard sign to go with my Dump Trump yard sign.I think asswipe may have trouble in Florida. Yay, about time the old farts woke up.

Why is Biden even listening to this dinosaur?
New ad campaign?  Will it be scarier than the last one?   Will it be more frightening to those already afraid of The Other?  Will it paint Joe Biden as the devil incarnate whose evil minions are coming to rape your daughters and steal your wives?  If not, why not?
I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??

Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.

1. I'm going to frame this picture.   2. It's frustrating to read reports that people are actively working to prevent Senator  from being picked as Joe Biden's running mate. The most glaring reason is that they believe she is too ambitious.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump‚Äôs fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...

Hunter Biden got his big payday with no qualifications because of his last name. He is indicted in Ukraine and has other issues. If you and I did what he did we would be in prison right now.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
If Biden wins this election, this will be the third time in a row an elected Democratic President will have to clean up a huge economic disaster left by his Republican predecessor.
In November.........If we are not Riding with Biden we will "Dying with Donald"
If we are not Riding with Biden we will "dying with Donald"
The Democratic Party and the liberal media will continue to say that Biden is leading in the polls so when the dems actually lose but steal the election they will say  That trump was losing all the way up to the elections so of course he lost. MEDIA CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE

There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That‚Äôs the real question
I agree? But that‚Äôs not the topic here. It‚Äôs voting for Biden.  I‚Äôm not going back and forth on this.
That‚Äôs not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn‚Äôt VP.  That‚Äôs what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can‚Äôt even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I‚Äôve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We‚Äôve got nothing to discuss.
why do we have to chose between him or biden ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
You framed the question wrong. Shouldn‚Äôt it be, anyone afraid Kanye win the election or get more votes from both Biden and trump. No?
With its mismanagement of the Covid 19 response, this Administration hasn't shown the empathy for those lives lost during the pandemic. Seniors, especially, take note and vote for Joe Biden.
So if yt people don‚Äôt even want to vote for Trump or Biden than who y‚Äôall voting for??
Joe Biden is almost brain dead
Biden is gonna have a lot of shit to fix.
You have to love the poles and the numbers.... so tell us if you want to be harassed and damaged or do you want Joe Bumbles Biden?
This is who you want as pres? Doesn‚Äôt sound good to me.
Joe Biden for president!
Of course Trump believes that someone with a terrible record of upholding punishments for false convictions would be a good VP pick for Biden given this country‚Äôs current political and social issues. It‚Äôs like a softball for him during any upcoming debates
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!
I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden!
Says the person who‚Äôs candidate is JOE BIDENüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£
Would this be the same Joe Biden that wrote the crime bill? Oh yeah so radically left üòÇ
Well this Floridian never wanted him! And my Biden 2020 flag in my front yard gets me positive comments almost daily here despite I'm surrounded by a red sea.
mention one quality that you like about Biden. Biden is a career politician (strike 1) Biden has lied about his qualifications to be elected:  graduated at bottom of his class ,  1 degree not 3... (Strike 2)  Biden has made many racist comments over his career  (strike 3)
‚ÄúThe language very closely echoes recommendations released earlier this month by criminal justice reform task force that Biden and former primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) organized.‚Äù
Agree!  We‚Äôll deserved and we should make sure President Biden does it!
Obama and Clooney team up to raise money for Biden  #FoxNews
Vote for Biden and give him the Senate and those pulling his strings will have us as East Germany in a year.  You will wake up too late and not be happy.  But, too late.  How do you not see this?

He‚Äôs soo Weak - just like Biden and the Worthless Democrats
Biden did have a boat parade.
If Biden wins, he will be the 3rd Democratic President in a row that has had to go in and clean up a huge Republican economic mess.
Went to the beach 3 years ago n still got sand on my nuts lol I hate Joe Biden
Posted some "pedophilia bad" on my story, now the liberals gon swipe up talmbout "yeah but still vote biden" Bitch ain't noone said his name But fuck that nigga tho
Biden was a WRECK today
What a disaster Biden was today .. lol
Then do it and stop procrastinating! Vote trump! No commie nadler Schiff warren s Biden‚Äôs et al .
I love the Barr debates, it really shows what a bunch of idiots in the Democrat Party are trying to try and run this country . Thank God I am no longer a Democrat . Biden just said thank God  we must be alllowed to build this country , he did not add or burn it down
Based on the Anita Hill case, Biden being against busing, supporting the Iraq War and so on, I think the two are closer than you think on many of these.
Obama was even further to the right than Biden and had to be dragged into supporting gay marriage. A true leftist would in no way support drone strikes or indefinite border detaining
Biden is Reagan plus LGBTQ+ rights and abortion rights. They seem to agree on almost everything else (immigration, drugs, police, health care, foreign policy etc)
Barr is lying like Trump! Trump,Pompeo and Barr are pathetic liars who are just gaslighting this country to try and stay in power. We need an honest and non corrupt Administration! Vote Biden 2020
...whatever "progressive" is supposed to mean now.  Bernie Sanders is not a "progressive". Joe Biden is not a "progressive".
98 days to go! 16.5M+ cases &amp; 655k+ deaths globally, 4.3M+ cases &amp; 148k+ deaths in US, Don Jr‚Äôs twitter limited over misinformation, AG Barr testifying before Judiciary Cmte, 20 Days till DNC &amp; 27 till RNC, Biden rumored you pick VP soon SC Senate race tied. #ResistOnüá∫üá∏
I think he googled "fake name that's not Biden"
He said he was picking a black woman, not a fake indian, so unless she puts on blackface and fools him, warren wont be the vp...also Biden wont win...probably wont even run, watch out for Killary to take his spot by october.
If you werent so defensive youd realize we're saying to vote someone on the ballot and make an actual difference. If youre a Trump supporter just admit it. You dont have to hide vaguely behind "voting by my morals, which might be 3rd party or Trump, but definitely not Biden" lmao
You see? They got you. You really believe Biden is evil lmao. For what? Something he signed in the 90s?  No politician is perfect and you expecting them to be (or otherwise calling them evil) is a big problem in this country.
And yet Biden and eating shit are still better than Trump.
I can't tell if you're saying that Trump matches your morals (racism?) or if you're going to throw your vote away to someone that hasn't done anything politically either, like you claim of Biden.
But you see what's happening right? Same as in '16. The right knows Trump is a piece of shit, so their goal is to make it seem like the other person is just as bad, therefore it's a coin flip for some voters.  Biden may be status quo, but Trump sets the country back 40 years
I'm voting by mail and I'm voting for Biden!  Done!!!!!!!
You want to fix the problems of America &amp; Foreign affairs. Joe Biden needs an all women cabinet!!! Kamala Harris Stacy Abrams AOC Susan Rice Elizabeth Warren Val Demings Keisha Lance Bottoms Muriel Bowser Lori Lightfoot Veronica Escobar Jenny Durkan  Gretchen Whitmer Karen Bass
Poll this AM shows Biden up only Three Points in Florida! Come on people! What do you need? He and his sycophant Governor and Senators are killing your friends and family, they want to reduce your social security and Medicare, etc. etc.  use your heads!
Did she ask Dr. Biden about this? I mean the Biden's will be living there soon.
Biden - you will suck up to anything in order to appease the needy so that you can get elected and then you‚Äôll do NOTHING
Been seeing a lot of tweets talking about when Biden wins in November. STOP IT. Stop it now! Let‚Äôs not get complacent. Remember a few years back when everyone assumed trump wouldn‚Äôt get into office? Let‚Äôs not have that again. Time to rally people!
Don't tell me, you've been talking to Joe Biden...
Hello Gov. You would be a terrific choice to be Joe Biden's running mate and I hope he selects you.  You have an impeccable background and you would do great things together.  Good luck!  In any event, the citizens of Rhode Island are proud you are their Governor.
I live in South Florida and the same, not one Biden sign anywhere
I agree. I am afraid if Biden picks an African American for VP there will be problems. trump is a bully. And there are a lot of racism that is underground. Hell, a lot of it is no longer underground.
Unfortunately, you and your pal at the WH cannot provide the leadership that our state need. We need people like Biden who are decent human beings that put the well being of the people before politics. Your neglect has costed thousands of lives that could have been saved.
We don‚Äôt need to see Biden being interviewed. It‚Äôs more fun watching  Person Man Women Camera TV.  Stable genius
Then again I'm sober and I still wouldn't vote for Biden no way.
- this lady speaking about Biden is so wet behind the ears - She is right about 1 thing - BUDEN is going to need a smart VP because he is totally incompetent- Senile to the MAX
Why is this guy associated with the Joe Biden campaign? Straight up Corrupt.
There didn't seem to be a problem with Biden and Hussein in the same room, shootin the shit. ü§î
It's called respect.  Thank you President Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.
Cant belive how nieve people are not seeing how Biden is..hes a joke
I am not a Bernie supporter lady.  Sorry.    But thanks for finding that.  I don't see any super predator speak in it, but yea, Eff Bernie, and Biden and def HRC and their supporters.  Ok, now what?  I'm still not voting for Biden.  So ????  You want a cookie?  Just made some.
So?  What makes you think I'm a Bernie fan?  Because I said screw Biden?   SCREW BIDEN!  and HRC for going out with the super predator stuff.  Since you like Google.  Google me a video of ANYONE other than HRC, Biden, or Billy clint Clint being super douchie about it.
is kanye offering free hand jobs!! who else can beat off besides biden? will kim be there to watch? is that his election slogan. VOTE FOR KANYE, HE WILL BEAT YOU OFF 2020
I am about to make a prediction and you saw it here first. IF Biden picks Harris he will lose to Trump because as open minded as the dems think they are will NOT put another black person anywhere near the presidency.
Joe Biden....this is yo boy. Bad look....
And I'm proud to endorse you for Biden's SECRETARY of STATE! We need to clean up the mess Trump &amp; Pompeo have made of our international relations, which is just as critical as our domestic affairs.
And you dont listen.  I said I dont like nor support biden.  And I rightfully despise trump.
There is no truth to your rhetoric. Nice try, but I despise Clinton &amp; Biden You truly believe your side is 'right' while supporting an incompetent asshat like trump who procured underage girls from epstein.  Laughable. You're no different than catholic priests in your hypocrisies
I still think the DNC cheated Sanders it's no way Biden should have won Texas with no support there
Why bother?  Leave it for Jill Biden!
Of course not. Biden is Lambchop. The only question is to find out who is playing the political role of Sherry Lewis.
we'll ask president biden to look into it...
Trump special, West special, Biden ordinary #vision2020
I‚Äôm sad to say that that is true.  Biden may have the advantage as of now, but trumpers &amp; trump will do anything to make sure he stays in our White House. #Vote
‚ÄúTrump is weak, Trump is not conservative,‚Äù Barkhuff said. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs the most easily fixable problem in America today. A vote for Joe Biden in this election is a vote for our Constitution.‚Äù
Biden found time to coach his late  son Beau's baseball team when he was a commuting senator!! Can you imagine Trump doing that??!!
Biden can't talk his way out of a paper bag! I'm terrified that Biden is going to possibly get another chance to implement Osama Obama's failed, self serving, America destroying policies! #Trump2020LandslideVictory
More if he gets a second term. He will get that. Too many ppl on the left think, why vote? I've got things to do. Someone else will do it. Then you just voted for Trump. Ppl have to vote Biden. And senators as well.
Been asking that since you became President. I guess we will have to wait until Biden takes over and the real investigations of your corruption begin.
Biden-Bottoms doesn't have a good ring to it
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Obviously ur not a true democrat bc if you were, you would be questioning A&amp; speaking out against Pelosi, Schumer, Waters and the idiots like AOC.  Biden is a puppet who can‚Äôt remember what office he‚Äôs running for, can‚Äôt remember his wife from his sister. He can‚Äôt remember shit!
Where is the justice for you ignoring the constitution, getting foreign governments to help you win an election, blackmaing Ukraine for dirt on Biden and obstructing investigations and telling admin to ignore subpoenas. So much for LAW &amp; ORDER!  Such a loser. No winning for you!!
Those who hate Trump are going to think that regardless.  The people who are undecided will side w/ Biden if he doesn‚Äôt restore order and side w/ Trump if he does.  Those who love Trump may jump off the Trump train if he lets this continue.  THERE ARE NO CONS TO RESTORING ORDER..
No worries, as soon as Biden is in office he'll be back to screaming about government overreach.
2/x Furthermore, I don't judge my candidates by who else is voting for them, but instead by their policies. There are actual violent Marxists who support Biden but I will only judge Biden on his political platform.
Reverse the polls saying Biden 62% and Pres 38 such BS
Part of Joe Biden's Inaugural speech will be "I will tear down this wall"!
Omg.  As Biden would say, that‚Äôs a bunch of malarkey.  üôÑ
#Trump2020 Mr president you must win Florida send your best people. We can‚Äôt let Biden win
Is that why Biden is up in ALL polls!  You're going down DUMPY!Man, Democrats are a tough crowd. Biden always said he was announcing his VP choice sometime in early August. It's July 31st and he's getting dragged.

Ridiculous and obnoxious that this kind of misogyny is still rampant.  is an outstanding and qualified VP candidate.  should definitely pick her. #KamalaHarris #joebiden #BidenHarris2020 #Biden #kamala
Why is Biden even listening to this dinosaur?
Not a single Bernie supporter could ever stomach Donald Trump, and Joe Biden is about as centrist as it gets.  Apparently saying someone is a leftist is all the fear mongering conservatives need to shit the bed.
Think about this.  Biden is ahead by close to ten points nationally and leading in every swing state and he hasn't announced his VP candidate yet.  Look for a bounce this week.  Now the campaign needs to concentrate on getting out the vote.
Never happen Mr Biden
Anyone Joe Biden picks to be his Vice President will be a million times better than Mike Pence. Let‚Äôs all keep that in mind.
Barr Durham really messed this up.  So many should have been indicated with what we know already. Now we endanger the Republic by allowing absolute criminals or treasonists to be on a ticket for a national party.   dug up the goods on Joe Biden. Barr won't go there

Joe Biden didn't create his job. The people of Delaware kept employing him, then an overwhelming number of Americans sent him and his boss to DC twice. We're about to hire him again. Trump found jobs for his daughter, son in law, daughter in law, Rudy's son, Barr's daughter, etc.

I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden said he wasn't announcing until August. The guessing games are on us.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
Biden/Beto would have been the ultimate!!! Beto 2024!
Actually, it‚Äôs not settling.  If Biden is elected, and he probably will be, he will be too cognitively impaired time be anything but a figurehead.  Assuming the Dems sweep, the progressives will be in charge.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
Bottom line, all those protesters are voting for Biden. And they don‚Äôt like that...

Wow, You know President Obama and President Biden along with VP Kamala Harris absolutely had nothing at all ever to do with Trump's Best pedophile friends of Epstein,Maxwell and Dershowitz.  Trump even brought Ivanka into the "friendship"!
Sorry but in this case Biden and medical experts including psychologists are calling this one.  How many parents don‚Äôt want to wear masks either? They  put their children in danger every day.  56% might want to send their kids back to school but that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre right.
And trumptards are complaining that John Lewis‚Äôs funeral was a Biden campaign rally?  We need to brace ourselves for the constant refrain ‚Äúthe postal service is incompetent.‚Äù He‚Äôs going to hit us with that like he did with ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù Say it enough that your followers believe it

idea of a solution. I don't need to trash Trump to make my point. But whatever Trump sees when he looks in the mirror, and what Trump claims to see when he looks at Joe Biden are so far away from the reality.
It is amazing how little self-awareness Trump has that he would call Biden a "buffoon". Biden is self-effacing, humble, humorous, riant, generous, spirited, fit, loving, a goofy grandpop, a kind (if not overly permissive) father, a supportive &amp; proud husband. His friendships are

It is my observation that Biden supports China fully, Why? They do not Want a strong President like Trump, so they are Financing Sleepy Joe &amp; the Dems fully against Trump, so they can continue to abuse our USA and the world. #MAGA2020! They are in for a big surprise!
It is my observation that Biden supports China fully Why? Because they are Financing the Dems because China wants to get rid of the only  President with what it takes to deal with them properly...Sleepy Joe cannot and will not.
Barack Obama forgets he is no longer President! How inappropriate to use a funeral to make a political statement! Biden is the one running. Tell him to come out of the basement and start facing the public! #ObamaIsNotRunning
Silent majority used to be independents and republicans voting for Biden. Now that MAGA hijacked the name, lets call them what they really are what they really are ‚ÄúLOUD MINORITY‚Äù
The Joe Biden narrative that's being pushed is ridiculous &amp;cruel. I'd like to see someone bury a child&amp;not take the opportunity to show affection. Not everyone is comfortable w/physicality &amp; maybe he erred by being inconsiderate but the sexualizing's being done by the storyteller
Exactly. Any vote for Biden is a ‚Äúfraudulent vote‚Äù. I‚Äôm happy to be a fraudulent voter in that case.
If Joe Biden feels that she is the best choice to help him Build Back Better, then no one should stand in the way. I believe in Kamala and if she were VP then she would absolutely make all of us proud.
1. I'm going to frame this picture.   2. It's frustrating to read reports that people are actively working to prevent Senator  from being picked as Joe Biden's running mate. The most glaring reason is that they believe she is too ambitious.
As I said, Biden's quote was "poor people are just a smart as white people"  You cant get more racist than that, or maybe you can, the Biden Quote, "You have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-11"
Obama is giving a campaign speech for Biden. ü§Æ He‚Äôs also pointing out Islam‚Äôs goal -no matter how long it takes -to change ALL Americans to accept the tenets of ONLY Islam.  Sounds like the Dem party/Progressives today to REMAKE America.

They need to retire Biden, embarrassing for his family.
Nonsense, he banned travel from China immediately, and if You or any Democrat were in charge, we would have the Virus hitting US from 50 different Countries and we'd all be dead...It can still happen if you and Biden win.

Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
I can‚Äôt even fathom why Biden would pick Kamala. Could there be a worse VP pick?
For most, trump lowered personal income tax for everyone. Voters have to determine if a) taxes are their priority b) if you have a job now, are you confident that you‚Äôll keep it with trump/Biden c) if you don‚Äôt have a job will you get one with trump/Biden
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
Mark Levin  covered this on his show and it stopped me in my tracks, as I was in a state of shock learning about the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. They would file lawsuits against suburbs and tax payers are the ones that foot the bill. Thank you again Mr. President! #MAGA
You framed the question wrong. Shouldn‚Äôt it be, anyone afraid Kanye win the election or get more votes from both Biden and trump. No?
Kamala Harris is very ambitious. People who run for president usually are - Joe Biden 2020 notwithstanding. (He‚Äôs trying to rescue America.) That in and of itself should not be disqualifying. What are they really concerned about?
That would be Obama and Biden.......
Still didn‚Äôt answer! Of course for Biden lol joke
Drivers, start your engines! #Finance #investing #NYSE #NASDAQ
? Trump will never leave office, period. Biden will win but trump and his lackey Barr, will not obey the will of the people. So, looks like Trump will not leave whether Lincoln Merch is sold or not. Ridiculous theory.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden because I believe he is a decent man and I trust him to build a team of good decision makers around him. I‚Äôm sacrificing my policy views and possibly certain financial interests for what I believe is country over party. Full stop.
Coward Liar Dotard Trump attacks the FEC by not making appointments as directed by his master Putin. So everyone the FEC helps should vote for Joe Biden for president, and NOT Dotard Trump and Vlad Putin who believes he's our real president.

Joe Biden is almost brain dead
If you want the USA to be like Chicago,LA, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, St. Louis, Mineappolis, then vote Biden. If he ever comes out of the basement.
Respectfully, you‚Äôre barking up the wrong tree. There is no objective metric that would have trump being a better fit for the country than Biden. Did you know that On average, Democratic presidents grew the economy 4.4% each year versus 2.5% for Republicans since Truman?
This is who you want as pres? Doesn‚Äôt sound good to me.
Joe Biden for president!
Of course Trump believes that someone with a terrible record of upholding punishments for false convictions would be a good VP pick for Biden given this country‚Äôs current political and social issues. It‚Äôs like a softball for him during any upcoming debates
Are we talking about the same Joe Biden who passed bills and yelled on the senate floor (about black people) "LOCK EM UP" That Joe Biden?
So,  basically,  Biden will lie or conceal his true intentions in order to get elected? D--n,  this politics business is hard work!
Essential that if Biden is told to add Harris or Warren as VP that Republicans pound home that Biden has already told us he won't do a whole term and the VP will essentially be President.  Could be in the first year.
Now if you‚Äôd actually read ANY on Biden‚Äôs plans we could have an adult discussion, but that obviously out if the question
That is what concerns me about the upcoming election. I left the Democrat Party several years ago as I believed then and continue to believe now that the Democrats biggest problem is the Democrats. I will however vote for Biden
Biden's notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris  via
Respectfully, the Democrats dont plan on giving him anything. He will be like a hamster in a cage running on a wheel.  They are/will control EVERYTHING he does.  A vote for Biden is a vote for a group of left interest groups pulling the strings.
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!
It will be essential for Republicans to refer whomever pathetic Joe Biden is told to take on board as "Ms. President."  Let people know every minute of every day that he will NOT be President, but she will within a year when he resigns for health reasons.
BIDEN DOES NOT WANT TO DEFUND THE POLICE. STOP LYING!!!

Sure and Biden without a track record is more qualified. Not happening. Trump 2020.
It is sad that the left is using Biden as a puppet when clearly he is not well just because they hate Trump so much. #WakeUpAmerica
mention one quality that you like about Biden. Biden is a career politician (strike 1) Biden has lied about his qualifications to be elected:  graduated at bottom of his class ,  1 degree not 3... (Strike 2)  Biden has made many racist comments over his career  (strike 3)

Biden didn‚Äôt win on policy, he won bc the DNC and Obama made an incredible Hail Mary and got everyone who wasn‚Äôt Sanders to drop out and support Biden. I‚Äôm not even mad, it was amazing. Attributing that win to Biden‚Äôs platform is a mistake, the policy being complete shit aside
Why do you continue to conflate Biden votes as votes against M4A? I‚Äôm guessing that there is no moral or financial argument that can be made so you are making a strategic one, yet M4A is overwhelmingly popular. You already identified why ppl voted Biden and it isn‚Äôt the ACA

Mr. Biden You can‚Äôt be trusted. You talk out of both sides of your mouth ALL THE TIME. You lie constantly, the Covid numbers are so clearly inflated and easy to prove, your record going back forty years on race is appalling, You all but say you don‚Äôt want ‚Äú them‚Äù on your block.

What a disaster Biden was today .. lol
Lets not confuse a Biden vote as a vote against M4A: like you said, most ppl voted bc Biden was perceived as the best to beat trump, and then a majority in every state said they were for M4A I‚Äôm exit polls, a fact every Sanders supporter is acutely aware of
Joe Biden has to read aloud the reporters name to next ask a question? There's only about 8 people there?
Wooden, stilted, rehearsed! I‚Äôm Joe Biden and I support this message!!!
My Takeaway from todays "Hearing" 1) Democrats have gone over the edge, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!  2) Republicans have all but given up in this "Fight"  3) AG Barr has the nerves of a SAINT.  4) Swalwell is still the laughing stock of the Democrats.  5) If Biden wins, we're F'ed!
Switching between Biden's "Press conference" and the Democrat "hearing" is like switching back and forth between the hot tub and the freezing pool.  One second you're boiling with anger, the next you're falling asleep.

It‚Äôs rare that he sticks his head up. They told Biden, ‚ÄúHey Barr is killing us, hurry up and get out the basement‚Äù.
should you take reporter questions like Biden from friends who are taken quietly in order with scripted questions? What is this crap?
I love the Barr debates, it really shows what a bunch of idiots in the Democrat Party are trying to try and run this country . Thank God I am no longer a Democrat . Biden just said thank God  we must be alllowed to build this country , he did not add or burn it down
has stated he wants your kids taught Islam in school.   Islam promotes violence &amp; hatred, no thanks Joe.  If you want China ripping us off he is especially good at that.  Do you want  telling you what to do, vote Biden.  If Biden gets in were doomed!
Based on the Anita Hill case, Biden being against busing, supporting the Iraq War and so on, I think the two are closer than you think on many of these.
Obama was even further to the right than Biden and had to be dragged into supporting gay marriage. A true leftist would in no way support drone strikes or indefinite border detaining
Biden is Reagan plus LGBTQ+ rights and abortion rights. They seem to agree on almost everything else (immigration, drugs, police, health care, foreign policy etc)
Barr is lying like Trump! Trump,Pompeo and Barr are pathetic liars who are just gaslighting this country to try and stay in power. We need an honest and non corrupt Administration! Vote Biden 2020

If you werent so defensive youd realize we're saying to vote someone on the ballot and make an actual difference. If youre a Trump supporter just admit it. You dont have to hide vaguely behind "voting by my morals, which might be 3rd party or Trump, but definitely not Biden" lmao
You see? They got you. You really believe Biden is evil lmao. For what? Something he signed in the 90s?  No politician is perfect and you expecting them to be (or otherwise calling them evil) is a big problem in this country.
And yet Biden and eating shit are still better than Trump.
I can't tell if you're saying that Trump matches your morals (racism?) or if you're going to throw your vote away to someone that hasn't done anything politically either, like you claim of Biden.
But you see what's happening right? Same as in '16. The right knows Trump is a piece of shit, so their goal is to make it seem like the other person is just as bad, therefore it's a coin flip for some voters.  Biden may be status quo, but Trump sets the country back 40 years

Exactly. Any vote for Biden is a ‚Äúfraudulent vote‚Äù. I‚Äôm happy to be a fraudulent voter in that case.
If Joe Biden feels that she is the best choice to help him Build Back Better, then no one should stand in the way. I believe in Kamala and if she were VP then she would absolutely make all of us proud.
1. I'm going to frame this picture.   2. It's frustrating to read reports that people are actively working to prevent Senator  from being picked as Joe Biden's running mate. The most glaring reason is that they believe she is too ambitious.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump‚Äôs fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...

Hunter Biden got his big payday with no qualifications because of his last name. He is indicted in Ukraine and has other issues. If you and I did what he did we would be in prison right now.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
"You're not black on the inside. I'm more black than you on the inside."  see also: "You ain't black" - Biden
i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
If Biden wins this election, this will be the third time in a row an elected Democratic President will have to clean up a huge economic disaster left by his Republican predecessor.
In November.........If we are not Riding with Biden we will "Dying with Donald"
If we are not Riding with Biden we will "dying with Donald"

If you werent so defensive youd realize we're saying to vote someone on the ballot and make an actual difference. If youre a Trump supporter just admit it. You dont have to hide vaguely behind "voting by my morals, which might be 3rd party or Trump, but definitely not Biden" lmao
You see? They got you. You really believe Biden is evil lmao. For what? Something he signed in the 90s?  No politician is perfect and you expecting them to be (or otherwise calling them evil) is a big problem in this country.
And yet Biden and eating shit are still better than Trump.
I can't tell if you're saying that Trump matches your morals (racism?) or if you're going to throw your vote away to someone that hasn't done anything politically either, like you claim of Biden.
But you see what's happening right? Same as in '16. The right knows Trump is a piece of shit, so their goal is to make it seem like the other person is just as bad, therefore it's a coin flip for some voters.  Biden may be status quo, but Trump sets the country back 40 years
I'm voting by mail and I'm voting for Biden!  Done!!!!!!!
Its like the Trump v Biden debates.. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.
Sorry, i might have used the wrong word. Delayed for now. But this smells like the Biden debates, if you ask me.
Poll this AM shows Biden up only Three Points in Florida! Come on people! What do you need? He and his sycophant Governor and Senators are killing your friends and family, they want to reduce your social security and Medicare, etc. etc.  use your heads!
You already had your opportunity. We saw the Obama-Biden Administration! What‚Äôs different now?

...Hunter Biden‚Äôs extensive international travel during the Obama-Biden presidency, including at least 5 trips to China, will raise additional questions.‚Äù said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. Read:   #DrainTheSwamp #MAGA  #WeThePeople

Judicial Watch announced it received records from the U.S. Secret Service showing that, for the first five and a half years of the #Obama administration, Hunter #Biden traveled extensively while receiving a #SecretService protective detail.
Joe biden." Do I get dessert with that?".
Been seeing a lot of tweets talking about when Biden wins in November. STOP IT. Stop it now! Let‚Äôs not get complacent. Remember a few years back when everyone assumed trump wouldn‚Äôt get into office? Let‚Äôs not have that again. Time to rally people!
Don't tell me, you've been talking to Joe Biden...
Hello Gov. You would be a terrific choice to be Joe Biden's running mate and I hope he selects you.  You have an impeccable background and you would do great things together.  Good luck!  In any event, the citizens of Rhode Island are proud you are their Governor.
I live in South Florida and the same, not one Biden sign anywhere
What a crock with the blaming Kor Biden and saying he will defund the police. scare tactics.  In Georgia watching horrible political ads by #trump and the disgusting radical right extremist  #kellyloeffler, troll extraordinaire: DONT do it Georgia! Don‚Äôt vote in evil
I agree. I am afraid if Biden picks an African American for VP there will be problems. trump is a bully. And there are a lot of racism that is underground. Hell, a lot of it is no longer underground.

Then again I'm sober and I still wouldn't vote for Biden no way.
Kudos to  for not trying pressure Biden into picking a Black woman as VP. She‚Äôs got great political future &amp; is good for USA

And I'm proud to endorse you for Biden's SECRETARY of STATE! We need to clean up the mess Trump &amp; Pompeo have made of our international relations, which is just as critical as our domestic affairs.
And you dont listen.  I said I dont like nor support biden.  And I rightfully despise trump.
There is no truth to your rhetoric. Nice try, but I despise Clinton &amp; Biden You truly believe your side is 'right' while supporting an incompetent asshat like trump who procured underage girls from epstein.  Laughable. You're no different than catholic priests in your hypocrisies

Hey, didn‚Äôt they have a fiery exchange about busing or done legislation Biden authored??
I admire her greatly, but will she be the inspiring person needed to add life into the Biden campaign? I‚Äôm not so sure. She is part of the old regime. This campaign needs new blood, something to show DEMS are moving forward not relying on the past. Biden is more than we can hai

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Obviously ur not a true democrat bc if you were, you would be questioning A&amp; speaking out against Pelosi, Schumer, Waters and the idiots like AOC.  Biden is a puppet who can‚Äôt remember what office he‚Äôs running for, can‚Äôt remember his wife from his sister. He can‚Äôt remember shit!
Where is the justice for you ignoring the constitution, getting foreign governments to help you win an election, blackmaing Ukraine for dirt on Biden and obstructing investigations and telling admin to ignore subpoenas. So much for LAW &amp; ORDER!  Such a loser. No winning for you!!
Those who hate Trump are going to think that regardless.  The people who are undecided will side w/ Biden if he doesn‚Äôt restore order and side w/ Trump if he does.  Those who love Trump may jump off the Trump train if he lets this continue.  THERE ARE NO CONS TO RESTORING ORDER..
No worries, as soon as Biden is in office he'll be back to screaming about government overreach.
2/x Furthermore, I don't judge my candidates by who else is voting for them, but instead by their policies. There are actual violent Marxists who support Biden but I will only judge Biden on his political platform.

Is that why Biden is up in ALL polls!  You're going down DUMPY!
They will vote Biden because they want a leader who won't give up on America like you did. You couldn't handle the crisis America faced &amp; gave up Americans want a real leader who won't abandon America during a crisis. On Nov 3rd, you're fired for incompetence &amp; epic failures.
No worries.  Everyone knows Biden is close to being brain dead. I can't wait to pull the plug.
???? You know that ad is a lie. Biden want to add to police funding.   Stop drinking the kool-aid.
That's pretty much it, frankly. Hence why it's the default choice, in a broken duopoly of a system were stuck with for the time being.  Biden might be an out of touch crypt keeper but at least he's not a malicious narcissist crypt keeper.

I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden‚Äôs supporters are the one‚Äôs tearing up cities...we sure as hell know they‚Äôre not voting for trump. Also, she doesn‚Äôt stand up to him bc it‚Äôs all an act. She knows he‚Äôs not a racist and that he gives a shit about America.

Biden already views the 11 mill illegals as American citizens. If he gets elected, he‚Äôs guaranteeing a pathway 2 citizenship for every single 1 no matter what their history is. &amp; if that happens...they can vote! just bc biden says he views them as citizens dsnt make them citizens

Nope. We are voting for Biden.
If Biden did not have strong foreign policy credentials, I'd be all for her, but I think Kamala Harris would do well in a debate and offer some different assets. However, it should be a person he can work well with personally and trust implicity (whoever that is).
They are hurting Joe Biden and helping "him".
I will cancel your vote for trump with my vote for Biden.
Once the election results look promising for Biden, trump will begin to doubt himself an he'll go into deep depression and if he doesn't find answers it will probably ruin him. Even if he did cure his narcissism (took me 9 months) there will be too much remorse for him to handle

Biden and trump are both shit. But I will take the lesser of two evils. Especially considering that trump poisons our nation and purchased underage girls from epstein. Im good thanks.
Joe Biden was anti-busing 4 over 4 decades. He touted accomplishments working with segregationalists. Biden said 'without orderly integration' his children would grow up in a 'racial jungle'. The Media loves REWRITING and FORGETTING History. Trump's a counter-puncher not a racist
Amazing how they were able to obtain a future video of America under Joe Biden.  Oh wait...

Mr. Biden,  You should get out more, you know and talk to people other than yourself.
Lol I always have to remind myself that a large part of why I like Biden, is from The Onion.  He was far from my first choice but he's a good and decent person, and right now, that's exactly what we need.
Joe Biden said that without "orderly integration' his children would grow up in a 'racial jungle'. Can you imagine if Trump or any Republican had said this? It never ceases to amaze me how the activist media makes such suckers out of Democrats who are just blind to our history!

i think your underestimating senior population in Florida and how high turnout will be among dems in broward for bidenRemember . . . what would Dems have done different . . . keep in mind Biden and other Dems called the China travel bans xenophobic. And . . . our economy was record strong BEFORE the virus using policies Dems voted against.
Your right, the economy would NEVER have contracted under a Hillary shutdown, NO ONE would have lost their jobs if Democrat led this pandemic. Ignore 3 years of success. Heck even Biden called the China travel ban xenophobic, clearly we'd be better off . . .
Biden would never let this happen. Go Joe in 2020!
Brilliant move by Trump though. We know mail in voting will have issues, if Trump wins, and Dems cry foul, he says I told you so. If he loses, it will be a stain on Biden's election as we continue to find uncounted ballots through 2022.
I am so sick of Trump's  attack ads on Biden. Biden doesnt attack Trump. Hes an honest person and I hope he will be our next President!

Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn‚Äôt need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.

According to the poll, 52 percent of respondents said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today, while 42 percent said they would choose Trump, giving the former vice president a 10 point lead.

Answer to If both Biden and Trump contracted and died from Coronavirus before November what would happen to the 2020 Presidential Election? (I‚Äôm not being political in this question, just curious how the American system would deal such ‚Ä¶ by Channing Taylo
We can‚Äôt kid, Trump has a real chance of winning this.  Biden must not pick someone most Americans hearing her name say ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù We need them to say ‚ÄúI know her, she can lead this nation if something ever happens to Biden.‚Äù  That‚Äôs the perception needed the moment VP is announced.

Yeah I know I make absolutely no sense for disagreeing with businesses closing over a virus with a 99% recovery rate. Go ahead and keep it shutdown because Biden doesn‚Äôt know what planet he is on. You all will be exposed for this nonsense it won‚Äôt end well.
I can see it now. Biden wins election and sends feds into Portland. After they will say why didn‚Äôt Trump do it.
fauci all but said it‚Äôs an excuse to hide by Biden
That‚Äôs it! We need the virus so that Biden has an excuse to hide. Boom ...open up the economy... takeoff the mask and let‚Äôs go to work.
Yeah that‚Äôs why Biden as President is totally going to change America.

‚ÄúSeveral additional women have also gone through extensive examination by the Biden team, including.. Warren..Demings &amp;..Duckworth...Lance Bottoms..Whitmer &amp; Lujan Grisham have..received various levels of scrutiny by the vetting team..11 women are still formally being considered‚Äù
She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
‚ÄúWhen Biden told reporters...he would choose a running mate in the first week of August, two aides told CNN that the timing of an announcement was more likely to be pushed back until the week of August 10. But Biden's advisers gave him a deadline of next week to make up his mind‚Äù
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
I bet Biden announces his VP on Monday.
Prediction‚Ä¶ Trump‚Äôs tweet yesterday about delaying the election was intentional to trigger Dems &amp; have them on record saying ‚Äúabsolutely no way!‚Äù . Then, Oct surprise will show all the crimes Biden committed coming to the surface. Dems will scream ‚Äúwe must delay the election!‚Äù
Well said. Too bad we couldn‚Äôt have Biden/Obama.
It‚Äôs pretty mind blowing to me how people like Matt S don‚Äôt actually listen to or read Biden‚Äôs policies. They are super moderate and many lean right. It‚Äôs also wild how people in America want to see criminal and anti-American activity from the WH and then claim to be Patriots.
18% approval for the demacratic leaders...  That explains why there are no Biden yard signs.
Already hearing Republicans blaming the coming recession on Biden even though elections have not even taken place yet. Any idiot can see that this economy ahead will not be an easy recovery..
I travel all over... I see U.S. flags on cars, I see Trump written on cars, Everywhere I go.  Yet I have not seen even one Biden yard sign...  The embarrassment must be great.
make America great again dump this racist homophobic corrupt divisive lying POS Trump please vote for Biden
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don‚Äôt accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.

If I were to meet Joe Biden in person, I would welcome a hug and would know that it was offered with genuine kindness. Trump is so disgusting that the closest I want to be to him is to have a TV screen between us and a mute button close by.
Well, then we don‚Äôt need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is

most of what you say happened under your prince obama who never gave a crap about blacks, and still does'nt. I bet he gave Biden the line"You aint black if you don't vote for me" Liberals have PTS. Wear a MAGAhat 24 hours it will cure you when you see leftys from our perspective.

So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.

Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.

A Biden bro was mean to me on Twitter now I can't justify voting for Biden. Maybe think twice before you go around calling people selfish.
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.

Joe Biden's mental decline is an open secret.
Trump worked through gridlock. Biden has late stage dementia.

You‚Äôre deflecting. I guess all the progressives in congress who endorsed Biden are wrong.
No matter who Biden picks as VP, the GOP will pull her apart.
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!

No Biden all the way
Send Biden to a nursing home, he's decrepit
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden‚Äôs pick. It‚Äôs time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
Must be a Joe Biden supporter

During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump‚Äôs plan?
You realize you‚Äôre behind double digits in the polls? And Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt done or said a thing.

If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn‚Äôt win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.
As a Dem, you can‚Äôt be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll stay on the job after he loses. I think he‚Äôll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
I didn‚Äôt then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
Ya know what America needs to unify it? A dementia ridden white guy and a cop
Ummmm he walked. ... he ain‚Äôt running anywhere... except for President... and that race he‚Äôll win... Biden is aloof
He just hates Biden; that‚Äôs all.
The best reason for third party simps to go vote for Biden this year: you think he'll be strong enough for a second term? Let him be marginally better than Trump for 4 years. Then you primary his then 82 year old ass with a real progressive.
Biden loses with Harris. No brainer.
I'm sure of it. Now if Kamala Harris is AG for Biden, she will kick ass. AG's have more power that VP's.
Then Trump said he is rolling back certain fair housing standards and I decided, even if I have to stand in line, I‚Äôll vote for Biden. (2/2)
Ok, ok. I was pretty adamant that I wasn‚Äôt going to vote for Biden. Then Trump has protesters forcibly removed in DC and I was like, ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll vote for Biden.‚Äù Then Trump sent federal troops to my home town and I was like, ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll vote absentee.‚Äù (1/2)
The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.

I really dislike Biden‚Äôs substanceless campaign. Every corporate Dem should be thanking God that Trump is so incompetent.  What does build back better even mean? You talkin bout our D grade infrastructure? Our stagnant wages? Our student loan crisis? WHAT?!
Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
Every single day at every single meeting with heads of state or otherwise, Trump turns it into a political rally and an attack on #Biden. And the slavish press covers his propaganda no matter what the meeting was intended for. Shameless.
Means she was willing to destroy his reputation and step over the smoldering remains to get into the White House. If Biden had tried that with Obama you wouldn‚Äôt want him as vp
But my initial read as Biden‚Äôs campaign being cutesy with the VP slot seems inaccurate; it looks like the campaign is dealing with a revolt from loud backers, which has spilled into the press. So I guess we‚Äôre playing our part.
And people are worrying about Biden....this is frightening
Vote Trump anyway!  Do you honestly believe Biden has any reasoning left?
Biden when this is all over remember who made u the most power man in the world !!!
Exactly. Voters don‚Äôt care. That‚Äôs why flogging the veepstakes is a dead horse spectacle. But it sounds like there is real dissent in the ranks, and it is not Biden waffling. That‚Äôs why we have to be vocal. Sorry for all the tweets. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The Racist is Really showing his True Color.   Don't Worry  President Biden will change it Back.
You sound like a Fox News infomercial, man. I have a friend who watches Fox &amp; he said the exact same thing, verbatim. Do you also think Biden ‚Äúsmells‚Äù children? C‚Äômon... look at our country today!! We couldn‚Äôt take much more of all this winning!
So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it‚Äôs not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn‚Äôt want to hear.
but even then, he would have said a complete sentence which beats out to the current dementia-laden, 5-word memorizing, dangerous-drug pushing, clown in office today! But yea, Biden will be removing the obese one!
It didn‚Äôt happen under Obama/Biden. It won‚Äôt happen.  Trump is a liar.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"
I'm HOPING she will!  Biden is a corporate toady - but so is she, so....
As a man I thought AOC moved us all forward on treatment of women and language. Nah. After what you just said about Biden, I realized you‚Äôve just been well behaved for Bernie‚Äôs sake- you are still the FUCKING BITCH I knew you were in 2015 #ninaturnerisafuckingbitch
is sick mentally and thinks he can beat  .  Mr Trump has done more for Americans in 3 years than Biden has in 40 or more.   Biden has no clue on how to deal with COVID 19 or 9 as he calls it.  #FourMoreYears
Looks like it's going to be Kamala Harris more and more. I think Obama and Hillary are pushing for her behind the scenes.

I am not sure if investors release that a Biden administration would have people's health as a top priority and while big pharma might not be their favorite constituency, there is no real reason to fear a Biden win.

It‚Äôs a deliberate leak (reveal) as a trial balloon. Trying to judge the reaction for having a VP who is a descendant of slave owners and an aggressive prosecutor of minorities using the Crime Bill written by Biden. Joes handlers don‚Äôt do anything with a poll.
I‚Äôm not even sure of a virtual debate at this point. I didn‚Äôt realize how bad Biden is it‚Äôs embarrasing that this was the best Dems could do after 4 years.
A Biden/ Harris ticket is a disaster waiting to happen. Both with anger issues and a history of passing and enforcing laws against minorities. How can you vote for a ticket with a defendant of slave owners on it?
I absolutely believe this... I worry what Trump &amp; Barr will do the days after he loses (if we vote)&amp; Biden takes office! Trump will sabotage the country &amp; no telling what else.... but regardless, Trump &amp; his Administration will pay for every crime committed &amp; ever dime grifted!!
So Jellyfish Joe Biden may have slipped up and it‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs picking a VP who is a descendant of slave owners, one who prosecuted Biden‚Äôs Crime Bill aggressively and jailed thousands of minorities for offenses she herself admits to doing as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris

911? Police?  What does that have to do with Biden and segregation and busing? You're borderline incoherent, and that makes you a waste of time. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to put the real info into this thread (which you couldn't respond logically to.)
Biden loves the cops crushing people as much as anyone. They all love it.
Admittedly unlikely now, but keep coming back to the one possible VP with whom Joe is most simpatico; who checks off the boxes he values.  So, I‚Äôd be remiss not to float my Everlasting Gobstopper theory‚Äîthat Biden‚Äôs heir apparent could be the woman who returned hers‚ÄîAmy Klobuchar

We control the entire govt Biden gonna have to sign whatever we put on his desk. Or we gonna be in the streets.
Bingo. Harris, Rice, Demings, Bass, Duckworth, etc...doesn't matter. Donald Trump doesn't care about running a country. He cares about being liked. DON'T GET INTO POLITICS IF YOU WANT TO BE LIKED. Because - no matter what you do - many won't like you. Biden is ready to lead!
And he still makes more sense than Biden, figure that out.
Can you break the law then run for office to avoid indictment biden? American's hopes and dreams of justice described by this article. You better give us some REAL criminals Barr, not some sacrificial small fries. Some higher ups gave the orders!
My bet offer is open any time you want.Biden with a 14 point lead I saw today. Easy money for you. Wondering why you won‚Äôt though?Funny thing is that for all the news hype about it, Bernie won the Cuban vote over Biden in the primary. Also Karen Bass is a boss.
Dear Biden,   do the United States a favor &amp; delete twitter.   Sincerely,  The people who are voting for you.
As a Floridian, I can honestly say it would be disastrous to Biden‚Äôs now good chances of taking Florida‚Äîand with it the election.
It‚Äôs so cute how Trump supporters accuse Biden of everything that Trump has done. If true, it would only reduce the race to a comparison of their personalities. Who would vote for Diet-Coke-Soaked-Sack-of-Dog-Logs-Donny?(say it fast 3x‚Äôs and Trump will actually crap his pants!)

It is incredibly insulting that they think people will hold their noses and vote for Biden just because of TDS.
Know that UNLESS your goal and agenda is to radically change and/or destroy the greatest Country on earth, you can not vote with any sound rationale for a Democrat or Joe Biden.
If Biden wins we‚Äôll be too busy shooting our way out of Socialism to worry about them.
No, it's not that many. Despite any surveys you may produce, he'll probably receive fewer this time than last. That's why the desperate attempts to make Biden look as racist as possible. The only hope is to disgust enough blacks to stay home to make a difference in close states
That Joe Biden is naive or malicious? What is your point?
I know Biden wasn‚Äôt a lot of people‚Äôs first pick but yeah, it‚Äôs kinda a big deal to people who aren‚Äôt white kids from New England that he win
Its very disheartening but please consider voting for Biden. We will make some progress under Biden and a trump 2nd term will be devastating.  Many voters had the same attitude in 2000 and wouldn‚Äôt vote for Gore over Bush. The Bush presidency was a disaster.
When are we going to talk about the fact that a) the former VP clearly has Alzheimer‚Äôs (someone in my family has it bad, I know the signs), &amp; b) that this is the cream of the crop for the Democrats?  For all the talk about Trump and the 25th Amendment, Biden will get it for sure.
Abrams is like meanest woman at the DMV. I‚Äôm praying Biden picks her.
And if Trump wins, lot's of Biden voters will push the "he didn't win, fraud, Russia" claims before or during the violence they're committing
That‚Äôs fair, I for one despise the fact the the DNC left us with Biden as the democratic nominee. However the fact is that at the time he endorsed Biden there was not another option that would have had a beneficial outcome. (Not endorse any1/endorse Bernie only to have him lose)

The combo of these things means that by October, polling numbers should move back in Trump's favor providing for a much closer race than currently envisioned in key states.  National polls may keep a 8pt lead for Biden but NC, TX, MI, FL will be tight again.
The effort to block Trump from Facebook and Google is ongoing but has not worked so far. Trump is outspending Biden on digital 3:1
No one is writing stories about fundraising but Trump has a $400M total advantage and a $100COH advantage.

I'm worried about what he's actually going to do if he wins. If Trump loses M4A is delayed 4 more years. If Biden wins its most likely going to be 8 or more since no one will challenge him from the left
Just a note, this is the mainstream media actively pushing conspiracy theories. Why? Biden wants to flip Florida.
Oh hell is he starting this üí©again? I thought he and Joe had come to agreement on how they were going forward on Health care. Warren supported Biden so I thought this was settled. We‚Äôre doing Single payer on the ACA. We‚Äôre doing what we can get passed. Bernie fu^kn LOST‚ÄºÔ∏èüî•

Has anyone at CNN asked Biden about the Iran bounties/EIEDs/Iran deal?
If Biden is president, the chances of Rubio losing in a midterm is low anyway, so it doesn't matter.  I bet Murphy doesn't leave her growing-blue house seat for a long-shot Senate run
Calling whatever happens, if it happens, a debate is a stretch.   I‚Äôm betting Biden‚Äôs controllers refuse to debate, assuming Biden actually ends up being the candidate. Odds of that no better than 50-50.

I‚Äôm no more a Trump supporter than i am Biden, but with this push to use mail in ballots because of a so called spike in the #coronavirus....who r we kidding? The Dems are rigging this election to ensue a Biden win. #Election2020
Easy, voting for Donald Trump is like eating a shit sandwich. Voting for Joe Biden is like eating a shit sandwich with cheese on it. I'm voting for not eating a shit sandwich.
s/o to the Democrats that label Trump a racist while propping up "if you don't vote for me you ain't black" Biden.
Biden-Harris 2020 Tallahassee,Fl.
Haha. Poor Donnie, those cheap, shoddy materials he has been using all these years finally caught up with him. I wonder if he paid the contractors for the wall. Or did he stiff them too?
If they‚Äôre not already following Biden they‚Äôre not followers of mine
Harris seen as Biden VP favorite as clock ticks
Biden would destroy Trump in a debate. Especially if they have someone fact checking responses or if Trump were to release his taxes.
Saying Biden is questionable because he spoke at Senator Byrd‚Äôs funeral means questioning the liberal lean of those Republican Senators who spoke at the funeral of Senator Ted Kennedy?  I would think honoring someone in their official status would be an exemption!
Proud to be on the Board of  supporting the Presidential bid of  The UTC team could not be a more awesome group of humans.   All in for this type of content.  100 days to go.  100 reasons to support Joe Biden.   Let‚Äôs do this!!!  #GoJoe  #Biden2020
Wow, wouldn't think Biden would pass up a game of softball with Wallace.

A bunch of dudes in their 60s and 70s playing model UN on zoom to try to see how the fate of the republic plays out...we really live in the stupidest timeline
Trump is in trouble not just because of killing us but because Biden has much lower unlikable ratings than Hillary. Sad but true.
Biden leads in just about every poll and his campaign has said they will debate Trump
Educate yourself on socialism and you‚Äôll find that Biden is far from it. Most of the ‚Äúradical leftists‚Äù out there are just social justice warriors not socialists.
With enough pressure any government is answerable to the ppl. With Biden there won't be enough pressure

So this FL looks closer to reality right now - with a long f‚Äôn way to go, so take no rest.  It means nothing  But when  next survey shows something like this, it‚Äôs not as media will tweet ‚Äútrump slashed Biden 13pt lead‚Äù - it‚Äôs just shows Q is bad at polling Fla
100 days to Election Day. What are you doing to help elect Joe Biden and other Democrats?
Kelly 3pts ahead of Biden is quite interesting
Vote Biden he won't kill your grandparents or children
I‚Äôm a data guy. But I do believe in the notion that some things cannot be quantified.  Biden is likely to win November.  How can I put a number to that?   Sure I can write some code (actually I can‚Äôt code worth shit ) - but it‚Äôs all somewhat arbitrary.  92. 85. 73?  It‚Äôs ‚ÄúLikely‚Äù
I‚Äôm def starting to fall out of love with election models for this reason. Sure Biden looks really strong now. But we have 100 days to. The potential for shifts is there and the put a hard number on it is realistically impossible. It‚Äôs fair to be ‚Äúlikely Biden‚Äù but no number
Maybe not, but his party does! Biden won‚Äôt run the country if he‚Äôs elected....the sociopaths on the far Left will! People like AOC, Cory Booker, Lori Lightfoot, Rashida Tlaib etc.
How do they feel now. I know a few Trump supporters who regret their vote and will vote for Biden bec he seems like a ‚Äúgood person ‚Äú
Is it worse simply because Biden did it? If Biden had said the Kansas City Chiefs was in Kansas and Trump had called Arizona a city, you‚Äôd still be saying that Biden‚Äôs error was worse. Please be honest and admit it.
And tweeting that Biden called Arizona a city.... HE HAS TO GO!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
One of the 1st things Biden needs to do post election is investigate every judicial appointment made since 2017. Those found to be unqualified or to have lied to Congress need to be impeached.

Will Biden debate trump? I really want to see him at a podium in front of a hot mic
48 years is nearly 50 years.  Biden has been in politics cheating for 50 years.  Believe nothing from the media or DNC. 50 years to fine tune thieving ways.
Biden a socialist? I wish
I think you could make a good contra argument that once Biden's elected this all goes away.
I just think it‚Äôs amazing you won‚Äôt shut the fuck up about Obama/Biden but ignore my tweets where I state Trump has mocked disabled, has multiple rage allegations from multiple women(that started WAY before his presidency), and literally does not know basic fucking geography.
Why is this man in my mentions trying to have me decided if Trump or Biden is more mentally competent? They‚Äôre both fucking stupid.
Biden and Trump are both equally unfit to be president.
The video Jonathan shared shamed Obama, Hilary, Biden while uplifting Trump and calling people who don‚Äôt support him morons and stupid. But then Jonathan wants to cry wolf &amp; say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre bashing me for not sharing the same viewsüòÇüòÇ‚Äù
Lmao so you agree that the under trumps watch when republicans controlled the WH, senate, and house (until 2019)  the national debt has gone up by 7 trillion? The buck has to stop somewhere üôÑ I know it‚Äôs hard for y‚Äôall to admit but I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall will again care when biden wins.
If trump is planning to dump Pence for Nicki as a VP to counter Biden? I think it is possible. Shit, anything is possible with this covidiot in chief.
Universal child allowance should be included in Covid legislation. I am also in favor of UBI but i think The child allowance is more Doable as a first step. If it is not done now, it should be first bill congress passes and Biden signs.
Biden and Clinton
Also, I made a little something to try to express how grateful I am to Biden, you and the wonderful CNN team. I take care of my ill mother &amp; I'm stressed a lot. With all this mess going on, it's nice to listen to calm, truthful voices.
I fucking love Bernie going sicko on Elon  Just REALLY wish he went after Biden on his bullshit like he did to Elon üòê
Some say the same about Trump voters. but I guess it depends on what you're looking for in a president. And for me Trump has none of what I'm looking for. Biden may be lacking as well, but he possesses some of the qualities I like
Again I'm not disagreeing. I'm not saying Trump's brand of racism is worse or better it's simply a different kind of racism than the other presidents had. At any rate he's a big races that needs to go. That goes without saying. A stupid comment by Biden does not change that
None of us buy that Biden  has a 13 point advantage in FL. I am not counting on Trump losing his home state. I hope he does and I will work to help Biden get FL‚Äôs vote. Caution ‚Äî There is NO way Biden is up by 13.
Typed Joe Biden‚Äôs assistant
COVID could have an impact on this because there is less events, less times for the Montford/Ausley types to go to the regional fair and remind the locals who they are.  Campaigns will be alot more remote.    So I expect Ausley to outdo Biden but not Montford levels
Yes. Because NO ONE has harmed the country as much as Trump. So even if Biden is mediocre or traditional status quo, it will be a VAST improvement over what we have now. Before we can gain ground, we have to retake the ground that we lost since the beginning of 2017.
I called it about a month ago when asked what could stop Biden from defeating Trump. An alien invasion might just do the trick?
I wouldn't say it's causation per se, but I think a lot of people were pacified by Obama's commitment to the Paris Accord that Biden will go back to. It's not nearly enough. I'm not arguing that Trump is good, just defending the snooze button metaphor OP used for Biden.
The cut to defense wouldn't even have got us back to pre-Trump levels and the dems still rejected it. Is there anyone who still wants to tell me Biden would be better on foreign policy?
stop saying the president is becoming more normal‚Äîhe has not changed! Why aren‚Äôt you interviewing Biden more often?
4/ this is of course ignoring the large, specific problems with Biden the candidate. Arguably, Trump has yet to inflict anything as damaging as the crime bill Biden defends to this day.
1/ We can't treat the Trump presidency as an abbheration, it's part of a continual trend. The tea party rose to prominence in the Obama years directly resulting from George W (who is now pushing a ton of money in Biden's campaign) and that the left had no real representation
Again, I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt gripe that Biden will be taking money from special interests and that will affect health care policy.  Just recognize that where we are is a reflection of who we are.  The politicians don‚Äôt get better until we do.
I‚Äôm not even sure what your point was.  That Biden doesn‚Äôt favor UHC?  That‚Äôs not a mystery.  My point is that this is acceptable to most people.  They don‚Äôt actually care about UHC, no matter what polls say.
Flamdip- I can also say if only the Dems had taken it seriously. Nancy Pelosi said "come to Chinatown there's nothing wrong" that was in February. Biden himself called the president xenophobe. So stop the BLAME Game!

can we please fast forward 32x through 2020 to get to Joe Biden‚Äôs inauguration? Plz and thx
If Biden and the Democrats we're still as racist as you're trying to make us believe, then you should be supporting them and would be against the Republicans.
Okay, time for Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, et. al. to issue a clear, definitive statement opposing rioting, destruction of property and threats to human lives...and to tell (or even ask, if that‚Äôs all the oomph they can muster) the ‚Äúprotestors‚Äù to quit and go home.
Most white supremacists HATE Biden . Most white supremacists love Trump. Evidently the white supremacists feel that Trump represents THEIR interests. Otherwise, they'd support Biden  . That's all I need to know.
You pretty much missed my point. People were trying to label Biden as racist and say that Blacks should not vote for him for that reason. I'm simply saying that while not every Trump supporter is a white supremacist, nearly every white supremacist is a Trump supporter
Andrew yang was light years ahead of biden in brain activity. It‚Äôs CRIMINAL he‚Äôs the nominee and not you.
The first national Biden ad of the year.  It's only going to get worse
Opinion: If #JoeBiden was a Black Bear (video)  #JoeBiden2020
Blake Jones Most preposterous statement of 2020 so far. I've never seen such a misuse of the word "first".
Trump has not done himself any favors among Florida‚Äôs nation‚Äôs largest senior electorate. Nor has his mini-me DeSantis. Both are willing to write off seniors as collateral damage. This has been unfavorably received and Biden vote totals will so reflect.
üëÄ Disturbing. Can say I have never seen this nor done this as a nurse ...  Senator Biden ‚Äù I had nurses at Walter Reed hospital who would bend down and whisper in my ear, go home and get me pillows. They would‚Ä¶actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move, to get me moving.‚Äù
So he‚Äôs saying that he‚Äôs expecting Us to wake up with Biden as President? If so, great!
Biden Bros are the best at voter outreach
The snake analogy is faulty. If you believe Biden will be as opposed to civil rights as Trump currently is, i don't know what to say. White supremacist love Trump. Trump defends white supremacist. White supremacist hate Biden.That's enough information to make an informed decision
Biden is a decent man who made some mistakes in the past. Trump's pattern is indecency on so many levels. The positive things he does are the aberrations. One man changed for the better. The other one is as bad as ever. If Biden is half as decent as Obama, we have a winner.
Biden wrote the misguided crime bill true. But Trump advocated the death penalty for some black teenagers that would later proven not guilty. And he still won't admit he was wrong about their guilt.
A man who can never admit he's wrong is dangerous. And since there's no way to make Trump look good, the strategy is to attempt to make Biden look bad. But compared to Biden, Trump will always look and actually be multiple times worse
Biden at his worst was not as racist as Trump IS NOW. And let's not start comparing which of vhas said more insulting things. Trump is the king of insults. And when he says something dumb, instead of admitting it and apologizing, he doubles down on it
We know who Biden is. We know who Trump is. That quote from Biden is old. But the hate we hear from Trump is in the present. So you comparing biden's past with Trump's present. I'm going with Biden
An unenthusiastic vote counts the same as an enthusiastic one. Those who vote for Biden with a frown count just as much as those who hope for him with a smile. So enthusiasm doesn't really matter

No, Biden wouldn't use federal troops to "dominate" protestors
'He can't relate in any way': Obama and Biden critique Trump in new campaign video
I understand that Biden should not have said what he said. But but there's something different about Trump's racism that defies words. This may sound crazy, but Biden was both completely wrong and completely right at the same time.
This tweet, and the thread, make me think 2 things: 1) VBM "fraud" is one of the biggest self-inflicted wounds ever 2) I'm more confident by the day that Biden wins FL (and by extension, the presidency)

If Biden is following his own Aug. 1 #veepstakes deadline, when do we think it‚Äôll come? I thought something would leak today (there‚Äôs still time) and then speculation all weekend and then Monday morning announcement.
Swing state Fla now 51% for  38% for  Biden widens what had been 4% up in April,  says..
The Q poll also has Biden up 51% to Trump 38%....  Other polls have recently showed Biden with a lead - but not that big in Florida...MOE is 3.2 plus or minus.
I believe Biden is ahead in Florida.  I believe - as I have for a long time - that Biden could &amp; would win Florida.  I also believe Quinnipiac is the Blake Bortles of Florida polling.  That‚Äôs all folks.  Get back to work.
Biden Says Trump Is Spreading Racism and Dividing America

I have to change the wording for Twitter as I watched it deboosted in front of my eyes. ~ if it weren‚Äôt for them. I wouldn‚Äôt be President. They did a terrible job!  Obama, who wouldn‚Äôt even endorse Biden until everyone else was out of the primaries
To be fair, we reported late last year about the president's personal dislike for adult regulated use. But there are people in the industry who are continuously saying that an XO on the schedule 1 status could win voters who aren't sure about Biden.
An interesting example of LV polling taken already to me is this mornings new St. Pete Poll of Florida. LV model has Biden up 6 which you would expect in an environment like we are in today, no?

This is what we expected from a Trump America but these images are still shocking. We must elect Biden to have a more tranquil country .
Join me and hundreds of others in signing this letter to Presidential candidate Biden- We need a #NoFirstUse policy to disarm from nuclear weapons!
OK my initial reaction was that the quote was nuts, but the context is important. Biden didn't mean "first racist" -- it's clear from full context he meant first presidential candidate to run on racially divisive issues and get elected. Small, but important, difference.
What? It‚Äôs in Biden‚Äôs interest for trump to keep talking about this. The more trump portrays Biden as a drooling vegetable, the more Biden can overpeform in the debates. Trump being obsessed with this is great for Biden and he will do nothing to stop trump from talking about it.

We must elect Biden to avert the slippery slope to authoritarian rule. Look at history ‚Äî this slide happens by steps over the course of years. I am scared of what would happen in a second Trump term. Congress has been shown it is weak to defend us.
Barney, that was just an observation based upon your copy of the Maiden tweet. Nothing gets accomplished here, especially not with name calling. It's just something to argue about. I support the President,  yes,  but that would be based in fear of Biden and associated loons
joe biden said donald trump is the first racist president ... yeah we fucked either way
Oh Lord, Joe! I don't think so! I'll buy "the most blatant", but you don't have to go back any further than Bush to find repressed racism, though I'll concede his may have been altruistic. I have seen fairly open racism in at 4 Presidents in my lifetime
I agree with you about the others. But I think Biden probably had in mind the old school obviously ignorant George Wallace/ Strom Thurmond/Lester Maddox redneck direct appeal form of racism that has folks chanting white power. Those you mentioned try to appear intelligent
Weird post, Boris. This actually is Trump‚Äôs America. We‚Äôre living in his dystopian version of America. Vote for Biden in November to restore the light.
Joe Biden Tripped Up Badly by Running Mate Question... 'I'm Having a 2-Hour, Uh, Um, Vetting Report'Yet, the real question that ponders us all is:  "Where's Basement Biden?"
You really need to research Biden's History more, it's truly horrible.  You're ignoring the lives he's destroyed in Latin/South America with his love of Regime change.  Look at Honduras for example, or what's going on in Yemen.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Crime Bill?  Patriot Act?  NDAA? #NeverBiden
Joe Biden sounds alot like a certain Bloody Socialist Cuban Dictator that murdered over 100,000 Cubans in 58 years of Absolute Power.
Well, for starters it's indisputable that Biden has far more blood on his hands than Trump &amp; has left more destroyed lives in his wake.  The biggest reason I think Biden will be worse is all the "Resistance" will go back to brunch &amp; ignore his evil, just like they did with Obama.

He said in the begining that LatinX votes weren't part of his strategy making it obvious that he has zero intention of doing anything that benefits those of us that fall into that group.  Biden is only going to help his real constituents, which none of us on here are a part of.

Projections are that more than 250K small businesses are going under and  want to give then $0 in aid while giving states $1.1 trillion in aid.   This is a microcosm of how Democrats intend to treat businesses in a Joe Biden presidency.
Oh hell no!
Florida supports Joe Biden by 4 points.
Biden attracts 247 people to watch him read from a teleprompter, but he is ahead of the President in the polls? If you believe that I have a bridge for sale.
If by "getting pulled farther left," means Joe Biden wants to make sure everyone has healthcare, and make sure that the Police get more funding, then I guess you are right.
Rasmussen's polls have been proven to be inaccurate over and over again.  Literally 99% of the other polls have your approval rating at least underwater by 8 points.  If you want to talk about polls, how about admitting that 99% of polls have you getting clobbered by Biden?

For those who don't believe me, please see this article.  Biden wants to give $300 million in additional funding to the COPS program, the same program that Trump wanted to cut.
Joe Biden is literally proposing to give police more funding than Trump wants to give them.  So keep purveying your ignorant lies.  It's not working.

Joe Biden's (Obama) Administration saw the longest continual job growth in history. Yesterday the GDP hit an all-time low.  who do you think you're fooling with your b*******.   don't listen to me listen to Donald.
Anti- Trumpers continually accuse him of criminal conduct absent any proof. They need to look no further than their candidate Biden who is the poster boy off ill-gotten gains.
America, everything we supposedly ‚Äúhear‚Äù from Joe Biden is not coming from Joe Biden.  He is unable to think clearly enough to come up with even a fraction of what we are hearing.  There are other people behind him steering him to do and say what they want. Biden is a front man.
There is a poll indicating 62% of Americans won't reveal who they are voting for..   This statistic alone explains the so-called Biden lead..  How many Dems fear retribution.  Zero  Trumper's don't fear retribution.. they absolutely KNOW there would be retribution

Im worried about the  election. People will decide that there will be lots to vote for Biden, so they won't vote at all. Everyone who can, plan to vote.
Sure seems to be a lot of real conservatives coming out against Trump.  When I heard that George Will would be voting for Joe Biden I thought I had stepped into bizarro land. Another prominent conservative ws calling for impeachment because of the change election day tweet by djt

I think you owe  an apology for this article on 4/24.  It hasn‚Äôt aged well.
This is a Southwest Florida thing: Trump and American flags hanging from the back of pickups. Along with the occasional Confederate flag. Moral of the story: Make sure you vote for Biden so truck guy will be even more unhappy.
My account havked by the Biden‚Äôs, just saying. Trump 2021.
Joe Biden is our Abraham Lincoln and then the second Civil War Jefferson Davis is in the White House... Trump is Jefferson Davis, the ""house that Jeff built"" is also Trump Tower.  In America Up Is down, left is right, and everybody right-wing Confederacy down the rabbit hole ..
We became China the moment Democrats sold America out. Its clear with Hunter Biden's 1.5B deal with the Chi-Coms, Dems became beholden to the Communist regime. #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
It's because they have no other rebuttal for choosing such a problematic candidate like Biden...  They are such shallow, two dimensional thinkers. #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
You sound hysterical. Get that TDS treated.ü§î  There's an argument to be made that Biden isn't even the lesser evil, that's how low your party has sunk.  Might want to hit up your Superdelegates to use their power for good for a change &amp; for what it was intended. #ReplaceBiden
Yes, I‚Äôm sure Joe Biden does have a ton of Chinese bots deceiving you into believing a false popularity.  Which is also similar to the election.
As expected...üôÑ  Same response I get when I ask #JoeBots to name Progressive policies that Biden has championed during his 50+ years as a Democrat...
That's a strawman argument, I never said Trump wasn't garbage, I'm saying Biden is also garbage with more blood on his hands &amp; more ruined lives in his wake than the talking Cheeto.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  It's sad that you can't argue any positives for your preferred sex pest other than,"But Trump!"
Public announcements from both sides continue and sow confusion in the electorate. Many Trump voters stay home and GOP heavy election locations do not open. Dems show up in force on Election Day and in mail in ballots to give Biden decisive landslide. Trump won‚Äôt concede.
Biden right Turley a traitor,  your all going down.
In April, Biden said, ‚ÄúI think Trump is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held.‚Äù  Trump's campaign called his comments "incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate"  Today Trump suggested we delay the election
Lmao Scott finds one poll that has Biden with a double digit lead and he praises it like it‚Äôs gospel. He must be embarrassed.
The President of the United States, really just said, "Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote"  Remember when Joe Biden said he believes Trump will try and delay the election and Republicans attacked him for it?
You got to ask yourself this question. Why the hell would project Veritas put out a video like this? I think it's some kind of a setup.
LOL. Joe Biden is further to the right than Ronald Reagan. You're one of my Representatives here in Florida? no wonder we are fucked.
Joe Biden is the poster boy for term limits. A record of more than four decades of service that is devoid of accomplishment yet boasts anti desegregation rhetoric.
I live in the suburbs.  There are plenty of people living in low-income housing.  Most of them voted for Trump in 2016.  Most of them would be homeless if not for ‚Äúlow-income housing.‚Äù  Most of them will now be voting Biden in 2020. #SuburbsForBiden
According to Gallup Americans think if you contract covid there's a 9% chance you will die..  Gallup also says that Biden is leading in the polls  Is that a function of how ignorant we are or a function of our media leading us over a cliff.. like lemmings.
There‚Äôs disgruntled people everywhere. It wasn‚Äôt Biden. His note said ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt hold grudges‚Äù. Which tells me he‚Äôll make the choice. Don‚Äôt forget he‚Äôs got some pretty impressive advisors. The guy that used to be his boss. Have faith.
Did the media EVER make any attempt to root out the Biden corruption..?
Gallup has a poll that finds Americans think 9% of people will die if they contract Covid..  Is it any wonder Gallup shows Biden ahead in the polls..?
LMAO. If you think Joe Biden is a socialist you are dumber than I thought. Democrat or not Joe Biden is further to the right than Ronald Reagan. Please to avoid embarrassing yourself further don't use words that end in -ist or -ism.
LMAO he CANNOT complete sentences better than trump. Go watch for yourself. Trump will dominate Joe just like he did to Clinton in head to head. Joe Biden has also been seen biting little girls hair. He asked a 9 year old girl if she was 18. Give it up.
I didn't say Trump was good, I said Biden is shit.  He absolutely has more blood on his hands and destroyed lives under his belt than the Oompah Loompah in Chief does though, so there's that...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è .#NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Lol, you're one to be taken seriously. üôÑ  RussiaGate is Q-Anon for Centrists...üòÖ  You also apparently don't know Biden's History very well. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You're making my point, of course Biden appeals to conservatives, because he is one.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yes Biden and Rice
Biden is a senile old fool.
Again...I don‚Äôt often agree with Biden (or Trump) &amp; we may have varying visions of what succes ahead looks like...but this is still true! Many will tell you we are doomed specifically BECAUSE of our ‚Äúheart‚Äù &amp; history. Ignore them.
#NobodyLikesTrump This thread was developed by malcontent Biden losers. Biden, a mentally deficient man, is an embarrassment. It is hundreds of times worse to know that there are really stupid people that would vote for him.
i live in florida (a MASSIVE swing state) so im 100% voting for biden tbh
It has to be Harris; Rice is obviously qualified, but she has no constituency. Warren's constituency knows she's out &amp; are voting for Biden. Aabrams &amp; Duckworth would be fine choices, but again, Biden would be trading a guaranteed bloc of voters, demographically diverse for...
More racism from our Putin puppet. Biden will fix this ridiculous move of yours when we throw your a$$ out in November. You killed Americans with your negligence in dealing with the pandemic, you allow Putin to kill our troops, you are a racist and expect to be re-elected? Nope!
Well anyone who's Biden pick as VP will become president. Somehow in this case ambition is irrelevent. Unless they want a weak president who would be nothing more than a figure head.
There goes Texas, Pennsyvania...
Texas loves Biden!
Tied? Biden &amp; Trump are only tied in Georgia polls??  That settles it, then. Georgia is the most ignorant of the sister states (Georgia &amp; Florida) on a % basis.
biden too
Name one thing he has done to help Veterans.....and don‚Äôt say choice cause that was in place by Obama/Biden
We might be, but Biden sure isn't.  He still thinks the Devil's Lettuce is a gateway drug...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Well, at least that's his public position, the real reason is that his pharma backers don't want people to have access to a medication they can provide for themselves for free. ü§î
Who would you rather see as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate?
Biden stated that ‚Äúthe police have become the enemy.‚Äù No wonder they all pulled out of the DNC
exactly so go do some research. I have. Facts don‚Äôt lie. Trump has helped minorities more than any other president ‚Äúsugar‚Äù. He‚Äôs not racist, Joe Biden is super racist but you won‚Äôt admit that. Joe Biden has called a former kkk member a mentor &amp; he‚Äôs put MANY minorities in Jail!
In some ways he's worse.  It's undisputable that Biden has far more blood on his hands and destroyed lives under his belt than the Oompah Loompah in Chief does.üòñ  The Democratic Party has become a mockery of everything it's ever claimed to stand for.  I'm #DoneWithDems.
My man, they're dragging Biden around by the arm like he's Ray Charles in a crowded mall, I'm pretty sure incontinence has made an appearance and he cant make a sentence.   What are you doing?
Texas is still a ‚ÄúRed State,‚Äù but the people of Texas also know a crook when they see him.  Joe Biden may not be as Red as they prefer, but he‚Äôs a good, honest, hard working man who cares about all of the people in Texas.  That‚Äôs why Biden will win Texas.
The Great State of Texas supports Joe Biden.
Biden and Obama tried to do this but Republicans called it ‚ÄúSocialist price controls.‚Äù  Nancy Pelosi tried again in 2019 and McConnell blocked the attempt.
Keep talking. You‚Äôre Biden‚Äôs best reason for voting for him. Keep on talking.
Trump‚Äôs just mad because Joe Biden took press questions and Fox News covered it.  BTW Biden looked awesome!
Not right now.  It would be too much of a distraction.  We need to concentrate all of our attention on the election of Joe Biden.
Great point! Ethics of sharing that w Biden an issue?
Watching Biden‚Äôs performance at his ‚Äúnews conference ‚Äú yesterday reminded of a movie.  Peter Sellers as Chauncy Gardener in ‚ÄúBeing There‚Äù. Character had no intelligence jusr like Biden. He couldn‚Äôt call reporter with answer on teleprompter. Idiot
Great TShirt idea. "If you vote for Biden, you ain't a cop!"
Biden and the Democrats will pander to anyone for a vote, but this is beyond frightening for Capitalism and American freedoms.
You are aware that VP Biden has never been ‚Äúpresident‚Äù so your prognosis is very inaccurate.
Donald Trump was all ready to campaign against Bernie Sanders with his bogus attacks of ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù and ‚Äúradical left.‚Äù  Then Joe Biden won and now he still thinks that his strategy can work.  Biden has been in office for 40 years. We all know he‚Äôs not ‚Äúradical.‚Äù
Joe Biden won the Primary.  He is far from being ‚ÄúRadical.‚Äù  If anything you are the ‚Äúradical‚Äù one.
I don't even think that's a given.  When they can't hide Biden in his basement anymore and he actually has to debate and give long form interviews his cognitive decline will be impossible to hide anymore. #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15

So biden answer questions today but if you noticed it was pre meditated he read off a paper of what reporters to call on completely set up pre-planned questions and answers did anybody else realize that Trump doesn't read off a list for what reporters to call on. Complete sham
14 weeks. We'll have 14 weeks of Joe Biden
Never seen anything like it. They attacked Barr like rabid dogs; they never let him answer or respond, they insulted him, called him names; pathetic human behavior, by Democrats. We saw evil today; we saw &amp; heard raw racism, we saw our future if Biden is elected.  God help us...
The fact that you think Biden is far left outs you as an incredibly low info voter.üòÖ  Go read a book Sunshine...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If you took every time Joe Biden misspoke his entire life, it would not even equal a single Donald Trump press conference. We are supposed to applaud Trump when he lifts a bottle to his lips and can repeat 5 words.
As for the worse?  There's a strong argument to be made that Trump is in fact the lesser of the two evils.  It's indisputable that Biden has far more blood on his hands and destroyed lives under his belt than the Oompah Loompah in Chief does.ü§î#NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
I don't remember supporting Jordan, but I do support Barr's protecting federal property. I think the media is a disgraceful and dishonest bunch (both sides).  Biden is in early onset dementia in my view. Thanks for responding  Anyway, without snark, enjoy the football games!
I don't know why #ShitLibs can't figure out why we won't vote for their candidate.  They'd lose their minds if a generic Repub was running with Biden's record.  #JoeBots are low info, VBNMW cultists that only think what they are programmed to.üòñ  #BlueMAGA or Red?  I'll pass.
So very true.. Trump likes grown women. Pedophile Obiden likes little girls and children....
He's destroyed so many lives at home &amp; abroad between his Warmongering love of Regime change &amp; his authoritarian, racist crime bill alone.  Biden is hot garbage in a restaurant dumpster during the second month of a sanitation workers strike.  In August.  He'd stink on ice...ü§Æ
I do not. In fact I go out of my way to have flag on dashboard &amp; display Biden bumper stickers, I wear flag scarf at luncheons &amp; use small flag on table for group lunch.  I have been approached re flags meaning. Always say it‚Äôs a good identifier of American citizens.
A vote for Biden gets you the AFFH.  What is the AFFH, you ask?  LISTEN TO THIS!!  Stanley Kurtz on Democrats' push for a fundamental transformation of America's suburbs |

When Biden picks Kamala as his VP, we‚Äôd better get #KamalaIsACop trending again.
Which, actually, is like a modern day share cropping proposition by a Bigoted Joe Biden and his Democrat Plantation.  Remember this November folks.  Don't vote for Racist DemoKKKrats.
Starting to see Biden commercials here in SW Florida. They are positive and I find it refreshing after hearing Trump‚Äôs ugly, lying negative ones.
If Biden wins the Presidency, I would demand that each vote be investigated for fraudulent voters. It is a fact that many of the 42 million non citizens, many illegal, are registered to vote and many will break the law and vote. Voting is reserved for citizens only.
Biden has the questions before the press conference
Yet, Delusional Dems &amp; the Fake News Mainstream Media fails to question Basement Biden on his acts of corruption.
Biden knew the questions before getting them!
Is it me or is Joe Biden in a 7 second delay and in an alternate universe?
My money is on Biden knew the questions today!!!!!
So Biden is now saying we need to stop sending ourjobs out if thecountry. It is a great idea. However President Trump has been doing the job of bringing back our jobs since day 1. Biden is too busy plagiarising Trump‚Äôs ideas to know what he should do
Since neither party will give any of them any support now is the best time to help get a 3rd party to 15%.  I'm not voting for the lesser of two sex pest conservatives.  Biden is hot garbage and so is your party.  If you have to silence the truth to win you don't deserve to. ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
As I understand it, hearing was delayed an hour Because of Nadler‚Äôs accident. It was supposed to be over at 2 PM ET, and Biden‚Äôs talk was scheduled accordingly.
Bunker Biden, laying low.
Val Demings appears to be a solid pick for Biden's VP role in this hearing. Her comments around police are woke enough to appease AntiFa and moderate enough to appease real Democrats.
Lets see, Comey lied, McCabe lied, Brennan lied, Clapper lied, Strzok lied. Obama lied. Biden lied. Susan Rice lied...the whole Administration lied...NOT a single 1001 violation charged. ü§îü§îü§î WHY???
Another campaign slogan for Joe Biden, Vote for me or you will be killed

Joe Biden's new campaign slogan,  Vote for me or we will burn your city down.
Trump could have saved the lives of hundreds of Texans while also taking action to make sure their economy would thrive.  Instead he chose to ignore the spread of COVID, leading to mass death and economic turmoil. Texas loves Joe Biden!  #TrumpKillsTexas
He's  too Bernie,  I agree with him on Trump.  Don't like his views on Biden.
Complain about Biden and the Democrats on Twitter.
Not given a chance to put HER facts out? You mean MORE LIES. Face it, Obama/Biden are CORRUPT TO THE CORE! They spied and got caught. They MUST be charged with TREASON!
I mean I'm no Bernie Sanders supporter but I think he's not senile.. and not corrupt.  He's totally wrong.. but I think he means what he says and believes it..  Biden on the other hand is just a whore.. doing or saying anything to get elected.
I'm absolutely serious. Is there even one good reason to vote for Biden?  One?..  Help me here. I really don't get it.
Biden will never face Trump. His campaign will keep him hidden away allowing him out in only the most scripted and friendly environments. Now the VP pick will go toe to toe with Trump. She will be destroyed but at least her cognitive faculties will not be in question. #Trump2020
Imagine if President Trump started to talk and act like Biden. Would the MSM and the Dems demand that the 25th amendment be in play?

Fair enough, tho I'm not convinced it was Team Biden, it strikes me as Dodd &amp; the shitheels at Politico stirring the pot. Still, I'm waiting to see what Joe does about it, officially. We absolutely do not need campaign surrogates going off on their own stick like this...
Karen Bass will not be Biden‚Äôs runningmate.  Take it to the bank.
same for biden with african americans**
he won latinos in texas by more than 15% in a fractured feild. he was clearly the candidate they perfered, something that would drastically improve his chances at winning the state on a general election. it‚Äôs the same for biden in a state like georgia, for example.

Focus your unsought, inadequate advice elsewhere. I donate monthly to Biden &amp; 13 other candidates. Progress &amp; change can happen rapidly, in steps, or not at all. Temper your idealism with some realism. Democracy implies compromise &amp; shd be as inclusive as possible. #DontBeAMaga

My interpretation was give in to the narrative that Dems &amp; GOP/ Magas &amp; Biden supporters are the same. Telling liberals not to vote for Biden is Trump-affirming &amp; as regressive as it gets.
I‚Äôm asking Ryan as respectfully as I know how. I haven‚Äôt forgotten his inspiring effort to remove Trump &amp; GOP from office, prior to Biden winning S.Carolina. Now that no longer matters.
I just signed a  petition to  and  calling on them to include ending marijuana prohibition in their campaign platforms. Sign here:
I like the idea of Medicare for All.  Also think Biden‚Äôs plan below is excellent &amp; more appealing to a majority of Americans. Also more  progressive than any ideas I‚Äôve seen from you for months now.  I miss the Blue no matter who Ryan.

My personal opinion is that Joe Biden needs to get out on social media much more whether it's having a town hall on MSNBC or NBC or any of the channels and to reach out more to the Latino and black communities they are waiting to hear from him. This is how we have to do it¬°
Lol Joe Biden doesn't have anything to do with the protests. Most of the protesters don't even want to vote for him. These protests are literally Trump's protests. Righties love to say that this is what it'll be like under Biden, but it's literally like that now under Trump??
Well apparently his visual acuity is right up there with Biden's mental acuity.
America is safer with Biden in the basement. He is just another  empty suit that the Dems can control. A vote for Biden is a vote for communism.
And still, where's Basement Biden?
Remember when Trump was campaigning for Bernie Sanders to beat Joe Biden so that he could incorrectly claim that Democrats are "Socialists?"  He failed, but that doesn't mean he won't gaslight Americans into believing that Joe Biden is the Trojan Horse Candidate for Socialism.
Peter Schweizer, Clinton Cash author, has a new book,  "Fallout".  This book describes the corruption of Biden, Obama, Clinton with Russia and China. Claims Biden is even more corrupt than Clinton .  Remember, Dems always accuse you of that which they are guilty of

Wow i think that was Biden.  If Biden knows the answers why did he not do anything in decades?  As per Kamala Harris he was against bussing, he put the crime bill forward, he adored Robert Byrd his mentor which founded the KKK.  Biden sucks.
Friends of Biden are taking shots at her because she took shots at him. There is no love loss there - this is a ticket being pushed by the party not the nominee.

You compare the US to other countries, or when asked a question, you deflect by saying, ‚ÄúIn other countries....‚Äù You are the President of the United States, but hopefully, come Jan 2021, Joe Biden will be President and I won‚Äôt have to listen to your deflections anymore!
My bigger concern about Warren is what happens to her Senate seat if Biden wins. MA has a GOP governor and seems highly likely he would appoint another Republican to fill Warrens seat if she became VP and if Dems take the Senate back this year, it's not going to be a huge margin.
Joe Biden is anything but an appeaser. Now, let‚Äôs talk about people who can‚Äôt say no to you...
Honestly, my bigger concern about Warren as VP is her empty Senate seat if Biden wins. Massachusetts has a Republican governor and you know he'll appoint a Republican to fill her vacancy and if the Dems retake the majority this year, it's not going to be a huge majority.

A rock could beat Biden!
You mentioned Daniel Cameron and his hesitancy to press charges while also pointing out his support of Trump but it's not Cameron's job to do so. It is the district attorney's role. The district attorney is a Democrat and a Biden supporter. I was making a similar observation.
if Kamala Harris had not been loyal to the #LGBTQ community when it was politically popular, we would have had to wait even longer to get married in California. she is loyal even when it doesn't help her politically.  if anyone understands that, my guess is it would be Joe Biden.
If Rep. Val Demings isn‚Äôt picked as Joe Biden‚Äôsrunning mate then we definitely need her to run against the idiot DeSantis in 2022.
Yes BIDEN 2020 Vote Blue all the way
I don't think that was ever really an option since Biden is being cast in the role of being a functional and rational adult and sped up VP process would have run against that narrative whatever else the merits might have been.
Trump is his buddy. Biden is his friend. The only candidate who won't block a prosecutor from bringing him down is
I personally don't care if Harris is not the VP selection. Just like you are surrounded by people you can work with to accomplish your goals, Biden has a right to select a WOMAN as he promised. It is people like you who want to change the VP requirements after such a promise.
I would rather be spending my time campaigning for #BidenHarris2020 than I would trying to split my time talking about Joe Biden and the vice presidential race. It's becoming tiresome, Joe.
We don‚Äôt care how we have to do it..WE ARE VOTING. TRUMP MUST GO....   BIDEN WILL WIN.

It really doesn't matter *that much.*  #WeWillVote for Biden/Ham Sandwich over Trump/Pence.  The sad reign of the #KingOfExcuses is coming to an end.
niether will biden, but a lot more police will die of covid if trump is reelected.
Any chance you Useful Idiots can break down the Tara Reade story on a future episode? Maybe review the exculpatory evidence that has dropped since your first interview?   Seems kind of important given the accusation that Biden assaulted her and the subsequent push to replace him.
I bet you Joe Biden's Password is Joebidenspassword.
Considering Biden is running, why is Warren too old?
Karen Bass walks back Castro comment amid VP vetting  via  I hope biden picks this pos  Guaranteed to  lose.
Just to clarify: I'm all in on Biden. I think when people say he's the lesser of two evils, they're putting the two on almost equal footing, and saying one is just a little less bad. No. One is a good choice, the other a terrible one.
the Biden regime will deliver more conservative policy and more austerity than Trump
According to the RCP average, Biden is up by 6 in Florida. Maybe, MAYBE with that kind of performance, Dems could take control of the Florida House. That would be a big deal, not only for redistricting, but just for the kind of stuff that only matters if you live in Florida.
Assume nothing in #FloriDUH
picking up biden intel from his hacked twitter DMs all very convenient
As a former servicemember I am proud of what your husband did for our country.  I look forward to his service in a Biden Administration.
Can I just ask..So you're for Biden and he supports blm and antifah who support defunding the police..So you support defunding the police and burning and looting..? Well then don't call the police when you have a problem..
we're going to be at peak societal collapse around the beginning of November, and Biden will win, and us poor folks will have to keep trying to survive while the liberals obnoxiously celebrate around us and do absolutely nothing to help anybody
In Florida, Joe Biden is reaching polling heights Hillary Clinton never did
ALT HEADLINE find the Biden voter
So all this Kamala Harris slander has low key got me wanting Biden to pick her anyway.. cuz I can‚Äôt stand trifling ppl who hate on ambitious black folks but if it was a white person doing the same, it would be glorified.
hi i am a ceh in tampa also, trump is here today, seem coincidental? do kushner and miller seem like the kind of guys that wouldnt want screenshots of biden or obamas DMs? hellooo?
A Tampa 17 year old hacked Obama, Biden, &amp; Elon‚Äôs TwittersüòÇ Pretty crazy stuff! Honestly, I hope his punishment isnt harsh.. They should hire him to build more secure platforms.

Gen Z Democrats say Trump is Swamping Biden Digital Ads ... Five Trump Ads for Every One Biden Digital Ad ...
I think having never held elected office will hurt her chances. But I also don't think that Biden has actually chosen yet. Which means Kamala is still in the running.
I don't understand why Elizabeth Warren isn't the leading contender for the VP spot. No offense to those in contention but Karen Bass? I mean she's great in her own right but is she going to draw in voters who weren't already on Team Biden?
Biden is a stodgy old white guy - and that‚Äôs fine. Old voters like that I guess.   He could use some style to this campaign!!!
Don't forget Joe Biden's 1994 Crime Bill which has incarcerated more black Americans than any other legislation EVER.
Guess he's hiden with Biden. Laying low with Joe.
thanks to the old ass trashy white men claiming to support Joe Biden who keep inserting racism and or misogyny at every point in the process these days, at least we know Kamala can weather any GOP criticisms of her.
I much prefer a Biden coup (USA) to a Trump coup (Russia).
Omg. Right here in Hillsborough Co. biggest breach in Twitter‚Äôs history, took over accts of Obama, Biden, Bill Gates and more. $100,000 in bitcoin. 17 yo but will be tried as an adult. He‚Äôs going away for a long long time!

I just don't get it. This is not making Biden look good or helping him in any way.

Joe Biden Tweet: Crimate Clange
Its gonna be annoying to watch DeSantis get re-elected in another close one in 2022. A lot of these GOP Govs screwing up these responses will see a much better environment for them then barring Biden choking his lead away
You are the one that should be ashamed supporting a dumbass like Biden. Please look up some of his speeches and educate yourself.
Remember that 'Bitcoin' Twitter hack from a few weeks ago that targeted Obama, Biden, Elon Musk, etc and locked out verified users?  Authorities say the mastermind was a 17-year-old from Tampa. He's facing 30 felony charges.  Big scoop from  ‚§µÔ∏è
Pretty sure you will find Hunter Biden spent plenty of time on orgy island!
It's been over 43 years since you started public service, and Joe Biden has done little to help the American people.

What exactly have dems done in Biden, Pelosi,Schumer 30-40 years?
It would have to be private security, since they want to defund police departments. Not a dime until we see THREE debates between Trump &amp; Biden.
Or Obama and Biden üòÇ
Can you please let Joe write his own tweets, its time for this country to see what Joe Biden is really like.
The dailymail reports fake news
So you‚Äôre lying that she‚Äôs lying, comical
Where did she admit she was lying?
Even if a mafia threatened your family and your life? Doubt it
This tweet is almost as funny as people thinking Biden can win the election. Democrats need to save some energy for those Nov 4 riots. üòÇ
please do not forget that Joe Biden very much helped Barack Obama win Florida so he knows better than to pick someone with Castro problems so stop it.
thanks to all the super unhelpful old as hell white men who ran political machines 20 years ago, now Joe Biden gets to pick Kamala Harris and say he went with his gut and bucked machine politics.
Chris Stirwel  just discredited his own words he said that no President back delegates, but yet Obama back Hillary right from the get-go and stumped for Hillary and told Biden to step back it was her turn. But for Biden he waits till now to back Biden. Did he forget
Look, idiot, more testing doesn‚Äôt lead to more cases. Unless you‚Äôre counting every test as a positive. This virus has spread throughout this country unchecked while you rage tweet like a madman and blame everyone but yourself for the mess you will be leaving Biden in November.
When you don't check your social media message requests for a while, &amp; when you do, you find heartwarming notes from Biden fans. Like this one, from someone named "Skyy", that was sent to me in March. (Gotta love that voter outreach, Joe‚Äîthis stuff brings *everyone* on board!

No matter how bad you hate trump if you have kids can you vote Biden
If you got confidence in Biden go forit I‚Äôm too old to care your only choice is trump or Biden I think I‚Äôll take my shot with trump it‚Äôs sad Biden is all the dems got i think Bernie would have been better
the way biden is probably gonna pick kamala for vp
Your "hot mic" example did not catch Biden saying one single inappropriate, or sexually suggestive, thing.  Every single point noted about body language is accounted for by the generation gap and by the young girl's sense of bodily autonomy being invaded.
Thread. Biden's team better wake the hell up. They are seriously dropping the ball.
Yes, really.  I'm voting for Joe because Elizabeth Warren (who I voted for in the Primary) did not gain enough support, and because Kamala Harris was out of the race, very early on.  Biden is a fossil of an era where men felt comfortable imposing themselves on women and girls.
Democrats will continue this atrocity until Joe Biden wins which he won't they also.want ppl to vote through mail in votes bc it will be a disaster &amp; room for fraud in high numbers its already happening &amp; its the only way the can cheat so Joe Biden could win &amp; we can't.allow that
Agreed. This is making Biden look weak and petty.
These old white men need to shut their traps on Biden's VP search. These leaks and attacks on Harris make Biden look weak and not in control.
No one listens to Ed Rendell. Not for a long time. I sure hope Biden doesn't.
I don‚Äôt care who thinks what and you shouldn‚Äôt either. Joe Biden ***will not win*** with anyone but  ESPECIALLY if he needs to introduce the world to one of his fringe picks. This is silly.

This situation is very common. The crises of couples &amp; families affected not just by COVID but by means-testing meanness--burning through savings to cover rent/mortgage &amp; all the copays/deductibles/bills thanks to employer-based healthcare that Biden et. al. insist is best. NOPE.
Sounds like you read that right out of the Obama/Biden handbook. #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Mark my words; if Biden wins in November you will see all the Covid-19 panic and violent protests suddenly and "mysteriously" go away, but if Trump wins there will "intentionally" be 4 more years of this mess!!
REALLY  YOU COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN A BETTER PICTURE OF BIDEN? what are working for Trump?
Biden is a more effective opponent to the revolution than Trump is.
Biden's not going to stop any of that, he isn't even saying that he will.
1. Who has the ability to stop Trump, and  2. Will/has Biden publicly pointed that out?
'Settle For Biden' Is Real, and It's Spectacular   It should read Settle For The End Of America or Settle For Communism
It was inappropriate at a funeral.. It was not a rally for Biden which is what he made it into. Shameful...
Well said.
He does seem to be extremely worried, yes. For someone to behave like that at a supposed friends funeral, he has to be extremely worried about something and I imagine he knows Biden is going to lose the election.
Stop it. Tell your people why they should stick with 45. Biden has the advatntage that he has a heart, can appoint qualified people and isn't seeking the presidency to stay out of jail or to enrich his family. #enoughisenough
It's sad what Dems are doing to our children using them 4 political games &amp; ideology so Joe Biden can win the white house over, they will ruined our country with their socialist plan which will devastate our way of living &amp; the economy not 2 mention high taxes 4 hard working ppl

This Biden is INSANE, no ability to speak, walk on his own, so prop him in the seat of the PRESIDENT and make sure Democrats have the STRINGS to pull and make it look like He is doing his job? I will take my chances with another 4 yrs TRUMP.
I love that Joe Biden has an entire ad about wearing masks and keeping our fellow citizens safe. üëçüèæ
now that we know Jared Kushner is responsible for 150,000 deaths, i imagine we'll get to hear more about that Biden kid who the president already got impeached for lying about.
I worry about you touching children since you're a pedophile.  I worry u will sell influence just like u sold us out to China &amp; Ukraine so #HunterBiden could get a billion dollars. Joe Biden u spent decades being a politician doing nothing except getting rich.
not one person on this planet actually believes Joe Biden or Kamala Harris is a socialist thanks to the years long assault on them from actual socialists, so thanks for helping us beat Republicans, y'all.
Biden/Harris is like the good guys with infinity rings. Harris/Castro 2024 is the end of racial injustice and a new golden age for American ideals.

What‚Äôs evident is all of her detractors have vendetta‚Äôs or have skeletons that make them person‚Äôs of interest. They fear her. America needs someone with upstanding character and moral fiber that strikes fear cause let‚Äôs be frank, Biden really doesn‚Äôt. These are unusual times.
Silver alert, someone tell Joe Biden where he is...
Trump is going to do anything he can because he knows he will LOSE against Mr. Biden. The entire country knows trump does not like to lose and so he is going to do anything he can The BS about Mail in voting is sick. Trump himself says Absentee Voting is good (Same thing Mail in)
Biden has already shown he‚Äôs tougher on China than trump. In January, Biden called for us to be tough on China &amp; demand transparency from Xi on coronavirus...at the same time trump was (checks notes) doing nothing but calling it a hoax &amp; praising Xi for doing a great job.
No one thinks Biden is the best candidate but at least he would surround himself with good people not like the goons that drape them selves around the president. Aren‚Äôt a lot of them in prison now?
if her colleagues didn't like her, then why did Kamala Harris have more total endorsements than anyone but Joe Biden in the primaries even after she dropped out?  more foolishness from some foolish washed up clowns.

Calm down? Everyone‚Äôs been justifying trumps rape case, nah keep fucking on
No. Not in the slightest bit the same scale.  At no time has Biden ever hinted at sexual impropriety with an underaged person.  By *extreme* contrast:
Didn‚Äôt see that coming!He‚Äôll Slick Willy his way out of it and, if Biden‚Äôs elected, all these investigations will go away.
You obviously didn‚Äôt watch the last election where Killary was to win my a landslide. Biden has no chance so be prepared for another 4 years of greatness
So you want someone that is in cognitive decline? Biden can even put together a sentence and you think he can run the country? Trump will easily win the 2020 election!!
Last I checked.  We weren‚Äôt close to 15M unemployed on Biden‚Äôs watch.  With a million people filing for unemployment weekly.  I‚Äôm looking forward to you serving me appetizers at the local eatery when Trump loses in November, Ronna.

She would be a disaster as VP if Biden is elected.  Vote Trump and a red ticket all the way!
It wAs working out well until China sent their damn virus to our shores.  Fact is this those swamp creatures in Congress hate Trump because he doesn‚Äôt bow down to their demands.  Joe Biden will kiss China‚Äôs ass and all of our jobs will again go overseas.
. blasts  for coming to #Tampa today to fundraise instead of dealing with coronavirus
We knew what to do in March. Biden warned of this in JANUARY. A coordinated, federal response with a POTUS not downplaying the virus, calling it the Democrats new hoax, pushing stupid anti-malarial drugs, could have saved lives and jobs. Yet here we are.
Save it from what? Hasn‚Äôt he been in office this whole time? I mean the guy shows footage of total chaos from current America under Trump and blames Biden who is somehow doing this by hiding... I feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills.

I'm surprised at Obama &amp; his less than nice speech that showed his true colors it was mean and lies what he said shame on him I thought he had better sense defending the rioters &amp; not our military &amp; police no wonder ur being investigated go hide in the basement with Joe Biden
He's not going to lose the election. The boomers will vote Biden over Trump. I am voting 3rd party.

So what are you going to think when Biden does?
And Biden still cannot state one sentence correctly.  What is he going to do when on a call with leaders from other nations? Or god forbid in a room with people like china who want to destroy us and he has to remember he even represents america.  China virus
No i support facts.  Where did the virus originate??? Answer china.  Does china give a shit about us?NO. Does Biden say that china is not a foe? Yes. DId Hunter Biden make a billion from the china government? Yes.  FACTS!
Joe Biden without question using my legally requested Mail-In Ballot. Because I‚Äôm not an idiot that wants to stand in line for 3 hours to vote. That happened before in Florida &amp; people got üò§ angry so they fixed that debacle. POTUS is a Bozo!
Because President Trump is our best hope for a future for this country. Biden and his ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù will be the end of the US as it was envisioned.
Recent polls putting Biden ahead of Trump pushing fundraising efforts from

Any voting fraud is from Republicans. Voter suppression also from Republicans. Republicans cheat. They  don‚Äôt believe in actual representative govt and thereby fight against democracy itself. Biden must win to save our democracy. This is not hyperbole.
If you look at the rate of Biden's mental decay, I'm not sure he'll be around by Nov 3rd. I shudder to think if Biden were to win and we lose the Senate in 2020, this would cause a cataclysmic social and violent event that would end the US.
China owns biden they bought him through Hunter
The majority of republicans in Congress would rather have Biden as president.
Why do MSNBC give the president time to make political statements like it did in 2016. Free rallies every day and not answer questions. We want Biden to have the same amount of free press or stop it altogether.
My timeline is weirdly sexy this week. Sex with demons &amp; #DemonSemen are apparently a thing. The Master Boaters for Trump are planning to sink Biden. People comparing masks to condoms &amp; talking about giving up sex forever if it would send Trump to prison. Weird, wild stuff!
If you truly loved your country, you would have endorsed  . She's the real change. Biden is just a blue Trump.
Not to Joe Biden.
lmao! Please find a new line of work. Go see whats wrong with Biden's Head. We all know something is very off there
Its literally Biden's best potential EC map
You elect biden
Maybe but you will be a albatross around Biden's  neck. At least you agree with locking up black people for small offences.
She will fit in well on the Biden team.
Bush, Cheney normalized ... Trump criticized for removing troops from Syria and Germany? Maybe he should conform the way Obama did ... the Change candidate has won 3 straight elections (so the DNC selects Biden)
I Joe Biden and I‚Äôm guilty of this message.
Although I have decided (reluctantly) to vote for Joe Biden, this troubles me: of all the women whose hair he sniffed, or whose necks he kissed, or whose shoulders he rubbed, not one of them was black.  Not. One.  So, is Joe Biden just a pervert, or is he a racist pervert?
Well her and Hunter Biden anyway
Joe biden doesn't support dismantling the police (which is the true goal of the rioters).  So no, it will continue. And they will just call Joe biden racist. Because... He is
Nate Joe Biden will never be President of the United states.  Never.
carrie bradshaw is voting for biden y‚Äôall know what to do! üí´‚ú®üßö
I hope they do a follow up video if Biden wins and he sees how much more is taken. üôÑ
Plus-envious of any country now that has a sane, NORMAL, reasonably intelligent, caring human as their leader. That gets science. It‚Äôs incredibly stressful to have to endure this death, this mayhem, this mass confusion...these lies...We are just so f*cking over it ü•∫#Biden
Biden is an alleged sexual predator so idk what you're on about
I so hope Biden is elected because once Assange in extradited I'm betting we're gonna get a "twofer" with you as well. You don't just want Trump to get reelected, you need him to get reelected. I can't believe I thought you and Matt and the Intercept were gonna advance journalism
What do u think it was in the civil war ww1&amp;2 ? They had elections.. UE just making excuses Bc trump is way behind and u don‚Äôt want Biden .  This is going to b a landslide nothing u or trump can do about it !!
You are pathetic the coverage on Fox for Lewis was excessive as an avid Fox Watcher I had to turn it off. Especially when the most corrupt president in the history of America used his funeral as a campaign rally for Biden
What a mess I hope Biden fires this guy Jeesh
Exactly when did you start working for the Biden campaign??
Why is my bar for who should be president so low that this one statement puts Biden leaps and bounds ahead of Trump.  So looking forward to the day when waking up I don‚Äôt have to think ‚Äòplease don‚Äôt have tweeted something moronic‚Äô #dream #why #icanteven
It says they weren't invited from the fake racism claims which are lies Biden says vote for me r ur not black, crime bill, Byrd's my mentor.  Spare me the crap
Biden sucks. Vote for Biden.
Twitter is a strange place, politicians &amp; media use it in the roaring 20's, but the 2 party system in US is destroying America &amp; Twitter is part of that  And you support Nuclear Power Joe Biden Not going to win Florida w/that public policy.  Turkey Creek Nuclear plant is a danger
Apparently I‚Äôm dumb bc I said that Biden isn‚Äôt part of the radical left üòÇ and his ‚Äúproof‚Äù was that Bernie backed him üòÇ apparently the libertarian party is radical left, too üòÇ and Joe Walsh üòÇ and everyone who isn‚Äôt a Trump supporter üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Yeah Biden approval ratings are soaring I bet ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Black People should buy up all the hood and bid it out for sale to big developers on your own and split it even shares and you‚Äôll make money instead of Biden Pelosi and them stealing your valuable land &amp; throwing you out in the suburbs-did they even ask Bkack ppl that? No!
Why you so afraid of a President who speaks his mind &amp; doesn‚Äôt blow smoke up ur ass. I know it looks like Biden &amp; the Dems are going to change the world for the better &amp; ur bored w/this life-but it will be a mess &amp; it‚Äôs to line their pockets with Green industry money
Yep if Biden is elected you will never worry about anything ever again. That‚Äôs how life works.
Cuz they didn‚Äôt want him there &amp; he respects ppls wishes. Trumps not fake-U ppl love ur fake talkin Presidents. Lewis wasn‚Äôt going to go to Trumps funeral either. From what i heard Biden didn‚Äôt go either,but he‚Äôs a real racist so i get that one. Lewis probably didn‚Äôt like him
If you know how terms work you know that Obama was sworn in in 2009, just like Biden will be in 2021, not 2020. So Bush owns everything from 2008.

China is the Democrats, the media, social media and the Democrats. They've got Obama, Bush, Clinton and Biden on a leash. California is now another Hong Kong. We're at war. They're hitting us every minute. The GOP is weak and pro-China. Uh-oh.
We know Uncle Biden ‚ù§Ô∏è
Or Biden. Or an average adult. Or a toddler. Or my dog.
Biden isn‚Äôt even being endorsed by the radical left. This thing is done! It‚Äôs over!  4 more years!!!!
We will once  again  have a president who can speak  in complete sentences!!  #WeWillVote  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #Biden
So you're voting for Trump? Or just not voting for Biden?
Biden may be unfit for the Presidency. trump is unfit for humanity.

We cannot have him removed or have him step down at this point.  I feel that sane Republicans that are leaning Biden would swing back to Pence.
WHERE ARE Republican Sens &amp; congressmen calling Biden senile? Why are they not on tv calling his plans disastrous for our country? Why? Why? Rhode Island Gov. Raimondo: Trump Is 'Insane' -- He Is 'Losing His Mind'

What is most interesting is her association to the U.N. and a growing speculation that Biden's mental health is worsening.  Though the Democrat leadership sees it as not an issue now, within 8 months if elected they will decide it is an issue.  If Biden steps down who becomes VP?
Oh really so Biden showing affection and love towards his grandkids is different tho?? Trumptards say the darndest things when it comes to their Master.
So you think Joe Biden is better deal ? I hope he remembers he's running for president that's the best candidate that the Democrats could come up with. I want somebody who is not in cognitive decline to be the president of the United States. #TRUMP2020
Reconsider your run for VP. Joe Biden and America üá∫üá∏ needs you. Time to serve your country.
Dr. Jill and Jennifer Garner is a hell of a kickoff, Moms for Biden.
How about we all agree on mail in voting if Biden agrees to debate Trump?  Problem solved.
You will be gone...don‚Äôt worry..Biden is moving in January 20TH.
Leak in the Dam? Babysteps?  I will donate $100 to the first  SENATOR who says they are not voting for Trump (abstaining is fine dont need them to endorse Biden).

But Biden though????
In my opinion any almost would be better than sleepy  joe senile Biden A career corrupt politician
Gee I wonder why LOLOL The stable genius is going to win by a landslide!  Poll: Trump voters have higher enthusiasm than Biden supporters
She harbored a Chinese spy for years. Biden sold influence to, China to enrich Hunter. He extorted the Ukraine. Wow you liberals sure can pick them.
Voting and participating in the democratic  process  are key. The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change  agent you  have  in a democratic society.  You  must  use it because  it is not guaranteed.  You can lose it  ~John Lewis  #WeWillVote  #Vote  #JohnLewisMemorial  #biden
Of course - but they go on record when they vote. That's important.  I can prove it's important- all the Dems or Independents who oppose Biden brings up his past voting record.
Unfortunately the youth that went to Bernie's rallies didn't show up to vote in the primaries.  And yes, the DNC did everything it could to make Biden super viable.  Ultimately we failed. We just didn't get behind anyone else in a big enough way.
Nope. Not what I said. Here, take a look at this and tell me what is missing from the Dem platform:
what doe's that have to do with Biden authoring a bill designed to accelerate the incarceration rate? and proudly bragging about that bill up until very recently?
If we can go to the grocery story, Home Depot, restaurants, &amp; Disney, surely we can mask up and spend 10 minutes in a voting booth. Mail in votes are fraud and they‚Äôre asking for it bc they know Biden will never beat you!
Great New Hampshire üëç Can you please give #Florida a friendly in-service #electiondayholiday #Biden
I don‚Äôt think we should put anything past him. He is clearly mentally ill and treasonsous. This can‚Äôt be confirmed by the rule of law-because he demolished the rule of law.  please ditch your King Fuckwad. Our entire country is at stake.   #Biden
He is not wearing a mask inspite of many of the people around him getting the virus so he can get COVID-19 too.  An excuse not to run against Biden in November.
Biden wins in a landslide that‚Äôs all u really need to know.
We have a functional, mobilized radical left for the first time in 40 yrs. An empowered, emboldened, right wing (thanks to the influence of the Lincoln Project) Democratic Party will be the biggest threat to that. Yes, Trump bad but if Biden loses you can expect huge protests
If in doubt I suggest you remove political ideaology differences from the equation &amp; focus on the honesty and integrity for comparison of the 2 Candidates. You won‚Äôt find Joe Biden‚Äôs Niece writing a negative book on him.
Joe Biden shoepeg corn pop for his VP.
Trump won‚Äôt admit it, but he won because people hated Hillary. People like Joe Biden this time around, so as long as Trump continues to be Trump, this is going to a crushing win by Biden.
Check out Ben Shapiro on Joe Rogan last week talking about this. Clinton was not ahead of Trump in Texas and It‚Äôs showing Trump and Biden within the margin of error IN TEXAS NOW. The local and national polls in 2016 were much more favorable to Trump then than they are now.
Would the corporate press try and explain away everything Biden did? If so him
So Biden was correct to predict that the Liar in Chief would bring it up? trump's entire presidency - every lie, every drop of his epic incompetency - is ripe for a 'scathing denunciation.'
All week, I keep on getting fund raising emails from Biden campaign, most featuring a potential VP candidate. Is he looking to see which one will draw in most donations? üòá
Yes. A Biden Landslide victory. #SweepyJoe

At least you‚Äôre honest and that‚Äôs refreshing. I did not vote for Trump but I can tell you with honesty. I research Biden‚Äôs legislative record compared to the laws and executive orders passed by Trump. Biden is a lot worse to Blacks than Trump is. Facts
Between the USPS store and Joe Biden/VP merch I‚Äôm literally about to give my paycheck right back.
Doubtful. Haven‚Äôt seen ONE Biden sign/sticker or poster. #fakenews
Biden‚Äôs on fire all right.
Biden is definitely a puppet. No doubt about it
Joe Biden, his bones are brittle, his brain is mush.
Sleepy üò¥Joe Biden needs 24 hour nurses and definitely not in the Oval Office  What is wrong with the DEMS ü§Øü§™ü•¥minds that they are pushing and ü§ëfund raising for a very old senile üòµsick Biden THAT SHOULD RETIRE
He has to come out now. He knows Barr/Durham are coming at him soon. He's hoping Biden wins - but he can't be sure. So, he's beginning the next phase of outright support of sedition. He's been behind everything all along.
Now do you think the president should accept the outcome or should we or should we go around calling Joe Biden‚Äôs presidency illegitimate?  I mean Hillary is still complaint and trying to blame everyone but herself.  Your thinks they have  this in the bag the kids again.
‚ÄúAnd remember, if you want to be a good member of the Scuba Squad you‚Äôll have to wear a mask. Also, be nice to the pizza delivery guy Biden. It‚Äôs not his fault he can‚Äôt read.‚Äù -Dr. Fauci (probably) #covid19 #Fauci
You know I can‚Äôt imagine anyone voting for Biden or half the dems but i hope trump don‚Äôt mess it up with his mouth
I‚Äôm pretty sure people aren‚Äôt insinuating it‚Äôs disappearing but if Biden wins the actual coverage of the virus will disappear. Two references would be the protesting coverage along with the lack of coverage of the Swine Flu in 2009/2010. I‚Äôve actually had both!
Lol.  Biden couldn‚Äôt run a hotdog stand.
I bet, I‚Äôm sure your lube and cantaloupe with Obama painted on it are warmed up to his body temperature. Obama the loser uses a funeral for votes for Biden-disgusting but we already learned that about him-he used black ppl before &amp; is doing it again-big lies coming ur way again
As long as Trump loses before Jan 20th, when Biden takes the oath of office, it doesn‚Äôt matter when the election is held.  The shorter that ‚Äúlame duck‚Äù Trump is in power, the better.
I saw this weird headline the other day, that for some event he was doing, Biden had written in his notes something about not to hold a grudge against Kamala. I didn't actually read the story.
This is contrary to reality. Plenty of videos and photos show Biden and Obama meeting with people, comforting them, etc. Few such anecdotes even exist of Trump doing the same. Specifically, when has he even acknowledged, much less commiserated the staggering death toll of covid?
Democratic Georgia State Rep. Vernon Jones joins ‚ÄòFox &amp; Friends Weekend.‚Äô... Rep. Vernon Jones weighs in on Biden‚Äôs search for running mate...  #WalkAway #DeepState
Biden's lies for black (and white-privilege guilt) votes
What does that say when Biden won‚Äôt even attempt to pass a test that your 5 year old can pass? Trump was showing that it‚Äôs a very basic test. It wasn‚Äôt to show his smarts, it was to show Biden incapability.
NOBODY forgot about him like they do you!! He's NOT running for President, this is between Trump &amp; Biden NOT the kids, otherwise you, Don Jr, &amp; Ivanka WOULD be in some serious trouble!! Be careful what you wish for, ESPECIALLY being that you're part of the Trump CORRUPTION!!

Joe Biden says Trump's failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump
Is the press in the United States aware that hey free and unbiased press is not tolerated in socialist countries. That means the idiots in the media that are pushing people to vote for Biden which means a vote for socialism will very shortly after the election will not exist!
I'm a unaffiliated, I like options and ideas. I will be voting on November. I will be voting for Biden... #WeWillVote   and then.... #SaveTheDateforTrump
Joe Biden is so far ahead in the polls the are going to issue a Silver Alert soon.
In fact, even if Biden wins in November, MOST of his support is likely to be a combination of working class and minorities. College educated whites will not make up a majority of the Dem coalition anytime soon. 2/2
The Black and Latino working class will still overwhelmingly back Biden, though. Those groups are critical to the Dem coalition and Biden wouldn‚Äôt come close to winning without them.  Either way, current polling is showing a shift toward Biden in the WWC as well. 1/2
You and about a million other people have done it too. But it can be done with Biden, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc. Know why? Because politics is all the same game just different players.
Are you going to apologize to Joe Biden, now?
They call our president unwell and crazy yet Joe Biden is in the basement with a bib.
Schools are safe, voting is not. Got it. I will crawl over glass during a hurricane to vote for Biden.
Well if that is slanderous the. The president has thousands of law suits he can file against Pelosi Schumer Shiff Brennan Clapper Obama Biden and a whole host of others who have slandered his name and lied repeatedly about the Russian hoax.  They knew there was no collusion!
Democrats have made a mockery of our electoral process and it is them that has cast doubt about n whether the process will be fair.  Remember democrats for theee years stated that Trump is an illegitimate president. I wonder what the talk will be if Joe Biden wins by some miracle
That's a lie. Biden has committed to 3 debates. Also, tRump stumbles every time he speaks in public. His grammar is atrocious. You must not pay too much attention to him when he speaks.
i want to k word myself every time i open instagram .. biden lives in ur head rent free like he truly does not give a FUCK about u dear .. stop worrying about kanye 2020 and worry about what happens when daddy‚Äôs not paying rent anymore and ur stuck with a liberal arts degree üò≠
Another thing to remember, Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúDelay‚Äù tweet is an admission‚Äîan admission that he knows he‚Äôs currently getting blown out by Joe Biden. He‚Äôs very afraid.
And he will run ( or one of his devil spawn) again in 2024 and blame Biden for not solving all the issues he created
it‚Äôs actual delusion i cant imagine putting that much energy into ‚Äúsettle for biden‚Äù .. like we settled for capitalist bernie and the grassroots movement still failed it isnt getting better than that dear.. put that energy elsewhere .. you are obsessed with the bourgeois scam

Make that two. I wanted Warren to run in 2016 and I supported her in 2020. I voted for Hillary and I'll be voting for Biden.
Putin wins. Biden has no choice but to assassinate him.
You're right. It's divisive. I'm a lifelong Democrat. In 2016 I voted for Bernie and then Hillary in the general. I voted for Warren in the recent primary, and I'll vote Biden in November.
Lock him in and move Biden to Pelosis' office
Hillary, a seasoned politician, lost to Trump. To select a running mate by physical features is wrong. Biden cannot run a second term, leaving the VP to run for Pres. Trump will be Pres. again. This is not a beauty contest!

After you get long, meaty answers from Joe Biden, of course...
If you have a source for Biden saying that Trump's plan to contest the election - not simply move the date - will be pre-empted, please share it. Thanks!
Example; Trump‚Äôs cognitive test.  We laughed at him because the headlines were the test being simple and remembering five words.  What if we had experts talking about the what the test measures? Then we would have been talking about what Trump wants which is Biden taking the test
The swamp just threw up Joe Biden like an old piece of baked Just Fishing just to see what they can get the big fish or in 2024.
I totally agree, but I cannot vote for Trump or a third party candidate (because they would be a lame duck for their entire term.)  As much as I dislike Biden I don't have any choice but to vote for him.  Also, for better or worse, WE chose Biden, in the primaries.
Who will presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden choose as his running mate?   and  are live on #BattlegroundFlorida breaking down the possible VP candidates:
Biden hasn't even spoken out about it.
Biden is not a lying racist with dementia. A lying racist with dementia cannot/would not do this:
You can buy ‚ÄúPence will be the GOP VP nominee‚Äù on PredictIt for 89¬¢ a share (it turns into $1.00 if true, zero if false).  For 87¬¢ you can buy a share of ‚ÄúBiden won‚Äôt drop out before November 1‚Äù.  These are insane valuations.
I'm old enough to have seen the voting for lesser evils play out with no change.... I wish that was the answer but it doesn't work....so I support nuking .  They are years ahead of us in strategy where Biden is concerned.  They have the next 20 years planned out,bet on it.
If Biden wins the EC they will immediately pivot to wailing about the debt.
Far worse is Trump's lack of response to Russian bounties on American soldiers' heads. Get him to take THAT seriously, then we can talk about Biden's so-called "non-response" here.
Racial propaganda from that video clip would make me think the black population in MT rose by 5000% overnight. The same b.s. Trump did against Biden with the old lady on a 4 hour hold with 911 while her house was being broken into. Tap into white fear. Smh.
Even better news for Biden then
Mr. Biden did you happen to see the tweet from Mr. Trump about Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good) and then at the end saying (Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???)  Mr. Trump is trying to change the day of the election.
That is how I see it. I voted for him because Hillary. And he isn't better. Biden is a POS. Things will escalate soon.
Joe Biden Inadvertently Opens the Door to More Education Choice

You don‚Äôt walk away from Allies!  Trump has no understanding of this.  Yes, pressure all NATO nations to pay their fair share, but you don‚Äôt abandon those Allies! Vote for Biden on November 3, 2020!  The Date for Trump Supporters to vote  is Wednesday November 4th!
PLEASE send Biden to this brain bus!! He needs this badly!
Time to put Biden in office and get rid of the cancer in the oval office now before he totally destroys the country.

yeah if Trump was denying President Bernie I'd be lacing up my boots but Biden? lol
PA Republican here, you do not have my vote. Im voting for Biden. üñï
This is so dumb. Republicans saying a third party vote is a vote for Biden and democrats saying a third party vote is a vote for Trump. A third party vote is a third party vote. Vote for whoever you think will do best for the country. The two party system is a scam.
So ‚Å¶ described  as being ‚Äúcoherent‚Äù at the news conference. Coherent? Is that the new standard? Not ‚Äúmeasured‚Äù, not ‚Äúthoughtful‚Äù not ‚Äúin command of the facts‚Äù but ‚Äúcoherent‚Äù? Cops use ‚Äúcoherent‚Äù on DUI arrest reports. #trump2020
Some reports have named Chris Dodd as the ringleader of this obnoxious campaign against Harris.  Biden needs to get rid of him as an advisor on VP if he wants to win in 2020.
Right!  Exactly ‚Äúwho‚Äù stops him if he decides to not hold an election or honor the results?  SCOTUS? Does the government automatically just become Biden‚Äôs?  No.
So Kamala Harris got white men in Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign to slander and denigrate her so she could set her people on them? #MakeItMakeSense
What can  accuse Biden of next? All those honorable Russians providing facts and evidence are endeared to unwitting accomplices like Hank and depend on him to amplify lies.
I have been setting aside money to buy A LOT of #BidenHarris2020 gear the day it comes out, which drastically decreases the amount of money I have to spend on weed, which is becoming necessary to deal with getting to that point thanks to a few loud and wrong Biden donors.

I find it astounding that Biden does not go over 47% in any of these matches. This is why we can't count Trump out yet.
So wait, Biden supports expunging marijuana arrest records but doesn't support legalization?    I guess we'll just keep arresting people and then expunging the arrest records?

What are you guys talking about? Is Biden POTUS? Does he have powers of executive orders? Is he a senator? Biden doesn‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs at. He will do what his owners tell him to do. Nothing is more clear than the Democrat party is now openly a communist party.
a democracy constist of peace which you failed to give to all your constituents.  You allowed chaos to ensue and it is you that have president Trump all the political adds to use against Joe Biden.  Enjoy the loss in November.

If Biden wins it‚Äôs AOC‚Äôs party.
Joe Biden has a huge enthusiasm gap!  Joe Has a real problem remembering where he is.  Joe has a huge issue with Latinos and his support from the black community is decreasing as each day goes by. Joe lost the support of law enforcement.  We are the silent majority remember that.
Probably Joe Biden.
Kamala Harris lost my confidence in her when she used a bussing issue to paint Biden as if he was complicit with that issue. SHE HAD TSHIRTS ALREADY MADE AFTER THAT DEBATE. That's was cruel and inconsiderate of those who fought and died dealing with that  #WarrenorRice
Once HILLARY and OBAMA are fair game... Its a whole new ballgame...  after the DEMS COMMIT TO BIDEN... and MANEUVERING against A SWITCHEROO
If you think Joe Biden...if he wins will be running the show you are delusional. You will get your wish if as Ilhan, AOC and the rest of socialist/jihadist/communist freaks will be running the show. But hey don‚Äôt worry #socialism will work out this time...lol
I mean i said after Bernie backed down never Biden, but today Trump suggested postponing the election due to fraud. As much as i hate it i dont think there is an option
Easy and convenient to elect Biden.  Don‚Äôt fall for it FL- need in person voting for a fair election.  Verify ID to the person voting.  Unbelievable that you can vote in states like CA WITHOUT photo identification!!!
To LOCK-IN BIDEN  AS the ONLY top level actually running for office
He‚Äôs only trying to take the focus off of the terrible GDP number that came out this morning. Only Congress can change Election Day and just because Trump Is so far behind  Biden, he thinks he in his sick head thinks he can do this. Vote Blue all the way!
Biden Basement 2.0 ,Where the guilty and demented hide.
Ok trump your getting me worried why waste your time saying stupid things like delaying the elections it ain‚Äôt happening get on the ball get sht done stop crying like a little btch if you can‚Äôt beat Biden then you deserve to lose dum tweet make market go down your best thing
Biden comms have been great, but id like to him him get tougher on pythons üòâ
Just wait until you see the street named after Joe Biden.
Don the Con..you don‚Äôt have a chance in hell of winning. I would crawl over broken glass to vote for Biden.
Just admit that your a scared little boy to loose this election because you're a horrible businessman and even worse leader.  Just go back to your TV show and let America heal with Joe Biden!  BIDEN 2020
They picked Biden üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇBiden!!!!
don't care if bill barr's creepy gestapo is in the middle of a circle jerk in front of the lee county clerk, i will be voting for Joe Biden on November 3, 2020.
Am I the only one who doesn't want president pelosi in January? Give me an election and give me biden.
Do you really think biden can run this country? The guy cant even speak ir think right, that only is scary
Joe Biden, April 2020: "Mark my words. I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held.‚Äù
Trump campaign labels Biden's statement that Trump will try and delay the election as, "the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality."  Then Trump suggests delaying the election.  You can't make this up.  America in 2020.
are you all ready to take to the streets to defend your right to vote for Joe Biden?  yeah, me neither
Many people say you haven‚Äôt done yours and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre voting for Joe Biden.
And what has Biden done to prevent it? Nothing. He could easily ask his buds in the House and Senate to draft legislation that would make it mandatory for the courts to rule on an election challenge within 30 days, or something similar.  But no, just gripe about it. Cool.
BIDEN CALLED THIS IN APRIL
Why not let President Biden pick out his own color scheme in January?
Biden just gave very brief remarks, and he doesn‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs at. Keep trying to shift the focus to BS like this instead, but it won‚Äôt work.
Joe Biden called this in April. While it‚Äôs infuriating to read, it‚Äôs important to remember this‚Äîthe dates of federal elections are set by Congress, &amp; the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration. In other words, he can‚Äôt do shit.
Who is afraid of joe Biden... except small children?
He shows many signs, including his gait which is getting worse everyday. Soon he will need a wheelchair as walking will become impossible. He already needs help and direction. Pretty sad really #Biden
Loved that movie
I detect sarcasm, but I‚Äôve got plenty of action on Biden at +105 already.  And via the numbers Biden should be -220 or so right now. Trump threaded the needle last time with a ~29% chance, but if election was tomorrow it would be &lt; 3%.
You should be worry at your age to defend your property with defunding the police if biden wins, is going be a disaster!
You betcha!! Hopefully Biden Rice!!
No worries, I'm voting for Biden at the voting booth. Although you'll still vote by mail I'm sure.
Gotta get out of this morass somehow.  Also at the offshore books as of right now: Biden -160 Trump +140
You sound like a winey spendocrat that missed the rally!! This will pump until the late October. A Biden administration will provide the 15% haircut in the indices
Fact is there are alot more registered democrats than registered republicans. The anti Trump vote will far surpass the vote for Biden vote. Biden can become president if he goes more center.
What did you do already give up in Michigan and let Biden have that one.maybe try Ohio you might be able to get some votes there,but does,not look good.Better call Putin
Pro tip, shadow campaign is not the term you should use when writting anout white men trying to stop a black women from getting a job. Looks weird
It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúOperation Crossfire Hurricane‚Äù. There‚Äôs quite a few articles out there, key players, Obama, Biden, HRC, Stzok, Page, Wray, Steel and a few others,
would you prefer a 'whole bowl of shit''? if you're not for Biden, you're for trump. not hard. at least he has a chance; Bernie had none maybe try to get over it.

Vote for Joe Biden. He won't accuse your mother of being a violent anarchist and teargas her, or shoot her with a rubber bullet and leave her with brain damage. All for the crime of exerting her First Amendment rights.
These are the things Americans should know about Biden. Of course he won‚Äôt be in office long but his Vice President going to have the same ideas?
Such A Joke!!!  IF BIDEN KNEW HOW TO SAVE AMERICA, WHY DIDN'T HE TELL OBAMA!!!
You are an idiot, you work your ass off and live in the hood? Your racist brain can‚Äôt tell between lazy bastards all colors and those that build companies to work at WTF? Do you really know why Biden is in the basement? Haha.. Better learn
Bravo! Biden 2020
Law abiding DEM citizen here.  Love our country, hate #dividerinchief who only wants to divide and forward his  own agenda and make himself look good for which he is an utter failure.  he is strangling our nation and he will do anything he can to win this election .Biden for Prez
Biden will select whom he feels will help him carry out his agenda.

I love Harris. I do not fear her. She was by far my first choice for the actual nominee. But her stat is too bright. She would outshine Biden in the role of VP. The VP needs to be someone who can take a backseat. I‚Äôm not sure she is a backseat person.
SHAME! Jill Biden and your a Doctor no less should not the Hippocratic oath apply even more so when it comes to family?Your legacy Mrs. Biden will be a selfish woman, an opportunist, weak, look what you have allowed them to do to your family. S H A M E !
God you are so right Jill biden shoukd want his last years not to be toture but that what selfish people do. as far as the dems go theres is coming  once the real democrats realize that CNN the rest are lying to them its over  truth like sunshine. NO FILTER
Instead of asking for opinions, it is time to tell ppl that follow u on Twitter what you think about Trump, Biden, COVID, Portland, Seattle, George Floyd, Troop withdrawal in Germany. Get off the sidelines, Step up to the plate.
Honestly, not a fan of Trump in many respects. Yet, facts are facts. That he is has improved the US Economy drastically in the last 3.5 years. That was until Cov-19. Yet, not his fault. Regardless, we're going to need him to get us out of that mess. As Biden surely couldn't...
Why NOT, you guys did when you voted for Trump's incompetent ass!! Biden is 100% BETTER than Trump is on Biden's WORSE day!!
Michigan Threatens to Slip From Trump as He Goes Quiet on Airwaves
Have democrats lost their fucking minds they killed a black man because he had a difference of opinion, CNN &amp; MSNBC have said nothing in fact they didn't even mention or know his name just like the 3 young children that got shot bc of these rioters &amp; Joe Biden they fight dirty
Killing black ppl bc they support Trump.where is Al Sharpton, Rev Jesse Jackson, Oprah, or BLM there are none bc it wasn't a democratic supporter is this what we're doing now killing voters &amp; supporters so Joe Biden can win 4 political power this is inhumane &amp; democrats dont care
Is this the best we got in this 330 million people for president, Joe Biden, we are in big trouble he can't even speak right let alone run a country &amp; meet with foreign leaders what will Joe say to them rub my hair from my legs &amp; see it turn blond come on man this man is wierd
Lets face it Joe Biden couldn't save a fly if his life depended on it so how is he going to save this country this man is clueless and does not know what's going on in the real world how could he if he's stuck in the basement he does what they say and says the wrong things often
Its almost as if democrats have no feelings 4 human beings like their from another planet of fuck you all just so Joe Biden can win &amp; save the day when he can't even save himself from the misery that he will bring 2 this country with his not spoken policies &amp; hiding in his bunker
Just to remind everyone. I am not a Trump supporter. I am not a Biden supporter. I view them and the parties they represent as corrupt, dumb, and unprincipled authoritarian sell outs. (1)
Bottom line democrats would sell us to the devil if they could for money their so greedy for it that they can't see straight &amp; the thought of making billions makes it worth their fight 4 Joe Biden to win he will make them &amp; himself richer with our tax dollars business as usual
He didn't say Biden himself was a radical leftist, just that he's a puppet to them. I will say while that's somewhat true Trump himself is pretty much a puppet to radical right wingers
if ur truly a republican there is no way in hell you could ever vote for biden. no way.  If you really are.. Change you voter registration to democrat because you're clearly no republican.
Biden Obama didn't...
More like Biden is at the Bottom.
Deaths in Florida when Biden was VP.!!! Since election rigging was not needed it wasn't a panic... Is this Scamdemic magically cured after the votes are counted.???
How do you feel about people saying Biden will underperform Clinton with Hispanic voters? Is there any truth to it?
Biden‚Äôs been on his knees for a while.
One of the VP‚Äôs main jobs is to prepare and be prepared in the event they have to become president all of a sudden. An ambitious VP is definitely needed when Biden isn‚Äôt in his best health, folks just don‚Äôt want a black woman as VP
Like Biden as a Presidential nominee?

Glad to see ppl finally realizing Biden will not be the President. He will be the figurehead. The VP and Pelosi will be President. Biden will sign anything put in front of him. He will say what they tell him. Chameleon Harris &amp; Crazy Nancy in charge!
And the thing with voting, I can 100% tell you if Biden gets elected, we are fucked. Everything we‚Äôve done to this point would have been for nothing.
Global warming has been taking place for the last 20k years.  There are complete cities submerged all over the world.  Like Obama, Biden will sink $B‚Äôs into failed companies.  If we stopped using fosil fuels today, will Europe , China, and Russia follow suit?  Take a guess!

It certainly won‚Äôt improve under Biden. Trump only guy who stands for law and order. Have you heard Biden or any Dem leader condemn the riots? These are paid actors, you do know this? They will only stop when jailed or not getting paid.
If Biden knew how to fix America, why didn't he tell Obama?
I‚Äôve never seen a president who whines as much as Trump does. I just hope enough people will vote for Biden to get Trump out of office! #NobodyLikesTrump
The difference is that‚Äôs Trumps daughter sitting in his lap kissing his cheek. Biden is sniffing girls and groping them.
I've never seen child porn, so I wouldn't know. Unless you count watching Joe Biden touch little girls inappropriately on YouTube vids.
Trump and Biden tied in Georgia: poll
But Biden said he was definitely open to diverting police funding to other programs, which is one of the things PolitiFact said was meant by "defund the police."
A BIDEN Victory !!
The people participating in these gross attacks against very qualified women, are allies in Biden‚Äôs circle. We need them to exit
I think Biden will pick Harris. He's not going to play this game.
Like this is just a genuine albeit tongue-in-cheek representation of what I feel the correct position is, and it is a more honest stance than either pretending Biden is great, or pretending like he is equally bad as Trump.  Both of those alternatives are egregiously dishonest
Wrong.  Stop telling lies. Biden 2020
This is a newfound hill I will die on  It is both morally gross and practically ineffective for progressives to pretend like Biden is a genuinely good candidate.  To acknowledge this while still advocating for defeating the actual fascists is both honest and good praxis.
We need a woman VP. I back Senator Duckworth. She has the credentials that will allow Republicans to get behind the ticket. If Biden goes to far left he runs those Republicans off!
I‚Äôm just waiting for some kind of media dump in October when they find ‚Äúevidence‚Äù on Biden. We keep hearing that is coming and everyone will see the ‚Äútruth‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure there will be some good ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù dirt involving Obama too. The koolaid is strong!

No!!! I am voting for Biden. All my family in Florida and Texas is voting for Biden. If Trump gets re-elected, I am moving to another country. I can‚Äôt deal with four more years of hate, ignorance, arrogance, and lies.
At the end of the day, if Biden loses you can only blame him and the Democratic establishment. Period. So if he wants to assure his win. I suggest he step up
Opinion | The Media‚Äôs Biggest Favor to Biden Was to Ignore Him  via
I didn't ask anyone to vote for Biden. We all deserve much better.
Such an idiotic thought process too. You WANT a VP that's qualified to run for #47, not one sitting in the shadows doing nothing. While he's our best option right now, an 82 yo Biden is not the answer for 2024.
Why is anyone voting for Joe Biden? He's just a blue Trump! #VoteGold #JoNotJoe

Kamala is highly qualified candidate and as others point out, you need to pick someone who could be capabale to step in. If even true which I doubt, this is intended to harm not suppprt Biden. It‚Äôs not an ally if this is what they spread.
She must be related to Biden. Memory shot !!!  CRS full blown

Joe Biden will lose and it will get worse I'm afraid.
I‚Äôm agreeing with you. I think people are projecting misogyny onto Biden that isn‚Äôt actually there.
Let‚Äôs be honest here, the VP pick will probably be someone no one is talking about now. It‚Äôs alway been like that if you look at history. How many would have guesse Quayle, Cheney, Biden, Palin, (lol) Pence or Kain? Maybe Gore in 92 and Ryan were expected but that‚Äôs it.
Ok...followed...#FBR
Joe Biden has a 3rd sense. It is nonsense.
If Biden Is Elected, Residents Fleeing Chaotic Cities Like Seattle and Portland Are in for a Rude Awakening
He‚Äôs not a dem. He‚Äôs a NeverTrumper. He‚Äôll support the Biden ticket because it‚Äôs the right thing to do to get rid of Trump, but he‚Äôs not a Democrat.
Any person that Biden picks is going to get the full BS wrath of the Trump/right-wing dumpster fire machine. After the past 4-years Benghazi isn‚Äôt going to matter to anyone who isn‚Äôt already in team Trump.
I think people are misinterpreting the simple sentiment that when we hire someone, we expect their job to take priority over their future ambitions. Somewhere along the line, I think people twisted it into a misogynistic sentiment Biden never actually held.
Remember the ‚ÄúBiden is going to announce his candidacy and Stacy Abraham‚Äôs as his VP at the same time‚Äù?  That was such an odd story on every level.
You know why you all want Barr gone is because he is about to unveil what Obama/Biden did to president Trump and his administration and democrats are freaking out about what John Durham is about to reveal in his report.
I gotcha. I am in a similar boat. I find myself thinking like Ron Swanson and the Libertarian views. I only asked because based on your tweets I don‚Äôt see any hate towards Biden so it just had me thinking where you were at with this election.
LG was part of Ukraine coup along with McCain, Biden, kloubachar.
Most of Trumps true base are too dumb to even know who Susan Rice is at the moment. Any VP Biden selects will get the wrath from Trump‚Äôs re-election camp. More Trump voters know who demon sperm doctor is than remember Susan Rice.
Joe Biden will never be President of the United States. Never.
Joe Biden will never be President of the United States.
I feel that's why Biden was picked. The dnc wants him to get elected and then they have him step down and make his vp the president. Likely a woman and of color.
Well, who would you suggest Joe Biden pick as VP?
So by not voting for Biden, you‚Äôre actually placing a vote for Trump C‚ÄôMON MAN!
I want to see video of one white liberal guest being asked if Joe Biden is paying for his support. Or liberal black, Hispanic, Asian whomever. The media is the enemy of free thinking, peace loving Americans.
I am expecting indictments on trumped up charges (pun writes itself ) in October, maybe some perp walks up to Obama or Biden himself
I want Joe Biden to win.  But I really want Joe Biden to win Florida, just so I can say I live in a blue state.
Whhhaattt
Yeah Biden might not be the most exciting candidate, but that's not what it's about. It's about electing a candidate that has experience and policies that can effect our lives in a positive way. A lot of people don't vote for candidates with their best interests in mind.
Didn't Biden apologize for all that, and not supporting the gay marriage thing ?  ü§£üòÇüòÖ
Well, not to be morbid, but Joe Biden is 77, and Donald Trump is 74, so maybe their vice presidential picks are more important than usual for a reason.
Am the only white woman I know in Fla for Biden
Did he say and do all of this shit? Noooo. But we know now !  Biden 2020!!
Interesting thought but I don‚Äôt think that that would cause republicans and independents who were already voting for Biden to not do so.
Strikingly similar article to the one written in April about   the mad libs version of the VP whisper game.  'Joe Biden allies quietly working against (insert woman's name), claiming she is too (insert an otherwise complimentary adjective).'
You think conservatives who are willing to vote for Biden will still vote for him with Kamala on the ticket? Warren is a Harvard Law Professors who teaches constitutional law, yet your logic says we're better off with another person who has to learn on the job.  Research Kamala.
He can‚Äôt control opec prices . Just like he can‚Äôt make it rain or control hurricanes. You can‚Äôt bring up China , Biden sent our jobs there and then made millions.T put billions of tariffs on them so not a great comparison for your guy. Try some other kind of hate in the playbook

If I‚Äôm Joe Biden and I see a bunch of Kamala Harris supporters gearing up to play the ‚Äúsexism card‚Äù even though he has said that he would pick a woman VP regardless. I‚Äôd think that it would convince me selecting her VP would be more trouble than it‚Äôs worth.
I'm seeing that some liberals are now promoting a no-vote for Biden because of his "pro-business" stance. Can you help explain the pro-business stance of Democrats and why some liberals are so opposed to Biden?
Biden has said he‚Äôs picking a woman regardless so playing the ‚Äúwoman‚Äù card is kind of bullshit. Every time a woman candidates supporters do it, the tactic always seems to backfire.
Sounds like she's the best candidate if she's the only one getting smeared. Reminds me of all the Biden smear attempts that have tried &amp; failed.  Dodd's bs about Karen Bass also smacks of racist tone policing, of wanting a less assertive BIPOC woman. #fuckthatshit
Yeah, if you are pro life, do u choose the party of pro baby killing &amp; protects criminals from the death penalty?  Or the party that is anti abortion, &amp; a handful of death penalties befall criminals each year?  No logical prolife person would choose Biden based off this argument
This does not say anything about the definitive distinction between left and right wing values that motivate policy.  This does not say anything about the fact that Biden would be a republican 30 years ago.But if you can't decide between Biden or Trump? I suggest you go watch the Breakfast Club interview...

The Supreme Court's ruling gives Joe Biden the green light if he wins to enact whatever policy he wants and pay for it by taking the funds from the Department of Defense, which I'm sure the conservative Justices will treat the exact same way they've done here
You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads
Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn‚Äôt need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.
Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary
Biden has a great pick to chose from Kamala is Definitely one of them. Love all his picks. I chose Kamala before she even ran in the race.
Horrible company. 42 years of service and you treat me like this. Asking  to investigate your discriminatory practices shame you.
If biden chooses someone who was in the Venceremos then he will loose, many latin votes. Latin people are not willing to for give corporation with the castros. When i say latin i dont just mean cubans. Iean any country destroyed by socialist governments like castro's

Great. Let‚Äôs bring up that shameful episode again and again, add to the narrative that Biden is a sexist dirty old man, and watch the GOP pounce on that‚Äîjust until the Traitor and Biden are tied in swing states. Then we wring our hands, having given the GOP its August surprise.
The ‚Äúbad taste‚Äù is being manufactured by pundits making assumptions about what Joe Biden thinks. What ‚Äúthose around him think‚Äù about Kamala Harris should not be used to tarnish Biden himself. You‚Äôre doing the GOP‚Äôs dirty work for them, again.

Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
Scary scenario... how fragile our democracy really is! A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty  #TraitorTrump
Prediction‚Ä¶ Trump‚Äôs tweet yesterday about delaying the election was intentional to trigger Dems &amp; have them on record saying ‚Äúabsolutely no way!‚Äù . Then, Oct surprise will show all the crimes Biden committed coming to the surface. Dems will scream ‚Äúwe must delay the election!‚Äù

It‚Äôs pretty mind blowing to me how people like Matt S don‚Äôt actually listen to or read Biden‚Äôs policies. They are super moderate and many lean right. It‚Äôs also wild how people in America want to see criminal and anti-American activity from the WH and then claim to be Patriots.

A do think Biden‚Äôs number in the poll was right. It‚Äôs probably 51-49/48 right now or something like that.
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don‚Äôt accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
Ad: Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) Loves Joe Biden  via
Even more controversial take: I think Biden should promise trump not to prosecute him in exchange for trump leaving peacefully if Biden wins.
If I were to meet Joe Biden in person, I would welcome a hug and would know that it was offered with genuine kindness. Trump is so disgusting that the closest I want to be to him is to have a TV screen between us and a mute button close by.
Well, then we don‚Äôt need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is
Under Obama and Biden from October 2010 to October¬†2016, the¬†unemployment¬†rate fell from 10% to less than 5%. Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4.7%
And Obama had the audacity to give a ‚Äúeulogy ‚Äú about voting, mass prepaid ballots and trump.  Yeah Obama,  take the spotlight off yourself for SPYING ON TRUMPS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY WITH BIDEN AND COMMEY.   Justice will prevail.
Maybe be better to NOT vote to continue 2 decades long war in Afghanistan  - ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èdems are war mongers and Biden is moving to right on foreign policy. Stop the savage us savagery. Focusing on games is a distraction.
If you are so confident why did you float the idea of postponing the elections in November? Because #TrumpIsLosing #Biden #Biden2020
No risk of voter fraud? Sure. President Trump trailing Joe Biden by double digits? That's hilarious. Biden is a drooling,confused old fossil. He has no chance of beating the president.
30% drop under the reign of COVID-19. Biden-20 will be far worse when the sanders-commie loving socialist agenda get infected in the American system. Wait and see what happens to the economy when the govt grabs control of everything!

most of what you say happened under your prince obama who never gave a crap about blacks, and still does'nt. I bet he gave Biden the line"You aint black if you don't vote for me" Liberals have PTS. Wear a MAGAhat 24 hours it will cure you when you see leftys from our perspective.
Re-Tweeted  Trump Can‚Äôt Stop the Election, But He Can Threaten Democracy
That's not reality, it's a talking point. In reality, it's not about Trump. It's about the pervasive corruption in our establishment. Biden is the embodiment of everything wrong in our political system.
Are these the same polls that say Biden winning big? Yet polls are biased and wrong? Guess I should only trust polls you post?
Nina Turner clearly doesn‚Äôt want Biden elected. At this point she supports delaying the election because she basically supports trump.
Biden said his administration would be reflective of what America looks like  I think that look has to start at VP.

So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
It democRATS got a candidate like Joe Biden, it is because they don't need a competitive contender to win the elections.  We must be prepared for a massive fraud. We must be prepared to defend our Country from the dirty mob.

Cause... the lesser of two evils ... he was a fresh faced young guy In 2008 and Hillary is the Old System like the Bushes in 2016.  Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden is the answer?!? Disgusted with Dems.. own fault if they lose ...
We know Joe Biden isn't tweeting.
BULLSEYE!!! For when Biden is exposed ....he has them all on record now!
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he‚Äôs elected. It‚Äôs a huge selling point.

U act like Biden hasn‚Äôt said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump‚Äôs fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...

Ngl, little annoyed at this Biden ad
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
Would you be saying this if the owner was a Biden supporter?  NO
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.
Biden never ran an ad calling implying Obama was a ‚Äúscary black man‚Äù or covertly pushed ‚Äúbirther‚Äù conspiracies. Yet ur a ‚ÄúClinton Democrat‚Äù. And u don‚Äôt have to keep reminding me where I live lmao.

Trump worked through gridlock. Biden has late stage dementia.
Is Biden‚Äôs climate plan good?
Because in the real fvcking world, trump destroyed everything I worked for 38 years of my life. If you think an Obama-Biden style presidency is the same as a trump one, you‚Äôre either privileged or you live in a fantasy world.
You‚Äôre deflecting. I guess all the progressives in congress who endorsed Biden are wrong.
Biden should too.

Don't blame yourself Steve. How could you have possibly known how right Biden was back in April because up to that point Trump had been so respectful of the Constitution and especially the integrity of elections. Try not to be too hard on yourself.
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020
My person dislike has to do with her trying to smear Biden. None of the other women on the list tried to do that.
I guess we‚Äôll  finally hear whatever crap Giuliani has been able to extort out of foreign governments about Obama or Biden or both. Unlikely any of it will be vetted or confirmable. Democrats and independents beware it‚Äôs aimed at you.
No Biden all the way
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden‚Äôs pick. It‚Äôs time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
And we thought the last election was the most important. The ante went up folks.  Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins

i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.

During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump‚Äôs plan?
You realize you‚Äôre behind double digits in the polls? And Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt done or said a thing.
Biden wins Penn,Wis,in addition to Michigan &amp; he is over 270!!!!Besides AZ,FL,NC,GA,TX,etc,etc,etc...

His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it‚Äôs way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!

As a Dem, you can‚Äôt be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
I didn‚Äôt then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Ya know what America needs to unify it? A dementia ridden white guy and a cop

He just hates Biden; that‚Äôs all.
I agree? But that‚Äôs not the topic here. It‚Äôs voting for Biden.  I‚Äôm not going back and forth on this.
That‚Äôs not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn‚Äôt VP.  That‚Äôs what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can‚Äôt even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I‚Äôve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We‚Äôve got nothing to discuss.
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
I'm sure of it. Now if Kamala Harris is AG for Biden, she will kick ass. AG's have more power that VP's.
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!

Are you doing your famous Joe Biden impression?   It's really good, and I'm glad you realize you're going to lose.  Bigly!
I am praying that you will be by  President Biden's side through the journey.
Of course. My character is the one and only thing of which I have power over. It will not be compromised or governed by political affiliation, ideology, a person‚Äôs dogma, skin color, gender, sexuality or nationality.  Vote Biden. RIP John Lewis.
IMHO most DEMs are not voting to put Joe Biden in Office. DEMs vote DEM, (GOP vote GOP). If you like AOC you‚Äôre voting for Biden. If you like Warren, you‚Äôre voting for Biden etc etc.
You can‚Äôt honestly think that Joe Biden, based solely on the the way he has acted over the past 3-5 months, is completely there and capable of running a country.
Joe Biden is displaying all the symptoms of senility.
Let Biden decide if he wants to remodel . I don't think Trump's trashy brothel look will appeal to anyone else .
And now Trump is demolishing the GOP's vote by mail machinery with the same self fulfilling fatalism in the general election.      With enemies like this, why does Biden need friends?
While I agree that Trump is out there, at times we‚Äôve seen Joe Biden with the inability to form a simple coherent thought.
I think Biden is in a lose-lose when it comes to the debates. If he debates President Trump, I think his current mental state is pushed even more into the limelight. If he refuses, he looks weak, and people begin to wonder why he ran from a debate.

There‚Äôs zero chance the Democratic Party lets Biden step into the ring with President Trump and debate. They do not want the world to see that Biden is completely lost without a script. They will find every possible way out that they can.
The narrative that Biden has moved to "the left" on climate seems wrong to me.   Has he embraced bolden targets? Yes! Has he made important changes that'll benefit the economy &amp; climate? You bet.   What he's doing here is adopting policies more in line w/ science.
Yeah, I think that's right. Fracking is a good example - he's staying far AF away from it, no matter how hard the left pushes a ban.   No easy way to fit M4A into the Biden vision of how the world works.
Why did Biden move to the left on climate?

I find it frustrating that the message out of the democratic narrative is vote for Biden because we can't have 4 more years of Trump. BUT that is a pathetic reasoning to vote for a lackluster candidate who is only slightly better...and that is not saying much about Biden.

"Voting for Biden is like eating half a bowl of human waste" signed, a Democrat. That should tell you something.
Remember that time that you were all about the me to movement and believe all women and then called Joe Biden‚Äôs accuser a liar? That was awesome!
This is disgraceful.  He should have asked the host if they were paid by Clinton in 2016 and being paid by Biden in 2020.
The next time the senator takes something that Mr. Biden says in jest seriously, remind him of this. Mr Cornyn is a hypocrite
Possibly. But I think Trump and Biden both are in different stages of it. We dealt with dementia with my in laws and the signs are there. More so in Biden but Trump definitely as well.
If Biden has health issues before then, they'd have to postpone anyway.
After Joe Biden picks his VP,it will be a Trump Landslide win anyway,the Dem fraud will be a wash
After Joe Biden picks his VP,it will secure a Trump Landslide and win,and best of all another 4 years,l would want no other for the economic recovery!
Yes, that is why we MUST hold them accountable. Bush Jr Admin got away with everything. They left much fatter than they came in while Obama/Biden was putting the country back together and working hard for the people while securing a second term under racial assault.
The fact that you think Biden has any chance of winning is as laughable to people who vote third party. If Biden was a good candidate, why are people hesistant to even support him to begin with?
Of course he is. New York wants him. And whatever AG Biden appoints will go after him. And seize all of his assets.
Without evidence. That makes Biden prescient.  #RidenWithBiden2020
Exactly the concern. There were reports yesterday that some Biden advisors are running a ‚Äúshadow campaign‚Äù against Kamala Harris for VP, questioning her loyalty and motive.
No way he‚Äôs going to lose to Biden and most Americans are sick of it we just have jobs and are to busy living normal lives. We will vote them all out and mail in voting for everyone is BS. Shit I can‚Äôt even get packages from USPS sent correctly and in a timely matter to my house!
I would crawl over broken glass to vote for Biden...#WeWillVote
Nah, if Biden becomes president then it will be üòÇ
HELL NO.  The sooner we get rid of  the faster Mr. Biden can get on with the job of fixing what Trump broke.
Not even responding to how a pandemic has changed this country. That was China. We had no reserves of PPE or vents and still got them. A vaccines been fast tracked( where‚Äôs the one for Swine flu??) and it‚Äôll be better soon. Thank the Lord Biden wasn‚Äôt in charge.
Good point, you have to live on another planet not too see Biden didn't do anything
Coming to America if Biden wins.
More credible than Biden
I‚Äôm starting to think Jill Biden is part of the Silent Majority.  She probably values her Investment Accounts.
Obviously, because Biden is about as competent as a ham sandwich!! LMAO but AMERICANS will vote again for Donald Trump in a landslide because he is the best president ever and we don't want to live in a Socialist shithole!
He has pressers practically EVERY freaking DAY! And round table meetings,  and visits to different places where he stands and takes open questions from media without a teleprompter or script. Biden never does. He reads his speech and then leaves if he goes out in person at all!
Here is #biden doing the opposite.
Trump could be destroying Biden but he keeps kicking himself
If someone chose a third party candidate over Biden, that means that they don‚Äôt like Biden as a candidate for president.
It wouldn't help him anyway. As long as enough states hold elections and those states comprise 270 electoral votes, Biden is sworn in. If not, then the Speaker of the House is sworn in.  There is no path for Trump remaining president no matter how much he tweets.
Delaying election doesn't help him. On January 20, the Speaker of the House would be sworn in as the new president. If only red states delayed their elections, and as long as the remaining states formed 270 electoral for Biden, Biden would be sworn in.
This is how I envision this year's presidential debate, you have Trump on one side saying "person woman man camera TV TV camera man woman person..."  &amp; on the other side you have Biden doing a push up challenge. W/ the moderator saying all I said was hello #2020StrikesAgain
Quote of the day: " when negotiating with the enemy what do you want? Trump or Biden which will fall asleep at the meeting".             'Newt Gingrich'
Hey  you are supporting a man that is talking about violating the voting rights of every American because he thinks that a legal form of voting will cause him to lose. You are playing yourself. And I'm a vet that supports Biden too!
I don‚Äôt want Biden as my president ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I'm just going to say it now. If Biden wins in November I am going to be insufferable. I have so many receipts to collect.
Really not that hard. It‚Äôs Economics.  Many felt he was better for it than Hillary, who was also a flawed candidate.  Can make the same case for why the love for Biden? Do not see the same kind of support that other Dems were getting like Bernie.  All i hear is bridge and not DT.
And have drank all the BIDEN BS koolaid!  GET OUT OF THE BS TRANCE and WAKE THE HELL UP!!!
Ha Ha, Boner boy Biden... What a MoronüòÄ Pathetic human being..... Loser asswipeüòÄüé†
We have a fan club hoping Mr Biden picks you as his VP.  He would show his 47 years in gov didn't go to waste.  You were able to muster what, 2% support in your own run for President. Magnificent üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Oh, please be Biden's pick for VP.  I can only imagine the political ads to remind people of your Sunday morning appearances defending the indefensible.  BENGHAZI
Kamala, I love what you stand for, BUT you don‚Äôt have charisma, your voice doesn‚Äôt resonate with people. It‚Äôs very nasally. If you accept VP position, it will get Trump reelected. Biden sucks!!! He should‚Äôve chosen someone like Cory Booker as VP.
The born again fiscal conservative/hypocrisy boom will birth in January '21 if Biden wins the election.
Wouldn't that be giving in to being bullied?  Biden needs to pick who he feels will be the best VP to work with to accomplish what he can for the US...nothing more.  I believe those insisting on Kamala are making sure she doesn't get VP..
Do they even hide the fact that they are secretly choosing the president. Biden can't lead for 4 years.
A hundred million people are going to watch all or a little of the three future presidential debates. A hundred million people are going to watch Joe Biden struggle with cognitive decline. Will that change the polls? Extremely curious.

Once again, Biden displays his racist self since that ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù woman is a BLACK IMMIGRANT that graduated from medical school. Her facts re HCQ are correct, backed up by 62 studies. Just another racist and DEADLY smear campaign from the left.
Sorry if this is offensive, It's the only truthful response I can imagine for Biden's continuing ignorance:
Please research how many blacks Trump has pardoned and released with his prison law that overrode Biden‚Äôs that put millions of blacks in jail.
Want higher gas and utility bills?  Ok vote for BIden!
Agree. She was actually my second choice for prez, but I will support Biden no matter who he chooses. A golden Retriever would be better than Pence.
Yikes please don‚Äôt vote for Biden
Let me tell you in my county in FL people have been telling me same thing I voted trump in 2016 and now I dislike some of what he does but I will NOT vote for Biden or democrat. People overwhelming are confident in Trump some won‚Äôt say it right away but it‚Äôs clear he will win!
People who are not sure whether to vote for  let me give you some insight, watching my county, I have listened to a lot of people and all voted for trump in 2016 and all will be voting for him again why because Biden is hell to everyone! The dems included!
Last I checked, Biden is NOT President.
Anyone you know not going to vote #ProLife U.S. Catholics Dismayed that All Biden‚Äôs VP Choices Are Pro-Abortion
Why do people refer to Joe Biden as Vice President?  He lost that job title 4 years ago.
When does Biden announce his VP candidate?
Florida and Texas are also going to go for Biden. We need a HUGE margin to keep him from claiming the results were rigged
does Biden have a plan or are they strictly just trying to get you out of office at all cost?
That Obama had to be the one to marshal through ARRA, rather than a lame duck W, cost him tremendous political capital. The deadline is blown, so at this point Pelosi should extract a maximum price to help preserve room for Biden to maneuver next year.
I think Pelosi may at last understand that allowing the GOP to take the most politically difficult topic off the table on good faith the rest will be dealt with is foolhardy. And that regardless of who signs it, this is effectively the Biden admin‚Äôs first bill.
Did she tell you Biden wants you to be his VP??
Let's get a Biden representative on as well.
Tell them Bernie . You were the only Democrat that made sense . I know they have cheated you . I don‚Äôt like that at all it has your voters pissed off im a trump guy but a healthy govt I beleive that we need both sides to vote on you have a better chance then Biden

Who the heck is going to vote for some OLD TIMER BIDEN. Try a retire home Biden.
When Donald Trump just stole $175 million from donors to put in his pockets you worrying about Joe Biden
We not talk about the Green deal but I do know Joe Biden is not going to raise our taxes
Great to see Pres.Obama ramp up his involvement in the election process. It's good to see men who like Biden act Presidential for a change. And bring class and intelligence to the proceedings. I'm hoping our next President will help us earn back respect we have lost worldwide.
I'm riding with Biden!!!
Yes. The DNC wanted Biden. When Bernie was leading and CNN had the "unplanned outtake" of Liz confronting Bernie about who lied, it effectively ended both of their campaigns. Then suddenly, surging stars Pete and Amy dropped out. And now we have the least fit candidate.
Biden stood up to a gang member with a bike chain around his arm. Mitt almost murdered his dog in the most beta way possible.
Somewhere in his basement, Joe Biden secretly wishes he could be questioned like AG Barr....not given a chance to answer, that way he decreases his number of gaffes LOL
Maybe FOX just got smart and knows that you have ZERO chance of being re-elected, so now they realize that it is in their best interests to go with a winner...someone who can pull this country out of this quagmire...Joe Biden.

I bet Biden can't do it.
And Biden can't remember where he's at. Can we stop pretending Biden is still Biden? He's mentally challenged. I had an uncle who was downs syndrome. Everyone loved him. He was great. But you wouldn't hire someone with severe mental deficiencies to run the country.
Opinion | Now we know why Trump sought foreign help to beat Biden
I figure he's a one-termer, if he even waits the full 4.  But this country needs to heal, rebuild trust from other counties, and undo pretty much everything Trump has destroyed.  Dump Trump, then deal with Biden.
i questioned Conway's motives in another post and was told to hush.  I know they want something, conservatives are never nice.. Biden needs to win big.. Obama / Regan big. Trump cant win or we will all be in cages with the kids.   Give Biden a chance, just to get Trump out.  /1
And I understand your frustration.  IMHO Biden is trying not to make the election a holy war, and not to give Trump any ammunition to rally the idiots that voted for him last time.  The real key is to get a dem president and as many progressives as possible into congress / senate
Politico reports Kamala Harris is Biden's running mate, quotes Biden's announcement. . . which hasn't happened

Newsflash:  Everything happening right now is happening with the GOP in charge. This is your mess, not Biden's.
Before you vote in November you MUST listen to this video - Biden and Obama want Muzlums to take over our America and he could not make it any more clear - Please throw this Traitor behind bars NOW!!!!
Are you kidding? MAGAts only know Biden as the guy who let a Black Muslim socialist in the White House outlaw Christmas.
Biden wasn't my first choice, but I wasn't going to vote for Bernie. Why? Just like you, he wanted it all his way. You don't want to compromise, you want to hijack everything for your own purposes or you'll act like a brat. Nah. Be a spoiled brat elsewhere.
Biden's a centrist. Bernie is to the left of him.
Also, good to know you're supporting Trump for re-election &amp; in favor of the destruction of the Republic under Trump. Bold move of you, but I'm sure it'll work out. ü§îIf you can't vote for Biden in Nov because of his VP pick, you're a Trump supporter. Pure and simple.
Lets not pretend Bernie would of have done anything to win over Biden voters if the shoe was on the other foot, his whole campaign was "I don't need you, and you will bend the knee."
That's such an idiotic thing to say. I'm hoping they're only there as long as it takes to get President Biden sworn into office.
There's a lot of pissed off people in my area. A lot of houses with a trump signs are surrounded by houses with Biden signs. Its like a rebuke of trump and anyone supporting him.
It wasn‚Äôt an accident, she had Botox for a reason. And it was even quoting Biden .
BLACK WOMAN that couldn‚Äôt possibly win on her own!! Then democrats will remove Biden for mental problems IF they can cheat enough for him to win and install her!! Count on it!!
BUT. BUT.   TODAY the house in between 2 of the Trump houses had 3 Biden 2020 signs in their yard!!!! Someone is fighting back against their obnoxious neighbours!!! ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ There is a tiny bit of hope!

I have little enthusiasm for a Biden presidency, but I will of course vote for him. That said, in the event of a second civil war, which is becoming increasingly likely, I'm firmly on the side of the anti-fascists.
Joe Biden announced he will name his Vice Presidential pick next week. My bets are on Kamala Harris.
The Dems will assuredly come after BLM &amp; other organized movements when they happen under the Biden administration. And, this time, the media won't be siding with BLM on the populist wave - they'll be turning liberals against it (like they did under Obama). Blue-Red-Blue, repeat.
If you had to choose between doing 50 fix and flips with Trump or partner with Biden in a 16 unit multifamily deal which one would YOU do?  Would you let politics decide for you? Would you choose the best business person?  My guest Danny Randazzo  on the #MoneyIsShow chose üëá
Michelle Obama already has the hearts of most of America. I‚Äôm also assuming she and her family are set financially as well. She just started a podcast after a successful book tour. There is a reason she‚Äôs staying relevant on purpose. If Biden doesn‚Äôt win, she runs in ‚Äò24.

‚ÄúMr Biden, what would you do to help people who can‚Äôt afford health insurance?‚Äù  Biden: I‚Äôm glad you asked. What I‚Äôd do is,...feathers, there was a pigeon and a stick of butter would carry the weight
Reagan coined the phrase I didn‚Äôt leave the Democratic Party it left me.  He cited communism as his reason for switching.  Robert Byrd the former grand wizard didn‚Äôt leave Dem Party, and Biden referred to him multiple times as boss and leader.  Man can you afford this? $100!
I can‚Äôt wait for Biden to be in office so I can argue with Democrats to persuade them that we need UBI, Medicare for All, and Green New Deal. It‚Äôs really boring just getting along with them as we all fight to remove this one insane guy from office.
well show me a demon and I will show u the next Texas GOp senator.
There‚Äôs a difference between Obama and Sleepy Joe,  Joe has no enthusiastic support.  In the 08/12 wins Obama had a big turnout.    Heck if you did a vote in the Democrat Party,  Socialist Bernie would receive more votes than Biden.
Gillum especially was a popular candidate at the time with a lot of enthusiasm behind him. Biden doesn't have that.
Yes and we will be voting against all of you. Biden and Obama has their time to fix so called systemic and institutional racism why didn‚Äôt they do it if it was an issue. Why didn‚Äôt the 1st black US President solve the issue huh?? Why did he say jobs could never come back to USA?
It was a joke, #Biden even said so. Boy, you #trumptards are desperate. #TrumpDeathClock
Everyone who pays attention &amp; actually follows world events already knows the US &amp; China are locked in Cold War 2.0. Regardless of your political views, its unfortunately inevitable. With Trump now &amp; likely Biden in near future, this conflict will continue

Such a weird take to just completely sit out an election, based on the age of the candidate for one of the offices at stake in the election. There are other races too and I‚Äôm sure not everyone is ‚Äútoo old‚Äù. Also weird that Bernie is not ‚Äútoo old‚Äù while Biden is.

You are seriously deluded if you think Joe Biden gives any thought to what you say. Going to fake your way to the best seller list again by the RNC buy a lot of copies?
If Trump wins this election, 2020 will truly have been a repeat of 2016.  "Trump might not except the election results." This was said back in 2016.  "Biden could win in a landslide." The same was said about Hillary.  "The polls have Trump losing." Just like back in 2016.
Biden could literally go on vacation for the rest of the election and win, you guys are the best campaign he has. Keep it up.
Don‚Äôt know about you, but I believe big pharma. How about your add that out next president, Biden, wants to defund police. You are incapable of telling the truth.
But her reasoning made no sense. She said people in her district really didn't like Biden and she didn't want to argue with them by endorsing, yet Biden won her district in the primary by huge numbers.
Biden talks about Rasism, but the fact is, he is the most racist person I have ever seen on media in all my 51 years! Stop being sheep and open your eyes. I don't care who is POTUS, as long as they can Effectively be one. Man, Woman, Black or White and keep promises they ran on.
I have seen only one Biden bumper sticker on the back of an old white mans car here in Jacksonville, FL
Soon they will be coming after your guns. Remember Beto's comments, remember Biden saying in his administration he would put Beto in charge of gun reform.
I would never trust the leftist Yahoo Finance.  Come mid October, I'm going 100% in cash.  In the event Biden wins, I feel the market will drop 30% within days. Just my opinion

You're right. There is no way Biden will pick Bass when there are so many other, equally qualified people.
I love a good Rand Paul insult
Extremes make extremes. We have a far right leader which caused far left groups to emerge. If this were really the case like you say then Democrats would‚Äôve never (overwhelmingly) elected a guy like Biden.
He WILL win and liberals will riot and burn cities and start a war!! Or Biden will win and he says the first thing he will do is ban what liberals ignorantly call assault weapons and start another civil war!! No matter what we are having another war soon. Race war could be soon

Everyone is saying what if Trump wont give up the presidency... well.. if there is a dispute, and Biden is not elected by a margin then it gets to be fun, and Trump will like it even less
Sounds like it's time for Biden, the the treasonous terrorists and the supporting left politicians to all be arrested and prosecuted for their crimes. The coup cabal has some serious explaining to do. People will not vote for Biden at Gunpoint.
They only gonna give a guy credit if he was hired by Ronald Reagan 37 years ago and is old as Joe Biden.
You can never be too prepared, I would encourage all Americans rightly so without felonies etc. who are mentally able to handle a fire arm legally the right way. We have to be ready because if trump wins, this will be 100 times worse, and if Biden wins oh well let‚Äôs not go there
He will (pick) a black woman who would have no possible chance of winning on her own!! Then IF Biden wins, liberals will have him declared unfit for office and she takes over. That‚Äôs the plan

The fact that you give our president so much light and energy into your day shows how much you‚Äôre concerned Biden won‚Äôt be elected. You didn‚Äôt see me criticizing Obama for eight years I just did my research and waited each election year to vote maybe we all should just calm down.
Oh, MSM will spin that. Last thing they want is Biden on stage, alone, with Donald Trump. They will protect him with everything.  Nice of you to offer ü§†üòäüòå
It‚Äôs bullshit...Twitter won‚Äôt take it down because they feel it‚Äôs freedom of speech not when I say Biden was our first gay presidents V.P. Expect this to be deleted  btw you idiots who listen to this crap 4 years ago trump was 10 points behind killary now he‚Äôs 9üòä
Trump knows where he is, knows what office he‚Äôs running for and what he said 10 minutes ago. That‚Äôs all of a lot better than Biden.
That just talking to talk.  I am taking real life bias and applying it to the Presidency. I have been pretty good at too. Hillary got sport and strategic and got sent into retirement.  Biden will be sent to his final place as well if he picks a black or bi-racial lady. üíôüá∫üá∏
32 years ago but the exact same message. Democrats didn't think that message was racist until he became President.  Go back 32 years &amp; watch literally ANY of Biden's interviews. He was a different man when the wind was blowing in a different direction.
Same here.  I would say 10% of the people I know who voted for Trump are voting for Biden.  100% of the 3rd party voters are voting Biden.  Not a single person I know who voted for Hillary is voting for Trump.
Jill Biden is absolutely beautiful both inside and out.  I can‚Äôt wait to have a true Lady back in the WH.
Joe Biden is a good man.  Jill Biden is a class-act.  I can‚Äôt wait to have a man of honor back in the WH and a First Lady to be proud of.
Again...not even advocating for Republicans vs Democrats....just that the guy will be a figurehead not a decision maker if it's Biden.  Maybe they run the country centrist (hopefully)....maybe they won't....but impossible to say for sure.
I think Biden 8-16 years ago....absolutely.  I just don't trust a man so clearly in mental decline will be core policy maker for his presidency.  Not saying it's necessarily far left but I just don't believe it will be him.
President Biden, tear that wall down!
I think you have that one backwards. Trump has offered to debate and the Biden campaign responded that ‚Äúthey weren‚Äôt going to play Trump‚Äôs games‚Äù. My grandfather suffered from dementia so I‚Äôve seen it first hand. There‚Äôs no doubt that Joe is in early stages of it.
Trump has done more for Women Business Owners in 3.5yrs than Biden in 44yrs in Gov.

Biden will be a no-show.
LOL if you think Joe Biden is really running the show when he becomes president?
LOL. Biden is doomed.
Article for those who like to read....Joe Biden to pay respects to John Lewis on Monday in Washington. The simple fact of giving a damn is not difficult.
I only come here to tell you idiots what you have done wrong/. Write in Kasich, or don't vote. Trump/Biden, sorry, stupidity runs rampant. Hoping I win a lottery so I can get the Hell out of a US that would vote for either of them!
if Biden wins they won‚Äôt only legalize it, they‚Äôll pay for you to have it while you stay home from work!
Hillary was crushing Trump in the polls too. It‚Äôll be interesting to see if they debate because I feel like that‚Äôs where Trump made his way last time. Biden is mentally slipping, I know people deny it but it‚Äôs obvious, so his running mate will be key.
Fuck Joe Biden
Dogs for Biden.
She was an amazing woman. ‚ô•Ô∏è
It doesn't erase the fact the openly admitt to be marxists, secondly blm funnels their donations they receive through act blue which is a super pac for the DNC, no wonder basement do nothing, calling black people criminals Joe Biden is getting rich.
Called it weeks ago. Biden will not be permitted to debate. There will be no debate! I can't imagine this going over very well with majority of voters.
When patriots put rioters down because they've had enough of this BS, will Joe Biden think they are "fine people" too?
I‚Äôm wondering why none of the post above ever mentioned about Joe Biden‚Äòs MENTAL  CAPACITY.  Are you Guys are ashamed with your 77 years old Senile candidate! Lol.
No, they're with him to the end. They know they have no other choice. Holding onto power is all they care about, so they'll be with him till January 20th if Biden wins.
Why do you keep lying? Joe Biden does NOT want to defund the police.  You are so dishonest.  Also why‚Äôll first your grandchildren get to choose distance learning and everyone else MUST go to back to school?
I expected the screaming of ‚Äúthe deficit, the spending‚Äù from GOP with a Biden win .. so it‚Äôs earlier than I thought.. but Ricky is really more concerned with getting is name recognition up country wide for Presidential run 2024.. he has been nonexistent in Covid for us here n FL
Are you all enjoying Biden's New America yet?
Stop spreading fake news.  You should talk about your 77 years old candidate Senile Joe Biden. Joe is suffering from 2nd stage of severe Dementia.
The sandbars of Florida are certainly pro Trump. There's a ton of Trump, Rebel, pirate, and Don't Tread on me flags out on the water. I've never seen a Biden flag, nor did I ever see a Clinton or Obama flag. Trump has the boater vote in Florida.
Trump takes questions daily at the White House from reporters from all different networks. Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt leave his house.
Dude, this is America under the Trump administration.  Biden is not president... yet.
Joe Biden is a Corporate Avatar...  I Garantee he didnt contribute one paragraph about this "Plan" for women in the economy.
She is clearly blind to  authoritarian Nazi-like leadership.  The woman is heard telling shoppers, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a Nazi,‚Äù claiming she wore the symbol of hate as a political statement.  ‚ÄúIf you vote for [Joe] Biden, you‚Äôre going to be in Nazi Germany."
John Lewis to be honored by Biden, lawmakers and the public as he lies in state - The Washington Post
Kiss my Biden.
Watch Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, break down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
Well, when Biden is sworn in, He can just use the military to get him out of there. They're pretty good at getting war criminals out of bunkers.
Yea let‚Äôs see Biden struggle through a debate first
I really tagged Joe Biden and this fool tagged Ye üòÇüíÄ
Wow, GDP avg 2%, under Obama. Joe Biden did get 1.5 Billion of CCP bank $, Hunter kept it. Obama caught spying on Trump. Obama used IRS against people Did nothing when Syrians were gassed. Gave Solindra 600mil that never produced 1 job.
1. Kind of a big deal.  2. Looks like China will be colluding  with Biden... will require spying and witch-hunt Hoax investigations
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Dan did you see Mark Levin's show last night? You might want to look into it. Check out Biden's plan for the suburbs. Obama tried it but President Trump has pushed back much. biden wants to destroy the suburbs and our country.
I prefer Susan Rice, Kamala Harris is not my choice at all  There's reportedly a 'contingent' of Democrats lobbying against Kamala Harris as Biden's running ...  via
Ruth, Talking to You is a waste of time as your just not Bright enough to Speak! Then again Crazy Joe Biden doesn't Speak either until the Squad tells him what to Say!!
The GOP strategy in avoiding a special session to deal with the state budgetary apocalypse is:  1) Ignore 2) Get reelected??? 3) Vigorously fight against federal bailout appropriations while muttering deficit 4) Blame Joe Biden 5) Get reelected???
I'm a former Republican I'm voting for Biden to save America I wish he was a little more progressive is at least want 4 things  1 Medicare for all. Legalization of marijuana trump to be held accountable and more affordable housing for disabled and combating covid possibly Ubi for
Because moderates and centrist Rs &amp; Ds chose establishment Biden by using Red Scare tactics against Warren &amp; Sanders. He's the candidate you &amp; others chose, don't go talking smack now. Btw, when Obama asked someone to help lead us out of the recession, he asked Warren not Biden.
Trust and believe that Biden is more lucid than Trump. You are one of those poor Trump supporters who cannot fact check and relies on Trump lucidious commercials to sway your judgement - talk about fake news.
You have become a great lier like your father.  Biden never said he would defund the police.  Always twisting things.
Other than people like you and General who were able to take full advantage of our once beautiful Capital, I‚Äôm sure Joe Biden knows what has happened better than anyone.  I wouldn‚Äôt worry. We just need to get Mr. Biden back in office.
Over 90 field organizers for the FL Dem Party write that the Party + Biden Campaign is "suppressing the Hispanic vote in Central Florida".
That‚Äôs what your going to get with Hiding Biden!!üòÇüòÇ
- No one is coming to Joe Biden for anything - The man can't even get out of his basement - Especially Seniors that have dealt with this Criminal for most of our lives!!!!
Did George H.W. Bush have to express regret for calling Ronald Reagan's economic plan vodoo economics? If he didn't, someone might want to mention that to Chris Dodd.
That‚Äôs not how it worksüòÇüòÇ Trump can‚Äôt be like yeet we not counting these Mail votes for Biden üòÇ
New ads for Biden campaign that target senior citizens, which polling says may be in play.
No we all know the rose Twitter doesn‚Äôt believe her either. She‚Äôs just a convenient excuse not to support Biden.
Naw, just another embarrassment. Same stuff Biden and Hillary was talking about I reckon in the 90's.
You want to beat off Joe Biden?
Biden supporters are not interested in jobs.
Trump is NOT running against Biden ~ he is running against VOTER FRAUD !
Trump et al assumes that if there is a black candidate on the ballot blacks will automatically vote for him, which in their reptilian brains means less votes for Biden. It seems to never occur to them that blacks, women, etc, aren't an automatic voting block...
We know one thing- Obama is not guilty of killing off 140,000 Americans by pretending that a pandemic wasn‚Äôt happening. Poetic justice will be served in November and again during Biden‚Äôs inauguration.
Done!
You will wake up in January when Biden takes the Oval Office. The USA is the biggest laughing stock of the Universe right now because of the orangutan ü¶ß in office. My greatest hope is that we still have American citizens left (have not been killed off by the CoronaTrump virus)
You will wake up in January when Biden takes the Oval Office. Until then, you should seek therapy.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I wish all my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Good morning! Coming up after the break I've got the latest CNN poll numbers for Biden/Trump. We look at a few key states.   Hope you had a good weekend!
Neal do you watch Mark Levin? If so you need to check out the show from last night. It is about how biden would destroy the suburbs.  Very scary.
Not Peaceful
Cry me a fucking river they were butning the Presidents church down they were told to move a block down and refused they got off easy if you ask me.
Biden wants to scrape past weed convictions üëÄüëÄ we will have to wait and see... cause that‚Äôll be amazing
Thank you for your support of Joe Biden, made me love you even more.
Biden campaign declines 'Fox News Sunday' interview, 1 week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown  #FoxNews
I can not wait to see this , person who called #biden a #racist
Yes, let us hope the truth comes out but don‚Äôt see how it can. How can you believe her and not Biden‚Äôs accuser?  She had strong evidence. I hate all of this, no matter who it is.
Even *IF* Joe Biden comes on and gets interviewed by Chris Wallace, Chris Wallace is going to throw softball questions, just like he does every Democrat who he interiews.
if your intention is to mock Biden by trying to lure him into a person woman man camera tv test, no wonder he‚Äôs declined. be better.
BIDEN THE CHICKEN , WHIMP REFUSE TO SIT DOWN WITH MR. WALLACE LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP.  WHAT HE SCARED OF??
Trump is milking the Portland debacle. The anarchists are giving Trump the election. Gun control people are buying guns. Lasers to permanently blind police. And Biden is still against law and order.  Vote Biden - higher taxes, more "peaceful" protests, China.
#Biden will say if you don‚Äôt for him, you‚Äôre not brown.
I will do that and I'll weigh that against what Joe Biden has done as Senator and Vice President the last 44 yrs and then make my choice.  Have a good night.
Will give equal time to Biden‚Äôs record on race ?
Except, he will win again due to the American public voting for law &amp; order and the return to prosperity. Biden and his party can‚Äôt do either. üëä
America‚Äôs options are really Trump &amp; Biden 2 creeps
Congratulations Obi! I‚Äôm a Republican for Biden 2020!
Biden is not calling for DEFUNDING. You're flailing at air, Donald.
Biden and Trump are the same. Both can fuck off. Want change? Make politicians fear you.
Chris Wallace is an honorable journalist and I regret that Biden won't agree to be interviewed.
We always knew he had  only Republicans in his best interest.  He pretty much confirmed it!  We need a president of both parties!  Biden 2020üåäüåäüåä
So, anything that you find on Trump, you are gonna  me Randall?  No sure why but, ok. I see how you conveintly scroll by &amp; make excuses for Biden. You and your pal are incapable and inmature for balance. Atleast, Claybo and Chauncey makes an effort.  They acknowledge stupidity.
What about Joe Biden‚Äôs mental health?
They have been much more active on Twitter of late, basically projecting DT's actions and their sycophancy onto Biden and us normal people. Their desperation is palpable...
Right because their democrats, they get away with murder. Quite literally murder...let‚Äôs face the crap Obama is hiding soooo much stuff I can‚Äôt. But let‚Äôs exacerbate anything we hear about Trump because it‚Äôs Trump. We‚Äôre screwed if Biden wins. Get ready for increased taxes people
I knew it - I knew they took out #Lewis just for this occasion - First they needed to block the interview with Biden and Chris Wallace and 2nd they are trying to stop the hearings -  Do not let them cancel anything!!!!!!!! Please "Stand Your Ground"!!!!!
Joe Biden is sneaking in the kitchen again, stealing kitty nuggets from the litter box.
Yeah, Biden is definitely the best option.
Biden‚Äôs down in the basement bathroom ‚Äòfinger painting‚Äô on the walls. ‚ÄúOh Joe, not again!‚Äù
Then you were not paying attention to Joe Biden.  Empty headed trumpter.
He‚Äôs not racist. Ask Tiger. Or Jerome Adams. Or Tim Scott. Or any other Black Americans working with Trump. It‚Äôs a false narrative. The Democrats are the party of racism, always have been. The KKK, Jim Crowe, &amp; worst of all Lyndon Johnson. Look up Biden speaking on his crime bill
A fallable and inept Biden presidency could either lead to stronger fascism or stronger leftism. Are we really ready for that tug-of-war? I'd say the leftists (socialists+) have a long way to go in the way of solidarity. We better get it together friends. Love each other.
I wish all 10K of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Why isn't Joe Biden condemning this? Why isn't any of his 4 VP candidates condemning this? Does the American people want this new America? Sickening.
Joe Biden represents the Maoist Communist insurrection. He wants to make America like Venezuela
Biden Roaches
I'm looking for a #Biden/Harris ticket. Either way, I will support whomever he chooses, 100%!!
All those who I know voted 3rd party in 2016 are voting for Biden in 2020.  That‚Äôs bigly.
Sounds like a peaceful protest. Wonder what big bad Joe Biden has to say about these threats
Very basic economic indicators, but what took Obama &amp; Biden 8 years, has taken Trump &amp; Pence 3 years.  His ability to make America great can not be argued with. #keepamericagreat #homeofthefree #american #americanpatriot #economics #politics #trump2020
Ronna even uncle mitt and very influential republicans and republicans 23%are voting Biden. Real republicans

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The thing people forget is that voting isn't the end of it, you also have to put pressure on the people in power once they're in power. If the pressure is there, I have no doubt an Independent AG will investigate all of Trump's crimes. That's on us, not Biden.
What‚Äôs stopping you from arresting Obama/Biden/Hillary??
Stutters dont make you forget basic history, Obama's name, where you are, &amp; what you're talking about. Biden looks very lost every time he speaks. Youtube or Google it.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Not sure who I will vote for but it will not be Trump or Biden
This is our country ran by Democrats and it will only get worse If Biden gets the presidency and Dems win the majority.  We must vote to save our country.  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica  #KAG2020TRUMPVICTORY
True but I think that issue is helping lock the young vote into Biden whereas they were disengaged or Bernie or bust before.
Trump 99% Biden 1%  And That is a Stretch!!!  LOL!
The most likely result of actual, five-alarm crisis is the failure to inaugurate anyone at all at the stroke of noon on January 20th, which would result in President Pelosi. Which, given most Republican electeds would prefer Biden and legitimacy, is highly unlikely to transpire.
and by the way and I find you rather attractive I hope you don't feel that I am a sniffing Joe Biden I'm not it's a compliment to you
what I do if I don't wanna vote for Trump or Biden fr? cause ima feel bad if I don't vote period
Just saw an great new Joe Biden campaign ad. It was all positive covering all the most important issues in our minds his experience and involvement. It paints him as a diametrical opposite to Donald Trump. IMO the worst and most self focused POTUS we could have ever imagined.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.  Pass it on !
GREATER ENTHUSIASM FOR TRUMP THAN BIDEN REFLECTED IN VOTER REGISISTRATION.  That means new voters are registering Republican just to VOTE for Trump!!  #TrumpLandslideVictory2020  #Trump2020 #TrumpLawAndOrder2020
Lets not underestimate the fact that Joe Biden does indeed have dementia and can barely string together a single coherent sentence. The debates are for sure going to hamper turnout on the Blue side. Independents and young voters will be cringing hardcore the whole time.
Go back to sleep Biden!!
Joe Biden is a Corporate Avatar.     Does anyone really think he is capable of writing a tweet like this?
Joe Biden to tour military facility and ‚Äúwants to ride on a tank‚Äù per sources. MY COLUMN:
Biden is easily controlled.
That along with the New Health Care Plans soon to be announced - Joe Biden hasn't got a chance in "H E Double Hockey Sticks" of ever being our President! LOL!
No I'm registered w peace and freedom party I'm ridin w biden
This is hilarious - the FIRST hurricane of 2020 to make landfall on the country and it barely makes the news! I guess with the riots, the election, Biden, the Chinese virus, and various female celebrities being naked, a hurricane just doesn't seem important.
Joe Biden is a professional incorrect person, be it on crime, on dividing Iraq into three republics, on killing Bin Laden, or even on how to use an ear loop mask.
Joe Biden endorsing a Green New Deal means the brain-dead "I'm a Democrat," boomer liberals that flood the primaries will support that style of legislation in the future. Same goes for single-payer. Its all a game of voter influence. Moving the population moves the politics.
Good ad for Biden.

Why should Trump bother? I mean Biden said in 6 months when he takes office he‚Äôll have plan in place....granted we have to wait 6 months and god forbid our WORTHLESS US Government stop to lying to us and do what‚Äôs right!
Biden said he was considering a Republican VP.... The answer is no.
Every last option we have is trash   Biden trash Kanye trash Trump.....straight üí©
"I just can't vote for Biden so I won't vote," sounds like...  "I just couldn't vote for Hillary so I'll vote for a reality actor," which in 2016 sounded to me a lot like...  "I just couldn't take my family to DisneyWorld so I took them to #Chernobyl."   #COVID„Éº19 #marytrump

Best painters are usually mentally ill. This one will be cutting their eyes out so they can't see President Biden.
You trying to be kind doesn‚Äôt change the fact that you got a 90 on the IQ test and thought it was out of 100, who in their right mind would vote for Biden out of all people
Assume that Biden is behind by 20 percentage points. Work harder. VOTE

No. Never Biden. Never Trump.
And why do you think she'll become president?  Do you think there's something wrong with Biden that will preclude him from serving?
üòÇüòÇ voting for Biden cause you‚Äôve had your feelings hurt a few times lmaooo, Biden is the least qualified candidate in a while
Thank you for the words of warning and concern, Mr.Biden; soon to be Mr. President! üëçüëçüò∑üò∑
I believe  that even though Ye reveals he is persuading people so Biden loses, it doesn't reduce the persuasion. Maybe it makes the persuasion more effective.
Biden has so many Corporations $upporting him he doesn‚Äôt need any of my $900.00 a month retirement income.  We HAVE to take financial corruption out of politics.
U look like the worst used car salesman on Planet üåè earth .... Biden.
Do you mean Republicans in govt. or public  figures or regular Americans? My folks are Republicans now ( were liberal when younger) and became more conservative with age - but have no tolerance for Trump or people like him - voting for Biden instead.
Biden's accepting of the progressive platform isn't exactly designed for Biden to do anything about it - its a strategy to 1) get people to vote for him, and 2) to change the priorities of "Democrats," or active primary voters. Moving voters left is incredibly important.
Is everyone missing the obvious? Biden is running for president.  He's incoherent, forgetful, and a creepy sniffer.  It's embarrassing.
The Case Against Biden  JB: cognitive decline  DT: total dipshit  JB: crime would increase DT: turn on your TV  JB: creepy DT: rapey   JB: inconsistent on racial progress DT: very consistent racist  JB: Hunter Biden scandal DT: like 70 scandals &amp; counting  #COVID„Éº19 #marytrump
Yes at this time, for this election, any vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump
Eeeyup. My son is coming up on his 20, also USN like us.   Told me he didn't believe how many supported Bernie and now Biden.
I agree, your last sentence is right on. All the left is talking about Trump losing, they'll have to evict him -- it's them projecting their actions if Biden loses, which l still maintain he will. Polls are weighted heavily to the left. Same as 16
biden is winning so suck it
Just donated to the Biden campaign.
I think most republicans except ur base trumplicans will vote anybody but trump I'm voting first time for democrat Joe biden
Bernie voter I'm voting for Biden 1st time Dem voter I'll vote for a rock instead of Biden I like he's adopting more progressive stances not like Bernie but enough we get a progressive vp I'm all in #BidenForFL
Uh...JFK and FDR were Democrats. JFK was the first Catholic President, Joe Biden will be the second. And tRump is the WORST president since Reagan...something even W couldnt achieve.
The GOP should lose the Senate so that Biden will have all the congressional power needed to achieve his"Build Back Better" agenda. With all the work that will have to be done, he's going to really need it.
I‚Äôm not even thinking about Biden until there‚Äôs a debate
Seriously, you blame Trump for the Chinese Corona Virus and the fact that the scientists recommended to shut down the country for 6-8 weeks. Get a clue. It‚Äôs all China‚Äôs fault. And if Biden is elected, China will own America
Is your goal to beat Biden or is it to become president? Claim you‚Äôll beat Trump as well. You just come off as someone trying to take votes from Biden, rather than someone trying to beat Trump.
I am on board with whomever Biden picks. After the VP position is filled, there are MANY great women available to him for many important positions! I am EXCITED to see what jobs are assigned to whom!
‚Å¶ too week to stand up to China!  Voting for Joe Biden is voting for the end of freedom
My choice is #Biden/Harris2020. I will, however, support whomever he chooses, 100%!!
Which Scientists? Should we have listened to Biden and kept the borders open? Or Nancy and met her for tea in Chinatown? Please. The deaths are on China and her lies.
What will he do if Biden walks in or get this guy endorsement.......
I have a joke about Biden but... it's, you know...the thing!
Dude, why do you want to beat off Joe Biden?
You‚Äôre doing what to Biden?!
Same here, although l think obama was far more evil whereas biden is just a dummy and went with the flow. Besides Obama is illegit. I'll never be convinced he was from anywhere but Kenya and mentored by a Marxist
So you‚Äôre not trying to beat trump you‚Äôre trying to beat Biden üò©ü§îüëéüëéüëéüëé you won‚Äôt get my vote #TeamBiden
Where are the photos of Biden. I‚Äôd like to see them. Change my mind
‚ÄúI can beat Biden off...‚Äù - Kanye West
But that‚Äôs a feeling. Trump was good friends for decades with Epstein and has visit his island several times. And you think he had nothing to do with it. But Biden who has no pictures with him, is in on it.
Chris Smith R-NJ House foreign affairs committee wrote a bill to allow people to sue China for Causing The release of Covid 19. The other bill would establish a truth commission. Max Baucus Biden pushed him to be US Ambassador to China the fix is in vote Trump/Pence 2020
I‚Äôm on #TeamJoe! Add your name to say you‚Äôre on a Student for Biden today &gt;&gt;
Because Biden doesn‚Äôt try and start ww3 every five seconds, and illegals can‚Äôt because legal immigrants unless they are given the ability to wich you guys don‚Äôt like. And about felons... they just love trump
Personalities ,or POLICIES.  TRUMP VR BIDEN.  BIDEN fake or made up   POPOP personality ?  Biden policies far left progressive socialist.   PRESIDENT TRUMP POLICES FREEDOMS TO CHOOSE, AND CAPITLASIM .  TRUMP PERSONALITY NYC ROUGH AND TUFF BUT ANYBODY CAN CHANGE AS WE SEE.
I won't be voting for Biden in November.... Because I'll be voting for him in October thanks to early voting.
‚ÄúBass, 66, and Harris, 55, were both children of the civil rights movement and early supporters of Barack Obama‚Äôs 2008 campaign. Both were the highest-ranking women this summer to lead police reform efforts in the House and Senate.‚Äù
Translation - isolating seems to be working for Biden. Think I‚Äôll try it myself.
I am concerned about the cognitive function of his followers. Biden's moronic episodes only exist for defense against prosecution.  He has a seemingly compelling argument for a rubber room rather than a cell. He's running to avoid all Democrat prosecutions and sentences...
Why does Trump call Putin everyday? Does he know that Putin is not a Christian and does not believe in God and our Lord Savior Jesus Christ. Putin is evil and can not be trusted. Don't lecture us about Joe Biden. He is a good man.
I hear you. I feel the same but also feel/hope/believe that Biden will win and the repairs will begin. It must be...üëçüò¢üôÇüò∑
I think a lot of what people point to as mental decline are his speech problems, which he has had his whole life. But no, we have worse now, the difference is Biden is capable of having a staff that doesn‚Äôt cater to insanity
Im seeing people walking away from Dems all over, many Dems saying they won't vote for PedoJoe, and even lots of people saying they are voting for the first time ever and voting for Trump  Ive seen some saying they did vote Trump 2016 voting Biden, but not a lot
For those who speak Biden. We call it ENGLISH!
Let‚Äôs have the election first. My guess is that Biden is going to be the one who won‚Äôt accept the results of the election.
Sweetie if you want to be a Socialist then Vote for AOC as she's telling Crazy Joe Biden what to do!!
Might want to worry what‚Äôll happen if Joe Biden gets elected
That will be exactly what happens if Biden gets in Somehow we've got to put TERM LIMITS FOR ALL on the ballot
49% support ! #Democrats will blame outside interference after #biden loses
More important than MJ's number, Cornyn is running three points ahead of Trump and that should be enough. Even if Biden wins Texas I doubt it will be by more than that.
I thought he was talking about Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders for a minute there
I would think Biden is also going up up for treason during the Trump spying situation.  He was party to Obama leading  the treasonous acts!  Would they send Biden to Leavenworth to serve his sentence?
Hey twerp, I am a 70 yo Democrat. I could hardly be called part of a left wing mob. No one wants to defund the police. Joe Biden is an honorable man. Of course you know nothing about honor.
I'm not trying to help the President, but I think his game was to compare himself to Biden and somehow look better, but that hasn't turned out how he wanted imo
Biden agreed to take a #CognitiveTest!
We need you to win big! Please debate Biden a lot, so all America can watch his unfortunate mental &amp; emotional decline...as long as he doesn‚Äôt refuse or make up an excuse not to debate you. We will miss you here in Jacksonville, but appreciate you looking out for our safety!
Strange that the incumbent thinks this is a good thing to campaign on. Shouldn't Biden be using these exact videos against Trump?
100% Bullshit  ... the Biden signs in my very red neighborhood say so.  #TrumpIsLosing #Biden2020Landslide

If Susan Rice gets Biden's VP slot, Valerie Jarrett will actually be the one running the show.  Obama appoints Valerie Jarrett, Susan Rice and Ben Rhodes to posts
Yes, when we look at the many achievements of Joe Biden over the last 50 years it has to be exciting.  He finished at the top of his class and has multiple degrees.  He is outstanding at making friends with those that can help him.  Really, all he has done is backslap and con.
Not this again you all really think if he had something on Obama,Obama and Biden would be in jail right now I‚Äôll tell you what y‚Äôall keep waiting for it
The average American doesn‚Äôt want crime in the streets.... We want law and order.....You can‚Äôt spell triumph without Trump! Can‚Äôt wait until the Trump/Biden debates......
Biden Back to the defense of marriage act just so ya know.
Clinton had spent ~35% more $$ than Biden by this point. Similar fundraising figures.  (Tougher to compare incumbent cycle-over-cycle, as they raise/spend funds for years prior to re-election campaign.)
I hope prayers will help bring them to their senses. Walking away means you've already lost, and if  Biden wins nobody will be happy in the hell he plans for us all. People have to stand with Trump to save America.
Funny. I don't know any racists, and almost all my friends and family are Trump supporters. Never seen a Trump supporter online say anything pr do anything racist either.  Hmm I wonder where all the racists are hiding? Oh, yeah, they're probably on a Biden thread with other libs.
To be honest. I don‚Äôt understand the whole ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù must make a VP pick now. He‚Äôs being consistent in not announcing until August.  Also there‚Äôs been a lot of speculation in the past VP picks have dealt with the same I think a lot of negative media is coming from certain groups.
The Biden hats are going to be cool
I am quite certain that Biden will be happy to have a ceremony for Trump's hanging.
Funny cause I know several biden supporters that don't wear masks, as for myself I wear one but only because I don't need to worry if I'm entering a place if they require them or not, I've just excepted it, so I wear one everywhere but outside.
Like Joe Biden, half the time Biden doesn't know where he's at, but yes I've heard some of stuff, he's unorganized. People don't like trump because he sounds boring, personally I care less about how well u speak but your actions.
"Trump vs. Biden: Who‚Äôs winning the money race in your ZIP code?"
I think he said it was 2018.  Have no idea other than he‚Äôs convinced he will be perceived to have better cognitive skills than Biden who hasn‚Äôt had a cognitive test.
I've been seeing trump signs in yards but the houses all around those have biden signs. I think its the neighbors rebuking the trump signs.
-President Trump has drawn more donors across the conservative panhandle, SW FL &amp; Northeast FL.  -Mr. Biden was stronger in many parts of southeast Florida, a liberal, densely populated region.  ‚û°Ô∏èvia

You mean sorta-like Biden?...
Young Blacks haven‚Äôt learned Biden‚Äôs Ulegy at David Duke‚Äôs funeral (Grand Wizard of KKK) or racist statements he‚Äôs made forever! He &amp; son Hunter extorting millions &amp; possibly BILLIONS frm China &amp; Ukraine!
Joe Biden has spent his entire career supporting and promoting women‚Äôs rights. That's why I joined Women For Biden. Join women from across the country as we continue the fight for women's health care, paychecks, safety, and families.
Me too! But unfortunately, Chris Wallace is going to throw him softball questions, and give Biden the answers to the questions that Chris Wallace is to ask him. Its a rigged system. Just like 2016 election
What‚Äôs the point of this?  To ridicule him?  Go back to your mean girls clique.  This is not necessary.   I am a Republican woman for 42 years that voted for your Dad and I will be voting for your father‚Äôs friend.  White suburban women are supporting Biden.  #RepublicansForBiden

They sure would ask Obama or Biden and they would try to answer; Trump would just blow them off or insult them, as usual. üòñüòîüò∑
Exactly?  When you specifically asked who other than Dr. Fauci?  Now I see why you vote for dudes like Joe Biden. They do the same stupid stuff for 50 years with nothing beneficial and it's ok. You boys are cheerleaders and not real thinkers.  Emotional cheerleaders.
Ok, then tell me  What should we do then? You not offering anything substantive my guy, other then ‚Äúhurr durr Biden sucks‚Äù  Not voting in Nov isn‚Äôt an option.
That ought to pop up in every Biden speech between now and November.
Joe Biden knows what he is doing, Donald Trump does not!!!
Biden‚Äôs proposal is to increase the top bracket from 37% to 39.6%.
No more of your BS....stop trying to scare old ppl. Biden has experience and will not get rid of the police, but make it better.
I‚Äôve been up this morning, catching up with mom! ü§ó We‚Äôve been talking politics, and WHO is going to be Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick. There have been some pretty impressive people make the multiple lists, released. Who do you think it will be?
It will take about two Biden terms and 1-2 Susan Rice terms
I don‚Äôt any that are, but I‚Äôve seen several life long Democrats post they are voting Trump.  Biden is not the answer given his history and health issues.
- Good grief Andrew - all this discussion on the impact of the election if Biden wins.  Apart from tax cuts for the wealthy Trump has not been good for America. We have had a house of cards.
OMG! What pitiful and embarrising words from a former Jax sheriff. Oh, yeah, city was murder capital of FL while he was sheriff. He &amp; Trump obviously live in some alternative reality when it  comes to public safety. Replace them both. VOTE Deegan &amp; Biden.

"Help Americans buy their first homes"! Where have I heard that? Oh yes, during the Clinton and W Bush years! It lead to the mortgage, housing, and financial collapse of 2007-2008, and resulted in Bush's TARP and Obama/Biden's stimulus. Sorry, but I don't want ANY more of that!
You only have two options? Trump or Biden? Nothing else?
I listen to various news forums but not Fox which is the epitome of fake news so yes, I have a clue what‚Äôs going on! If you support trump, good for you but that‚Äôs your problem. I want our new president to heal our country and eliminate divisiveness!  Biden will hopefully do that!
Biden has proposed measures to help Americans buy their first homes, raise the federal minimum wage and boost taxes on the wealthy and corporations.

Bravo! Well said! I match my monthly Biden donation to  for this precise reason!
Peaceful protests coming to the suburbs once Biden is elected.
Great!! Continue to work for Biden!!
Have Joe Biden show up at her desk with live streaming crew giving her notice of dismisssal and perhaps revert her to DOJ for ongoing cases. VP can do that too in continuing, coordinated efforts on other Trump criminal accomplices.
Sorry, we were swamped out by 73 year olds who, in their final Earthly act, wanted to stop Gen-Z from having healthcare and marijuana. They came out to vote for Biden like it was life or death. Can't do anything if much of the Dem Primary crowd is addicted to "news."
Biden needs to stop kissing China's butt and start blaming them for this virus instead of our President - He may want to lay some of that blame on #Obummer since he delivered it to the Wuhan Lab! #NoCoincidences
They are working overtime to elect Biden
We don't recognize "America" now. It's now being run by an international CRIMINAL enterprise. If Biden wins &amp; the Dems get the Senate, the crooks &amp; traitors will be going 2 prison. #RIPGOP #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Is Biden the "Chaos Candidate"?
welcome to your city if you vote for Biden bunch of thugs brought to you by the Dem Party save us
I think it‚Äôs going to end up a lot closer,  it that it‚Äôs this large a margin says a lot imo. Hillary didn‚Äôt lose by that many votes, and the 2018 Senate/Gov races were extremely close, so Biden winning by a decent margin isn‚Äôt hard to picture.
did you catch Trump's briefing? Trump was going through a list of numbers and it seems like 600,000 ventilators was in his notes. He caught the error, stopped and immediately said that it was 600 new ventilators making the correction.  Contrast with Biden.
‚ÄúCarlson Endorses Biden‚Äù
Can Biden ever escape Obama‚Äôs shadow? Can he think for himself. I would like to hear Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù voice and ideas. Not what Pelosi wants him to say. Very disappointed with the dems ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù tactics and  hatred for Trump for 4 years. Out to get him attitude is not leadership
You mean the guy that you wouldn‚Äôt even endorse until everyone else was out of the primaries and even then you waited for a long time! Remember, you and Biden actions created Trump. Eight years wasted nothing for minorities or any strong legislation. #WalkAwayFromDemocRats
Neither Curry nor Trump cares about the citizens of our country, literally shut the fuck up. He only canceled because of Biden‚Äôs criticism on how poorly trump is handling the virus lmfao.

I'm canceling my account because all I see on every other commercial is you bashing our President and praising Joe Biden it would be one thing if it was equal but I haven't seen one pro President Trump commercial on  it's unacceptable not everyone watching is a liberal
This the smartest decision he's made in 3 1/2 yrs. Don't be fooled into thinking he cares all of a sudden. Cases are spiking here in FL. He's only trying to save his worthless ass. Biden leads him here by 13 points !! To little to late Donnie !!
I disagree with Obama's &amp; Biden's politics but the former was mentally sound. Biden's had a long career but like many ppl his age he's showing signs of rapidly decreasing mental acuity. Trust me, when it starts things can go south fast. He shouldn't even be put in this situation.
Come on Dan you are a rat on a sinking ship. Biden nor any human politician will be perfect but why as a much respected veteran, and in my opinion war hero, are you continuing to support a horrible human being aka Trump? Fight the Dems over policy but pls be that better Rep.
Biden can still read?
Come on, you must be a shill. Biden never did anything for any Americans except get rich off our backs. He has no chance of winning the Presidency,  he cannot put together two coherent statements. #DeepStatePuppet
Meh, just a typical Joe Biden supporter.  Nothing to see here folks, move along.
Because Trump is insane, Libertarians can‚Äôt win and Biden can
Biden has a fucking mush brain. This era sucks
It's interesting, and I RTd the "Warren-Policy Ear" article earlier, even thought maybe it could be Rice.  Gut keeps bringing me back to Harris, especially after reading the stuff on how close she was with younger Biden.
I have no idea what prompted this latest ‚Äúgaff‚Äù. This man has NO business running for anything. And the new polls out, Fox showed, claiming Trump‚Äôs behind him are as laughable as the inane things Biden says. Well it would be laughable except there are a few people voting for him.
America as we knew it was destroyed 4 years ago. Stop the chicken little nonsense. President Biden is happening so wait for it. Along with President Obama taking your guns &amp; creating death panels. üôÑ
Jeezus. Biden is up 13 points in FLORIDA?
Maybe, but if there‚Äôs no Republicans left for a majority we can get policy onto Biden‚Äôs desk a ton easier then Trump

Patriotic Women are so beautiful, which you know absolutely nothing about! The only thing fake is the little plastic Joe Biden dildo that vibrates you to sleep every night!!
Of course that would be the best way but I'm sure the Democrats will come up with some excuse before allowing Biden on stage with Trump!
I'm voting for Biden because all my dead ancestors will be.
They may do the Debates via Satellite - It could work - Biden needs to get front and center in his fight for the President - Then everyone will know who to choose!
You're an absolute lunatic.  We don't need a law and order candidate in the WH.  We need a REAL PRESIDENT.  You Go Biden.  Bye, bye.  Can't wait to see you go.

People need to start waking up and using their brain for more than just trying to understand Biden, Antifa or BLM's point of view. I think there's plenty of time for that in court.
I live in Jacksonville.  Although I believe Biden is up, no way by this margin.  I think it‚Äôs closer to 5%.
Fake Polls for Fake Presidential Candidate #basementjoebiden
Biden may very well win FL, but no, no one is winning FL by double digits.
Biden is using Warren's slogans and plans. Obama is echoing her call for big structural reforms. She remains a popular choice, if not the top choice, among voters. Leaving  out again, as Hillary did in 2016, is just wrong.
You know, Biden‚Äôs thing!!

Well remember that Trump is only 3 years ‚Äúyounger‚Äù than Biden, so basically whoever wins in November will be hovering around 80 at the end of his term. And I agree, that is a problem.
The fact that they have Trump leading Biden on the economy makes me think there's some accuracy to the top line number.
Trump still ahead of Biden on the economy and losing by 13 is something.
Biden is not fit to be president at allüòÇ

No, Obama did not immediately endorse Biden.  It's called "respect for the process".  He did not want to bias the results....something you know nothing about.
. . . . Sike. Not voting for Biden or Trump. You can't change my mind.
Thanks  üíû
That‚Äôs what they get now, little more than half or like 65~ish% but if Biden gets elected the taxes will be over 50%
Check out my thoughts on why Joe Biden needs to have a Black woman as his running mate!
If Biden wins, we may not see January 21.    I have a sickening feeling that the probability of that increases as  Trump continues to drop in the polls.
Wrong! These are liberals, Biden's ppl, throwing temper tantrums ONLY in blue states, allowed by Dem mayors to do this shit. And they are crying because Trump wants to stop them.  This is BIDEN"S MESS!
I hate Joe Biden too.
This is bullshit that's ONLY happening in Biden loving BLUE states that want to defund the police where their governors and mayors wont let cops do their jobs. Biden wants to weaken cops nationwide so ALL CITIES will look like this! It's not that hard to understand.
Watch ‚ÄúA Socially Distanced Conversation: President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden‚Äù on YouTube
can we stop calling Joe Biden sound bytes ‚ÄúSnippets‚Äù and start calling them ‚ÄúSniff-it‚Äôs?‚Äù
Absolute bullshit! He's perfectly clear and always makes sense. A miracle considering how much pressure he's under.  Biden can't speak without a teleprompter and wants to get out of debates because they know he can't debate Trump.
Yeah fuck the libs for selling us out the fascism. Their protests will get crushed or biden will make things ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but the system will not change, leading to further mass death from our global imperialist policies and foreign wars of aggression.
I like to think that Biden‚Äôs America wouldn‚Äôt involve people attacking peacefully protesting mom‚Äôs like the current America. I‚Äôm willing to take that chance.
Biden is called the modern Linden B Johnson because of how racist they both are.  said this

I just watched a  campaign ad on tv. Bullshit accusations of  Guy speaking saying that Biden absolutely said he wanted to defund the police, while showing some of the violence between protesters and police. Trump‚Äôs voiceover... he approves this message.

I've had turtle meat. I didn't know what it was (long story), was handed a plate of it at my first Navy squadron, thought it was chicken. I loved it.  Sorry, Biden has nothing on fried turtle.
Biden release his tax to fair and honest to ALL Americans. Why doesn't Trump do the same? He said is honest, prove it!
So if it was about Joe Biden it would be bad for him but because it‚Äôs Trump bragging about passing the dementia test 2 years ago, it‚Äôs just sickos. Love that maga worm brain logic
I am genuinely concerned about the aftermath of the upcoming presidential election... not just if 45 is re-elected, but also if he's not. How will 45's cult react if Biden wins? Law enforcement has already shown they will shy away from the angry white mob.

Trump is courting them. Biden is not. In 2016 Hillary did not push for campaign events in Tampa. Trump did. Im getting bad flashbacks.
This is the same thing the Far Leftist want to do here. Puppet Joe Biden would let it happen.
if Trump is terrified he is going to lose against Biden why do you say everyone has to vote hmmm
This is who will debate Biden
He follows a lot of people, including VP Biden and many other athletes &amp; politicians.
It wasn't a eulogy, it was a shameful display. By the way, Obama isn't running, Biden is and he is senile. Trump in a landslide.

Biden's VP will most definitely be better then Biden himself so yeah. But can I still hope that Biden doesn't get the nom and we go with his VP instead?
Your grasping at straws. Pathetic your a fraud and a looser  Florida for Biden
trump is so bored when he attacks biden. he doesnt have nearly the energy he did when going after hillary.
Neither is Biden or the Democrats.   So this is just a plain stupid tweet.
Even after Biden is sworn in, yes. Lots of racists to monitor.
You are soooooo right.  Soooooooooooo right.  Then Trump is going to blame Biden because Biden will have to raise taxes to make ends meet.  There is nothing backing American money. NOTHING.
I asked Mayor Jerry Demings about his wife, Rep. Val Demings, being in the running for Biden's VP pick. Demings says Val is ready for the job and would be great. He says they haven't heard she is out of the running so they're hopeful. Biden is expected to make his pick next week.
The latest things are the police and BLM . I am for making thinking better . How they r doing it is not . I do not agree with the immigration policy they want . I always felt I was more down the middle but now I am more right . I do not agree with Biden capital gains tax.

We‚Äôre not safe now.  We were safer from 2009-2016 so I‚Äôll take a chance on Biden!
seeing people talk about these people like a magic reset button's going to be hit if biden wins while over 150,000 people are dead will do that.

why are you having Biden‚Äôs wife on Fox?  Where is Trumps wife? She should be the first 1 to interview since she‚Äôs our First Lady.  Don‚Äôt care to hear what Biden‚Äôs wife says .Bad enough listening to Biden on Fox. She will have plenty of stations to visit like CNN
As much as I trust Biden not sniffing a little girl‚Äôs hair.

Something to consider:  What if Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, and Donald Trump are all guilty of sexually assaulting women and children?  I see a whole lot of finger pointing between "camps" as if "their guy" isn't involved in Jeffery Epstein's crimes.   #Election2020 #maga #Democrat
trump at a white house event is claiming biden is way to bernie's left. just insane, losing rambling.
There are videos of Biden ‚Äúdiddling‚Äù kids?
The problem is what the left wants went to far and for me it‚Äôs not about liking trump it‚Äôs about loving America! And Biden is in no shape to run a country. The things he has said he wants to do is nuts also . This is why people will vote Republican nothing to do with Trump
I wonder how many major pieces of legislation the people who call Joe Biden "mediocre" have passed. Or how many dictators they have stood up to. Or how many right-wing justices they have prevented. Or how many economic recoveries they have overseen.
Im glad you are supporting Joe Biden, but how in god's name do you justify voting for a blatant racist who ridiculed the disabled and had 13 rape allegations against him? All before last election.
Obama took Biden aside. He looked him directly in the eyes.  "Joe, I'd like to talk to you about the Black Nationalist Marxist Initiative..."  *Avengers music swells*

can someone out there get me some photoshops of biden wearing a dashiki or on m'baku's throne from black panther, were really gonna do this?
It makes me sad that Biden‚Äôs family is allowing this charade to continue. My dad had dimentia. The signs are there.
So what was probably an accurate record of a Biden campaign moment is now seen as propaganda by the trump-corrupted leadership at VoA. Got it.

Biden is a placeholder in my view.
Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It

This is actually true. Of the many things I‚Äôm worried about that a Biden Presidency would bring, his twitter account is the least of my concerns. It‚Äôs behind ‚Äúif he can remember what he had for breakfast‚Äù and ‚Äúwill Bingo Night become a thing at the White House‚Äù.

if biden wins he should commit to conducting the census for real, to overcome all the bs trump threw up and the virus. no reason we can't do a real census in 2022. the count is vital to our future.

Oh we will know a clue who has won because the numbers will be overwhelming in favor of Biden but while we are waiting for at least a week you can begin packing your bags.
Actually this has always been going on. Trump has given the supremacists cover to surface more. They are paying people to destruct to smear peaceful demos. Biden is about to win so the $hit show goes on.
After Biden wins I'm quitting social media for an extended period of time, not watching the news for an extended period of time, and up the drinking an extended amount in celebration of having the #orangeshitstain out of office and out of our lives.

Bingo. Biden can‚Äôt find his ass with both hands.

It will be known when all legally cast votes are counted. Could be that night. Biden in a landslide.

Yep    says Biden wins in a SLAM DUNK.
No we won‚Äôt. A low key racist, incrementalist like Joe isn‚Äôt the harbinger of sweeping reforms we desperately need, and protestors aren‚Äôt delusional enough to believe that he is. I DESPISE the ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù argument. But when the greater of two evils is Trump? ‚úÖ Biden
Exactly like you call a successfull black man and its obvious why bc your racism runs deep. All you try and do is misdirect and sorry ppls opinions are not fact. I provided you a list of factual racist things Biden has done.u cannot give me one factual thing of trump being racist
Just look st Bidens political history. All kinds of racist actions.
Biden is a conservative neo-liberal who promised our corporate plutocracy nothing would change so... makes sense. Let's see how replacing the progressives with Never-Trumpers pans out.
Biden said he would announce his VP pick around August 1st, right?
Traveling all over the Midwest haven‚Äôt seen one Biden sign lots of this!
Biden is a racist. Hiw many other white liberals would call a successful black man a NOBODY. I swear white liberals are some of the most racist ppl I've ever encountered. What would you call these black ppl?
Trump's with it! He knows how to tweet even before he was elected. He knows how to read other tweets and share what matters most. He knows what science says, what doctors are saying, but you Biden, are led around by doctors and told what to say, and you still mess it up! #Worried
Joe Biden isn't even the one tweeting! We never worry about  tweets! He uses them to drain the very swamp, the "Establishment" that Biden is caught up in! We are thankful for his tweets, his openness, him doing everything he can for America. #MAGA #KAG #4MoreYears

Act like Biden is trailing by 20 points.
I know a little about everything. Unlike u, I would die for my country! I TRULY believe president Trump has been touched by the hand of the Lord! What makes me sick, is its clear Trump is being cheated out of a fair election victory and I refuse to recognize biden in that case.
Now Biden needs to get out of his basement and campaign now that the polls are tightening.
The race usually narrows around this time. I tried to tell ppl gloating abt Biden's lead...
I am a mom and a FL educator who will definitely be voting for Biden who doesn‚Äôt court the NRA.
if we speaking in terms of how they are seen by others not personally it‚Äôd easily be biden. people are calling him the last resort but for hillary there was a lot of people who actually wanted her in office.
the economy is plunging and cnn is happy finally you all thinking impeachment and cnn daily bombshell did not work so you guys think well we finally have the recipe to bring him down if Biden wins anarchy that‚Äôs going on now will be on steroids
Why we have the term NIGGER.
To all these imbeciles that claim "President Trump has divided America"If Biden sleazes his way into the White House, they will see genuine division! They will see millions of pissed off  Patriots storm Washington and over throw the Globalist coup.  By force! Give me liberty!!!
Not a chance. Biden will win in a landslide and after that, the only unresolved issue will be where to send trump's last presidential check. By the way, these conspiracy theory, worst case scenario stories, serve no real purpose. Report real news and lay off the what if stories.
What Does Susan Rice Bring to a Biden Ticket?
The District Attorney is up for re election. The national spotlight was focused on her. Like Joe Biden who is backtracking like crazy on prohibiting fracking nationwide, she has seen the writing on the wall.
Just say it, Mr President. Just flat out say you hate black and brown people. Be specific. Your disgusting base will love it, and it will finally galvanize those still having a tough time swallowing the Biden pill to vote Dem in November.
We saw in 2016 when Dems went overboard trying to pretend Hillary's horrible track record was worth defending in the name of blanket "feminism" &amp; we've seen in gross amounts with Biden &amp; recently Kamala Harris as people start washing her horrid record for a possible VP pick
We will remember him as the Food Stamp President, and Joe Biden was his right-hand man.
Just to let you know, here in Florida, there are lots of Biden sign and flags all over!!! We are turning Florida blue!

Biden wants to make America remember how it feels to be anything close to united, to love again, to drive this hate this country has out, to bring us together instead of divide us.
it seems like the overwhelming number of Dem primary voters, including me, chose to believe him.  You can continue to moan about what he said to his donors. I‚Äôll vote for candidates that will help to achieve Biden‚Äôs proposed policies instead ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
His website has a 37 point platform with actual ideas for helping this country. Donald has his past accomplishments and a gift shop at his. Biden won‚Äôt tweet white power videos, spend almost 300 days at his private golf clubs, and make millions off of taxpayers.
Biden wants to actually lead and unite this country out of the darkness we are hurling towards, to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporate, to actually address the pandemic instead of wishing it away, he has an actual plan for racial equality, an actual plan for doing ANYTHING
As for ‚ÄúReal Policy‚Äù, Biden‚Äôs promise to establish a public option to expand healthcare access, reform the justice system(eg: eliminate private prisons &amp; ending cash bail), raise the minimum wage &amp; provide free community college is is already more than Bernie will ever accomplish
I did not address your claims of ‚Äúimperialism from Biden‚Äù simply because it was ludicrous.  Joe Biden, who has repeatedly vowed to reinvigorate traditional partnerships with likeminded countries &amp; has promised to reenter the Iran nuclear deal, is a imperialist? LMAO.

I am a trumper - but no to delaying the election. That will make me vote Biden.
That‚Äôs fine. Delay the election. Trump is out of office on Jan 20th at noon anyways if he isn‚Äôt re-elected. No election just means no trump or Biden. Win-win for me.
Your right, the economy would NEVER have contracted under a Hillary shutdown, NO ONE would have lost their jobs if Democrat led this pandemic. Ignore 3 years of success. Heck even Biden called the China travel ban xenophobic, clearly we'd be better off . . .
Every moment you spend tweeting is a moment you're not phonebanking for biden.   Hop to it, or it's your fault trump wins.
Obama/Biden handled this hands down a billion times better...no doubt

Biden never undermined democracy and became an authoritarian. He help fixed the economy the last time republicans tanked it and we will do it again
Politico really doesn't want Kamala Harris as VP. Must mean she's the correct choice as she makes old white men scared. They're also really giving Dodd a rub and tuck.

Biden would never let this happen. Go Joe in 2020!
Brilliant move by Trump though. We know mail in voting will have issues, if Trump wins, and Dems cry foul, he says I told you so. If he loses, it will be a stain on Biden's election as we continue to find uncounted ballots through 2022.

My opinion is that Trump knows it will be harder for certain demographics to get to polling places to vote in person versus by mail AND that those people would tend to vote for Biden.  If they still want to vote, he is willing to let them risk their lives...literally.
Voting for Biden and helping get the monster out of the WH is in no way a wasted vote
Right . Trump can actually think for himself and not a puppet like Biden would be
I don't think Trump is going to do so well in the world, because he has no plan for the virus or his campaign. (except to bash Biden).
Threaten to suspend it and then see how fast this mail in voting stops. This corona is serious stuff. The Dumbacrats say you don‚Äôt take it seriously and don‚Äôt do enough . Biden is stuck in his basement. You can‚Äôt do rallies and cancelled the RNC. Suspend the election. !!!!

It might - this could be some virus that eats the brains of liberals. It might explain Biden‚Äôs condition...  NEWS ALERT: Dems attempt to turn Trump supporters into ZOMBIES but end up catching their own disease.   WE are immune due to overwhelming evidence of intelligence.
You are back on the top of the most idiotic statement of the day after Louie Gohmert, took it yesterday.  Thank you for your mental and verbal diarrhea, making the Joe Biden's Presidency closer and closer. #WorstPresidentInHistory  #jailfortrump2021 #TrumpMeltdown
Keep the poor where they are at and keep the colored away from white suburban areas got it  you're going to lose to Biden n that's sad cuz he sucks dick, less than you but nonetheless

And push for a healthcare system that is not directly tied to employment so people keep their healthcare aka single-payer #MedicareForAll  Sadly, Biden isn't that guy.
Yes, we rather protest with Biden in the WH.
Way to go. Looks like you are not going to let the fact that Joe Biden is senile from stopping you from voting for him. Very revealing
Suburban, white, woman, mom, wife, antifascist voting for Biden. Oh, and I'm a Floridian. #SuburbsForBiden
Biden in April:  "Mark my words: I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held.‚Äù
There is nothing that they can ‚Äúuncover‚Äù about  Biden or his son  that would make me vote for DJT. Nothing.
None of Biden‚Äôs victims listen to him either in private.
Most likely she was cloned when she went into hospital in 18(?) for 2 weeks for cancer? That‚Äôs pretty quick for an octogenarian to get over cancer! If they had her clone ready it‚Äôs about right. They need updates so her getting sick fits. Biden needs updates often too. DJT knows.
Obama and Biden started locking kids in cages, it's a fact. Another fact there is nothing peaceful about the protests in Portland, Seattle and maybe all the murders in Chi-town.... I apologize if you are blind &amp; deaf
yes the economy tanked, thousands are dead, and trump is getting his butt kicked in polling  but JOE BIDEN HAS NEVER HAD A BOAT PARADE.
I'm over here cheering for a Joe Biden campaign commercial like I'm cheering for a football game
i hope theres somebody dedicated to yelling at joe biden 24-7-365 to ignore the deficit bs from the gop.

New poll shows Biden with just a 4-point lead over Trump in Florida
Joe Biden and cohesive thoughts. Two things you don‚Äôt often see in the same sentence.
Bumbling Biden in rare form. Stayed tuned . Plenty more to come
Means basement Biden wants slavery to return.
A couple of months ago my mom was watching Good Morning America. It was so....... empty. A good 90% of it was just... Nothing. Then I realized who watches this: the elderly and stay-at-home moms &amp; dads. The kind that vote for Biden.
I need to run Trumps campaign.  Here‚Äôs a new add: show Biden yesterday not knowing where he is or what year it is. Close add showing Biden being helped walking by a nurse. Stuff writes itself
But you must also see that Joe Biden shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to live by himself ....
They could say the same thing about Mayor Pete, or really any VP pick seeing as Biden will only be able to serve one term at most. So whoever he picks they will be the default dem nominee in 2024.
Biden 2020 . Is this Iowa or Delaware? What am I running for?
As a born and raised Floridian, I do not have faith in the polls showing Biden leading the state. The reasons why; Scott, Rubio, DeSantis, Gaetz, Yazoo Yohoo whatever, Osceola County, The Villages, Panhandle, Seminole County, Jacksonville.
I do not care who Biden nominates, any woman of color will face the same challenges here in the south where it's still 1937. I will vote for Biden to get us out of this disaster, and focus on ideal candidates in 2024.
The result is a much smaller lead for Biden than last week‚Äôs Quinnipiac University poll that gave Biden a 13-point lead.
Harris slept her way to her present position.  That is the primary reason Biden is considering her as VP.
Make the commandments he‚Äôs broken??? Btw we are all sinners my friend we do it everyday. It‚Äôs sad cause Biden has cognitive issues he will be crushed in the debate if he shows up. Then he will never make the Bernie Bro‚Äôs happy he‚Äôs in a tough spot
Thank you for the morning motivation to vote and work for Joe Biden #biden2020

I will proudly vote in person for Joe Biden
WHO WILL IT BE? Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said he would name his running mate in the first week of August.
Another win for your owner. Putin. Don‚Äôt worry folks Biden is going to fix this.
Having said that i'm still mad at Pamela Harris 4 attacking Biden in that early debate like she did even though he wasn't my choice. If this is a barrier to the close relationship needed then he should choose someone else. Val Demings for instance.
So a "newsperson" manages to capture the scoop - takes a picture of Joe Biden's personal notes &amp; media decides it's newsworthy. Do you suppose that "newsperson" would take a picture of Biden brushing his teeth or with a camera that penetrates clothing?
Brother turn off CNN &amp; MSNBC really he‚Äôs not a racist m, a jerk and conceited yes a womanizer most definitely but he‚Äôs really not a bad guy the Left has only 2 senators you forgot about the gay man on his cabinet as well look at Biden‚Äôs racial remarks 1977-

I wasn‚Äôt a biden supporter but surprisingly there was no one in the 22 candidates that really instilled confidence and experience for what this moment calls which is a statesman/woman that is a commodity.
Liberal Racists Think that if you are black or brown you therefore cannot be affluent and live in suburbs.   More JOBS is the only way to get more people who can afford to move out of Liberal police-less crime-infested cities.   Joe Biden will ensure people can't afford to move
YES!!  SUSAN RICE is the best choice as Joe Biden running mate and VP!

Conservatives are banned constantly from all platforms. You think it's bad now, it will be 10x worse if Biden wins. This isn't about just you, it's about our country as a whole. You flip flop constantly and then wonder why no one has your back.
"Poor kids are just as bright as white kids" -Joe Biden
"Poor kids are just as bright as white kids" -Joe Biden
Find me 1 place were Biden says he will defund the Police.   Because there is no such a place, just a doctored misleading TV campaign by Trump.  Also show me evidence of Biden being corrupt.   Why there are no indictments against Biden?
Not a hypocrite at all. But if you vote for Biden you are.
Why didn‚Äôt this video have Joe Biden pop out of the mailbox &amp; steal his mail at gun point? Listen to President Trump! Go online to your local Supervisor of Elections site &amp; request a mail in ballot. If you do not receive a ballot get your lazy ass up and show up at the pollls.
LMAO. Let me guess you‚Äôve never watched Fox. No they don‚Äôt have any leftists on there. The CEO and his stupid wife just maxed out in giving to Biden jus like they did to Hillary and Obama.
Harris would be a huge mistake. Think of the midwest voters. They‚Äôre ready to break from Trump, but they won‚Äôt go for a ‚Äòwoke‚Äô candidate. Biden needs a midwest veep, not a coastal elite.
Remember the movie Death Becomes Her, yeah that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on, they cannot have her die just yet. I believe they are doing the same thing with Biden.
And if you wanna get into it about how Biden isn‚Äôt that great, let‚Äôs go. Bc Trump is worse üòã
"Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden walks out of his campaign field office, Monday, Feb. 3, 2020, in south Des Moines, Iowa, with his granddaughter Finnegan Biden."
Even if the polls have Biden at 99% chance of victory, you all better still get out and vote
Both of my grandparents died of alzheimer‚Äôs. What Biden is doing is truly an embarrassment. What‚Äôs even worse is that if he wins, his VP could end up serving for 12 years as President.
Maybe she should tell Biden too
thinking of when jord posted on their facebook how they weren‚Äôt going to vote for joe biden bc he‚Äôs a predator ‚ù§Ô∏è the internalized self-hatred really popped out huh
Barr said yesterday that if (Biden) was being investigated, he would release that info even right before the election.  Anyone see a double standard here?  Obama in 2016 should have released the info that the racist Trump was really under investigation.
Contenders scramble as Joe Biden zeroes in on running-mate choice
No, I'm voting third party, I'm not supporting Trump, hell, unlike Biden, I'm actually supporting the protesters. I go third party out of my distaste for Dems and Repubs. It makes me feel good, like I voted for the really better people. I wish more would try it.
Joe Biden wants to have more police officers and increase police spending,so this ad is a complete lie in every way.
How when he isn‚Äôt fighting for extended federal for us! Where does he want us to go w no money? I can‚Äôt w him. Can‚Äôt wait to vote Mini Trump out of office and his daddy Trump gone! Don‚Äôt like Biden but anyone is better then Trump at this point.
Spoiler Alert: Biden‚Äôs VP will be awful, so will his cabinet choices, so will the next 4 years.
Your placard insinuated that Biden's supporters are killing cops, destroying property, looting, etc. I didn't put those words in your mouth, you posted them. Don't post statements like that if you don't mean it. Again I assume you aren't in favor of cops shooting unarmed people.
Obama Biden was pretty bad.
I‚Äôm praying you are FIRED from your post when Biden wins. You should be ashamed of promoting Trump as anything other than the one to blame for the botched response to a crisis that has killed over 150,000 of YOUR countrymen. Shame on you!!
CAS says Folks we're apolitical but we do believe in an economy built on renewables.....Joe Biden‚Äôs climate bet: putting jobs first will bring historic change - The Guardian
I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree however I do think she‚Äôs more politically aligned with Biden than any of the other VP picks. I do think Biden will choose someone a law enforcement background and more specifically a Black woman so it‚Äôs probably between Val Demings and Kamala
Dems always over emphasize identity politics of race, gender &amp; sexuality. Glad Scott called it! Remember Biden says you ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for him.
You are sundowning worse than Biden is...if you believe what you say
Seeing so many Republicans for the supposedly radical socialist, Joe Biden, makes me really nervous. He's a kind of moderate conservative parading as a moderate centrist. I'm probably going Green this year, call me when Nancy's gone and things start really changing.
People I used to go to church with are EXHAUSTING! you‚Äôre gonna vote for all of the recent anarchy to continue.... because Biden believes that women should have bodily autonomy? And yes this was posted by a cishet man üôÑ

We don't know how the party will respond if Biden's VP runs. The last time that happened was 2000, and the party did roll over for Gore (Bradley did not have much support).
Biden is picking a woman. The other options are all women. The people that don‚Äôt want Harris, want other women, some of them women of color. It‚Äôs not misogyny.   Did you see her come for Joe? I loved Harris and voted for in CA senate but would never support her as President.
So, the Section 8 housing that MANY disabled individuals who rely on thru SSDI for their living income will no longer be "a burden" ?  Does he even realize that this is a huge percentage of his, what, 36% following?  Don't worry, President Biden will address this in January.
Val Deming's tenure as Chief, however, also comes with criticism over complaints of excessive force, settled lawsuits, and a 2009 when Demings' service weapon was stolen from her work truck at home.   FULL STORY:
THIS is why they need term limits. Why has she not been removed due to signs of sundowning, like Biden? Why is someone who cares about this woman NOT protecting her &amp; getting her the help she needs. Instead her derangement passes bills.
Val Demings rose through the ranks of Orlando Police Department in her 27 year career, including 4 years as police chief.   Her personnel record shows overall many points of success and accomplishment.   FULL STORY:

Opinion | Now we know why Trump sought foreign help to beat Biden
1. Biden is testing the media to see how a Harris VP would shake out. Why have notes on her if you weren't even discussing her at that event? 2. Biden has no idea that cameras have zoom and messed up 3. If it's not Harris this tease is gonna piss folk off
Capitalism has staying power. Trump gets credit for helping the rich. No one else. He inherited a good economy from Obama/Biden. It's a news media scam that all trump need's is a good economy to win re-election. He needs a brain transfusion &amp; it prob still wouldn't work.
In Florida, we call this Biden Syndrome
If i was an adviser 2 the Biden campaign (prob good that I'm not) or working on a trump documentary i would put 2gether a compelling case how trump handled the covid crisis exactly like he handled every other tragic event in the last 4 yrs. Incompetent &amp; driven by severe neurosis
Biden is not getting elected buddy
You errored.  That is Biden you are speaking about
Black Americans are the reason we have Biden as the Democratic Nominee. Forgive me for taking the advice of men like John Lewis and Jim Clyburn over a fool like you, willing to hurt all Americans with a vote for the Green Party. It‚Äôs clear you don‚Äôt understand the stakes. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
#kanyewest   I appreciate that you are running for President, because you would be a better conservative President than Trump. But, sadly, I think all you will do is pull Black voters away from Biden, and help Trump get reelected. Unless, that's your plan all along?
I am voting for the future. While I would have loved to see Bernie in office, Biden is the only way to get tr*mp out of office.
Given the circumstances of Biden's age, I imagine the narrative that his VP will be "anointed the successor in waiting" would be applicable to anyone he selects. Regardless, I doubt this issue rises to the level of *the* reason Biden picks someone vs how they pair ideologically.
To Joe Biden:  you have a personality in Kamala Harris that will make America stand up.  In her debate with you, she said how it was.  Isn‚Äôt it better to challenge an incumbent then support them like the Republicans do w/ trump.  Don‚Äôt kick the can down the road; pick it up!
One can only hope that when Biden gets into office he will put a halt to this nonsense.
With Trump, instead of U.S. progressing, we are regressing.  I imagine President Biden will re-implement it.
Biden wouldn‚Äôt have stood a chance if Bernie just killdozered him üò´
Biden needs to be the Abe Lincoln of our time. Look at the Douglas-Lincoln debates for example. Lincoln made a stark contrast between Douglas. Unity. I‚Äôm writing an article about this. Coincidentally, we have  to help with that analogy for this election.

Joe Biden - President Return to Decency
WHO WILL IT BE? Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said he would name his running mate in the first week of August.
Except for Russian assets in the United States that are US citizens, there is not a single solitary person in the United States, who cares about the future of the US, who should vote for Trump.  It should be 125 million for Biden and less than 10,000 for Trump.
Did it ever occur to you that all of this civil unrest is your fault. Here we are with a corrupt president and the people of America don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre going to do next. America is scared. We need Joe Biden to govern.
Biden calls the demon seed woman a "disgrace" and calls out Trump for pushing her nonsense.
if they open up Biden will have to debate Trump live on stage. This lockdown is of course going thru the election.

It‚Äôs sad and shameful that silence majority are forced by Liberal Democrats to be silence through violence. Our Freedom of speech is suppressed by political thugs and criminals; Biden is taking a knee to these terrorists. This is not the America that I know and love!

Never trumpers did not vote for him the first time so he does not need them to win. The problem is the far left went 2 far n Democrats are leaving in high numbers . Biden won‚Äôt come out and let anybody interview him . Not sure he can handle the job no matter how much u hate trump
Ok about that, does it seem like ,Biden, Obama, Hilary have all aged a lot in the last 6months? There was someone else too that all of a sudden looked drastically older.
We can‚Äôt be too far off from Romney endorsing Biden?
If Biden wins the popular vote by 9% there's no way he's losing the electoral college, Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1%, if she won by 3% she'd be president
HOW ABOUT BIDEN VOODOO DOLLS?
Nice try Eric.  17 seconds of Biden is going to bring out 17 hours of Trump trying to speak.  Did you think this out?  Don't you see how trump talks (tries to)?  Has he ever made any thought develop for more than 5 seconds while not reading off a teleprompter?

Barrack Obama and Joe Biden rescued our economy once, Joe Biden, and a woman in charge, can do it again.
Are you talking about when Trump acted unilaterally before any recommendations from CDC and shut down travel from China? You know, when Joe Biden called him xenophobic for putting a travel ban in place? Or, perhaps you‚Äôre talking about the 32,000+ dead in New York?
Just on the off chance some poor soul needs to hear it. BIDEN has not been able to fix anything in nearly 5 decades in public office, except maybe his personal networth. Let that sink in.  Curious, I wonder how much of govt payoffs for sexual harassment were Biden‚Äôs?
8 years was #Obama and #Biden in power: we became number one oil producer in the world; totally independent from the energetic point of view.  Subsidies? That‚Äôs a socialist thing and Republicans don‚Äôt like socialism?   I am surprised you are talking about this
The media really needs to start asking the hard questions about Biden‚Äôs competency to lead. This is scary how he is being handled. Why isn‚Äôt he allowed to talk.

biden is the poster child for this MEME!!
It was important for me to state why, even though I remain a Republican, I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden in November.  My thoughts are summarized in this article.
Joe Biden would need a handler to help him find the helicopter and navigate the stairs.
The Kennedy‚Äôs are iconic, I‚Äôd love to see him win. If he doesn‚Äôt, and Biden chooses Warren to VP, the super majority in Massachusetts will force Baker to appoint a Democratic Senator. If that‚Äôs the case, it should be him. It would all work out.

Who is the radical left? I mean, I lived 16 years of Democratic Administration (Clinton and Obama): never saw any ‚Äúradical left‚Äù or ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù or ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù thing happening  Biden was a very successful VP with #Obama, he knows the job, they handled the crisis they had very well
My guess is cloned &amp; contolled! Her eyes are the tell but she also looks like she‚Äôs had work done. That will prob be her cover story like HRC. Biden is a clone &amp; controlled but they didn‚Äôt work on him till too late dementia had already set in. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll make it long.
As States Take Pandemic Lead, Biden Is Said To Weigh At Least 2 Governors For¬†VP
Stuff like that is why I don't see Biden winning Texas. They are crazy. #LRT
I will say I'm leaning towards Biden winning Wisconsin. It's looking good for him so far.
Biden doesn‚Äôt have a campaign or a voice, he‚Äôs an empty suit unable to take ?s. He‚Äôs weak.
Joe Biden will get the coronavirus under control and protect our health.
Hillary dominated Trump in the burbs in PA too but she failed to match Obama's turnout there, and hence why she lost. Biden would have to not only best Hillary but match Obama's turnout. That's where enthusiasm comes into play.
I don't think Biden is winning PA. Just looking at voter registration data and enthusiasm. I got Trump winning that.
Yet he‚Äôll still have 2-1/2 months to wreak havoc before President-elect Biden is sworn in (knock on wood).
Never thought he would win the first time. So yes. If he gets a live debate yes. If they keep Biden in the basement then... if that happens the media will be an accomplice to a coup.
I have yet to see any Warren supporters say this. 100% of the ones I know of are voting for Biden even if Warren isn‚Äôt the VP.
I've been predicted Biden would win Michigan.
That‚Äôs can‚Äôt be right... the DNC‚Äôs plan from the beginning was to be ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù. They never scheduled a convention. Trump did, not Biden.
Biden will do and say whatever his "handlers" tell him to.  "Ignore the man behind the curtain"!
And you‚Äôre a Russian, pupppet.  At lease Biden is American.

I‚Äôm not going to even touch name calling. Do you know who the president is? Come on now.....  Lol of course Biden would‚Äôve done better since he actually knows how government is supposed to function. He also would‚Äôve shut the fuck up and got the fuck out of the way and let....
I was a supporter of Trump but no more. However I don‚Äôt think Biden is the answer.
"Republicans raise concerns about the cost of the Biden Recovery Plan: Too much too fast? Up next on CNN"
Lol Biden is the number one racist. "You aint black, slight Indian accent" he's got quite a few phrases.
I suspect part of the problem is the LP attracts many leftists who agree with ending drug prohibition, but are not consistently pro-liberty.  Also, they may be pandering to the left because they know Biden has no chance of winning and are hoping to attract some of his voters.

This is not Biden country. Have you seen Trump Rally's in Florida? This is a joke. I would rather vote for Trump than vote for a baby sniffer and a supporter of pedophiles.
Omg he is infecting my state. Nasty. Get rid of this nasty pedo!!!  Biden was on the Lolita express 3 times.
Why are you so scared of people voting in person, huh Biden?
Forget all the Kamala tea-leaf reading. I'm just intrigued by the idea of a president who has cohesive thoughts that he takes time to write down in organized fashion before speaking aloud, TBH.
Who knows gregg. Bumbling Biden doesn‚Äôt realize he even said that. You can see them already setting this thing up for claims of voter suppression . They call someone having to show a picture ID to vote , a form of voter suppression. Yep; suppression of an illegal vote!!!

why should they not protect federal property? If the protestors want to reshape the justice system to make it more equitable, it‚Äôs def ok. But they should take their concerns to the ballot box. Biden (if elected) will always nominate judges that will further the protestors‚Äô cause
He has taken steps but until we clean the house and retain the senate... I won‚Äôt hold my breath. Hell still waiting for justice on the Clintons. Biden. Etc.
Chances are, when Joe Biden went to school, they had calligraphy (handwriting, penmanship, etc) classes. I took 1 semester of it in high school back in the old country, but it didn't help. The books and ink pens were not left-handed friendly.
You know what?.. I‚Äôm not even gonna debate this, I‚Äôm glad you came around and decided to vote for biden!
Biden‚Äôs Notes on Harris Caught by Photographer: Campaign Update
This is wild! Also if y'all took a photo of my notes you would not be able to read them, just ask my sister  -- LOL!
You have a better chance to encounter a tyrannosaurus Rex than see Biden answer real reporters‚Äô questions.
BOA donates $1B too ok BLM/Biden.  What are they funding between now and November 3rd?  Putting more ANTIFA on payroll to wreak havoc.  This will be investigated.
Once Biden is sworn in, I'll feel better.
My hypothetical doesn't have Biden taking office at all
Jo Jorgensen has generated way more excitement for the Libertarian Party than Gary Johnson did in 2016. She is an eloquent woman with a fantastic Libertrian background dating back to the 80‚Äôs. She has made a couple small mistakes but small potatoes compared to Biden and Trump
I can't wait till you're our FLOTUS. We really need one that does important work like this. Thank you Dr. Biden.
Biden &amp; Nadler 2020. Two demented idiots - what a joke.
Imo she‚Äôs a milquetoast Democrat that won‚Äôt fight for true progressive ideals. I didn‚Äôt expect Biden to get Bernie or Nina Turner or anything, but I hoped he would have done better than Harris.  I wanted someone to fight for the things Biden wouldn‚Äôt. An olive branch to the left.
Biden isn‚Äôt the one bragging about how he can still identify zoo animals and remember 5 words.
Biden &amp; Obama Have Infuriating Health Care Discussion  via
""Donald Trumps' America is the scariest America I've seen in my lifetime," Rep. Demings says in response to President Trump's claim that Joe Biden wants to ‚Äúabolish the suburbs."  "The president is doing everything he can to instill fear.""
He walked on stage by himself. He stood at a podium by himself. Why did Biden need a mask?
Maybe don't be a biden endorser if you don't want to be called out over it.
Gotcha. Will do my research, as I haven't heard this.   I recall Biden had a pretty horrible record until recent with LGBT issues. Defense of marriage act and cutting off federal funds if they teach the acceptance of homosexuality.  2020 election must extra suck as a gay man üòÖ
Trump looks like a bad ass chad while biden looks like the pedo from family guy.
Maybe I missed it, but has anyone heard Joe #Biden or any other #Democrat condemning the #violence in #Portland, #Seattle and #Chicago? #hypocrisy
Tell me bob what policies do you like about Biden and why should I vote for him?
My money is on a true believer like Stephen Miller. But yes, Biden = Hindenburg.
Wait.  What happened to the ‚Äúsummer of love‚Äù? How do people with a mental IQ of 50 get elected?  How is a sub zero IQ man Biden the Democratic nominee? Where are the real democrats? Cowering in the corner with the GOP? If we don‚Äôt fight we lose America.Equation: DEM=GOP.  No dif.
...who?  Never heard of any of these people. And voting for Joe Biden regardless of who‚Äôs on the ticket with him.
Biden/Harris ticket. The worst card the #DNC could ever come up with. Horrible that I have to vote for this fucking option because of trump. We are screwed regardless.
I don't actually. Biden knows actual policy. He knows HOW things work, not just that they work.
I'd love to see an interview with Biden's personal trainer. (He talked about his workouts in a call with Buttigieg).  Someone should ask Trump about Fauci's record selling limited edition Topps baseball card...ü§£Joe Biden and a enthusiastic woman running mate. GO JOE 2020
Did I miss something? Is California in play for the repubs now? Why would Bass being more popular in California matter? Harris is the only real nationally known and respected option. God I hope Biden and the Dems don‚Äôt fuck this up. Pick Harris and move forward!
A rock could beat Biden!
You mentioned Daniel Cameron and his hesitancy to press charges while also pointing out his support of Trump but it's not Cameron's job to do so. It is the district attorney's role. The district attorney is a Democrat and a Biden supporter. I was making a similar observation.
Biden has to be the most racist presidential candidate as he worked with Southern Democrats during the 70's, yeah. 197Oz. Joe Blow can't walk up the stairs, let alone run a country! Trump is the energizing rabbit that never quits, never stays down n counterpunches are world class
Trump is his buddy. Biden is his friend. The only candidate who won't block a prosecutor from bringing him down is
Ever move the Democrats stagetegics have puttered out into doom and gloom, as their race ploy did not being out the federal intervention they prayed for  Excuse me, they don't pray, They had hoped for that result! Game, Set, Match is over; Where is Biden anyway! Dems want do-over
I personally don't care if Harris is not the VP selection. Just like you are surrounded by people you can work with to accomplish your goals, Biden has a right to select a WOMAN as he promised. It is people like you who want to change the VP requirements after such a promise.
This relief is non-negotiable. Put  House bill up for a vote as we need to protect our citizens, the  and state/local governments and services.   Mitch is holding out for more Trump poll #‚Äôs and will let our country collapse if he thinks Biden will win.
That is why I will be voting in person, for Biden.

Any chance you Useful Idiots can break down the Tara Reade story on a future episode? Maybe review the exculpatory evidence that has dropped since your first interview?   Seems kind of important given the accusation that Biden assaulted her and the subsequent push to replace him.

You are the one that should be ashamed supporting a dumbass like Biden. Please look up some of his speeches and educate yourself.
What exactly have dems done in Biden, Pelosi,Schumer 30-40 years?
It would have to be private security, since they want to defund police departments. Not a dime until we see THREE debates between Trump &amp; Biden.
Or Obama and Biden üòÇ
When you don't check your social media message requests for a while, &amp; when you do, you find heartwarming notes from Biden fans. Like this one, from someone named "Skyy", that was sent to me in March. (Gotta love that voter outreach, Joe‚Äîthis stuff brings *everyone* on board!
I don‚Äôt care who thinks what and you shouldn‚Äôt either. Joe Biden ***will not win*** with anyone but  ESPECIALLY if he needs to introduce the world to one of his fringe picks. This is silly.
Joe Biden is even too creepy in a pedo to be invited to Epstein Island.
This situation is very common. The crises of couples &amp; families affected not just by COVID but by means-testing meanness--burning through savings to cover rent/mortgage &amp; all the copays/deductibles/bills thanks to employer-based healthcare that Biden et. al. insist is best. NOPE.
REALLY  YOU COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN A BETTER PICTURE OF BIDEN? what are working for Trump?
Biden is a more effective opponent to the revolution than Trump is.
Biden's not going to stop any of that, he isn't even saying that he will.
It was inappropriate at a funeral.. It was not a rally for Biden which is what he made it into. Shameful...
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
For the first time, Biden has started to pass the 50 percent mark in Florida polls.  Biden carries a 6.8-percentage-point lead over incumbent President Donald Trump.

Biden thinks she‚Äôs fixing his zipper! Poor Joe üòÇ
I told him that if Assange is extradited while Biden‚Äôs President that Glenn would probably be right behind him. Then he tried to flip it around on me that I wanted him jailed simply because I disagree with him. I was like F you, I think you may have committed crimes.
Silver alert, someone tell Joe Biden where he is...
Biden has already shown he‚Äôs tougher on China than trump. In January, Biden called for us to be tough on China &amp; demand transparency from Xi on coronavirus...at the same time trump was (checks notes) doing nothing but calling it a hoax &amp; praising Xi for doing a great job.
Please keep pounding the all of your points, we are all going crazy, kid transmission, mask, no mask, goggles, riots, reverse law enforcement, my God, the country is upside down, Biden, left extremists, I take back my time, Obama grandstanding..
Donald Trump lies.  He‚Äôs a liar.   The Republican Party is lying.  It‚Äôs all they have left.   Biden speaks to a child here.
What was it you were saying about Biden being wrong about tRump delaying election?  Guess you don't know the  after all.
Joe Biden will never win in Ohio.   Trump 2024.  End of story.  #MAGA

If you truly loved your country, you would have endorsed  . She's the real change. Biden is just a blue Trump.
This president is for "freedom for himself" to do whatever he chooses. Joe Biden is NOT a socialist...he is a moderate.
Joe Biden could shoot somebody on Fifth Ave. and he wouldn't lose any votes. So drop the pro Kremlin Andrii Derkach info..it matters not.
Nate Joe Biden will never be President of the United states.  Never.
I so hope Biden is elected because once Assange in extradited I'm betting we're gonna get a "twofer" with you as well. You don't just want Trump to get reelected, you need him to get reelected. I can't believe I thought you and Matt and the Intercept were gonna advance journalism
Exactly when did you start working for the Biden campaign??
Biden sucks. Vote for Biden.
Who cares what Nunes has on Biden . Joe Biden could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and still not lose votes. He could be in pictures with pedophiles Epstein and Maxwell and no one would care.Biden could extort an ally to gather dirt on Donald Trump, Congress would say It's OK.
If you‚Äôre voting for Biden, you ain‚Äôt a republican.
We will once  again  have a president who can speak  in complete sentences!!  #WeWillVote  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #Biden
Biden may be unfit for the Presidency. trump is unfit for humanity.
What is most interesting is her association to the U.N. and a growing speculation that Biden's mental health is worsening.  Though the Democrat leadership sees it as not an issue now, within 8 months if elected they will decide it is an issue.  If Biden steps down who becomes VP?
But Biden though????
Voting and participating in the democratic  process  are key. The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change  agent you  have  in a democratic society.  You  must  use it because  it is not guaranteed.  You can lose it  ~John Lewis  #WeWillVote  #Vote  #JohnLewisMemorial  #biden
what doe's that have to do with Biden authoring a bill designed to accelerate the incarceration rate? and proudly bragging about that bill up until very recently?
Biden wins in a landslide that‚Äôs all u really need to know.
If in doubt I suggest you remove political ideaology differences from the equation &amp; focus on the honesty and integrity for comparison of the 2 Candidates. You won‚Äôt find Joe Biden‚Äôs Niece writing a negative book on him.
Joe Biden shoepeg corn pop for his VP.
So Biden was correct to predict that the Liar in Chief would bring it up? trump's entire presidency - every lie, every drop of his epic incompetency - is ripe for a 'scathing denunciation.'
Yes. A Biden Landslide victory. #SweepyJoe
Biden‚Äôs on fire all right.
Lol.  Biden couldn‚Äôt run a hotdog stand.
As long as Trump loses before Jan 20th, when Biden takes the oath of office, it doesn‚Äôt matter when the election is held.  The shorter that ‚Äúlame duck‚Äù Trump is in power, the better.
I‚Äôve been in Ohio for the past week and saw probably the only Biden sign in the state yesterday
Thx followed
Is the press in the United States aware that hey free and unbiased press is not tolerated in socialist countries. That means the idiots in the media that are pushing people to vote for Biden which means a vote for socialism will very shortly after the election will not exist!
You and about a million other people have done it too. But it can be done with Biden, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc. Know why? Because politics is all the same game just different players.
They call our president unwell and crazy yet Joe Biden is in the basement with a bib.
That's a lie. Biden has committed to 3 debates. Also, tRump stumbles every time he speaks in public. His grammar is atrocious. You must not pay too much attention to him when he speaks.
Hunter Biden is an American citizen and as such has no place on your agenda.
Make that two. I wanted Warren to run in 2016 and I supported her in 2020. I voted for Hillary and I'll be voting for Biden.
You're right. It's divisive. I'm a lifelong Democrat. In 2016 I voted for Bernie and then Hillary in the general. I voted for Warren in the recent primary, and I'll vote Biden in November.
Lock him in and move Biden to Pelosis' office

Joe Biden Inadvertently Opens the Door to More Education Choice
Hey, does anyone know if Joe Biden is still alive?
You don‚Äôt walk away from Allies!  Trump has no understanding of this.  Yes, pressure all NATO nations to pay their fair share, but you don‚Äôt abandon those Allies! Vote for Biden on November 3, 2020!  The Date for Trump Supporters to vote  is Wednesday November 4th!
yeah if Trump was denying President Bernie I'd be lacing up my boots but Biden? lol
Some reports have named Chris Dodd as the ringleader of this obnoxious campaign against Harris.  Biden needs to get rid of him as an advisor on VP if he wants to win in 2020.
I find it astounding that Biden does not go over 47% in any of these matches. This is why we can't count Trump out yet.
So wait, Biden supports expunging marijuana arrest records but doesn't support legalization?    I guess we'll just keep arresting people and then expunging the arrest records?
What are you guys talking about? Is Biden POTUS? Does he have powers of executive orders? Is he a senator? Biden doesn‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs at. He will do what his owners tell him to do. Nothing is more clear than the Democrat party is now openly a communist party.
If Biden wins it‚Äôs AOC‚Äôs party.
Kamala Harris lost my confidence in her when she used a bussing issue to paint Biden as if he was complicit with that issue. SHE HAD TSHIRTS ALREADY MADE AFTER THAT DEBATE. That's was cruel and inconsiderate of those who fought and died dealing with that  #WarrenorRice
If you think Joe Biden...if he wins will be running the show you are delusional. You will get your wish if as Ilhan, AOC and the rest of socialist/jihadist/communist freaks will be running the show. But hey don‚Äôt worry #socialism will work out this time...lol
Easy and convenient to elect Biden.  Don‚Äôt fall for it FL- need in person voting for a fair election.  Verify ID to the person voting.  Unbelievable that you can vote in states like CA WITHOUT photo identification!!!
are you all ready to take to the streets to defend your right to vote for Joe Biden?  yeah, me neither
Many people say you haven‚Äôt done yours and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre voting for Joe Biden.
Pro tip, shadow campaign is not the term you should use when writting anout white men trying to stop a black women from getting a job. Looks weird
would you prefer a 'whole bowl of shit''? if you're not for Biden, you're for trump. not hard. at least he has a chance; Bernie had none maybe try to get over it.
Vote for Joe Biden. He won't accuse your mother of being a violent anarchist and teargas her, or shoot her with a rubber bullet and leave her with brain damage. All for the crime of exerting her First Amendment rights.
These are the things Americans should know about Biden. Of course he won‚Äôt be in office long but his Vice President going to have the same ideas?
Biden will select whom he feels will help him carry out his agenda.
No no it‚Äôs true what Trump did. Obama and Biden had their own plan AFFH. If you don‚Äôt believe look it up. That is what Trump and Ben Carson got rid of.

So by not voting for Biden, you‚Äôre actually placing a vote for Trump C‚ÄôMON MAN!
Whhhaattt
Yeah Biden might not be the most exciting candidate, but that's not what it's about. It's about electing a candidate that has experience and policies that can effect our lives in a positive way. A lot of people don't vote for candidates with their best interests in mind.
Didn't Biden apologize for all that, and not supporting the gay marriage thing ?  ü§£üòÇüòÖ
Well, not to be morbid, but Joe Biden is 77, and Donald Trump is 74, so maybe their vice presidential picks are more important than usual for a reason.
Am the only white woman I know in Fla for Biden
Interesting thought but I don‚Äôt think that that would cause republicans and independents who were already voting for Biden to not do so.
Strikingly similar article to the one written in April about   the mad libs version of the VP whisper game.  'Joe Biden allies quietly working against (insert woman's name), claiming she is too (insert an otherwise complimentary adjective).'
Followed all
Who seriously thinks Biden is going to even [cognitively] make it through his first term?
The VP pick isn't going to debate Trump for Biden ? No doubt every mind is made up.  I'm 'VOTING AGAINST' Biden and 'FOR TRUMP' this election.  Unlike before, I 'VOTED AGAINST' HRClinton and had NO OPTION but Trump.  Most Dems are not VOTING FOR Biden, just VOTING AGAINST Trump.
He Kisses Biden on the mouth

We‚Äôre coming for you next, Senator.  A Biden DOJ will indict you, hopefully.
Dems tied themselves up in the bad messaging of the protestors* and are going to have to try hard to distance them from it.  Biden currently feeling that pain, imo.   *I agree w/protestors on police brutality and systemic racism.  Just saying their messaging/solutions are wrong.
Yes, they've been ongoing, that's my point.  They are now dragging out with no purpose, and people who were (rightly) outraged about police brutality are now wondering what the point is.  Meanwhile, the left bought into "defund the police" slogan, whether Biden onboard or not.
Let's also not forget that he once said certain de-segregation policies would lead to his children growing up "in a racial jungle".
Joe Biden is touted as a candidate that stands up for racial justice, BLM, etc. but people seem to forget about the 1994 crime law he helped write that lead to the injustices we see today against black and brown communities.
Apropos of criticizing partisanship in our City Hall:  If you vote for Biden, it doesn't mean you're a bad person. You're probably a Democrat.  If you vote for Trump, it doesn't mean you're a bad person. You're probably a Republican.  Mud-flinging can be fun, but it isn't reality
The democratic biased presidential polls have a very significant purpose. When the Dems do their voter fraud scheme they will point at these bias fake polls and say that Biden was always in the lead that there is no fraud.#WeKnowBetter #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
People are acting like Biden is going to somberly start the hard work of unification and repair lolololol  the Democrats are going to treat this like America unanimously decided that Rahm Emanuel's austerity regime is what we demanded

John Edwards revealed how you're just handled people just hold your hand coddle you feed your ego give you what to say that is Joe Biden right now but it's worse.
You mean besides Biden saying poor kids can do as well as white kids?  If America today was like America in 1960 "maybe" I could understand some of the outrage except they won the debate by peace.  Today the debate is over lesser issues than then and they expect to win by war.

Why Biden‚Äôs V.P. Pick Could Cinch the 2020 Race  via
What they are doing is Joe Biden is a elderly abuse.
Joe Biden will select the most intelligent, the most ethical and the most judicial people for his cabinet. He will not surround himself with felons. Your cabinet members and your shadow people are always on a conveyor belt, in and then out the door.
This should be a CAKEWALK. Biden, whom the Democratic Party chose over all others because they believed him to be the best, should have double-digit leads in every mfing state. I mean, over the single most incompetent, ignorant, &amp; corrupt president in US history. Why doesn't he?
imho we need to get the party to the place where Biden, Pelosi, Clinton, etc not only are *not* making policy anymore, but are afraid to appear in public.
Trump winning is the path to the reformation of the Dem Party into something useful.   Biden winning means that the left gets locked out of Dem leadership and policy for at least another generation.
Crime surges on Trump's watch as he warns of Biden's America

Yo, Biden is basically a sane Republican.
It's understandable because the police fate rest in the hands of Trump, If Biden wins the police agencies across the country will see their power diminished so much they will become nothing more than a investigation agency.
I hope it does, Biden's caretakers pose a bigger threat.The fact that  is saying he can beat #Biden proves he is in the race to take votes from #biden and ensure his homie Trumps re-election. #kanye u are a sucka! Please #vote #biden and send Kanye and Trump back to their narcissistic looney bins.

She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
‚ÄúWhen Biden told reporters...he would choose a running mate in the first week of August, two aides told CNN that the timing of an announcement was more likely to be pushed back until the week of August 10. But Biden's advisers gave him a deadline of next week to make up his mind‚Äù
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
I bet Biden announces his VP on Monday.
Well said. Too bad we couldn‚Äôt have Biden/Obama.

I travel all over... I see U.S. flags on cars, I see Trump written on cars, Everywhere I go.  Yet I have not seen even one Biden yard sign...  The embarrassment must be great.
Dear Joe Biden:PLEASE PLEASE PICK KAREN BASS AS YOUR VP! Thanks from Florida, see you in November

Joe Biden kissing a 14 year old student on the lips....Is this the action of a man that should be President if tge United States?
Yes many of the born again followers who are spreading that Mr Biden is a Marxist
How about making sure more of the GOP votes for Joe Biden. Trump should leave the WH to a jail.
Certainly, Biden will do less. By far.
"We just want healthcare"  Are you even old enough to not qualify for your parent's ins? Do you know what it meant pre- Obama / Biden &amp; the ACA to be less than 26 &amp; want health ins? You'd only be able to afford a casualty policy in case you broke your leg skateboarding.
Wow who wrote that for him? BIDEN PLEASE DEBATE OUR PRESIDENT!!!!
Trump Defends ‚ÄòDelay the Election‚Äô Tweet, Even Though He Can‚Äôt Do It
Crenshaw High that's where I'm from... I'm voting Biden cuz I know a 80% of the Black church were begging the feds to do something &amp; supported this law. These people that watched a gangbanger movie or 2 don't know a damn thing about stepping over crackheads to go to school.
Joe Biden robs black people
Because hope will take away chance of Biden winning..
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.

I would like to know the same thing. Everyone voting Obama and Biden are predators
Obama is a predator so is joe Biden
Latest information from Lancet regarding the risk factors for DEMENTIA . I wonder which ones contributed to Joe Biden‚Äôs mental condition?
Landslide! Only a fool would vote for Biden
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now‚Äîyou won‚Äôt get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone‚Äôs ideas before we vote.
We will vote!! Biden 2020.
It is fear that is causing him to try and delay the inevitable, which is the American people choosing Joseph Biden. I mean how appalling is it that the sitting president doesn‚Äôt have enough respect to attend Congressman John Lewis‚Äô funeral. Thank God he only has 5 months left!
Untrue! What really concerns Ms. Greenhouse is that there are any Conservatives on the Supreme Court! That said she looks forward to Joe Biden ‚Äúfixing‚Äù that by packing the court!
The great American hero will be Biden when he wins and takes office
is a clown and should retire along with Trump, Biden, McConnell, Pelosi, Schumer and all of the other politicians over 65!  And, we need term limits now!
Let‚Äôs say there is a massive Covid outbreak, Joe Biden gets the disease and dies Oct 15. Would there be a push for the election date to be moved?
A Biden bro was mean to me on Twitter now I can't justify voting for Biden. Maybe think twice before you go around calling people selfish.
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
If God help us Biden wins the covid-19 will miraculously disappear January 2021.
If it wasn't for 2016-2018 id probably be a Biden supporter ü§≠üòÇ
No matter who Biden picks as VP, the GOP will pull her apart.
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!
It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
The same you as the lazy deserve a lazy president like Biden, you will see what he is going to convert to the USA.  TRUMP2020
Send Biden to a nursing home, he's decrepit
Must be a Joe Biden supporter
They‚Äôre not switching out Biden while he‚Äôs up. Far more likely that Biden gets voted in, then they do the switch.
So we get GDP figures today. It should be a good day for Biden to blame Trump not the Chinese his handlers but Trump. It‚Äôs a pandemic Joe and you couldn‚Äôt have done anything but probably put more people in harms way. But go ahead get the hair on your legs standing up.
She just has been asking every guest ‚Äúwhat if he doesn‚Äôt leave?‚Äù And every guest has said a variation of ‚Äúafter Biden is sworn in, he‚Äôs not the president and no one has to take his orders.‚Äù William Barr can‚Äôt body block Joe from the Oval.
She'll lock up more blacks along with Biden than the both ever have before.
Just Biden... no need for anyone else.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will make excellent use of the newly modernized West Wing!
I'm not buying this... Biden won't run for a second term so the VP is the de facto 2024 candidate. You're gaslighting.
I thought about that, but they like to have American fighter jets. Biden makes one call and he‚Äôs in a diplomatic bag, on a plane to Guantanamo.
If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn‚Äôt win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.
Biden visibly a sick fellow wake up voters
Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll stay on the job after he loses. I think he‚Äôll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
The best reason for third party simps to go vote for Biden this year: you think he'll be strong enough for a second term? Let him be marginally better than Trump for 4 years. Then you primary his then 82 year old ass with a real progressive.
Biden loses with Harris. No brainer.
Then Trump said he is rolling back certain fair housing standards and I decided, even if I have to stand in line, I‚Äôll vote for Biden. (2/2)
Ok, ok. I was pretty adamant that I wasn‚Äôt going to vote for Biden. Then Trump has protesters forcibly removed in DC and I was like, ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll vote for Biden.‚Äù Then Trump sent federal troops to my home town and I was like, ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll vote absentee.‚Äù (1/2)
The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.

#97Days Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
Yes- that‚Äôs where the OP started. Our conversation started about whether or not she‚Äôs been a good senator. Anyway- this is a pointless discussion because again, it‚Äôs not being made in good faith. Vote Biden regardless üëçüèª
I really dislike Biden‚Äôs substanceless campaign. Every corporate Dem should be thanking God that Trump is so incompetent.  What does build back better even mean? You talkin bout our D grade infrastructure? Our stagnant wages? Our student loan crisis? WHAT?!
Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
But my initial read as Biden‚Äôs campaign being cutesy with the VP slot seems inaccurate; it looks like the campaign is dealing with a revolt from loud backers, which has spilled into the press. So I guess we‚Äôre playing our part.
Vote Trump anyway!  Do you honestly believe Biden has any reasoning left?
Biden when this is all over remember who made u the most power man in the world !!!
Exactly. Voters don‚Äôt care. That‚Äôs why flogging the veepstakes is a dead horse spectacle. But it sounds like there is real dissent in the ranks, and it is not Biden waffling. That‚Äôs why we have to be vocal. Sorry for all the tweets. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The Racist is Really showing his True Color.   Don't Worry  President Biden will change it Back.
So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it‚Äôs not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn‚Äôt want to hear.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"
Looks like it's going to be Kamala Harris more and more. I think Obama and Hillary are pushing for her behind the scenes.

I am not sure if investors release that a Biden administration would have people's health as a top priority and while big pharma might not be their favorite constituency, there is no real reason to fear a Biden win.

I'm begging Biden to make Kamala Harris his VP. I might die laughing
Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to fix the wage gap black women face is very good.
Biden is an ordinary professional politician, and Donald Trump's Presidency has seemed to last so long that his ordinariness seems exotic.
It quotes Biden.
I can see Biden/Ocasio
Stuart I was living in England for the Kinnock/ Major election and remember the front page of the Sun. Kinnock‚Äôs head in a light bulb with the headline. Will the last person out please turn off the light. It‚Äôs fitting here if Biden wins. God help us.
It‚Äôs a deliberate leak (reveal) as a trial balloon. Trying to judge the reaction for having a VP who is a descendant of slave owners and an aggressive prosecutor of minorities using the Crime Bill written by Biden. Joes handlers don‚Äôt do anything with a poll.
A Biden/ Harris ticket is a disaster waiting to happen. Both with anger issues and a history of passing and enforcing laws against minorities. How can you vote for a ticket with a defendant of slave owners on it?
So Jellyfish Joe Biden may have slipped up and it‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs picking a VP who is a descendant of slave owners, one who prosecuted Biden‚Äôs Crime Bill aggressively and jailed thousands of minorities for offenses she herself admits to doing as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris
If I was Joe Biden...(Who I am not) I would not pick Kamala Harris...I‚Äôd pick Barbara Lee from California who voted against Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Invasion or Nina Turner...Since he said woman of color....
Get your head around this! Biden‚Äôs clueless!
Newsmax has commercials all over tv saying text should you would but for Trump(smiling) or Biden(grainy pic). Says ‚Äúmake your voice heard‚Äù. They‚Äôre very right winged supporter of Trump, makes Fox News look centrist. &amp; they get your phone number if you text them!!
Also worth noting that, according to Economist/YouGov polling, the % of Biden voters who think an African American should be selected to be his VP had dropped 12 percentage points in just the last three weeks‚Äîfrom 58% at the end of June to 46% last week.
911? Police?  What does that have to do with Biden and segregation and busing? You're borderline incoherent, and that makes you a waste of time. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to put the real info into this thread (which you couldn't respond logically to.)
Biden loves the cops crushing people as much as anyone. They all love it.
Admittedly unlikely now, but keep coming back to the one possible VP with whom Joe is most simpatico; who checks off the boxes he values.  So, I‚Äôd be remiss not to float my Everlasting Gobstopper theory‚Äîthat Biden‚Äôs heir apparent could be the woman who returned hers‚ÄîAmy Klobuchar
üëè#blacknotDemocrat! I don‚Äôt like Biden..
Brother, I will never judge what side of the political spectrum you fall in line with, but defending that racist dimwit, who clearly can‚Äôt speak a full sentence is laughable. Biden has 40 yrs of complete and utter racist policies and now has lost his mind. This ain‚Äôt about Trump

Please you‚Äôre the party of corruption led by the likes of Clinton and Biden and their family slush (initiatives) funds.
And it increasingly seems like  only strategy to keep excitement is to prolong the VP announcement, when it‚Äôs plainly been causing more dischord than active speculation. Which makes Biden look weak, indecisive, uncaring about the shit posts his VP noms get continually.
Biden pretending he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt know who his VP choice is already is like Logic pretending he‚Äôs really retiring. Do you understand my exasperation?
I voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and now with everything he‚Äôs done good or bad and after watching Joe Biden answer questions I‚Äôm sure he read a week ago so peoples he is working for can answer for him. I know me and mine will be voting for President Trump! Thank God for him.

AG Barr, when has  asked for the violence and attacks to stop! Instead of saying ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù, he could speak to the protestors. Fcking stupid statement to make of Biden without the same for the POS in Chief!
Lol conservatives are liking and retweeting my last tweet without reading my profile. I also don‚Äôt like Barr either. I wish he would resign. But I think there‚Äôs bigger fish to fry than this hearing like electing Biden.
I hope Biden chooses Elizabeth Warren who will be tough on corporations and the pharmaceutical companies.
People vote for who they think will do the best for the job. An employer hires likewise, the candidate with the best credentials. Trump has proven his. What has Biden proved. Predator, liar, actual quid pro quo actor, dementia, womanizer and coward.
So, since there are about 100 days before the election and we have to choose between Biden and Trump, what do you suggest we do??? ü§î
Is this Biden??
Ana,  Wants to stop riots. Biden calls them protests and Adler says those people do not exist.
If one of them points a finger at Obama and Biden, then what?

I hope that between now and the beginning of August Biden's senile dementia has not progressed and that he says that he will be the vice-president of so-and-so, because every day he looks more disoriented and the radical Communist Democrats say nothing about it.
Democrat Biden says he will name running mate in first week of August
Biden giving a speech right now in Wilmington, Delaware. He said, "Crimate clisis." Going to have a very entertaining political campaign (both sides) this cycle.
This is literally the result of a Trump presidency.   If Biden doesn't win and this keeps up, what are the shit for brain Republicans gonna say then?
I love how GOP reps are crying that there was no congressional oversight over the Obama Biden administration with the doj. What were the 16 investigations of Hillary Clinton and Benghazi with no indictments????? needs to shut up.. he's going down with Trump

Lol conservatives are liking and retweeting my last tweet without reading my profile. I also don‚Äôt like Barr either. I wish he would resign. But I think there‚Äôs bigger fish to fry than this hearing like electing Biden.
People vote for who they think will do the best for the job. An employer hires likewise, the candidate with the best credentials. Trump has proven his. What has Biden proved. Predator, liar, actual quid pro quo actor, dementia, womanizer and coward.

Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll stay on the job after he loses. I think he‚Äôll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
I don‚Äôt know for the same reason the dems and Biden never trash China

Then Trump said he is rolling back certain fair housing standards and I decided, even if I have to stand in line, I‚Äôll vote for Biden. (2/2)

The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.

Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
But my initial read as Biden‚Äôs campaign being cutesy with the VP slot seems inaccurate; it looks like the campaign is dealing with a revolt from loud backers, which has spilled into the press. So I guess we‚Äôre playing our part.
Vote Trump anyway!  Do you honestly believe Biden has any reasoning left?
Biden when this is all over remember who made u the most power man in the world !!!
Exactly. Voters don‚Äôt care. That‚Äôs why flogging the veepstakes is a dead horse spectacle. But it sounds like there is real dissent in the ranks, and it is not Biden waffling. That‚Äôs why we have to be vocal. Sorry for all the tweets. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The Racist is Really showing his True Color.   Don't Worry  President Biden will change it Back.
So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it‚Äôs not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn‚Äôt want to hear.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"
Looks like it's going to be Kamala Harris more and more. I think Obama and Hillary are pushing for her behind the scenes.
I‚Äôve got news for you, Joe: you have just been added to Joe Biden‚Äôs VP shortlist! üëçüòÉ

If your family worked so hard to be able to afford a middle class home wouldn‚Äôt you be pissed if someone moving in next to you doesn‚Äôt have to pay at all? This is what you want from Biden though. Btw, keep calling black/brown people ‚Äúlow income‚Äù when in reality it‚Äôs all races.
I am not sure if investors release that a Biden administration would have people's health as a top priority and while big pharma might not be their favorite constituency, there is no real reason to fear a Biden win.
Because unlike Kamala, Susan Rice will not mention Joe Biden's voting record

I'm begging Biden to make Kamala Harris his VP. I might die laughing
Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to fix the wage gap black women face is very good.
Biden is an ordinary professional politician, and Donald Trump's Presidency has seemed to last so long that his ordinariness seems exotic.
It quotes Biden.
I can see Biden/Ocasio
Stuart I was living in England for the Kinnock/ Major election and remember the front page of the Sun. Kinnock‚Äôs head in a light bulb with the headline. Will the last person out please turn off the light. It‚Äôs fitting here if Biden wins. God help us.
It‚Äôs a deliberate leak (reveal) as a trial balloon. Trying to judge the reaction for having a VP who is a descendant of slave owners and an aggressive prosecutor of minorities using the Crime Bill written by Biden. Joes handlers don‚Äôt do anything with a poll.
‚ÄòBiden/Harris 2020?‚Äô A snapshot of  note pad shows Senator  name with notes &amp; talking points about her. Lots of speculation she‚Äôll be on the democratic ticket. Biden says he‚Äôll announce his running mate choice next week.
Why does the MSM are not asking for Joe Biden to be more public and present the DNC platform? Why is he hiding? Oh by the way, he's a racist. Listen to his past speeches for proof.
A Biden/ Harris ticket is a disaster waiting to happen. Both with anger issues and a history of passing and enforcing laws against minorities. How can you vote for a ticket with a defendant of slave owners on it?
So Jellyfish Joe Biden may have slipped up and it‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs picking a VP who is a descendant of slave owners, one who prosecuted Biden‚Äôs Crime Bill aggressively and jailed thousands of minorities for offenses she herself admits to doing as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris
If I was Joe Biden...(Who I am not) I would not pick Kamala Harris...I‚Äôd pick Barbara Lee from California who voted against Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Invasion or Nina Turner...Since he said woman of color....
Get your head around this! Biden‚Äôs clueless!
Newsmax has commercials all over tv saying text should you would but for Trump(smiling) or Biden(grainy pic). Says ‚Äúmake your voice heard‚Äù. They‚Äôre very right winged supporter of Trump, makes Fox News look centrist. &amp; they get your phone number if you text them!!
Also worth noting that, according to Economist/YouGov polling, the % of Biden voters who think an African American should be selected to be his VP had dropped 12 percentage points in just the last three weeks‚Äîfrom 58% at the end of June to 46% last week.
911? Police?  What does that have to do with Biden and segregation and busing? You're borderline incoherent, and that makes you a waste of time. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to put the real info into this thread (which you couldn't respond logically to.)
Biden loves the cops crushing people as much as anyone. They all love it.
Admittedly unlikely now, but keep coming back to the one possible VP with whom Joe is most simpatico; who checks off the boxes he values.  So, I‚Äôd be remiss not to float my Everlasting Gobstopper theory‚Äîthat Biden‚Äôs heir apparent could be the woman who returned hers‚ÄîAmy Klobuchar
Landslide for Biden, Trump will be forced to leave like a child who won‚Äôt go to bed!
üëè#blacknotDemocrat! I don‚Äôt like Biden..
Brother, I will never judge what side of the political spectrum you fall in line with, but defending that racist dimwit, who clearly can‚Äôt speak a full sentence is laughable. Biden has 40 yrs of complete and utter racist policies and now has lost his mind. This ain‚Äôt about Trump

Two choices in 2020. Trump v Biden. That's what we got. If you're anti Biden, then you're pro Trump. It's plain as that.
We control the entire govt Biden gonna have to sign whatever we put on his desk. Or we gonna be in the streets.
I hope that between now and the beginning of August Biden's senile dementia has not progressed and that he says that he will be the vice-president of so-and-so, because every day he looks more disoriented and the radical Communist Democrats say nothing about it.
Democrat Biden says he will name running mate in first week of August
And if you don't believe that, critically investigate Barrack Obama's record. He didn't embarrass us on Twitter everyday but he expanded the Patriot Act and killed thousands of people in drone warfare. Now the Dems want me to vote for Biden, a integral part of that admin. Ha

You mean it is NOT OKAY to question the illegal activities of BIDEN and his abuse of power?  What is wrong with people in here?  I am GLAD he asked these questions. I don't want that pedo rat Biden in the White House.
Please you‚Äôre the party of corruption led by the likes of Clinton and Biden and their family slush (initiatives) funds.
And it increasingly seems like  only strategy to keep excitement is to prolong the VP announcement, when it‚Äôs plainly been causing more dischord than active speculation. Which makes Biden look weak, indecisive, uncaring about the shit posts his VP noms get continually.
Biden pretending he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt know who his VP choice is already is like Logic pretending he‚Äôs really retiring. Do you understand my exasperation?
I voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and now with everything he‚Äôs done good or bad and after watching Joe Biden answer questions I‚Äôm sure he read a week ago so peoples he is working for can answer for him. I know me and mine will be voting for President Trump! Thank God for him.

Biden giving a speech right now in Wilmington, Delaware. He said, "Crimate clisis." Going to have a very entertaining political campaign (both sides) this cycle.
This is literally the result of a Trump presidency.   If Biden doesn't win and this keeps up, what are the shit for brain Republicans gonna say then?
ignorant response. You‚Äôve missed the point totally. I suppose you also don‚Äôt think there should be an even playing field for African-Americans? Women need an equal playing field in the realm of power. It‚Äôs people like you who are keeping that from happening. Bravo Joe Biden!
I love how GOP reps are crying that there was no congressional oversight over the Obama Biden administration with the doj. What were the 16 investigations of Hillary Clinton and Benghazi with no indictments????? needs to shut up.. he's going down with Trump
Let Biden go between the buildings and ANTIFA.
AG Barr, when has  asked for the violence and attacks to stop! Instead of saying ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù, he could speak to the protestors. Fcking stupid statement to make of Biden without the same for the POS in Chief!
Lol conservatives are liking and retweeting my last tweet without reading my profile. I also don‚Äôt like Barr either. I wish he would resign. But I think there‚Äôs bigger fish to fry than this hearing like electing Biden.
I hope Biden chooses Elizabeth Warren who will be tough on corporations and the pharmaceutical companies.
People vote for who they think will do the best for the job. An employer hires likewise, the candidate with the best credentials. Trump has proven his. What has Biden proved. Predator, liar, actual quid pro quo actor, dementia, womanizer and coward.
So, since there are about 100 days before the election and we have to choose between Biden and Trump, what do you suggest we do??? ü§î
Is this Biden??
Barr is on Capitol Hill. I'm surprised he showed. He's there to lie and disrespect Congress.   President Biden's (üôèüôèüôè) AG can bring charges.  House subpoenas will mean something.
Ana,  Wants to stop riots. Biden calls them protests and Adler says those people do not exist.
Sure.  Most countries stopped it ?  And you think Biden will make it better.  The Lincoln Project is ALL ANGER
If one of them points a finger at Obama and Biden, then what?
If Biden wins (üôèüôèüôè) it will be 1st female VP.
Anarchists love destrucion , they are our enemies and are frequently supported by the far left communists in the Congress and Senate. The puppet Biden without leadership will lead America  to chaos and division. President Trump is the only one prepared for stop them.
I will be surprised if Barr shows up.   If he does he will be disrespectful and dishonest.   President Biden's AG can get Barr for Lying to Congress if that's the case.

Biden should start every debate with this line.
You have to be a fair and thinking Liberal to decide Voting for Trump. Biden political platform is not his at all. He is not &amp; has never been that extremist liberal. Never! His Platform has been dictated to him by Sanders, AOC, Warren. He is now the Puppet from the Far Dem Left.
No epidemic, no President Biden ‚ÄúPuppet‚Äù!
A far better question is will the NYT fire it‚Äôs editorial staff and option writers if Joe Biden looses too? They should consider doing that!
I feel like most people whenever her name is mentioned gets happy. I know I do. Im voting for Biden anyway but I‚Äôd be happier with Rice on the ticket!
The idea is that Biden gets the "25th," allowing his VP to come in, unelected, as President.  But yeah, very likely wouldn't be a socialist president and would be an establishment candidate.
Why hasn‚Äôt Biden announced his VP pick yet?

If you all thought this was about supporting Joe Biden and not saying a peep, I have news for you.
Biden thought the veepstakes were free press for him, he didn‚Äôt care about all the attacks on Democratic women he‚Äôs been enabling by his waffling.
If Biden doesn‚Äôt know better than to not put a Senator who resigned under scandal known for sexual harassment in charge of selecting perhaps the first woman VP, what else does he not have a clue about 99 days before the election?
Yes, it‚Äôs a trash  piece, but where do they keep getting ammunition from? Biden lost control his own VP nomination process. It looks like he repeatedly floated trail balloon articles as a strategy. Then they just kept talking regardless of
Why can‚Äôt Team Biden keep its staff on the same page instead of letting them vent to Politico? This has been going since March, Biden associates complaining about Kamala challenging Biden in the first debate, it starts to look like it comes from Biden.

The Biden campaign really hasn‚Äôt had any self-inflicted fuck-ups yet, so I don‚Äôt expect them to react or even acknowledge how weak Chris Dodd made  look. They‚Äôll probably just keep tweeting empty wishes about women doing well.

At bidens last event, (internet world wide) he only got 19 viewers...  Given how many people work in Media and polictics, That's unreal.  Not even any of them give a shit what he has to say.  So bottom line: Biden is not clickbait.
It‚Äôs been airing since March as Biden made appearances with every different name that was floated.
Unfortunately, the  campaign is in fact a shit show that got this far on nostalgia and hatred of Trump. I am starting to see how Kamala would work her ass off while Biden‚Äôs buddies would just bitch to Politico about her. And Biden would just grin.
The Biden campaign‚Äôs decision to turn the VP process into a reality show has been disastrous. What would have brought the party together has been dragged out and dangled and manipulated and by now is undesirable, considering the creeps  apparently keeps as friends.

I am stupefied that the  campaign was ever connected to Chris Dodd. Firing him isn‚Äôt enough, this is seriously questionable judgement that makes me doubt who I thought Joe Biden was.
We knew this wasn‚Äôt a layup. We knew Trump didn‚Äôt really win last time. But if the  campaign is really going to abide these kinds of sexist, racist attacks on FELLOW DEMOCRATS LOYAL TO THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN...if Joe can‚Äôt lead better than that, he never had a shot.
The thing is, the  campaign has to act fast on this Chris Dodd fuckup, because this close to the election, it‚Äôs inevitable that the Black voters that got Joe Biden the nomination are expecting to be screwed over by old white men, again. Enter Chris Dodd.  act.
99 days till the campaign and  advisors shoot themselves in the foot. Classic Democrat move, let an angry failed white guy speak for the campaign.  this is 911. Chris Dodd is a bigot looking to sink the Biden campaign with his bitterness at being passed over.

Just How Far Will Joe Biden Go?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Leslie kean saw u cash in on youtube peddling garbage so shes trying to scam a quick buck too now!  I bet biden can pick the lion quicker than u Joe!I'm talking about innocent future potential deaths. not past ones. so it's ok if they die bec you want to hold Biden accountable?
Sure, but when the alternative is Donald Trump, not voting for Joe Biden is basically like breaking a leg instead of breaking a finger.  I hate it, but it's true :/
If you're willing to admit that not taking the L and voting for Biden will likely result in more harm to vulnerable communities for a shot at some benefit in the long run, that's fine, but it's intellectually dishonest to not admit that this is the case
Sure, just like Trump. Agreed. It needs to stop.  But there are some good things that Biden will do that Trump won't.  Now do you want to take the Dixie cup and drink water or do you want to dehydrate and die because you don't want to take water from a man that punched you?
Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
because that's your argument here. if we're really in a crisis (which we are), we need to get whatever the fuck we can.  trump won't do anything, and he'll actually make it worse.  biden will at least do *something*, even if it is the bare minimum.
you're honestly right tbh  i have many a criticism of joe biden but i know that he wouldn't have botched the pandemic response as badly as trump has and i know that there's at least *a few things* that will be safe guarantees under a biden administration
Yep, and you're right. We had several candidates who were objectively better than Joe Biden.   In order to change the system we live in, we've gotta start from the ground up. No use crying over spilled milk. It sucks. I hate it. I don't have confidence or faith in Joe Biden.
I'm no Joe Biden cheerleader - I'm a very, very reluctant Biden voter.  4 more years are not an option. If you think we can just flip the table and walk out and not pay for it dearly, you're mistaken. I wish you were right, but you're not, IMO.
so if Biden wins you'd more probably die more so than if Trump is elected? if Trump gets elected we're looking at decades possibly of rep POTUS's. So any possible shift to the left, def won't come to fruition with that impediment.
Biden is not my candidate. Phone bank? I fucking hate him. But logic and math identify that he's the most likely, viable, and probable candidate to defeat Trump. like you mentioned that you'll need to move. My entire life hinges on if Trump wins or loses. I can't move on my own.

Yeah. The Right is counting on the debates to change the tide. And when Biden performs well without a hint of ‚Äúdimentia‚Äù what will they do then? That will likely be the moment they know it‚Äôs over.
This is a rare time where it doesn‚Äôt matter. This election will be a referendum on Trump. Win or lose it‚Äôs coming down to that. Trump controls this election. Not Biden. It‚Äôs up to him. But some of his mistakes aren‚Äôt recoverable. Some are.

Like your wife says.....no one really cares.  As soon as Biden is in office we‚Äôre tearing down that hateful wall.
#Futures are up especially the tech heavy $QQQ off the back of strong earnings from $AAPL $AMZN $GOOG and $FB Big tech really showing the #pandemic have and have nots $GOLD amount $2000, $WTI $40. Earnings today from big oil and pharma. #Biden announce VP choice, virus looming.
is there no end to those you‚Äôd shame?  Doubt Biden, Pelosi, Schiff, Schumer know Twitch.  Also doubt you, Omar, Tlaib, Presley know the Constitution. Just a little more context...
Barack Obama and Joe Biden they have been Traitors to the American people for 8 years and people still believe that they did a great job.Trump is the only President in my opinion that's been doing a great job no matter what the globalist the lefties and the Democrats throw at him
wtf? when have I ever implied that  bullshit that you're talkin about?  all I'm saying is that the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know. and what we do know is that  it'll probably be better under Biden. want we don't know is how bad that could get under Trump.
but would it be less under Biden vs. Trump?
that may be, but at least Biden has his reasons to uphold the ACA (as sucky as it is), instead of trying to continuously defund it. in the middle of a pandemic. what viable alternative to him is there? in November somebody will be elected. do you want it to be Trump?
if you look at my comment history, I absolutely call Biden f*cking shit all the time. I'm making a rational logical appeal.
I never said that. Trump will appoint different ppl than Biden. why is that hard to understand?
exactly. and Biden would't just magically appoint the same ppl.
my original point was that in order to defeat Trump, one must vote for Biden; especially in red or swing states.
when did I say Biden was a 'good' choice?
Can someone please ask Joe Biden in person if he even knows what Twitter is?
true, it is, but with the astronomical chance would you rather Trump handle it or Biden?
Biden may want to arrest you, but Trump wants you dead.
Again what would've been done? Seriously bro? I mean take the bs politics out of it......clearly we were taken advantage of, and don't forget Biden thought banning travel from China was a Xenophobe move &amp; nothing more, so clearly no one knew what to do with this shit.....
There is no chance in hell they will let Biden debate Trump. It would be a mental massacre.
on the surface maybe. like a let's look at the Supreme Court: would you rather Trump appoint 1-2 judges for a lifetime appointment or Biden?
you don't need to convince me about Medicare for all. I don't need facts and need to be convinced of it. Biden won't do it though.
the most logical way to beat Trump is to consolidate votes behind one single candidate to win. it's just a matter of fact. so if you don't want Trump to potentially handle a covid-22, then one would have to unfortunately vote for Biden to prevent that.
You sound worried. #Biden
The biggest landslide in history: Same prediction the entire MSM made in 2016 ‚Äî- how‚Äôd that work out for you. And to think, there was actually a candidate running against Trump in 2016. This year Biden doesn‚Äôt even know he‚Äôs running.
I love it, finally big mouth Biden will face Justice. &amp;  i hope they throw the book at him. I'm so glad
Like the ones he wore at the Nationals Home opener, right!.  Oh, that's right it was the mask he wasn't wearing or social distancing he didn't adhere too.  Fauci starting to sound more and more like Biden.  Can't make up his mind what's good for us. Time for retirement.
So, u want to change the date of election do u?! I'm with you 100%! I say we move it up to September 1st and Inauguration Day up to November 3rd. That sounds much better to me since no one can really go out and campaign. We know all we need to know! You're a lunatic, Biden wins!
Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins. The fastest way to become a Marxist country is to vote for Biden. #DemsAreTheEnemyWithin #DemsAreTheDomesticTerrorists #WakeUpAmerica #VoteRed2020
Setting us up for a landslide victory from Biden as well as contesting the election results. Cry baby bitch of a President isn‚Äôt he.
The only way Joe Biden will be president is at GITMO and he can make his idiot son Vice president because they will be there together until death do you part.. I'm sure they will look very pretty wearing mop wigs and lipstick for the guy's..üòò
You SERIOUSLY THINK BIDEN is the answer? Please tell me what you are smoking so I can be delusional too!üôÑ
Joe Biden is hiring somebody else to debate Donald Trump because he doesn't have the mental capability and he knows he's on his way to  Gitmo for treason and crimes against humanity, October 2020 will be a Biblical day.. they made the prison bigger to fit your treasonous friends.
Twitters are asking each other if anyone voting for you. SO many are saying no. I'm voting for Biden. Start packing.
You first Dr. Fauci.  You were caught at Nationals opener not even following your own counsel.  No social distancing and not wearing a mask.  I think Dr. Fauci has become confused liked Biden, or that he has watched Contagion once too many times.
You are a blinking idiot! Biden didn‚Äôt even know where he was, and you have the audacity to say he was coherent. You are as dumb as a rock, if you think America buys your crap!
#AreYouBetterOff now then we were four years ago, my answer is no. We‚Äôre worse than I could have ever imagined, this is why I‚Äôm amending my 2016 Trump vote by getting many people including myself to vote for Joe Biden so we can get back on the right track.
Pelosi should be Biden‚Äôs VP choice. Ticket slogan DUMB AND DUMBER
Not on my death bed would I vote for this empty VESSEL Joe Biden!                                    TRUMP 2020.                                     MAGA üá∫üá∏
Appears Judge N following Biden on the D Train.
I'm fat af, but hate Trump.... And Biden.
I understand never Biden "progressives" may have trouble trusting us former Trump supporters, but If we could break free from cult MAGA &amp; regret that our vote has put our country in the state of where it's at, then maybe listen to us voting for Biden would save our Democracy.
Hillary Clinton was right about Trump, she is right about Joe Biden, that is the tweet.
As Biden‚Äôs wife knows... Biden be Bitin
Last point, if you think Biden is the same as Trump, you are in a cult.
John Solomon: ‚ÄòJoe Biden Was the Architect‚Äô of U.S.-Funded ‚ÄòMilitary Espionage Outpost‚Äô in Russia
I believe Joe Biden has a better chance to beat Trump than Sanders. A Joe Biden presidency is a realistic pathway to progressivsim. Joe Biden's policies are a great first step for our country to move in the right direction.
Bernie Sanders co-chair: Voting for Joe Biden like eating 'half a bowl of s--t'  via  If she is part of Bidens campaign, get rid of her, fire her.  Biden is doing what he thinks is good for the country, not like Socialist Bernie.
And still learning, plus being excited to vote for Joe Biden.
I wish all of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I say...just let him keep talking!  üòè Biden's political ads are just writing themselves at this point
After Trump, no one could do much more than get the shit back to shoe level in 4 years. All we‚Äôre gonna get here is a return to status quo and protect any open supreme court seats. I don‚Äôt expect Biden to even want more than 1 term.
It‚Äôs between Biden and someone who promotes conspiracy theories and medicine which is dangerous then Biden is the clear choice.
Oh wow is this the real Biden bus?
Oh wow is this the real Biden bus?
Joe Biden = Lost soul feeding on poor peoples feelings. Not building them up, but keeping them down.
No. I‚Äôd like to see 60/35 Biden win
Thank you, Vice President Biden.  Can't wait until you're President!  RIP John Lewis.
Biden just said that Trump has to have a plan for distributing the vaccine when it comes out and needs to put someone in charge of the effort.  I guess General Perna is surprised.
If Biden starts changing his tune and starts promoting Medicare for all as a policy he‚Äôll lose and lose hard. I understand there‚Äôs some people who won‚Äôt vote for him because he won‚Äôt. Who you gonna vote for? Trump? Is he gonna give you Medicare for all?
My only thing is, I feel like our best way forward in the short term is honestly with the American left.  I don't want to support Biden too hard or we'll lose credibility.
I‚Äôm scrolling through YouTube and  new video pops up and I‚Äôm sorry to say I haven‚Äôt watched it yet because I‚Äôm still laughing way harder than I should be at the pun in the title and fact that he photoshopped Trump and Biden onto ‚Äò80s era Formula 1 cars
Biden supporters ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Joe Biden for President is the ultimate proof that Democrats want America to fail.
If Biden is a fascist, Donald Trump is Hitler reincarnate.  The choices are fucking awful. I know. I hate it. But one does more harm than the other, and it ain't Joe Biden.
And no, I won't "forget how awful Joe Biden is". He reminds me of his mediocrity every time he opens his mouth and every time he refuses to concede anything to the American left.  I'm not just going to develop amnesia and forget the times he let us down during the primary.
i'm no Biden cheerleader, he's consistently disappointed me at every step along the way to the nomination. But at least with Joe in office we can be sure that *some* things we've achieved will stay in place, i.e. gay rights, planned parenthood, basic environmental protections
the choice is between center-right bullshit or fascism-lite  that's the reality  i know i'm choosing to keep the harm to a minimum.  as much has been made of Joe Biden's unwillingness to reach out to the American left, he still shares far more values with us than Trump ever will
I get it bro, you have a different of opinion, I respect that, but don't sleep on Trump.....there will be a few more surprises before November......but it's Biden to lose.....if he does lose, it's bc he's been hiding and reading a teleprompter, that's only going to go so far
Yup.  Instead of actually doing something . He‚Äôs going to lose to the main character from Weekend At Bernie‚Äôs lol.... great job by Biden‚Äôs advisors
Does any seriously believe that Biden has the nick nacks to debate Trump?
Life is too short for this drama, I've been unfollowed and blocked by MAGA and Resisters, who cares?
I don't blame Chloe, your friend blocked me because he thinks I unfollowed him.
It's funny, I usually don't have a conversation in these threads except saying thank you, and the one time I do wow.
Thank you.
Only time I would go off or block a person if my kids were brought into this. I will make sure that person will get suspended, that's happened to a few MAGA accounts already, but I am very laid back until that line is crossed.
You are good.
If he had responded politely, I would have followed him. Honestly I don't even believe I followed him previously.
Thank you Nancy.
I don't even know who you are, obviously you weren't kidding and quite frankly I don't have time for drama.
Chloe was just fine, apparently someone had a problem that I didn't follow them.
Thank you Chloe, how's everyone doing that's tagged on this list?
Does Joe Biden prefer tea over coffee?
Biden shut down testing in 2009 during swine flu and his   top advisor acknowledged  didn't do "anything right" to combat that pandemic!  How about some interviews  #trumplandslide2020
Geneva County Alabama and Melbourne Florida. My goal is to get 10 votes for Biden and keep those around me safe from virus.
I can agree with that, it's not a one way or the highway mentality.     I think that is what pissed me off about Biden, to say "you ain't black if you don't vote for him".....  You got a choice either way, but to be that balantant about it is ridiculous imo.
Don‚Äôt get complacent, vote for Biden.
If I, a former Trump supporter can see that Biden is the clear choice in this election, so should the never Biden progressives. I will not take holding grudges as an excuse. Thank you for coming to my #TedTalk.
Difference between Trump and Biden, Trump rants all day in his tweets, Biden is coming up with plans to fix our country.
Trump is losing support everyday. Former Trump supporters &amp; Dems  who say they will vote for Biden should be lifted up. The choice is clear, Biden is a pathway to progressivsm &amp; positive change, Trump is a pathway to tyranny. If you can't see that then you're part of the problem.
Honestly, I don't think we need the never Biden people. If they want to sit this one out that's on them. Quite frankly my opinion as an American, if you want your voice heard you vote. Sitting an election out, I will not give you the time of day.
you forget that Biden will not serve 2 terms
Where is Joe Biden?  Why can't he take questions from reporters? Why are they hiding him???
Nothing pisses me off like these stupid trump ads that say Joe Biden is defunding the police
Except he didn't wreck the economy, he didn't "lose control" of a deadly epidemic and he didn't get caught extorting a foreign government. Biden was named in a Ukrainian criminal investigation for corruption and bribery, however.
Biden: foreign policy=Quid pro quo, how low can I go? I‚Äôll be kind to you if you be kind to Hunter.  What a joke! #defundnpr
Biden: *suggests picking a literal Republican for VP*  mainstream Dems: *crickets*  rando on Twitter: "hey, Tulsi should be Biden's VP pick, IMO."  mainstream Dems: "UGH NO SHE'S JUST A REPUBLICAN IN DISGUISE"
His intimidation is only noise and that‚Äôs why one of many reasons Joe Biden will bear Trump. The American people are sick and tired of the bullying from him and MAGA.
Literally shows Trump's America &amp; calls it Biden's America. Well to be fair it will probably take a little time to clean up after you. At least 6 years if you manage to spark a violent revolution.
Damn right I'll be up for as long as it takes to name Biden our new &amp; deserving president!
I had the honor to be interviewed by a Brazilian News outlet named  &amp; share my story of how I became a former Trump supporter &amp; now a Biden supporter. We also now know how to say former Trump supporter in Portuguese. ‚Äúex-apoiador de Trump.‚Äù
They were making a statement about themselves and of their ilk, not Joe Biden. I bet a certain leader would call them "very fine people" and "patriots". I guess their MAGA masks were dirty. #GOVOTE #GTFOH #weneedgrownups

I live in Melbourne there are quite a few beachside. But starting to see a lot more Biden. Been seeing a lot of these
It seems to me joe Biden is a puppet for the Democratic Party. He has been quoted by himself that he‚Äôs racist and he‚Äôs a prolific liar. 100 days till you lose the election
Biden is as useless as tits on a bull....ü§îactually he‚Äôs worse
I can't believe that you used this picture as part of your campaign advertisement. So, if you are voted in we will have four more years of this?! Screw that, I'm riding with Biden!
I'm voting for  because he has a pandemic playbook, will expand ACA. Joe Biden cares about the rule of law, the Constitution, Military &amp; Veterans. I no longer believe &amp; trust right wing propaganda, &amp; I now know who Trump is &amp; won't be fooled again.#ResistanceTaskForce
No doubt, it is what Trump wants. Biden can use it too, though. It's "Trump's America." "Never Trumpers" will probably use it by the end of the day. Too risky as a campaign choice, but it's a criminal act that no one but the perpetrator can control, anyway.
I'm voting for Joe Biden, because he is a caring, compassionate man and actually cares about our country and the people.  He is smart and can get us out of this mess.
For the 1,000th time, Joe Biden does not want to defend the police. Trump and his ads are, as is his brand, LYING to America!
Everyone PLEASE  read the truth and listen to Biden, he is not and will not DEFUND the police.  Trump is LYING and trying to cause chaos.  We need to vote blue all the way come November to get our country back on track.

Biden, Warren aides say the two talk about every 10 days  I think Warren would do better doing as economic advisor because she gets things done..something in consumer advocacy.  Condelisa Rice Secretary of State or Vice President.  Kamala Harris as AG.....

Biden is just as bad as Trump anyway if not worse.
Glad to see the end of these. Bring on Biden!

Biden and Obama stopped testing for H1N1 mid pandemic. These clowns have zero credibility
I know so why does the left keep supporting Biden???
Joe Biden election!
Don't lose hope, there are a lot of former Trump supporters out there I am confident Joe Biden will win.
When Joe Biden becomes President, I will be taking a month or so off from Twitter and go on vacation.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I won't stop until Biden is elected, when that happens I will go on a vacation for a month.
You,  and many others were right about him. I didn't listen in 2016 but I am listening now which is why I will be voting for Joe Biden.
I do like calling #COVID19 the Trump virus instead. It's more fitting because just think if Trump didn't toss Obama's and Biden's Pandemic playbook  aside, just think if Trump acted sooner than 70 days, just think if Trump wore a mask and encourage mask wearing sooner.
They do a lot of work for the Biden campaign, you are welcome.
Adopt all of Andrew Yangs policies &amp; he‚Äôd have my vote if he actually implemented them and was positive and would actually put humanity first. But he‚Äôs failed on that avenue on all ends. So Biden 2020 to get to Yang 2024 &amp; Yang 2028 üß¢
Why does the right continue to blame Biden for problems that‚Äôs happening under Trump‚Äôs Presidency?
You can say all you want dude now that the virus hit, you couldn't say that in January, Clinton lost for a reason dude, many independents went for Trump, he wins again hands down without this virus.....now? Biden should win by a landslide, we shall see, I don't trust the polls
I remember the day my dad paid 80% in CA. Under Brown senior and Carter as president. Biden will do worse.
What was the last live event you watch featuring Biden?
I‚Äôd like to think Biden/Rice/Harris is going to sanction Putin into a mob hit, work with Iran, and be firm with China.
i can beat Biden off
Then Biden will win by an even larger margin. No certified results in red States mean no electoral votes from those states.

hence why i will vote for Joe Biden. I will not donate. I will not volunteer. I will not tell others to do so.
I'm not allowed to have an issue with Biden's milquetoast VP picks?
Can't believe people still think this. She literally endorsed Joe Biden. Everyone said she'd run third party because she's "a Russian op." She didn't. She's not a russian op. Let it go. She just has different views.
Biden is one of the main factors for the police brutality that exists today, which is what started the BLM movements
Why'd she endorse Joe Biden, then?
None of Biden's VP picks excite me or anyone else that actually wants to see substantial societal change.  The only one that I'm not completely lukewarm or outright ice-cold towards is  She's alright.
my point is that we shouldn't just say "oh yeah, we need a woman just because she's a woman"  we should pick whoever is best for the job, and right now nobody on Biden's shortlist jumps out at me other than  perhaps.
She endorsed Joe Biden, didn't she?  Doesn't seem like a very Putin-y thing to do.
This is how you unite, thank you President Biden.
How Trump's coronavirus briefings convinced one of his voters to turn to Joe Biden  #SmartNews
If you don‚Äôt support Trump then why do you care if people are gonna vote for Biden?YOUR WHITE PRIVILEGE allows you to do that to not care enough to vote. That‚Äôs why your allowed to not care because you‚Äôll be FINE regardless. Trump is letting people get taken away in unmarked vans
Do you not realize the 4 years of tension built up is already built up? That‚Äôs not the future Matthew. NO ONE thinks Biden is gonna make things the way we want. That‚Äôs literally where this all started by saying we‚Äôre not voting for him bc we want to but HES THE LAST RESORT.
I don‚Äôt support him i NEVER said I did. And I never said there isn‚Äôt tension because of him.  I‚Äôm just saying you saying ‚Äúbut he won‚Äôt have 4 years of satanic tension built up next term‚Äù is you seeing the future. Idk why you think Biden is gonna make things the way you want
‚ÄúI‚Äôll take women who made millions singing about the poor choices in men she made, and now supports Joe Biden for 200.00, Alex‚Äù
I can‚Äôt wait to vote for Joe Biden. Pass it on.
So you admit Biden can‚Äôt fix America? üòÇ
So why are you saying anyone who votes for Biden is stupid? But your smart for not voting ? Makes sense üòÇ Voting is the only way change will come and it starts in each community into each state. We elect those who represent us. Maybe YOU should do some research on the importance
Remember when Obama, Biden gave a stimulus to American's $200.00 LOL.  While Biden's son was making himself a millionaire .
Like you gotta read the whole tweet and understand why I‚Äôm saying what I am. Not just see something and yell that the other person also has money. While he still doesn‚Äôt have half the platform the Pos Potus does. Biden hasn‚Äôt had a chance to prove himself. Trump has and he failed
Kenz you just said ‚Äúgo off about multi millionaire‚Äù referring to trump. I was referring that Biden is a multi millionaire as well. And him being in politics since the 1970s kinda suggests that the laws and bills that are in place now were passed by people like him. He‚Äôs racist af
You realize Biden is multi millionaire as well...? And has been in POLITICS FOR OVER 40 YEARS KENZIE!!!!!!!! PLEASE DO UR REASEARCH
Biden hasn‚Äôt even been able to compare to what Trump has done yet and still some how he‚Äôs still worse. Interesting
Biden has net worth of 9 million and has been in politics for 40 years. You think they care about us?? Trumps response to a lot of things isn‚Äôt the right response, again I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs the chosen one. I am saying Biden is much worse then him, you just choose not to see it.
Before corona virus America wasn‚Äôt the way it is. I‚Äôm not hyping up trump by any means but at least the man knows how to make money and get the economy going we had strongest economy in the world before corona hit. Just do your actual research on Biden before you vote for him
It blows my mind that you think I support Biden?? üòÇ
It blows my mind you support Biden Kenzie it really does ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
blows my mind people think Biden is capable of running a country, or the fact that they ignore he‚Äôs a extreme pedofile and think he‚Äôs not racist. Also voting for somebody just because you don‚Äôt want to vote for the other isn‚Äôt a good solution. Reasearch bout Biden before you vote
Cliff you were told what to do by Joe Biden....that's your "ya'll" you are referring too, it's not anyone else saying that, stay focused.
I truly believe this &amp; i also believe joe Biden will destroy our military like Obama did, Joe Biden is a  Crooked politician &amp; has proven that with his devotion to China.
You are doing what the Whiteman Biden told you to do.....so your tweet makes no sense actually, nice try.
I'm sure Biden knows what all the options are, and is smart enough not to discuss them publicly and tip his hand. I'm focusing on voter registration, mail voting, and GOTV in the meantime.
Person, man, woman, it wasn‚Äôt Biden that said that.
Biden and Obama praising each other and bashing Trump is exactly what we need these days.
Ads like these from the     and others are what needs to be on TV. Joe Biden‚Äôs ads are unifying but they‚Äôre too nice. Most Americans are not on social media. We need to fight fire with fire.
Why would Biden debate a known liar, propaganda race hating machine like Donald. He gains nothing from the debate. Donald is calling the Election rigged before we have one Why give him and open form to continue to use his propaganda to hurt America. He doe not deserve itI'm talking about innocent future potential deaths. not past ones. so it's ok if they die bec you want to hold Biden accountable?
Sure, but when the alternative is Donald Trump, not voting for Joe Biden is basically like breaking a leg instead of breaking a finger.  I hate it, but it's true :/
If you're willing to admit that not taking the L and voting for Biden will likely result in more harm to vulnerable communities for a shot at some benefit in the long run, that's fine, but it's intellectually dishonest to not admit that this is the case
Sure, just like Trump. Agreed. It needs to stop.  But there are some good things that Biden will do that Trump won't.  Now do you want to take the Dixie cup and drink water or do you want to dehydrate and die because you don't want to take water from a man that punched you?
Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
because that's your argument here. if we're really in a crisis (which we are), we need to get whatever the fuck we can.  trump won't do anything, and he'll actually make it worse.  biden will at least do *something*, even if it is the bare minimum.
you're honestly right tbh  i have many a criticism of joe biden but i know that he wouldn't have botched the pandemic response as badly as trump has and i know that there's at least *a few things* that will be safe guarantees under a biden administration
Yep, and you're right. We had several candidates who were objectively better than Joe Biden.   In order to change the system we live in, we've gotta start from the ground up. No use crying over spilled milk. It sucks. I hate it. I don't have confidence or faith in Joe Biden.
I'm no Joe Biden cheerleader - I'm a very, very reluctant Biden voter.  4 more years are not an option. If you think we can just flip the table and walk out and not pay for it dearly, you're mistaken. I wish you were right, but you're not, IMO.
so if Biden wins you'd more probably die more so than if Trump is elected? if Trump gets elected we're looking at decades possibly of rep POTUS's. So any possible shift to the left, def won't come to fruition with that impediment.
Biden is not my candidate. Phone bank? I fucking hate him. But logic and math identify that he's the most likely, viable, and probable candidate to defeat Trump. like you mentioned that you'll need to move. My entire life hinges on if Trump wins or loses. I can't move on my own.
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty  via
I'm completely frustrated with Joe Biden too, I get it. He's shown himself to be totally not receptive to what young Americans want and need to be successful.  Difference is that I'm not willing to risk further harm for a symbolic win. I'm not gonna flip the table and walk out.
I worked alongside her to help Andrew Yang in the primaries.  A Biden presidency is very much not "getting her way".
Lord and hope so and rightfully so. We just need to remehow stupid and dangerous he is and vite Biden in November.
Wear a mask. Vote by mail. And vote for Joe Biden.
Usually presidential candidates have staffers or assistants escorting them around while campaigning. Seems Biden has a nurse or maybe his ‚ÄúVisiting Angel‚Äù from home is tagging along. Regardless, he looks confused. üë©üèº‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüëºüèºüòÇ
Um ... why should Biden apologize for what allegedly "some of his allies" are telling him?
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt making any decisions
Great new top that came out a huge plus to wear to the debate oh that's right Joe Biden will never show up unless he has Bernie Sanders talks for him..One hand moisturizes the other hand that's how Biden works..üí¶üí¶üí¶üí¶üí•üí•
Karen Bass‚Äôs Long March from Communist Fringe to Biden‚Äôs VP Shortlist
Is that the new name for Joe Biden, cute.  Especially cute since Beijing is extremely friendly to US citizens, and a wonderful place.  Oh, and did I mention they make 80% of everything you touch each day.  Clean out your own house first.  Ask Jack Ma
Yeah. The Right is counting on the debates to change the tide. And when Biden performs well without a hint of ‚Äúdimentia‚Äù what will they do then? That will likely be the moment they know it‚Äôs over.
This is a rare time where it doesn‚Äôt matter. This election will be a referendum on Trump. Win or lose it‚Äôs coming down to that. Trump controls this election. Not Biden. It‚Äôs up to him. But some of his mistakes aren‚Äôt recoverable. Some are.
I just signed a  petition to  and  calling on them to include ending marijuana prohibition in their campaign platforms. Sign here:
President Joe Biden.
They heard Tara Reade‚Äôs story, no one on the left silenced her, they found inconsistencies and Biden showed transparency by alllowing his records to be released. Time to move on from this.

Like your wife says.....no one really cares.  As soon as Biden is in office we‚Äôre tearing down that hateful wall.
#Futures are up especially the tech heavy $QQQ off the back of strong earnings from $AAPL $AMZN $GOOG and $FB Big tech really showing the #pandemic have and have nots $GOLD amount $2000, $WTI $40. Earnings today from big oil and pharma. #Biden announce VP choice, virus looming.
is there no end to those you‚Äôd shame?  Doubt Biden, Pelosi, Schiff, Schumer know Twitch.  Also doubt you, Omar, Tlaib, Presley know the Constitution. Just a little more context...
Barack Obama and Joe Biden they have been Traitors to the American people for 8 years and people still believe that they did a great job.Trump is the only President in my opinion that's been doing a great job no matter what the globalist the lefties and the Democrats throw at him
wtf? when have I ever implied that  bullshit that you're talkin about?  all I'm saying is that the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know. and what we do know is that  it'll probably be better under Biden. want we don't know is how bad that could get under Trump.
but would it be less under Biden vs. Trump?
that may be, but at least Biden has his reasons to uphold the ACA (as sucky as it is), instead of trying to continuously defund it. in the middle of a pandemic. what viable alternative to him is there? in November somebody will be elected. do you want it to be Trump?
if you look at my comment history, I absolutely call Biden f*cking shit all the time. I'm making a rational logical appeal.
I never said that. Trump will appoint different ppl than Biden. why is that hard to understand?
exactly. and Biden would't just magically appoint the same ppl.
my original point was that in order to defeat Trump, one must vote for Biden; especially in red or swing states.
when did I say Biden was a 'good' choice?
Can someone please ask Joe Biden in person if he even knows what Twitter is?
true, it is, but with the astronomical chance would you rather Trump handle it or Biden?
Biden may want to arrest you, but Trump wants you dead.
Again what would've been done? Seriously bro? I mean take the bs politics out of it......clearly we were taken advantage of, and don't forget Biden thought banning travel from China was a Xenophobe move &amp; nothing more, so clearly no one knew what to do with this shit.....
There is no chance in hell they will let Biden debate Trump. It would be a mental massacre.
on the surface maybe. like a let's look at the Supreme Court: would you rather Trump appoint 1-2 judges for a lifetime appointment or Biden?
you don't need to convince me about Medicare for all. I don't need facts and need to be convinced of it. Biden won't do it though.
the most logical way to beat Trump is to consolidate votes behind one single candidate to win. it's just a matter of fact. so if you don't want Trump to potentially handle a covid-22, then one would have to unfortunately vote for Biden to prevent that.
You sound worried. #Biden
The biggest landslide in history: Same prediction the entire MSM made in 2016 ‚Äî- how‚Äôd that work out for you. And to think, there was actually a candidate running against Trump in 2016. This year Biden doesn‚Äôt even know he‚Äôs running.
I love it, finally big mouth Biden will face Justice. &amp;  i hope they throw the book at him. I'm so glad
Like the ones he wore at the Nationals Home opener, right!.  Oh, that's right it was the mask he wasn't wearing or social distancing he didn't adhere too.  Fauci starting to sound more and more like Biden.  Can't make up his mind what's good for us. Time for retirement.
So, u want to change the date of election do u?! I'm with you 100%! I say we move it up to September 1st and Inauguration Day up to November 3rd. That sounds much better to me since no one can really go out and campaign. We know all we need to know! You're a lunatic, Biden wins!
Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins. The fastest way to become a Marxist country is to vote for Biden. #DemsAreTheEnemyWithin #DemsAreTheDomesticTerrorists #WakeUpAmerica #VoteRed2020
Setting us up for a landslide victory from Biden as well as contesting the election results. Cry baby bitch of a President isn‚Äôt he.
Don‚Äôt let pride and ego stop you from making the right choice in this presidential election, vote for Joe Biden.
The only way Joe Biden will be president is at GITMO and he can make his idiot son Vice president because they will be there together until death do you part.. I'm sure they will look very pretty wearing mop wigs and lipstick for the guy's..üòò
You SERIOUSLY THINK BIDEN is the answer? Please tell me what you are smoking so I can be delusional too!üôÑ
Joe Biden is hiring somebody else to debate Donald Trump because he doesn't have the mental capability and he knows he's on his way to  Gitmo for treason and crimes against humanity, October 2020 will be a Biblical day.. they made the prison bigger to fit your treasonous friends.
Twitters are asking each other if anyone voting for you. SO many are saying no. I'm voting for Biden. Start packing.
You first Dr. Fauci.  You were caught at Nationals opener not even following your own counsel.  No social distancing and not wearing a mask.  I think Dr. Fauci has become confused liked Biden, or that he has watched Contagion once too many times.
#AreYouBetterOff now then we were four years ago, my answer is no. We‚Äôre worse than I could have ever imagined, this is why I‚Äôm amending my 2016 Trump vote by getting many people including myself to vote for Joe Biden so we can get back on the right track.
Pelosi should be Biden‚Äôs VP choice. Ticket slogan DUMB AND DUMBER
We have 150,000 dead from #COVID19 &amp; Trump is trying to manipulate the American people into thinking that mail in voting is wrong so he could prevent people from voting for Biden. He knows his supporters would be stupid enough to go to the booths during the pandemic.
Not on my death bed would I vote for this empty VESSEL Joe Biden!                                    TRUMP 2020.                                     MAGA üá∫üá∏
Let‚Äôs recap today‚Äôs Republican talking points. #LouieGohmert blames wearing a mask for catching the #coronaviru, and #LauraIngraham didn‚Äôt know Berlin was in Germany. I think Biden should win in a landslide.
Appears Judge N following Biden on the D Train.
I'm fat af, but hate Trump.... And Biden.
My point is this, learn from our mistake because a no vote is a vote for Trump who is no where near like Biden.
I understand never Biden "progressives" may have trouble trusting us former Trump supporters, but If we could break free from cult MAGA &amp; regret that our vote has put our country in the state of where it's at, then maybe listen to us voting for Biden would save our Democracy.
Hillary Clinton was right about Trump, she is right about Joe Biden, that is the tweet.
As Biden‚Äôs wife knows... Biden be Bitin
Last point, if you think Biden is the same as Trump, you are in a cult.
John Solomon: ‚ÄòJoe Biden Was the Architect‚Äô of U.S.-Funded ‚ÄòMilitary Espionage Outpost‚Äô in Russia
I believe Joe Biden has a better chance to beat Trump than Sanders. A Joe Biden presidency is a realistic pathway to progressivsim. Joe Biden's policies are a great first step for our country to move in the right direction.
Bernie Sanders co-chair: Voting for Joe Biden like eating 'half a bowl of s--t'  via  If she is part of Bidens campaign, get rid of her, fire her.  Biden is doing what he thinks is good for the country, not like Socialist Bernie.
And still learning, plus being excited to vote for Joe Biden.
I‚Äôve learned my lesson from voting for Trump, Joe Biden has my vote.
I wish all of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I say...just let him keep talking!  üòè Biden's political ads are just writing themselves at this point
After Trump, no one could do much more than get the shit back to shoe level in 4 years. All we‚Äôre gonna get here is a return to status quo and protect any open supreme court seats. I don‚Äôt expect Biden to even want more than 1 term.
It‚Äôs between Biden and someone who promotes conspiracy theories and medicine which is dangerous then Biden is the clear choice.
Oh wow is this the real Biden bus?
Oh wow is this the real Biden bus?
Joe Biden = Lost soul feeding on poor peoples feelings. Not building them up, but keeping them down.
No. I‚Äôd like to see 60/35 Biden win
Thank you, Vice President Biden.  Can't wait until you're President!  RIP John Lewis.
Biden just said that Trump has to have a plan for distributing the vaccine when it comes out and needs to put someone in charge of the effort.  I guess General Perna is surprised.
If Biden starts changing his tune and starts promoting Medicare for all as a policy he‚Äôll lose and lose hard. I understand there‚Äôs some people who won‚Äôt vote for him because he won‚Äôt. Who you gonna vote for? Trump? Is he gonna give you Medicare for all?
My only thing is, I feel like our best way forward in the short term is honestly with the American left.  I don't want to support Biden too hard or we'll lose credibility.
I‚Äôm scrolling through YouTube and  new video pops up and I‚Äôm sorry to say I haven‚Äôt watched it yet because I‚Äôm still laughing way harder than I should be at the pun in the title and fact that he photoshopped Trump and Biden onto ‚Äò80s era Formula 1 cars
Biden supporters ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Trump lied about throwing opening day pitch at Yankee stadium, he‚Äôs also lied about Obama and Biden, you have absolutely no credibility and I‚Äôm far from being the only former Trump supporter.
Only way to do that is vote for Joe Biden.
Joe Biden for President is the ultimate proof that Democrats want America to fail.
If Biden is a fascist, Donald Trump is Hitler reincarnate.  The choices are fucking awful. I know. I hate it. But one does more harm than the other, and it ain't Joe Biden.
And no, I won't "forget how awful Joe Biden is". He reminds me of his mediocrity every time he opens his mouth and every time he refuses to concede anything to the American left.  I'm not just going to develop amnesia and forget the times he let us down during the primary.
i'm no Biden cheerleader, he's consistently disappointed me at every step along the way to the nomination. But at least with Joe in office we can be sure that *some* things we've achieved will stay in place, i.e. gay rights, planned parenthood, basic environmental protections
the choice is between center-right bullshit or fascism-lite  that's the reality  i know i'm choosing to keep the harm to a minimum.  as much has been made of Joe Biden's unwillingness to reach out to the American left, he still shares far more values with us than Trump ever will
I get it bro, you have a different of opinion, I respect that, but don't sleep on Trump.....there will be a few more surprises before November......but it's Biden to lose.....if he does lose, it's bc he's been hiding and reading a teleprompter, that's only going to go so far
Yup.  Instead of actually doing something . He‚Äôs going to lose to the main character from Weekend At Bernie‚Äôs lol.... great job by Biden‚Äôs advisors
Does any seriously believe that Biden has the nick nacks to debate Trump?
Life is too short for this drama, I've been unfollowed and blocked by MAGA and Resisters, who cares?
I don't blame Chloe, your friend blocked me because he thinks I unfollowed him.
It's funny, I usually don't have a conversation in these threads except saying thank you, and the one time I do wow.
Really? Over me supposedly unfollowing him?
Thank you.
He *might* have lost a step from the Great Malarkey Debate, but mano-√°-mano against Trump is perhaps the easiest challenge Biden‚Äôs ever had
Only time I would go off or block a person if my kids were brought into this. I will make sure that person will get suspended, that's happened to a few MAGA accounts already, but I am very laid back until that line is crossed.
You are good.
If he had responded politely, I would have followed him. Honestly I don't even believe I followed him previously.
Thank you Nancy.
I don't even know who you are, obviously you weren't kidding and quite frankly I don't have time for drama.
Chloe was just fine, apparently someone had a problem that I didn't follow them.
Thank you Chloe, how's everyone doing that's tagged on this list?
Does Joe Biden prefer tea over coffee?
Biden shut down testing in 2009 during swine flu and his   top advisor acknowledged  didn't do "anything right" to combat that pandemic!  How about some interviews  #trumplandslide2020
Geneva County Alabama and Melbourne Florida. My goal is to get 10 votes for Biden and keep those around me safe from virus.
I can agree with that, it's not a one way or the highway mentality.     I think that is what pissed me off about Biden, to say "you ain't black if you don't vote for him".....  You got a choice either way, but to be that balantant about it is ridiculous imo.
Don‚Äôt get complacent, vote for Biden.
If I, a former Trump supporter can see that Biden is the clear choice in this election, so should the never Biden progressives. I will not take holding grudges as an excuse. Thank you for coming to my #TedTalk.
Difference between Trump and Biden, Trump rants all day in his tweets, Biden is coming up with plans to fix our country.
Trump is losing support everyday. Former Trump supporters &amp; Dems  who say they will vote for Biden should be lifted up. The choice is clear, Biden is a pathway to progressivsm &amp; positive change, Trump is a pathway to tyranny. If you can't see that then you're part of the problem.
Honestly, I don't think we need the never Biden people. If they want to sit this one out that's on them. Quite frankly my opinion as an American, if you want your voice heard you vote. Sitting an election out, I will not give you the time of day.
you forget that Biden will not serve 2 terms
Where is Joe Biden?  Why can't he take questions from reporters? Why are they hiding him???
Besides it being quite a while after Super Tuesday, the fact that Tulsi only endorsed Biden after having burned through all residual goodwill &amp; after months of appearing on the White Power Hour with Trucknuts Carlton‚Ä¶more evidence that most grifters just aren‚Äôt very bright
Nothing pisses me off like these stupid trump ads that say Joe Biden is defunding the police
Except he didn't wreck the economy, he didn't "lose control" of a deadly epidemic and he didn't get caught extorting a foreign government. Biden was named in a Ukrainian criminal investigation for corruption and bribery, however.
Biden: *suggests picking a literal Republican for VP*  mainstream Dems: *crickets*  rando on Twitter: "hey, Tulsi should be Biden's VP pick, IMO."  mainstream Dems: "UGH NO SHE'S JUST A REPUBLICAN IN DISGUISE"
His intimidation is only noise and that‚Äôs why one of many reasons Joe Biden will bear Trump. The American people are sick and tired of the bullying from him and MAGA.
Literally shows Trump's America &amp; calls it Biden's America. Well to be fair it will probably take a little time to clean up after you. At least 6 years if you manage to spark a violent revolution.
Damn right I'll be up for as long as it takes to name Biden our new &amp; deserving president!
I had the honor to be interviewed by a Brazilian News outlet named  &amp; share my story of how I became a former Trump supporter &amp; now a Biden supporter. We also now know how to say former Trump supporter in Portuguese. ‚Äúex-apoiador de Trump.‚Äù
They were making a statement about themselves and of their ilk, not Joe Biden. I bet a certain leader would call them "very fine people" and "patriots". I guess their MAGA masks were dirty. #GOVOTE #GTFOH #weneedgrownups

It seems to me joe Biden is a puppet for the Democratic Party. He has been quoted by himself that he‚Äôs racist and he‚Äôs a prolific liar. 100 days till you lose the election
Biden is as useless as tits on a bull....ü§îactually he‚Äôs worse
I can't believe that you used this picture as part of your campaign advertisement. So, if you are voted in we will have four more years of this?! Screw that, I'm riding with Biden!
I'm voting for  because he has a pandemic playbook, will expand ACA. Joe Biden cares about the rule of law, the Constitution, Military &amp; Veterans. I no longer believe &amp; trust right wing propaganda, &amp; I now know who Trump is &amp; won't be fooled again.#ResistanceTaskForce
No doubt, it is what Trump wants. Biden can use it too, though. It's "Trump's America." "Never Trumpers" will probably use it by the end of the day. Too risky as a campaign choice, but it's a criminal act that no one but the perpetrator can control, anyway.
I'm voting for Joe Biden, because he is a caring, compassionate man and actually cares about our country and the people.  He is smart and can get us out of this mess.
For the 1,000th time, Joe Biden does not want to defend the police. Trump and his ads are, as is his brand, LYING to America!
Everyone PLEASE  read the truth and listen to Biden, he is not and will not DEFUND the police.  Trump is LYING and trying to cause chaos.  We need to vote blue all the way come November to get our country back on track.

Don't lose hope, there are a lot of former Trump supporters out there I am confident Joe Biden will win.
When Joe Biden becomes President, I will be taking a month or so off from Twitter and go on vacation.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I won't stop until Biden is elected, when that happens I will go on a vacation for a month.
You,  and many others were right about him. I didn't listen in 2016 but I am listening now which is why I will be voting for Joe Biden.
I do like calling #COVID19 the Trump virus instead. It's more fitting because just think if Trump didn't toss Obama's and Biden's Pandemic playbook  aside, just think if Trump acted sooner than 70 days, just think if Trump wore a mask and encourage mask wearing sooner.
They do a lot of work for the Biden campaign, you are welcome.

I remember the day my dad paid 80% in CA. Under Brown senior and Carter as president. Biden will do worse.
What was the last live event you watch featuring Biden?
I‚Äôd like to think Biden/Rice/Harris is going to sanction Putin into a mob hit, work with Iran, and be firm with China.
i can beat Biden off
Then Biden will win by an even larger margin. No certified results in red States mean no electoral votes from those states.

I'm not allowed to have an issue with Biden's milquetoast VP picks?
Can't believe people still think this. She literally endorsed Joe Biden. Everyone said she'd run third party because she's "a Russian op." She didn't. She's not a russian op. Let it go. She just has different views.
Biden is one of the main factors for the police brutality that exists today, which is what started the BLM movements
Why'd she endorse Joe Biden, then?
None of Biden's VP picks excite me or anyone else that actually wants to see substantial societal change.  The only one that I'm not completely lukewarm or outright ice-cold towards is  She's alright.
my point is that we shouldn't just say "oh yeah, we need a woman just because she's a woman"  we should pick whoever is best for the job, and right now nobody on Biden's shortlist jumps out at me other than  perhaps.
She endorsed Joe Biden, didn't she?  Doesn't seem like a very Putin-y thing to do.
This is how you unite, thank you President Biden.

If you don‚Äôt support Trump then why do you care if people are gonna vote for Biden?YOUR WHITE PRIVILEGE allows you to do that to not care enough to vote. That‚Äôs why your allowed to not care because you‚Äôll be FINE regardless. Trump is letting people get taken away in unmarked vans
Do you not realize the 4 years of tension built up is already built up? That‚Äôs not the future Matthew. NO ONE thinks Biden is gonna make things the way we want. That‚Äôs literally where this all started by saying we‚Äôre not voting for him bc we want to but HES THE LAST RESORT.
I don‚Äôt support him i NEVER said I did. And I never said there isn‚Äôt tension because of him.  I‚Äôm just saying you saying ‚Äúbut he won‚Äôt have 4 years of satanic tension built up next term‚Äù is you seeing the future. Idk why you think Biden is gonna make things the way you want

Kenz you just said ‚Äúgo off about multi millionaire‚Äù referring to trump. I was referring that Biden is a multi millionaire as well. And him being in politics since the 1970s kinda suggests that the laws and bills that are in place now were passed by people like him. He‚Äôs racist af

Biden has net worth of 9 million and has been in politics for 40 years. You think they care about us?? Trumps response to a lot of things isn‚Äôt the right response, again I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs the chosen one. I am saying Biden is much worse then him, you just choose not to see it.
Before corona virus America wasn‚Äôt the way it is. I‚Äôm not hyping up trump by any means but at least the man knows how to make money and get the economy going we had strongest economy in the world before corona hit. Just do your actual research on Biden before you vote for him
It blows my mind that you think I support Biden?? üòÇ
It blows my mind you support Biden Kenzie it really does ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
blows my mind people think Biden is capable of running a country, or the fact that they ignore he‚Äôs a extreme pedofile and think he‚Äôs not racist. Also voting for somebody just because you don‚Äôt want to vote for the other isn‚Äôt a good solution. Reasearch bout Biden before you vote
Cliff you were told what to do by Joe Biden....that's your "ya'll" you are referring too, it's not anyone else saying that, stay focused.
I truly believe this &amp; i also believe joe Biden will destroy our military like Obama did, Joe Biden is a  Crooked politician &amp; has proven that with his devotion to China.
You are doing what the Whiteman Biden told you to do.....so your tweet makes no sense actually, nice try.
I'm sure Biden knows what all the options are, and is smart enough not to discuss them publicly and tip his hand. I'm focusing on voter registration, mail voting, and GOTV in the meantime.
Person, man, woman, it wasn‚Äôt Biden that said that.
Biden and Obama praising each other and bashing Trump is exactly what we need these days.
Ads like these from the     and others are what needs to be on TV. Joe Biden‚Äôs ads are unifying but they‚Äôre too nice. Most Americans are not on social media. We need to fight fire with fire.
Why would Biden debate a known liar, propaganda race hating machine like Donald. He gains nothing from the debate. Donald is calling the Election rigged before we have one Why give him and open form to continue to use his propaganda to hurt America. He doe not deserve it
Civil rights attorney blasts Biden for 'insulting' African Americans: 'I'm Black and I'm not voting for him'    Explore the Fox News apps that are right for you at
I would rather see the debates when President Trump will destroy Biden.
This is why I am voting for Joe Biden.
The voices in Biden‚Äôs head told him to tweet this.
Ignore the polls and go vote for Biden.
It was so random! Especially because it came wedged between mailings from Biden‚Äôs campaign and
I have actually seen many Biden signs...... But all of these are signs that he is mentally incompetent.
Biden calls black kids roaches
Oh that blue wave where you lost some Senate seats? Sorry mid terms always go the same way, look how many historic levels of seats Obama/Biden lost in their mid-terms, we didn't call it anything lol......Incumbents always do terrible in the mid-terms, those are facts too
To you, yes it seems all about race every four years, the Democratic Party stirs up the race every four years to remind the Black Voter where there vote should go, as Biden so eloquently said that you weren't Black if you didn't support him for President....
On the space coast of Florida and I've yet to see one sign,sticker,hat or tshirt backing biden!!! Gotta bunch of trump flags flying throughout my area though!!!#Trump2020 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Who is "y'all"...if you are referring to Biden? Then yes he specifically told you that your not black if you don't vote for him.......those are facts, I do agree it makes no sense he would say such a racist thing, but he did......
There are suppose to be zero remember? You were specifically told you were not black if you don't support Biden.......there are some Black Americans I know can think for themselves and don't have to do as they are told
Barack Obama &amp; Joe Biden Discuss Trump, Coronavirus, &amp; Racial Justice,
It's up from 2016, Trump wasn't on the ballot in 2018, he won in 2016 on that number &amp; its improved now in 2020; but Biden has it in the bag, he will win with a landslide victory...so you got nothing to worry about, Hillary had it in the bag too with those polls numbers too üòâ

Ignore polls, wear a mask and vote for Joe Biden, that‚Äôs the tweet.
every single candidate you have supported has lost. Thank you for supporting Biden!
she has made a living writing songs about her poor choices regarding men. And shes picking Biden.
nobody with sense would admit they support Trump. next thing you know youre facing a mob of idiots. Easier to say you support Biden
Does Biden need to get a restraining order against you?  You're very stalkery like...you have an unhealthy obsession
#ImVoting4BidenBecause even if I'm lukewarm about Biden, I feel he will honestly try to pull back from the brink &amp; possibly back towards the right general direction. That and the alternative is a total piece of  totalitarian garbage.
Trump Gains Among Black Voters, Biden Trails Hillary in 2016
Now Biden is doing the samething, avoiding press conferences, shuffles up to the teleprompter reads it and shuffles away from it without taking any tough questions......I am not sure how this is going to work out for him, I guess we will just have to wait and see.
I said it was interesting.....I am sure Biden is going to win hands down, you got nothing to worry about.....I am sure you were on Twitter in 2016 like I was, I remember how much Trump was getting destroyed at this point, I remember HRC not doing press conferences....
Because Joe Biden can‚Äôt brag about a test he can‚Äôt pass, Hillary.
Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt care if Biden was embalmed. He still gets my vote.
To be clear he's not getting more black votes then Biden, it was saying Clinton had a better lead with Black Voters at this point then Biden does, it was showing Trump gained +5 with the Black Vote
Nevermind, yes the numbers say the same thing they did in 2016, HRC had the numbers clearly in her favor, Just as Biden has numbers clearly in his favor today.....you can't dispute that is what my point is......Nov.3rd is what countsBut if you can't decide between Biden or Trump? I suggest you go watch the Breakfast Club interview...
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads
Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary

I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
I would like Biden/Warren for rebuilding the country, and Harris for AG to prosecute Barr and all those who were complicit during this administration.  No "let's just move forward from here" BS
Biden what you gonna do ?
I‚Äôll be voting for Joe Biden.

‚Å¶ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
Biden didn't even have a flunky show up
We do t have to worry about them now... they are your stsffs... can you even use a cell phone? I see your symptoms.. my dad has it.. I know Biden has mental defects due to dementia
If you are so confident why did you float the idea of postponing the elections in November? Because #TrumpIsLosing #Biden #Biden2020

The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump

Exactly. Any vote for Biden is a ‚Äúfraudulent vote‚Äù. I‚Äôm happy to be a fraudulent voter in that case.
If Joe Biden feels that she is the best choice to help him Build Back Better, then no one should stand in the way. I believe in Kamala and if she were VP then she would absolutely make all of us proud.
1. I'm going to frame this picture.   2. It's frustrating to read reports that people are actively working to prevent Senator  from being picked as Joe Biden's running mate. The most glaring reason is that they believe she is too ambitious.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump‚Äôs fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
As I said, Biden's quote was "poor people are just a smart as white people"  You cant get more racist than that, or maybe you can, the Biden Quote, "You have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-11"
While he's on my TV eulogizing John Lewis, this popped up in my feed.

I'm old enough to remember this.
I will wade through a moat of fire surrounding the polls to vote for Biden.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
"You're not black on the inside. I'm more black than you on the inside."  see also: "You ain't black" - Biden
i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
If Biden wins this election, this will be the third time in a row an elected Democratic President will have to clean up a huge economic disaster left by his Republican predecessor.
In November.........If we are not Riding with Biden we will "Dying with Donald"
If we are not Riding with Biden we will "dying with Donald"
The Democratic Party and the liberal media will continue to say that Biden is leading in the polls so when the dems actually lose but steal the election they will say  That trump was losing all the way up to the elections so of course he lost. MEDIA CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE
I checked I have over 400 friends for Trump 2020 vs. 19 Biden supporters
She‚Äôs senile along with Biden
Look in this f****** piece of s*** he don't care about landlord he don't own properties I don't know if he's all the way up there you look like a mental case worse from Joe Biden look at the face who going to to help landlord to recover all the month of unpaid bill TK DickSanta's
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That‚Äôs the real question
I agree? But that‚Äôs not the topic here. It‚Äôs voting for Biden.  I‚Äôm not going back and forth on this.
That‚Äôs not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn‚Äôt VP.  That‚Äôs what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can‚Äôt even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I‚Äôve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We‚Äôve got nothing to discuss.
why do we have to chose between him or biden ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
Mark Levin  covered this on his show and it stopped me in my tracks, as I was in a state of shock learning about the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. They would file lawsuits against suburbs and tax payers are the ones that foot the bill. Thank you again Mr. President! #MAGA
You framed the question wrong. Shouldn‚Äôt it be, anyone afraid Kanye win the election or get more votes from both Biden and trump. No?
That would be Obama and Biden.......
Still didn‚Äôt answer! Of course for Biden lol joke
With its mismanagement of the Covid 19 response, this Administration hasn't shown the empathy for those lives lost during the pandemic. Seniors, especially, take note and vote for Joe Biden.
So if yt people don‚Äôt even want to vote for Trump or Biden than who y‚Äôall voting for??
Joe Biden is almost brain dead
Biden is gonna have a lot of shit to fix.
You have to love the poles and the numbers.... so tell us if you want to be harassed and damaged or do you want Joe Bumbles Biden?
This is who you want as pres? Doesn‚Äôt sound good to me.
Joe Biden for president!
Of course Trump believes that someone with a terrible record of upholding punishments for false convictions would be a good VP pick for Biden given this country‚Äôs current political and social issues. It‚Äôs like a softball for him during any upcoming debates
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!

mention one quality that you like about Biden. Biden is a career politician (strike 1) Biden has lied about his qualifications to be elected:  graduated at bottom of his class ,  1 degree not 3... (Strike 2)  Biden has made many racist comments over his career  (strike 3)
‚ÄúThe language very closely echoes recommendations released earlier this month by criminal justice reform task force that Biden and former primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) organized.‚Äù

I love the Barr debates, it really shows what a bunch of idiots in the Democrat Party are trying to try and run this country . Thank God I am no longer a Democrat . Biden just said thank God  we must be alllowed to build this country , he did not add or burn it down
Based on the Anita Hill case, Biden being against busing, supporting the Iraq War and so on, I think the two are closer than you think on many of these.
Obama was even further to the right than Biden and had to be dragged into supporting gay marriage. A true leftist would in no way support drone strikes or indefinite border detaining
Biden is Reagan plus LGBTQ+ rights and abortion rights. They seem to agree on almost everything else (immigration, drugs, police, health care, foreign policy etc)
Barr is lying like Trump! Trump,Pompeo and Barr are pathetic liars who are just gaslighting this country to try and stay in power. We need an honest and non corrupt Administration! Vote Biden 2020

If you werent so defensive youd realize we're saying to vote someone on the ballot and make an actual difference. If youre a Trump supporter just admit it. You dont have to hide vaguely behind "voting by my morals, which might be 3rd party or Trump, but definitely not Biden" lmao
You see? They got you. You really believe Biden is evil lmao. For what? Something he signed in the 90s?  No politician is perfect and you expecting them to be (or otherwise calling them evil) is a big problem in this country.
And yet Biden and eating shit are still better than Trump.
I can't tell if you're saying that Trump matches your morals (racism?) or if you're going to throw your vote away to someone that hasn't done anything politically either, like you claim of Biden.
But you see what's happening right? Same as in '16. The right knows Trump is a piece of shit, so their goal is to make it seem like the other person is just as bad, therefore it's a coin flip for some voters.  Biden may be status quo, but Trump sets the country back 40 years

Then again I'm sober and I still wouldn't vote for Biden no way.
Kudos to  for not trying pressure Biden into picking a Black woman as VP. She‚Äôs got great political future &amp; is good for USA

So?  What makes you think I'm a Bernie fan?  Because I said screw Biden?   SCREW BIDEN!  and HRC for going out with the super predator stuff.  Since you like Google.  Google me a video of ANYONE other than HRC, Biden, or Billy clint Clint being super douchie about it.
is kanye offering free hand jobs!! who else can beat off besides biden? will kim be there to watch? is that his election slogan. VOTE FOR KANYE, HE WILL BEAT YOU OFF 2020
I am about to make a prediction and you saw it here first. IF Biden picks Harris he will lose to Trump because as open minded as the dems think they are will NOT put another black person anywhere near the presidency.
Joe Biden....this is yo boy. Bad look....
Please stop talking about how hot Joe Biden is and focus on his policy
What? Must think Biden going to win will lose everything in taxes!
Biden would HATE if you retweeted
And I'm proud to endorse you for Biden's SECRETARY of STATE! We need to clean up the mess Trump &amp; Pompeo have made of our international relations, which is just as critical as our domestic affairs.
And you dont listen.  I said I dont like nor support biden.  And I rightfully despise trump.
There is no truth to your rhetoric. Nice try, but I despise Clinton &amp; Biden You truly believe your side is 'right' while supporting an incompetent asshat like trump who procured underage girls from epstein.  Laughable. You're no different than catholic priests in your hypocrisies

‚ÄúTrump is weak, Trump is not conservative,‚Äù Barkhuff said. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs the most easily fixable problem in America today. A vote for Joe Biden in this election is a vote for our Constitution.‚Äù
Biden found time to coach his late  son Beau's baseball team when he was a commuting senator!! Can you imagine Trump doing that??!!
Biden can't talk his way out of a paper bag! I'm terrified that Biden is going to possibly get another chance to implement Osama Obama's failed, self serving, America destroying policies! #Trump2020LandslideVictory
More if he gets a second term. He will get that. Too many ppl on the left think, why vote? I've got things to do. Someone else will do it. Then you just voted for Trump. Ppl have to vote Biden. And senators as well.
Been asking that since you became President. I guess we will have to wait until Biden takes over and the real investigations of your corruption begin.
Hey, didn‚Äôt they have a fiery exchange about busing or done legislation Biden authored??
I admire her greatly, but will she be the inspiring person needed to add life into the Biden campaign? I‚Äôm not so sure. She is part of the old regime. This campaign needs new blood, something to show DEMS are moving forward not relying on the past. Biden is more than we can hai

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Obviously ur not a true democrat bc if you were, you would be questioning A&amp; speaking out against Pelosi, Schumer, Waters and the idiots like AOC.  Biden is a puppet who can‚Äôt remember what office he‚Äôs running for, can‚Äôt remember his wife from his sister. He can‚Äôt remember shit!
Where is the justice for you ignoring the constitution, getting foreign governments to help you win an election, blackmaing Ukraine for dirt on Biden and obstructing investigations and telling admin to ignore subpoenas. So much for LAW &amp; ORDER!  Such a loser. No winning for you!!
Those who hate Trump are going to think that regardless.  The people who are undecided will side w/ Biden if he doesn‚Äôt restore order and side w/ Trump if he does.  Those who love Trump may jump off the Trump train if he lets this continue.  THERE ARE NO CONS TO RESTORING ORDER..
No worries, as soon as Biden is in office he'll be back to screaming about government overreach.
2/x Furthermore, I don't judge my candidates by who else is voting for them, but instead by their policies. There are actual violent Marxists who support Biden but I will only judge Biden on his political platform.
What a waste. Joe Biden will take it down.üåä

Is that why Biden is up in ALL polls!  You're going down DUMPY!
They will vote Biden because they want a leader who won't give up on America like you did. You couldn't handle the crisis America faced &amp; gave up Americans want a real leader who won't abandon America during a crisis. On Nov 3rd, you're fired for incompetence &amp; epic failures.
No worries.  Everyone knows Biden is close to being brain dead. I can't wait to pull the plug.
???? You know that ad is a lie. Biden want to add to police funding.   Stop drinking the kool-aid.
That's pretty much it, frankly. Hence why it's the default choice, in a broken duopoly of a system were stuck with for the time being.  Biden might be an out of touch crypt keeper but at least he's not a malicious narcissist crypt keeper.

Bottom line, guys, if Biden gets elected, we lose our country. That's not hyperbole. As much as you hate Trump, you should hate even more the premise of our country falling to the very powers that we have been fighting for decades. And they won't have to lift a finger.

You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn‚Äôt need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.
Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary

They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.

If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.

It is fear that is causing him to try and delay the inevitable, which is the American people choosing Joseph Biden. I mean how appalling is it that the sitting president doesn‚Äôt have enough respect to attend Congressman John Lewis‚Äô funeral. Thank God he only has 5 months left!
A lot of NIMBY‚Äôs are minorities too though. Like my Indian Parents are definitely NIMBY‚Äôs, but they are still voting Biden no matter what.
The great American hero will be Biden when he wins and takes office
Let‚Äôs say there is a massive Covid outbreak, Joe Biden gets the disease and dies Oct 15. Would there be a push for the election date to be moved?
You are definitely voting for Biden üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
95 percent of liberals said they plan to vote for Biden and 86 percent of conservatives said they plan to vote for Trump. Among moderates, Biden leads Trump 63 to 22 percent.

Joe Biden is older than President Clinton; would anyone want Bill Clinton to be POTUS in his current state of mental decline? Wise up people.  #Trump2020
Ngl, little annoyed at this Biden ad
A Biden bro was mean to me on Twitter now I can't justify voting for Biden. Maybe think twice before you go around calling people selfish.
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
Would you be saying this if the owner was a Biden supporter?  NO
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.
Biden never ran an ad calling implying Obama was a ‚Äúscary black man‚Äù or covertly pushed ‚Äúbirther‚Äù conspiracies. Yet ur a ‚ÄúClinton Democrat‚Äù. And u don‚Äôt have to keep reminding me where I live lmao.
If God help us Biden wins the covid-19 will miraculously disappear January 2021.
we‚Äôre 100 days away from being in the same situation as Italy If Biden wins 1.Amnesty 2. Open borders 3.DC statehood 4.Ballot harvesting legalized 5.Re-zoning districts Republicans will never win again and forever be a small minority in the house and senate only 1 party system
Clinton Sistah Souljah: ‚ÄúI‚Äòm a Clinton Democrat!‚Äù Biden fundraiser comments: ‚ÄúFuck Joe Biden‚Äù Lmao Absolute ü§°
So what your saying is that everyone should vote Biden?
Joe Biden's mental decline is an open secret.
Trump worked through gridlock. Biden has late stage dementia.
Is Biden‚Äôs climate plan good?
Because in the real fvcking world, trump destroyed everything I worked for 38 years of my life. If you think an Obama-Biden style presidency is the same as a trump one, you‚Äôre either privileged or you live in a fantasy world.
You‚Äôre deflecting. I guess all the progressives in congress who endorsed Biden are wrong.
Biden should too.
Trent Partridge #globalcoin #facebook #crypto currency
It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
I don‚Äôt think that is really Biden.
I'm old enough to remember this.
If there‚Äôs a ‚Äúred wave‚Äù in 2020 the democrats will be off the mail in voting issue faster than Joe Biden dodging real question from legitimate reporters
via  I‚Äôm so sorry ‚Å¶ we are kicking you out on November 3. #FlushTheTurdNovember3rd
I would swim across shark infested waters to cast my vote for Biden. Luckily, I don‚Äôt have to bc I‚Äôm registered to vote by mail üíå  p.s. Tr*ump can‚Äôt delay the election. His presidency expires on 1/20/21.  would become acting President then. Thx 20th amendment
Don't blame yourself Steve. How could you have possibly known how right Biden was back in April because up to that point Trump had been so respectful of the Constitution and especially the integrity of elections. Try not to be too hard on yourself.
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020
My person dislike has to do with her trying to smear Biden. None of the other women on the list tried to do that.
I guess we‚Äôll  finally hear whatever crap Giuliani has been able to extort out of foreign governments about Obama or Biden or both. Unlikely any of it will be vetted or confirmable. Democrats and independents beware it‚Äôs aimed at you.
No Biden all the way
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden‚Äôs pick. It‚Äôs time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
Must be a Joe Biden supporter
And we thought the last election was the most important. The ante went up folks.  Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins

Listen up, ladies &amp; gentlemen! Will Mrs Obama be Biden‚Äôs choice for VP next week? It appears to me that it might be! Last night, out of the blue, I had a dream about her!!!
They‚Äôre not switching out Biden while he‚Äôs up. Far more likely that Biden gets voted in, then they do the switch.
No one‚Äôs voting biden
A long, long, long time ago... Funny, in my house we refer to Trump by the moniker, ‚ÄúStupid‚Äù too!!
NO,  Pres Trump is trying to deal with the mayhem backed by dumbocruts and ANTIFA, Covid-19, and putting Obama, Biden, Hillary and commey in prison for spying on presidential Republican nominee Trump2020.
So we get GDP figures today. It should be a good day for Biden to blame Trump not the Chinese his handlers but Trump. It‚Äôs a pandemic Joe and you couldn‚Äôt have done anything but probably put more people in harms way. But go ahead get the hair on your legs standing up.
Hunter Biden got his big payday with no qualifications because of his last name. He is indicted in Ukraine and has other issues. If you and I did what he did we would be in prison right now.
I think she may lose her primary, and if Pelosi and Biden endorse her they are spineless. Brenda Jones should represent that district.
Trump, Biden and the Little Sisters of the Poor  via
i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
She just has been asking every guest ‚Äúwhat if he doesn‚Äôt leave?‚Äù And every guest has said a variation of ‚Äúafter Biden is sworn in, he‚Äôs not the president and no one has to take his orders.‚Äù William Barr can‚Äôt body block Joe from the Oval.
Vice President Joe Biden, please tell President Barack Obama to return Abigail to Pollyanna.  THE WORLD IS WATCHING!!!  Pollyanna üá∫üá≤ üèõ üá∫üá≤
That woman is tough as nails! She's going to hang in there til Biden wins, no matter what! She deserves flowers every week.
#Trump2020 #MAGA2020Landslide  Btw I hear Joe Biden wears a diaper
Biden has the same chances of winning as the Patriots of winning next Superbowl!
She'll lock up more blacks along with Biden than the both ever have before.
I‚Äôm a Neoliberal and Biden supporter. So no?
Just Biden... no need for anyone else.
Can‚Äôt wait for Biden to get in there and executive order everything you did right back into existence. Are ya ready for it!!!!
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will make excellent use of the newly modernized West Wing!
This is correct...there were plenty of Obama stuff even more Trump stuff a little Hillary and nothing for Biden
IJS I‚Äôm in a  Democratic county  and I haven‚Äôt seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker yet..
Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn‚Äôt, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it‚Äôs overkill  saying all that Biden‚Äôs gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
Who would you want Biden to pick as VP?   I still have no idea who I want
During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump‚Äôs plan?
You realize you‚Äôre behind double digits in the polls? And Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt done or said a thing.
Biden wins Penn,Wis,in addition to Michigan &amp; he is over 270!!!!Besides AZ,FL,NC,GA,TX,etc,etc,etc...
But in a way that‚Äôs better for Biden. We know Kamala and her record, so no surprises. A lower name pick could lead to a surprise in the middle campaign that could hurt Biden.
His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it‚Äôs way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!
She‚Äôs senile along with Biden
I thought about that, but they like to have American fighter jets. Biden makes one call and he‚Äôs in a diplomatic bag, on a plane to Guantanamo.
If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn‚Äôt win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.
As a Dem, you can‚Äôt be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll stay on the job after he loses. I think he‚Äôll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
I didn‚Äôt then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Ya know what America needs to unify it? A dementia ridden white guy and a cop
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That‚Äôs the real questionBut if you can't decide between Biden or Trump? I suggest you go watch the Breakfast Club interview...
Biden could pick Tony the Tiger and I'll still vote Biden in. Actually I really like Tony the Tiger. üåäüòÄ‚òÆÔ∏èüåπ
After it being CLEAR IN THE LIGHT Bill Clinton was in the pedo island and you are still considering voting for Biden.. I think you‚Äôre part of the problem!
Weird that Biden has the huge advantage over Trump...
has rejected suggestions that he choose Cornpop as VP. Instead, he will choose Congressmember  #Biden #2020Election #BidenGate
The Supreme Court's ruling gives Joe Biden the green light if he wins to enact whatever policy he wants and pay for it by taking the funds from the Department of Defense, which I'm sure the conservative Justices will treat the exact same way they've done here
You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads
Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary
Horrible company. 42 years of service and you treat me like this. Asking  to investigate your discriminatory practices shame you.
Why is Biden even listening to this dinosaur?
If biden chooses someone who was in the Venceremos then he will loose, many latin votes. Latin people are not willing to for give corporation with the castros. When i say latin i dont just mean cubans. Iean any country destroyed by socialist governments like castro's
Yes goodbye to the corrupt leadership mistakes of Trump and his selfish lies and killing of our Americans lives with his terrible leadership of the Virus epidemic! We need Biden to help get our Democracy back to the people first ! Please Vote üó≥  Senate to become Dem majority üó≥
#TheFive Now TheFive has Joe Biden commercials?!
In other words,  want to know how much the State Dept. knows about all their self enrichment schemes.  House Democrats subpoena Pompeo over claims he helped advance ‚Äòconspiracy theories‚Äô about Biden
"We‚Äôve seen huge transformation in Biden‚Äôs climate plan,‚Äù said Varshini Prakash, co-founder &amp; executive director of Sunrise Movement, which claims more than 10,000 members. While stopping short of a formal endorsement, Sunrise will now campaign for Biden.
May be get screamed at. LOL...beaten up by a Biden supporter. That is funny.
New ad campaign?  Will it be scarier than the last one?   Will it be more frightening to those already afraid of The Other?  Will it paint Joe Biden as the devil incarnate whose evil minions are coming to rape your daughters and steal your wives?  If not, why not?
Continuing a regressive culture of racial and financial discrimination across the country by rescinding Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. We must move forward not backward in this global housing crisis.
I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
According to the poll, 52 percent of respondents said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today, while 42 percent said they would choose Trump, giving the former vice president a 10 point lead.

Yeah I know I make absolutely no sense for disagreeing with businesses closing over a virus with a 99% recovery rate. Go ahead and keep it shutdown because Biden doesn‚Äôt know what planet he is on. You all will be exposed for this nonsense it won‚Äôt end well.
I can see it now. Biden wins election and sends feds into Portland. After they will say why didn‚Äôt Trump do it.
fauci all but said it‚Äôs an excuse to hide by Biden
That‚Äôs it! We need the virus so that Biden has an excuse to hide. Boom ...open up the economy... takeoff the mask and let‚Äôs go to work.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
Yeah that‚Äôs why Biden as President is totally going to change America.
Anyone a fan of Trump or Biden?
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
I‚Äôm never voting for Biden so I‚Äôm not sure what you are saying here?
Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
I‚Äôll be voting for Joe Biden.
Scary scenario... how fragile our democracy really is! A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty  #TraitorTrump
Prediction‚Ä¶ Trump‚Äôs tweet yesterday about delaying the election was intentional to trigger Dems &amp; have them on record saying ‚Äúabsolutely no way!‚Äù . Then, Oct surprise will show all the crimes Biden committed coming to the surface. Dems will scream ‚Äúwe must delay the election!‚Äù
Here‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs &amp; corrupt Republicans October surprise.....
Here‚Äôs the corrupt Trump Republicans October surprise....
It‚Äôs pretty mind blowing to me how people like Matt S don‚Äôt actually listen to or read Biden‚Äôs policies. They are super moderate and many lean right. It‚Äôs also wild how people in America want to see criminal and anti-American activity from the WH and then claim to be Patriots.
Already hearing Republicans blaming the coming recession on Biden even though elections have not even taken place yet. Any idiot can see that this economy ahead will not be an easy recovery..
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don‚Äôt accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
Ad: Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) Loves Joe Biden  via
If I were to meet Joe Biden in person, I would welcome a hug and would know that it was offered with genuine kindness. Trump is so disgusting that the closest I want to be to him is to have a TV screen between us and a mute button close by.
Well, then we don‚Äôt need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is
Under Obama and Biden from October 2010 to October¬†2016, the¬†unemployment¬†rate fell from 10% to less than 5%. Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4.7%
‚Å¶ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
And Obama had the audacity to give a ‚Äúeulogy ‚Äú about voting, mass prepaid ballots and trump.  Yeah Obama,  take the spotlight off yourself for SPYING ON TRUMPS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY WITH BIDEN AND COMMEY.   Justice will prevail.
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
Maybe be better to NOT vote to continue 2 decades long war in Afghanistan  - ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èdems are war mongers and Biden is moving to right on foreign policy. Stop the savage us savagery. Focusing on games is a distraction.
If you are so confident why did you float the idea of postponing the elections in November? Because #TrumpIsLosing #Biden #Biden2020
No risk of voter fraud? Sure. President Trump trailing Joe Biden by double digits? That's hilarious. Biden is a drooling,confused old fossil. He has no chance of beating the president.
30% drop under the reign of COVID-19. Biden-20 will be far worse when the sanders-commie loving socialist agenda get infected in the American system. Wait and see what happens to the economy when the govt grabs control of everything!
Now this is what our Presidents in the future should aspire to emulate!  We know Joe Biden can!
There is a super incoherent candidate who also is a straight criminal, but it isn't Biden.  So happy this time is ALMOST done
Thank you Mr. Biden we need you now more than ever.
Just like he did in 2016. Fortunately, Biden's got this even if Obama and Bill get bedridden.
PLEASE CHANGE COURSE .ADKNOWLEDGE THE VIRUS IS OUT OF CONTROL AND COME UP WITH A PLAN AND YOU WILL WIN ..YOUR SUPPORTERS IN FLORIDA ARE TURNING TO BIDEN .I HEAR FROM THEM WE NEED A PLAN NOW HIRE A SPEECH WRITER AND SOMEONE WITH A REAL PLAN
most of what you say happened under your prince obama who never gave a crap about blacks, and still does'nt. I bet he gave Biden the line"You aint black if you don't vote for me" Liberals have PTS. Wear a MAGAhat 24 hours it will cure you when you see leftys from our perspective.
That's not reality, it's a talking point. In reality, it's not about Trump. It's about the pervasive corruption in our establishment. Biden is the embodiment of everything wrong in our political system.
Are these the same polls that say Biden winning big? Yet polls are biased and wrong? Guess I should only trust polls you post?
Biden said his administration would be reflective of what America looks like  I think that look has to start at VP.
Moms for Biden??? What are they doing pimping out their kids to the old pervert?
Why do Dems make everything political... that was my point ... it‚Äôs insanity... and you‚Äôve proved my point... and amused me while I wait to get my buddy at airport ... thanks for that:) his flight was delayed :)) Good luck with Biden ü§™ü§™
Another angry lil Dem... Wahhhh we lost 4 years ago wahhhhh. Make sure you board up tonight ... I just saw maybe 22 mph winds possible ... oh, and see if Biden out da basement yet... does he know he running in 2020? ü§™ü§™ü§™
So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
Grind them down Madam Pelosi, grind them into the ground. Accept nothing less than what Americans deserve while  tries to kill us all.  You are fierce and fabulous! #Biden2020 #DumpTrump2020 #VoteBlue #TrumpVirus #VoteThemAllOut #BidenForFL #Biden
Cause... the lesser of two evils ... he was a fresh faced young guy In 2008 and Hillary is the Old System like the Bushes in 2016.  Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden is the answer?!? Disgusted with Dems.. own fault if they lose ...
We know Joe Biden isn't tweeting.
BULLSEYE!!! For when Biden is exposed ....he has them all on record now!
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he‚Äôs elected. It‚Äôs a huge selling point.
Which room should President Biden hang trumpy‚Äôs portrait in? I‚Äôm suggesting the incinerator room.
Opinion | Joe Biden just released a pretty good climate plan. The president is still a denier. By Editorial Board
I can tell you now what they will be. Biden Wins. You Lose.
Biden is going to kick your ass so bad and you know it which is why you are trying to delay the election.
And Joe Biden is an asset of the Chinese government... And his crackhead of the son too
But he did argue.. and said nothing. Clearly noted. Biden has done nothing in a lifetime in politics
I'll bet 99% of the "black voices" are voting for Biden. I recall when my cousin's husband, who was a pastor of a Baptist Church, would beg &amp; drag us as well as members of his church to stupid events so he looks good. We are not even Baptist. We are Catholic but did it 4 him.
STOP MAIL IN VOTING!! One letter has been sent to 2 different people.  The Post Office is run by underpaid young people!! No benefits!! Fight the Democrats!! Biden/Kamala.  She had her face redone to look white???
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
Is Devin Nunes receiving secret election dirt on Joe Biden from Ukraine?  It sure looks that way and the Dems literally have the receipts.

Somebody else shaves Joe Biden every morning.    You never see him with facial hair
have to second this...  i probably see 20 or 25 trump stickers/yard signs/etc for every biden one... but i hardly see any biden ones, if that makes sense...
His speech sucked it was a eulogy not a political rally. It‚Äôs just another desperate attempt at fear mongering to scare people into voting for Creepy Uncle Biden who cant even articulate a single sentence.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
I wondered if Biden would pick him for VP?
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump‚Äôs fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
Imo she didn't leave enough of a pause between "cup of joe" and "Joe Biden, that is!" The joke fell a little flat
The mind boggles. Biden...was....VP....

Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.

I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden‚Äôs pick. It‚Äôs time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
And we thought the last election was the most important. The ante went up folks.  Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins

Listen up, ladies &amp; gentlemen! Will Mrs Obama be Biden‚Äôs choice for VP next week? It appears to me that it might be! Last night, out of the blue, I had a dream about her!!!
No one‚Äôs voting biden
A long, long, long time ago... Funny, in my house we refer to Trump by the moniker, ‚ÄúStupid‚Äù too!!
NO,  Pres Trump is trying to deal with the mayhem backed by dumbocruts and ANTIFA, Covid-19, and putting Obama, Biden, Hillary and commey in prison for spying on presidential Republican nominee Trump2020.
Hunter Biden got his big payday with no qualifications because of his last name. He is indicted in Ukraine and has other issues. If you and I did what he did we would be in prison right now.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
I think she may lose her primary, and if Pelosi and Biden endorse her they are spineless. Brenda Jones should represent that district.
i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
Vice President Joe Biden, please tell President Barack Obama to return Abigail to Pollyanna.  THE WORLD IS WATCHING!!!  Pollyanna üá∫üá≤ üèõ üá∫üá≤
Biden has the same chances of winning as the Patriots of winning next Superbowl!
If Biden wins this election, this will be the third time in a row an elected Democratic President will have to clean up a huge economic disaster left by his Republican predecessor.
In November.........If we are not Riding with Biden we will "Dying with Donald"
This is correct...there were plenty of Obama stuff even more Trump stuff a little Hillary and nothing for Biden
If we are not Riding with Biden we will "dying with Donald"
IJS I‚Äôm in a  Democratic county  and I haven‚Äôt seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker yet..
Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn‚Äôt, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it‚Äôs overkill  saying all that Biden‚Äôs gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
Who would you want Biden to pick as VP?   I still have no idea who I want
During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump‚Äôs plan?
Biden wins Penn,Wis,in addition to Michigan &amp; he is over 270!!!!Besides AZ,FL,NC,GA,TX,etc,etc,etc...
His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it‚Äôs way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!
She‚Äôs senile along with Biden
As a Dem, you can‚Äôt be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
I didn‚Äôt then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That‚Äôs the real question
Ummmm he walked. ... he ain‚Äôt running anywhere... except for President... and that race he‚Äôll win... Biden is aloof
He just hates Biden; that‚Äôs all.
I agree? But that‚Äôs not the topic here. It‚Äôs voting for Biden.  I‚Äôm not going back and forth on this.
That‚Äôs not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn‚Äôt VP.  That‚Äôs what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can‚Äôt even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I‚Äôve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We‚Äôve got nothing to discuss.
why do we have to chose between him or biden ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"A Biden presidency would be steered by radical left-wing extremists &amp; the end of our country as we know it." Sean Hannity

I'm asking rhetorically, is there anything that Kushner does that makes the dems look bad? Rather, every time he opens his mouth the results lead to more voters who support Biden. The best thing Jared can do for Trump is keep his mouth shut.
MOST TRUMP VOTERS ARE TOTALLY MISINFORMED. ACCORDING TO TRUMP MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN.  New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots

On your dreams. America is burning because of you. We are the laughing stock of the world. Stop your tweets and try fixing everything you have down. Biden has a big job ahead of him to fix all the wrongs you have done.
Silly GOP ... didn‚Äôt Biden have a GOP Congress that didn‚Äôt fund police  ...
thank you president biden! that will be my meditation....no anxiety for me then!
Where did I type anything about Biden? Oh that‚Äôs right. I didn‚Äôt.
It‚Äôs the first time Oprah does not appear on her magazine‚Äôs cover. Is Biden naming her as his VP candidate? #BreonnaTaylor #OprahWinfrey #VoteHimOut
The question is not whether we will have an election on November 3rd. It‚Äôs whether or not Trump is able to sow enough chaos to squeak out a win. At best, what he‚Äôs doing now is just him trying to delegitimize Biden‚Äôs victory, not actually delay an election.
Joe Biden told us this in April.
Vote Biden.........said no sane person ever. war.
You must be kidding. Landslide victory for Biden . All he needs is to do is let you talk. losing votes by the minute with idiotic tweets!!
Yes and it will be for Biden
I'm a liberal and I DON'T WANT HIM TO QUIT! I want to run his ass out of office by voting for Biden. I want him to be humiliated beyond humiliation. I want him to lick his wounds from defeat until he has ulcers on his lying tongue!
Lol. Thank you for the compliment. For the record, I am fairly non-partisan. I loathe Biden too.

Nancy has to go. She‚Äôs just a Senile as Biden.  OPEN THE POLLS!!  well good thing we don‚Äôt need to be in any state of emergency for a 99% survival rate!!
Biden‚Äôs open to ending the filibuster, and he‚Äôs proposed a LOT that I never thoguht he‚Äôd get on board with, so I do think Democrats are set up to do a lot legislatively.  But will we actually END the filibuster? Will we fix all of the institutional problems the GOP has exposed?

We are all human. I don't know what the answer is. But I definitely don't think Biden answer of a complete lockdown is the correct thing either.
I don't know your idea of a real leader. But I'll tell you one thing if Biden were president the whole country would be locked down. We would be living in a police state. Maybe that's your wet dream though LOL.
You think Biden has a huge following? How many people do you think trust the MSM at this point? You think those Bernie/Warren voters are lining up for Biden after the DNC's shady behavior behind closed doors? Democrat cities are in ruins now. The silent majority will prevail üëçüá∫üá∏

You're not just voting for Biden, you're voting for a competent VP and cabinet.
Michigan Threatens to Slip From Trump as He Goes Quiet on Airwaves
I think Biden should be practical and choose a VP who can help deliver a battleground state. There's an old saying which kind of applies -- "If you want to finish first, you first have to finish."  Most important is that Biden win, and his VP choice should further that.
Biden actual was a friend to the KKK
Can't imagine how stupid Bernie must feel having lost to Biden
I LOVE WHEN THE EVIL DEMONS EAT EACH OTHER.   allies move to stop  Harris from becoming vice president
You mean the guy who‚Äôs the unnamed co defendant in Michael Cohen‚Äô felony conviction or the guy who was found guilty of misusing funds from his charity and has been barred  from being on any charitable boards or the guy that held up aid to Ukraine for dirt on Biden/yea real lawful
Biden has no fracking clue
Wow, if Biden could pull that off (I mean by 2:30 tmr) that would be something ...... üòÅ
Biden represents exactly how we got here, and why people flung so far the the other side to put Trump in lol  Trump is a symptom and his failures&amp; successes just point out all the failings and lack of efficiency in the system we were trying to keep from crumbling/taking advantage
If Biden wins, DNC and corporate establishment Dems are even more validated, and use the administration to strengthen the ties that have on democratic/blue party. They are out in position to even further silence progressive voices and coalesce around moderate platforms.
And choosing Biden is snoozing lol or alarm continues to go off and we figure out a way to wake up. Or we could snooze, and wait for a louder and more abrasive alarm to come around
Of course Biden has a lead in South Florida. He‚Äôs been leading in polls in the state for months, and Democrats largely win the state through South Florida.  And national polls mean plenty, especially when the lead is this big. Big national poll leads point to large state leads.
Like, there are other reasons to not pick Kamala Harris, but ‚Äúshe might want to run for president‚Äù seriously isn‚Äôt one of them lol.  Whoever Biden picks SHOULD have the ability and ambition to succeed him, especially if he‚Äôs only a one-term president.
Definitely, and everybody in my house will vote for Joe Biden.
ü§ö I am so ready for President Joe Biden
If Joe Biden wins Florida, then he's President. I believe he can win my home state.
Trump was the alarm.. Biden is the snooze.(someone else said that, I forget) Enjoy the rest of ur sleep, a louder alarm coming right around the corner. Or Biden gets in and everything swept behind the curtain again, then it's back to the yellow brick road for us. ü§ìü§™

Because Biden is worse in all ways 40 plus years of nothing nafta crime bill
Biden isn't taking healthcare away a  Pandemic or abusing peaceful protestors. False equivalency doesn't wash with those who practice logic
At this point, we need to unite behind Biden.  I do not agree with all his policies but if I continue on your route.. Trump will win re-election.  Please rethink your position
Yep, exactly. Biden‚Äôs financial support only comes from the fact that he‚Äôs corrupt as hell.
He would never drop out of the race. It's not in his DNA. He would rather occupy the White House after the Biden inauguration, be dragged out kicking and screaming and cry about how poorly he was treated.
Maybe Biden should add Jayapal to the VP short list. ü§î
Just because Joe Biden is mentally unfit to hold office doesnt mean Trump isn‚Äôt as well. Can we have a 3rd option? Lol
Liars?  How funny are you..Biden is just that. Good luck.
Good strategy I don't think Trump can read  Kamala Harris topped Joe Biden's list of handwritten notes alongside talking points like 'do not hold grudges' and 'great help to campaign'
Maybe it's because I'm old. But Health care has really went to shit. Everything was covered and it was cheap. Now nothing  ‚ÄòThis is health care moonshot time‚Äô: Pandemic pulls Biden, Dems further left
They say past presidents are just puppets. Nothing new with Brain-Dead Biden. Back to normalcy and corruption. Speaking of which, your dad needs to move faster on censorship and the fake virus panic, including masks, and a full open up of the economy, Friggen NOW. No vaccines.
Clearly we know Biden chose kamala. He may as well just drop the ad.
Iran is really working hard for Joe Biden to become President.  They will go back to killing American military all around the world with JoeBiden help.

Biden is picking for VP who is the best VP for
Trying to win what? Earn your vote? Why? Vote for whomever you want.   You have two choices - Trump or Biden or a passive vote for the winner. This election will have huge consequences for the future of the US, so throwing away one's vote in 2020 would be pretty irresponsible.
It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs preparing to hole up there and not accept Joe Biden‚Äôs win November 3rd or worse he‚Äôs preparing for marshal law.
It is alarming.  He‚Äôs preparing to not recognize Joe Biden. As the winner November 3rd or worse he‚Äôs preparing to declare marshal law.
Does the model bake in regression or diminishing returns when a candidate is quite far ahead? Would it have Biden by 10.2 on Election Day as likely as Biden by 6.2?

The only direction Biden will bring is politeness but I can here him now the economy is fragil to reverse trump tax cuts let alone bush‚Äôs tax cuts and of course your public option will be just as crappy as private Ins so it doesn‚Äôt hurt them
I would like to see him somewhere and Biden's cabinet. I think he has a lot to offer and he would be able to hone his craft, in the political Arena at the same time.
suggests banning masks with political messages on it. So maybe Trump &amp; Biden masks will be banned after all.
Me either. I don't want people thinking Biden has it in the bag. I have no doubt that we will have record turnout. I have no doubt that the orange Menace will contested election. And I have no doubt whatsoever, that Florida, Georgia and Kentucky, will steal the election for him.

I‚Äôm just waiting for liberals to grow a backbone and stand up to the leftists that are abusing them. But, I won‚Äôt hold my breath. Doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs going to happen at this point. And that‚Äôs why Biden is so damn dangerous.
You know someone is not playing with a full deck when they endorse Biden for President
If you would actually educate yourself on the matter you would know that Biden actually wants to give 300 mill more to the police... so yeah I don‚Äôt think that means defunding. It‚Äôs all on his website
This is happening under YOUR watch. When Joe Biden Is president we will have PEACE
Agree, I'm not voting for Biden, but I am voting against the sick fascist currently in office.

DUH how long should the shortlist be? Biden's VP shortlist comes up short
Well, in the 90s, Dems veered to the right in the aftermath of the Clinton era, so that was certainly true for a time. But these days I‚Äôd say that isn‚Äôt really accurate anymore. The party has been drifting leftward for years now, and that‚Äôs evident in recent Biden policies.
On Election Night 2016  couldn't even come out  and accept the results of the election.   What will Biden do?
It‚Äôs a weird answer, but she‚Äôs not exactly wrong. Poll after poll has shown voters are more excited to vote against Trump then for Biden, so ‚ÄúI just want to get rid of Trump‚Äù is fine, if needlessly over complicating what should be a simple answer. I‚Äôd be surprised if she loses.
99 days??? That's too long to wait for Biden, but I will!!!
Biden-Elizabeth Warren is my dream ticket but I think a woman of color is the odds-on favorite by a country mile, and I‚Äôm here for either.

President Biden and First lady Jill BIDEN will do the right thing

This is probably the easiest debate for Biden to win in his career and the way Trump has attacked Joe‚Äôs cognitive ability, he‚Äôll have the luxury of low expectations. Turning it down is turning down the opportunity for checkmate

You see why you can't trust Joe Biden and the rest of the Democraps
I recently saw where journalists said he had info on the infamous October surprise. He said look at someone name Dunbar. He apparently has a report of laws that Obama and Biden, have presumably broken. McConnell is delaying the release of it, so this journalist said.
Kerry was a very weak candidate. And we're talking about VP here. Kerry would not have won, swift boat or no Swift boat  The GOP is already planning on the garbage they're going to spew against Harris if she's chosen. And Biden needs a strong Midwest candidate.
I have been a Biden Harris girl since before either of them got in the race. That said, I think the only candidate with an unimpeachable character, is Tammy Duckworth. The GOP will eviscerate Harris. If they tried that with Senator Duckworth, they would be burned alive
Brain-dead Biden will ensure the shooting war portion of the next civil war begins.
And you wonder why Biden won't debate him?
Her son knows that she‚Äôs completely full of shit. That‚Äôs probably the only obstacle that may block her from being Biden‚Äôs running mate.
Unfortunately, it is no longer "we the people" it is 'we the elite'. Biden was their choice, made possible by power alliances with major media &amp; others forming a narrative of relative elect-ability, &amp; people bought into this bc that's the majority of what was given to them.
Maybe the democratic party should start acting like the democratic party and not a center-right party?  Why does Joe Biden object to:  Banning fracking? Student debt forgiveness? Medicare for all? Universal Basic Income? Defunding police (he wants to increase funding)?
Can‚Äôt wait for Biden to tear down that wall!
Sadly you are right on the money...but if Biden wins the anarchy continues but it will be democrats fighting back the extreme left, BLM and ANTIFA to protect THEIR communist states...
And again you keep lying... Biden wants to fund the police more than you do.
How many Americans are tired of the fake news telling our  Joe Biden is winning in the polls from his basement. He refuses  to take interviews. All he does is make a video and tell lies.
I thought my friends in Ohio loved me? Biden leads in Michigan and Trump has one-point edge in Ohio
And when do they turn into actual, deadly explosives?  People have already been arrested with pipe bombs on them.  Civil war IS upon us. Only one man can stop this.  It's  Biden is not the answer.
REALLY hard voting for BIDEN when you haven't heard much from him. I don't agree w all things Trump but I love how he's putting pedofiles away like a fat kid eats cake!

Hey David is it true what they're saying that Biden is suppressing the Hispanic votes here in Florida because me and my family are voting for him and we're Hispanic
Have you actually been in a hurricane during the day?
Tammy Duckworth is not a white woman. All Biden did was indicate that it would be, a woman. I would love to see Harris in that position, but they will make chopped liver out of her time as an AG. What are they going to say about Duckworth?
Biden should sprint to Fox for interview with Chris
Warren is Biden's worst choice, she is a back stabbing hypocrite,
That‚Äôs because Biden is pathetic
Biden I want to know if it's true that you're trying to suppress the Hispanic vote here in Florida because me and my family are voting for you and we're Hispanics
If Biden debates it will be better than a broadway show
Another thing for Biden to reverse

Besides all the things that Trump accomplished for almost 4 years and needless to say while he was attacked by the media for the last four years nobody especially Biden would be able to do what he‚Äôs done.
They will be happy to provide you with a tape of a well prepared, well rehearsed speech, read word for word from the top Democrat writers.  If you expect Joe Biden to go on TV extemporaneously, regardless of the network..... forget it.
What does someone state have anything to do with views. Wow.. your the real liberal one here.  Do you and Biden suffer from the same issues ?
Wait till Biden has to debate with Trump.  He‚Äôs going to be soooo lost!! Sadly.. Biden can‚Äôt even form a proper sentence at his age.
Ridin with Biden...
Let Biden start talking.  Lots of his fans will go RED real fast!!
I have an idea. Biden only has 7.2 million followers. What if everyone told all their followers to follow  right now? And shared everything on his feed. I bet we can make him louder than Donald on Twitter. You in? #ResistanceTaskForce
No it's not about ego like it is with the big orange idiot. I like Biden and will vote for him. But I don't need to follow him to keep up to date. I check his page often. I never check Trump page.
No just like most politicians. If they don't follow back do they really care. I have had a few follow me. But you don't have to follow Biden to see his tweets.
Trump runs anti Biden ad saying how it will look in Biden‚Äôs America. Doesn‚Äôt he realize this is trumps America?? Trump=shmuck!!
I know more people who are voting for Biden than Trump. Actually I only know 1 person who would vote for Trump.

Agreed, but anyone who thinks this ends with the election is sadly mistaken..Trump wins it escalates and worsens, Biden wins the democrats become the aggressors as they try and put down the BLM/ANTIFA movement who will switch their focus to destroying Dems.  BIG GUNS NEEDED NOW
She has a point about Biden but it is obviously mute.
Your way toooooo smart to endorse #Biden. Come on #obama  tell #America to vote  #Trump2020
Bad enough he gave it to Joe Biden

My 90 Year Young Dad...Says Trump will bury Biden in a Debate...
If Biden was much younger and hotter, maybe I‚Äôd beat him off, too.
And you wouldn‚Äôt endorse masks and social distancing until the pandemic was out of control and you realized you opponent isn‚Äôt Joe Biden, it‚Äôs The Pandemic.  You have done a terrible job and will lose in November!!
No end to the damage being done Biden will need a commission to reverse, rehire and reregulate back to sanity
This the no Biden train? I'm wit it! #holdthevotehostage
I have a Joe Biden joke, but it‚Äôs above reproach.
It is THE ONLY WAY the carnage is going to stop.Let the feds squash the anarchists and let the chips fall where they may..the election will change nothing..a Trump win violence escalates a Biden win and an emboldened &amp; empowered left tells Dems to stuff it &amp; push their own agenda
What about trump? Or did you just admit you're running to beat Biden for the very low polling trump?
Our future if #Biden is elected.   Respected Milwaukee community figure, Trump and Black Lives Matter supporter, fatally shot in front of own store
Yep the majority is already going Biden or Trump. Potentially if you vote a third party you are helping Trump win.
Watch this share and expose Joe Biden is a pedophile
Joe Biden #Biden2020 will also abolish puppies....But if you can't decide between Biden or Trump? I suggest you go watch the Breakfast Club interview...
Biden could pick Tony the Tiger and I'll still vote Biden in. Actually I really like Tony the Tiger. üåäüòÄ‚òÆÔ∏èüåπ
After it being CLEAR IN THE LIGHT Bill Clinton was in the pedo island and you are still considering voting for Biden.. I think you‚Äôre part of the problem!
Weird that Biden has the huge advantage over Trump...
has rejected suggestions that he choose Cornpop as VP. Instead, he will choose Congressmember  #Biden #2020Election #BidenGate
The Supreme Court's ruling gives Joe Biden the green light if he wins to enact whatever policy he wants and pay for it by taking the funds from the Department of Defense, which I'm sure the conservative Justices will treat the exact same way they've done here
You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads
Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary
Horrible company. 42 years of service and you treat me like this. Asking  to investigate your discriminatory practices shame you.
Why is Biden even listening to this dinosaur?
If biden chooses someone who was in the Venceremos then he will loose, many latin votes. Latin people are not willing to for give corporation with the castros. When i say latin i dont just mean cubans. Iean any country destroyed by socialist governments like castro's
Yes goodbye to the corrupt leadership mistakes of Trump and his selfish lies and killing of our Americans lives with his terrible leadership of the Virus epidemic! We need Biden to help get our Democracy back to the people first ! Please Vote üó≥  Senate to become Dem majority üó≥
#TheFive Now TheFive has Joe Biden commercials?!
In other words,  want to know how much the State Dept. knows about all their self enrichment schemes.  House Democrats subpoena Pompeo over claims he helped advance ‚Äòconspiracy theories‚Äô about Biden
"We‚Äôve seen huge transformation in Biden‚Äôs climate plan,‚Äù said Varshini Prakash, co-founder &amp; executive director of Sunrise Movement, which claims more than 10,000 members. While stopping short of a formal endorsement, Sunrise will now campaign for Biden.
May be get screamed at. LOL...beaten up by a Biden supporter. That is funny.
No, it was 47-43 Biden.
New ad campaign?  Will it be scarier than the last one?   Will it be more frightening to those already afraid of The Other?  Will it paint Joe Biden as the devil incarnate whose evil minions are coming to rape your daughters and steal your wives?  If not, why not?
Continuing a regressive culture of racial and financial discrimination across the country by rescinding Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. We must move forward not backward in this global housing crisis.
I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
Lmao talk to me when the heat lose in the first round. But what u said about Biden is true.
According to the poll, 52 percent of respondents said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today, while 42 percent said they would choose Trump, giving the former vice president a 10 point lead.
As long as you vote. Personally, I am dragging my disabled veteran ass to the polls with mask, gloves, sanitizer and garlic around my neck. No one will mess with my right to vote. I served this country for that right!   #Biden2020 #Biden #VeteransAgainstTrump

Yeah I know I make absolutely no sense for disagreeing with businesses closing over a virus with a 99% recovery rate. Go ahead and keep it shutdown because Biden doesn‚Äôt know what planet he is on. You all will be exposed for this nonsense it won‚Äôt end well.
I can see it now. Biden wins election and sends feds into Portland. After they will say why didn‚Äôt Trump do it.
fauci all but said it‚Äôs an excuse to hide by Biden
That‚Äôs it! We need the virus so that Biden has an excuse to hide. Boom ...open up the economy... takeoff the mask and let‚Äôs go to work.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
Yeah that‚Äôs why Biden as President is totally going to change America.
Anyone a fan of Trump or Biden?
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
I‚Äôm never voting for Biden so I‚Äôm not sure what you are saying here?
Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
I‚Äôll be voting for Joe Biden.
Scary scenario... how fragile our democracy really is! A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty  #TraitorTrump
Prediction‚Ä¶ Trump‚Äôs tweet yesterday about delaying the election was intentional to trigger Dems &amp; have them on record saying ‚Äúabsolutely no way!‚Äù . Then, Oct surprise will show all the crimes Biden committed coming to the surface. Dems will scream ‚Äúwe must delay the election!‚Äù
Here‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs &amp; corrupt Republicans October surprise.....
Here‚Äôs the corrupt Trump Republicans October surprise....
It‚Äôs pretty mind blowing to me how people like Matt S don‚Äôt actually listen to or read Biden‚Äôs policies. They are super moderate and many lean right. It‚Äôs also wild how people in America want to see criminal and anti-American activity from the WH and then claim to be Patriots.
We are gonna vote so hard for Biden. Like I haven‚Äôt seen an anti-Biden post among my friends in like 3 months!
Already hearing Republicans blaming the coming recession on Biden even though elections have not even taken place yet. Any idiot can see that this economy ahead will not be an easy recovery..
Biden‚Äôs getting a high number for investors *for a Democrat*.
A do think Biden‚Äôs number in the poll was right. It‚Äôs probably 51-49/48 right now or something like that.
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don‚Äôt accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
Ad: Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) Loves Joe Biden  via
Even more controversial take: I think Biden should promise trump not to prosecute him in exchange for trump leaving peacefully if Biden wins.
If I were to meet Joe Biden in person, I would welcome a hug and would know that it was offered with genuine kindness. Trump is so disgusting that the closest I want to be to him is to have a TV screen between us and a mute button close by.
Well, then we don‚Äôt need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is
Under Obama and Biden from October 2010 to October¬†2016, the¬†unemployment¬†rate fell from 10% to less than 5%. Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4.7%
‚Å¶ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
And Obama had the audacity to give a ‚Äúeulogy ‚Äú about voting, mass prepaid ballots and trump.  Yeah Obama,  take the spotlight off yourself for SPYING ON TRUMPS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY WITH BIDEN AND COMMEY.   Justice will prevail.
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
Maybe be better to NOT vote to continue 2 decades long war in Afghanistan  - ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èdems are war mongers and Biden is moving to right on foreign policy. Stop the savage us savagery. Focusing on games is a distraction.
If you are so confident why did you float the idea of postponing the elections in November? Because #TrumpIsLosing #Biden #Biden2020
No risk of voter fraud? Sure. President Trump trailing Joe Biden by double digits? That's hilarious. Biden is a drooling,confused old fossil. He has no chance of beating the president.
30% drop under the reign of COVID-19. Biden-20 will be far worse when the sanders-commie loving socialist agenda get infected in the American system. Wait and see what happens to the economy when the govt grabs control of everything!
Now this is what our Presidents in the future should aspire to emulate!  We know Joe Biden can!
There is a super incoherent candidate who also is a straight criminal, but it isn't Biden.  So happy this time is ALMOST done
Thank you Mr. Biden we need you now more than ever.
Just like he did in 2016. Fortunately, Biden's got this even if Obama and Bill get bedridden.
PLEASE CHANGE COURSE .ADKNOWLEDGE THE VIRUS IS OUT OF CONTROL AND COME UP WITH A PLAN AND YOU WILL WIN ..YOUR SUPPORTERS IN FLORIDA ARE TURNING TO BIDEN .I HEAR FROM THEM WE NEED A PLAN NOW HIRE A SPEECH WRITER AND SOMEONE WITH A REAL PLAN
most of what you say happened under your prince obama who never gave a crap about blacks, and still does'nt. I bet he gave Biden the line"You aint black if you don't vote for me" Liberals have PTS. Wear a MAGAhat 24 hours it will cure you when you see leftys from our perspective.
Re-Tweeted  Trump Can‚Äôt Stop the Election, But He Can Threaten Democracy
That's not reality, it's a talking point. In reality, it's not about Trump. It's about the pervasive corruption in our establishment. Biden is the embodiment of everything wrong in our political system.
Are these the same polls that say Biden winning big? Yet polls are biased and wrong? Guess I should only trust polls you post?
Nina Turner clearly doesn‚Äôt want Biden elected. At this point she supports delaying the election because she basically supports trump.
Biden said his administration would be reflective of what America looks like  I think that look has to start at VP.
Moms for Biden??? What are they doing pimping out their kids to the old pervert?
Why do Dems make everything political... that was my point ... it‚Äôs insanity... and you‚Äôve proved my point... and amused me while I wait to get my buddy at airport ... thanks for that:) his flight was delayed :)) Good luck with Biden ü§™ü§™
Another angry lil Dem... Wahhhh we lost 4 years ago wahhhhh. Make sure you board up tonight ... I just saw maybe 22 mph winds possible ... oh, and see if Biden out da basement yet... does he know he running in 2020? ü§™ü§™ü§™
So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
It democRATS got a candidate like Joe Biden, it is because they don't need a competitive contender to win the elections.  We must be prepared for a massive fraud. We must be prepared to defend our Country from the dirty mob.
Grind them down Madam Pelosi, grind them into the ground. Accept nothing less than what Americans deserve while  tries to kill us all.  You are fierce and fabulous! #Biden2020 #DumpTrump2020 #VoteBlue #TrumpVirus #VoteThemAllOut #BidenForFL #Biden
Cause... the lesser of two evils ... he was a fresh faced young guy In 2008 and Hillary is the Old System like the Bushes in 2016.  Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden is the answer?!? Disgusted with Dems.. own fault if they lose ...
We know Joe Biden isn't tweeting.
BULLSEYE!!! For when Biden is exposed ....he has them all on record now!
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he‚Äôs elected. It‚Äôs a huge selling point.
Which room should President Biden hang trumpy‚Äôs portrait in? I‚Äôm suggesting the incinerator room.

And Joe Biden is an asset of the Chinese government... And his crackhead of the son too
But he did argue.. and said nothing. Clearly noted. Biden has done nothing in a lifetime in politics
I'll bet 99% of the "black voices" are voting for Biden. I recall when my cousin's husband, who was a pastor of a Baptist Church, would beg &amp; drag us as well as members of his church to stupid events so he looks good. We are not even Baptist. We are Catholic but did it 4 him.
STOP MAIL IN VOTING!! One letter has been sent to 2 different people.  The Post Office is run by underpaid young people!! No benefits!! Fight the Democrats!! Biden/Kamala.  She had her face redone to look white???
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
Is Devin Nunes receiving secret election dirt on Joe Biden from Ukraine?  It sure looks that way and the Dems literally have the receipts.

Please Lincoln project, can you come up with a better slogan for the Biden campaign? ‚ÄúBuild back better‚Äù is kinda weak. You guys are smart. You can come up with something better?
Somebody else shaves Joe Biden every morning.    You never see him with facial hair
have to second this...  i probably see 20 or 25 trump stickers/yard signs/etc for every biden one... but i hardly see any biden ones, if that makes sense...
His speech sucked it was a eulogy not a political rally. It‚Äôs just another desperate attempt at fear mongering to scare people into voting for Creepy Uncle Biden who cant even articulate a single sentence.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
Biden will almost certainly win Maine by double digits. U think there will be a lot of Collins/Biden voters? I‚Äôm more skeptical considering how much Collins is tied to trump.
I wondered if Biden would pick him for VP?
Biden down only 2 in a GOP poll in a district trump win by 17!
U act like Biden hasn‚Äôt said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump‚Äôs fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
Imo she didn't leave enough of a pause between "cup of joe" and "Joe Biden, that is!" The joke fell a little flat
The mind boggles. Biden...was....VP....
Dude that means a President Biden will do it. Obama and Biden don‚Äôt do anything without talking to each other.

Joe Biden is older than President Clinton; would anyone want Bill Clinton to be POTUS in his current state of mental decline? Wise up people.  #Trump2020
Ngl, little annoyed at this Biden ad
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.
Biden never ran an ad calling implying Obama was a ‚Äúscary black man‚Äù or covertly pushed ‚Äúbirther‚Äù conspiracies. Yet ur a ‚ÄúClinton Democrat‚Äù. And u don‚Äôt have to keep reminding me where I live lmao.
we‚Äôre 100 days away from being in the same situation as Italy If Biden wins 1.Amnesty 2. Open borders 3.DC statehood 4.Ballot harvesting legalized 5.Re-zoning districts Republicans will never win again and forever be a small minority in the house and senate only 1 party system

So what your saying is that everyone should vote Biden?
Joe Biden's mental decline is an open secret.
Trump worked through gridlock. Biden has late stage dementia.
Is Biden‚Äôs climate plan good?
Because in the real fvcking world, trump destroyed everything I worked for 38 years of my life. If you think an Obama-Biden style presidency is the same as a trump one, you‚Äôre either privileged or you live in a fantasy world.
You‚Äôre deflecting. I guess all the progressives in congress who endorsed Biden are wrong.
Biden should too.
Trent Partridge #globalcoin #facebook #crypto currency
I don‚Äôt think that is really Biden.
I'm old enough to remember this.
If there‚Äôs a ‚Äúred wave‚Äù in 2020 the democrats will be off the mail in voting issue faster than Joe Biden dodging real question from legitimate reporters
Don't blame yourself Steve. How could you have possibly known how right Biden was back in April because up to that point Trump had been so respectful of the Constitution and especially the integrity of elections. Try not to be too hard on yourself.
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020
My person dislike has to do with her trying to smear Biden. None of the other women on the list tried to do that.
I guess we‚Äôll  finally hear whatever crap Giuliani has been able to extort out of foreign governments about Obama or Biden or both. Unlikely any of it will be vetted or confirmable. Democrats and independents beware it‚Äôs aimed at you.
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden‚Äôs pick. It‚Äôs time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
And we thought the last election was the most important. The ante went up folks.  Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins

A long, long, long time ago... Funny, in my house we refer to Trump by the moniker, ‚ÄúStupid‚Äù too!!
NO,  Pres Trump is trying to deal with the mayhem backed by dumbocruts and ANTIFA, Covid-19, and putting Obama, Biden, Hillary and commey in prison for spying on presidential Republican nominee Trump2020.
I will wade through a moat of fire surrounding the polls to vote for Biden.
Hunter Biden got his big payday with no qualifications because of his last name. He is indicted in Ukraine and has other issues. If you and I did what he did we would be in prison right now.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
I think she may lose her primary, and if Pelosi and Biden endorse her they are spineless. Brenda Jones should represent that district.
i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.

This is correct...there were plenty of Obama stuff even more Trump stuff a little Hillary and nothing for Biden
If we are not Riding with Biden we will "dying with Donald"
IJS I‚Äôm in a  Democratic county  and I haven‚Äôt seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker yet..
Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn‚Äôt, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it‚Äôs overkill  saying all that Biden‚Äôs gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
Who would you want Biden to pick as VP?   I still have no idea who I want
During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump‚Äôs plan?
The Democratic Party and the liberal media will continue to say that Biden is leading in the polls so when the dems actually lose but steal the election they will say  That trump was losing all the way up to the elections so of course he lost. MEDIA CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE
I checked I have over 400 friends for Trump 2020 vs. 19 Biden supporters
Biden wins Penn,Wis,in addition to Michigan &amp; he is over 270!!!!Besides AZ,FL,NC,GA,TX,etc,etc,etc...
But in a way that‚Äôs better for Biden. We know Kamala and her record, so no surprises. A lower name pick could lead to a surprise in the middle campaign that could hurt Biden.
His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it‚Äôs way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!
She‚Äôs senile along with Biden
As a Dem, you can‚Äôt be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
I didn‚Äôt then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That‚Äôs the real question
Ummmm he walked. ... he ain‚Äôt running anywhere... except for President... and that race he‚Äôll win... Biden is aloof
He just hates Biden; that‚Äôs all.
I agree? But that‚Äôs not the topic here. It‚Äôs voting for Biden.  I‚Äôm not going back and forth on this.
That‚Äôs not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn‚Äôt VP.  That‚Äôs what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can‚Äôt even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I‚Äôve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We‚Äôve got nothing to discuss.
why do we have to chose between him or biden ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
I'm sure of it. Now if Kamala Harris is AG for Biden, she will kick ass. AG's have more power that VP's.
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
Where are all their masks.??
Means she was willing to destroy his reputation and step over the smoldering remains to get into the White House. If Biden had tried that with Obama you wouldn‚Äôt want him as vp
Someone‚Äôs having trouble accepting the greatness of Joseph Robinette Biden jr., 46th President of the United States üòÇ
I thought It was rice, but now I think it‚Äôs Harris. U don‚Äôt leak especially after the Biden campaign shut it down unless u lost.
Dude, I think she‚Äôs the pick. Why would they leak if she‚Äôs not?
You sound like a Fox News infomercial, man. I have a friend who watches Fox &amp; he said the exact same thing, verbatim. Do you also think Biden ‚Äúsmells‚Äù children? C‚Äômon... look at our country today!! We couldn‚Äôt take much more of all this winning!
but even then, he would have said a complete sentence which beats out to the current dementia-laden, 5-word memorizing, dangerous-drug pushing, clown in office today! But yea, Biden will be removing the obese one!
With its mismanagement of the Covid 19 response, this Administration hasn't shown the empathy for those lives lost during the pandemic. Seniors, especially, take note and vote for Joe Biden.
I'm HOPING she will!  Biden is a corporate toady - but so is she, so....
As a man I thought AOC moved us all forward on treatment of women and language. Nah. After what you just said about Biden, I realized you‚Äôve just been well behaved for Bernie‚Äôs sake- you are still the FUCKING BITCH I knew you were in 2015 #ninaturnerisafuckingbitch
is sick mentally and thinks he can beat  .  Mr Trump has done more for Americans in 3 years than Biden has in 40 or more.   Biden has no clue on how to deal with COVID 19 or 9 as he calls it.  #FourMoreYears
So if yt people don‚Äôt even want to vote for Trump or Biden than who y‚Äôall voting for??
Worst possible scenario for this great country. Heard about Venezuela lately?
Joe Biden is almost brain dead
Dude really, ‚ÄúBiden has outspent trump since July 7th‚Äù.
Biden has outspent trump since July 7th. What a misleading headline to make Biden seem incompetent.
Biden is gonna have a lot of shit to fix.
Must see!! Hysterical!  Get the f*%k in Joe Biden's minivan!  via
You have to love the poles and the numbers.... so tell us if you want to be harassed and damaged or do you want Joe Bumbles Biden?
Joe Biden for president!
Smh at this rate Biden gets to 65% with college educated whites.
Biden seems like the only person to get close. Anyways focus on FL and NC in my opinion.
Pretty interesting that Covid-Don names a bunch of states he obviously thinks he is losing to Biden: NV, OH, PA, FL, AR.  Looking forward to the grants to TX, GA, KY and SC.
There just seems to be too many republican voters. Biden is literally maxing out Moderate and Independent support.
Pretty good numbers for Biden ngl.
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!
Georgia Tossup ü§î. Looks like Biden is outperforming Stacey Abrams by 2 percent with white voters and massively winning swing districts, but it still may not be enough due to the sheer power of republican counties and voters.
Thoughts on Biden number?
I don‚Äôt understand. It seems like u want Biden to be president so he can do stuff. He‚Äôs running for President and doesn‚Äôt hold any office, he doesn‚Äôt have any power.
To my friends who follow politics, did you watch the Joe Biden press conference yesterday? Did you listen to the questions by the #MSM (or whoever these people were)?  Were the questions tough?  This was journalistic malpractice and if you don‚Äôt agree with, #ReclaimingMyTime
Joe Biden would‚Äôve had a heart attack yesterday in AG bar‚Äôs seat
I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden!

Many dumbocruts are silently worried about Biden‚Äôs mental health.  He cannot form a sentence any longer.  Why has his constant cognitive test results not issued?  Any presidential candidate had to release their health records from Walter reed hospital.  Where is it?????
Joe Biden's Notes Suggest Kamala Harris May Be His VP PickThere is no other answer this election.  You either support Biden or Trump, reality is a bitch.
Bro, you spread an unvetted accusation about Joe Biden. How does any of this surprise you?
It would be easy to over throw Biden and friends. They would run faster than little girls and cry.
Yeah, because Trump is free from nepotism. All Biden has to do at a debate is say he is reasonable on guns and abortion and the evangelical crowd will abandon Trump in droves. Neither of these geriatric fools wants an actual debate.
Biden and Trump are basically the same. Only difference is that Biden won‚Äôt embarrass himself at cocktail parties.
Biden has California, Bass loses Florida. 50 state strategy. You guys have all the political instincts of this guy. Life long Dem, Cuban life long Floridian. I can see the ads now.
‚Äúeasily debunked‚Äù  Her. Own. Words.   She‚Äôs a dumpster fire.   If Biden is determined to make his choice based upon race/sex, there are better candidates than this buffoon.
can you ask Jill Biden if she minded be confused with Joe‚Äôs sister.

Yes I lived in Europe. You haven't.  Also, no one cares about what Europe thinks. They want Free everything too. Just like you. Make sure you tell everyone how much you like the Riots, Biden, Partial Birth abortions, and illegals.
Biden is killing America as we know her just so he can cash in on the job he always wanted(&amp; was promised) so Biden will sell us out &amp; is also very easily controlled to do as he‚Äôs told-not realizing he‚Äôd be the scapegoat in the end.. Ruining America at all costs!üò±
Never said that. Looking at your retweets you stand for nothing.  Biden is your guy. No values, and Partial Birth Abortions. Good luck, but Don't tell your kids or grandkids you have morals. Sure no one is perfect, but Biden LMAO. Might as well vote AOC.
üòÇüòÇ are you wondering (as I am) who exactly thinks these things up against our President? I first thought it was AOC but now am thinking it must be Biden... who else is dumb enough to get people to believe?... of course there are some dumb bunnies out there..ü§≠

This is why we need to ignore the polls and keep fighting to remove the fascist.                           Biden's 13-point lead? 'Meh', says Florida
I'd like to know what creepy joe biden and communist cuomo would be doing for the Chinese flu? All we hear is bloviation outta their pie holes.
Biden‚Äôs alleged lead in the polls has decreased by half in the past couple of weeks after everyone wittnessed his disastrous q and a with preselected questioners and questions
ROF Radio this wkd:  from  #Biden featuring  w/host
of course they're all standing in providing Biden can't stand up for 2 minutes let alone remember a speech or a sentence for 2 minutes so yeah each and every one of these Democrats are stand-ins for the presidential campaign speeches there I fixed it for you
Then vote for Biden. President Trump said no such thing.

He will be a great adviser to Biden
Well he pissed off China so I would say there goes Putin in overdrive getting all his people together so Trump to get back in office yeah right will they all be disappointing when Biden face is in the Oval Office

He's telling the people what they want to hear so they would vote for him regardless would he gives everyone here and United States we're still going to vote for Biden

It's not 60% deaths are Dem states, **it's the top 10 states (Dem) carry over 60% of USA's deaths and they are Dem**, that's not including the rest. To say other countries won't come here, assumes poor leadership. Biden and the Dems would do better?
And Biden would have done better? We won't know how Dems would have handled it. Hillary lost..

Biden being a bad candidate does not absolve Trump of his buffoonery.
Come on now guys! We all know Biden would have done so much 'better' with the "amount of CV9 body bags"... ü§î üëáüòÇ Fact!
You act like I just fell off of the turnip truck. What used to be our Democratic Party no longer exists, it‚Äôs been high jacked by AOC, and her ilk, Pelosi, Schumer, and Schiff. Your party hates everything our country stands for and for some weird reason people are voting 4 Biden
I listen to  while driving and find it funny that they almost never air Biden talking...
All races have the opportunity to vote. All races shop at Home Depot, Lowes, grocery stores , go to Doctors and more taking safety issues so they can go vote. It is about ALL races Mr. Obama. Your VP, Biden led charge keeping black students from White. !!!!!
What we need to watch for is tRump stuffing the ballots with "random" bogus ballots...fake ballots for tRump and Biden....enough that the election can be declared invalid for both parties. tRump wants chaos, he declares martial law to "make sure the next election is fair + just"
Are we supposed to believe this is actually Joe Biden tweeting this? It's a confirmed account, just like our current POTUS! Anyone else conflicted by all this?
Why aren‚Äôt Americans focusing on this aspect of Biden? The man is sick.
Doesn‚Äôt matter, Trump and Biden are basically the same person. Would be nice not to have to hear about Trump‚Äôs tweets all the time.
Does anyone remember the  article condemning Democrat politicians wanting to eliminate the Electoral college, including Hillary and Biden?
There's no evidence of that. Biden doesn't carry the baggage of Clinton. There's no evidence Trump has expanded his base at all. The polls in the states Trump won by ~ 1% or less, which is why he won, are polling much stronger for Biden than they were in 2016 for Clinton.
...  you mean the crimes orchestrated by Obama, Comey, and Biden in the Oval office?  You know...  Where even AFTER the FBI spent 5 months investigating Flynn and found NOTHING, yet Obama directed Comey to get the "right" people on the job of "finding" a crime?
If we bothered to investigate most of congress and their staffs..I bet most of them have some hinky kind of issues in their personal business and taxes.  Lets talk about Hunter Biden.  That not a bit hinky?  Point is...Trump no worse than a lot of them.

Opinion | If Biden wants to double down on a ‚Äòthird Obama term,‚Äô he should pick Susan Rice  Why would anyone want to be a "third Obama term." Obama simply was not that great.
You sound stressed, you‚Äôre terrified Biden is going to lose aren‚Äôt you?
üòÇüòÇüòÇ but Biden isn't
Ok come on, you don't seriously think Biden has the mental capability to run this country do you? Aren't you a bit concerned who they really have planned to run it? What if its a horrible person. You don't really know who you are voting for. Trump is 4 yrs Communism is forever.
I mean from this exchange, Biden's always had questions on Barr's view of executive power.
Biden, Crooked Hillary
Yes...Biden and Killary!
I‚Äôve thought this from the beginning regarding Biden: he‚Äôs their throwaway. Now, I believe the purpose of the extreme radical swing is to desensitize and normalize it for 4 years to prep the country for 2024.
Biden would say ‚Äú That‚Äôs nice‚Äù.
Biden is getting ready to take a big fall.
Let's see, Kamala got into politics on her knees, has a horrific record as CA AG, and called Biden a Racist. Rice is complicant in lying about Bengahzi, unmasking Gen Flynn &amp; complicant in an attempt to rig an election and overthrow an elected President. Hmmmm choices choices...
Yea, Biden being escorted out of a convince store kills his presidency for me.
It is simply beyond comprehension how anyone could pull the lever for 'Plugs' Biden. His elevator no longer makes it to the top floor.
Is LeBron James buying votes for Joe Biden????
Biden has been in politics for 50 years and has ZILCH to show for it and blames the world‚Äôs problems on Trump. That‚Äôs pathetic.
Just wait until after Nov 3,  There will be no more covid, nor testing positive.  We will have miracles of trillions of negatives and Biden will go into a rest home along with Hillary.

Opinion | Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0
Ah yes when you can't debate, because Google won't tell you what to say, then call someone stupid. You clearly have no idea what you're saying, or Why. Just like Biden. Please vote for Him.
How is the President Responsible for the dead? Is Obama Biden Responsible for H1 N1? Even with a vaccine 1000's die. Maybe we should Still hold them accountable? President Trump closed flights to China in Jan. Dems were briefed before that. Who, China, Fauchi said No worries.
This is Another example of UV light. I know what My President was talking about. He did too. Especially since he just got briefed by that Physician. You clearly are a Biden supporter.  Your dumb points don't fly with Medical people.

Analysis | Trump‚Äôs sweeping claim that Biden wants to ‚Äòabolish all charter schools‚Äô  I doubt that. But good riddance. They are not worth the taxpayer funds.
Opinion | Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0  Not really. The GOP has to be burned down to the waterline. The authoritarian, racist, anti-system party needs to be destroyed.
Biden said yesterday he‚Äôs never been tested.
Hopefully, he'll be in it when he does. Biden will rebuild!
When does 'Plugs' Biden announce Kamala Harris is his VP selection?
Harris displayed her lack of character during the Kavanaugh hearings. No surprise, Biden‚Äôs potential pick is an insufferable, sewer, pond scum sycophant.
Ha ha ha ha   And Biden is ahead according to polls. He sounds like a car that  won‚Äôt start, he turns over but just doesn‚Äôt catch. I guess that he is flooded.
Sure he does. With that rationale Biden and Obama still own the Cases and Deaths of H1 N1. Tick tok Obama and Biden on the Clock even with a vaccine. TDS at its finest.
Please do. Biden is going to be an abysmal failure
Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúpublic option‚Äù means government subsidy for the insurance industry. Also, I guess you never heard of FDR...

This past week has haunted me because I‚Äôve seen so. fucking. many. of them.   I see more and more every day.   I haven‚Äôt seen a single one with Biden‚Äôs name on it.   If you truly want this monster out of office, please, go out and fucking vote this year.
I don‚Äôt see the president at that protest I see a bunch of people taking advantage of a situation being paid by the Democratic Party to make the president look bad if Biden wins it‚Äôs gonna be worse then what happened when Obama won
Please watch every single word you say every single thing you do the idiots are watching if Biden wins I‚Äôm gonna blame you and only you we must win 2020 Please don‚Äôt let us down please don‚Äôt let that loser win please American need you
Why do you think neoliberals like Biden, Obama, Clinton, Schumer, Durbin, and Pelosi favor government supported insurance companies vs a federally funded system? Don‚Äôt forget, they may say they want to raise corporate taxes, but decades of power say otherwise. #lipservice
Awwwwww. Give Biden a chance. Lol
He will you estimating Biden's inaugural crowd? *hic* AIR HIGH FIVE BRUH!
Biden thinks he's going to have a compliant Republican Congress if by chance he's elected. üòÇ
She could be in Trump‚Äôs administration given her history of law and order as CA AG. Locking up POC for smoking weed while you admit to the same yourself is pure hypocrisy. However, you‚Äôre right that she would be a perfect fit for Biden‚Äôs puppet presidency.
That‚Äôs not going to happen, the reason Biden was picked to run was his ability to deliver on the status quo continuance of the healthcare insurance industry. In fact, he will likely attempt to increase insurance revenues with tax dollars under the guise of ‚Äúenhancing‚Äù the ACA.
Pretty bad when Biden is the sensible choice. At least the military industry and insurance lobby will happy over this geriatric, neoliberal, coronation.
Because. handlers hand pick the reporters he is allowed to answer, and they have the questions ahead of time. Biden confirmed that one of the past times when he actually said he was only calling on certain reporters from a list. Lol
Don't count on it with Biden. He wants to make friends not do the right thing. Still better than Trump.  *hic*  AIR HIGH FIVE BRUH!
Being police chief powered Val Demings‚Äôs political rise but could complicate her hopes of becoming Biden‚Äôs running mate  I suspect for the overwhelming percentage of Black women, Val Demming's being a police chief ain't gonna be a complicating factor.

Jimmy Kimmel,Jimmy  Fallon is no Johnny Carson! Big difference in yesteryears‚Äô talk shows than today! If today‚Äôs shows talked negatively towards Biden today, it would end there career!
What's your solution? Biden steps down and Bernie takes over?  If your support of Bernie is blinding you to the person Reade is you're a cultist and don't really care about victims, you care about an agenda.
Former National Security Advisor Susan Rice is absolutely qualified to be the next VP. Her strengths are in Foreign Affairs, while Joe Biden can take on the tasks of repairing things domestically. Excellent choice!
Biden isn't in yet? He has told some beauties though.  Would you like a list, or can you find them yourself?
Love it! We should all wear Biden hats to vote.
They just reported on this.
You just reported on this.
Biden has a plan to decriminalize.
Biden lies.
I don‚Äôt think so. As bad as it seems, I think we need to prepare for President Biden I.e Sanders/Cortez.
Good luck with that! I didn't think the Dems could possibly produce a worse candidate than Hillary, but y'all never cease to amaze me. I mean Joe Biden?? lmao.
I can see why you may help Biden with speeches. He does not know where he is half the time and you and others choose to ignore it.
who are you to make these remarks about Trump and the covid epidemic? Your Biden can't even come out of the basement . He said he is going to take care of this epidemic and the 6 things mentioned have been done by Trump already.
Before I take a break I want to express my apprehension over something that is incomprehensible. How could anyone who had the ability to reason pull the lever for the demented, dotard, 'Plugs' Biden this November?
The last thing the corrupt, criminal DNC wants is Biden out on the stump bloviating his stupid nonsense. They want him to stay in his basement with his mouth taped over with duct tape. They believe he can do very little and their defamation of Trump will get 'Plugs' elected.
Ditto. Biden is pandering, as usual. Without gender or race cards, Dems have nothing.
Oh good grief. Is Biden really considering Susan Rice? Finally got ppl to STFU about Benghazi &amp; he‚Äôs gonna bring it all back? Arrrrgggghhh. Yes, I know it‚Äôs BS &amp; isn‚Äôt fair, but come the fuck on. There are _lots_ of other good picks who‚Äôre also women of color.
Trump has more female senior advisors than the Obama/Biden regime did in 8 years
Maybe Biden is rethinking . Does he really want to be President
I mean, "That's a clean African American" didn't stop Joe Biden from getting picked.

If all he watches is CNN then he probably believes Trump colluded with Russia, Biden doesn‚Äôt have dementia, and it was Trump not Clinton who rode on Epstein‚Äôs plane 27 times on his way to Pedo island too
Picked up my Biden sign to go next to my Dosev sign. Might rig up a streaming camera next to them so I can see the cognitive dissonance explode my neighbors‚Äô heads in real time.
Biden still refuses to emerge from his bunker and answer policy  questions. His supporters aren‚Äôt voting FOR Dementia Joe they‚Äôre voting against Trump.
The people burning, looting and resorting to violence are really trying to destroy American democracy. They surely don‚Äôt help Biden. They give Hitler, sorry I mean Trump, an excuse to bring in his storm troopers.
Biden needs a strong running mate and color has nothing to do with it. The man doesn‚Äôt know what day it is or the difference between a city and a state. He is not fit to serve.
Same for me. I voted Trump hoping he would become presidential and govern wisely and fairly. What a mistake! In November I plan to correct that mistake by voting for Biden. I believe there are many others in the same boat.
If we play stupid games we get stupid prizes. Why is nobody continuing this narrative?
Everyone needs to pay attention to this.  They are coming for the suburbs if Biden gets elected.  I recommend you watch the full episode of Life Liberty and Levin aired 07/26/20.
There it is. No one is pro Biden. Ricky has been lying to you sir.

He stopped flights from China a WHOLE MONTH before Nancy said ‚ÄúCome to China Town (San Francisco)‚Äù and Biden was still calling Trump‚Äôs response xenophobic.  Please look this up to see this truth.

I'm not Republican, and I see democrats destroying cities, blm and Antifa killing people, Dems locking us down (employment stats), and Biden who can't even say simple CV19.If he was president the whole country would be open for CV19&amp;illegals. SleepWell
There has been no arrests, or mention of children being rescued. Feeling like a game being ran... I'm voting for potus' 4 more years, but I'm not buying the narrative any more. Too many holes, and resurrected Celebrities speaking gibberish. Q may help Biden win!
Pics lie, videos don't , you can see clearly she doesn't want the wood from Biden?! She is sooo scared.. Meisje:  "Ik heb hulp nodig!!!"
I don't see any pictures of Biden or Nancy P among those protesters. So don't say we r with u.
Biden is Really Vile.
Unless God has dirt on Joe Biden or insight on how to get Obama arrested before he gets arrested, Trump has no use for him. God is the author of peace not confusion. Trump thrives on confusion and division. He CHOSE to fight protesters rather than listen. WAKE TF UP. Biden 2020

Listen to what Biden has to say!
I agree, Basement Biden needs to tell his supporters to quit burning and looting our cities
#ResistanceTaskForce  Biden2020 all the way!!  Hopefully when Biden wins he'll push for stricter protocols by which one can run for president. With Trump's background he couldn't get a job as a high school principal! He should never have been allowed to run for office.
A sequence of words remembered in the proper order some time after first seeing them. I would love to see 'Plugs' Biden take that test. Well, he might get his name right if it was on the teleprompter.
Just keep bloviating your nonsense right up until the time Trump stomps "Plugs" Biden into a nursing home where the dotard belongs. BTW, when will he entertain more than 'fluff ball' questions from the media? Or will you continue to hide him in his home basement?
I have to wonder if it's the Demtards plan to hide 'Plugs' Biden until they take him to the precinct where he votes on November 3rd. Have his staff explained that he isn't running against himself as he so adroitly said a couple of weeks ago? What a demented, old dotard.
This is how Joe Biden‚Äôs supporters behave so this is what a Joe Biden America would look like

Yes, the former POTUS is "America's future". Like he wasn't already in office for 8 years. What a moron. I would also be offended by this if I was running Biden's campaign.
she was such a precious looking young lady.  I'm so sorry for your loss and I have such respect for your persistence in keeping her memory and the cause to enact gun control alive and up front.    And yes, Biden is the obvious choice in this election.
Everybody's clammering for indictments. Biden is such a weak candidate, surely best tactics would be to wait until after elections. God forbid trump should lose, he can then use it as ammunition in favour of illegitimate biden presidency
A vote for Biden is a vote for China.
Yes ugh  Biden here  is your vote
When are you going to congratulate Joe Biden for his now brilliant prediction that Trump was going to try to postpone the election?
I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden for President.
Teachers Unions were never about the students only politians like Biden who wants to partner with them to push their Liberal agenda.
Huh?? The fuck is ‚Äútoo ambitious‚Äù? Is politics not ambition? Oh wait it‚Äôs a black woman with power and influence who could very likely become the president considering Joe Biden is a walking corpse. Save us the trouble and just say you hate black women.    you‚Äôre a joke.
THE VICTORY:Seattle, the negotiations is continuing. Pres TRUMPS firm stand and the carnage publicity happing to the socialists ,Biden, BLM, is telling For over 2 months in Seattle, BLM, anarchrists have rioted, looted, burned, assaulted,  murdered.THE SOCIALISTS  HATE PUBLICITY
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúSeniors for Biden Kickoff Meeting‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
The ‚Äúyou all‚Äù are the people who seem to be relishing the chance to automatically take potshots at the Biden campaign about whether there are reservations about Harris. We are too close to the finish line to throw any monkey wrenches. Don‚Äôt take your eyes off the prize.
Delegates vote overwhelmingly to endorse Biden for president and to reimagine society
1. there should be an age limit. I don't want 70 yr olds dictating my life choices when they suck on butterscotch candies. 2. they're rich already so why do they care 3. Joe Biden for president! lol
That's fine. Biden should promise one and done anyway.
The only thing Biden knew how to do was hook his family up with government contracts and finding Hunter jobs with foreign entities.
Biden is a joke!
Now do joe Biden
Anyone else searching for new Biden blunders for entertainment?  I wish his handlers would let him out of his wife's basement!  #BidenBlunders
THE BIDEN PLAN FOR STRENGTHENING WORKER ORGANIZING, COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, AND UNIONS ‚Äì Joe Biden for President
Very well...thanks again....Biden is surely loved by the Mullahs after Obama and Biden sent them all that money and made the crooked nuke deal....üòÄüòÄ
Another example of that is what the Biden's did in Ukraine and China with aid and corrupt business dealings
Nope, a vote for Trump is a vote for Trump. Biden still has to earn every vote no matter how terrible trump has been. Trump + Johnson actually defeated Clinton + Stein in the popular vote.
I'm all for Biden and you, don't get me wrong, but double check who is getting the unemployment. I'm disgusted seeing people whose jobs are open and sit back while others have been working this whole time.
Will, have you read any articles by Matt Taibbi?  The hatred of Trump has unfortunately changed the media.  They only care about one thing- electing Biden.
Exactly. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are about the only polls I look at.  Michigan looks safely blue.  If Pennsylvania slips there are probably big problems going on in other "swing states" (Florida, NC) as well. I think it comes down  simply to if Biden takes Wisconsin, he wins.
This reminds me of the anecdote from Nancy Reagan when she said Ronald couldn't remember the right words for simple things. She said he would ask her for a book but he called it a tree. Biden really seems to be in the early stages of the same thing.
I for one remember President Trump taking early and decisive action  against Covid-19  by blocking travel to and from China.  And the Democrats in general and Joe Biden in particular called him a Xenophobe and tried to keep travel open.  That tells you what they wanted .
‚ÄúI always put women ahead of me. Then I bury my face in their hair and breathe in deeply through my nose.‚Äù ‚Äî Joe Biden
If pedo Biden wins which I doubt
Womp womp. Cry me a river. When kamala and the Dems nominated biden they knew who he was. Shouldn't be a surprised at who is in charge. Counting down the days until the khive implodes and turns on their beloved uncle joe.
I'm sorry but what did you expect from the party that nominated Biden?
I prefer someone younger.  Karen Bass will be 67 in October.  That means she will be 71 for the 2024 election.  Given that Biden will most likely only serve one term the VP would normally be the next elections candidate...
Actually it's due to Biden's Dementia.....and We all know it....The Fighting Irish have turned into the Pandering Leprechauns....
As someone who likes and respects Bass I still need someone to tell me how she's qualified to be POTUS - and I mean in a time of unprecedented challenges not as compared to Trump. Biden has said that's a necessary quality so I'm not being capricious here.
Why would Biden be in the meeting?
And what does it say that Biden is taking any advice from him?
Biden drools in his oatmeal. He's the best they could do?
the mayors/governors of the blue states figure if they can help Biden get elected, he will make them whole.
And I have a son in his 20s who has promised to vote for Biden ( he loved Bernie), UNLESS he picks Harris. The way she locked up young people and minorities for pot as AG of CA is a line in the sand for him.
1/2 I have been on Team Biden since day 1. My first choice for VP is  closely followed by  and  None were his opponents in the primary, hence there are no ugly debate moments to have to explain away that would be a gift to the GOP.
Lol, not seen a single Biden flag here in N PBC..every house and every boat/yacht are flying Trump flags off their wheelhouses
This Biden team is going to blow it with progressives and young voters with all these dinosaurs surrounding Joe.
Joe Biden around small children.
Rachel, I strongly disagree with your analysis. The polling on Michelle Obama is and her popularity is strong up until the moment she‚Äôs announced as Biden‚Äôs VP. At that point the polling gets weaker and she starts getting trashed. Michelle knows that, too bad you don‚Äôt.
All these centrist &amp; GOP takes are driving me nuts.  Biden needs to stop taking the progressives for granted &amp; give us something to be enthusiastic about. Because I'm frankly still not happy that the primary gave us this old white guy as our nominee.
Good for Biden. It's not really the issue of her attacking him. That's fair. The issue is she pretended to be hurt by Biden's stance when it was all just a ruse.  Harris is a sociopath and if it takes a pervert like Dodd to keep her away from the WH that's fine by me.
Biden Bottoms lmao ü§£
I‚Äôll for sure pre-order vinyl, but no US tour üò≠ Any chance of that in 2021? I promise it will get better here once Biden is president üòú
Clear they are setting Harris up to be president. Like biden, harris can only win if every element of the process is rigged on their behalf.
Moms will vote for Biden
Literally trump is fighting to oppress you, actively, and the world is watching the fight against his actions. Biden, while not perfect, would not do this. So yeah, just vote. We need to not purity test ourselves into another four years of this horrorshow.
Bidens H1N1 response was disastrous we already know what's going to happen with Biden
I live in red Florida and a very red neighborhood. Late in the evening when Biden is announced as winner, I‚Äôm going to light off the mother lode of fireworks. Got wife approval ‚Äúno matter how late.‚Äù She also said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll blast patriotic songs out into the street. Can‚Äôt wait.‚Äù
But they won't say anything about it until Biden is sworn in
Once again if you are actually reading, I‚Äôve said multiple times i don‚Äôt support Trump or ANY of the candidates. But if we are comparing, i can list at least 4 policies from 1984-94 that locked us up unjustly with Biden‚Äôs name on it. List some of the policies Trump introduced.
What isn‚Äôt true brother lol? Biden and the crime Bill or Trump pardoning black people? It‚Äôs Sunday so i have some time
That‚Äôs the point they‚Äôre ALL villains. Biden created Policy to destroy black families and lock us up unjustly, research it. Do you want to go back to that? Show me the policy Trump created to lock up black people. He‚Äôs actually freed some of us. Look that up
I run an African Drum and Dance Company that‚Äôs heavily in the school system, i also own a farm that provides Organic Produce to underprivileged communities. All documented. Those are just a few things. Now what are YOU doing? Promoting Biden is actually hurting us. 94 crime Bill?
At what point in history has an American President truly assisted in the liberation of black people in this country? Shouldnt take mental gymnastics to answer that. Trump won‚Äôt, Biden won‚Äôt, Hilary won‚Äôt, Obama didn‚Äôt. Doing the same thing expecting different results is insanity
üíï Waiting on  to announce  as his running mate, so I can buy an official Biden/Harris shirt!! #KHive
It‚Äôs not just about Biden. It‚Äôs about the Congress and Senate as well.
Y‚Äôall really supporting Joe Biden and it‚Äôs sad
I‚Äôm so tired of your rhetoric. If Obama and Biden committed a crime, why is fat boy Barr not conducting an investigation and looking to prosecute them?! Bro, have you ever taken Baron fishing, golfing, bowling, anything? Go golf LOSER.
Just look at how Biden leads off his answer about his running mate the other day with ‚Äúiiiii‚Äôm looking for a black ahhh person of color oh yeah &amp; also woman for my VP pick. He doesn‚Äôt believe in it &amp; it shows but he knows that could get him a few extra votes. He‚Äôs using everyone
I'd for the red squirrel I feed named Daisy Mable at this point...or a bag of nacho cheese Doritos or a cockroach in a condemned apartment over Trump. So yeah...gotta go with Biden lol

tRump has divided our nation to put through his own personal agenda.  We need to throw him out of the WH and put President Biden in!!!!
Also, please don't tell a woman who is 52 to 'do your research', as I have voted in more elections than you can imagine, and in similarly dark times. We don't vote for purity, we vote for best fit. Biden, right now, is best fit.    p.s. If you are into trump, just say so. Ok?

Anyone not voting for Biden needs to never ever claim to care about America  or democracy.
Can't. Wait. To. Vote. Biden.
Nope, Biden will have an earpiece with someone feeding him answers.
It‚Äôs almost over. God I hope Biden picks a worthy VP and someone America can wrap their head around unlike what McCain did.

I don‚Äôt watch Fox News üòâ what have they done? List the things they have done besides donating money to BLM that goes directly to the DNC.besides telling people to vote as this is Trump‚Äôs fault. Obama &amp; Biden didn‚Äôt do anything for Black people or to help with police brutality
Dude you‚Äôre so lost, it‚Äôs not even worth replying to you. Trump has been the toughest president on China. Biden and Obama worshiped China and allowed them to get away with everything and guess what? They profited from it. You need to educate yourself before commenting

Lunatic but thank goodness can you imagine her running this Country yeah she‚Äôd run it into ground sell out country n Biden will do the SAME
What's going on with Biden? Is this a sure sign of Dementia? One of the signs is impaired reasoning according to the medical definition. If he wins in Nov he'll have the nuke codes. Scary thought.
The harder thing than the hearing is watching Biden try to answer softball questions from reporters. Sad

As a former Delawarean I had thought I was done with Biden given his age and many failings. But he‚Äôs back  And if there is a person in politics with a more irritating voice than Kamala Harris I cannot imagine who that might be.
November 3rd, I am voting for Biden, to do just that.
A safe bet, Miss SEC. There is no way on earth Biden‚Äôs people will let him go on stage to debate Trump or take part in another unscripted interview, regardless of how friendly the interviewer would be.  He can‚Äôt even take questions at his pressers.
They just want to give President Biden an even BIGGER mess to clean up----like he won't have enough already!  Do everything possible to make sure we have a DEMOCRATIC Senate AND House after November; start by getting rid of McConnell, Graham and Collins!!
Pathetic, still desperately hanging on by your fingernails to #FakeNarrative of Trump/Russia,   "collusion." Left has been proven wrong for 4 yrs w/mult investigations, incl one using the full force of intl, DOJ, &amp; FBI. Obama/Biden were the Russian ass kissers. Nice try though...

Can't wait for POTUS Joe Biden
Biden should ease up on that Trump is a racist stuff. Has shown a number of instances of being a racist. At some point Trump is going to throw that in his face. Then you know what he'll do, he'll lie. That's what liberal Democrats do they lie.
I try to make fun of these ridiculous people and things. These subjects are very serious to me. If Joe Biden was selected it would scare me. They would pull him like a marionette to pass every socialist bill they could.
You know what people are calling Trump a racist a white supremacist. They haven't shown One Clip with him saying anything racist. There is plenty with Joe Biden showing his racism though. If Trump said those things, they'd be screaming it from the rafters.
I live 57 years and up until I never heard of anybody saying nasty comments about somebody having a political bumper sticker. I w never to somebody with a Biden sticker. I personally deplore him. I guess you can't have free speech unless you agree with them.
I'm a diabetic and I take insulin. The prices are absolutely ridiculous, some points in my life I had to choose not to eat or take insulin an live. What Donald Trump did today I was so choked up I almost cried. Obama and Joe Biden got rich off these drug companies. Their garbage.
I agree! I've been a Democrat my whole life, but wasnt happy voting for Hilary the same way I'm not happy voting for Biden. But, how else are we going to get Trump out? Any viable ideas? It is the time to unite against a horrible evil in the WH.
I figured out what Joe Biden's platform is. He's going for their ignorant, uninformed, CNN and brainwashed audience. He hasn't said one thing that a normal American would want to hear in a presidential candidate. He should run as a Socialist Communist at least that is honest.
The scary part is that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of what a disgusting individual Joe Biden is.
POS the ones that did ridiculous why didn‚Äôt this get done when the traitor BHO/Biden in office it‚Äôs now so important total BS RINO
Not even close to accurate here in Florida. I see Trump signs everywhere and never see Biden signs.

You know what I was thinking, Joe Biden is a broken down politician. I can't understand how anybody in their right mind could vote for him. Just because you hate Trump isn't a illegitimate reason. Hating is no reason to vote. Some people don't even know why they hate Trump.
That's better than endangering those who did not vote for democrats, elections have consequences. I can't wait for Biden to win and keep the feds out and see what happens when shit really hits the fan.
You're a lying dog-faced pony soldier - Joe Biden

Ever wonder why so many big brand names back Beijing's favorite candidate for POTUS Joe Biden? Same reason #SleepyCreepyBasementDwellerQuidProDementiaJoe opposes America First. Follow the money.

2 things I noticed in watching this video.Biden likes to say the Obama Biden administration but three different times Obama said in my administration.Obama gives him nothing. Secondly, 90% of the time Obama is talking and when Biden does talk he rambles and doesn‚Äôt stay on topic
One of my best friends was a fireman. He was killed inside the World Trade Center on 9/11. And Joe Biden says he wants to teach Islam in our Public Schools. That's one of the most disgraceful things I ever heard. They don't even want to do the Pledge of Allegiance.
Do not  be confused by the media, the stock market or politicians about your choice this fall.  Only totalitarian regimes erase history because their goal is to erase your mind &amp; deny your observations. Pelosi and Biden are types of ‚ÄúManchurian Candidates‚Äù.
Yes. But a lot of those people needed to actually SEE her and HEAR her. They won‚Äôt listen to her speeches most of the time. Biden makes so few it‚Äôs ridiculous and we know why. He will be forced to show his incapacity in a debate.
On Covid-19, Biden doesn‚Äôt have any new ideas. On climate and the economy, his ideas are liabilities, writes  We must re-elect ‚Å¶ !  But that‚Äôs not enough. Help me give ‚Å¶ a House he can work with!
Speaking of  slandering  as a "racist", such a desperate move suggests the Biden campaign's internal polling must be showing them that #SleepyCreepyBasementDwellerQuidProDementiaJoe isn't running away with the election as they'd like you to believe.
will not debate  yesterday by declaring the President racist he laid the foundation to refuse. Biden's handlers know he hasn't the mental acuity to debate POTUS. The excuse will be some variation of not legitimizing racism; the truth will be cowardice.
How can people call this Biden‚Äôs America? Like it‚Äôs happening right now in Portland, and it‚Äôs starting in several other cities. We might be on different ends of the political spectrum, but if you stand up for your rights then this shouldn‚Äôt sit right with you.
The point of the debate is to see how your candidate holds up. Biden will not hold up. And no. They aren‚Äôt ‚Äú19th century‚Äù. They‚Äôve decided many Presidential elections over the years.There was a CNN story today that the Biden aides said the VP announcement was pushed back till appx the 10th now, when they had said around the 1st for a while now.   Is this why?  Were they leaning to Bass?

Trump has a 42.8% approval rating. He trails Biden by 8.4% on average in the polls nationally. Finally Trump trails Biden by 7.2% on average in Florida. I'm surprised that given 150,000 deaths so far due to Trump's mishandling of the pandemic his numbers aren't lower.
Joe Biden will rescue us from trump. You've done jack shit for America and even less for Florida.

Before Obama paid to have this virus brought to this country we had the best unemployment numbers in history and will again as soon as Trump is re-elected. This country is gone if Biden were elected...but the people of this country will not let that happen.
Oh shut up...your husband should be in jail for spying on Trump‚Äôs campaign. The evidence is very clear that Obama &amp; Biden was running the show. They BOTH had and have no business being in our government. The people are tired of your lies and corruption.

They're losing just about everybody except for the Biden voters that are trashing our cities. But there's plenty of fraud votes combining illegals and dead people to make up the loss.

Ok, lets go:  1. The two party system will FOREVER be bullshit if we continue for ANY REASONS other than proposed POLICIES  2. YOU cannot frame yourself as a ‚Äúresponsible voter‚Äù by supporting someone with an such an anti-progressive track record as Joe Biden

My bigger concern about Warren is what happens to her Senate seat if Biden wins. MA has a GOP governor and seems highly likely he would appoint another Republican to fill Warrens seat if she became VP and if Dems take the Senate back this year, it's not going to be a huge margin.
Honestly, my bigger concern about Warren as VP is her empty Senate seat if Biden wins. Massachusetts has a Republican governor and you know he'll appoint a Republican to fill her vacancy and if the Dems retake the majority this year, it's not going to be a huge majority.

Chip in to elect Joe Biden
For the first time, Biden has started to pass the 50 percent mark in Florida polls.  Biden carries a 6.8-percentage-point lead over incumbent President Donald Trump.

I told him that if Assange is extradited while Biden‚Äôs President that Glenn would probably be right behind him. Then he tried to flip it around on me that I wanted him jailed simply because I disagree with him. I was like F you, I think you may have committed crimes.
Silver alert, someone tell Joe Biden where he is...
Biden has already shown he‚Äôs tougher on China than trump. In January, Biden called for us to be tough on China &amp; demand transparency from Xi on coronavirus...at the same time trump was (checks notes) doing nothing but calling it a hoax &amp; praising Xi for doing a great job.
I can tell you in St. Pete, FL we still have an over abundance of upper middle class white women supporting the Fuckopotamus Orange Shitgibbon.   ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ We must vote this Nov like Biden is behind, we cannot assume victory! #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

You elect biden
Maybe but you will be a albatross around Biden's  neck. At least you agree with locking up black people for small offences.
This president is for "freedom for himself" to do whatever he chooses. Joe Biden is NOT a socialist...he is a moderate.
Well her and Hunter Biden anyway
Joe Biden could shoot somebody on Fifth Ave. and he wouldn't lose any votes. So drop the pro Kremlin Andrii Derkach info..it matters not.
Nate Joe Biden will never be President of the United states.  Never.
I so hope Biden is elected because once Assange in extradited I'm betting we're gonna get a "twofer" with you as well. You don't just want Trump to get reelected, you need him to get reelected. I can't believe I thought you and Matt and the Intercept were gonna advance journalism
Exactly when did you start working for the Biden campaign??
Biden sucks. Vote for Biden.
Who cares what Nunes has on Biden . Joe Biden could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and still not lose votes. He could be in pictures with pedophiles Epstein and Maxwell and no one would care.Biden could extort an ally to gather dirt on Donald Trump, Congress would say It's OK.
If you‚Äôre voting for Biden, you ain‚Äôt a republican.
We will once  again  have a president who can speak  in complete sentences!!  #WeWillVote  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #Biden
Biden may be unfit for the Presidency. trump is unfit for humanity.
What is most interesting is her association to the U.N. and a growing speculation that Biden's mental health is worsening.  Though the Democrat leadership sees it as not an issue now, within 8 months if elected they will decide it is an issue.  If Biden steps down who becomes VP?
So you think Joe Biden is better deal ? I hope he remembers he's running for president that's the best candidate that the Democrats could come up with. I want somebody who is not in cognitive decline to be the president of the United States. #TRUMP2020
But Biden though????
She harbored a Chinese spy for years. Biden sold influence to, China to enrich Hunter. He extorted the Ukraine. Wow you liberals sure can pick them.

Joe Biden shoepeg corn pop for his VP.
So Biden was correct to predict that the Liar in Chief would bring it up? trump's entire presidency - every lie, every drop of his epic incompetency - is ripe for a 'scathing denunciation.'

Another chance for me to remind you folks Qanon will have plenty candidates in 2022 wanting GOP nominations, looking to get in on the action of a would be anti-Biden midterm
Is the press in the United States aware that hey free and unbiased press is not tolerated in socialist countries. That means the idiots in the media that are pushing people to vote for Biden which means a vote for socialism will very shortly after the election will not exist!
In fact, even if Biden wins in November, MOST of his support is likely to be a combination of working class and minorities. College educated whites will not make up a majority of the Dem coalition anytime soon. 2/2
The Black and Latino working class will still overwhelmingly back Biden, though. Those groups are critical to the Dem coalition and Biden wouldn‚Äôt come close to winning without them.  Either way, current polling is showing a shift toward Biden in the WWC as well. 1/2
You and about a million other people have done it too. But it can be done with Biden, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc. Know why? Because politics is all the same game just different players.
Are you going to apologize to Joe Biden, now?
They call our president unwell and crazy yet Joe Biden is in the basement with a bib.
That's a lie. Biden has committed to 3 debates. Also, tRump stumbles every time he speaks in public. His grammar is atrocious. You must not pay too much attention to him when he speaks.
And he will run ( or one of his devil spawn) again in 2024 and blame Biden for not solving all the issues he created
Hunter Biden is an American citizen and as such has no place on your agenda.
Make that two. I wanted Warren to run in 2016 and I supported her in 2020. I voted for Hillary and I'll be voting for Biden.
You're right. It's divisive. I'm a lifelong Democrat. In 2016 I voted for Bernie and then Hillary in the general. I voted for Warren in the recent primary, and I'll vote Biden in November.
Lock him in and move Biden to Pelosis' office
The swamp just threw up Joe Biden like an old piece of baked Just Fishing just to see what they can get the big fish or in 2024.
Racial propaganda from that video clip would make me think the black population in MT rose by 5000% overnight. The same b.s. Trump did against Biden with the old lady on a 4 hour hold with 911 while her house was being broken into. Tap into white fear. Smh.

yeah if Trump was denying President Bernie I'd be lacing up my boots but Biden? lol
Some reports have named Chris Dodd as the ringleader of this obnoxious campaign against Harris.  Biden needs to get rid of him as an advisor on VP if he wants to win in 2020.
I find it astounding that Biden does not go over 47% in any of these matches. This is why we can't count Trump out yet.
So wait, Biden supports expunging marijuana arrest records but doesn't support legalization?    I guess we'll just keep arresting people and then expunging the arrest records?
What are you guys talking about? Is Biden POTUS? Does he have powers of executive orders? Is he a senator? Biden doesn‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs at. He will do what his owners tell him to do. Nothing is more clear than the Democrat party is now openly a communist party.
If Biden wins it‚Äôs AOC‚Äôs party.
Kamala Harris lost my confidence in her when she used a bussing issue to paint Biden as if he was complicit with that issue. SHE HAD TSHIRTS ALREADY MADE AFTER THAT DEBATE. That's was cruel and inconsiderate of those who fought and died dealing with that  #WarrenorRice

Easy and convenient to elect Biden.  Don‚Äôt fall for it FL- need in person voting for a fair election.  Verify ID to the person voting.  Unbelievable that you can vote in states like CA WITHOUT photo identification!!!

He‚Äôs only trying to take the focus off of the terrible GDP number that came out this morning. Only Congress can change Election Day and just because Trump Is so far behind  Biden, he thinks he in his sick head thinks he can do this. Vote Blue all the way!
are you all ready to take to the streets to defend your right to vote for Joe Biden?  yeah, me neither
Many people say you haven‚Äôt done yours and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre voting for Joe Biden.
Fact is there are alot more registered democrats than registered republicans. The anti Trump vote will far surpass the vote for Biden vote. Biden can become president if he goes more center.
Pro tip, shadow campaign is not the term you should use when writting anout white men trying to stop a black women from getting a job. Looks weird
would you prefer a 'whole bowl of shit''? if you're not for Biden, you're for trump. not hard. at least he has a chance; Bernie had none maybe try to get over it.

These are the things Americans should know about Biden. Of course he won‚Äôt be in office long but his Vice President going to have the same ideas?
Biden will select whom he feels will help him carry out his agenda.
No no it‚Äôs true what Trump did. Obama and Biden had their own plan AFFH. If you don‚Äôt believe look it up. That is what Trump and Ben Carson got rid of.

Whhhaattt
Yeah Biden might not be the most exciting candidate, but that's not what it's about. It's about electing a candidate that has experience and policies that can effect our lives in a positive way. A lot of people don't vote for candidates with their best interests in mind.
Didn't Biden apologize for all that, and not supporting the gay marriage thing ?  ü§£üòÇüòÖ
Well, not to be morbid, but Joe Biden is 77, and Donald Trump is 74, so maybe their vice presidential picks are more important than usual for a reason.
Am the only white woman I know in Fla for Biden
Interesting thought but I don‚Äôt think that that would cause republicans and independents who were already voting for Biden to not do so.
Strikingly similar article to the one written in April about   the mad libs version of the VP whisper game.  'Joe Biden allies quietly working against (insert woman's name), claiming she is too (insert an otherwise complimentary adjective).'
. How's this?
Followed all
Who seriously thinks Biden is going to even [cognitively] make it through his first term?
Sounds like she's the best candidate if she's the only one getting smeared. Reminds me of all the Biden smear attempts that have tried &amp; failed.  Dodd's bs about Karen Bass also smacks of racist tone policing, of wanting a less assertive BIPOC woman. #fuckthatshit
I doubt people would be trying to malign her if the GOP weren't scared of her - kinda like all the attempts at smearing Biden ü§î
The VP pick isn't going to debate Trump for Biden ? No doubt every mind is made up.  I'm 'VOTING AGAINST' Biden and 'FOR TRUMP' this election.  Unlike before, I 'VOTED AGAINST' HRClinton and had NO OPTION but Trump.  Most Dems are not VOTING FOR Biden, just VOTING AGAINST Trump.
He Kisses Biden on the mouth
I am fearful where this is going. Joe Biden doing a Grass Roots event with Elizabeth Warren on Friday. If he passes Kamala over, it is going to speak VOLUMES about him as a human being. Still voting BLUE, and maybe God has a perfect plan for Kamala that doesn't involve a man!
Don't like Biden. Don't like Kamala. But I really don't like the orange.
That's just one poll. Others have Biden up by more. Regardless, I'm sure as hell submitting my vote if I have to crawl across a mile of broken glass.
The Elephant in the room of course is I'd be shocked if Biden actually runs for re-election in 2024 if he doesn't choke 2020 away. Picking a running mate that could be the party's standard bearer after him isn't a crazy idea

Dems tied themselves up in the bad messaging of the protestors* and are going to have to try hard to distance them from it.  Biden currently feeling that pain, imo.   *I agree w/protestors on police brutality and systemic racism.  Just saying their messaging/solutions are wrong.
Yes, they've been ongoing, that's my point.  They are now dragging out with no purpose, and people who were (rightly) outraged about police brutality are now wondering what the point is.  Meanwhile, the left bought into "defund the police" slogan, whether Biden onboard or not.
Let's also not forget that he once said certain de-segregation policies would lead to his children growing up "in a racial jungle".
Joe Biden is touted as a candidate that stands up for racial justice, BLM, etc. but people seem to forget about the 1994 crime law he helped write that lead to the injustices we see today against black and brown communities.
Apropos of criticizing partisanship in our City Hall:  If you vote for Biden, it doesn't mean you're a bad person. You're probably a Democrat.  If you vote for Trump, it doesn't mean you're a bad person. You're probably a Republican.  Mud-flinging can be fun, but it isn't reality

What they are doing is Joe Biden is a elderly abuse.
Joe Biden will select the most intelligent, the most ethical and the most judicial people for his cabinet. He will not surround himself with felons. Your cabinet members and your shadow people are always on a conveyor belt, in and then out the door.
This should be a CAKEWALK. Biden, whom the Democratic Party chose over all others because they believed him to be the best, should have double-digit leads in every mfing state. I mean, over the single most incompetent, ignorant, &amp; corrupt president in US history. Why doesn't he?
imho we need to get the party to the place where Biden, Pelosi, Clinton, etc not only are *not* making policy anymore, but are afraid to appear in public.
Trump winning is the path to the reformation of the Dem Party into something useful.   Biden winning means that the left gets locked out of Dem leadership and policy for at least another generation.

Yo, Biden is basically a sane Republican.
It's understandable because the police fate rest in the hands of Trump, If Biden wins the police agencies across the country will see their power diminished so much they will become nothing more than a investigation agency.
I hope it does, Biden's caretakers pose a bigger threat.

WTF  ! I watch five hours and you turn away to show Joe Biden! Disgraceful to show the hearing all day and turn away at the end..  You are becoming no better than CNN
Biden touting his foreign policy...LMFAO!
What‚Äôs your point? At least Biden has a list.
I‚Äôm ready for Biden to announce his VP pick so I can buy merch!! Give the people (me) what they want!
I'm actually relieved Fox cut to Biden ...actually "answering" questions...ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§£ü§£ü§£  #BidenPressConference
Biden Seeks to Win Senior Vote in New Ad Criticizing Trump's Handling of COVID-19  #ChristianNews
LMAO! Same format for Biden, like Hussein! All pre selected reporters and therefore studied questions! What a joke#
Biden is finally doing some easy softball questions that he obviously got ahead of time. What a joke!!
It is crap like this that will let Trump win. If BLM why would anyone of color, anyone with brains, anyone who loves this country, fall for this "Bernie bowl of shit". Biden is better than Trump. #VoteForOurLives #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 üá∫üá∏üåä
Biden's most underrated potential flip is ME-2. Everyone keeps assuming Trump will hold on to it but 2018 saw Dems win there, and the Dem Rep is IMO favored to keep the seat. Biden has lead the very scant polling we've had from the CD
While Biden is speaking, I wonder who the Democrats will run for President?
Biden doesn't just make sure you're clean and healthy, he'll sniff your hair for confirmation!
No, it isn't. So what justified PolitiFact in translating Biden's reference to home health into the different category of direct care workers?
Keep the eye on the prize, if she turns out voters for Biden, that is all that matters
Joe Biden plans to call for the Fed to play a bigger role in addressing racial economic inequality, demanding it look beyond its current economic focus  via
Big talk from Beijing Biden
Probably nobody cares that PolitiFact is giving a "True" to Biden based on cherry-picking a segment of the lowest-paid home health care workers.  "In the ballpark," therefore "True."  "Fact-checking."
A vote for Biden is a vote for an intelligent thoughtful administration and the healing of America.
Biden will make up his own mind. He was going to talk to Bass anyway bc she was there.  People have opinions and are free to share them. This is the American way
bs news, Polls don't mean jack.  LMAO Joke Biden has to come out of the basement sometime.  What a shocker coming from another bias msm outlet
Another good sign of where the race is? Mainstream forecasters snapping at each other on whether Biden is an 87% or 92% likely winner
Even more new polls today and I still see the same pattern. We're not having a discussion on whether Biden can flip back MI/PA/WI or even if he can win AZ/FL, we're instead debating his odds in GA/IA/OH/NC/TX thanks to tight polls there. Speaks volumes on where the race is rn
This is so frustrating. Bc this country will absolutely dissolve and take a lot more of us with it if he remains in office. But Dems provide zero inspiration or tangible policy to entice voters. Marketing Biden as simply anti-Trump &amp; heralding votership is going to end us all.
Comparing the Trump and Biden Tax Plans  -
ü§£ü§£ü§£ so sounds like trump making his plays well lmao $1200 Defly gone get him that vote unfortunately. If ppl had to choose take $1200 and vote trump or take nothing and vote Biden... guess what üò©
What's the o/u on Biden's popular vote margin?
Mushroom stamped. üòÇ
Biden isn't perfect but he cares and we don't have 2 prop up his ego. Trump is a 4yr disaster that will not do anything help the economy or stop the virus.
Yep. It‚Äôs like that shitty Trump ad saying Biden‚Äôs America won‚Äôt be safe. These are dangerous propagandists.
Serious question, if tRump dies during Biden‚Äôs presidency, would he give him a state funeral ? I think he would because of his character
that's right please, Make America Great Again after Trump destroyed it, so please vote for Biden and SAVE AMERICA
not endorsing Biden is about the dumbest fking thing you can do. congratulations on being a total zero of a representative of the Democratic Party.
It's doesn't matter, Trump's support base is small relative to Biden's as most are older, suburban or rural white boomers who have a pill calendar dispensers. We outnumber them and in November we'll outvote them too.
Of course did anyone expect differently.  Biden will have to survive sometime.
Everything you stated is true and if Biden is elected the American people except this reality, to some in the country this will be unacceptable but remember other Americans had to live for centuries under an intolerable situation that wasn't suitable for an animal.
Both Mike Pence and Joe Biden are expected to visit the late congressman as he lies in state.  via
That footage is totally your America.  Biden has zero in it
Joe Biden is the coach from Bad News Bears that the kids used as a fake chaperone as you recall before going to Houston Texas for a game.

And you are maybe more mentally challenged than Biden
We will, by voting for Biden!   #TrumpleThinSkin
Not hot Biden supporters
New York, Seattle, Portland Chicago,  how is that Democrat Mayor and Governor treating you?? Think Biden and more Democrats will fix it?? Or make it worse? You KNOW it will be worse...so I can give you and your crime spree city no sympathy!!
Nothing is going to anger me to the point that I will not be voting for Biden. My soul purpose on November 3 is to vote against Trump. I might not agree with many things in life, but I choose to control my thoughts and remain at peace.
No Biden will pick a VP that can win him an important State, like Florida.
Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol
Joe Biden will never be President of the United states #MAGA   Never.
Idiot, so CV19 makes that distinction... Just bc you "say good day" doesn't change hypocrisy of #Biden and the powerful... You're accepting that CV19 is not dangerous enuf to cancel a funeral and you don't mind diff rules for them... Good evening to you sir!
Biden/Marxist needs trouncing. So you want taxes raised (he promised that), you want more people  unemployed due to a un-green new deal, live in fear due to support of criminals.. Got it...
We've gotten so focused on whether Biden could pull off  states like GA/IA/NC/OH/TX that it feels like we don't talk much about what a nice lead he has in the three states that made Trump Prez
Weird MN numbers but other than that nothing but shifts towards Biden in every other state here and look they found him ahead in GA and TX, not to mention really nice leads in MI/PA/WI
if it seems like a new person is in the top running for Biden‚Äôs VP every other day that‚Äôs because the campaign is using the news stories to gauge public opinion
The person who Biden needs to dump is Chris Dodd.  Just an old white man bent out of shape that a woman might be in a position of power that he was never able to achieve.  How did he even get on the vetting committee with his shady past?  Dump Dodd!
Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol  It's probably best. We don't need anymore needless photo ops. Using the flag and Bible were two to many.
When Joe Biden becomes President, I will be going on vacation and taking a month off from Twitter.
Nothing against Bass but she is not on the national radar.  Biden needs a strong, well-known woman VP, preferably a black woman.  Harris fits the bill.
It‚Äôs hilarious that you portray what Biden‚Äôs America will be and it‚Äôs actually your america now.  Wow your followers are weak minded
Please God, stop all of this and punish the wicked. The good people deserve peace and happiness. Amen PS, please get rid of these idiots for starts...  Nancy Pelosi, chuck Schumer,  Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Ocasio Cortez, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren
She is getting it ready for the Biden‚Äôs........by putting poison ivy in there.
No in fact Nadler is on tape saying  Antifa is a myth He should be put away with Biden they could babble at each other all day and night
I just watched the huge event for Biden at the Villages.  The Biden team in Tampa Bay is out everyday at corners waving and getting lots of honks
And Biden is competent? Rotflmao
Trump 2020, that's what I am telling people. If you want socialism and contr over American people then Biden is your guy. You want what is happening in pie and, New York and Chicago...then Biden is your guy.
Voting for Biden. Gonna crawl over glass to do it
Uh biden the oldest whitest man ever in politics is your standard bearer.  And that chart shows how democrats perpetually afraid of everything.  Now I would love to see a category called easily butt hurt.  Dems would win that one.
We could Daydream the Joe Biden will be president it'll never happen your dreams will be crushed the member 4th big Daddy will be your president for another four more years baby.!
No it isn't, that is exactly what biden has said. You democrats like all the rioting and looting. No one cares what you Hollywood elites say because you have guards and protection so y'all let the young liberal crybabies carry on.
Hey Nancy, did Joe Biden sniff you while you were in the Capitol Rotunda.

Three years ago today, Republicans voted to repeal Obamacare and throw millions off of health insurance. Thank god it didn‚Äôt pass. Now we have the opportunity to elect Joe Biden, flip the Senate, and expand the house, so we can strengthen the Affordable Care Act. #100DaysToGo
If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù -Joe Biden
hahaha like Biden could pull that off.
It‚Äôs so obvious, yet for some reason Biden is seriously considering Rice. Duckworth is far and away the best choice and I‚Äôve thought this from the start. I‚Äôm losing hope at this point, though.
Because Biden got the nomination. There were so many more progressive candidates and we ended up with Biden. Perhaps he can help unite the party and move it left in increments.
#TheFive ...as being an excellent choice. Attention: USA , right and left, whoever this candidate may very well be the next President , especially if 78  yr old Joe Biden keels over with a heart attack after giving up his 5 minutes too many times during his debates with Trump.. .
Biden leads. Biden is sane. Biden knows what suffering is.
What's amazing about Joe Biden is, in almost every story about him and his dealings with other people his profound sense of decency and humanity always shines through.
Great  news Stay safe your state his high covid cases repug  governors  guess Lmao charlie baker is voting biden . So is  bush family tons repugs colin powell, James  comey, robert mueller
Don't believe any POLLS....just keep going forward...I'm in Fla and the old white folks here are scared to death of Biden and the black rioters the watch FOX all day
I knew it was coming but I'm still pretty fucking devastated...my second wish for 2020 was a Trump/Biden debate üò≠
Biden doesn‚Äôt need to debate. Just let the moron give his daily coronavirus screed. He‚Äôll get Biden elected

WHEN Biden wins and is declared the winner on thec4th of November the secret service and military need to be ready to haul #TraitorTrump out and install Pence until January. tRUMP needs to be lockedxaway until charges from NY let him be jailed.
should not feel remorse. Politicians don't have to be perfect. They have to be able to answer for what they have and will do.
They actually we're saying that Trump never has laid out a plan,   WTF world do these cartoon character s live in, as the alternate reality of Biden speaking about all the programs, and big plans he would change to save his Version of USA!  OMG!  One Debate would destroy Biden!
Did anybody really listen to "Meet the Press" yesterday!  What reality do these people live in!  Where do they find them!  Who writes their talking points!  This is the craziest thing that they are even talking about a Candidate( Biden) that we never see! Homecare?
How can anybody talk about Biden with a straight face!  This pandemic would be the only way the "Network" movie board could stay in power, with one Earthly Lord that is "Greed" in the Flesh! Joe Biden hides, with no policy! None! Biden talks about real problems "Homecare"?Loser
All the Warren stans (me) and khive people fighting each other about who should be vp while Biden picks Susan Rice‚ù§Ô∏è
It s a set up , fir steakhouse Ng the election, so they can say that Biden was ahead the whole time! Reagan and Clinton won their second terms from start to finish, and listening to these *Meet the Press" liars and deceivers makes me want to p...s on journalists!
Who believes that Biden is up by 12 points in the many, many polls!  Barf!  Anyone that doesn't know that the scam us in, and anyone voting for the stumbling, rumbling Biden, make me sick in my stomach by the bullcrap News Polling showing Biden with sizable lead

In hindsight, the biggest problem with HRC in 2016 was that the Republicans against trump could not get behind her to defeat him. Biden doesn't share that weakness.
Well, it is nice of her to get it ready for the Biden‚Äôs. üòÇü§£
Joe Biden agreed to a woman VP. Now, it's a black woman. Everyone need to leave Biden alone and allow him to select the person he will be able to work with to restore America.
John McLaughlin being Trump's most trusted pollster makes me wanna congratulate Biden already
A step up from a flaming hot asshole still means you get burned.  In addition to legalization &amp; releasing nonviolent prisoners, Biden must redirect a lot of that police war chest to rehab ctrs, halfway houses, &amp; community officers trained in de-escalation. #CriminalJusticeReform
I know, it‚Äôs so sad to see Biden making shit up like when he said the NAACP has always endorsed him.
People I love have died of treatable medical conditions for lack of ability to pay exorbitant sums of money, which is a situation that Biden and Biden voters are fine with perpetuating.
Biden's a few points ahead, but that chart is scary, after 3 years of probably a hundred crimes, abuses, and graft by Trump to be only a few points ahead of him I am utterly amazed PLEASE VOTE!!!!!!! OUR COUNTRY COULD NOT STAND ANOTHER 4 YEARS
Really?  Joe Biden was asked what HE would have done differently from  with regards to #covid19.  The six things he mentioned were ALL done by President Trump and his Administration over the last few months.  EVERY ONE OF THEM!  Eat your failure!  Blame #GOVERNORS
He definitely has a chance. Anyone who would vote for a diminished Biden will vote for anything
Biden can RUN but he cant hide...  Oh wait CARL GIVES him a pass  WHY? because Carl us a sore loser
Will there be a provision fir Biden‚Äôs team to take over the COVID19 response immediately after the election due to the extraordinary circumstances? It would also signal to trump he needs to vacate.
Is that a picture of one of Biden's policy advisors? He would fit right in with Larry Summers, Jamie Dimon, and Rahm Emanuel.
AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
Biden and his cronies can't afford to display his utter incompetence on that show. People thought Trump was bad? If they put Biden on, the whole country will lose faith in the two-party system.

Biden needs to be in a nursing home and you will never be president mrs Clinton

People like you that spread lies about innocent men should be prosecuted, that‚Äôs very dangerous! Now why don‚Äôt u talk about Tera Reade who Biden sexually assaulted, she reported to Congress, but they said they won‚Äôt release the papers! Her mother even called Into Larry king
yeah, vote fort racist Biden, you must be black enough
Biden isn't going to close the child prisons. You should research your candidate.
Biden opposes an eviction moratorium.
I see no reason to believe that Biden's administration will be any different than Biden's campaign or his career; it will focus on defeating any and all leftist goals.  That's why Biden has to lose.
How do we know Ronna is lying? Her lips are moving!
They also need to be better at getting the message out. I hear more about Biden moving left from conservatives pushing red scare tactics than I do from left &amp; liberal spaces.
That is because Biden is Obsequious, the Dems. Are raising money for the lobotomy, or doesn't obama care pay for that.
If #Biden/#Marxists win election, we will never have fair-ish elections again. The leaders of the left are now VERY RADICALIZED.üíî  üíñ You're a nice person, we need people like you to recognize the danger of a recycled "National Socialist Party." This is NOT old #Democrat party.!
Same. Once again, we have no choice. Once again, we're informed we must "fall in line", and then we'll be allowed to "push Biden left", as if that's ever going to happen--he himself has said it won't! You can see why people lose hope.
Just Google "Occupy protests". Google "Ferguson protests" &amp; "Black Lives Matter protests".  All took place when Biden was VP.  That's how a Biden admin *did* respond, then. He has said nothing to indicate he'd do things differently.
He'll try. He already claimed that Obama and Biden stopped testing too soon.
Wow, more ammo for the Biden campaign.

Me when I remember Joe Biden is gonna announce his VP pick this week
I always found it suspect that Biden was pushed as the frontrunner before he even announced.  Biden was the one Trump already knew he'd be facing--hence his whole Ukraine scheme long before Biden announced.  Hard not to regard the whole Dem primary process as bullish*t theatre.
Lol he didn't appreciate me calling him illiterate one time when he was going on an...well...an illiterate rant against Soledad O'Brien. Dude is a nut case. And I happen to know from lots of professional contacts that he's always been a world class prick at work.
Why he is supporting Biden. He should stay with Cali. The land of the lost
1.  is repeating a zombie lie here. An easily disproven one.  2. Bernie more than held up his end. What more does she--or anyone--expect him to do when BIDEN HIMSELF will not commit to any policies that are important to young voters?  They already know "Orange Man Bad".
They did not make a statement about Biden; they made it clear that they are as cruel and evil as the original nazi murderers.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

I agree Joe if biden wins America is screwed
The GOP has become a number of factions each with their own priorities but in general the establishment gets the final say.  But the Dem party has overwhelmingly gone far left with prominent members saying if you don't go along you are out in the cold.  Need I list Biden quotes?
Oh you mean like how you liberals worship biden
Even in a best case scenario where Biden is the 1st Prez since Dubya in 02 to come into a midterm popular, the Economy is rocking, and Dems don't see a bad midterm (Basically 98 all over again) its hard to see how a guy who does well w/ Trump hating Latinos in the state loses

No, he is thinking that when he refuses to leave the White House after he loses the election nobody will be able to come in and get him. Biden said he would use the military if need be to get him out so that fence is useless.

So, driving home from work I see like 6 Trump bumper stickers. Then I thought, I don‚Äôt think I have ever even seen a Biden sticker.
This law was NOT an Obama-Biden, thus was signed into law in 1968 by Johnson!
It is the perfect excuse for any American to oust the moron in the White House vote Joe. Biden
True all trumps people are behind bars and the ones who lied to cover trump and Barr are releasing them!  How pathetic!  Joe Biden knows how to get things done with transparency so everyone knows what is really happening
Beyond me how anyone can stand there with a straight face a want to vote for Biden
Biden hat brain surgery TWICE in 1988. At the time his neurosurgeon gave him 50% chance of full recovery!
Just a thought, can you remember at any time a presidential candidate not going on TV or major speaking engagements before an election? Why is Joe Biden hiding so much?
I think you might want to retake that test or test your campaign advisors. No one believes flipping Joe Biden is a radical left anything. lol
It‚Äôs all scripted.  He‚Äôs picking the reporters of a piece of paper.  Good luck debating Trump!  Biden‚Äôs team is going to do everything they can to get out of it.
I would believe them before I would believe you.   When you stop lying in your ads about Joe Biden, I might start believing you,  but probably NOT, BUNKER BOY

Watched Joe Biden give a press conference even answering questions  It is very evident he has been well coached and told what to say and how to say it  Make no mistake that Bernie Sanders is pulling the strings and is in control

Barack Obama, ‚Äúvoting by mail‚Äù is the only way Biden can become President.   #RigTheElection
Barack Obama do you really believe that Biden as a president could make a difference?    His memory is suffering BIG TIME and so will the USA if he gets elected.
Only chance is to work thru this election with Biden and see what we can repair/grow in 2021 onward. Until the big $$ is out, a la Citizens United case, no 3rd party will have a chance.
Juan, And you‚Äôre helping.   I‚Äôm sure Biden would do a much better job from his basement!  I‚Äôm beginning to think Juan that you‚Äôre not all there.
They show footage of tRumps America and says this will happen if Biden is elected?
This says Biden +3 in Florida.  Just last month Biden was +9.
So I'm here in Floriduuuuh and every 5 mins Trump's ad about Biden defunding the police comes on, the one with the old lady calling 911...  is the voice over... "Listen carefully"  I hate politics in this country. This should be illegal.  üò†
I‚Äôm still pissed that Joe Biden had the audacity to say that Trump is the first racist president. Just so he knows, if any of us vote for him it‚Äôs because we we loathe Donald Trump but we have our eyes on him. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
If you‚Äôre a so-called media expert, then you would know that the minute Biden names her to the ticket, Trumps people put out a flood of commercials with her questioning Biden‚Äôs mental capacity during the Democratic primary debates. She cannot be the choice for VP. period.
Anti trump Republicans taking over the Dem party is a good thing...if they help Biden win, we get rid of trump AND destroy the establishment Dem party at the  same time...then in 2024 we elect AOC president  üòä

I‚Äôll vote when you join Biden as VP. You are the ONLY candidate to guarantee Trump‚Äôs demise. Harris went too negative on his ‚Äúcognitive‚Äù abilities in the debates, Demings &amp; Mayor Bottoms do NOT have the political background to be VP. Susan Rice is a lightning rod for the GOP...
I will vote when you say you will join Biden‚Äôs ticket as VP. YOU are the ONLY guarantee that he can win in November. If you really want Trump gone, then please do our country this service. Please.
Joe Biden will!
Osama Bin Laden wants Joe Biden to win.
Xi Jingping owns Joe Biden.
Terrorists and ANTIFA want Joe Biden to win.
ISIS wants Joe Biden to win.
Biden would never choose a progressive as VP. If he does pick Warren, it'll either confirm her centrist status, or her willingness to compromise her progressive beliefs for political power.
The immediate danger of this administration and the GOP enablers is far deadlier to people than Joe Biden will ever be ..  That's the truth.
Well if it‚Äôs true so what. I‚Äôd really like to vote for Bernie, but since I hate trump with every molecule üß¨ of my being, I‚Äôm voting for Biden. Get that monster out of the office first, then find better candidates next.
Most of the arguments against Biden are arguments against the system.  So change the system.  If you burn it down you have NO IDEA what could rise up to replace it.  And looking at the #fascist state of the #gop these days I've got a good idea what's rising up. And it's WORSE

I'm sick of all the false equivalencies and purity.  Biden sucks. I wanted Bernie.   But come on  Think logically. We can't have 4 more years of this dumpster fire. And Biden can be used IF we keep up the pressure and elect a lot more progressives.
Followed...from another "small" Biden supporter
Claiming that Biden has done "nothing" for black communities his entire career is disingenuous. No one has done much of anything for black communities. Minorities don't vote Dem because of welfare. They vote Dem because of federal laws. States rights is what made slavery possible
Biden against steel production? Prove Biden said he'd cut back on steel production.  You can't because it isn't true. Just like "you won't be safe in Bidens America" campaign. You are lying. You are fear mongering for your base.  Video of violence is from Trumps America today
The idea that "nothing will change" under Biden is bullshit.  It's only true if people just lie down after he is elected.  I don't think that's going to happen.  #voteblue

Well Trump will only get one in Maine and while he has a shot at Minnesota I think it will got for Biden in the end. (Unless Minneapolis goes even crazier... then Trump wins it. Good effort! Good forecast!
Chris Wallace should‚Äôve said he was Chuck when he asked Biden!  He might have agreed.
Biden has to have questions in advance so his writers can give him answers.  Same with debates. He will not debate Trump normally will use Covid as excuse
"We have enough tests IF we use them in the right way". In other words there isn't enough testing capacity. Why is the rest of the world getting back to normal, yet we can't we mitigate the spread, so we CAN get back to normal. If Biden gets elected that's on you

We need every vote this time for Biden to make a huge win Trump and not ignore, AND take down the GOP in both houses.
Understood. And young voters are the smallest voting group. The older, the more likely to vote. Any one not voting for Biden votes for Trump.

You should make a mock debate, questions that have been asked to Trump by reporters- he could answer live then show a recorded response by Biden and Trump can respond to that...

You'll see. The day after the election you'll never hear about COVID or Coronavirus ever again. Especially if Biden wins.
Biden helped bring in the ACA. Trump keeps trying to destroy it and replace with...nothing...
This is why I feel it is imperative that Joe Biden chooses a strong VP candidate. We know he is choosing a woman. We also know Joe is a bit old.   If Biden wins this Nov. he should step aside in 2024 hopefully leaving us a strong woman candidate next time around.

Methinks you exaggerate a bit
He siad that? Really? Got a source?
He knows. It's up to us in 2021 to set the future. He's no blocker.
Wrong. You do not keep up with his announcements. Green New Deal, big $ for child care, infrastructure, job programs, education, healthcare etc.
Are you a peeping tom?  How do you know they don't wash their hands. Are you just losing your mind like Joe Biden
Bernie had his shot. There are a handful of AOCs. Slow progress is coming. This election is a chance for real chance to change. And for the change to come, you have to get much of the dirty$$$ we have now in politics. Biden and a Dem congress can do that. Then we have a chance
I bet Biden figures there are more votes to be gotten in the middle states then marginal young voters. again, anyone not voting is a fool
Quiz answer? Got any ideas? And what is your point? Biden has twice the lead Clinton ever did, people know Trump is trash, but help Biden win. PS Clinton lost on a fluke, winning by 2.8 million.
You never answered the quiz--last progressive candidate... Meanwhile,
So what? That is a state level deal. Beat Trump first. Restore the rule of law, corruption, corrupt judges, first. Then get piddling issues like that. NO ONE has had a more progressive platform than he does. Bernie signed good agreements with him. Beat Trump. Biden is key.
And don't lose sight this is a moderate country overall. Biden got twice as many votes as Bernie.
I disagree. If push comes to shove, they'll gladly give up their seats to run for President if it means stopping Biden and the radical Left from taking power.
Haley: Biden Would Reverse All the Gains Made by Trump in Israel and the Middle East

An organized gang attacked a 14 year old girl and the trumpers think it‚Äôs grand.   We need Biden‚Äôs America a hell of a lot more than we need trump‚Äôs.
Biden will fix what you ruined.
Biden is not choosing anyone, his puppet masters are. Let's get the facts straight
The silent majority are the Republicans who are voting for Biden
I want Kamala to be the pick, but as of right now the only way Biden could lose me would be to pick Nina Turner, and then I'd probably hold my nose and eat that bowl of crap.  We have to remove trump, period.

Good piece on why there was no blue wave in Fla in 2018 and whether Biden can take the state this year. The answers are found in Miami-Dade County.

They defended him and hid it all and laughed.   They all defended Joe Rogan.  The bros attacked Hillary, Kamala, Biden, John Lewis etc. etc. etc. etc. with lies.  They were going to throw chairs at freaking Barbara Boxer - a legend of the congress.  They are all toxic af.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
This election is like Star wars. The Socialists ie Democrat left wing are the empire trying to destroy the rebels. The rebels are the Republicans refusing to surrender to the left wing socialists. Pelosi ie Vader and Biden the emperor want the rebels wiped
Biden/Harris is going to win via a landslide!
Miami newspaper just published a confidential letter signed by 90+ leaders within Democrat Party of Florida. The letter was to the Biden campaign about his Florida ground game was in disarray.
I live in Eastern Central Florida and haven't seen a single Biden yard sign... Not 1.
You can beat Biden off? I‚Äôm sure.
Republicans don‚Äôt care how many kids republicans rape. You conscience is tied to your political ideology. Same with women. Someone accuses Biden and ‚Äúlisten to women‚Äù until a woman accuses Tucker and then it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI stand with Tucker‚Äù. It‚Äôs pathetic.
What?  That is not how it works.  If they don't vote fairly regularly they get scrubbed off the voter rolls.  The registered voters in this state are fairly regular.  And they will vote for Biden over trump...
We know if Biden is elected these LEOs will be assaulting gun owners' homes w/ flash bangs, tear gas &amp; live rounds to "hell yes we're going to take them all." They'll instantly stop being "Trump's stormtroopers" &amp; morph into "Biden's anti-terrorism task force" while you cheer. /1
Central Florida Biden vs Trump donations.    Daytona is neutral.  Ormond Beach is once again for trump, as expected.
You tout your rosebud for the DSA and you are all faux socialists.  You know nothing more than spoiled ignorant cosplay nasty key board warriors.  Go volunteer for the Dem party and make sure Biden wins.
If that is your standard how can you vote for biden?  How many bankers in the Big O‚Äôs adminisration?  How many that lie about their heritage?
That's because they are sheep they can't think for themselves and are to lazy and unwilling to research the truth &amp; facts Mark. DEVIDEN BIDEN Ba"Ba"Ba"
47 years of wasted taxpayer dollars and nothing but problems to show for it unless your Biden relative,  DEVIDEN BIDEN
45YEARS of NOTHING DONE BUT SELLING OUT AMERICANS, THATS DEVIDEN BIDEN!!!
They keep telling Biden but he forgets by the time he gets to the podium.
There is also no chemistry.  Warren attacked Obama and Biden constantly and she said he was running in the wrong primary, etc.  Long bad history.  They do not have common ground.
I'm going down to Democratic headquarters tomorrow to try to buy a Biden yard sign to go with my Dump Trump yard sign.I think asswipe may have trouble in Florida. Yay, about time the old farts woke up.
I don't see her happening.    She is 74 years old for starters and Biden made comments about bridges to the future generations.
I truly think that is going to move closer for us.   Kasich for Biden at the convention.  Lincoln Project and RVAT have split the state between them to put boots on the ground and ads targeting trumpers.  It is a state that is going to be heavily targeted by NeverTrumpers...
Charlamagne tha God slams Biden for calling Trump 'first' racist president  via
Trump's job approval is at an average of 42.2% and he's trailing Biden in the polls nationally by almost 9% according to Real Clear Politics.
Trump likely found out he is suffering from dimentia so now he has to say that Biden has it. Can I get a covfefe with that salad, btw?
I want a - I'm a Republican - Not a Fool -Biden 2020 yard sign. Any idea where to get 2?
Time to just say it.  The looney left socialist so called squad are as anti American as anyone can be.  Country destroying lunatics.  God bless America üá∫üá∏ if it can survive, it will not under Biden.

Ok. I am convinced..All Democrats are Jackasses..well if he is gonna place a label of untruth upon an opponent, maybe I can place a label of truth to counterpoint his bullyboy tactics..Biden is a Pedophile..there, it is..own it, cuz the video evidence supports this conclusion
LP has: produced viral ads, fast response to news. trolled trump/got under his skin. supported Biden and downtickets. TV ads + boots on the ground. Social media/Books/Print. Venomous, talented. Burned boats, bridges. Humor helps! NeverTrump since 2015. Smart and inside knowledge
The LP's stated goal is to burn the GOP to the ground.  That is something they want now, and I have wanted for decades.  I am thankful for them, they are true allies in our goals this year - defeat trump, elect Biden and take our country back from racist idiotic lunatics.

bozo the clown just cancelled the convention in Jax.  It was doomed from the get-go.  At this point even if Biden chose Rosanna Roseanna Dana we would all vote for them.

Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary
Ridiculous and obnoxious that this kind of misogyny is still rampant.  is an outstanding and qualified VP candidate.  should definitely pick her. #KamalaHarris #joebiden #BidenHarris2020 #Biden #kamala
Why is Biden even listening to this dinosaur?
Yes goodbye to the corrupt leadership mistakes of Trump and his selfish lies and killing of our Americans lives with his terrible leadership of the Virus epidemic! We need Biden to help get our Democracy back to the people first ! Please Vote üó≥  Senate to become Dem majority üó≥
New ad campaign?  Will it be scarier than the last one?   Will it be more frightening to those already afraid of The Other?  Will it paint Joe Biden as the devil incarnate whose evil minions are coming to rape your daughters and steal your wives?  If not, why not?
I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??

The republicans can build the wall as long as they don‚Äôt accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
‚Å¶ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.

1. I'm going to frame this picture.   2. It's frustrating to read reports that people are actively working to prevent Senator  from being picked as Joe Biden's running mate. The most glaring reason is that they believe she is too ambitious.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump‚Äôs fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...

Hunter Biden got his big payday with no qualifications because of his last name. He is indicted in Ukraine and has other issues. If you and I did what he did we would be in prison right now.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
If Biden wins this election, this will be the third time in a row an elected Democratic President will have to clean up a huge economic disaster left by his Republican predecessor.
In November.........If we are not Riding with Biden we will "Dying with Donald"
This is correct...there were plenty of Obama stuff even more Trump stuff a little Hillary and nothing for Biden

Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn‚Äôt, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it‚Äôs overkill  saying all that Biden‚Äôs gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
The Democratic Party and the liberal media will continue to say that Biden is leading in the polls so when the dems actually lose but steal the election they will say  That trump was losing all the way up to the elections so of course he lost. MEDIA CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE
I checked I have over 400 friends for Trump 2020 vs. 19 Biden supporters

Look in this f****** piece of s*** he don't care about landlord he don't own properties I don't know if he's all the way up there you look like a mental case worse from Joe Biden look at the face who going to to help landlord to recover all the month of unpaid bill TK DickSanta's
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That‚Äôs the real question
I agree? But that‚Äôs not the topic here. It‚Äôs voting for Biden.  I‚Äôm not going back and forth on this.
That‚Äôs not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn‚Äôt VP.  That‚Äôs what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can‚Äôt even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I‚Äôve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We‚Äôve got nothing to discuss.
why do we have to chose between him or biden ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
You framed the question wrong. Shouldn‚Äôt it be, anyone afraid Kanye win the election or get more votes from both Biden and trump. No?
With its mismanagement of the Covid 19 response, this Administration hasn't shown the empathy for those lives lost during the pandemic. Seniors, especially, take note and vote for Joe Biden.

Of course Trump believes that someone with a terrible record of upholding punishments for false convictions would be a good VP pick for Biden given this country‚Äôs current political and social issues. It‚Äôs like a softball for him during any upcoming debates

Biden is going to win. Republicans are going to make it happen let's not forget the majority of the people who voted for him in 2016 are never Trumpers and people who didn't wanna vote for Hillary Clinton, Trump supporters focus on Biden and the American people focus on Trump
If Biden wins, he will be the 3rd Democratic President in a row that has had to go in and clean up a huge Republican economic mess.
Went to the beach 3 years ago n still got sand on my nuts lol I hate Joe Biden

What a disaster Biden was today .. lol
Trump supporters stay attacking Biden and this is why Trump is going to lose the election. it's the  people vs Trump, not Biden it's the millions of people who voted for Trump at the last minute, who didn't wanna vote for Hillary Clinton Biden is going to win
Y‚Äôall stay attacking Biden this is why Trump is going to lose the election. its the millions of people who voted trump in 2016 who won't vote for him again. It's the millions of Republicans who are sick and tired of trump lies and what he's doing to this country Biden is wining
Then do it and stop procrastinating! Vote trump! No commie nadler Schiff warren s Biden‚Äôs et al .
I love the Barr debates, it really shows what a bunch of idiots in the Democrat Party are trying to try and run this country . Thank God I am no longer a Democrat . Biden just said thank God  we must be alllowed to build this country , he did not add or burn it down
Based on the Anita Hill case, Biden being against busing, supporting the Iraq War and so on, I think the two are closer than you think on many of these.
Obama was even further to the right than Biden and had to be dragged into supporting gay marriage. A true leftist would in no way support drone strikes or indefinite border detaining
Biden is Reagan plus LGBTQ+ rights and abortion rights. They seem to agree on almost everything else (immigration, drugs, police, health care, foreign policy etc)
Barr is lying like Trump! Trump,Pompeo and Barr are pathetic liars who are just gaslighting this country to try and stay in power. We need an honest and non corrupt Administration! Vote Biden 2020

He said he was picking a black woman, not a fake indian, so unless she puts on blackface and fools him, warren wont be the vp...also Biden wont win...probably wont even run, watch out for Killary to take his spot by october.
If you werent so defensive youd realize we're saying to vote someone on the ballot and make an actual difference. If youre a Trump supporter just admit it. You dont have to hide vaguely behind "voting by my morals, which might be 3rd party or Trump, but definitely not Biden" lmao
You see? They got you. You really believe Biden is evil lmao. For what? Something he signed in the 90s?  No politician is perfect and you expecting them to be (or otherwise calling them evil) is a big problem in this country.
And yet Biden and eating shit are still better than Trump.
I‚Äôm sure your going to talk about Biden. What the hell do you know about this man. This is only your opinions and you have some nerve disparaging him with your bowl of sh- - remark.  No class lady.
I can't tell if you're saying that Trump matches your morals (racism?) or if you're going to throw your vote away to someone that hasn't done anything politically either, like you claim of Biden.
But you see what's happening right? Same as in '16. The right knows Trump is a piece of shit, so their goal is to make it seem like the other person is just as bad, therefore it's a coin flip for some voters.  Biden may be status quo, but Trump sets the country back 40 years
I'm voting by mail and I'm voting for Biden!  Done!!!!!!!
You want to fix the problems of America &amp; Foreign affairs. Joe Biden needs an all women cabinet!!! Kamala Harris Stacy Abrams AOC Susan Rice Elizabeth Warren Val Demings Keisha Lance Bottoms Muriel Bowser Lori Lightfoot Veronica Escobar Jenny Durkan  Gretchen Whitmer Karen Bass
Poll this AM shows Biden up only Three Points in Florida! Come on people! What do you need? He and his sycophant Governor and Senators are killing your friends and family, they want to reduce your social security and Medicare, etc. etc.  use your heads!
Did she ask Dr. Biden about this? I mean the Biden's will be living there soon.
Biden - you will suck up to anything in order to appease the needy so that you can get elected and then you‚Äôll do NOTHING
Been seeing a lot of tweets talking about when Biden wins in November. STOP IT. Stop it now! Let‚Äôs not get complacent. Remember a few years back when everyone assumed trump wouldn‚Äôt get into office? Let‚Äôs not have that again. Time to rally people!
Don't tell me, you've been talking to Joe Biden...
Hello Gov. You would be a terrific choice to be Joe Biden's running mate and I hope he selects you.  You have an impeccable background and you would do great things together.  Good luck!  In any event, the citizens of Rhode Island are proud you are their Governor.
I live in South Florida and the same, not one Biden sign anywhere
I agree. I am afraid if Biden picks an African American for VP there will be problems. trump is a bully. And there are a lot of racism that is underground. Hell, a lot of it is no longer underground.
Unfortunately, you and your pal at the WH cannot provide the leadership that our state need. We need people like Biden who are decent human beings that put the well being of the people before politics. Your neglect has costed thousands of lives that could have been saved.
Call it the Joe Biden ‚Äúenthusiasm gap.‚Äù  And this is from someone getting paid by Biden.  Polls? Right.  Wait until TRUMP clobbers him. üò¨
We don‚Äôt need to see Biden being interviewed. It‚Äôs more fun watching  Person Man Women Camera TV.  Stable genius
Then again I'm sober and I still wouldn't vote for Biden no way.
- this lady speaking about Biden is so wet behind the ears - She is right about 1 thing - BUDEN is going to need a smart VP because he is totally incompetent- Senile to the MAX
Why is this guy associated with the Joe Biden campaign? Straight up Corrupt.
There didn't seem to be a problem with Biden and Hussein in the same room, shootin the shit. ü§î
It's called respect.  Thank you President Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.
Cant belive how nieve people are not seeing how Biden is..hes a joke
I am not a Bernie supporter lady.  Sorry.    But thanks for finding that.  I don't see any super predator speak in it, but yea, Eff Bernie, and Biden and def HRC and their supporters.  Ok, now what?  I'm still not voting for Biden.  So ????  You want a cookie?  Just made some.
So?  What makes you think I'm a Bernie fan?  Because I said screw Biden?   SCREW BIDEN!  and HRC for going out with the super predator stuff.  Since you like Google.  Google me a video of ANYONE other than HRC, Biden, or Billy clint Clint being super douchie about it.
is kanye offering free hand jobs!! who else can beat off besides biden? will kim be there to watch? is that his election slogan. VOTE FOR KANYE, HE WILL BEAT YOU OFF 2020
I am about to make a prediction and you saw it here first. IF Biden picks Harris he will lose to Trump because as open minded as the dems think they are will NOT put another black person anywhere near the presidency.
Joe Biden....this is yo boy. Bad look....
And I'm proud to endorse you for Biden's SECRETARY of STATE! We need to clean up the mess Trump &amp; Pompeo have made of our international relations, which is just as critical as our domestic affairs.
And you dont listen.  I said I dont like nor support biden.  And I rightfully despise trump.
There is no truth to your rhetoric. Nice try, but I despise Clinton &amp; Biden You truly believe your side is 'right' while supporting an incompetent asshat like trump who procured underage girls from epstein.  Laughable. You're no different than catholic priests in your hypocrisies
I still think the DNC cheated Sanders it's no way Biden should have won Texas with no support there
Why bother?  Leave it for Jill Biden!
Of course not. Biden is Lambchop. The only question is to find out who is playing the political role of Sherry Lewis.
we'll ask president biden to look into it...

‚ÄúTrump is weak, Trump is not conservative,‚Äù Barkhuff said. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs the most easily fixable problem in America today. A vote for Joe Biden in this election is a vote for our Constitution.‚Äù
Biden found time to coach his late  son Beau's baseball team when he was a commuting senator!! Can you imagine Trump doing that??!!
Biden can't talk his way out of a paper bag! I'm terrified that Biden is going to possibly get another chance to implement Osama Obama's failed, self serving, America destroying policies! #Trump2020LandslideVictory
More if he gets a second term. He will get that. Too many ppl on the left think, why vote? I've got things to do. Someone else will do it. Then you just voted for Trump. Ppl have to vote Biden. And senators as well.
Been asking that since you became President. I guess we will have to wait until Biden takes over and the real investigations of your corruption begin.
Biden-Bottoms doesn't have a good ring to it
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Obviously ur not a true democrat bc if you were, you would be questioning A&amp; speaking out against Pelosi, Schumer, Waters and the idiots like AOC.  Biden is a puppet who can‚Äôt remember what office he‚Äôs running for, can‚Äôt remember his wife from his sister. He can‚Äôt remember shit!
Where is the justice for you ignoring the constitution, getting foreign governments to help you win an election, blackmaing Ukraine for dirt on Biden and obstructing investigations and telling admin to ignore subpoenas. So much for LAW &amp; ORDER!  Such a loser. No winning for you!!
Those who hate Trump are going to think that regardless.  The people who are undecided will side w/ Biden if he doesn‚Äôt restore order and side w/ Trump if he does.  Those who love Trump may jump off the Trump train if he lets this continue.  THERE ARE NO CONS TO RESTORING ORDER..
No worries, as soon as Biden is in office he'll be back to screaming about government overreach.
2/x Furthermore, I don't judge my candidates by who else is voting for them, but instead by their policies. There are actual violent Marxists who support Biden but I will only judge Biden on his political platform.
Reverse the polls saying Biden 62% and Pres 38 such BS

#Trump2020 Mr president you must win Florida send your best people. We can‚Äôt let Biden win
Is that why Biden is up in ALL polls!  You're going down DUMPY!
They will vote Biden because they want a leader who won't give up on America like you did. You couldn't handle the crisis America faced &amp; gave up Americans want a real leader who won't abandon America during a crisis. On Nov 3rd, you're fired for incompetence &amp; epic failures.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
No worries.  Everyone knows Biden is close to being brain dead. I can't wait to pull the plug.
???? You know that ad is a lie. Biden want to add to police funding.   Stop drinking the kool-aid.
That's pretty much it, frankly. Hence why it's the default choice, in a broken duopoly of a system were stuck with for the time being.  Biden might be an out of touch crypt keeper but at least he's not a malicious narcissist crypt keeper.

The Supreme Court's ruling gives Joe Biden the green light if he wins to enact whatever policy he wants and pay for it by taking the funds from the Department of Defense, which I'm sure the conservative Justices will treat the exact same way they've done here

You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn‚Äôt need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.
Biden has a great pick to chose from Kamala is Definitely one of them. Love all his picks. I chose Kamala before she even ran in the race.
Horrible company. 42 years of service and you treat me like this. Asking  to investigate your discriminatory practices shame you.

Typical lying GOP. Obvi, Obama and Biden were handed The great recession from Bush. They took unemployment from 10.5 to 4.6. Trumps claim to fame is giving his buddies $1.3 trillion which they put in the market,  which made the market go up. Big deal. Americans know you‚Äôre a liar

Yeah I know I make absolutely no sense for disagreeing with businesses closing over a virus with a 99% recovery rate. Go ahead and keep it shutdown because Biden doesn‚Äôt know what planet he is on. You all will be exposed for this nonsense it won‚Äôt end well.
I can see it now. Biden wins election and sends feds into Portland. After they will say why didn‚Äôt Trump do it.
fauci all but said it‚Äôs an excuse to hide by Biden
That‚Äôs it! We need the virus so that Biden has an excuse to hide. Boom ...open up the economy... takeoff the mask and let‚Äôs go to work.

We should let you guys do the negative spots while Biden does spots about how he's gonna fix what Trump broke.
I‚Äôm never voting for Biden so I‚Äôm not sure what you are saying here?
She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
I bet Biden announces his VP on Monday.
Prediction‚Ä¶ Trump‚Äôs tweet yesterday about delaying the election was intentional to trigger Dems &amp; have them on record saying ‚Äúabsolutely no way!‚Äù . Then, Oct surprise will show all the crimes Biden committed coming to the surface. Dems will scream ‚Äúwe must delay the election!‚Äù
Well said. Too bad we couldn‚Äôt have Biden/Obama.
It‚Äôs pretty mind blowing to me how people like Matt S don‚Äôt actually listen to or read Biden‚Äôs policies. They are super moderate and many lean right. It‚Äôs also wild how people in America want to see criminal and anti-American activity from the WH and then claim to be Patriots.
We are gonna vote so hard for Biden. Like I haven‚Äôt seen an anti-Biden post among my friends in like 3 months!
18% approval for the demacratic leaders...  That explains why there are no Biden yard signs.
Already hearing Republicans blaming the coming recession on Biden even though elections have not even taken place yet. Any idiot can see that this economy ahead will not be an easy recovery..
I travel all over... I see U.S. flags on cars, I see Trump written on cars, Everywhere I go.  Yet I have not seen even one Biden yard sign...  The embarrassment must be great.
make America great again dump this racist homophobic corrupt divisive lying POS Trump please vote for Biden
Biden‚Äôs getting a high number for investors *for a Democrat*.
A do think Biden‚Äôs number in the poll was right. It‚Äôs probably 51-49/48 right now or something like that.
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don‚Äôt accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
Ad: Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) Loves Joe Biden  via
Even more controversial take: I think Biden should promise trump not to prosecute him in exchange for trump leaving peacefully if Biden wins.
If I were to meet Joe Biden in person, I would welcome a hug and would know that it was offered with genuine kindness. Trump is so disgusting that the closest I want to be to him is to have a TV screen between us and a mute button close by.
Well, then we don‚Äôt need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is
Dear Joe Biden:PLEASE PLEASE PICK KAREN BASS AS YOUR VP! Thanks from Florida, see you in November

most of what you say happened under your prince obama who never gave a crap about blacks, and still does'nt. I bet he gave Biden the line"You aint black if you don't vote for me" Liberals have PTS. Wear a MAGAhat 24 hours it will cure you when you see leftys from our perspective.
Yes many of the born again followers who are spreading that Mr Biden is a Marxist
How about making sure more of the GOP votes for Joe Biden. Trump should leave the WH to a jail.
Certainly, Biden will do less. By far.
"We just want healthcare"  Are you even old enough to not qualify for your parent's ins? Do you know what it meant pre- Obama / Biden &amp; the ACA to be less than 26 &amp; want health ins? You'd only be able to afford a casualty policy in case you broke your leg skateboarding.

Are these the same polls that say Biden winning big? Yet polls are biased and wrong? Guess I should only trust polls you post?
Nina Turner clearly doesn‚Äôt want Biden elected. At this point she supports delaying the election because she basically supports trump.

So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
Because hope will take away chance of Biden winning..
It democRATS got a candidate like Joe Biden, it is because they don't need a competitive contender to win the elections.  We must be prepared for a massive fraud. We must be prepared to defend our Country from the dirty mob.

What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.
I can tell you now what they will be. Biden Wins. You Lose.

I don't see that at all... I see that as being American... my neighbor flies a flag on his porch and is voting for Biden in the election.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.

If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now‚Äîyou won‚Äôt get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone‚Äôs ideas before we vote.
We will vote!! Biden 2020.

Dude that means a President Biden will do it. Obama and Biden don‚Äôt do anything without talking to each other.

Ngl, little annoyed at this Biden ad
A Biden bro was mean to me on Twitter now I can't justify voting for Biden. Maybe think twice before you go around calling people selfish.
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
Would you be saying this if the owner was a Biden supporter?  NO
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.
Biden never ran an ad calling implying Obama was a ‚Äúscary black man‚Äù or covertly pushed ‚Äúbirther‚Äù conspiracies. Yet ur a ‚ÄúClinton Democrat‚Äù. And u don‚Äôt have to keep reminding me where I live lmao.

Because in the real fvcking world, trump destroyed everything I worked for 38 years of my life. If you think an Obama-Biden style presidency is the same as a trump one, you‚Äôre either privileged or you live in a fantasy world.
You‚Äôre deflecting. I guess all the progressives in congress who endorsed Biden are wrong.
No matter who Biden picks as VP, the GOP will pull her apart.
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!

It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
I don‚Äôt think that is really Biden.

Don't blame yourself Steve. How could you have possibly known how right Biden was back in April because up to that point Trump had been so respectful of the Constitution and especially the integrity of elections. Try not to be too hard on yourself.
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020

No Biden all the way
Send Biden to a nursing home, he's decrepit
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden‚Äôs pick. It‚Äôs time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
Must be a Joe Biden supporter

General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump‚Äôs plan?
I'm not buying this... Biden won't run for a second term so the VP is the de facto 2024 candidate. You're gaslighting.

Biden wins Penn,Wis,in addition to Michigan &amp; he is over 270!!!!Besides AZ,FL,NC,GA,TX,etc,etc,etc...

His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it‚Äôs way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!
I thought about that, but they like to have American fighter jets. Biden makes one call and he‚Äôs in a diplomatic bag, on a plane to Guantanamo.
If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn‚Äôt win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.

Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll stay on the job after he loses. I think he‚Äôll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
I didn‚Äôt then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
Ya know what America needs to unify it? A dementia ridden white guy and a cop
Ummmm he walked. ... he ain‚Äôt running anywhere... except for President... and that race he‚Äôll win... Biden is aloof
He just hates Biden; that‚Äôs all.
The best reason for third party simps to go vote for Biden this year: you think he'll be strong enough for a second term? Let him be marginally better than Trump for 4 years. Then you primary his then 82 year old ass with a real progressive.
Biden loses with Harris. No brainer.
I'm sure of it. Now if Kamala Harris is AG for Biden, she will kick ass. AG's have more power that VP's.
Then Trump said he is rolling back certain fair housing standards and I decided, even if I have to stand in line, I‚Äôll vote for Biden. (2/2)
Ok, ok. I was pretty adamant that I wasn‚Äôt going to vote for Biden. Then Trump has protesters forcibly removed in DC and I was like, ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll vote for Biden.‚Äù Then Trump sent federal troops to my home town and I was like, ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll vote absentee.‚Äù (1/2)
The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.

Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
Every single day at every single meeting with heads of state or otherwise, Trump turns it into a political rally and an attack on #Biden. And the slavish press covers his propaganda no matter what the meeting was intended for. Shameless.
Means she was willing to destroy his reputation and step over the smoldering remains to get into the White House. If Biden had tried that with Obama you wouldn‚Äôt want him as vp

So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it‚Äôs not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn‚Äôt want to hear.
but even then, he would have said a complete sentence which beats out to the current dementia-laden, 5-word memorizing, dangerous-drug pushing, clown in office today! But yea, Biden will be removing the obese one!
It didn‚Äôt happen under Obama/Biden. It won‚Äôt happen.  Trump is a liar.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"

Bernie can't win. I wish he or another candidate could but again a vote against Biden is a vote for Trump. Plain and simple. I have wasted votes before, not this time. It is imperative we get this one gone from the office.  Your freedom and future depend on it.
A vote against Biden is a vote for Trump. That is the sad fuc-- ng truth we have to face. I am not wasting a vote on one who cannot win. It is what it it is.
Biden all the way!
Biden will not pick anyone! Kamala or otherwise. He will announce his VP, not choose one. What would be funny is that if the choice was A and he announced B. He has no clue what‚Äôs happening.
Unfortunately he'll vote for Biden in November.
Records proving Amb Yovanovitch perjured herself at least twice Doc‚Äôs showing she was denying visas to witnesses who could prove Biden &amp; Dem corruption.
Clear doc proof of money laundering by Burisma &amp; Biden‚Äôs. How about that ‚Ä¶ it looks like this whole thing is about to blow up in their faces. Watch for Cyprus to become a huge hub and part of this story so far we have only scratched the tip of the iceberg
What's going on with Biden? Is this a sure sign of Dementia? One of the signs is impaired reasoning according to the medical definition. If he wins in Nov he'll have the nuke codes. Scary thought.
The harder thing than the hearing is watching Biden try to answer softball questions from reporters. Sad
I hope that next year President Biden presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Dr. Fauci &amp; a LONG-OVERDUE one to Gary Sinise for all of the excellent work he does with/for our veterans!
Save your energy, Malaria, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THERE THAT MUCH LONGER;  let Jill Biden exhibit HER genuine good taste &amp; class throughout the White House &amp; the grounds instead!
Those in power are scared that this would scare potential voters, even though the statistics support cannabis law change. We will see what happens, I heard Biden supports the medical use. De scheduling Federally and giving the medical legitimacy back is a start.
Democrats show him the play book  that Barack Obama and Joe Biden leaves show the American people the truth Barack Obama Leave the American people with enough supplies Donald Trump sold them to his Allied countries Democrats need to show proof I‚Äôm sick of lies
Nahh. Gym Jordan‚Äôs video clinched it for Biden.
Sad to say I haven‚Äôt voted in many years but having to deal with trump I will NEVER miss another opportunity. Biden 2020
So you don‚Äôt want Kamala because a white man can‚Äôt keep his mouth shut?! lol You make no sense. Just be honest about it, you don‚Äôt want Kamala. Biden is to blame for ALL of this. He should have announced his VP pick already. Dragging this out is not benefiting him.
November 3rd, I am voting for Biden, to do just that.
A safe bet, Miss SEC. There is no way on earth Biden‚Äôs people will let him go on stage to debate Trump or take part in another unscripted interview, regardless of how friendly the interviewer would be.  He can‚Äôt even take questions at his pressers.
Yeah, voting for Biden would be a good start.
They just want to give President Biden an even BIGGER mess to clean up----like he won't have enough already!  Do everything possible to make sure we have a DEMOCRATIC Senate AND House after November; start by getting rid of McConnell, Graham and Collins!!
Top CEOs ramp up GOP donations as Biden threatens to scale back corporate tax cuts
Sharpton: ‚ÄòIf they (Biden campaign) are enticed by the polls it could be to their detriment‚Äô
Biden would be sniffing and groping the women and children.
One.  But does that really matter?  We should all know that Biden is a placeholder only.  We should also all know that they will do anything to get power back including stuffing ballot boxes and using machines that only mark votes for one candidate no matter who you picked.
She had better do it quickly,  because in January Dr. Jill Biden will be moving in &amp; she may have different plans!
Biden is a COWARD!
Biden is a COWARD!
Biden is a COWARD!
Imagine their behaviour into the morning hours of 11/4/2020, when Biden makes his concession speech!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.                                                                                    DONALD TRUMP IS LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
No. As much as I trust Trump, what would your answer be if Biden or Obama was the President?
Looks like all the Biden supporters came out.
Joe Biden said he can‚Äôt be black
However in the world of Old Sleepy Joe Biden, ‚ÄúWe like truth over facts‚Äù‚Ä¶ Detective Friday in the old Dragnet TV Show, ‚Äù Just the facts Mam, just the facts‚Äù‚Ä¶
Joe Biden is already in bed with China if he gets elected all they have to do is fluff his pillow. He's been taking bribes out of China in the Millions of $ for years.  He has put China ahead of his own country. People are so brainwashed that they would vote for this Criminal.
Of course. If you don‚Äôt vote Biden, you‚Äôre voting for trump.
Biden on Obama...the first clean black guy  I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI mean, that‚Äôs a storybook, man.‚Äù
Look at what the alternative is (I mean philosophy - not Biden).
...and you think Biden could have done a better job controlling COVID-19? He called Trump all sorts of bad names when he shut the Chinese planes bringing more Chinese into America. Yeah, he would do great . . . or maybe you could have done better - NOT.
Can't wait for POTUS Joe Biden
Biden should ease up on that Trump is a racist stuff. Has shown a number of instances of being a racist. At some point Trump is going to throw that in his face. Then you know what he'll do, he'll lie. That's what liberal Democrats do they lie.
I try to make fun of these ridiculous people and things. These subjects are very serious to me. If Joe Biden was selected it would scare me. They would pull him like a marionette to pass every socialist bill they could.
Hogwash! The reason they are dragging their feet is in itself political, to help Joe Biden. They can't make a political criminal investigation a non political indictment. These is an excuse that every America must reject. We want Justice #Durham #AGBarr
You know what people are calling Trump a racist a white supremacist. They haven't shown One Clip with him saying anything racist. There is plenty with Joe Biden showing his racism though. If Trump said those things, they'd be screaming it from the rafters.
I live 57 years and up until I never heard of anybody saying nasty comments about somebody having a political bumper sticker. I w never to somebody with a Biden sticker. I personally deplore him. I guess you can't have free speech unless you agree with them.
I'm a diabetic and I take insulin. The prices are absolutely ridiculous, some points in my life I had to choose not to eat or take insulin an live. What Donald Trump did today I was so choked up I almost cried. Obama and Joe Biden got rich off these drug companies. Their garbage.
I figured out what Joe Biden's platform is. He's going for their ignorant, uninformed, CNN and brainwashed audience. He hasn't said one thing that a normal American would want to hear in a presidential candidate. He should run as a Socialist Communist at least that is honest.
The scary part is that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of what a disgusting individual Joe Biden is.
CORRUPTION...OBAMA-BIDEN era Beat all Time Records The Hell you Talking About Fool!
Not even close to accurate here in Florida. I see Trump signs everywhere and never see Biden signs.
‚Å¶ ‚Å¶ ‚Å¶ one more person Joe Biden can pick for VP!! She‚Äôs gangster ! #RSMS
You know what I was thinking, Joe Biden is a broken down politician. I can't understand how anybody in their right mind could vote for him. Just because you hate Trump isn't a illegitimate reason. Hating is no reason to vote. Some people don't even know why they hate Trump.
I heard show Biden made a mistake the other day he said a nurse was blowing up his nose. He meant he was snorting blow up his nose.
8 yrs Obama and Biden worked tirelessly but were blocked often by republican obstructionism. They have a good relationship. You cant keep staff. You have so many leaks. They talk behind your back at how nuts you are. The petulant tantrum thrower. Obama/Biden zero scandals.
Safe R to Likely R... Nice. Expect more changes between now and November 3rd! #Thripp2020 #FL6 #FL06 #RidinWithBiden2020
I live in Central Florida, the I-4 corridor. Biden is BIG here!
I will not vote for Biden either, unless I die between now and November, of course. But I anyways have a choice. God gives it to me.
Is she mentally sick like Biden? What is scary is that if anything happened to both Trump and Pence, Pelosi is next in line for the Presidency. VERY SCARY!
I believe that President BIDEN (God I love the sound of that!) may have to call in the National Guard to BODILY remove FORMER President Trump from the W.H.;  if that happens, I hope that EVERY üåé news outlet carries it LIVE!
Do you understand that the government is trying to defund our police officers which the democrat governments  will do you‚Äôll see if you vote for Joe Biden
3rd. Third in line. Not second. She's been talking to Biden too much.
You‚Äôre no better than Biden. I can‚Äôt believe you voted to take the statues down in the Capitol. You‚Äôre a real piece of work and I hope Texans give you the boot.
You know it Jimmy you wuss. Something has to be done, Biden wont do it. Just in case it needs to be done in a hurry. Whine and cry, cry and whine, you are at your best when you do.
One of my best friends was a fireman. He was killed inside the World Trade Center on 9/11. And Joe Biden says he wants to teach Islam in our Public Schools. That's one of the most disgraceful things I ever heard. They don't even want to do the Pledge of Allegiance.
I wish you thought about our National Health Crisis even half as much as you think about Obama &amp; Biden. My Lord you‚Äôre insufferable. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Trumps America feeds on hate and division as well as fear. Don't be scared, before this leader America was never intimidated by their president. Joe Biden will ease the angst created by Trump, who failed the citizens and allowed many to die before their time. Vote Trump out.
How can people call this Biden‚Äôs America? Like it‚Äôs happening right now in Portland, and it‚Äôs starting in several other cities. We might be on different ends of the political spectrum, but if you stand up for your rights then this shouldn‚Äôt sit right with you.
You must be referring to Biden.
Ya Hiden Biden would do so much better..You sir are a fool.Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄòGun Violence Epidemic‚Äô Plan is a Blueprint for Civilian Disarmament - The Truth About Guns

House Democrats subpoena Pompeo over claims he helped advance ‚Äòconspiracy theories‚Äô about Biden   ELIOT! Phone home. What a total POS liar democrats are.
sounds like she just had an epiphany. This is why thousands hv #WalkAwayFromDemocrats bc they hv woken up to his "Change" agenda to mk #America communist, and #Biden will let him complete his Soros agenda.
Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄòGun Violence Epidemic‚Äô Plan is a Blueprint for Civilian Disarmament - The Truth About Guns   America will NOT allow democrats to destroy the US Constitution. Especially not communist democrats. NEVER!!!
Who does he think will pardon him? Joe Biden certainly has made it clear he will not be involved in a pardon. All trumps cronies will be gone and he can‚Äôt pardon himself. Quite a mess he‚Äôs gotten himself into. And he deserves every moment of anxiety.
No I subscribe to Dr. Emmanuel who #Biden said was a "crazy woman" bc she's healed many with #hydroxychloriquineworks
Learned this morn that the eye drops the dr just gave me were Made In China.  #WakeUpAmerica China is not our friend &amp; neither is #Biden.
CLOWARD PIVENS Strategy - #Biden supporters need #wakeupcall
The WH and West Wing will be renovated by the new president. Biden certainly wants to get rid of all the gold plated fixtures, gold drapes, etc. That money needs to go to help the homeless, the hungry, the sick and more important things than remodeling.
Biden just locked up California. Clever selection.
#MAGA #KAG2020 #Patriots Biden's plan to "transform #America"put in place by Obama to destroy suburbs. AFFH Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (view Life, Liberty &amp; Levin fm 7/26 w/Stanley Kurtz) This Rule in Fair Housing Act must be cancelled. #VoteRed2020
You are kiddin right? If any #American who believes in  #1A and #2A doesn't vote for Trump, this country is forever lost as we know it. Hope you listened to Mark Levin this week &amp; what Biden meant when he said "transform America" attacking local rights in suburbs.
Nadler only says that because he wants to undermine our President. He'd be marching to a different tune if Biden was in the White house.
The republicans are busy postering for positions in the event Biden wins. They are underestimating the American people. We know who they are and we can‚Äôt vote them out along with the Pelosi puppet parade.
A person with a narcissistic personality, like trump, cannot be humiliated. When it gets to that point, he will say he didn‚Äôt want to win anyway. He rigged the election for a Biden win, so his base will never accept Biden as legitimate on his own.
#ImVoting4BidenBecause  #Russia, #China and #Iran are already #interfering in #Election2020, hoping that #Biden and the #RadicalLeft win.  Probably #NorthKorea and maybe even #Andorra. And I want the #USA to be just like those countries.  #FakeNews #JK   Is that what YOU want?
I hope they ask Joe Biden. He looks way cooler.
Is Joe Biden a myth?
Impeachment witness urges Burisma probe, testifies to concern of Hunter Biden ‚Äòconflict‚Äô
One of the petty things of trump is refusing to hang the portrait of President Obama. I read where it was placed in a small room. This pisses me off. I hope Biden takes Trump‚Äôs portrait out to the dumpster. But Joe isn‚Äôt petty.
Biden takes aim at Trump over coronavirus in new ad blitz courting seniors   Democrats killed the seniors.
Joe Biden said: if you vote for Trump, you ain't black, so IF YOU DON'T  RESPECT THE FLAG AND THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, YOU AIN'T AMERICAN. RIGHT UNCLE JOE.?
You damn right they met their match. Our president is NOT owned by anyone. Not China not Russia. That‚Äôs a lot more than you can say for Biden, Pelosi, Schumer DNC they have all been in bed w/ China/Russia for years &amp; sold the USA To the highest bidder.
Biden's statement... Could he have meant "Trance" Form the Nation? Feels like were in the midst of it right now by the #Democrats.

Of course she is.. she‚Äôs from Chicago and has probably been promised a cushy job if Biden wins.
Is a vote for Biden a vote for a shadow government ?
Sad to see a man who served his party for 44 years thrown to the dogs without a care for him or his family. Biden is incapable of the job President of the United States. Democrats should be ashamed!
Biden: Burisma: Flynn: ObamaGate. The dirty dem corruptions never discussed on MSM
And where is the leadershio from Biden, he is incoherent after 2 minutes at the mike. Then tells us that was not the order of questions to be asked. You call that leadership? 130 million deaths from Covit-another fact no one seemed to dispute. Face it you have  a sad, old man.
The last time they spoke Biden forgot Wallace's name. In order to get through this "interview " Wallace will have to go real easy on Joe. If he doesn't Biden will implode and I'm sure that's not what Wallace wants.
I think we haven‚Äôt seen Hunter Biden, because he‚Äôs in the midst of a cognitive test and he‚Äôs forgotten where he is. The apple doesn‚Äôt fall far from the tree üòÇ

Sorry, I don‚Äôt believe these polls. Who is actually going to vote for Biden?
Please let him out of the basement - every time Biden opens his mouth another idiotic statement falls
It shouldn‚Äôt surprise me the things that come out of Biden‚Äôs month.  Every day Biden and the rest of the Socialist Goons continue to spew their ignorance and hatred for our GREAT COUNTRY!Biden sucks.
Um Biden‚Äôs vp pick won‚Äôt excite me in the least.  He can pick gw bush, Gerald Ford, I don‚Äôt care. Biden has no excitement
What happens when u know u don‚Äôt want trump but realize joe Biden is no different??
Dem voter, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt name any joe Biden policy except that he will try to fix Obamacare.  He hasn‚Äôt explained how.  But it‚Äôs imperative we vote for joe.  ü§î
Wonder why no one ever asks if there will be violence if Biden were to win?
Do u care that Joe Biden (even with his mental lapses) always represents corporate America‚Äôs position instead of a populous position?
Does anyone have a favorite Biden policy?
Name your favorite Joe Biden legislation over the last 30 years.
The problem with Biden, he has a 30 year career of üí© decisions.  Does anyone believe for 1 second, Biden will make a good vp pick?   Joe will disappoint again.

Joe Biden is a liar.
You need to ask Juan Williams what Joe Biden would do different concerning the Corona virus
Biden‚Äôs candidacy has me fuü§¨ing defending Hillary.
I never thought Hillary was stupid, or mentally deficient in any way. I disliked her because she was openly corrupt.  She was still a much better candidate than Joe Biden.
Trump destroyed Hillary in their debates.  I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll do the same with Biden.   Biden is not functioning with half of Hillary‚Äôs brain power.
Would u have voted  for biden in ‚Äò88 or 2008?
I watched some of Biden today and the cable lost its feed.  I‚Äôm not sure this was not deliberate.
This election is not about voting for Joe Biden.  He makes üí© decisions.   Vote green.
It‚Äôs funny GW tried hard to accentuate his ‚Äúdumbed down‚Äù Everyman persona.  Joe Biden tries hard to just appear legitimate.  Maybe joe should just use gw‚Äôs style.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Do u think the Biden campaign pays cable news to shill for him?
Your cable network has reduced your channels to two. On one channel is biden, the other trump. Which one do u watch?
I don‚Äôt want a trump 2nd term.  But the dnc is forcing it on us with their quack candidate joe biden
You forgot rule 3.  No woman with long hair in the audience or on the tv staff.  We don‚Äôt need Biden distracted and only thinking about sniffing hair.
I don‚Äôt think Biden can save us.  Given his record.
I have a confession‚Äî I want to believe shahid because I dislike Nancy pelosi.  I  want to believe Tara reade because I hate joe Biden.    I absolutely believe dr Ford. I don‚Äôt care who the accused is.  I watched her testimony   She‚Äôs believable.
Biden and the dnc cheated.
This is a passive aggressive question trying to drum up support for Biden.  By making him look like a victim, even tho he cheated with the dnc.
Are people asking this question because they know the dnc used fraud to elevate joe, and he is illegitimate anyway??  So even if trump loses to Biden, the results are meaningless.  Joe is a fake candidate
Joe Biden just backed out of an interview on Fox with the most fair journalist on that network.  Joe Biden is in trouble.
Name 3 things from Biden‚Äôs political career that served the masses.
This is ridiculous!!! Biden should be having debates with President Trump by now... less than 100 days.... get debating show us what you boys have! Biden has Dementia and Trumps got the Presidency.... let‚Äôs go üòÇüòÇüòÇ
If joe Biden as president leads a regime change in Venezuela his reasoning will be
If joe Biden wins presidency he will not- Raise taxes on rich Fix healthcare  Fix student loan problem Help Palestine  Implement green new deal Sanction the saudis Get $$ out of politics   Why do we want joe?  So he can sit in his assisted living facility, quietly?
How is biden different than trump?  What would biden change?  Be specific.
To all identity politics dems‚Äî feminism is on the ballot in 2020.  If you vote for joe you are doing your part to kill feminism.  Joe Biden is equivalent to Hillary. Only he‚Äôs a man.  And unhealthy.  And his mind is shot. And his record is worse than Hillary.
If trump is a bad leader that automatically means joe Biden would be a good leader.   (‚Äî is this statement true?
Do watch Scarborough.  He and Mika shill all morning long for Biden.  It‚Äôs terrible.
My area sucks.  Totally red.  All this pro Biden polling doesn‚Äôt make sense.
If you are a feminist will u be voting for:  A. Biden B. Trump
"I can beat Biden off.." Alrighty, then!
#BidenForFL Florida will not go for Biden.  I live in a very trumpy area.  These trumpers don‚Äôt care about trumps response to coronavirus. They hate democrats.
The same journalists who trashed Bernie the entire primary, trash trump daily, and constantly elevate Biden.  If u are a voter msm wants u to vote joe.  Just in case you can‚Äôt read between the lines.
Why does msm keep reporting polling 100 days out?  Are they trying to generate Biden voters?  Polling doesn‚Äôt mean üí© this far out.  Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt selected a vp.  Biden hasn‚Äôt debated yet.
I‚Äôll admit trump is bad, terrible even.  I will also admit that Biden is equally if not worse than trump.
Does anyone think they can move Biden left?
We gave money to Biden what we could afford.  ü•∞
Do i have a choice? It‚Äôs either dementia dictator or Biden
A stutterüòÇ.  I‚Äôve been watching Biden for years.  Way back to his senate days.  Joe is not struggling with a stutter.  Nothing against u bro.  U probably don‚Äôt pay attention that closely.
Joe Biden is trying to get republican voters by using a rick scott slogan.
Every time I read a joe Biden twitter post I deconstruct whatever he‚Äôs saying to mean, ‚Äúhi I‚Äôm joe, remember me.  I‚Äôm tweeting something completely innocuous because I‚Äôm not really a front runner‚Äù
Is Pete writing all your twitter posts.  Say something meaningless but harmless.  That tells me joe biden is not bold, is no leader.
Uh excuse me they are blaming Biden for this, uh no trump is president
Biden‚Äôs live-streams should be on fire.  He farts and tries to pretend no one heard it.
It is a big step but candidate Biden was sending some strong signals about having Pete in his administration.  Now, what President-Elect Biden will do....that is an entirely different question.
Biden said he talks wth Drs 3x a week  1hr abt the virus. I would like 2 know the Drs namesIf it isn‚Äôt bloody then it isn‚Äôt a revolution. Also, If you think for one second Biden won‚Äôt also be a war criminal and kill people with the powers of the office then you are sadly naive.
Was Biden there?
Ok...  Biden wasn't there...  Maybe he forgot it was today...
Outside of the status quo career politician like Biden, Pelosi,  Grassley and Don Young.  Trump doesn't care what people think of him.  That's what pisses people off the most in my opinion.  He'll say it like it is without sugar coating anything.
Biden can barely remember his name...
This the best you got? Trumps campaign strategy is to mock Biden‚Äôs speech? Go right ahead, you‚Äôre hurting, not helping trumps cause but too ignorant to even know it.
Pretending Joe Biden will fix this corrupt system is beyond hilarious. He built this system. Should've voted for Bernie Sanders, boomers.
Biden should be too
tell us, how many republicans do you know that are voting for VP Biden. Is it a big number?
This is odd if you know Biden promised he would reign in his own ambition and consider being VP the end of his political career and not run for prez, when Obama was vetting him. But here we are. His ambition is ok though. Stop holding women to double standards.
How come no one is talking about Biden's Ukraine deals anymore?
Ha or he‚Äôs cold because he‚Äôs old! Haha prob more true
It‚Äôs just an address. Shut off the electricity and water, no supplies, lots of Ted Nugent played at pants shitting decibels. Biden can work from a card table at the capitol rotunda. He‚Äôll be fine.
Bullshit only because is election year. Thru Puertorricans will vote for Biden we haven‚Äôt forgot the way Trump put us as second class American citizens after Hurricane Maria. After sacrificing the life of our men and women since WWI.  Did you know that Puerto Rico have more men
All of the polling for Joe Biden shows he's ahead of Trump way more than Hillary ever was against him.
No. free market does work. But i would ask your fellow dems about that. You think we will have z free market under the leadership of Biden?
So then can we add a tweet about joe Biden being the most corrupt VP in history too?! #ObamaBidenGate
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. Trump would rip  Biden a new one.
That question is why I find the polls interesting. If they are representative it seems like the naysayers are fewer, even if very vocal. If Biden is at the top, why not EW or KH? He‚Äôs not my choice, but he‚Äôs what we got. They
This is why electing Joe Biden, though necessary I believe, will be pointless because the democrats will NOT do a single thing to prevent the next Trump. We must take over the Democratic party.
Biden with have free rein, then work with #GOP remaining to balance and heal the Nation.  will be counseled by Bo.
Tell me when we have effective vaccines AFTER Biden is in office, and how many obstructionist GOP members are ousted along with Trump. Then I‚Äôll give you my answer.
It‚Äôs all a script that all of these mayors are reciting. It‚Äôs all a way to try to hide their involvement with the pedophile ring. If Biden wins they can hide it. If Trump wins we will be in a civil war.
Looks like a Biden rally üòÇ
If only Joe Biden would support Medicare for all. 35,000 people die every year because they don't have access to health care.
I wondered how much this was going to be held against her. It also explains why some others are still on the list. We are going to learn a lot about what Biden thinks about women‚Äôs leadership. Does he want a peer who can challenge him? Or someone he thinks will be deferential?
Trump is toast. Biden enters office with pedal to the metal. Keep your sell orders to a minimum.
Did you see the tweet I tagged you in this morning? With Biden scary stuff
Biden‚Äôs campaign is ‚Äòsuppressing the Hispanic vote‚Äô in Florida, an internal letter claims
They will not win. And Biden is their CINO. candidate in name only.
I feel like I‚Äôve been on an ACID trip since 1894. We need Thorzine Biden.
This should be more alarming to you than anything else. Joe Biden effectively has one of the easiest presidential runs and US history. Because people are so discontent with Trump that all he has to do is sit back and do nothing and he will blow out Trump.
To visit Biden?
Lmao you think Barack Obama or Joe Biden is "our guy"?
still need to know who chose Biden over Bernie

Why wouldn't he say that...Biden is corrupt and evil to his core. He is the one that shows racism.
This is your wake up call America.  Get out and vote for Joe Biden.
Why would the black people vote for. Joe. Biden ? He has made more Racist remsrks over the media then. David. Duke ! He didn‚Äôt want his kids going to school with black kids and on and on with remarks afout blacks !
I just help a friend who new voted register in Florida and is voting Biden. I Have another friend I converted. There are many stories like this.
Joe Biden is unintelligent and should be replaced with Bernie Sanders.52 % of republicans polled say they will not accept the election results if Joe Biden wins. Trump will end up causing a civil war in America. Every American should be ready!
Yet, the real question that ponders us all is:  "Where's Basement Biden?"
You really need to research Biden's History more, it's truly horrible.  You're ignoring the lives he's destroyed in Latin/South America with his love of Regime change.  Look at Honduras for example, or what's going on in Yemen.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Crime Bill?  Patriot Act?  NDAA? #NeverBiden
Joe Biden sounds alot like a certain Bloody Socialist Cuban Dictator that murdered over 100,000 Cubans in 58 years of Absolute Power.
Well, for starters it's indisputable that Biden has far more blood on his hands than Trump &amp; has left more destroyed lives in his wake.  The biggest reason I think Biden will be worse is all the "Resistance" will go back to brunch &amp; ignore his evil, just like they did with Obama.
Oh u mean like the witness of Biden rape victim...? I mean that one definitely has witnesses n all democrats by the way... trump in the other hand was always a pretty boy that could have hit anything he wanted... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Indeed, Biden is absolutely the worst candidate the DNC could have rigged it for, with the possible exception of Bloomberg.  The Democratic Party has been closet Republican for decades.  I don't vote for conservative Warmongering Segregationist sex pests regardless of party.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
He said in the begining that LatinX votes weren't part of his strategy making it obvious that he has zero intention of doing anything that benefits those of us that fall into that group.  Biden is only going to help his real constituents, which none of us on here are a part of.

Projections are that more than 250K small businesses are going under and  want to give then $0 in aid while giving states $1.1 trillion in aid.   This is a microcosm of how Democrats intend to treat businesses in a Joe Biden presidency.
Oh hell no!
Florida supports Joe Biden by 4 points.
Biden attracts 247 people to watch him read from a teleprompter, but he is ahead of the President in the polls? If you believe that I have a bridge for sale.
American citizens are dissatisfied with your lethal policy. I will vote for Joe Biden.
Along with Biden, nothing f but grandstanding for 125 years.  #TakeBackTheHouse  #WakeUpAmerica
If by "getting pulled farther left," means Joe Biden wants to make sure everyone has healthcare, and make sure that the Police get more funding, then I guess you are right.
Rasmussen's polls have been proven to be inaccurate over and over again.  Literally 99% of the other polls have your approval rating at least underwater by 8 points.  If you want to talk about polls, how about admitting that 99% of polls have you getting clobbered by Biden?
Trump advertising in Florida in Spanish that Biden doesn‚Äôt have a Latin VP candidate. Only Blacks. That‚Äôs a disgrace and I hope Latino citizens don‚Äôt fall for it.

Hopefully Latinos are smarter than racist whites to fall for this. We‚Äôre electing Joe Biden for President, not his VP.
You always have been and continue to be exhibit number 1, entered into evidence as being the absolute dumbest president in history. You are also exhibit number one in making Biden look like a rocket scientist. Enjoy golf this weekend, it requires zero IQ, perfect for you.

Wow! Joe Biden and the DNC are sure starting off on their Campaign Propaganda really early this year.
You just have to worry about the President touching little kids if Biden wins #Trump2020
The difference betweeh Joe Biden and Oprah Winfrey. Oprah was smart to not run for President. Joe Biden will lose, any way.
For those who don't believe me, please see this article.  Biden wants to give $300 million in additional funding to the COPS program, the same program that Trump wanted to cut.
Joe Biden is literally proposing to give police more funding than Trump wants to give them.  So keep purveying your ignorant lies.  It's not working.

Do you think JOE BIDEN WILL BE ABLE TO GET ENOUGH SAGE TO SMUDGE THE WHITEHOUSE?? THERE HAS TO BE SOME BAD BAD JUJU
Joe Biden's (Obama) Administration saw the longest continual job growth in history. Yesterday the GDP hit an all-time low.  who do you think you're fooling with your b*******.   don't listen to me listen to Donald.
Anti- Trumpers continually accuse him of criminal conduct absent any proof. They need to look no further than their candidate Biden who is the poster boy off ill-gotten gains.
America, everything we supposedly ‚Äúhear‚Äù from Joe Biden is not coming from Joe Biden.  He is unable to think clearly enough to come up with even a fraction of what we are hearing.  There are other people behind him steering him to do and say what they want. Biden is a front man.
There is a poll indicating 62% of Americans won't reveal who they are voting for..   This statistic alone explains the so-called Biden lead..  How many Dems fear retribution.  Zero  Trumper's don't fear retribution.. they absolutely KNOW there would be retribution
So you're telling me Joe Biden you're worried about his dementia which he doesn't have... Without mentioning Trump's complete batshit crazy behavior bipolar schizophrenic

Only 247 People Are Watching Joe Biden Attempt to Read a Teleprompter in His Basement  Quite an improvement over the day he had 19 people watch his event. That was the day that President Trump raised $20 million online.
Im worried about the  election. People will decide that there will be lots to vote for Biden, so they won't vote at all. Everyone who can, plan to vote.
Sure seems to be a lot of real conservatives coming out against Trump.  When I heard that George Will would be voting for Joe Biden I thought I had stepped into bizarro land. Another prominent conservative ws calling for impeachment because of the change election day tweet by djt
If Biden doesn‚Äôt win, you fucks at the  will have to file bankruptcy.
Just look at this creep.... Tell me he isn't eye balling this young girl. JOE BIDEN WAS KNOWN IN THE JEFFREY EPSTEIN CIRCLE AS  "PEDO JOE"
Like butter.  The Brits are following the polls and making lunch money bets on Biden. The real money accounts, fresh off scraping the table of the Remainer's rent money, and most of the Yanks (including me) are taking the odds... hard
Where's Basement Biden?
Joe Biden doesn't need to Tweet . When hes President he really won't have the Time. I only wish a Representative of his keeps the feed alive.
Becuase Joe Biden is a child sniffer

This is a Southwest Florida thing: Trump and American flags hanging from the back of pickups. Along with the occasional Confederate flag. Moral of the story: Make sure you vote for Biden so truck guy will be even more unhappy.
Ow the left has gotten to the teacher unions to say they don‚Äôt wanna go back to the class to teach.  They are trying to stop the re openning of everything at this point. Watch on Nov 3 with a Biden win how we hear the very next day how schools need to open and people back 2 work
My account havked by the Biden‚Äôs, just saying. Trump 2021.
Joe Biden is our Abraham Lincoln and then the second Civil War Jefferson Davis is in the White House... Trump is Jefferson Davis, the ""house that Jeff built"" is also Trump Tower.  In America Up Is down, left is right, and everybody right-wing Confederacy down the rabbit hole ..
We became China the moment Democrats sold America out. Its clear with Hunter Biden's 1.5B deal with the Chi-Coms, Dems became beholden to the Communist regime. #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
It's because they have no other rebuttal for choosing such a problematic candidate like Biden...  They are such shallow, two dimensional thinkers. #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
You sound hysterical. Get that TDS treated.ü§î  There's an argument to be made that Biden isn't even the lesser evil, that's how low your party has sunk.  Might want to hit up your Superdelegates to use their power for good for a change &amp; for what it was intended. #ReplaceBiden
Yes, I‚Äôm sure Joe Biden does have a ton of Chinese bots deceiving you into believing a false popularity.  Which is also similar to the election.
As expected...üôÑ  Same response I get when I ask #JoeBots to name Progressive policies that Biden has championed during his 50+ years as a Democrat...
That's a strawman argument, I never said Trump wasn't garbage, I'm saying Biden is also garbage with more blood on his hands &amp; more ruined lives in his wake than the talking Cheeto.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  It's sad that you can't argue any positives for your preferred sex pest other than,"But Trump!"
Public announcements from both sides continue and sow confusion in the electorate. Many Trump voters stay home and GOP heavy election locations do not open. Dems show up in force on Election Day and in mail in ballots to give Biden decisive landslide. Trump won‚Äôt concede.
C‚Äômon Mark, he‚Äôs on their payroll and the Biden campaign committee.
Biden right Turley a traitor,  your all going down.
In April, Biden said, ‚ÄúI think Trump is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held.‚Äù  Trump's campaign called his comments "incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate"  Today Trump suggested we delay the election
Lmao Scott finds one poll that has Biden with a double digit lead and he praises it like it‚Äôs gospel. He must be embarrassed.
The President of the United States, really just said, "Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote"  Remember when Joe Biden said he believes Trump will try and delay the election and Republicans attacked him for it?
You got to ask yourself this question. Why the hell would project Veritas put out a video like this? I think it's some kind of a setup.
LOL. Joe Biden is further to the right than Ronald Reagan. You're one of my Representatives here in Florida? no wonder we are fucked.
Joe Biden is the poster boy for term limits. A record of more than four decades of service that is devoid of accomplishment yet boasts anti desegregation rhetoric.
I live in the suburbs.  There are plenty of people living in low-income housing.  Most of them voted for Trump in 2016.  Most of them would be homeless if not for ‚Äúlow-income housing.‚Äù  Most of them will now be voting Biden in 2020. #SuburbsForBiden
According to Gallup Americans think if you contract covid there's a 9% chance you will die..  Gallup also says that Biden is leading in the polls  Is that a function of how ignorant we are or a function of our media leading us over a cliff.. like lemmings.
There‚Äôs disgruntled people everywhere. It wasn‚Äôt Biden. His note said ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt hold grudges‚Äù. Which tells me he‚Äôll make the choice. Don‚Äôt forget he‚Äôs got some pretty impressive advisors. The guy that used to be his boss. Have faith.
Did the media EVER make any attempt to root out the Biden corruption..?
Gallup has a poll that finds Americans think 9% of people will die if they contract Covid..  Is it any wonder Gallup shows Biden ahead in the polls..?
LMAO. If you think Joe Biden is a socialist you are dumber than I thought. Democrat or not Joe Biden is further to the right than Ronald Reagan. Please to avoid embarrassing yourself further don't use words that end in -ist or -ism.
LMAO he CANNOT complete sentences better than trump. Go watch for yourself. Trump will dominate Joe just like he did to Clinton in head to head. Joe Biden has also been seen biting little girls hair. He asked a 9 year old girl if she was 18. Give it up.
I didn't say Trump was good, I said Biden is shit.  He absolutely has more blood on his hands and destroyed lives under his belt than the Oompah Loompah in Chief does though, so there's that...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è .#NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15

Absolutely Judge. No one in their right mind would vote for Biden. Didn't I see, an amber alert for him. #gofigure
Biden is a senile old fool.
Again...I don‚Äôt often agree with Biden (or Trump) &amp; we may have varying visions of what succes ahead looks like...but this is still true! Many will tell you we are doomed specifically BECAUSE of our ‚Äúheart‚Äù &amp; history. Ignore them.
#NobodyLikesTrump This thread was developed by malcontent Biden losers. Biden, a mentally deficient man, is an embarrassment. It is hundreds of times worse to know that there are really stupid people that would vote for him.
JG.   Stick it pal.   These aren‚Äôt peaceful protestors.  They are tying to gain access to a federal bldg and burn it to the ground.  Tell me and the millions on here why they are allowed to do this ?    Plz tell us.  Your a joke to say this isn‚Äôt happening.  Take the Biden ü§ì off
i live in florida (a MASSIVE swing state) so im 100% voting for biden tbh
It has to be Harris; Rice is obviously qualified, but she has no constituency. Warren's constituency knows she's out &amp; are voting for Biden. Aabrams &amp; Duckworth would be fine choices, but again, Biden would be trading a guaranteed bloc of voters, demographically diverse for...
More racism from our Putin puppet. Biden will fix this ridiculous move of yours when we throw your a$$ out in November. You killed Americans with your negligence in dealing with the pandemic, you allow Putin to kill our troops, you are a racist and expect to be re-elected? Nope!
Well anyone who's Biden pick as VP will become president. Somehow in this case ambition is irrelevent. Unless they want a weak president who would be nothing more than a figure head.
There goes Texas, Pennsyvania...
Texas loves Biden!
Tied? Biden &amp; Trump are only tied in Georgia polls??  That settles it, then. Georgia is the most ignorant of the sister states (Georgia &amp; Florida) on a % basis.

Who would you rather see as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate?
Biden stated that ‚Äúthe police have become the enemy.‚Äù No wonder they all pulled out of the DNC
exactly so go do some research. I have. Facts don‚Äôt lie. Trump has helped minorities more than any other president ‚Äúsugar‚Äù. He‚Äôs not racist, Joe Biden is super racist but you won‚Äôt admit that. Joe Biden has called a former kkk member a mentor &amp; he‚Äôs put MANY minorities in Jail!
In some ways he's worse.  It's undisputable that Biden has far more blood on his hands and destroyed lives under his belt than the Oompah Loompah in Chief does.üòñ  The Democratic Party has become a mockery of everything it's ever claimed to stand for.  I'm #DoneWithDems.
My man, they're dragging Biden around by the arm like he's Ray Charles in a crowded mall, I'm pretty sure incontinence has made an appearance and he cant make a sentence.   What are you doing?
Texas is still a ‚ÄúRed State,‚Äù but the people of Texas also know a crook when they see him.  Joe Biden may not be as Red as they prefer, but he‚Äôs a good, honest, hard working man who cares about all of the people in Texas.  That‚Äôs why Biden will win Texas.
The Great State of Texas supports Joe Biden.
Biden and Obama tried to do this but Republicans called it ‚ÄúSocialist price controls.‚Äù  Nancy Pelosi tried again in 2019 and McConnell blocked the attempt.
Keep talking. You‚Äôre Biden‚Äôs best reason for voting for him. Keep on talking.
Trump‚Äôs just mad because Joe Biden took press questions and Fox News covered it.  BTW Biden looked awesome!
Not right now.  It would be too much of a distraction.  We need to concentrate all of our attention on the election of Joe Biden.
Great point! Ethics of sharing that w Biden an issue?
Watching Biden‚Äôs performance at his ‚Äúnews conference ‚Äú yesterday reminded of a movie.  Peter Sellers as Chauncy Gardener in ‚ÄúBeing There‚Äù. Character had no intelligence jusr like Biden. He couldn‚Äôt call reporter with answer on teleprompter. Idiot
Great TShirt idea. "If you vote for Biden, you ain't a cop!"
Biden and the Democrats will pander to anyone for a vote, but this is beyond frightening for Capitalism and American freedoms.
You are aware that VP Biden has never been ‚Äúpresident‚Äù so your prognosis is very inaccurate.
It‚Äôs hard to believe but the best TV ads against Trump are not from Biden‚Äôs team but from other true conservative Republicans. They will be a force to be reckoned with when this is all over.
Donald Trump was all ready to campaign against Bernie Sanders with his bogus attacks of ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù and ‚Äúradical left.‚Äù  Then Joe Biden won and now he still thinks that his strategy can work.  Biden has been in office for 40 years. We all know he‚Äôs not ‚Äúradical.‚Äù
Joe Biden won the Primary.  He is far from being ‚ÄúRadical.‚Äù  If anything you are the ‚Äúradical‚Äù one.
I don't even think that's a given.  When they can't hide Biden in his basement anymore and he actually has to debate and give long form interviews his cognitive decline will be impossible to hide anymore. #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15

14 weeks. We'll have 14 weeks of Joe Biden
Never seen anything like it. They attacked Barr like rabid dogs; they never let him answer or respond, they insulted him, called him names; pathetic human behavior, by Democrats. We saw evil today; we saw &amp; heard raw racism, we saw our future if Biden is elected.  God help us...
The fact that you think Biden is far left outs you as an incredibly low info voter.üòÖ  Go read a book Sunshine...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If you took every time Joe Biden misspoke his entire life, it would not even equal a single Donald Trump press conference. We are supposed to applaud Trump when he lifts a bottle to his lips and can repeat 5 words.
As for the worse?  There's a strong argument to be made that Trump is in fact the lesser of the two evils.  It's indisputable that Biden has far more blood on his hands and destroyed lives under his belt than the Oompah Loompah in Chief does.ü§î#NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
I don't remember supporting Jordan, but I do support Barr's protecting federal property. I think the media is a disgraceful and dishonest bunch (both sides).  Biden is in early onset dementia in my view. Thanks for responding  Anyway, without snark, enjoy the football games!
I think Biden should pick Susan Rice as his VP. She is smart, charismatic, and capable. They also worked together during the Obama admin. Warren is my second choice. She should definitely be in his cabinet.
I don't know why #ShitLibs can't figure out why we won't vote for their candidate.  They'd lose their minds if a generic Repub was running with Biden's record.  #JoeBots are low info, VBNMW cultists that only think what they are programmed to.üòñ  #BlueMAGA or Red?  I'll pass.
So very true.. Trump likes grown women. Pedophile Obiden likes little girls and children....
He's destroyed so many lives at home &amp; abroad between his Warmongering love of Regime change &amp; his authoritarian, racist crime bill alone.  Biden is hot garbage in a restaurant dumpster during the second month of a sanitation workers strike.  In August.  He'd stink on ice...ü§Æ
I do not. In fact I go out of my way to have flag on dashboard &amp; display Biden bumper stickers, I wear flag scarf at luncheons &amp; use small flag on table for group lunch.  I have been approached re flags meaning. Always say it‚Äôs a good identifier of American citizens.

Starting to see Biden commercials here in SW Florida. They are positive and I find it refreshing after hearing Trump‚Äôs ugly, lying negative ones.
If Biden wins the Presidency, I would demand that each vote be investigated for fraudulent voters. It is a fact that many of the 42 million non citizens, many illegal, are registered to vote and many will break the law and vote. Voting is reserved for citizens only.
Biden has the questions before the press conference
Yet, Delusional Dems &amp; the Fake News Mainstream Media fails to question Basement Biden on his acts of corruption.
Biden knew the questions before getting them!
Is it me or is Joe Biden in a 7 second delay and in an alternate universe?
My money is on Biden knew the questions today!!!!!
So Biden is now saying we need to stop sending ourjobs out if thecountry. It is a great idea. However President Trump has been doing the job of bringing back our jobs since day 1. Biden is too busy plagiarising Trump‚Äôs ideas to know what he should do
They own it now.   They do t tell them to stop.   If you cute for Biden in Nov then you support this crap.  Trump on Nov 3 and it‚Äôs not even close !  üá∫üá∏
Since neither party will give any of them any support now is the best time to help get a 3rd party to 15%.  I'm not voting for the lesser of two sex pest conservatives.  Biden is hot garbage and so is your party.  If you have to silence the truth to win you don't deserve to. ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I mean I'm no Bernie Sanders supporter but I think he's not senile.. and not corrupt.  He's totally wrong.. but I think he means what he says and believes it..  Biden on the other hand is just a whore.. doing or saying anything to get elected.
I'm absolutely serious. Is there even one good reason to vote for Biden?  One?..  Help me here. I really don't get it.
Biden will never face Trump. His campaign will keep him hidden away allowing him out in only the most scripted and friendly environments. Now the VP pick will go toe to toe with Trump. She will be destroyed but at least her cognitive faculties will not be in question. #Trump2020

My interpretation was give in to the narrative that Dems &amp; GOP/ Magas &amp; Biden supporters are the same. Telling liberals not to vote for Biden is Trump-affirming &amp; as regressive as it gets.
That‚Äôs ridiculous. Biden was VP for eight years and is a great American.

My personal opinion is that Joe Biden needs to get out on social media much more whether it's having a town hall on MSNBC or NBC or any of the channels and to reach out more to the Latino and black communities they are waiting to hear from him. This is how we have to do it¬°
Lol Joe Biden doesn't have anything to do with the protests. Most of the protesters don't even want to vote for him. These protests are literally Trump's protests. Righties love to say that this is what it'll be like under Biden, but it's literally like that now under Trump??
Well apparently his visual acuity is right up there with Biden's mental acuity.
America is safer with Biden in the basement. He is just another  empty suit that the Dems can control. A vote for Biden is a vote for communism.
And still, where's Basement Biden?
Remember when Trump was campaigning for Bernie Sanders to beat Joe Biden so that he could incorrectly claim that Democrats are "Socialists?"  He failed, but that doesn't mean he won't gaslight Americans into believing that Joe Biden is the Trojan Horse Candidate for Socialism.
Peter Schweizer, Clinton Cash author, has a new book,  "Fallout".  This book describes the corruption of Biden, Obama, Clinton with Russia and China. Claims Biden is even more corrupt than Clinton .  Remember, Dems always accuse you of that which they are guilty of

Yeah you sure don't want make it a Trump or Biden choice. Trouble for you is that is the election we have and sooner or later Biden is going to have to prove he can be president.
Liz Peek: Biden-Democrat sweep in November would destroy country. Here's their plan
What gets lost in all of this analysis is that neither Biden or Democrats are fit to govern.  You trusted Pelosi and the Demicrats in 2018.. and look what happened.

Who'd have thought that Biden's choice on VP running mate (eg, E Warren etc) could have bearing on Facebook's (=Zuckerberg) influence on 2020 election? DJT is chummying up w/Mr Z, and in 2016 GOP was integrated into FB platform to max, while Dems declined.
As Bill Maher said to Joe Biden, ‚ÄúGrow a pair.‚Äù
Obviously you haven‚Äôt read a single plan on Biden‚Äôs website.  He literally is calling for more police and more border protection.
AOC and Biden can go fly a kite somewhere else. Scary to think these people are trying to destroy what we have worked so hard to build. Get out and vote people!
Funny how everyone on here calling trump out for making excuses yet if Biden were to turn down the first pitch for being busy.. y‚Äôall would applaud and say he‚Äôs doing a fine job.  but don‚Äôt forget Biden said ‚Äúi don‚Äôt want t kids growing up in a evil jungle‚Äù

OK, Biden's best Veep pick is Sen. Kamala Harris. Yeah, I said it. I was a Warren guy in the primaries, but that's not where the voters were at, so OK cool. Joe is gonna need an Enforcer in the Senate, Schumer is a lost cause. Warren would be perfect as Senate Majority Leader.

Not only that, were talking about the guy who wanted to allow states to have the authority to overturn Roe V Wade, which according to Biden, "Went Too far!".  He also believes, "Women don't have sole agency over their bodies."  Yeah, he sounds like a regular feminist.ü§îüôÑ #NoJoe.

Yeah, if you are pro life, do u choose the party of pro baby killing &amp; protects criminals from the death penalty?  Or the party that is anti abortion, &amp; a handful of death penalties befall criminals each year?  No logical prolife person would choose Biden based off this argument

You support Biden. You are not the solution, you are part of the problem.
Yes Biden is weak, very weak ! But that‚Äôs total bullshit that because of Biden being a dishrag only this will make Trump look strong! Dodo poop ! Not at all true !!!

I agree that Biden is not a socialist.
You could stand to drop the "women for Biden" shit  Donald Trump is a serial abuser but it's sad y'all drag everyone's feelings out for bs you don't mean
He voted absentee, big difference, but you know that because you are Joe Biden‚Äôs handler.
Read the tea leaves. Biden is going to get trounced
He donates his whole check! He‚Äôs only been in office 4 3 1/2 yrs he could stay n office 4 40 yrs&amp; still wouldn‚Äôt be as corrupt as Biden
As an aside, I'm not saying I'm happy. I'm not. But if this elects Biden and ousts the orange abomination, cool. We can always add to and tweak things as we go.
I understand why people are miffed that Medicare for All and legalization of marijuana are not on the DNC platform. I am, too.   It doesn't mean that they can't be after Biden is elected and the Senate flips. Seems like we're avoiding polarizing issues.

Why? Is he going to tell lies and we can catch him? Yes. Will that lead to consequences? No, not at all. The House hearings are always just a waste of time. Enough with the football scam, Lucy. They have made it all very tiresome. At least watching Biden keeps hope alive.
What wonderful planted Pablum questions from the mainstream media to Joe Biden who, it appears, was being fed answers either through his telepromter or other electronic means on his podium.  Probably, like with Hillary, he was fed the questions in advance.

omg you just gave us everything about old donnie, you know we asked about Joe Biden
Did you know that whenever a President is ordered to go his bunker he is forced to do so by the secret service..Its not voluntarily. Biden on the other hand is not being forced. He just wants to avoid all the hard questions he will face if he campaigns the traditional way üòÅ lol
The facts are plenty in regards to what Joe Biden has done compared to the dipshit in the WH.
not endorsing Biden is about the dumbest fking thing you can do. congratulations on being a total zero of a representative of the Democratic Party.
You must be talking about Biden. He is the one who has been hiding in his basement lately üòÅ
So  you know so much about this.. maybe you should be investigated on your back ground. Again Biden is not our President yet. He will take everything up once we get old donnie out of the White House.  Be patient and watch what a real President can do.
Of course did anyone expect differently.  Biden will have to survive sometime.
A lot of info on Trump's finances and taxes is now available. He has broken several laws for tax fraud on taxes and bank loans. He is a criminal and will be in prison hopefully soon. Biden avoiding the debates may be a good idea.
And you are maybe more mentally challenged than Biden
How sick are you like me of Republicans calling all Democrats, Socialist ITS A LIE, Joe Biden is a moderate leaning towards conservative as I am, the Republicans are so desperate as to go all the way RIGHT, embracing lies and creating hysteria in America

I don't think history will record those in our government, MSM &amp; others that knew my verifiable story &amp; did nothing, will be judged well by their followers/constituents.   Imagine; 2x months before midterm elections America talking about Obama/Biden #ShadowNet; NOT impeachment?

People like you that spread lies about innocent men should be prosecuted, that‚Äôs very dangerous! Now why don‚Äôt u talk about Tera Reade who Biden sexually assaulted, she reported to Congress, but they said they won‚Äôt release the papers! Her mother even called Into Larry king
If the Dems actually put on a candidate worth voting for most people would probably not vore for Trump. But it's starting to look like 2016 all over again. Biden might not be as bad as Hillary but the insane leftists tactics are pushing more voters toward Trump each day.
If you are 'dead' you will not only test positive as well, but also vote mush-brain biden in Nov.
That is because Biden is Obsequious, the Dems. Are raising money for the lobotomy, or doesn't obama care pay for that.

I don't think Joe Biden is the best Democrats could find. I think there are many Democrats who have what it takes to be President. In fact, I have a list of 210 of them. Adam Schiff is one of them. Some are mayors. Some governors and LGs. There are so many.

I believe it was less secret voters than that there was a group of undecided which the posters had split 50-50 when they did their reports. Turns out they broke overwhelmingly 90-10 for Trump.  Today when asked undecideds overwhelmingly say they will go for Biden
Doesn‚Äôt say much for her integrity or her intellect. I would‚Äôve thought she would‚Äôve been better off waiting till 2024 either to replace Trump or come against Biden.  If she helps dump Pence and they lose where does that leave her?
And because he his one of the largest show people will listen to him. (Not me) That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs more important that he stops with his opinions! It‚Äôs either Trump or Biden!
If he is willing to make that statement give them something to consider! we have Trump or Biden. What is his point, to tell his followers not to vote for Biden. His statements and opinions dont make sense and again I have no respect for a grown man who arch his eyebrows

BIDENS SECT OF STATE:  Yes folks, ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs Biden in the basement, aka sleepy joe,has appointed this know it all, shake down artist, as sect of state. His action network
SILENCE:   BLM‚Äôs leaders, using the Floyed homicide, (waiting for a jury finding), to stoke up violence, burning, looting.  Antifa, seeing a opening, joined in. We all see it in Democratic run cities, yet no word of condemnation comes from SHUMER Or POLOSI.  But where is BIDEN.
Meghan is very weird always. Biden was a great friend to her father but she always challenges anyone who isn't a fan of hers.
Obama dropped Biden like a crack pipe
Saturday, July 25th from 2PM ‚Äì 4PM EST, we are discussing how Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to build America back better fits into our community and how you can get involved. We‚Äôll also make sure everyone is trained on how to make calls! I can‚Äôt wait to see you there!
Biden called for the basics of fighting a pandemic since Jan. Not sure what new ideas you‚Äôre looking for how about the old ones ‚Äîgetting a national strategy, invoking the defense act to have enough PPE, mandating things like masks and social distancing.  Your guy did zero zilch
Meanwhile Biden has been working for months on a viral virtual convention let‚Äôs hope he used the time well
Obama waited months to even get near Biden they were never seen together. The only reason Obama did it is because he knew it was the only way that they were going to get a democratic win in their opinion
Join  in Cen &amp; N PBC this Saturday, July 25 at 2 pm ET to discuss Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to build America back better &amp; how you can get involved. We‚Äôll also make sure everyone is trained on how to make calls! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  #Biden
Biden wishes schools taught more about Islam  via  But no teaching about Christianity???  Madelyn Murray OHare is twisting in her barrel I bet.
Biden is not the current president, maybe you need a cognitive test Ted.The fact that  is saying he can beat #Biden proves he is in the race to take votes from #biden and ensure his homie Trumps re-election. #kanye u are a sucka! Please #vote #biden and send Kanye and Trump back to their narcissistic looney bins.

Wow! So soon! A plan? House hearing finds US no closer to plan as coronavirus is 'raging out of control' ‚Äì live
Typical lying GOP. Obvi, Obama and Biden were handed The great recession from Bush. They took unemployment from 10.5 to 4.6. Trumps claim to fame is giving his buddies $1.3 trillion which they put in the market,  which made the market go up. Big deal. Americans know you‚Äôre a liar
We did not see this violence during the Obama/Biden years, we are seeing dystopian America under  .
Got them all!

Joe Biden Says Arrest Criminals &amp; Lefty Communists Turn On Him! - YouTube
U are so left wing not even in the middle .. Biden HAS not denounced defunding the police.. u just hate trump &amp; all ur words are slanted .. learn journalism again please
Interesting that BIASED, LEFTIST, TRUMP HATING South Florida radio station  has said NOTHING about the current Rasmussen poll showing Trump approval rating at 50% vs Biden 48%.  While they blast out every PHONY poll they can find that might show Biden leading Trump.
‚ÄúPeople want to know they‚Äôre invited to the table,‚Äù Jones said, saying  has said ‚Äúeverybody come to the table and let‚Äôs reason together, like we say in church.‚Äù
they may be!! Try Eleven Million of us Tax Payers Dollars to buy a House with? I'm not very nice when I work "Hard So They Don't Have To!" Share the Love as said! This never happened. Biden is a Black Obomba as stated in his so-what-thought!I I refuse to be taken again!
Thanks for the mention!!!
Man I hope her hard work isn‚Äôt interrupted by youthful, keen-minded Joe Biden... getting in a car accident?
We can‚Äôt kid, Trump has a real chance of winning this.  Biden must not pick someone most Americans hearing her name say ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù We need them to say ‚ÄúI know her, she can lead this nation if something ever happens to Biden.‚Äù  That‚Äôs the perception needed the moment VP is announced.
Never forget this tweet: Joe Biden. Last OCTOBER.
Biden in his late appearances, plagiarizes again! All President Trump's campaign guidelines! Promises!

You are absolutely correct!  Definitely run for President so you could show America how to be competent!   Biden might not be as smart as you!
She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
I bet Biden announces his VP on Monday.
Well said. Too bad we couldn‚Äôt have Biden/Obama.
18% approval for the demacratic leaders...  That explains why there are no Biden yard signs.
I travel all over... I see U.S. flags on cars, I see Trump written on cars, Everywhere I go.  Yet I have not seen even one Biden yard sign...  The embarrassment must be great.
Dear Joe Biden:PLEASE PLEASE PICK KAREN BASS AS YOUR VP! Thanks from Florida, see you in November
Weekend at Bernies ,tell your boss Biden its ok to step down now thank him for his service for us !!!!
This Biden tweet is from October 2019
Brain Dead Biden
Yes many of the born again followers who are spreading that Mr Biden is a Marxist
How about making sure more of the GOP votes for Joe Biden. Trump should leave the WH to a jail.
Certainly, Biden will do less. By far.
"We just want healthcare"  Are you even old enough to not qualify for your parent's ins? Do you know what it meant pre- Obama / Biden &amp; the ACA to be less than 26 &amp; want health ins? You'd only be able to afford a casualty policy in case you broke your leg skateboarding.
Wow who wrote that for him? BIDEN PLEASE DEBATE OUR PRESIDENT!!!!
Trump Defends ‚ÄòDelay the Election‚Äô Tweet, Even Though He Can‚Äôt Do It
Crenshaw High that's where I'm from... I'm voting Biden cuz I know a 80% of the Black church were begging the feds to do something &amp; supported this law. These people that watched a gangbanger movie or 2 don't know a damn thing about stepping over crackheads to go to school.
Because hope will take away chance of Biden winning..
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.
Vice President Joe Biden, please tell President Barack Obama to return Abigail to Pollyanna.  THE WORLD IS WATCHING!!!  Pollyanna üá∫üá≤ üèõ üá∫üá≤

Latest information from Lancet regarding the risk factors for DEMENTIA . I wonder which ones contributed to Joe Biden‚Äôs mental condition?
Landslide! Only a fool would vote for Biden
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
‚ÄúMy Statement on Donald Trump‚Äôs Shameless Repeal of DACA‚Äù by Joe Biden
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now‚Äîyou won‚Äôt get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone‚Äôs ideas before we vote.
We will vote!! Biden 2020.
It is fear that is causing him to try and delay the inevitable, which is the American people choosing Joseph Biden. I mean how appalling is it that the sitting president doesn‚Äôt have enough respect to attend Congressman John Lewis‚Äô funeral. Thank God he only has 5 months left!
The great American hero will be Biden when he wins and takes office
is a clown and should retire along with Trump, Biden, McConnell, Pelosi, Schumer and all of the other politicians over 65!  And, we need term limits now!
Let‚Äôs say there is a massive Covid outbreak, Joe Biden gets the disease and dies Oct 15. Would there be a push for the election date to be moved?
A Biden bro was mean to me on Twitter now I can't justify voting for Biden. Maybe think twice before you go around calling people selfish.
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
If God help us Biden wins the covid-19 will miraculously disappear January 2021.
No matter who Biden picks as VP, the GOP will pull her apart.
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!
It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
The same you as the lazy deserve a lazy president like Biden, you will see what he is going to convert to the USA.  TRUMP2020
Send Biden to a nursing home, he's decrepit
Must be a Joe Biden supporter
They‚Äôre not switching out Biden while he‚Äôs up. Far more likely that Biden gets voted in, then they do the switch.
So we get GDP figures today. It should be a good day for Biden to blame Trump not the Chinese his handlers but Trump. It‚Äôs a pandemic Joe and you couldn‚Äôt have done anything but probably put more people in harms way. But go ahead get the hair on your legs standing up.
She just has been asking every guest ‚Äúwhat if he doesn‚Äôt leave?‚Äù And every guest has said a variation of ‚Äúafter Biden is sworn in, he‚Äôs not the president and no one has to take his orders.‚Äù William Barr can‚Äôt body block Joe from the Oval.
She'll lock up more blacks along with Biden than the both ever have before.
Just Biden... no need for anyone else.
Can‚Äôt wait for Biden to get in there and executive order everything you did right back into existence. Are ya ready for it!!!!
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will make excellent use of the newly modernized West Wing!
I thought about that, but they like to have American fighter jets. Biden makes one call and he‚Äôs in a diplomatic bag, on a plane to Guantanamo.
If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn‚Äôt win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.
Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll stay on the job after he loses. I think he‚Äôll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
The best reason for third party simps to go vote for Biden this year: you think he'll be strong enough for a second term? Let him be marginally better than Trump for 4 years. Then you primary his then 82 year old ass with a real progressive.
Biden loses with Harris. No brainer.
Then Trump said he is rolling back certain fair housing standards and I decided, even if I have to stand in line, I‚Äôll vote for Biden. (2/2)
Ok, ok. I was pretty adamant that I wasn‚Äôt going to vote for Biden. Then Trump has protesters forcibly removed in DC and I was like, ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll vote for Biden.‚Äù Then Trump sent federal troops to my home town and I was like, ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll vote absentee.‚Äù (1/2)
The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.
#97Days Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
Yes- that‚Äôs where the OP started. Our conversation started about whether or not she‚Äôs been a good senator. Anyway- this is a pointless discussion because again, it‚Äôs not being made in good faith. Vote Biden regardless üëçüèª
I really dislike Biden‚Äôs substanceless campaign. Every corporate Dem should be thanking God that Trump is so incompetent.  What does build back better even mean? You talkin bout our D grade infrastructure? Our stagnant wages? Our student loan crisis? WHAT?!
Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
Every single day at every single meeting with heads of state or otherwise, Trump turns it into a political rally and an attack on #Biden. And the slavish press covers his propaganda no matter what the meeting was intended for. Shameless.
But my initial read as Biden‚Äôs campaign being cutesy with the VP slot seems inaccurate; it looks like the campaign is dealing with a revolt from loud backers, which has spilled into the press. So I guess we‚Äôre playing our part.
Vote Trump anyway!  Do you honestly believe Biden has any reasoning left?
Exactly. Voters don‚Äôt care. That‚Äôs why flogging the veepstakes is a dead horse spectacle. But it sounds like there is real dissent in the ranks, and it is not Biden waffling. That‚Äôs why we have to be vocal. Sorry for all the tweets. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Latinos are a major force to elect VP Biden President. Register and vote. Let‚Äôs get this done.

The Racist is Really showing his True Color.   Don't Worry  President Biden will change it Back.
So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it‚Äôs not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn‚Äôt want to hear.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"
Looks like it's going to be Kamala Harris more and more. I think Obama and Hillary are pushing for her behind the scenes.
I‚Äôve got news for you, Joe: you have just been added to Joe Biden‚Äôs VP shortlist! üëçüòÉ
Nuh hear the man seh him don't want Biden to win

If your family worked so hard to be able to afford a middle class home wouldn‚Äôt you be pissed if someone moving in next to you doesn‚Äôt have to pay at all? This is what you want from Biden though. Btw, keep calling black/brown people ‚Äúlow income‚Äù when in reality it‚Äôs all races.
I am not sure if investors release that a Biden administration would have people's health as a top priority and while big pharma might not be their favorite constituency, there is no real reason to fear a Biden win.

Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to fix the wage gap black women face is very good.
I can see Biden/Ocasio
Stuart I was living in England for the Kinnock/ Major election and remember the front page of the Sun. Kinnock‚Äôs head in a light bulb with the headline. Will the last person out please turn off the light. It‚Äôs fitting here if Biden wins. God help us.
It‚Äôs a deliberate leak (reveal) as a trial balloon. Trying to judge the reaction for having a VP who is a descendant of slave owners and an aggressive prosecutor of minorities using the Crime Bill written by Biden. Joes handlers don‚Äôt do anything with a poll.
A Biden/ Harris ticket is a disaster waiting to happen. Both with anger issues and a history of passing and enforcing laws against minorities. How can you vote for a ticket with a defendant of slave owners on it?
So Jellyfish Joe Biden may have slipped up and it‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs picking a VP who is a descendant of slave owners, one who prosecuted Biden‚Äôs Crime Bill aggressively and jailed thousands of minorities for offenses she herself admits to doing as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris
If I was Joe Biden...(Who I am not) I would not pick Kamala Harris...I‚Äôd pick Barbara Lee from California who voted against Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Invasion or Nina Turner...Since he said woman of color....
Newsmax has commercials all over tv saying text should you would but for Trump(smiling) or Biden(grainy pic). Says ‚Äúmake your voice heard‚Äù. They‚Äôre very right winged supporter of Trump, makes Fox News look centrist. &amp; they get your phone number if you text them!!
911? Police?  What does that have to do with Biden and segregation and busing? You're borderline incoherent, and that makes you a waste of time. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to put the real info into this thread (which you couldn't respond logically to.)
Biden loves the cops crushing people as much as anyone. They all love it.
üëè#blacknotDemocrat! I don‚Äôt like Biden..
Brother, I will never judge what side of the political spectrum you fall in line with, but defending that racist dimwit, who clearly can‚Äôt speak a full sentence is laughable. Biden has 40 yrs of complete and utter racist policies and now has lost his mind. This ain‚Äôt about Trump

We control the entire govt Biden gonna have to sign whatever we put on his desk. Or we gonna be in the streets.
My bet offer is open any time you want.Biden with a 14 point lead I saw today. Easy money for you. Wondering why you won‚Äôt though?
And if you don't believe that, critically investigate Barrack Obama's record. He didn't embarrass us on Twitter everyday but he expanded the Patriot Act and killed thousands of people in drone warfare. Now the Dems want me to vote for Biden, a integral part of that admin. Ha

You mean it is NOT OKAY to question the illegal activities of BIDEN and his abuse of power?  What is wrong with people in here?  I am GLAD he asked these questions. I don't want that pedo rat Biden in the White House.
Please you‚Äôre the party of corruption led by the likes of Clinton and Biden and their family slush (initiatives) funds.
And it increasingly seems like  only strategy to keep excitement is to prolong the VP announcement, when it‚Äôs plainly been causing more dischord than active speculation. Which makes Biden look weak, indecisive, uncaring about the shit posts his VP noms get continually.
Biden pretending he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt know who his VP choice is already is like Logic pretending he‚Äôs really retiring. Do you understand my exasperation?
I voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and now with everything he‚Äôs done good or bad and after watching Joe Biden answer questions I‚Äôm sure he read a week ago so peoples he is working for can answer for him. I know me and mine will be voting for President Trump! Thank God for him.

Wasn't a big Biden fan but he's crushing right now. Tune in! Important shit.  #BuildBackBetter
ignorant response. You‚Äôve missed the point totally. I suppose you also don‚Äôt think there should be an even playing field for African-Americans? Women need an equal playing field in the realm of power. It‚Äôs people like you who are keeping that from happening. Bravo Joe Biden!
I love how GOP reps are crying that there was no congressional oversight over the Obama Biden administration with the doj. What were the 16 investigations of Hillary Clinton and Benghazi with no indictments????? needs to shut up.. he's going down with Trump
AG Barr, when has  asked for the violence and attacks to stop! Instead of saying ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù, he could speak to the protestors. Fcking stupid statement to make of Biden without the same for the POS in Chief!
Lol conservatives are liking and retweeting my last tweet without reading my profile. I also don‚Äôt like Barr either. I wish he would resign. But I think there‚Äôs bigger fish to fry than this hearing like electing Biden.
I hope Biden chooses Elizabeth Warren who will be tough on corporations and the pharmaceutical companies.
So, since there are about 100 days before the election and we have to choose between Biden and Trump, what do you suggest we do??? ü§î
Is this Biden??
Barr is on Capitol Hill. I'm surprised he showed. He's there to lie and disrespect Congress.   President Biden's (üôèüôèüôè) AG can bring charges.  House subpoenas will mean something.
Ana,  Wants to stop riots. Biden calls them protests and Adler says those people do not exist.
If one of them points a finger at Obama and Biden, then what?
If Biden wins (üôèüôèüôè) it will be 1st female VP.
Anarchists love destrucion , they are our enemies and are frequently supported by the far left communists in the Congress and Senate. The puppet Biden without leadership will lead America  to chaos and division. President Trump is the only one prepared for stop them.
I will be surprised if Barr shows up.   If he does he will be disrespectful and dishonest.   President Biden's AG can get Barr for Lying to Congress if that's the case.
I wont accept biden I‚Äôll take a president that pays for pussy before one that fucks kids so lets fuckin go with the draft cards

Biden should start every debate with this line.
I feel like most people whenever her name is mentioned gets happy. I know I do. Im voting for Biden anyway but I‚Äôd be happier with Rice on the ticket!
The idea is that Biden gets the "25th," allowing his VP to come in, unelected, as President.  But yeah, very likely wouldn't be a socialist president and would be an establishment candidate.
Why hasn‚Äôt Biden announced his VP pick yet?

read your article on secret MAGA. I‚Äôve heard a diff plan that is not about being afraid but deliberately skewering polls to Biden to create false narrative. Heard it from a friend who knows a trumper who is part of the secret plan so to speak.
You said multiple times Democrats are socialists in your tweet feed... heck you have gone as far as calling The NBA: Marxists .. The fact is... You either believe Biden will close the banking system or not. Period..on my side I do Believe Trump will send Feds to hurt civilians
Vote Biden, make America Honest again!
Release your tax returns. Admit that you have handled COVID-19 worse than Boris Johnson has when Obama and Biden has a set plan in place for their succuessor. Admit that you sent federal troops to worngfully and unconstitutionally arrest people.Unbelievable!Biden using Ms Martinez of Wisconsin who apparently lost her sick mom in April accusing Trump!The ad says Paid By Biden! Vile indeed using the pain of other &amp; paying for it!

Biden is supposedly considering someone named Bass as his VP.  Can you say fish face?
Agree. My only fear is that Biden may feel that he‚Äôll be overshadowed by her, charismatic as Kamala is (which would be a shame).
Yeah that‚Äôs not entirely true - the entire dem platform is catered to republicans- they have zero leftist policies and nothing for independent voters - trump is even to the left of biden on foreign policy
What is your plan Mr Biden ??a lot of criticism but no plan ???

Not Donald Trump falsely attacking Joe Biden for not wanting to pick a Latino VP when HIS Vice President is   *checks notes*   Mike Pence
They‚Äôre already attacking Biden in Spanish TV ads for not picking a Latina VP. The ad is meant to turn brown people against black people. It isn‚Äôt going to work but it shows where they‚Äôre going.

Prediction: Trump camp is going to abandon the ‚Äòlaw &amp; order‚Äô campaign for a bit since it‚Äôs not working.They will be throwing everything at the wall to see if anything sticks.Most likely strategy is to attack Biden as a racist/sexist &amp; attack the VP candidate to depress D turnout.
ü§£ü§£ü§£ more peopl votes for McCain against Obama than Bernie voters voted for trump. Stop putting shit candidates out there and you would get more votes. It doesn‚Äôt get more establishment than Clinton and Biden.
You're citing the Change Research poll. For what that's worth, it's rated poorly by 538. Other polls show a more sizable lead. Five days earlier, the better-rated pollster Fox had Biden far outside the MOE in each rust belt state

I‚Äôve been suspicious of Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP-pick since last year.  My nightmare scenario is Biden steps down after wife declares him unfit to serve, Congress invokes the 25th, Harris becomes President, then she chooses Hillary as her VP.  A fkn nightmare for our republic.
Just like in the House neither the Speaker or the president pro tempore has to actually be a member of Congress. In this situation the senate dems could choose Biden to be the pro tempore on January 3rd and then he would become president on January 21st when trump term ended.
What‚Äôs at stake this Nov is the future of America... as we know it. If Biden is elected, you can kiss everything goodbye üëãüèª
I'm no Biden fan but I don't think this is true. His polling lead is wider.
what else can we do, stay with orange man who is closer to a psychotic break than Kanye? It's so disgusting that's it's come down to this situation of choosing the lesser of both evils but we can surely make Biden the president who also doesn't get reelected.
And some want to vote for Biden so he can kiss Xi‚Äôs arse like did Putin !
Wow! So soon! A plan? House hearing finds US no closer to plan as coronavirus is 'raging out of control' ‚Äì live

You are wrong, the Castro stuff has PLENTY of teeth here in Florida. Trump has been running ads accusing Democrats of being "socialists" for weeks on Hispanic media, and it ABSOLUTELY moves the needle here. This would be a very bad choice for Biden if he wants to win Florida.
That‚Äôs kinda fair but I think the primary process turned out to be important and useful. Biden got better as it went on and Democratic bench got stronger.
we got some former candidates raising money for Biden via ‚Äúgrassroots movements‚Äù and some just sucking cash out of Super PACs lmfaooooooooo like I cannot take the hypocrisy and headassery I‚Äôm seeing
Republicans are planning a mass attack against Biden using information from pro-Russian agents
I hate that we‚Äôve resorted to a 2nd primary- except none of us get a vote. I sincerely believe Biden knew who he was going to pick a long time ago &amp; this whole thing has been an attempt to amplify multiple voices. It was working that way until recently. Now it‚Äôs needlessly ugly.
hearing people talk highly about Biden and obama is so cringeyüòñ
Joe Biden trying to win black votes
I went ahead &amp; ordered a Biden/Warren 2020 t-shirt today. If she isn't selected, I'll have a T-shirt; if she is selected, the country will have a brilliant &amp; amazing VP next year.
with all of the actual points you could make against Trump you chose misinformation claiming he denied the virus existed yet it was Biden who called Trump a racist when he banned travel from China early in the Pandemic  but at least you are correct on one account- we won't forget
The Biden campaign should be concerned about the secret $400,000 settlement  office paid to settle 'gender harassment' claims against a top aide named Larry Wallace.
Trump and Biden are pretty equal on their terrible policies so yeah a vote for biden is a vote for trumps policies and a vote for trump is a vote for bidens policies

I think the decision is already made but the announcement was pushed back due to the John Lewis death and funeral. It would‚Äôve been in bad taste to make a such positive announcement during a week of public mourning. DT likes to do things like that, not Joe Biden.

I am hoping Biden surrounds himself with good people. Now the Republicans will block everything, make a big deal out of it all as it is now towards Trump.  It will be a tug of war but maybe we can gain back some int‚Äôl respect?  And not leave a hole in the int‚Äôl scene at least.
Interesting that BIASED, LEFTIST, TRUMP HATING South Florida radio station  has said NOTHING about the current Rasmussen poll showing Trump approval rating at 50% vs Biden 48%.  While they blast out every PHONY poll they can find that might show Biden leading Trump.

Exactly. I think most of us are not as excited with Biden himself.   The vote now is against Trump. We need to move on.
I think this can be like when McCain was with Palin.  She contributed tremendously to his loss.  I think Biden has to be smart but at this point we should all be so excited for Biden that it should not matter, yet here we are. Unexcited.
I myself don't even like Biden as a candidate and I would feel like I am voting for the pink panter if I were to have to vote for Kamala Harris but I think now it is clear what we have. My vote is not for Biden but it is against Trump.   At this point it's not  about the tkt

I was talking Biden. But I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs terribly happy with Trump either. Collapsed his bonds market. Had real issues with his economy due to denial of dollars.
After 47 years in Washington you think Biden now knows how to fix America.  Yes you are a fool. He's been problem.
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
‚ÄúWhen Biden told reporters...he would choose a running mate in the first week of August, two aides told CNN that the timing of an announcement was more likely to be pushed back until the week of August 10. But Biden's advisers gave him a deadline of next week to make up his mind‚Äù
I've been telling people for months that I intend to write in Bernie, part because he got robbed and to piss off anyone bothered by that. I can be reasonable, but Biden has done absolutely nothing to earn my vote I don't care how bad orange man is
Education :)
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
Looks like Curbelo won by a little less than 12 in 2016. I get the point, and it‚Äôs not safe D. That said, it went D in 2018 despite lower margins on top ticket races. If Biden wins by 18-20, will ticket splitting save CG?
It sounds good for Biden so I believe this one
Black people have been getting used politically for years by Dems to our detriment. That continues this election year. Democracts have put up the worse candidate for issues of impact to Black people. If you don‚Äôt believe me look at Joe Biden‚Äôs draconian record on black issues.

I have absolutely zero doubts Trump will be re-elected and we'll retake the House on his coattails. 2/3rds of Biden voters don't even like Biden, they just hate Trump. We saw how THAT worked out for Romney in 2012.
So don‚Äôt go guilting people for not voting because the system is broken and it‚Äôs absolutely idiotic to think people should vote for the lesser of two evils and see that as ‚Äúprogress.‚Äù The only reason why Biden isn‚Äôt seen as negative as Trump is because his mind is so fried
What is it that Biden provides that Trump doesn‚Äôt? Both are against UBI Healthcare for all, ending foreign occupation, Free education, etc. there isn‚Äôt a single policy that Biden supports that I‚Äôm in favor for. Tired of neoliberals thinking people have to settle.

1) Isn't funny? The very same pundits, corporate media outlets and their pollsters - none of whom saw the Trump phenomenon triumphing - are claiming Biden has it in the bag.  They apparently never got the memo about the 2016 election: politics isn't like money ball.

At least Biden has a brain and empathy and he cares about the country. He doesn‚Äôt want to politically divide the country , or be racist like you, or to promotpeople to get sick and not wear masks and promoting fraud in all your 20,000 lies. You are owned by Putin!  You will lose!

These people are delusional.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve changed parties, voting RED this November.  They criticize like if there is a ‚ÄúGuideline to Combat a COVID Pandemic‚Äù and was not followed.  They cannot even say something good about Biden. So, they criticize.
I think it's great that folks from outside of this country would vote for him. If eligible, Trump could run and win the presidency both here in the US and in Russia. Bet Biden can't say the same.

Wait if Biden got anywhere close to a new deal, that would be less desirable than the status quo? I respect everyone's opinion and embrace reasoned debate. You and I will not find common ground on this issue but I very much respect your opinion.
Yes i do but I'm just saying, having biden would be the worse choive to have as president. No police, segregation may make a comeback, far more blacks in jail. You can say what you want about trump but before covid or in this the chinese virus, he was doing great
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.
Honestly, if you're looking for a president that's willing to do more for blacks, I'd recommend trumps since biden wants to imprision/incarcerate more blacks and not to mention that he's a segregationist
We hope that you fixed that.  Biden for President!

America sees Biden for what he is: a 50 year career politician who‚Äôs been a huckster and a liar.   Another effete charlatan, another bag of empty promises all aimed at keeping you parasites on the dole.
It‚Äôs literally our only hope, because unless high ranking generals come out and stand next to biden with a contingent of armed troops at his back, trump ain‚Äôt stepping down and he doesn‚Äôt care about laws or the constitution or anything else

18-30 voters and black voters will NOT turn out to vote for a candidate they aren't excited about. Also former Bernie Campaign staff are saying no way Bernie voters vote for Biden.  We are headed for an epic Trump rout and take back of the House. This will be huge.
I am outraged that a Trump is giving a campaign speech as opposed to a Presser. Biden should have equal time.
I'll explain what is happening here.  No one gives a damn about Biden. No one likes Biden. No one is excited about Biden. 2/3 of the Biden vote in a recent poll were voting AGAINST Trump, not FOR Biden. 90% of Trump voters were voting FOR Trump.  If that hold, Biden loses YUGE.

Yes let's vote for biden so he can imprision and segregate blacks. Let's vote for biden so he can get rid of the police completely. That sure sounds like a good president. Definitely sounds better than the orange man who's made black lives better and made drug prices low.

That's always the way to look at things. Biden has a strong law and order past. While very pro union, he seems to a believer in the war on drugs. If he picks Kamala Harris for VP her past on law and order and his would put then to the right of Trumpty Dumpty on law and order.
I think of Warren as secret conservative.  I think of Biden as a social conservative but also a union paternalist type, supporting more Gov spending for the poor and middle class, but pro drug war and law and order.

Harris is great; so are Rice, Duckworth, Demings, Warren &amp; most who‚Äôve been considered. Biden should pick the person he can partner best with. Harris would be a perfect AG; Rice, Sec. St.; Duckworth, DOD; Demings, DHLS; Warren, Treasury. Lots of talent &amp; lots of hard work to do.

Your Tweet exactly shows where the Democrats are coming from you could exactly mirror word by word to explain the Democratic party and Democratic leaders. That have been in power now for 30 years such as Biden who has Alzheimer's disease and has no immediate treatment. #OBAMAGATE
To all you wonderful black American patriots out there  Joe Biden has a brief message for you.

Joe is for strengthening public schools so our economy is competitive. He is also for a wide ranging reform of the criminal justice system. If Joe Biden is so bad for the black community why did they back him in such strong numbers during the primary which made him the nominee?
My point is Trump has done and said such disgusting things that it earned the endorsement of David Duke. Guess who can‚Äôt the same thing? Joe Biden.
How racist could Biden actually be if he was Barack Obama‚Äôs VP for 8 years LOL
it's sad to me how angry this apparently makes you, because i'm really trying, IMHO, to help you out.  i care about you and have admired your writings about movies and beyond for a long time.  i'm even a biden guy.

There are several on the third circle I don't recognize but also some real homies on there  I'm just glad Joe Biden didn't make it in the third circle
I've increasingly had similar thought. Just by being himself, he's acting the way a president would normally act. Hope many conservative voters can set aside policy differences and see the need to elect Joe Biden. We need to restore sense of decency and dignity to presidency.
Never Biden, never trump
Why doesn‚Äôt Biden take it???
I just mailed my primary ballot for Gainesville FL (separate from the general election primary). If there is any voter fraud nationwide, it'll be dt stuffing the boxes with forged ballots...for himself (predictably stupid) or for Biden (cleverly stupid).
The problem isn‚Äôt you or me or even them. The problem is the mindset of America and the people. We are broken like an air conditioner waiting on a part from somewhere. That part won‚Äôt be in till November 3rd. Make your #vote count.    #Biden.
Here‚Äôs why everyone is suddenly talking about Karen Bass as Biden‚Äôs potential VP
They will be in panic mode when dt is deep sixed. There will be a culling cuz there won't be enough bad news about VP Biden to fill the airwaves. Still, They each have their own unique and lovely quality (we're talking REAL newseries here, not FOXfeckers)
No. It's not that we don't care...it's that Trump is destroying this country and Biden is all we have right now. I absolutely voted for Bernie. But not voting for Biden right now, as the candidate, is throwing your vote away.
Mr. Biden, each time you express a thought it becomes more and more concerning. Do you realize you are being used and abused?
Can Biden even get it up?
The problem is that if the truth doesn‚Äôt come out before the election, and if Biden somehow wins, then the truth will NEVER come out. The investigation will be shut down. It‚Äôs not about political points...it‚Äôs about truth, and the truth needs to come to light.
Remarkable the lengths right wing groups are willing to go to help elect Biden

YOU need the help! The day after he shut down travel from China, Biden was calling him every name in the book for doing it and it continued until after Pelosi invited EVERYONE to  congregate in Asian areas.
The reams of proposals reflect Biden‚Äôs belief that the nation faces immense challenges that require a far-reaching government response not seen since the New Deal.

Yes I'm really disappointed too. I planned on going to that convention. I don't care about the long lines either, I'd happily wait.  If it were Joe Biden I would only have to wait in line with 3 other people, get free food and 50 bucks for listening to a 5 min incoherent speech.

Currently, FL reg Dems have an unprecedented 470,631 lead over Reps in mail ballot requests, which are good thru the Nov election. Sure, some is shuffling around when/how people vote, but this should give the Biden campaign an advantage in banking votes
Biden with a +13 lead in FL according to    Okay, so that's a üëÄ lead, but not so far out there with TX Biden +1  The terrible Gov. DeSantis polling on the pandemic and his mandates for opening schools likely what's dragging Republicans down

She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
‚ÄúWhen Biden told reporters...he would choose a running mate in the first week of August, two aides told CNN that the timing of an announcement was more likely to be pushed back until the week of August 10. But Biden's advisers gave him a deadline of next week to make up his mind‚Äù

If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now‚Äîyou won‚Äôt get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone‚Äôs ideas before we vote.
We will vote!! Biden 2020.

It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.

If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn‚Äôt win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.

Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll stay on the job after he loses. I think he‚Äôll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
The best reason for third party simps to go vote for Biden this year: you think he'll be strong enough for a second term? Let him be marginally better than Trump for 4 years. Then you primary his then 82 year old ass with a real progressive.
Biden loses with Harris. No brainer.
Then Trump said he is rolling back certain fair housing standards and I decided, even if I have to stand in line, I‚Äôll vote for Biden. (2/2)
Ok, ok. I was pretty adamant that I wasn‚Äôt going to vote for Biden. Then Trump has protesters forcibly removed in DC and I was like, ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll vote for Biden.‚Äù Then Trump sent federal troops to my home town and I was like, ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll vote absentee.‚Äù (1/2)
The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.

I really dislike Biden‚Äôs substanceless campaign. Every corporate Dem should be thanking God that Trump is so incompetent.  What does build back better even mean? You talkin bout our D grade infrastructure? Our stagnant wages? Our student loan crisis? WHAT?!
Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
But my initial read as Biden‚Äôs campaign being cutesy with the VP slot seems inaccurate; it looks like the campaign is dealing with a revolt from loud backers, which has spilled into the press. So I guess we‚Äôre playing our part.
Vote Trump anyway!  Do you honestly believe Biden has any reasoning left?
Biden when this is all over remember who made u the most power man in the world !!!
Exactly. Voters don‚Äôt care. That‚Äôs why flogging the veepstakes is a dead horse spectacle. But it sounds like there is real dissent in the ranks, and it is not Biden waffling. That‚Äôs why we have to be vocal. Sorry for all the tweets. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it‚Äôs not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn‚Äôt want to hear.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"
Looks like it's going to be Kamala Harris more and more. I think Obama and Hillary are pushing for her behind the scenes.

It‚Äôs a deliberate leak (reveal) as a trial balloon. Trying to judge the reaction for having a VP who is a descendant of slave owners and an aggressive prosecutor of minorities using the Crime Bill written by Biden. Joes handlers don‚Äôt do anything with a poll.
A Biden/ Harris ticket is a disaster waiting to happen. Both with anger issues and a history of passing and enforcing laws against minorities. How can you vote for a ticket with a defendant of slave owners on it?
So Jellyfish Joe Biden may have slipped up and it‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs picking a VP who is a descendant of slave owners, one who prosecuted Biden‚Äôs Crime Bill aggressively and jailed thousands of minorities for offenses she herself admits to doing as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris
If I was Joe Biden...(Who I am not) I would not pick Kamala Harris...I‚Äôd pick Barbara Lee from California who voted against Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Invasion or Nina Turner...Since he said woman of color....
Newsmax has commercials all over tv saying text should you would but for Trump(smiling) or Biden(grainy pic). Says ‚Äúmake your voice heard‚Äù. They‚Äôre very right winged supporter of Trump, makes Fox News look centrist. &amp; they get your phone number if you text them!!
Also worth noting that, according to Economist/YouGov polling, the % of Biden voters who think an African American should be selected to be his VP had dropped 12 percentage points in just the last three weeks‚Äîfrom 58% at the end of June to 46% last week.
911? Police?  What does that have to do with Biden and segregation and busing? You're borderline incoherent, and that makes you a waste of time. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to put the real info into this thread (which you couldn't respond logically to.)
Biden loves the cops crushing people as much as anyone. They all love it.
Admittedly unlikely now, but keep coming back to the one possible VP with whom Joe is most simpatico; who checks off the boxes he values.  So, I‚Äôd be remiss not to float my Everlasting Gobstopper theory‚Äîthat Biden‚Äôs heir apparent could be the woman who returned hers‚ÄîAmy Klobuchar
üëè#blacknotDemocrat! I don‚Äôt like Biden..
Brother, I will never judge what side of the political spectrum you fall in line with, but defending that racist dimwit, who clearly can‚Äôt speak a full sentence is laughable. Biden has 40 yrs of complete and utter racist policies and now has lost his mind. This ain‚Äôt about Trump

Joe Biden announces he is pro cop and against the left because he can‚Äôt stand Republicans accusing him of being soft on crime.
You mean it is NOT OKAY to question the illegal activities of BIDEN and his abuse of power?  What is wrong with people in here?  I am GLAD he asked these questions. I don't want that pedo rat Biden in the White House.
Please you‚Äôre the party of corruption led by the likes of Clinton and Biden and their family slush (initiatives) funds.
And it increasingly seems like  only strategy to keep excitement is to prolong the VP announcement, when it‚Äôs plainly been causing more dischord than active speculation. Which makes Biden look weak, indecisive, uncaring about the shit posts his VP noms get continually.
Biden pretending he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt know who his VP choice is already is like Logic pretending he‚Äôs really retiring. Do you understand my exasperation?
I voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and now with everything he‚Äôs done good or bad and after watching Joe Biden answer questions I‚Äôm sure he read a week ago so peoples he is working for can answer for him. I know me and mine will be voting for President Trump! Thank God for him.

Biden giving a speech right now in Wilmington, Delaware. He said, "Crimate clisis." Going to have a very entertaining political campaign (both sides) this cycle.
This is literally the result of a Trump presidency.   If Biden doesn't win and this keeps up, what are the shit for brain Republicans gonna say then?
ignorant response. You‚Äôve missed the point totally. I suppose you also don‚Äôt think there should be an even playing field for African-Americans? Women need an equal playing field in the realm of power. It‚Äôs people like you who are keeping that from happening. Bravo Joe Biden!
I love how GOP reps are crying that there was no congressional oversight over the Obama Biden administration with the doj. What were the 16 investigations of Hillary Clinton and Benghazi with no indictments????? needs to shut up.. he's going down with Trump
AG Barr, when has  asked for the violence and attacks to stop! Instead of saying ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù, he could speak to the protestors. Fcking stupid statement to make of Biden without the same for the POS in Chief!
Lol conservatives are liking and retweeting my last tweet without reading my profile. I also don‚Äôt like Barr either. I wish he would resign. But I think there‚Äôs bigger fish to fry than this hearing like electing Biden.
I hope Biden chooses Elizabeth Warren who will be tough on corporations and the pharmaceutical companies.
So, since there are about 100 days before the election and we have to choose between Biden and Trump, what do you suggest we do??? ü§î
Is this Biden??
Ana,  Wants to stop riots. Biden calls them protests and Adler says those people do not exist.
If one of them points a finger at Obama and Biden, then what?
Anarchists love destrucion , they are our enemies and are frequently supported by the far left communists in the Congress and Senate. The puppet Biden without leadership will lead America  to chaos and division. President Trump is the only one prepared for stop them.

Biden should start every debate with this line.
I feel like most people whenever her name is mentioned gets happy. I know I do. Im voting for Biden anyway but I‚Äôd be happier with Rice on the ticket!
The idea is that Biden gets the "25th," allowing his VP to come in, unelected, as President.  But yeah, very likely wouldn't be a socialist president and would be an establishment candidate.

read your article on secret MAGA. I‚Äôve heard a diff plan that is not about being afraid but deliberately skewering polls to Biden to create false narrative. Heard it from a friend who knows a trumper who is part of the secret plan so to speak.
You said multiple times Democrats are socialists in your tweet feed... heck you have gone as far as calling The NBA: Marxists .. The fact is... You either believe Biden will close the banking system or not. Period..on my side I do Believe Trump will send Feds to hurt civiliansI'm asking rhetorically, is there anything that Kushner does that makes the dems look bad?

The question is not whether we will have an election on November 3rd. It‚Äôs whether or not Trump is able to sow enough chaos to squeak out a win. At best, what he‚Äôs doing now is just him trying to delegitimize Biden‚Äôs victory, not actually delay an election.

Nancy has to go. She‚Äôs just a Senile as Biden.  OPEN THE POLLS!!  well good thing we don‚Äôt need to be in any state of emergency for a 99% survival rate!!
Biden‚Äôs open to ending the filibuster, and he‚Äôs proposed a LOT that I never thoguht he‚Äôd get on board with, so I do think Democrats are set up to do a lot legislatively.  But will we actually END the filibuster? Will we fix all of the institutional problems the GOP has exposed?

I don't know your idea of a real leader. But I'll tell you one thing if Biden were president the whole country would be locked down. We would be living in a police state. Maybe that's your wet dream though LOL.

Michigan Threatens to Slip From Trump as He Goes Quiet on Airwaves
I think Biden should be practical and choose a VP who can help deliver a battleground state. There's an old saying which kind of applies -- "If you want to finish first, you first have to finish."  Most important is that Biden win, and his VP choice should further that.

Mr President, I live in Delray Beach, Fl. Biden has constant commercials on TV. They are very emotional. Mostly about COVID-19 and jobs. Looking for you to show how you are better than Biden.
Biden has no fracking clue
Wow, if Biden could pull that off (I mean by 2:30 tmr) that would be something ...... üòÅ
Biden represents exactly how we got here, and why people flung so far the the other side to put Trump in lol  Trump is a symptom and his failures&amp; successes just point out all the failings and lack of efficiency in the system we were trying to keep from crumbling/taking advantage
If Biden wins, DNC and corporate establishment Dems are even more validated, and use the administration to strengthen the ties that have on democratic/blue party. They are out in position to even further silence progressive voices and coalesce around moderate platforms.
And choosing Biden is snoozing lol or alarm continues to go off and we figure out a way to wake up. Or we could snooze, and wait for a louder and more abrasive alarm to come around
Of course Biden has a lead in South Florida. He‚Äôs been leading in polls in the state for months, and Democrats largely win the state through South Florida.  And national polls mean plenty, especially when the lead is this big. Big national poll leads point to large state leads.
Like, there are other reasons to not pick Kamala Harris, but ‚Äúshe might want to run for president‚Äù seriously isn‚Äôt one of them lol.  Whoever Biden picks SHOULD have the ability and ambition to succeed him, especially if he‚Äôs only a one-term president.
Definitely, and everybody in my house will vote for Joe Biden.

If Joe Biden wins Florida, then he's President. I believe he can win my home state.

I would like to see him somewhere and Biden's cabinet. I think he has a lot to offer and he would be able to hone his craft, in the political Arena at the same time.
suggests banning masks with political messages on it. So maybe Trump &amp; Biden masks will be banned after all.
Me either. I don't want people thinking Biden has it in the bag. I have no doubt that we will have record turnout. I have no doubt that the orange Menace will contested election. And I have no doubt whatsoever, that Florida, Georgia and Kentucky, will steal the election for him.

If you would actually educate yourself on the matter you would know that Biden actually wants to give 300 mill more to the police... so yeah I don‚Äôt think that means defunding. It‚Äôs all on his website
Well, in the 90s, Dems veered to the right in the aftermath of the Clinton era, so that was certainly true for a time. But these days I‚Äôd say that isn‚Äôt really accurate anymore. The party has been drifting leftward for years now, and that‚Äôs evident in recent Biden policies.
On Election Night 2016  couldn't even come out  and accept the results of the election.   What will Biden do?
It‚Äôs a weird answer, but she‚Äôs not exactly wrong. Poll after poll has shown voters are more excited to vote against Trump then for Biden, so ‚ÄúI just want to get rid of Trump‚Äù is fine, if needlessly over complicating what should be a simple answer. I‚Äôd be surprised if she loses.
Biden-Elizabeth Warren is my dream ticket but I think a woman of color is the odds-on favorite by a country mile, and I‚Äôm here for either.

Nadler is lost looks crazy and out of it drinking same stuff as biden
Kerry was a very weak candidate. And we're talking about VP here. Kerry would not have won, swift boat or no Swift boat  The GOP is already planning on the garbage they're going to spew against Harris if she's chosen. And Biden needs a strong Midwest candidate.
I have been a Biden Harris girl since before either of them got in the race. That said, I think the only candidate with an unimpeachable character, is Tammy Duckworth. The GOP will eviscerate Harris. If they tried that with Senator Duckworth, they would be burned alive
Brain-dead Biden will ensure the shooting war portion of the next civil war begins.
And you wonder why Biden won't debate him?
Her son knows that she‚Äôs completely full of shit. That‚Äôs probably the only obstacle that may block her from being Biden‚Äôs running mate.
Sadly you are right on the money...but if Biden wins the anarchy continues but it will be democrats fighting back the extreme left, BLM and ANTIFA to protect THEIR communist states...
And again you keep lying... Biden wants to fund the police more than you do.
How many Americans are tired of the fake news telling our  Joe Biden is winning in the polls from his basement. He refuses  to take interviews. All he does is make a video and tell lies.
And when do they turn into actual, deadly explosives?  People have already been arrested with pipe bombs on them.  Civil war IS upon us. Only one man can stop this.  It's  Biden is not the answer.

Tammy Duckworth is not a white woman. All Biden did was indicate that it would be, a woman. I would love to see Harris in that position, but they will make chopped liver out of her time as an AG. What are they going to say about Duckworth?
Biden should sprint to Fox for interview with Chris

All evidence shows that you can get social justice from the Dems but no economic justice. Both parties have the same donors so no change in wars or Medicare 4all or anything else which will cost their donors  Biden not even restore all the trump tax cuts

Joe Biden Makes Racist Comments While Accusing Trump Of Being Racist

If Biden were to take and pass the test, which I‚Äôm sure he would, I doubt he would brag about it. It‚Äôs funny because Trump thinks it‚Äôs an accomplishment. For him it probably is his biggest accomplishment, so maybe we should say congrats.
You can call the guy a lot of things, and you do, but Trump definitely does not have dementia. Biden's memory and recall are gone.
Why are property taxes being used to pay for a public school education that is just programming a Lectist agenda into our children? Biden will want us to be taxed to pay for free college as well to ensure that everyone has a higher education in that programming.
I live in a pretty mixed area.  About equal Republicans and Democrats.  The adult democrats (people over 35) openly admit that they think Biden is suffering from dementia.  Also this guy and his 'Shooting up bleach' and  letting him get away with it is disgusting.

The republicans can build the wall as long as they don‚Äôt accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
Even more controversial take: I think Biden should promise trump not to prosecute him in exchange for trump leaving peacefully if Biden wins.

But I feel their digital strategy is highly focused on Facebook (reason he‚Äôs leading with seniors). I would also argue Snapchat, Instagram, and tik tok are much better at reaching younger voters (Where the Biden campaign has been engaging in).

The Guardian: Biden holds daunting lead over Trump as US election enters final stretch.   via
Exactly, so far Biden has been really good at reframing the issue by hitting trump with ads comparing him to Maduro and Castro. Why should he blow that with a vp pick who made pro-Castro comments.
Oh-oh.  This is Karl Rove saying the obvious: Joe Biden ‚Äúgot no game‚Äù and the game he has is the lunatic, Leftist socialist agenda. Oh yeah, Biden‚Äôs going down. #Trump2020landslide üá∫üá∏
That one guy happens to be a huge Biden ally so I‚Äôm sure any concerns are getting heard in the Biden campaign, hopefully.
Thanks If You could speed The Word I‚Äôd Be So Greatful To You. It Took Me All Day Dealing With Twitter . They Verified It Was Deactivated By Someone Pther Than Me. I had all Those Independent Voters Ready To Reach Out For Biden. the Deactivated Account Had Almost 4000 in a Month.
I‚Äôm telling u the article is bullshit right now. They are just mad because the Biden campaign wants to put organizers in every single county. When it comes to Florida, don‚Äôt ever trust what ‚Äúlocal‚Äù sources say....
I‚Äôm in Florida and I just can‚Äôt convince myself the polling data is accurate. At best Biden probably has only a 2 point lead.
just speculating here (no crystal ball), he would never go with a shutdown before the election, he would certainly lose in that case. He if loses, he'll do less than he's doing now. Then when Biden's in, he rant how Biden destroyed the economy.
can you beat my friend off after you finish with biden? is there a line for YE handjobs somewhere?
Why should the Biden campaign trust the local party when they have lost race after race?
He‚Äôs going to beat Biden off
I will cancel your vote for trump with my vote for Biden.
Joe Biden is not an idiot! He was a great Vice President and he has more experience than the dotard in the White House.
Another reason to crush Biden &amp; the Left.  (Westonites - release yourself from Leftist shackles, &amp; finally use common sense, or get ready - your hard work, money invested will be redistributed.  Only fair right?+ you can thank DWS - part of the MOB now.)
Once the election results look promising for Biden, trump will begin to doubt himself an he'll go into deep depression and if he doesn't find answers it will probably ruin him. Even if he did cure his narcissism (took me 9 months) there will be too much remorse for him to handle
Idgaf. Just can‚Äôt let trump back in. Anyways when Biden dies or retires we get a better one so ya. U seriously think any of us like Biden üíÄ
Biden ain‚Äôt getting into a tank during a pandemic and even if he did he would cool af with his aviator shades.
Good, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre learning.  (Learning we‚Äôre not going to play that red-herring game.) Instead, we‚Äôre focusing on crushing Biden &amp; the lunatic Left.  We‚Äôll enjoy that more. #Trump2020Landslide üá∫üá∏
I see this nickname going around Twitter: Puppet Biden.
Good thing is I don‚Äôt think Biden is type of politician who will take the bait.
You forgot the Obamas, Clintons, Pelosi and Biden. Do you any mental illness?
In the meantime, another Biden magical moment.  I‚Äôm telling you,  they keep propping him up like ‚ÄúWeekend at Bernie‚Äôs!‚Äù  But really, ... it‚Äôs elder abuse!!!
No they gave 100m to joe Biden and friends thru bpm and actblue
Mr Biden he is an ignorant narcissist who only wants self praise. Can‚Äôt deal with him.  Keep hitting him hard, we are behind you
Joe Biden was anti-busing 4 over 4 decades. He touted accomplishments working with segregationalists. Biden said 'without orderly integration' his children would grow up in a 'racial jungle'. The Media loves REWRITING and FORGETTING History. Trump's a counter-puncher not a racist
Also... no FBI investigation into Biden lol.
I think the Biden campaign capitalizing off all Trumps mistakes is the key. I highly doubt they will let trump debate.
Yes we need all the younger voters to vote for Joe Biden to get Gun control laws changed for our country! Climate change control laws changed for our environment! Equal rights for all Americans! BLM vote üó≥ get Trump out and his Robot Senate our! Get Bills passed Americans first
I‚Äôm absolutely done at this point. U know what, Biden should just pick Duckworth, Whitmer, or Rice and be done with. I want a VP without twitter stans.
No one from team Biden is talking, it‚Äôs fools on twitter getting melodramatic and taking it out on Biden, which at this point is unacceptable ü§¨.
I am logging off of Twitter when the VP is announced. Way too many people are getting into their feelings about this topic, and they are turning it into talking shit about Biden which at this point is fucking unacceptable.
is PMS'ing again ... those of you who know who this is know what I mean.  Use it, my friends. ‚òùÔ∏èü§®  If you believe that a Biden win, a fully blue legislature are disaster for this nation, use it as fuel to GotV, to turn out as never before.   USE. IT.  ~‚úàÔ∏è~

I see Doug Jones getting AG if Biden wins. Biden was the only national Dem allowed to campaign in his Senate race. They are close.
he‚Äôs got a point biden is pretty racist and probablematic. if you look into his past you‚Äôd find that , however he isn‚Äôt worse than trump. he is racist but, he is actually making an effort to pretend to not be racist and heal the country
Biden wouldn't wear that shit. He's not a fascist. Nice try though...
Peaceful protesting, while citizenry are terrorized, trapped, and watch the city get destroyed.  And DemocRat leaders do nothing.  Sounds like a Biden admin in action.  Oh my.
When you think about it, it will much better if President Biden hangs President Obama‚Äôs portrait and we can pretend that the four year Orange Interregnum never happened.
I honestly think Biden has somewhat of a connection.yep biden and trump nobody‚Äôs arguing with you i don‚Äôt support either

Biden Sucks too
OK, it's wrong to call Joe Biden a TOKIN.
HOWEVER, Democrats are forcing Biden to select a female running mate who is black.  That makes her name today and forever on:  TOKEN.  It's a toke to the Liberal Democrats who demanded a black female running mate.
What the hell is wrong with #Catholic (&amp; other) anti-Trumpers?  Do they prefer that believers be forced by law to violate their faith?  If not, then they should thank  who changed the Obama-Biden HHS mandate so employers could offer morally acceptable health plans
But everybody knows that Kamala had sex with Mayor Willie Brown to get a job, and Biden is hoping for the same.  You must HATE Women.
What's not "COOL?" TRUTH?  Biden has been TOLD he has to select a female black running mate by multiple people &amp; organizations. That make her name TOKEN.  Given the fact that Kamala has spread her legs to get jobs in the past (Mayor Willie Brown) &amp; #CreepyJoe is a creep. COOL!
Kamala spread her legs to Mayor Willie Brown to get her first job.  That's probably why she's on Biden's short list.
It's not a shadow campaign against Ms. Token Kamala, it's her own past of having sex with Mayor Willie Brown to get a job, hating on Catholic judges for their values, and sending people to prison for 420 while bragging she was getting stoned.  Kamala/Biden is like Palin/McCain
Kamala spread her legs for Mayor Willie Brown to get her first job, Biden is probably hopeful.
Biden calls to defund police as crime in #Democrat-run cities soars.  Of course.  What else do you expect from a party that withdraws all protection from children in the first nine months of their lives?  Promoting #abortion weakens our ability to protect life at other stages.
I agree.  The ones voting for Biden are the people who are tearing down our #Catholic statues, running #abortion facilities, or working in some Catholic chanceries &amp; Catholic media outlets.
This is the best and most honest Joe Biden commercial ever.

Biden confesses, one of many confessions of New World Order -
Joe Biden has for YEARS supported "The New World Order" AKA (UN Agenda 21), AKA (Globalism); this is a one-class society of socialism controlled by the political and wealthy elite and GHBush signed us up for this with UN Agenda 21. Neo-Liberals support Capitalism, that's not Joe
Karen, is it your Church's job to defend your Church? Do you know that Biden and the Democrats want to re-institute the mandate that would force many believers to violate their faith, and that various dioceses (and we) fought all the way to the Supreme Court? We can't be neutral.
No, Carlos, it is not shame on me. It is shame on Biden, on the entire Democrat party, and on all their supporters, like you.
And speaking of Jesus, Carlos, do you want his followers told by the government that they cannot live their faith without being fined? That‚Äôs Biden. Do you want them to be able to preach and live their faith and pray in school and openly on campus? That‚Äôs Trump.
What‚Äôs the matter, Carlos, do you want socialism? That‚Äôs Biden. Do you want a strong economy for you and your family? The strongest one ever was built by Trump.
Speak the hell up, Carlos.  Do you want the world‚Äôs leading terrorists still alive and well and plotting terrorism against you and your loved ones? That‚Äôs Biden. Do you want them dead? Like they are now? That‚Äôs Trump.
Speak up, Carlos. Do you want open borders so the criminals can come in and attack your community? That‚Äôs Biden. Do you want security at our nation‚Äòs borders in at the same time warmly and safely welcoming immigrants? That‚Äôs Trump.
Do you want to start, Carlos? So let‚Äôs start. How many babies do you want to see dismembered and decapitated? That‚Äôs Biden Or how many babies do you want to see protected? That‚Äôs Trump

I‚Äôve been suspicious of Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP-pick since last year.  My nightmare scenario is Biden steps down after wife declares him unfit to serve, Congress invokes the 25th, Harris becomes President, then she chooses Hillary as her VP.  A fkn nightmare for our republic.
Just like in the House neither the Speaker or the president pro tempore has to actually be a member of Congress. In this situation the senate dems could choose Biden to be the pro tempore on January 3rd and then he would become president on January 21st when trump term ended.
What‚Äôs at stake this Nov is the future of America... as we know it. If Biden is elected, you can kiss everything goodbye üëãüèª
I'm no Biden fan but I don't think this is true. His polling lead is wider.
what else can we do, stay with orange man who is closer to a psychotic break than Kanye? It's so disgusting that's it's come down to this situation of choosing the lesser of both evils but we can surely make Biden the president who also doesn't get reelected.

with all of the actual points you could make against Trump you chose misinformation claiming he denied the virus existed yet it was Biden who called Trump a racist when he banned travel from China early in the Pandemic  but at least you are correct on one account- we won't forget

Bass would be a terrible choice if Biden wants to win Florida. Her condolences after Fidel Castro‚Äôs death will cause a huge backlash from Florida‚Äôs Hispanic community, imperiling his bid to win the state. Not worth the MAJOR RISK she represents in a key swing state.
Joe Biden has been doing the same thing for 47 years and you're expecting change.... You might be a fool
Black Conservative Launches Campaign To "Expose Racist Joe Biden"... DoG
I‚Äôm not exaggerating. I‚Äôd have to put my yard sign away if she was the nominee. Of course I‚Äôd still vote for Biden but saying so openly in my neck of the woods would not be good.
Karen Bass would SERIOUSLY imperil Biden‚Äôs chances of winning Florida. Her condolences after Fidel Castro‚Äôs death would cause a MAJOR backlash among Hispanic voters in the Sunshine State. Absolutely NOT WORTH the MAJOR risk she represents.
Duck Dynasty Star Says Joe Biden is a ‚ÄúHypocrite‚Äù Who Claims to be Christian But Supports Abortion... DoG

Karen Bass would hugely hurt Joe BIden in Florida. Her statement of condolences after Fidel Castro‚Äôs death would cause a gigantic backlash among Hispanics here in Florida. She would be the wrong choice for him if he aspires to win this state. Not worth the MAJOR risk.
I've been hearing Biden ads on Spanish-language radio in Miami for about 2 weeks now. Very encouraging.

Even if she picked as VP election has to happen and she/Biden need to win. Bottom line, if election is delayed and it‚Äôs January 4th, she can go home eat ice cream.
Here are five reasons why the Democrats and Joe Biden should be deeply concerned about Black Voter turnout this coming November.

I was talking Biden. But I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs terribly happy with Trump either. Collapsed his bonds market. Had real issues with his economy due to denial of dollars.
After 47 years in Washington you think Biden now knows how to fix America.  Yes you are a fool. He's been problem.
‚ÄúWhen Biden told reporters...he would choose a running mate in the first week of August, two aides told CNN that the timing of an announcement was more likely to be pushed back until the week of August 10. But Biden's advisers gave him a deadline of next week to make up his mind‚Äù
I've been telling people for months that I intend to write in Bernie, part because he got robbed and to piss off anyone bothered by that. I can be reasonable, but Biden has done absolutely nothing to earn my vote I don't care how bad orange man is
Education :)
Looks like Curbelo won by a little less than 12 in 2016. I get the point, and it‚Äôs not safe D. That said, it went D in 2018 despite lower margins on top ticket races. If Biden wins by 18-20, will ticket splitting save CG?
It sounds good for Biden so I believe this one
Black people have been getting used politically for years by Dems to our detriment. That continues this election year. Democracts have put up the worse candidate for issues of impact to Black people. If you don‚Äôt believe me look at Joe Biden‚Äôs draconian record on black issues.

Joe Biden is apparently up 10% points in Florida... a state where he has zero visible support... meanwhile everywhere you go there are Trump flags, signs, and bumper stickers.  Ok.
if you don‚Äôt address these two issues you won‚Äôt win the election 1. How to pay your rent/mortgage specially if you loose your work to COVID19 2. Food on the table anything else will end backfiring and Biden doesn‚Äôt even need to speak
Biden and Trump aren‚Äôt the only two people running for office. There are other candidates with great ideas and motivation to help this country
. organized &amp; participated in Communist brigades that brutally assisted the Castro regime in repressing dissidents corralled in #Cuba's forced labor camps.  Joe Biden's VP pick is a brutal Communist who enjoyed repressing the Cuban people!

Good one and true! Strawman Biden is owned by Xi
Wait until Biden steps down, she becomes President AND then she selects Hillary Clinton as her VP.  Will be a freaking nightmare.
Biden seems pretty committed to having a woman of color as his VP. It would be great if he chose Warren, but I'm not optimistic.
The edited video ads of a ‚Äúsenile‚Äù Joe Biden are hilariousü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£   your cult leader Trump has the communication skills of a preschooler not to mention he‚Äôs a liar and a cheat. He will go down as the most corrupt president of our times
Not as many times as Joe Biden has bent his knee to them... that is for sure...
Joe Biden believed in segregation btw
I have absolutely zero doubts Trump will be re-elected and we'll retake the House on his coattails. 2/3rds of Biden voters don't even like Biden, they just hate Trump. We saw how THAT worked out for Romney in 2012.
So don‚Äôt go guilting people for not voting because the system is broken and it‚Äôs absolutely idiotic to think people should vote for the lesser of two evils and see that as ‚Äúprogress.‚Äù The only reason why Biden isn‚Äôt seen as negative as Trump is because his mind is so fried
What is it that Biden provides that Trump doesn‚Äôt? Both are against UBI Healthcare for all, ending foreign occupation, Free education, etc. there isn‚Äôt a single policy that Biden supports that I‚Äôm in favor for. Tired of neoliberals thinking people have to settle.
The guy who supported Pete Buttigieg and now supports Biden says Elon Musk is ‚Äúbad at politics‚Äù lmao.
Guilting people using a mans death into voting for someone who isn‚Äôt any different than Trump ideologically speaking is disgusting. Name one thing that Biden is against that Trump isn‚Äôt either. It‚Äôs pointless to vote and to settle on candidates that are simply corrupt bureaucrats

Never has a President been so loved by at least 150,000,000 people Dems can‚Äôt win with brain dead biden
Can somebody tell me if its true that George W Bush is trying to turn Texas blue and that he is voting Biden
Also, being that a lot of trump followers disregard the virus/doesn‚Äôt care about masks, I feel like they would have the advantage going to the polls... unless the numbers are right and Biden is in the lead, then it would make more sense for trump to all of a sudden care.
It is true that between Biden and the orange clown the obvious choice is Biden no argument there, but failing to see that Joe Biden is not 100% there...and he cannot even say a coherent thought or phrase really is mind boggling!!
3) And the more energized base.  Cancellation isn't compelling. It's repulsive.  And Biden's base consists of nothing more than the old guard of party bosses, the donor class and old media. In short, Hillary's base. How well did that work out?
1) Isn't funny? The very same pundits, corporate media outlets and their pollsters - none of whom saw the Trump phenomenon triumphing - are claiming Biden has it in the bag.  They apparently never got the memo about the 2016 election: politics isn't like money ball.
At least Biden has a brain and empathy and he cares about the country. He doesn‚Äôt want to politically divide the country , or be racist like you, or to promotpeople to get sick and not wear masks and promoting fraud in all your 20,000 lies. You are owned by Putin!  You will lose!
He will! Biden 2020

I think it's great that folks from outside of this country would vote for him. If eligible, Trump could run and win the presidency both here in the US and in Russia. Bet Biden can't say the same.

Ok. I believe Trump mishandled it early on just like most of the world but when he did ban flights from China and later Europe he was called a xenophobe by Biden.... calling him a racist for trying to shut down incoming flights. A lot more should have been done... no doubt...
Biden must win.
this is so pathetic to answer presubmitted questions by pre approved reporters. This is what North Korea and communist China do.  Biden is so feeble he cannot do a real press event with real questions without a teleprompter.  I'm embarrassed for you.
Ok... Biden believes whatever they tell him to believe. Gun sales are going through the roof. There are almost as many democrats buying them as republicans. I hate the two party system. I feel they are holding us hostage. Nobody feels safe right now.
... I‚Äôve been supporting Biden since bernie endorsed him, glad you eventually came around, but it‚Äôs a little ridiculous that it took trump going full gestapo for KYLE to even consider voting for him...
What is the Democrats plan by insinuating Trump will not leave office ifdefeated?  Multiple lawsuits when Biden loses?  They will be still contesting 2016 and the 2020 elections forever?
....so he hasn‚Äôt always been in favor of Biden... imo it‚Äôs pretty sad that it took trump to openly show people like Kyle that he‚Äôs a fascist, it took fucking lay after park to change him mind smh

If you tell republicans Covid is a hoax, they will believe you, no evidence. If you tell republicans Biden wants to defund the police, they will believe you, again, no evidence. Independent thinking is not a strong republican trait and they are often exploited as a result.

Trump only started to care about the coronavirus in the last 2 weeks bc it's spreading in states he views as important to his reelection. And trump has built his entire persona on racial fears of white America. Like yeah Biden has issues, but if you think some bad bills=trump

I like Tucker but dont watch fox much anymore. At&amp;t TV has OAN. Much better than Fox. I do watch Chris Wallace. I dont however think Biden could make it through one of his interviews. I would like to see it.

And why is the Ukraine seeking criminal charges against Biden?

I voted for  in #Florida. Even though she'd dropped out before our primary (which is a ludicrous part of our current system btw). I think Biden is one of the worst candidates out of the final 8-10 in the race. But I'll still vote for him over a blatantly despicable Trump!

Unfortunately, that is EXACTLY why some people are going to vote for    They WANT this level of anarchy and know a Biden Administration is helpless to stop them. His election will be consent to continue to take the country apart.   My best, Sir.

If you‚Äôre one of the people on this threading seeking to defend this comment by Joe Biden, you‚Äôre probably as dim as he is. And that‚Äôs saying quite a bit. It‚Äôs condescending and insulting to American voters, all while kissing the CCP‚Äôs ass by parroting their talking points.
No, I am not easily fooled.  Do you believe everything you see on the internet? I believe in freedom and the only candidate that is for freedom in Trump.  Biden is for taking freedoms away. When you are free, you can achieve anything you desire.In case you wonder why Biden leads in the MSM polls, the answer is easy, you cannot steal an election when polls consistently have you down double digits. I have never seen a balanced poll of registered dems, indys, and repubs where Trump wasn‚Äôt ahead by at least 30 points.
IF YOU WANT A CROOKED LIAR IN THE WHITE HOUSE VOTE FOR BIDEN !!!

Yes, of course. Biden and Democrats all down the ballot.
You mean like Biden is now?
Consider this, if the Lord wills it that Joe Biden becomes the next president and how that will affect the church.   Prepare now.
Despite Trump's goading, Biden steers clear of 'law and order' debate: THATS BS--HE SPOKE FOR DEFUNDING THE POLICE. BIDEN IS A COMPLETE JERK THAT SHOULD NOT BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. HE WILL NOT SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE VIOLENCE GOING ON. HE IS A RACIST-HE SPOKE OUT AGAINST BUSING
Joe Biden is talking, but he‚Äôs out of it. Rambling and eyes not focused?
I wouldn't vote for Biden if I found out he was a sexual preditor who separated children from their parents and locked them up and he planned on building a private army to attack peaceful protesters.
You need to help this go viral! The Obama and Biden administrative plan called AFFH will be implemented totally if Biden wins the election it becomes federal rule over local and state laws. Look it up. It‚Äôs destroys the subberbs ( single home zoning), police &amp; local Gov. control!
Joe puts bidet in Biden.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I remember when President-Elect Clinton convened an economic conference in Dec 1992 prior to his inauguration so that his administration could better tackle the recession on Day 1. Biden will have so much on his plate Jan 2021, he needs nominees and policies ready in Nov 2020.
WHAT WOULD CROOKED JOE BIDEN DO IF IN OFFICE ? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING-THATS WHAT HIM AND OBAMA DID FOR 8 YEARS. AND THATS WHAT BIDEN WOULD DO IF ELECTED. HOW COULD HE ? HE CANNOT REMEMBER ANYTHING. HE IS NOT THE PERSON TO BE ELECTED. REMEMBER---HE LIES BIG TIME !!
He wants this country to be communist. His agenda has always been Marxist and now he and Biden have the corrupt democrats to support it because all they ever want is power over the people. Biden won‚Äôt be running this country. The evil Soros and Obama marxists will be in charge!This is funny. yet not very effective. Good try . i do not feel like voting Biden at all? Maybe Biden should actually speak? Run all the ads you want he still has to get on a debate stage

Because in April he attacked Biden for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election and well, Trump just suggested to delay the election. Haha
Then Trump will forfeit the election by not taking the field which will award Biden the presidency by default. Trump will have to be removed by force.

The left only supports Biden so Trump won't win so a black woman can become president. Biden is too empty minded to realize his "friends" aren't really by his side for the long run. As well, him choosing a black woman as president, due to the reasoning, is sexist and racist.
You know if Biden wins, 200 days from now he won't be president anymore. The liberals know he will be a bad president. They are going to try to impeach him as soon as they can because he is not fit for the position just so a black woman can be president.
I hope Biden tears it down in his first month as President

Obama and Joe Biden hardly did not do anything for this country they were a disgrace. Speaking of Joe Budden I don't think he's fit to run for president he doesn't know where he's at half the time the Democrats are now a laughing joke. Biden should be tested to see if he's fit
Does the 22nd Amendment allow Obama to run as Biden's vice president?
I mean, it will definitely be Trump‚Äôs broken America that Joe Biden is going to inherit.Man, Democrats are a tough crowd. Biden always said he was announcing his VP choice sometime in early August. It's July 31st and he's getting dragged.

Not a single Bernie supporter could ever stomach Donald Trump, and Joe Biden is about as centrist as it gets.  Apparently saying someone is a leftist is all the fear mongering conservatives need to shit the bed.
Think about this.  Biden is ahead by close to ten points nationally and leading in every swing state and he hasn't announced his VP candidate yet.  Look for a bounce this week.  Now the campaign needs to concentrate on getting out the vote.
Never happen Mr Biden
Anyone Joe Biden picks to be his Vice President will be a million times better than Mike Pence. Let‚Äôs all keep that in mind.
Barr Durham really messed this up.  So many should have been indicated with what we know already. Now we endanger the Republic by allowing absolute criminals or treasonists to be on a ticket for a national party.   dug up the goods on Joe Biden. Barr won't go there
I'm asking rhetorically, is there anything that Kushner does that makes the dems look bad? Rather, every time he opens his mouth the results lead to more voters who support Biden. The best thing Jared can do for Trump is keep his mouth shut.

Joe Biden didn't create his job. The people of Delaware kept employing him, then an overwhelming number of Americans sent him and his boss to DC twice. We're about to hire him again. Trump found jobs for his daughter, son in law, daughter in law, Rudy's son, Barr's daughter, etc.

idea of a solution. I don't need to trash Trump to make my point. But whatever Trump sees when he looks in the mirror, and what Trump claims to see when he looks at Joe Biden are so far away from the reality.
It is amazing how little self-awareness Trump has that he would call Biden a "buffoon". Biden is self-effacing, humble, humorous, riant, generous, spirited, fit, loving, a goofy grandpop, a kind (if not overly permissive) father, a supportive &amp; proud husband. His friendships are

It is my observation that Biden supports China fully, Why? They do not Want a strong President like Trump, so they are Financing Sleepy Joe &amp; the Dems fully against Trump, so they can continue to abuse our USA and the world. #MAGA2020! They are in for a big surprise!

Exactly. Any vote for Biden is a ‚Äúfraudulent vote‚Äù. I‚Äôm happy to be a fraudulent voter in that case.
As I said, Biden's quote was "poor people are just a smart as white people"  You cant get more racist than that, or maybe you can, the Biden Quote, "You have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-11"

Kamala Harris is very ambitious. People who run for president usually are - Joe Biden 2020 notwithstanding. (He‚Äôs trying to rescue America.) That in and of itself should not be disqualifying. What are they really concerned about?
That would be Obama and Biden.......
Still didn‚Äôt answer! Of course for Biden lol joke
Of course Biden has a lead in South Florida. He‚Äôs been leading in polls in the state for months, and Democrats largely win the state through South Florida.  And national polls mean plenty, especially when the lead is this big. Big national poll leads point to large state leads.

? Trump will never leave office, period. Biden will win but trump and his lackey Barr, will not obey the will of the people. So, looks like Trump will not leave whether Lincoln Merch is sold or not. Ridiculous theory.
Like, there are other reasons to not pick Kamala Harris, but ‚Äúshe might want to run for president‚Äù seriously isn‚Äôt one of them lol.  Whoever Biden picks SHOULD have the ability and ambition to succeed him, especially if he‚Äôs only a one-term president.

Respectfully, you‚Äôre barking up the wrong tree. There is no objective metric that would have trump being a better fit for the country than Biden. Did you know that On average, Democratic presidents grew the economy 4.4% each year versus 2.5% for Republicans since Truman?
Are we talking about the same Joe Biden who passed bills and yelled on the senate floor (about black people) "LOCK EM UP" That Joe Biden?
So,  basically,  Biden will lie or conceal his true intentions in order to get elected? D--n,  this politics business is hard work!
Essential that if Biden is told to add Harris or Warren as VP that Republicans pound home that Biden has already told us he won't do a whole term and the VP will essentially be President.  Could be in the first year.

Respectfully, the Democrats dont plan on giving him anything. He will be like a hamster in a cage running on a wheel.  They are/will control EVERYTHING he does.  A vote for Biden is a vote for a group of left interest groups pulling the strings.
It will be essential for Republicans to refer whomever pathetic Joe Biden is told to take on board as "Ms. President."  Let people know every minute of every day that he will NOT be President, but she will within a year when he resigns for health reasons.

It‚Äôs a weird answer, but she‚Äôs not exactly wrong. Poll after poll has shown voters are more excited to vote against Trump then for Biden, so ‚ÄúI just want to get rid of Trump‚Äù is fine, if needlessly over complicating what should be a simple answer. I‚Äôd be surprised if she loses.
What a crock with the blaming Kor Biden and saying he will defund the police. scare tactics.  In Georgia watching horrible political ads by #trump and the disgusting radical right extremist  #kellyloeffler, troll extraordinaire: DONT do it Georgia! Don‚Äôt vote in evil

It boggles my mind how stupid you are. Biden‚Äôs been in office for 50 years, name some of his accomplishments? I‚Äôll wait?. My god you‚Äôre stupid.
I‚Äôll match you with Florida‚Äôs 29 that will be going to Biden...
What is Biden going to do for you? He‚Äôs been in office for 50 years and  has accomplished nothing. Was VP on the most corrupt administration ever.

Great!  is going to have Stacey Abraham‚Äôs on #reidout so they can pressure Biden into tapping SA as VP. Keep it up  Paint Biden bad if his pick isn‚Äôt Black. Because color is critical to qualifications, right?!?  is better VP pick but must be next AG
We will all remember and vote for our favorite president, Joe Biden, and for Democrats to end the Republican coup and the end of the disaster knows as the Cowardly Liar Dotard Trump the racist, cheater, thief and fool.
Knock knock... who‚Äôs there? Joe Biden. Joe Biden who? Joe Biden your time until President Trump wins HUGE in Nov!
And all of you "Justice is coming "Soon" people" understand that a President Biden would stop EVERY investigation currently underway on day one, right?  Durham and his "hammer" will be riding the train home with a smug face...
You were voting for Biden before. You were never voting for Trump.  What he's saying is there are people in the middle who were going to vote for Biden who may switch to Trump because of the insanity we are all witnessing.
I didn‚Äôt consider us opponents because a) I feel sorry about how misguided you are b ) nationalism and neo-conservatism aren‚Äôt  mutually exclusive c) Trump, the leader of your movement, is going to set you back due to his clear and present failures d) I‚Äôm voting Biden anyway

so much for the 99% good people that  keeps talking about.  And why Trump keeps Christopher Wray is beyond my comprehension. Maybe we deserve what is coming since our leadership is clueless. Barr- slow AF.  Haspel - DS, Wray - DiSaster.  Not much worse with Biden.

The Supreme Court's ruling gives Joe Biden the green light if he wins to enact whatever policy he wants and pay for it by taking the funds from the Department of Defense, which I'm sure the conservative Justices will treat the exact same way they've done here
You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads
Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn‚Äôt need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.
Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary
Biden has a great pick to chose from Kamala is Definitely one of them. Love all his picks. I chose Kamala before she even ran in the race.
Horrible company. 42 years of service and you treat me like this. Asking  to investigate your discriminatory practices shame you.

Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
Scary scenario... how fragile our democracy really is! A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty  #TraitorTrump

Well, then we don‚Äôt need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is
Under Obama and Biden from October 2010 to October¬†2016, the¬†unemployment¬†rate fell from 10% to less than 5%. Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4.7%

That's not reality, it's a talking point. In reality, it's not about Trump. It's about the pervasive corruption in our establishment. Biden is the embodiment of everything wrong in our political system.
Are these the same polls that say Biden winning big? Yet polls are biased and wrong? Guess I should only trust polls you post?
Nina Turner clearly doesn‚Äôt want Biden elected. At this point she supports delaying the election because she basically supports trump.

So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
It democRATS got a candidate like Joe Biden, it is because they don't need a competitive contender to win the elections.  We must be prepared for a massive fraud. We must be prepared to defend our Country from the dirty mob.

Ngl, little annoyed at this Biden ad
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
Would you be saying this if the owner was a Biden supporter?  NO
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.

Don't blame yourself Steve. How could you have possibly known how right Biden was back in April because up to that point Trump had been so respectful of the Constitution and especially the integrity of elections. Try not to be too hard on yourself.
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020
My person dislike has to do with her trying to smear Biden. None of the other women on the list tried to do that.
I guess we‚Äôll  finally hear whatever crap Giuliani has been able to extort out of foreign governments about Obama or Biden or both. Unlikely any of it will be vetted or confirmable. Democrats and independents beware it‚Äôs aimed at you.
No Biden all the way
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden‚Äôs pick. It‚Äôs time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
And we thought the last election was the most important. The ante went up folks.  Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins

i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
Vice President Joe Biden, please tell President Barack Obama to return Abigail to Pollyanna.  THE WORLD IS WATCHING!!!  Pollyanna üá∫üá≤ üèõ üá∫üá≤
That woman is tough as nails! She's going to hang in there til Biden wins, no matter what! She deserves flowers every week.
#Trump2020 #MAGA2020Landslide  Btw I hear Joe Biden wears a diaper
Biden has the same chances of winning as the Patriots of winning next Superbowl!
If Biden wins this election, this will be the third time in a row an elected Democratic President will have to clean up a huge economic disaster left by his Republican predecessor.
I‚Äôm a Neoliberal and Biden supporter. So no?
Can‚Äôt wait for Biden to get in there and executive order everything you did right back into existence. Are ya ready for it!!!!
This is correct...there were plenty of Obama stuff even more Trump stuff a little Hillary and nothing for Biden
IJS I‚Äôm in a  Democratic county  and I haven‚Äôt seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker yet..
Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn‚Äôt, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it‚Äôs overkill  saying all that Biden‚Äôs gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
Who would you want Biden to pick as VP?   I still have no idea who I want
During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump‚Äôs plan?
You realize you‚Äôre behind double digits in the polls? And Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt done or said a thing.
Biden wins Penn,Wis,in addition to Michigan &amp; he is over 270!!!!Besides AZ,FL,NC,GA,TX,etc,etc,etc...
But in a way that‚Äôs better for Biden. We know Kamala and her record, so no surprises. A lower name pick could lead to a surprise in the middle campaign that could hurt Biden.
His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it‚Äôs way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!
She‚Äôs senile along with Biden
As a Dem, you can‚Äôt be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
I didn‚Äôt then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Ya know what America needs to unify it? A dementia ridden white guy and a cop
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That‚Äôs the real question
Ummmm he walked. ... he ain‚Äôt running anywhere... except for President... and that race he‚Äôll win... Biden is aloof
He just hates Biden; that‚Äôs all.
I agree? But that‚Äôs not the topic here. It‚Äôs voting for Biden.  I‚Äôm not going back and forth on this.
That‚Äôs not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn‚Äôt VP.  That‚Äôs what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can‚Äôt even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I‚Äôve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We‚Äôve got nothing to discuss.
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
I'm sure of it. Now if Kamala Harris is AG for Biden, she will kick ass. AG's have more power that VP's.
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!
Hunter Biden looks 1000 times better, murderer
Where are all their masks.??Joe Biden thinks he is running for the senate and he was never a quality human. Explain how someone in a government job for 50 years becomes wealthy. He embarrasses the country every time he speaks.
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president   Condolence Rice ia the most experienced, qualified, black (no offensive but a truth) woman and idoneous VP
Kamala Harris selected as VP, will be the worse choice, that Biden could do, it would signal that those whom doubt his mind clear condition, are right and correctly doubt his qualification.  The most idoneous ticket reflecting smart and sound selection, would be Condolence Rice.

Locking Down Americans is Freedom.

Your moral outrage is misplaced if that's the case. You are part of the problem.
1 day poll, please answer and Retweet. Thanks! I think Biden needs to select a running mate thru the lens of a 2nd President, rather than vp. Of these 4 black women, who would you choose!  #Biden2020
No worries. Let his cult stay home and not vote. Nothing will stop us from voting for Joe Biden
I remember Roger, and I thank you for your service friend! We need to get you an honorable commander in chief! I'm with Biden.
Amen - We have to be Relentless -  Because He‚Äôs the one who‚Äôll try to steal this election. What he accuses Biden and Dems of - He‚Äôs trying to do. Rubber &amp; Glue!
That's why democrats want mail in ballots,  because it's the only way Bumbling Biden would win!
That‚Äôd be a nice change of pace, no? A president should attend to matters of state while his social media team utilizes this platform to educate and interact, not as the tip of the legislative sword nor as a distraction! By golly, we agree! Let Biden‚Äôs handlers use Twitter!
We can only hope when Biden‚Äôs in we can get some traction on this! It‚Äôs bad enough how many perpetrators of #SexCrimes #Rape either get off completely or get super light sentences. The Judiciary doesn‚Äôt protect women&amp;children with the current system in place.
Idk if they will ever pay, due to the fact that Biden who has to work his way through the swamp. May have to stand down to get something else that he wants.
He‚Äôs a member of the current party in power. We‚Äôre going to have to wait until Biden gets in. The
Sorry, I have no respect for someone who hides behind their veteran status while voting for a socialist takeover of America. Regardless of how you ‚Äúfeel‚Äù about the President he stands between us and the radical left... and that would include Biden!
Conservatives, you DON‚ÄôT have to support Biden to stand up against Trump.  is a clear and present danger to the US.

Everyone I know even the hard core dems are voting for our president Trump,  in the real world every normal self thinking voter can see that Biden had many years to get things done but he did nothing to help this country
His body makes Biden look like LeBron!

Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Joe Biden Will not Defunct the ompolice.
You have lost all of your brain cells. Wake up and see what Biden will do to you! Higher taxes, control your every move and take you very close to communism. I'm glad you're happy with that. I'm not. Screw Biden
So the sick Democrats can try to ruin the economy and scare us into not voting in person and they are hoping that we blame Trump and vote for Biden. Mail in votes all over equal voter fraud. Trump has to win or we are screwed
Obama and Biden are getting together with Visions And plans.  Where were their visions and plans from 2008 - 2016? They had none and they did nothing but Divide this country.  And they want to continue to divide this Nation and it‚Äôs citizens.  We‚Äôve had enough of those two!!!
Really,  your'e calling Trump a laughing stock. You do know Biden has early stages of dementia. Its actually sad to watch him try n talk. You should be laughing at yourself for even thinking of voting for him.
Our children need a President that will prioritize their safety and education, especially now in a #pandemic ...  Joe Biden has already developed that comprehensive plan..to schools reopening... safely!  #ImVoting4BidenBecause  #ChildSafety  #teacher  #EssentialWorkers
And we need to vote - IN PERSON - here like Biden‚Äôs twenty points behind!
Biden has publicly called you a rascist, and the beat goes on, Democrat racial gaslighting, Anti Police ,  election year agenda is in full swing as in the 2016. Democrats have the blood of dead children because of their agenda.
Juan Williams from Fox News Channel needs to quit and go to MSNBC or CNN. He‚Äôs completely out of touch with reality, a left wing nut bag, He says President Trump is a racist, but Biden is not,ü§® he needs to research Biden and his past, I watch Juan W. Daily he‚Äôs worse than ever
You forgot coherent, that eliminates Biden
Funny how Dem run cities are allowing this but it's Trumps fault....as is Biden would be the one in control, what a laughtrump is so bored when he attacks biden. he doesnt have nearly the energy he did when going after hillary.
seeing people talk about these people like a magic reset button's going to be hit if biden wins while over 150,000 people are dead will do that.
guys theyre going to hit biden on boat parades. game. changed.
per trump  Bernie: "Joe! For the love of God, I beg of you, please offer some sensible, moderate positions"  Biden: "Shaddap you neolib shill! God love ya, we're going full communist, folks. I'm talking red revolution ladies and gentlemen."
whoever had "actually biden is to bernie's left" on your trump 2020 bs bingo card, feel free to punch your ticket today
trump at a white house event is claiming biden is way to bernie's left. just insane, losing rambling.
Obama took Biden aside. He looked him directly in the eyes.  "Joe, I'd like to talk to you about the Black Nationalist Marxist Initiative..."  *Avengers music swells*
can someone out there get me some photoshops of biden wearing a dashiki or on m'baku's throne from black panther, were really gonna do this?
Do people who vote Libertarian take votes away from Trump or Biden?
You already do. Bernie has influenced Biden‚Äôs platform, he talks to Elizabeth Warren weekly.
Remember . . . what would Dems have done different . . . keep in mind Biden and other Dems called the China travel bans xenophobic. And . . . our economy was record strong BEFORE the virus using policies Dems voted against.
if biden wins he should commit to conducting the census for real, to overcome all the bs trump threw up and the virus. no reason we can't do a real census in 2022. the count is vital to our future.
"joe biden actually secretly defunded the police" is not an attack anybody but the dumbest trump zombies will buy. but sure, go with that.

Joe Biden Can't Walk Straight or Remember Where He Isüòµ  via
I am a trumper - but no to delaying the election. That will make me vote Biden.
Your right, the economy would NEVER have contracted under a Hillary shutdown, NO ONE would have lost their jobs if Democrat led this pandemic. Ignore 3 years of success. Heck even Biden called the China travel ban xenophobic, clearly we'd be better off . . .
That's actual footage, cupcake.  Biden likely has Alzheimer's, and it's getting worse.
Biden never undermined democracy and became an authoritarian. He help fixed the economy the last time republicans tanked it and we will do it again
Biden would never let this happen. Go Joe in 2020!
Brilliant move by Trump though. We know mail in voting will have issues, if Trump wins, and Dems cry foul, he says I told you so. If he loses, it will be a stain on Biden's election as we continue to find uncounted ballots through 2022.
For God‚Äôs sake, Biden &amp; Bolshevik Bernie are on VIDEO admitting they wouldn‚Äôt have done anything to stop Covid regardless and we wouldn‚Äôt have even known about it. Only reason we even know of it and doing anything is because ‚ÄúTrump is POTUS and we must play games regardless.‚Äù
Voting for Biden and helping get the monster out of the WH is in no way a wasted vote
All these things can be true at the same time: - Trump is morally unfit for office. - Biden is morally unfit for office. - Trump has helped millions of Americans. - Trump has ignored the plight of millions of human beings. - The only good thing about Biden is that he isn't Trump.
upset that Biden backers can't vote Absent Minded...
I am so sick of Trump's  attack ads on Biden. Biden doesnt attack Trump. Hes an honest person and I hope he will be our next President!
re herman cain's death  the trump people - including his son - keep attacking biden for not having traditional campaign events.   joe biden's campaign events never killed anyone. trump's rally did.
Yes, we rather protest with Biden in the WH.
yes the economy tanked, thousands are dead, and trump is getting his butt kicked in polling  but JOE BIDEN HAS NEVER HAD A BOAT PARADE.
i hope theres somebody dedicated to yelling at joe biden 24-7-365 to ignore the deficit bs from the gop.

Biden calls the demon seed woman a "disgrace" and calls out Trump for pushing her nonsense.
if they open up Biden will have to debate Trump live on stage. This lockdown is of course going thru the election.

Biden doesn‚Äôt have a campaign or a voice, he‚Äôs an empty suit unable to take ?s. He‚Äôs weak.
Never thought he would win the first time. So yes. If he gets a live debate yes. If they keep Biden in the basement then... if that happens the media will be an accomplice to a coup.

Yes. If Biden is elected the corruption will be normal and applauded.
BOA donates $1B too ok BLM/Biden.  What are they funding between now and November 3rd?  Putting more ANTIFA on payroll to wreak havoc.  This will be investigated.

First thing when Biden is President kick Barr out and all Trumps appointees
trump says "sperm dna" crackpot is an "important voice." but one time joe biden said state when he should have said city, so both sides.

I believe your purpose in these posts is to dissuade Conservatives from voting for Trump. You have no other purpose other than to disparage Trump  and sow dissent in conservative circles in order to convince some not to vote. To not vote is a vote for Biden. Good try though

I hope Biden wins, but if he loses to Trump  (b/c he was always a huge gamble), you‚Äôll see the media start mentioning that maybe the candidate who supported the most popular policies in history among all voters (including Independents), aka Bernard Sanders, was the better choice.

I'm thinking it's not just Biden people. We HAVE to get Trump out IMMEDIATELY. Voting for Joe is our only option at this point and THEN let's try and make real changes on the independent front. Trump is just too dangerous to allow anymore time.

Exactly. Now there's no chance of their being a live Trump vs Biden debate which is exactly what the DNC and China wanted when they started all of this.

theres no actual point to this briefing other than trump is losing to biden
damn it.
just realized biden is an eagles fan. this is a problem. #canceled
Biden wasn't fooled. Maybe because he doesn't trust Xi. "We found that Biden did warn about a potential pandemic as long ago as January, and talked about some steps the administration should take. A fuller, detailed plan came weeks later."
I feel like we should start taking bets on who he blames today.  Biden, Obama, China, Fox all seem good guesses but I'm going to take a shot in the dark and say today he goes to a new low and blames the people who have died. If they didn't die there wouldn't be so many deaths.If u think Biden is going to defund the police, take ur guns &amp; raise your taxes, u‚Äôve done 0 research &amp; a sucker to media trump wanted u to believe. It‚Äôs ok if u fell for it, it was designed to be convincing. But you still have time to learn more! Our future depends on it.
Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn‚Äôt need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.
Biden has a great pick to chose from Kamala is Definitely one of them. Love all his picks. I chose Kamala before she even ran in the race.

Typical lying GOP. Obvi, Obama and Biden were handed The great recession from Bush. They took unemployment from 10.5 to 4.6. Trumps claim to fame is giving his buddies $1.3 trillion which they put in the market,  which made the market go up. Big deal. Americans know you‚Äôre a liar

Great. Let‚Äôs bring up that shameful episode again and again, add to the narrative that Biden is a sexist dirty old man, and watch the GOP pounce on that‚Äîjust until the Traitor and Biden are tied in swing states. Then we wring our hands, having given the GOP its August surprise.
The ‚Äúbad taste‚Äù is being manufactured by pundits making assumptions about what Joe Biden thinks. What ‚Äúthose around him think‚Äù about Kamala Harris should not be used to tarnish Biden himself. You‚Äôre doing the GOP‚Äôs dirty work for them, again.

It‚Äôs also notable that this means the first female Vice-President - and quite plausibly the first female President some day - will more likely than not be a black woman.   Biden‚Äôs VP would start off as the favorite to win the nomination to succeed him in the next open primary.
It‚Äôs notable that 4 of Biden‚Äôs finalists on his shortlist for VP are black women - Susan Rice, Kamala Harris, Val Demings &amp; Karen Bass.   Black women voters are a big reason he won the nomination. They came out for him strong in South Carolina.

AG Barr, when has  asked for the violence and attacks to stop! Instead of saying ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù, he could speak to the protestors. Fcking stupid statement to make of Biden without the same for the POS in Chief!
Lol conservatives are liking and retweeting my last tweet without reading my profile. I also don‚Äôt like Barr either. I wish he would resign. But I think there‚Äôs bigger fish to fry than this hearing like electing Biden.
I hope Biden chooses Elizabeth Warren who will be tough on corporations and the pharmaceutical companies.
People vote for who they think will do the best for the job. An employer hires likewise, the candidate with the best credentials. Trump has proven his. What has Biden proved. Predator, liar, actual quid pro quo actor, dementia, womanizer and coward.
‚ÄúThis is what America would look like under Biden‚Äù they say, playing footage of America under Trump.
So, since there are about 100 days before the election and we have to choose between Biden and Trump, what do you suggest we do??? ü§î
Barr is on Capitol Hill. I'm surprised he showed. He's there to lie and disrespect Congress.   President Biden's (üôèüôèüôè) AG can bring charges.  House subpoenas will mean something.
If Biden wins (üôèüôèüôè) it will be 1st female VP.
I will be surprised if Barr shows up.   If he does he will be disrespectful and dishonest.   President Biden's AG can get Barr for Lying to Congress if that's the case.
Can‚Äôt wait for trump to blame Obama and Biden for this one

Having read the gossip pieces on her campaign‚Äôs internal dysfunction (which I always take with a grain of salt), Biden‚Äôs team seems to think she‚Äôs be a constant source of drama in the White House, putting her 2024 ambitions first. She also has little clout on the Hill.
A Trumpless Future Is Hard to Get Your Head Around
Biden‚Äôs lead in the polls has been consistent enough where he has more latitude in his VP choice now. While Harris is a great surrogate, reading about the internal chaos in her campaign leaves the impression she‚Äôd be a source of drama in the WH, &amp; put her 2024 ambitions first.

You need to get out more! It‚Äôs Noon on the 21st! What will you do when Biden doesn‚Äôt win or show up?
Bless your heart. Joe Biden knows more in his little finger than Donald Trump will ever know.

‚ÄúNonconformity‚Äù has no future at the NYT or on the Left! The NYT staff &amp; the Left will not continence it! We must all speak &amp; think as we are told to by our ‚Äúbetters‚Äù! (Not!) The ‚Äúre-education camps‚Äù are just a Biden win away! (Think Manzanar here) Brooks is a ‚ÄúUseful Fool‚Äù!
Biden is neither rich nor a child predator. He is  not a criminal nor did the Obama/Biden administration   commit treason or were impeached. Trump has, since in office, defecated on the Constitution, defied the rule of law and it's still doing it. Also is a vile human being.
I hope that Mr. Biden has the ability to fix what Trump is starting to destroy with China! Hopefully he can contact the Leaders there and let them know Trump will soon be GONE and not to take anything he says seriously! Trump has gotta go!!!!
Its sad that Joe Biden is all the democratic party could muster up, that man has dementia
‚ÄúMy Statement on the Department of Homeland Security Presence in Portland‚Äù by Joe Biden
Great.
I sit here on my couch, with Harry, my doggie, with which I love, and think what a wonderful world.  Vote Biden, I will be singing a different tune.
Sanders had his economic platform set up as his campaign. Biden has adopted that economic plan. It‚Äôs socialism. If that‚Äôs your goal for this country then Biden is your guy. But if you vote for Biden you‚Äôre getting this along with it. Many more receipts than just this vid too
The ones raising for Biden no amount of antiperspirant will quell the stench
here‚Äôs a hint Byedon=Biden . We may need to give you that test that Dump scores so well on . Person, woman, man... Bwahaha
They will debate cuz trump will call him a PUSSY if he doesn‚Äôt. Makes biden look weak when Trump is always infront of reporter‚Äôs
The media will do everything they can to push Biden and limit the info on his political career. I hope people think critically and do their research.
I‚Äôm not sure why Biden is choosing this platform when his policies, voting record and public comments while in office are some of the most racist things I‚Äôve ever heard of. If Biden has any shot he has to go another rout because there‚Äôs a million receipts over his 40yrs in office
The packets were shipped to leading Republicans by a Ukrainian lawmaker who has met with the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani.
Dementia is often followed by stupid acts and/or stupid statements. Biden did just that: ‚ÄúTrump is the first Racist President‚Äù.  I agree with the following: ‚ÄúHow the hell can Donald Trump be the first racist president in a country where 12 presidents before him owned slaves?"
So is Biden the architect of the archaic 1990‚Äôs Crime Bill who will reverse all of Trump‚Äôs progress on criminal justice reform or will he abolish the 4th of July and make The Purge a national holiday in its place?
‚ÄúThis is what America would look like under Biden‚Äù they say about America under Trump.
When i look at Mr. Biden, I see my Dad, who passed at age 88 (feeble).  All I can say until the passing of my Dad, he was sharp as a whip, this man holds no candle.

I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??

I would like Biden/Warren for rebuilding the country, and Harris for AG to prosecute Barr and all those who were complicit during this administration.  No "let's just move forward from here" BS

Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.

Exactly. Any vote for Biden is a ‚Äúfraudulent vote‚Äù. I‚Äôm happy to be a fraudulent voter in that case.
If Joe Biden feels that she is the best choice to help him Build Back Better, then no one should stand in the way. I believe in Kamala and if she were VP then she would absolutely make all of us proud.
1. I'm going to frame this picture.   2. It's frustrating to read reports that people are actively working to prevent Senator  from being picked as Joe Biden's running mate. The most glaring reason is that they believe she is too ambitious.
As I said, Biden's quote was "poor people are just a smart as white people"  You cant get more racist than that, or maybe you can, the Biden Quote, "You have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-11"

Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!

Of course Trump believes that someone with a terrible record of upholding punishments for false convictions would be a good VP pick for Biden given this country‚Äôs current political and social issues. It‚Äôs like a softball for him during any upcoming debates

I love the Barr debates, it really shows what a bunch of idiots in the Democrat Party are trying to try and run this country . Thank God I am no longer a Democrat . Biden just said thank God  we must be alllowed to build this country , he did not add or burn it down
Based on the Anita Hill case, Biden being against busing, supporting the Iraq War and so on, I think the two are closer than you think on many of these.
Obama was even further to the right than Biden and had to be dragged into supporting gay marriage. A true leftist would in no way support drone strikes or indefinite border detaining
Biden is Reagan plus LGBTQ+ rights and abortion rights. They seem to agree on almost everything else (immigration, drugs, police, health care, foreign policy etc)
Barr is lying like Trump! Trump,Pompeo and Barr are pathetic liars who are just gaslighting this country to try and stay in power. We need an honest and non corrupt Administration! Vote Biden 2020

If you werent so defensive youd realize we're saying to vote someone on the ballot and make an actual difference. If youre a Trump supporter just admit it. You dont have to hide vaguely behind "voting by my morals, which might be 3rd party or Trump, but definitely not Biden" lmao
You see? They got you. You really believe Biden is evil lmao. For what? Something he signed in the 90s?  No politician is perfect and you expecting them to be (or otherwise calling them evil) is a big problem in this country.
And yet Biden and eating shit are still better than Trump.
I can't tell if you're saying that Trump matches your morals (racism?) or if you're going to throw your vote away to someone that hasn't done anything politically either, like you claim of Biden.
But you see what's happening right? Same as in '16. The right knows Trump is a piece of shit, so their goal is to make it seem like the other person is just as bad, therefore it's a coin flip for some voters.  Biden may be status quo, but Trump sets the country back 40 years

Where is the justice for you ignoring the constitution, getting foreign governments to help you win an election, blackmaing Ukraine for dirt on Biden and obstructing investigations and telling admin to ignore subpoenas. So much for LAW &amp; ORDER!  Such a loser. No winning for you!!
Those who hate Trump are going to think that regardless.  The people who are undecided will side w/ Biden if he doesn‚Äôt restore order and side w/ Trump if he does.  Those who love Trump may jump off the Trump train if he lets this continue.  THERE ARE NO CONS TO RESTORING ORDER..
No worries, as soon as Biden is in office he'll be back to screaming about government overreach.

They will vote Biden because they want a leader who won't give up on America like you did. You couldn't handle the crisis America faced &amp; gave up Americans want a real leader who won't abandon America during a crisis. On Nov 3rd, you're fired for incompetence &amp; epic failures.
No worries.  Everyone knows Biden is close to being brain dead. I can't wait to pull the plug.
???? You know that ad is a lie. Biden want to add to police funding.   Stop drinking the kool-aid.
That's pretty much it, frankly. Hence why it's the default choice, in a broken duopoly of a system were stuck with for the time being.  Biden might be an out of touch crypt keeper but at least he's not a malicious narcissist crypt keeper.
Haven't decided. Currently Biden, but hate that I have no viable alternative. Keeping a watchful eye on #Unity2020. In no foreseeable circumstance do I vote for Trump, and Kanye is simply just manic right now. It's obvious this isn't a serious campaign.

You're willing to condemn &amp; destroy a family because their 'opinion' of whom the next president should be is different than yours? This is okay? Why intentionally wreck havoc on a person's business/life because they prefer Trump over Biden or vice versa? Unnecessary.
Like the way obama and Biden used the fbi to spy on his opponent
What voters need to understand - It is no longer about a candidate, its about the people and organizations that are riding in on their coat tails.  And with Biden, you get radical organizations, militant groups, special interests such as BLN, ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
This is no longer an election for Trump or Biden.  It is an election for what everyone who died for this country believed in and tries to preserve and grow, or, for every militant special interest group, club, organization and outside factions that want this country, PERIOD
So this is about Biden asking the Ukraine for money, right? Ha ha fools
Biden is going to kick Trump‚Äôs ass in Nov.
Biden's already got international relations covered. Like Obama, he's looking for someone to help in areas he isnt as strong in.
Experienced legislator isn't as important, since that's Biden's bread and butter.  All your other reasons are true of Val Demmings.  Additionally: * 27-year LE career * Sprightly 62 years old * Gives him a boost in Florida
That‚Äôs ok we understand you meant to say Biden
I am a Centrist, but I do lean Conservative.  And, I don't always agree with President Trump.  But this election is no longer about Trump or Biden, its about whether we keep our country or sell it to the Far Left, BLN, and everyone who wants to divide the US.  Scary thought.....
But biden can‚Äôt form a sentence
Fuck Bush Fuck Clinton Fuck Bush Fuck Obama Fuck Trump And Fuck Biden Who's next

Biden is not a serious contender. He‚Äôs only a pawn for a radical agenda who will be manipulated far too easily.
Biden is sure minimumly campaigning, he is hiding from the people!!  RATs think Americans are too stupid to figure it out!!
But it‚Äôs the fact that biden is so clearly worse than Obama and he wasn‚Äôt even good enough
Waiting on bated breath for the Biden pick for his V P.
I'm thinking 80+ million votes for Biden and maybe 50M for Orange Douchius
The Joe Biden campaign ad just shown on MSNBC did NOT catch my attention. Nope.
Vernon Jones your so full of crap! You call yourself a democrat but you attack democrats!  What about all the MAGA that attack Biden supporters? Or MAGA that attack mask wearing citizens?  I hope Georgia votes you out!
It means we‚Äôre not voting for you or sleepy JO Biden you‚Äôll both be flattened by the black trans parade‚Äôs colorful üåà üåà üåà dresses
‚ÄòI‚Äôd rather be Trump than Biden.‚Äô Why Florida should be close in 2020, despite polls
But the people biden listens too are the people ruining society just like trump
I honestly don‚Äôt think that corporate shil biden would do any better than trumps dumb ass in this situation other than supporting masks and the same group of people still wouldn‚Äôt listen to him
Now Biden is a Muslim .  There is no limit to who he will Pander to  suck up a vote . God help us
Well at least you can stay black for supporting Biden. Way to fall in line.
Lying, Shifty  Schiff has run out of ideas to accuse President Trump of or he has acquired Critical Biden Syndrome!! ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
Feeble Biden!! Really RATs???üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Do you remember the Obama-Biden years: major US Companies leave Country, massive unemployment, housing foreclosures high, massive suburb engineering, very high taxes, massive corruption, Presidential apologies to foreign Countries, etc...?
Biden is not picking a VP, He is picking the next President.
Is Biden confused or going blind?
Especially the conservative students? üòÜ Is it like Gangs of New York if you don‚Äôt vote for Ze Furer Biden?
Well it is becoming clear that Trump's covid-19 press conferences are some of the best advertising Biden can get!  The more Trump talks the more people want to vote for Biden! #DumpTrump
How Trump's coronavirus briefings convinced one of his voters to turn to Joe Biden
Likeing, as I do, Kamala Harris , Biden should measure baggage pointed out in her rise to her station . Biden is moving against the tide as it is . Trump will throw everything at him whether true or not .Play safe , Joe . Think about Duckworth for instance .
Seems Kamala Harris is the VP pick . A former judge she has the qualifications for the job .But during the nominee debates it seems she has a pendance for revenge , giving her remark about Biden causing busing that involved her as a child .Her attittude could hurt Bidens choice .
Dude is up for re-election, focus needs to be not only to elect Biden, but also make sure it's Blue all the way #BlueWave2020
Biden is NOT capable of Leading this Country!! ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
The d'RATs are promising to spend trillions of taxpayer money  to win an election!! Americans, who are not voting for Trump but Biden, need to wake up. Don't wait until it is too late!! MAGA!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Pelosi has caught a critical case of Joe Biden Syndrome!! ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
Is that what your brain thinks that someone has to escort Biden out of the area?    Joe Biden likes to speak to people. Whoever this person is, she must be in charge of his schedule &amp; literally making sure she keeps him moving.    UR father has an entourage of people moving him.
Once President Biden takes office, all these ridiculous policy of Trump will be canceled! The United States and Europe needs our show of force  to combat Russian aggression!
Ok! It‚Äôs time for the SILENT MAJORITY to STOP MESSING with the DEMOCRATIC VOTING ON LINE &amp; SAYING THEY‚ÄôRE voting for BIden when they‚Äôre really TRUMPSTERS! It‚Äôs  nice you‚Äôve skewed the numbers like they‚Äôve been doing all along! It‚Äôs time to UNITE and show them that Trump will WIN!

Sanders Campaign Co-Chair Compares Endorsing Biden to Eating a ‚ÄòBowl of Sh*t‚Äô
I can‚Äôt extol the virtues of Dem union policies. Rather note that the Dems have focused on things that seem to ignore unions, which leaves the door open. Biden seems pro union tho. You are right,Dems need more focus on unions.
I'll be hosting a "Women for Biden Phone Bank" this Thursday 7/30 at 12pm on google hangout!! Come and help us #DumpTrump ! #fladems #BlueWave #WomenforBiden LINK BELOW
The media just letting Joe Biden talk without any tough questions or push back.   He looks like he is sick and weak.
At Biden‚Äôs new conference today he seems to have been given the questions ahead of time as he seems to be reading  the answers from a teleprompter and also has a list of reporters to call on?
Anyone. Honestly. I'll be happy with Biden and anyone. Not white and a woman. So no to Warren. It's time for a black woman. I love Stacey but really, anyone with experience. üíô
Going from Barr to Biden makes my brain spin!
And yet.... he got elected President. Biden‚Äôs team needs to be prepared to smash him. Like the LP is.
I was glad to see Walmart banned them for a year! There is no place left in this world for these racist hateful Trump supporters. I wish when Biden wins and democrats take control of congress that they pass a federal law against all these racist Karens!
Trump refuses to pay his respect to Congressman Lewis,clearly putting his narcissism and racism on full display! Where as VP Biden is showing his human side and showing America what we have been missing for 3.5 years! #DumpTrump2020
Biden is a ass whole and insane
I‚Äôm arguing with a wall lol like I said, the silent majority will show all of you libs what is really going on.   Biden is just as much a womanizing scam artist as the next guy.
This is ENOUGH!! I just heard Nadler Obama, Biden, Rice etc call the rioters " Peaceful Protesters."" Despicable!!ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
People like Schumer, Pelosi, &amp; Biden have been there for that last 4 decades.  Trump's been there 3 years, but all this his fault.  A reality check is in order.
Just get rid of the fucking Republicans  Analysis | The Health 202: Joe Biden could undo Trump's changes to the Obamacare marketplaces
My husband and I live in Florida and refuse to leave our home we are that scared for our lives. We vote by mail. Hoping Florida is scared enough to want this evil criminal shit out of office by voting Biden.
Somehow I doubt any decision Joe Biden makes could even begin to approach the death and devistation that trump has already caused. I am willing to take a chance on Joe. #Biden2020
Barr agreeing to testify before the house panel is a departure from previous invites .Could it be that since polling for Trumps reelection is dismal , he's taking a shot at clearing himself of wrong doings.  before Biden is elected?
Joe Biden can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt condemn violence. Oh snap.. at least the paid violence.
Just a reminder that today Joe Biden may reveal that  ( remember that traitor? ) is his VP pick. Between all your other daily prayers, pray that a liar will never occupy this revered role. Unimaginable and disturbing,  what‚Äôs going on in America.
Joe Biden turns to his Radical Muslim brothers .  Voice Of America Promoted A Pro-Biden Muslim Political Campaign Ad, Then Removed It
Imagine not understanding that a refusal to vote for Biden is an active assist to Trump.  If you're not willing to change your mind, as least have the guts to admit you're voting for Trump.
Hey Briab will you tell stupid Steve that Biden is not a Moderate . he is as left as Bernie and demented
If you support Biden nigga you still high
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúMoms for Biden Kickoff‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe

Jerry Nadler denying the existence of Antifa is like people denying that Joe Biden is free of dementia issues.
Biden isn't a needy little bitch.
That's correct, but Biden is 1000% percent better than the sociopath sitting in the whitehouse now!
Your next President? CrazyTown Extended - Joe Biden Edition  via
Amen! Biden is not perfect but he will defend our soldiers and the constitution. Where as Trump has spent 3.5 year undermining the pillars of our democracy all the while defending President Putin our enemy!
Why did Trump not push Putin for the answers?  US soldiers were assassinated because of bounties on their heads! Trump Treason needs to end! President Biden will not let Putin get away with this!
Well then one more thing for Biden to fix.
The federal employees involved in these raids should be fired when Biden is elected! I don't believe we should have federal employees who swore an oath to the constitution and then disregard it so that they up hold their loyalty to Trumps criminal desires!
So  and  , how can we get Biden signs flooding the landscapes in every swing state? I know this is old school but I truly believe the signs have an enthusiasm effect and encourage people to get out and support Biden.
I live and vote in Florida and have a summer home in my native Ohio, both battleground states. As I drive through suburban, rural and metro areas I am seeing  Trump lawn signs in yards 10 to 20 times that of Biden. Iremember seeing this alarming trend with Hillary in 2016.
Welcome to the Democrat presidential ticket:  Harris - Biden Warren - Biden Bass - Biden  Happy days!!  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020
Why didn't they cover Biden's nose with the mask? It would've been less effort in this horrible design to cover it (and plus masks work that way anyway)
Trump is chiding Biden for wanting  an Iraq war. Trump is stoking flames with his lies about Iraq not standing by they promise of no Nuclear proliferation. Did trump get his info from Intel that said Putin is putting a bounty on killing our soldiers? Selective choosing . ?
And I have 100‚Äôs of Biden sniffing women and kids so what?

Biden‚Äôs campaign is ‚Äòsuppressing the Hispanic vote‚Äô in Florida, an internal memo claims
Biden: a handful of oddball statements in his carreer. Trump: every damn day.  How do you even bankrupt a CASINO?  That takes a special kind of dumb.
Joe biden's said the right thing he doesn't work for us he works for the Chinese communist government he's a spy is a communist and he's trying to convert our country to Communism VOTE Republican in November
Yes well here you go Conrad Joe Biden I guess they puppet Master mustang wrote this for him they're all in it together all right to change our country to Communists I don't think so
The true colors pedophiles are the majority now of the new communist Democratic party with the head Nancy pelosi Chuck Schumer Adam Schiff Jerry nadler and they are the puppet Master of Joe Biden

Governance is a machine. Biden is a machine part. Trump is a shoe.
Hey #Biden another thing you forgot to do, whilst being in government for 47 years!!!
If I had given Trump a memory test, I would have given him trigger words, words he would not want to repeat,   Beloved. Obama. Morality. Biden. November.
BOMBSHELL: FBI Investigated Joe Biden's Campaign for Corruption

#Obama &amp; #Biden are the real perpetrators of the entire #ObamaGateIsReal

I‚Äôm in Florida! No Biden signs  No Biden boat parades  No Biden flag waving  No Biden rallies  #FakeNews
Are we seeing the opposite with Biden?  One goes up the other down?
You should not be talking about V. P. Biden!! You need to stay with what donnie boy is going to do DAH...... YOUR IN BAD BAD SHAPE there Bunker bitch.
They are polling mostly Democrats &amp; spewing bogus #'s so people will either stay home or not vote for Trump bcs they'll figure it's no use, Biden is winning. It's a strategy the Dems are trying to use to sway voters by making them think Bidens got this don't bother voting.
I'm listening to AM Tampa 970 &amp; they claim a Quinnipiac poll shows Biden w/ a 12 point lead over Trump. A Quinnipiac pole, hello, one of the biggest liberal s hools in the northern part of the country. People the polls that are being reported by the media are bogus.
The difference between a CEO (Trump) and virtually ALL politicians. Politicians like Obi, Biden and Clinton are lawyers. CEOs are paid to get things done! Lawyers are paid to NOT get things done. Ever see a lawyer ask for a decision today? Nope, always looking to delay. üôÉ
Like "Bernie"is the magic word.A vote for anyone else but Biden is a vote for Trump.
so it's not about Biden leading him in Florida...?
Somehow I can‚Äôt imagine the New York Times spending the next four years sending reporters to cafes in Iowa asking them why they voted for Biden.
I‚Äôm in I surf when Juan Williams Marie Harf and Geraldo Rivera appear Martha McCallum and Shanon Bream are jumping on the Hillary Clinton bandwagon. Biden won‚Äôt even be on the ticket. Dems act like they‚Äôve killed Godzilla.
Here's creepy Joe Biden

Soooooo.....Biden‚Äôs America is Trump‚Äôs America?.....
Pedophile Comrade Joe Biden
10 more days until Biden announces his VP pick. Can‚Äôt wait to get the T shirt! Exciting times. (Please let it be KH)
So, Biden is so desperate that once again Obama (worst President ever) and him are running a fund raiser from his basement.The fact that  is saying he can beat #Biden proves he is in the race to take votes from #biden and ensure his homie Trumps re-election. #kanye u are a sucka! Please #vote #biden and send Kanye and Trump back to their narcissistic looney bins.
But if you can't decide between Biden or Trump? I suggest you go watch the Breakfast Club interview...
Biden could pick Tony the Tiger and I'll still vote Biden in. Actually I really like Tony the Tiger. üåäüòÄ‚òÆÔ∏èüåπ
After it being CLEAR IN THE LIGHT Bill Clinton was in the pedo island and you are still considering voting for Biden.. I think you‚Äôre part of the problem!
Weird that Biden has the huge advantage over Trump...
has rejected suggestions that he choose Cornpop as VP. Instead, he will choose Congressmember  #Biden #2020Election #BidenGate
The Supreme Court's ruling gives Joe Biden the green light if he wins to enact whatever policy he wants and pay for it by taking the funds from the Department of Defense, which I'm sure the conservative Justices will treat the exact same way they've done here

You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads
Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn‚Äôt need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.
Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary
Biden has a great pick to chose from Kamala is Definitely one of them. Love all his picks. I chose Kamala before she even ran in the race.
Horrible company. 42 years of service and you treat me like this. Asking  to investigate your discriminatory practices shame you.
Why is Biden even listening to this dinosaur?
Wow! So soon! A plan? House hearing finds US no closer to plan as coronavirus is 'raging out of control' ‚Äì live
If biden chooses someone who was in the Venceremos then he will loose, many latin votes. Latin people are not willing to for give corporation with the castros. When i say latin i dont just mean cubans. Iean any country destroyed by socialist governments like castro's
Yes goodbye to the corrupt leadership mistakes of Trump and his selfish lies and killing of our Americans lives with his terrible leadership of the Virus epidemic! We need Biden to help get our Democracy back to the people first ! Please Vote üó≥  Senate to become Dem majority üó≥
Typical lying GOP. Obvi, Obama and Biden were handed The great recession from Bush. They took unemployment from 10.5 to 4.6. Trumps claim to fame is giving his buddies $1.3 trillion which they put in the market,  which made the market go up. Big deal. Americans know you‚Äôre a liar
#TheFive Now TheFive has Joe Biden commercials?!
In other words,  want to know how much the State Dept. knows about all their self enrichment schemes.  House Democrats subpoena Pompeo over claims he helped advance ‚Äòconspiracy theories‚Äô about Biden
Got them all!
Job done! Followed, liked, and retweeted. üôÇ
Great. Let‚Äôs bring up that shameful episode again and again, add to the narrative that Biden is a sexist dirty old man, and watch the GOP pounce on that‚Äîjust until the Traitor and Biden are tied in swing states. Then we wring our hands, having given the GOP its August surprise.
Tampa Teen Arrested In Hack Of Twitter Accounts Of Joe Biden, Bill Gates And Other High-Profile Figures
The ‚Äúbad taste‚Äù is being manufactured by pundits making assumptions about what Joe Biden thinks. What ‚Äúthose around him think‚Äù about Kamala Harris should not be used to tarnish Biden himself. You‚Äôre doing the GOP‚Äôs dirty work for them, again.
"We‚Äôve seen huge transformation in Biden‚Äôs climate plan,‚Äù said Varshini Prakash, co-founder &amp; executive director of Sunrise Movement, which claims more than 10,000 members. While stopping short of a formal endorsement, Sunrise will now campaign for Biden.
Interesting that BIASED, LEFTIST, TRUMP HATING South Florida radio station  has said NOTHING about the current Rasmussen poll showing Trump approval rating at 50% vs Biden 48%.  While they blast out every PHONY poll they can find that might show Biden leading Trump.
May be get screamed at. LOL...beaten up by a Biden supporter. That is funny.
No, it was 47-43 Biden.
New ad campaign?  Will it be scarier than the last one?   Will it be more frightening to those already afraid of The Other?  Will it paint Joe Biden as the devil incarnate whose evil minions are coming to rape your daughters and steal your wives?  If not, why not?
Continuing a regressive culture of racial and financial discrimination across the country by rescinding Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. We must move forward not backward in this global housing crisis.
Thanks for the mention!!!
Man I hope her hard work isn‚Äôt interrupted by youthful, keen-minded Joe Biden... getting in a car accident?
I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
Lmao talk to me when the heat lose in the first round. But what u said about Biden is true.
According to the poll, 52 percent of respondents said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today, while 42 percent said they would choose Trump, giving the former vice president a 10 point lead.
95 days until the election and I‚Äôm organizing for Joe Biden because he has a 4-point plan to give essential workers the long-term support they deserve   ‚¨ÜÔ∏èwages, quality/affordable healthcare, free tuition for public higher education, encouraging unionization + more

We can‚Äôt kid, Trump has a real chance of winning this.  Biden must not pick someone most Americans hearing her name say ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù We need them to say ‚ÄúI know her, she can lead this nation if something ever happens to Biden.‚Äù  That‚Äôs the perception needed the moment VP is announced.
"After trying to stonewall virtually every oversight effort by Foreign Affairs Cmte in last 2 years, Mr. Pompeo is more than happy to help Senate Republicans advance their conspiracy theories about the Bidens and I want the American people to see it too.‚Äù
Yeah I know I make absolutely no sense for disagreeing with businesses closing over a virus with a 99% recovery rate. Go ahead and keep it shutdown because Biden doesn‚Äôt know what planet he is on. You all will be exposed for this nonsense it won‚Äôt end well.
I can see it now. Biden wins election and sends feds into Portland. After they will say why didn‚Äôt Trump do it.
fauci all but said it‚Äôs an excuse to hide by Biden
That‚Äôs it! We need the virus so that Biden has an excuse to hide. Boom ...open up the economy... takeoff the mask and let‚Äôs go to work.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
Yeah that‚Äôs why Biden as President is totally going to change America.
Never forget this tweet: Joe Biden. Last OCTOBER.
Anyone a fan of Trump or Biden?
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
I‚Äôm never voting for Biden so I‚Äôm not sure what you are saying here?
She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
I‚Äôll be voting for Joe Biden.
Scary scenario... how fragile our democracy really is! A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty  #TraitorTrump
Prediction‚Ä¶ Trump‚Äôs tweet yesterday about delaying the election was intentional to trigger Dems &amp; have them on record saying ‚Äúabsolutely no way!‚Äù . Then, Oct surprise will show all the crimes Biden committed coming to the surface. Dems will scream ‚Äúwe must delay the election!‚Äù
Here‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs &amp; corrupt Republicans October surprise.....
Here‚Äôs the corrupt Trump Republicans October surprise....
It‚Äôs pretty mind blowing to me how people like Matt S don‚Äôt actually listen to or read Biden‚Äôs policies. They are super moderate and many lean right. It‚Äôs also wild how people in America want to see criminal and anti-American activity from the WH and then claim to be Patriots.
We are gonna vote so hard for Biden. Like I haven‚Äôt seen an anti-Biden post among my friends in like 3 months!
18% approval for the demacratic leaders...  That explains why there are no Biden yard signs.
Already hearing Republicans blaming the coming recession on Biden even though elections have not even taken place yet. Any idiot can see that this economy ahead will not be an easy recovery..
I travel all over... I see U.S. flags on cars, I see Trump written on cars, Everywhere I go.  Yet I have not seen even one Biden yard sign...  The embarrassment must be great.
make America great again dump this racist homophobic corrupt divisive lying POS Trump please vote for Biden
Biden‚Äôs getting a high number for investors *for a Democrat*.
A do think Biden‚Äôs number in the poll was right. It‚Äôs probably 51-49/48 right now or something like that.
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don‚Äôt accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
Ad: Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) Loves Joe Biden  via
Even more controversial take: I think Biden should promise trump not to prosecute him in exchange for trump leaving peacefully if Biden wins.
If I were to meet Joe Biden in person, I would welcome a hug and would know that it was offered with genuine kindness. Trump is so disgusting that the closest I want to be to him is to have a TV screen between us and a mute button close by.
Well, then we don‚Äôt need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is
Dear Joe Biden:PLEASE PLEASE PICK KAREN BASS AS YOUR VP! Thanks from Florida, see you in November
Under Obama and Biden from October 2010 to October¬†2016, the¬†unemployment¬†rate fell from 10% to less than 5%. Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4.7%
‚Å¶ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
And Obama had the audacity to give a ‚Äúeulogy ‚Äú about voting, mass prepaid ballots and trump.  Yeah Obama,  take the spotlight off yourself for SPYING ON TRUMPS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY WITH BIDEN AND COMMEY.   Justice will prevail.
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
Maybe be better to NOT vote to continue 2 decades long war in Afghanistan  - ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èdems are war mongers and Biden is moving to right on foreign policy. Stop the savage us savagery. Focusing on games is a distraction.
If you are so confident why did you float the idea of postponing the elections in November? Because #TrumpIsLosing #Biden #Biden2020
No risk of voter fraud? Sure. President Trump trailing Joe Biden by double digits? That's hilarious. Biden is a drooling,confused old fossil. He has no chance of beating the president.
This Biden tweet is from October 2019
30% drop under the reign of COVID-19. Biden-20 will be far worse when the sanders-commie loving socialist agenda get infected in the American system. Wait and see what happens to the economy when the govt grabs control of everything!
Now this is what our Presidents in the future should aspire to emulate!  We know Joe Biden can!
There is a super incoherent candidate who also is a straight criminal, but it isn't Biden.  So happy this time is ALMOST done
"U.K. Officials‚Äô New Trump Dilemma: What if He Loses?" by BY MARK LANDLER via NYT New York Times
Thank you Mr. Biden we need you now more than ever.
Just like he did in 2016. Fortunately, Biden's got this even if Obama and Bill get bedridden.
Brain Dead Biden
PLEASE CHANGE COURSE .ADKNOWLEDGE THE VIRUS IS OUT OF CONTROL AND COME UP WITH A PLAN AND YOU WILL WIN ..YOUR SUPPORTERS IN FLORIDA ARE TURNING TO BIDEN .I HEAR FROM THEM WE NEED A PLAN NOW HIRE A SPEECH WRITER AND SOMEONE WITH A REAL PLAN
most of what you say happened under your prince obama who never gave a crap about blacks, and still does'nt. I bet he gave Biden the line"You aint black if you don't vote for me" Liberals have PTS. Wear a MAGAhat 24 hours it will cure you when you see leftys from our perspective.
"We just want healthcare"  Are you even old enough to not qualify for your parent's ins? Do you know what it meant pre- Obama / Biden &amp; the ACA to be less than 26 &amp; want health ins? You'd only be able to afford a casualty policy in case you broke your leg skateboarding.
Wow who wrote that for him? BIDEN PLEASE DEBATE OUR PRESIDENT!!!!
Re-Tweeted  Trump Can‚Äôt Stop the Election, But He Can Threaten Democracy
That's not reality, it's a talking point. In reality, it's not about Trump. It's about the pervasive corruption in our establishment. Biden is the embodiment of everything wrong in our political system.
Are these the same polls that say Biden winning big? Yet polls are biased and wrong? Guess I should only trust polls you post?
Nina Turner clearly doesn‚Äôt want Biden elected. At this point she supports delaying the election because she basically supports trump.
Biden said his administration would be reflective of what America looks like  I think that look has to start at VP.
Crenshaw High that's where I'm from... I'm voting Biden cuz I know a 80% of the Black church were begging the feds to do something &amp; supported this law. These people that watched a gangbanger movie or 2 don't know a damn thing about stepping over crackheads to go to school.
Moms for Biden??? What are they doing pimping out their kids to the old pervert?
Why do Dems make everything political... that was my point ... it‚Äôs insanity... and you‚Äôve proved my point... and amused me while I wait to get my buddy at airport ... thanks for that:) his flight was delayed :)) Good luck with Biden ü§™ü§™
Another angry lil Dem... Wahhhh we lost 4 years ago wahhhhh. Make sure you board up tonight ... I just saw maybe 22 mph winds possible ... oh, and see if Biden out da basement yet... does he know he running in 2020? ü§™ü§™ü§™
So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
It democRATS got a candidate like Joe Biden, it is because they don't need a competitive contender to win the elections.  We must be prepared for a massive fraud. We must be prepared to defend our Country from the dirty mob.
Grind them down Madam Pelosi, grind them into the ground. Accept nothing less than what Americans deserve while  tries to kill us all.  You are fierce and fabulous! #Biden2020 #DumpTrump2020 #VoteBlue #TrumpVirus #VoteThemAllOut #BidenForFL #Biden
Cause... the lesser of two evils ... he was a fresh faced young guy In 2008 and Hillary is the Old System like the Bushes in 2016.  Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden is the answer?!? Disgusted with Dems.. own fault if they lose ...
We know Joe Biden isn't tweeting.
BULLSEYE!!! For when Biden is exposed ....he has them all on record now!
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he‚Äôs elected. It‚Äôs a huge selling point.
Which room should President Biden hang trumpy‚Äôs portrait in? I‚Äôm suggesting the incinerator room.
Opinion | Joe Biden just released a pretty good climate plan. The president is still a denier. By Editorial Board
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.
I can tell you now what they will be. Biden Wins. You Lose.
Biden is going to kick your ass so bad and you know it which is why you are trying to delay the election.
And Joe Biden is an asset of the Chinese government... And his crackhead of the son too
But he did argue.. and said nothing. Clearly noted. Biden has done nothing in a lifetime in politics
I'll bet 99% of the "black voices" are voting for Biden. I recall when my cousin's husband, who was a pastor of a Baptist Church, would beg &amp; drag us as well as members of his church to stupid events so he looks good. We are not even Baptist. We are Catholic but did it 4 him.
STOP MAIL IN VOTING!! One letter has been sent to 2 different people.  The Post Office is run by underpaid young people!! No benefits!! Fight the Democrats!! Biden/Kamala.  She had her face redone to look white???
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
Is Devin Nunes receiving secret election dirt on Joe Biden from Ukraine?  It sure looks that way and the Dems literally have the receipts.

Somebody else shaves Joe Biden every morning.    You never see him with facial hair
have to second this...  i probably see 20 or 25 trump stickers/yard signs/etc for every biden one... but i hardly see any biden ones, if that makes sense...
His speech sucked it was a eulogy not a political rally. It‚Äôs just another desperate attempt at fear mongering to scare people into voting for Creepy Uncle Biden who cant even articulate a single sentence.
Landslide! Only a fool would vote for Biden
I don't see that at all... I see that as being American... my neighbor flies a flag on his porch and is voting for Biden in the election.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
‚ÄúMy Statement on Donald Trump‚Äôs Shameless Repeal of DACA‚Äù by Joe Biden
Biden will almost certainly win Maine by double digits. U think there will be a lot of Collins/Biden voters? I‚Äôm more skeptical considering how much Collins is tied to trump.
I wondered if Biden would pick him for VP?
You mean a Fake Ad about Joe Biden
Biden down only 2 in a GOP poll in a district trump win by 17!
U act like Biden hasn‚Äôt said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump‚Äôs fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
Imo she didn't leave enough of a pause between "cup of joe" and "Joe Biden, that is!" The joke fell a little flat
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now‚Äîyou won‚Äôt get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone‚Äôs ideas before we vote.
The mind boggles. Biden...was....VP....
Dude that means a President Biden will do it. Obama and Biden don‚Äôt do anything without talking to each other.
Will your president ever condemn Biden for his racist comments ?

While he's on my TV eulogizing John Lewis, this popped up in my feed.
It is fear that is causing him to try and delay the inevitable, which is the American people choosing Joseph Biden. I mean how appalling is it that the sitting president doesn‚Äôt have enough respect to attend Congressman John Lewis‚Äô funeral. Thank God he only has 5 months left!
A lot of NIMBY‚Äôs are minorities too though. Like my Indian Parents are definitely NIMBY‚Äôs, but they are still voting Biden no matter what.

Joe Biden is older than President Clinton; would anyone want Bill Clinton to be POTUS in his current state of mental decline? Wise up people.  #Trump2020
Ngl, little annoyed at this Biden ad
A Biden bro was mean to me on Twitter now I can't justify voting for Biden. Maybe think twice before you go around calling people selfish.
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
Would you be saying this if the owner was a Biden supporter?  NO
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.
Biden never ran an ad calling implying Obama was a ‚Äúscary black man‚Äù or covertly pushed ‚Äúbirther‚Äù conspiracies. Yet ur a ‚ÄúClinton Democrat‚Äù. And u don‚Äôt have to keep reminding me where I live lmao.
If God help us Biden wins the covid-19 will miraculously disappear January 2021.

So what your saying is that everyone should vote Biden?
Joe Biden's mental decline is an open secret.
Trump worked through gridlock. Biden has late stage dementia.
Is Biden‚Äôs climate plan good?
Because in the real fvcking world, trump destroyed everything I worked for 38 years of my life. If you think an Obama-Biden style presidency is the same as a trump one, you‚Äôre either privileged or you live in a fantasy world.
You‚Äôre deflecting. I guess all the progressives in congress who endorsed Biden are wrong.
Biden should too.
Trent Partridge #globalcoin #facebook #crypto currency
It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
I don‚Äôt think that is really Biden.
I'm old enough to remember this.
If there‚Äôs a ‚Äúred wave‚Äù in 2020 the democrats will be off the mail in voting issue faster than Joe Biden dodging real question from legitimate reporters
via  I‚Äôm so sorry ‚Å¶ we are kicking you out on November 3. #FlushTheTurdNovember3rd
I would swim across shark infested waters to cast my vote for Biden. Luckily, I don‚Äôt have to bc I‚Äôm registered to vote by mail üíå  p.s. Tr*ump can‚Äôt delay the election. His presidency expires on 1/20/21.  would become acting President then. Thx 20th amendment
Don't blame yourself Steve. How could you have possibly known how right Biden was back in April because up to that point Trump had been so respectful of the Constitution and especially the integrity of elections. Try not to be too hard on yourself.
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020
My person dislike has to do with her trying to smear Biden. None of the other women on the list tried to do that.
I guess we‚Äôll  finally hear whatever crap Giuliani has been able to extort out of foreign governments about Obama or Biden or both. Unlikely any of it will be vetted or confirmable. Democrats and independents beware it‚Äôs aimed at you.
No Biden all the way
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden‚Äôs pick. It‚Äôs time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
And we thought the last election was the most important. The ante went up folks.  Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins

Listen up, ladies &amp; gentlemen! Will Mrs Obama be Biden‚Äôs choice for VP next week? It appears to me that it might be! Last night, out of the blue, I had a dream about her!!!
They‚Äôre not switching out Biden while he‚Äôs up. Far more likely that Biden gets voted in, then they do the switch.
No one‚Äôs voting biden
A long, long, long time ago... Funny, in my house we refer to Trump by the moniker, ‚ÄúStupid‚Äù too!!
NO,  Pres Trump is trying to deal with the mayhem backed by dumbocruts and ANTIFA, Covid-19, and putting Obama, Biden, Hillary and commey in prison for spying on presidential Republican nominee Trump2020.
So we get GDP figures today. It should be a good day for Biden to blame Trump not the Chinese his handlers but Trump. It‚Äôs a pandemic Joe and you couldn‚Äôt have done anything but probably put more people in harms way. But go ahead get the hair on your legs standing up.
Hunter Biden got his big payday with no qualifications because of his last name. He is indicted in Ukraine and has other issues. If you and I did what he did we would be in prison right now.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
I think she may lose her primary, and if Pelosi and Biden endorse her they are spineless. Brenda Jones should represent that district.

i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
She just has been asking every guest ‚Äúwhat if he doesn‚Äôt leave?‚Äù And every guest has said a variation of ‚Äúafter Biden is sworn in, he‚Äôs not the president and no one has to take his orders.‚Äù William Barr can‚Äôt body block Joe from the Oval.

Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn‚Äôt, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it‚Äôs overkill  saying all that Biden‚Äôs gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
Who would you want Biden to pick as VP?   I still have no idea who I want
During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump‚Äôs plan?
You realize you‚Äôre behind double digits in the polls? And Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt done or said a thing.
Biden wins Penn,Wis,in addition to Michigan &amp; he is over 270!!!!Besides AZ,FL,NC,GA,TX,etc,etc,etc...
But in a way that‚Äôs better for Biden. We know Kamala and her record, so no surprises. A lower name pick could lead to a surprise in the middle campaign that could hurt Biden.
His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it‚Äôs way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!
She‚Äôs senile along with Biden
I thought about that, but they like to have American fighter jets. Biden makes one call and he‚Äôs in a diplomatic bag, on a plane to Guantanamo.
If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn‚Äôt win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.
As a Dem, you can‚Äôt be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll stay on the job after he loses. I think he‚Äôll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
I didn‚Äôt then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Ya know what America needs to unify it? A dementia ridden white guy and a cop
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That‚Äôs the real question
Ummmm he walked. ... he ain‚Äôt running anywhere... except for President... and that race he‚Äôll win... Biden is aloof
He just hates Biden; that‚Äôs all.
I agree? But that‚Äôs not the topic here. It‚Äôs voting for Biden.  I‚Äôm not going back and forth on this.
That‚Äôs not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn‚Äôt VP.  That‚Äôs what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can‚Äôt even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I‚Äôve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We‚Äôve got nothing to discuss.
why do we have to chose between him or biden ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden loses with Harris. No brainer.
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
I'm sure of it. Now if Kamala Harris is AG for Biden, she will kick ass. AG's have more power that VP's.
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!
The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.

#97Days Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
Yes- that‚Äôs where the OP started. Our conversation started about whether or not she‚Äôs been a good senator. Anyway- this is a pointless discussion because again, it‚Äôs not being made in good faith. Vote Biden regardless üëçüèª
Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
Every single day at every single meeting with heads of state or otherwise, Trump turns it into a political rally and an attack on #Biden. And the slavish press covers his propaganda no matter what the meeting was intended for. Shameless.
Means she was willing to destroy his reputation and step over the smoldering remains to get into the White House. If Biden had tried that with Obama you wouldn‚Äôt want him as vp
Someone‚Äôs having trouble accepting the greatness of Joseph Robinette Biden jr., 46th President of the United States üòÇ
But my initial read as Biden‚Äôs campaign being cutesy with the VP slot seems inaccurate; it looks like the campaign is dealing with a revolt from loud backers, which has spilled into the press. So I guess we‚Äôre playing our part.
And people are worrying about Biden....this is frightening
Exactly. Voters don‚Äôt care. That‚Äôs why flogging the veepstakes is a dead horse spectacle. But it sounds like there is real dissent in the ranks, and it is not Biden waffling. That‚Äôs why we have to be vocal. Sorry for all the tweets. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I thought It was rice, but now I think it‚Äôs Harris. U don‚Äôt leak especially after the Biden campaign shut it down unless u lost.
And you‚Äôre said I‚Äôm the one disrespecting Biden ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The Racist is Really showing his True Color.   Don't Worry  President Biden will change it Back.
Dude, I think she‚Äôs the pick. Why would they leak if she‚Äôs not?
You sound like a Fox News infomercial, man. I have a friend who watches Fox &amp; he said the exact same thing, verbatim. Do you also think Biden ‚Äúsmells‚Äù children? C‚Äômon... look at our country today!! We couldn‚Äôt take much more of all this winning!
So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it‚Äôs not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn‚Äôt want to hear.
but even then, he would have said a complete sentence which beats out to the current dementia-laden, 5-word memorizing, dangerous-drug pushing, clown in office today! But yea, Biden will be removing the obese one!
It didn‚Äôt happen under Obama/Biden. It won‚Äôt happen.  Trump is a liar.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"
With its mismanagement of the Covid 19 response, this Administration hasn't shown the empathy for those lives lost during the pandemic. Seniors, especially, take note and vote for Joe Biden.
I'm HOPING she will!  Biden is a corporate toady - but so is she, so....
As a man I thought AOC moved us all forward on treatment of women and language. Nah. After what you just said about Biden, I realized you‚Äôve just been well behaved for Bernie‚Äôs sake- you are still the FUCKING BITCH I knew you were in 2015 #ninaturnerisafuckingbitch

Joe Biden for president!
Smh at this rate Biden gets to 65% with college educated whites.
Biden seems like the only person to get close. Anyways focus on FL and NC in my opinion.
Pretty interesting that Covid-Don names a bunch of states he obviously thinks he is losing to Biden: NV, OH, PA, FL, AR.  Looking forward to the grants to TX, GA, KY and SC.
There just seems to be too many republican voters. Biden is literally maxing out Moderate and Independent support.
Pretty good numbers for Biden ngl.
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!
Georgia Tossup ü§î. Looks like Biden is outperforming Stacey Abrams by 2 percent with white voters and massively winning swing districts, but it still may not be enough due to the sheer power of republican counties and voters.

It‚Äôs a deliberate leak (reveal) as a trial balloon. Trying to judge the reaction for having a VP who is a descendant of slave owners and an aggressive prosecutor of minorities using the Crime Bill written by Biden. Joes handlers don‚Äôt do anything with a poll.
I‚Äôm not even sure of a virtual debate at this point. I didn‚Äôt realize how bad Biden is it‚Äôs embarrasing that this was the best Dems could do after 4 years.
A Biden/ Harris ticket is a disaster waiting to happen. Both with anger issues and a history of passing and enforcing laws against minorities. How can you vote for a ticket with a defendant of slave owners on it?
I absolutely believe this... I worry what Trump &amp; Barr will do the days after he loses (if we vote)&amp; Biden takes office! Trump will sabotage the country &amp; no telling what else.... but regardless, Trump &amp; his Administration will pay for every crime committed &amp; ever dime grifted!!
So Jellyfish Joe Biden may have slipped up and it‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs picking a VP who is a descendant of slave owners, one who prosecuted Biden‚Äôs Crime Bill aggressively and jailed thousands of minorities for offenses she herself admits to doing as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris

God what are you 5? Just vote for Biden to get Sweet Potato Hitler out of office. Stop with the kiddie nonsense. Not getting trump out is letting fascism truly take over.  Why do centrist like to play nice instead of getting tough?
She and Biden are why I will vote Libertarian. Kamala Harris is a cop!
Biden is why we have Trump.
.. just like in 2018 .. the vote was cemented in .. it would take Biden dropping out or conceding .. that would b the easiest way for trump to win . Another way would hav federal troops arrest all democrats right b4 the election . That‚Äôs. What q is saying anyways üôÑ
I hope the Biden administration is prepared to deal with increased domestic terrorism and hate crimes. Sadly, these punks won‚Äôt be going away.
You can‚Äôt even #resist telling the most obvious lie! #Enthusiasm for #Biden is YUGE and you know it, spanky!
We all can‚Äôt wait for Biden...and you....üòÉü•≥
Biden don't give a shit about the American People neither does Nancy or Chuck. I wish they were out of Politics forever.
The reason the name BIDEN looks like (Osama) BInlaDEN is because his supporters love burning the American Flag üá∫üá∏
Wish we would have been concerned about healthcare this winter.  But noooooooooo  We had to deny reality as a country again.  I'm glad Bernie debated Biden in a vacuum. I'm unhappily voting for a Christian creep. Allow Jewish ppl to have decent political positions!
FBI Investigated Biden Campaign for Delaware Way Corruption
Best part of this...YOUR DADDY DID IT..BIDEN IS NOT PRESIDENT YET.... IS A JACKA*S. and so are you....Not Ivanka...
As well as I highly recommend you learn the history of your country! And research before you decide!! Biden doesn't know his ass from a home in the ground!!
Never Biden.
Eric Trump reacts to Biden teaming up with Obama to bash the president
Lots more folks died of H1N1. Where's your outrage at Obama/Biden? Oh. It's all politics to you. Outrage at governors who sent covid into nursing homes and killed thousands? Nah. #Disingenuous
Joe Biden was better when we just memed about him and knew nothing about him
A BIG TAX BURDEN WITH BIDEN VOTE  LOW TAXES

Awww Lawdy!!! Be thanking the Lawd for bringing us some Joe Biden, oh yes chile where would we be without us havin some Joe Motherfucking Biden to save us from some climate change
I‚Äôm #RidinWithBiden   Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
1/2 Allow me to pose one final question. What exactly was the desired outcome of insulting me, sending a twelve tweet rant, &amp; only sending Joe Biden's website? If the goal is to accomplish swaying a potential voter, u failed. If the goal was to be indignant &amp; defensive, u succeed
Harris seen as Biden VP favorite as clock ticks    #KamalaHarris4VP #BidenHarris2020
And Biden is?
I‚Äôm seeing the Florida for Biden shit trending and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúno one else? Do I have to? Ugh whatever‚Äù The Biden campaign probably calls that enthusiasm
Trump never said he dislikes immigrants. His wall is to keep people who are not citizens from taking our benefits. They need to be legitimate. Their are rules and criteria for everything. Listen Biden sucks donkey balls. Trump is way better.
West Central Florida, more Trump signs for sure but I have seen people ona busy street corner with Biden signs.
Go to Joe Biden's website. It's all there. It's not hard to find. You replied to my tweet to disagree with me asking a question. What is the Dems platform, if it's not this? I'm not voting for Biden. If you think that's wrong, tell me why.
And you imply it's not true. I ask what is the correct info then? I didn't go to a pro Biden tweet to contest it.  Your not going to get any new Biden voters on your team by condescendingly telling people to figure out the Dems "correct" platform for themselves buddy.
Did Kanye just say he was going to beat off Joe Biden üò¨
Biden literally came out with his presidential campaign policies over a week ago
USA CANT TAKE ANOTHER 8 YEARS OF   factory layoffs, massive company closures, high unemployment, service job declines, lower salaries and higher taxes, decreased hours, part time and multiple jobs just to stay alive.  NO MORE BIDEN  NO MORE DECLINE
I see that too. I just can't vote for Biden. We need to send a clear message that we vote for our convictions. They use fear to keep us as slaves. Vote your convictions!
USA CANT TAKE ANOTHER 8 YEARS OF   factory layoffs, massive company closures and unemployment, service job declines, salary declines and longer hours just to stay alive.  NO MORE BIDEN  NO MORE DECLINE
Not voting Biden. You reap what you sow. I did not vote for Andrew Gillum either. But, I can say that the Governor of Louisiana is the best. He should be President.
Higher taxation means less money in your pocket and greater government control or Marxist Socialism. Opposite with  more money in your pocket means your choice, your destiny, not the governments, not Biden's.
I would pay to see Biden and President Trump and a debate
Do you need to see the receipt that I gave to Joe Biden? $25 of my hard earned money to Biden! OK group of Catholic Karen‚Äôs what the hell you gonna do about that? Tell on me? Call the pope! But you won‚Äôt because Karen‚Äôs have no power.
I see a lot of people saying "Dems didn't say that".  Which is funny, but also, if that's NOT what the Dem platform, and more specifically, Biden's platform is, then what is it that Dems want? Please tell me, what are the platform stances Dems are for? (Besides hating trump)
This is literally Biden's campaign platform. Including "the abolition of the suburbs".
Thank you. I am not a vote shamer either. I get why people vote for Trump or Biden. I think the whole medical system in the US needs to be overhauled. That means everything! Our current system is too capitalized. Everything from pharmaceutical development to hospitals. 1/2
I was a lifetime Democrat. I haven't voted Democrat, except local elections, since they cheated Bernie in 2016. I voted Trump because Hillary is POS and the Dems are too. Trump = Hillary/Biden. I voted Independent Fl governor. Voting Libertarian for first time. I don't like Howie
Yes it‚Äôs a waste, we need to drown Trump in the blue water of democracy and vote Biden and move back to America the World leader and not in deaths by a stupid president
Biden‚Äôs world
I have a joke about a mask, Joe Biden and Trump but only 2 of them can Make America Safe Again. #TrumpFailedAmerica
Joe Biden is a pandering fool.  I don‚Äôt believe ANYTHING he says,
Thank you Col. Vindman. 101 days.   Biden will be calling you after Nov.
Biden is why we have Trump. Vote 3rd Party.
Travel ban? You mean in April? You lie....Big Win? Only for Biden in November.
So, elect Biden??
We will have to drag him out crying and whining...he won‚Äôt go quietly into the night. He has already said, if he loses, he will not go to Biden‚Äôs inauguration. like a 2 year old.
thinks if he destroys the post office...he can stop vote-by-mail...he can‚Äôt. WE WILL VOTE....TRUMP HAS TO GO..HERE IS MORE PROOF..I WOULD CRAWL OVER BROKEN GLASS TO GET HIM OUT...VOTE BIDEN...
If you don‚Äôt support the Phillies, you ain‚Äôt black...Joe Biden July 23 2020.
Biden would be asleep once the basement putting lotion on his hairy legs.  We would be getting shit on again by every country who wanted to screw with us
Enjoy your Biden country if you help make it happen.
People tell me they will vote for Biden just because Trump irritates them. They will be the first ones crying after Biden starts to rip our country to shreds. I have been thinking of moving to Costa Rica or Panama and if Biden gets in ( by some freaking mistake) I‚Äôm out
And you REALLY think the majority of voters in this country want Poor Joe Biden ? Most Democrats feel sorry him. But will not vote for him .
Make sure you check Biden's ear for a device.
Go away Obama your time is up and you must be kidding who could vote for demented Joe Biden BAWawaWawa
Flashback: Biden Accused Romney of Being a Racist
....which reminds me. will Trump be requesting special precautions against History repeating itself and demand special precautions that Joe Biden isn't slipped the debate questions by the same pundit or any pundit for that matter?......
Wow! Tough guys...That dancing flower girl looked dangerous.ü§° This is a #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare BIDEN AD.
‚ÄúChip in‚Äù is a good way to put it! Vote in Biden, and we my all have chips put in us!
Biden needs to be retired. He is not a cognitively functioning adult. I hate Trump, but I won't vote Biden.
There won't be any debates. That would be political suicide for Biden. The man can't put 2 words together coherently. Trump would annihilate him.trump is an insane liar. He is still okay with Putin paying terrorists to kill American military personnel. Vote for Joe Biden on 11/3/20.
The first one who hates wearing a mask is Joe Biden, hypocrites!
He‚Äôs right about that. 1/20/21 President Joe Biden will be sworn in and the USA will begin to move forward again. Vote Joe Biden on 11/3/20.
You and the  trump  sycophants  are the only  people  who  believe  that . That's  about  30% of voters .  Vote  for  Joe  Biden  on  11  /  3  /  20 .
Black people aren‚Äôt safe in trumps America. Vote for Joe Biden 11/3/20.
Biden is ready for the nursing home!
‚ÄúThank you for helping that dumbass, Joe Biden.‚Äù
Trump is desperate. He knows he is going to lose the election, so he thinks he can change the November election date. Trump is unhinged!  2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Floats Whether to ‚ÄòDelay the Election,‚Äô Something He Cannot Legally Do
Joe Biden  won't  be  sworn in  until  1/20/21. How is taking  a  few days  to count  all the  ballots  a problem ?
trump  is  responsible  for  the  150,000 deaths  in  the  USA  from  covid19 . warned of  a  pandemic  in 9/19 trump  failed to  notify  the  public . When  he finally  took action  in 3/20 the  virus had already  spread  over  the  USA .  BIDEN  11/3/20.
This is odd if you know Biden promised he would reign in his own ambition and consider being VP the end of his political career and not run for prez, when Obama was vetting him. But here we are. His ambition is ok though. Stop holding women to double standards.
Biden is out mine. He can‚Äôt speak straight!
What really bothers Americans is that you‚Äôre Putins puppet and you‚Äôre okay with Putin paying terrorists to kill American military personnel. We want JOE BIDEN , an American , to lead the country. Vote for Joe Biden 11/3/20.
Anything you do will be undone by Biden. Keep dreaming awake!
The American people are tired of trumps ignorance, incompetence, hate, lies and racism. We want an American President not Putins puppet. VOTE for JOE BIDEN on 11/3/20.
That question is why I find the polls interesting. If they are representative it seems like the naysayers are fewer, even if very vocal. If Biden is at the top, why not EW or KH? He‚Äôs not my choice, but he‚Äôs what we got. They
Biden is my guy.
And the Democrats are represented by Joe Sniffing Biden, which reminds me of this.
Biden with have free rein, then work with #GOP remaining to balance and heal the Nation.  will be counseled by Bo.
Tell me when we have effective vaccines AFTER Biden is in office, and how many obstructionist GOP members are ousted along with Trump. Then I‚Äôll give you my answer.
After the first debate, Biden‚Äôs lead is going to disappear.
No need to fret, Biden will pardon the lot‚Äô
Up to Biden because you didn‚Äôt know to do it in the last three years!
Mickey be nice, say hello to this Biden supporter.
I wondered how much this was going to be held against her. It also explains why some others are still on the list. We are going to learn a lot about what Biden thinks about women‚Äôs leadership. Does he want a peer who can challenge him? Or someone he thinks will be deferential?
They keep on campaigning for Biden.
trump is controlled by Putin. trump is a traitor. trump is okay with Putin paying terrorists to kill American military personnel. Vote for JOE BIDEN 11/3/20.
I oppose him taking Federal funds from Charter and Private schools. We all know that children from low- income families benefit from these funds especially the McKay scholarship. This is the Biden-Sanders plan.
Trump is toast. Biden enters office with pedal to the metal. Keep your sell orders to a minimum.
PATRIOTS !  NO LONGER BIDEN ! WE NEED TO STOP SAYING DEMOCRATIC EXTERMIST !  THIS IS A COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT THIS IS A TAKEOVER OF OUR COUNTRY !  THE ELECTION WILL NOT HAPPEN !  We have already heard MSM SAY TRUMP WILL BE REMOVED  COMMUNIST DO NOT GO ! MUST BE REMOVED!
No convention , no politics , no Biden !  Only communist and the shadow Government working in silence !
Fixed it for you..  THIS IS BIDEN/ CLINTON / OBAMAS AMERICA FOR YOU
Biden Does not understand your asinine tweet, you have to explain it to him and very little words and very slowly.ü§°
You have to admit though, it is good to see Pelosi and Biden with a mask over their mouths. Really good to see!!!
trump has declared war on America. He is sending his gedtspo to selected cities to sow violence and chaos. trumps idea of America is what was 1930‚Äôs Germany. We must vote for Joe Biden on 11/3/20 to stop this fascist madman.
Well folks it‚Äôs July and for the past month the RNC and the trump campaign has been burning dollars on negative ads in Florida against Joe Biden . I smell fear, or maybe trumps diaper. The gop is supposed to have Fla. locked up.
Well Trump's supporters have jobs and contribute to society Biden supporters like to feel his leg hairs don't mind being sniffed and are all sitting back waiting on a stimulus check President Trump is giving them NOT Joe Biden, I suppose that makes his supporters stupid to üôÑ
Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, AOC, and the Democratic Party are rejoicing.
We gotta get  to make biden a song.
.It was certainly wonderful to see and hear you, sir. I‚Äôm particularly impressed with you and Mr. Biden practicing the necessary guidelines with social distancing and masks. If only you were president when this all started, I know things would be so different.
He‚Äôs campaigning for Biden OPENLY!
You are confused, that's what kids say to Joe Biden.
Get over it. The two most embarrassing things a president ever did were Obama ignoring the plight of black people in America, and picking Joe Biden for VP.
I am not sure but I do know they helped the handicapped.........Joe BidenWhich Joe Biden have you been listening to?
What is taking so long??? There have always been a limited number of choices- Joe Biden made it that way! His inability to pick is like his campaign-uninspired!
Biden is procrastinating on making a VP pick like he is about deciding to get into this race! Any concerns over his lack of decisiveness? He mandated his choices were pretty limited!
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads

I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
I would like Biden/Warren for rebuilding the country, and Harris for AG to prosecute Barr and all those who were complicit during this administration.  No "let's just move forward from here" BS
Biden what you gonna do ?
I‚Äôll be voting for Joe Biden.

‚Å¶ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
Biden didn't even have a flunky show up
We do t have to worry about them now... they are your stsffs... can you even use a cell phone? I see your symptoms.. my dad has it.. I know Biden has mental defects due to dementia
Hi. Mom for Biden here. I attended the launch party last night with  and it was refreshing to hear positive and informed ideas. I can‚Äôt wait to vote for a candidate who will value and protect the lives of children, teachers, and staff. #MomsForBiden

Exactly. Any vote for Biden is a ‚Äúfraudulent vote‚Äù. I‚Äôm happy to be a fraudulent voter in that case.
If Joe Biden feels that she is the best choice to help him Build Back Better, then no one should stand in the way. I believe in Kamala and if she were VP then she would absolutely make all of us proud.
1. I'm going to frame this picture.   2. It's frustrating to read reports that people are actively working to prevent Senator  from being picked as Joe Biden's running mate. The most glaring reason is that they believe she is too ambitious.
As I said, Biden's quote was "poor people are just a smart as white people"  You cant get more racist than that, or maybe you can, the Biden Quote, "You have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-11"
We will make #GoodTrouble to elect Joe Biden! #WeWillVote

I will wade through a moat of fire surrounding the polls to vote for Biden.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
"You're not black on the inside. I'm more black than you on the inside."  see also: "You ain't black" - Biden
If Biden wins this election, this will be the third time in a row an elected Democratic President will have to clean up a huge economic disaster left by his Republican predecessor.
In November.........If we are not Riding with Biden we will "Dying with Donald"
If we are not Riding with Biden we will "dying with Donald"
The Democratic Party and the liberal media will continue to say that Biden is leading in the polls so when the dems actually lose but steal the election they will say  That trump was losing all the way up to the elections so of course he lost. MEDIA CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE

Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
Mark Levin  covered this on his show and it stopped me in my tracks, as I was in a state of shock learning about the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. They would file lawsuits against suburbs and tax payers are the ones that foot the bill. Thank you again Mr. President! #MAGA
You framed the question wrong. Shouldn‚Äôt it be, anyone afraid Kanye win the election or get more votes from both Biden and trump. No?
That would be Obama and Biden.......
So if yt people don‚Äôt even want to vote for Trump or Biden than who y‚Äôall voting for??
Joe Biden is almost brain dead

This is who you want as pres? Doesn‚Äôt sound good to me.
Joe Biden for president!
Of course Trump believes that someone with a terrible record of upholding punishments for false convictions would be a good VP pick for Biden given this country‚Äôs current political and social issues. It‚Äôs like a softball for him during any upcoming debates
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!

What a disaster Biden was today .. lol
Wooden, stilted, rehearsed! I‚Äôm Joe Biden and I support this message!!!
I love the Barr debates, it really shows what a bunch of idiots in the Democrat Party are trying to try and run this country . Thank God I am no longer a Democrat . Biden just said thank God  we must be alllowed to build this country , he did not add or burn it down
Based on the Anita Hill case, Biden being against busing, supporting the Iraq War and so on, I think the two are closer than you think on many of these.
Obama was even further to the right than Biden and had to be dragged into supporting gay marriage. A true leftist would in no way support drone strikes or indefinite border detaining
Biden is Reagan plus LGBTQ+ rights and abortion rights. They seem to agree on almost everything else (immigration, drugs, police, health care, foreign policy etc)
Barr is lying like Trump! Trump,Pompeo and Barr are pathetic liars who are just gaslighting this country to try and stay in power. We need an honest and non corrupt Administration! Vote Biden 2020

If you werent so defensive youd realize we're saying to vote someone on the ballot and make an actual difference. If youre a Trump supporter just admit it. You dont have to hide vaguely behind "voting by my morals, which might be 3rd party or Trump, but definitely not Biden" lmao
You see? They got you. You really believe Biden is evil lmao. For what? Something he signed in the 90s?  No politician is perfect and you expecting them to be (or otherwise calling them evil) is a big problem in this country.
And yet Biden and eating shit are still better than Trump.
I can't tell if you're saying that Trump matches your morals (racism?) or if you're going to throw your vote away to someone that hasn't done anything politically either, like you claim of Biden.
But you see what's happening right? Same as in '16. The right knows Trump is a piece of shit, so their goal is to make it seem like the other person is just as bad, therefore it's a coin flip for some voters.  Biden may be status quo, but Trump sets the country back 40 years
I'm voting by mail and I'm voting for Biden!  Done!!!!!!!

Hello Gov. You would be a terrific choice to be Joe Biden's running mate and I hope he selects you.  You have an impeccable background and you would do great things together.  Good luck!  In any event, the citizens of Rhode Island are proud you are their Governor.
I live in South Florida and the same, not one Biden sign anywhere
I agree. I am afraid if Biden picks an African American for VP there will be problems. trump is a bully. And there are a lot of racism that is underground. Hell, a lot of it is no longer underground.

We don‚Äôt need to see Biden being interviewed. It‚Äôs more fun watching  Person Man Women Camera TV.  Stable genius
Then again I'm sober and I still wouldn't vote for Biden no way.
There didn't seem to be a problem with Biden and Hussein in the same room, shootin the shit. ü§î
It's called respect.  Thank you President Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.
Cant belive how nieve people are not seeing how Biden is..hes a joke
I am not a Bernie supporter lady.  Sorry.    But thanks for finding that.  I don't see any super predator speak in it, but yea, Eff Bernie, and Biden and def HRC and their supporters.  Ok, now what?  I'm still not voting for Biden.  So ????  You want a cookie?  Just made some.
So?  What makes you think I'm a Bernie fan?  Because I said screw Biden?   SCREW BIDEN!  and HRC for going out with the super predator stuff.  Since you like Google.  Google me a video of ANYONE other than HRC, Biden, or Billy clint Clint being super douchie about it.
Please stop talking about how hot Joe Biden is and focus on his policy
Biden would HATE if you retweeted
And you dont listen.  I said I dont like nor support biden.  And I rightfully despise trump.
There is no truth to your rhetoric. Nice try, but I despise Clinton &amp; Biden You truly believe your side is 'right' while supporting an incompetent asshat like trump who procured underage girls from epstein.  Laughable. You're no different than catholic priests in your hypocrisies
I still think the DNC cheated Sanders it's no way Biden should have won Texas with no support there

Trump special, West special, Biden ordinary #vision2020
Biden found time to coach his late  son Beau's baseball team when he was a commuting senator!! Can you imagine Trump doing that??!!
Biden can't talk his way out of a paper bag! I'm terrified that Biden is going to possibly get another chance to implement Osama Obama's failed, self serving, America destroying policies! #Trump2020LandslideVictory
More if he gets a second term. He will get that. Too many ppl on the left think, why vote? I've got things to do. Someone else will do it. Then you just voted for Trump. Ppl have to vote Biden. And senators as well.
Hey, didn‚Äôt they have a fiery exchange about busing or done legislation Biden authored??
I admire her greatly, but will she be the inspiring person needed to add life into the Biden campaign? I‚Äôm not so sure. She is part of the old regime. This campaign needs new blood, something to show DEMS are moving forward not relying on the past. Biden is more than we can hai
What you really mean is Joe Biden won‚Äôt sit for any Interview! Everything is pre-taped and edited! He is not capable!
Biden is ‚Äúnot available‚Äù means he is ‚Äúnot capable‚Äù of sitting for a Chris Wallace interview!

Biden-Bottoms doesn't have a good ring to it
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Obviously ur not a true democrat bc if you were, you would be questioning A&amp; speaking out against Pelosi, Schumer, Waters and the idiots like AOC.  Biden is a puppet who can‚Äôt remember what office he‚Äôs running for, can‚Äôt remember his wife from his sister. He can‚Äôt remember shit!
Where is the justice for you ignoring the constitution, getting foreign governments to help you win an election, blackmaing Ukraine for dirt on Biden and obstructing investigations and telling admin to ignore subpoenas. So much for LAW &amp; ORDER!  Such a loser. No winning for you!!
Those who hate Trump are going to think that regardless.  The people who are undecided will side w/ Biden if he doesn‚Äôt restore order and side w/ Trump if he does.  Those who love Trump may jump off the Trump train if he lets this continue.  THERE ARE NO CONS TO RESTORING ORDER..
No worries, as soon as Biden is in office he'll be back to screaming about government overreach.
Reverse the polls saying Biden 62% and Pres 38 such BS
Part of Joe Biden's Inaugural speech will be "I will tear down this wall"!
Omg.  As Biden would say, that‚Äôs a bunch of malarkey.  üôÑ
#Trump2020 Mr president you must win Florida send your best people. We can‚Äôt let Biden win
Thanks Stacy
Is that why Biden is up in ALL polls!  You're going down DUMPY!
They will vote Biden because they want a leader who won't give up on America like you did. You couldn't handle the crisis America faced &amp; gave up Americans want a real leader who won't abandon America during a crisis. On Nov 3rd, you're fired for incompetence &amp; epic failures.
No worries.  Everyone knows Biden is close to being brain dead. I can't wait to pull the plug.
???? You know that ad is a lie. Biden want to add to police funding.   Stop drinking the kool-aid.
That's pretty much it, frankly. Hence why it's the default choice, in a broken duopoly of a system were stuck with for the time being.  Biden might be an out of touch crypt keeper but at least he's not a malicious narcissist crypt keeper.
Haven't decided. Currently Biden, but hate that I have no viable alternative. Keeping a watchful eye on #Unity2020. In no foreseeable circumstance do I vote for Trump, and Kanye is simply just manic right now. It's obvious this isn't a serious campaign.
I hope all 83 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You assume it's Biden yet she didn't say Biden.  Check your assumptions.

So, I'm not planning on voting. (Not voting for Trump, but I'll condition my vote for Biden If I get these demands met:  1. Hawaii is given back to the Hawaiians;  2. 100% of aid to Israel is stopped unless 67 borders are restored AND palestinians get Reparations for Nakbha;  1/
Biden/Anybody is ok with me at this point, as long as it's not "him".
Don't know, would only be speculating, but I am ok with Harris, Warren, Rice, Duckworth, Bottoms. Trust Joe Biden to make the best choice.

At least to about the middle of next year. If it is still raging on January 20, 2021, Joe Biden will institute a national "wear a mask" program that will FINALLY get it under control.

Joe Biden Slams Trump Over Treatment of Latino Workers
Biden is supposedly considering someone named Bass as his VP.  Can you say fish face?
Agree. My only fear is that Biden may feel that he‚Äôll be overshadowed by her, charismatic as Kamala is (which would be a shame).
Yeah that‚Äôs not entirely true - the entire dem platform is catered to republicans- they have zero leftist policies and nothing for independent voters - trump is even to the left of biden on foreign policy
What is your plan Mr Biden ??a lot of criticism but no plan ???

I don't think there's been any change in awareness of Joe Biden's platform from July 24 to July 29.  I think it's a lot more likely Change Research was just a shitty poll.   Let's see how the polls change over the next few weeks when we get a clearer view ‚úå
Not Donald Trump falsely attacking Joe Biden for not wanting to pick a Latino VP when HIS Vice President is   *checks notes*   Mike Pence
They‚Äôre already attacking Biden in Spanish TV ads for not picking a Latina VP. The ad is meant to turn brown people against black people. It isn‚Äôt going to work but it shows where they‚Äôre going.
Prediction: Trump camp is going to abandon the ‚Äòlaw &amp; order‚Äô campaign for a bit since it‚Äôs not working.They will be throwing everything at the wall to see if anything sticks.Most likely strategy is to attack Biden as a racist/sexist &amp; attack the VP candidate to depress D turnout.
ü§£ü§£ü§£ more peopl votes for McCain against Obama than Bernie voters voted for trump. Stop putting shit candidates out there and you would get more votes. It doesn‚Äôt get more establishment than Clinton and Biden.
You're citing the Change Research poll. For what that's worth, it's rated poorly by 538. Other polls show a more sizable lead. Five days earlier, the better-rated pollster Fox had Biden far outside the MOE in each rust belt state

The #coronavirus non stop has  keeps the welfare to Wall Street in high gear!
I‚Äôve been suspicious of Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP-pick since last year.  My nightmare scenario is Biden steps down after wife declares him unfit to serve, Congress invokes the 25th, Harris becomes President, then she chooses Hillary as her VP.  A fkn nightmare for our republic.
Just like in the House neither the Speaker or the president pro tempore has to actually be a member of Congress. In this situation the senate dems could choose Biden to be the pro tempore on January 3rd and then he would become president on January 21st when trump term ended.
What‚Äôs at stake this Nov is the future of America... as we know it. If Biden is elected, you can kiss everything goodbye üëãüèª
I'm no Biden fan but I don't think this is true. His polling lead is wider.
what else can we do, stay with orange man who is closer to a psychotic break than Kanye? It's so disgusting that's it's come down to this situation of choosing the lesser of both evils but we can surely make Biden the president who also doesn't get reelected.
And some want to vote for Biden so he can kiss Xi‚Äôs arse like did Putin !
Wow! So soon! A plan? House hearing finds US no closer to plan as coronavirus is 'raging out of control' ‚Äì live
We know that along with Biden, she‚Äôs Cuba‚Äôs choice.

The future......biden America.
You are wrong, the Castro stuff has PLENTY of teeth here in Florida. Trump has been running ads accusing Democrats of being "socialists" for weeks on Hispanic media, and it ABSOLUTELY moves the needle here. This would be a very bad choice for Biden if he wants to win Florida.
That‚Äôs kinda fair but I think the primary process turned out to be important and useful. Biden got better as it went on and Democratic bench got stronger.
we got some former candidates raising money for Biden via ‚Äúgrassroots movements‚Äù and some just sucking cash out of Super PACs lmfaooooooooo like I cannot take the hypocrisy and headassery I‚Äôm seeing
Republicans are planning a mass attack against Biden using information from pro-Russian agents
I hate that we‚Äôve resorted to a 2nd primary- except none of us get a vote. I sincerely believe Biden knew who he was going to pick a long time ago &amp; this whole thing has been an attempt to amplify multiple voices. It was working that way until recently. Now it‚Äôs needlessly ugly.
hearing people talk highly about Biden and obama is so cringeyüòñ
Joe Biden trying to win black votes
I went ahead &amp; ordered a Biden/Warren 2020 t-shirt today. If she isn't selected, I'll have a T-shirt; if she is selected, the country will have a brilliant &amp; amazing VP next year.
with all of the actual points you could make against Trump you chose misinformation claiming he denied the virus existed yet it was Biden who called Trump a racist when he banned travel from China early in the Pandemic  but at least you are correct on one account- we won't forget
The Biden campaign should be concerned about the secret $400,000 settlement  office paid to settle 'gender harassment' claims against a top aide named Larry Wallace.
Trump and Biden are pretty equal on their terrible policies so yeah a vote for biden is a vote for trumps policies and a vote for trump is a vote for bidens policies

Dodd &amp; Rendell are seen as easy targets. Would you honestly still be making this accusation of 'disgraceful deep misogyny,' though, if the old white man most worried that Harris is 'too ambitious' (but not Bass, Demings, Duckworth, or Rice) is...Joe Biden?
I think the decision is already made but the announcement was pushed back due to the John Lewis death and funeral. It would‚Äôve been in bad taste to make a such positive announcement during a week of public mourning. DT likes to do things like that, not Joe Biden.

Exactly. I think most of us are not as excited with Biden himself.   The vote now is against Trump. We need to move on.
I think this can be like when McCain was with Palin.  She contributed tremendously to his loss.  I think Biden has to be smart but at this point we should all be so excited for Biden that it should not matter, yet here we are. Unexcited.

Here are five reasons why the Democrats and Joe Biden should be deeply concerned about Black Voter turnout this coming November.

I was talking Biden. But I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs terribly happy with Trump either. Collapsed his bonds market. Had real issues with his economy due to denial of dollars.
After 47 years in Washington you think Biden now knows how to fix America.  Yes you are a fool. He's been problem.
‚ÄúWhen Biden told reporters...he would choose a running mate in the first week of August, two aides told CNN that the timing of an announcement was more likely to be pushed back until the week of August 10. But Biden's advisers gave him a deadline of next week to make up his mind‚Äù
I've been telling people for months that I intend to write in Bernie, part because he got robbed and to piss off anyone bothered by that. I can be reasonable, but Biden has done absolutely nothing to earn my vote I don't care how bad orange man is
Education :)
Looks like Curbelo won by a little less than 12 in 2016. I get the point, and it‚Äôs not safe D. That said, it went D in 2018 despite lower margins on top ticket races. If Biden wins by 18-20, will ticket splitting save CG?
It sounds good for Biden so I believe this one
Black people have been getting used politically for years by Dems to our detriment. That continues this election year. Democracts have put up the worse candidate for issues of impact to Black people. If you don‚Äôt believe me look at Joe Biden‚Äôs draconian record on black issues.

Joe Biden is apparently up 10% points in Florida... a state where he has zero visible support... meanwhile everywhere you go there are Trump flags, signs, and bumper stickers.  Ok.
if you don‚Äôt address these two issues you won‚Äôt win the election 1. How to pay your rent/mortgage specially if you loose your work to COVID19 2. Food on the table anything else will end backfiring and Biden doesn‚Äôt even need to speak
Biden and Trump aren‚Äôt the only two people running for office. There are other candidates with great ideas and motivation to help this country
. organized &amp; participated in Communist brigades that brutally assisted the Castro regime in repressing dissidents corralled in #Cuba's forced labor camps.  Joe Biden's VP pick is a brutal Communist who enjoyed repressing the Cuban people!

Good one and true! Strawman Biden is owned by Xi
Wait until Biden steps down, she becomes President AND then she selects Hillary Clinton as her VP.  Will be a freaking nightmare.
Biden seems pretty committed to having a woman of color as his VP. It would be great if he chose Warren, but I'm not optimistic.

Joe Biden believed in segregation btw
Weekend at Bernies ,tell your boss Biden its ok to step down now thank him for his service for us !!!!
I have absolutely zero doubts Trump will be re-elected and we'll retake the House on his coattails. 2/3rds of Biden voters don't even like Biden, they just hate Trump. We saw how THAT worked out for Romney in 2012.
So don‚Äôt go guilting people for not voting because the system is broken and it‚Äôs absolutely idiotic to think people should vote for the lesser of two evils and see that as ‚Äúprogress.‚Äù The only reason why Biden isn‚Äôt seen as negative as Trump is because his mind is so fried
What is it that Biden provides that Trump doesn‚Äôt? Both are against UBI Healthcare for all, ending foreign occupation, Free education, etc. there isn‚Äôt a single policy that Biden supports that I‚Äôm in favor for. Tired of neoliberals thinking people have to settle.
The guy who supported Pete Buttigieg and now supports Biden says Elon Musk is ‚Äúbad at politics‚Äù lmao.
Guilting people using a mans death into voting for someone who isn‚Äôt any different than Trump ideologically speaking is disgusting. Name one thing that Biden is against that Trump isn‚Äôt either. It‚Äôs pointless to vote and to settle on candidates that are simply corrupt bureaucrats

Also, being that a lot of trump followers disregard the virus/doesn‚Äôt care about masks, I feel like they would have the advantage going to the polls... unless the numbers are right and Biden is in the lead, then it would make more sense for trump to all of a sudden care.
It is true that between Biden and the orange clown the obvious choice is Biden no argument there, but failing to see that Joe Biden is not 100% there...and he cannot even say a coherent thought or phrase really is mind boggling!!
Brain Dead Biden
3) And the more energized base.  Cancellation isn't compelling. It's repulsive.  And Biden's base consists of nothing more than the old guard of party bosses, the donor class and old media. In short, Hillary's base. How well did that work out?
1) Isn't funny? The very same pundits, corporate media outlets and their pollsters - none of whom saw the Trump phenomenon triumphing - are claiming Biden has it in the bag.  They apparently never got the memo about the 2016 election: politics isn't like money ball.

I think it's great that folks from outside of this country would vote for him. If eligible, Trump could run and win the presidency both here in the US and in Russia. Bet Biden can't say the same.

Wait if Biden got anywhere close to a new deal, that would be less desirable than the status quo? I respect everyone's opinion and embrace reasoned debate. You and I will not find common ground on this issue but I very much respect your opinion.
Yes i do but I'm just saying, having biden would be the worse choive to have as president. No police, segregation may make a comeback, far more blacks in jail. You can say what you want about trump but before covid or in this the chinese virus, he was doing great
Honestly, if you're looking for a president that's willing to do more for blacks, I'd recommend trumps since biden wants to imprision/incarcerate more blacks and not to mention that he's a segregationist

I'll explain what is happening here.  No one gives a damn about Biden. No one likes Biden. No one is excited about Biden. 2/3 of the Biden vote in a recent poll were voting AGAINST Trump, not FOR Biden. 90% of Trump voters were voting FOR Trump.  If that hold, Biden loses YUGE.

F**k off Bernout. Don‚Äôt slide in here with that nonsense. Biden is in excellent health. Bernie Sanders will never be President.
The dirty secret of "fraud-by-mail" is this - Democrats know their base will not turn out for Biden, so they plan to "harvest" those stay-at-home voters with mail-in's.  Democrats are losing, they know they are losing and they will do ANYTHING, including cheat to avoid that.
Bernie is not the nominee because 18-30 year old voters had record low turnout in the primaries, in some cases down by 50% or more from 2016.  If Bernie himself could get only half the 18-30 turnout Hillary got, what hope does old white guy Biden have?
How is it Trump voters have the highest enthusiasm ever recorded and Trump's approval among Republicans is a record 96% while Biden is losing the black vote and young vote as never before with Bernie voters threatening to stay home, yet Biden leads by 14?  Impossible math.
We have heard many former leaders from the Bernie Movement claiming they have no intention of voting for Biden.  This represents as much as 1/3 of the Democrat base potentially staying home or voting Trump out of protest of the DNC.  Why do you think they want fraud-by-mail?
I don't know about Democrats, but Republicans are PISSED and ready to vote in their greatest numbers ever.  Proof?  Turnout for President Trump in primaries has SHATTERED all prior records for incumbents. Not merely exceeded, SHATTERED.  Meanwhile there is ZERO Biden enthusiasm.

This pile on is a clear indication that ‚Å¶ is leading the VP field by a mile.  Obama supporters had reservations about Joe Biden in 2008 after he made a major verbal gaffe about his future running mate.  That still worked out...
"The..nominee wants to pick someone..like him (or at least the way he saw himself as VP): loyal, trusted, experienced, apolitical, someone with whom he will bond ... if Biden‚Äôs demand for loyalty is paramount, several top Dems questioned whether Harris would be the right choice."

I will vote blue, more against Trump than for the Dem party frankly. I think it is my civil duty although Biden is not a candidate motivating the masses and many Republicans just can‚Äôt make the jump.  I am a moderate but those who are clearly Republican are struggling to choose.
Biggest concern with Harris from Biden‚Äôs perspective imo isn‚Äôt the debate moment, but the pieces on how dysfunctional her campaign was. It was rife with internal drama &amp; the staff leaked like a faucet.   The culture of the campaign is tea leaves for the culture while in office.
REMINDER: Donald Trump started off his career by blocking Black people from living in his buildings. He is a racist.   Please talk to your friends instead about how Joe Biden would defend fair housing and work to root out discrimination.

Who thinks Trump will never debate Joe Biden?
ltbh thats dumb bc she‚Äôll literally be in the room learning how to be president and as vp she would have to be prepared to take that on if biden couldnt work or died. seems like a good and helpful concept lmao.
The noticeably degrading mental state of Biden makes one wonder if the Democrats are planning to remove him from office, if elected, to replace him with his Vice President. There were never a time when choosing the right VP was so important. #Election2020
oh absolutely, biden is infinitely better, but saying that dems will fix anything is a lie. they happily assisted the dissolving of rights after 9/11, the dissolution of labor processions and living standards. the reason fascists can exist is because both major parties permit it

I‚Äôve been suspicious of Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP-pick since last year.  My nightmare scenario is Biden steps down after wife declares him unfit to serve, Congress invokes the 25th, Harris becomes President, then she chooses Hillary as her VP.  A fkn nightmare for our republic.
Just like in the House neither the Speaker or the president pro tempore has to actually be a member of Congress. In this situation the senate dems could choose Biden to be the pro tempore on January 3rd and then he would become president on January 21st when trump term ended.
I'm no Biden fan but I don't think this is true. His polling lead is wider.
what else can we do, stay with orange man who is closer to a psychotic break than Kanye? It's so disgusting that's it's come down to this situation of choosing the lesser of both evils but we can surely make Biden the president who also doesn't get reelected.

I was talking Biden. But I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs terribly happy with Trump either. Collapsed his bonds market. Had real issues with his economy due to denial of dollars.
After 47 years in Washington you think Biden now knows how to fix America.  Yes you are a fool. He's been problem.
I've been telling people for months that I intend to write in Bernie, part because he got robbed and to piss off anyone bothered by that. I can be reasonable, but Biden has done absolutely nothing to earn my vote I don't care how bad orange man is
Looks like Curbelo won by a little less than 12 in 2016. I get the point, and it‚Äôs not safe D. That said, it went D in 2018 despite lower margins on top ticket races. If Biden wins by 18-20, will ticket splitting save CG?
It sounds good for Biden so I believe this one
Black people have been getting used politically for years by Dems to our detriment. That continues this election year. Democracts have put up the worse candidate for issues of impact to Black people. If you don‚Äôt believe me look at Joe Biden‚Äôs draconian record on black issues.

It was an innocent post of concern. You‚Äôre the person turning it into more. Which is quite bizarre.   Why are you even here? You don‚Äôt follow me since I said I was voting Biden. Move along.
Yeah honestly we can flip the coin either way I don‚Äôt see a lot of patriots standing down with Biden as president and I see the left when trump wins I can see Civil unrest ! Scary times

Joe Biden is apparently up 10% points in Florida... a state where he has zero visible support... meanwhile everywhere you go there are Trump flags, signs, and bumper stickers.  Ok.
if you don‚Äôt address these two issues you won‚Äôt win the election 1. How to pay your rent/mortgage specially if you loose your work to COVID19 2. Food on the table anything else will end backfiring and Biden doesn‚Äôt even need to speak
. organized &amp; participated in Communist brigades that brutally assisted the Castro regime in repressing dissidents corralled in #Cuba's forced labor camps.  Joe Biden's VP pick is a brutal Communist who enjoyed repressing the Cuban people!

Biden can't pick Karen Bass if he wants to win Florida.
The article is locked and I haven‚Äôt seen the polls. His Covid response aside, isn‚Äôt a huge question how much of a win Biden takes in this District? I know 2018 was closer than 2016 for the R, but 2016 HRC won by 16, can‚Äôt see Trump improving on that. Plus DMC beat Curbelo
We see you Biden üëÄ
We r getting non stop Trump scare ads full of lies saying Biden will defund 911 in #MiamiDade showing old lady being killed by an intruder as she gets no help from 911- laughable but we have some stupid ppl here     run a truthful psa

AMERICA VOTED THRU THE CIVIL WAR! VOTING BLUE (Back To Normal) IS WHY AMERICA IS PROTESTINGüíØAFTER JOE BIDEN, PROGRESSIVES DOWN THE BALLOT
Good one and true! Strawman Biden is owned by Xi
Wait until Biden steps down, she becomes President AND then she selects Hillary Clinton as her VP.  Will be a freaking nightmare.
Biden seems pretty committed to having a woman of color as his VP. It would be great if he chose Warren, but I'm not optimistic.
The edited video ads of a ‚Äúsenile‚Äù Joe Biden are hilariousü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£   your cult leader Trump has the communication skills of a preschooler not to mention he‚Äôs a liar and a cheat. He will go down as the most corrupt president of our times
Not as many times as Joe Biden has bent his knee to them... that is for sure...
Joe Biden believed in segregation btw
I have absolutely zero doubts Trump will be re-elected and we'll retake the House on his coattails. 2/3rds of Biden voters don't even like Biden, they just hate Trump. We saw how THAT worked out for Romney in 2012.
So don‚Äôt go guilting people for not voting because the system is broken and it‚Äôs absolutely idiotic to think people should vote for the lesser of two evils and see that as ‚Äúprogress.‚Äù The only reason why Biden isn‚Äôt seen as negative as Trump is because his mind is so fried
What is it that Biden provides that Trump doesn‚Äôt? Both are against UBI Healthcare for all, ending foreign occupation, Free education, etc. there isn‚Äôt a single policy that Biden supports that I‚Äôm in favor for. Tired of neoliberals thinking people have to settle.
The guy who supported Pete Buttigieg and now supports Biden says Elon Musk is ‚Äúbad at politics‚Äù lmao.
Guilting people using a mans death into voting for someone who isn‚Äôt any different than Trump ideologically speaking is disgusting. Name one thing that Biden is against that Trump isn‚Äôt either. It‚Äôs pointless to vote and to settle on candidates that are simply corrupt bureaucrats
I liked Biden on this until I read it says ‚Äúcare jobs‚Äù-‚Äúprimarily women‚Äù???  What about men in care jobs???

You are a Democrat puppet. Notice this guy says he is running for President, but only attacks the Republican Presidentü§î. I hope it backfires and takes votes away from  Sleepy Joe Biden
And the next person who will serve as President (Biden) can reverse it, so your Great Leader van enjoy the next several months
We don‚Äôt worry about them now because this isn‚Äôt Joe Biden
Biden 2020 clean the trump swamp
What can we expect from a racist.  Also, this is a rule change and guess what, Biden can adjust it as well.  This is a political tactic if I ever saw one
Just make sure all our Bernie Bros Vote for Biden
Never has a President been so loved by at least 150,000,000 people Dems can‚Äôt win with brain dead biden
Can somebody tell me if its true that George W Bush is trying to turn Texas blue and that he is voting Biden
Also, being that a lot of trump followers disregard the virus/doesn‚Äôt care about masks, I feel like they would have the advantage going to the polls... unless the numbers are right and Biden is in the lead, then it would make more sense for trump to all of a sudden care.
It is true that between Biden and the orange clown the obvious choice is Biden no argument there, but failing to see that Joe Biden is not 100% there...and he cannot even say a coherent thought or phrase really is mind boggling!!
3) And the more energized base.  Cancellation isn't compelling. It's repulsive.  And Biden's base consists of nothing more than the old guard of party bosses, the donor class and old media. In short, Hillary's base. How well did that work out?
1) Isn't funny? The very same pundits, corporate media outlets and their pollsters - none of whom saw the Trump phenomenon triumphing - are claiming Biden has it in the bag.  They apparently never got the memo about the 2016 election: politics isn't like money ball.
At least Biden has a brain and empathy and he cares about the country. He doesn‚Äôt want to politically divide the country , or be racist like you, or to promotpeople to get sick and not wear masks and promoting fraud in all your 20,000 lies. You are owned by Putin!  You will lose!
He will! Biden 2020
He‚Äôs actually defending The Constitution against The Deep State that has been in control for decades of both parties, but have specifically destroyed my beloved Democratic Party to a point that is unrecognizable and Obama/Biden/Hillary has been major enablers

Joe Biden thinks he is running for the senate and he was never a quality human. Explain how someone in a government job for 50 years becomes wealthy. He embarrasses the country every time he speaks.
THEY NEVER THOUGHT HILLARY WOULD LOSE..... FUTURE PREDICTION TRUMP WILL WIN IN A LANDSLIDE.....BIDEN WON'T BE ON THE BALLOT BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL REPLACE BIDEN.....WHO WILL REPLACE BIDEN???
Are u literally the last person on earth to believe the Putin conspiracy theory? You prob believe the impeachment evidence but not the quid pro quo that Biden and Son were mixed up in with Ukraine. And u must also believe Clinton when he perjured himself. U will believe anything!
REMEMBER THE WORLD TOLD YOU ALL.....TRUMP WILL NEVER BECOME PRESIDENT.....YOU BEEN LIED TO......FULL CIRCLE BIDEN POLLS LMFAO CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHO BECOMES PRESIDENT....YOUR FUTURE HAS ALREADY BEEN PREDICTED üëáüëáüëá
Trump Powerful? His power has limits. He can‚Äôt stop the press from lying. Remember the press brought down Nixon, covered for Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Biden.   The media reports what they want to report. Trump has done good but we rarely hear about it from the media!
WATCH DEMOCRATIC PARTY REMOVE BIDEN FOR SOMEONE ELSE.....WILL WE SEE A TRUMP AND BIDEN DEBATE??? WILL THIS BE THE 1ST TIME IN HISTORY, AMERICA HAS NO PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE'S???
NOTHING I HAVEN'T SEEN ALREADY.....WHERE IS BIDEN??? YOU HAVE NO CLUE DO YOU???
The person Joe Biden picks should be chosen BY JOE BIDEN! It has to be someone HE FEELS COMFORTABLE WORKING WITH. It is his decision and his alone! I'm sick of hearing people like JOY REID bullying him into picking a black woman simply because of her race!
The Democratic Party is immoral. Vote for Biden if you want, but at least have the decency to be ashamed about it.
look I never Believe in Poll Numbers they are always Wrong, Biden is a idiot, AOC is a stupid young kid who knows no better, The Muslim ladies on Congress should have never been in Congress,
Right!!! Biden is creepy AF!!
Feinstein: Letting Americans sue China over coronavirus response would be 'huge mistake'  #FoxNews  For her and Biden's big interest in China $$$
Biden and Dems would disband Customs and Border Patrol, if given the chance. That alone is enough to make a sane person vote for Trump in 2020!
Biden will be withdrawing soon due to real mental issues that is if he isn‚Äôt forced to withdraw for the Burisma fiasco he did with his boy! U know, the real quid pro quo billion $ deal! It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt see who actually cares for our country. I hope yr ready for 4 more years!
It‚Äôs always partisan politics!  There was nothing serious about that. Trump did nothing wrong.  It was obvious. The Dems were grandstanding.   It was such a ‚Äúsolemn moment‚Äù wink wink!   I‚Äôm guessing u saw all that REAL evidence against Biden  Son?  The billion $ quid pro quo?
WILL THIS BE THE 1ST TIME IN HISTORY, THERE WILL BE NO PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE'S??? NO WAY; WE THE PEOPLE HAVE TO SEE TRUMP AND BIDEN HAVE A DEBATE..... HISTORY IN THE MAKING üëá
WHERE IS BIDEN? WHY IS OBAMA HAVING A RALLY AT A FUNERAL? WHO IS IN CONTROL? WHO REALLY IS IN CONTROL? #PAIN  THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN THEY WOULD NOT FEEL SAFE TO WALK THE STREETS #FEAR
No no no no no! Because of Biden‚Äôs age, we CAN‚ÄôT have a VP that old.  I have other reasons as well,  but that is my main reason.  I am for  as VP.
This is Biden doing his best to look like Putin!
It‚Äôs called throwing as much mud as possible at Trump and hoping any thing will stick! The mud doesn‚Äôt even have to be true just as long as it‚Äôs salacious and can convince a  biased media to run with a false narrative! During the campaign Trump will talk about Biden-China/Burisma
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president   Condolence Rice ia the most experienced, qualified, black (no offensive but a truth) woman and idoneous VP
Kamala Harris selected as VP, will be the worse choice, that Biden could do, it would signal that those whom doubt his mind clear condition, are right and correctly doubt his qualification.  The most idoneous ticket reflecting smart and sound selection, would be Condolence Rice.
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
I‚Äôm Nervous For Biden‚Äôs Health. I Predict A Plot Involving Biden‚Äôs Health To Redirect The DNC Campaign. Lord Knows Epstein Didn‚Äôt Make it... Democrats Are Too Desparate To Win. I Hope I‚Äôm Wrong For Biden‚Äôs Sake.
If Biden wins the popular vote by 9% there's no way he's losing the electoral college, Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1%, if she won by 3% she'd be president
No. He lost due to a bad campaign and a poor candidacy.  Trying to be what the Party wanted - and not himself.  It never should have been close.  But it was.  Just like with Hillary (and with Biden).
It's worse if Biden wins because his VP will be the nominee in 2024. The DNC won't even have a pretend primary like in 2016 &amp; 2020. The Democratic nominee will be Biden's VP; no chance of a progressive candidate unless we have a 3rd party up and running.
Better than Joe Biden and your Shit Show.
He didn't lose it.  He quit.  Biden didn't win it.
In this universe - Joe Biden is a LOSING proposition.
He has done more for the Democratic Party this year than Biden has, unfortunately.  Bernie was a fool to try and play in the party game.
I'm not mad at Biden.  I don't like Biden.
I don't think - I KNOW that contrary to their constitutional role - in practice - the parties operate by having the Presidents propose policies.  What do you think Biden and the Democrats have been proposing?  And you don't need to overcome a filibuster to PROPOSE legislation.
They have not progressed under one party.  Both parties are meant to keep them FROM progressing.  Sorry Biden is no "winner."
1) I am not voting for Trump; 2) You are likely going to lose to Trump; 3) the ACA was a bailout for Insurance Companies and kept health care DEPENDENT on Insurance.  There is no field, this is no game.  Biden is on the other side.
Joe Biden and the Democrats are BAD.
It's not "sour grapes." I OPPOSE the Democratic Party and Joe Biden.
No I am not supporting Trump. How hard is that to understand. I support NEITHER Trump nor Biden.  Get it - neither.  Neither is promoting a progressive agenda.  Learn how we got into this mess in the first place (playing the two party game).
I'm not voting for Trump.  Or Biden.
Biden is running as a Republican.  For Republican votes.
Biden isn't a Progressive.  So voting for Biden is not what Progressives do.

And Biden‚Äôs been doing it right for 50-years?
So true. I don't believe any of the COVID19 numbers he reports. I am voting for Biden!

No I haven't seen any Biden signs but lots of primary signs people running for clerk of courts, judges, etc. I have seen Trump signs in Polk county but have not seen them in Osceola or orange county.
Yes, yes, yes. I have neighbors who voted for Trump in '16 but will not vote for him this year! They are all voting Biden. They are all long-time Republicans over 65. #TrumpIsLosing
I mean honestly this is the first time I think Biden will win Florida. But I def think it will be close.
It is a strong possibility that Trump may very well lose. But I‚Äôm 99.9% certain it won‚Äôt be a 1980 landslide for Biden
PUPPET BIDEN, MUST FOLLOW THE 16 YEAR PLAN TO DESTROY AMERICA..... SAYS THE PUPPET MASTERS....
Polling is basically voodoo/astrology these days. It‚Äôs all about fundamentals. If a poll showed Trump and Biden tied in NJ, we‚Äôd rightly wipe our asses with it
Don‚Äôt Vote Biden. That‚Äôll literally be the end of everything as we know it. We can work it out with Trump in office. This is only in parts of the United States
If Biden does win Florida, be within 3 points, that‚Äôs just how the state works. You can‚Äôt believe polls

Joe Biden can't pass one and you know it. You have no common sense which is why you are butt hurt by Trump. Joe Biden just shook his head and maybe said like a few words. Obama isn't running for president he needs to shut his mouth stop spoon feeding Biden because he is using
You want to see a bad memory, just wait if Biden gets elected. That empty vessel will lead us straight to hell. The dems already have us half way there!

Right . Trump can actually think for himself and not a puppet like Biden would be
Threaten to suspend it and then see how fast this mail in voting stops. This corona is serious stuff. The Dumbacrats say you don‚Äôt take it seriously and don‚Äôt do enough . Biden is stuck in his basement. You can‚Äôt do rallies and cancelled the RNC. Suspend the election. !!!!
I‚Äôm not against NATO, but the other countries have to meet their obligations, or by their actions they are saying they don‚Äôt care about NATO. Reagan comparisons aren‚Äôt valid as the USSR doesn‚Äôt exist and no one sees that China is that new threat yet. Even ppl like Biden

Your placard insinuated that Biden's supporters are killing cops, destroying property, looting, etc. I didn't put those words in your mouth, you posted them. Don't post statements like that if you don't mean it. Again I assume you aren't in favor of cops shooting unarmed people.

Joe Biden would need a handler to help him find the helicopter and navigate the stairs.

Who knows gregg. Bumbling Biden doesn‚Äôt realize he even said that. You can see them already setting this thing up for claims of voter suppression . They call someone having to show a picture ID to vote , a form of voter suppression. Yep; suppression of an illegal vote!!!
He really is sleepy joe...so boring to watch. It‚Äôs like a nascar race; people go to see the wrecks. I just watch bumbling Biden to catch the next gaff ...!!!
You know what?.. I‚Äôm not even gonna debate this, I‚Äôm glad you came around and decided to vote for biden!

Wait.  What happened to the ‚Äúsummer of love‚Äù? How do people with a mental IQ of 50 get elected?  How is a sub zero IQ man Biden the Democratic nominee? Where are the real democrats? Cowering in the corner with the GOP? If we don‚Äôt fight we lose America.Equation: DEM=GOP.  No dif.
Nadler and Swalwell are tied for this honor, but Biden definitely has them both beat !

We will in Florida. Florida for Biden
Her voice is an important voice, but I don't know anything about her.
Biden?   jumped all over your Veep announcement
Ok. I believe Trump mishandled it early on just like most of the world but when he did ban flights from China and later Europe he was called a xenophobe by Biden.... calling him a racist for trying to shut down incoming flights. A lot more should have been done... no doubt...
Biden must win.
this is so pathetic to answer presubmitted questions by pre approved reporters. This is what North Korea and communist China do.  Biden is so feeble he cannot do a real press event with real questions without a teleprompter.  I'm embarrassed for you.
Ok... Biden believes whatever they tell him to believe. Gun sales are going through the roof. There are almost as many democrats buying them as republicans. I hate the two party system. I feel they are holding us hostage. Nobody feels safe right now.
... I‚Äôve been supporting Biden since bernie endorsed him, glad you eventually came around, but it‚Äôs a little ridiculous that it took trump going full gestapo for KYLE to even consider voting for him...
What is the Democrats plan by insinuating Trump will not leave office ifdefeated?  Multiple lawsuits when Biden loses?  They will be still contesting 2016 and the 2020 elections forever?
....so he hasn‚Äôt always been in favor of Biden... imo it‚Äôs pretty sad that it took trump to openly show people like Kyle that he‚Äôs a fascist, it took fucking lay after park to change him mind smh
Florida for Biden
If you tell republicans Covid is a hoax, they will believe you, no evidence. If you tell republicans Biden wants to defund the police, they will believe you, again, no evidence. Independent thinking is not a strong republican trait and they are often exploited as a result.
Wait is he voting for biden now?
I find Wallace to be very fair and a great interviewer. He goes after the questions and the story, not favoritism. He looks for holes in the story regardless of which side of the isle it is coming from.  That showcases great weakness and trouble for Biden‚Äôs messaging.
WAYNE ROOT: BIDEN = ‚ÄúBIGGEST IDIOT DEMOCRATS EVER NOMINATED‚Äù
Look I get it, if Biden wins with a coalition with a lot of moderate support and some anti trump Republicans you're worried that you'll get left behind. I get it. But I feel like that's a less important issue that what's actually happening right now, which is causing death
Trump only started to care about the coronavirus in the last 2 weeks bc it's spreading in states he views as important to his reelection. And trump has built his entire persona on racial fears of white America. Like yeah Biden has issues, but if you think some bad bills=trump
Meanwhile trump won't even go there at all. But the people that won't bite or write in Bernie or some shit will keep saying there is no difference between Biden and Trump
Right now you see what a true President does when he respects our heroes. Biden is paying his respects for John Lewis

If Biden has solutions, why in 40 plus years did he keep the solutions to himself and not fix the problems in the 70, 80, 90, 2000+?  Why has no journalist asked him the ?
Americans definitely need to be worried if we elect Biden
Ah, no...but in your mind Biden, you can be the President with Hillary I her fake Oval Office

Come on Tapper, don't be a hater. Wallace's interview of trump was excellent. And, he was definitely tough on trump. I support Biden so don't think I'm one of those Fox News loving n..s. Wallace holds people accountable and doesn't let them get away with double talk. Always has.
Pelosi and Biden both suffer from Dementia !

Joe Biden will reform the police. Not de-fund them.  Spread the word.
As a candidate Biden is a normal human being, and shows humane qualities like empathy. Trump, in terms of personal qualities, is clearly one of the worst human beings in America.   So a friend said, 'But the Democrats are just as bad'
.....they try to put her in good favor grouping her comments with Obama and John Kerry. Don‚Äôt be fooled by her. Poor Biden doesn‚Äôt know which way is up and the socialists will lead him to her and others like her (AOC-the frauds not squad)
Saw a bumper sticker for Biden yesterday &amp; realized I can't safely put a Trump sticker on my car or wear my Trump 2020 hat because the left are violent and out of control. Pretty sad state of affairs when we have to live in fear of the opposing political party.

Look, I'll say it, Biden is not my first choice for President, but I intend to vote for him.  Another 4 years of trump would be a disaster. We will barely survive this term. It's going to take years to undo the damage trump has done both domestically and globally.

I'm a liberal and I DON'T WANT HIM TO QUIT! I want to run his ass out of office by voting for Biden. I want him to be humiliated beyond humiliation. I want him to lick his wounds from defeat until he has ulcers on his lying tongue!
It only matters if he votes for Biden and gets others to do the same.  A statement is just the first step.
Lol. Thank you for the compliment. For the record, I am fairly non-partisan. I loathe Biden too.
Hey  I've heard Joe Biden being referred to as a "puppet" many times. Maybe your father should consider changing his nickname from "Sleepy Joe" to "Puppet Joe". God bless the Trump Train!!

Yep, exactly. Biden‚Äôs financial support only comes from the fact that he‚Äôs corrupt as hell.

I never expected to see politicians just say screw it.. destroy what ever you want.  I wish I know the end game they are hoping for but even if Biden wins, someone will have to put a stop to this or citizens will and even Democrats can't allow that.  It's bigger than we think

no way trump will debate Biden..NFW.....he's a moron...unteachable and lacks self control...Joe will destroy him simply by breathing and looking at him like the fool he is....
Can Donald Trump repeat Putin, Bounty, Taliban, American Soldiers, without fumbling? When is able to stand before the American people and repeat those words then you may come back and comment on Joe Biden's gaffes.
Unfortunately, it is no longer "we the people" it is 'we the elite'. Biden was their choice, made possible by power alliances with major media &amp; others forming a narrative of relative elect-ability, &amp; people bought into this bc that's the majority of what was given to them.
Maybe the democratic party should start acting like the democratic party and not a center-right party?  Why does Joe Biden object to:  Banning fracking? Student debt forgiveness? Medicare for all? Universal Basic Income? Defunding police (he wants to increase funding)?

No it's not about ego like it is with the big orange idiot. I like Biden and will vote for him. But I don't need to follow him to keep up to date. I check his page often. I never check Trump page.
No just like most politicians. If they don't follow back do they really care. I have had a few follow me. But you don't have to follow Biden to see his tweets.

Many people already take advantage of what the government allows: medicaid, social security, FEMA, and you feel that is not "socialism." It is! Joe Biden is NOT  a socialist, not does he promote socialism. Learn your facts before making ourself foolish.
Trump and his liars have destroyed most of our democracy. We cannot afford another 4 years for surely the will totally destroy our democracy. On November 3rd, let's detour country back on the road restoring the soul of the nation. Joe Biden 2020.

If Biden were to take and pass the test, which I‚Äôm sure he would, I doubt he would brag about it. It‚Äôs funny because Trump thinks it‚Äôs an accomplishment. For him it probably is his biggest accomplishment, so maybe we should say congrats.
You can call the guy a lot of things, and you do, but Trump definitely does not have dementia. Biden's memory and recall are gone.
Why are property taxes being used to pay for a public school education that is just programming a Lectist agenda into our children? Biden will want us to be taxed to pay for free college as well to ensure that everyone has a higher education in that programming.
Yeah but they can blame it on Biden
So desperate and sooo scared of Joe Biden.
I live in a pretty mixed area.  About equal Republicans and Democrats.  The adult democrats (people over 35) openly admit that they think Biden is suffering from dementia.  Also this guy and his 'Shooting up bleach' and  letting him get away with it is disgusting.
Of course she would. Biden better not choose this corrupt politician to be his VP
