I definitely have seen that and become aware over the last few years. But I'm also a major empath, so I have had difficulty breaking from the fact that marginalized people's need to have trump gone. He is bad for a lot of people, and to not vote for Biden is extremely privileged.
The right to vote for either Trump or Biden seems like a false flag--two parties, delegates and no convention with platform participation.
If this is the type of thinking that the GOP have, they shouldn't be allowed to be involved in politics. If you think that Biden is actually left of center you are an imbecile.

Trump's school re-opening will be just as disastrous as his economic re-opening.  We are in for some bad times before Biden takes office in January.  It now feels like July 1932.

Biden is having a conversation about opening schools. trump fu*ked the virus response up so badly that it isn't safe for kids, teachers or staff.  But the more Americans that die, the happier Putin is with trump and the gop, right?

The Senate GOP knows that Trump is toast and they're getting off to an early start in sabotaging the Biden presidency.

This is literally all Biden needs to mention to win the election  33%. Good Lord, the idiocy.
I would like him to try it honestly. If Bernie was the nominee the military brass might have shrugged and let him do it. But I just can‚Äôt fathom that they wouldn‚Äôt prefer an imperialist with a long track record like Biden over this shit.

You should go watch Biden on the Daily Show.  I really liked what he said about it.  To many people don‚Äôt realize tons of these massive departments work under a surplus annually, again, they aren‚Äôt hurting for money.
And a better funded police department does not mean a better department.  Do you see the surplus of money these departments already get? And Biden has already pledged I think it was $300 million to the COPS Program. They aren‚Äôt hurting for cash.

It only makes sense that 2020 would be the worst year in a LONG time. The conclusion of 4 years with a reality TV show host as president. 2020 shows the accumulation of his mistakes. 2021, Biden will turn it around.

I don't think Biden would even last a full term if elected. I don't think the dnc even has plans for him lasting a full term.
I'm in an always red state so my lp vote wont mean anything for or against either side. I agree Biden is worse than Trump but even if me voting for Trump could possibly help him i still couldnt bring myself to do it.

I just watched your recent 538 chat with your team. Michelle Obama was suggested as a VP and the idea was laughed off. Why? It would mean a sure win for Biden. She would level Pence in a debate not to mention making life miserable for Trump. MichelleO#VP2020

If you are so worried about over/under performance in the polls, wouldn't you want the gap to be as wide as possible?   If Biden is +8 in the polls before election day, the poll would have had to be off by that much for Trump to win the state, which is historically rare.
I don't see your point. If suburban minorities overperform, that's a boost for Biden.  If Biden is successful at campaigning in the Midwest, it would mean he would win those states... if he's not successful at campaigning in those states, then he's going to lose anyway.

Getting to the polls is a lot harder for these folks than it is for the average rank-and-file voter. Hillary ignored these voters in 2016, thus she lost Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, etc. What's different about Biden &amp; his campaign that's gonna motivate them to go vote for him?
I disagree w/ Nina here actually.  Voting for Biden is like eating an ENTIRE bowl of shit while the people force-feeding you declare "c'mon it's not that shitty stop it with the purity tests" "it's not as shitty as the other bowl of shit!" "we'll convince it to be less shitty!"
This has to be the easiest campaign strategy ever in politics. Vote for Biden he's not Trump. Sorta reminds me of Eddie Murphy in The Distinguished Gentleman when he just ran a campaign on name recognition.
The Biden side is more pro-communism but it really doesn't matter overall. They both suck and I don't want either choice of shit steak or shit sandwich.

Biden sure sounded racist back in 1993 when he gave a speech. Biden is suffering dimentia and is a demoRat tool and a fool.

Biden is definitely the mannequin.  All of those around him are the driver in the HOV lane.  They are not voting for Biden, but rather against Trump.  He is an empty vessel into which are poured their free stuff wish lists because the masses are perceived to be mannequins too.
The myriad ways it's possible to affect voting and the outcome of an election is definitely a problem in America. If hackers can take one vote away from Biden and give it to Trump instead, it's the same as changing two votes.

Oh, yeah, no. I thought you meant a female VP ascending if Biden were no longer in office.   As far as the third win, I was just projecting that we could see three more female presidents in our lifetime if a female VP ascended.

Correct. I believe one of the reasons Trump and his team are pushing for an election night call is to confuse any sort of close race.  If Biden wins with massive margins in enough states to take the EC, it's difficult to make any (sustainable) argument about a rigged election.

I want to start the congratulatory texts early! I am excited to see the changes that President Biden has made in this country in his first 100 days. We are reclaiming the Nation that we felt was so fractured and lost these last 4 years, but hope has sprung eternal again
While voting for Biden is a vote for : Kamila Harris, Warren, Stacy Abrams. Therefore... Trump is still a better choice. Aside the fake news story
This is the saddest part of all of this. Biden clearly has dementia. If he is elected it will only hasten his decline. He should be at home, living as stress free as possible with his grandkids while he can still recognize them. What his handlers are doing to him is criminal.

It's all a lie. Biden never won. I cant accept that people are so woefully ignorant, so...I wont. The left is stronger than any of you believe. They wouldn't stand in front of federal forces with such bravery if it wasn't so. They stole our hope. I am so filled with rage.
Joe Biden hella scary
We do. But he stepped down so Biden could run.
You're right, at least if Biden wins.  The turd media and the rest of the left will stop pushing it and inflating the numbers. Biden will magically cure it one way or the other. By the way the whole world is spiking, not just the US. And libturd California is on fire with covid..
Like Biden has any say in who his VP will be.

Any day is a good day to cam for Trump‚Äôs resignation!Too bad there is not teeth to these days.Waiting for the election and then swearing in of Joe Biden is too long especially given Trump‚Äôs fickleness.

Frankly, most people don't understand what Communism is.  They just associated the term with bad and call it a day without attempting to understand what it is.  The idea that Biden is some kind of communist sympathizer is pretty laughable given his past record.

As stupid as you sound It‚Äôs still only one vote. But I guess you‚Äôre afraid that the 14 year old knows his parents love Trump so much that they have to High jack their vote because they‚Äôve been brainwashed by the Dems to cheat and help Biden win.
Sexism aside, Biden‚Äôs already said he intends to only serve one term. Shouldn‚Äôt they actively seek someone who wants to become POTUS so there‚Äôs a sense of continuity?
Need a reason to vote for Biden? How about: Joe Biden is an excellent judge of character.
Okay Dictator Donald! Smh! Biden already told us he would try to delay the election. Mail in voting and absentee are the same thing. He‚Äôs only saying this because it may produce the result he doesn‚Äôt like. Narcissists hate the possibility of losing! Only Congress can change dates

Women with personality flaws when dealing with Biden
More surrogate lies: Women are primary T donors, via Jr's mistress being paid a ton of bucks for her campaign work. Any proof? She's apparently not too good at her job since Ds are outraising Rs. Any proof that Biden will crush women for whom he has quite a good record?
My hope is that the GOP grows a set of balls after the election, and Congress has him removed.  Biden must crush him.
100% correct. Biden doesn‚Äôt know what city he‚Äôs in and can‚Äôt Complete a sentence. Harris is just a blowhard, literally and figuratively.
I live is a nice basic neighborhood, no golf course, but low income housing two blocks away, providing housing for at least a few people with physical disabilities and many elderly adults. My suburb is diverse and I am voting for Biden. #SuburbsForBiden
Joe Biden does but he forgot that he thinks that he has dementia.
Based on my (very limited) survey of rural political sentiment (campaign signs on farm property between here and Grand Island), Biden needs to step up his farm game.  Turns out, two suburban neighbors are Trump's, too (that I know of).  It's depressing, honestly.
No to Kamala Harris. She let innocent people rot in jail and did unethical prosecutions. She will be a disaster as VP especially since she'll run for President if she is elected Vice President with Biden on day 1. Susan Rice would be a much better VP.
A Biden Tulsi card might be the only way we can get trump out of office.
I‚Äôve havent seen a Biden sign since Obama‚Äôs name was above it .. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I mean, we all kind of thought Biden wasn't the candidate for the moment last year and the moment didn't agree. So... whatever. I'm actually higher on Harris than others are, but I get your concerns. There's little electoral consequence for 2020 but potentially large beyond that.
My hope is that she's still going to be very involved in the appointment process, particularly for Cabinet-level offices that are going to require Senate approval. I'd love her to be VP, but I just can't see Biden making that choice.
I think it's going to be Harris because I believe Biden's going to pick someone with a similar style to him and Warren would be too much of a clash. But I don't know that, because I know nothing.

We as a country are now a world wide disgrace. We have let this go too far. Trump must be defeated, Biden MUST remove all those Trump out into positions of power and influence, then Biden MUST push a platform of Medicare for all or resign.All progressive candidates need to win.

Regarding the VP pick, I've always been politically active and worked for the Obama campaign. When he picked Biden as a running mate, you could see that they respected each other and that "it was the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
Oh yes. Biden is EXACTLY the same as Trump, for example.  Do you see how crazy your logic is?

Nope. Kids sit on his lap and rub the hairs on his legs..... Biden said that.  Recently. Lol

Julia Louis-Dreyfus Emcees Joe Biden Fundraiser, Says Donald Trump Is ‚ÄúActually Worse‚Äù As President Than Selina Meyer  #SmartNews
Pelosi's family, Schumer and the Biden family have made fortunes from China's slave labor - then rush to change the subject to America's Confederate past of 150 years past. We all know they lie - but the hypocrisy is mind numbing!
A Joe Biden ad in the wild! Airing on ESPN during the Dodgers/Giants game.
Voting Biden is pretty much the equivalent of voting for an urn.
The media has convinced many brain dead voters that the coronavirus is Trump's fault, they've convinced the same dead heads that an empty suit called Joe Biden will do a better job - even though he enthusiastically helped send million of jobs to China.
I'm not sure people understand the potentially disastrous consequence of sending feds in to these Democratic shit hole cities. If ONE person ends up dead because of a federal officer you can say hello to President Sleepy Joe Biden.
As usual liberals understanding things their own idiotic ways. But if you want to go over the idiotic things DemoRats have said from Biden to AOC...i'll be more than happy to take the challenge. That would be an easy win! Ready for the challenge?

Or claiming Joe Biden is a Marxist. I‚Äôm a Marxist, trust me, he is not even CLOSE. Neither is Bernie, even.
God I miss him!! But I‚Äôm ridin with Biden now!! Get this idiot out of the White House! #Biden2020 #Vote
Cook now rates #AZSen Lean D &amp; #ALSen Lean R, which would cancel out. They rate six races as "toss-up" and Democrats would only have to win 3 of those for the majority if Biden won.
Hey, just a thought, but could you possibly stop the attacks on M4A, GND, student debt relief, defunding police, etc.? Biden is not perfect, nor even average or decent, and definitely not acceptable. You campaign for nothing, and we‚Äôll fight for policy.
Bro are you just blind! Biden openly sniffed young girls, put his hand on their chest, and more. Is that all you got! Because it‚Äôs nothing! Remember Bill Clinton rose w Epstein 23 times. Duh! Ask yourself which cities have more killings. Democrats run ones.
In fact Biden did. He also was against ending segregation. I can back anti racism. Full heartedly. When it‚Äôs put forth backed by truth.
Wallace can‚Äôt do it, he will wimp out for Biden.
You people are full of shit. Look at the foresight of Biden back in April.  Looks like he should be President
#ImVotingForBidenBecause well... Ha! kidding, I'm not voting Biden, not now or ever, would be insanity to vote for a guy who doesn't know where he is 90% of the time, or gropes and snifs women #Trump2020
It that joe Biden behind the mask?
This has the POTENTIAL be Biden‚Äôs America, but it is CURRENTLY DONALD FUCKING TRUMP‚ÄôS AMERICA!!  How much cognitive dissonance are you gonna shove down our fucking throats??
Biden leads in the polls: Could they be missing something?
Funny funny.   Biden is like stolen Chinese IP Spiderman with wolverine claws and it says Star Wars on it
#ImVoting4BidenBecause Trump is not a good leader. He ignores experienced counsel from experts in favor of making himself look like a strongman even if it makes him look foolish. Biden is able to lead and work with others.
Wait until after the Election and if Biden wins there will be a miraculous cure found by December 31th. Still hope Trump wins.
I adore the name you‚Äôve given him!  We‚Äôd love to borrow your government and their pandemic response until Biden is inaugurated in January!
I don't believe Biden can focus. I am an old guy and have never liked Biden but even I think it is sad to see his decline.
Well unfortunately for the dems it‚Äôs not happening with Biden at the helm.  Trump will destroy him in the debates. That‚Äôll be the swing right there. The country is in a shitty place right now I think everyone can agree on that
Lol!! He‚Äôs a republican. That‚Äôs where my allegiance is. He never said he was a good person! You want biden holding the nuclear button.  That fucking idiot has no idea whats going on.
Speaks clear enough the haters hear him in the back. Not sure, has he been caught creeping on little girls on camera multiple times? You‚Äôll never win this one fella. Biden would be the worst possible candidate. Dems should be pissed they let Bernie slip
You sound like someone whose never listened to Biden talk
His V.P. will be running the country under the direction of Obama and Soros. Biden will be in the basement jerking off.
There is nothing to worry about when They see that Biden Won the nuclear codes will be changed and Trump will be arrested and once he's in jail he will be handed his indictment paperwork
China is responsible for this with the help of the obama administration, which puts Biden in the middle of it.
You tried insulting my reading comprehension earlier, but the tables seem to have turned.  I said I don't support/defend Trump (the person).  He's done things that I would never condone.  Guess what?  Biden has too.  Presidents are fallible human beings - not perfect.
I was honored to meet many great people from Asia during my time in the Army and am also proud to be still able to tell these proud peoples apart including: Koreans. Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodians and Taiwanese! Biden knows the Chinese because they sign his checks!
#ImVoting4BidenBecause ummm.... actually, I'm not voting Biden. He's got nothing to offer except being Trump's evil twin. #NeverBiden #NeverTrump I'm voting #HOWIEHAWKINS2020 because America deserves better than two racist Republicans who only serve the 1%
He‚Äôs a pedophile who can‚Äôt even remember what he is saying. One debate and it‚Äôs over for Mr biden
And you support a guy who couldn‚Äôt pass it. Thx for making my point. I actually don‚Äôt support Trump as a person, but he‚Äôs a ‚Äúdoer‚Äù. Gets things done. Biden has been in politics for 35+ yrs (including as VP) &amp; has done NOTHING. And he‚Äôs the BEST the Dems can run out there?? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
This would be wonderful but I don't think anything about Biden's actions past or current remotely imply he would do such a thing. Has he even addressed ICE?
If Trump said this the national media would have an absolute hay day.  Add this to the tally of direct racist quotes by Biden that goes unreported by the national media, and blown off by his supporters.
Our unions like their current healthcare plans, as do 71% of Americans. But Eastman wants to take it all away. I will stand with the working men &amp; women of #NE02 and stop this radical agenda. Even Joe Biden says her plan will bankrupt the country &amp; he would veto it. 2/2

If u think Biden can make a coherent statement about anything and should then be ‚Äúquoted‚Äù then you‚Äôre living under a rock. He has stage 3 dementia. Sad actually

The reason this would be Biden‚Äôs America is because this is currently Trump‚Äôs America, you misleading, ignorant dumbass
Wait until Durham's report comes out. Those indicted were set up by the FBI and CIA - looks like Brennan will be the first to go to jail but it smells all the way to Biden and Obama if you would actually READ the evidence
Third option isn't not voting, it's the Green Party, which is way more Progressive than Joe Biden ever will be. Biden's way too far right to even be called a Democrat.
It's funny how folks who rant about "biased media" parrot the talking points of fear mongering politicians. I had a client today go on about Biden's America looking like the "Democratic run cities" of Chicago and Seattle. I had to remind her who the president is right effing now!
Mr.President. Your absolutely right. Barry Obama won't carry Senile Joe Biden across the finish line. Nope
Recent polling shows 31% of Americans think it justified to fire Trump donors, and 22% think the same for those who donate to Biden. Both are wrong. (1/2)
Not racist at all.  Criminal element will also expose a weakness in any system.  If biden gets elected, it will be a huge flood of crime not to mention an opposing force that could comundetected until it's too late.
If this was true(obviously isn‚Äôt), when biden wins he‚Äôll be the 2nd racist us president
This was the interview I saw.    "But do we agree that we can redirect some of the [police] funding?‚Äù asked one journalist. Biden"  "Yes, absolutely."  That would be awesome if he opposed defunding the police.  Most Dems want to &amp; I think he'll cave.  We'll see.
Snippets offered by Biden's campaign showed the pair wearing masks while arriving at an office, then sitting down well apart from each other to observe social distancing for a bare-faced chat.
Dear. Joe Biden race baiting won't work. Let's remember your white not black! If you could have changed the system of 50-plus years eight of them as Vice President of the United States. You would have. Sir, you can't run from your record. Your the worst Democrats could havechosen
It‚Äôs really funny. But honest question, do you think Biden could do the same thing? I mean really.
Rob. I have no doubt of the love and conscious generosity of Donald J Trump. After all. He works for the American People for free.  I wonder did Joe Biden? Nope. He went into office to enrich his family! Don't fool yourself the American people know the difference!
How can someone claim this would be Biden‚Äôs America when it‚Äôs footage of Trump‚Äôs America right now? Is he trying to support the fact that Biden will inherit a very broken country that Trump destroyed?
only major different Biden might do in a general sense.   Much of the violence as been a reaction to the authorities overreactions to the protest themselves.  There is an overreaction by the authority which results in people being anger and things becoming complicated.
He is far from the first racist president. Biden should just not say anything and let tRump talk himself out of getting re-elected. The more 45 speaks and the less Biden speaks improves voter turnout to remove 45.
Failed RINO is DJT.  Can't wait for Biden to get there and start working on cleaning up this mess that The President* has made for us.
Biden also suggested that President Trump is using race ‚Äúas a wedge‚Äù to distract from his mishandling of the pandemic.
Mr.President. You said this to Chris Wallace.. How many times have been written off? The lib Dems are in real trouble! Joe Biden is weak! I think the Democrats should re-think their Choice!  Remember this, the very people that say they hate you will actually vote for you! Again.!
There's a lot of videos of him sniffing little kids. Biden is gross.
Joe Biden Correctly Labels Donald Trump First Racist President Named Donald Trump
This is basically wrong.   This is based on the idea that Biden is some kind of grand leftist leader, he's really not.   Biden is very unlikely to address core of the issue the protestors actually have given his past voting record.
Dude- I just watched an interview with Biden where it literally came out of his own mouth. He prolly can‚Äôt remember saying it, but I do.
Don‚Äôt worry. Your local leftist newspaper (thank heavens their readership is low) will carry a front page pro Biden anti Trump headline from the speech.

Mehdi, don‚Äôt you get the vibe that nobody actually cares? Remember, as the Biden campaign has consistently told us ... its not about policy, it‚Äôs all about his supposed empathy. For that, Marianne Williamson is the obvious choice. And, it would be a surprise! ü§£

Oh, yeah, no. I thought you meant a female VP ascending if Biden were no longer in office.   As far as the third win, I was just projecting that we could see three more female presidents in our lifetime if a female VP ascended.

Correct. I believe one of the reasons Trump and his team are pushing for an election night call is to confuse any sort of close race.  If Biden wins with massive margins in enough states to take the EC, it's difficult to make any (sustainable) argument about a rigged election.

While voting for Biden is a vote for : Kamila Harris, Warren, Stacy Abrams. Therefore... Trump is still a better choice. Aside the fake news story
This is the saddest part of all of this. Biden clearly has dementia. If he is elected it will only hasten his decline. He should be at home, living as stress free as possible with his grandkids while he can still recognize them. What his handlers are doing to him is criminal.

You're right, at least if Biden wins.  The turd media and the rest of the left will stop pushing it and inflating the numbers. Biden will magically cure it one way or the other. By the way the whole world is spiking, not just the US. And libturd California is on fire with covid..

Frankly, most people don't understand what Communism is.  They just associated the term with bad and call it a day without attempting to understand what it is.  The idea that Biden is some kind of communist sympathizer is pretty laughable given his past record.

Sexism aside, Biden‚Äôs already said he intends to only serve one term. Shouldn‚Äôt they actively seek someone who wants to become POTUS so there‚Äôs a sense of continuity?
Need a reason to vote for Biden? How about: Joe Biden is an excellent judge of character.
Okay Dictator Donald! Smh! Biden already told us he would try to delay the election. Mail in voting and absentee are the same thing. He‚Äôs only saying this because it may produce the result he doesn‚Äôt like. Narcissists hate the possibility of losing! Only Congress can change dates
Biden cannot talk straight
More surrogate lies: Women are primary T donors, via Jr's mistress being paid a ton of bucks for her campaign work. Any proof? She's apparently not too good at her job since Ds are outraising Rs. Any proof that Biden will crush women for whom he has quite a good record?
My hope is that the GOP grows a set of balls after the election, and Congress has him removed.  Biden must crush him.
100% correct. Biden doesn‚Äôt know what city he‚Äôs in and can‚Äôt Complete a sentence. Harris is just a blowhard, literally and figuratively.
I live is a nice basic neighborhood, no golf course, but low income housing two blocks away, providing housing for at least a few people with physical disabilities and many elderly adults. My suburb is diverse and I am voting for Biden. #SuburbsForBiden
Based on my (very limited) survey of rural political sentiment (campaign signs on farm property between here and Grand Island), Biden needs to step up his farm game.  Turns out, two suburban neighbors are Trump's, too (that I know of).  It's depressing, honestly.
No to Kamala Harris. She let innocent people rot in jail and did unethical prosecutions. She will be a disaster as VP especially since she'll run for President if she is elected Vice President with Biden on day 1. Susan Rice would be a much better VP.
I‚Äôve havent seen a Biden sign since Obama‚Äôs name was above it .. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I mean, we all kind of thought Biden wasn't the candidate for the moment last year and the moment didn't agree. So... whatever. I'm actually higher on Harris than others are, but I get your concerns. There's little electoral consequence for 2020 but potentially large beyond that.
My hope is that she's still going to be very involved in the appointment process, particularly for Cabinet-level offices that are going to require Senate approval. I'd love her to be VP, but I just can't see Biden making that choice.
I think it's going to be Harris because I believe Biden's going to pick someone with a similar style to him and Warren would be too much of a clash. But I don't know that, because I know nothing.

B-I-N-G-O. It‚Äôs terrifying. I keep saying ‚Äònothing will shock me‚Äô but I don‚Äôt have a brain that accepts such madness &amp; insanity. So on a small scale, it‚Äôs like Lucy holding the football for Charlie Brown...I prepare myself all day/every day, and it‚Äôs nonstop fuckery...go #Biden
Thank you for the heads up on this  I am definitely going to order Showtime for this...and I love the timing of the release.   #TrumpKnewAndDidNothing #NobodyLikesYou #NobodyLikesMe #TrumpMeltdown   #Biden2020 #Biden
They want you to have to take their vaccine. And in the meantime, they want you to blame Trump for why the ‚Äúnumbers‚Äù here are so bad. So you‚Äôll vote for Biden - using only a mail in ballot.
And what honest people the Obama Admin were...
This type of thing makes my day. Need to take and hoard any ‚Äúgood‚Äù news that I hear, to hopefully balance my anger. Thank you for posting! #NobodyLikesMe #NobodyLikesTrump #TrumpMeltdown   GO #Biden2020 #Biden #Fauci
Did you here the Never Trumpers r going to vote for Biden?  They couldn't get RINO McCain elected  They couldn't get RINO Romney elected   And they sure aren't getting Biden elected  #trumptrain1111
ALL VICE PRESIDENTS WANT TO BE PRESIDENT. JOE BIDEN IS A GODDAMN VICE PRESIDENT THAT WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT. Are we seriously going to do this again? How many fucking times, America?
I hear you but typically VP running mates are chosen because their personalities lend themselves to taking a backseat. Biden. Pence. Al Gore. That guy Hillary chose that nobody remembers. Most candidates choose someone who doesn't repeatedly make headlines. Harris does.
The last iteration of this did not work for reasons obvious to anyone with a pulse. The problem with dementia is that you do not understand. This is not a comment on Biden‚Äôs other policies.
Yes, I am!!! I‚Äôm not typically a conspiracy theorist, but this is really freaking me out. I will drive my ballot to either the post office or nearest designated ballot box.  WHUCK? #NobodyLikesMe #NobodyLikesTrump #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpLoser   Go #Biden #Fauci #FauciIsAHero üíô

Pound sand. Biden will appoint who he wants. Primaries matter Lefties.
Really. Here is his own personal campaign media site.
Biden blows
Do the quiz and if your top candidate at the end is Biden by all means but I‚Äôm betting more folks line up with  or  more   Some 18 year old rocker is going to vote for the first time, folks like Sebastian Bach do carry influence
I totally agree. Last election cycle I put mine in the nearest designated Dropbox )at one of the libraries). You just need to find out where a Dropbox is. I‚Äôm so creeped out by this #Biden üíô
Biden is the left, as it stands.
Nobody wants a VP who puts becoming president 1 day ahead of having ur back. The job is about loyalty &amp; being subservient to the president. &amp; she trashed Biden viciously during the debates. If a male candidate had trashed Biden like that he shouldn't choose the man either.
It was that or this and I‚Äôd already used that one on another one of his ‚ÄúBiden is a vote for rock‚Äù posts.  He can have an opinion but we got enough vote shaming celebrities shill for Trump and Biden like they are actually the same and neither would piss on us to put out a fire
It's Kamala Harris? It Really Does Look Like the Biden Camp Might Have Botched Their VP Rollout
Biden / Clinton
If Biden is smart he'll listen to this article &amp; his top donors and not pick Kamala Harris as his running mate. Everything here is spot on.
After all the crap going on in our country, the economy is still better shape now than it ever was under the Obama/Biden duo.

Biden/Harris 2020 - The Ticket (to prison)
Whats Bidens plan. Juan   Oh   Wear a mask!  Lol  Great sution. Trump is about to get a vaccine fastest ever  It took Biden three years to set up a web site!!   He and Obama were incompetent idiots .
And Basement Joe Biden was involved clear up to that turkey neck of his. I don‚Äôt understand people who don‚Äôt think is is as serious as it is. Or that this is what the Dims are trying t bury with their bullsh*t.
He is convincing me to vote for Biden.
Lol! All the way to the WHITE HOUSE BIDEN 2020!
To be fair, I disagree with what your saying, but not too long ago (50 years ago) Biden supported segregation.  You aren‚Äôt willing to point that out - so what do you expect people to think when you‚Äôre supporting a racist?
is exactly like  both are racist, Republicans that get triggered by protesters protesting problems they're both responsible for. This is unacceptable #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Biden campaign calls Trump's failure to raise Russian bounties with Putin "despicable"  #SmartNews
Yeah, it's you sheep calling him a liberal that don't get it because liberal and progressive are two things Biden is NOT; he never has been and never will be. Joe's always been a Republican, he's not gonna change that.
Bernie Sanders and Howie Hawkins, that's it. Hawkins is only one of them left. Biden's nowhere near progressive nor is even a real Democrat, never has been, never will be. Joe's a career Republican and nothing he says or does will ever change that
Far right extremist. Conservative is accurate but too generous for him given how terrible he is. The people who said liberal or Progressive are morons because Biden is  neither, never has been, never will be

Trump, Biden Tied in Georgia Poll: Campaign Update  #SmartNews
Executive orders are worthless after November 3rd. We all know it. They will go away when President Biden has your removed by the back door of the Whitehouse. You should be packing up that gaudy shit you brought with you.
Like, yeah, cfa is probably way more harmful than any other place, but that‚Äôs like choosing joe Biden over trump
Biden isnt going to be better
And then tRump wants us to believe that this is Joe Biden‚Äôs America. Yeah, right.
A vote for Biden IS a vote for a ham sandwich...intellectually, anyway.
If Joe Biden was a murder hornet in disguise I would still vote for him. You can buzz off.
The video you had of the amazing liquor or beer tap, can't remember, my Biden Brain is coming on.ü§£
I‚Äôm just amazed that Biden is doing as ‚Äúwell‚Äù as he is.  He‚Äôs mentally challenged, he has no platform except he‚Äôs not Trump, and his four decade record in congress is as impressive as the Joe Philbin era.
Biden says his vice-presidential pick will be made by next week
You still wearing your big boy diapers? Biden doesn't wear big boy diapers
No chance. I‚Äôm voting for Biden as soon as my mail in ballot arrives.
Yeah it‚Äôs called the Biden campaign community
You one if Biden online events he only had 19 people
Hallelujah.  Someone finally figured out that Biden‚Äôs real name is Pinocchio &amp; he was carved out of wood by Geppeto a left wing democrat.  His strings are pulled by the left wing mob because typically wood resides between his ears.
I'm voting for Biden
Biden always has been a plagiarizer

Not that Cory Booker would be a bad choice for Biden‚Äôs cabinet, it‚Äôs just that... HUD is the only role Trump can imagine a black man filling because Trump is a racist.
How many I wonder in Twitterland are anxious like me for Biden and the Democrats take back our country so the investigations indictments and criminal trials start to rain down on Trump on Don Jr on Ivanka on Eric and on Barr?
There weren't enough "umm"s and "uh"s in that statement to have come from Biden. . .

Just remembered the fucking awful Biden attack ad I saw last night
Don‚Äôt ya think the even Biden deserves to be protected?  He could actually be President.  I don‚Äôt support him, but this is just absurd.
Much of the 26-page proposal ‚Äî and the billions in federal spending needed to pay for it ‚Äî had already been promised as part of previous, larger Biden plans to jumpstart the economy when the coronavirus outbreak begins to recede.
I‚Äôm sure Sasquatch could run the country better than Biden. üòÇ  Also, Biden‚Äôs in hiding more than Sasquatch at the current moment.   So this only makes sense.

There is literally nothing that Joe Biden could do to lose my vote. He could shoot a guy on 5th avenue.

Biden unveils economic plan to combat racial inequality  #SmartNews
Biden would have to announce a policy, so outlandish, that it makes Trump look pro-M4A in comparison.
Trump went to his bunker for an hour because the Secret Service told him to.  Biden's been in his for four months because his sycophants know he can't put together a sentence.
Lots of people in this thread not reading what‚Äôs between those two asterisks.   2016: HRC‚Äôs national margin was 2.1%. She won MN by 1.5%. MN was 0.6% more GOP than the country at large.   If Biden‚Äôs margin is 8% nationally and 5% in MN, MN shifted right relative to the country.
if we tried to push biden left he would probably fall over :(

I will send you a pic of a Biden yard sign, it‚Äôs actually hand made. Noticed it leaving my neighborhood yesterday. Lol.
You‚Äôre right. I misinterpreted the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù that you were talking about. People constantly drag Ryan as the one who‚Äôll be responsible if Biden loses. But, obviously, I was wrong. Hope you‚Äôll accept my apology.
Nice photoshopped image. Now I'm not denying that Biden has supported some racist legislation before, but don't bring him up when talking about Trump's racism. That's called redirecting, and its dishonest.
Voting for Biden from the BIG BLUE DOT üîµ CD-2 in Omaha, NE!!!
knock off the fear mongering, the threats of doom and the lies.  After four years of Chump, a Biden presidency sounds like just what the nation needs.  Start boxing your shit.  You're moving.

I want a Zombie for President.  I want to be lead by the communist party.  I think I‚Äôll vote for Biden.
Trump...made in the USA.  Biden...made by Democratic wood carver by the name of Gepetto.
Back in the ‚Äú50‚Äôs‚Äù I used to wonder how it would feel to live in a country run by Communists.  If Biden is elected I will get to find out.
Not hardly.  People that color themselves with this dung should vote for the head of the socialist party.  Biden.  You know.  The guy with Gepetto‚Äôs strings.
Sounds like something that happens in Biden's bathtub.
If anyone who ever wanted to be a communist but was afraid of public exposure, please step up and vote for the New Democratic Party and Joe Biden.
It is amazing time that Biden‚Äôs entire campaign is based on blaming Trump for the Chinese virus yet he can not offer one iota of evidence as to how he would have handled the situation had he been in charge.  His BS rhetoric is only overshadowed by the stupidity of his own party.
Would rather it were you. Not a Biden fan.
