I thought you were sure Trump would lose. I'm so confused at this point. 🤦‍♂️  The fact that Biden is so hell bent on a black female as a VP pick also tells me that they think Trump is taking away a good chunk of the black vote and they're trying to win it back.
I feel like republicans are siding w Democrats and handing the election to the Dems Biden or whoever they throw in  race.... no one is sticking up for Americans  is on his own. Where are the republicans. Durham is not releasing anything too many dirty politicians

Biden’s hiding. Dude didn’t even know where he was yest. It’s really unreal you think he’s even alive.
Thank you Mr. Pereira! Welcome to the Biden team and restoring our country.
Donors will go into a high press, fighting/blocking every inch of progressive ground mode. Under Biden/Pelosi/Schumer  midfield will be conceded before the match even starts. A zero-zero deadlock is a win for the donors, just like always.
She must have gotten a raise in her corruption payments.  I'm betting Biden got the same raise, although he probably has NO IDEA! 😂🤣😎
Where does Joe Biden go for apologies from Ari Fleischer and Jonathan Turley? Both publicly sneered whe Joe predicted that trump would try to delay the election.
"Biden’s support is largely driven by an anti-Trump sentiment, with 55 percent of Biden’s supporters in Pennsylvania saying they are voting against Trump, not for the former vice president."
Y’all didn’t say this about Biden, and here he is running for President. We have sexism and racism all wrapped up in one. A damn twofer.
We have past presidents who were major fuck ups, bush and Clinton, speak about an amazing human, John Lewis, and the fucking president can’t even show up? He’s a fucking joke. I can’t wait to vote in November FOR JOE MOTHERFUCKING BIDEN.
There is ANOTHER Obama-Biden scandal that may be under investigation.  The Obama years WILL go down in history as the most corrupt in American history!! #OBAMAGATE
Absolutely not!!!! To be fair I won’t vote for Biden either. I’ll only vote for my locally elected officials and leave the presidency space open
I think Joe Biden is doing a huge disservice to his voters by not already coming out with his VP pick. We as a country need to have stability and we can’t get that until he chooses his running mate. It would put a lot of Biden voters at ease (🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️) if he would be upfront.
Only if Biden wins.  If Trump wins, it will last until January of 2025. Unless we take back the House and hold the Senate. It's up to you, people? Do yo like your masks and eye shields?
Here’s a question, Trump maybe signing off to reduce our military in Germany, but such a withdrawal doesn’t happen immediately, it takes years... couldn’t a President Biden undo and reverse a morons capitulation to Putin?
Who is pushing Biden and why?  The danger here is palpable, as are the lies of who is behind the Biden campaign.  Know this: Every media outlet, politician, or citizen who supports Biden, supports the overthrow of America!!  Get this word out!!  BLM=Islam=Democrats=Biden!
When WAS the last time Trump lied? Be specific.  Maybe we can get in a pissing contest over who lied the most. Trump, Obama, or Biden

VP Biden said nothing about cutting funding he said redirect.
Kids in cages has me intent on voting Biden but what we need are socialists running as Republicans. They clearly have no safeguards to keep a group from seizing control.
It's not that they are overwhelmed. They are under a stand down order by the politicians. Until that gets lifted, the city doesn't stand a chance. Politicians are hoping Trump gets defeated, because they have to know he isn't going to send them any money. Biden will.
Listen to Biden, He Knows What’s Best.
Their network pays them to support Biden too.
Damn. Y’all better vote Biden.
“Too ambitious”? WTF?? Was this said about Biden when he was chosen to be VP? He had already run TWICE when we was selected.

Hahhaha Killary just endorsed Biden.... how the mighty have fallen.
If Biden is elected people will begin to see how oblivious he is. Biden has policies that conflict with Trumps and how is that good. People can may claims about Trump but they cannot deny facts. He’s created more jobs for America. He made our economy golden. What will Biden do?

Left bitching about this can’t really hurt Biden like they did Bernie tho 🤔
If local law enforcement is protecting peaceful protesters, as Biden argues they must, then the cops are not likely to ask said peaceful protesters if they are ideological anarchists. If they did I expect the peacefully protesting ideological anarchists to lie. Get a grip, Chris.

NPR loves Joe Biden.
Propaganda is what we just saw and that is our future under Kamala Harris/Joe Biden. Conservatives get as many people as you can to make their voices heard here on Twitter! Do it NOW!
Joe Biden is really his own worst enemy.
Indeed. All we have to do is:  Look at sweeping anti-gun legislation already on the books in states and like CA and NJ  Look at sweeping anti-gun bills circulating in Congress  Look at Joe Biden’s platform
Biden is a puppet for the Iranian Islamic Regime; those who slice off heads &amp; hands, and throw homosexuals off rooftops and execute teenagers for speaking out.  THEY are who Biden supports - and vice-versa!
Bad reporting. And very insulting to the intelligence of gun owners. Sweeping gun bans have been passed in several states and even more sweeping bills have been drawn up by congressional Democrats. Biden’s platform charts a path to an Australian style gun ban.
The Benghazi attacks will fall flat with voters, but if not, Biden/Rice can just point to the GOP's own house intel report. It disproved all of the Fox News talking points which is why they dropped it on the Friday before Thanksgiving.

Biden by 1 in Georgia makes perfect sense. Think he’s closer to 2. 49-47 Biden in GA
Breaking news...  Joe Biden had soup for lunch and immediately released this statement!! 😂🤣  (Hey! It makes as much sense as anything else from him!)
Current personality driven nominating stance obstructs the impact of a party platform. Biden and other Clintonistas aren't even trying to incorporate the concerns of the supporters of the losing candidates. The position weakens the party and strengthens the party power brokers.
If you don't believe the Clintons are capable of revenge on this national scale, then you haven't been paying attention.  Ask yourself, if Biden/Hillary wins, what sort of revenge will the Democrats exact on every last one of us?  It would be a HORROR!!  VOTE RED!!
We're seeing revenge/fear.  Hillary lost in 2016 and never got over it.  Biden is a placeholder. Revenge/hate/fear is rampant, trying to force people to abandon Trump and vote Biden. HRC will then step in and take over.  Clinton/Democrat revenge is being foisted on America!
You’re right.. Listen to Biden, he knows what’s best for America. 😂 #Biden2020
BILL LEWIS: By many accounts, Joe Biden is spending a whole bunch of his time lately in conferences with campaign officials and attorneys, vetting possible vice-presidential candidates to run with him on the Democratic presidential ticket.

A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty - The Boston Globe #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt
Why would anyone vote for Biden, let alone ANY of the incompetent VP's he might pick? Seriously. Why?
good point by  Biden not only won the Michigan primary this year, he won every county, including Tlaib's Wayne County. Tlaib's candidate Bernie Sanders lost by 16 points in the same state where he beat Hillary four years ago.
Tlaib is getting primaried by Detroit City Council president Brenda Jones. It's a tougher race than you'd expect for an incumbent but Tlaib acts like it's in the bag: "I don't have to have a campaign plan for November because I have a safe Democratic seat"
Biden has a life long stutter, what's Trump's excuse? He's just an idiot
Also said she thought Michiganders would be "inspired" by voting against Trump (rather than for Biden)
‘Squad’ Member Tlaib Won't Endorse Biden  "I don't want to get into a debate with my residents"
No way Biden is up 7% in North Carolina and down in by 1% in Georgia. Only one of these can be right
How about something like tweeting   - “I was wrong about my stance on Trump/Biden. After reflecting I believe the country is headed in a better direction and I fully support our new president.”  Then setting it up as a pinned tweet for like 3 days before saying it was a joke.
Who wants to bet that when Biden loses, he'll claim that there was voter fraud due to mail-in ballots?
Look, im gonna be real, if Biden doesn’t ban the chainsmokers from ever making music again then idk man
Fox's Chris Wallace says Biden campaign turned down interview request: 'We'll keep asking'

I’ll be shocked if Biden debates. So a more realistic question: What will the polls do when Biden announces he won’t be debating?
Kamala Harris is too strong for Biden and harsh no one likes her.  The others are all the same and don’t offer any benefit to Biden. It will be a vote for Joe &amp; Val to get the job done campaign. But he has to come full circle on the Defund the police to reform...

Here is another Joe Biden commercial.
So much for the People’s House. Biden ought to make a commercial telling everyone he will tear this wall down on January 20th at about 12:05 PM.
100 days.  Fight like Biden is down by 50 points.
Listen to Biden.. He Knows What’s Best. 🤣

(CNN) With 100 days remaining until Election Day, voters in three critical battleground states swing in former Vice President Joe Biden's way, according to new Arizona, Florida and Michigan CNN polls conducted by SSRS.
I don't think any of them do. I think they skipped ahead a few months. But good news is that even right wing alcoholics think Biden wins
Let's hope Biden wins. And the Democrats sweep both houses. There will be peace in our time.

What kind of President stands by why mobs riot, killing people and people’s businesses? Address THOSE issues Mr. Biden.
I’m surprised Biden is even that close!  Just saying!!
The left doesn’t care about either accusations, never mind the racist comments from Biden. The swing voters and voters on the right DO care though, if Biden wants those votes he going to need to do more than say you aren’t black if you don’t vote for me...
What I’m saying is this tweet is wrong. Clinton got a ton more votes than Trump but lost because of where. More numbers will not help Biden. What will help Biden is making the Ukraine issue go away, and fighting the pediphile accusations.
We gonna turn this Motha out! Biden 2020!!!
i remember when he almost won iowa instead of bernie or biden and i was like “BUTTIGIEG?! BUTTIGIEG?! Bernie sweetie i am so sorry.”
someone must’ve told Trump to act more like Biden! He can only go so far, because his nasty nature always shines thru. His attempt to open all areas of the country to fossil fuels is as bad as he handledCovid &amp; fed thugs attacking citizens is start of war.
WE DONT WANT YOU TO BEAT BIDEN YOU MORON. YOU LITERALLY CANT BECOME PRESIDENT EVEN WITH WRITE INS
And if Biden wins, he's just as much and a pedo.  Will u say the same. Doubt it.
I got blocked by a yankee fan last night that was bitching about Mo. Told him Biden is as much a racist as anyone in politics.  Video of him saying he would never allow his grandkids to grow up in a black neighborhood cause its a jungle. But thats not racist I guess.
i mean biden will be a little better but there are still massive issues that just another lukewarm president like him wouldn’t solve
Agree.. Joe Biden as a placeholder.
Thankfully we’ve got Joe Biden on deck — he’s famous for his photographic recall.
That’s probably the only way the Biden rallies could show some attendance.
I’m voting for Trump.  Not ashamed in the least.  If you are proud of who you support then you would say it.  Which means you are voting for Biden and you are a HUGE liberal z
We don’t want to influence the election interesting. Since Obama and Biden tried to influence the last election with lies. We will lose this country if we don’t fight like they do!
Hope you’re voting for Biden in this election. Not voting is a vote for trump!
I call him an idiot all the time. But when it comes to Covid, he listened to President Fauci and at every turn. Biden, Hillary, Obama would have done basically same thing. That’s just obvious.
Remind me again when biden was president?
It's almost like people forgot  the reason we EVER liked Biden to begin with   was largely because of the Obama/Biden memes...that just all seemed to make that old soggy bread... almost endearing
We as citizens of a free America must make Joe and Jill Biden the next President and First Lady!!
It seems that's the plan. They keep their foot on the brake by continuing lockdowns. If Biden wins, they take their foot off of the brake. He won't be able to press the gas, but inertia will make things improve.  See!? Joe fixed the economy!!! 🤦‍♂️🙄
I can’t wait to see Biden unveil this portrait next year in the WH. This image of President Obama is the epitome of presidential.
I'd say most people globally would position it as slightly to the left of Margaret Thatcher and right of center. It's to the right of Joe Biden who is to the right of center globally.
Biden's speech therapy.
Dear Mr. President. Let’s quit slamming Mr. Biden’s mental acuity. I am 73 years old, and guilty of it also. We all may be there someday. You as well. This approach is probably not receptive to your older devotees. Thank you.
That will look like child's play if Biden and Democrats take control in November
good to see Trump following Joe Biden’s lead and calling off a big convention in Florida. No one was going anyway, with Trump failing to handle the coronavirus, leaving America gasping for air across the country. How this loser became president is beyond belief!
Oh? Does Trump pander to his Evangelical voters by appointing anti-abortion judges? Is Biden pandering to the Black vote with a Vice Presidency? Why is it a mistake for a party to pay attention to the people who will spend the majority of their lives under the structure?
So who else believes that no matter what happens with the election shit is really going to hit the fan. If Biden wins we're screwed and I'm sure a lot of us will be ready to fight against the communist. If Trump wins they're going to want to fight.
States certify their elections. Electors meet and vote. Results are forwarded to the President of the Senate (NOT McConnell or Pence). The elector ballots are counted and Biden officially becomes President Elect. On 1/20/2021 Trump's term ends he will be removed from WH.
Trump will win regardless of who Biden picks as his VP:
I often wonder why out of all the people on planet Earth we decided the person to beat Trump was Joe Biden.   out of all the options   out of all the amazing people  Brand recognition has power. It’s why Trump won, and why Biden still exists for some reason
What % of US believes #HidinJoeBiden will actually be the democratic nominee? It’s a setup! W  replacing him with who? 0 Biden signs 0 billboards or support anywhere! Find out who is running against Trump.
Fun fact: Joe Biden and his family have spent their entire lives living in and enjoying suburb life. Donald Trump has never lived in a suburb.
There will be no debates. The Biden team has agreed to three debates but will back out of them and somehow blame Trump. The media will go along.
Then let it burn to the ground! Will allow all US Citizens to have visual of what a Biden White House will do to our communities.
Don’t despair. You’re right there with Biden!
Virus will only expire Nov.4 if Biden wins. If  wins, it will last another...4 years because the media says so
The ATL Mayor (who I like, btw) has no reason to appear on late night comedy TV.  Unless the Democratic Party is testing her likability as Biden's running mate with a key voting demographic.  I'd be fascinated to see who was on the email chain that made this interview happen.
It’s my sincere prayer that On Nov. 4 will be the dawning of a new day and better things for our Country as you are utterly rejected by an enormous amount of people who will vote for Joe Biden
Biden better not put on a military helmet and climb into a tank!
Let's watch Biden take it. They can even reduce it to 3 words. I'll take bets on the results. Will you?
Something to consider. When joe Biden is NOT the actual nominee, look how fast the new nominees signs and stickers will be put out. They’ve already been printed, sitting in the warehouse. It’s all planned for them. Joe will fail cognitive test, DNC will choose another. That’s how
This.... doesn’t even make sense? How would this be Joe Biden’s America when America is already like this and Trump is the person who did this? So you sound fucking stupid.
Mexico definitely won’t pay for this one. They don’t want him either. Maybe we can scare him away with reminders of all the indictments that will be filed against him, his hideous family and his corrupt businesses, the minute Biden’s in and he’s out. Let him run to Russia.
Trump virtual fundraiser almost doubles haul of Biden, Obama campaign call
If Donald Trump came out and told people to vote for Joe Biden, do you think Democrats would vote for him?
Biden will stick his foot in his mouth repeatedly until Election Day. It’s what he does. He will misspeak as well. It’s what he does. He may not have bankrupted as many businesses or paid off as many porn stars, but he is not a good candidate except by comparison.
The QAnon loonies think there’s a time portal to Biden’s future America in their fridge, where JFK Jr. hides in the meatloaf and Q will reveal himself from the veggie drawer.A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Donald Trump
A vote for joe biden is a vote for Donald trump. This statement holds more weight than yours because there’s some truth behind it since they’re both statist assholes.
I cannot wait till he gets his ass fried for spying on Trump. He and biden had their hands in the illegal coup.
F*** you, Joe Biden
Yes. Alternating between suggesting that Biden is a corrupt socialist despot-to-be and a dementia patient.
Biden has been a politician for how many years? But all the United States problems are because of Trump now? It’s ridiculous. He was in a lose-lose with the Coronavirus. And please tell me you think Biden is of the right mind to be president? Can the Democrats not find better?
So showing footage of Trump's America and labeling it as Biden's America isn't working?? 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ Idiots.
I am voting for President Trump. According to Biden, I ain’t black
I feel like “attacking Biden” is a stretch. If you’re a white leftist, odds are you’re not suprised by this stuff from trump and you gave up hope a year or two ago on him. Just gotta get him out.

Not what he says, but, is he seriously going to vote for biden. I cringe watching biden function.
No doubt that is a number that is dishonest...how many people died from OTHER causes, but had some covid-19 in them and were labeled a “covid” death? We my never know the real number. But if Biden wins in Nov., this completely goes away...

Yes trump will win big in nov and have 4 more years to make America great. Don’t like it leave the country . We are a Christian nation with freedoms that other nations only dream of and the socialist nazi democrat joe Biden will not get a chance to destroy it.
Is that a real squirrel? If so how did you domesticate it?
I love squirrels. I wish I had a pet one.
Bernie got out because Dems were uniting behind Biden. Bernie was losing primaries everywhere and had no path to nomination.
To all democrats answer me why Biden refuses to have a unscripted interview with Chris Wallace. Trump did and answered some hard questions. Scared your candidate can’t complete a sentence with out screwing up! Anybody want to tell me why.
Wonder who's going to feed Biden the questions, like Donna Brazile did with Hillary!!
I see NO REASON, in any universe, why a VIRTUAL DEBATE would be necessary in Nov.  Remember HILLARY and TRUMP on stage? This time will be TRUMP and BIDEN on stage! Far apart! The people who ask the questions can wear masks if they want to!
Thank you so much.😘
He talked to Putin &amp; MBS the other day.  He's sold weapons to Saudi Arabia, never condemned MBS for killing Khashoggi, he rented out our military to them cuz "they pay in cash". I know way too much about this corruption.
I don’t think anyone ever called Joe Biden a Marxist before 2020.   It’s almost as if Republicans were planning on running against Bernie Sanders and are just recycling playbook against Biden.   It should be remembered that Democrat primary voters rallied AGAINST the socialist.
RUSH: What all of this means is that you shouldn't be believing anything in the news about Biden leading in the polls, about Biden being way ahead of Trump.
Do you have a problem because I do mine is Biden what is yours
RUSH: I&amp;#039;ve had a couple emails from people asking, &amp;#34;Hey, Rush, what do you think about this projection that Trump is gonna lose everything?&amp;#34;
In your America, the White House has to be behind fences because the people can’t stand your policies.  But wait, it wasn’t like that with #Obama. #Biden will defeat you.
There is more and more evidence that the Trump Administration is playing up and escalating the civil unrest around the country because they think it will help at the polls if voters see the violence as "Biden's America." It's the 2020 version of the migrant caravan.

But Trumps doing the same shit Biden would be doing hell Trump enacted more gun control than Obama, has sent more troops overseas than he’s brought back, has continued to send out massive subsidies to big businesses there’s no real difference between them
has my vote. I was hoping for  to run/be nominated for the Libertarian party again.   Biden needs to retire, he's plagiarized enough already. Trump was "booming" the fiscal deficit prior to covid, yet he's conservative? That dude is a joke.. 👎

Could Biden Syndrome be contagious?? 🤔

Biden is really pandering for votes! He does not give a damn about AMERICA. 😡Check out this video!!
What do you mean Biden?  That’s Trump’s secret army.
You know Biden is a Christian, right?   Or was this supposed to be sarcastic?
What’s the changing the vice president no thank you Trump looks better than Biden. #CelebrationForChange

I'll stand at the white house defending him because there is no way Joe Biden wins this election legally. Why dont you report the news instead of your propaganda bullshit.
The problem is that individual Rs failed to hold Trump accountable.  The flip side is that we will need divided government for the Biden years.
No what many people want is a president that will actually protect their rights which neither trump or Biden will do and just because you’re afraid to break the status quo doesn’t make everyone who’s isn’t afraid a pussy in fact I think it makes you the pussy
I am confusion.....how did y'all choose Biden over this man?
Yes mam... Biden. Granted Biden is a pretty weak candidate imo... Bernie endorsed him and they’ve been pushing for student loan forgiveness for quite some time 🙏🏾
Well we sure don't need you Biden! You don't have one thought in your empty head!! Only words written for you, puppet!!

WHHAT those are so fuckin good dude, I can get behind em like Joe Biden on a minor
It’s hard to imagine Biden getting up the energy to destroy anything.
I’ve been having the same dilemma. No matter who wins president, I want divided government. That looks like Biden so I’m rooting for Rs to hold Congress (also to preserve filibuster). Problem is I told my Congressfolk that in wouldn’t support them if they didn’t hold Trump...
Yes this is the perfect explanation of jo Biden’s career in politics. Thanks Bette I couldn’t have said it any better
With Trump down 18 to Biden in Florida this should be interesting. Of course DeSatan isn’t far behind now since he’s so botched his response
Nancy Pelosi will be the new President. She will be named Biden's running mate in September.
If I could vote, #ImVoting4BidenBecause  Biden is running on the most progressive platform in history.
I felt my anxiety drop five levels by simply listening to this calm intelligent conversation between Pres Obama and future Pres Biden. I hadn’t realized how starved I was for adult conversation from our leaders.
Obama and Biden had 8 years to screw up this country and in spite of what people said- they did not. The eight years of Obama Biden were like a nice walk in the park compared to Trump’s cataclysmic term.
It wouldn't even be Joe Biden's.  It would be Pelosi's.I don't know which would be worse!

That hurts Biden. He’s going to fix this mess.
Where does Joe Biden go for apologies from Ari Fleischer and Jonathan Turley? Both publicly sneered whe Joe predicted that trump would try to delay the election.
"Biden’s support is largely driven by an anti-Trump sentiment, with 55 percent of Biden’s supporters in Pennsylvania saying they are voting against Trump, not for the former vice president."
Y’all didn’t say this about Biden, and here he is running for President. We have sexism and racism all wrapped up in one. A damn twofer.
We have past presidents who were major fuck ups, bush and Clinton, speak about an amazing human, John Lewis, and the fucking president can’t even show up? He’s a fucking joke. I can’t wait to vote in November FOR JOE MOTHERFUCKING BIDEN.
There is ANOTHER Obama-Biden scandal that may be under investigation.  The Obama years WILL go down in history as the most corrupt in American history!! #OBAMAGATE

I think Joe Biden is doing a huge disservice to his voters by not already coming out with his VP pick. We as a country need to have stability and we can’t get that until he chooses his running mate. It would put a lot of Biden voters at ease (🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️) if he would be upfront.
Only if Biden wins.  If Trump wins, it will last until January of 2025. Unless we take back the House and hold the Senate. It's up to you, people? Do yo like your masks and eye shields?
Here’s a question, Trump maybe signing off to reduce our military in Germany, but such a withdrawal doesn’t happen immediately, it takes years... couldn’t a President Biden undo and reverse a morons capitulation to Putin?
Who is pushing Biden and why?  The danger here is palpable, as are the lies of who is behind the Biden campaign.  Know this: Every media outlet, politician, or citizen who supports Biden, supports the overthrow of America!!  Get this word out!!  BLM=Islam=Democrats=Biden!
When WAS the last time Trump lied? Be specific.  Maybe we can get in a pissing contest over who lied the most. Trump, Obama, or Biden
Wow. This is getting real. A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty - The Boston Globe
VP Biden said nothing about cutting funding he said redirect.
Kids in cages has me intent on voting Biden but what we need are socialists running as Republicans. They clearly have no safeguards to keep a group from seizing control.
It's not that they are overwhelmed. They are under a stand down order by the politicians. Until that gets lifted, the city doesn't stand a chance. Politicians are hoping Trump gets defeated, because they have to know he isn't going to send them any money. Biden will.
Listen to Biden, He Knows What’s Best.
Their network pays them to support Biden too.
Damn. Y’all better vote Biden.
“Too ambitious”? WTF?? Was this said about Biden when he was chosen to be VP? He had already run TWICE when we was selected.

Left bitching about this can’t really hurt Biden like they did Bernie tho 🤔
If local law enforcement is protecting peaceful protesters, as Biden argues they must, then the cops are not likely to ask said peaceful protesters if they are ideological anarchists. If they did I expect the peacefully protesting ideological anarchists to lie. Get a grip, Chris.
Propaganda is what we just saw and that is our future under Kamala Harris/Joe Biden. Conservatives get as many people as you can to make their voices heard here on Twitter! Do it NOW!
Biden is a puppet for the Iranian Islamic Regime; those who slice off heads &amp; hands, and throw homosexuals off rooftops and execute teenagers for speaking out.  THEY are who Biden supports - and vice-versa!
The Benghazi attacks will fall flat with voters, but if not, Biden/Rice can just point to the GOP's own house intel report. It disproved all of the Fox News talking points which is why they dropped it on the Friday before Thanksgiving.

Vickie, At some point we must look at results. I don’t hate Biden. If anything, I feel sorry for him because he is being used while losing function. I have delt with dementia with my mother-in-law. It doesn’t get better. It’s a progressive illness,a true long goodbye. Good luck.
If you don't believe the Clintons are capable of revenge on this national scale, then you haven't been paying attention.  Ask yourself, if Biden/Hillary wins, what sort of revenge will the Democrats exact on every last one of us?  It would be a HORROR!!  VOTE RED!!
We're seeing revenge/fear.  Hillary lost in 2016 and never got over it.  Biden is a placeholder. Revenge/hate/fear is rampant, trying to force people to abandon Trump and vote Biden. HRC will then step in and take over.  Clinton/Democrat revenge is being foisted on America!
You’re right.. Listen to Biden, he knows what’s best for America. 😂 #Biden2020
BILL LEWIS: By many accounts, Joe Biden is spending a whole bunch of his time lately in conferences with campaign officials and attorneys, vetting possible vice-presidential candidates to run with him on the Democratic presidential ticket.
Because he’s not. Rumors started by trump because Biden has a stutter. Trump loves  making fun of people’s flaws and/ or imperfections, and being a bully.

good point by  Biden not only won the Michigan primary this year, he won every county, including Tlaib's Wayne County. Tlaib's candidate Bernie Sanders lost by 16 points in the same state where he beat Hillary four years ago.
Tlaib is getting primaried by Detroit City Council president Brenda Jones. It's a tougher race than you'd expect for an incumbent but Tlaib acts like it's in the bag: "I don't have to have a campaign plan for November because I have a safe Democratic seat"
Also said she thought Michiganders would be "inspired" by voting against Trump (rather than for Biden)
‘Squad’ Member Tlaib Won't Endorse Biden  "I don't want to get into a debate with my residents"
No way Biden is up 7% in North Carolina and down in by 1% in Georgia. Only one of these can be right
How about something like tweeting   - “I was wrong about my stance on Trump/Biden. After reflecting I believe the country is headed in a better direction and I fully support our new president.”  Then setting it up as a pinned tweet for like 3 days before saying it was a joke.
An example of  a #POTUS that shows up to pay respect to a civil servant given the honor of lying in state.

I’ll be shocked if Biden debates. So a more realistic question: What will the polls do when Biden announces he won’t be debating?
Kamala Harris is too strong for Biden and harsh no one likes her.  The others are all the same and don’t offer any benefit to Biden. It will be a vote for Joe &amp; Val to get the job done campaign. But he has to come full circle on the Defund the police to reform...

What kind of President stands by why mobs riot, killing people and people’s businesses? Address THOSE issues Mr. Biden.
I’m surprised Biden is even that close!  Just saying!!
The left doesn’t care about either accusations, never mind the racist comments from Biden. The swing voters and voters on the right DO care though, if Biden wants those votes he going to need to do more than say you aren’t black if you don’t vote for me...
What I’m saying is this tweet is wrong. Clinton got a ton more votes than Trump but lost because of where. More numbers will not help Biden. What will help Biden is making the Ukraine issue go away, and fighting the pediphile accusations.
We gonna turn this Motha out! Biden 2020!!!
someone must’ve told Trump to act more like Biden! He can only go so far, because his nasty nature always shines thru. His attempt to open all areas of the country to fossil fuels is as bad as he handledCovid &amp; fed thugs attacking citizens is start of war.
WE DONT WANT YOU TO BEAT BIDEN YOU MORON. YOU LITERALLY CANT BECOME PRESIDENT EVEN WITH WRITE INS
And if Biden wins, he's just as much and a pedo.  Will u say the same. Doubt it.
I got blocked by a yankee fan last night that was bitching about Mo. Told him Biden is as much a racist as anyone in politics.  Video of him saying he would never allow his grandkids to grow up in a black neighborhood cause its a jungle. But thats not racist I guess.
Agree.. Joe Biden as a placeholder.
That’s probably the only way the Biden rallies could show some attendance.
I’m voting for Trump.  Not ashamed in the least.  If you are proud of who you support then you would say it.  Which means you are voting for Biden and you are a HUGE liberal z
We don’t want to influence the election interesting. Since Obama and Biden tried to influence the last election with lies. We will lose this country if we don’t fight like they do!
Hayes hates Trump so baldy he’s willing to destroy USA w/Biden + Dems. Legalize illegals, open borders, free health Ins for illegals, destroy Police &amp; history, pay reparations, limit free speech w/hate speech laws, confiscate guns, destroy Christianity &amp; Judaism n favor Islam.
Hope you’re voting for Biden in this election. Not voting is a vote for trump!
I call him an idiot all the time. But when it comes to Covid, he listened to President Fauci and at every turn. Biden, Hillary, Obama would have done basically same thing. That’s just obvious.
It's almost like people forgot  the reason we EVER liked Biden to begin with   was largely because of the Obama/Biden memes...that just all seemed to make that old soggy bread... almost endearing

People who worked for YOU are ENFORCING BIDEN AND WORKING TO GET YOU OUT
I can’t wait to see Biden unveil this portrait next year in the WH. This image of President Obama is the epitome of presidential.
I'd say most people globally would position it as slightly to the left of Margaret Thatcher and right of center. It's to the right of Joe Biden who is to the right of center globally.
The Squad will control Biden if he wins. We can’t let Biden and the Far Left win! I’m asking all of you, do your part by trying to convince intelligent indepdents and moderate Dems why they need to vote Trump. The modern Dems are NOT the party of JFK or even Bill Clinton
Biden's speech therapy.
Dear Mr. President. Let’s quit slamming Mr. Biden’s mental acuity. I am 73 years old, and guilty of it also. We all may be there someday. You as well. This approach is probably not receptive to your older devotees. Thank you.
That will look like child's play if Biden and Democrats take control in November
Calling someone a racist is very ad hominem personally, when u call a president racists you are also calling people who support him racist  So you want racist to vote for you as president? Mr Biden
good to see Trump following Joe Biden’s lead and calling off a big convention in Florida. No one was going anyway, with Trump failing to handle the coronavirus, leaving America gasping for air across the country. How this loser became president is beyond belief!
So who else believes that no matter what happens with the election shit is really going to hit the fan. If Biden wins we're screwed and I'm sure a lot of us will be ready to fight against the communist. If Trump wins they're going to want to fight.
States certify their elections. Electors meet and vote. Results are forwarded to the President of the Senate (NOT McConnell or Pence). The elector ballots are counted and Biden officially becomes President Elect. On 1/20/2021 Trump's term ends he will be removed from WH.
I don’t consider Obama/McCain to have been a competitive election, so I view Biden/Trump as the second non competitive election of my lifetime
Trump will win regardless of who Biden picks as his VP:
How does Biden get blamed for this Ted Cruz? The GOP way is to spend our way into bankruptcy and leave the mess for the Democrats to clean up.
I often wonder why out of all the people on planet Earth we decided the person to beat Trump was Joe Biden.   out of all the options   out of all the amazing people  Brand recognition has power. It’s why Trump won, and why Biden still exists for some reason
What % of US believes #HidinJoeBiden will actually be the democratic nominee? It’s a setup! W  replacing him with who? 0 Biden signs 0 billboards or support anywhere! Find out who is running against Trump.
Fun fact: Joe Biden and his family have spent their entire lives living in and enjoying suburb life. Donald Trump has never lived in a suburb.
Then let it burn to the ground! Will allow all US Citizens to have visual of what a Biden White House will do to our communities.
Don’t despair. You’re right there with Biden!
Virus will only expire Nov.4 if Biden wins. If  wins, it will last another...4 years because the media says so
The ATL Mayor (who I like, btw) has no reason to appear on late night comedy TV.  Unless the Democratic Party is testing her likability as Biden's running mate with a key voting demographic.  I'd be fascinated to see who was on the email chain that made this interview happen.
It’s my sincere prayer that On Nov. 4 will be the dawning of a new day and better things for our Country as you are utterly rejected by an enormous amount of people who will vote for Joe Biden
Biden better not put on a military helmet and climb into a tank!
Let's watch Biden take it. They can even reduce it to 3 words. I'll take bets on the results. Will you?
Something to consider. When joe Biden is NOT the actual nominee, look how fast the new nominees signs and stickers will be put out. They’ve already been printed, sitting in the warehouse. It’s all planned for them. Joe will fail cognitive test, DNC will choose another. That’s how
This.... doesn’t even make sense? How would this be Joe Biden’s America when America is already like this and Trump is the person who did this? So you sound fucking stupid.
Mexico definitely won’t pay for this one. They don’t want him either. Maybe we can scare him away with reminders of all the indictments that will be filed against him, his hideous family and his corrupt businesses, the minute Biden’s in and he’s out. Let him run to Russia.
Trump virtual fundraiser almost doubles haul of Biden, Obama campaign call
If Donald Trump came out and told people to vote for Joe Biden, do you think Democrats would vote for him?
Biden will stick his foot in his mouth repeatedly until Election Day. It’s what he does. He will misspeak as well. It’s what he does. He may not have bankrupted as many businesses or paid off as many porn stars, but he is not a good candidate except by comparison.
The QAnon loonies think there’s a time portal to Biden’s future America in their fridge, where JFK Jr. hides in the meatloaf and Q will reveal himself from the veggie drawer.
...Boris, you do know Biden isn’t President right?! Your buddy Trump is look where we are...including you. #TrashHow is trump a hero? By letting hundreds of thousands of Americans die through his gross negligence? By letting Russia set a bounty on US troops because he’s too lazy to read his debriefs? And how exactly is Biden a cheater?
Yeah, Biden will take an even stronger lead. He’s not the most eloquent speaker but he’ll be debating a man with the vocabulary and complexity of thought of a 2 year old.
I agree that Bass is on the older side: contrasts with his view of himself as ‘transitional’. Plus, if she really has no desire to run for POTUS, well, that’s a mark against her, IMO. We need someone who wants to run after Biden leaves the stage.
That is a clear problem—we need someone who will run for president and win after Biden.....
know why they were excluded. I wish Biden could shut this down—these people are doing no favors.
Very—I am not surprised, but disappointed in the behavior of these supposed Biden ‘allies’—my only criticism of Contraras’s point is she says Biden’s team is responsible for this discourse—but they report is entirely sourced by people out of the loop, intentionally. And we now
Thank you for the input, Joe Biden’s staffer

What movement? Biden doesn’t seem to support any movement. He’s gone out of his way to reassure the powerful that the status quo won’t change. Literally no movement.
He’s got most of you swamp monsters on record.  We are moving ahead with the elections and you can’t stop the cognitive decline of Biden.
He’s getting dems to yell about holding the elections so they can’t backtrack and try to stop them when Biden declines in the polls.
I don't think Biden is the type to be "hands-off" of anything.
how did it feel to get your ass handed to you by both parties for a change?  I will crawl across glass if necessary to vote for #Biden in November.
i took a quiz about who biden should nominate as his VP hmm interesting (linked below)
This I definitely agree with, but the degree to which Biden leads Trump in polls right now does historically signal a landslide loss
I called it in February it would be BIDEN/Harris 20020. I hope we're Right!
Not even gonna lie, Joe Biden iffy but his climate change proposal caught my attention 👀 100% clean energy economy no later than 2050 AND net-zero emissions? Okay okay
Also...have you seen *Trump* speak? I’m not sure how anyone can suggest that Biden’s public speaking skills are worse than Trumps. My two year old nephews have a more advanced vocabulary
Will be voting for Biden and will be a poll worker.  #WeWillVote

So much for your understanding of the situation.  Biden is choosing who is best for him as a running mate. That’s the criteria. He’s decided to choose a woman. Whether you approve or not is your issue
I don’t know how that would play politically, but she’s smart as hell. I wouldn’t want her &amp; Biden to to fall back into old foreign policy habits, though.
Hope you’re right. But my guess is Biden will win.
But what if they will be voting Biden into office in November?
I will be voting for Biden.
Lmao 😂 what are you talking about???  Biden was on live TV with his Muslim speech.  There is NO conspiracy to what he said.  Look it up or stay a sheep 🐑 and believe everything you are told.
That’s — weird, but ok. She appears competent. I get no other impression from her. She seems like a traditional politician. Which isn’t going to balance out Biden very well. He needs someone who isn’t white bread.
Not for long if Biden wins.  Sharia law= executing gay people.  Today’s Democrat party isn’t the one of the past.  They’ve gone off the deep end. Didn’t you see Biden’s speech about Muslims? If you did you’d know that all gay ppl are in serious trouble if he wins.
Not this time. Biden is likely a one-termer, and the VP takes over the incumbent spot.   How many times has it actually happened, anyway?
Plus—this is precisely what is needed: a woman who can win after Biden leaves the scene...
Do they realize that this is precisely what we need now in a VP?? Someone who csn win after Biden leaves the scene???
As for not bothering to vote if you don’t particularly care for Biden’s VP — how is that logical?   That’s a vote for Trump. If that’s fine with you, well, ok.   If you don’t want four more years of *this*, perhaps you need to vote, regardless of who Biden’s VP is.
I live near Atlanta, and very much like Mayor Bottoms. But she is not prepared to be POTUS, nor is Stacey Abrams, another woman I respect.   They both need more Foreign Policy/Natl. experience.  Biden’s VP needs to be prepared to be POTUS on day one, due to his age, &amp; COVID, too.
Do I remember correctly that Biden being picked was a surprise, and that Evan Bayh had been considered the frontrunner?
Lol I guess Biden shouldn’t have been VP then...
I honestly could care less what they do lol 😂  Was just stating the obvious fact that men can’t give birth.  I don’t care how any one identifies or lives as long as they don’t harm others. The gay community is really going to be in danger though if Biden wins. God help them!
Can we also keep the part where liberals are frequently criticizing the government for breaches of civil liberties, imperialism, etc? Excited to see these liberals suddenly go silent if Biden becomes president even though business will continue as usual.
He should be in a home for dementia along with Biden....
I just heard that some Biden allies don't like Kamala because she's too fucking ambitious so I'm thinking she may just be fucking perfect.
This is a way to get  out the White House!  reporting fake information and overhyping a “virus” to put fear into us! It’s ridiculous! This man got unemployment at a record low and this is what he gets? And you expect Biden to fix it? Good luck! #Trump2020
I don’t really care who Biden’s VP pick us but this reasoning is fucken ridiculous. Biden was VP, Bush 41 was VP, Nixon was a VP, Johnson was a VP, Truman was a VP, Coolidge was VP, Gore was a VP who ran, Humphrey was a VP who ran, Mondale, Wallace...
Are Joe Biden’s allies aware that Joe Biden was the last Vice President and is now running for president and seemed to do a perfectly respectable job.

Biden is far from the radical left. The Democrats are just another corporate party, with just a few exceptions. I wish there were more progressives. Biden is definitely not one.
The entire cognitive decline thing (against both Trump and Biden) is offensive. For Trump, it takes away his culpability for his actions and exonerates his supporters against charges of racism. For Biden, it relies on mischaracterizing his stuttering disability, and for both it
Trump is a hot mess. He needs to be a stand up comedian. Biden would put me to sleep!

And just like that... Kamala forgets how she attacked Joe Biden for “being that little girl on the bus”  Dems are nothing more than hypocrites, liars, cheaters, thieves, racists, panderers (especially at election time with POC), selfish people that ONLY care about power &amp; money!
Biden will not lose MN and win WI and MI. If he wins those states, he’ll also win MN.
Y'all really, what is going on w/ Biden? It is getting bad. I am embarrassed for him. Is someone going to step in this late in the game? If so, who and at what point? He is looking and sounding rough! Is he really up to a race? I don't think so.

Uh ew... 🥴 Joe Biden must be the lead investigator on this one
Well I still like to think of myself as an independent, but lately not many  are decent enough to even consider voting for.  Biden in 2020 or this country is shot.
Biden will beat him. He's racist
Only the hardest core cult members will vote for him. Everyone else wants to change the channel. I'll bet most of the White House staff will vote for Biden.
Will do when we elect Biden
Reminder: this is (still) Biden's Democratic Party.
Man, if the Dems are so far left, then I must have missed the memos when Biden voiced support for M4A, UBI, defunding the police, Green New Deal, universal childcare. Have you even read his platform, or are you just guessing?

I have to stay healthy so I can teach my students, research for my faculty, and get as many people to vote as possible. I know there are people out there like this vet and my brother that can be convinced to vote against Trump and for Biden. Enough is enough.

There’s always one of the two worse so the other needs our votes—and there will always be folks who won’t see that. Biden seems to be listening to the progressives
They'll blame us no matter what happens anyway. An overwhelming majority capitulated and voted for a bad candidate anyway and still we got blamed for it.   Vote however you want, if Biden's scared about it he can compromise with us.
Biden’s campaign is ‘suppressing the Hispanic vote’ in Florida, an internal letter claims

This is just to say Joe Biden is a lifelong outspoken opponent of abortion.
Joe Biden argues that we've never had a racist President except for Trump. He is making the case that the US is not susceptible to racism at the highest echelons.  I make the alternative case. The US government was built on racism at the highest echelons.

The fed is delaying what should have happened 2 months ago. They'll stop pumping billions into the market, (which is what's keeping it afloat) after Biden is elected. This is what Repubs. do. They ruin the economy then leave it 4 the Dems 2 clean up the mess.
What do you want to bet the Feds stop propping up the stock market sometime after Biden is elected, the market then crashes and the Dems are blamed(as always)! Typical rotten shenanigans of the Repub. party.
Yes. But I’ve been around long enough to know Joe Biden has done zero to help Americans! Never Cared.
EXCEPT Trump was asking for a *personal* favor, for Ukraine to *announce on American tv* that they would be investigating Biden. His purpose was to influence the election, not because he cared anything about corruption.
Guilty as hell! It’s all on tape from the criminal, Biden’s, mouth!
It's not even that Biden said it, it's that he was ARGUING for the position.  He had concrete commitments about the truth of his assertion that were tied into other commitments about the nation.
Biden saying that Trump was the first racist President reveals a cancer in our American self-understanding.
His election was a joke. He was an embarrassment, coward and a disgrace. He divided, hurt this country and buried businesses all over. Trump did more than Obama ever did and it only took 4yrs. Biden is a fraud, a disgrace, embarrassment and a coward. Hey just like Obama.
Actually I've seen Trump out and about. Where's Biden? That's right hiding in his basement. How stupid are you freaking idiots. Oh and he wasn't impeached either. We all know that was a Democratic kangaroo bs. Proven to be false. Why waste my time. Can't fix stupid. Carry on

#ImVoting4BidenBecause  Cause unlike his supporters, Biden probably forgets he's a pedophile.
Biden is straight up thinks that all of the racial injustices in America, somehow, they've never reached to Presidency.   Joe, racism STARTED with the Presidency. Washington died chasing down one of the slaves he owned.
Biden's argument is not just a stupid comment. We have to understand what it says about our politics, and what kinds of lies must we tells ourselves to sustain the status quo of injustice.
Biden's lie is as bad for our politics as "The Civil War wasn't about slavery" line of argument.    Also, I don't think Joe considers it a lie. I really don't think he knows shit about American history or the office, even the history he was a part of.

As a seasoned nurse, I can honestly say that I’ve never heard of or known of anyone in the medical field that has EVER breathed into the nostrils of a grown man for ANY reason. Joe Biden must have had a new procedure performed on him lol 🙄 at least in his demented mind he did.

And it’s not simply Kamala. Stacey put it out there cause he kept name dropping her almost exclusively. This  been an issue with the Biden VP process. The convo needs to be this notion that his VP can’t outshine him and needs to fall in a place five feet behind him.
So.. I'd like for Biden's VP to be a black woman, and I would prefer Harris. But I'm not sure Biden's campaign, or at least the people he's entrusted to help make this decision, want much more than an alibi.. and that's gonna suck for whomever he chooses. 4/4

Exactly.  Biden's not the one talking about potentially postponing the election.
Biden could very well pick Harris, but I'm not sure how much of a win it is for black women on the representation front if the real priority for the team Biden put together is not what she can bring to the ticket or to the executive, but just how well she knows "her place". 2/
Exactly. Maybe there's other concerns. Hard to say, not being an insider. But I think Harris would add some edge to Biden's campaign that he's really going to need as the race heats-up.

If you did your job we wouldn’t need to scream. Tough questions to Biden like why Maryland are why we scream. Nothing about Ukraine, Hunter, racist past. Plus the ?’s were so staged it was pathetic, he was reading from notes.
Black voters had high favorable view of Bernie but agreed with Biden more on the issues.
Hear me out....  So I got a theory on why Biden hasn’t spent any $$$ in Georgia yet... Mrs. Bottoms would inspire thousands more to show up in Georgia if picked for VP.  Turnout is all it’d take to flip GA blue.  Would be a big boost for Ossoff too.
I hope the Biden administration will investigate. Perhaps the vice president can be tasked with overseeing it. I know Nancy Pelosi will...

Center-left, guaranteed Biden voter here. IMHO that was awful and unfunny, bordering on offensive. Except maybe the bit about eating human souls. Everyone gets old, lots of people get fat. I've enjoyed most of your other stuff though!
How would adding Kamala to Biden's ticket galvanize the Black base during a time of nationwide protest against the police state ? Biden already has issues in this area adding her I fear will only compound that issue. Thats my largest fear about he being the choice.
That POS is named Joe Biden, an unconvicted felon who sniffs little girls.
I'm a big Biden supporter, but he can't make the same mistake as Hilary!  Karen Bass appears to be a "wonderful woman", but we need someone with the spunk to take on the GOP.  Not Bass.

This tweet right here is what the Biden presidency will have to contend with for 8 years. Kamala Harris soaks up his policies with fake black rage, sexism among her twitter fans. Then she'll be encouraged to primary him. Watch. Why isn't she the nominee? They weren't for Biden.

Cool man. Biden or Trump is winning, though. This is the reality. Your presidential vote will have literally zero impact and change nothing.

He will make sure big, beautiful walls are built around the graves to prevent this. And make the Biden administration pay for it.
I just think it’s sad the Biden’s only redeeming feature is that he’s not Trump. It’s a missed opportunity for Biden to be an instrument of change.   If he picks Harris as his running mate, he’s going to have a real struggle, Bottoms would be an infinitely better choice.
Disgusting. First, AfroLatinx exist. And the fact that the 'real pictures' of folks at the end of the add are not and the folks vilified are Stacey &amp; Kamala, in Black &amp; White.  There are good reasons to oppose Biden's immigration record, but not hating on Black folks.
Why are you talking about Biden,when this convo is about trump? Hes racist,plain and simple. As far as black and unemployment, they were mostly low paying jobs and people still lived in poverty
Agreed, the Dems find ways to fuck things up. 1- Most likely Biden will be a 1 term president, so why have an ambitious woman as VP? What’s wrong with that? 2- I trust Kampala Harris to go after anyone trying to take down Biden. Period!
Then you say, “Biden has the AA vote just go for the suburbs”.  Be stupid.  Black people are NOT your friggin gimme vote. Do. Not. Try. It. We are not a guarantee and this is the wrong time to test us.  I’m so tired of the casual racism of white people. I’m so done. I’m done.
According to Politico a couple days ago, she's the pick. Check the date PBT. I want this to happen too. You wanna see a grassroots smear campaign already on fire against Joe Biden for his anti black racism make hell look milquetoast, he'll make Kameleon Harris his VP #FBA 🇺🇸
Right?  let's defeat Biden in 2020!
Despite a pandemic, the patriarchy still feels threatened by strong, smart and ambitious women. I’m just read numerous articles where Chris Dodd and other male Biden donors are smearing Kamala Harris. After 2016, not much really has changed.

You’re assuming that people will vote for Biden and not hold him accountable to make change based on nothing.
That should be the next mantra of the Lincoln Project. Or part of Biden's campaign rhetoric.
This is what Biden will get you for the rest of the country.
With Feinstein and Biden in power, we'd all be eating with Chop Sticks before you know it.
Biden definitely didn't win fair and square. The voter suppression this election cycle was pretty blatant.

My guy, you literally said the challenges for immigrants will be the “same” no matter if Trump or Biden is in office. No DACA vs. DACA sure as hell ain’t the “same.”
Biden can't go wrong with Harris or Duckworth. Bass has made some questionable Castro comments and Rice will just bring Benghazi back into the news.
So you don’t stand for anything basically. I don’t get people who think they can stop the world from spinning. Because guess what man? If Biden or Trump wins, you won’t be able to complain because you chose not to exercise your voice AND the policies will still affect you.
That was no eulogy. It was a damn campaign speech for brain dead Biden.  Shameful.
Trump is horrible, but Biden isn’t offering us anything other than he’s not Trump.  please, list Biden’s virtues.

If he should somehow win, Biden will step down for his VP at some point within his first term. It's obvious he is a puppeted placeholder for a much bigger scheme.
This is who I think Mr. Biden will pick.
You are a legend in your own mind - not ours! Biden 2020!!
Bass is a very risky pick. Really hoping Biden doesn't choose her.
Right. They don’t care as long as Biden is hobbled from the start.
Yeah, see I can't argue with someone who is assuming I like Trump or agree with anything he does. All the things you just said about Trump could apply to Biden, btw.
And we're supposed to believe that a majority of Americans want to vote for Biden and Dems in November? I ain't buying... sell crazy someplace else!
There's a very real possibility that I max out on my allowed contributions to Biden this year. Four years of existential torment will do that to you.
Says the person holding Biden's limp junk.
You said that if Bill Clinton turns out to be a child predator, he will then have something else in common with Joe Biden. How is that not an unambiguous implication that Joe Biden is a child predator?
Dude you literally just used those reasons to justify not voting for Biden (essentially a vote for Trump) as if Trump is not actively doing what you claim to be against. You are insane 😂
House Dems today offer a preview of the Far Left Agenda that’s coming if Americans put Biden-Schumer-Pelosi in power: provisions that weaken national defense, defund the police, encourage illegal immigration and reverse pro-life policies!  voted yes for all of it #GA06
Yikes. The Trump campaign is past the gutter at this point. They are playing psychological warfare and trying to increase Biden's negatives with Hispanic voters by pitting Hispanics vs. African Americans. It's gonna get even worse than this ad. Watch smh.
The media first said Bayh  even after Biden was announced ...
Not even going to touch on the xenophobic Russia and North Korea stuff, but just want to point out that the concentration camps were happening while Biden was VP. And he still hasn't committed to abolishing ICE. Also, do you think white supremacist policies started under Trump?
Nope, they’re both trash. However, seeing as though you’re a Trump supporter, I don’t feel you have the grounds to talk about the praising of men that objectify women. But hey, grab ‘em by the pussy! Like  said, all guys talk like that...
I want Biden’s pick to a Black woman no one expected at this point. Not Rice Not Bass.

What makes you believe that if Joe Biden becomes president millions of jobs will be lost? Do you have anything substantial (a policy proposal) that can attest to this claim?

I’m no fan of Joe Biden but I can first we you in a better place than if Trump stays President
So you can’t substantiate your claim that “Joe Biden is a child predator.”
We just asking you to chill out until after the election...Biden is already the candidate. Unless you trying to DM with your plan to overthrow the government in next couple months 👀
Ever thought he is stalling because he is begging Michelle Obama to step up? Holding out for hope. It would be nice but I don't think it will happen but I would say for Biden, he tried, good effort. Oh, well.
For whatever it's worth #Khive, we've answered Biden's VP polls and supported Kamala and Doug whenever they've held virtual events. It's Biden's final call, but we'll stand by you, whatever happens. 🙂👍
Let’s keep it a stack, we would ALL prefer Bernie. But that is not what’s happening and we can’t change the predicament we’re in. It’s Biden or Trump. This is not about you at all. Any vote for neither is a vote for Trump and y’all need to remember that.

Biden should avoid a potential political litmus test wrt Xinjiang by expressing his earnest support for these sanctions now. Also he can crow later if/when they're relaxed by the administration.
Biden literally wrote the fair sentencing act that corrected that disparity.
...and they do that. The scientists, doctors, epidemiologists, &amp; admin support staff at the CDC are all still doing their work...every day.  They just aren't allowed to amplify or even talk about it.  That will change with a Biden administration, or any other Republican POTUS.
Can’t wait for Biden to announce “to heal the nation, we must look forward, not backward,” some time in January...
And for the record, Rasmussen had Hillary up 2 points. They have Biden up SIX. Considering Trump’s narrow victory in 2016, that current poll almost certainly indicates a Biden win.
Joe Biden didn’t author the entire crime bill. He was largely responsible for the Violence against women’s act and the Assault weapons ban. I literally did a thread about how Biden was against mandatory minimums and 3 strikes. It was a bipartisan bill.

Joe Biden needs Kamala Harris as his VP.
I also mentioned some of the other comments that were made about Kamala being ambitious. But kindly reminded that Biden also ran for President before Obama picked him for VP, so it’s obvious that Joe too was ambitious in becoming President. The lady clerk laughed and said sexism

If Nunez hadn't received any foreign info meant to damage Biden, wouldn't he have just said that?
I really do not think Florida or Ohio will matter this election. The Rust Belt is so fed up with 45 that it has the highest chance of swinging blue like it did for Obama. Biden wins the 3 state sweep there and he's won the election by like 276 electoral votes or some shit.
I would need to compare a ton more pollsters together for an average, but the suburb vote traditionally has been a key indicator of who will win the general election of a president.  Still too close to call. Based on the general data to date, all Biden needs is Wisconsin or NC.
She barely won against a white woman in Atlanta, because her predecessor gentrified the whole city, a practice she continues. If trends continue, she is not the future. Neither is Booker. Harris may have a chance riding Biden coattails

Not much argument with you there. But Biden isn’t interested in being progressive. He’s hell bent on being Obama 2.0. As such I’d just rather have Rice and focus on getting progressives elected to Congress in 2022 and state races.

Hardly surprising that Biden would plagiarize in his campaign...he has done it before...
Yes as far as the public is concerned.  At noon on Inauguration Day I expect him to be long gone on his own. If not I truly believe when the second hand ticks over the secret service will receive orders from President Biden to remove him.
A small reduction in federal grants - at the depth of the Great Recession no less - and GOP would have us believe that's Biden defunding the police.

Biden was poor as a child and worked his way up. Trump doesn’t know the meaning of work. He is a selfish bully. I’m satisfied with him being a one term president. Trump is on his way to destroying the world. I’m ok with who ever Biden picks as VP.
Trump isn’t a good debater. He just insults. Will he get some good digs in on Biden, sure?  Will that make up for his terrible performance as President? Hell no.
I feel like this we gon learn Joe Biden’s pick in a few hours. Ain’t no way he don’t know who is picking by now.
Technically won't be night yet in California when they declare Florida and Pennsylvania for Biden the instant the polls close.
The #demonicdems wasted time and money even before Trump was elected to try and get him on something. They were totally unsuccessful, the unlawful witch hunt started by Obama, Biden, FBI, Congress and still Trump succeeded! #Trump2020LandslideVictory

Do not go there!!!  You must be a trump slave. President Biden was a wonderful Vice President with President Obama and he will be a  knowledgeable President that America needs!!!
Can Biden and new govt correct this?
Biden doesn’t want a show right now. He makes too many speaking mistakes. When your enemy (trump) is destroying himself, don’t distract from that.
🤣🤣🤣 I mean atleast Biden has Vice President on his resume, for the first black president. All I’m saying
In Biden’s basement
Biden Only Needs to Win 3 Battleground States to Defeat Trump – and He's Leading in All 6.
Career Politicians, meaning people who have been in Politics most of their adult lives (Joe Biden)  Have done nothing to contribute to the oppression of Black People (which is the audience that I’m speaking to)  Trump just became President .
Thurmond and Biden may have pushed him on certain aspects of it, but Reagan was never unsupportive of the drug war, even going back to his governorship.
that’s not how that works.. he becomes a private citizen the moment Joe Biden is sworn in as president
Joe biden’s entire selling point is just based in the fact that he’s not Tr*mp and i find that kinda funny
Goodness. Judge “caring” by action taken (policies) Yall are right about one thing- Biden is experienced &amp;proven! The policies &amp;actions in his life long career in politics proves he cares about himself, staying in power, and using his influence to line his/family’s pockets.
Vetoing the drug czar bills was mainly about streamlining buerocracy, not limiting the drug war, though. Reagan was a consistent supporter of the War on Drugs regardless of pressure. And most of the congressional opposition to the drug war was from Democrats to the left of Biden.

Terrible news for Berghoef, but it's great news for Biden and Peters. This district voted for Trump by +16% and for James by +12%.
So smart.
Totally agree which is why I don’t trust the polls that have Biden leading. There are lots of white folks who are embarrassed by trump &amp; will lie to pollsters about not voting for him. But they know he will protect their privilege so they will vote for him, incompetence and all
No the establishment did it. In 2016 and there's a strong suspicion it happened again.But if its a choice between Biden and the least qualified narcissistic authoritarian and racially divisive president in my lifetime its a no brainier I'm going with Biden. TL
I’ve donated to a number of candidates and worked with the ACLU on issues while waiting to see who the nominee would be- Biden was not my first choice and neither was Bernie - but I was committed to vote for either and am committed to getting Trump and the GOP out of Washington.
I’m voting for Biden! trump has destroyed this country.

Yeah I know that Biden is the Nominee but if I had a chance to speak directly to him Speaker Pelosi minority Leader Schumer and  President Obama himself I would look all of them in the eye ans say..no more 2016 rigging and no more last minute phone calls. TL

But lets get something else straight, if Biden wants my vote he has to agree sit down with progressives and see where some of our agenda can be moved forward. The status quo is not going to work anymore. Oh and TL is a sign off line meaning tweet later
State worth watching... potential long shot win for Biden and competitive Senate race 👇
I did not lose any money. It's well known the game was rigged in 2016. A lot of people suspect some type of shenanigans involving Fmr Pres Obama happened this time around. But I'm done with this. Biden is the noninee so I vote for him in November. 1/2
Not my intention- truly can’t understand how you’d believe Biden and Trump are similarly evil.  Bernie wasn’t my choice, but if he were the nominee I would have voted for him.  Biden wasn’t my first choice either, but I will vote for him and work to see he gets elected.
Does Biden even run in 2020 if Rubio had won in 2016?
Add ‘Trump’ to the mix, instead of Biden and all of your ideals will be shattered.
Amazing! BIDEN 2020
1) Get Biden elected  2) If (1), Get Trump's orange ass out of the White House  3) Prosecute the living hell out of the whole Trump cabal, along with their transnational organized crime partners; time to clean house.
So...you gonna retract your condemnation of Joe Biden’s prediction that the orange menace would try to move the election back? 😂
I’m not saying Trump is much better. I just think Joe Biden’s health should be a genuine concern. I can’t wait to write in.
But you know here is the Bottom line and I'm done. Sen Sanders got cheated in 2016. There is a lot of Suspicion that Pres Obama made a phone call to Buttigege and Clobechar to get them to drop out and endorse Biden this time just b4 Super Tuesday. So Biden it is. TL
Had he reacted like a LEADER in late Jan and followed playbook/drill Obama/Biden left and declared a pandemic state of emergency and locked down and mandated social distancing and masks. Would've been like a normal flu season with only 30k dead and yes, reopening by Easter 😑
Karl Rove, Trump hired gun, has advice for Biden, who he is attempting to defeat. And the WSJ is treating it like his regular periodic column.
Yes and I’m proudly voting for Joe Biden!!!!! 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
Yeah all it took was a phone call from President Obama to persuade Budegedge and Clobechar to drop out just before Super Tuesday and endorse Biden. TL

What is Biden’s plan? I have no idea.
They could find actual footage of Biden shooting someone in the middle of 5th avenue and then eating a puppy...  and I would still vote for Biden.   Ok. We all know it was fake anyhow. But still. Nothing these fools can do to change most votes now. All we gotta do is VOTE!
Brian, get educated- Trump was advised by the CDC and Dr. Fauci! Where were you &amp; the media when Obama &amp; Biden did nothing while 57 Million Americans were infected by the H1N1 Flu? CDC website actually shows higher numbers than these...
So yall mad at bell hooks for owning property. Mad at Angela Davis for saying vote for Biden. Laughing at Meg for being shot, and y’all cancel Gayle and Oprah every other week. There is a pattern here🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️Just saying. Just saying
Biden's plan doesn't call for that either.  And no one is going to go for another "if we lock down again for another X # of weeks we'll be ok".  We heard that before and the goal posts kept getting moved.  Not to mention no proof that works long term.
Impossible to accomplish with the current leadership. Job one on Biden’s first day
Pretty much anyone other than Biden is LOL
How many 1000s died because Pelosi said in February to ignore Trump and got to China Town? What about Cuomo killing thousands of elderly by forcing homes to accept Covid patients? What about Biden calling Trump xenophobic for the China ban Trump declared in January?
It will be so nice to not have to worry what crazy things our President tweets each day once you win Mr. Biden! We can count on you to restore honor and honesty to that office.
This will be released on a Friday night.  Either this Friday or within 2 weeks.  It’s meant to sway the votes and doubts of those voting for Biden.  It will definitely be lies.  Basically, the same scenario they did with Hillary.  please be extremely aware and ready.

If someone wears a mask over mouth but not nose, are they voting for Trump or Biden?
Google Biden from decades ago, like when he was trying to stop bussing to integrate schools or fought against attempts to reduce fed funding of segregated schools or when he used the n-word in Congress.
If Biden wins he’ll have no challenges.  His VP and cabinet will launch the 25th week one.
I know, right? Hates Biden &amp; Obama, anybody that's not Bernie. SMGDHID
Remember the Obama - Biden duo who did nothing while the H1N1 Flu infected 57 Million Americans? Where was the media then?
This is some Nazi shit right here. I want to see prosecutions when Biden takes office.
Does the same people do Biden, polosi, shumars tweets
You need to be too! Unless you want higher taxes; open borders; to pay heathcare for immigrants; the end of Medicare; more crime, lawlessness, rioting, looting, burning; and socialism! Poor Biden is losing his faculties and if elected will be replaced w/in a year by a loser VP!
Keep dreaming! Poll says 77% of Americans are fearful for their families safety from rioters and the far left defund the police craziness. How does that possibly get scatter brain Biden elected? 😂

Joe Biden weighs in around March 2021: Chili’s! Build Baby Back Ribs. Better.
Even if Biden's picks a Wasp, his chances remain slim.  After Trump, only another Trump can ever win the presidency.
Dems are pushing mail in voting so when DJT wins they can challenge the result. Chaos provides them opportunties for mischief. They know they can’t win a free and fair election. Biden is a shell. Nobody wants Biden.

Well, when you factor-in the margin-of-error...  Biden is still beating the living hell out of Trump in NH, right now.  But, given that failure is NOT an option in this election, let's continue fighting for Biden as if he's 10 points down.
I don’t have to project anyone’s anything. I just have to watch one of his “appearances” lately. The stumbling over words, the confusion, being led by the arm like a patient—this is not the same Biden as 4 or 8 years ago, and everyone knows it.

Honestly, I really like it! 🙂 👍 If Biden went this route I'd be very happy
Yeah I agree. Bass is a little too far left for most “normies” but she’d definitely be my pick bc I think Biden will largely be a puppet figure and the VP will be calling most of the shots
You may not be settling but lot of us are.Most progressives/young folk dislike Biden bc of his extremely regressive past,inadequate platform,&amp;poor temperament. We may recognize importance of Trump losing gen election,but we hate that its to Biden rather than someone way better.

I am just glad Biden didn’t say that dumb racist bullshit Clinton just said.
Here's How Biden's Possible VP PIcks Stack Up on Foreign Policy
He can’t. There’s a reason Biden’s interviews have been limited and extremely scripted.
It’s may be important for some people to strategical vote Biden in swing states in the gen election, but please stop scapegoating Sanders supporters for 2016.
You really think we’d have 151K dead Americans if Biden was in office? Not even trumpers believe that. You guys just don’t wanna admit you were conned by an incompetent scam artist. Is protecting your privilege that important? Is owning the Libs worth 151K dead fellow citizens?
* Knowing that he's likely to lose, Trump thinks he can manipulate a large Biden margin to call the election illegitimate  I think the 2nd would not be an effective strategy for him. The first is certainly possible, but usually requires close margins to hide detection.
I don't miss Obama. At all. I can't believe he was ever elected. His haughtiness &amp; glibness carried him. What good was he? He all but destroyed health ins., killed Americans, sowed racial enmity, fomented victimhood ... but I guess, per Biden, he's "clean &amp; articulate" &amp; Black.

There’s a lot of debate on the TL about whether to vote for Biden but my two cents? I became a Democrat because of abortion rights and live in a state where they’ll disappear if the federal government doesn’t protect them. No one should be forced to have a baby. Please vote Biden
We also got electoral college so it makes sense for people who hate Biden to vote 3rd party in solid blue/red states. Now swing states are different story,&amp; people should weigh strategic value of their vote.  Btw,there are lot of underprivileged people who refuse to vote Dem.

Sorry but I'm not a toddler. I'll vote for Biden but will be in the coalition of progressives to keep the pressure on him once he takes office. TL
‘Donald Trump loves to talk and talk and talk — but after 3 and a half years of big promises what do the American people have to show for all the talk?’ — Joe Biden railed against Trump’s broken promises in his economy speech Thursday  01
You were saying? I believe you owe Joe Biden an apology.
both Biden and Trump are anti-protest and anti-china and anti-lockdown and anti-UBI and anti-medicare-for-all. what the FUCK is the difference on shit that MATTERS
‘Donald Trump loves to talk and talk and talk — but after 3 and a half years of big promises what do the American people have to show for all the talk?’ — Joe Biden railed against Trump’s broken promises in his economy speech Thursday  04
I remember when the far left made this argument about Biden debating Bernie... how’d that turnout ?
You really want to discuss who’s dishonest? Please step down you narcissistic, racist excuse of a human. You will go down in history as the President who got more Americans killed due to your mishandling of this pandemic. Keep Americans alive again...Biden 2020!🇺🇸
You are right.   He may even be wire tapping Biden just like Obama did him.   They all stink.
Ok, that's not good news but Barr did own the libs the other day. That's just as important. Stop being so negative never Trumper.   Go vote for Biden then. That number would be 139%.
Sounds good, hopefully you're not voting for either one of those rapist authoritarians then. When biden treats protesters the same way trump and your buddy Obama that is following you, what will you say then?
I think we could easily accommodate the #Trump travel plans.   How about a 7 PM Biden call from Georgia? That ought to do it.
You sound like a grade schooler. Let’s take a poll on truth, decency and honesty. Or just show the current poll numbers between Biden and Trump. That will work.
Oh so Biden will end the war in Afghanistan stop the drone strikes and stop supporting Saudi Arabia's genocidal war in Yemon? I hope he will. TL
Cavuto is Stumping for Biden right now. What a Cock Muncher.  No offense to the Cock Munchers out there.
😂😂😂😂 keep telling yourself that. Biden 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸
Yeah you know what else is irritating and unpleasant? 500K people per year going bankrupt because of medical bills. 36-45K per year dying because of lack of preventative medical care. Universal health care puts a huge dent in those #s but VP Biden is against it. He just wants 1/2
DONALD TRUMP: Biden wants to defund the police. CHRIS WALLACE; Sir, he does not. DONALD TRUMP: Look, he signed a charter with Bernie Sanders CHRIS WALLACE: It says nothing about defunding the police.  Full interview at FoxNewsSunday   #DontDie
Will Biden be accepting the nomination at the end? This year’s DNC is a drag.
I will hold my nose and vote for Biden. Just like I held my nose and voted for Clinton in 96 and my reward.... the Monica Lewinsky scandal and impeachment. Hopefully VP Biden won't get into a mess like that. TL
You put a good argument for  Democrats to follow about how Biden/Obama really did fix the economy after they got in didn’t make any difference in your argument that they did NAFTA rid of our jobs are manufacturing jobs u don’t need to be devils advocate cnn is
So am I. So who's for convincing Biden to consider universal health care, a living wage, decriminalization of marijuana, and ending the foreign wars?. TL
When she was CA attorney general? Look if Biden wants to pick her instead of Nina Turner or Barbara Lee fine that's his choice let's just be clear about who Senator Harris is. 2/2 TL

Hey  where’s that apology to Biden? You know, for that dangerous conspiracy theory that the President confirmed today. 🤷‍♂️🥴
Me too, from Joe Biden
Totally classless, the Former Pres taking an opportunity to politicize at a funeral.  Similar to the classless behavior of SOH Pelosi carrying on animated talk with Biden at Congressman Lewis’ flag draped coffin during his lie in state at the Capitol Rotunda.  Classless! #maga
Sure I'll hold my nose and vote for Biden. TL
You must go into the metro areas to see BIDEN signs. They are there.  Or those signs that say 2020 Any Functional Adult
Wow. A campaign speach for a candidate that can’t speak for himself at a funeral. Disgraceful. I’m not sure who should be more ashamed, Obama for doing it or Biden’s handlers/Dem party that asked him to. Sad for the Lewis family.
AIGHT NAH! Bill and Biden are too comfortable speaking on black issues like this for me. But like I said, I’m clocking out and ignoring the world.
F&lt;&gt;k Obama. He’s desperate for Biden to win, to stop the unveiling of his chief role in #Spygate Obama uses John Lewis eulogy to preview his Biden campaign strategy
Has "Settle For Biden" Become The Official Democratic Campaign Slogan For 2020
We will get  the next best thing when we cast our vote for Joe Biden! But we MUST VOTE and honor Rep. John Lewis's memory! Early vote, mail-in ballots or go to the polls....JUST VOTE as if our lives depend on it and they do! #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
I see a way  could have one more shot at being President Of the USA! Biden picks Clinton for a running mate. The rest is yet to be seen.
I don't think so.   It's Trump who is irresponsible, NOT Joe Biden.
That's the topic. (Folks aren't suggesting young people vote so that they can vote for Trump.) No one is suggesting voting as a pure moral good. They suggest it to get Trump out of office. And in turn, replace it with Biden's platform.  I am going to vote for Biden no matter what
And there it is... Systems that exist EVERYWHERE ON EARTH are trash lol. Took a minute to flush that out. I thought you were ineptly trying to argue Biden's policy was somehow social democratic, when you're actually against social democracy.
Voting certainly matters. But I really think there are a lot of folks (not directed towards you) who are missing how disenchanted Leftist, Socialist-leaning, abolitionist minded voters are.   Biden has to have policies that speak to that.
Because that's who and what Biden is and who he represents. TL
That won’t be possible until 2024 and Biden won’t remember who he is by then. Can only remember now on occasion!
I never said I owned it. I'm just getting tired of seeing the establishment pissing on us and calling it rain. I'll support Biden even if he picks Senator Kamilla (should have indicted Steve Manuchin but the money got in the way) Harris. If/ when he wins we start negotiating. TL
Good thing Biden and YOU will lose in November! Otherwise, you alone will destroy this country with your dumba*s legislation, hate and racism. You'll make race relations worse than Obama, kill the economy, and cause hundreds of thousands to lose their jobs! #TRUMP2020
Why? Are you afraid your name end up on these criminal indictments that the AG will be dropping or you just trying to protect Comey Page Strzok McCabe, Brennan, HRC and Obama/Biden.
This is a coward act. Has nothing to do with INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT votes. It’s a fear that Joe Biden will win. COWARD!!
With Biden running? Nah
This election has gotten so boring that I started wondering what the map would look like if Trump were the one leading nationwide by 10 points instead of Biden. I just applied the uniform swing to the 2016 results for most of these. Thoughts?
I'll eat my words! BUT: “The blinders have been taken off,” Biden told supporters recently during a virtual fundraiser...“Because of this Covid crisis, I think people are realizing, ‘My Lord, look at what is possible. Look at the institutional changes we can make.’”
Oh DNC &amp; Biden will just get their radical extremist groups  Antifa/BLM/BlackPanthers &amp; Nation of Islam to protect them.
With BIDEN, American citizens can feel safe in their own cities again, maintain their healthcare, look forward to a brighter future!! #WorstPresidentInHistory #NobodyLikesTrump
If Michelle Obama was Joe Biden’s VP, you can just hand him the presidency.
EXACTLY!!! which makes no sense, there's evidence that  Rice &amp; Biden have committed FELONY crimes, yet b/c they are running for POTUS &amp; VP they can't be touched, which means our own govt will allow KNOWN CRIMINALS to run our country. UNBELIEVABLE
All Sullivan has to do is wait Trump out. Once Biden brings in his new DOJ team, they will surely renew charges and send Flynn to jail.
Continue to push fossil fuels that destroy our planet instead of working like Biden to heal our planet. #WorstPresidentEver
Have been saying this the entire time, that's how it was suppose to be with HRC in 2016, everybody knew she wasn't capable mentally/physically to run this country, she was just going to be the FACE of the Presidency while BHO ran his 3rd term thru her, same here w/Biden.
And zero words from the Trump/Barr DoJ on any investigation into how Jeffrey Epstein was allowed to "commit suicide" and the security video of those entering his cell got "accidentally destroyed".  We heard more about Biden's son getting a job...when that boogeyman wad useful.
1. Please don't quote Vox. 2. You still haven't addressed the continued existence of the for profit insurance industry.  3. So everyone above poor people are still bound to transactional healthcare?  4. Do you know anyone from another country? None of them would want Biden's plan
Only thing ima say about this trump Biden shit is that tbr trump never put any laws into purposely and specifically put black people in jail and prisons fuck trump too though
Seems like Obama helped the party set its priorities for the first year in a Biden administration.

A fair election would have a debate but the left knows Biden wouldn't survive it..
That hurts Biden. He’s going to fix this mess.
Important to note that if elected Biden would be over a much more liberal party than when Obama was elected
Has "Settle For Biden" Become The Official Democratic Campaign Slogan For 2020?
Make all Biden's campaign events Obama giving eulogies.
Man what (btw I could have foggy memory but didn’t Biden suggest this and you made fun of him for it)?
you really think biden is gonna win
Okay well I suppose you think another 4 years of Trump would be no different in any way than 4 years of Biden. You sound dumb and unread.
Biden has betrayed his moderate backers by embracing Sanders’s spending and Warren’s antibusiness bent, writes Phil Gramm ⁦ #leftwinger #socialist #americawakeup #americadeservesbetter #BidenPledgesToSocialism
Makes you wonder if President Joe Biden will be the same way
Where does Joe Biden go for apologies from Ari Fleischer and Jonathan Turley? Both publicly sneered whe Joe predicted that trump would try to delay the election.
The law won’t be at isssue, civil unrest will. You are missing Biden’s entire point.
I wonder if the Democrats ever thought about reelecting President Obama?Instead of VP Biden
you'da won  biden will likely lose  #VoteThirdParty
Pete shouldn’t have been running either. He got way too much attention for what he actually ended up being. He flamed out. There were a lot of Dem candidates this time that shouldn’t have been running. No planning or strategizing over the past 3 years now we end up with Biden
We get this speech from Obama then have to default back to Trump or Biden ☹
The same folks who believed #Obama was golfing during #Katrina  instead of being at the office will also believe that #Biden has this authority...a bunch of dumbasses
Not to mention that there are other idiots out here that are "Ridin' For Biden." As if he is any better than Trump.
We Voting For Biden,  Pack Your bags Mister
"Biden’s support is largely driven by an anti-Trump sentiment, with 55 percent of Biden’s supporters in Pennsylvania saying they are voting against Trump, not for the former vice president."
You must be referring to Biden.
No surprise here! Republicans Reject Trump’s Suggestion to Delay Election, Something He Cannot Do
May surprise you because even Biden's narrative won't support the opinions being protested. The DNC knows their event will be protested otherwise they wouldn't have hired the departments in the first place.
Unbelievable how we went from Obama to possibly the worst president in US history. Well, I take that back.  Obama was black and Hillary was a woman. If Biden wins, it will prove both of those factors to be true.
Anti-Trump is pro Biden.
At end of the day the reason why we ended up with Biden and not someone like Bernie is because a large amount of the American voting block are fearful/unsure of socialism or policies that could be perceived as such like M4A. Gotta show those folk Joe won’t really fix shit either
what would happen if biden wins??
Dear President Trump your talking about the voting and you should be doing others things with your time.Your loosening votes to Biden for not keeping your word.Take care of your people first.
#Biden2020 Momentum! Only 247 People Are Watching Joe Biden Attempt to Read a Teleprompter in His Basement  via
The most important thing for Democrats is to be supportive and unite behind Joe Biden. We must support his  candidacy no matter who he chooses to be his VP... Being divisive is what dumbass donald and the lame ass GOP wants us to do...
Any good threads of pushback on Dr. Angela Davis' 'endorsement' of voting for Biden? Just trying to be better about diving into opposing viewpoints
I don't think.  It's obvious Joe Biden has dementia and other underlying mental health issues.
I knew people were going to bring this up so I already mentioned it earlier. I don’t like obama or biden either. I’d love to see those statistics. and by the way, having oprah as VP would be a bad idea. hear what you’re saying. she is not qualified.
If foreign leaders who are appalled at America are fine with Harris as Biden's VP, it's clear they do not really care at all about America's issues and only care about America protecting them from the Slavs or "yellow people" (no offense intended).
I agree, I’m voting Biden.  John McCain was a child of God.....will not mock his death.  Not God like at all.
Since 2016, we have lived through one conspiracy theory after the other from Right wing nuts, AKA the GOP, Fox personalities AND especially the emperor, Trump. Biden is right because there is no bottom to where Trump and his minions can sink.
That's a good point. I don't believe FDR nor LBJ were considered radicals. The latter, at least, got a lot done because he was in the Senate for a long time - which bodes well for Biden. He has the relationships to get stuff done
Joe Biden is rocking the ads! “We’ve never had an empty seat, and we certainly won’t in Oklahoma.” Trump says....  #DontDie
Did you forget Obama &amp; Biden did nothing about the H1N1 for six months while 57 Million Americans were infected? Though fewer deaths than Covid 19, the Swine Flu infected 16X more people than the current Covid total!
This woman is a rare talent.  Opinion | If Biden wants to double down on a ‘third Obama term,’ he should pick Susan Rice
I never said I would vote for Biden. Whoever is running must earn my vote. I refuse to vote for anyone who promised mass deportations, lower spending, sign EO ending birthright citizenship, never fund planned parenthood, etc and outright lied. My lord, he wants amnesty now.
Joe Biden is getting ready to name his running mate, which he is promising will be a woman. Although the ladies on his list have extensive qualifications, the one whose hair smells the best will get the job. #jokes #HappyThursday #Monologue #LateNight
I dont even know how we can say one party is greater than another..... Democrats were called Dixiecrats and still got Clintons and Biden weird asses on the roster.....
You are a Biden/Harris supporter.
Imagine calling yourself a revolutionary and a radical then voting for Joe Biden
joe biden dead looks like a reptile
Biden’s plan has more money for cops in it.
We don't have to watch Biden. He's trustworthy.   It's you people we have to keep our eyes on bc you're stealing the country blind and lying to the American people every minute of the day.
Yes Biden the strong, well spoken leader who worked with segregationist, helped with the crime bill that gave harsher sentences to minorities, and never knows if he’s in Ohio or Iowa is the answer
Plus the older woman in his Biden wants to defund police is WHITE
it’s genuinely very gross to me that everyone is closing out their eulogies for John Lewis by telling people to “vote” broadly, because they know it would be grotesque to specifically namedrop Biden
Great to know - so if Biden has a gaffe you'll have the same reaction?  You can't have it both ways.  And sorry - his jokes ain't funny. These kinds of answers (there have been many of them today) are an insult to all Americans.
Are left-wing social medias using their monopolistic power to rig the outcome of America's 2020 Elections?  It's as blatantly obvious as Joe Biden's growing dementia!
"And yet, Rump trails Biden in nearly every statewide poll in FL at the moment, having fallen behind in the state since March. His deficit there appears to be growing. A recent poll from Quinnipiac found that Biden, the former vice president, had a 13-point lead over Mr. Trump."
✋🏼✋🏼✋🏼✋🏼✋🏼 Voting for Biden in November!!!!
Y’all didn’t say this about Biden, and here he is running for President. We have sexism and racism all wrapped up in one. A damn twofer.
Crazy how Kamala is “a cop”—has no authority over police btw—but Val Demmings was *actual* police chief, Keisha is mayor—hires &amp; fires police—and Biden wrote &amp; funded the majority of crime enhancements...I support Ayanna Presley for POTUS but...y’alls critique of Kamala is weird
Vote for Joe Biden like your life depends on it in November because it literally does.
He gonna be reelected..wait watch and see..no enthusiasm for biden

Surely even Pence must realize that Biden, as a former Senator and VP, has no authority to call in the Guard.
Far more likely than Trump being able to delay the election is the Democratic House ignoring the Electoral College (should Trump win) and simply installing Joe Biden.
Trump, Biden, China, Russia...all have the ability to put something like that together and all sides wholeheartedly believe the others will do it.

You have the ability to vote for the president. Biden and Trump are at odds over the policy. Let the most votes win.
I take Biden at his word and if you didn’t think Obama was leftist enough, you will be very happy with Biden. Although if you are anywhere near the center, you might be very unhappy. This is just my opinion, everyone is entitled to theirs.

45 Cause the alternative would be the end of our Country and the restart of the 16 year plan to destroy America. Only, this time they wouldn't drag it out to 16yrs. I'd give us 4 months if Biden wins.
of more Fascism. Like I said, pushing the party left will be a gradual process. Having a fucking Fascist as president does nothing but slow that process down. We can bully Biden into conceding on 1 or 2 issues, with Trump we cant do that
Also, “even worse” than Hillary isn’t a bad thing. One because she performed very well with those demographics, and two, Joe is doing far better with white voters so far.  Biden’s polling right now is on par with 2008 Obama. An 8-9 point lead is about as good as it gets.
I love seeing you waste your time on this trivial shit while Biden kicks your ass.
I wonder why Hilary and Biden aren't at John Lewis' funeral.
Please tell me how we fight neoliberalism by saying he's equal to Trump. You make no sense. Neoliberalism leads to Fascism yes, BUT WE HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED AT FASCISM. Biden being in office at least guarantees us 4 years without fascism. Which is objectively better than 4 years
yet he is getting his ass kicked by biden   how do u square that?  the thing is the majority of americans prefer biden over the corrupt incompetent racist rapist lying con man currently inhabiting the white house   trump’s latest con job is about to be ended
Guess you’ve missed the numerous times Biden has been in public since it doesn’t fit your narrative?

Same situation in the country, but with Trump beating Biden handily, we all know this tweet wouldn't exist right?!?
Where's the REAL evidence claiming Biden is a child molestor? I want police reports, charges, the works. Not some probably doctored photo to make it look like it is. Go on. I'm waiting.
Basically you are showing me a photo of Biden with no prove of him being a molestor whatsoever let alone any charges whatsoever. That is not a mirror of truth but of lies dude. You are seriously drinking too much of the cool-aide. But I'll give you a chance:
Biden's Civil War
Three months ago, Biden warned that tRump may try to postpone election; Trump campaign dismissed that idea
Joe Biden is a centrist. And people who think they’re making money because of Trump are falling for pretty flimsy rhetoric.
If Biden is elected, how many days go by before his VP and cabinet launch the 25th?
Didn't Biden used to be a school teacher..no?  Administrator??? No...Dean of Harvard??..well, just wait a while...its a laugh a day unless he gets elected...I hope Biden follows that guideline.
Biden is nothing but a puppet. He’s completely demented and will not be running the show.
You’d think Trump beats Biden on most of these issues.
Yup. Have to agree. It’s going to be a bloodbath of epic proportions that Canada will loan Saskatchewan and Manitoba as blue states. 450 EVs baby!   Love these accurate polls. Why even deep dive when Biden is consistently up 10-15?!?! They can’t all be wrong!!!
If Obama was the President for the pandemic, ten times of the people will die! Check how Biden and the newspapers say about the travel ban! Use your brain! Bro!
Biden isn’t on offense or defense. He’s not even playing
He is. He’ll be crying when Biden wins Arkansas
This ☝🏿but Biden is going to win by 10-15. Utah will be blue
It's always the trash that doesn't know the difference between Koreans and Chinese. If you wanna publicly say you vote for Biden, do your thing. But you should know that when you make racist statements like this, it makes you look worse, not better. Peace Mario.
Nah. 440 EVs for Biden bc his enthusiastic, energetic, transformative candidacy will bring out ppl in epic proportion. Utah’s in play too.

Is she still going on about something? She had no idea Trump set aside money for schools to reopen and when I gave her facts, her brain couldn't handle it, and she blocked me. I'm telling you man, Biden didn't make a gaffe when he said "truth" over facts. That was a declaration.
Actually, that would be an even better ticket. Biden probably hasn't even thought about that....until now. Trump can only hope not. #MercyRule
The GoP is very much pro birth, not pro life. Or they wouldn't work so hard against taking care of the children around them who are suffering. No candidate is perfect. But I will be voting for Biden. Trump HAS to go.
Plus, Biden needs youth on the ticket as he will possibly / likely be one term. Another 70+ year old on the ticket would be a mistake
Probably. If Trumps leading expect to randomly find 200K Biden ballots in a trunk of a car
They had a personal relationship before he became POTUS. That's what happens. That was probably the basis for all the corrupt action taken by Obama/Biden in Russia probe. All the things you're saying are anecdotal with no way to prove them.
Nah, Biden up 25 according to Quinnipiac
My point is, I understand people's hatred towards Trump because you guys are good people and you wouldn't say it the way he says it. But his intentions aren't evil. And if you are to choose between Biden or Trump, you've got to make the right decision. You only have ONE vote.
For all you Biden people, imagine him sitting across from Xi Jinping or Ki, Jongun. Do you think he's going to be able to fight for OUR country? Negotiate business that benefits the US? Come on... he'll probably mistake one for the other!
Interesting. I have no idea who she is, but apparently  is very well respected in Congress   - whoever you choose, please make sure your VP pick will help and not hurt the ticket (as we have seen other campaigns do)
Delusional? Did I imagine what happened in 2016? You know, when ALL the polls had Hillary winning by a "landslide"? You know, just like now with Biden. How did this work out again? Remind me because apparently I'm in need of a psychiatrist.
Yet you forget that Biden called Trump xenophobic for closing the Chinese border....
I’m definitely voting Biden, now bc Lindsey Graham and Biden are buddies.
And you want Joe “you ain’t black” Biden to win?????
Yes. 500 EVs for Biden bc Orange Man Bad!
Nah. Sarah says it’s over. Biden will get 500 EVs guaranteed
But Quinnipiac has Biden up 15! Your poll is wrong
But Biden has it locked. Don’t even vote. 450+ EVs. Ask Sarah.

If he didn't care for my family, why are his policies doing everything to help them? And if Obama/Biden cared so much, why did he do NOTHING to help us? You want to pay higher taxes, go ahead. But I would rather vote for someone who has PERSONAL flaws and pay less taxes.
And if it does to you, that's fine. But when it's just you and the ballot, think about that for a moment. Maybe he's a bad person. But are YOU willing to pay MORE in taxes to keep him from being president again? Because Biden has already said he's going to raise taxes.
500 EVs for Biden. He gets Manitoba too.
That’s bc Biden is up 16!

If Biden wins and the Dems get the Senate, we will become a banana republic.
Biden is even more ahead of where Clinton was at this point. Duh.
Polls showing that Biden and Trump are tied in the Georgia polls at 47%. This is a state that has been Republican for the last 8 years. Americans are showing they are NOT satisfied with the way Trump has handled the Coronavirus, race relations, the economy and his poor leadership
Polls showing that Biden and Trump are tied with 47% in Georgia. This state has been Republican for the last 8 years. Other states are showing that people are tired of the Trump rants and foolishness over the Coronavirus, race relations, the economy and inept leadership!
Why bizarrely? They(with Sanders) have convinced a generation of young people that the most revolutionary thing you could do is vote Biden. They, like BLM, are useful tools of the Dem party.
Maybe we can turn Georgia blue!! We’re working on it!
I think Hannity is being a bit unfair tonight. He posed the question “What has Biden done in 48 years?” I say c’mon Sean, it’s ONLY 48 years, give the guy a chance!
Neal- like many of my friends, I’m feeling pretty nervous about this one. We all need to put our heads together and figure out what we do next if Biden wins. I wish there was a way to get at our 401k and IRA money without feeding the potential next administrations. Leave USA???
Yeah it does, tRump has called BLM terrorist organization, he just waiting for RBG to die and you wanna say Biden/Harris is equal to tRump. GtFOH.
Bernie supporters are worse than Trump supporters with their delusions. My goodness. Biden won because more people, by far, voted for him. Not any DNC conspiracy. Socialism isn’t popular here, maybe try an actual socialist country if that’s what you want .
Is it me? Or was it obvious to everyone, Biden pre arranged which reporters he would call on, what  the questions were going to be,  and was able to answer with notes. At his presser yesterday.
Always.  I haven't caught you replying to any of the lies so I can't say why you support Biden. I don't get it, but again, that's your right. Don't know your age, big I was once a Bernie supporter in my 20s, so I can sort of relate.
Whoa, here's a level of Kool-Aid drinking I haven't come across in awhile. Lets debate, shall we? You can't use anything by Fox News, OANN, whataboutisms or say the words Democrats, Hilary, Biden or Obama. Now, tell me why the smartest people in the world should not be in charge.
Trump is correct. They are way behind, but, most of Europe is afraid of a large militarized German Army. Maybe Biden can strike a deal where they can put money towards US &amp; Canada budgets that defend Europe? Non compliance leaves them vulnerable to demagogues like Trump.
I'll feel safe if Biden has a national lead in votes of 4%+. Nervous between 3-4%. Anything within 3% and I think we see a 2016 repeat
Also. Not sure why people are getting mad at Biden for condemning people who take advantage of protests to riot and break shit.
Joe Biden's election fund!
Unsurprisingly, people on the left are freaking out because Biden isn't pro-anarchist (despite condemning the DHS for the unlawful assault on peaceful protesters)...
Milf Coded Joe Biden
Hold up, wasn't Biden up by 5 gazillion points yesterday? 🤔
Apparently, she has Biden's ear on matters of the economy. I hope she gets her old job back if she wants it. I know we need to keep the Senate so whatever they think is best is fine by me. There's just no way to satisfy everyone. Some will remain unhappy no matter what's decided.
Yeah they were.   I dont hate EW. I voted 4 her n the general as did a lot of women I know that live n ATL &amp; we're not all white either.   But now that Biden is our candidate,  it would unconscionable 2 not have a WoC on the ticket.
I normally agree with my fellow  writer  but this time I must dissent. This election is about one man: Donald J. Trump. Biden may as well be a potted plant.
Added to Harris’ Woke Resume and faxed to Joe Biden’s front porch.
Yes, but its not going to be with Biden!
That’s BS. Biden has no cognitive issues &amp; Trump is the same he’s always been - a delusional narcissist (well, that may be an oxymoron).
Calling this Biden's America is some top shelf projection. Trump doesn't want to win an election. He wants to steal one.
I prefer Val Demings for VP and Kamala for AG...but it doesn't matter. I'd vote for Biden's toenail as long as we get Trump out.
No, I'm Biden. Period.
A is unlikely with Biden keeping a low profile.
BY VOTING FOR BIDEN AND PUTTING TRUMPY IN PRISON!!
Things can change if: A. Biden MAJORLY screws up.  B. Trump regains trust on handling the pandemic.
LMAO at least you caught yourself!! The only difference is some of Biden's are like a minute long hahaha
Barr is playing the long game &amp; working for the #KochNetwork. He's only protecting trump bc they want 4 more yrs to finish stacking the court with young right wing justices.   Omg, how much more do you need to get excited about voting for Biden? He's pro democracy. Repubs arent!
"And Biden, who will turn 78 weeks after the November election, has said it’s critical his running mate is ready to be president from the first day."  The plan is to get him elected and then, *insert cause of death here*  The VEEP will be POTUS, not him.
Biden: I will be more pro-war than Trump! The state of modern liberalism.
Correction: someone is going to tell Biden who his running mate is next week
What does that have to do with her ability to govern? Why does that matter about her? What about Biden’s lineage?
No surprise, he is an obnoxious, loud mouth, lying POS.    Falsely Accuses Biden Of Spying On Trump  via
I am so concerned about the extreme divisions that produced this joke of a  hearing. I sincerely hope that Biden is elected and can pull us together
The reporting today about Biden, Dodd, and Kamala Harris makes me think that the people around Biden are very unenthusiastic about the idea of a black woman as a VP, and given their willingness to humiliate Abrams, and comments today, it's probably a bad job.
Obama and Biden did ZERO COVID testing!
stop eating our own-judicial appoints are TOO important!! Pick a side-support Biden OR allow lifelong trump policies. TODAY, there’s no inbetween. Many in FLA &amp; other states will lose their VOTE. #RIPGOP

Bad ass!! Thank you!
There will be no debates. Biden won't do any interviews. He'll only campaign from his basement.
...Joe Biden is offering his own presidential campaign hats "MASHA" ...Making America a Shit Hole Again...
I enjoy your enthusiasm for Biden even if I don't share it. So I will wholeheartedly agree, I am happy with anyone he picks. He had the job, he is qualified to pick the VP, that is that. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
My 21-year-old is voting. He knows it's the only way to get Trump the f**k out of office. He has some friends who are Bernie Bros who don't want to vote for Biden though.
Sounds exactly like what the Left will do if they Trojan-horse Biden into the White House...
How many doctors have seen a legit death caused by Marijuana?  Yet, it remains in the same federal class as heroin.  And Biden calls it a gateway drug that needs more studies. Trump needs to push decriminalization, obviously the FDA cannot be trusted.
You do realize that  is a nut case. He is not and never was a Conservative. You may be a conservative but you have no one that you can vote for. Biden is at least a moderate and he is not stupid and self aggrandizing.
By the way. We are on the same side. I will vote for Biden. I was a Conservative for many years. I cannot align myself with the McConnell group that can’t call themselves Republican. I am a law and order person, but under the Constitution with integrity.
You don’t get to have it both ways moron. It’s either Trump’s America and he’s in charge or he has to STAY OUT OF CITIES for you to put the blame on Democrats that run the cities. You are pointing out Trump’s America and even suggesting it’s Biden’s is beyond stupid.
Am I the only one thinking there's no way Joe Biden knows how to retweet?
Both political parties are stupid and bad as they both weaponize human rights and other important topics to bring the other down. Next time someone says only Republicans are bad, just make sure they know Biden said “if you don’t vote for me you aren’t black.”
I'm no biden supporter but this is how u honor and respect a great person trump is NO PRESIDENT!   #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
It's sad, really. It's why they're so misinformed. They just block it out when you provide facts. I'm telling you, Biden didn't make a gaffe, when he said "we choose truth over facts". It was a declaration.
Voting for Biden so... yeah. In case I forgot to say it today: Resign. You’re an embarrassment.
To not take a position on Trump’s re-election is to take a position. You don’t need to be a Biden surrogate, but to say Trump’s re-election isn’t a big deal is just silly
Senator Biden: Damage, vandalize, or federals who agitate or protest anarchist courthouse in... where am I? Or any states and cities who prosecute prisons will be federalized under our recent buildings &amp; monuments year. Minimum ten statues re-enacted.
You don’t get to have it both ways moron. It’s either Trump’s America and he’s in charge or he has to STAY OUT OF CITIES for you to put the blame on Democrats that run the cities. You are pointing out Trump’s America and even suggesting it’s Biden’s is beyond stupid.
... and the strategy to avoid the debates begins to show itself out in the open.
Biden win in a landslide? 😂😂😂😂😂😂.. taking a breath...ok 😂😂😂😂😂😂.
Group is quietly planning for what happens if Trump-Biden election is contested
I'm confused. Are you saying that Trump staged this to show us what will happen if Biden gets elected? So none of this is actually real?
Joe Biden - 17 Minutes Of Joe's Melting Brain  via
Good thing Obiden said that and not Biden. You had me scared for a second that the mass genocide by stupidity-in-chief would be repeated another 4 years. Thank god we averted that crisis, right?
They backed Biden because they had no viable path to victory and because after Bernie spent the campaign trashing Democrats and their base, he definitely wasn't getting their support.
Apparently, they're still going with the Biden is a Republican argument.
Ah, yes. The "Joe Biden is a Republican" strawman.
Did his lies kill over 100,000 himself? No? We good then. I'll ride with Biden, Bugs Bunny, or Satan himself over Trump. You read this and shake your head and think "how can someone be so blind to everything? Hate for pure hate isn't a reason to support someone terrible." EXACTLY

Because masks are totall bs! If Biden wins they will be gone 11/4.
The housing issue happened in 1973... BEFORE Biden's crime bill in 1994. Central Park 5 ad was in 1989, when they were already convicted and MOST New Yorkers felt the same...
This is what Biden feels about POC:   In contrast, Trump has passed prison reform that helped POCs, opportunity zones for POCs, funded HBCUs, and blocked illegal immigration to bring unemployment down for POCs.
Biden is unavailable for a Chris Wallace INTERVIEW 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
And this is someone who wants to be president 😳..  basically the vote will be between Biden’s VP and POTUS. My ? Is why isn’t FOX or anyone ASKING this same ? 🙄
Can't believe you have me defending Trump, lol. I agree he should release his returns, and he will - he has to. I think what he is or is not hiding is just speculation, until they're released. The fact that he has not yet done so does not make me want to vote for Biden.
There’s also never been 140,000+ Americans killed by a deadly disease on Joe Biden’s watch. Wonder which thing people care about more
And she's voting for Mr corporate extremist himself..Joe Biden. Put aside her posing and she is nothing more than an orthodox Democrat.
To Joe Biden do you support a strong military ❓do you support BLM ❓Do you support the Boarder Wall ❓yes or no is all we need to know 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Dear won’t concede anything even though I’ve been proven wrong... your side just released a video FEATURING Trump’s America and called it Biden’s. I’d LOVE to hear your justification for that.

The fact that you don't even know this shows how ill-informed you are. Your kind are all alike. You ignore data when it goes against your narrative, take it apart when convenient, then insult or block when you've got nothing. Biden was right: "Truth" over facts.
I hate to burst your bubble, but come November the choice will be between Biden and Trump. 100 days before the election is not the time to pretend otherwise.
I can't in good conscience vote for Biden or Trump.
You are simply wrong. If it comes to pass that Biden wins you will weep for your ignorance.
I wish you would shut the fuck up. Biden was not my choice either but with all the extra mess you keep saying about him people are listening. We must get Trump out of office. Stop bad mouthing Biden you could detour people from voting.
Biden is the puppet of Obama! That is why Obama runs around on sinister errands to help Biden to be the President in case he can control the whole! The real dictatorship is from Obama! Obama brainwashes  us with so called “politically right”!
Why do you want to beat Biden off?!?
Actually Biden is the puppet of Obama. Obama is the one who wants the power of the United States. The only reason they choose Biden is that Biden is obedient! They will not accept anything except Obama gets the real power as a president of the US!
Voting Biden is the most conformist thing one could do. He is a longtime cheerleader of DHS(not to mention the Iraq War and the ‘Patriot Act’). The protestors are seething with anger but fatally confused as they have no politics other than vote blue.
“Teachers will be in charge of education” is their new attack on Biden. You cannot make this up
DHS shocktroops march through the city and the protestors have no politics..they can’t win. Their only message is corporate sponsored racialism and the pathetic mumble vote Biden. DHS was created by the Democrats
Trump has done one thing right... (I know not popular) Cutting off Huawei is a smart move and I hope will be continued by Biden. Huawei is a security risk and heavily subsidized by Chinese government!
Biden sniffs kids.
Same here re: Sanders.  My concern as well. Democrats can be as bad as republicans when they turn their eyes away from wrongdoing in their party. I don't intend to let Biden get away with a damn thing.
Given the tragic state of international affairs this lying tied has put us in, I think it is critical that he select Susan Rice who can immediately hit the ground running...Biden will have his hands so full cleaning up the domestic shit show Donny has left.
#ThrowbackThursday to when #BernieSanders took the polling lead in the democratic race before #JoeBiden wrestled control of the race on super Tuesday. Loks like were headed for a Biden vs Trump showdown after Sanders suspended his campaign yesterday.  #
Let’s fix this problem together. VOTE Joe Biden on November 3rd 2020!
Poor guy blocked me. This is a recurring problem. They say things w/o sourcing (or if sourced it's taken out of context), ignore facts when presented, then if all else fails, they block. "Facts? Pssshhh... Who needs to see facts?" Biden wasn't wrong. They take "truth" over facts.
Can i ask why you vote for biden? Over 40 years in politics, owns half an island in caribbean half a mile away from Epstein Island.  Is that a conspiracy theory as well? On what money was purchased?
Again with the insults. Ok. Are you denying that obamacare was a disaster?  Are you denying 3.7% unemployment rate under trump and more than double under obama? Facts not insults. Don't be a child . Biden son and Ukraine?
Since they are saying this now. Does it mean we get to hear Biden for the next four years explain his loss like Hillary?
You're not a bot, you're just reposting bot posts, got it. Disproved again. You're really not good at this.
... until Biden is elected. 😂
Please refer to 2 previous statements of conjecture. There is NOTHING Biden could do right now to lose. Keep trying to make something stick though. Your frustration is cute.
Great, is Biden Trump? No? We're good. This blind hatred for one side without looking at the common sense/smack you in the face facts....it's frustrating ain't it?
Wait, is Biden Trump? No? Then we're good. You can't possibly post half the legitimate stories of corruption that you have living in your house sir. Again, there's no defending Trump. I won't allow it. The only thing that should be discussed right now is Covid, yet here you are..
- Biden is running to be the puppet for Obama.  Obama just said that he is glad that #BejingBiden is "reconstructing"  their Government.  Their plan is for Obama to rule for 4 hours only to put their next NutJob Demwitt into office.
Biden’s America
Biden wasn’t holding a government position in 2019, Chief
This week’s Rasmussen poll has Trump and Biden even. This is a significant improvement for Trump from last week. Why hasn’t this been widely reported?
You heard Obama himself thank #bejingbiden for ensuring he was going to “Reassemble” the same government they had when Obama was in office.  Proof their planning for Obama’s 3rd term thru Biden.   has different plans for them in 2020. JAIL!!!
Cie just hates Biden and can’t think for himself.
Cie, this is a truly dopey take on your part. Ine if the dumber takes I’ve read in this whole situation. It’s not like Trump paid attention to any of the advice or preparation Obama and Biden left behind for him. What practically do you think Biden could’ve done differently?
As much as I don't want Biden to win, I pray for a honest transparent election.  One of the most dangerous situations we all face is a failed election and transition of power.  Regardless of who wins, if compromised  it will cause bloodshed.  Our foreign enemies know this.

So he did it after the fact. Typical. One thing he has done is shown all the weaknesses in our laws. I really hope when Biden is elected and the Senate is cleansed of the traitors, congress will shore up these holes and codify norms to protect our country
No, it’s “all of these violent crimes you’re seeing under my watch would...continue under a Biden administration?” Do even the most ardent Trump supporters buy that garbage?
By the way, that's who would be calling the shots if Biden wins. It would be Obama's third term.
If these polls are accurate reflection of voter sentiment Ohio has to be at worst even. Iowa lean Biden? ...Indiana? ...Missouri?
Shame on Biden for claiming our president is racist. I should say who I’d devicive now?  Remember if you “don’t vote for Biden you are not black”
Biden makes Gomer Pyle look smart!
What the hell are they talking about. The responsibility of electing a president belongs to the states as defined in the Constitution. The thing that scares me is the period from when  loses and when Biden is sworn in. We have to solve that problem.

Holy shit. If Biden wins Florida, it's pretty much over.
Un the guy Im voting for president (Biden) wants to find community policing as well  Hate how you think all people who support a cause supports everything to that. Don’t conservatives care about STATES rights, now you want FEDERAL troops??????
It’s him being indirect, he knows Trump won’t pívot but it’s also important that young people and minorities show out  It is a dumb way to put it though but he can’t openly support Biden

Just out of curiosity, are you of the opinion that Biden would be able to pass this test?
And where’s #SleepyJoe?   “...Biden’s campaign still has little organizational footprint in Georgia...”  #Sad!Are you saying to vote third party? bc Trump and Biden are both assholes
Pelosi, Schumer and Biden should be ashamed to call themselves Americans!
Understand.  Frankly, I really think most of the white people who aren't liberal but support Biden don't really care who he picks. I could be wrong.
Bottom line is the hydrochlor with Zinc &amp; Z pack probably works - but the $ made for Moderna &amp; the shutdown which helps Hiden Biden = probably a concerted collusion by Dems/Pharma/Media to get Trump &amp; Get $?

Am I the only one to notice Joe 'You Aint Black' Biden boycotted the John Lewis funeral?
Another day &amp; another Congressional hearing in which  made an even bigger fool of himself. Gym wanted to talk about protest crowds but failed to mention political rallies like Tulsa. Given more time he would have covered Page, Strzok &amp; Hunter Biden. Idiot!
A serious question....  Why wasn't Joe 'You Aint Black' Biden at the John Lewis campaign rally?
I know! Who cares Abt tweets when Biden can't even speak coherently! Not to mention he acts very weird w little girls. 🤮
And nobody missed Joe 'You aint black' Biden from his own campaign rally.  How strange...

#blueMAGA Biden supporters are helping trump win more than any other group of people. Trying to bully anyone who criticizes the senile pedophile they worship.
Just when you thought the Biden Campaign could not get any lower, they start to dig.
There are people who have been loyal to Joe Biden for years and they will never get over Kamala Harris accusing him of not wanting her to go to a good school and then starting selling that lame t-shirt. They would accept any VP but not her.
Tearing down people's hope is useless and cruel if you're not going to guide people to a solution. Why destroy what little glimmer of light people have?   Also, Biden is FAR from perfect, but do you genuinely believe he's equivalent to Trump?
And you think Biden is better? 🤣🤣🤣! He's a fumbling, bumbling idiot.
I agree with Ryan. I don’t think Biden is any better than Trump. And a ton of people blame Bernie supporters for trump winning bc we didn’t support Hillary soon enough I guess. Who knows
Uhhhhh,seriously??we all love ND ,but Biden, Pelosi and Schumer are true idiots....JMO

Hey Jerold, you really need to change from Uber to Lyft...Compact car with dents, now driver hits a car,as biden would say,"C,mon Man"
Seems like Biden should announce during Trump's convention speech.
Let’s not avoid real problem. In most states, people realize their vote does not count. What a horrible feeling, and that’s not democracy.  I moved to a swing state so my vote for Biden would count. And yes I’m constantly telling people. The people you mention must be fed up too.
Biden and Sanders jointly recommended a public option to be administered through the ACA marketplace. Of course a competing healthcare plank was voted down. Progressives love losing and being right so much more than winning and enacting meaningful change. It’s incredible.
Take note folks! #Vote #VoteBlue2020 #DumpTrump2020 #TrumpLies #TrumpVirus Joe Biden could still lose this election (opinion) - CNN
Such a winning endorsement of the Democrat nominee for President in 2020: like eating a bowl of s***!
somehow sober biden sounds exactly like i do after three four lokos
People are becoming even dumber.  These same Republican Socialists. Are lying, and blaming Biden and Democrats for dividing the people and holding the country hostage for their legacy agenda of racism and economic plundering. Jail is to good for them.
Owell🤷🏻‍♀️ trump supporters say it’s a vote for Biden if you vote gold or not at all, so it depends on your perspective. That line really doesn’t phase us anymore.
This is why Republicans win. They stay united with matching talking points. It’s not just her. Many “progressives” don’t want to appear like they are selling out to establishment. And that includes Bernie’s tepid endorsement. He’s campaigning for Tlaib and Omar harder than Biden.
This is further proof how the Nadler, that marvelous hunk of man meat, needs a channel to reality. Once he does this, he should share it with Joe Biden and the rest of the Democrat "leadership".
Swing Voters in Michigan Say They Will Vote For Trump, Call Biden a "Puppet" Who's "Not Mentally Capable of Being President" (VIDEO)  via
I have always wondered how do you go from calling Joe Biden a racist who didn't want you to go to school and then start selling tshirts off of it to being his Vice President. It was a low blow and I can see why some haven't gotten over it.
What’s Interesting to Me About the Biden VP Pick Speculation
And don’t for a second try to fool me that Bernie is 100% behind Biden. He barely tweets support for him much less campaign for him. I get Biden donation requests from virtually every Dem candidate but Bernie, who only emails to find Omar and Tlaib campaigns.
I moved to Georgia so my vote would count, unlike in NY. I am donating time and money. I am 100% supporting Biden online instead of this BS many so-called progressives are doing by challenging Biden. As y’all threaten to stay home or vote 3rd party, he’s forced to go more right.
Same Clowns Who Were Wrong in 2016 Predict Biden, Democrat Sweep
AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
can't help but wonder how many people that didn't vote for Hillary will vote for Biden?
If there are to be POTUS debates, Biden should open with the following question----When you go to the polls this November, ask yourself the following question.  Are you better off than you were four years ago?
So tell us what has the done for the black community besides keeping them in poverty with welfare, section 8 rat &amp; rodent, mold, termite infested dumps, abortion clinics in their neighborhoods, several failed education programs. Obama/Biden had 8 yrs with little to no improvement

Look at comments, and it’s full of people refusing to vote for Biden. Bernie said throughout campaign he would 100% get behind nominee. Barely 10% support and his top surrogates are sabotaging Biden. So no, I don’t want to hear advice from a 2016 Jill Stein voter named Brie.
Biden is winning
You really think Biden is the one that’s going on to release those kids?
...well, they’re called neocons. They’re still around.  ...and they’re voting Biden.
and his team are cowards. They are relying on low-information voters who won’t notice he hasn’t taken questions.   Chris Wallace: Trump Took Questions. Biden’s Team Says He’s ‘Not Available’
I wonder if he will invite Joe &amp; Jill to the White House like Obama did? Do you think any of Biden’s cabinet will want to meet with the incompetent people running the gov’t now?
I was telling my husband this the other day. I’ve seen Bernie stickers and trump flags.. nothing at all for Biden. I’m in the south, but there was still a fair amount of Hillary signs &amp; stickers last election. It’s odd
Moron thats a's risky as watching TV during a storm - how about Hiden' Biden when is he going to take questions that aren't designed for Tee Ball?
Biden will go out for ice cream.
Soon to be Pres. Biden will not abuse the power of the pardon, like you. You pardon to cover your crimes. I’d love to see an independent physician actually give you a test for mental health. You would fail.
Need to put sniper teams of the roof of Federal Buildings and take out these thugs.  One or two should put a stop to it if the Biden Campaign controlled media reports it.
He prolly watches breitbart and infowars looking for Biden stuff haha #TalkingPoints
This opinion is spot on.  Where is the objective media?  The American people should know what happened under the Obama/Biden administration.  This is the corruption that is going on in DC.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
This is why the Mafia will be your 'go to' source of protection when President Biden defunds the police.    Mafia or BLM/KKK  choose wisely my friend.
You aren't supposed to make more money by not working than you would by working.  At least until Biden is elected and 'Universal Basic Income' and 'Medicare for all' replace the free enterprise system we now enjoy.
Hey Democrats: Don't let Biden do this...
100 days to go. We must WORK for this. Trump must be defeated.  Proud to support Joe Biden. Follow him here if you don't already. Ask others too as well. With media not giving him equal coverage, let's get some noise going on here for Joe.
'Feel Good' story of the day.  Wait till Joe Biden is President.  This will all be over in a very short time.  It's not for nothing that guns and ammo are flying off the shelves.
I don't know, I think it's a great tune-up for when Joe Biden is president and the country is ruled by the BLM/KKK.  'There will not be one stone left atop another.'
Fredo killed tens of thousands of 90 year old who would have died within six months anyway.  We all know the flu is a hoax designed to elect Alzheimer's Joe Biden President.  Clear enough for you?

Lol says the one who first responded negatively to someone telling the truth about Biden.. sounds like you care a lot to me, but it’s whatever😎
You don't get more DemocRATs crybaby liberal than Arlington VA.  If the neofascist BLM/KKK are attaching those snowflakes we are on the road to the French Revolution's 'kill the rich' with Biden.  Buy guns NOW!  When they tell you who they are, believe them.
Joe Biden, as a political answer to Donald Trump is realism, but it also does not get us to the new level we need to find.
Biden has been a proponent of 15 bucks an hour.... That's honestly alot to ask for from a centrist.
Biden/Harris ticket!!!💛💛💛💛
Joe Biden gaffs are old news. I mean, you gaff all the time, but when you gaff sometimes people die. Like downplaying the virus
Take him out, and replace him with what? A Democratic nut job? Biden won't be any better, and could be arguably worse considering his base is currently destroying cities across the nation. There is no good political solution, because the problem is the collective "WE THE PEOPLE".
Of course they do. And they would have rang true for the Obama administration, as well as ringing true for any potential Biden administration. Carlin was, reasonably so, against the whole mess we have made of our political system.
Actually Biden said he would reallocate funds.... which is the same as defunding. If you have $100 and i reallocate part for someone else you don't actually have $100. I defunded your amount to someone else
Not sure Muslims want Biden. Islamic terrorist yes.
No, this is Donald Trump’s NY if you are going to be logical and compare presidents to presidents.   If you want change VOTE BIDEN!
Why niggas keep saying don’t vote for Kanye but then get dead silent when you bring up Biden?
What unmitigated nonsense. Because people came from an area of Africa and reproduced with women from another section of Africa it's slavery's fault.  When did we stop teaching logic and critical thinking in our colleges?  Biden hasn't made it free yet.
If Biden get's elected by the end of his first term we will be a colony of China.  The only way we will ever be free after that is from the barrel of a gun, just like 1776.
DemocRATs have this election locked up, no reason to kill yourself going out to vote.  Biden can campaign from his basement, no reason to go the Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin it's over.  Just follow Hillary's playbook, works every time.
I have have Joe Biden jokes but....what was I gonna say again?
Well said, and truth.....Welcome to the "Land of Biden"
If you’re gonna hold trump accountable, give Biden the same treatment. This blind obedience people have toward him is fucking weird and why he’s losing votes.
I’ve asked but she hasn’t answered ...is she running for something?? Maybe this is how the Trump era ends...he quits rather than getting beaten by Biden and Haley signs unto the ticket with Pence??
Hillary and Biden is for big pharmaceuticals
No that was Biden Hillary and Obama who paid China scientist to come here for research and then sent them back with knowledge of how to rip us off selling medications back to us 7x more then it cost
Then why didn't Biden do anything about it after 50 years in office
Biden had 50 years to do it? I guess only Trump can get it done in 3.5 😛

Donald if u don't stop speaking or acting like a fool they won't even put u in history books. Although no one reads them nor do we believe u r not a racist. The world knows Obama was for Biden,I hate they believe voting for him &amp; if he wins, its like getting Obama again. Sorry4U
If so, Nikki Haley will be added to the ticket in an attempt to balance Biden’s running mate.
Better yet why hasn't Biden done anything after 50 years. If you use your wonderful brain and Google that you will find out there's more then you realize with what trump has done.
When Biden wins, every single big government, alt right or paleocon will immediately revert back to the Obama-era small gov libertarian-conservative mindset
If Biden wins The United States becomes a colony of China, and the only way we will ever become free again would be from the barrel of a gun.
Not when Biden was caught interfering in foreign elections in Ukraine.
Biden interfered with foreign elections. Imagine what he's doing now
Trump already gave tax credits for daycare cost for parents who work. He's late. Also Biden interfered with foreign elections which is treason.
Can you imagine Hiden' Biden catching or throwing a ball?
This was part of his promises. Trump hasn't even had 4 years. And like he said Biden had 40 years and didn't do a thing. Why not?

Digital Talkback: Readers' insights on Trump-Biden and the economy
Honest question. Biden openly supports Planned Parenthood and would ensure that millions of babies will be slaughtered in the womb through judicial appointments. Trump is at least trying to appoint judges that recognize the  inherent right of the unborn to life. How to reconcile?
Not sure why this is exhausting, but ok. Plenty of folks are getting complacent. People are partying on the beach during a pandemic instead of mobilizing. I see lots of Democrat leaders not throwing their full weight behind Biden.   And really...no one is complacent..."NO ONE"?!?
Defunding and reallocation means the same thing
If you think I'm wrong, prove it. Trump's old interviews have him saying the exact same thing as his campaign promises. He never changes like Biden does. In just 3 weeks Biden went from not defunding police to defunding police and then back to not defunding.
China and Russia are not our allies. They have screwed us for decades and Biden, Hillary and Obama let them
Biden has been charged in Ukraine for treason and just found out he knew about Hillary paying Russia for fake dossier that costed taxpayers $40M and 3 years of fake investigations
You forgot it was Hillary that worked with Russia and paid for the fake dossier that costed taxpayers $40M and 3 year investigation. And Biden knew according to new declassified documents yesterday
Biden flip flops so much it's hard to keep up. One thing about Trump his goals have never changed. You want proof, go watch old interviews with them both. Only Trump has stayed solid over the decades and has signed more bills into law that helps us more
Sorry you can't handle facts along with the fact that Biden has been charged in Ukraine for crimes of treason
Ukraine is charging Biden with crimes along with his son for quid pro quo. That's the overseas relations you want. Don't forget Biden sent our jobs to China as well. We can't afford more of that
The Biden Campaign controlled press will be pulling out all the stops till November.
Oh Donny. You are losing to Biden in Florida by 13 points. Losing.
What a loser,  You can’t even garner a lead over Biden in a Fox News poll.
what happens if Pfizer presents a Vaccine in October?  Should Biden be preparing the public to credit science rather than Trump if that happens? I feel like if people hear about it from Biden over and over, Trump will get less credit for "warp speed"
You expect this chaos to end if Joe Biden is elected? If police in major metropolitan communities are defunded? If borders are abolished and any/all foreigners are allowed to walk in at will? What happened to common sense?
Total CYA move. Biden gets elected to get the swamp back in order.  Indictments will determine if our American experiment is a sham. 😞
It’s just so weird. Bernie said he would rally around nominee NK matter what. And yet everyone that is closest to him is still speaking out against Biden or issuing ultimata. Weird, right? It’s like he keeps his word technically but not in reality. Weird.
Same. The only people causing Biden to lose votes are his own supporters &amp; their cultish behavior with anyone who disagrees with them. They’re worse than trump supporters
I just don’t share your priorities. I also recognize policy is set in the house and senate. Biden will sign whatever they put in front of him, so as long as we elect progressive legislators, we’re good. As long as we get Trump out, which Jorgensen can’t do.
If Biden endorses ceviche the half a million of Peruvians in the U.S will go out and campaign.
If the Red Sox are putting up partisan political banners, then why not post "Biden for President"???
May I remind the GOP and Donald Trump, America’s children are a diverse group representing every ethnic group on the planet. Your polices of hate, division, racism, pro wealth and anti-poor hurt them. However, Joe Biden will fix that, VOTE Blue.
I've done an informal bit of research... just browsin' down thread comments. Vile, hostile attacks upon people who are upset about lockdowns/masking- ALL OF THEM had terrorist hashtags in their profiles and/or had Bernie/Biden tags. ALL, no exceptions. Could try wider sampling...

if biden gets elected this will be a 4 th world country!! is that too much for you to understand!!!
If I’m being completely honest, Biden could choose a potato for VP and it wouldn’t make a difference to me.
Definitely not the first, kno the history BidenBiden is nothing but a puppet. He’s completely demented and will not be running the show.
If Obama was the President for the pandemic, ten times of the people will die! Check how Biden and the newspapers say about the travel ban! Use your brain! Bro!
The GoP is very much pro birth, not pro life. Or they wouldn't work so hard against taking care of the children around them who are suffering. No candidate is perfect. But I will be voting for Biden. Trump HAS to go.
Interesting. I have no idea who she is, but apparently  is very well respected in Congress   - whoever you choose, please make sure your VP pick will help and not hurt the ticket (as we have seen other campaigns do)

That won’t be possible until 2024 and Biden won’t remember who he is by then. Can only remember now on occasion!
Until Biden is removed, you’re going to continue to forget.
Obama and Biden left Trump a Pandemic Response Plan, a Pandemic Response Office, and 44 infectious disease experts in China which he ignored the plan and got rid of the office and disease experts
In the Trump era, it’s quaintly funny that Biden was previously able to take the “gaffe master” title when political competition was far less   Biden finally found a proper use of his “gaffes” now that “says what he means” is important to the electorate

Why bizarrely? They(with Sanders) have convinced a generation of young people that the most revolutionary thing you could do is vote Biden. They, like BLM, are useful tools of the Dem party.
I think Hannity is being a bit unfair tonight. He posed the question “What has Biden done in 48 years?” I say c’mon Sean, it’s ONLY 48 years, give the guy a chance!
Ummmmm....became cognitively impaired??!!! Biden’s wife is a doctor. She parades him around by his arm. Hello!!! The guy is a puppet and Mrs joe Biden should be ashamed. Maybe we will be voting for her to get to the white house. TRUMP 2020!!!!!!!!!!!
Neal- like many of my friends, I’m feeling pretty nervous about this one. We all need to put our heads together and figure out what we do next if Biden wins. I wish there was a way to get at our 401k and IRA money without feeding the potential next administrations. Leave USA???
Is it me? Or was it obvious to everyone, Biden pre arranged which reporters he would call on, what  the questions were going to be,  and was able to answer with notes. At his presser yesterday.
I'll feel safe if Biden has a national lead in votes of 4%+. Nervous between 3-4%. Anything within 3% and I think we see a 2016 repeat
Also. Not sure why people are getting mad at Biden for condemning people who take advantage of protests to riot and break shit.
Unsurprisingly, people on the left are freaking out because Biden isn't pro-anarchist (despite condemning the DHS for the unlawful assault on peaceful protesters)...
Milf Coded Joe Biden
Hold up, wasn't Biden up by 5 gazillion points yesterday? 🤔
Apparently, she has Biden's ear on matters of the economy. I hope she gets her old job back if she wants it. I know we need to keep the Senate so whatever they think is best is fine by me. There's just no way to satisfy everyone. Some will remain unhappy no matter what's decided.
Yeah they were.   I dont hate EW. I voted 4 her n the general as did a lot of women I know that live n ATL &amp; we're not all white either.   But now that Biden is our candidate,  it would unconscionable 2 not have a WoC on the ticket.
No, I'm Biden. Period.
A is unlikely with Biden keeping a low profile.
Things can change if: A. Biden MAJORLY screws up.  B. Trump regains trust on handling the pandemic.
Barr is playing the long game &amp; working for the #KochNetwork. He's only protecting trump bc they want 4 more yrs to finish stacking the court with young right wing justices.   Omg, how much more do you need to get excited about voting for Biden? He's pro democracy. Repubs arent!
Biden: I will be more pro-war than Trump! The state of modern liberalism.

Sounds exactly like what the Left will do if they Trojan-horse Biden into the White House...
Both political parties are stupid and bad as they both weaponize human rights and other important topics to bring the other down. Next time someone says only Republicans are bad, just make sure they know Biden said “if you don’t vote for me you aren’t black.”
I would bukkake Joe Biden’s hair plugs
please talk to your followers. I follow many of the more prominent ones here in Twitter. They are unhappy they didnt get more of what they want in the democratic platform. They are now saying they won't vote for Biden. Please talk to them. That helps trump.
Voting for Biden so... yeah. In case I forgot to say it today: Resign. You’re an embarrassment.
To not take a position on Trump’s re-election is to take a position. You don’t need to be a Biden surrogate, but to say Trump’s re-election isn’t a big deal is just silly
See what happens to health care if trump wins rellection. You are such a hypocrite, by bashing biden you help trump who is trying to take health care away from 20 million people.
I'm confused. Are you saying that Trump staged this to show us what will happen if Biden gets elected? So none of this is actually real?
Sure I want Biden to pick  for #VP. If he doesn’t, does it change my mind? No.  could select Hank Hill for Veep; and I’m still voting for him.
They backed Biden because they had no viable path to victory and because after Bernie spent the campaign trashing Democrats and their base, he definitely wasn't getting their support.
Apparently, they're still going with the Biden is a Republican argument.
Ah, yes. The "Joe Biden is a Republican" strawman.

Actually Biden is the puppet of Obama. Obama is the one who wants the power of the United States. The only reason they choose Biden is that Biden is obedient! They will not accept anything except Obama gets the real power as a president of the US!
Voting Biden is the most conformist thing one could do. He is a longtime cheerleader of DHS(not to mention the Iraq War and the ‘Patriot Act’). The protestors are seething with anger but fatally confused as they have no politics other than vote blue.
“Teachers will be in charge of education” is their new attack on Biden. You cannot make this up
DHS shocktroops march through the city and the protestors have no politics..they can’t win. Their only message is corporate sponsored racialism and the pathetic mumble vote Biden. DHS was created by the Democrats

Biden isn’t on offense or defense. He’s not even playing
He is. He’ll be crying when Biden wins Arkansas

I feel like republicans are siding w Democrats and handing the election to the Dems Biden or whoever they throw in  race.... no one is sticking up for Americans  is on his own. Where are the republicans. Durham is not releasing anything too many dirty politicians
Have you ever seen anything like this for Biden? Me neither...Thank you Nick, we got 'em beat!!!  🇺🇸🇬🇧💪🥸👌🇬🇧🇺🇸 HCQ IS THE ANSWER        #TRUMP2020        17 SENT ME              IFBP
And we're supposed to believe that a majority of Americans want to vote for Biden and Dems in November? I ain't buying... sell crazy someplace else!
PolitiFact - The long history of racism in the US presidency
Probably. If Trumps leading expect to randomly find 200K Biden ballots in a trunk of a car
Tell him Joe Biden will win the election.  If that doesn't scare the shit out of him, nothing will.
Nah, Biden up 25 according to Quinnipiac
And even if he did do something to her one complaint against Biden compared to trumps gigantic list going all the way back to the 80s doesn’t compare
I’m definitely voting Biden, now bc Lindsey Graham and Biden are buddies.
Yes. 500 EVs for Biden bc Orange Man Bad!
Nah. Sarah says it’s over. Biden will get 500 EVs guaranteed
But Quinnipiac has Biden up 15! Your poll is wrong
But Biden has it locked. Don’t even vote. 450+ EVs. Ask Sarah.

Trump has a long list of rape and sexual assult accusations all the way Back to the 80’s. But people call Biden a perv🙄
Biden Makes False Statement About U.S. Economic Contraction
Maybe you should apologize for your comments about Biden on April 24.
Joe Biden hates Blacks, doesn't want them to reach the highest places in society, he is the very definition of hypocrite and racist.
100% I stopped defending what he says &amp; tweets long ago. I will let Rush make money doing that.  Trump has done a lot right, I give him credit. Democrats as a group are less deserving. Biden is a dementia patient.  If I had a better option I would kick Trump/GOP to the curb.
We won’t have to worry about Biden if he is elected but will worry about the people who are actually in charge!

Amazing! BIDEN 2020
So...you gonna retract your condemnation of Joe Biden’s prediction that the orange menace would try to move the election back? 😂
500 EVs for Biden. He gets Manitoba too.
That’s bc Biden is up 16!
Biden still gets 440. Utah is a lock for my man. Will be over by 8PM EST.
Biden’s hiding. Dude didn’t even know where he was yest. It’s really unreal you think he’s even alive.
Why can't we have a BIDEN OBAMA ticket in 2020!!!!
This will be undone by President Biden.
Says an American who don't know what he saying like the heck its vote for Biden vote for someone who don't even know what he saying if you've seen his rallys
What truth does Biden have he doesn't even know what he's saying yell Americans don't think yall just say biden is better when the guy is just plain dumb
Yo alr if Biden wins no more police and borders open so you will let in cartels and raise crime alot also im Mexican and ik what Mexico is so what yell will be letting in is not great at all
Thank you Mr. Pereira! Welcome to the Biden team and restoring our country.

She must have gotten a raise in her corruption payments.  I'm betting Biden got the same raise, although he probably has NO IDEA! 😂🤣😎
I have seen the polls Joe Biden, on the National average you are leading by 9, and either tied or leading in most of the 50 states! Our next PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS JOE BIDEN! WE ARE WITH YOU! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
You must go into the metro areas to see BIDEN signs. They are there.  Or those signs that say 2020 Any Functional Adult
That won’t be possible until 2024 and Biden won’t remember who he is by then. Can only remember now on occasion!
Where does Joe Biden go for apologies from Ari Fleischer and Jonathan Turley? Both publicly sneered whe Joe predicted that trump would try to delay the election.
"Biden’s support is largely driven by an anti-Trump sentiment, with 55 percent of Biden’s supporters in Pennsylvania saying they are voting against Trump, not for the former vice president."
Y’all didn’t say this about Biden, and here he is running for President. We have sexism and racism all wrapped up in one. A damn twofer.
We have past presidents who were major fuck ups, bush and Clinton, speak about an amazing human, John Lewis, and the fucking president can’t even show up? He’s a fucking joke. I can’t wait to vote in November FOR JOE MOTHERFUCKING BIDEN.
Nah, wait until your dad's last debate with Biden. This will be the blow to Biden's chance.  Just like the Hillary email scandal!
There is ANOTHER Obama-Biden scandal that may be under investigation.  The Obama years WILL go down in history as the most corrupt in American history!! #OBAMAGATE
Absolutely not!!!! To be fair I won’t vote for Biden either. I’ll only vote for my locally elected officials and leave the presidency space open
Obama and Biden left Trump a Pandemic Response Plan, a Pandemic Response Office, and 44 infectious disease experts in China which he ignored the plan and got rid of the office and disease experts
I think Joe Biden is doing a huge disservice to his voters by not already coming out with his VP pick. We as a country need to have stability and we can’t get that until he chooses his running mate. It would put a lot of Biden voters at ease (🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️) if he would be upfront.
Only if Biden wins.  If Trump wins, it will last until January of 2025. Unless we take back the House and hold the Senate. It's up to you, people? Do yo like your masks and eye shields?
Here’s a question, Trump maybe signing off to reduce our military in Germany, but such a withdrawal doesn’t happen immediately, it takes years... couldn’t a President Biden undo and reverse a morons capitulation to Putin?
Who is pushing Biden and why?  The danger here is palpable, as are the lies of who is behind the Biden campaign.  Know this: Every media outlet, politician, or citizen who supports Biden, supports the overthrow of America!!  Get this word out!!  BLM=Islam=Democrats=Biden!
When WAS the last time Trump lied? Be specific.  Maybe we can get in a pissing contest over who lied the most. Trump, Obama, or Biden
Isn’t this what the Biden people want? Rich and poor mixed. You got it
It’s elder abuse what they’re doing to Biden 😞
Mars- looks like disclosure may be soon so we need to choose. We have not mastered your human language well enough to understand Biden..
Wow. This is getting real. A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty - The Boston Globe
VP Biden said nothing about cutting funding he said redirect.
Kids in cages has me intent on voting Biden but what we need are socialists running as Republicans. They clearly have no safeguards to keep a group from seizing control.
I will support Biden no matter who he chooses as VP. But, it strikes me as odd that critics of Senator Harris point to her hit on Biden on busing in the debate. Politics is a contact sport and shots like that are taken all the time.
Polls showing that Biden and Trump are tied in the Georgia polls at 47%. This is a state that has been Republican for the last 8 years. Americans are showing they are NOT satisfied with the way Trump has handled the Coronavirus, race relations, the economy and his poor leadership
Polls showing that Biden and Trump are tied with 47% in Georgia. This state has been Republican for the last 8 years. Other states are showing that people are tired of the Trump rants and foolishness over the Coronavirus, race relations, the economy and inept leadership!
It's not that they are overwhelmed. They are under a stand down order by the politicians. Until that gets lifted, the city doesn't stand a chance. Politicians are hoping Trump gets defeated, because they have to know he isn't going to send them any money. Biden will.
Maybe we can turn Georgia blue!! We’re working on it!
Looks like it's a legit if hamhanded attempt to persuade bitter Bernie fans to do the right thing, knowing there's no way to sell them on Biden as a candidate they'll like. Grownup lefties who get the concept of half a loaf being better than none. No sense it comes from Biden.
Listen to Biden, He Knows What’s Best.
Their network pays them to support Biden too.
Ummmmm....became cognitively impaired??!!! Biden’s wife is a doctor. She parades him around by his arm. Hello!!! The guy is a puppet and Mrs joe Biden should be ashamed. Maybe we will be voting for her to get to the white house. TRUMP 2020!!!!!!!!!!!
Damn. Y’all better vote Biden.
I have sad his ability to win is about his VP (soon to be President if Biden wins).  I presume your decision is whether to vote Biden or not at all.
Who else makes fun of Biden from that angle?
Yeah it does, tRump has called BLM terrorist organization, he just waiting for RBG to die and you wanna say Biden/Harris is equal to tRump. GtFOH.
It's not from the Biden campaign. It's from a bunch of lefty smartasses.
Don’t be discouraged. Register to vote if you haven’t, if you can vote by mail. Volunteer to make phonecalls for Joe Biden. It’s really easy, go to his website and click on action center and then make calls for Joe. They are easy calls to supporters. Do it! You will feel better!
“Too ambitious”? WTF?? Was this said about Biden when he was chosen to be VP? He had already run TWICE when we was selected.
Biden allies wage shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
Calling it now: If Biden wins Trump is gonna tweet that clip from Wolf of Wall Street of Leo going “I’m not leaving”
I don't think there will be a debate. VP's yes, Trump/Biden no.  Trump is that polarizing, that crass, that much of a jerk that he may lose to a dementia patient.  If he would just act like he does without Twitter, when the journalist aren't there he would do better.
Opinion | Now we know why Trump sought foreign help to beat Biden
It won't be glorious it will be better. Biden is bad for America just not as bad.
if Biden wins, can he declassify and make the Putin- trump calls public?

Given three choices: vote for Biden, vote for Trump or get poked in the eye with a stick; I would have only one reply:”Is the stick pointy?”
We need to get these smear type ads that are full of false information out of our politics. Biden has been on record saying he is against defunding the police and defunding is to reduce the military gear not the whole police department
We could take all their help and then tell them to fuck off, but Biden is going to Biden. He will give Republicans some seats at the table.  That turned out so well for JFK!
As a conservative who will vote for Trump because I am voting against Biden I disagree with your second sentence, your 3rd is only marginally true.  We need need more Eric Ericksons conservatives with a conscience and principles that transcend both culture and cult of personality
The presumed match-up for the Democrats in November is "Plugs (Basement) Biden" and "Stretch Harris".  But don't worry - they have a constituency. 🙄🙄🤪
Yes, but its not going to be with Biden!
Left bitching about this can’t really hurt Biden like they did Bernie tho 🤔
That’s BS. Biden has no cognitive issues &amp; Trump is the same he’s always been - a delusional narcissist (well, that may be an oxymoron).
Calling this Biden's America is some top shelf projection. Trump doesn't want to win an election. He wants to steal one.
If local law enforcement is protecting peaceful protesters, as Biden argues they must, then the cops are not likely to ask said peaceful protesters if they are ideological anarchists. If they did I expect the peacefully protesting ideological anarchists to lie. Get a grip, Chris.
Biden is going to Biden. If only some people had seen this rightward turn going into the general election.
Propaganda is what we just saw and that is our future under Kamala Harris/Joe Biden. Conservatives get as many people as you can to make their voices heard here on Twitter! Do it NOW!
"And Biden, who will turn 78 weeks after the November election, has said it’s critical his running mate is ready to be president from the first day."  The plan is to get him elected and then, *insert cause of death here*  The VEEP will be POTUS, not him.
Weak response Rat... Deep recessions are supposed to be followed by strong recoveries, but, under Obama, the worst recession since the 30’s was followed by the slowest economic recovery in history. The guy is a clown. Biden is his puppet.
What does that have to do with her ability to govern? Why does that matter about her? What about Biden’s lineage?
Biden is a puppet for the Iranian Islamic Regime; those who slice off heads &amp; hands, and throw homosexuals off rooftops and execute teenagers for speaking out.  THEY are who Biden supports - and vice-versa!

The Benghazi attacks will fall flat with voters, but if not, Biden/Rice can just point to the GOP's own house intel report. It disproved all of the Fox News talking points which is why they dropped it on the Friday before Thanksgiving.
The reporting today about Biden, Dodd, and Kamala Harris makes me think that the people around Biden are very unenthusiastic about the idea of a black woman as a VP, and given their willingness to humiliate Abrams, and comments today, it's probably a bad job.
Wow. I’ve noticed the same about some of Trump’s ads about Biden, enlarging his forehead to make him look scarier.
Voters need to know where the money is going, but they probably won’t find out unless Joe Biden wins, and the FEC becomes a functional oversight body again.  Trump Busted For Illegally Laundering $170 Million In Campaign Donations  via

Breaking news...  Joe Biden had soup for lunch and immediately released this statement!! 😂🤣  (Hey! It makes as much sense as anything else from him!)
There will be no debates. Biden won't do any interviews. He'll only campaign from his basement.
Somehow these people keep getting elected. Then they keep voting/legislating against the people. I just banged my head when Biden got the nomination. When will we learn? I was hoping the tide was turning. Not yet.
...Joe Biden is offering his own presidential campaign hats "MASHA" ...Making America a Shit Hole Again...
If you don't believe the Clintons are capable of revenge on this national scale, then you haven't been paying attention.  Ask yourself, if Biden/Hillary wins, what sort of revenge will the Democrats exact on every last one of us?  It would be a HORROR!!  VOTE RED!!
We're seeing revenge/fear.  Hillary lost in 2016 and never got over it.  Biden is a placeholder. Revenge/hate/fear is rampant, trying to force people to abandon Trump and vote Biden. HRC will then step in and take over.  Clinton/Democrat revenge is being foisted on America!
You’re right.. Listen to Biden, he knows what’s best for America. 😂 #Biden2020
How many doctors have seen a legit death caused by Marijuana?  Yet, it remains in the same federal class as heroin.  And Biden calls it a gateway drug that needs more studies. Trump needs to push decriminalization, obviously the FDA cannot be trusted.
BILL LEWIS: By many accounts, Joe Biden is spending a whole bunch of his time lately in conferences with campaign officials and attorneys, vetting possible vice-presidential candidates to run with him on the Democratic presidential ticket.
You do realize that  is a nut case. He is not and never was a Conservative. You may be a conservative but you have no one that you can vote for. Biden is at least a moderate and he is not stupid and self aggrandizing.
By the way. We are on the same side. I will vote for Biden. I was a Conservative for many years. I cannot align myself with the McConnell group that can’t call themselves Republican. I am a law and order person, but under the Constitution with integrity.
All the Karen’s are clearly Biden supporters.
Am I the only one thinking there's no way Joe Biden knows how to retweet?
I'm no biden supporter but this is how u honor and respect a great person trump is NO PRESIDENT!   #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Step 1: Elect Joe Biden getting Trump out of office, while flipping the senate.   Step 2: Quit voting for DLC Establishment Dems and elect actual progressives. Primary everybody!

Why would anyone vote for Biden, let alone ANY of the incompetent VP's he might pick? Seriously. Why?
please talk to your followers. I follow many of the more prominent ones here in Twitter. They are unhappy they didnt get more of what they want in the democratic platform. They are now saying they won't vote for Biden. Please talk to them. That helps trump.
I don't see that calling Biden a Marxists. Being a "tool" doesn't necessarily make you the thing of which you are a tool.  Are Democrats Marxists, no Are Antifa and BLM Marxists political movement groups, yes Are Democrats benefiting and supporting their riots to get elected, yes
good point by  Biden not only won the Michigan primary this year, he won every county, including Tlaib's Wayne County. Tlaib's candidate Bernie Sanders lost by 16 points in the same state where he beat Hillary four years ago.
Tlaib is getting primaried by Detroit City Council president Brenda Jones. It's a tougher race than you'd expect for an incumbent but Tlaib acts like it's in the bag: "I don't have to have a campaign plan for November because I have a safe Democratic seat"
Also said she thought Michiganders would be "inspired" by voting against Trump (rather than for Biden)
‘Squad’ Member Tlaib Won't Endorse Biden  "I don't want to get into a debate with my residents"
No way Biden is up 7% in North Carolina and down in by 1% in Georgia. Only one of these can be right
How about something like tweeting   - “I was wrong about my stance on Trump/Biden. After reflecting I believe the country is headed in a better direction and I fully support our new president.”  Then setting it up as a pinned tweet for like 3 days before saying it was a joke.
See what happens to health care if trump wins rellection. You are such a hypocrite, by bashing biden you help trump who is trying to take health care away from 20 million people.

Curious, do people actually want Biden or do they just want Trump gone?
Jill Biden will obliterate it as the Biden Administration will race to erase Donald from the annals. “Useless people.”
Sure I want Biden to pick  for #VP. If he doesn’t, does it change my mind? No.  could select Hank Hill for Veep; and I’m still voting for him.
Look, im gonna be real, if Biden doesn’t ban the chainsmokers from ever making music again then idk man
Fox's Chris Wallace says Biden campaign turned down interview request: 'We'll keep asking'

Wait, is Joe Biden the first spark of the "absolutist utopian revolution"? I don't think I'm tracking this historical analogy very well.
You think so? Then you don't know.  and a list of other had a lifetime to stop the globalist and save the manufacturing base in this country. CCP is Slave labor Biden was point man on China The division is Nationalist vs Globalist, Wal-Mart Shelves full #WarRoomPandemic

Chris Wallace: Trump Took Questions. Biden’s Team Says He’s ‘Not Available’
Wallace is absolutely Never Trump.  Biden would have been a cake walk and Biden says no?
I’ll be shocked if Biden debates. So a more realistic question: What will the polls do when Biden announces he won’t be debating?
He'll preemptively pardon himself and everyone in his family, but it probably won't hold up in court. He doesn't DO that much; he spends most of the day watching TV and tweeting and occasionally signing some godawful executive order that Biden will reverse by March.
Kamala Harris is too strong for Biden and harsh no one likes her.  The others are all the same and don’t offer any benefit to Biden. It will be a vote for Joe &amp; Val to get the job done campaign. But he has to come full circle on the Defund the police to reform...
Ah ha!  I just knew they would bring this one back.  Are you afraid yet!  Joe Biden will solve the murder hornets problem by bringing us together, because together America can do anything.
#ResistanceTaskForce JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Here is another Joe Biden commercial.
So much for the People’s House. Biden ought to make a commercial telling everyone he will tear this wall down on January 20th at about 12:05 PM.
I swear, instead of distributing yard signs and bumper stickers, Biden should work a deal with coronavirus test manufacturers and distribute covid tests. Trump's head would spin and America would heal.

Joe Biden is not progressive. He is going to Biden. I will vote for him but will keep my expectations very low.
I don't think any of them do. I think they skipped ahead a few months. But good news is that even right wing alcoholics think Biden wins
Purely politically Biden could pick his dead Mom for VP and he would still win.
I’m concerned about the reason why the GOP is not taking action. Do they know that Russia has promised help again? Do they know that Russia is again going to change ballots and keep Trump and the GOP Senate I’m power? Has to be a reason. #DEM #BIDEN

What kind of President stands by why mobs riot, killing people and people’s businesses? Address THOSE issues Mr. Biden.
I’m surprised Biden is even that close!  Just saying!!
The left doesn’t care about either accusations, never mind the racist comments from Biden. The swing voters and voters on the right DO care though, if Biden wants those votes he going to need to do more than say you aren’t black if you don’t vote for me...
What I’m saying is this tweet is wrong. Clinton got a ton more votes than Trump but lost because of where. More numbers will not help Biden. What will help Biden is making the Ukraine issue go away, and fighting the pediphile accusations.
We gonna turn this Motha out! Biden 2020!!!
someone must’ve told Trump to act more like Biden! He can only go so far, because his nasty nature always shines thru. His attempt to open all areas of the country to fossil fuels is as bad as he handledCovid &amp; fed thugs attacking citizens is start of war.
I wish you would shut the fuck up. Biden was not my choice either but with all the extra mess you keep saying about him people are listening. We must get Trump out of office. Stop bad mouthing Biden you could detour people from voting.
Why do you want to beat Biden off?!?
You tryna beat off Biden? Bruh
WE DONT WANT YOU TO BEAT BIDEN YOU MORON. YOU LITERALLY CANT BECOME PRESIDENT EVEN WITH WRITE INS
And if Biden wins, he's just as much and a pedo.  Will u say the same. Doubt it.
I got blocked by a yankee fan last night that was bitching about Mo. Told him Biden is as much a racist as anyone in politics.  Video of him saying he would never allow his grandkids to grow up in a black neighborhood cause its a jungle. But thats not racist I guess.
Agree.. Joe Biden as a placeholder.
Biden sniffs kids.
A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll revealed that just 13% of voters say their vote is up for grabs in the presidential election   via   &gt; ...Exactly as expected.  Can we go ahead and vote and save everyone's time and money?

That’s probably the only way the Biden rallies could show some attendance.
Biden's in the Lead..and you can still make it a LANDSLIDE....Oh...No, Not The presidential Polls at
I’m voting for Trump.  Not ashamed in the least.  If you are proud of who you support then you would say it.  Which means you are voting for Biden and you are a HUGE liberal z
As Eric Erickson has pointed out, politics is downhill from society. We have stage 4 cancer, the election is a bandaid, and people think it matters. Progressive Democrat policies got us here but a Biden meat puppet Presidency won't hurt that much more, and Trump won't fix it.
Since they are saying this now. Does it mean we get to hear Biden for the next four years explain his loss like Hillary?
We don’t want to influence the election interesting. Since Obama and Biden tried to influence the last election with lies. We will lose this country if we don’t fight like they do!
Hayes hates Trump so baldy he’s willing to destroy USA w/Biden + Dems. Legalize illegals, open borders, free health Ins for illegals, destroy Police &amp; history, pay reparations, limit free speech w/hate speech laws, confiscate guns, destroy Christianity &amp; Judaism n favor Islam.
Hope you’re voting for Biden in this election. Not voting is a vote for trump!
I call him an idiot all the time. But when it comes to Covid, he listened to President Fauci and at every turn. Biden, Hillary, Obama would have done basically same thing. That’s just obvious.
It's almost like people forgot  the reason we EVER liked Biden to begin with   was largely because of the Obama/Biden memes...that just all seemed to make that old soggy bread... almost endearing
We as citizens of a free America must make Joe and Jill Biden the next President and First Lady!!
People who worked for YOU are ENFORCING BIDEN AND WORKING TO GET YOU OUT

I can’t wait to see Biden unveil this portrait next year in the WH. This image of President Obama is the epitome of presidential.
If you vote Biden, it’s gonna be 50%. Democrats LIVE to raise taxes...and I’m socially liberal
I'd say most people globally would position it as slightly to the left of Margaret Thatcher and right of center. It's to the right of Joe Biden who is to the right of center globally.
Biden's speech therapy.
Dear Mr. President. Let’s quit slamming Mr. Biden’s mental acuity. I am 73 years old, and guilty of it also. We all may be there someday. You as well. This approach is probably not receptive to your older devotees. Thank you.
Joe Biden please pick your running mate and I will decide if I will vote for you! Something is not right with this guy #JoeBiden
That will look like child's play if Biden and Democrats take control in November
As much as I don't want Biden to win, I pray for a honest transparent election.  One of the most dangerous situations we all face is a failed election and transition of power.  Regardless of who wins, if compromised  it will cause bloodshed.  Our foreign enemies know this.
good to see Trump following Joe Biden’s lead and calling off a big convention in Florida. No one was going anyway, with Trump failing to handle the coronavirus, leaving America gasping for air across the country. How this loser became president is beyond belief!
The point being that Biden is not ALL THERE!
Thomas Sowell: Joe Biden win could signal ‘point of no return for this country’ -  -
I’m voting for Biden so I can sleep at night and not wake up and wonder what fresh new hell awaits us. Peace - that’s why I’m voting for Joe #Biden2020
So who else believes that no matter what happens with the election shit is really going to hit the fan. If Biden wins we're screwed and I'm sure a lot of us will be ready to fight against the communist. If Trump wins they're going to want to fight.
States certify their elections. Electors meet and vote. Results are forwarded to the President of the Senate (NOT McConnell or Pence). The elector ballots are counted and Biden officially becomes President Elect. On 1/20/2021 Trump's term ends he will be removed from WH.
So he did it after the fact. Typical. One thing he has done is shown all the weaknesses in our laws. I really hope when Biden is elected and the Senate is cleansed of the traitors, congress will shore up these holes and codify norms to protect our country
By the way, that's who would be calling the shots if Biden wins. It would be Obama's third term.
Biden always seems to know things months before the Orange Terror.
Trump will win regardless of who Biden picks as his VP:
What the hell are they talking about. The responsibility of electing a president belongs to the states as defined in the Constitution. The thing that scares me is the period from when  loses and when Biden is sworn in. We have to solve that problem.
I often wonder why out of all the people on planet Earth we decided the person to beat Trump was Joe Biden.   out of all the options   out of all the amazing people  Brand recognition has power. It’s why Trump won, and why Biden still exists for some reason

Then let it burn to the ground! Will allow all US Citizens to have visual of what a Biden White House will do to our communities.
Had to turn off  just now on  Seriously, with everything that’s going on, you are really concerned about Biden not meeting more with reporters? As in 2016 I’m also seeing an alarming degree of false equivalency again. Get a grip!
Don’t despair. You’re right there with Biden!
Virus will only expire Nov.4 if Biden wins. If  wins, it will last another...4 years because the media says so
The ATL Mayor (who I like, btw) has no reason to appear on late night comedy TV.  Unless the Democratic Party is testing her likability as Biden's running mate with a key voting demographic.  I'd be fascinated to see who was on the email chain that made this interview happen.
It’s my sincere prayer that On Nov. 4 will be the dawning of a new day and better things for our Country as you are utterly rejected by an enormous amount of people who will vote for Joe Biden
Un the guy Im voting for president (Biden) wants to find community policing as well  Hate how you think all people who support a cause supports everything to that. Don’t conservatives care about STATES rights, now you want FEDERAL troops??????
Biden better not put on a military helmet and climb into a tank!
Let's watch Biden take it. They can even reduce it to 3 words. I'll take bets on the results. Will you?
It’s him being indirect, he knows Trump won’t pívot but it’s also important that young people and minorities show out  It is a dumb way to put it though but he can’t openly support Biden
Something to consider. When joe Biden is NOT the actual nominee, look how fast the new nominees signs and stickers will be put out. They’ve already been printed, sitting in the warehouse. It’s all planned for them. Joe will fail cognitive test, DNC will choose another. That’s how
This.... doesn’t even make sense? How would this be Joe Biden’s America when America is already like this and Trump is the person who did this? So you sound fucking stupid.
Yhat’s GREAT !!! I would add the biggest supporter, the CCP, all their chips are with Biden
Mexico definitely won’t pay for this one. They don’t want him either. Maybe we can scare him away with reminders of all the indictments that will be filed against him, his hideous family and his corrupt businesses, the minute Biden’s in and he’s out. Let him run to Russia.
Trump virtual fundraiser almost doubles haul of Biden, Obama campaign call
If Donald Trump came out and told people to vote for Joe Biden, do you think Democrats would vote for him?
...the Obama's, Clinton's, Biden's, Pelosi's and Schumer's all work for Chy-na...prove me wrong...
In a Democrat city, in a Democrat state. Why haven’t the mayor and governor stepped up to protect people and businesses and take back Portland?? It’s their JOB. Joe Biden doesn’t condemn it. No Democrat has. This would be Joe Biden’s America.
Biden will stick his foot in his mouth repeatedly until Election Day. It’s what he does. He will misspeak as well. It’s what he does. He may not have bankrupted as many businesses or paid off as many porn stars, but he is not a good candidate except by comparison.
So now it’s anything goes and trump has shown Americans that the president can break any rules or laws that he wants to! So now Biden can do anything he wants to when he’s elected president.
And where’s #SleepyJoe?   “...Biden’s campaign still has little organizational footprint in Georgia...”  #Sad!
That's the cover story - it's a Marxist uprising licking it's chops for the Biden/Harris utopia.
The QAnon loonies think there’s a time portal to Biden’s future America in their fridge, where JFK Jr. hides in the meatloaf and Q will reveal himself from the veggie drawer.
...Boris, you do know Biden isn’t President right?! Your buddy Trump is look where we are...including you. #TrashI hope Biden follows that guideline.
You’d think Trump beats Biden on most of these issues.
Yup. Have to agree. It’s going to be a bloodbath of epic proportions that Canada will loan Saskatchewan and Manitoba as blue states. 450 EVs baby!   Love these accurate polls. Why even deep dive when Biden is consistently up 10-15?!?! They can’t all be wrong!!!
If Obama was the President for the pandemic, ten times of the people will die! Check how Biden and the newspapers say about the travel ban! Use your brain! Bro!
Biden isn’t on offense or defense. He’s not even playing
He is. He’ll be crying when Biden wins Arkansas
This ☝🏿but Biden is going to win by 10-15. Utah will be blue
Nah. 440 EVs for Biden bc his enthusiastic, energetic, transformative candidacy will bring out ppl in epic proportion. Utah’s in play too.
Followed and retweeted
Actually, that would be an even better ticket. Biden probably hasn't even thought about that....until now. Trump can only hope not. #MercyRule
Plus, Biden needs youth on the ticket as he will possibly / likely be one term. Another 70+ year old on the ticket would be a mistake
Probably. If Trumps leading expect to randomly find 200K Biden ballots in a trunk of a car
Nah, Biden up 25 according to Quinnipiac
Interesting. I have no idea who she is, but apparently  is very well respected in Congress   - whoever you choose, please make sure your VP pick will help and not hurt the ticket (as we have seen other campaigns do)
Yet you forget that Biden called Trump xenophobic for closing the Chinese border....
I’m definitely voting Biden, now bc Lindsey Graham and Biden are buddies.
And you want Joe “you ain’t black” Biden to win?????
Yes. 500 EVs for Biden bc Orange Man Bad!
Nah. Sarah says it’s over. Biden will get 500 EVs guaranteed
But Quinnipiac has Biden up 15! Your poll is wrong
But Biden has it locked. Don’t even vote. 450+ EVs. Ask Sarah.
Dated October 25th 2019. I may not like Biden. But we can't have another 4 years of Trump.
Maybe you should apologize for your comments about Biden on April 24.

That’s bc Biden is up 16!

Biden still gets 440. Utah is a lock for my man. Will be over by 8PM EST.
This will be undone by President Biden.
Schweet. I look at your individual Congressional results in Florida - there’s just no way Biden is leading there as other polls are suggesting. No way...
There are 96 days until the election. Have you done everything you can to make sure Joe Biden gets elected? #Biden2020
This is literally Joe Biden's own words and tweets, but let's see if Twitter find a magical way to take this down or restrict it...
Until Biden is removed, you’re going to continue to forget.
Yeah. Probably the same. GW Bush has limited speaking ability, yet he always took the right tone when speaking and came off as a good person when he spoke. I’d put Biden on a similar level.
Secret Service can handle it. They'll drag his fat azz out back door as soon as Biden sworn in.  #FascistGOP  #VoteBlue #70DayDeadlyDelay #HandMarkedPaperBallots
For #JohnLewis I will keep moving and keep marching on to the ballot box in November. Nothing will keep me from casting my vote for Biden and every Dem down ticket! Ready for some Good Trouble! 🥰
Nah, wait until your dad's last debate with Biden. This will be the blow to Biden's chance.  Just like the Hillary email scandal!
I can’t promise that my family is voting for Biden? 🙄 I’m pretty sure I can and we are....
In the Trump era, it’s quaintly funny that Biden was previously able to take the “gaffe master” title when political competition was far less   Biden finally found a proper use of his “gaffes” now that “says what he means” is important to the electorate
Mars- looks like disclosure may be soon so we need to choose. We have not mastered your human language well enough to understand Biden..
Remember Biden wanted to take Trump out back and whip his ass...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do you realize idiot American became energy independent during Obama/Biden.   Do I realize Vet choice was signed by Obama.  WHY DO U CONSTANTLY LIE????
I live in a mostly white suburb of Atlanta and I’m a shy Biden voter. It goes both ways.
If Biden wins and the Dems get the Senate, we will become a banana republic.
Biden is even more ahead of where Clinton was at this point. Duh.
Why bizarrely? They(with Sanders) have convinced a generation of young people that the most revolutionary thing you could do is vote Biden. They, like BLM, are useful tools of the Dem party.
Maybe we can turn Georgia blue!! We’re working on it!
Yeah it does, tRump has called BLM terrorist organization, he just waiting for RBG to die and you wanna say Biden/Harris is equal to tRump. GtFOH.
Bernie supporters are worse than Trump supporters with their delusions. My goodness. Biden won because more people, by far, voted for him. Not any DNC conspiracy. Socialism isn’t popular here, maybe try an actual socialist country if that’s what you want .
Is it me? Or was it obvious to everyone, Biden pre arranged which reporters he would call on, what  the questions were going to be,  and was able to answer with notes. At his presser yesterday.
Whoa, here's a level of Kool-Aid drinking I haven't come across in awhile. Lets debate, shall we? You can't use anything by Fox News, OANN, whataboutisms or say the words Democrats, Hilary, Biden or Obama. Now, tell me why the smartest people in the world should not be in charge.
Trump is correct. They are way behind, but, most of Europe is afraid of a large militarized German Army. Maybe Biden can strike a deal where they can put money towards US &amp; Canada budgets that defend Europe? Non compliance leaves them vulnerable to demagogues like Trump.
Also. Not sure why people are getting mad at Biden for condemning people who take advantage of protests to riot and break shit.
Unsurprisingly, people on the left are freaking out because Biden isn't pro-anarchist (despite condemning the DHS for the unlawful assault on peaceful protesters)...
Hold up, wasn't Biden up by 5 gazillion points yesterday? 🤔
I normally agree with my fellow  writer  but this time I must dissent. This election is about one man: Donald J. Trump. Biden may as well be a potted plant.
But Biden and Harris ?
Added to Harris’ Woke Resume and faxed to Joe Biden’s front porch.
Yes, but its not going to be with Biden!
I don’t care who it is and neither should anyone else. Biden is the nominee and all on his list are outstanding. May the best one win and Biden will get my vote no matter who she may be in November! 👊
That’s BS. Biden has no cognitive issues &amp; Trump is the same he’s always been - a delusional narcissist (well, that may be an oxymoron).
Calling this Biden's America is some top shelf projection. Trump doesn't want to win an election. He wants to steal one.
I prefer Val Demings for VP and Kamala for AG...but it doesn't matter. I'd vote for Biden's toenail as long as we get Trump out.
A is unlikely with Biden keeping a low profile.
Things can change if: A. Biden MAJORLY screws up.  B. Trump regains trust on handling the pandemic.
No more rich than you promising to get to the bottom of Hunter Biden and Ukraine and then NOTHING! I am sooooo SICK of politicians!
You lost to Joe Biden?
"And Biden, who will turn 78 weeks after the November election, has said it’s critical his running mate is ready to be president from the first day."  The plan is to get him elected and then, *insert cause of death here*  The VEEP will be POTUS, not him.
On Nov 3rd, we can get rid of Barr, Trump, Geatz, Graham, S.Collins, McConnel, Pence, &amp; put in positions Beto, Buttigeig, Warren, Yang, Harris, plus take the house, senate then put Biden in charge. But we must stay focused, get people registered, pick local races and fight! #vote
Biden: I will be more pro-war than Trump! The state of modern liberalism.
What does that have to do with her ability to govern? Why does that matter about her? What about Biden’s lineage?
No surprise, he is an obnoxious, loud mouth, lying POS.    Falsely Accuses Biden Of Spying On Trump  via
I am so concerned about the extreme divisions that produced this joke of a  hearing. I sincerely hope that Biden is elected and can pull us together
The reporting today about Biden, Dodd, and Kamala Harris makes me think that the people around Biden are very unenthusiastic about the idea of a black woman as a VP, and given their willingness to humiliate Abrams, and comments today, it's probably a bad job.
Obama and Biden did ZERO COVID testing!
stop eating our own-judicial appoints are TOO important!! Pick a side-support Biden OR allow lifelong trump policies. TODAY, there’s no inbetween. Many in FLA &amp; other states will lose their VOTE. #RIPGOP

Bad ass!! Thank you!
There will be no debates. Biden won't do any interviews. He'll only campaign from his basement.
...Joe Biden is offering his own presidential campaign hats "MASHA" ...Making America a Shit Hole Again...
I enjoy your enthusiasm for Biden even if I don't share it. So I will wholeheartedly agree, I am happy with anyone he picks. He had the job, he is qualified to pick the VP, that is that. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
My 21-year-old is voting. He knows it's the only way to get Trump the f**k out of office. He has some friends who are Bernie Bros who don't want to vote for Biden though.
How many doctors have seen a legit death caused by Marijuana?  Yet, it remains in the same federal class as heroin.  And Biden calls it a gateway drug that needs more studies. Trump needs to push decriminalization, obviously the FDA cannot be trusted.
Biden is not the answer though
You do realize that  is a nut case. He is not and never was a Conservative. You may be a conservative but you have no one that you can vote for. Biden is at least a moderate and he is not stupid and self aggrandizing.
By the way. We are on the same side. I will vote for Biden. I was a Conservative for many years. I cannot align myself with the McConnell group that can’t call themselves Republican. I am a law and order person, but under the Constitution with integrity.
You dont have to like em, but the alternative(Joe Biden) is dangerous.
You don’t get to have it both ways moron. It’s either Trump’s America and he’s in charge or he has to STAY OUT OF CITIES for you to put the blame on Democrats that run the cities. You are pointing out Trump’s America and even suggesting it’s Biden’s is beyond stupid.
Am I the only one thinking there's no way Joe Biden knows how to retweet?
Both political parties are stupid and bad as they both weaponize human rights and other important topics to bring the other down. Next time someone says only Republicans are bad, just make sure they know Biden said “if you don’t vote for me you aren’t black.”
I'm no biden supporter but this is how u honor and respect a great person trump is NO PRESIDENT!   #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Voting for Biden so... yeah. In case I forgot to say it today: Resign. You’re an embarrassment.
To not take a position on Trump’s re-election is to take a position. You don’t need to be a Biden surrogate, but to say Trump’s re-election isn’t a big deal is just silly
You don’t get to have it both ways moron. It’s either Trump’s America and he’s in charge or he has to STAY OUT OF CITIES for you to put the blame on Democrats that run the cities. You are pointing out Trump’s America and even suggesting it’s Biden’s is beyond stupid.

Good thing Obiden said that and not Biden. You had me scared for a second that the mass genocide by stupidity-in-chief would be repeated another 4 years. Thank god we averted that crisis, right?
They backed Biden because they had no viable path to victory and because after Bernie spent the campaign trashing Democrats and their base, he definitely wasn't getting their support.
Apparently, they're still going with the Biden is a Republican argument.
Ah, yes. The "Joe Biden is a Republican" strawman.
Interesting comparison of  numbers in 2016 versus  today. Biden's numbers far more stable than candidate Clinton's were in 2016. #polls #Election2020
Did his lies kill over 100,000 himself? No? We good then. I'll ride with Biden, Bugs Bunny, or Satan himself over Trump. You read this and shake your head and think "how can someone be so blind to everything? Hate for pure hate isn't a reason to support someone terrible." EXACTLY

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I hate to burst your bubble, but come November the choice will be between Biden and Trump. 100 days before the election is not the time to pretend otherwise.
I can't in good conscience vote for Biden or Trump.
Ain’t enough white people gonna vote for Biden. Some tht voted for Clinton jumping ship.
You are simply wrong. If it comes to pass that Biden wins you will weep for your ignorance.
We have work to do in Wisconsin, Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona and Florida! Get involved as we need these states to vote Biden in November these are key states! 👊
I wish you would shut the fuck up. Biden was not my choice either but with all the extra mess you keep saying about him people are listening. We must get Trump out of office. Stop bad mouthing Biden you could detour people from voting.
Biden is the puppet of Obama! That is why Obama runs around on sinister errands to help Biden to be the President in case he can control the whole! The real dictatorship is from Obama! Obama brainwashes  us with so called “politically right”!
Why do you want to beat Biden off?!?
Actually Biden is the puppet of Obama. Obama is the one who wants the power of the United States. The only reason they choose Biden is that Biden is obedient! They will not accept anything except Obama gets the real power as a president of the US!
Voting Biden is the most conformist thing one could do. He is a longtime cheerleader of DHS(not to mention the Iraq War and the ‘Patriot Act’). The protestors are seething with anger but fatally confused as they have no politics other than vote blue.
DHS shocktroops march through the city and the protestors have no politics..they can’t win. Their only message is corporate sponsored racialism and the pathetic mumble vote Biden. DHS was created by the Democrats
Trump has done one thing right... (I know not popular) Cutting off Huawei is a smart move and I hope will be continued by Biden. Huawei is a security risk and heavily subsidized by Chinese government!
Biden sniffs kids.
Same here re: Sanders.  My concern as well. Democrats can be as bad as republicans when they turn their eyes away from wrongdoing in their party. I don't intend to let Biden get away with a damn thing.
Given the tragic state of international affairs this lying tied has put us in, I think it is critical that he select Susan Rice who can immediately hit the ground running...Biden will have his hands so full cleaning up the domestic shit show Donny has left.
#ThrowbackThursday to when #BernieSanders took the polling lead in the democratic race before #JoeBiden wrestled control of the race on super Tuesday. Loks like were headed for a Biden vs Trump showdown after Sanders suspended his campaign yesterday.  #

Since they are saying this now. Does it mean we get to hear Biden for the next four years explain his loss like Hillary?
You're not a bot, you're just reposting bot posts, got it. Disproved again. You're really not good at this.
... until Biden is elected. 😂
Please refer to 2 previous statements of conjecture. There is NOTHING Biden could do right now to lose. Keep trying to make something stick though. Your frustration is cute.
Great, is Biden Trump? No? We're good. This blind hatred for one side without looking at the common sense/smack you in the face facts....it's frustrating ain't it?
Wait, is Biden Trump? No? Then we're good. You can't possibly post half the legitimate stories of corruption that you have living in your house sir. Again, there's no defending Trump. I won't allow it. The only thing that should be discussed right now is Covid, yet here you are..

Biden wasn’t holding a government position in 2019, Chief
This week’s Rasmussen poll has Trump and Biden even. This is a significant improvement for Trump from last week. Why hasn’t this been widely reported?
Cie just hates Biden and can’t think for himself.
Cie, this is a truly dopey take on your part. Ine if the dumber takes I’ve read in this whole situation. It’s not like Trump paid attention to any of the advice or preparation Obama and Biden left behind for him. What practically do you think Biden could’ve done differently?
As much as I don't want Biden to win, I pray for a honest transparent election.  One of the most dangerous situations we all face is a failed election and transition of power.  Regardless of who wins, if compromised  it will cause bloodshed.  Our foreign enemies know this.

So he did it after the fact. Typical. One thing he has done is shown all the weaknesses in our laws. I really hope when Biden is elected and the Senate is cleansed of the traitors, congress will shore up these holes and codify norms to protect our country
No, it’s “all of these violent crimes you’re seeing under my watch would...continue under a Biden administration?” Do even the most ardent Trump supporters buy that garbage?
If these polls are accurate reflection of voter sentiment Ohio has to be at worst even. Iowa lean Biden? ...Indiana? ...Missouri?
Shame on Biden for claiming our president is racist. I should say who I’d devicive now?  Remember if you “don’t vote for Biden you are not black”
Suburban housewife here voting for Biden.
What the hell are they talking about. The responsibility of electing a president belongs to the states as defined in the Constitution. The thing that scares me is the period from when  loses and when Biden is sworn in. We have to solve that problem.

Last tweet of the night on this: I cannot imagine better ammunition for the GOP to sweep the conservative Christian vote than this. I hope Biden is calculating the inevitable damage this would cause.
You really should avoid tweeting while smoking crack, Sam. Your fever dreams and hallucinations have no connection to reality. Trump will receive millions more votes than in 2016 and Biden will be lucky to win over 6 states.

And they have a need to be "pacified" by the DNC or else their vote won't be "earned" for Biden.    It's like they all need a Binky so they'll be pacified, but they get so mad when you tell them that.
You're either gonna vote for Biden or help Trump get reelected.  That's 100%  on you.    So why should we waste our time trying to find the correct Binky to pacify you?   Your quest for pacification is what makes you irrelevant.
He took one so Biden would take one, he won’t take it so it adds doubt to voters.
I’m not sure what type of tests my father took , didn’t need to take any to be honest it was obvious. Kinda like Joe Biden, it’s obvious.
Who would win in a fist fight between Trump and Biden? I rest my case....
Sure hope so ! Biden is a 🌶 🥦🥬🌽🥕 vegetable !
Biden can’t even spell ECONOMY...
I dont want either in power but mentally i rather trump than biden because at least we will stay on the streets with him but biden will lock us up with the swiftness...
Wow! Do you really think that Biden or even Obama would have done any better? It seems I'm not the one drinking the Kool aid. Dems have done nothing but destroy and overtax the hell out of people. Look at their cities. Look at Cali! what a shithole that's become.
Biden is a trojan horse. If he' get back in the White House he's going to be opened up and a bunch of little Communists will crawl out
the Dems are pushing for socialism. Apparently you are wanting the delusional Biden to get the presidency.
LOL if you don’t vote for Biden you’re not black, seriously bro
If you don’t vote for Biden you’re not black not my words
Who are you talking about ?? BIDEN. And then he has his son help him steal... and he molest under age girls.  17 years old. Close ties with the K K K  and used the N word all the time... and now has serious mental issues...

That’s fair. The real issue is HIM accepting the results if Biden wins.
We need to vote this man out.  If he don't want to leave, we can drag him out. I don't want to vote for Joe Biden but we don't have a choice.
You don't have to be black only brain dead if you vote Biden for anything. Gaffs aside. He sold out this country committing treason with Obama giving a sworn enemy Iran $150 billion dollars used to kill Americans.

They sure as hell didn't call me Biden all the way
It’s gonna tighten up before Election Day. We need to keep the pressure up and make sure folks show up to vote. Also, I think it’s time Biden got out there more- where he can.
If I have to crawl on my hands and knees to vote for Biden, you need to understand that I will do it. #NobodyLikesTrump #AmericaStrongerWithBiden

I don't recall anyone saying Biden was too ambitious when he was being consider for VP! #KamalaHarris has been my pick from the very beginning!  needs new allies! #KamalaHarrisForVP
Wow, everyday it’s like some new ridiculous shit. I honestly believe if Biden were our President we would be through this pandemic.
They were going to ask Biden to do it but when asked he said "I loved his music with The News".
Well, even if  crustal ball is correct, how does that change the race. More importantly, how will this impact Biden’s governing. Both are corrupted neoliberals in the pockets of their donors. So functionally nothing changes for the people who desperately need it.
Go figure.  I bet no Biden interviews nor the much wanted DEBATES!
New poll has Trump, Biden tied in Georgia
It's our vote  and we can "throw it away" If we want to. I just might vote for Dwayne Johnson. Anybody would be better than Trump or Biden
Seeing how you constantly talk about wanting certain people to die I figure I might add that Biden will most likely stroke out before elections and if he doesn't I hope he loses just as badly as Hillary did
If Biden gets in.. they would do it for another 4 years because he can’t remember if he paid his water bill last month or not.
A friend of mine said: "Biden could boil babies, and eat them on Daytime TV, &amp; he still wouldn't vote for "Agent-Orange!" I was like, Wow! 😵

I am sad for Joe Biden; he can't put 2 and 2 together, doesn't know what day or state he's in. Often quoting incorrect information and the list goes on and on. I blame more the people behind Joe Biden who's pushing him to run for office when it's very obvious he is not capable.
Joe Biden's at the Nursing Home waiting for you. Go get sniffed by creepy.
Well 45 doesn’t draw a salary. And the way Biden had his son making MILLIONS from the Ukraine and China is a way larger conflict of interest and criminal.   Hell Biden bragged on camera about withholding a Billion dollars of aid until they fired the investigator.
This is what I think. They are eating off of this and nothing else. Last Biden and dem Govs change laws.
Who do you mean?  Yo you know me Matt, but it's time for these Portland protests to stop. They've lost the plot man. Not because of Trump and his brown shirts but it's a bad look. Only takes 100k white guys to decide to vote for Trump bcuz Biden supporters chaos. BS but still...
No. I don’t care. Obama chose Biden and that worked out well. I’m concerned that Biden is President. I trust him to make a great decision.
Biden won’t put kids in cages.

Unless, until, and a BIG fucking IF the Democrats and the left finally wake the hell up and figure out the Clinton’s, Obama, Biden, Hoyer, Pelosi, Schumer and their cadre of neoliberal corporatists have sold the barnload of horseshit, NOTHING IS EVER GOING TO CHANGE.
What is Joe Biden's 700 Billion Dollar "Buy America" plan, If they sold it in 1927?
The media is going to make a big deal our of Joe Biden taking questions. It's all just a stage play to try to make him look competent. He has a list of which reporters to call on and they're asking pre-written questions that he's already seen. The answers were scripted for him.
I’m voting for a swift kick in Trump’s ass to boot him out. Not pumped about Biden but a box of rocks would be better than Trump. :)
Planted questions by the press to Joe Biden during his press conference.  Has a list of who to call on.  What a crock of crap!!!
I absolutely hate when people say they are only voting for Biden because he’s not worse than Trump. I honestly don’t think he’s going to as much of an improvement as people are hoping.
Georgia is proving to be a harder win for the GOP than anticipated. Now is the time to focus on bringing new leadership in at every level. Election day is November 3rd. #gasen #gapol #progressiveleadership
Joe Biden has spent his entire career supporting and promoting women’s rights. That's why I joined Women For Biden. Join women from across the country as we continue the fight for women's health care, paychecks, safety, and families.

What was it Bernie’s staffer said about voting for Biden?
We are beyond the point where reasoned debate can make a difference. We need people on the left who will not allow justice movements to be corralled back into business as usual, especially if Biden comes into power. Militant action is now urgently needed.
Says the person that supports Biden and half of his followers are Bernie Sanders supporters.
Wound tight about what the government is knowingly doing? Maybe. Probably means I care and you don’t. But hey vote Biden. I’m sure his fascism and crime bills are a thing of the past
Okay pal. You obviously don’t care if you’re backing Biden. Biden is apart of the issue and is too sick to understand it. The  played politics with bodies. Used people as pawns to push the death count. All to hopefully win in november. Biden don’t care and neither do you
Social media stars a few weeks ago went with the #blackout trend. Now it’s all about #womenempowerment. My guess is either today or tmrw, Biden announces Kamala as his female VP.
Biden's children were privileged white kids...see how well Hunter turned out?  Rode daddy's VP coattails, cheating Govt for years, making millions while high on coke.
Biden all the way ,Georgia
Biden pretty much has to debate Trump, or Trump will say Biden is afraid to debate him. On the other hand, I saw Biden do a shark grim when he said he'd debate Trump. Debating is something you learn in real schools.
All the Black female VP choices for Biden all told us "We Don't Need A Check" just help HBCU's with grant money for reparations....the chess pieces are moving. What will you do as a response if he wins?

Joe Biden is a simp
You all want to talk about history and the south and monuments. Have the conversation about backing a party with a history of enslaving African Americans and Jim Crow Laws. The 1994 Crime Law=Biden. Those things are attached to the Democratic Party but they get a pass?
You talk about the history of confederate flags and things alike but you are affiliated with a party that has a history of enslaving an entire race Who is the father of Jim Crow Laws all the whole backing a candidate that imprisoned African Americans. 1994 crime law=Biden.
Trump has done more in 3 years to help Blacks than Obama and Biden did in eight.  He signed prison reform, he got the Black unemployment rate to the lowest ever, he signed into law the MLK National Park in ATL (wonder why Obama did not do that?) and he gave Black Colleges funds.
What are you talking about? Twitter didn't censor President Joe Biden!
Former Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner compares voting for Biden to eating 'bowl of sh--'  #FoxNews

Seems we still don’t have a clue who’s Biden’s pick . So let’s not get emotional . This could be a bot Game of keep them hyped .
For those of you who think we shouldn’t be saying this bc it’ll hurt him. I say grow the fuck up. People aren’t as stupid as you think they are. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist with a cursory history of Biden’s past to know he’s gonna sell us out to his donors before he wins.
We’re fucked again. I’ll say this again, I’ll vote for Biden bc he’s facing Satans spawn. But you’ll never hear me say a damned thing is gonna change other than the person screwing us over will be nicer about it. Another neoliberal corporatist Dem in the pockets of the donors.

Could you imagine the US if Bernie was our primary with the House and Senate? Biden bout to piss this away.. I feel it 🧐
Yeah, there’ll be “Democrats” there, neoliberal Democrats. Or what I like to call GOPers with a D behind their names. You see what makes a Democrat today hasn’t a damned thing to do with policies. It’s if you buy into the Clinton, Obama, Biden, et al neoliberal world order.

Joe Biden's dementia
I hope like Hell Biden don't listen to that . . Senator Harris is the best choice for VP . . Period
Biden is increasing taxes on everyone.  pay attention and learn what is going on.  It is a bait and switch.  Bait is lower taxes and when elected he will switch by letting the TC&amp;J Act end in 2025.  He will also go for a Carbon tax or a Vat tax to pay for his green program.
If you work and elect Biden your taxes will go up.  When the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act goes away the DemocRATs will have raised taxes.  Get real and wake up!
No Biden is just a Criminal who with his son Huntermade a lot of money off of the American Taxpayer.  BTW Trump is not a traitor.  Might want to look at Hillary for her selling American Uranium to the Russians or Obama with his plane loads of cash to terrorists to kill US Troops.

AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden support, Trump voters fervent
This is an excellent way for Republicans to further ruin the economy ahead of a Biden administration that would then have to spend most of its time righting the ship. Is this telegraphing how they feel the election in November is going to go?
The state should have the right to fine electorals that don’t follow their state votes even if they voted for Trump. Yes I will vote for Trump but if he doesn’t win and Biden wins then see Biden is the winner but to keep it fair for each state this is why we have the system !

Senator Harris is Most Definitely the best choice for VP . .  #BidenHarris2020  Harris seen as Biden VP favorite as clock ticks
Would Biden call Lawrence Jones "articulate and clean"?  Hmmn? No, probably not.
Actually Biden's racial history makes Trump look like Mother Teresa.   Dems always call their opponents racist. In primary elections they accuse each other.  Biden was accused of racism during the Democrat Presidential debates. It's really the only arrow in their quiver.
Also who knew of the Biden corruption before trump made a phone call that got him hoax impeached?
Krystal Ball: Previewing the hellish future of a Biden administration  via
I think those of who believe in a Progressivism &amp; want to see us move in that direction do ourselves no favor by pretending Biden is who he clearly isn’t. That way if/when he wins in November we’re prepared to do to him what we failed to with the last 2 Dem presidents. Fight him.
Which ultimately means for me that Biden is a slow down to the rapid destruction of Trump. It also means the trajectory of the past 40 years won’t change. I’m not going to anoint ideals to Biden in the way progressive ideals that’s just not true just bc he’s facing Trump.
I’m a realist with ideals. I fully understand who Biden is based on his legislative history, and he’s done nothing to disavow any of them harm he’s caused for so many. He openly promises nothing of significant policy changes, which means we return to a pre Trump America.
I said all of this to say this, because Trump is in the WH I’ll vote for Biden. Not because of Harris, but because if nothing else he’ll slow down this runaway train of right wing hegemony. I don’t expect any significant change in our plight though,  because he’s promised none.
Cmon. Please dont be this dense. Btw I thought of a non-offensive word but couldnt think of one for what you are doing. He is showing people defending Shahid. When did he do anything other then report allegations or evidence against Biden?

I can't get any donations but the devil can check out your results.  "Trump vs. Biden: Who’s winning the money race in your ZIP code?"
The bigger issue for me, is the CHARACTER of the individuals involved. Regardless of "policy," I'm MUCH MORE concerned with the overall honesty, integrity, empathy, decency,  heart, soul, &amp; common-sense; which Biden seems to have more of in his "pinky," than #45 will ever have!
And time that's what friend are for give your better half my
In VP search, Biden has a known quantity in Susan Rice
I'm confused as to what you're so "sour" about though Sean. You say Biden's not for universal healthcare, when he's all for expanding the ACA, &amp; he's more open to a universal "type" of healthcare than "#45 " will ever be. &amp; He may not agree w/"Green Deal" but he respects Science.
I believe Trump will win re-election, as you do Mitt.   He will beat the crap out of Joe Biden. Just like he beat Hillary.
I'm with you🙋🙋
How the hell you going to to talking about racist and the color of peoples skin and being judged by that and then say you will vote for Biden if he has a Black Woman VP. That's voting for someone based on the color of their skin. WTF you dumbass.
Never thought much about the CDC folding for Trump . But they’ve failed us . All that are in charge after Biden wins . Need to be fired . Go work for religion .

What good has Biden done for Americans?
Don’t hurt them.....you support Biden. I would pump the breaks on the pedo statement.
You’re obsessed to the point you deny what he’s done. But it’s okay. Vote for Biden. Because he has done so much good in his 40 years in politics.
And Biden can barely remember where he’s at and where his thoughts are. Let’s say Biden was elected, and worst case scenario happened, would you really want him at the helm of the nuke football? Especially with his obvious cognitive decline.
BTW, the really over the top dystopian propaganda videos against Biden that you have running are so bad, they are funny.
Sound like Biden and the DNC's campaign platform.
No, the Great and Powerful Wizard of OzBama is running for his 3rd term. He's having Biden's back hollowed out so he can get his hand in there to make Joe's mouth move as he sits on his master's knee.
Has anyone started Joe Biden in that crowd just curious!
Bill is being paid by the Biden campaign.
Biden also has a compassionate heart.
He's not very popular but we can't let that cause us to relax our efforts. Millions would vote for a turnip, which might be smarter than Biden, to get President Trump out of office. We need to work extra hard for the next 100 days to register Republicans and make sure they vote.

We need Trump! This is not the time to be without leadership! Biden ahis party will wreck havoc on the USA!
Good! Appointing her as his vice-presidential running mate would make a strong nail in the coffin of Biden's presidential bid.
Biden will lose to Trump. He can barely form a coherent sentence. I believe the left knows that he is in the early stages of Dementia but they want him to win so that they can have someone else in the background doing his job.Actually you are right cancel culture does not like Republicans which is actually funny where if you look at history it was the Democrats that have a history of racism. Biden has a history of racism and bigotry yet he suddenly found the light and is supposedly now not a racist.
It was celebrated until Obama decided to politicize his funeral to make a speech for Joe Biden that was not really truthful.Mail in Ballots are often loaded with voter fraud and lost ballots.Trump only asked how were we going to work out the kinks in voting. Use absentee ballotis
I agree with you. The Democrats, BLM, Antifa, Biden, ActBlue, Soros, China, Clinton’s and Obama have a lot in common. Money and the BLM movement. They are paying the Protestors, anarchists and Biden’s campaign The riots were planned but was George Floyd’s death planned as well.

You must go into the metro areas to see BIDEN signs. They are there.  Or those signs that say 2020 Any Functional Adult
That won’t be possible until 2024 and Biden won’t remember who he is by then. Can only remember now on occasion!
of more Fascism. Like I said, pushing the party left will be a gradual process. Having a fucking Fascist as president does nothing but slow that process down. We can bully Biden into conceding on 1 or 2 issues, with Trump we cant do that
Please tell me how we fight neoliberalism by saying he's equal to Trump. You make no sense. Neoliberalism leads to Fascism yes, BUT WE HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED AT FASCISM. Biden being in office at least guarantees us 4 years without fascism. Which is objectively better than 4 years
Obama and Biden left Trump a Pandemic Response Plan, a Pandemic Response Office, and 44 infectious disease experts in China which he ignored the plan and got rid of the office and disease experts
Isn’t this what the Biden people want? Rich and poor mixed. You got it
It’s elder abuse what they’re doing to Biden 😞
For covid, WWYD? Not one person in this country can answer that, not even Dr. Fauci. He’s still all over the place. I guess Biden would have the answers, he doesn’t even know where he is. 🤭
Me, too!     And what a wonderful First Lady we will have in Dr. Biden.
Fumble the COVID response this badly, rollback healthcare protections for the marginalized, etc. Like I said, dont wanna vote for a war criminal then fine I dont blame you. But dont act like he wouldn't be an improvement. Is it a low bar? Yes. But we can actually push Biden left
what makes you think I'm unaware of that? Fuck Obama too. But if I had a choice between that and Fascism give me Obama. I'd rather have a war criminal that doesn't embolden hate crimes than war criminal that doesn't. You're kidding yourself if you think Biden would
Fuck Biden but we should be using the fact that he would be the furthest left president as fuel for shift the Overton window
Name a president further to the left than Biden. Try it. I dare you
Boomer? 100% sure I'm younger than you lol. But if you think Biden is a Fascist, will have open racists in his administration, take away protections for LGBT people in healthcare, deny the existence of climate change, idk what to tell you my guy. Biden can be bullied, Trump cant.
I will support Biden no matter who he chooses as VP. But, it strikes me as odd that critics of Senator Harris point to her hit on Biden on busing in the debate. Politics is a contact sport and shots like that are taken all the time.
Looks like it's a legit if hamhanded attempt to persuade bitter Bernie fans to do the right thing, knowing there's no way to sell them on Biden as a candidate they'll like. Grownup lefties who get the concept of half a loaf being better than none. No sense it comes from Biden.
Hey Donnie, come January 21st, 2021 we will all be so glad when you lose and have to vacate your one house  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  I'm sure the purely racist stench will be greatly cleaned and cleared out of their by President Joe and Dr. Jill Biden.
Ummmmm....became cognitively impaired??!!! Biden’s wife is a doctor. She parades him around by his arm. Hello!!! The guy is a puppet and Mrs joe Biden should be ashamed. Maybe we will be voting for her to get to the white house. TRUMP 2020!!!!!!!!!!!
I have sad his ability to win is about his VP (soon to be President if Biden wins).  I presume your decision is whether to vote Biden or not at all.
Who else makes fun of Biden from that angle?
It's not from the Biden campaign. It's from a bunch of lefty smartasses.
Don’t be discouraged. Register to vote if you haven’t, if you can vote by mail. Volunteer to make phonecalls for Joe Biden. It’s really easy, go to his website and click on action center and then make calls for Joe. They are easy calls to supporters. Do it! You will feel better!
If Biden has any sense, yes. She’s razor sharp.
Calling it now: If Biden wins Trump is gonna tweet that clip from Wolf of Wall Street of Leo going “I’m not leaving”
I don't think there will be a debate. VP's yes, Trump/Biden no.  Trump is that polarizing, that crass, that much of a jerk that he may lose to a dementia patient.  If he would just act like he does without Twitter, when the journalist aren't there he would do better.
Opinion | Now we know why Trump sought foreign help to beat Biden
We need to get these smear type ads that are full of false information out of our politics. Biden has been on record saying he is against defunding the police and defunding is to reduce the military gear not the whole police department
We could take all their help and then tell them to fuck off, but Biden is going to Biden. He will give Republicans some seats at the table.  That turned out so well for JFK!
As a conservative who will vote for Trump because I am voting against Biden I disagree with your second sentence, your 3rd is only marginally true.  We need need more Eric Ericksons conservatives with a conscience and principles that transcend both culture and cult of personality
Biden is going to Biden. If only some people had seen this rightward turn going into the general election.
Weak response Rat... Deep recessions are supposed to be followed by strong recoveries, but, under Obama, the worst recession since the 30’s was followed by the slowest economic recovery in history. The guy is a clown. Biden is his puppet.
November comes down to we get trump and insanity, or the Republican voters figure out that the dems are Republicans and they elect biden
Wow. I’ve noticed the same about some of Trump’s ads about Biden, enlarging his forehead to make him look scarier.
Somehow these people keep getting elected. Then they keep voting/legislating against the people. I just banged my head when Biden got the nomination. When will we learn? I was hoping the tide was turning. Not yet.
Why don't you instead yell at &amp; tell your husband to acknowledge &amp; admit he has much to be blamed for the deaths of 150,000 plus of your fellow citizens of the U. S., otherwise if you don't you don't deserve to be our First Lady anymore, &amp; Dr. Biden can take care of Rose Garden!
Biden loves China, there would be many more dead if senile grandpa was in office.
Step 1: Elect Joe Biden getting Trump out of office, while flipping the senate.   Step 2: Quit voting for DLC Establishment Dems and elect actual progressives. Primary everybody!
The sad part is Biden has a chance only because Trump is a polarizing jerk. Re: John Lewis lying in state at the Capitol.
I would bukkake Joe Biden’s hair plugs
If I were Joe Biden, I wouldn’t show up!
please talk to your followers. I follow many of the more prominent ones here in Twitter. They are unhappy they didnt get more of what they want in the democratic platform. They are now saying they won't vote for Biden. Please talk to them. That helps trump.
I don't see that calling Biden a Marxists. Being a "tool" doesn't necessarily make you the thing of which you are a tool.  Are Democrats Marxists, no Are Antifa and BLM Marxists political movement groups, yes Are Democrats benefiting and supporting their riots to get elected, yes
See what happens to health care if trump wins rellection. You are such a hypocrite, by bashing biden you help trump who is trying to take health care away from 20 million people.
Curious, do people actually want Biden or do they just want Trump gone?
Jill Biden will obliterate it as the Biden Administration will race to erase Donald from the annals. “Useless people.”
Sure I want Biden to pick  for #VP. If he doesn’t, does it change my mind? No.  could select Hank Hill for Veep; and I’m still voting for him.
That’s fine but we have heard  promise for over 1 year to get to bottom of Kavanaugh lies, get to bottom Hunter Biden &amp; Ukraine, get to bottom of FBI CIA lies/entrapment as of today NOTHING, not a DAMN THING BUT IDLE PROMISES. All talk no action. Disgusting!!!!
And an empty chair with "Biden" appears at the end.  Clint Eastwood would be proud.
He'll preemptively pardon himself and everyone in his family, but it probably won't hold up in court. He doesn't DO that much; he spends most of the day watching TV and tweeting and occasionally signing some godawful executive order that Biden will reverse by March.
Ah ha!  I just knew they would bring this one back.  Are you afraid yet!  Joe Biden will solve the murder hornets problem by bringing us together, because together America can do anything.
I swear, instead of distributing yard signs and bumper stickers, Biden should work a deal with coronavirus test manufacturers and distribute covid tests. Trump's head would spin and America would heal.
Biden’s campaign is ‘suppressing the Hispanic vote’ in Florida, an internal letter claims  via
Joe Biden is not progressive. He is going to Biden. I will vote for him but will keep my expectations very low.
Purely politically Biden could pick his dead Mom for VP and he would still win.
I’m concerned about the reason why the GOP is not taking action. Do they know that Russia has promised help again? Do they know that Russia is again going to change ballots and keep Trump and the GOP Senate I’m power? Has to be a reason. #DEM #BIDEN
You tryna beat off Biden? Bruh
A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll revealed that just 13% of voters say their vote is up for grabs in the presidential election   via   &gt; ...Exactly as expected.  Can we go ahead and vote and save everyone's time and money?
You sir are a hero.  We need more people like you. I'm sure in the coming months you will have a prominent role in our country's security once the biden administration is in charge.
Biden's in the Lead..and you can still make it a LANDSLIDE....Oh...No, Not The presidential Polls at
As Eric Erickson has pointed out, politics is downhill from society. We have stage 4 cancer, the election is a bandaid, and people think it matters. Progressive Democrat policies got us here but a Biden meat puppet Presidency won't hurt that much more, and Trump won't fix it.
Hayes hates Trump so baldy he’s willing to destroy USA w/Biden + Dems. Legalize illegals, open borders, free health Ins for illegals, destroy Police &amp; history, pay reparations, limit free speech w/hate speech laws, confiscate guns, destroy Christianity &amp; Judaism n favor Islam.
People who worked for YOU are ENFORCING BIDEN AND WORKING TO GET YOU OUT
If you vote Biden, it’s gonna be 50%. Democrats LIVE to raise taxes...and I’m socially liberal
it's a lie. , it's stupid. How dumb would a burglar have to be to use a crowbar on a windowed  door that doesn't have a deadbolt? And who doesn't a cellphone ? have Trump’s False, Recurring Claim About Biden’s Stance on Police  via

Joe Biden please pick your running mate and I will decide if I will vote for you! Something is not right with this guy #JoeBiden
The same strategy as last time is working. The goal is to make Biden boring or just as bad. So many people say it wont make a difference, and many who never cared for 3rd party want to protest vote
Biden always seems to know things months before the Orange Terror.
Be interested to know how many people have suffered some sort of life altering sickness from this as well, IE "scarred lungs" leading to a lifetime of breathing problems... #Biden
Had to turn off  just now on  Seriously, with everything that’s going on, you are really concerned about Biden not meeting more with reporters? As in 2016 I’m also seeing an alarming degree of false equivalency again. Get a grip!
In a Democrat city, in a Democrat state. Why haven’t the mayor and governor stepped up to protect people and businesses and take back Portland?? It’s their JOB. Joe Biden doesn’t condemn it. No Democrat has. This would be Joe Biden’s America.
So now it’s anything goes and trump has shown Americans that the president can break any rules or laws that he wants to! So now Biden can do anything he wants to when he’s elected president.
That's the cover story - it's a Marxist uprising licking it's chops for the Biden/Harris utopia.
...Boris, you do know Biden isn’t President right?! Your buddy Trump is look where we are...including you. #TrashI hope Biden follows that guideline.
You’d think Trump beats Biden on most of these issues.
Yup. Have to agree. It’s going to be a bloodbath of epic proportions that Canada will loan Saskatchewan and Manitoba as blue states. 450 EVs baby!   Love these accurate polls. Why even deep dive when Biden is consistently up 10-15?!?! They can’t all be wrong!!!
If Obama was the President for the pandemic, ten times of the people will die! Check how Biden and the newspapers say about the travel ban! Use your brain! Bro!
Biden isn’t on offense or defense. He’s not even playing
He is. He’ll be crying when Biden wins Arkansas
This ☝🏿but Biden is going to win by 10-15. Utah will be blue
Nah. 440 EVs for Biden bc his enthusiastic, energetic, transformative candidacy will bring out ppl in epic proportion. Utah’s in play too.
Followed and retweeted
Actually, that would be an even better ticket. Biden probably hasn't even thought about that....until now. Trump can only hope not. #MercyRule
Plus, Biden needs youth on the ticket as he will possibly / likely be one term. Another 70+ year old on the ticket would be a mistake
Probably. If Trumps leading expect to randomly find 200K Biden ballots in a trunk of a car
Nah, Biden up 25 according to Quinnipiac
Interesting. I have no idea who she is, but apparently  is very well respected in Congress   - whoever you choose, please make sure your VP pick will help and not hurt the ticket (as we have seen other campaigns do)
Yet you forget that Biden called Trump xenophobic for closing the Chinese border....
I’m definitely voting Biden, now bc Lindsey Graham and Biden are buddies.
And you want Joe “you ain’t black” Biden to win?????
Yes. 500 EVs for Biden bc Orange Man Bad!
Nah. Sarah says it’s over. Biden will get 500 EVs guaranteed
But Quinnipiac has Biden up 15! Your poll is wrong
But Biden has it locked. Don’t even vote. 450+ EVs. Ask Sarah.
Dated October 25th 2019. I may not like Biden. But we can't have another 4 years of Trump.
Maybe you should apologize for your comments about Biden on April 24.

100% I stopped defending what he says &amp; tweets long ago. I will let Rush make money doing that.  Trump has done a lot right, I give him credit. Democrats as a group are less deserving. Biden is a dementia patient.  If I had a better option I would kick Trump/GOP to the curb.

That’s bc Biden is up 16!

There are 96 days until the election. Have you done everything you can to make sure Joe Biden gets elected? #Biden2020
"Three months ago, Joe Biden predicted that President Trump would eventually try to delay the November election - and Republicans laughed" #TrumpDelay #FascismHasComeToAmerica #gapol #Biden2020
This is literally Joe Biden's own words and tweets, but let's see if Twitter find a magical way to take this down or restrict it...
That won’t be possible until 2024 and Biden won’t remember who he is by then. Can only remember now on occasion!
Until Biden is removed, you’re going to continue to forget.
Yeah. Probably the same. GW Bush has limited speaking ability, yet he always took the right tone when speaking and came off as a good person when he spoke. I’d put Biden on a similar level.
Secret Service can handle it. They'll drag his fat azz out back door as soon as Biden sworn in.  #FascistGOP  #VoteBlue #70DayDeadlyDelay #HandMarkedPaperBallots
Nah, wait until your dad's last debate with Biden. This will be the blow to Biden's chance.  Just like the Hillary email scandal!
I can’t promise that my family is voting for Biden? 🙄 I’m pretty sure I can and we are....
Obama and Biden left Trump a Pandemic Response Plan, a Pandemic Response Office, and 44 infectious disease experts in China which he ignored the plan and got rid of the office and disease experts
In the Trump era, it’s quaintly funny that Biden was previously able to take the “gaffe master” title when political competition was far less   Biden finally found a proper use of his “gaffes” now that “says what he means” is important to the electorate
Isn’t this what the Biden people want? Rich and poor mixed. You got it
It’s elder abuse what they’re doing to Biden 😞
Mars- looks like disclosure may be soon so we need to choose. We have not mastered your human language well enough to understand Biden..
Do you realize idiot American became energy independent during Obama/Biden.   Do I realize Vet choice was signed by Obama.  WHY DO U CONSTANTLY LIE????
I live in a mostly white suburb of Atlanta and I’m a shy Biden voter. It goes both ways.
If Biden wins and the Dems get the Senate, we will become a banana republic.
Biden is even more ahead of where Clinton was at this point. Duh.
Why bizarrely? They(with Sanders) have convinced a generation of young people that the most revolutionary thing you could do is vote Biden. They, like BLM, are useful tools of the Dem party.
Maybe we can turn Georgia blue!! We’re working on it!
Ummmmm....became cognitively impaired??!!! Biden’s wife is a doctor. She parades him around by his arm. Hello!!! The guy is a puppet and Mrs joe Biden should be ashamed. Maybe we will be voting for her to get to the white house. TRUMP 2020!!!!!!!!!!!
I have sad his ability to win is about his VP (soon to be President if Biden wins).  I presume your decision is whether to vote Biden or not at all.
Yeah it does, tRump has called BLM terrorist organization, he just waiting for RBG to die and you wanna say Biden/Harris is equal to tRump. GtFOH.
Bernie supporters are worse than Trump supporters with their delusions. My goodness. Biden won because more people, by far, voted for him. Not any DNC conspiracy. Socialism isn’t popular here, maybe try an actual socialist country if that’s what you want .
Is it me? Or was it obvious to everyone, Biden pre arranged which reporters he would call on, what  the questions were going to be,  and was able to answer with notes. At his presser yesterday.
Calling it now: If Biden wins Trump is gonna tweet that clip from Wolf of Wall Street of Leo going “I’m not leaving”
Whoa, here's a level of Kool-Aid drinking I haven't come across in awhile. Lets debate, shall we? You can't use anything by Fox News, OANN, whataboutisms or say the words Democrats, Hilary, Biden or Obama. Now, tell me why the smartest people in the world should not be in charge.
I don't think there will be a debate. VP's yes, Trump/Biden no.  Trump is that polarizing, that crass, that much of a jerk that he may lose to a dementia patient.  If he would just act like he does without Twitter, when the journalist aren't there he would do better.
Trump is correct. They are way behind, but, most of Europe is afraid of a large militarized German Army. Maybe Biden can strike a deal where they can put money towards US &amp; Canada budgets that defend Europe? Non compliance leaves them vulnerable to demagogues like Trump.
We need to get these smear type ads that are full of false information out of our politics. Biden has been on record saying he is against defunding the police and defunding is to reduce the military gear not the whole police department
Also. Not sure why people are getting mad at Biden for condemning people who take advantage of protests to riot and break shit.
Unsurprisingly, people on the left are freaking out because Biden isn't pro-anarchist (despite condemning the DHS for the unlawful assault on peaceful protesters)...
Hold up, wasn't Biden up by 5 gazillion points yesterday? 🤔
As a conservative who will vote for Trump because I am voting against Biden I disagree with your second sentence, your 3rd is only marginally true.  We need need more Eric Ericksons conservatives with a conscience and principles that transcend both culture and cult of personality
I normally agree with my fellow  writer  but this time I must dissent. This election is about one man: Donald J. Trump. Biden may as well be a potted plant.
Added to Harris’ Woke Resume and faxed to Joe Biden’s front porch.
Yes, but its not going to be with Biden!
That’s BS. Biden has no cognitive issues &amp; Trump is the same he’s always been - a delusional narcissist (well, that may be an oxymoron).
Calling this Biden's America is some top shelf projection. Trump doesn't want to win an election. He wants to steal one.
I prefer Val Demings for VP and Kamala for AG...but it doesn't matter. I'd vote for Biden's toenail as long as we get Trump out.
A is unlikely with Biden keeping a low profile.
Things can change if: A. Biden MAJORLY screws up.  B. Trump regains trust on handling the pandemic.
"And Biden, who will turn 78 weeks after the November election, has said it’s critical his running mate is ready to be president from the first day."  The plan is to get him elected and then, *insert cause of death here*  The VEEP will be POTUS, not him.
Biden: I will be more pro-war than Trump! The state of modern liberalism.
What does that have to do with her ability to govern? Why does that matter about her? What about Biden’s lineage?
No surprise, he is an obnoxious, loud mouth, lying POS.    Falsely Accuses Biden Of Spying On Trump  via
I am so concerned about the extreme divisions that produced this joke of a  hearing. I sincerely hope that Biden is elected and can pull us together
The reporting today about Biden, Dodd, and Kamala Harris makes me think that the people around Biden are very unenthusiastic about the idea of a black woman as a VP, and given their willingness to humiliate Abrams, and comments today, it's probably a bad job.
Obama and Biden did ZERO COVID testing!
Wow. I’ve noticed the same about some of Trump’s ads about Biden, enlarging his forehead to make him look scarier.
stop eating our own-judicial appoints are TOO important!! Pick a side-support Biden OR allow lifelong trump policies. TODAY, there’s no inbetween. Many in FLA &amp; other states will lose their VOTE. #RIPGOP

Bad ass!! Thank you!
There will be no debates. Biden won't do any interviews. He'll only campaign from his basement.
...Joe Biden is offering his own presidential campaign hats "MASHA" ...Making America a Shit Hole Again...
I enjoy your enthusiasm for Biden even if I don't share it. So I will wholeheartedly agree, I am happy with anyone he picks. He had the job, he is qualified to pick the VP, that is that. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
My 21-year-old is voting. He knows it's the only way to get Trump the f**k out of office. He has some friends who are Bernie Bros who don't want to vote for Biden though.
How many doctors have seen a legit death caused by Marijuana?  Yet, it remains in the same federal class as heroin.  And Biden calls it a gateway drug that needs more studies. Trump needs to push decriminalization, obviously the FDA cannot be trusted.
You do realize that  is a nut case. He is not and never was a Conservative. You may be a conservative but you have no one that you can vote for. Biden is at least a moderate and he is not stupid and self aggrandizing.
By the way. We are on the same side. I will vote for Biden. I was a Conservative for many years. I cannot align myself with the McConnell group that can’t call themselves Republican. I am a law and order person, but under the Constitution with integrity.
You don’t get to have it both ways moron. It’s either Trump’s America and he’s in charge or he has to STAY OUT OF CITIES for you to put the blame on Democrats that run the cities. You are pointing out Trump’s America and even suggesting it’s Biden’s is beyond stupid.
Am I the only one thinking there's no way Joe Biden knows how to retweet?
Both political parties are stupid and bad as they both weaponize human rights and other important topics to bring the other down. Next time someone says only Republicans are bad, just make sure they know Biden said “if you don’t vote for me you aren’t black.”
I'm no biden supporter but this is how u honor and respect a great person trump is NO PRESIDENT!   #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
The sad part is Biden has a chance only because Trump is a polarizing jerk. Re: John Lewis lying in state at the Capitol.
please talk to your followers. I follow many of the more prominent ones here in Twitter. They are unhappy they didnt get more of what they want in the democratic platform. They are now saying they won't vote for Biden. Please talk to them. That helps trump.
Voting for Biden so... yeah. In case I forgot to say it today: Resign. You’re an embarrassment.
To not take a position on Trump’s re-election is to take a position. You don’t need to be a Biden surrogate, but to say Trump’s re-election isn’t a big deal is just silly
You don’t get to have it both ways moron. It’s either Trump’s America and he’s in charge or he has to STAY OUT OF CITIES for you to put the blame on Democrats that run the cities. You are pointing out Trump’s America and even suggesting it’s Biden’s is beyond stupid.

They backed Biden because they had no viable path to victory and because after Bernie spent the campaign trashing Democrats and their base, he definitely wasn't getting their support.
Apparently, they're still going with the Biden is a Republican argument.
Ah, yes. The "Joe Biden is a Republican" strawman.
Did his lies kill over 100,000 himself? No? We good then. I'll ride with Biden, Bugs Bunny, or Satan himself over Trump. You read this and shake your head and think "how can someone be so blind to everything? Hate for pure hate isn't a reason to support someone terrible." EXACTLY

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I hate to burst your bubble, but come November the choice will be between Biden and Trump. 100 days before the election is not the time to pretend otherwise.
I can't in good conscience vote for Biden or Trump.
You are simply wrong. If it comes to pass that Biden wins you will weep for your ignorance.
I wish you would shut the fuck up. Biden was not my choice either but with all the extra mess you keep saying about him people are listening. We must get Trump out of office. Stop bad mouthing Biden you could detour people from voting.
Biden is the puppet of Obama! That is why Obama runs around on sinister errands to help Biden to be the President in case he can control the whole! The real dictatorship is from Obama! Obama brainwashes  us with so called “politically right”!
Why do you want to beat Biden off?!?
Actually Biden is the puppet of Obama. Obama is the one who wants the power of the United States. The only reason they choose Biden is that Biden is obedient! They will not accept anything except Obama gets the real power as a president of the US!
Voting Biden is the most conformist thing one could do. He is a longtime cheerleader of DHS(not to mention the Iraq War and the ‘Patriot Act’). The protestors are seething with anger but fatally confused as they have no politics other than vote blue.
DHS shocktroops march through the city and the protestors have no politics..they can’t win. Their only message is corporate sponsored racialism and the pathetic mumble vote Biden. DHS was created by the Democrats
Trump has done one thing right... (I know not popular) Cutting off Huawei is a smart move and I hope will be continued by Biden. Huawei is a security risk and heavily subsidized by Chinese government!

Same here re: Sanders.  My concern as well. Democrats can be as bad as republicans when they turn their eyes away from wrongdoing in their party. I don't intend to let Biden get away with a damn thing.
Given the tragic state of international affairs this lying tied has put us in, I think it is critical that he select Susan Rice who can immediately hit the ground running...Biden will have his hands so full cleaning up the domestic shit show Donny has left.

Since they are saying this now. Does it mean we get to hear Biden for the next four years explain his loss like Hillary?
You're not a bot, you're just reposting bot posts, got it. Disproved again. You're really not good at this.
... until Biden is elected. 😂
Please refer to 2 previous statements of conjecture. There is NOTHING Biden could do right now to lose. Keep trying to make something stick though. Your frustration is cute.
Great, is Biden Trump? No? We're good. This blind hatred for one side without looking at the common sense/smack you in the face facts....it's frustrating ain't it?
Wait, is Biden Trump? No? Then we're good. You can't possibly post half the legitimate stories of corruption that you have living in your house sir. Again, there's no defending Trump. I won't allow it. The only thing that should be discussed right now is Covid, yet here you are..

Joe Biden please pick your running mate and I will decide if I will vote for you! Something is not right with this guy #JoeBiden
Cie just hates Biden and can’t think for himself.
Cie, this is a truly dopey take on your part. Ine if the dumber takes I’ve read in this whole situation. It’s not like Trump paid attention to any of the advice or preparation Obama and Biden left behind for him. What practically do you think Biden could’ve done differently?
As much as I don't want Biden to win, I pray for a honest transparent election.  One of the most dangerous situations we all face is a failed election and transition of power.  Regardless of who wins, if compromised  it will cause bloodshed.  Our foreign enemies know this.

I’m voting for Biden so I can sleep at night and not wake up and wonder what fresh new hell awaits us. Peace - that’s why I’m voting for Joe #Biden2020
So he did it after the fact. Typical. One thing he has done is shown all the weaknesses in our laws. I really hope when Biden is elected and the Senate is cleansed of the traitors, congress will shore up these holes and codify norms to protect our country
No, it’s “all of these violent crimes you’re seeing under my watch would...continue under a Biden administration?” Do even the most ardent Trump supporters buy that garbage?
If these polls are accurate reflection of voter sentiment Ohio has to be at worst even. Iowa lean Biden? ...Indiana? ...Missouri?
Shame on Biden for claiming our president is racist. I should say who I’d devicive now?  Remember if you “don’t vote for Biden you are not black”
What the hell are they talking about. The responsibility of electing a president belongs to the states as defined in the Constitution. The thing that scares me is the period from when  loses and when Biden is sworn in. We have to solve that problem.
Suburban Mom of 4 in GA- I haven’t left the house since March because of your negligent handling of COVID. You &amp;  have trapped my family inside.   I will happily vote for Biden, and I will march in the streets if you send your gestapo to our town. #BLM #TrumpsGestapo
YOU TELLING white people  BIDEN WILL LET all blacks &amp; Mexicans or Cubans in?? Only trump can save you? WHAT IS WRONG  WITH GOP.  THAT IS A 1960s SCARE TACTIC.  GUESS WHAT SUBURBS  ARE ALREADY
Your lack of decency is absolutely glaring in comparison to Biden. Obama didn’t publicly endorse Biden until he did, because he didn’t want to appear to be placing a thumb on the scales. Patience, good judgment. You would have no understanding of the importance of such things.

Nah. 440 EVs for Biden bc his enthusiastic, energetic, transformative candidacy will bring out ppl in epic proportion. Utah’s in play too.
Followed and retweeted
Probably. If Trumps leading expect to randomly find 200K Biden ballots in a trunk of a car
Nah, Biden up 25 according to Quinnipiac
I’m definitely voting Biden, now bc Lindsey Graham and Biden are buddies.
Yes. 500 EVs for Biden bc Orange Man Bad!
Nah. Sarah says it’s over. Biden will get 500 EVs guaranteed
But Quinnipiac has Biden up 15! Your poll is wrong
But Biden has it locked. Don’t even vote. 450+ EVs. Ask Sarah.
Maybe you should apologize for your comments about Biden on April 24.
100% I stopped defending what he says &amp; tweets long ago. I will let Rush make money doing that.  Trump has done a lot right, I give him credit. Democrats as a group are less deserving. Biden is a dementia patient.  If I had a better option I would kick Trump/GOP to the curb.
Technically won't be night yet in California when they declare Florida and Pennsylvania for Biden the instant the polls close.
Amazing! BIDEN 2020
500 EVs for Biden. He gets Manitoba too.
That’s bc Biden is up 16!
Biden still gets 440. Utah is a lock for my man. Will be over by 8PM EST.
Why can't we have a BIDEN OBAMA ticket in 2020!!!!
This will be undone by President Biden.
Says an American who don't know what he saying like the heck its vote for Biden vote for someone who don't even know what he saying if you've seen his rallys
What truth does Biden have he doesn't even know what he's saying yell Americans don't think yall just say biden is better when the guy is just plain dumb
Yo alr if Biden wins no more police and borders open so you will let in cartels and raise crime alot also im Mexican and ik what Mexico is so what yell will be letting in is not great at all
"Three months ago, Joe Biden predicted that President Trump would eventually try to delay the November election - and Republicans laughed" #TrumpDelay #FascismHasComeToAmerica #gapol #Biden2020
I have seen the polls Joe Biden, on the National average you are leading by 9, and either tied or leading in most of the 50 states! Our next PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS JOE BIDEN! WE ARE WITH YOU! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
That won’t be possible until 2024 and Biden won’t remember who he is by then. Can only remember now on occasion!
Nah, wait until your dad's last debate with Biden. This will be the blow to Biden's chance.  Just like the Hillary email scandal!
Obama and Biden left Trump a Pandemic Response Plan, a Pandemic Response Office, and 44 infectious disease experts in China which he ignored the plan and got rid of the office and disease experts
Isn’t this what the Biden people want? Rich and poor mixed. You got it
It’s elder abuse what they’re doing to Biden 😞
Mars- looks like disclosure may be soon so we need to choose. We have not mastered your human language well enough to understand Biden..
I will support Biden no matter who he chooses as VP. But, it strikes me as odd that critics of Senator Harris point to her hit on Biden on busing in the debate. Politics is a contact sport and shots like that are taken all the time.
Polls showing that Biden and Trump are tied in the Georgia polls at 47%. This is a state that has been Republican for the last 8 years. Americans are showing they are NOT satisfied with the way Trump has handled the Coronavirus, race relations, the economy and his poor leadership
Polls showing that Biden and Trump are tied with 47% in Georgia. This state has been Republican for the last 8 years. Other states are showing that people are tired of the Trump rants and foolishness over the Coronavirus, race relations, the economy and inept leadership!
Maybe we can turn Georgia blue!! We’re working on it!
Looks like it's a legit if hamhanded attempt to persuade bitter Bernie fans to do the right thing, knowing there's no way to sell them on Biden as a candidate they'll like. Grownup lefties who get the concept of half a loaf being better than none. No sense it comes from Biden.
Ummmmm....became cognitively impaired??!!! Biden’s wife is a doctor. She parades him around by his arm. Hello!!! The guy is a puppet and Mrs joe Biden should be ashamed. Maybe we will be voting for her to get to the white house. TRUMP 2020!!!!!!!!!!!
I have sad his ability to win is about his VP (soon to be President if Biden wins).  I presume your decision is whether to vote Biden or not at all.
Who else makes fun of Biden from that angle?
Yeah it does, tRump has called BLM terrorist organization, he just waiting for RBG to die and you wanna say Biden/Harris is equal to tRump. GtFOH.
It's not from the Biden campaign. It's from a bunch of lefty smartasses.
Calling it now: If Biden wins Trump is gonna tweet that clip from Wolf of Wall Street of Leo going “I’m not leaving”
I don't think there will be a debate. VP's yes, Trump/Biden no.  Trump is that polarizing, that crass, that much of a jerk that he may lose to a dementia patient.  If he would just act like he does without Twitter, when the journalist aren't there he would do better.
We need to get these smear type ads that are full of false information out of our politics. Biden has been on record saying he is against defunding the police and defunding is to reduce the military gear not the whole police department
We could take all their help and then tell them to fuck off, but Biden is going to Biden. He will give Republicans some seats at the table.  That turned out so well for JFK!
As a conservative who will vote for Trump because I am voting against Biden I disagree with your second sentence, your 3rd is only marginally true.  We need need more Eric Ericksons conservatives with a conscience and principles that transcend both culture and cult of personality
Yes, but its not going to be with Biden!
That’s BS. Biden has no cognitive issues &amp; Trump is the same he’s always been - a delusional narcissist (well, that may be an oxymoron).
Calling this Biden's America is some top shelf projection. Trump doesn't want to win an election. He wants to steal one.
Biden is going to Biden. If only some people had seen this rightward turn going into the general election.
"And Biden, who will turn 78 weeks after the November election, has said it’s critical his running mate is ready to be president from the first day."  The plan is to get him elected and then, *insert cause of death here*  The VEEP will be POTUS, not him.
What does that have to do with her ability to govern? Why does that matter about her? What about Biden’s lineage?
No surprise, he is an obnoxious, loud mouth, lying POS.    Falsely Accuses Biden Of Spying On Trump  via
The reporting today about Biden, Dodd, and Kamala Harris makes me think that the people around Biden are very unenthusiastic about the idea of a black woman as a VP, and given their willingness to humiliate Abrams, and comments today, it's probably a bad job.
Wow. I’ve noticed the same about some of Trump’s ads about Biden, enlarging his forehead to make him look scarier.
Bad ass!! Thank you!
There will be no debates. Biden won't do any interviews. He'll only campaign from his basement.
Somehow these people keep getting elected. Then they keep voting/legislating against the people. I just banged my head when Biden got the nomination. When will we learn? I was hoping the tide was turning. Not yet.
...Joe Biden is offering his own presidential campaign hats "MASHA" ...Making America a Shit Hole Again...
How many doctors have seen a legit death caused by Marijuana?  Yet, it remains in the same federal class as heroin.  And Biden calls it a gateway drug that needs more studies. Trump needs to push decriminalization, obviously the FDA cannot be trusted.
You do realize that  is a nut case. He is not and never was a Conservative. You may be a conservative but you have no one that you can vote for. Biden is at least a moderate and he is not stupid and self aggrandizing.
By the way. We are on the same side. I will vote for Biden. I was a Conservative for many years. I cannot align myself with the McConnell group that can’t call themselves Republican. I am a law and order person, but under the Constitution with integrity.
Am I the only one thinking there's no way Joe Biden knows how to retweet?
I'm no biden supporter but this is how u honor and respect a great person trump is NO PRESIDENT!   #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Step 1: Elect Joe Biden getting Trump out of office, while flipping the senate.   Step 2: Quit voting for DLC Establishment Dems and elect actual progressives. Primary everybody!
The sad part is Biden has a chance only because Trump is a polarizing jerk. Re: John Lewis lying in state at the Capitol.
I would bukkake Joe Biden’s hair plugs
If I were Joe Biden, I wouldn’t show up!
please talk to your followers. I follow many of the more prominent ones here in Twitter. They are unhappy they didnt get more of what they want in the democratic platform. They are now saying they won't vote for Biden. Please talk to them. That helps trump.
I don't see that calling Biden a Marxists. Being a "tool" doesn't necessarily make you the thing of which you are a tool.  Are Democrats Marxists, no Are Antifa and BLM Marxists political movement groups, yes Are Democrats benefiting and supporting their riots to get elected, yes
See what happens to health care if trump wins rellection. You are such a hypocrite, by bashing biden you help trump who is trying to take health care away from 20 million people.
Group is quietly planning for what happens if Trump-Biden election is contested
Curious, do people actually want Biden or do they just want Trump gone?
Jill Biden will obliterate it as the Biden Administration will race to erase Donald from the annals. “Useless people.”
Sure I want Biden to pick  for #VP. If he doesn’t, does it change my mind? No.  could select Hank Hill for Veep; and I’m still voting for him.
And an empty chair with "Biden" appears at the end.  Clint Eastwood would be proud.
He'll preemptively pardon himself and everyone in his family, but it probably won't hold up in court. He doesn't DO that much; he spends most of the day watching TV and tweeting and occasionally signing some godawful executive order that Biden will reverse by March.
Ah ha!  I just knew they would bring this one back.  Are you afraid yet!  Joe Biden will solve the murder hornets problem by bringing us together, because together America can do anything.
I swear, instead of distributing yard signs and bumper stickers, Biden should work a deal with coronavirus test manufacturers and distribute covid tests. Trump's head would spin and America would heal.
Life in Joe Biden’s Democrat controlled America.💯

Joe Biden is not progressive. He is going to Biden. I will vote for him but will keep my expectations very low.
I wish you would shut the fuck up. Biden was not my choice either but with all the extra mess you keep saying about him people are listening. We must get Trump out of office. Stop bad mouthing Biden you could detour people from voting.
Why do you want to beat Biden off?!?
Biden sniffs kids.
A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll revealed that just 13% of voters say their vote is up for grabs in the presidential election   via   &gt; ...Exactly as expected.  Can we go ahead and vote and save everyone's time and money?
You sir are a hero.  We need more people like you. I'm sure in the coming months you will have a prominent role in our country's security once the biden administration is in charge.
Biden's in the Lead..and you can still make it a LANDSLIDE....Oh...No, Not The presidential Polls at
As Eric Erickson has pointed out, politics is downhill from society. We have stage 4 cancer, the election is a bandaid, and people think it matters. Progressive Democrat policies got us here but a Biden meat puppet Presidency won't hurt that much more, and Trump won't fix it.
Since they are saying this now. Does it mean we get to hear Biden for the next four years explain his loss like Hillary?
Biden’s America
If you vote Biden, it’s gonna be 50%. Democrats LIVE to raise taxes...and I’m socially liberal
Joe Biden please pick your running mate and I will decide if I will vote for you! Something is not right with this guy #JoeBiden
As much as I don't want Biden to win, I pray for a honest transparent election.  One of the most dangerous situations we all face is a failed election and transition of power.  Regardless of who wins, if compromised  it will cause bloodshed.  Our foreign enemies know this.
The point being that Biden is not ALL THERE!
Thomas Sowell: Joe Biden win could signal ‘point of no return for this country’ -  -
I’m voting for Biden so I can sleep at night and not wake up and wonder what fresh new hell awaits us. Peace - that’s why I’m voting for Joe #Biden2020
So he did it after the fact. Typical. One thing he has done is shown all the weaknesses in our laws. I really hope when Biden is elected and the Senate is cleansed of the traitors, congress will shore up these holes and codify norms to protect our country
By the way, that's who would be calling the shots if Biden wins. It would be Obama's third term.
What the hell are they talking about. The responsibility of electing a president belongs to the states as defined in the Constitution. The thing that scares me is the period from when  loses and when Biden is sworn in. We have to solve that problem.
Suburban Mom of 4 in GA- I haven’t left the house since March because of your negligent handling of COVID. You &amp;  have trapped my family inside.   I will happily vote for Biden, and I will march in the streets if you send your gestapo to our town. #BLM #TrumpsGestapo
Had to turn off  just now on  Seriously, with everything that’s going on, you are really concerned about Biden not meeting more with reporters? As in 2016 I’m also seeing an alarming degree of false equivalency again. Get a grip!
Un the guy Im voting for president (Biden) wants to find community policing as well  Hate how you think all people who support a cause supports everything to that. Don’t conservatives care about STATES rights, now you want FEDERAL troops??????
It’s him being indirect, he knows Trump won’t pívot but it’s also important that young people and minorities show out  It is a dumb way to put it though but he can’t openly support Biden
Yhat’s GREAT !!! I would add the biggest supporter, the CCP, all their chips are with Biden
...the Obama's, Clinton's, Biden's, Pelosi's and Schumer's all work for Chy-na...prove me wrong...
In a Democrat city, in a Democrat state. Why haven’t the mayor and governor stepped up to protect people and businesses and take back Portland?? It’s their JOB. Joe Biden doesn’t condemn it. No Democrat has. This would be Joe Biden’s America.
So now it’s anything goes and trump has shown Americans that the president can break any rules or laws that he wants to! So now Biden can do anything he wants to when he’s elected president.
And where’s #SleepyJoe?   “...Biden’s campaign still has little organizational footprint in Georgia...”  #Sad!
That's the cover story - it's a Marxist uprising licking it's chops for the Biden/Harris utopia.Reported Biden later added,  “These are the same people you  see putting clean fingers in their ears.”
Reported that Joe Biden said Dr. Fauci is right - no one has died from the virus who has placed Duck tape over their mouth and nose, then super glued their eyes shut.
is a wanna be authoritarian dictator.  He doesn't care what the US Constitution says. He wants chaos, violence &amp; power.  Does anyone think Trump is ever going to call Biden to concede the election?  He could lose 340 million to 1 and he would not congratulate Joe
If Biden won't go, Trump should still show up and debate an empty podium.  The podium might do better than Joe would have.
Biden, decency?  Ha Ha.  Sorry, but the only thing I can give him is empathy.  He is not a leader and he also lacks decency.  Calling somebody fat because they don't agree with him?  Yeah, really classy.
Biden=communism/marxism for our country
Nothing Trump does would please you!  Know you’re rooting for Biden!
The choice between Trump and Biden is that Trump knows where he is. Biden has to be led around.
You prefer Biden?
You and 70,000,000 people in this country. Or as Biden said, 70 billion.

Biden is the bait and Obama is the switch in the Democratic party
Yes, a group of Republicans that are going to vote for Biden. That’s a good thing
Biden is the bait and Obama is the switch in this election coup
When Biden becomes President, he needs to get busy rehiring and medalling all the heroes the current Republican screwed over. Fauci, McCabe, Vindman...
It doesn't matter who Biden picks as VP. If Biden is elected Obama will run the country just 2 blocks down from the White House in his own home. Wake up America. Biden is a Socialism front man.
That's... *a* way to spin Biden's plan, I suppose.
biden isn’t any better pandering black people is racist.Biden IS on the list. Trump isn’t.
What an incompetent point of view. These pie in the sky ideas would reduce America to third world status.  And would desimate the third world. Do you really think masser Biden could  end conflicts around the world better than President
