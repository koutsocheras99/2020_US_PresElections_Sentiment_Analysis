I agree with you that Trump is not that clever. However, it seems clear to me he’s spent money on a very good research team that does coach him. Let’s face it, he’s an absolute favorite of people who are on the far right. He echos what they believe. He caters to the US idiot.
Donald Trump has happened!  The Republicans are co-conspirators!
I hope you read the book written by his niece who is a Psychologist!  Mary Trump writes Too Much and Never Enough! You will understand Donald and that there is nothing authentic about him which was the fault of his father!  That family was dysfunctional! Pitiful!

I may mess this up, but here goes.  Covid19 isn't Trump's fault Sars wasn't Obama's fault Swine Flu wasn't Bush's fault and only a couple cases of Chlamydia where Clinton's fault.
That’s a lame list of whataboutisms. Biden has insulted just about everyone. Trump didn’t ignore any virus, and joe is a gaff machine. Try harder. What about trumps policies could be improved if biden took the seat?
How can he last for 4 years he has early dementia already? Trump 2020!!
Fact. I was blue all my life. Then I saw blue turn on my country. Trump caught me off guard and brought hope and action. He is showing us this is our America and we deserve so much more. #walkaway
Won’t work. I thought trump supporters looked like this, until I woke up and became one. #walkaway
On top of that, Trump stated that this has never been done before. He is either unaware of, or lying about, the fact that the ACA established the mandatory coverage of preexisting conditions long ago.

Not sure what your problem is Jason. The last time the GOP tanked the economy a democrat fixed it, which led to the longest bull market in history &amp; you made tons of $$$. It took tRump less than 4 yrs to utterly destroy the economy. So a Democrat has to come in &amp; fix it. Again.

You idiots. Biden is not tRump2. 4 more yrs of tRump means SCOTUS &amp; courts loaded with RWNJ judges, putting progressive policies out of reach for another generation. It means you may not be able to vote at all in 2024. It means intensified persecution of LBGTQ &amp; immigrants. 🤬
All it does is sanitize very destructive movements and lets them off the hook from confronting their complicity in Trump and the state of American Christianity

I'm behind on Twitter. So Trump mispronounced a country, and then Dinesh D'Souza pompously claimed the rest of humanity is actually pronouncing it wrong? And he keeps doubling down? Am I missing something?
Explain … what exactly?  Most of these are extremely reasonable, especially when you know that he has a mild stutter.  Also, criticizing Biden for "not talk too good" while supporting Trump is *really rich*.
The way Republicans enabled Trump, disgusts me. So after watching this **** show, in my world never Trump means never voting for a Republican ever again.
Please clarify whether these rankings are inclusive of the people Trump has murdered due to his incompetent handing of COVID.
It appears you're unaware Trump has a long history of much worse racist behavior, dating to his working for his Father's company and his developer days. Please look it up.
Schools are merely publicly funded babysitting. Curriculum is greatly flawed. Kids are only missing seeing friends. If critical thinking was taught, Trump wouldn’t be in office. Opening schools has zero value during this pandemic.

Joe Biden shouldn't call people junkies. Am I shocked that he did? Absolutely not. Has he been awful, re: drug policy in the past? Oh, yes.   Which administration would be better for people with SUD, Trump 2020 or Biden 2020?  That's super easy.
1. Biden refers to people as junkies  2. Trump praises Duterte, who has people who use drugs killed  Hmmmmmm
Is anyone surprised trump calls Thailand, “Thigh land”?!?! Big shock. Huge.  I mean, uh, YUGE.

Lol I'm not the one taking soundbites then twisting into some delusion of insanity. Trump has aced his cognitive assessment test every time meanwhile Biden refuses saying it's asking a coke addict to take a drug test though he doesn't say it as coherent.
It wouldn’t shock me if Trump is doing these miss pronunciations on purpose. He will blame losing the election on failing health. In doing so he will gain sympathy from those who follow him. He doesn’t care about his opposition. Only the % who follow him.
More jobs were outsourced in Trump's first year than in Obama's last.

Has anyone else noticed that new cases have been on the decline ever since the Trump administration started bypassing the CDC?  The surge reversed overnight, and I'm not buying it. I bet we're past 100k/day now.

It’s the NRA and their lobbying that needs to disappear... no one will take away anyones 2nd amendment right. Trump is all BS.

Zero "babies" are killed by Planned Parenthood. Baby is a term of endearment used for a BORN infant. However, the NRA is responsible for killing actual babies. So is the tRump administration.  Take a seat and get a vasectomy, Bubba.
We need to stand against Trump's racism! ..with Biden's racism?
I think McConnell is likely polling worse because he just isn't loved in Kentucky. Graham is in trouble. Trump only got 54% of the vote in SC in 16. If it drops to say 52%, and Graham is under-performing Trump, then it will be tight. I don't think that is a crazy scenario.
I just thought the ratings comment was funny because Trump has bragged about ratings more than any president in my lifetime lol
I assume that version of the story is that Trump made the phone call in part because he felt relieved after Mueller's testimony. Then fallout from the phone call led to Coats' departure.
Anyone who voted for Biden might as well be working for Trump.
I was reflecting that right now the prevailing explanation for why Coats left ODNI is at least indirectly linked to Mueller's testimony. Trump made his infamous Ukraine phone call on July 25th, the day after Mueller's testimony on the Hill.
Trump can't pardon the State charges either... imagine the treasure trove of information that's going to come out of this investigation.  It's going to be awesome.
It could be that having Cyrus Vance leading the charge against the Trump Org makes me a little nervous, since he failed to prosecute them before.
A few months ago, Biden told Black Americans they "ain't Black" if they don't support him, implying all Black Americans must think the same.  Today, he said the quiet part out loud.
It's fine that Tish James is taking on the NRA, but I was hoping for something related to Trump's business. It really is mind-boggling how he was able to get away with so much fraud and other crime for so long, launching himself into the White House on it.
It's perfectly obvious that the Trump Org, in its current incarnation, was conceived in tax fraud, in passing down from Fred Trump. DT and his children then engaged in more tax fraud, then massive bank and insurance fraud, plus money laundering from international criminals.

But Trump is racist....ok🙄🙄🙄

I'm pretty sure the ven diagram for people who are racist and people who support Trump has a fairly significant overlap
I'd like to know about Trump specifically as well on this question.
She's not talking about trump. Fuck.
Is there, though? Trump and his cronies have largely proven otherwise so far.
Yes, sounds familiar,  But the parallel is the trans-cult,  not drumpf. 'McCarthy' depicts an affable liar with fearsome power. Sound familiar?
He's a yes man and in a way, more dangerous than Trump because he knows the political game and doesn't just run his mouth like Trump.
Trump talks too much and NEVER listens. He lies so much he has no clue what the truth is. I don't believe a word he says.
🗣️ Americans deserve to watch Joe Biden &amp; President Trump debate before they cast their ballots.   Pass it on.

"In a time when many Nevadans can’t go to church because of overreaching restrictions, President Trump’s campaign is bringing together evangelicals from across the community to pray, worship and discuss key issues facing Americans in the... election"

This is even worse than we’d thought.  Those of you who voted for Trump so his SCOTUS appointees could overturn Roe, do you care about living children? Now would be a good time to speak up...
Check out the new Trump 2020 pin.
Good Morning to everyone except Joe Biden, who called President Trump’s life-saving China travel restrictions “xenophobic” and opposed them for months.  Experts credit the President’s decision with saving countless lives.
Even with a Biden loving/Trump hating moderator panel, I don't think there is enough they could do to save Joe in a debate... could let Joe do most of the talking and win easily.  Joe's going to finish himself if they debate at all.

by their logic of endangering public safety, why has twitter allowed trump to continue tweeting? saw reporting that fauci needs security for his children now due to death threats.
Joe Biden bizarrely lashed out at a Black reporter, asked him if he was a junkie, &amp; struggled to finish his sentence.  "Oh well just Joe being Joe!" shrugs the media who has given this almost no coverage.  IMAGINE the coverage if this were President Trump.
Joe Biden wants to allow illegal immigrants to flood across US borders without consequence.  This is no longer just a security issue, it's a health issue.  President Trump's strong border policies have protected the health and safety of Americans during the coronavirus crisis.
We've terminated unwanted pregnancies for hundreds of thousands of years before man invented your regressive religion.  If you cared about human lives, you wouldn't support tRump. Thousands of actual children are in cages, yet here you are upset about a Z.E.F.

The debates, as organized by the media, would be stacked against Trump. But Biden’s deficiencies might still make it worthwhile for Trump. It’s hard to say. It’s obvious the media are not interested in fairness. Will they offer an unacceptable deal and blame Trump for refusing?

RIP: Joe Biden Buried By Trump Campaign’s Ground Game
But if he was just cover for the real investigation, which was happening elsewhere in the FBI and/or ODNI, then Trump and Barr were spooked by Mueller's revelation that it was still ongoing, and tried to shut it down by getting rid of Coats.
p.s. If it's not clear, the theory is that Trump and Barr assumed Mueller was conducting the counterintelligence investigation into the president, but had been stymied by parameters placed by Rosenstein and then Barr coming in and wrapping it up.
Johnathan, if one person criticizes Biden and someone else responds by saying that Trump is "worse", that's called a "comparison"  I've attached the definitions of both the noun "comparison" and the verb "to compare" for clarity

Trump will have a second term.   It's not about winning the election. Its about winning the count.
Johnathan, I don’t know if you know this but in November there will be an election where voters will have to between “Joe Biden” and “Donald Trump”. That’s why people always compare the two  Hope this clears things up for you
I'm still not sure that any of that translates into a sensational report, however, just because of the layers of Trump control still going on. Are we really going to get some of Trump's financials and ties to Russia in a report going through a GOP-controlled committee?
Americans deserve a chance to watch their Presidential candidates debate before they cast their ballots!   Trump campaign seeks early September presidential debate

Because of how polarized the nation is, and how the election will be decided by 3-5 swing states.  He has a good chance because 1) incumbency  2) people still trust him on the economy 3) plenty of voters out there that are still pretty moderate and will suck up voting for Trump

My worry is Trump will drop out before the election and someone else becomes the candidate.  The whole focus to get rid of Trump is gone and Biden will have to use something else than "I'm Not Trump".  The Republicans helping to remove Trump join the other side.
Unfortunately I’m not sure Trump is going to lose. Biden is not a strong candidate. His VP choice is important because many voters not affiliated with either party that vote either way may see that person as having a real chance to be President due to Biden’s age.

Understatement of the decade! We went from all Obama is to all Trump is - the most polar opposites possible. I wish a President could serve a third (and fourth) term after not being in office for one term.

Yeah. No.  I won't. I set there enduring chemotherapy and watched John McCain throw a thumbs down that saved the ACA. I've had cancer, heart surgery and have epilepsy. I was never eligible for affordable insurance until the ACA. To say Trump equals Biden is just wrong.
Trump didn't mention John Lewis because Lewis didn't attend Trump's inauguration.   Shocking: Trump is a petty piece of shit.
Get real Howie had about as much chance of winning as I do and I'm not on the ballot. You're punting your vote, which is about the same as not voting. A vote to not change is a vote to keep things the same. The same is Trump. Ergo you're voting for trump.

Agreed.  The only way he can survive a debate is to TRY to pour on lie after lie after lie in hopes that Joe isn't able to respond to lies.  The problem for Trump is that there will be very smart moderators who will sniff this from a mile a way and will live fact-check.

All of those things are still a better option than Trump for 4 more years
To paraphrase, a (kind of) man won’t understand something when he perceives it’s in his interest not to do so. Trump is incapable of any plan because he perceives even discussing same is admission of fault, therefore no plan. Mitch knows this. They all do. Garbage people.
I think it's funny how you came at me for making a joke to show that trump has NO RELATIONS WITH SAID CHILD NOR IS INVOLVED WITH HIS EDUCATION. Clearly you didnt get the point of the joke.

The rumor that Melania and Barron live with her parents 25 minutes from the White House, is a conspiracy theory. And regardless of where Barron lives...a Father should have more pictures with his son than with a sex trafficker/pedophile.
I am literally trying to have a conversation about this right now with somebody on here. All he has to offer is insults because he can't carry out a conversation. Tried explaining that this has been going on before Trump because he pulled that card🙄

🚨51% approval for President Trump  11 points better than he was at this point in 2016    7 points better than Obama was at this point in 2012
There were not huge discrepancies/irregularities - exit polls overstated Obama’s share of the vote by 7 points in the ‘08 primaries &amp; many exit polls showed Hillary beating Trump in areas he won). It’s not a random sample.
And here I thought the Democrats picked him because this should be a walk in the park. The Dems have made it plainly clear they are not interested in the votes of leftists, but rather the votes of Republicans who are going to vote for Trump, anyways.
I don’t think you realize that Republican voters are inherently stupid, and can easily be tricked into believing that it is democrats who have taken away their $600. Trump has already explicitly blamed house democrats for refusing to renew the $600. They have alternative facts.

It's disheartening because so many people seemingly disregard how utterly destructive another 4 years of trump would be. I'm not the least bit excited about Biden let's alone kopmala. I just don't think I can call myself an antifascist if I don't vote against the fascist.
Reason fucking 500 to vote Biden
Look I can't stand Biden, I hate that he's the candidate and voting for him is going to physically hurt me. But I'm still voting for him because a doddering geriatric neolib will do less harm than a doddering senile fascist
Biden/Harris camp's social game is finally getting 🔥
Leftist Twitter is really anti Biden and it's disheartening
Vote Biden to reduce the harm of another Trump presidency
Are you joking or do you actually think  simps for Biden. If you're not a Biden supporter this close to the election, are you just a trump supporter?
Nothing is guaranteed. This is 2020. Also, heads up, your Biden header graphic has a typo.
This sort of liberal logic is exactly why I would bet that the USPS funding would not be brought back to the pre-Trump levels should Biden and the Democrats sweep the elections.
All Joe Biden has to do is not tweet shit like this day in and day out and I will consider his presidency a success. Every other thing he will do for the American people will just be the cherry on top.      #VoteEarly2020
libs saying they would vote "biden/hitler" over trump 2020 are vile morons who wipe with their hands and suck the shit from under their own fingernails
Luckily for Biden, Trump is going the birther angle instead of actually attacking anything legitimate.
On behalf of  supporters everywhere, we'd like to thank the Democratic Party for giving us Biden/Harris 2020.  We understand you have to pretend you hate  but your gift of these two prove you really do want 4 More Years.  Thank you Dems! #Trump2020Landslide
After Joe Biden wins the presidency I would love to see and make Hillary the Attorney General watch her lock Trump up for the rest of his life
. and  trade barbs over coronavirus response, masks
Did you though? There are lots of centrist accounts that claim to be former Bernie supporters. If you were a honest then your argument would be “Biden is a monster but Trump is worse”. Telling people that they’re not progressive unless they vote for Biden is a centrist move.
All the drama around the Ron Johnson attempt to use his committee to smear Biden seems like a proxy struggle for the control and future direction of the GOP.
It’s sad that you feel the need to try and attack me as a person and what I have instead of talk about politics. You act like socialist is such a heated word. Socialism, capitalism— that’s ways a country can be run. I’m a liberal (or democrat if you prefer) since I support Biden
This image of Joe Biden finding two quarters on the street of Burlington VT in 2016 still makes me smile.
I would like every Biden supporter to know, my vote is available for purchase.
go joe go
I'll make it easy for you. I'm not a fan of Biden but we have to get rid of #AgolfTwitler   #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
If I wanna call Joe Biden stinky I can
Love to see a general election poll where Biden is up by 9 points, the margin of error is 3.5 points, and we have an electoral college.
Instead of restoring the soul of the nation, Biden should give us Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. #morningjoe

Yes, I might've voted for the 1970s Joe Biden if I'd been a Delaware resident. Busing turned out to be a disaster for Americans of all backgrounds. But I was living next door in Philly at that time!

Kamala called Gen Z stupid haha stfu we will hack your DNC headquarters and expose you all. Reminder that a 17 year old hacked Biden’s twitter, so FOH.
This shit scares me tbh.  Biden might not rock the boat like Trump but he sure as shit ain’t taking it to no safe port for the rest of us.  Biden is gonna ree-establish the same government that led to Trump; so there will def be another Trump later and he’s going to be x10 worse.

I don't know bout everyone else but DAMN clicking on a follower, scrolling through a few tweets, chckng WHEN they signed up, makes me feel paranoid but I haven't  had any real "we shld give Biden a chance because he's not Trump."  Yet.  Worth it.
Why did Biden name VP during Shark Week, you ask?  Kamala Harris is an anagram for Malaria  Shark!  Coincidence?  I don't think so...
Biden is the best crazy pervert dementia candidate the Democrats have who is dumb enough to go up against Donald Trump. And Kamala Harris would do anyone to be president. Obviously a Democrat dream team
Seriously  you’re a cool account, but have SOME standards. Most people see poll results and assume some level of credibility. It’s on you to uphold that. To post a 2024 Dem primary “poll” that doesn’t include Biden is unbelievable negligent ignorance.
My contribution to this election will be reminding Biden voters they should be phonebanking and texting instead of arguing with me.
Has not happened yet they are waiting for you to be removed from office November when you are voted OUT. Then renegotiate with the real adults, Biden and and associates
Stupid that's Biden's approval rating. The republicans are running for cover prior to the November elections they are trying to distance themselves from you making believe you don't exist
People who support democracy. You know, actually voting for people to become the Democratic nominee. Biden will be the incumbent president in 2024 choosing to not run for re-election. That requires a primary to choose a new nominee, and Harris being the VP has a good chance.
OMG. I thought you died years ago. Guess you just had Biden Brain
I think Klobuchar was on the ticket so Warren couldn't coalesce the female vote. It was such an obvious play by the centrist establishment. Then she bows out, along with Pete, right before Super Tues &amp; endorse Biden. If they drop out earlier, I think she wins.
like, Bernie primaried Clinton hard because she wasn’t progressive enough. She just wasn’t. Biden is *worse*. That’s why they got primaried— Kennedy just wants to be Senator Joe Kennedy so he can take advantage of this bs celebrity culture political moment and run for president.
Biden is wearing it just for the‘sniff in’
Trump in Trouble and Biden in Hiding: 2020 Presidential Elections  via
Not to take anything away from Biden/Harris 2020, but I'd absentee vote for a shit in a bucket on the 'Flat Earth Party ticket' over Trump/Pence.
these are all immaterial, subjective beliefs based on rhetorical gestures. materially, why would we believe joe biden will do anything except further enrich the wealthy at the cost to the poor? what difference does it make if our response to either outcome is the same?
Tulsi Gabbard had some fair questions for Kamala during a Democratic debate. Tulsi seemed genuine, honest, and willing to address the over reliance on the military in this country. Why didn't Dems like her? But I'll vote for Biden/Harris over Trump/anybody.
you can vote for whoever you want, i won't stop you, but I certainly don't owe them anything. unless someone can give me a clear material reason to vote for biden (not just vagueries about needing to get rid of trump), i will not be. i do plenty of other, more worthwhile activism
"Harris was one of the frontrunners from the very beginning, but Rice gained in the so-called veepstakes because reports were that Biden was looking for someone who could help him govern.”
This fool repeats everything he says, 3,4, 5 times in a row so his supporters hear his lies, so they believe them. I ain’t seen one of these ads! This fool has got to get gone!!!! #Biden/Harris2020
2- The fact that Biden is using a Republican for Hispanic/Latino outreach is a perfect example of how stupid they are, that is of course if you believe that they actually care about progressive values.  If you don't believe they care it then makes sense.
Can't get Biden/Harris to lose the election by sticking to the real issues this country has so you have to make up lies and b/s knowing the moron you support wants to get rid of health insurance, social security and medicare!
As Kamala Harris joins Biden ticket, Wall Street sighs in relief - The Wall Street Journal
Kamala spent the majority of the democratic debates blasting Biden on his racist voting record...
Gotta push back on this. You're missing the fundamental critique of leftish folks who won't vote biden, which is that Trump is NOT fundamentally unique as a president. The terror of this administration is not novel, and we believe 'business as usual' dems will only further...
imagine someone trying to explain this to Biden
Ugh I know people are trying to encourage other people to vote but I get nauseous AF when my feed is just biden 🤢🤢🤢🤢
Definitely location-dependent. I watch Jeopardy and Wheel every night and haven't seen a single Trump ad (or Biden ad, for that matter)  I also live in Vermont, which explains everything
White men are freaking out the Biden's VP pick doesn't look like them. To me, personally, I don't care what gender or race a candidate is. But I know it's important for this reason, which is why I supported Biden picking Harris or Abrams.
Has John Cornyn become a Biden supporter?
Not only that, you’re citing 1 NATIONAL poll to make a point against the Florida poll I initially retweeted. Like I get you dont like Biden, but learn how to use empirical evidence to make your points.
So, I guess logically, Biden Harris IS the most progressive ticket, given the stipulations above.
You know who leads blm. racist Corey booker and Kamala Harris. BLM donated over 50 mil to biden campaign. Oh look now Kamala is his vp
Yes but I’m still voting for lesser of two Evils ( Biden )
Alright I’ll be the one to say, this one sat alright with me. Didn’t sit great. Didn’t feel *good*. But it was just...fine. Sort of like Biden?
Hey Biden, you think maybe you can  take a cognitive test to reassure the people that you’re mentally fit to even run for President? Wait.... it’s you and your party’s plan to really just make sure you some how cheat the system to win and let Kamala be president and  destroy us.
Joe Biden wants to use your taxes to resettle economic migrants in red states and cement the demographic doom of this country.
Joe Biden wants to raise your taxes. Pass it on.
It just keeps getting more insane. Calls biden a racist and believes the accusations from women accusing him of assault. Who wants a leader like that? biden
. If I was Joe Biden, I’d sleep with one eye open, because she’s looking to take over the White House. 👀  #Hannity
Amazing thread. I too went to bed last night teary eyed with joy.... This morning? Was the first time in forever I woke up excited to turn on the news. I just wanted to see and hear Biden and Harris...and remember what HOPE feels like.
Biden should have put a coupon in the penny saver and offered free pens.
Biden has been trying to cut Social Security for decades. But you know that.
Trump, Biden, and Pete.
But I don’t believe Biden.
If republicans are so willing to vote for Biden that should say something!! It’s a trap and we are in for another shit show if he’s voted in.
We could have had Yang or Sanders. We are stuck with Joe Biden who I’m not convinced will beat Trump.

They own it now. Except who in the press will report it or ask Biden about it? If they ask Kamala she can always say “ It’s a Debate!”
Oh boy. Here we go. The loud mouth Biden needs to attack with because he’s too diminished to do it himself. Dems have no Workable ideas. You can’t win with hate and being against Trump. What do they offer besides platitudes? Nada #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever #Trump2020Landslide
It’s a valid argument to say that Trump is worse, but Biden will continue most of Trump’s policies at about 8 instead of 11 And the media just won’t talk about it. Progressives in Congress will have to fight no matter who wins.
President Trump is a MOOD.  "I saw just a moment of [Biden] speaking, a moment of [Harris] speaking and it was enough."
How challenging to Wall Street do you suppose Biden Harris is going to be? C'mon man, gimme a break.
Sure, that is your opinion. Mine differs. All cows are not black, but these two very much are. We only went backwards under Obama, and you think it will be better under Biden? We're out of time. We desperately needed progress, and our leaders just keep getting worse.
Let’s hope so. She’s for UBI. I like Kamala more than I like Biden.
Perhaps you convince Biden.

y’all can vote for the Biden/Harris ticket in November and still hold them accountable for the harm and trauma they’ve caused BIPOC   like the two aren’t mutually exclusive, hold your elected representatives to higher standards, please  ALL OF THEM
It's understandable that this Biden/Harris event is over 30 minutes late because Biden has tons of events and is doing loads of interviews that backed him up - oh wait....
This Biden/Harris event is probably running so late because Biden keeps forgetting the name of who his handler's chose to be his VP. #BarelyThereBiden
The former primary rivals will appear at a high school in Biden’s Delaware hometown to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat Trump and then lead the country through a pandemic, its economic fallout and a long-simmering reckoning with racism.
Yes but I'll still vote for Biden because  is an actual fucking fascist. #antifa #AntiFascist
Agreed, there is no debate. Time to vote. Biden lowers himself to be on the stage with Trump.
"sHeS NoT mY FiRSt cHOicE fOr VP eiTHeR, bUt...."  Just be quiet and let me be mad about this. I know I gotta vote for Biden/Harris, but I don't have to like it.
The takeover of Joe Biden by the extreme left is complete. Together Biden &amp; Harris want to:   ❌Raise taxes on families &amp; businesses  ❌Ban fracking &amp; kill countless jobs  ❌Increase household energy costs w/ a carbon tax  ❌Ban plastic straws
Oh shit. Biden's lead in the polls just dropped from 9% to 9%.
Sounds like Tucker Carlson is supporting Biden like the rest of the majority of the country.
Over half of likely voters don’t believe Joe Biden will finish first term

The prospect of the Kamala decade is extremely scary but it’s also freeing knowing I will most definitely not be voting for joe Biden
If you're rich enough to really care about whether Biden wins or not, you're rich enough to pay me. Would be way more convincing than a tome of lame tweets. Save some time for all that phonebanking and texting you need to be doing.
Now I can only wonder what other types of fuck bots there are out there. Lemme see, fuck Biden, fuck politicians, fuck shadow government, fuck US Intelligence, fuck sheep, fuck you, fuck your mom, fuck the mad ancient scientist pretending to be a god who engineered white people
yeah people need to be radicalized right now and expending any time and resources for biden is a waste  if he loses it won't be because of a lack of effort on our part

Lol! Good one.  "It wasn't Obama's or Biden's fault" Got it. It's not like they were in charge of a country or anything.  Convincing stuff right here.
Clinton County Democratic Party Chair Jerry Marking was pleased with Tuesday's news that former Vice President Joe Biden had tapped U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
I feel like the biden campaign is entirely built on looking at what the people actually want and then hand-wringing and saying "what about the right? we gotta appeal to the centre more"
No, it does include inferring based on past actions.  What did Biden do as VP for 8 years?
Biden will also continue accelerating the crisis. He has no plans to actually follow through on his promise.
So that fits perfectly then. right? Cuz that's the same percentage change we will get with Biden.
It's the same script whether it's Bernie or a centrist like Kamala or Biden or Obama. Socialist communist marxist stalinist fascist radical. Words have no meaning.
Seems like Ben is jumping over attacking Biden, when he himself acknowledges 60% don’t have faith in Biden.   That’s not a leader
Biden and Harris are garbage. But still gotta vote for them as they are the lesser of two evils at this point. Maybe some day this country can get people who actually care into power. People like AOC
President Biden,  Please double back on Russia.  Stop their advances north to the Arctic.  Sanction them until Putin is overthrown.  They are more of a threat to world peace than anyone, and they're not smart.
I said this yesterday. Allowing Trump on a stage with Biden only elevates Trump. Trump has nothing to offer on policy that is fact driven. He will lie and fear monger. That’s all he is capable of doing. He has no 2nd term agenda goals to explain.  Seriously- Why bother?
So you think Donald Trump is “closer to Christ” than Joe Biden?
Kamala is the running mate of a doomed presidential candidate. She won't ever be Vice President of anything. Choosing her is the coffin nail for Biden.
man fuck kamala harris and fuck joe biden and fuck the two party system
Be careful, you need to be very specific with Jay. Ask him who he prefers between Trump or Biden or he'll just answer "Mitch Daniels".
I wasn’t really a Tulsi person, but I noticed that she stopped being a Russian asset within seconds of endorsing Biden.
Nothing wrong with trying to stay safe in the middle of a Pandemic. When it comes to the issues, Biden is much more qualified as a President than Trump will ever be.
The Bishop knows Biden is Catholic. Just like Tucker knows how to pronounce Kamala.   It's almost like they're generating completely erroneous statements that prey upon a certain zeitgeist to influence undecided voters.  In other words, fake news. Election meddling.
We know who you align with and you embarrass me, as a Catholic  Catholic Church received at least $1.4 billion in COVID-19 relief aid  Biden is Catholic and you should getchu self together
Picking a VP who could not beat Biden, dropping out early with dismal results, and with more baggage than Ru Paul on an overnight trip to Pasadena, has to be one the stupidest strategic picks in history...at least Rice had some rep of being an individual.  #wednesdaymorning

now my biggest hang up is whether to vote or not. it's not like I think Biden/Harris has a huge likelihood to win, but if Trump wins for another 4 years, is that more likely to radicalize people, who will take steps in their lives to dismantle capitalism and electoralism? idk.
One top aid &amp; several senior Trump advisors = Trumpworld? I was hoping you’d have a record of a few actual names quoted. Mostly you quote mind readers working for Axios or the Biden campaign. Should I be surprised?
You're kidding me right. His handlers made that pick. Biden can't pick out his socks in the morning.

No, I thought he was a center left moderate. That would have been a nice change from right wing lunatics like Harris and Biden.
Great pic Joe Biden, you just picked a failed presidential candidate who failed early in the primaries. Who labeled you a racist and sex offender. How does that work

Don’t hold your breath if Biden/Harris get elected. Simply the better choice between two bad choices. We need progressives.
Biden boxed himself in by saying he would only pick a woman. You should keep your options open when picking a VP. Biden got too caught up in trying to be "progressive".
If Kamala were to become president after Biden dies or retires for health reasons Kamala then has the power to appoint someone to the office of vice president subject to approval by congress.
You don't have 2 vote for Biden :)
I was so close to voting Biden.... so close!! I wonder how many people he will lose for this.
Yeaaaaaa... Biden was suppose to win my vote not lose it...
i was lost at biden😐
Biden really wanted to sniff Whitmer. Handlers said no. 💅
As much as I dislike the ticket for  I will be voting for Biden. My grandfather watches nothing but Fox News and they have convinced me to vote Biden and Kamala. It is with disappointment, but I will do it.
If Biden is a rapist what is trump to you?
Voting for Biden is going to cause me physical pain.
Sure, it’s Joe Biden and not you who’s racist.
I’d rather still vote Biden and Harris over trump
Most likely the shit they pedal about Biden the left say about Trump.... I just informed that u was incorrect and the pic was old..

Biden chose Harris, and you know the second trump learned about it he hid in the bunker.
Biden respects the health &amp; safety of his supporters. Unlike tRump who insisted on holding his unmasked super-spreader rally in Tulsa &amp; ended up killing Herman Cain &amp; still refuses to act responsibly &amp; respect the health of others everywhere he goes.

Biden can't be trusted near a mic either. But DNC is trash so what can we expect?
Remember when Kamala Harris basically called Biden a racist in the first debate lmao
Remember a sane Joe Biden, would never pick the Joker to be his number 2. Kamala is as ambitious as Hillary but homicidal and not a suiciding bitch

Low key, but kinda high key, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the democratic ticket for Prez is the opposite of a dream come true
Ultimately we are living In Bernie’s revolution. That is what matters.  Biden is the laziest candidate in history and Kamala well....not a favorite of social justice advocates when you look at her record. This is a ticket of the past. Moderate Demrocrat porn for times gone by

how biden choosing kamala harris as his vp in this climate is beyond tone deaf. acab.

Would have given me one more reason not to support Tulsi rather than a reason to support Biden TBH.  Would rather Tulsi distance herself from the DNC and be the bastion of the center that we need.
there is truly no such thing as the perfect candidate &amp; there NEVER HAS BEEN. bernie fully supported the nra. pres. obama worsened the middle east crisis and thousands of innocent civilians died bc of it. clinton. i would love if biden/harris wasn’t our best option but they are
PHUCK YEAH!!!  BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!!!
Make no mistake—Biden and Harris represent the lesser of two horrible options. The people have no power. The election became rigged so that Bernie couldn’t win it. Sanders and Yang were the only 2 candidates who truly care.
"If elected, this weak Democratic duo will aid and abet the radical socialists and anarchists at every turn.   Americans must reject Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and their dangerous ideology."
While the country protests for justice reform, Biden selects someone with the mindset of someone they're protesting against. Awesome
Kamala Harris believes Joe Biden's accusers.   "I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it..."
Whenever you’re feeling beaten down, just remember that Joe Biden had to pick the woman who smeared him as a segregationist on live television to be his running mate.

Here’s my one tweet today about this. I rather see Kamala debate Trump than Biden. Wonder if they can switch bodies. Of course I rather  be running for president.  #BidenHarris2020
That would require Biden to actually win but from where I'm sitting a second term of Orange Man seems pretty likely.
Sweet.  Can't wait for Biden's executive order seizing all of Trump's assets.
I like Joe's pick.  The cloud I feel when I Think Trump is now clearing even more.  Biden/Harris 2020 ftw.  Harris/? 2024.  That's my prediction.  This is the beginning of the country healing.  Get out and vote on 11/3 like your life depends on it!!!

To be fair Biden never actually said “defund the police” because he was afraid of alienating his moderate base  🥴
Apparently, this is a week of nonstop naivety for me because I thought there was no way Biden would pick a cop with a track record of ignoring corruption in her jurisdiction as his running mate but here we are.

Biden wasn't my first choice, but the 🤡 in the WH has to go.

“we’re good if biden wins”  Cringe
I'm sure I'll regret these words, but the way things are going with covid and the economy, Biden could pick Saddam Fidel Hitler as his running mate and still probably win. All he has to do is sit back and let Trump keep killing himself.
Biden narrowed his choices when he said he would pick a woman. But Kamala? I don't see her as a way to "reach out." Judging from how she behaved as CA's AG and a senator, she's the Left's chaperone for Biden.
Biden really chose Kamala the cop as his VP 🙃
Thank you!!!! Biden Harris 2020

Yang would have been the better choice for VP than whoever Biden selects. Would have set Yang up for a 2024 run. I see Biden as a one term and done President if he wins.
Would rather see Biden choose Andrew Yang.
Polling from different states showed he was close to Warren in many places and ranked higher than some of the other candidates. In Iowa he was 2nd to Bernie in non-white support during the caucus (of course Biden did significantly better in SC and overall than any of them).

These sound like great investments in our country.  I can’t wait to vote for Joe Biden!

Patience is a virtue and so is giving due consideration to the selection of a VP running mate.    It is refreshing to see a leader exhibit both qualities. Biden is well within the normal timeframe for making his announcement.    I welcome proper deliberation.
The reason leftists can't figure out who Biden's picking as VP is much the same as why Biden can't; they both can't decide which prominent Democrat leftists hate the most.
