I live in an all mail in state,but haven't always. I'd stand, sit, sleep, eat, pee, and poop in a coffee can, for days if I had to, to vote for Biden.
Looking good I love it!üëê
45 is an idiot!  Anyone who knows how to think critically &amp; contextualize Biden's comments yesterday would NEVER believe he lost the black vote. Clearly, the son of a klansman 45, doesn't get it. üôÑüåä #blackvote

Joe Biden didn‚Äôt get that memo.
He's right for once. Nobody can crash an economy like he has or kill 160,000 Americans while doing it.  Biden should be so lucky.
Lol. He is currently tweeting about Biden upsetting him. He is five seconds from full on MAGA but with expensive wine and cheese
Biden. A known, practicing, religious man...   What an ugly attack by a man who knows nothing of faith.
Why is it that everytime #JoeBiden makes a gaffe it‚Äôs about Black people? No the Black experience is not monolithic.  Not all Black people are U.S. born either and our attitudes on social issues differ based on class, religion and other social identities.  #Biden
Senate flips Blue, Shadid replaces Pelosi, progressives sweep the house, Howie surges after Biden is fully exposed as a rapist after his senate files come out, and Trump's approval rating plummets even more due to Epstein, Covid, Poverty, and BLM.
If Trump could be forced to face Biden Trump would implode. Did you see him with Hillary ?
I don't know whether to be glad you and your dad are so obtuse, or exasperated because you clearly can't learn.  Nothing will be back to anything like normal until the virus is smacked down.  Your daddy is incapable of making that happen. Joe Biden will.  #JoeBiden
Yes, YouTube is a source. Except when it exposes the racism of Joe Biden and the DNC, right?

I wouldn't worry. The media is lying--like always. Biden's got more than a comfortable lead. They just don't want to make it look like Trump is losing badly. (It's bad for business.)
Biden will not name VP until he has enough sniff.
You'd be surprised by how many people would not realize that. Better to point it out than have a bunch of posts from people being like "OMG CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT BIDEN WAS ACTUALLY WEARING A MAGA HAT?!"
Biden is living proof that democrats have an empty bench. All their candidates blow.

Biden has already proved his capabilities far exceed the moron in the white house.

Biden would at least keep the police restrained, while Trump would outright unshackle them and turn them loose on us.  I'm taking the attitude that due to the two-party system, Biden's our best choice, and we can choose to fuck over Corporate Democrats in the next 4 years 1/2

Trump only needs one item on his list: indictments of the Obama/Biden administration.
The FACT that Trump is showing signs of utter desperation makes perfect sense that he'd USE ANYONE in order to defeat Joe Biden.. West has a mental disorder which he REFUSES to control with prescribed medications. Therefore, like Trump, West is mentally unfit for the presidency.
Several things. Indictments of the Obama/Biden administration. Biden‚Äôs obvious dementia. Democrats connection with Antifa. Trump voter enthusiasm. Rebounding economy and the great economy before Covid.

Shall we look at the evidence? The lowest unemployment rate for all minorities in our history. The criminal reform bill. Economic zones. Largest investment in black colleges. This is all from Trump, not Obama/Biden.
Joe Biden will never get elected.

Bogus accusations. He‚Äôs done more to support minorities than Obama/Biden could ever dream of doing. Because, Obama/Biden did nothing.

These people are McCain and Bush staffers, both of whom were horrible monsters. However, it is personally advantageous for them to have that type of monster in power instead of our current one, and Biden is the best fit for their ideology.
Careful with these Lincoln Project guys. They are conservative operators who expect to be granted entry into the Biden sphere of influence. This pushes what we call "the left" even further right than it already is.

*Sidenote: Obviously, I see another example in his "tear-gas gospel" display of the Bible at during the protests in DC. This was bad, as it put a "Christian" on stage while black people and their allies were gassed.  Biden comments are a more explicit, if more mundane invocation.
Lastly and most obviously, God is being invoked in a really awful context. This misrepresents Biden's character, comes from a morally unChristian man, and is being done for political gain*. It's icky, and a really shameful, blasphemous way to invoke the name of God.
Trump says Biden wants to "Take away your guns, destroy your second amendment, no religion, no anything. Hurt the bible, hurt God. He's against God, he's against guns."   Here's why this is a massive theological problem:
Seriously though. Why do we need these debates? Typically it‚Äôs because we need to hear policy differences. But Trump has shown us his and they are self-serving, lawless and terrible for the country. Anything Biden does will be better.  I don‚Äôt need no stinking debates.

In our April 2020 survey, Donald Trump held a 21-point lead over Joe Biden in Kentucky. But in our latest July 2020 survey, the strength of that lead has seemingly evaporated to a single digit 7-point lead in the state. At this rate, Biden takes Kentucky by 7% on November 3rd.
Fair enough, though I'd point most of the blame at the media for their ridiculous efforts to legitimize those fuckers than at Biden for doing politics in a way that evidence suggests will get him elected.
So AOC chaired and Bernie Sanders sat in on the writing of Biden's policy platform.  I think he's less worried about moderate Republicans than he is about progressives.  Separate the pandering bullshit from the concrete stuff he'll have to answer for later, like his platform

Cut into little pieces and use as confetti to celebrate when Biden wins.
Com'on, people we have seen it happen again &amp; again, if the government gets to low you won't be able to get your money out!!! Did you forget 2008???? Trump is the one sucking money from every crevice he can think of that the people have except for corporations!!! NOT BIDEN
Like you feel the humiliation of your being fired after 11 days? NO WAY YOU VOTE FOR BIDEN!
I absolutely agree! I‚Äôm an independent and I have long railed against the two party system. Biden wouldn‚Äôt have been my choice, but there isn‚Äôt a strong enough 3rd party candidate in this election for me and I truly don‚Äôt think we can survive another 4 yrs.
Biden is eating into Trump's Rust Belt base.  has clear leads in an average of the last three CNN approved polls in the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
You made it about Trump.   Biden is in a sad state. I‚Äôm sure Trump will hit that hard as he should.
That‚Äôs 512000 more than Biden‚Äôs last campaign interview. Elon 2020
I think you can absolutely criticize Joe Biden. I agree the 2 party system has got to go the DNC should be held accountable. I‚Äôm and independent but not this election. If Trump wins again, this will all be moot.
Our country's heart is broken, we cannot, cannot let him be reelected! I know he is going to do every evil thing he and Barr can think of - but we have to stay strong and VOTE in Biden and vote out the GOP enablers.
you have zero credibility, nobody believes you with the exception of the lowest, most ignorant 38% of the population and they're dwindling, too! VOTE BIDEN!
More Lies from the Orange one!  You have ruined our economy, you have been the cause of 150,000 deaths because of your INACTION, What IS NONSENSE are the UNtruths you are spewing!  VOTE BLUE/BIDEN
Just full on government control. Let's get some curfews and make people get licenses for people to leave their home on government approved reasons. We can seize control of the grocery stores so we can ration out food as the government sees fit, and as a bonus, pray to Biden.
Here is your bait moron now that the Dems have come out so strong against any election delay, they will be totally f*cked when  blows up in the first debate and they want to delay for a new candidate!
Where was  yesterday? He's trying to get the Biden information from Ukraine, to Trump without an official Whitehouse visit.   #WhereWasDevinNunes
I am voting for Biden. Period, only death will keep me from voting. Period. Done.
üíôüíôüíô I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden!
Biden can easily beat Trump by a margin of 5-10x the total numbers of votes Hawkins gets. I'd vote Hawkins if it wasn't gross civic irresponsibility to do so.
Biden has edge in North Carolina, race is tight in Georgia - CBS poll
Postpone the #Election? That Could Mean #President #Biden #leadership #ethics #recovery
Ummm, I still have Obama's picture on my fridge along with Pelosi and Biden.
You keep telling yourself that while we enthusiastically vote for VP Biden and every other Democrat on our ballots. We believe in the future of our country even if the GOP doesn't and wants us to be like Russia, China or North Korea.
This is ad is awesome! It makes it look like Biden is actually out talking to people and not hiding in his basement!
We as biden supporters are frustrated because trump is trying to suppress our voices and strip us of our voting rights. Because he has allowed this pandemic to take hold of our country due to lack of duties to PROTECT the American population. We're frustrated at stupidity!
When Biden becomes president,  he better have a whole lot of new Bill's put in place so that this never happens again. Cause even now know one is stopping trump awful behavior and his cronies just praise him for it. We all better strap in cause its gonna be bad.
I don‚Äôt now who I‚Äôm more scred to have at the White House trump or Biden , neither can really speak to the associated press !
If I could see abumper sticker, it would say, "Biden is busted." It weuld show a balloon that has no air.
A debatable claim.  But Donald Trump is objectively a #RoyCohn liar, petty vindictive bully, Dunning-Kruger bragging huckster, and the most profoundly ignorant person ever to be President.  Biden exhibits none of those features.
Not me. I choose Biden, debates no debates and no matter who he selects as his VP. I'm voting for Biden no matter what.
Absolutely.  Trump is unqualified for the office, and a danger to the Republic.  Biden is neither of those things.  No problem at all making this choice.
My money is on Romney endorsing Biden to try to flip Utah
Nothing to talk about? They'll bloody thrive, talking against Biden as they did Obama for his whole tenure. They're a negative force.
Though it's quite possible Biden won't be running that year.
That is my point--this is TERRIBLE politics. And it hands Biden a campaign ad: "Remember when your mail came on time? Vote for me and I will restore the Post Office..."
Shirley Chisholm blazed the way for every Black woman Biden is considering for VP
Listening to more Black people has helped open my eyes to this. Many of them seem repulsed by Biden too. They make a good point that the problems are so much deeper than Trump and that he's more of a symptom of the problem.
Vote üíô for Joe Biden!
I think it's a false choice you're presenting, but you knew that. Biden may listen to those people because he respects their counsel and wants to give them their due and STILL prefer Harris and have his mind 95% sure of her.
I don't actually see any evidence that Biden himself lacks confidence. Just a vocal minority of *other* people who don't like her and would like a different choice. I don't even particularly care if he picks her (I like Duckworth for the story she brings), but think she's likely.
Obama is a COMMIE, Biden is A Commie, Warren Is A Commie, Bernie Sanders is King of all them commies, I think I made my point that I hate Democrats, I abhore liberals, in fact if it were legal I'd EAT THEM FOR FUN üòÇ

whole thread is fantastic to paraphrase the Biden disinfo is a nothing burger
She isn‚Äôt thinking that way. Whoever he picks, if by some miracle he wins, his VP pick within a year or less will become the President once Biden is determined incompetent
I will vote for Biden no matter what happens. Period end of story. Done.  #YesWeCanAgain
Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate

I hope this convinces all the Zillenials to force their parents to vote for Biden
i dont think anything will actually happen but if he bans tiktok hes gonna be creating a huge contingent of young people who hate him and suddenly have a lot of free time. biden could mobilize the hell out of some teens by promising to reverse a ban on day one lol
I've been firm never trump since before he came down the escalator.  Still am. But I'll pay attention to see if Biden jumps on board with this BS. I've already let so much of it go. "Centrists"will justify any fucking thing to beat DT.  Not me.  #factsstillmatter
I consider myself a libertarian but I‚Äôm voting for Trump. Not that it matters, WA state‚Äôs electoral votes will go to Biden.
Simple. Biden wins, Biden steps down (dead brain cells) and the VP takes the reigns.
Obama and Biden didn't prosecute pedophile D'rat doners.
Yes, exactly, and HOW is it productive? If we aren't in the know, we don't know and if we think we can incite twitter outrage and force a nom. on Biden we're pretty arrogant as well as destructive
ü§ó Yay‚ÄºÔ∏è I want Biden! I haven‚Äôt given much thought to VP!
I'm glad you're campaigning for VP Biden. That loser in the White house has cost this country millions and millions of jobs, killed over 150,000 people and has destroyed our reputation around the world. Biden helped President Obama create millions of jobs.
Harris allies granted call with Biden campaign after Dodd blowup.      My street sense say's don't trust her.
I know Trump can have anonymous source's from the Intelligence Community leak to all the Conservative News outlets, that they have evidence of the Dems including Biden colluding with China to release this Virus to effect the election negativly against Trump!  Sounds familiar?
Ha, a daisy ad for president Johnson is so applicable today for Biden against trump ( HA, history, boy are we repeating it)( 64' Johnson v Goldwater,  on PBS )
Opinion | If Biden wants to govern well, Karen Bass is the right pick
Take the  test for yourself.  My first choice still came out the same. #Biden2020
Biden can quote poetry from memory.  Not only has Trump not read any to quote, when pressed on the Bible which he supposedly believed, he couldn't specify even a single bit of Scripture that inspired him.  Continue to worship your Golden-Plated Calf, Aaron (oh, sorry, Bob).
Biden said he'd leave it up to the states. Weed has been legal here in Washington for 5 years, he won't fuck with that.
I hadn't heard of Karen Bass until this point.
Trust me, no matter which woman Biden picks, she will rub some people the wrong way. Powerful women tend to do that.
You've got to realize that Biden is better than Trump. You're not stupid, by any means.
Duckworth cause of experience.  But I really like Lance Bottoms in the future and Demmings is interesting.  Dont know enuf about either.  Biden will still win but Kamala will be a slight drag on the ticket
Everyone is in cahoots with MIC. They make something in every district in the USA. War drives our economy. Will Biden beat our swords into plowshares? No. But he'll save Social Security and Medicare from the greedy fucking bastards who want to privatize it. Change comes slowly.

While I will vote for Biden, I found that "volunteer" means "send money". I volunteered twice and all I ever heard was "donate money". So I ordered Biden signs for the neighborhood, distributed them, and am calling it good! See you in November when we get rid of the Trumpster.
Biden committee members overwhelmingly vote to continue corporate bribery in the DNC.
Uh no. Most of us suburban moms want our kids alive.  Biden 2020.
May be a little off topic, but Biden-Harris probably don't like Medicaid that much, either
As for the intersection of Trump‚Äôs racism and his disastrous incompetence, the ‚Äúanti-Asian sentiment‚Äù Trump has been working to stir up with his racist references to the ‚Äúkung flu,‚Äù President Obama said in one such event, ‚Äústill shocks and pisses me off.‚Äù
There you go again, all #RoyCohn lying again.  You realize we have Biden's own statements to consult on this ...
True.  But if the Chief Justice swore in Biden, that would settle that.  Unless Trump went for Judge Judy?
Of course if the Florida electors are insufficient to rescue Trump anyway, Chief Justice Roberts could swear in Biden.  Either way, the current President ceases to be POTUS on Jan 21, &amp; only Roberts can swear in the successor.  Grassley Sen Pro Temp would be in line then.
Thank you Joe Biden! When you become president we hope you‚Äôll be attending to more important things than tweeting. #JoeBidenForPresident2020
Did they purposefully slow down Biden's voice??  It doesn't sound like him.
Joe Biden is a hardliner right wing corporatist. Sound like someone else we know?

Fine with me, as long as Joe Biden wins!
Biden ... boogie! boogie! boogie!  But several things Biden is not: a pathological #RoyCohn liar, a petty vindictive bully, a scientific ignoramus who can't tell pseudoscience from a fart (the "stupendous" Dr. Stella).  Our Plague President is all of those things.
I technically want Biden to win... but don't know if I could vote in good faith in him.
Arianna, thanks for your spirit and commnity action. Can‚Äôt wait for the humanity of Biden‚Äôs presidency!
I'm guessing that someone found out that trying to delay the election did not poll very well.    Vote for Joe Biden on November 3rd.
Joe Biden will never be #mypresident. Pass it on.
Hillary wasn‚Äôt afraid of Trump in the slightest. Also, how do you know Biden is smarter? That sounds like opinion to me.
Stay mad and vote for Biden! That's what I'm gonna do. I still think you pissing on his memory is in bad taste, but I doubt I'll convince you of that.
I miss him so much.  Can he be Biden‚Äôs VP?
Joe Biden Accidentally Calls for Jihad against America  via
What are the chances that Joe Biden will ignore the death of Herman Cain and refuse to say anything to offer solace and sympathy to Cain's family? Hint: ZERO chance of that.   Some people know how a POTUS or POTUS wannabe, and a simple, decent human being should behave!
Biden reaches out to Herman Cains family before Trump?
If its going to be so fraudulent wouldnt you be able to just outspent Biden and win?
"Fuck the Poor."   -The Biden Administration
If that‚Äôs really true, then you should be able to see my position. If Biden can keep his mouth shut until Election Day, he‚Äôs got it in the bag. If they have a chance to have a televised debate, Trump is absolutely winning.
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
What are you talking about? Lol. Trump was bragging about how well he did on his test. Biden has a lot of scandals, and Trump will tear him apart. The Ukraine scandal originally started off with Biden‚Äôs son (not Trump like the media was trying to push)
Trump won due to his snappy responses against Hillary, which is something Biden won‚Äôt be able to handle. Also, people believe that Biden has dementia of some sort. In a televised debate, Biden loses easily.
can we play her ripping up biden over his pro segregationist polices as soon as he announces her as vp?  haha
Thank you!  This whole discussion is beneath us right now, we need every one to concentrate on Joe Biden winning and bringing back normalcy to our poor, battered country.
I can hardly wait until Biden is president and we have a woman VP, and many women in his Cabinet and other high jobs.  My blood doesn't boil when I read the email, I just thought it was yet another stupid Trumper.
Watch. Biden will open his mouth, and then suddenly he will lose the election. He can‚Äôt form coherent points together, or even get through sentences. Not only that, he‚Äôs an asshole to his following.
Unpopular opinion: pretty telling how fast Bernie supported Biden after the 2020 primary but took forever in 2016 with Hillary (a woman). Also pretty interesting how fundraisers for Biden with Warren have had the biggest return and dollars raised

I just hope this NRA lawsuit doesn‚Äôt get misconstrued as Biden or the Dems going after our second amendment rights. People aren‚Äôt smart...so I‚Äôm hoping this doesn‚Äôt hurt
Maybe Donald is throwing in the towel? Should Biden just take it from here? Is that a hidden message you‚Äôve given?
Damn, what happened to those videos when Jesse Jackson praised Trump for helping Black communities. Trump also said that ‚Äúneo-Nazis and white supremacists ... should be condemned totally.‚Äù Alveda King: "Trump has done more for African Americans than Biden."

do you even undesrtand how the cosntitution works?   biden cannot do anything to the 2nd amendment without all branches of government approving it.   read more please.  educate yourself.
I want Harris, but if Biden chooses someone else, I will still support him. I can‚Äôt allow another 4 years of Trump because I know the horrible impact he‚Äôs had on the people I love &amp; care about in my community. I would not do that to them or to myself. It‚Äôs bigger than a VP pick.
He did say ‚ÄúIf you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black‚Äù. He was a sassy comment on a radio show and later apologized.

Like I said...I like her and if he chooses her than I‚Äôm A okay with that. I‚Äôm certainly not going to get mad and threaten to not vote for Biden.
Yes! A lot of the people in the ‚Äúrunning‚Äù would make fantastic members of Biden‚Äôs cabinet! I‚Äôm good with whom ever he chooses! I trust him and his advisors.
Calling someone who has only been in government for 3 years and yet you defend politicians like Biden who have been in power for fifty years plus. And blaming trump for problems they couldn‚Äôt solve in that time. What a double standard.
I wish Trumps Axios interview was doctored but sadly that really is our president. Having to doctor Biden‚Äôs means they‚Äôre trying to make trumps real cognitive issues look mild, so sad
Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
His people would be crazy to put a sundowning man with no filter on his mouth and a obstinate refusal to stick to prearranged talking points on a debate stage with an experienced debater like Biden. They know he‚Äôd be slaughtered.
Biden grew testy when CBS News correspondent Errol Barnett asked the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee about the matter in a recent interview. "No, I haven't taken a test? Why the hell would I take a test?" Biden said.
Guess who Bernie Sanders is going to vote for in November?  His good friend Joe Biden.
I don‚Äôt care who Biden picks. Everyone that‚Äôs been on his short list would be amazing. He could pick Barney the Dinosaur and I‚Äôm still voting for him.
Please remember, when you vote for our future president Joe Biden, also vote to flip the Senate too.  Otherwise, we will continue to have Mitch McConnell sabotage all the wonderful things Joe Biden wants to do to heal and repair the damage Trump has done to the US!!

Like I said, I think Abrams has the charisma to drive voter turnout well over 60%.  However, I'll bet that Biden taps Kamala Harris. But I could be wrong. Especially since he just added two weeks to the vetting process.  Joe is showing that he won't waste his shots as Prez.

Are you serious? Name one  thing  Biden has accomplished. He didn't do shit when he was younger,  what makes you think he'll do shit now. What a joke.
Biden can't debate Trump ... a teleprompter is not allowed nor is phone a friend‚ÄºÔ∏è
Please stop pretending JoeBiden is anything but a corporate tool pushed by the corrupt DNC. He‚Äôs better then Trump just leave it at that. It‚Äôs complete bullshit that we have that as our choice, the platform committee has shown who Biden is going to work for, it‚Äôs not the ppl.
Let me repeat this as well before he croaks. Clyburn is also an epic big pharma tool who served them well when he endorsed lobbyist loving Biden for the benefit of his donors, and to the detriment of working class Americans. Don‚Äôt ever forget

trump is now spewing that Joe Biden is going to send the "inner city" to the suburbs, bringing crime and lowering property values.  He's citing the current unrelated protests as an example. Feds and all!  Where has he been Republicans? He's your "stable genius"!  (Continued) 3of4
The idea you can essentially ‚Äúsit out‚Äù and not actually have your life altered is privilege at its finest. A vote for Biden is a vote against fascism and the dismantling of our democratic republic.
Biden has said NUMEROUS things that if Trump had said them would be labeled as a racist. In addition to that Biden TRIED TO PREVENT THE COURTS From allowing desegregating schools.
20 years of fame and the spotlight and only became racist once he ran for president as a republican (he was a democrat most his life). I promise you if he would have ran as a democrat there would be zero accusations of racism. Just look at Biden.
Kind of agree with this. But who knows maybe it‚Äôs time. 2/3 of Biden‚Äôs voters are voting against Trump, not voting because it‚Äôs Biden. Not that that inspires much but that‚Äôs the only option we got after the dnc forced it on us.
You wanna talk about dementia?? Joe Biden forgot where he was and is always forgetting what he‚Äôs saying in the same sentence... a Biden presidency is a doom for America. Trump ain‚Äôt my first pick but I‚Äôll take him over Sleepy Joe
Personally, I'd rather see Stacey Abrams (followed by an Abrams-AOC ticket in 2024) but I also see how Biden-Harris would work for many in 2020. They would get my vote  I like how  has been embracing more progressive values as a senator than she did as an AG.
Trump is intent on becoming dictator-for-life *because* he sees it as the only way to get into the same wealth stratum with Putin and Mogilevich.  He must be stopped,

I'm voting for Biden but there are significant policy differences between centrist D's and progressives. Centrists are the true conservatives trying maintain status quo.  Biden, Pelosi and Schumer seem entrenched in 1990s political rules. We need new ideas.
Yep, and he was taken to task for it.
Ammon Bundy doesn't believe in law enforcement at all. I know of not one liberal or person left of Joe Biden who does not believe in the police force. The way it's funded and how those funds are used is totally different than believing in no police.

Biden's Catholic... also, when was the last time you saw Trump in a church praying?
"Hurt God"?? Wow, I had no idea Biden was so freaking powerful!
Would love to hear who you think is the best person as AG to start these needed prosecutions as well as begin rooting out the rotten culture at DHS, CBP, ICE etc that fall under the AG‚Äôs authority. AG is going to be one of Biden‚Äôs most important choices assuming he gets that far.
I disagree with Biden that prosecuting Trump would be bad for democracy, in fact quite the opposite. We have sent the message that if you are in government you will be immune from the law. This is a very dangerous precedent we have and it needs to be reversed.
Biden didn't compromise this absolutely vital piece of rule of law.
If this were a normal election cycle Biden never would've made it to Iowa, what a fucking farce
You have had the last 4 yrs to show us just how horribly unqualified, unhinged, and undeserving you are of the presidency. Biden had 8 yrs as VP to show us he could handle the job with dignity, diplomacy, and intelligence. #TrumpOut2020

Yep. If Biden comes full circle too and meets the tenets of a HF endorsement then I won't be halfass voting for him.  I'll knock doors for him like I did for Yang. If Marylin Strickland were in my district I would have knocked doors for her too. Water what you want to see grow.üß¢

Oh-Oh, some1 went off script from ‚Äúapproved questions‚Äù. #ComatoseJoe DID NOT KNOW HOW TO REACT. Joe‚Äôs fallback is to say, ‚ÄúCome on, man‚Äù. The NIGHTMARE (or comedy routine) would B Joe saying, ‚ÄúCome on, man‚Äù, EVERY TIME HE IS ASKED TO COMMENT on anything.
And who gets to decide what the lies and truth are?  And who fact checks the fact checkers?  If I run an ad talking about Biden‚Äôs corruption in Ukraine, it will be seen as a lie by any major outlet.

Why has your Dad rejected Biden's three requests for debates.
Remember when trump‚Äôs campaign had a Facebook ad about Biden and Ukraine, and it was mostly true but because the political and media establishment so widely rejects ukrainegate as truth. You want these people deciding for you what‚Äôs false, or you wanna decide for yourself?

Biden will be absent from the debate(s) whether he shows up or not.
Biden has sent three requests to the commission to debate Trump. Trump has sent zero. Now who's afraid to debate who again? Trump is easy meat, Trump knows it, he's hiding from debating Biden by claiming Biden won't debate him. Trump is afraid.
He also says Biden won't debate him. Biden has said on the record he's excited at the opportunity to debate him. He's sent three requests for debates to the commission. Trump has sent zero requests. Who's worried about debating who again?
Biden has commited to three debates with Trump. Trump has responded to none. The Fox bubble if Biden not wanting to debate Trump is the epitome on fake news. Biden has said he's excited to debate him. Who wouldn't be, he's easy meat.
Bellingham's a bit cooler, just saying.
Same here in Olympia. I'm planning on staying home all day.
thank you! And thank you to our next President, Joe Biden for immediately doing the same.
tbf you might be too far removed from reality of what Biden and other neoliberal are about. They need bad people on the other side in so people like you can blindly give your vote without asking for anything more. This is liberal's mess.
NONE of the suggested choices 4 #ComatoseBiden VP moves the needle 4 Democrats in 2020 election. #ElizabethWarren, #SusanRice &amp; #KamalaHarris ALL are from strong Democrat States &amp; are women of color. Joe‚Äôs choose HAS 2 B from a RED State to B effective.
If Biden's recent statements can be taken at face value (big if), it's sounding like among those vetted he's not considering which votes they'll bring so much as who he gets along well with. And no one excels at making folks feel appreciated in her presence like Elizabeth Warren.
#ComatoseJoe has NO IDEA WHAT 2 SAY OR DO, frm being UNABLE 2 ANSWER #ScriptedQuestions. ‚Å¶ has shown us that a #USPresident does NOT get a scripted time in office. ONLY NEED 2 HELP EVERYDAY CITIZENS. Easy 4 Trump, difficult 4 Biden
Keep in mind what #ChickenManJoe has ‚Äúdetailed‚Äù WILL destroy our Country. $Billions will go to States who screwed up their budgets &amp; are over-taxing the people for #PublicUnions. The ENTIRE COUNTRY WILL BE OVER-TAXED UNDER BIDEN. He will set us back 1000 years.
I love how Biden and his stans REALLY like telling people to not vote for Biden.
Biden will annihilate Trump in a debate. You know why? He is honest, he may forget shit but what he recalls will be the legit truth over Trumpster making shit up the whole time. I take the truthful senile man over a witting, lying huckster all day. #dumptrump
Also: 11. don‚Äôt write my name in, vote for Biden.
Selfish people who do not realize that we are in a fight for the survival of our democracy and not voting for Biden gives the corrupt racist evil traitor a chance at continuing his destruction of everything America stands for.
This is so tired. The three debates are all scheduled, they‚Äôre all going to happen, no more no less. And yes we all know Biden is going to look like shit at these.
Biden/Degeneress 2020: ‚ÄúYou get what you fucking deserve.‚Äù
A Biden vs Trump debate is literally a debate between good and evil.
Would you kindly show me one example of something Donald J Trump said or did that you respect?  (To respond to a DIFFERENT subject that you brought up, Joe Biden is not anyone's president because he is not a president. Also I never said anything to imply I support Joe Biden???)
I'm as anxious about anyone to knowing who our next Vice President will be, but Biden is following precedent with this delay.
I feel that Biden is in a tough place for VP....if he picks a POC then 'its only cause of BLM' and if he doesn't 'its bc he's rasict'.....hoping he picks the person most qualified regardless of color for ticket
If Biden does debate, all he should say after anything is: "Are you better off today than four years ago" that is it, nothing more.
Honestly, we need to give Joe Biden a break.  It‚Äôs obvious he still has head trauma from when he fought in WW1
Flashback to where the polls were standing before the Warren media blackout.
‚Äúin order for the president to win reelection, he is going to have to win all of the current toss-ups and make inroads in places that are leaning Biden's direction. That's not unheard of. Trump did the same thing in 2016.‚Äù Don‚Äôt be complacent!

On this week‚Äôs episode of the Beyond the Bubble podcast, we discuss why Democrats and Republicans are taking different approaches to voter canvassing, and the latest on the Biden veepstakes.

Joe Biden would wipe to floor with Trump in a debate. Trump can't wait, he's champing at the bit for it. Biden should say he won't debate him until he releases his taxes. What are you hiding Trump. Are you hiding you're not really a billionare, that Russia has him in their pocket
Poll: Trump Takes Lead over Biden   Gee, and that‚Äôs with the ubiquitous sampling bias. I sense a landslide.
Michigan Dems..  Do us all a favor and send  home.  Booing Hillary and not supporting Biden are dealbreakers. #VoteDontBoo
Both are likely right, Clinton isn't running, Biden is no angel, and the fun starts when by Oct. Trump, Biden, Pence are on respirator for Covid-19 with Nancy Pelosi in the Big Chair.
The choice should be crystal clear, we need Biden to bring our country back from the edge. We have one chance to make that happen and that's in November.
Sampling bias can do wonders for a losing candidate‚Äôs ego (Biden) - if only he could remember. But it won‚Äôt suppress Trump voters - it‚Äôs purpose.

You forgot Biden, he should be on that list as well seeing he has a fondness of fondling little girls.
Biden isn't going to "accept nomination"... because he won't be getting it!
The reason D's nomination process has proceeded as it has is so Globalist Elites can choose the nominee.  They will announce that choice when Biden pulls out for "health reasons"(dementia).

Biden Will Not Steal Presidency From Already President Republican Mark Patrick Seymour
Law &amp; order. Equal justice no matter what color. Against racism &amp; bigoted ppl &amp; against domestic violence. Jobs for all Americans. That‚Äôs what President Trump is about. Biden is selling R country &amp; ppls freedom &amp; rights away to China communist.
I'm not thrilled about that either. And I don't anticipate Biden's VP being real progressive either. Hoping that some of these replacements in the House/Senate will be the real driver (plus abolished filibuster)
Such fearmongering  a ludicrous assumption.  Americans do expect to be able to verify as many fear Dems. to use voter fraud is very real  But once bonafide, results are accepted. Will be no different with Pres. Trump. ../*[ warning by majority whip
Biden &amp; Xi wouldn't be a debate ‚Ä¶ it would be an embarrassment.
The Biden bunch. A bunch of psychopaths. Wake up america.
He‚Äôs saying that there will be violence if Biden wins. He‚Äôs ginning up his racist terrorist.
I agree, if debates don‚Äôt happen, it shouldn‚Äôt be because he‚Äôs trying to get out of it. There is no reason for Biden to back out.   Regardless, since they don‚Äôt seem to be informative, how are debates helpful to candidates? Seems like it presents only a short lived bump.

So true A vote for Biden is a vote for Bernie and AOC
In the highly unlikely event he does win, he will turn all foreign policy over to the Vice President along with all other Presidential duties, you won‚Äôt be voting for Biden, you will be voting for his Vice President
I'm sure if Biden gets Elected someone will invoke the 25th Amendment and have him removed, who ever is the VP is will be President without a vote for her.
Again Trump is a billionaire he does not need our money he donates his pay to charity his wife works he owns golf courses not on taxpayers get the right facts i hope you like work camps because that is where you will be if Biden wins but he is not
In the outrages social media driven crazed world we live in. His choice will inevitably piss off quite a few. We will see op-eds, tweets, Facebook posts about "I'm going to vote for Trump" because Biden picked X and not  X.
Regardless who Joe Biden picks as his VP running mate. He knows it will cause people to be mad.

Hey #KHive , if your choice for vp gets fucked over because of an internal political war and you feel raw enough about it to do drastic voting I want you to remember something.  If Biden loses, the large scale Dems will only ever blame us berners.  You'd be in the clear.
Biden will likely pull out of POTUS race on August 20th.   In what is to be his acceptance speech at the DNC Convention he will decline because of Alzheimer's diagnoses &amp; name a replacement.   The replacement will name Biden's candidate for VP as his VP candidate.

Their only hope is to convince Trump not to run so a more acceptable opponent for Biden can be at the top of the ballot. I wonder if a financial package is being prepared to get him to abdicate. He‚Äôll also need a country to take him in so he can avoid prosecution. Russia? Turkey?

Well Biden can‚Äôt win the election if a cure comes out
Maybe, but look at all the personal and professional things Trump did prior to being elected. Now we're trying to apply the same scandal logic to Biden? Just don't think it'll matter. People were tired of old guard corruption in Hillary, so she lost. Now we're tired of Trump.
I don't think it'll be close.  I think Biden wins in a landslide. Trump's base has shrunk for a year now, which is why he's gone harder and harder right as the election gets closer. IMO his VP is of little consequence at this point.

Lots of people against trump also are against Biden because yes it‚Äôs creepy what he does too.
I‚Äôve been saying for a while that Biden should hinge any debates on Trump releasing his taxes for the last twenty years. Even if we get them from Deutsche Bank, it‚Äôd be satisfying to make him release them himself.

WHY ARE YOU BANNING TIKTOK NOW I HAVE TO VOTE FOR BIDEN
Yes. But we have the public supporting BLM, we have down ballots revealing the dirty laundry of the Dems, and a far greater expectation of change than in the 90s. Every act Biden does will be scrutinized and dissected. Trump is too foolish to fear. Biden will fear the people.
Oh there are defiantly boot lickers in the bunch &amp; BlueMaga for sure but there are people, myself included, that think Biden will beat, degrade, &amp; blame progressives but he is far less likely to outright kill. Dem propaganda requires the illusion of fairness, &amp; we can use that.
I'm not voting for him but only because I am in a safe blue district. I think the reason people are voting for Biden, as wretched as he is, is because its a two party system &amp; Trump if given the chance will commit genocide &amp; Biden is far less likely to do so. Its so fucked.

Election delay.  Hey - I've got an idea. Those 150,000 dead people? Let's assume they would vote for Biden and just hand over those votes over to Joe. After all, if it weren't for Trump, they might still be alive.
Ginsburg is being kept barely alive. Biden is being fed Adderall before all appearances! Does the 21st amendment apply to candidates? It should! Oh well. Biden is under indictment. Grand juries are formed! Durham is a very busy man. So is Lindsay Graham! October fireworks!!!
Thankfully President Biden will move them right back in a few months.  is both a traitor and a moron.The fact that Biden has not chosen a VP a week into August before the election is a stupid fucking publicity stunt. This is not going to benefit the country. Do better DNC. This is not a GOP supporting tweet, I‚Äôm just fucking tired of 60+ year olds acting like fucking children.
Joe Biden as well as Donald Trump are BOTH both not mental fit or stable to run the United States. We are fucked either way.
I hope Biden pardons him. What an excruciating &amp; inhumane sentence.  Those judges that upheld his sentence were proudly waving their racist flag. Each one of those white male judges should be arrested for this alone.
Biden‚Äôs Contra outreach? You‚Äôd think
Biden has the Contras running his Latino outreach
Oh ffs Biden is going to say out loud everything third wayers think
I agree. Biden is fucked and his VP will take over.
Biden is Not-A-Nazi. Yeah...  I'll go with #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Oh jeez. Go read the court transcripts.... They are public information. Take the wool off from over your eyes.
I can't find reasonable reasons to not like Biden
They are just not scary dogs. You can‚Äôt make them scary. That‚Äôs the problem Trump has wirh Biden
So insanly heartbreaking &amp; so completely avoidable. We're not beating this until we have an actual PRESIDENT. Please hurry Biden White House.
Wall Street is fine with Biden and Pelosi
I hope they get Kanye on the ballot. The few votes he gets will come from trump not Biden! The Democrats are smart enough to understand that he is mentally ill...like trump!
Well no shit Sherlock. Why would anyone drink hand sanitizer. It must be people who love Biden/Sanders/AOC. Only those people would be dumb enough
I guess Biden has your vote!!!
Problem was they cast a Newfie or St Bernard or something and they are just not scarie dogs.   That‚Äôs the problem with the whole scary socialist Biden thing
Tara Reade is not credible. I don‚Äôt want Biden either but this is nonsense
Feel sorry for the lower backs of all the Biden stans. You weren't expecting to do this much heavy lifting today.
If I was Biden, I'd refuse to debate at all unless tRump releases his taxes. But that's me.üôÑ
Guys, let‚Äôs start a don‚Äôt settle for Biden campaign! #dontsettleforbiden #NoComradesUnder1k #nocomradeunder1k  #NoComradeLeftBehind
It's called Democratic Socialism, and it's about to improve the quality of all our lives.  Trump can't stop it, Biden can't stop it and YOU certainly can't stop it.
Hmm, great question. Maybe he made less than Hunter Biden and his buddies made by peddling influence and access to Daddy Joe to foreign governments?
Both candidates arguably have the signs of old age present. Trump is not smart though so Biden has him there.
Come on...PAT! The MURDEROUS RISE in COVID ‚Äòcases‚Äô (but not deaths) is due to the DISPARATE and non ‚ÄòUNIFORMALLY‚Äô response by the local ‚ÄòCITIZENTRY‚Äô. I think Fauci has gone BIDEN, listen to his answer again for the above words. #PutThatInYour
So why are you using 2 pics of Biden praying to say he is  ‚Äúdiminished.‚Äù ARE there any pics of your dad praying?
Pelosi would fight it with every fiber of her being. Biden too
On a scale of 1 to "C'mon, man!" how fucked is Joe Biden?
What are you afraid of Joe Biden!!! That they will find that you have Alzheimer's!!!
Take the money you're spending on crack, which you must be on to work for that lunatic, and buy some self-respect. Do you really believe all that propaganda? When Biden is elected, you'll be reminded what being presidential looks like again.
Most generous translation is we got to continue Nation wide protests during Biden's time in offic.  We will, but  let's face the fact: Biden simply hasn't #EarnedOurVote #EarnedNotGiven
That's because Joe Biden can't put 2 words together to make a sentence!! That's why they want to stop all presidential debates!!!
A pandemic didn't budge Biden.  National protests and riots didn't budge Biden.  He CAN be budged BUT not by the Left.
( also Biden did a eulogy for a segregationist if you really want to go there)
And if biden wins then the establishment will say incremental steps are the way and the country dosnt need radical change thus us getting M4A will be a forever pipe dream
They with Biden They Hiden
Biden supporters are Republicans who miss the veneer of respectability.
Biden has cognitive decline of some sort.  Why are people trying to pretend he doesn't and comparing it to ridiculous things?  The dems want the status quo.  Any warm body will do.  That's why they despise trump because he was hoping to affect change.
Well Biden, Pelosi. The whole DNC platform structured to lure back Reagan Democrats
Whomever the pick is, needs to be very qualified. Biden will likely be determined incompetent.
And Joe Biden and his staff are afraid to debate him, so...
A debate isn't just for Trump and Biden.  It's for us, too.  We deserve to ask both these pricks pointed questions.   Iron out the fundamental differences in policy/governance.   It would be unprecedented to back out entirely.
What "risks"? Forgetting who/when/where he is? There's only one real reason Biden won't debate: he can't. They don't know if he's going to have a good day or a bad day and can't schedule one. He's unfit. Replace him.
Normally, I'd agree with you, but doing that would make Joe Biden president. So  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Imagine thinking I'll drop everything I believe in just to haul Biden's corpse over the finish line.
Yeah. No. I never wanted Biden but she is a grifter
Scores brownie points over Biden.
Legit thought she was describing Trump AND Biden until the second part. How anyone can say Trump lite I better is beyond me.
My concern is that even with a non GOP administration. We won‚Äôt get it. The Dem Party voted against adding M4A to their platform, as well as Biden saying he would Veto it.
This is crazy they did this
Meh. I always thought the Tara Reede thing was nonsense. I don‚Äôt want Biden but that isn‚Äôt a thing imo
One of Biden‚Äôs largest bundlers has the lucrative contract to provide substandard medical care to Mississippi prisons
If Biden avoids all debates with Trump then he's already lost.  A Universally weak gesture that Americans will seize upon.
Biden's "build back better" "buy American" message is like Trump's message the last 3-1/2 years. The difference is, Trump actually brought back companies that Barack O-sham-a AND Sniffy Joe sold to the Chinese. Bottom line is Touchy Feely Creepy Sniffy Joe has no...
Legit question that deserves a Biden answer.
Biden has been in politics for close to 50 years and hasn't done a damn thing! I mean, other than enrich himself and his neer-do-well kids.
Maybe you should turn off the tv and go to work? #AmericaOrTrump #Biden
Guess what, who all ready new he was suffering from mental illness it's called dementia !!! And remember you had no problem calling the President mentally ill!!! Joe Biden is unfit to be running for any office!!!
A vote for a third party, at this point, is a vote for trump. We can still vote for Biden and remain in the streets.
He can‚Äôt make Biden scary. He keeps trying.
Amazing answers. One of mine favorite things about Trump is: He thinks it &amp; say it!!  Not a Politician. I wonder why when same question is posed for Obama or Biden there‚Äôs no answers?
Biden just isn‚Äôt viscerally  loathsome in the way Hillary is
Since Joe Biden is adamantly opposed to #MedicareForAll and #UBI I really want to hear a good argument for why Americans should believe he would handle #COVID19 better than Trump.  Can't say he listens to healthcare experts over his Big Money Donors, can we? ü§î
Biden/Tom Perez/Anita Dunn/Jack Sullivan/Nancy Pelosi  risk not providing enough of a contrast to Trump‚Äôs corruption and indifference to poverty and death. ( on account of their almost exclusively corporate focus and decades long indifference to poverty &amp; death)
Republicans against Trump groups are growing in numbers...over that of Fools for Trump.  #trump #vote
Yes we can again is a better slogan than the no malarkey tour.  Biden should own it and order blue hats...lol
Biden just out and out appealing to donors rather than voters
Biden has promised to pick a VP based on immutable traits like sex and color, rather than skills or qualifications. How can you, or ANY Democrat, support tokenism at the VP level?
I get nothing from either Biden or Trump. But continue trying to tell me how to vote ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è at least I stood by my principles. Just as you would have according to your retweet.
Trump is trying to rig the election with mail slowdown, voter suppression, inciting race riots in Democratic cities, and announcing crimes against Obama and Biden.
Oh my god, fuck all the way off. This statement is the antithesis of Biden's record in Washington.
I would shit kittens if I saw a Prius driving around with giant redneck-style Biden flags coming out of it. Please do this.
This is not in any way a problem for Biden.

You center liberals keep gaslighting progressives will only keep them from voting. There is NO enthusiasm for biden when i vote for him it will be like taking a dump nessacary but never enjoyable...
Really wish Biden was open to ending this
THIS  Trump won because Obama causes most people pain.   Biden better learn that
Let's not presume Biden will win. We must vote.
Love hearing old white men jabs from Biden people.
Let me ask you; are you better off than you were 4 years ago. Unless you‚Äôre in the upper 1% you certainly aren‚Äôt. So, what have you got to lose by voting for Biden?
The government needs to make this a priority. Hopefully they could still be beneficial when Biden takes office.
Sanders guy, not voting Biden.
Biden isn't even left of you.
#NobodyLikesTrump not even Bernie‚Äôs people.  #VoteBlue #Biden #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
It's also abundantly clear Joe Biden is ALSO not up for the job.  I demand a THIRD option.
Biden is a known quantity for the donor class. Consistently conservative in a way that appeals to them. No boat rocking.
Here‚Äôs a SNIFFY JOE campaign slogan that Democrats can try; ‚ÄúGet behind Biden‚Ä¶ Before he gets behind you.‚Äù You‚Äôre welcome. #PutThatInYourPipe
Funerals are supposed to be for eulogies, not Biden campaign speeches. You Democratscare horrible!
Please STOP, promoting anti trumpers.  They are the worst, of the worst.  Its why we have Biden instead of bernie.
Does Jill Biden know what you‚Äôll do for political power?
If you truly support Biden, then vote Biden, not because he isn‚Äôt Trump. If you support Trump, vote Trump. If you support third party, vote third party. But don‚Äôt infringe upon Democracy, the right to make your own vote. And don‚Äôt stop others trying to inform the public.
If all the Biden supporters who can‚Äôt tell me how he is a better candidate other than ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt Trump‚Äù realized that they could choose a different option, like 3rd party.... The 3rd party would win. Don‚Äôt contribute to the cycle.
I am AMAZED that a majority of people think Trump and Republicans are better on economy.  We have a lot of STUPID people out there.  Obama and Dems got us out of the Bush recession. Biden and Dems can get us out of #TrumpRecession #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Thank you, Mr. Biden, for your leadership at this time.  #Biden2020 #Biden2020Landslide #BidenForAmerica
How are you going to do that? We are going to #MailInVoting to vote you out. #Biden #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
If Biden wins nothing will "Fundamentally Change"   We as Americans need and demand #Change   If Biden won't do it another fake Alt-right populous will spring up 2024.  Poke a hole in THAT logic....
Damage control is the best argument Biden has üëç  I understand and respect your decision.
The second Biden wins Liberals will immediately side with Republicans against Bernie Sanders supporters/Progressives/Anti-Fascists/Nazi Punchers!  Mark my tweet.
Hmm I think we control the narrative enough to shame most Trumpers into hiding, but they are becoming more emboldened ü§î  Depends: will liberals turn on Antifa?   Will Biden deem us "terrorists" just for demanding fundamental change?
Hmm there are a lot of variables.   Pros and Cons to each. If Biden wins liberals will turn on us and embrace modern Republican values.  If Trump wins we-- more or less-- stay united in opposition. Lots of dissatisfied citizens marching in the streets sounds like the cure to me.
Do reined I still can‚Äôt believe that Biden is the nominee
My man is looking cartoonishly fucked up in that photo.  Biden's cop fetish is sick and gross. He can't be president.
Oh, I wouldn't argue in Biden's favor üòâ
It makes sense when you consider that Biden is old as grave dust and hasn't had any non-square fun in his entire life. He's afraid of jazz-related murders.Remember when Americans decided who the president would be?
But remember for privileged leftists re-electing trump might be ok but for those on margins it‚Äôs a huge difference with real consequences. Note Chomsky backs Biden.
The people out there preaching the pragmatism of Biden ignoring all leftist policy demands to attract moderate voters clearly haven‚Äôt read this. Democrats haven‚Äôt won the white vote in over 30 years. Going for moderate republicans isn‚Äôt the path to victory
Its like Trump listened to John Lennon's "Imagine" and thought. I could blame that on Joe Biden. Smhü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Geoff Duncan got caught. Looking at Georgia‚Äôs guidelines, they are willing to let your child die. Vote for  in 2020. Joe Biden will protect your child, Joe knows the pain of losing a child.
African American "Christians" are predominantly voting Democrat Biden due to preachers in wolves clothing -
Joe Biden is the actual Anti-Christ. OMG!!!!!
Biden's all like...
Dammit it people, I meant I waited hours for someone to point out that he said it wrong. He can't get away with a single misspeak. Try listening to Biden complete a sentence. I don't agree with Dinesh on this, but he is right about different pronounciations.
Hahahah!! The Biden Gaffe Damage Control team is on scene! Joe Biden Can‚Äôt pronounce fitness, Let alone monolith or even remember the word monolith!
Maybe instead of trying to win a bigger crowd in Ohio, you should try to win the war on covid. 150k dead and rising and you're taking golf trips. Well at least when you lose the election to biden in November "it is what it is." #EndTheNightmare #voteblue #FakePresident #Biden2020
That‚Äôs right.  Guess he‚Äôs on one.  Upset over the election results,  and Joe Biden.  Didn‚Äôt go to cemetery because his hair might get wet!  So they say he said.  He‚Äôs unglued!
Thanks Biden social media managers!
I think Biden is picking Harris
I am absolutely positive that THAT is exactly what Biden &amp; Trump's owNER wants people to think TWO FALSE CATEGORIES ONLY If you don't believe the wmds russiagate incubator babies media you have to be you ABSOLUTELY have to be a Cheeto lover or a PRO-WAR Obama "democrat"üôÑ STUPID
So the Second Amendment will just go away, overnight, without YOU??  BS, Biden will not take our guns.  You are so desperate with another SCARE tactic.  Just resign and save us the trouble of an Election!!!
Imagine unironically believing that JOE BIDEN is what socialists, Communists, and Anarchists want
Trust me when I tell you that you are the tremendous lawlessness that‚Äôs here in the United States. Please to go ahead and resign before you get embarrassed by losing badly against Joe Biden
And know Biden is against God! And he‚Äôs going to take away your guns!!ü•∂ü•∂
I always respected you,but I am so disappointed because your remarks are racist.Whoever Joe Biden pics as his running mate will not be about race it will be about who is the most intelligent and who fits the vice president position .shame on you ,you should know better
I find this very racist I am surprised ,and disappointed at C cup
He's saying the Latino community is rich and diverse, but discourse tends to center on the black community. If you actually think Biden meant "blacks have no culture" you've got epic brain worms.
After watching POTUS &amp; Biden speak lately, Bush II looks like the most eloquent SOB ever! ü§£
Jesus shut the fuck up with this nonsense. Maybe Biden could listen and help himself by supporting incredibly popular policy! Why is it the fault of Biden‚Äôs critics for asking for more, and not Biden himself for refusing to get behind policies popular with voters?
Let me just say that if Biden WAS powerful enough to actually hurt God, maybe the smart money would be to follow him instead.
If there is a God, Trump will be watching Biden as POTUS from a prison cell.  Narcissists are always the victims in their own eyes.
Trump just says things and throws ‚Äústuff‚Äù out there to see what will stick or what he can make people believe. Biden wants to hurt God? What?
Michelle Obama! Biden would completely clean Trump‚Äôs clock and Democrats would surge down the ballot. We want Michelle! #MichelleObama
Boy you don‚Äôt give up do you?  A new lie daily re Biden.  ü§Æ
Some receipts for that claim, btw:
The right is claiming that Biden is going to do a lot of things that most people on the left actulaly want and are upset because nobody believes Biden will do a single one of them.
I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm probably in a bubble with my politics, but I sure haven‚Äôt seen any organic Joe Biden support down in Seattle.
ok, that's completely fair - my failure to acknowledge the very real and present threat to people from even the Democratic party.  But I don't know of any case in which that harm would be greater under Biden than under Trump.
Honestly, sometimes my biggest worry is all the so-called "leftists" that behave as if they think Biden is worse than Trump. yeah, Biden is not a great candidate and I don't expect him to bring much, but at this point, not being actively malicious is a huge step up.

Joe Biden doesn't have to be held to any standard,he is the high standard that others need to be held to
Trump fundraising numbers way up, over Biden in July. Don't fall for this distraction.
My family took an 11 night road trip from New Orleans through Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina...we did not encounter 1 Biden sign.  In Fernandina Beach the guy who told my family we set up to close to them on the beach..likely Biden voter
Seriously? Trump would pulverize Biden. His only hope for a debate win against POTUS would be the "Trump-is-a-bully" media blitz that would inevitably occur thereafter.
Joe Biden announced that he will definitely campaign in all 13 States.
Sorry I'm a centrist Except for I mean a REAL centrist NOT someone who profits off of War and the death and suffering of human beings through Healthcare like Hillary or Biden for Pelosi and Schumer and desperately tries to call themselves centrist ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
So if Trump wins, it won't matter to him because he'll have another 4 years to trample our constitution and consolidate power.  If Biden wins, Repugnicons will blame him and the Dems.  Either way, America will lose when it all comes crashing down.
This is what it's come to? Very old men bragging about their cognitive test scores while the country burns?

I know that he was drummed out of the election the first time for multiple acts of plagiarism but I'm pretty sure Biden really said this and really meant it when he said it Of course he doesn't remember it at all but he really meant it ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Spectacular clips for the next 10 Biden ads.
Just spitballing but how about supporting a Democrat instead of Joe Biden? At least 9 out of 10 of their voters care about human life and he doesn't
Jesus neither Trump nor Biden could wipe their own ass without help And they both get it from the same exact nonpartisan permanent beltway establishment so......
Can anyone explain how a Biden presidency would be good, without using the "get trump out" argument?
Genuinely curious in your opinion, what does Kamala bring to the table as Biden‚Äôs VP? Which group of voters does she help with?
Seriously, this should just be Biden‚Äôs campaign slogan: You won‚Äôt have to worry about my tweets!
Uhh ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äù, or rather  Biden twitter team,you do realize there is new fangled apps out there now that allow a person to pre-load and post tweets at scheduled times?? So...President Trump doesn‚Äôt need to tweet on Monday morning for it to appear on Monday...  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I wish the Republicans would just put up another option because then there might be a better choice for our future. Biden isn't good either. We need someone who can bridge gaps and get people together
Don‚Äôt let facts get in the way of a good narrative. Nearly 50% of republicans and 88% of democrats support M4A. The republicans that support M4A are probably the mythical moderates you want Biden to attract. Supporting M4A makes him more electable, not less.
At this point, I figure even if Biden does suck, he can't possibly suck as much as Trump and he'll surely do it more quietly
Warren would make having to vote for Biden a lot more palatable. Harris would make doing so nauseating.
The combination of personality disorders Trump has are sometimes referred to as "malignant narcissism" or the "Dark Triad/Tetrad". Giving someone like this power has only ever resulted in chaos and destruction.  On the other hand, Biden doesn't exhibit any of these disorders.

Could you please get your candidate  Biden out of the basement? He's hiding his behind coronavirus.
In a perfect world.  A 3rd party vote is voter suicide. I hate Trump and Biden as much as the next guy, but it's gonna take a massive push to convince enough people to vote 3rd party to actually make it worthwhile. Until then you're likely just throwing your vote away.
Imagine thinking neoliberal, moderate Republican in policy Joe fucking Biden is a socialist or communist. Christ.
I guess you slept through the entire eight years of the Obama's administration?(? Maybe Biden could remind you about that if he still remembers!
GO JOE BIDEN!  YOUVE GOT THIS!
Harris allies granted a Biden telcon about Harris loyalty, but she was not on that call? Sounds like vetting to me.

Hard choice: should I vote for a Repub dumbass who is totally irresponsible in handling the #COVID19Pandemic 19 crisis and the #GeorgeFloyd riots (#Trump), or Iraq War-supporting "let's bomb the shit out of Afghanistan", racist towards Arabs Neo-Liberal (#Biden)?
I don‚Äôt want to hear any bitching and moaning after Joe Biden picks his VP. Many people are going to be disappointed, no matter who he picks. But this should be a moment for Democrats to unite. So practice grace in congratulating the pick now. I‚Äôm serious.‚Äù George Takei  I concur
Biden wasn't my 1st choice...or 2nd, or 3rd.  I still remember the 90s. Crime bill. Anita Hill.  It's perfectly fair to criticize.  Still voting for him though. Even at his worst, I'll take him over Trump all damn day.
Biden needs to a preemptive attack, ridiculing and exposing the lies before it is released. This, when it is released it will be old news and make Barr look like a fool.
You're a lying dog faced pony soldier! Cut the malarkey! My wife's name is... Oh Oh Oh, you know the thing. C'mon, Man! Oops, my time is up.  "I'm Joe Biden and I forgot this message"
They want our lives to be a misery, and think that we‚Äôre shallow and stupid enough to blame Trump for it, so that we‚Äôll vote for for Joe Biden... speaking for myself, I‚Äôll vote for Joe Biden when one of the living dead runs against him, not sooner.
I don‚Äôt think believing something like that does anybody any good. Everybody just support Biden! Quit putting all these choices down. Jesus. He will pick who he will pick. All of this conjecture doesn‚Äôt do any good.
Quit putting Democrats down. Don‚Äôt put women down. Just support Biden and his choices. I‚Äôm so sick of seeing people putting each other, or others down on the Democrat side. It‚Äôs crazy. Have we learned nothing?
And Joe Biden will make his choice well.
Biden isn‚Äôt that kind of guy. He‚Äôs not gonna be afraid of that.
In the end, it doesn‚Äôt matter what we think. That is Biden‚Äôs decision. I just hope he gets rid of Dodd.
There‚Äôs not a whole lot of Republicans left didn‚Äôt back Trump. And I really doubt Biden is going to pick anyone who backed Trump.
This is some seriously good, imaginative stuff. This is something I really wanted to see in this election cycle where someone from outside the Biden campaign &amp; other traditional Democratic PACs to go after Trump hard in the same mean, downright disrespectful way he treats others

I trust Biden to Vet and pick the appropriate VP. I think everybody should stay out of it and quit giving their conjecture to what should happen. Just trust the presumptive nominee. You can‚Äôt change his decision anyway.
Are they? How so? I think there are a lot more things to be flipping out about right now. Biden will vet and pick who he picks.

These are the people that will be enthusiastically voting for Joe Biden and going back into political hibernation once he takes office, because they can go back to brunch.
I have a theory about this. I think if Trump goes down, Pence is the candidate of the GOP, and I don't think Biden beats Pence. Pence isn't "Trumpy" enough to push away Never Trumpers. Trump dying right now may actually not be better.
If I were still a centrist Democrat, I would be very scared. She will be de facto president if Biden remains as a puppet-figurehead, or the president if Biden resigns. And it will be a dual Harris/Pelosi run country.
No, he shouldn‚Äôt b/c that would give the GOP time to offer up a more legit candidate who could potentially beat Biden.  Plus, I wanna see trump get his fat ass kicked. üò¨ #WeWillVote

Today I want to give you my insights on the big stories of the week. I have five updates to share with you covering the NRA, the Second Amendment, the Flynn case, Sally Yates, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts, Biden, plus viewer comments. Watch here
There will be some live elements, but a heavy focus on video-storytelling.  As anyone knows from watching live events during the pandemic -- from Biden's campaign events to the NFL Draft -- it's hard to do live programming remotely.
Biden foreign policy adviser ‚Å¶ on ODNI statement on foreign interference in 2020 election:
The Democrat Party is America's #1 HATE GROUP!  See: Portland, BLM, Antifa, Teacher Unions, Hollywood Elites, Pro Athletes, NAACP, ACLU, Planned Parenthood, Big Tech, College Professors, CAIR, Main Stream Media, SPLC, Al Sharpton, Joe Biden, and on and on...  VOTE RED in 2020!!!
The DNC and Biden campaign are approaching this most unusual convention as a production of four two-hour "TV shows." Expect lots of prerecorded videos.  There will be a "host" each night to keep the program running and segue between videos and speakers.
Pence spox: ‚ÄúYou would think that for a party that didn‚Äôt show up four years ago, they‚Äôd learn from their lessons and just show up."  Biden spox: Pence going to Wisconsin is "disgraceful."
If elected, former Vice President Biden would be only the second Catholic ever elected to the highest office. He called the president's comments yesterday a "smear [to his] faith in a political attack."
I wish you didn‚Äôt do this, but you did. You‚Äôre terrible. Like there‚Äôs a choice to not vote for Biden and keep our American values, our very America. I‚Äôll never watch you again. Vote Biden.
"I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook, man."  ‚Äî Joe Biden, describing fellow candidate Barack Obama
. "Joe Biden...has led the fight against foreign interference for years, and has refused to accept any foreign materials intended to help him in this election - something that Donald Trump and his campaign have repeatedly failed to do."
#RepublicansForBidenNow is a group of life-long Republicans united with a single purpose to defeat Trump and elect Biden instead.  We are choosing country over party.    We are supporting Joe Biden as our next President.   We hope you will do the same!
Why would he want to accept a lesser position.  Two, even were he willing, he probably wouldn't be able to do so unless it were in the final two years of Biden's term.  I imagine he'd consider a SCOTUS nom, though.
.   ‚ÄúRussia is actively working to quote 'denigrate' Joe Biden. My question for you: Ron Johnson senator from Wisconsin is actively working to denigrate Joe Biden. Are they in cahoots?"
Rush Limbaugh attacks Biden‚Äôs faith: Talk about family tragedies is just ‚Äúa crutch‚Äù that liberals ‚Äúare allowed to lean on‚Äù
NEW: Biden campaign responds to intelligence update on foreign interference, with activity from Russia, China, Iran.  Statement from  "Donald Trump has publicly and repeatedly invited, emboldened, and even tried to coerce foreign interference in American elections.‚Äù
Remember this from December? When OANN featured Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach and his anti-Biden conspiracies? Many warned at the time that his motives were suspect. Today, the US government confirmed that he is part of the Kremlin's effort to weaken Biden. OANN is complicit.
Greg Gutfeld has been back for all of five minutes and is already making predictions that Biden "will be gone before November"
. sets expectations low for  running mate pick, claiming that it doesn't matter who he picks.  Biden has two choices,  &amp;  Pelosi may not think they matter, but she's in the minority.
Pence adds trip to Wisconsin during the D.N.C. in Milwaukee, as Biden cancels speech there -- underscoring the different political wagers the two campaigns are making.
Biden can't lose my vote but Harris seems like such an obvious pick with her smarts and her ENERGY. Susan Rice seems like a dud, what's her appeal for anyone under 50?
Who are you?  Everyone KNOWs that Biden doesn't write his tweets.  Are you one person or are you a team?  Does the team make sure to tell Biden what they have posted in case he is asked?   Does the team take the time needed to explain their tweets to Biden?
Russia trying to undermine Biden in election, White House intelligence report says
NEW: Biden senior advisor  responds to ODNI stmt on foreign interference in the 2020 election: "Donald Trump has publicly and repeatedly invited, emboldened, and even tried to coerce foreign interference in American elections."
Trump, with hurt God line, may be playing to anti-Catholic prejudice in his base. Listen to right wing radio, you will come upon lingering Bible Belt bigotry, advancing  fantasy that Catholic charities promotes immigrants to collect $$ from Uncle Sam.
Yes, Biden's eagerness for innocent bloodshed must greatly offend God. #sorrynotsorry
Notice how Trump raped a 13 year old girl and Biden didn‚Äôt.
"I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook, man."  ‚Äî Joe Biden, describing fellow candidate Barack Obama
Notice how Trump was close pals with noted child sexual traffickers Epstein and Maxwell and Biden wasn‚Äôt.
Not his views, but his conduct: "The case of a 'Catholic politician' who is 'consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws' would constitute 'formal cooperation' in grave sin that is 'manifest,' the letter continued."
GOP is already setting the table for this knowing that Biden likely wins. We‚Äôve seen this playbook before. Obama‚Äôs ‚Äò08 win was convincing, the econ crisis was devastating, but the GOP still succeeded in making the recovery as miserable and crushingly slow as possible.
Joe Biden‚Äôs Agenda for Women has a line item ‚ÄúSupport workers‚Äô ability to have fair and flexible schedules,‚Äù which certainly sounds nice. But the actual policies being advanced under that banner would outlaw certain work relationships. #IWpol #IWww
Well Joe Biden‚Äôs twitter handler. We don‚Äôt believe Joe Biden. Every time he is allowed to speak candidly about Black people he says what he means.

The US government also said China "prefers that President Trump ... does not win reelection" and that Iran "seeks to undermine ... President Trump."   BUT the US didn't say they're actively "denigrating" Trump, like Russia is with Biden. (and like Russia did with Clinton in 2016)

I‚Äôm not going to dispute the point you‚Äôre making but you‚Äôre overlooking mine. Do you know that undecided voters care about Biden‚Äôs gaffes and that the only reason they wouldn‚Äôt care is because the media isn‚Äôt reporting on it enough?
"The U.S. intelligence community has assessed that Russia has undertaken a broad effort to damage Democratic Joe Biden‚Äôs bid for the presidency, while China prefers that President Trump not win reelection."
Possibly, but Ds don't vote on this issue like Rs do and if she believes (as everyone in DC does) the polls she may feel like Biden almost has this in the bag. It depends on how sick she is though, if she feels she can hang on for a while she won't do anything.
If I had my way, I‚Äôd stop all mail in and absentee voting, force all the +60 trump supporters to stand in line for 10 hours with people coughing and no masks, that would endure a Biden win
Biden is certainly far from perfect and there are plenty of things that you could hit him on. But NOT this topic and sure as hell not by THIS man. This really infuriates me and this attack / comments are just disgusting and disgraceful, much like Trump himself.

The intelligence community says China wants Trump to lose. Biden wants Trump to lose. Are they in cahoots? Such a lazy way of thinking. A country like Russia or China preferring a candidate or even actively trying to help a candidate doesn't mean that that candidate is colluding.

Biden's brain doesn't have the capacity to organized thought....he is not fit for President of the USA. The Dem cult is attempting to put a guy into office they can completely manipulate. Dems care nothing about the best welfare of the nation let alone their candidate Biden.

China wants Biden is the second part.
Joe Biden wants to dramatically raise taxes on the American people even during a pandemic. He has endorsed personal income tax hikes, small business tax hikes, carbon taxes, payroll tax hikes, and a return of the much-despised individual mandate tax.
Top U.S. counterintel official names Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach as part of Russian disinfo effort targeting Biden --&gt;    Derkach told us that he has given info to Johnson‚Äôs and Grassley‚Äôs Senate committees, which they deny.
‚ÄúWhat [Biden] does need to do is assure them that he isn‚Äôt a risky pick. One way to do this is to pick a VP that voters see as capable and experienced enough to take over if he can‚Äôt continue to do his job. It‚Äôs really not any more complicated than that.‚Äù

I've seen too many times how all it takes is one Chris Dodd. Biden clearly sees absolutely nothing wrong with Dodd's behavior and that's what counts.

WHAT'S CLEAR: Democrats will *hate* this statement because it appears to draw anequivalence between Russia's specific scheme re: Biden and China's general, public-facing policy pressure.  Ds hated the last statement for the same reason.
Extraordinary statement from Bill Evanina, Director of the National Counterintelligence &amp; Security Center at ODNI on election security. It says: China wants Trump to lose bc it views him as ‚Äúunpredictable‚Äù; Russia wants Biden to lose bc it views him as ‚Äúanti-Russia establishment‚Äù

Miller has tightened its press &amp; messaging. He sends out 1-page lists of talking points each AM to senior campaign aides &amp; top surrogates. And he has helped Trump focus more on responding to COVID &amp; attempting to tie Biden to "extreme leftists."

"We assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù"
The equivalence here between China making official government policy statements, something every government in the world does, and Russia using active measures to target Biden is complete and total BS.
You throw "dementia" around like it's a fact. Guess you haven't seen the vid where Trump slurs his words and uses 2 hands to drink water. But you no doubt have seen all of Biden's lapses. And remember, you may have slept at a Holiday Inn Express last night but you're not a ...
This confirms what  and I reported last month: That Derkach has set off alarms among Democrats worried that he's seeding derogatory anti-Biden propaganda into ongoing GOP-led congressional investigations.
Chris Dodd is literally on the vetting committee and Biden just yesterday shrugged off his comments as "said off line". This is not isolated, it is pervasive at the highest levels of the campaign. Mealy mouthed compliments are subtweets don't make up for that.
Dear Joe Biden, Susan Rice is not the answer.

Trump says he saved millions of lives? That's insanity!! Trump has literally killed 160,000 people so far. Is he really proud of that number? Jesus!! Grab the wheel! Vote Biden to save our nation and save our lives!
Well then... You will be voting for Biden? Cuz Trump has created this entire disaster. All on his watch!! We are bankrupt. We are sick and dying. And we are divided.   Again, all happened on Trump's watch. Don't blame Dems for your idiot President and pathetic administration.

If Biden wins, he will die during his 1st term for sure! Then the unelected VP will control the country. It‚Äôs not about public will, it‚Äôs about the Leftist establishment. Btw, Seattle‚Äôs city council wants to abolish the police! I‚Äôm so angry! They should burn in hell!
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Joe Biden is the ONLY person that can save this nation. Trump has murdered 160,000 Americans in less than 4 months! Including his "friend" Herman Cain.
Trump is the worst President ever. I'm voting to save this nation! I am voting for Joe Biden!
Biden wasn‚Äôt declared the winner of the entire primary after South Carolina, but the writing was on the wall.  Biden was crushing it with black voters and Bernie wasn‚Äôt.
However I see it‚Äôs only okay to you when people endorse Bernie, but when they endorse Biden, it‚Äôs RiGgEd!1!1!
Bernie folk will just revise history to fit their narrative.  They pretend that Biden was in 4th place after SC and that Pete and Amy had booming successful campaigns. Meanwhile in real life, Biden vaulted to 2nd place in delegates and 1st in popular vote.
Also, with the exception of NV; the other two were essentially ties and Biden blew Bernie out of the water in SC.   So of course it had a huge effect.  Larger state, wins every county and CD...sooo
This is patently false.  Biden was in second place after SC.  Die mad Berner
The funny thing is, Biden was in 2nd place after South Carolina.
After SC, Biden was in second place in delegates. I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt understand how things work.
Lol Klobuchar and Buttigieg did not have more viable campaigns at all. Biden dominated the field in South Carolina, and the upcoming states were similar demographically.
Anyone still considering voting 3rd party!! Listen up!!! This is not the time to even play roulette! We must all be on the same page! Biden is our only savior from this horrible administration! Let's all work together on this!

America was great when Obama was President! Then.... This orange idiot got elected and everything went to hell! We are bankrupt, sick, and divided.   So yes!! I am voting for Biden!
1) Biden has nothing to do with Clinton 2) If guilty Dems would want him prosecuted 3) Trump admin keeps kids in cages and separated them from parents WITHOUT TRACKING THEM 4) Trump bragged about walking in on naked and half-dressed underage girls

Chris Wallace challenges Biden to follow Trump on 'Fox News Sunday,' says ex-VP must 'get into game shape'
You raised the government debt by $6 trillion which is actually a $6 trillion tax increase because the only way you can pay off debt is by raising taxes.  So you cut taxes now and got the accolades and Biden will have to raise taxes to pay off the DEBT YOUR TAX CUTS created.
Racist Trump is going to try and outflank right wing Biden on this....
A normal sane human would know your boy trump is a cold blooded killer. Yep, Biden is getting my vote.
No dreaming... Facts!! Biden is going to be your President!
I know little of the experience of these women, but considering Biden's age, and that if he dies the VP becomes President, the VP needs to be someone who has governing or legislative experience.
The Great American Idiot!! Who said that? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ The left has been like a broken record, warning you cult Trumpers of the dangers of Covid-19! Look at your boy Lorenzo Cain! Anyways, we just need to stop trying to save you guys, cuz you don't listen anyways.  Biden 2020!!!
How is this problematic and Biden on the floor of the senate explaining his commitment to defunding social security is just politics or whatever? I don't get it.
C'mon. There won't be any debates this year, but it's not Biden who's incapable of pulling it off.
He can't make any decisions. Common here. Better say "Clintons", "Obama", "Democrats", but not Joe Biden. He is not capable of doing anything right now.
So sad to see where your priorities are when you have an election coming up!!! You are making OUR choice easier everyday! BIDEN

They would be better opponents than Biden!
Potential Biden VP Pick Praised Cult Accused of Kidnapping, Worshiping Aliens
There are some positive things here!! Trump just pissed away over 30,000,000 18-24 year old voters.... Rest assured, Biden will bring it back!!
Along with Biden, worse VP in history. What a pair. Still can't get Obama to go away. Most past Presidents don't appear in public like he does that I can recall. Just keeps popping up like Hillary. Talk about not accepting vote results, Hillary wins the blue ribbon!
I guess this means that I'm 90, no 100 percent sure that I'm voting for Biden because Trump is a fascist making me antifa!
This will only lead to Biden using Ke$ha's TikTok as a campaign theme song
He's criticizing vote by mail so his voters will vote in person and Biden voters will vote by mail. Then his minion that runs the USPS will shut down mail delivery in swing states, disenfranchising Biden voters and getting himself reelected.
Biden To Save Taxpayers Nearly 30% By Selecting Female VP  via
Ummmmmm... You didn't beat Obama. If Obama had run, he would have mopped you on the floor. And let's get real here. If Hillary had won, we wouldn't have 150,000 Americans buried! You will NOT win in November Trump! Biden is gonna mop ya on the floor.
a Gamer.... That's really the best you got? After your cult leader just proved to the world how dumb he is? If you call a President that kills 150,000 Americans someone that excels.... Rest assured, Biden will be your POTUS!

Joe Biden says Trump's failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump
She is with senile Joe Biden
The same for Biden both Obamba andBiden ware as a fact not working for America but other countries. Obama took a knee and bowed to other leaders. Trump got so much more done in first 3/1/2 yrs then they did in 8 yrs. Let‚Äôs learn from that instead of voting for the failures again
I meant elected not re-elected. Biden will be black mailed along with the rest of the Dems who are beholden. Therefore they will not represent us but China. We have to stop them.
He won‚Äôt get re-elected, Changing the subject did anyone notice how bloated her face is. Looks like alcoholism is getting her. She‚Äôll be sluring her words again and she is stark raving mad. Dems are held by money from China as you know Biden is on the hook and so are the Obamas
Eid Mubarik!! Thank you Mr. Biden for showing love during this horrific time. That is what a President does!
Seems like you owe Biden an apology.

Why Electing Joe Biden Will Make The Culture War Even Worse
*narrator voice* Biden has never touched an electronic device, let alone has any idea what they are.
Yep, nobody disagrees with that. He is unfortunately our President. An incompetent one at that. A vicious murderer that is trying to kill as many people as possible before he gets evicted. Don't worry, Biden will be your President soon!! üòÇüòÇ
Brandon!! I just call them cornflakes! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I cannot wait to tell them to get over it, and remind them that Biden is their President!!
President Trump did NOT get it right!!! I can give you 150,000 reasons why Trump got it wrong! Don't blame Biden for your mess Trump! How disrespectful to post this on the day your claimed "friend" died of it. I bet Cain is rolling in his body bag right now!
Breaking News Don!! Because of your incompetence, we have over 150,000 dead Americans, and that number is going up. Don't blame Biden fool!! Biden is not the President yet! You are! I guarantee if Biden was POTUS, he would have saved alot of lives.
Biden and Obama... Sigh.. I sure miss going to sleep not worrying about getting nuked, or dying from a pandemic! I miss being able to go to work and enjoy going out on the town on my days off. I miss not having to see friends die from the pandemic. Biden is going to win.
Nope, all your Q shit is debunked. Biden is straight gonna beat your boy hard!! Biden has nothing to worry about legally. Trump on the other hand is gonna get butt hard in prison! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Gross.
Biden's Lies for Black (and White-Privilege Guilt) Votes
Don the Con is so desperate!! He really thinks he has a chance to win in November! It's hilarious!! The desperation and fear of prison is very real for him! I'm voting to save this nation, which means I am voting for Joe Biden!
I think Joe Biden should be able to ask China, Iran, and other countries for help in the election!!! I mean, if Trump can ask for foreign assistance in an election, so should Biden! Truth is, Biden is gonna win fair and square! Even with Trump trying to cheat! Bye Don the Con!
We the people are going to win the election big time, by voting Biden in as our new President! Everyone knows you are desperate to get elected again, because the minute you leave this job, your nightmare of prison is certain. Suck it up orange buttercup! GAME OVER!!
He was a hell of a man that decided not to wear a mask, because his cult leader told he didn't have to. That was a choice he made, and it ultimately cost him his life. I guess it's safe to say most Biden voters will be alive to cast their votes on 11/3!!
Liddle' Savage!!! You rock!! You literally busted out my feelings in one simple tweet. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I'm with ya girl!!! Let's do this!!  When Biden wins, the feeling of liberation will be unreal!!!
mpiatt!! If my family needs to wheel me in a hospital bed hooked up to life support to vote.... It will be done! I will literally get in line right now to vote on 11/3! üòÇüòÇüòÇ I am voting to save this nation from Trump!   Joe Biden is going to be our new President!!
Jules!! When Biden wins, it's going to be like the 4th of July on steroids!!! I am literally going to throw a massive party!! You are welcome to come enjoy the light show!! 11/3 will be the date we hand Trump his eviction notice!!
Jules!!! I will stand in line for a month with a portable ventilator to vote this horrible idiot out of office! I will have my family wheel me in on life support to vote at this point!  Biden is going to be our next President!!! That will be liberating!
This is absolutely horrifying! We have been warned folks! If I have to stand in line for a month hooked up to a portable ventilator to vote, I will!! I refuse to allow this evil man to spend an extra day or year in that job! Vote Biden!!
Really? Biden is the moral bastion you want to hold up as an example?
Biden Goes Into Blank Stare After Forgetting Where He Is, Tries and Fails To Pass It Off as Joke
Biden Goes Into Blank Stare After Forgetting Where He Is, Tries and Fails To Pass It Off as Joke
He sees the internal polling. Repubs, as well as himself are going to get routed. So, he is going to do everything he can to try and contest the election. Do not be surprised if Biden wins be 5-10% and then Trump sues and tries to use the 12th amendment to overturn the election.
And who do you think is hiding in the Trogen horse? That‚Äôs the scary thought. What if Biden choses Pelosi for his vice. That would be a painful  out come üòÇüòÇüòÇ
That‚Äôs so fucking stupid.  No Trump supporter is putting up a Biden sign. They just wouldn‚Äôt put a sign up at all if that‚Äôs a case. Maybe they don‚Äôt all love Biden, but it definitely means they hate Trump.  Insanely naive and gullible.
Its been way obvious that yur wife doesn't like to even hold yur hand in Public,Are U jealous that Biden can have a woman on his arm!How many times did yur wife turn her head when U attempted to kiss her? On camera no less!!
I'm no fan of either Kamala Harris or Joe Biden, so trading on the currency of not wanting to be "offensive" or "unhelpful" is laughable.
This makes me want to vote for Biden twice.
Biden was polling at 5.4% before the IA caucus, and then dropped out after placing fifth, behind Clinton, Obama, Edwards, and Bill Richardson.
That's not historically how it has worked though, and setting up new rules for a certain candidate to fail at is biased. Joe Biden himself was selected for the VP after withdrawing after the IA caucus in 2008. Probably polling poorly, which is why he didn't want to go on to NH.
That‚Äôs a silver alert.  Biden is looking for Amber.

It is and was not a hoax! The evidence is overwhelming! Y'all are some cult crazy lunatics!!! Don't worry though! You will have Biden as your President soon!!

You go girl, hope to see more of you for a long time to come!  BLM BIDEN 2020!Tim for Biden to announce his VP pick
Sorry, no clarification needed. He stepped in it once again. For pity's sake, Biden is in mid-stage dementia. He needs to retire. This Dem trainwreck of a candidate is painful to watch, &amp; I am even a Trump supporter.
The sirens should be going off yet all is silent.  We have observed Biden and have concluded he would be sliced and diced in a Debate.  THE DNC &amp; BIDEN CAMPAIGN KNOW IT TOO  So WHY did they agree to 3 Debates starting in December?  WHAT do they have planned BEFORE SEPTEMBER?
Yeah, we will once Biden is POTUS!
Odd that the Democrat base sat at home and let all the Democrats you don't approve of vote for, and thereby select,  Joe Biden
Omg make this pay-per-view and take my money please oh sweet baby Biden-hurting Jesus, make this a thing.
If elected Biden will stab God in the eye with a sharp stick
You are lost and as such your opinion means little. You stand with anti Semitic Marxists and think you are on a path to victory... Throw in Biden and then throw in the Anarchists and the ANTIFA??? No wonder you are lost and why you will lose.
We now have to figure out what the DEMS &amp; DNC are up to before September. The DNC agreed to 3 Debates in September. YOU have seen Biden the last few days and know he has lost it. THEY KNOW IT TOO! So WHY did they agree unless they knew something was happening before those dates?
Biden already has my vote, man. Trump doesn't need to keep selling me on him....
E N E R G Y.  Biden is against energy.   Biden should use this in a campaign ad, lol. I'm not even mad. This is amazing.
Lol Trump thinks Biden can destroy God, Guns, and even  E N E R G Y.  Biden must be powerful af.
Economy?    he said light bulbs made him look orange, people didn‚Äôt have water for showers before he was president.  Said Biden would take away god and the church.    He is out of his god damn mind
I think this is fair, considering what they've been up to with money shenanigans. But... bad timing for Biden, since it'll be more "deMoCraTs aRe cOminG foR yEr gUns!!!"
I say Biden called prez at 8pm pacific
Yep people Still not figured out that Biden is not Clinton
If Biden is an atheist he has my vote!
..And..Are we surprised? Biden is a train wreck.
Also Biden is not Clinton and this human pile of trash has not ruined America in the last 3 years
Do you realize it means Biden‚Äôs gonna win only by like 20 points now
You think by opening your disgusting mouth you are going to win over voters. Apparently you haven't watched your interviews. Biden will destroy you
Yeah, the mayor should‚Äôve resigned. not for racism and sexism, but for thinking Babylon Bee is real
Trump 300 mill  Biden 295 mill   He caught him in 122 days.
Have they figured out that Biden is not Clinton?
Man you Trump ü§° believe anything.  Biden has agreed to the 3 debates, Trump has not.  Go crank  your tin foil hat up to 11
Biden will look like a chicken if he doesn‚Äôt debate
Biden should debate. As with Hillary, Trump will look and act like a fool and it won‚Äôt matter to Trump‚Äôs supporters
aren‚Äôt all of those things on biden‚Äôs side happening in america right now? how is it biden‚Äôs america when it‚Äôs happening while trump is in office. you probably think obama did 9/11
Why we have known what a pile of trash Trump is now for nearly 5 years vs Biden not being a pile of trash for 50.
So Biden will only win Colorado by 22% now, got it
Have these GOP operatives figured out yet that Biden is not Clinton and there‚Äôs a pandemic and Trump is done nothing to stop in six months?
Aside from BLM being a MARXIST organization? Try  the Communist party endorsing the Biden Campaign yesterday. How about another laugh?
Lol.. I'll trade you :D
The cat is out of the bag..
Lol.. HERE is the real reason they won't let him out.. Counting on a Debate? No chance..
Seen THIS James? I can't stop laughing.
2016 was the tipping point in my allegiance to the Republican Party. This fall I will be voting Biden because the values that the Republicans used to stand for are gone, replaced by fear-mongering, self-service, and the dismantling of vital democratic institutions. #LincolnVoter
Biden always rejects truth. Apparently, it's in his DNA.
Biden is winning, the end
tRump would make a big deal of it, you know. They *should* debate just so people can see the clear difference between someone who speaks in full sentences and is coherent with actual plans (that would be Biden), and someone who only has a vocabulary of about 200 words (tRump).
I just found out that joe biden was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania and idk everything just makes so much sense now.
R's swept in formerly tight WA Congressional races.  is not getting the left enthused to vote in areas that matter. Because he's a moderate Republican of yore.
By "relax" ( appologies!!) I meant that Kamala is by far the best choice, Biden is going to pick her, and that's just the way it is.   All the excitement and drama in the world ain't gonna change that outcome   PS: She will be President in 2025  For real
Biden doesn't have to debate - he's winning.  Trump, on the other hand.... needs to resign.
So, you love Barack Obama, but hold a level of animosity against Joe Biden?
Must be be why Trump is trying to set up the fact he is going to lose and never leave office by trying to suppress the vote.   Biden is kicking his ass even winning every poll in Texas.
You see the new California poll   Biden 69 Trump 28   It won‚Äôt matter
People who aren‚Äôt inspired by Joe Biden
Fact about Joe Biden: He‚Äôs so dumb, he plagerized and ranked 75th out of 85 graduates
2 states Biden has no chance to win lol
This is true! No Biden lawn signs, nor bumper stickers, etc, anywhere in Central Washington State. Recall Inslee!!
Yes be honest here, this was a phone call: Joe Biden: hey,mis this Bernie Sanders? Bernie: Joe, it‚Äôs Yom Kippur Joe Biden: ok, Yom, can I get Bernie‚Äôs endorsement?
Still plenty of Bernie people out there urging people to not vote for Biden
Took me a sec to realize you weren‚Äôt advocating playing bass with a pick, which Joe Biden absolutely would do.
Pro Tip: Biden isn‚Äôt Clinton, people didn‚Äôt vote for her on purpose
The Biden‚Äôs will love it when they move in on Jan 20th
It‚Äôs just a hunch but I think we are going to know Biden is the winner at 8 PM Pacific time
The Biden‚Äôs will love it
Biden has nothing to do with Clinton. The only they have in common is their political party.
Markets have already crashed and jobs already lost you toadstool.  If you would watch ACTUAL news instead of FOX, you'd already know this.  Hopefully Biden will be able to fix all the damage you've done to this country.
I was just commenting to my husband that I haven't  seen one Biden sign or Bumper sticker. He hadn't either. We have seen a lot of flags though.  :-)
Well I certainly had a different choice but the voters picked Biden and he's a solid choice considering the alternative   With Harris as a VP I start getting excited
Yeah.  Biden will.  You screwed it up like everything else you touch...
Biden is not a rational man.
You're worried that celebs are out of touch so you don't want to vote Biden and instead you want to VOTE FOR THE REALITY TV CELEBRITY CON MAN WHO RAN BEAUTY PAGENTS. Biden out of touch with normal Americans, vs Trunp living in a tower with his name on it and golden toilets. Lol.

The FACT that Trump is showing signs of utter desperation makes perfect sense that he'd USE ANYONE in order to defeat Joe Biden.. West has a mental disorder which he REFUSES to control with prescribed medications. Therefore, like Trump, West is mentally unfit for the presidency.
Several things. Indictments of the Obama/Biden administration. Biden‚Äôs obvious dementia. Democrats connection with Antifa. Trump voter enthusiasm. Rebounding economy and the great economy before Covid.

Here's how trump's batshit craziness will be confirmed without doubt by the entire world......  He steps onto a debate stage with Joe Biden Not the debate itself, but the decision to do it.
I take outrageous claims made on Stern's show with a grain of salt.  If there was actually video of Trump walking in on teenagers in their dressing rooms, like there's videos of Biden repeatedly getting touchy-feely with kids and young women, I'd be more willing to believe it.

I agree we need to stand with employees and working poor, not the military industrial complex. Unfortunately both parties have candidates that do not agree! You would have made a great President but Biden and Trump both will make lousy presidents we need new leadership.
These people are McCain and Bush staffers, both of whom were horrible monsters. However, it is personally advantageous for them to have that type of monster in power instead of our current one, and Biden is the best fit for their ideology.
Careful with these Lincoln Project guys. They are conservative operators who expect to be granted entry into the Biden sphere of influence. This pushes what we call "the left" even further right than it already is.
Also notable in here, while Biden is planning to make up his mind next week, announcement may not be until the week after that.

Biden wins Florida game over
How does he plan to be re-elected with a 32% approval rating and dropping fast?  Biden's ahead 16 points in the polls. And that gap is widening.  It's going to be a wipe out for both Trump and the GOP this November.
John Durham is going to indict big names in the Obama/Biden administration. Your silly projections can‚Äôt stop it.
Did he commit treason, like Obama/Biden?
Sure, now that Beto O'Rourke is out of the running.  Even so, Biden has made remarks similar to his.

We miss you President Obama !! Please help us , seeing and listening to you give us hope , please campaign with Vice President Biden we need you more than ever , Thank you üòä
Once Biden‚Äôs win is confirmed, the Marshals will escort him out the door to the awaiting paddy wagon from New York, with the NYAG standing by, a smile on her üëÑüòùü§™üòèüòé
Didn‚Äôt Biden say he wanted a VP that could be ready to go on day 1?   Wouldn‚Äôt her drive and ambition fit that description?
Yeah... in case nobody told you, trump inherited both the economy and unemployment numbers Obama. He then proceeded to run it straight into the ground. Now we‚Äôre here. #Biden #Biden2020 #ObamaSpeaking #ObamaIsBetterAtEverything
This is a campaign rally and a time to lie about Biden!  He wants voter ID...I gave my ID when I registered to vote!  They send me my ballot because I am registered!  He is stupid!  Btw wasn‚Äôt this a coronavirus briefing?  ü§î
Maybe he caught what Biden‚Äôs got. Lol
Ok. Here you go. Biden in a landslide.  Thanks for your participation.

Heroic China to prevent Trump reelection, while evil Russia conspires to screw Biden over, reports CNN
Seriously, are you even American?  Do you not understand the fundamental and existential threat to democracy that is Trump and his followers?  JFC, I would crawl over broken glass soaked in covid juice to vote for Biden and I really don't like him.
If he wants to establish the president that a POTUS can simply issue funding via EOs (contrary to the Constitution) I look forward to what President Biden can do with that.  (evil grin)
Biden must want everyone to know he‚Äôs racist. If not, he‚Äôs demonstrating a lack of capacity.
A friend in San Diego (!) said that this is about where he's at with the Biden campaign, which really drove the point home.  Candidates need to get their shit together.
but sure let's get another two weeks of stories about biden's vp selection intrigue, that's definitely going to cover rent for over 10M americans in less than three weeks.
Anyone divisive enough to think Biden doesn't "deserve" their vote? Seriously. Our only hope in this hell trump &amp; the gopers gave us, is all votes for Joe.
and this isn't even getting to russian interference and active sabotage by comey and barr!  trump is DEFUNDING THE POST OFFICE and ppl are STILL pretending that all biden needs is a good ad buy from the lincoln project
Biden wants to cut SS &amp; would veto M4A if he got a bipartisan bill. He put in jail non-violent  offenders &amp; won‚Äôt legalize cannabis. Income inequality, prison population, grew under his watch. No real environmental policy despite evidence of climate change. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
But of course Biden can say Blacks aren‚Äôt diverse and Hispanics are and CNN is chill #raceBaiting
Yep. That‚Äôs what this is boiling down to for me as well.  I‚Äôd rather fight Biden than trump. As I will be fighting either one of them.
I don‚Äôt think it is the same thing. One, Russia, is actually doing this with tRump and GOP help. China and Iran are not in bed with Biden. Vastly different.
HURT BIBLE! HURT GOD! BIDEN BAD!  The president is a caveman.
That was the goal of  but ended up as another organization supporting Biden.  I don‚Äôt see any libertarian and green representatives. So clearly not going for the full spectrum. Just trying to appease the left.
if biden loses ppl will blame BIDEN as if under any kind of fair contest trump wouldnt lose to like, air bud  this isn't a fair fight, but all the pundits keep pretending biden needing to override 40 years of voter suppression and gaming the electoral college is abt *messaging*
Trump just won the election!!! This is the campaign Ad that won it. Bye Bye Biden!!!
I asked a similar question to a devout Christian. I heard back, defensively, that ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt vote for him to lead my church‚Äù. This person said he was still better than Obama and Biden. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Delusion. Biden is not even close. Stop falling for media narratives. They've been pushing this line, and failing, for weeks. It has never been accurate which is why it refuses to catch hold.
and let me be super clear on this, i'm not relitigating 2016 out of anything other than a desire to see ppl be honest abt the next 87 days  if biden gets the landslide win predicted, it will be bc trump has become SO toxic his unpopularity overrides the gop's baked in advantage
Biden Mocks Trump Citing Arizona As Model. Arizona Gov Rips Biden: ‚ÄòCome On Man! Get Out Of Your Basement‚Äô
He's been a top surrogate for the campaign since the beginning of the primary. If Biden wanted to stop him from sticking his foot in his mouth to the press, he could.
Americans know who you are at your core, and we‚Äôre going to elect Joe Biden to remove your racist stench from the Oval Office ... #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Maybe Biden shouldn‚Äôt have spent the last forty years setting the stage for him, then? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I‚Äôd rather have questions about policy and how Joe Biden‚Äôs healthcare proposals are going to cover Americans during a time of mass pandemic and unemployment.   But trivia questions about the candidates relationship with their imaginary friend is important too I guess. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Apparently Biden's dog is named Major, and it is perhaps a prosecutable offense if they are not releasing regular updates regarding this good dog, preferably in his voice, titled "Major News"
I have many political issues with Biden, but I‚Äôve always admired him as a person for how he coped with his stutter. I don‚Äôt talk about mine much (because it‚Äôs my business and no one else‚Äôs), but he hits the nail on the head here.
I think it‚Äôs sexist for Biden to limit his VP picks to only women anyway. It harkens back to Romney‚Äôs #BindersFullOfWomen. And it implies that a woman couldn‚Äôt be VP if competing against men.  It‚Äôs fucked up that this is the not-so-subtle message that Biden is broadcasting.
You could tell that Biden's climate policies were a joke well before they were ever published, but when he leaned into regime change in Venezuela, a goal of the oil industry, and said fracking jobs weren't on the table it became dumb to even pretend like he'd be good on climate.
You do realize the worst thing you ever say about Joe Biden is that you call him sleepy, right? Take a look at the plethora of awful and accurate things people call you.
Now the R's are trying to siphon the support for Biden by attempting to get Kabye West on the ballot. When D's flip the Senate, impeach Donny again and convict him and throw him out of the White House. Donny can spend the rest of his PATHETIC life fighting lawsuits
Vote for Biden.
Ummm. If trump thinks a presidential election can ‚Äòhurt God,‚Äô he fundamentally misunderstands the concept of God. For him, religion is just something he pretends to believe in for political advantage. Believe or don‚Äôt believe, but don‚Äôt lie about it

Wouldn't it be something if the supporters of Kayne really were people abandoning tRump! And had no effect on Biden - tRump needs to loose by a landslide - he failed all of us~  #TrumpLoser #VoteBiden
When are the Biden deepfakes coming? October?
People who make lists like this think bad Lefty is anyone who doesn‚Äôt put a Biden sign in their yard.
Yes. Just one of the reasons: the GOP work hard getting rid of polling stations in areas they predict Biden votes, just to make this scenario real. #WeWillVote #Biden2020
No, what am I listening to on OPB right now? A bit on Biden's comments on race!?! Ok OPB, give trump equal time ü§£ everytime tRump says anything stupid about race give him that much coverage - 10 mins a day?!?!! Journalist DO BETTER!
What percent of Americans think Biden will be alive come November 3rd?
I dont disagree with your statement on 45. I find him to be very revolting in nearly every aspect. I just hate how people then become blinded to how horrible Biden is as well . Idk where people got the idea i liked trump...
Biden and whoever in 2020 and then we‚Äôll slap back in 2024.
‚ÄúThere is a lot of room in there for oil and gas,‚Äù - Matt Gallagher, pres. of Parsley Energy, West Texas oil producer, after getting a peak at Biden‚Äôs #energy plan.
Take time to break it down. Even if you're convinced that we have to replace Trump with Biden there is room for Green voters.
I simply don't agree with that characterization of Biden, he generally handles questions just fine.
And Biden just started opposing the Hyde Amendment in June of last year as he was planning another presidential run, he doesn't give a shit about abortion.
Biden is proposing a return to the Obama era tax rates, taxes that were already significantly lower than those we enjoyed under famed far leftie Ronald Reagan.
If Biden wins, I predict CNN will continue to talk about Trump for the next 4 years.
Sure we will. If we get the Greens to 5% we get matching funds. We pressure the Democratic Party to move left. Biden and Trump aren't the only options, and many votes in "safe" states will be wasted on them, when people could vote Green instead.
Yes, really, he's dealt in nepotism during his entire career in politics, and has taken cash for things like helping elect Republicans since he was VP.
Wow, it's almost like this is why the left really didn't want Biden.  Its almost like we wanted someone who wasn't a renown liar with skeletons in the closet.  Its almost like we remember 2016.  Its almost like BIDEN ISNT THE MOST ELECTABLE CANDIDATE.
'US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election' here:
Damn Whoopi Goldberg and Joe Biden ended Apartheid? That's crazy I had no idea
Russia could hack Biden's campaign and the medias response will be "Why are the dem campaigns so easy to go after? Whats wrong with them?" or "are they in too much disarray?"
since this tweet had like 450 likes and counting I'd like to take this opportunity to tell everyone that even though he's awful and I hate him, you should vote for Biden because no matter how bad he is, he would've handled the past several months better, and you fucking know it.
I personally can‚Äôt wait for the debates...all the people saying Joe Biden can‚Äôt get through a sentence obviously haven‚Äôt been following along. He has ALWAYS gaffed, but he‚Äôs not an incoherent moron like Trump. Biden will crush him as long as he keeps his cool.
Trump aides frustrated by his ‚Äònonsensical‚Äô Biden attacks in Ohio: AP reporter
Same. I really wish more people in solid blue states would abstain from voting Biden. Hilary stans really clung to that 3 mil popular vote after she lost and I feel awful that I contributed to that number.
As a conservative, I must say that this is no longer something to smile about. You are facilitating husband abuse, Jill Biden! STOP IT.
As much as i'm not enthusiastic with Biden, I at least can feel reassured that the american left in 2020 didn't make the mistake the German left did in 1932.
Imagine how the person's hair smells.  That's how Biden is going to choose.  Then again, a bucket of shit is smarter than Joe Biden.
Bernie supporters don't think that about Tulsi. They just don't like her for endorsing Joe Biden. Especially since he stands for everything she's against!
If Biden was President, it would probably take a month.  Suck it up buttercup.
In caveman voice: Hurt god. hurt Bible. Biden bad.
Biden said he won‚Äôt even take a test, and then couldn‚Äôt complete a sentence at the end of making his statement on why he wouldn‚Äôt take the test ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Nina is just the best. Wish she was the VP. That‚Äôd go a ways towards Biden‚Äôs hemorrhaging of leftie support.
He's also, worse, imo, actively being negligent and just killing civilians. He's so unfit, he's criminally unfit. Biden may prove to be unfit, but he's also trying to be better, and already has succeeded. Donaldo just is selfish and weak willed. Worst American president!
Oh  I want to thank you so much. I've been a bit down today, since  is still occupying OUR Whitehouse, but seeing this gave me the best belly laugh I've had in months.   Thanks so much for the comedy relief.    2020
Every time he opens his mouth he says something racist, classist, or just plain stupid. He's taken positions to the right of Trump on numerous foreign policy issues.  He's barely coherent, and when he does make sense, what he says is offensive. Biden is #BlueMAGA nothing more.
Hah, and there are legions of people who think the virus response is going to be significantly different under Biden.
Every time I see someone post about ‚ÄúBiden/Rice‚Äù I have to take a moment to breathe and consciously reassure myself they‚Äôre talking about Susan Rice and not Condoleezza. Because Condoleezza would be a really believable choice at this point.
Who's really in the bunker?!  Biden... but they run that rhetoric about Trump locked in the basement of the White House...   oops!
Huh? Stray Y chromosome? Like Biden dropped his Y off? I don't get it, what was the question again??? Those are not my shoes....cabbage, never played it before...prunes? where did I get prunes? no, it was a VW bus, on fire, chasing a horse down one of those Seattle like hills...y
I'M BAFFLED! So we're going to wait till Jan, hoping Biden gets elected, before anybody does anything!?!? At least 150,000 ppl that didn't have to die die!?! This is a F'ing emergency! There has to be some kind of emergency action, al la Navy doctor overrides the ships captain?
No. But we can laugh at Biden for being racist though..
#2020Elections #Biden, No one likes anyone telling us what we think and what we are.
Let us not forget that Joe Biden was a single dad for 5 years too!
FOCUS: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand in the Way of a Trump Prosecution I totally disagree with Uncle Joe ! A prosecution of a criminal President is exactly what democracy demands ! We‚Äôve had 2 Treasonous presidents pardoned for their ‚Äú High Crimes ‚Äú already
What happens when Biden starts botching his speeches‚Ä¶reverse fake news
The Black turnout for Biden has to be one of the most searing indictments of white supremacy I can think of.  Blacks voted for Biden because they knew whites would be *most likely* to support the most racist candidate in the field. And it‚Äôs an astoundingly accurate calculation.
Kanye Admits His Presidential Bid Will Take Votes Away From Biden: ‚ÄòI'm Not Denying It‚Äô
US Intelligence officials: Russia denigrating Joe Biden ahead of election
On the right, we have a bucket of runny shit. On the left, a decent choice. But S.E. won't abandon her bucket of shit unless Biden is perfect. People like that are called Shy Republicans. They don't want to see the disgust their choice produces, so they pretend to be persuadable.
Could‚Äôve had a candidate that was genuinely doing well with Latino voters  because he cared instead of relying on a Contra death squad supporting republican to sway them with an endorsement.
The difference is that Biden would never even contemplate taking help from China to win whereas we know how ‚ÄúRussia, if you‚Äôre listening‚Äù Trump would react.
Oh wow. Thank you! I think that's my first ever  üòä
of all things I am I am a Marine. I don't pull the uniform on anymore at 04, but it is still in me, and I see so many wrongs. how can a democrat sit and know Americans will be slaughtered like animals by animals? I can't grasp the concept and not apologizing for it either f Biden
I feel like i'm on PINS and NEEDLESS every time he speaks. Yes, it's unfair Trump can say whatever he wants and gets away with it but I cannot be holding my breath every time Biden gives an interview.
As a latino, I do not support this couple. They should be ashamed of themselves. They very well know Trump doesn‚Äôt support them yet they support him. Also their ad is trash. They just say Biden is going to be a bad leader, that‚Äôs it! Superficial attacks not worth your time.
Oh boy Putin, you got caught with your hand in the cookie jar didn't you? And we're going to everything we can to make Biden win, and then, you're gonna get slapped like the dwarf bitch you are. And I'll tell you what, your pet troll  is not going to enjoy this.
Please. Who knows when it was taken down and why. Also, why would she still have a 2020 store when Biden's been the nominee for months?  Furthermore, if she's agreed to a cabinet position it would be a different reason to shut it down.
Serious question: Trump is a racist who sexually assaults women. Biden is a racist who sexually assaults women.   How can Russia, China, or Iran possibly make them look any worse as candidates?
Joe Biden needs to commit to this before I vote for him. Day one, close down detention centers Period.
Data ALSO hypothesis "Trump voters won't admit being Trump voters to a live pollster," which, if true, would lead to Biden underperforming live polls, and slightly underperforming or matching computer/robo polls  But we're skeptical of that since it's been wrong many times
Biden smears himself, we‚Äôre just keeping tabs. #BlueDevolution is making fascism real again.
If joe biden could actually hurt god, like cause physical pain and misery to god, I would vote for him twice. Once via mail and once in person.
Biden! Can! Be! Pushed! Left!
Is that why when I bring up his terrible record and weak policies, liberals call me a Russian asset? Putin didn't make Biden do all those bad things. They are just exploiting his weaknesses.
People will do anything to steer votes away from Biden. However, I reeeeally doubt anyone voting to Kanye would be voting for Biden in the first place.
Sigh... Men tell women what they should or shouldn't say is not a good look.   Also his race is relevant. He is a high profile black celebrity. His race and celebrity are being used to siphon black voters from Biden.
I'm like just now seeing the Joe Biden gaffe and it kind of feels like conservatives are trying their hardest to make a huge deal out of this. You can talk to me when BLM protests aren't being tear gassed anymore.
His job is to raise stock prices. If stock prices are going up, he wins. My guess is that the Trump mob is cooking the books on the economic numbers, because they know if there's a stock market crash, Biden wins and the GOP loses the Senate.
The only things denigrating Biden are his record and the garbage leaving his mouth.
joe biden is absolutely dead. we have not seen or heard anything from him directly the dnc is covering it up that man is seriously deceased
They're not just random individuals though, they are people that Biden has chosen to elevate. I agree with Armando, the headline is sensationalistic (and probably not written by Traister) but the content is spot-on.
are you saying sniffing little girls is joe biden's right &amp; not his privilege?
Something I‚Äôve been thinking about re: online influence campaigns is that won‚Äôt they eventually cancel each other out in their influence? If China wants no Trump and Russian wants no Biden, their efforts will appear organic and have no more influence than if they hadn‚Äôt meddled.
Biden‚Äôs public appearances have sure quieted the voices of centrist democrats that have been dragging Sanders and his supporters since March.  Buyers remorse?
Biden doesn't support defunding police. Ask any Portland Protester.
I hope you aren‚Äôt voting for Biden then.
Trump paraded a lying little pissant in front of the country who mislead and caused a total US shutdown. And now he‚Äôs pushing hard for a fast track vaccine. That bothers me. Biden bothers me more so I‚Äôll vote trump but doesn‚Äôt it trouble your soul a little?
Dude, you're the one saying "minorities wont' vote for Biden." I'm just going on the terminology you're using.
Every time Joe Biden comes out of the basement for an interview, why can't he just be chill and not say racially loaded things? He and his handlers have to know that Trump is losing this election all by himself and Biden should just keep his mouth shut but he can't help it.
Minorities overwhelmingly backed Biden, you lying tool.   I'm not telling you how to vote. You can throw away your vote all you want.  But I am telling you that attacking Biden pre-election only serves to help Trump. This doesn't bother you, of course. You want Trump reelected.
The Democrats have also been suppressing the vote. You‚Äôre not going to get progressive policy from Biden, and you‚Äôre not going to get voting rights from a party that tries to take candidates off the ballot unilaterally.
You forgot Reagan, GW and HW Bush.   But I agreed, Clinton and Biden‚Äôs criminal justice choices were horrendous.
Biden wants to cut SS Biden would veto M4A if he got a bipartisan bill. Biden put in jail many non-violent  offenders and won‚Äôt legalize cannabis.  Those are Biden‚Äôs ambitions.
You're beating a dead horse:   Voting for Biden is a given. It's not an argument. You're trying to create a division where there is none.   We need to talk about what we want, focus on people who will represent us, like  and PUSH corporate DEM's to do the right thing.
lmao you're so fucking mad about being called out on your enabling fascists  again: do all the fucking criticism of biden you want starting the day after the election. Until then, you're just helping Trump
Stop trying to fuck over Biden
I'd be absolutely intrigued to meet a real human being who, a month ago, was done with Trump and was ready to vote for Biden, and then over the course of the past 30 days thought, "Wait, I changed my mind. I like what Trump has been doing lately, and I want 4 more years."
Every white or brown person I know is voting for Biden.
Undermining the only alternative to Trump *is* helping him.  Again: Shut up until November 4, and I'll believe you. But until then, undermining Biden is helping Trump win.
Theory: pollsters nervous about underestimating Trump and being blamed for being "wrong again". They consciously or unconsciously put finger on the scale for Trump.   Worse pollsters have a bigger effect  If true, we'd expect Biden to beat polls in Nov  Can't know until then
President Biden and Congress will be busy, working to repair the damage from this Republican regime.
The vetting is not even close. One has literally walked through the fire of a presidential campaign. The other has not. No one energizes the Democratic Party like Harris. Biden can win with anyone but if he wants to win the house and senate he should pick Harris.
The minorities/poor people who overwhelmingly voted for Biden in the primary, you mean?   How about you shut up until after the election then? And on Nov 4 resume all the criticism you want?  (You won't, since your objective is to make Biden lose / Trump win, of course)
Nope. Joe Biden will build a great admin and HRC would‚Äôve been a really great President !!
Completely agree! I also have a child‚Äôs vision about how politics work and can‚Äôt discern between obvious differences in ideology! You and I are exactly the same! Just like Biden and trump!
Can't wait for all the righteous indignation to erupt when Biden announces his running mate.
idk fam it sounds like you and I agree more on the immorality of billionaires than Joe Biden and I ever will
lmao you'd think that biden supporters would want to FORGET his 1988 campaign
And compared to Biden and Trump, he is easily, clearly the most mentally cognitively capable. He is literally the only one of the three actually capable of doing the job of president!
Yep. It's clear Biden's fixers have reworded and walked back his original comments. Easy to see when you compare what he says unscripted versus what is printed afterwards. What a joke!
You can't even see what's in that photo. Was that picture taken with a potato?  But here is a clear picture of Biden and his KKK buddy.   Leave the memes to the right and we'll leave the lies and insults to the left. Deal?
I would swim in Covid-infested waters and crawl across broken glass to vote for Joe Biden on Nov. 3.   Oh. But I don‚Äôt have to.  I live in Oregon, where we have vote-by-mail for EVERYONE.

I agree with u. Don‚Äôt mean I want trump, but Biden has a hidden agenda who knows wtf he on
Biden has a stutter. Otherwise no different from the rest of the political establishment.
I'm not worried about West taking votes from Joe Biden. If I were a Black person I'd be very insulted by all of the people worrying about West. Black people are far too intelligent to fall for West or trump (who is üíØ% behind what West is doing I promise you). Calm down sister.
But - I would not trust him to actually leave And I don‚Äôt want Republicans against Trump to switch their votes from Biden to Pence.
Biden attends Mass &amp; takes communion, like many other American Catholics who violate Church doctrine on certain matters, such as contraception. The Right has cafeteria Catholics, too, who consider themselves devout, but, e.g., support the death penalty. Not our job to judge.
Biden could pick Angela Davis as his VP nominee and it wouldn‚Äôt be enough to mask his innate racism, which is deeply encoded into almost every strand of his political DNA.
Just a thought, if Trump's poll numbers are in the tank weeks before the election, does he replace Pence with Nikki Haley?  Especially if Biden picks a very dynamic woman for VP. #Biden2020 #2020election #trump
Yea I‚Äôve been trying to make my husband legal for years. It‚Äôs so expensive and now he‚Äôs finally towards the end where he has to go back to his country and I don‚Äôt trust Trump that he could come back. Biden please fix it so he doesn‚Äôt have to leave us.
Because he‚Äôs deliberately trying to take votes away from Joe Biden
As an avid anti establishment and Biden Critic, I strongly recommend reviewing the records of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Biden isn‚Äôt at all perfect, nor am I a fan, but both records prove that Trump is focused on leadership from the past. Biden is not. #Biden2020 #NotmeUs
the point is that he is the current elected president of the United States. Never said I liked Biden either.

It should be possible for Biden to appoint staff to follow up on the crimes and corruption of the Trump administration without appearing to be partisan.
WaPo Fact-Checker Who Said Joe Biden Didn't Say What He Said Gets Debunked Hours Later - by Biden

Are you fucking kidding me? Biden could pick a wet rock for all I care. Trump is 100% dangerous so VP pick is meaningless. Why would you ever give Trump any chance by writing in? This is no game anymore.
We can see with our own eyes that Biden isn't well; we should have compassion for him.  My compassion may have to wait until AFTER he stops acting a fool and being a tool to help Trump get re-elected.  Remember Hillary Clinton and the damage she did.  Have compassion for America!

Wouldn't put it past them to run obvious hacking propaganda campaigns to make it look like China is meddling in our elections on Trump's behalf to create another 'asset' narrative as a means to embolden more votes against him, since they know Biden is far more pro-China.
Governor Whitmer has an approval rating of 57%.  Biden is leading Trump by 11 points .  We can do this #Michigan! #DemCastMI
I will vote for Biden no matter who he picks as anyone is better than 45 and group.
Trump said Biden ‚Äòhurt God.‚Äô Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith.        TRUMP LACKS CHARACTER.  HE‚ÄôS NOTHING BUT A LYING, AMORAL LOSER.
I don't know a single Republican voting for Biden. I occasionally heard such but never heard an actual person say that. Seems like only Democrat shills would say that to make us think Biden is winning. Trump will win in landslide. No question.
It almost doesn't matter- best to ignore this spoiler for Biden.  Target demographic for KW is the "disenfranchised extreme left"as a protest vote- but he doesn't have any real plans or policy, just noise and distractions.
Oh yeah, I remember how Biden pushed for the death penalty for the Central Park Five by taking out a full page in a major publication, all who were wrongly accused and jailed. And the litigation for viloatng the Fair Housing Act.  Oh wait, that was Trump, the pillar of diversity
Watching Dems bickering about Biden‚Äôs VP pick is like listening to siblings quarrel and I‚Äôm about to put some of you in a time out.
I see what you did there, trying to prop up Kanye thinking it will take Black votes from Biden.   Everyone knows Kanye has literally 0% chance of winning and would only be a worthless protest vote.
I like Felix‚Äôs assessment of the 2020 election choices in latest Chapo episode: we are at the end of American imperial hegemony. Bernie was a negotiated withdrawal, Donald Trump is belligerent denial of reality, and and Joe Biden is beaten acceptance with nostalgia for good times
Yup, when Trump went to church, gassed protesters, and forced our top Military General into a terrible photo shoot to help satisfy his ego, that was it! Forced me to consider Biden!
Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‚Äòbasement‚Äô   STUNNING BIT OF PROJECTION FROM ‚ÄúBUNKER BOY‚Äù TRUMP, SQUATTING INSIDE HIS BUBBLE AND REFUSING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM KNOWLEDGEABLE REPORTERS

Joe Biden sucks, and is awful. (still voting for him)
Vote for Joe Biden
I‚Äôm no Biden cape by any stretch (cuz he‚Äôs ALWAYS saying stupid/racist shit), but that Latino/Black clip is being taken completely out of context.
Yeah I think voting for Biden is bad strategy, but I'm not about to tell someone who is doing it because they're scared of the fash that it's a bad idea.  I get it, it's a legitimate reason.
Oregon isn't turning red... But there is no excitment for Biden like there was for Hillary here...
And here I thought we were talking about Biden.
Geezus - Miller is a JEW.  I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre voting for Biden if you stand against racism üò°
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. I‚Äôm Mexican so my family is full of old Catholics. They alll believe these charges. (!!) Joe Biden‚Äôs team SHOULD fact-check all this! Should have a priest explain that the Catholic faith requires us to honor our God and religion OURSELVES, not bc of a law.
People need to be put to sleep then.
So who is running against Trump on the democratic side? Biden thinks he has a chance? Unreal.
Damn, this comment's gotta be the most racist thing I've seen since the last time Joe Biden spoke.
Ouch.
I came across an account today that follows &amp; reposts both rose &amp; MAGA feeds, uses sexist &amp; racist language, &amp; claims Biden is not ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù enough. I went to block the presumed Bot &amp; found he has over 3,000 followers. If that ain‚Äôt proof our educational system needs help...
If Trump would shut up for a few hours, Biden gaffs would get more traction. Biden has always been gaff-prone. It seems Biden can say anything because all anyone wants to hear is the latest bs from Trump.
Biden is such a sleepy weakling he can hurt god...
Joe Biden and Clarify, in the same sentence?  That‚Äôs an oxymoron!
Bernie would have at least been able to say I tried and the house democrats and senators stopped me, so we need to replace some of them, Biden will be working in lockstep with house dems and the senate to do nothing.
People hate Trump, and in combination with the pandemic that's likely enough for this election, but structural problems in American lives aren't going away and once Trump is no longer around to blame, that blame is going to fall on Biden and other Democrats if they don't deliver.
This is an incredibly articulate statement. I‚Äôm not a big Biden fan at all. I‚Äôd prefer Kamala as the nominee for President ( or the dream of  ) but I will crawl over glass to vote for Biden. Trump is that dangerous and even more for minorities.
We'll see, Democrats got their asses kicked in 2010 after running on big meaningful change and then delivering a GOP healthcare plan.  Biden isn't even pretending that he's anything other than Obama's third term.
Joe Biden was baptized Catholic, but his actions and voting record say otherwise.
Surely both of these smart capable women will be in a Biden administration one way or another... If I were choosing it would be Harris/VP and Rice /SOS or NSA...
Is that why Biden is more popular with college educated voters? Also are you somehow being classis and racist by assuming Blacks and Hispanics aren't college educated?  Do you have a diagnosis? I mean that with actual concern.
Now he‚Äôs just stringing together random trigger words. Joe Biden is against God? And can hurt Him? Wow. And no religion, too.

Honestly, watching Biden repeatedly put his foot in his mouth &amp; coast through his campaign, I think there‚Äôs a high possibility Trump will be re-elected. He‚Äôs awful and dangerous but Biden offers us so little. I‚Äôm voting Biden but I‚Äôll never forgive the DNC for foisting him on us.
"Ana" not "Anna"  "Team Biden" not "Team Obama"  Do better.
This is pretty clearly not referring to every Biden voter as blue maga. It‚Äôs specifically about Biden voters who are claiming Clinton lost because of Stein or some such nonsense.
Also, a man who is using a mentally unstable man (Kanye) to try to manipulate the Black community into voting for him.  It‚Äôs not going to work.  Trump is a racist.  Joe Biden is a good and decent man.
Is he trying to lose his base to Biden?
Biden is the dead cactus. That‚Äôs exactly why the VP pick matters. I believe Joe to be ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù enough to actually pick a Republican Woman as his VP thus handing the presidency to team R when he resigns due to senility. The VP pick is everything and will be bought &amp; paid for.

Biden sniffs kids. Clinton is definitely a pedo. I‚Äôm no liberal FYI. Trumps side does the same. You know how many times Clinton and Trump have golfed and ‚Äúplayed‚Äù together through the years? People forget that too. Both sides apparently. I can‚Äôt stand the defenders on both,

Pretty sure he‚Äôs a Democrat who‚Äôs worried by Biden‚Äôs slurred, wandering, aggressive speech.  The debates are going to be a national embarrassment.
People way overvalue how important any campaign message was in many elections. Obama didn't win because "Hope and Change" was an uniquely perfect message. He won because Bush got us in two unsinkable wars and crashed the economy. Biden is winning because Trump killed grandma

Joe Biden is not a racist. He merely holds tightly to racist viewpoints, and constantly makes racist comments, and has a history of pushing legislation that disproportionately attacks people of color.
I would wait days in line to vote for Bernie. I likely won‚Äôt even vote by mail for Biden. My state is safe, and I refuse to reward the  for cheating us yet again of a leader we NEED so they can retain their power and cushy lifestyles.
I absolutely agree that Biden is appealing to centrists.  He provides all of the austerity and crushing of the poor that Trump provided, but without any of the embarrassing headlines.
Joe Biden jjust used the N word live on camera. WTF is wrong with him??
Joe Biden offended all blackface Americans with his divisive comments. Shame sham shame on you, Joe.
S.E. Cupp shouldn't try to make voting for Biden some big personal sacrifice. We get that she doesn't agree with everything Biden supports. Neither do I but I'm not voting for Trump or writing in Bebe Neuwirth on my ballot.
You say, with an anti-semitic slur.  (Which is odd, considering that Biden is Catholic. But, you're not known for accuracy).
Luckily Obama isn‚Äôt the signal flagger on who is and isn‚Äôt racist.  Biden is systemically racist and somewhere in between unapologetic and carelessly mistaken regarding every racist idea he perpetuates.  For example, unapologetic re: ‚Äúcrime‚Äù bills / mistaken re: black + latinx
For all the God loving Christians in the back who fear Joe Biden.
You post about Biden saying racist crap and you constantly say "China Virus". This really hurts the Asian Americans and is not safe seeing how your followers believe anything you say. Just call it by it's name, stop spreading hate and do your job.
I can't even fathom why we picked Biden in the first place, so I'm not going to pretend to understand what voters are basing their decisions on.
Biden is backed by Republicans. You‚Äôre most certainly playing their game. Their electoral strategy is to capture both parties, and you‚Äôre not even willing to oppose them.
No Joe Biden isn't racist only 50% of what he says is racist the other 50% doesn't make any sense if he was on his game like you claimed he is he should have no problem debating Trump and Pitkin Trump apart so if he's still on his game as you claim you should be pushing him

Im black and me and all of my friends and my whole family are voting for Joe Biden.
You do you, but let us know if you change your mind. Can‚Äôt buy it myself. IMHO Biden is just as big a threat as Trump, but will make folks complicit and complacent. I think that‚Äôs potentially even more dangerous. We‚Äôre on a slippery slope and Biden just adds to our speed.
I didn‚Äôt know that Joe Biden had the power to challenge a god.
If Biden elects to run with a corgi, you should still vote for him. Not doing so is actively voting for corruption, bankruptcy (moral and actual) and a 1000 dead Americans a day. Just vote for a human in November.

Trump sounds like a deranged lunatic whenever he speaks. Biden stumbles over words, trump literally cannot form a coherent thought.
Defend Biden without a comparison
It‚Äôs absolutely horrific to see Biden struggling.  Shame on his family, shame on the Democratic Party for allowing him to go through with the election.   I have never ever been a fan of this guy,  but the dude has dementia.  It‚Äôs pretty clear.  And it‚Äôs only going to get worse.
Mr. Biden, sir, I am offended at your remarks about blackface Americans. #BlackfaceLivesMatter
Well, at least them what plans social  media strategy and write the tweets aren't senile old racists, anyway.  So definitely vote Biden, the POTUS tweets will never, ever be written by him. Not like that fucker Trump. That is a promise, America.
I think it's a longer shot than 2016, at least as of right now. But debates will change a lot. People who don't watch things like the recent Yahoo News video watch debates, and there's no way Biden pulls off hours of sounding sane.

Job recovery is going well during the pandemic because Trump knows how to create jobs. He's always been a jobs-focused president. Biden worked with NAFTA and sold our jobs overseas. Biden doesn't know how to create jobs. Never has. If he is elected, our economy isn't coming back.
"Who's voting for Joe Biden" vs "who WANTS to vote for Joe Biden".
Okay but hear me out... Joe Biden's VP pick... will be Joe Biden.
Remember when Americans decided who the president would be?
I'm with you. I can't believe there are people who would be willing to vote for Kanye. However, the head-scratchier I have, is how would that siphon votes away from Biden? With all the press coverage of Kanye sucking up to Trump, would he be more attractive to a Trump voter?

Agreed. I sincerely doubt there will be even the slightest hint of that from Biden‚Äôs campaign. But we‚Äôve already seen the total lack of consequences when Trump does it.
what she said. not voting for biden is asking for 4 more years of descent into authoritarianism. Your dad is rolling in his grave.
I was raised in a country Christian church. I do not care about the religious background of any candidate. I care about personal ethics; Biden has plenty of those. That he has a strong connection to the Catholic church is fine. Trump? He has NO ethics, so case closed.#VoteJoe!
It is truly unfortunate that I have to choose between the lesser of two evils. I hate it. My vote for Biden is not a vote celebrating him, it‚Äôs a vote against someone who has 163,000 deaths on his hands and counting.
Especially, as is in most cases, they are so insanely bad at voter outreach. They aren't helping get votes for Biden with these defenses, only allow people like me the opportunity to explain why people shouldn't.  I'd say it's counter-productive to their goal but not to mine.
Almost. Those 12,000 troops in Germany won't re-list until next year. And if Biden wins (God Almighty, I hope!), he can reverse the order.
What if #Biden turns the election on its head &amp; chooses Michelle Obama as his VP?
When Biden announces his VP (tomorrow?) we will all rally around her because this isn't about our feelings, are we all clear on this?
And you don't know the facts. Democrats didn't urge Trump to take any action. In fact, Democrats, including Joe Biden, called his China travel ban "xenophobic" and fearmongering. This shows that a response from a Democrat president would've been more delayed. They hope you forget
The people who support Hillary and Biden don't think.  Most feel that they are benefiting from the old status quo and they want to protect that. And nothing more.
There is plenty of tangible evidence of Bernie's popularity in donor records and volunteers, and almost /none/ for Biden.  The idea that Biden could pull off a full sweep when a solid opponent is evident is laughable./

Biden says he would stop border wall construction if elected president
It's an outlandish lie, but the point seems to be President Trump getting some of his own stink off of himself regarding Ukraine and somehow smearing it on Joe Biden, who by all accounts has done nothing wrong.
They can read polls. They know they‚Äôre going to lose big in November and want to make things as difficult as possible for President Biden &amp; Dems, just like Obama &amp; the Great Recession. Party before country! #MAGA
President Trump attacking Joe Biden for misconduct with respect to Ukraine is a good example. President Trump WAS IMPEACHED for wrongdoing with respect to Ukraine. He and the GOP have since apparently tried to confuse people into thinking somehow that was Joe Biden.

I don't think most people will believe it. But people who support Biden we'll try to convince themselves that they believe it. And the media will try to push the story so that US/Russia relations remain complicated into Trump's next term. They are desperate to keep us divided
President Biden is looking forward to this taxing and spending power he didn't even know Republicans were fine with him having.
Please find an example of me covering for Biden. The only reason I am voting for Biden is because Trump has proven through his devastating handling of a pandemic that he doesn‚Äôt care about people‚Äôs lives.
I did. all he said was he's not hiding the fact that he wants ppl to vote for him, not Biden and not Trump either
Where's the friggin president today Hugh? VP Biden doesn't take office unti January 2021. Didn't the GOP and president all go on vacation? What a hypocrite that your putting the deal on Biden.
There's a possible upside to Biden losing his marbles for all to see:  He might start blurting out how government really works and where the biggest payoffs are and where they've been. He might tell us who's been to Epstein's Babyfuck Island.  Like Bulworth, only demented.

Biden ACTUALLY KNOWS verses from the Bible. Trump has NEVER READ IT, and curses it in private. Which side are you on, John? You're running out of time to choose.
The right answer is for Biden to reject external meddling in our elections by foreign countries (even if in his favor) because that's both illegal and un-American.   Then he should challenge the president to do the same.

‚ÄúI mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy," Biden said. "I mean, that's a storybook, man."
These last few months of the drumpf regime are all about him preserving "his wealth" and avoiding prison for various financial felonies.  I suspect that Hatch Act violations and treason of one kind or another will be pardoned by President Biden to help heal the nation a bit.
Biden made a voluntary pledge to select a woman for VP. Fine. But I think it would be have been wise to consider a few blokes such as Andrew Cuomo or Adam Schiff. Maybe still go with Warren or Harris in the end. But I don‚Äôt see what the value was in making that early pledge.
Trump's parallels to Hitler's propaganda is striking, repulsive and dangerous! Today Trump said to a crowd that his opponent "hurts God"! Wow.
Things Biden has done:  - come on man

All of this. I've rarely been less excited about any person than I am about Joe Biden, but we can't do 4 more years of trump.
Biden shows he is  faithful to Jesus by regularly attending church, and displaying the character of a Christian &amp; Jesus' teaching. Trump golfs on Sundays, has been married 3x, cheated, paidoff a pornstar and was convincted of misusing funds from his charitable Foundation.
Because he will take all the black voters away from Biden ?
Oh yeah I know, I was talking about Biden. The fact they have so much in common is pretty telling
Republican propaganda machine confirms that scaring people to death with doctored images of BLM protest videos is helping Trump's campaign close the gap! Dah! Hitler perfected this years ago.
The story is that Russia is interfering to help Trump while China is interfering to help Biden yet the headline from  focused exclusively on the angle that feeds an anti-Trump attack. How curious.
This--but I had the same complaint with HRC's treatment in 2016.  Yeah, Biden sometimes makes a gaffe, but Trump says /deliberately/ awful things ALL THE TIME!
I think politics in 2020 is generally pretty sour, but that's beside the point.  To claim Biden's VP pick is going to being uniquely scrutinized and that it's only because of her gender is a bad faith effort to shut down even substantive criticisms.
Have you been paying attention to the last four years? Your options are trump and biden; your protest vote is a vote to keep trump. Again, lying to yourself. Don‚Äôt worry; we all see through it üòò
Further, that's a fine strategy to have.  What is not a fine strategy is pledging your vote to Biden and actively reducing the bargaining position of progressive votes by screaming at people who do, as if they're the problem and not the DNC actively disenfranchising its voters.

Vote Biden or there will be no more elections ever.  This is crunch time. I believe in your optimism, but Progressives DID NOT organize to get Sanders in. BIG ERROR. Vote Biden or give the US over to Billy Barr's Brownshirted Nazis.  You want a green new deal? Organize better.

Joe Biden is not in a place to claim moral authority, even over a monster like Trump.  That's kind of why we were having a primary until your old guard called in favors.  So now voters get to deal with the predictable falllout of your strategically inept 'leaders'.
Then Biden's attitude toward god isn't important either.
Biden is the blue trump. You're delusional if you can't see that...
Based on inappropriate groping in /countless/ videos, and the monsters that Biden befriends in both parties, there is an equally real possibility Biden raped children. Further "killed 150,000 Americans", relies on the assertion that /none/ would have died under a dem presidency.
If you think that's Biden, you're delusional beyond belief.

what we have been slowly learning about Joe Biden is that when he sees a person of color he automatically goes to what is this person on why are they sweating why are their eyes dilated even if they're not this in is his brain, what he thinks
Joe Biden is a racist. A real racist. The comments he made yesterday are just the latest in a long list of racist comments he's made over the course of his political career.   This is the 2nd blatantly racist comment Biden has made about black people during this campaign.

This is stunning. Who could Biden possibly pick for the most ineffectual of all cabinet positions that would sway your vote to the idiotic sociopath currently driving our country nose-first into fascism?
2020 Twitter is that hellscape where people argue their vote for Biden is strictly dependent on his VP pick between...  ...UN Ambassador Susan Rice and Sen. Kamala Harris.   Not now, folks, not now.
Meanwhile, Biden won‚Äôt support m4a. The space between Ds and Rs at this point is paper thin
This is what the Tea Party, aka future Trump voters thought of our 1st black POTUS.  Biden defended him for 8 years against this crap.  #BlackVote
Not with Biden. If you believe it will, I've got ocean front property in Arizona for ya.
While you're so busy convincing everyone how racist Biden is let me remind you that Biden had no problem working under a black man.
My pick is Susan Rice. 2nd is Harris. If the younger generation read up on Susan  Rice, they would know she has so much experience in a lot of categories, they would want her as the VP. Biden knows Susan Rice. They worked together for 8 years with a President who was amazing.
i have no choice but to vote for biden bc in 2016 washington almost flipped red and i aint having that
And these people are?   Biden spent 8 years defending Obama from future Trump voters.
Black Vote is a American vote that vote should never be for a black hater like joe Biden TRUMP at least will babble his racism if any.  Joe is a sneezy sleepy kind of superjim wannabe chicken gorge whos your friend one minute and a corrupted lying racist the next all in secret
Then to begin with, Biden must declare unconditional no-first-use policy and take ICBMs off hair-trigger alert.
This was my biggest concern with Biden, but I‚Äôm hopeful that he won‚Äôt give in to that. There needs to be a thorough examination across the executive branch. Those institutions need serious reforms.
And? For F‚Äôs sake. How many times does this man need to be accused of all sorts of sexual crimes before a Trump supporter gets it?  A typical response is A picture of Biden kissing the top of a child‚Äôs head,  not bragging he can just grab a woman by the p*ssy!
You MUST be joking! If Biden won't move left to unite the party, news certainly not going to move left when he no longer needs our votes. He promised his donors nothing would change.
Presidency is &amp; always will be a team effort. With Trump it's a team of Vipers. Biden will be president. Won't be golfing &amp; letting Jared &amp; co. run the country. He'll be hands on. Biden's will be a team of heroes walking us out of the Trump Virus, division, &amp; lawlessness of T era
But. Biden is imploding.
I‚Äôll vote Joe Biden if Anita Hill is the VP
Same and as an impressionable youth it's pushing me away from biden
LOL Joe Biden eats his words.
That doesn't mean Biden isn't 100% for keeping it illegal so he can continue filling the prison labor force with Black and Brown slaves. He's a racist POS and "nothing will change".
The people out there preaching the pragmatism of Biden ignoring all leftist policy demands to attract moderate voters clearly haven‚Äôt read this. Democrats haven‚Äôt won the white vote in over 30 years. Going for moderate republicans isn‚Äôt the path to victory
I honestly think Biden does not wa to to win

no sorry, you DONT GET IT.  Do you really think that Biden is going to destroy womens rights, environment, 1st amendement protections, etc? Quit throwing your little temper tantrum and think about future generations!!
since it keeps coming up, who is this group of undecided voters that is silently reading all of left Twitter's tweets on Biden and using this as their basis for whether or not they should vote for him
I agree. It's a problem I have with him. I'm under half his age and far more articulate. But I'm afraid Biden is no more articulate. In fact, he's probably less. All presidents have their pros and cons.
Similarly I'm not going to accept Joe Biden's smear of Tara Reade who he raped. I'm a rape victim and feminist and to demand that I 'shut up, take Biden, and smile' is vile on so many levels. I refuse to accept rape culture.  He gets my vote, that's it.
You have to keep this messages coming!  Every time Trump tweets falsehiids IMMEDIATELY have a reasoned, fact-based response.  I call it the "Biden Rapid Response Team"   hit trump HARD with facts and data, science and evidenced-based..its gonna get ugly!
Joe Biden and the democrat party IS THE SOCIALIST PARTY which is burning down this country. If YOU want to continue the BURNING, I guess you'll go with Joe. The rest of the country won't! VOTE PRESIDENT TRUMP‚ÄºÔ∏è

I think Joe Biden really cares about the black community. And I bet he's willing and happy to listen to black people's concerns.  I made a video about learning to be better during political hot topic discussions.
On Nov 3rd the Black community will send you a very clear message of who is worthy of their vote and it will not be you. The black community long ago recognized you for the self-aggrandizing racist you are and the margin Joe Biden will win the black vote by will embarrass you.
And you Biden won't do anything to hold Israeli governments accountable. Has he even said the word 'Palestinian' on the campaign trail (to the extent he can be understood to be actively campaigning)?
Well, well, well...  Just wondering why Ed Rendell is anywhere near Biden &amp; the vetting team.

This is good. Trump will see this and want to debate. And then Trump will self destruct in a debate against Biden.

DNCs manipulation of South Carolina voters picked Biden, not the left. The same south Carolina that will absolutely go for Trump in Nov.
We already know Biden isn‚Äôt even close to our ideal. He clearly takes BIPOC votes for granted. But the only way anyone left of Biden is getting into the White House next year is on his cabinet.

Trump‚Äôs foreign policy team is hedging against a Biden win
A Biden Administration Will Have to Confront Trump‚Äôs Corruption via
Biden both politically and mathematically has to pick someone younger as his running mate, and is already part of the power center, so he can prioritize shaping a party leadership to carry Democrats forward, but we're 12 years behind where that project should be.
There is also a large group of other Democrats (see virtually everybody who ran other than Biden, Sanders, and Warren), but they were all vying to unseat Biden as the heir apparent, there was no feeling that they were vying to lead the Obama wing of the party.
The power center of the Democratic Party is still very much Clinton Democrats like Biden and, well, the Clintons. There's an internal opposition to that base in the left (Sanders, AOC, Ilhan, sometimes Warren, etc), but that's very much an opposition to the power center.
Speaking as a progressive, it sure seems a lot of us have forgotten about PROGRESS. Joe Biden might not appoint any progressive justices, but Trump absolutely won‚Äôt and you‚Äôre trolling yourself if you think any other candidate has a chance with 3 months left before Election Day.
Out of power #Republicans are deficit hawks, in power they run up colossal deficits, usually in the form of tax cuts for the wealthy without positive investments in education and infrastructure. To save us, #Biden will have to run huge deficits.
You really can't compare the Asian countries. They don't even have the same strain of the virus. Unemployment would be much higher and the death toll likely worse under democrats. Biden and other democrats called his China travel ban "xenophobic" and fearmongering.

China waged war on America and Biden would do nothing but forget where he is
Trump is a child? No wonder Biden is obsessed with him.
Biden should change the last letter of his name to a T, which would be an apt metaphor for what his victory in November would be.
Talking about Biden as a viable candidate is a waste of air. It‚Äôs best to call for him to drop. If he gets actually nominated then re-evaluate.  Planet‚Äôs on fire so a more radical position contines to be the course to take. Local action over accepting prez electoral narrative.
First off, that's debatable. Second, Bernie quit. DNC wanted Biden, not the people. We do not live in a democracy, it's a facade and changing the parties from within its a fool's errand.
Joe Biden was known for his loose lips even back in 2008 when Obama picked him as his running mate.
Never agreed with National Policy communication to be a tweet. Biden can abandon it all together as I see it, it is not the proper platform.
I believe she would make a great attorney general or Supreme Court Justice (as would Elizabeth Warren for the latter). But Biden can only make nominations for those positions. There‚Äôs no guarantee they would be confirmed. This is one decision that is totally his to make.
He could pick any AMERICAN stranger off the street and I WILL VOTE FOR BIDEN
A big get for Team Obama?? Isn't Biden the one running?  P. S. Anna Navarro is a bitter hag.
Really? For speaker slots at a virtual convention? Biden will have a woman on his actual ticket. Does Trump have a woman as VP?
People blindly give their $$ to the sham NRA to save their 2A rights &amp; it‚Äôs hilarious. They are a bunch of power/money hungry frauds.  2A isn‚Äôt going away; Obama didn‚Äôt take your guns &amp; neither will Biden. NRA supporters are bigger sheep than any ‚Äúlib‚Äù I‚Äôve ever seen.
I know nothing about West's politics, but why is he anxious to hurt Biden? Who's running this show?
vote how you feel, but if you're horrified at how the Trump administration has laid bare the monstrous way the US treats immigrants from Latin America, keep that same energy when the Biden administration does the same thing with a smile and the cameras off.
Another ridiculous comment. If you actually believe that Biden in 2020 is this person, you should vote for Trump. Or maybe Kanye!
Up here in blinding white Wasington, we're mostly Biden supporters. Not all, but mostly.
the Biden campaign's tapping Navarro to do "Latino outreach" is a fucking embarrassment, and a signal that a Biden administration will pursue more of the same inhumane foreign policy that both parties have used to exploit Latin America for cheap labor and stolen resources.
Been beating this drum for weeks. R's know they're going to lose big in November, so they want to make things as difficult as possible for President Biden and the Dems. Just like they did for Obama in the Great Recession. Party over country, always! Do you even have to ask? #MAGA
Joe Biden will be the next President! You‚Äôre grasping at straws now, and you‚Äôll only get worse!
As always, we‚Äôll said. However...I do think you‚Äôre giving Biden way too much credit. I‚Äôm not sure there is any way that people who have played a direct role in creating the mess we are in (as Biden has) can get us out of it. All he can really do is get Trump out
Just by virtue of his long tenure? Well, Congressmen and women tend to stay in their groups. So if Biden does, it's very little. But my point is that Trump has shown to be a very jobs-focused president. And we need that more than ever.
A rebuttal:  Biden hasn‚Äôt changed his personal feelings about abortion, but recognized (like MOST Americans) it‚Äôs not his place to limit access to legal medical care. Also? If this matters more than the 1000‚Äôs dying needlessly due to Trump‚Äôs failures-not very prolife.
Antifa is burning our country. People are going broke. 200,000 dead during a pandemic is in sight. Economy in a depression. All we care about is Joe Biden being Joe Biden and Donald Trump saying thighland? This is the problem. That's why no one can focus on the real issues.
Biden doesn‚Äôt have to debate you! It‚Äôs a waste of his time.
Really great ... for Biden.
I can't see how that's attributable to Biden. Obama signed the American jobs act but Biden was really a glorified cheerleader. In the Senate, Biden served as head of judiciary committe and some other roles but nothing for job creation.
Not that *I* care about somebody's religious practices or beliefs (I don't care that a president believes in God), but if he says he's religious but nobody's ever seen him practice it, then he's a liar. But there's no news here: Biden is honest, Trump is a fucking liar.
Like it or not, she‚Äôs right - no matter who the VP pick, it‚Äôs Biden vs. Trump. Period.
I am confused as to what exactly you are saying. Are you saying Chris Wallace and Joe Biden are racist and Donald Trump is not?  I made a video about conversations like this.
Obama and  Biden sued The Little Sisters of the Poor.  They had to go all the way to the Supreme Court to protect their religious liberty from the cultural imperialism from the left.
You should probably look into what Joe Biden has done.
I think Biden debating T at all just normalizes trumpism.  This time, it isn't at all about what the politicians say, we are beyond that with both of them. It is about what they've done. Biden debating T just rises T's stature.
Susan is great. Smart, experienced, etc., but Kamala is these things as well as having an outgoing personality &amp; energy. Susan is a little more mild. One criticism of Biden‚Äôs campaign is energy. Susan is also not as recognized, I worry if Susan is their choice.
this article is so irresponsible. ya he wants ppl not to vote for Biden, and to vote for him, why do you think they are Bidens votes in the first place? maybe you're assuming, like Biden and all Democrats, that the black vote is monolith and automatically for Democrats?
Case in point: President Trump (&amp; even Biden, who secured the nom over Black men and women).
This is why Biden is what we need
I agree. Repubs are going to slime whoever he selects. It is going to be an ugly dogfight &amp; they will try to drag VP into gutter.   Biden should pick whoever he wants. I just hope the Dems come together once the announcement is made. I am tired of the arguing &amp; speculating.
vs Biden who has taken  soft stances at best?
Does anyone else cherish Brian Williams' dry wit?
Of course you aren‚Äôt.  Trump is the racist. As usual, he‚Äôs projecting his issue onto former Vice President Biden.
Pretty good.  I‚Äôm liking this car salesman Biden guy more and more.
I'm not going to do it, but I'm in a safe state. I can't. This isn't a candidacy, it's a hostage situation. Biden has literally laughed about not giving a single shit about change. He's a rapist. If you're not in a secure state I can't tell you what to do...
That is the most selfish thing I‚Äôve heard lately. Trump is endangering the world. He needs to go and the only way is electing Biden apparently.

I respect your analysis and your reasons for not supporting Trump. But, by eschewing Biden based solely on his VP pick - Biden being the only candidate with a chance of beating Trump - you are seemingly using your vote in a way that actually supports Trump, as you did in 2016.
And I corrected it but it still made my overall point. Democrats didn't condemn the violence at the Barr hearing and still won't. Biden said something about it vaguely and that's it. You thought the wall of moms were innocent little angels LOL. Damn you are too naive.
Eight years of steady leadership and sensible regulation did more for prosperity than Bush's deregulation or whatever the fuck Trump's plan to the extent that he has one is.  This is why I vote for centrist mainstream Democrats like Biden, Obama, and Clinton.
Try as much as possible   Election result will not change on Nov 3,2020. We already have decided to VOTE FOR  #46President of UNITED STATES. Not only me but everyone in my family voting for Biden.

Listening to Biden speak feels the same as listening to Trump speak. There‚Äôs racism, there‚Äôs incomplete thoughts and confusing, meandering sentences, there‚Äôs the dredging up of bile at the reminder that these people are in office, everything.

It isn't about if the NRA is good or bad (the NRA is several organizations and this wouldn't dissolve the NRA all up) it's about giving ammo to Trump 90 days before an election. Why not wait? Gun control is not politically advantageous. This hurts Biden.
With all due respect to  this is absolute nonsense. You change the rule to actually deliver on the issues you are hearing about from Virginians
Don‚Äôt presume that a Biden victory is a sure thing. If history is anything to go by, Trump could quit, cheat, delay, contest the result - or surprise everyone and win again.   #Biden #Biden2020 #Trump #Trump2020 #JoeBiden #DonaldTrump
This is why the Texas Governor is so indecisive when it comes to school openings. He wants to please Trump but doesn‚Äôt want the state to go to Biden.
Right-wing media defanged by dissolving anti-Biden storylines
You're absolutely right (as usual) - there are still several factors that can play out to Trump's favor: MI, PA and WI must go for Biden. These are again critical states to win.
They want to win, but not on a voter mandate that they might actually face pressure to remain beholden too. Thus Biden, the candidate opposed to enacting, well, any of it.
He‚Äôs got the strangest sense of humor but I really like it. It really works how dry his comments are

If you are sincere, try again after the US elections in November.  If Trump wins, you know where to start.  If Biden wins, ask him to open up the Great Piggy Bank again.  He may be old and foolish, but his party, if not the American people, are ready for it.  Good luck

I know that Biden is a man of faith. I remember what my pastor taught us about lying:  Proverbs 6:12-13¬†‚Äì Let me describe for you a worthless and a wicked man; first, he is a constant liar; he signals his true intentions to his friends with eyes and feet and fingers.

Geoff Duncan got caught. Looking at Georgia‚Äôs guidelines, they are willing to let your child die. Vote for  in 2020. Joe Biden will protect your child, Joe knows the pain of losing a child.
Now that we know Biden has the ability to hurt God I will consider voting for him.
That‚Äôs just simply bullshit
Gonna keep reposting this until it stops being being so damn obviously true.  Biden's cognitive decline is obviously accelerating - I wonder what excuse they're going to give, when he finally drops an N-bomb. (Reason #273 they're afraid to let him debate.)
We need to win this fucking race in Nov. I saw the clip w/ Biden discussing great latino diversity, unlike african americans.   Joe, stay in the fucking basement. do NOT give any more interviews until Dec 2020.   to Joe's handlers, can't you keep this guy under wraps till 11/4/20

Agreed. We must stop Trump from ruining the USPS by installing one of his cronies to head USPS so he could lay off key people, ban overtime and do everything else they can think of to delay the mail. He doesn't even try to hide his criminal activity now. #VoteByMail for #Biden
So is Biden a doddering senile incompetent who can't make it up the basement stairs; or is he some quasi-omnipotent being with the power to harm firearms as a class, God Himself, and the physical property that is energy?
So you admit that what Biden said was racist, and yet you choose to believe that his racist comments are actually some sort of misunderstood strength?  This is EXACTLY the kind of bullshit excuses Trump supporters were making in 2016. You Biden supporters really are #BlueMAGA...
Just imagine the sheer force of denial and repression you'd need and the cognitive dissonance you'd have to endure, to keep pretending that Joe Biden has a chance or has any meaningful virtue to offer.  In the next 3 months, I guarantee these people are going to blow some fuses.
Yes, let‚Äôs discuss it. Biden‚Äôs been a lifelong career racist and habitual liar. He‚Äôs been saying racist stuff for 40 years. Also VIDEO of him using the N word.  Do you consider that comment  just a word?
Seriously? Who could he pick for VP that would be worse than Trump?  "...it‚Äôs likely the difference between Biden getting my vote and writing someone else in.  ...His vice president will [be] ...a guiding force in his administration, and potentially his replacement."
By all accounts he‚Äôs been reduced to his so-called ‚Äúbase‚Äù. Provided all the sane people go out to vote, Biden should get a landslide.
Biden is saying what he actually feels and that‚Äôs why you should vote for everything under the sun except the President.  Voting is wholly insufficient but we don‚Äôt have enough other areas of political action built up enough to say fuck voting altogether.
News analysis: After Bernie Sanders fell to Joe Biden, the young left mourned what could have been. Now, after a series of victories in congressional races, it‚Äôs hopeful again.
Oh ffs can we not do the whole, "the Dem candidate is just like Trump" stupidity this time around? Biden sucks, but he's not even close to just being Trump but with different masters.
"Racism vs. diet racism" is an excellent turn of phrase to describe this shit sandwich of an election.
Yes. That is insane. Why did he do??? Moron Biden!
For whom? Old senile Biden or flippant on Twitter Trump. Hard pass.

Too bad all of the Progressives didn't work hard enough. Too late. They did not nominate Warren or Sanders.. That is where the battle was.  Where were the young voters? Why did this fail? If the numbers were a landslide the DNC could not have pushed Biden.  Trump = fascism
Some people cannot see outside of the two positions, like Biden/Trump, left/right, pro con, Repub/Dem, Coke/Pepsi, Apple/Microsoft, because a more nuanced position requires thought, maybe even logic.   You shine a bright light on the crazy &amp; it acts like it's being Zapped!

You have no idea what it is like for a woman to have to make this god-awful choice. His self righteous crap really is annoying. And I just told you what Joe Biden did and what he heard his faith is important to him so don‚Äôt be so hypocritical and judge mental
Your choice is Biden or Fascism.  That's it. So stand your moral ground and end democracy. Let Billy Barr's Secret Police round up your Progressive friends &amp; take them to Chinese Style retraining camps.  Dictatorship is around the corner. Yes, both sides are corrupt. But come on.

True. But as an Indian, I feel Trump will be more favourable for India geopolitically (to counter China and Pakistan) versus Biden. Being selfish here. But again Trump is a loose canon , cannot be trusted. Ever. May change his opinion and loyalty based on a better ‚Äòdeal‚Äô by China

VOTE OUT TRUMP AND HIS PAWNS AND TOKENS. Trump uses BLACK PROPS when he needs then for a BLACK boost. Yet, DAILY all you see is ALL WHITE PEOPLE around Trump. Every now and then, a BLACK PROP appears. Kinda like HIS RACIST HUD housing.
biden is proof that you can fail upwards all your life even if you really don't want keep going.
It is a very personal choice. He is a devout Catholic. His faith has held him up after losing two children and his first wife. I think it would be wise for people not to criticize Joe Biden for his faith. It is extremely important to him and he is always made that clear
I would suggest telling Trump to read the constitution and not try to steal the election illegally. I watched an interview a while ago with Biden. he is pro-choice with respect that he does not believe Women should be told what to do with their bodies.
I'll be surprised if Trump wins Oregon, but if Biden tanks and Trump re-energizes his base it's conceivable. (ex-OR resident)
Trump inherited a good economy but set it on an even steeper incline. Job recovery is going better than expected even under the pandemic. Biden promoted NAFTA which lost America many, many jobs to other nations. If Biden wins, we're not making a full recovery as a nation.
It‚Äôs more insidious than even that. If a person wanted to become more political they would not be able to find any way to express that in either of these ‚Äòparties‚Äô.  Electoral horse race focus is about stopping political thought that‚Äôs why Biden makes ‚Äòsense‚Äô EVEN in a pandemic.
I'm not reading whatever that article is but why would this guy think a "landslide victory" would be any different from a narrow one? If Trump and the GOP think Biden needs to win by a certain number of votes, that means they won't be happy no matter how many he wins by.
Well now I am super on board. #biden
Craziest coincidence ever! Of all time! God must really be on his side! (Especially after how Biden harmed him. Sorry: Him.)
Joe Biden did not write this. He likely didn't even read it. This is the embodiment of what a Biden presidency would be - four years of gaffs followed by his handlers putting out retractions and corrections.  #JoJorgensen2020 #VoteGold #VoteGold2020 #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt
I suspect that because of Biden's one-two punch of gaffes the last couple days, they might quit dragging their feet on his campaign announcement tomorrow just so they have a topic to draw the air out of the room and a new face so Biden can shut up while they do the talking.
Rejecting #MedicareForAll also downplays the threats pandemics pose, but you have no problem killing Americans that way, do you Uncle Trump-Biden?
No, they won't. Neither will health care workers. And, with American's not getting #MedicareForAll, the needless death and suffering for the safe of profits will continue. Murdering Biden, another Republican-like crook.
Biden is right. This is just a snippet of what he was saying. Inside the Latin community there are afro-latinos, indigenous-latinos, European-latinos, Portuguese speakers, Spanish speakers and everything in between. Nothing too controversial here.

Biden‚Äôs senior advisor. You gotta stay engaged in politics at all times.

Sadly, we have  running against Trump, so with two rapists, racist, corrupt sociopaths, we still screwed. Remember when Biden threatened to shoot Barack Obama when he was fearmongering that Obama would come to snatch everyone's gun?
Why is this still circulating.  We know your thoughts. Don't vote for Biden; that is your right.  But, please don't give Twitter any more pablum and nonsense as to why. Continuing this nightmare is on you.
I have no problem with his VP being in charge. Trump just needs to go. Also Trump isn‚Äôt mentally there either, he just talks in circles and makes no sense where Biden speaks a bit slower. Trump overall shows much less intelligence.
So much new drama everyday its hard.  Can't wait till Biden gets elected so I can sleep again.
But not Black people? Biggest racist ever! Not you‚ÄîBIDEN
It is very scary and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so invested in doing my part and inspiring others to do theirs. Also, we had Biden for 8 years as VP and know what to expect. Regardless of what some people think about Biden he‚Äôs the lesser of two evils by a massive magnitude.
I‚Äôm voting Biden, I voted third party once and honestly it‚Äôs not practical in a system that favors two parties. Go Biden, and then advocate like fire for rank choice voting. When we have ranked choice voting, we shift the paradigm. But I operate in what the current reality is.
Yet, if the TV fake minister, out trump‚Äôs disdain for morals, they would still support him for being Christian, Love the Sinner, and criticize Biden for caring for all people.

We were discussing Biden's supposedly being under investigation in Ukraine and Trump having a warrant for murder in Iran.
It‚Äôs not a debate when one side lies and bullies. Biden has agreed to 3 debates, but I think Trum has not agreed to any (although he has ‚Äúasked‚Äù for 4). Biden should consider setting some conditions like 1. Fact-checking on the spot; 2. Direct questions by the candidate
Why Biden, why? üôÑ
I don't want to hear another goddam word about Biden's pick for VP until it is announced.
Oh, I hate Biden. I'm not trying to be a boil on your back, either. My daughter is having a baby later this year. I am scared to death for all of them. Seriously.

I have zero concerns about Biden debating Trump.
There's no hard evidence Trump did that BECAUSE they are black. Biden, however, worked to keep schools segregated, voted against civil rights measures, authored bills to arrest mass black populations and increase police power, militarized police, etc. You are voting for Biden?!?!
I'm thrilled with whomever Joe Biden chooses as vice president. She will be amazing, and we're lucky to have her serve our country.   But I also want to give a special hug my #KHive friends tonight. Whatever happens, you are amazing, and we're lucky to have you serve our country.
I don‚Äôt understand all of these people in the comments accusing you of not supporting Biden. On more than one occasion on IG you‚Äôve made it clear Joe has your support. People don‚Äôt pay attention.
Yeah!  And Biden will kill all the kittens in the world, too!  And he‚Äôll ban sunshine and rainbows!

I don‚Äôt know of anyone who supports abortion up through the 9th month. If I remember correctly, VP Biden personally does not agree with abortion, but he also believes it‚Äôs not his right to force his Religious belief on other people.

The GOP always tell you who they fear most. Rice would be the best fit for Biden. She‚Äôs been in the trenches with both Obama &amp; Biden. Yes, there would be a concern in 2024 IF Biden decides not to run. Stumping is not her strength. She would work IF he decides to run again in 2024
If Biden‚Äôs VP pick is a rock, I‚Äôm still voting for him.
Your attacks on Biden and his religion just shows what a desperate, sad, petty person you are. The country will be so much better off when you are voted out in November.
Just more of Joe Biden being the racist that he is.  #BidenIsRacist #JoeBidenIsARacist #Trump2020
Ugh yes. I‚Äôve heard from so many people that the world is falling apart.   I‚Äôd be willing to bet that if Biden picked Michelle as his running mate, she could easily lift us alll out of this terrible fog.
I‚Äôm antitheist, and this dumb
Republican-controlled Senate didn't allow witnesses to testify (thereby admitting they knew trump was corrupt) then gave him a pass (thereby admitting they too are corrupt).  Biden has a law degree, so he's certainly not stupid.  Sounds like you are the one with learning to do.
Trump is desperate and will cheat however possible.
If Joe Biden wants most powerful job in the free world, he needs to be tested and prove himself in front of voters, unless he is looking for a spot in nursing home.
I'm not the biggest Biden stan ever, but he's not wrong.
So frustrating. This foot in mouth ism is for Biden what womanizing is for Clinton. It's part of the package, although it's less pronounced now thank God.
Biden respects the constitution, you don‚Äôt and you lie about it.

It's interesting watching folks who support racist candidates accuse the other party of being racist. But corporate #USA news media is not interested in highlighting such hypocrisy in electoral #politics.     #Biden #Trump
Yeah, CNN's been pushing the idea that Trump's a warmonger since 2016, but I'm honestly more worried about Biden being manipulated into starting a war.
One of the most racist comments ever or cognitive decline, it's both folks, biden is one of the worst person pretending to be all about love, they're all about hate. biden is the most racist
Biden?  I‚Äôd vote for Trump first myself.  Wanted Gabbard, but Dems don‚Äôt want an intelligent anti-war President.  Too much lucre to be made off war.
The dem establishment would use a Biden landslide as a "told ya so" to progressives (ignoring the effect of the pandemic on his run)
Incredible racism or cognitive decline, likely both, biden is one of the most racist people I have ever heard speak
Shocking
You know the Dems have this gamed out. One reason they went nuts with the Nevada all mail in ballots was to try to flip Nevada from R to D.   And their cheating in FL will probably flip FL from R to D.  Then it's a tie and they can count on Mitt and Collins to vote Biden/His VP.
So now you acknowledge you were wrong and ignorant about Trump's work for minorities? Yes, Trump was sued for that. The people who sued him lost the case. Biden openly tells people "you ain't black' and just this morning he said black people all think alike and aren't diverse!
Two things,  You are WEAK for disliking Mrs. Harris, you are WEAK FOR POINTING THIS OUT DAYS LITERALLY BEFORE BIDEN ANNOUNCES HIS VP PICK, in a campaign against TRUMP SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!

I just wish people would acknowledge the reality of the situation, which is that Joe Biden is fucking terrible for pretty much any kind of marginalized person, but we're supposed to vote for him anyway because even fucking terrible is better than the outright apocalypse.
Why on earth do you think Biden changed? Don't be a fool. Trump wants to implement more of what? Trump implemented PRISON REFORM which benefitted thousands of black inmates and created economic opportunity zones for minority people and much more. Please do your research.
It seems like all of your friends are corrupt, it's so weird! No, President Biden won't take away your guns, you're fear mongering again for political gain. Obama's administration did more for gun rights that you have, so think about that for a little minute.
Trump admin is burning it all down to make it difficult or impossible to undo some of their terribly policies.
This is absolutely ludicrous and if you can experience these last 3.5 years, from your position of privilege, and still have stipulations for voting for Biden then you are a worthless fraud. You don‚Äôt really give and that‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt really have to. üñï

If you are OK with trump destroying America over the next four years simply because Biden doesn't pick who you want for VP, then don't try getting anyone to believe you love your country.  Also, fuck you.
And you think Joe Biden is gonna be the one to do that? Neo-liberal politics is what got us to this point. Also if Trump wants to be a dictator, He's not going to do it within the law. The 2nd amendment is meant for overthrowing a corrupt fascist government.
Thank you Mr. Biden
"If Biden doesn't pick who I want for VP, I'm OK with letting trump destroy America and everything she stands for." How can anyone who loves our country think that way?

‚ÄúObama, Biden, and every NBA player is silent.‚Äù #wtf the NBA have to do with whatever your point is?
Dammit it people, I meant I waited hours for someone to point out that he said it wrong. He can't get away with a single misspeak. Try listening to Biden complete a sentence. I don't agree with Dinesh on this, but he is right about different pronounciations.
If Biden wins, all these never-Trump characters will take credit. And TV pundits will let them.
Hahahah!! The Biden Gaffe Damage Control team is on scene! Joe Biden Can‚Äôt pronounce fitness, Let alone monolith or even remember the word monolith!
This is more than enough reason to #vote for Biden. #VoteBlue
I‚Äôm assuming you all know that Biden has had a lifelong stuttering problem, which explains a lot of his fumbling with words.  Listen, you‚Äôll hear it.  Very different from Trump‚Äôs problem.
*Biden's beleaguered social media team
Rumors are telling me, Susan Rice.  But my Biden gut tells me, Kamala Harris.
I agree.    Are you f-ing serious.  There is a choice of VP where you won't vote for Biden?  If your answer is yes, you may not care, but I will block you. #TraitorTrump #cadetbonespurs
Maybe instead of trying to win a bigger crowd in Ohio, you should try to win the war on covid. 150k dead and rising and you're taking golf trips. Well at least when you lose the election to biden in November "it is what it is." #EndTheNightmare #voteblue #FakePresident #Biden2020
You are DEAD WRONG! Biden devastated black Americans with his 1994 crime bill and working to keep schools segregated. Trump created economic opportunity zones and prison reforms for minority people, supported black colleges &amp; universities and much more. Do your research!
Seriously Biden, this should be a cake walk. Don't say anything stupid... ü§Øüò°
Biden is against god? You‚Äôre the one banging women outside of marriage!
Fuck Joe Biden. Fuck the Dems. Fuck the presidency. Fuck this country. Fuck white supremacy.
Then you must be racist like Biden
Biden is racist as hell. Call Trump racist but Biden is overtly so with comments like these and "you ain't black".
You will have my VOTE üó≥  BIDEN 2020 üëçüèΩ
Trump, the man who is confirmed to have sinned every known way (I mean, I assume he has directly resulted in someone‚Äôs death), is stating Biden will ‚Äúhurt god‚Äù???
You will excuse Biden's racist words and behavior but not Trump's? At least Trump didn't work tirelessly to keep schools segregated...
President-Elect Biden states that he‚Äôll finalize his pick for VP ‚Äúsome time before‚Äù Inauguration.
Biden and Trump should have a bible trivia night.
Thank you! I am voting Biden, no matter who.
I give Biden points for not going to DNC. Demonstrates the kind of leadership we need to beat the pandemic.  Biden has a ton of confidence, it‚Äôs just not narcissistic.   As for running mate, they‚Äôre usually announced near conventions, so u can expect Kamala to be annnounced soon.
It would work well with Biden too.
That's literally not what Biden said. Nice try defending his extremely racist comment.
Well said VP Biden. Trump is pathetic and desperate
True. I suppose you can count Biden's response as an apology. I just find it interesting, watching Biden's comments again (in full context) you really have to trust that he didn't mean what it sounds like he's saying.
Will Joe Biden even live until November 3?
So tell trumpkin.. I hear don trying to read from a teleprompter..  Whats a Yo-semite? Where is thighland? This is just the last 2 days. Hes an illiterate moron.  Biden is 6581% better and I'm rounding down.  But don loves the poorly educated and you fit that like a glove
Why does it bother you if it‚Äôs true? Why defend an old white guy who‚Äôs been in government for decades? Why? Is he your dad? What a weird thing to blindly defend someone like Joe Biden
Wait. So Donald Trump is telling us that if we elect Joe Biden in November, the United States President will be an affable, gaffe-prone humanist who is MORE POWERFUL THAN GOD!?  That's his campaign argument?
Wow, I thought Joe Biden was looking pretty weak and ineffectual but if he can hurt god then I would not fuck with him.
Seriously?? If you support this compromised old man to run this country, you‚Äôve sold your soul to left wing ideology to spite Trump. Biden has no clue where he is or what he is even saying. Sad  Former Vice-President Joe Biden's verbal gaffes  via

How great would it be if one of the debates was a discussion about Trump and Biden's personal faith journeys and issues of faith in America? If you thought Trump looked moronic with those Covid charts...
That's because God wants to make nice with Mr. Biden, you know for fear he might hurt Him. ;-)
you missed him going off the rails and going ballistic?  It's a regular occurrence.  He is receiving flack from all sides ---yes, because of his failure to lead, his abuse of power his divisive rhetoric.  Maintaining composure?
Republicans are taking advantage of Kanye's struggle to manage his mania. Manipulating and using the mentally ill to help Trump is another reason to vote for Biden.
Joe Biden apologized for making a misstatement. Imagine having a President who apologized.
Whomever Joe Biden picks as his VP...take a deep breath and remember its America or trump  Honesty against fear mongering   Healthcare against covid-19   Working for Americans against playing golf  Accept his decision. Those that didn't make the cut aren't going anywhere
"not voting for Biden is voting for Trump!"
Some are pro choice. I know quite a bit about Catholicism. What about capital punishment?. Joe Biden is one of the most empathetic and compassionate people around. Compared to trump any day. Trump is a murderer
I wrote a scripture thread in response to The #Biblicalidiot saying Biden and Dems are against and going to Hurt God. I promise Joe Biden Is not going to hurt God. #TrumpHurtGod when he said it. Add your own scripture in response.
I believe Meghan plans to vote for Biden. I read an article saying the McCain family supports him.

no vote or non vote for Biden IS a vote for Trump! Try and keep up.
Young voters broke overwhelmingly for Bernie Sanders in the primary. Now Joe Biden has to earn their votes.

Then how do you know what Joe Biden is really like. OK if you study him but it‚Äôs your version. I have some knowledge about him because I know some people who know him and no is character

Yes. Biden is the president and will shape our country's ability to heal. He has numerous extremely qualified possible VP picks. Voting for Biden based on choice of VP is ridiculous.

USA TODAY: Donald Trump claims Joe Biden is 'against God'
Dont think of it as voting "for Biden" You are voting "against trump"
I know I‚Äôll sleep better knowing Biden is president
Aren't people allowed to make jokes?  Yglesias is making fun of a particular right wing ad targeted against Biden, IIRC.You've yet to prove a single thing. You continue to avoid addressing my points such as how democrats haven't condemned anything and how Biden has harmed black Americans tremendously and Trump's legacy of actually benefitting them.
That's a hoot coming from a Biden/BLM supporter
Biden was absolutely Hillary's first choice.  That way after they anoint her as VP, they can "discover" his cognitive decline has progressed to the level of dropping N-bombs and "be forced to" replace him with her.  Although to be fair, that was her second choice of M.O.
Unsuccessfully impeached. He is doing everything in his power now to combat the virus. There's nothing more that Biden could or would do about it as president
Job recovery is going well during the pandemic because Trump knows how to create jobs. He's always been a jobs-focused president. Biden worked with NAFTA and sold our jobs overseas. Biden doesn't know how to create jobs. Never has. If he is elected, our economy isn't coming back.
Remember when Americans decided who the president would be?
And you don't know the facts. Democrats didn't urge Trump to take any action. In fact, Democrats, including Joe Biden, called his China travel ban "xenophobic" and fearmongering. This shows that a response from a Democrat president would've been more delayed. They hope you forget
Biden is blatantly the least worthy presidential candidate in recent memory of this nation. The msn has none of his own ideas and can't even form a coherent thought without sounding like an idiot
They can read polls. They know they‚Äôre going to lose big in November and want to make things as difficult as possible for President Biden &amp; Dems, just like Obama &amp; the Great Recession. Party before country! #MAGA
But remember for privileged leftists re-electing trump might be ok but for those on margins it‚Äôs a huge difference with real consequences. Note Chomsky backs Biden.
Republicans are trying to calibrate additional pandemic aid to expire after the election so if Biden wins they can make things as difficult as possible for him. Party before country! #MAGA
The people out there preaching the pragmatism of Biden ignoring all leftist policy demands to attract moderate voters clearly haven‚Äôt read this. Democrats haven‚Äôt won the white vote in over 30 years. Going for moderate republicans isn‚Äôt the path to victory
I agree. It's a problem I have with him. I'm under half his age and far more articulate. But I'm afraid Biden is no more articulate. In fact, he's probably less. All presidents have their pros and cons.
Yes, we're currently in a recession. You're jumping from point to point and not connecting any dots. Your arguments are as incoherent as a speech from Trump or Biden.
Ask Biden about his hairy legs and kids jumping on his lap
You really can't compare the Asian countries. They don't even have the same strain of the virus. Unemployment would be much higher and the death toll likely worse under democrats. Biden and other democrats called his China travel ban "xenophobic" and fearmongering.
Its like Trump listened to John Lennon's "Imagine" and thought. I could blame that on Joe Biden. Smhü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I know nothing about West's politics, but why is he anxious to hurt Biden? Who's running this show?
Been beating this drum for weeks. R's know they're going to lose big in November, so they want to make things as difficult as possible for President Biden and the Dems. Just like they did for Obama in the Great Recession. Party over country, always! Do you even have to ask? #MAGA
Just by virtue of his long tenure? Well, Congressmen and women tend to stay in their groups. So if Biden does, it's very little. But my point is that Trump has shown to be a very jobs-focused president. And we need that more than ever.
I can't see how that's attributable to Biden. Obama signed the American jobs act but Biden was really a glorified cheerleader. In the Senate, Biden served as head of judiciary committe and some other roles but nothing for job creation.
You mean #ChinaVirus   At least job recovery is going well. Biden knows nothing of job creation. He sold our jobs overseas. Oh, and there's no reason to believe this is all Trump's fault. Even democrats share some blame, but they won't own up to it.
And you want to elect Biden who sold our jobs overseas and knows nothing of economics, job creation, or business? At least Trump has aided job recovery.
And I corrected it but it still made my overall point. Democrats didn't condemn the violence at the Barr hearing and still won't. Biden said something about it vaguely and that's it. You thought the wall of moms were innocent little angels LOL. Damn you are too naive.
Because Joe Biden is racist.
You need to get better news sources. Trump was mentioning that SOME illegal immigrants are criminals. He condemned white supremacy so he wasn't praising them. Oh, and Biden just made a new racist comment yesterday morning! He's still his racist old self.
Your "facts" are just linking articles which are loosely relevant but don't really help your argument much. You knew nothing about Trump's accomplishments or Biden's history or much of what we've discussed
Geoff Duncan got caught. Looking at Georgia‚Äôs guidelines, they are willing to let your child die. Vote for  in 2020. Joe Biden will protect your child, Joe knows the pain of losing a child.
Gonna keep reposting this until it stops being being so damn obviously true.  Biden's cognitive decline is obviously accelerating - I wonder what excuse they're going to give, when he finally drops an N-bomb. (Reason #273 they're afraid to let him debate.)
African American "Christians" are predominantly voting Democrat Biden due to preachers in wolves clothing -
Trump inherited a good economy but set it on an even steeper incline. Job recovery is going better than expected even under the pandemic. Biden promoted NAFTA which lost America many, many jobs to other nations. If Biden wins, we're not making a full recovery as a nation.
Joe Biden is the actual Anti-Christ. OMG!!!!!
"I didn't MEAN it, I just SAID it. Stop taking me in context."  Wow. Chutzpah, thy name is Biden.
There's no hard evidence Trump did that BECAUSE they are black. Biden, however, worked to keep schools segregated, voted against civil rights measures, authored bills to arrest mass black populations and increase police power, militarized police, etc. You are voting for Biden?!?!
So now you acknowledge you were wrong and ignorant about Trump's work for minorities? Yes, Trump was sued for that. The people who sued him lost the case. Biden openly tells people "you ain't black' and just this morning he said black people all think alike and aren't diverse!
Why on earth do you think Biden changed? Don't be a fool. Trump wants to implement more of what? Trump implemented PRISON REFORM which benefitted thousands of black inmates and created economic opportunity zones for minority people and much more. Please do your research.
Thank Biden for that. He pushed hard for war on drugs and his 1994 crime bill also led to mass black incarceration and an increase of police power. Voting for him is a disgrace to the black community.
Biden's all like...

I think Biden is picking Harris
Biden doesn't life by it. At all.  Neither does Trump.
Biden called Obama the "first mainstream African American who is bright and clean and articulate". The FIRST! Racists can bench their beliefs for power. Biden, a moderate for decades, is now pandering to the far left base (which he doesn't identify with) in order to be elected.
I am absolutely positive that THAT is exactly what Biden &amp; Trump's owNER wants people to think TWO FALSE CATEGORIES ONLY If you don't believe the wmds russiagate incubator babies media you have to be you ABSOLUTELY have to be a Cheeto lover or a PRO-WAR Obama "democrat"üôÑ STUPID

I care more about actions and Trump, as I've described before, has done a great deal for black Americans whereas Biden has only hurt them while in office. Trump may be racist. It's possible. But Biden is overtly so.
So the Second Amendment will just go away, overnight, without YOU??  BS, Biden will not take our guns.  You are so desperate with another SCARE tactic.  Just resign and save us the trouble of an Election!!!

I always respected you,but I am so disappointed because your remarks are racist.Whoever Joe Biden pics as his running mate will not be about race it will be about who is the most intelligent and who fits the vice president position .shame on you ,you should know better
As long as Biden destroys DJT on 11/3, we're good.
I find this very racist I am surprised ,and disappointed at C cup
That "God" guy REALLY should get Mexico to pay for a wall like the one in D.C.. Damn, if Biden is now after God's a$$.... ain't nobody safe...js
He's saying the Latino community is rich and diverse, but discourse tends to center on the black community. If you actually think Biden meant "blacks have no culture" you've got epic brain worms.
People like you will defend Biden even if he eats living children in front of a camera. First step act resulted in MANY black Americans being released early for good behavior. Biden, conversely, put them in prison. Biden is the racist one.
Do you mean Biden? Biden has a history fighting for school segregation, voting against civil rights measures, &amp; devastating black Americans with his 1994 crime bill. And the silent majority is real. Studies show Republicans and conservatives are far less likely to reveal beliefs.
After watching POTUS &amp; Biden speak lately, Bush II looks like the most eloquent SOB ever! ü§£
What great legacy? You mean devastating black Americans with his 1994 crime bill? Or fighting to maintain school segregation? Or selling out American jobs to foreign factories? Biden has zero positive accomplishments in about 5 decades.
Biden's ad neglects to explain HOW he would do a better job handling the virus. He and other democrats called Trump's China ban "xenophobic", implying their response would have been more delayed.
Holy shit, look how damn racist Biden is! Just as I said before. Nothing new and nothing surprising if you've been following him. But still disturbing. Media doesn't care, though. The double standard is also disturbing.
What does that have to do with child raping? You must be either refering to Bill Clinton or Biden.
Trump has been going up in the polls and in approval rating as of late. And Biden needs many good advisers because he has no ability to lead without them pulling all the strings.
You never seen Biden speak? The man can't handle interviews without blowing up on somebody or stuttering like crazy or forgetting facts.
Orange man bad. That's all you people have. Biden is such an unworthy candidate it's painful to watch him. And if you don't believe me, fine. Take it from Johns Hopkins.
Jesus shut the fuck up with this nonsense. Maybe Biden could listen and help himself by supporting incredibly popular policy! Why is it the fault of Biden‚Äôs critics for asking for more, and not Biden himself for refusing to get behind policies popular with voters?
Let me just say that if Biden WAS powerful enough to actually hurt God, maybe the smart money would be to follow him instead.
If there is a God, Trump will be watching Biden as POTUS from a prison cell.  Narcissists are always the victims in their own eyes.
Trump just says things and throws ‚Äústuff‚Äù out there to see what will stick or what he can make people believe. Biden wants to hurt God? What?
Far from it. You've shown to be incapable of critical thinking but quick to support articles you've likely not read yourself. And you have no idea abour the majority of the facts I describe, such as Trump vs Biden's record. You're such a waste of my time, I shouldn't bother.
Trump‚Äôs one to talk about ‚Äúno religion‚Äù! If I‚Äôm not mistaken, Biden is a lifelong Catholic. What religion is Trump? The few marbles he has left are going fast. ‚ÄúHurt God‚Äù? Seriously? #25thAmendmentNow #MAGA
Michelle Obama! Biden would completely clean Trump‚Äôs clock and Democrats would surge down the ballot. We want Michelle! #MichelleObama
Countdown until Trump claims Biden is going to turn everyone gay.
Our non-religious president says Joe Biden, a lifelong Catholic, will hurt God? That's a pretty impressive superpower.
Some receipts for that claim, btw:
The right is claiming that Biden is going to do a lot of things that most people on the left actulaly want and are upset because nobody believes Biden will do a single one of them.
I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm probably in a bubble with my politics, but I sure haven‚Äôt seen any organic Joe Biden support down in Seattle.
ok, that's completely fair - my failure to acknowledge the very real and present threat to people from even the Democratic party.  But I don't know of any case in which that harm would be greater under Biden than under Trump.
Honestly, sometimes my biggest worry is all the so-called "leftists" that behave as if they think Biden is worse than Trump. yeah, Biden is not a great candidate and I don't expect him to bring much, but at this point, not being actively malicious is a huge step up.
Call me when fact-checkers find half as many Biden lies as they've found for Trump (well past 12,000 now).
Joe Biden - Hero For Our Time  via
Why do you think they're dragging their feet on pandemic relief? They know they're going to lose big in November and want to make things as difficult as possible for President Biden and the Democrats. Party before country, always! #MAGA
You actually believe all the polls off-hand. That's so embarrassingly simple-minded of you. You're right, though! We'll chat in 3 months when we are better off and Biden has retired. I won't forget about you.
This isn't even my speculation. This is fact. Look into it. Biden's virtual rallies get an embarrassing, abysmal turnout. Trump supporters are knocking on hundreds of thousands if not millions of doors a week while Biden supporters do none of that. You're in for a rude awakening.
He's not a great orator but he's infinitely better and less painful to listen to than Biden. I can't wait for the debates. Biden's team is already trying to get him out of it.
Biden, after nearly 5 decades as a politician, has a whopping ZERO accomplishments that have benefitted America. That's not even an exaggeration. He's that bad.
There's no chance Biden would remember all those words in the right order.
Ask Biden to say mental fitness or recount his fond memories of his hairy legs at the pool and kids jumping on his lap.
Huh? He already passed his cognitive test. Biden won't take one because he'd fail epically.
You have it backwards. Biden forgets things like Obama's name and enjoys recounting fond memories of his hairy legs at the pool and kids jumping on his lap.
Trump has expressed he's looking forward to the debates. People close to Biden are recommending he doesn't debate Trump. Do your research and try again.
Biden is a remarkably unworthy candidate. No accomplishments in about 5 decades. Anyone who votes for him must want to doom this country
Biden forgot Obama's name. And he enjoys going on tangents recounting fond memories of his hairy legs and kids jumping on his lap.
Biden can't handle even softball questions. And he enjoys recounting fond memories of his hairy legs and children jumping on his lap. Biden is a remarkably unworthy candidate. That's why Democrats are not making this election about him. They are making it against Trump.
As Trump supporters we have nothing to worry about. Look at the above post. Nobody is voting for Biden. They are voting against Trump. The enthusiasm gap is huge. No one likes Sleepy dementia-ridden Joe.
Washed-up hack  has already warned us that a Biden victory would mean ‚Äúthe end of America as we have known it‚Äù. About damn time!
I believe it is. I'm so horribly sad and angry at how we are being regarded. I know Biden has our support; but we all need to get out there and make sure our vote counts. In Washington State in King County (where Seattle is), only about 27% voted. That's total-not just dems. WOW
I don't think you understand. We aren't in love with the POTUS. However, we're sure as hell more enthusiastic about him than people are about Biden. He's needed now because the alternative is a puppet for the far left lunacy, lawlessness, open borders, and domination by China.
Nah, you can't top Biden's insane ramblings.
Joe Biden doesn't have to be held to any standard,he is the high standard that others need to be held to
Trump fundraising numbers way up, over Biden in July. Don't fall for this distraction.
Did you see the Fox News interview in which Biden sent his wife to do the talking for him? How immasculating! How pathetic! Nobody like that should be president. #Trump2020Landslide
Biden and his supporters ignore his deteriorating mental state. Biden claims he has taken cognitive tests. Has he? #BidenTakeTheTest  #Trump2020  #MAGA2020
My family took an 11 night road trip from New Orleans through Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina...we did not encounter 1 Biden sign.  In Fernandina Beach the guy who told my family we set up to close to them on the beach..likely Biden voter
Keep pushing the message that Biden is a blithering idiot. It‚Äôs going to work out great.
We will see how you are doing in 20 years. Ya can't get much balder... But you can have a lot of mental decline.  Biden, However, has spoken like this for decades due to his stutter. ps- You're an A$$
Biden 2020: [laughing]
Stop lying. I already told you about his exec orders to promote education and development in minority communities and exec order to massively fund historically black colleges and universities. That's already more than Biden.  Biden has your vote, though, or you ain't black!
Seriously? Trump would pulverize Biden. His only hope for a debate win against POTUS would be the "Trump-is-a-bully" media blitz that would inevitably occur thereafter.
We know he lies. So does Biden. The difference is Biden has no accomplishments. He's never done anything good for the nation or the world.
Nah, Biden has an abysmal foreign policy record. China is rooting for Biden. They despise Trump for his hard stance against them while Hunter Biden has dealings with Chinese banks. Biden will let China walk all over us
All that you've had is a tenuous-at-best claim that Trump is a pedo when Clinton is clearly complicit. Biden has also had sexual assault charges and touches kids. You're a joke, Caroline. Go waste someone else's time with your silliness.
Will Biden be a friend of BLM? Or is he just pandering to the left crowds as much as possible? Biden dramatically increased police power, immunities, he militarized them, and he's largely the reason why black Americans don't trust police today. Supporting him is a contradiction.
Obama's accomplishments. That's fine. I voted for him twice. But he's not one of the presidential candidates. Show a photo of Biden next to a list of his accomplishments. It'll just be a photo of Biden with no words at all. üòÇüòÇ
Sorry I'm a centrist Except for I mean a REAL centrist NOT someone who profits off of War and the death and suffering of human beings through Healthcare like Hillary or Biden for Pelosi and Schumer and desperately tries to call themselves centrist ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Being addicted doesn't make one immoral. Often addiction is the result of a trauma or injury. If we had a health care system as well as a prison industrial complex. More people, would avoid using the hateful slur that Biden so carelessly tosses around like a cheap whore
So if Trump wins, it won't matter to him because he'll have another 4 years to trample our constitution and consolidate power.  If Biden wins, Repugnicons will blame him and the Dems.  Either way, America will lose when it all comes crashing down.
This is what it's come to? Very old men bragging about their cognitive test scores while the country burns?
Job creation under Obama/Biden was done through measures passed by Congress. See how easy that was? We can both play that game. And Biden's still done nothing. Btw, Trump's exec orders didn't go through Congress. And he has MANY exec orders.
Lower medicine prices. He initiated the W-GDP for women. Exec orders to help education and development of minority areas. Sickle cell anemia research. Prison reform releasing many worthy black inmates (contrary to Biden). Reinstated massive donations HBCUs. Look into it. Bye now.
You posted a slightly different one though. Idc. No, it's not incorrect. Name one positive accomplishment from Biden which is uniquely his, instead of attributing Obama's accomplishments to him. Trump just helped all Americans relying on medicine and Medicaid. He's done way more.
You posted this same statement almost verbatim a second time... It doesn't matter. Biden has been in office for 5 decades and has accomplished less than Trump did in 3.5.
I was speaking about Biden. Biden did nothing as a senator. And as a VP, to attribute Obama's accomplishments to Biden is silly and inaccurate.
He's been a defendant but not convicted. Biden sexually assaulted a woman by the name of Tara Reade. Does that matter to you? I'm sure it doesn't.
He's hoping he'll get a cabinet spot... but Biden has to win for that to happen.  Hedging bets is never a great way to prepare for your next job... just ask not-secretary-of-defense Rep. Adam Smith.
Ted Nugent Demands Biden Campaign Stop Playing ‚ÄúWang Dang Sweet Poontang‚Äù at Events
JOE BIDEN who then appoints Elizabeth to get it done!
Funny how Biden accomplished NOTHING until he became Obama's VP. Even then, it was Obama behind the actions. Biden was a glorified cheerleader. Trump continued to produce jobs even more rapidly than expected after taking office, and job recovery is going well during COVID.
Biden fought for school segregation, pushed war on drugs and 1994 crime bill which both devastated black Americans, created police immunities, militarized police, has an abysmal foreign policy record, and sold our factory jobs overseas. Electing him is a national death sentence.
I don't love Trump, I like him enough to elect him because he is right about enough issues while Biden is the least worthy presidential candidate this country has seen within the life span of any American currently living.
Me too but I'm disguising myself as a "Progressive" so I don't even campaign I just let the nonpartisan ruling class controlled media smear my opponent That's how Biden &amp; Hillary do it The Cheeto is part of their team as well &amp; is the projected winner as was planned long ago ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Who? Did we have a POTUS between BHO and Biden?
Oh that's true. He finally condemned them after lots of mounting pressure. It took democrats such a long time and still barely any have done so. Some leftists were angry with Biden for condemning it.
More like Biden forgetting his lines constantly and forgetting Obama's name after serving as his VP for 8 years. My point stands. Tell me why we should trust these people when they've already proven to be untrustworthy? Showing up at their private residence is tasteless.
I know that he was drummed out of the election the first time for multiple acts of plagiarism but I'm pretty sure Biden really said this and really meant it when he said it Of course he doesn't remember it at all but he really meant it ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

Tamara Keith and Amy Walter on Trump‚Äôs ad messaging, Biden‚Äôs VP choice
Biden worked with pro-segregation Senators like Strom Thurmond to keep schools segregated. His crime bill devastated black Americans, he militarized police, and made comments like "you ain't black" to show he hasn't changed. Supporting him and BLM is a contradiction.
Also they haven‚Äôt worked out the choreography... for when the Biden staffers completely spontaneously start singing ‚ÄúHillary‚Äù.   Laugh if you will, I still remember ‚ÄúBig Structural Bailey‚Äù. üòè
There's nothing solid against Trump for pedo charges. It's all ridiculous wishful thinking by democrats. But I can say the same thing to you. You call Trump racist and don't even know about Biden's extremely racist history and comments.
Biden was pro-segregation of schools, working with racist Senators like Strom Thurmond. He pushed war on drugs and authored the 1994 crime bill, both devastating for black Americans. And his comments that the other party will "keep you in chains" and "you ain't black"... Come on!
You made false claims about Biden and Trump in your last post. Therefore, they both were fair-game subjects of discussion. (1/2)
But I've reviewed the evidence. There's nothing connecting Trump to Epstein's island. Can't say the same for Bill. And if you don't think Biden is racist, you haven't looked into his record as a politician, like at all.

Uhh ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äù, or rather  Biden twitter team,you do realize there is new fangled apps out there now that allow a person to pre-load and post tweets at scheduled times?? So...President Trump doesn‚Äôt need to tweet on Monday morning for it to appear on Monday...  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I wish the Republicans would just put up another option because then there might be a better choice for our future. Biden isn't good either. We need someone who can bridge gaps and get people together
Don‚Äôt let facts get in the way of a good narrative. Nearly 50% of republicans and 88% of democrats support M4A.

Much of the campaign seems to be linked to a variety of Republican operatives and activists, intent on putting West on the ballot with the belief that he will take African American votes away from Joe Biden.

I'm with you. I can't believe there are people who would be willing to vote for Kanye. However, the head-scratchier I have, is how would that siphon votes away from Biden? With all the press coverage of Kanye sucking up to Trump, would he be more attractive to a Trump voter?
US intelligence says Russia seeking to 'denigrate' Biden
Haha this reminds me of your Joe Biden stories...
Agreed. I sincerely doubt there will be even the slightest hint of that from Biden‚Äôs campaign. But we‚Äôve already seen the total lack of consequences when Trump does it.
what she said. not voting for biden is asking for 4 more years of descent into authoritarianism. Your dad is rolling in his grave.
I was raised in a country Christian church. I do not care about the religious background of any candidate. I care about personal ethics; Biden has plenty of those. That he has a strong connection to the Catholic church is fine. Trump? He has NO ethics, so case closed.#VoteJoe!
It is truly unfortunate that I have to choose between the lesser of two evils. I hate it. My vote for Biden is not a vote celebrating him, it‚Äôs a vote against someone who has 163,000 deaths on his hands and counting.
Especially, as is in most cases, they are so insanely bad at voter outreach. They aren't helping get votes for Biden with these defenses, only allow people like me the opportunity to explain why people shouldn't.  I'd say it's counter-productive to their goal but not to mine.
Almost. Those 12,000 troops in Germany won't re-list until next year. And if Biden wins (God Almighty, I hope!), he can reverse the order.
What if #Biden turns the election on its head &amp; chooses Michelle Obama as his VP?
When Biden announces his VP (tomorrow?) we will all rally around her because this isn't about our feelings, are we all clear on this?
The people who support Hillary and Biden don't think.  Most feel that they are benefiting from the old status quo and they want to protect that. And nothing more.
There is plenty of tangible evidence of Bernie's popularity in donor records and volunteers, and almost /none/ for Biden.  The idea that Biden could pull off a full sweep when a solid opponent is evident is laughable./

President Trump attacking Joe Biden for misconduct with respect to Ukraine is a good example. President Trump WAS IMPEACHED for wrongdoing with respect to Ukraine. He and the GOP have since apparently tried to confuse people into thinking somehow that was Joe Biden.

Biden ACTUALLY KNOWS verses from the Bible. Trump has NEVER READ IT, and curses it in private. Which side are you on, John? You're running out of time to choose.
The right answer is for Biden to reject external meddling in our elections by foreign countries (even if in his favor) because that's both illegal and un-American.   Then he should challenge the president to do the same.

These last few months of the drumpf regime are all about him preserving "his wealth" and avoiding prison for various financial felonies.  I suspect that Hatch Act violations and treason of one kind or another will be pardoned by President Biden to help heal the nation a bit.
Biden made a voluntary pledge to select a woman for VP. Fine. But I think it would be have been wise to consider a few blokes such as Andrew Cuomo or Adam Schiff. Maybe still go with Warren or Harris in the end. But I don‚Äôt see what the value was in making that early pledge.

Oh yeah I know, I was talking about Biden. The fact they have so much in common is pretty telling
Republican propaganda machine confirms that scaring people to death with doctored images of BLM protest videos is helping Trump's campaign close the gap! Dah! Hitler perfected this years ago.
The story is that Russia is interfering to help Trump while China is interfering to help Biden yet the headline from  focused exclusively on the angle that feeds an anti-Trump attack. How curious.
This--but I had the same complaint with HRC's treatment in 2016.  Yeah, Biden sometimes makes a gaffe, but Trump says /deliberately/ awful things ALL THE TIME!
I think politics in 2020 is generally pretty sour, but that's beside the point.  To claim Biden's VP pick is going to being uniquely scrutinized and that it's only because of her gender is a bad faith effort to shut down even substantive criticisms.

How to push Biden on ussues? e got LBJ a Texan racist to pass Civil Rights. Civil disobedience, a strong Progressive Senate, pressure on elected officials. Supporting journalist to expose corporate donors. End citizens United, the filibuster, electoral college. etc.  Use MoveOn
Trump says: Joe Biden is Against God  via
The same way we got LBJ a Texan racist to pass Civil Rights. Civil disobedience, a strong Progressive Senate, pressure on elected officials. Supporting journalist to expose corporate donors. End citizens United, the filibuster, electoral college. etc.  Vote Biden or for Nazis.
Or we could have fought the fascist that way.   Never voting for Biden.
I hate Mitch so much but if the Dems can successfully win with this pivot to Never Trump conservatives (like her and Biden are doing) this country is fucked.
I think you have a typoüëá  If you can't beat *Biden fair and square you play dirty politics.  - withhold funding from Ukraine for dirt on opponent's child - suing Nevada to prevent mail-in ballots during a pandemic - getting Kanye on ballots in key states
Joe Biden just said what every Dem thinks about the black community. He didn't sugarcoat it. You either vote with the Dems or you aint black...
Joe Biden will be included?
Biden is SO powerful in Trump‚Äôs delusional and desperate mind.ü§Ø
YES. This is chess strategy not checkers.  If we get Biden in we can lobby, protest, write policy, pressure our new (hopefully) progressive Senate for change.  If you don't vote Biden and Trump wins Progressives will be lined up and shot by Barr's Brownshirts.  Poof, no more USA.
I don‚Äôt either. The bar is set so low for Biden. If he even managed to complete one coherent sentence people would attempt to claim he ‚Äúwon‚Äù the debate.
Either way we get that since Biden is the blue trump
And why wouldn't you? Biden is RepubliCon Lite.
Democrats could be right on every single issue but as long as they push the abortion agenda I will never support one. Joe Biden betrayed his faith for votes at the expense of the most innocent and vulnerable lives.
biden is AS BAD
The US had 23 operational aluminum smelters in 1993. We are now at 5. So yeah we need Aluminum from Canada. I hope Biden starts building plants that we used to have early in late 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs for steel, Aluminum, etc.
Biden was talking about his hairy legs when he was campaigning in Sept 2019 and Trump was absolutely president then so maybe Biden is bad for Biden hmm
There has to be a back story in his position...if kids don't go to school, parents can't go to work...the liberal dems are afraid that Trump's plans for a robust economy and the vaccine on the horizon spells doom for Biden.
Weird that you didn't consider this triggering when you've been berating a woman all morning about voting for Biden AND you claim to be a regular viewer of mine  I talk about how I'm a rape victim on my stream daily
Joe Biden is not in a place to claim moral authority, even over a monster like Trump.  That's kind of why we were having a primary until your old guard called in favors.  So now voters get to deal with the predictable falllout of your strategically inept 'leaders'.
Then Biden's attitude toward god isn't important either.
Biden is the blue trump. You're delusional if you can't see that...
Based on inappropriate groping in /countless/ videos, and the monsters that Biden befriends in both parties, there is an equally real possibility Biden raped children. Further "killed 150,000 Americans", relies on the assertion that /none/ would have died under a dem presidency.
If you think that's Biden, you're delusional beyond belief.
You ain't black.  Hispanics are diverse, unlike blacks.                                                  Joe Biden
I literally tell people to vote for Biden on my stream but ok
Joe Biden is a racist
Also the idea that the establishment can't be criticized without constant affirmation that I will vote for Biden is gross
And again, that‚Äôs what Dodd wants in a VP- not necessarily Biden. But it‚Äôs still the impression was my point.
apparently criticizing Biden = accelerationism
what we have been slowly learning about Joe Biden is that when he sees a person of color he automatically goes to what is this person on why are they sweating why are their eyes dilated even if they're not this in is his brain, what he thinks
Joe Biden is a racist. A real racist. The comments he made yesterday are just the latest in a long list of racist comments he's made over the course of his political career.   This is the 2nd blatantly racist comment Biden has made about black people during this campaign.
Right now and if you cannot trump will make sure you can today not 4 or 8 or 30 years from now people today means right now.... Vote for Joe Biden and you will be a permanent prisoner in your homes under joes lockdown.
...left a bit over the years (for votes or through personal change who knows), but in this country, the Trumplicans call Biden a communist and Kasich a left wing RINO.  That‚Äôs freakin scary
You know what‚Äôs nuts though? I used Kasich as an example because on the L-R political scale, he‚Äôs probably a +7 or 8 on a 10pt scale so I would never in my life consider someone that far right.  Biden, if you look at his history is probably a +2 or 3 though he‚Äôs come to the ...
The irony is, Rick Wilson could probably do more for Biden‚Äôs credibility if he was still attacking him as a godless leftist.
I think every American alive free right now should for one run Joe Biden and his murder team right out of Washington black white brown yellow I don't care what color you are your rights are no different than mine vote for trump &amp; you will live those rights today not next year or
Bernie WAS our compromise! MANY of us are much further left than Bernie. We were just willing to compromise that far. That's as far right as we're willing to compromise. Not to mention, Biden isn't willing to compromise at all so why the fuck should we compromise further?
'Are You a Junkie?': Biden Goes Off the Rails After Interviewer Asks About Cognitive Test
This is stunning. Who could Biden possibly pick for the most ineffectual of all cabinet positions that would sway your vote to the idiotic sociopath currently driving our country nose-first into fascism?
2020 Twitter is that hellscape where people argue their vote for Biden is strictly dependent on his VP pick between...  ...UN Ambassador Susan Rice and Sen. Kamala Harris.   Not now, folks, not now.
Meanwhile, Biden won‚Äôt support m4a. The space between Ds and Rs at this point is paper thin
This is what the Tea Party, aka future Trump voters thought of our 1st black POTUS.  Biden defended him for 8 years against this crap.  #BlackVote
Not with Biden. If you believe it will, I've got ocean front property in Arizona for ya.
While you're so busy convincing everyone how racist Biden is let me remind you that Biden had no problem working under a black man.
My pick is Susan Rice. 2nd is Harris. If the younger generation read up on Susan  Rice, they would know she has so much experience in a lot of categories, they would want her as the VP. Biden knows Susan Rice. They worked together for 8 years with a President who was amazing.
i have no choice but to vote for biden bc in 2016 washington almost flipped red and i aint having that
And these people are?   Biden spent 8 years defending Obama from future Trump voters.
Black Vote is a American vote that vote should never be for a black hater like joe Biden TRUMP at least will babble his racism if any.  Joe is a sneezy sleepy kind of superjim wannabe chicken gorge whos your friend one minute and a corrupted lying racist the next all in secret
Then to begin with, Biden must declare unconditional no-first-use policy and take ICBMs off hair-trigger alert.
This was my biggest concern with Biden, but I‚Äôm hopeful that he won‚Äôt give in to that. There needs to be a thorough examination across the executive branch. Those institutions need serious reforms.
And? For F‚Äôs sake. How many times does this man need to be accused of all sorts of sexual crimes before a Trump supporter gets it?  A typical response is A picture of Biden kissing the top of a child‚Äôs head,  not bragging he can just grab a woman by the p*ssy!
You MUST be joking! If Biden won't move left to unite the party, news certainly not going to move left when he no longer needs our votes. He promised his donors nothing would change.
Presidency is &amp; always will be a team effort. With Trump it's a team of Vipers. Biden will be president. Won't be golfing &amp; letting Jared &amp; co. run the country. He'll be hands on. Biden's will be a team of heroes walking us out of the Trump Virus, division, &amp; lawlessness of T era
But. Biden is imploding.
I‚Äôll vote Joe Biden if Anita Hill is the VP
Same and as an impressionable youth it's pushing me away from biden
LOL Joe Biden eats his words.
That doesn't mean Biden isn't 100% for keeping it illegal so he can continue filling the prison labor force with Black and Brown slaves. He's a racist POS and "nothing will change".
I honestly think Biden does not wa to to win
Joe Biden's Campaign Has Knocked Zero Doors, Trump's Knocks on Millions a Week

I have no faith in Florida. There‚Äôs no way Biden is winning any of your toss ups. It‚Äôs going to be a squeaker.
no sorry, you DONT GET IT.  Do you really think that Biden is going to destroy womens rights, environment, 1st amendement protections, etc? Quit throwing your little temper tantrum and think about future generations!!
since it keeps coming up, who is this group of undecided voters that is silently reading all of left Twitter's tweets on Biden and using this as their basis for whether or not they should vote for him
Similarly I'm not going to accept Joe Biden's smear of Tara Reade who he raped. I'm a rape victim and feminist and to demand that I 'shut up, take Biden, and smile' is vile on so many levels. I refuse to accept rape culture.  He gets my vote, that's it.
Joe Biden and the democrat party IS THE SOCIALIST PARTY which is burning down this country. If YOU want to continue the BURNING, I guess you'll go with Joe. The rest of the country won't! VOTE PRESIDENT TRUMP‚ÄºÔ∏è

I think Joe Biden really cares about the black community. And I bet he's willing and happy to listen to black people's concerns.  I made a video about learning to be better during political hot topic discussions.
On Nov 3rd the Black community will send you a very clear message of who is worthy of their vote and it will not be you. The black community long ago recognized you for the self-aggrandizing racist you are and the margin Joe Biden will win the black vote by will embarrass you.
And you Biden won't do anything to hold Israeli governments accountable. Has he even said the word 'Palestinian' on the campaign trail (to the extent he can be understood to be actively campaigning)?

A Biden Administration Will Have to Confront Trump‚Äôs Corruption via
Biden both politically and mathematically has to pick someone younger as his running mate, and is already part of the power center, so he can prioritize shaping a party leadership to carry Democrats forward, but we're 12 years behind where that project should be.
There is also a large group of other Democrats (see virtually everybody who ran other than Biden, Sanders, and Warren), but they were all vying to unseat Biden as the heir apparent, there was no feeling that they were vying to lead the Obama wing of the party.
The power center of the Democratic Party is still very much Clinton Democrats like Biden and, well, the Clintons. There's an internal opposition to that base in the left (Sanders, AOC, Ilhan, sometimes Warren, etc), but that's very much an opposition to the power center.
Speaking as a progressive, it sure seems a lot of us have forgotten about PROGRESS. Joe Biden might not appoint any progressive justices, but Trump absolutely won‚Äôt and you‚Äôre trolling yourself if you think any other candidate has a chance with 3 months left before Election Day.
Out of power #Republicans are deficit hawks, in power they run up colossal deficits, usually in the form of tax cuts for the wealthy without positive investments in education and infrastructure. To save us, #Biden will have to run huge deficits.

Trump says he saved millions of lives? That's insanity!! Trump has literally killed 160,000 people so far. Is he really proud of that number? Jesus!! Grab the wheel! Vote Biden to save our nation and save our lives!
Well then... You will be voting for Biden? Cuz Trump has created this entire disaster. All on his watch!! We are bankrupt. We are sick and dying. And we are divided.   Again, all happened on Trump's watch. Don't blame Dems for your idiot President and pathetic administration.

Biden is just fine. He can literally kick back in his recliner! Your boy on the other hand just has to open his mouth to dig himself deeper every minute of the day. When Biden does come out to debate, he is gonna cook your boy. You will see.
That will really be up to President Biden. Your boy Trump can't manage a McDonald's at this point. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I believe Biden's victory in November is already priced into the markets.  I don't believe the Democrats winning the senate has been priced into the market yet so perhaps the markets will climb higher once it's become more evident that will happen.
You're right. There has never been a debate has there?  Tells you all about Biden.

I wish I had faith that Biden would protect USPS.
What an ignorant thing to say. I mean really ignorant. He does know who his boss‚Äôs circle of friends are, right? Joe Biden is widely respected by members on both sides of the isle who worked with him when he was in our US Senate. Our Congress NEEDS someone who KNOWS how to fix it
Isn't this dictator wannabe type of stuff? Hopefully Biden wins in November! Come February of 2021, Biden should require all Trump properties be sold or shut down too! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
got a well deserved promotion - the 4-6pm slot on MSNBC, 2 hours of intelligent discussion and smart information. I DVR the girl every day.. hopefully this will be enough to prevent her from becoming Biden's Press Secretary.. I'm selfish..
Yes President Biden!!! Thank you! It's pretty scary knowing Trump is trying to hurt our kids now. Even more scary that Trump is now killing his own friends!
Mr. Biden, I am looking forward to putting the racists back in their closets for good. I want every single American to be equal! Under Trump, we are divided beyond words.
Thank you soon to be President Biden! I just look forward to getting a good night's sleep soon! Before I go to bed with Trump as POTUS, I have to worry about getting nuked, the pandemic, and if I have a job tomorrow!
Um, why do anything when the president is so disastrously incompetent he makes the case for being voted out several times a day? I mean, Trump does no work, why should Biden, who btw, isn't president right now.
Lol there you go again thinking biden is president.
Lol it‚Äôs hilarious these people don‚Äôt want debates... it‚Äôs bc they know Biden stands no chance on a stage with Trump
cannot recover from his deficit unless he changes his entire personality.  Highly unlikely!!!  Sad really!  He has destroyed the Republican Party. Hoping Larry Hogan can rebuild it.  Biden will do a good job until then.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Are you kidding me? Biden supporters are smart, and avoiding the pandemic by following the request of professionals. Trump on the other hand is busy killing friends like Herman Cain.  You know what's sad? Trump.

You raised the government debt by $6 trillion which is actually a $6 trillion tax increase because the only way you can pay off debt is by raising taxes.  So you cut taxes now and got the accolades and Biden will have to raise taxes to pay off the DEBT YOUR TAX CUTS created.

C'mon. There won't be any debates this year, but it's not Biden who's incapable of pulling it off.
He can't make any decisions. Common here. Better say "Clintons", "Obama", "Democrats", but not Joe Biden. He is not capable of doing anything right now.
So sad to see where your priorities are when you have an election coming up!!! You are making OUR choice easier everyday! BIDEN
Is his opponent decent then?  Is Biden going to work miracles?  Did Obama? American politics has been the same now for decades I don‚Äôt believe you can single Trump out.
They would be better opponents than Biden!
There are some positive things here!! Trump just pissed away over 30,000,000 18-24 year old voters.... Rest assured, Biden will bring it back!!
Along with Biden, worse VP in history. What a pair. Still can't get Obama to go away. Most past Presidents don't appear in public like he does that I can recall. Just keeps popping up like Hillary. Talk about not accepting vote results, Hillary wins the blue ribbon!
I guess this means that I'm 90, no 100 percent sure that I'm voting for Biden because Trump is a fascist making me antifa!
This will only lead to Biden using Ke$ha's TikTok as a campaign theme song
He's criticizing vote by mail so his voters will vote in person and Biden voters will vote by mail. Then his minion that runs the USPS will shut down mail delivery in swing states, disenfranchising Biden voters and getting himself reelected.
Ummmmmm... You didn't beat Obama. If Obama had run, he would have mopped you on the floor. And let's get real here. If Hillary had won, we wouldn't have 150,000 Americans buried! You will NOT win in November Trump! Biden is gonna mop ya on the floor.

I meant elected not re-elected. Biden will be black mailed along with the rest of the Dems who are beholden. Therefore they will not represent us but China. We have to stop them.

Breaking News Don!! Because of your incompetence, we have over 150,000 dead Americans, and that number is going up. Don't blame Biden fool!! Biden is not the President yet! You are! I guarantee if Biden was POTUS, he would have saved alot of lives.
Biden and Obama... Sigh.. I sure miss going to sleep not worrying about getting nuked, or dying from a pandemic! I miss being able to go to work and enjoy going out on the town on my days off. I miss not having to see friends die from the pandemic. Biden is going to win.

I think Joe Biden should be able to ask China, Iran, and other countries for help in the election!!! I mean, if Trump can ask for foreign assistance in an election, so should Biden! Truth is, Biden is gonna win fair and square! Even with Trump trying to cheat! Bye Don the Con!
We the people are going to win the election big time, by voting Biden in as our new President! Everyone knows you are desperate to get elected again, because the minute you leave this job, your nightmare of prison is certain. Suck it up orange buttercup! GAME OVER!!

This is absolutely horrifying! We have been warned folks! If I have to stand in line for a month hooked up to a portable ventilator to vote, I will!! I refuse to allow this evil man to spend an extra day or year in that job! Vote Biden!!
Really? Biden is the moral bastion you want to hold up as an example?
He sees the internal polling. Repubs, as well as himself are going to get routed. So, he is going to do everything he can to try and contest the election. Do not be surprised if Biden wins be 5-10% and then Trump sues and tries to use the 12th amendment to overturn the election.
I'm more certain now that Trump won't win in November than I was in 2016. And in 2016 I was 98.7% sure he wasn't going to beat Hillary. Biden is going to win in a runaway. Not cause he's better than Trump, but because Trump keeps being an idiot on Twitter.

Biden was polling at 5.4% before the IA caucus, and then dropped out after placing fifth, behind Clinton, Obama, Edwards, and Bill Richardson.
That's not historically how it has worked though, and setting up new rules for a certain candidate to fail at is biased. Joe Biden himself was selected for the VP after withdrawing after the IA caucus in 2008. Probably polling poorly, which is why he didn't want to go on to NH.

This is good. Trump will see this and want to debate. And then Trump will self destruct in a debate against Biden.
Yes Biden should sign onto... checks notes... a bunch of slogans that don‚Äôt have a chance of passing even with a Democrat controlled senate.  Rightttt, you know Bernie ran on these policies and lost right?
Eight years of steady leadership and sensible regulation did more for prosperity than Bush's deregulation or whatever the fuck Trump's plan to the extent that he has one is.  This is why I vote for centrist mainstream Democrats like Biden, Obama, and Clinton.

Also this.
Bernie folk will just revise history to fit their narrative.  They pretend that Biden was in 4th place after SC and that Pete and Amy had booming successful campaigns. Meanwhile in real life, Biden vaulted to 2nd place in delegates and 1st in popular vote.
Also, with the exception of NV; the other two were essentially ties and Biden blew Bernie out of the water in SC.   So of course it had a huge effect.  Larger state, wins every county and CD...sooo
This is patently false.  Biden was in second place after SC.  Die mad Berner
The funny thing is, Biden was in 2nd place after South Carolina.
After SC, Biden was in second place in delegates. I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt understand how things work.

1) Biden has nothing to do with Clinton 2) If guilty Dems would want him prosecuted 3) Trump admin keeps kids in cages and separated them from parents WITHOUT TRACKING THEM 4) Trump bragged about walking in on naked and half-dressed underage girls

Racist Trump is going to try and outflank right wing Biden on this....
I know little of the experience of these women, but considering Biden's age, and that if he dies the VP becomes President, the VP needs to be someone who has governing or legislative experience.
How is this problematic and Biden on the floor of the senate explaining his commitment to defunding social security is just politics or whatever? I don't get it.
C'mon. There won't be any debates this year, but it's not Biden who's incapable of pulling it off.

The same for Biden both Obamba andBiden ware as a fact not working for America but other countries. Obama took a knee and bowed to other leaders. Trump got so much more done in first 3/1/2 yrs then they did in 8 yrs. Let‚Äôs learn from that instead of voting for the failures again
I meant elected not re-elected. Biden will be black mailed along with the rest of the Dems who are beholden. Therefore they will not represent us but China. We have to stop them.

The only way this election season isn't gonna be an absolute disaster is if Biden wins by a Texas sized landslide
The right answer is for Biden to reject external meddling in our elections by foreign countries (even if in his favor) because that's both illegal and un-American.   Then he should challenge the president to do the same.
Pelosi said Biden came from a very devout Christian family. Put this coven ring leader in your prayers also. She mocks The Most High God the most. Add pp while you are at it.

Russia is very good at this and Joe Biden will figure out how to talk about it well.
Caring would be awesome. Joe Biden would care.  However, we also should learn to speak in better ways to Donald Trump fans, because they too are Americans.

It isn't about if the NRA is good or bad (the NRA is several organizations and this wouldn't dissolve the NRA all up) it's about giving ammo to Trump 90 days before an election. Why not wait? Gun control is not politically advantageous. This hurts Biden.
You're absolutely right (as usual) - there are still several factors that can play out to Trump's favor: MI, PA and WI must go for Biden. These are again critical states to win.
Biden tries to clarify remarks suggesting lack of diversity in the Black community

When I wonder how people can defend Trump, coming in with, "Biden's worse" is textbook whataboutism. It ignores the original topic and attempts to deflect criticism to another target.  If you're unable to defend Trump, fine, but you can miss me with this "B-b-b-but, Biden!" crap.
C'mon guys, you can do better than "B-b-b-but, Biden!"  I'm starting to go from disappointed to sad. Where's the pizzaz? The energy? The authentic frontier gibberish?
Depends on whether the courts allow access to his financials. If they do after this last attempt to delay, Barr will move as it will be the bigger story. (Supposedly). Biden has not done anything illegal but will take time to discredit the GOP &amp; Guluani sources
Biden should push back. Trump is a bully and he will not play fair
Biden will HUMILIATE trump. Actually, trump will HUMILIATE himself.
Opinion: ‚ÄòCrashing down‚Äô or ‚Äòbullish‚Äô? What a Biden presidency would really mean for your 401(k)
Not my words but words Trump has said to me... AND STILL HE WILL NOT TAKE THE ACTIONS NEEDED TO SAVE US FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION.... Worse yet is conservatives are slowly getting use to the idea that Biden may win... WHERE THE HELL IS THE FIGHT?WHY IS NO ONE IN JAIL?
Biden will be a better president for all of your fans. If you like Donald Trump, I welcome you to watch my video where talk about uniting all great Americans, including Trump fans and conservatives!
You claim Biden hasn't had one original thought. Trump hasn't given one small thought to the pandemic. He wants to ignore, slide past, blink and it's gone. It's not gone and he doesn't have a short or long term plan and we need both.
Tensions flare as GOP's Biden probe ramps up
Biden can t even speak his mind is deteriorating
whats wrong Biden? you wont debate cause your to afraid your gonna get your ass handed back to you?
the Left Does not have anything intelligent to say thats why Biden isn't going to debate all they do is blame  our president  what a bunch filthy cowards
Right now Biden should Debate or hes a fucking coward
Very well made! Sad, but this is what our kids are facing now that the man who has more responsibility for the well-being of Americans than anyone else in government, has betrayed his responsibility. Instead he calls moms standing up to him, "Anarchists who hate America" #Biden

That new campaign messenger er. Mgr, must not like the idea of killing the supporters. Will they listen? Doubtful. The optics of all of those dead voters won't look good at election day. Can we get their mail-in ballots and vote Biden with them? #WomenAgainstTrump #WomenForBiden
First of all, it was the tRump campaign that spread the rumor that Biden would choose a Black woman. Biden said he would choose a woman.  And we did have a free country where he could choose the person of choice. #Tuckerisracist
That basement line is getting old... Biden is out and visiting people you idiots
Biden is having a hard time agreeing to have a debate against him...and if he does time to get out the popcorn and watch that lying coward Biden get smashed and if he doesn't he's still a coward and all his other cronies making up excuses why he shouldn't debate is cowardly as F!
I am certainly not a trump supporter but I would say pack your bags. Biden couldn't beat trump if trump withdraw from the race.
Biden is a coward and a Trojan horse
Trump cannot form a coherent sentence. A debate would humiliate him and highlight his dementia. Maybe Biden and the democrats are being more compassionate than trumps own family and the GOP
Tucker: ‚ÄòProbably Illegal‚Äô for Biden to Only Consider a Black Woman VPThat didn't stop Trump who's a rabid Lemur compared to Biden.

That Trump needed to be tested for cognitive problems &amp; Biden hasn't is telling in its own right.
Joe Biden is the true racist. Numerous examples of this type of stuff throughout his long career. The Trump Train should run a video montage of his racism on display!
I think the notion that Benghazi and "the unmasking" will drive out turnout for the hard right is a bit ridiculous. Fox News may love it, but their most diligent viewers are going to turn out for Trump regardless of who Biden picks for VP. And it won't impact moderates.
Kanye amplification, Epstein focus on Clinton while ignoring the obvious, faux outrage toward Biden‚Äôs racially insensitive comment. Etc. So many examples of bad faith engagement from Trump supporters.

This ONE tweet from Biden Oct 2019 is reason alone to vote for him. #VOTE
They aren‚Äôt dug in the way that that guy described it, though. As evidenced by the Lincoln Project and similar organizations, a lot of Republicans will be voting for Biden to oust Trump.  If they weren‚Äôt, Trump wouldn‚Äôt be getting slaughtered in the polls.
I am positive I would trust Kamala Harris if she had to move into the Presidency because of Biden illness, he is 78....
I suspect bullcrap.  Nobody has put forth the names of these so called "biden donors.
Ridiculous, I suspect Biden's white hairs to be at the head of this, the rich bastards who would "let Biden" be President but want to pick his VP.
I would like to know the names of these "biden money donors" who are leaning on him heavily not to pick her.  Do they have another agenda?Does he have any dirt on Biden? ü§£
Biden Is Just As Bad If Not Worse Than Trump Quotes Republican President Mark Patrick Seymour Mitt Romney Organization

Biden's silence on recent attacks on the church  shows he's no longer worthy of the catholic and other religious groups votes.

You are delusional. How can a pandemic response be dealt with years before it even existed. It should have started in January like Biden called for instead of playing golf and doing rallies. His economic policy is a total failure and will be taught as what not to do.

At a funeral, Obama delivered a campaign speech recently trying to build up Biden, but you didn't want to mention that did you
That should tell everyone about Biden right there. I‚Äôm not black and when he said that my jaw dropped to the floor.
Let me be clear, Joe Biden is not a pedophile. He is not involved in a pedophile ring. Perpetuating this right wing nonsense does nothing but hurt you &amp; others. You might want to reach out to a good therapist. If you‚Äôd like I can send you some resources.
Biden has already brought back larry summer.  Bring back Susan rice and Rahm Emmanuel.  Therefore no change.
The tax break he gave himself and corporations has been proven it didn‚Äôt do anything for job growth or significant pay increases. So stop, you guys hated Obama so you‚Äôre giving this guy credit for the economy that Obama/Biden created. Like saying Elvis started rock n roll
Yeah he was only involved with rebuilding the economy after bush crashed it. They started a record of private sector growth 7+ yrs under Obama/Biden just under 2 years until trump blew it. They created more jobs I. Their last 3 years than trump has. So yeah I‚Äôd say he is better
idk but biden clearly isn't doing it
"If we don't respect human life...." "Biden Crime Bill"(his own words) called for the death penalty on 51 offenses, "‚ÄúEverything But Jaywalking‚Äù. Again, this is a man who has killed millions, Americans, Iraqis, Afghanis,Syrians, Ukrainians, and on and on.
RCP continually does not include polls favorable to Biden, and consistently adds Rasmussen which is very favorable to Trump.
You and Biden both say dumb shit (you have the edge by far Thigh-land).  The big difference is you DO dumb shit.
I can‚Äôt believe Joe Biden said that thing implying that african-american culture has less diversity than Mexican culture. That‚Äôs disgusting. Black communities have just as much diversity! Its great to see it
If you consider that Biden winning vs Bernie is more disheartening than Trump winning vs Biden... Because Biden will lose and we will somehow get blamed for it, even though we reluctantly vote for Biden. Would be nice to pick between good n evil instead of evil n evil for once.
I haven‚Äôt seen any Biden signs in my neck of the woods.
Months ago DNC agreed to let Globalist Elites decide their nominee... Biden would hold it ‚Ä¶ then pull out at last moment because of obvious mental disease.  It will be interesting who Globalist select... obviously Bloomberg couldn't cut it.
here it is.  It seems to me his heart is good, but he's not comfortable talking about Latinos.  What I find about him and Obama, is they talk like Latino= undocumented immigrant. like that's the only issue.  I'm curious if Latinos feel the same way.
If Joe Biden was President right now, we wouldn‚Äôt be in the terrible position we are in right now. Joe Biden would have done a better job with this pandemic. #VoteRedToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Biden is just like the slave owners who don‚Äôt understand why their slaves want off their plantations.
I will vote for #biden no matter who his VP pick is contrary to what  says she will do.

I didn't hear what #Biden said and it may or may not be of consequence my guess it's not but he could shoot the bump on 5th ave and I wouldn't give a shit. He's always had my vote and always will.
Don‚Äôt you remember what did Biden do when he was VP? Biden is a puppet of communist China! If you wanna make Communist China accountable for the ChineseVirus and human right abuses, vote
Show one piece of evidence Biden is corrupt. One story. One legit article with proof. One. Communist.

You‚Äôre thinking of Biden.
I could take all of Biden‚Äôs gaffs, put them together, and would equal one trump presser. GTFOH
There's a new sheriff in town, Jack. --biden to god
Biden doesn‚Äôt walk it. His complacency in war means he‚Äôs killed. Trying to cut social security 3 times is cruel. Selfishly denying all Americans hc is inhumane. He‚Äôs a known liar. His walk is crooked not Christian. Also, he has no biz as prez-mental decline. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
His website states that... you actually think Biden came up with that or even believes it?  He changed all of a sudden after 40 years?  I might have some ocean front property in Arizona you might be interested in.
I empathize. However, on a scenic drive into Trump country out here, I saw a lot more Biden signs than anticipated. One of those places that went Obama-Obama-Trump, which I think has a good shot at pivoting blue now. Also, tons of masks!
I know several people who are saying this, having it ready by that day isn‚Äôt to help him win the election, but because this is a hoax and it will go away when Biden wins  ... according to them üòêüòê
If President Trump said anything like what Biden said yesterday..... The Democrats and liberal media would have a cow....
Biden is being used by the left as a pawn. Its sad to see, but hopefully the American people will see it in the debates. The liberals are so delusional and there hatred for the United States shows. Real Americans see this. Trump 2020
Biden is a puppet of communist China when he was VP! Vote trump if you want to make China accountable for the ChineseVirus and other human rights abuses!
MAGA! Biden was a puppet of Communist China. Vote  if you wanna make #China accountable for the ChineseVirus!
Tremendous. Biden is a puppet of Communist China when he was VP! You are much better than him.
Most likely no unless she runs as an independant. The Dem party wouldn't stray from Biden if he's president for 4 years.
Don‚Äôt you remember what did Biden do when he was VP? Biden is a puppet of communist China!
To use your quote Biden "Could Stand In the Middle Of Fifth Avenue And Shoot Somebody And he Wouldn't Lose Any Voters" because you are done!  The difference being Biden would never do it. #RepublicansForBiden #RepublicansAgainstTrump #Biden2020

For Trump to say Biden will hurt God he better look in a mirror when you put kids in cages that is pure evil for a man to say I alone can fix things Trump just a man not God only God can change wrong to make right Trump doesn't live in a glass house to even be speaking
Did you see Biden's speech to the Latino Elected officials conference today? I'm curious of people's opinion of that appearance
What is your source of information for your assertion that the Communist Party endorses Biden?
Biden has no heart.
Okay, serious constitutional question: could Obama be Biden‚Äôs running mate? If something happened to Biden, he‚Äôs even got two years of presidential eligibility left.
When will journalists hold the Chinese government accountable? When will they hold Biden accountable?
Like how Biden gives up on black people?
Bernie said. Do I look like sheep? Only vbnmw cultists have that sheepy mindset. As much as I admire &amp; appreciate Bernie, he cannot pied piper me to Biden. I know that Biden shares none of my values. I know he‚Äôs a liar &amp; has no empathy for struggling people. #NeverBidenNeverTrump

You don‚Äôt get sued by the federal government for housing discrimination, carrying on a racist lie about Obama‚Äôs birth place, and own niece said she has heard he and her grandfather say racial epithets along with anti-Semitic words. But yeah Biden is the racist
Love this about soon to be President Biden. We need a man who knows God in the Oval Office not a clown who holds the Bible upside down in a photo op.
Harris called Biden a racist, remember the Democratic debates?
Anybody who is seriously concerned that electing Joe Biden's Thurmond-and-McCain-eulogizing ass is going to result in radical leftists controlling the country is clearly suffering from Fox News Syndrome and needs to start reading their local newspaper immediately.
The 2nd Amendment right to bear arms is in the constitution. Biden CAN' take your guns. Trump is trying to scare you because he has abandoned us to the pandemic resulting in the economy going bust. Biden is not going to defund the police. Trump is scared he'll lose the election.
How could Biden be Catholic and support abortion and isn‚Äôt he considering a Muslim as the vp?  I want Jesus to be believed, read and prayed to everyday from the White House.
No he doesn‚Äôt. Biden for President.
And for every S. E. Cupp, there are 1,000 people pretending Biden‚Äôs VP pick is the reason they just ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt‚Äù vote for Biden. I actually believe her, but I‚Äôm pretty sure those ACTUALLY in that position are beyond negligible in number.

That‚Äôs perfect. Your saying Biden is a racist trump supporter right?
Maybe you should remind ‚ÄúI only stand outside a church awkwardly‚Äù Trump when he just said Joe Biden is against God. You know Joe. The man who attends the inside of a church, who‚Äôs faith has carried him through the deaths of his first wife &amp; two of his children. God must be pissed
trump said Biden is against god. That sounds like something an ayatollah might say in some middle eastern backwater. What have we become?
Polling data trumps personal anecdotes. And the data show that young voters have a clear preference for VP.
We need a  assessment on whether Biden will in fact ‚Äúhurt God.‚Äù Was Trump stretching the truth on that one? Maybe a yellow light on the truth-o-meter?
They were hoping to steal votes from biden. Because there are so many black people that are longing to be republicans and need Kanye to take them to the promised land
I'm excited to vote Trump's punk ass out of office. Just like I was excited to vote for Biden in my state primary to end the Bernie cult. One cult down, one to go.
Me, hearing Biden‚Äôs gonna take away the guns AND the police:
#FoxNews and #Breitbart must see their time in the sun getting ready to set. These bogus Biden stories today are straight non-sense.
BIDEN BEEN MAKING THESE TYPES OF STATEMENTS FOR YEARS.  It's not been but a couple of months since you said Black people who won't vote for you are not really Black.
If he bans TikTok I imagine Biden saying "I will unban TikTok" will bring out some voters? I hope?
Too bad that's NOT what Biden actually said into the camera. This tweet is just a campaign fixer trying to make Joe not look like the racist he is. #JoeBidenIsARacist
I‚Äôm voting for Biden regardless of his VP pick, seriously he could pick a spoiled tuna fish sandwich and I would vote for him. This election I believe, is the most important election this country has held. If 45 is re-elected our country will never recover.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
If only biden had actually said this shit lol
Knowing that Joe Biden is struggling so much cognitively...if you cast an early vote for him BEFORE he debates (without handlers and prompters), you don‚Äôt care about this country AND you are grossly irresponsible. Period.
Bannon,and Ingrahm are false. These accusations are deplorable because Biden has always said his religion is what helped him after losing his first wife, daughter, and son. The Republican party should be ashamed. I would love to see DT recite the Our Father during the debates.
"Biden wants no guns and no religion. He wants to hurt the Bible. He is against God, against guns, and against energy." As a Jesuit Catholic, in the true faith of following in God's footsteps, this is a hateful statement. The hard core faction of conservative Catholics, like Barr
Is he a patsy? Fall guy to validate an appointment? If they make Biden look like the big ask, maybe they could shift perceptions to be more accepting of a shoe-horned in candidate at the last second... make Biden REAL unpalatable in the 3rd quarter to make a Kamalah look better?
did you report on Biden‚Äôs plantation slave owner racism today?
Biden has a plantation owner mentality.

I say Have Biden and Trump race down a ramp, winner take all.
Well Biden has been increasingly saying yes to Warren‚Äôs platform, starting with adopting her bankruptcy policy and moving toward her stance on student loan debt cancellation and other things. Clearly Biden himself values her platform.
If Biden made the same gaff, the GOP would hound him mercilessly for weeks. Trump says it and they are like, ‚Äúmeh! Just a Thursday‚Äù

Biden for president is like settling for a loveless and dull marriage because your last partner was abusive.
Trump says about Biden, ‚ÄúHe's against God, he's against guns."  I feel like God,too, is against guns... turn swords into ploughshares or something like that?
Biden should just make a Tik Tok post saying "Person, woman, man, camera, tv" and drop the mic.
Imagine being so ignorant of who God is that you believe a person could hurt him.
I think Trump said Biden piked God for VP or something I was high and not listening..
The truth is, I do not like  for President, he's too old, trapped in an age of lost and irrelevant values, and is Technologically Illiterate. I want someone under 65 as #46.   That said,   I WILL VOTE FOR BIDEN ON NOV 3, 2020.

This is a candid picture that someone took outside of a DC theater of Biden talking with a homeless man. When the man asked for money, Biden gave it to him, then went back inside to get a piece of paper to write down the number of a personal connection who could help the man.

I actually prefer Elizabeth Warren but neither are running anymore. The democrat candidate is Biden.
A lot of reasons, but what they all boil down to is Biden better appealed to voters generally. To understand why, first, drop the notion that Biden has dementia, he actually speaks eloquently for stretches at a time, and examine how Biden speaks to voters versus how others spoke.

Why does one side say "Under Obama/Biden" but the other side just says "Under Trump"? Why not under Trump/Pence? Because you guys keep trying to tie Biden to Obama. Biden is NOT Obama.
If only I could believe him. Biden lies WAY too much for me.
I mean, this is the reason his other presidential campaigns ended. The man is a gaffe machine. Biden 2020 "He Doesn't Say Nearly As Many Crazy Things And His Policies Are Less Harmful. Yay."
OMfreakingidiot.  Biden will hurt God?  That's the campaigns new messaging?  This just keeps getting more and more wacko.
Well, Biden also didn‚Äôt say what this is accusing him of saying. Why should anyone have to address an outright lie?
Biden can hurt God? So,Trump is saying God is weak, God is vulnerable, God can be defeated by a mere mortal man? Sounds like Trump doesn't understand God. Sounds like Trump is an atheist. #AtheistTrump
Yeah...and I‚Äôve been reading. Biden‚Äôs been given grief for supporting abortion rights and other liberal ideas. My uncle thinks liberalism is a disease. And like other right-wingers, is not open to hearing anything but his own propaganda.  I‚Äôll just continue to be silent.
Show Biden praying in church and Trump gassing protestors to hold up a bible. Quite the contrast.
Everything You've Ever Seen About Cuba Is A Lie  via    IS THIS DEMOCRATS FUTURE FOR YOU IN BIDEN'S AMERICAN??
Biden did not gas peaceful protesters for a photo op to hold a bible up in front of a church.
I heard Biden wanted to arrest Santa for B&amp;E too! Trump will force Peta to do something about the way he treats those raindeer! Bust him for trafficking elves!
Trump says Biden will hurt God. Trump seems to think God is weak, God is vulnerable, God can be defeated by a mere mortal man. Sounds like Trump knows NOTHING of God. Trump is an atheist. YOUR PRESIDENT IN A NON-BELEIVER. Do you stand with him?
I really don't think the NRA is that popular with the voting public. Those for whom it is popular weren't voting for Biden anyway.
#TrumpOnGod Biden can "hurt" God? So, you're saying God is vulnerable? You're saying God is weak? You're saying God can be defeated by a mere mortal man? It sounds like you do not understand God. You sound like an aetheist.
Biden and his family buy all their merchandise they sell in the oval office from China too?? #TrumpCrimeSyndicate  You guys sucks at this mob family thing.

Is Biden gonna form another branch of the military to fight God?? Lmao Trump is too funny. "Biden hates oxygen too, he will take that away!"
People are yelling at Shields for this, but I legitimately don't know what Biden is talking about.  A lot of comments suggest these people are reckless assholes when they drive, and they're very proud of how well they pull it off. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What a deranged maniac. Attacking Joe Biden‚Äôs character will be the nail in Trump‚Äôs political coffin.
Joe Biden, new leader of Weather Underground y'all
I don‚Äôt think that comparing Trump to Biden is a fair comparison, any more than it is appropriate to compare Hitler to Margaret Thatcher. One is clearly a demigogue who has‚ÄîLITERALLY‚Äî pried children from their mothers and locked them up in prison camps. And that‚Äôs just 1 example.
out of context my ass. He's been trying to gut those programs his entire career and no matter how you try and spin it, the facts prove you wrong. What is the draw for Biden other than he's not Trump?
Anyone else receiving an unsolicited email from Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign today? I‚Äôve never enrolled to his mailing list before.
Rick, do you think that more requests for debates is just donnie thinking that he will be able to real a surprise against Biden on National TV to the American people? He certainly has enough Trump roaches searching for one. Must satisfy grandiose savior self view.
Reporters asked the presumptive Democrat presidential candidate to clarify his comments.  Vice President Biden then said "Shoe!" followed by a comment about women's underwear, and concluded by saying "my mind is as tight as a frog's ass stretched over a rain barrel!"
I expect Biden would score about 10 on a standard dementia test.
Secede?? Lol my whole family lives in California and they sure aren't voting for Biden, I will see them finally move after all their lives living in the Bay Area if that ever happened...
Biden as √úbermensch: ‚ÄúGod is hurt, and Biden has hurt him. How shall Biden comfort himself? Who will wipe this blood off Biden? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for Biden? Must Biden not himself become a god simply to appear worthy of it?‚Äù
He's lost his shit "Joe Biden hates babies and puppies! Joe Biden will do away with oxygen! He will stop the world from spinning and start a war with the Martians!"
I promise you Biden has gone to church and prayed for others more than the Orange Tyrant.
I‚Äôm not religious but I promise you Biden goes and has gone to church more than the Orange tyrant.
I know that no candidate is going to be perfect. But at the end of the day, Biden provides the more palatable option for me as a Black, queer woman.
Yeah I read that. Of course you know there will be another GOP Benghazi brawl if he picks Rice. I really like her as a pick. I just don't see how Cupp can say in one hand she despises the status quo yet will accept it if Biden chooses Rice. Makes no sense.
That was intentional on my part--I can totally talk positives about Biden and have several. But I cannot talk about the positives without acknowledging the irreparable negative and damage that has been done with Tr*mp. So many folx are still in the dark about that.
But it isn‚Äôt critical for America‚Äôs survival, so it‚Äôs just a dumb thought experiment that can be used for the exact same argument against Biden.
I understand why Biden does not want to debate but you want to be the president and you play games to not even debate.  Makes you look very weak Biden.  A series of debates are even more critical now that we are all prevented from public discord.
Trump just claimed Biden is "against God". Wow.
And you‚Äôre an idiot who who calls Trump a racist every second you can with no evidence to back it up and yet with direct evidence of Joe Biden being a racist you‚Äôre silent and still attack Trump. Delusional and a disgrace
Joe Biden looked disgusting--nipples protruding--in his blue shirt before Congress. Very very disrespectful.
I know this ad isn‚Äôt for me. It‚Äôs for the conservative boomer who feels uneasy voting for Trump. They assume millennial and Z progressives are safe because of their alternative so the Biden campaign is completely ignoring us.
You live in CT.  A write in candidate is a luxury for you as CT will overwhelmingly go Biden's way.  The only choice this year is 4 more years of Trump (yes/no)
Wishing for it an seeking it are two very different things. And respecting the sanctity of human life doesn't go very far with war criminals who seek to kill millions AGAIN. Syria, Venezuela,Ukraine, it's all going down with a Biden Admin.I wish him ill every moment of every day.
Nope that‚Äôs Joe Biden and his stupid remarks
You use your platform to represent conservatives and focus on politics. You don't have the luxury of acting coy about who you're voting for. You pushed hard for Democrats to pick Biden, your dear family friend, but you won't commit to voting for him yourself?
My neighborhood is covered in yard signs for local candidates...I‚Äôve seen one Biden sign
At this point, the delay is hurting Biden no matter who he chooses.  Missed opportunity.
Another J Biden's blow to Black people!
tbh the biggest reason ya'll hate Joshua isn't because of his campaign finance - that's an excuse. ya'll hate that he doesn't stan Biden. That was the nail in the coffin for dems and local dems. So there's no point replying to my tweets because news flash: I hate Biden too.
GO JOE BIDEN....INSERT YOUR FOOT DOWN DEEPER!
Possibly . I want elected and appointed representatives who will follow state and federal law . Following our bill of rights and the four corners of state and federal constitutional laws. Biden is not the man . He's corrupt . West would lead by emotion.

Joe Biden is a horrible candidate can you imagine if President Trump said that the liberals would have a cow. Trump 2020 its the most important election year ever !!!!!!
Biden Will Never Steal Presidency Already Established By Republican President Mark Patrick Seymour Mitt Romney
Biden Wants To Steal Republican President Mark Patrick Seymour's Presidency Like Trump Attempted To Do Its Not Gonna Happen This Time
Lots to think about. Biden did paint himself into a corner.
Oh good. Now no one should feel worried about voting for  Lol
The guy survived 2 brain aneurysms which affect his speech a little, I think, but Trump is a morally defunct gargoyle, so Biden is OK by me.
Biden wants to bankrupt people like that so that his rich donors get even richer. He is a traitor.
I‚Äôd let Biden live with me way before Trump!
The fact that Kanye is a threat to biden should say something
Biden is the biggest racest &amp; bigot ever. The democrats feel they still own blacks bc they tell them they have to vote democrat. If they don‚Äôt blacks R called names, trader, uncle toms &amp; other things. This is a way to control black ppl. Dems don‚Äôt want them to think for themselve
Biden should call Trump and tell him if he drops out of the race, he might consider a pardon! Then when it hits the fan, Biden tells Trump "April Fool's!" Or "Fake News!" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
i wonder how many people will realize, if biden gets in office, how much our country is going to suffer and fail
If he does no one will vote for him. President Trump was voted in bc everyone was sick of the Obama/Biden recking ball on the country. Putting him in their would B putting that same scenario back in. Obama/Biden politics. It would B a big mistake. Country would go to hell
Nope not one, 8.
^see even other Democrats are catching the Biden bug.
This is so obvious, it's laughable.        Joe Rogan says he thinks Joe Biden is mentally compromised and trying to win the election by hiding:
If (read: when) Biden wins I'll bet all my money that headlines around the country will just be "You're Fired"
Biden should tell him as soon as he releases his taxes, which Biden‚Äôs already done, THEN he will debate him. It‚Äôs not like EVERY presidential candidate hasn‚Äôt released thier taxes. In the last 40+ years.
Biden Is No Nominee Republican President Mark Patrick Seymour Is Already True Commander In Chief And November With Mitt Romney Will Go On As Forty Sixth
If Inslee wins and Biden wins... what happens if Inslee leaves for a cabinet post before being sworn in for 3rd term? Maybe he just purposefully waits until after so the LtGov takes over?
If you really wanted to win the presidency, shouldn't your goal be to beat Biden AND trump?  Do you believe trump is helping you run so you can be president, or are you allowing yourself to be used and made a fool of, so trump can try to win another term? You look bad either way.
Crazy hiden Biden
Joe Biden must debate before the election. Before the ppl vote. Y R democrats hiding Biden from the Debates befor ppl get to vote. It makes no sense. All debates were done before voting before. Y not now. R the democrats afraid of Biden debating. Y R democrats hiding him
And Biden is?   Stupid liberal.
The Presidental debates must B moved up, Y R the debate after ppl vote. WTH!  Y R the democrats avoiding &amp; hiding Biden from debates befor ppl vote. I want the debate before voting so I can make up my own mind. Democrats must not think Biden is any good if they won‚Äôt let him

You forgot Biden, he should be on that list as well seeing he has a fondness of fondling little girls.
"A vote for Biden is a vote for harm reduction. At least he's not Trump" yeah fuck Trump and his low police budgets!!!
Please tell the radical left that Joe Biden is in their pocket... if you can get them to stop groaning about his nomination to get a word in.

Voting for ever lyining, senile old Biden,&amp;  the founderler of young girls, is no different than voting for Trump. Erg, I'll #VoteForBernieSandersForPresident &amp; hope Bernie picks #NinaTurnerForVP !
Or that criticisms towards potential VPs can pull some of the criticism off of Biden. Lets face it a good chunk of us are looking at the VP because Biden is as inspiring as burnt toast and we want someone who we can actually be exited about on the docket.
Finally had to block the insurance company shill who loves Biden.
Can you be Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate????  Please we are begging!!!  Lol
Give me a reason to vote for Biden that does not contain the name Trump. I'll wait.
I don't care who Biden picks, better than getting our heads slammed in the car door every day.
You really should research before speaking.
I hope Biden knows that Trump will not be bringing a knife or a gun.  He‚Äôll have a flame thrower.  It‚Äôll be a demented three ring circus.
Got blocked by more Biden bros. Turning into a pretty good day.
A vote for Trump is a vote for change, for making tuff choices even if it‚Äôs difficult. A vote for Biden is a vote for the path of least resistance, for Acquiescing to the will of our enemies. No judgment here they‚Äôre both decisions full of virtue, but it is what it is.
And you must be someone who completely ignores all of Biden's lies (he dropped last time he ran for LYING). Also ignore all his sexual perversions and the 9 women who accuse him of them?
BTW the people DID NOT nominate Biden. The primaries are rigged, just like 2016.
WTF are you people defending Biden for? FFS, he's tried to gut SS and medicare his whole career. He's against M4A. He's against cannabis legalization. WTF is the draw? Other than he's not DT.
Biden's healthcare plan sucks because he keeps the parasitic insurance companies in the loop. Until insurance companies are removed, there will be no real progress. Example. UHC CEO makes $140,000 A DAY! That money needs to go to treatments, not new yachts.
Is Joe Biden‚Äôs basement technically an assisted living facility?

This is the reply BlueMAGA gives when presented with video proof that Biden is in cognitive decline. Oh, the humanity!
Biden isn't going to "accept nomination"... because he won't be getting it!
I just gave you video proof that Biden is in cognitive decline. Go ahead and ignore it. That's what BlueMAGA does.
If Biden wins, he should immediately ask the courts to assign Federal law enforcement to the WH and other Dept HQs to prevent destruction of documents.  The cases should make themselves. There will probably be plenty of DOJ career attorneys left to work them.  #CorruptGOP
The enemy of my enemy is my friend. First, we get the sociopath out of the White House, then we sort it out with what remains of his party, and with Biden.
And BIDEN is a sexual predator, but you ignore ALL the evidence.
It's exactly what you said. You bring up all of the women who accuse DT of sexual misconduct but when 9 women accuse Biden, he's an angel. Nope.
A truly epic gamer moment would be for Biden to just straight up steal his campaign slogan

President Biden, I sincerely appreciate your honesty assessment. Today, Trump said it is under control! NO IT IS NOT!  Sir, I will not risk my children's life in any way. Trump is literally trying to force us to send our kids to school during this pandemic! No!! You for my vote!
I want Biden to have Obama as his VP just to spite everyone that hated him as President.

Biden ought to tell Trump he will debate him only if he releases his tax returns.
Well then... You will be voting for Biden? Cuz Trump has created this entire disaster. All on his watch!! We are bankrupt. We are sick and dying. And we are divided.   Again, all happened on Trump's watch. Don't blame Dems for your idiot President and pathetic administration.

If this is true, the DNC and Biden had better have a fucking solid slate of lawyers ready to take this on.

Honestly!  I just want this over!!!  Elect him!  Elect Biden!  I don't care!!  What about the children being abused in #HOLLYWOOD!  why doesn't the world get hear this!‚ô°   please!!  Acknowledge this!  We need this acknowledged!‚ô°   please!‚ô°
Again...this isnt Joe Biden. We all know he cant string a coherent sentence together anymore.
What makes you think Biden is going to do ANYTHING to help regular Americans? "Nothing will fundamentally change." Joe Biden to Wall Street investors.
Mine is  That being said, this group of women is exemplary and I'd support Biden if he chose Scooby Doo!
‚ÄúOur president is so...‚Äù  ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt Joe Biden is too...‚Äù  ‚ÄúCOVID isn‚Äôt...‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt mask up, you are...‚Äù  ‚ÄúSupport this cause or you‚Äôre...‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe should cancel him for saying...‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe shouldn‚Äôt have to kneel because...‚Äù  Y‚Äôall are giving me a headache.

Biden isn‚Äôt going around telling us to inject disinfectant, or saying this will be over by Easter.
Because Joe Biden talks so well
they wanna hide biden metal state
Did you forget that Biden voted FOR Scalia and attacked Anita Hill in defence of Clarence Thomas? What makes you think he's going to save the court?
This article does NOT show she's a liar. You are a woman. You should know that victims of sexual assault can get some minor details wrong. What about the other women who accuse him? They all liars?
Correction, Donnie dotard was ASKED 17 questions. He didn‚Äôt answer any of them. Biden‚Äôs just letting him self destruct and kicking his ass.
Got proof of Tara's suppode lies? I haven't seen them. Please link them here. BTW, speaking of liars...
Yet if anything about Joe Biden comes out in the next few weeks like he once passed out with his dick out at a frat party, and it‚Äôs 4 more years of Spray Tan Jesus.
So you are OK with voting for a sexual predator?
You sure about that?
"The pink represents my adoring fans lining the Texas highways to honor me. The brown graph is the Florida fans lining the streets. The orange and the blue are Biden's. Nope. Excuse me, they're all mine too. I have move fawning fans than anybody."
Biden is for big increases......... LIKE WHAT? ...you always talk but never say anything.....
She is definitely a worthy contender and she does not deserve to be taken apart. It will only be worse once Biden selects his female (hopefully black) running mate.Then the gloves will really come off.They always do.Strong women in power intimidate. #FACT
Idk, but if Biden's smart, he'll try to get a Black Woman, but since most black women are too smart to get in the same room with Biden, much less become his running mate, he'll be lucky if he can find a black guy dumb enough to be his VP.
I'm not conservative or liberal, but something in between, not a democrat or republican but an American who believes in the constitution and democracy, have voted across the aisle many times. supported every elected President until now.  I will vote for Biden this time.
There aren't any hardcore enthusiastic Biden supporters.
Only 50? That‚Äôs a lightweight in trumps orbit. Lol weird how the #GOPComplicitTraitors are just fine with this. Pretty sure they wouldn‚Äôt be when Biden‚Äôs President.
No, he‚Äôs not getting my vote no matter who he chooses, or if he comes out suddenly supporting Medicare For All. He‚Äôs a plagiarizer, a liar. His actions  and past racist remarks hold more weight with me than anything he says. That‚Äôs the real Biden, not the one throwing platitudes.
Retta!! This is why I am voting for Biden!!! If I have to stand in line for 2 weeks hooked up to a ventilator to vote!! We must end this insanity ASAP! The solution to this problem is so simple too!! Uhhhhhhh!!!
I could pull up all of Biden‚Äôs gaffs, and it wouldn‚Äôt fill one of trumps pressers
Yea Biden would be horrible and wouldn‚Äôt last a sentence in first 100 days.Intel shows Russia trying to "denigrate" Biden, and China prefers Trump lose
is it true that if there is no clear voted Pres. that Pelosi will be the interim president until it‚Äôs sorted out?  Makes sense that she would have Biden (a puppet) there to cause chaos between him and Trump, putting her in the house until it‚Äôs decided. Scarrrry!
"Joe Biden is unfit to be president and Joe Biden is a racist. Joe Biden has the mind-set of a plantation owner." -Leo Terrell
Like you, I‚Äôm not a fan of the current administration, but you‚Äôve been endorsing Biden for months. Just admit you‚Äôre voting for him because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen. His VP pick will be irrelevant to you...
God, as he watches Biden become too powerful to stop
They both can‚Äôt talk right. Trump had a video of Biden having trouble thru speeches now Biden has one of Trump. They‚Äôre both old!
Plus it doesn't matter who I vote for, Seattle picks whoever the Democratic party tells them to, and so Washington state is already Biden's
American abuse from the Biden's Funded by China. Thanks for your service Sir
it true that if there is so much chaos &amp; discrepancies in the counting of the votes, that the C*NT Pelosi will be the interim president until it‚Äôs all figured out, which would explain why they want that fool Biden to run to cause all the chaos to put her in charge?
Easy Biden's are funded by China China wants the tariffs all stopped They will kill as many Good Americans as it takes China don't care about their own people. And they care less about us Good Americans Thanks for your service Sir.
Biden and his crew are funded by China who got mad because you put tariffs on their products this is the reason China is funding Dirty Democrats and are funding Dirty Rioters. All democrat states are getting money from China. You just have to look at the big picture Sir Thanks U
If I could change two things about Biden it would be, lose the aviator glasses and quit calling people Jack when you‚Äôre upset with them. Other than that, please proceed Mr. Vice President.
Just how crazy is Joe Biden??
a few weeks ago, Joe Biden said he was constantly being cognitively tested. Now today he says he has NOT been cognatively tested recently.  which is true?  And just how crazy is Joe, anyway??  can't believe he is a presidential candidate!  such nonsense
Joe #Biden will no longer travel to #Milwaukee to accept #Democratic #nomination. #election #leadership
Trump campaign calls for early September debate ahead of early voting  thug trump are you personally gonna debate PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN OR HAVE PIGGY BARR DO YOUR DEBATE OR JAVE ADOLPH PUTIN DEBATE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN INQUIRING MINDS WANNA KNOW

Booing Hillary and not endorsing Biden is called having principles not being childish.
Fuck this tired argument. It‚Äôs a lazy broken record one too. It‚Äôs up to Joe Biden to earn our votes. He is applying for the most powerful position in the world and you just want to hand it to him demanding nothing? That‚Äôs how we got trump!
If Biden debates you Sir He would probably die of a heart attack too much stress. His body is not right at all. Thanks for your service Sir.
Biden is another brainer Sir Thanks for your service Sir.
If Biden can't be trusted Then why should we trust him with this. Thanks for your service Sir.
Biden funded by China Makes this the Biden virus This is easy to see Sir. Thanks for your service Sir.
Biden family gets there money from the bad people in the world Biden's funded by China Hunter is in China with hands held wide open. More money to hurt Good Americans with Thanks for your service Sir.
Biden is medically incapable of holding office.
Your not a republican. Your a moron. Sleepy Joe can't even tell you what day it is unless he has someone talking in his ear. Even then he can't follow what they're saying to him. My dad had alzheimers and believe me, Joe Biden is past the early stages of it.
How Donald #Trump can raise his #political game against Joe #Biden. #leadership #election
If mentally dismissed Joe Biden gets away with hiding in basement and NOT debating Trump, then the American public is dumber than I thought, and deserve the government they get.
Postpone the #Election? That Could Mean #President #Biden #leadership #ethics #recovery
Kind of sick of being told what we HAVE to do. I‚Äôm voting for Joe because trump is a monster, but Joe Biden SUCKS!!!!
Biden and Trump fight for Arizona's Hispanic vote  if the Hispanic vote goes for trump forget about me supporting the Hispanic community and The attacks on immigration coming from trump I will support trump enforcing immigration and building the wall......
You know the story...even if Joe Biden wins in November, very little can change if the Republicans still control¬†the US Senate.   There are two key toss-up Senate races out West: Montana and Colorado. If you have the means, please consider adopting these races as your own. 1/3
You hit the nail on the head Biden talks a lot but he says a lot nothing  If Biden becomes President he'll say a lot but do nothing. The do nothing President Thanks for your service Sir.

First of all: you don‚Äôt know who I‚Äôm voting for. And it definitely is not a fascist like Trump. Second: Biden, whether I vote for him or not, is not just an awkward gaffe. If you think that‚Äôs all he‚Äôs done, you need to learn some history.
So Russia wants Trump to win, China wants Biden to win, Americans want neither to win and yet they‚Äôll probably split around 100 million
Vote for Joe Biden.  Be kind to everyone.   Don't stare into sun.
I suggest reading more in Biden rather that watching Trump's twitter posts. Dude doesn't know what he's talking about.
"I won't vote for Biden unless he picks a moderate" is like saying "I won't save you from a burning building unless you agree to vote for "Republican-lite candidates."   Saying such a thing demonstrates such a degree of self-delusion and self-interest that I just can't.#Biden2020
Articulate? Really? I don't think we've been watching the same Joe Biden
Biden fires back at ‚Äòinsecure bully‚Äô Trump after president says he ‚Äòhurt God‚Äô -
The #covid19 second wave in USA will be way more devastating in fall 2020 with the idiot in the WH who thank goodness will be defeated by Biden in Nov.
I love everything you said. What do you think will come of the GOP putting Kayne up to steal black votes from Biden??
Shocking !!! All you given us lately is more Blood on the Leaves . Stay in Wyoming , a perfect match ‚úåÔ∏èüêùüê∞
Thoughtful: ‚ÄúBiden will be more electable, draw stronger contrasts with Trump, and encourage more voter participation if he moves left. And until he does, I withhold my vote. If he loses, it will be because of his choice to put donors over voters. He alone will be responsible.‚Äú
My boss is 83 and is so much more coherent than Biden.
Oh the die is cast.  Voters can see your mercurial, out-of-control antics and what they have led us to ‚Äî 160,000 deaths with no plan to control it, an economy in free fall and Russia calling the shots. Or Steady Joe Biden. No debates even needed.
When, exactly, has Biden PROMOTED abortion? Believing that a MEDICAL decision is between one person and their doctor (and their God, if they are a believer in one) is NOT "promoting" ANYTHING!
This election is a midnight matinee magic show. The magician's asst. (GOP) is doing their best distraction work, but clearly drunk, &amp; the magician (Dems) keeps flubbing the slight-of-hand while the cockatoos (Biden) keeps screaming racial slurs from inside the hidden compartment.
I could do without some of the crap Trump says, too. I just keep seeing clips of Biden seeming to lose track of what he saying, or saying things that make no sense.
I can agree with this, and still acknowledge that job one in this election is defeating the Traitor45 and that the best path for that, in this time and place, is voting for Biden.  Our ship is sinking, plug the holes, then fix the motor.
Poor Biden, he is barely keeping his head above water.
If you're worried that Kanye will split the black vote and cost Biden the election then you're more than a little bit dumb and racist
When did people think Biden was old, and had dementia?  Holy shit ... Trump is such a mess ... (and he's our President)
Trump is a monster, but you really think I'm gonna put my ass on the line to make sure Joe Biden is president?
Biden vows to 'not interfere' with a possible Trump prosecution  via
"Wait, Joe Biden's a racist?"  "Always has been."
... uh, I think Biden will be ok.
Bernie showing me: How much corporate $$ is poured into elections. How other countries view health care That you can run on best serving voters and not donors. Then seeing his treatment by Media/DNC  By hey, Hillary, Trump, Biden ain't so bad.... SMFH
"Biden is the electable one" "wehhh stop criticizing Biden and holding him to standards or else he's gonna lose waaaaahhh"
Read the article before you spout shit it all happened under Obama/Biden
Biden 2020!  I can't stand to hear you talk!
You're not all there!  Biden 2020!
Will do! Biden 2020!
I love it when people say Trump is working for them.  He doesn't give a damn about you.  He's all about himself.  And Biden?  Just stay quiet.  Trump is defeating himself just fine by himself. Trump is Bidens best campaign commercial.  But you do you :)
It's depressing thinking Joe Biden authored the 1994 crime bill, that helped incarcerate blacks in record numbers!
Perfect. Then an actual competent Biden admin will be in charge of helping Americans get vaccinated during the next few months. It‚Äôs a win-win
These Biden Bros are out of control
I feel like there‚Äôs going to be an ‚ÄúOctober surprise‚Äù against Biden and we‚Äôre going to be stuck with another 4 years of this asshole. Biden is such a train wreck of a candidate i feel like its Hillary 2.0
To whom is this raving, drooling loon talking? Joe Biden is a stone Catholic.
Is there a VP pick that would make you vote Biden?
followed all that are new to me  *‚ïî‚ïê‚ùñ‚Ä¢‡≥ã¬∞ üê± ¬∞‡≥ã‚Ä¢‚ùñ‚ïê‚ïó*
To be clear, voting for Biden first, knowing that what progressives are proposing are not radical, they are barely left, they do represent the best of what made us great, what made us the envy of the world, I would like to be #1 in the world for all the right reasons again.
Anyway, I appreciate the fact that there is some decency in some remnants of the relublican party, but you have been lulled so far right, that Biden Democrats are Relublicans and the Corlorate enemies to me. Please understand this. Corporate $s must be removed.
Is Joe Biden cancelled today or do I have to wait another day before he says some other stupid shit.
I‚Äôm in Washington. Haven‚Äôt seen any Biden signs. I‚Äôve seen one sticker. My gut says this is the last election all over: Trump losing the polls but wins the election.
Biden should only debate if Trump releases his taxes.
As old as Biden is... we may be announcing 47.
Regardless of whom he picks, it should be clear that his running mate (given Biden's mental health) will be the true Dem presidential nominee. So, I hope he picks a competent one. But I have my doubts that he will.
I shit on biden pretty regularly.. but at the end of the day I‚Äôm going to vote for him. I‚Äôve been told im ‚Äúselfish‚Äù but I don‚Äôt want to see what Trump does with 4 more years in terms of taking away trans rights.
It‚Äôs doubtful that anything will be epic under Biden. #leftisbest  #NoComradesUnder1k
Biden just won
Everyone is assuming the ‚Äúmajor national announcement‚Äù from Letitia James  tomorrow is about trump, but how do we know this isn‚Äôt about Biden?
And the DNC, knowing this, rigged the primary against Sanders for Biden anyway. We really must stop and consider what in the hell is going on.
Biden pulled Reagan to the right on some issues
When Joe Biden tells me and the homies, we ain't black....I beg to differ, cracka ass cracker!
Imagine putting "BLM" on your twitter page, just to vote for Biden, the guy who helped write the 1994 crime bill, that incarcerated blacks at a massive level...Maybe learn history? That's your savior? Jesus fuck me christ!
What say you, about Joe Biden authoring the 1994 crime bill, that incarcerated a record number of blacks? Why is that a good alternative to Trump?
You're assuming I'm a big fan of Biden only because I dislike trump. At this point it just feels like picking the best of two turds. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Tucker Carlson says it's 'probably illegal' for Joe Biden to pick a Black woman as vice president

Anyways, I was reminded occasionally by boomer libs on Facebook that Bernie could never survive a red baiting campaign from the right during an election. Well, it seems no matter who runs (even Biden) or who‚Äôs considered, the red baiting was going to happen anyways.
Joe Biden should make all debates conditional, No Debates until Tax Returns are Released!
Plenty of examples of rigged primary. Not all of US want to vote for a war monger &amp; corrupt caplitist!  Cool Biden won. I will not be voting  for Biden.  It was Bernie or Tulsi &amp; no one else
If Trump gives his Nomination Acceptance Speech from the White House, shouldn‚Äôt Joe Biden be given the same opportunity?
Obama and Biden did fix America, now Biden will have to fix it again after Trump fucked it up
It's too bad that Bernie gave up &amp; gave in. It's also to bad that Bernie voted for the biggest transfer of wealth in US history-Cares Act.  Oh yea, it's too bad that Bernie is straight up lying to everyone telling US that Biden could be the most progressive President since FDR.
I‚Äôm under 1k.. fair warning I plan on voting for biden. But I acknowledge that he‚Äôs fucking terrible.

How long until trump tweets that Beirut explosion and says that it‚Äôs an orphanage in a white suburb that was attacked by antifa at the order of Joe Biden
Why Trump doesn't deserve a Biden debate  by
A day after the presidential election  will re-evaluate his covid phase? That figures.  If Biden wins these restrictions will magically vanish.  These politicians are very shallow.
You're an irrelevant headline reader.. You have no argument. If you prove you're a "millionaire" I'll guarantee a vote for Biden. You're another ridiculous failure who blames others for his struggles in life. Get a job bro. Once you start paying taxes get at me.

The police issue is most local, so work on that there.  Biden is what we need right now.  We have to clean this mess up and then as we out it back together, we have build a better more equitable society.
A debate question for Joe Biden: ‚Äú how often do you use DuckDuckGo?‚Äù üòá
Umm, Biden's son served. He cares!
A few years ago at the passing of   McCain and Bush we honored them with great Americans both opposed  Black issues. I threw up in my mouth then as I do now with thinking Joe Biden  "You ain't black" is an acting White Supremacist. Can't write/articulate racism and not be one!
Joe Biden is a White Domestic Terrorist  well. Voting against all Racism sounds brilliant. No more justifying it was 94 just repeal the racism. Blacks shouldn't serve more time on any level.
Cher for VP #BIDEN
i‚Äôd rather suffocate on my own vomit than see Biden in office
Here is a Former Presidential candidate and front runner for the Biden cabinet on guns.     And here is the M4A plan that eliminates private health insurance. Aka private healthcare.    Two examples of you being debunked. As requested
Glad that Ben Jacobs is following up on these dirty tricks. It is so clearly a Republican ploy to pull votes from Biden.
I believe the DNC has already picked out his running mate. Don't be too surprised when they announce Hillary as Biden's running mate.
I bet you Biden totally understood her. His answer? Because the Squirrel has a grapefruit to drive.üòúüòú
3rd mass text message I got today asking if I‚Äôm voting for Biden.
Are you seriously suggesting that Biden struggles more than the President, who rarely strings anything together resembling a sentence and for whom two-syllable words are large?
we are protesting a racist establishment and they want us to vote for joe biden make it make sense
Bernie was running on UBI before he dropped out and Biden was running against it, and Yang still endorsed Biden. Grifters gonna grift.
It would make it clear whether or not Biden is suffering from dementia, though, wouldn't it? Is that why the Dems want to avoid a debate? Because they know Biden can't frame a coherent thought under pressure? Hope not.
Literally all 10 of these also apply to Joe Biden. They're also both rapists. Y'all let's turn out for sure: for the Green Party!! Then we get to work building an anti-Capitalist Left Coalition Party going forward. #GreenParty2020 #NotMeUs
Big CPC is a huge "RED FLAG"   They all voted for cares act. (They say no due to it was a voice vote) they all voted for the biggest transfer of wealth in USA history.  They had leverage back in early March &amp; choose to throw it all away due to Trump.   Biden is who's fucking hero
This is me speaking. This is the polling coming out during the democratic primary.  Your quote is total BS.   Have fun voting for Biden.
After the election and Joe Biden becomes POTUS, my answer to every question by Republicans about anything that Joe Biden does will be #BecauseFuckenTrump
Older black voters are more comfortable with Biden.  40 &amp; younger are way more comfortable with Bernie.  Older black voters simply came out more (2:1 ratio) and voted Biden.   If &amp; when. Iden becomes president watch Biden turn around &amp; stab all of his voters in the back.
Job one tiday is to get rid of The Traitor45, nothing else happens without that.  I am voting for Biden.  I encourage everyone to do the same.  The system is rigged to the two parties, agreed. We need to fix that, agreed. But first we save the country, then we reform.
Pretty sure Biden will have an excellent Secretary of State to handle that.
Obama was already the president. For two terms. Unlike you. And Biden is ahead of you by double digits.

The Biden administration is not under any circumstances going after the former Trump administration for any crimes lol.
So, your paywall is shitty, plus, you're a never-biden, meaning you're a "Never read"
I think a lot of them have, but accept and support him because ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the *other* ‚Äòchoice‚Äô‚Äù. Much like how we‚Äôre trapped with a Biden/Trump election. Neither the  nor  *really* want change for the betterment of the average citizen, more than keeping their own in power.
At this late date it would do no good and make Trump look even more like he is chasing Biden rather than leading.
The republicans are honestly the best sellers for the Dem campaign.   If only we could believe that Biden was that radical leftist or would actually throw him in prison
Yes, vote Blue, vote Biden not hate.
What if Biden asked you???
I think she's saying she can't due to her own status with voting, she wants to vote biden but is an immigrant or something.
I can understand your point and I‚Äôm not trying to troll you but not every American loves this country and it makes me sad I wish America could heal and mend our problems together as a team ! I get that you don‚Äôt like trump but I don‚Äôt like Biden or Clinton‚Äôs or any of the others
What a Joke, Coming from the man that put 50,000,000 people out of work, Largest GNP Drop in the history of the Country. Trump is Desperate, Lies is all he has. Bye #NobodyLikesTrump   Trump Warns That 'Jobs Will Disappear' If Biden Is Elected. Jaws Drop.
Ok that‚Äôs fair one article? Maybe two you can throw at me so your a joe Biden fan how do you feel about his sniffing and touching children... do you have kids would you let your kid or daughter be around joe Biden ?
If you could get Biden on board with only ONE of the big ticket bernie-esque policies, Ryan, which would it be? I'd choose Universal Health Care.
Or Biden could use the word Grand instead - it fits with 'malarkey' and the rest of Joe-lingo.
Make America Great Again?  Vote for Joe Biden.  #MATFA
I've been in mourning since 2016. I'm hoping for a landslide victory for Joe Biden in 2020, and sanity in the White house again.

I don‚Äôt see indecisiveness. There really is no rush. Let Trump and his minions fret a little longer about whether they will need to replace Pence to try to counter Biden‚Äôs choice. It really is quite masterful.
We will!  BIDEN 2020!!

No one knows who it is.  Speculators, insiders, trump campaign, Biden campaign, Biden.
Repeat after me Biden is a dirty old man Biden can‚Äôt run this country  because he has oatmeal for brains and last repeat after me I Alyssa will stop biting the hand that feeds me so help me Hanna.
Biden will need to raise taxes to clean up your mess.  Highest debt in history, highest deficit in history. Highest trade deficit in history. Highest unemployment since the Great Depression, and worst GDP since the Great Depression.  Revenues aren't even paying the debt interest

Conservative columnist George Will says he‚Äôs voting for Joe Biden in November: "The most important thing is to clear the ground so we can start over with American-normal politics."
WHY WOULD BIDEN DEBATE TRUMP???  Trump is incapable of : 1) interacting civilly 2) putting two thoughts  together coherently 3)shutting up when his time is up 4)resorts to personal attacks always!

To be fair, Biden is periodically stuck in the past 40% of the time as it is.
If Biden does not do what must be done to fix what the republicans have done during Bush43. And fix all the damage that trump has done. Pulling right Rs to fascism and the left Ds to be moderate republicans = Bush43. Then Tom Cotton will be the first Fascist Dictator of the USA.
Yep. And Biden is just the prez to do that. As for you, get to work on a pandemic plan. Death toll nears 160,000.

Trump does know how to distract and make the media chase a random shiny object. All of America knows better now. Vote for Biden
You realize this person isn't a Democrat right? They are in the Green Party. They've got no obligation to vote for the DNC nominee, not even someone as unelectable as Biden.   Perhaps you should campaign to get a real candidate to run against Trump, instead of being a bully.
Point with trump it will be him just hurling insults at Biden. With no real debate and i can see Biden staring down trump until he gives up and walks away or one of trumps lackeys gives him his syphalis meds to get him on track.

From here, it's Warren, who happens to be on a call with Biden right now. No one knows policy AND inspires like Elizabeth Warren.
Old white men afraid of an ambitious woman are afraid she's better than they are, and that's not acceptable. She, or any woman, needs to stick to her guns and move forward no matter what. Biden should pick Kamala for that very reason. It'll show he's not afraid of her ambition.

Biden rows back from embarrassing interview where he said Latinos are 'incredibly diverse' unlike African-Americans
It isn't about if the NRA is good or bad (the NRA is several organizations and this wouldn't dissolve the NRA all up) it's about giving ammo to Trump 90 days before an election. Why not wait? Gun control is not politically advantageous. This hurts Biden.
You're absolutely right (as usual) - there are still several factors that can play out to Trump's favor: MI, PA and WI must go for Biden. These are again critical states to win.
Biden tries to clarify remarks suggesting lack of diversity in the Black community
let us say, for the sake of discussion, that both sides are right and Biden and Trump are both showing signs of dementia  of the two, which one is more likely to realize that fact, accept it, and resign voluntarily for the good of the country?

Feel bad when someone tells you an organization you believe in is fraudulent. The NY AG is trying to score political points. There is zero chance this works. The NRA is fine. Republicans and Independents get riled up against attacks like this and it's bad for Biden. Stop.
This is a huge joke. It's a political hitjob and this is coming from someone who supports Joe Biden. The more dipshit Democrats put focus on the NRA and gun lobby, the more likely Trump is to win.  Guns are literally not an issue.

Joe Biden having a super cool corvette is quite literally the only thing I like about Joe Biden. I swear I've seen him get more flack on here for the Vette than all the sexual harassment.
Joe Biden is better in every single measurable way! Your ignorance is humorous though! #BidenIsBetter #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace and a complete failure!
Biden is a simpleton, this old fart should be wearing a crash helmet üòÇ
Biden for president is like settling for a loveless and dull marriage because your last partner was abusive.

I guess that means you were always voting for Trump and have found your justification. Congrats, I guess?... at this point, the only way a VP pick should matter now is if Biden picked Trump or any of his enablers for VP...

What a deranged maniac. Attacking Joe Biden‚Äôs character will be the nail in Trump‚Äôs political coffin.
President Joe Biden.
Trump will "stalk" Biden all around the room as he did with Hillary?
Biden should call Trump and tell him if he drops out of the race, he might consider a pardon! Then when it hits the fan, Biden tells Trump "April Fool's!" Or "Fake News!" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
If you really wanted to win the presidency, shouldn't your goal be to beat Biden AND trump?  Do you believe trump is helping you run so you can be president, or are you allowing yourself to be used and made a fool of, so trump can try to win another term? You look bad either way.
No Aubrey what is the saying? Don't get in the way of a fool making a fool of himself? Something like that? Anyways. Why does Biden need to dp anything other then let Trump bury himself.
They think black people are stupid. Will vote for Kanye because he is black. Therefore, votes taken from Biden. That is why.

If Biden wins, he should immediately ask the courts to assign Federal law enforcement to the WH and other Dept HQs to prevent destruction of documents.  The cases should make themselves. There will probably be plenty of DOJ career attorneys left to work them.  #CorruptGOP
Yes, they tried out a lunatic for 4 years, and it obviously hasn‚Äôt done them any good. Let‚Äôs hope for a return to sanity, with as sweeping a victory for Joe Biden as FDR got in 1936.
Biden needs to debate Trump
The media demanded Information about Pres. Trump mental health after his election, Biden should have no more or less fair treatment.

üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Gonna really enjoy watching you guys lose your minds when Biden is announced the Presidential nominee!   I cannot wait to tell you guys to get over it!!!
Leeze, the fact you are thinking Trump has done a good job is.... Well... Gross.  Trump failed miserably, and continues to fail miserably. We have gone past the point of no return. The death toll will be horrific.   Biden could have handled this much better.
What could Biden have done better you ask? üòÇüòÇüòÇ  For starters, listening to his top disease experts! Following the Pandemic response guide. Leading by example, and not sugar coating what was coming!   Trump failed big time. I can't believe you are asking this!?
Zoc, you are full of it. Biden's mental competence is 100 times better than Trump's. You will see this when Biden gets on stage to debate. You are seriously underestimating Biden. You shall see.
Aaron. I'm voting to save our country, which means I am voting for Biden. I am really curious who Biden will choose as VP. We need someone very sharp in that position.
Biden is just fine! Biden doesn't want to risk anyone's health right now. Trump is doing a fine job of destroying himself. Biden can literally save his energy for the last mile, and beat Trump.
Jordan, welcome! Listen, I was a Republican at one time. It didn't take long after Trump was elected for me to step back and evaluate myself. I am comfortable enough to vote for Biden. I don't think this nation will last another 4 years under Trump. Again, welcome aboard!
President Biden, I sincerely appreciate your honesty assessment. Today, Trump said it is under control! NO IT IS NOT!  Sir, I will not risk my children's life in any way. Trump is literally trying to force us to send our kids to school during this pandemic! No!! You for my vote!
Trump says he saved millions of lives? That's insanity!! Trump has literally killed 160,000 people so far. Is he really proud of that number? Jesus!! Grab the wheel! Vote Biden to save our nation and save our lives!
Well then... You will be voting for Biden? Cuz Trump has created this entire disaster. All on his watch!! We are bankrupt. We are sick and dying. And we are divided.   Again, all happened on Trump's watch. Don't blame Dems for your idiot President and pathetic administration.
Biden will be our next President. We all gotta get on the same page. I still hear people say they will write in their hopeful. I'm out there educating all I can!
Damn this makes me believe! We must all get on the same page in November too! We really need to remove the crime family and his cronies! We cannot repeat 2016! If it's Biden, it's Biden I am voting for. United we stand, divided we fall!
Thus the national lock down till the Nov elections to keep Biden silent.
It schools not be allowed. Dems and CNN are trying to make a case for Trumps intelligence. He is very smart but BIDEN as you know has a low IQ AND HAS DEMENTIA
That would be Biden
So what I want to tell you is you are shameful in every way including Pelosi, Schumer, Nadler Biden. The deaths are not Trumps fault. They are China‚Äôs fault. He didn‚Äôt want this pandemic. But it sounds like Dems do and they should pay for the damage done by ANTIFCA &amp; Dems YDWC
Trump wants praise.... He does NOT deserve any with his horrific response to this pandemic. We gotta get this idiot out of office! Biden will save this nation!
JUST WAIT... JOE'S READY. 2020 THE BIDEN THEME SONG?

Yur joking right,Not only is Biden ahead of Trump,he's way ahead+his lead is growing! Projected EC has Biden winning twice the delegates,U must be following Rasmussen,a GOP supported Poll not taken seriously by any respected independent Poll,all Americans,even Reps know he failed
LMAO. I cannot believe that you give people so little credit.  You act like anyone outside your inner circle is stupid. America has rebounded from fr worse and we will do so again when Biden crushes you.  #RepublicansForBiden
We have our own problems, our grifters won't even agree to be interviewed by any decent journalist, just the sycophantic ones. I have to ask as don't think Biden will beat Trump.  Why haven't the democrats selected a younger candidate, someone like Andrew Yang?
She is definitely a worthy contender and she does not deserve to be taken apart. It will only be worse once Biden selects his female (hopefully black) running mate.Then the gloves will really come off.They always do.Strong women in power intimidate. #FACT
Retta!! This is why I am voting for Biden!!! If I have to stand in line for 2 weeks hooked up to a ventilator to vote!! We must end this insanity ASAP! The solution to this problem is so simple too!! Uhhhhhhh!!!
I thought Trump was going to be the accelerationist president but I shouldn't have been surprised it's actually Biden
I mean. The man has no filter. Biden‚Äôs attack ads are writing themselves.
U have no idea what Biden will do,cut yur whining! Yur scared shitless of Biden! U are,w/o a doubt,the slimiest politician ever!And U have NO HONOR OR MORALS!Yur hatin yur gonna lose,cause U have to face 100s of lawsuits from borrowing Ms$,then filin for bancruptsy,5x,yur a RAT!
Wow. I hope Biden brings some simple graphs and asks basic questions to the debates.
Biden is just fine. He can literally kick back in his recliner! Your boy on the other hand just has to open his mouth to dig himself deeper every minute of the day. When Biden does come out to debate, he is gonna cook your boy. You will see.
That will really be up to President Biden. Your boy Trump can't manage a McDonald's at this point. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I believe Biden's victory in November is already priced into the markets.  I don't believe the Democrats winning the senate has been priced into the market yet so perhaps the markets will climb higher once it's become more evident that will happen.
You're right. There has never been a debate has there?  Tells you all about Biden.

Yes President Biden!!! Thank you! It's pretty scary knowing Trump is trying to hurt our kids now. Even more scary that Trump is now killing his own friends!
Mr. Biden, I am looking forward to putting the racists back in their closets for good. I want every single American to be equal! Under Trump, we are divided beyond words.
Thank you soon to be President Biden! I just look forward to getting a good night's sleep soon! Before I go to bed with Trump as POTUS, I have to worry about getting nuked, the pandemic, and if I have a job tomorrow!
Lol it‚Äôs hilarious these people don‚Äôt want debates... it‚Äôs bc they know Biden stands no chance on a stage with Trump
But Biden is better than Trump
cannot recover from his deficit unless he changes his entire personality.  Highly unlikely!!!  Sad really!  He has destroyed the Republican Party. Hoping Larry Hogan can rebuild it.  Biden will do a good job until then.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Are you kidding me? Biden supporters are smart, and avoiding the pandemic by following the request of professionals. Trump on the other hand is busy killing friends like Herman Cain.  You know what's sad? Trump.

America was great when Obama was President! Then.... This orange idiot got elected and everything went to hell! We are bankrupt, sick, and divided.   So yes!! I am voting for Biden!
You raised the government debt by $6 trillion which is actually a $6 trillion tax increase because the only way you can pay off debt is by raising taxes.  So you cut taxes now and got the accolades and Biden will have to raise taxes to pay off the DEBT YOUR TAX CUTS created.

He can't make any decisions. Common here. Better say "Clintons", "Obama", "Democrats", but not Joe Biden. He is not capable of doing anything right now.

They would be better opponents than Biden!
There are some positive things here!! Trump just pissed away over 30,000,000 18-24 year old voters.... Rest assured, Biden will bring it back!!
Along with Biden, worse VP in history. What a pair. Still can't get Obama to go away. Most past Presidents don't appear in public like he does that I can recall. Just keeps popping up like Hillary. Talk about not accepting vote results, Hillary wins the blue ribbon!
I guess this means that I'm 90, no 100 percent sure that I'm voting for Biden because Trump is a fascist making me antifa!
This will only lead to Biden using Ke$ha's TikTok as a campaign theme song
He's criticizing vote by mail so his voters will vote in person and Biden voters will vote by mail. Then his minion that runs the USPS will shut down mail delivery in swing states, disenfranchising Biden voters and getting himself reelected.
Ummmmmm... You didn't beat Obama. If Obama had run, he would have mopped you on the floor. And let's get real here. If Hillary had won, we wouldn't have 150,000 Americans buried! You will NOT win in November Trump! Biden is gonna mop ya on the floor.

Breaking News Don!! Because of your incompetence, we have over 150,000 dead Americans, and that number is going up. Don't blame Biden fool!! Biden is not the President yet! You are! I guarantee if Biden was POTUS, he would have saved alot of lives.
Biden and Obama... Sigh.. I sure miss going to sleep not worrying about getting nuked, or dying from a pandemic! I miss being able to go to work and enjoy going out on the town on my days off. I miss not having to see friends die from the pandemic. Biden is going to win.
Nope, all your Q shit is debunked. Biden is straight gonna beat your boy hard!! Biden has nothing to worry about legally. Trump on the other hand is gonna get butt hard in prison! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Gross.
Don the Con is so desperate!! He really thinks he has a chance to win in November! It's hilarious!! The desperation and fear of prison is very real for him! I'm voting to save this nation, which means I am voting for Joe Biden!
I think Joe Biden should be able to ask China, Iran, and other countries for help in the election!!! I mean, if Trump can ask for foreign assistance in an election, so should Biden! Truth is, Biden is gonna win fair and square! Even with Trump trying to cheat! Bye Don the Con!
We the people are going to win the election big time, by voting Biden in as our new President! Everyone knows you are desperate to get elected again, because the minute you leave this job, your nightmare of prison is certain. Suck it up orange buttercup! GAME OVER!!
He was a hell of a man that decided not to wear a mask, because his cult leader told he didn't have to. That was a choice he made, and it ultimately cost him his life. I guess it's safe to say most Biden voters will be alive to cast their votes on 11/3!!

This is absolutely horrifying! We have been warned folks! If I have to stand in line for a month hooked up to a portable ventilator to vote, I will!! I refuse to allow this evil man to spend an extra day or year in that job! Vote Biden!!
Really? Biden is the moral bastion you want to hold up as an example?
He sees the internal polling. Repubs, as well as himself are going to get routed. So, he is going to do everything he can to try and contest the election. Do not be surprised if Biden wins be 5-10% and then Trump sues and tries to use the 12th amendment to overturn the election.
And who do you think is hiding in the Trogen horse? That‚Äôs the scary thought. What if Biden choses Pelosi for his vice. That would be a painful  out come üòÇüòÇüòÇ
That‚Äôs so fucking stupid.  No Trump supporter is putting up a Biden sign. They just wouldn‚Äôt put a sign up at all if that‚Äôs a case. Maybe they don‚Äôt all love Biden, but it definitely means they hate Trump.  Insanely naive and gullible.
Its been way obvious that yur wife doesn't like to even hold yur hand in Public,Are U jealous that Biden can have a woman on his arm!How many times did yur wife turn her head when U attempted to kiss her? On camera no less!!
I'm no fan of either Kamala Harris or Joe Biden, so trading on the currency of not wanting to be "offensive" or "unhelpful" is laughable.
Biden was polling at 5.4% before the IA caucus, and then dropped out after placing fifth, behind Clinton, Obama, Edwards, and Bill Richardson.
That's not historically how it has worked though, and setting up new rules for a certain candidate to fail at is biased. Joe Biden himself was selected for the VP after withdrawing after the IA caucus in 2008. Probably polling poorly, which is why he didn't want to go on to NH.

I suggest reading more in Biden rather that watching Trump's twitter posts. Dude doesn't know what he's talking about.

I could do without some of the crap Trump says, too. I just keep seeing clips of Biden seeming to lose track of what he saying, or saying things that make no sense.
I can agree with this, and still acknowledge that job one in this election is defeating the Traitor45 and that the best path for that, in this time and place, is voting for Biden.  Our ship is sinking, plug the holes, then fix the motor.

To be clear, voting for Biden first, knowing that what progressives are proposing are not radical, they are barely left, they do represent the best of what made us great, what made us the envy of the world, I would like to be #1 in the world for all the right reasons again.

Biden should only debate if Trump releases his taxes.
As old as Biden is... we may be announcing 47.
Regardless of whom he picks, it should be clear that his running mate (given Biden's mental health) will be the true Dem presidential nominee. So, I hope he picks a competent one. But I have my doubts that he will.
Cori Bush winning is great but I just don't understand how it happened. That district voted for Biden by 20 points.

And the DNC, knowing this, rigged the primary against Sanders for Biden anyway. We really must stop and consider what in the hell is going on.
Biden pulled Reagan to the right on some issues
When Joe Biden tells me and the homies, we ain't black....I beg to differ, cracka ass cracker!
Imagine putting "BLM" on your twitter page, just to vote for Biden, the guy who helped write the 1994 crime bill, that incarcerated blacks at a massive level...Maybe learn history? That's your savior? Jesus fuck me christ!
What say you, about Joe Biden authoring the 1994 crime bill, that incarcerated a record number of blacks? Why is that a good alternative to Trump?
You're assuming I'm a big fan of Biden only because I dislike trump. At this point it just feels like picking the best of two turds. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Tucker Carlson says it's 'probably illegal' for Joe Biden to pick a Black woman as vice president
While random hair sniffing is creepy, I don't think this builds a case of Biden having stupid facial expressions as you think it does. Nice try though.
YOU are the SWAMP. We will send you packing Nov 3rd. Vote 4 Biden

Anyways, I was reminded occasionally by boomer libs on Facebook that Bernie could never survive a red baiting campaign from the right during an election. Well, it seems no matter who runs (even Biden) or who‚Äôs considered, the red baiting was going to happen anyways.
Joe Biden should make all debates conditional, No Debates until Tax Returns are Released!
Plenty of examples of rigged primary. Not all of US want to vote for a war monger &amp; corrupt caplitist!  Cool Biden won. I will not be voting  for Biden.  It was Bernie or Tulsi &amp; no one else
If Trump gives his Nomination Acceptance Speech from the White House, shouldn‚Äôt Joe Biden be given the same opportunity?
Obama and Biden did fix America, now Biden will have to fix it again after Trump fucked it up
It's too bad that Bernie gave up &amp; gave in. It's also to bad that Bernie voted for the biggest transfer of wealth in US history-Cares Act.  Oh yea, it's too bad that Bernie is straight up lying to everyone telling US that Biden could be the most progressive President since FDR.
I‚Äôm under 1k.. fair warning I plan on voting for biden. But I acknowledge that he‚Äôs fucking terrible.

Biden, take the stupid test!  If you can walk and chew gum you‚Äôll ‚Äúace‚Äù it! Don‚Äôt be so scared!  Biden responds to Trump cognitive test challenge: "Why the hell would I?"
On this topic - Biden would listen to doctors and scientist not someone talking to a witch doctor.  The covid-19 pandemic was the topic 45 knew it was and tried to lie his way out of the mess he created.
Vote for Biden.
We will! BIDEN 2020!
Bowman already bent the knee to Biden. Then came out super excited when Obama endorse him.   I will leave out a little bit of hope, but it doesn't look good for bowman!!  I hope he proves me wrong
How long until trump tweets that Beirut explosion and says that it‚Äôs an orphanage in a white suburb that was attacked by antifa at the order of Joe Biden
Why Trump doesn't deserve a Biden debate  by
A day after the presidential election  will re-evaluate his covid phase? That figures.  If Biden wins these restrictions will magically vanish.  These politicians are very shallow.
You're an irrelevant headline reader.. You have no argument. If you prove you're a "millionaire" I'll guarantee a vote for Biden. You're another ridiculous failure who blames others for his struggles in life. Get a job bro. Once you start paying taxes get at me.
I WILL bully biden supporters the same way I bully trump supporters. You have actual dog shit for brains if you think they‚Äôre different

Communist Party Leader Officially Endorses Biden Bob Avakian suggested that while Biden still represents what he calls a ‚Äúmurderous system of capitalism-imperialism‚Äù the communist party leader still feels he is the better choice to align with their ideolog
LOL ... You think Joe Biden is "dodging" reporters  or your dad?  Dude ... Is this what you do, all day?  He will answer the serious questions ...,  *Can you get the U.S. out of the mess, Trump has us in? *Do you have a COVID-19 plan, going forward?  Is Eric Trump employed?
And Biden is the king of such nonsense
MIT did a study of 10 years of mail-in voting. The fraud was less than .00006%   #Biden crushes #trump on Nov 3 thank goodness !
The police issue is most local, so work on that there.  Biden is what we need right now.  We have to clean this mess up and then as we out it back together, we have build a better more equitable society.
Vote for Biden then smart guy
A debate question for Joe Biden: ‚Äú how often do you use DuckDuckGo?‚Äù üòá
Umm, Biden's son served. He cares!
A few years ago at the passing of   McCain and Bush we honored them with great Americans both opposed  Black issues. I threw up in my mouth then as I do now with thinking Joe Biden  "You ain't black" is an acting White Supremacist. Can't write/articulate racism and not be one!
Joe Biden is a White Domestic Terrorist  well. Voting against all Racism sounds brilliant. No more justifying it was 94 just repeal the racism. Blacks shouldn't serve more time on any level.
i‚Äôd rather suffocate on my own vomit than see Biden in office
Here is a Former Presidential candidate and front runner for the Biden cabinet on guns.     And here is the M4A plan that eliminates private health insurance. Aka private healthcare.    Two examples of you being debunked. As requested
Glad that Ben Jacobs is following up on these dirty tricks. It is so clearly a Republican ploy to pull votes from Biden.
I believe the DNC has already picked out his running mate. Don't be too surprised when they announce Hillary as Biden's running mate.
I bet you Biden totally understood her. His answer? Because the Squirrel has a grapefruit to drive.üòúüòú
3rd mass text message I got today asking if I‚Äôm voting for Biden.
Are you seriously suggesting that Biden struggles more than the President, who rarely strings anything together resembling a sentence and for whom two-syllable words are large?
we are protesting a racist establishment and they want us to vote for joe biden make it make sense
Bernie was running on UBI before he dropped out and Biden was running against it, and Yang still endorsed Biden. Grifters gonna grift.
It would make it clear whether or not Biden is suffering from dementia, though, wouldn't it? Is that why the Dems want to avoid a debate? Because they know Biden can't frame a coherent thought under pressure? Hope not.
Literally all 10 of these also apply to Joe Biden. They're also both rapists. Y'all let's turn out for sure: for the Green Party!! Then we get to work building an anti-Capitalist Left Coalition Party going forward. #GreenParty2020 #NotMeUs
Big CPC is a huge "RED FLAG"   They all voted for cares act. (They say no due to it was a voice vote) they all voted for the biggest transfer of wealth in USA history.  They had leverage back in early March &amp; choose to throw it all away due to Trump.   Biden is who's fucking hero
This is me speaking. This is the polling coming out during the democratic primary.  Your quote is total BS.   Have fun voting for Biden.
After the election and Joe Biden becomes POTUS, my answer to every question by Republicans about anything that Joe Biden does will be #BecauseFuckenTrump
Older black voters are more comfortable with Biden.  40 &amp; younger are way more comfortable with Bernie.  Older black voters simply came out more (2:1 ratio) and voted Biden.   If &amp; when. Iden becomes president watch Biden turn around &amp; stab all of his voters in the back.
Job one tiday is to get rid of The Traitor45, nothing else happens without that.  I am voting for Biden.  I encourage everyone to do the same.  The system is rigged to the two parties, agreed. We need to fix that, agreed. But first we save the country, then we reform.
Pretty sure Biden will have an excellent Secretary of State to handle that.
Obama was already the president. For two terms. Unlike you. And Biden is ahead of you by double digits.

Question? Does the Biden camp have a plan in place to combat trump when he launches his Nov 4th election strategy to load the courts with so many legal actions contesting the election results in all 50 states that determining the winner is impossible?

The Biden administration is not under any circumstances going after the former Trump administration for any crimes lol.
So, your paywall is shitty, plus, you're a never-biden, meaning you're a "Never read"
I think a lot of them have, but accept and support him because ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the *other* ‚Äòchoice‚Äô‚Äù. Much like how we‚Äôre trapped with a Biden/Trump election. Neither the  nor  *really* want change for the betterment of the average citizen, more than keeping their own in power.
At this late date it would do no good and make Trump look even more like he is chasing Biden rather than leading.
Yes, vote Blue, vote Biden not hate.
What if Biden asked you???
I think she's saying she can't due to her own status with voting, she wants to vote biden but is an immigrant or something.
Look, I've said it before and I'll say it again, I'm gonna vote for Biden because I think it will be very funny when Trump loses and I just want to feel like I helped make it happen.
I can understand your point and I‚Äôm not trying to troll you but not every American loves this country and it makes me sad I wish America could heal and mend our problems together as a team ! I get that you don‚Äôt like trump but I don‚Äôt like Biden or Clinton‚Äôs or any of the others
What a Joke, Coming from the man that put 50,000,000 people out of work, Largest GNP Drop in the history of the Country. Trump is Desperate, Lies is all he has. Bye #NobodyLikesTrump   Trump Warns That 'Jobs Will Disappear' If Biden Is Elected. Jaws Drop.
Ok that‚Äôs fair one article? Maybe two you can throw at me so your a joe Biden fan how do you feel about his sniffing and touching children... do you have kids would you let your kid or daughter be around joe Biden ?
If you could get Biden on board with only ONE of the big ticket bernie-esque policies, Ryan, which would it be? I'd choose Universal Health Care.
Some of us think that if either Trump or Biden is elected there will be a hard price to pay. How about we choose door number 3? Why not be that radical? It's doom or doom with one or other, right?
Or Biden could use the word Grand instead - it fits with 'malarkey' and the rest of Joe-lingo.

I don‚Äôt see indecisiveness. There really is no rush. Let Trump and his minions fret a little longer about whether they will need to replace Pence to try to counter Biden‚Äôs choice. It really is quite masterful.
We will!  BIDEN 2020!!
I won‚Äôt care if he picks a ladybug üêû with a wart on her nose, I am still going to continue to support and VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN &amp;___________!
The majority I see are like this here in the capital of WA state. Ive also seen a few that say, "I'm Republican but not a fool- Biden 2020"
Repeat after me Biden is a dirty old man Biden can‚Äôt run this country  because he has oatmeal for brains and last repeat after me I Alyssa will stop biting the hand that feeds me so help me Hanna.
Biden will need to raise taxes to clean up your mess.  Highest debt in history, highest deficit in history. Highest trade deficit in history. Highest unemployment since the Great Depression, and worst GDP since the Great Depression.  Revenues aren't even paying the debt interest
He has plenty of supporters on every tweet as well. Go give them shit.   Oh and the MAGAs you find in every Obama, Biden, Hillary, etc tweet.   Don‚Äôt be a hypocrite.
Conservative columnist George Will says he‚Äôs voting for Joe Biden in November: "The most important thing is to clear the ground so we can start over with American-normal politics."
WHY WOULD BIDEN DEBATE TRUMP???  Trump is incapable of : 1) interacting civilly 2) putting two thoughts  together coherently 3)shutting up when his time is up 4)resorts to personal attacks always!

To be fair, Biden is periodically stuck in the past 40% of the time as it is.
If Biden does not do what must be done to fix what the republicans have done during Bush43. And fix all the damage that trump has done. Pulling right Rs to fascism and the left Ds to be moderate republicans = Bush43. Then Tom Cotton will be the first Fascist Dictator of the USA.
Yep. And Biden is just the prez to do that. As for you, get to work on a pandemic plan. Death toll nears 160,000.

Trump does know how to distract and make the media chase a random shiny object. All of America knows better now. Vote for Biden
You realize this person isn't a Democrat right? They are in the Green Party. They've got no obligation to vote for the DNC nominee, not even someone as unelectable as Biden.   Perhaps you should campaign to get a real candidate to run against Trump, instead of being a bully.
Point with trump it will be him just hurling insults at Biden. With no real debate and i can see Biden staring down trump until he gives up and walks away or one of trumps lackeys gives him his syphalis meds to get him on track.

As Biden's VP decision nears, keep three categories in mind  via
From here, it's Warren, who happens to be on a call with Biden right now. No one knows policy AND inspires like Elizabeth Warren.
Old white men afraid of an ambitious woman are afraid she's better than they are, and that's not acceptable. She, or any woman, needs to stick to her guns and move forward no matter what. Biden should pick Kamala for that very reason. It'll show he's not afraid of her ambition.
I wish there was a gif of Biden calling that one guy Fat. And not as a descriptor but by name ‚ÄúListen here, Fat.‚Äù
Pompeo hit with subpoena after he‚Äôs caught assisting Senate GOP‚Äôs political smear of Biden -
He's part of it! How far away is Biden's island from Epstein's? Connect the dots!
The Trump kids are the best campaign ad for Biden ...  I love it.
Ultimately, Biden's election will be verified and he will take office.  The issue is that by inflaming trumpazoids, Donnie may incite guerilla violence vs. the government and random liberals (anyone with a Biden sticker on their car for starters).  It's a real &amp; scary possibility
Please VOTE.  If you are a US citizen, please register to vote.  Please vote.  We need not just a victory, but a huge landslide victory for Biden to get fascist Trump &amp; his enablers out of office.  Country over party.
There really is no rush. Let Trump fret about whether they will need to replace Pence due to Biden‚Äôs ultimate choiceUnless Biden is elected.
Kanye shouted out the quiet part. Oops.
Russia doesn‚Äôt want Biden to win. China doesn‚Äôt want Trump to win. We used to fight our battles using proxies.  Now WE are the proxy in THEIR battle.  Your MAGA hat brought us to the kids table. Happy now?

Maybe Donald is throwing in the towel? Should Biden just take it from here? Is that a hidden message you‚Äôve given?
Your words are marked.  I suppose if you are wrong on this (I suspect you are wrong on most things), it still would not convince you to vote for Trump.  Trump is articulate, says what he means and means what he says.  He is the opposite of Biden, who really can't say a sentence.
That's my point, I'm a gun owner for life, and I'll accept any regulation I have to follow. First thing Biden should do is ban assault rifles and pistols. Get back to hunting, target, and protecting the home, period.
I truly try to understand you VP Biden
You voting for Joe or against Trump.  Nobody in their right mind would vote for Biden.  Trump has had a very peaceful 4 years as POTUS, helped a lot of people and rebuilt our military.  I don't think he has been callous at all.  I guess I need some examples.  Trump 2020!
I 100% agree.  Let's get the vote out.  Let's see what kind of following the dems get after your campaign -- everyone needs to vote.  The future of America is on the line and Biden looks to destroy it!  Make it clear to all involved.  We like America the way it is!  Trump 2020!
OK, this stuff pisses me off.  Joe Biden is a devout Catholic. I may have my issues with Catholic dogma, but I have no reservations about Biden's beliefs in, or intentions toward, either Christianity or our nation.  How are evangelicals suckered by this despotic ass?
Biden refuses to refer to God.  He is the anti-religion candidate the way Obama was -- unless you want to consider the muslim religion.  I also think you are anti-God Mr Kristol.  I mean let's get serious here.
Jesus. Biden has owned that car since it was new, in '67. I'm not going to nail him to a cross for buying a car in his 20s AND THEN KEEPING IT IN GOOD CONDITION.  I hope when he's done with the country, it's restored to a similar condition.  Go find something else to bitch about.
God help us no. Trump and the shameful racist republicans are using him to attempt taking votes away from Biden. They. Are. Using. Him.
ha ha ha, my gosh, the man can not open his mouth without saying something stupid.  No wonder they are hiding him in the basement.  Debate anyone?  lol...  I dare them.  Even with questions handed out before debate, Biden would screw it up.
Of course they would, have you listen to Biden? Dude prob still thinks he‚Äôs the VP... another election of picking the of the one you hate the least ‚òπÔ∏è
Please lets just not do them. Although it would be entertaining to see Trump chasing Biden around the stage like he did Hillary. #SkipTheDebates
Pelosi and Biden have the same disease?  Amazing...
For Biden, it is obviously a tongue twister.  He can't think fast enough to solve the problem.  Wow!  Very very rare.
It is not.  That is not what Culp is being blamed for.  I wonder if you are a voter of Biden...  he is dangerous around kids...  Culp is not considered dangerous around kids.
How in the hell do you people vote for Biden?  He seriously has problems with little "girls" and treats them much differently than "boys".  You do realize that right?  Shit the guy is brain dead and it would not surprise me if he gets caught driving down the road naked one night.
As a not impressive citizen of these United States, I call BS on Ron Johnson
Not much better than Trump overall. The message from more than 275 delegates to the Democratic convention asks Joe Biden to choose aides who would implement a more progressive approach to global affairs.  # via
who's "former Joe Biden' does he go by something different now?
I wish Trumps Axios interview was doctored but sadly that really is our president. Having to doctor Biden‚Äôs means they‚Äôre trying to make trumps real cognitive issues look mild, so sad
Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
His people would be crazy to put a sundowning man with no filter on his mouth and a obstinate refusal to stick to prearranged talking points on a debate stage with an experienced debater like Biden. They know he‚Äôd be slaughtered.
Biden grew testy when CBS News correspondent Errol Barnett asked the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee about the matter in a recent interview. "No, I haven't taken a test? Why the hell would I take a test?" Biden said.
Either he is going to pre record his acceptance speech or he won't be around when he is replaced.  Are they are afraid of his screwing it up or how he will react to being replaced?  This is it folks.  Will the dems keep Biden or replace him.  Either way, pity for them NOT!
Guess who Bernie Sanders is going to vote for in November?  His good friend Joe Biden.
I am not a Democrat but it's sad to see Biden like this and his family doesn't see it.
Why's his wife always on TV explaining what Biden will do?
He did great.  290,000 flu deaths and 160,000 covid deaths.  We live with it just like we live with the flu.  It can not be stopped.  Trump 2020!  He did great.  What would you do Biden?  You tard!

When on earth is Joe Biden going to stop being a pussy? We all know that he‚Äôs afraid to debate Trump! He couldn‚Äôt hold his own with Trump on his best day! Because? Biden is a pussy! Plain and simple pussy pussy pussy! Biden is a pussy!
Like I said, I think Abrams has the charisma to drive voter turnout well over 60%.  However, I'll bet that Biden taps Kamala Harris. But I could be wrong. Especially since he just added two weeks to the vetting process.  Joe is showing that he won't waste his shots as Prez.
Wrong. The House picks the Pres. The Senate picks the Veep.   "The House named Mr. Biden president; the Senate and White House stuck with Mr. Trump. ... the nation stopped looking to the media for cues, and waited to see what the military would do."
What would a Biden scandal look like? Hunter Biden/Ukraine? Phony rape allegations? Those have already fallen flat. People want Trump gone, and they‚Äôre not going to fall for any more of Barr‚Äôs bullshit.
Keep your promise to the American people and debate Trump.  If you are not up to the task, then you can't run the country.  If you feel strongly about being the leader of the free world, you can not cower in a corner and run for president of USA.  The world is waiting, Mr Biden.
I believe Biden wants the focus on his running mate and him concurrent with the republican convention. With no press going it will be all on Biden which is a fanyptastic opportunity for the Dems if they do this right. I‚Äôm all for waiting for perfect timing
Biden can't debate Trump ... a teleprompter is not allowed nor is phone a friend‚ÄºÔ∏è
‚ÄúBiden will patch the hole, right the ship, and get us steaming in the right direction‚Äù  Voters will become impatient with the slow pace of recovery, and in 2024 will vote back into office the same gang of idiots who caused the problems in the first place.
Biden has not come out of his basement nor has he told us his plans.  Be very afraid of Biden, very very afraid, Heather.
Besides, it's not like Trump is a good faith actor in this scenario, so we're not going to get anything but gaslighting from his performance on stage, anyway.  By all means, Biden should refuse to debate Trump. There's no point.
As someone who has watched every presidential debate since he was 9 years old (Reagan v. Carter, "There you go, again"), I gotta say that I don't see any point in Biden debating Trump. We already know both sides' positions. And COVID is a real thing.
Understand, Biden signed the Bill's that made this possible.  They are both cancerous tumors that should be removed.
We know you will make it harder on us mr Biden. You are running on higher taxes, destruction of markets, and the green new deal. I actually can‚Äôt think of a single thing you do for the people of the USA. You will attack the bill of rights as well. Impressive resume.
Personally, I'd rather see Stacey Abrams (followed by an Abrams-AOC ticket in 2024) but I also see how Biden-Harris would work for many in 2020. They would get my vote  I like how  has been embracing more progressive values as a senator than she did as an AG.
Trump is intent on becoming dictator-for-life *because* he sees it as the only way to get into the same wealth stratum with Putin and Mogilevich.  He must be stopped,
meanwhile, I am not a reporter and if anyone on Joe Biden‚Äôs team wants to tell me who Joe plans on picking, let me know so I can convince him to pick Elizabeth Warren instead!
Tell Tara Reade about Biden's character.
So, honestly what zuck says here is true. I'd rather see that Trumpie boy and Biden Biddy are lying to us rather than have it be immediately taken down and never see that they actually attempted to lie. That's something that would affect my decision making greatly

It was never Biden... But the real candidate is soon to appear....!!!!!!
Won't know till everyone votes. Biden is definitely the lesser of 2 evils. But also definitely not a good choice.

I want Harris, but if Biden chooses someone else, I will still support him. I can‚Äôt allow another 4 years of Trump because I know the horrible impact he‚Äôs had on the people I love &amp; care about in my community. I would not do that to them or to myself. It‚Äôs bigger than a VP pick.

I don‚Äôt think Biden would be allowed to adopt a kitten. His latest interview...fuckin yikes.
"I don't want to defund police," Biden said. "I want to get police more money in order to deal with the things they badly need..."
Of course they would, have you listen to Biden? Dude prob still thinks he‚Äôs the VP... another election of picking the of the one you hate the least ‚òπÔ∏è
Who cares‚Äîexcept, possibly, the CNN activists? I have yet to see one rational idea come from the Democratic Party. Biden is irrelevant. It‚Äôs the warped party backing him that will give Trump victory‚Äîand I won‚Äôt be even vote for Trump.
In HuffPost 2016, I read an article that "trump raped a virgin (age 13), at Epstein's home in NY. He raped her, hit her, then threatened her and her family if she told. She still lives in fear."  #IBelieveHer #Predatortrump #Survivingtrump  DO NOT EVER compare trump to VP Biden.
Like I said...I like her and if he chooses her than I‚Äôm A okay with that. I‚Äôm certainly not going to get mad and threaten to not vote for Biden.
Yes! A lot of the people in the ‚Äúrunning‚Äù would make fantastic members of Biden‚Äôs cabinet! I‚Äôm good with whom ever he chooses! I trust him and his advisors.
Calling someone who has only been in government for 3 years and yet you defend politicians like Biden who have been in power for fifty years plus. And blaming trump for problems they couldn‚Äôt solve in that time. What a double standard.
I wish Trumps Axios interview was doctored but sadly that really is our president. Having to doctor Biden‚Äôs means they‚Äôre trying to make trumps real cognitive issues look mild, so sad
Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
His people would be crazy to put a sundowning man with no filter on his mouth and a obstinate refusal to stick to prearranged talking points on a debate stage with an experienced debater like Biden. They know he‚Äôd be slaughtered.
Biden grew testy when CBS News correspondent Errol Barnett asked the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee about the matter in a recent interview. "No, I haven't taken a test? Why the hell would I take a test?" Biden said.
Guess who Bernie Sanders is going to vote for in November?  His good friend Joe Biden.
I don‚Äôt care who Biden picks. Everyone that‚Äôs been on his short list would be amazing. He could pick Barney the Dinosaur and I‚Äôm still voting for him.
Please remember, when you vote for our future president Joe Biden, also vote to flip the Senate too.  Otherwise, we will continue to have Mitch McConnell sabotage all the wonderful things Joe Biden wants to do to heal and repair the damage Trump has done to the US!!
....but will Biden KNOW where he is or who he is‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Kamala Harris' Odds to Be Biden's VP Now -180; Susan Rice Second-Favorite at +300
Do you really know what Joe Biden is the Democratic Party he's the sucker and the only thing left is the stick that's good
All you haters on Twitter you didn't listen you're running Joe Biden you're going to lose keep telling you Mark Cuban or Die Hard
Like I said, I think Abrams has the charisma to drive voter turnout well over 60%.  However, I'll bet that Biden taps Kamala Harris. But I could be wrong. Especially since he just added two weeks to the vetting process.  Joe is showing that he won't waste his shots as Prez.
What would a Biden scandal look like? Hunter Biden/Ukraine? Phony rape allegations? Those have already fallen flat. People want Trump gone, and they‚Äôre not going to fall for any more of Barr‚Äôs bullshit.
How about a Fucking Debate?? Where we can SEE the Presidental reactions!! Most ppl. Vote after Debates!! And if Joe F‚Äôing Biden Can‚Äôt then we know the TRUTH!! Think ü§î Ppl.... TRUMP2020üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏
I don't care who Biden selects for VP as long it isn't a Sarah Palin!
I believe Biden wants the focus on his running mate and him concurrent with the republican convention. With no press going it will be all on Biden which is a fanyptastic opportunity for the Dems if they do this right. I‚Äôm all for waiting for perfect timing
Are you serious? Name one  thing  Biden has accomplished. He didn't do shit when he was younger,  what makes you think he'll do shit now. What a joke.
Biden can't debate Trump ... a teleprompter is not allowed nor is phone a friend‚ÄºÔ∏è
Please stop pretending JoeBiden is anything but a corporate tool pushed by the corrupt DNC. He‚Äôs better then Trump just leave it at that. It‚Äôs complete bullshit that we have that as our choice, the platform committee has shown who Biden is going to work for, it‚Äôs not the ppl.
Let me repeat this as well before he croaks. Clyburn is also an epic big pharma tool who served them well when he endorsed lobbyist loving Biden for the benefit of his donors, and to the detriment of working class Americans. Don‚Äôt ever forget
Biden-20 is way scarier than Covid-19..  Take the red pill.
‚ÄúBiden will patch the hole, right the ship, and get us steaming in the right direction‚Äù  Voters will become impatient with the slow pace of recovery, and in 2024 will vote back into office the same gang of idiots who caused the problems in the first place.
im not just voting for joe biden, im voting for 2 scotus positions, a cabinet, and a vp. doing anything else would be dumb ‚ù§Ô∏è
2  reasons the ENTIRE WORLD wants Joe Biden for POTUS. 1. Biden is honest. 2. Biden has integrity. 3. Biden has compassion. 4. Biden has actual experience for the job. 5. Biden has respect of all world leaders. 6. Biden IS NOT trump! Oops, 6 reasons! ü§£üòÜ I can do more. Can you?
trump is now spewing that Joe Biden is going to send the "inner city" to the suburbs, bringing crime and lowering property values.  He's citing the current unrelated protests as an example. Feds and all!  Where has he been Republicans? He's your "stable genius"!  (Continued) 3of4
The idea you can essentially ‚Äúsit out‚Äù and not actually have your life altered is privilege at its finest. A vote for Biden is a vote against fascism and the dismantling of our democratic republic.
Biden has said NUMEROUS things that if Trump had said them would be labeled as a racist. In addition to that Biden TRIED TO PREVENT THE COURTS From allowing desegregating schools.
20 years of fame and the spotlight and only became racist once he ran for president as a republican (he was a democrat most his life). I promise you if he would have ran as a democrat there would be zero accusations of racism. Just look at Biden.
Kind of agree with this. But who knows maybe it‚Äôs time. 2/3 of Biden‚Äôs voters are voting against Trump, not voting because it‚Äôs Biden. Not that that inspires much but that‚Äôs the only option we got after the dnc forced it on us.
You wanna talk about dementia?? Joe Biden forgot where he was and is always forgetting what he‚Äôs saying in the same sentence... a Biden presidency is a doom for America. Trump ain‚Äôt my first pick but I‚Äôll take him over Sleepy Joe
Personally, I'd rather see Stacey Abrams (followed by an Abrams-AOC ticket in 2024) but I also see how Biden-Harris would work for many in 2020. They would get my vote  I like how  has been embracing more progressive values as a senator than she did as an AG.
Trump is intent on becoming dictator-for-life *because* he sees it as the only way to get into the same wealth stratum with Putin and Mogilevich.  He must be stopped,
meanwhile, I am not a reporter and if anyone on Joe Biden‚Äôs team wants to tell me who Joe plans on picking, let me know so I can convince him to pick Elizabeth Warren instead!
Biden has more integrity and intelligence in his little pinky than the current idiot.
Bass should no longer be considered. I would still vote for Biden if he chose her but I would not be able to relax with her next in line. I cannot trust a Scientology supporter. Scientology abuses children and vulnerable adults.
Well if he was looking for a way to guarantee younger to middle age voters would vote for Biden he‚Äôs done it. He thought Tulsa was a problem wait until they get done with him now.
Biden didn't write this. He can't put two sentences together...suckers.

Joe Biden will last 3 mo until K Harris gets sworn in.
I'm voting for Biden but there are significant policy differences between centrist D's and progressives. Centrists are the true conservatives trying maintain status quo.  Biden, Pelosi and Schumer seem entrenched in 1990s political rules. We need new ideas.
Yep, and he was taken to task for it.
Ammon Bundy doesn't believe in law enforcement at all. I know of not one liberal or person left of Joe Biden who does not believe in the police force. The way it's funded and how those funds are used is totally different than believing in no police.
This aged well.
Biden really is an idiot.
Please let is go back to school! My hubby, who is an elementary teacher, is driving me crazy. He is now writing a disparaging song for Joe Biden and a second verse for his Hillary song. I may lose my mind!üôÑ
What happens if Joe Biden will be president?
The former Vice President says the goal of his plan is to give young people more options to ‚Äúlive, work, and raise the next generation in rural America.‚Äù.
Biden did in the spring and was told he was delusional. Jokes on those other idiots
And Biden‚Äôs cognitive abilities have been challenged?  You were played by Trump this whole time. Check today‚Äôs tweet by the dimwit in charge.
I won‚Äôt vote for either Trump or Biden. I will, however, attempt to vote out every Democrat on the federal, state, and local elections. The voices coming from the Democrats are: a senile, corrupt hollow man lifer‚Äîa funnel which the Marxist style element will flow through.
Dont worry about Biden, get trump out.
Our economy was great under Obama / Biden. Our economy crashed under Trump. We can't afford another four more years of Trump.
I‚Äôve read it. We already have evidence that Obama directed the whole corrupt operation.
You‚Äôve missed something. Indictments don‚Äôt need to reach Obama/Biden to incriminate them, only their close officials. We already have plenty of evidence in the public domain.
He directed it. We have the records of the White House meeting where Obama led the whole thing. January 5th 2017.
He‚Äôll change his mind when the indictments pile up on Obama/Biden administration.
Name a reason you not voting for BIDEN without mentioning TRUMP
Will, what did you honestly expect....the corrupt protecting the corrupt! Durham and Barr gonna make "swamp" very uncomfortable for the next few months....Biden needs to be worried, he was dead caught in the middle of this abomination of a presidential coup!
The subject was "being creepy" per you. Trump talking about dating his daughter isn't creepy?  Um ok..üòÇüòÇüòÇ Let me break this down for you.  If Joe Biden was a paper sack of potato peels, he would be a better, more effective president than Trump could be on his very best day.
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report

What people don't understand about my outrage is I have no real problem w/Harris or Biden being on the ticket.    What I have a major problem with is BOTH on ticket &amp; NO Progressive representation on the ticket.
Trump has already said he won't accept Biden winning.  Nothing new here.
Bullshit, Biden is far more intelligent than the clowning tge while house. Thighland, Yo se mites, and let's not forget 2 Corinthians.
To: Mitch McConnel Ya know, it's one thing for your GOP folks to slant questions during hearings to "get the other side of the story"  It's quite another for Ron Johnson to blatantly say that he is using his committee to get dirt on Biden for the sole purpose of electing trump
Gotta love the deflection. Biden‚Äôs gaffes are dementia, it‚Äôs elder abuse.
More deflection. It‚Äôs hard to accept where this‚Äôs going, isn‚Äôt it? Indictments are coming for the Obama/Biden administration.
So......when Biden is Inaugurated, would you prefer he quote Gerald Ford....re: Nixon "Our long National nightmare is over" or should he say...re: trump "All of our National dreams have come true"
How is there not an age limit on who can run for president? Like this man Biden is 77 years old, would be 78 going into office. Like what?? The average life expectancy for a male in the US is 76 üòÇ
Except, this one won‚Äôt fall apart because of Obama/Biden and Mueller corruption.
Imagine if Biden or Obama or Hillary announced to the nation they they were "coordinating" with the Treasury Secretary to give "payments" to the American people without Congressional approval?
And we know she is voting for Biden-Harris
Biden and Harris will end this national nightmare we are living in.  Hands down, they will restore civility, stop the racism, stop the madness Ttump has brought down on all of us.  So pack your bags cause you going down too.

Prevaricator trump is saying Kamala Harris (who was born in California) does not meet the citizen requirements. Who else will he falsely accuse? My senseless neighbor came over to tell me that Biden will need to pick another running mate. Fox news does it again.
Biden doesn't inspire me even by 1/10ths of the way Obama did.  If that doesn't tell you how jaded I am about the elections, nothing will. This shit needs to end.
If he truly 'understood what he posted was wrong' he never would've posted in the first place  wait for it ~ trump will come to his defence  Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  via
She made him cry.   I can't wait to see what will happen when the Biden/Harris take office.
Such a lier can you even tell the truth once. I tell ya you don‚Äôt deserve to be Biden‚Äôs VP. You disgrace the position.
Congratulations! I'm so VERY happy Joe Biden made you his choice for his running mate! You'll make a superb VP!
My 91 yr old Mom,  just called to tell me that she had decided in Jan 2017 to vote for Biden in 2020.  Me: Mom, are you OK? Mom: I'm fine, why? Me: Um, Joe wasn't running then Mom: I know, what I meant was I'd vote for any Dem who could fog up a mirror on election day.  Whew!!
Medical Advisor to Biden: If all Americans wear masks for 3 months we can save 40,000 lives Biden: Then we will order it  Medical Advisor to trump: (same as above) trump: I might lose votes if I order that, so no.
Biden/Harris 2020.  Yea baby!!!
Even if masks are required in heavily populated areas or areas where #COVID19 cases are high... cases aren't high everywhere. For example, would you force someone to wear a mask on a ranch in Wyoming? Biden/Harris and many of their supporters sound like control freaks to me.
So will she announce she is supporting the Biden/Harris ticket to avoid past missteps at the Republican convention?
Biden and Harris just had a private meeting with a number of advisors, including former Fed Chair Janet Yellen....  I would loved to have heard the discussion about the current Fed action of buying  corporate stocks to prop up the market.
And he may have a stroke if Biden names you Attorney General...... Please, please Joe.....just do it

Sudden thought just occurred to me: If #TrumpKillsUSPS, doesn't that also affect his base of voters as well--not just Biden and the Democrats?
Too bad it won't happen with the Biden Harris ticket.
I'm not young and I'm not going to vote for Prez/VP, only for down ballot.    My state is a guaranteed win for Dems. Biden doesn't even bother to campaign here. The elections are called before they even start counting my state's votes. My vote literally does not matter.

The media will continue to attack kanye simply for the fact that he takes voters away from Biden.

Biden-Harris ticket platform surveys this morning removed Green New Deal and all the rest of the progressive issues from their "Important Issues"  list.  So those aren't even party of the Wallstreet ticket platform.

Saunders: Ask if Biden‚Äôs supporters will accept the results
Covid19 is a perfect analogy for American politics. Trump is the virus, and Biden is a mask. The mask is uncomfortable, and you're not happy you have to wear it, but you understand that if you don't it will literally cost lives so you wear it, because it's the right thing to do.
Does anybody else ever feel personally attacked by Trump? Because he's going after social security and affordable housing, and my medical care, and my LGBTQ community and my vagina. Then all these privileged white guys on my feed take a "never Biden" stance that could kill me.
Cannabis leaders react to Biden‚Äôs choice of Kamala Harris: Will she help or hurt marijuana legalization?
How can someone throw stones at Biden for a sexual assault allegation and simultaneously try to bully someone on Twitter by using sexually suggestive heresay as the anecdote?  Oh, they‚Äôre a trump supporter who also retweets sexual abuse ignorers (Jim Jordan). You are no patriot.
Biden is accused of ONE horrible crime and no one knows what happened. We do know the accuser changed their story multiple times. I dont use moral high ground to claim it‚Äôs acceptable or not. Trump has been accused of raping multiple women and a child too. You‚Äôre morally inept.
Are you talking about Alabama‚Äôs Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General that was confirmed in the senate by republicans only? Betsy DeVos? Trump? Biden has progressed from his stances from 40 years ago while republicans senators and the current president and staff still support it?!
Even Biden?
No.  And Warren would be forced to betray her progressive beliefs to enforce Biden/ Harris Wallstreet agenda.
I'm in a, Blue State where Right-Leaning Wallstreet Dems Biden/ Harris don't even bother to campaign.  They don't care about us because they call the elections before including our electoral votes. They don't give a damn about progressives. So they won't miss it when I don't vote
I feel like Biden picked Harris just to add diversity.
No.  I would have been okay with Karen Bass too.  She has progressive cred.  But Progressives are being denied representation in any power seat.  Right-Leaning Dems like Biden/ Harris take us for granted. Don't even campaign in my blue state. My vote doesn't matter to them.
I lived through Reagan years.  Biden is damn close to a Reaganite
She jumps on the bandwagon after she thinks it will get her points.  Her campaign was Right-Leaning which is why Biden picked her and Wallstreet is celebrating.
Biden and Harris would have been considered Reagan Dems in the 80s. They've moved the "center" way to the Right.  Wallstreet is celebrating.    I'm in a Blue state so they won't miss me not voting for Pres.  They don't even campaign here.
Still not going to support them.  My state is Blue. Progressives are the only ones that listen to us.  Biden &amp; Harris don't represent Progressives.  So they won't miss my vote.  I'm voting down ballot but will vote None on President/VP
They don't even campaign here because Washington is a reliably Blue state.  The only ones who have cared are Progressives.  Biden &amp; Harris don't care about our votes.  So why bother when my vote won't matter.
First off,  they're to the right of most Dems.    But... here's the only selling point necessary  Biden/ Harris aren't Fascists like Trump/ Pence
I'm not a Bernie fan.  Biden could have united the party by picking Warren.  Instead her picked a Wallstreet,  Right-Leaning,  "Law&amp;Order " cop
Cool. You didn‚Äôt even bring one single rational reason to the thread for your prejudices towards Biden and your unequivocal support for Trump. Your commentary was completely full of hypocritical bipartisan hacks. The fact you cant even promote a single rational reason says It all
Your point? That you hold Biden to a much higher standard than you do with Trump and Republicans? There‚Äôs video of Trump lying about cheating on his wife and wishing child self traffickers well. Your political hack jobs are a disgrace to free speech and the american way.
It was over 40 years ago. Again, why endorse republicans who have/had the same opinion yet attack Biden for it? Cause you and others with the same sentiment have no moral compass at all. You are not a patriot. Patriots don‚Äôt use their freedom to promote hypocrisy. Despicable.
Why do you care about what Biden did 45 years ago? Republicans were the masterminds behind segregation laws and DeVos and Trump are trying to bring it back yet you use It as a talking point to attack Biden? You have no moral compass. Is this how we make America great again?
Your partisan hacks here are anti-American and unpatriotic reasons for  bigotry. If you‚Äôre going to try to use talking points to discredit Biden don‚Äôt use ones that overly discredit Trump too. Make them at least rational. How do you only have hypocritical talking points?
That Trump is exponentially more of a racist than Biden. True. Yet you‚Äôre still voting for Trump? Thanks for clarifying your rationale behind your support for Potus 45. Trying to argue not to support Biden cause he‚Äôs racist when Trump is quantifiablly more racist is unpatriotic.
It‚Äôs pathetic that supporters of Trump even try to bring up the race card when attempting to discredit Biden. How patriotic and American. Way to Make America Great Again. One hypocritical and biased opinion after another to justify your prejudices and ignorance.
Racist you say? When did Biden take out multiple newspaper ads calling for the death of black teenagers that didn‚Äôt even commit a crime and then refuse to apologize or admit wrongdoing when it was proven they were innocent? He didn‚Äôt? Who did? Trump you say?! What a rarionale.
Q: Have you sent this same tweet to Biden? If not, why?
And now we're really pissed off.  We'll vote out the fascist,  but are not going to support the Corporate Right-Leaning Biden/ Harris Admin when they're in office.
She doesn't even respect Biden. She must be drunk on power. Where is her personal integrity. Oh, maybe she doesn't have any.i
Yeah.  Warren was gracious,  letting Biden take credit of her plans revised for COVIDtimes.  Biden used them to get support.   And has now clearly signaled with Harris as VP nom,  that he will NOT be working towards them at all.  They both would have been Republicans 40 yes ago
No they won't because we're being denied representation at the table. We have to choose Biden for less abuse but it's still Wallstreet Right-Leaning abusive policies.
More than half of the Democratic Party is being denied a power seat to represent us.  This is nothing short of major regressive move for the Dem party even if we are required to vote for Biden to get rid of Fascists.  It's still a hostage transfer situation to just less abuse
Does NOT mean I support Biden/ Harris in ANY way except to get Trump out then throw them out in 2024!
We have nothing to vote FOR , only AGAINST.  That's all because we're being denied representation in the seats of power.  So we vote AGAINST Trump Fascism by being forced to vote for Biden/ Harris Right- Leaning Wallstreet regressive ticket.
One of my fb friends is all mad. She‚Äôs big mad! But claims she‚Äôll vote for Biden anyway.  She‚Äôs railing about KH because of Bernie blah blah blah...
Didn't Trump just say yesterday the pandemic of 1917 (1918) ended the second world war. Yeah, he did. So at this point which old guy do you trust more? My money is on Biden. Cause Trump is Putins puppet.
Wait...was Joe Biden not vice president to president Obama for 8 years?

Yeah.  Warren/AOC 2024 and AOC 2028. If we survive the right- leaning Biden-Harris years.  But as older working poor with disabilities,  I'm going to be screwed for 4 more years either way.
Well,  I won't vote for Harris in 2024 unless the only alternative is another Fascist.  That's the only reason to vote for Biden/ Harris if you're a progressive.  I want more representation than "At least we're not Fascists. "
It hasnt happened in 4 years, but we *can* actually hold politicians accountable for their bullshit while in office. That is a thing we can normally do.  I just hope Biden's actually ready for the broke, sick, angry, radicalized nation he's about to inherit.
The electoral college says otherwise. I'm voting Jo Jorgensen, but in my state I'm sure Biden will win, so it doesn't really matter who I vote for. But at least I voted for the person I think would do the best job.
We'll vote for Biden,  because we have been FORCED to become One- Issue voters since we now have zero representation on the ticket.  Our only issue is voting Trump out. You can't make it into any kind of good, though. Because the Right-leaning Dem ticket betrays working poor.
Like the single issue voters voting to get Trump out? Because Biden Harris is crap for representing me.  The only reason they get my vote is because the alternative is Fascism.  I may puke voting for them, but I'll do it. Even knowing that they have it out to destroy Progressives
They will never fix it.  They are Wallstreet darlings.  That's why Wallstreet is celebrating Biden picking Harris.  Progressives have been betrayed again.
I didn‚Äôt say Biden wants to kill it. Their party is moving that way. Look at their up and comers.  says he loves capitalism all the time. I‚Äôm just pointing out the insanity of voting for bigger government instead of smaller. Trump needs to go. But not to these two.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden as a stop gap. But  we should all buy ARs.
Also,  remember Cabinet members are usually a short term career ending job.  She wouldn't go back to the Senate.  None of her policies would be implemented.  Except for the ones Biden &amp; Harris have stolen to pad their lack &amp; pretend they will work for ordinary Americans.

Did Joe Biden take out newspaper ads to wrongfully convict black teens of murder and refuse to apologize or admit wrongdoing when they were finally exonerated and freed? Didn‚Äôt think so. Who did? Oh, yeah. That was Trump
I‚Äôm confused. You claim you‚Äôre tough on crime and all this video does is claim Biden is too. How does this make you look good exactly? If anything, It makes him appeal to more conservative voters. Are you conceding already? It will save lives if you do.
Kamala worked with Joe Biden's son, Beau. He has a soft spot for her.
Except Biden/ Harris is a Wallstreet,  Right-Leaning, "Law &amp; Order " ticket that only pays lip- service to progressive causes.  Their slogan may as well be "We're Not Fascists Like The Other Side", because that's the only thing getting them elected.
Biden proved today that he does not support working poor Americans. We'll vote for him instead of Fascism,  but he won't be making any progressive changes like we need.
Don't lecture me.  I know better than you having lived through it.  There were excellent choices to move in a progressive direction at a time when it would be supported because of Trump and COVID.  Instead Biden picked Wallstreet "Law &amp; Order" after stealing Warren's work.
Unless Schumer quits and manages to appoint her to Dem Senate Leader--OR--Biden recinds his requirement for SCOTUS nominees to be Black,  there's no adequate position that she should accept.  Everything else is just being a mouthpiece forced to promote someone else's policies
I wish I could of seen Joe Biden‚Äôs reaction when they told him who his running partner was ü§£
People like WALLSTREET who are celebrating getting their right- leaning corporate Dem ticket?  Only reason there's any progressive support is bc alternative is fascism. It's only lip-service/won't enact ANYTHING progressive. Biden has signaled no seat for Progressives at table
Biden would have never picked Kamala if Fentanyl Floyd never died
We will never get Warren as Dem Senate Majority/ Minority Leader. Schumer won't step down &amp; Corporate, Blue Dog,  Law &amp; Order Dems like Harris would never vote for her to be.   Biden rejected her for SCOTUS because she isn't Black.  There are no more power seats for Progressives
If she were in the Cabinet,  she would be forced to enact the regressive right- leaning policies of Biden/ Harris.  Only a mouthpiece lackey without the power to make progressive change.  It's a short term crap. Career ending job.
I am kinda "meh" about the Kamala Harris VP pick. This has been the rumor for the last few months. I will vote for Biden but only because the alternative is far worse.
are democrats who are saying they‚Äôre going to refuse to vote for biden/harris really fine with trump winning again???
I said I would vote for the lesser evil.  That doesn't mean I will support the evil.  I'm voting AGAINST Trump. Not because I like or support a Biden Harris agenda.
She would be forced to run BIDEN'S Treasury, not hers.  Not progressive
Celebrating Biden/Harris 2020
Tell it to Biden who has denied Progressives representation.
No.  We're not.  I'll vote Biden/ Harris,  but I will not support their regressive agenda that denies Progressives a seat in one of the power positions.
Warren was SHUNNED by people like Biden who refused to support her for heading the CFPB even though she created it!!!!
And all of that is driven by POTUS, VP, SENATE Leaders,  etc.  Cabinet just are mouth pieces to do the work.  Warren would be blocked from making Progressive changes by Biden and Harris.    This is a bullshit move and Progressives won't forget it.
My advice is once Biden is in, we all should start a movement aimed at kicking out the chair from under the Corporate Democrats. First order of business: Ranked Choice Voting in all 50 States. Second order of business (can be concurrent): Find and run actual leftist candidates.
No.  POTUS. VP. Senate Dems Leader. House Dems Leader. SCOTUS.   Those are the positions with power. Biden has already ruled EW out of SCOTUS because she isn't Black.  The others are not open or up to him. They won't happen.  So,  yeah.  The Progressive Wing is betrayed again.
More people are excited about Kamala Harris than Joe Biden. Which is so funny because yall didn't support her months ago when she could've been the front.
I'm voting Against Trump.  It just so happens that means I have to vote for Biden/Harris.  I will NOT "support" them though. Progressives and Elizabeth Warren deserves seat at table of power. Anything less than Senate Dem leader or SCOTUS is an insult. We know those won't happen

Yeah.  Great motivating.  "Vote Biden/ Harris! We're Against Progressives,  But At Least We're Not Trump/Pence"  I hate the Dem party right now.  Just not quite as much as I hate the GOP.
The Biden-Harris ticket is like the movie AIR FORCE ONE, but better. :)
you damn well her and Joe Biden are 1,000,000 times better than your pathetic traitor self and your little pee on Pence Nov 3 YOU ARE FIRED YOU SOB
This long list is precisely why I think  shit the bed. When these facts get used by Trump, the entire Biden campaign is fucked. Susan Rice was the safer option. Why pass her over?!
Picking Sen. Kamala Harris after her speaks volumes on Joe Biden's character/judgement.  He DNW a sycophant lap dog(Pence), he want's his own "Joe Biden." A trusted, competent partner that helps get shit done. With a Trans Am. She should get one.
Hot Take: Would've been better if  had  replace William Barr instead of being the VP.  This is white, and fucked up as hell. I'm fully expecting things to be the same under Biden as they were under Trump, because clearly both of them have lost their marbles.
We get more of this with Trump. I don‚Äôt think any reasonable person is arguing against that, and I wasn‚Äôt either  However, the tyranny of the oligarchy remains unchallenged under a Biden presidency and that‚Äôs a fact  It‚Äôs the reason they knifed Bernie ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Or Biden dropping and we have a Michelle Obama - Kamala Harris ticket?
So it will be Michelle Obama and Kamala, with Biden dropping out?
Yeah,  because Biden and Harris will NOT be fighting for us after election day.   Right now the best that can be said of Biden/Harris is "They aren't Trump/Pence"
The only thing great that is going to be going on in the WhiteHouse is you leaving so that President Biden and Vice President Harris can come in and clean up your mess.
Joe Biden picked a narc right in the middle of an anti-cop eraüòÇ I‚Äôm üíÄ
Crap job.  She needs to be in a Power Seat.  Not stuck to the side.  Only Senate Dem leader would be a suitable position. Or SCOTUS. Schumer won't step aside &amp; she isn't Black so Biden has said he won't appoint her.
What is the over/under on how many days till Hidin Biden resigns and Kamala takes the nomination?
In a minor role of anything. Unless she is on SCOTUS (which she has already been excluded from nom by Biden because she isn't Black) or Senate Majority/ Minority Leader,  which we know won't happen, then this is an insult to the progressive base that has fought &amp; fundraised.Biden's plan would provide coverage for many more low income people than would be under Trump, so by your own stated value, it is a moral imperative to vote for Biden ... if you truly believe even one low income person's life is worth electing someone you don't particularly like.
Romney endorsing Biden in October should help
I enjoy the optimism here and I think it's worth the campaign's time for what it could do down ballot, but I'm not hinging my hopes on GA. If Biden wins GA, he's winning EC handily through other means.
Citizens! We must bring to bear the full power of language, wielded as a veritable sword of rhetoric by god-men to fend off the darkness! GIVE SARAH COOPER THE BIDEN TWITTER ACCOUNT!
trump is defunding the postal service and undermining voting by mail so that everyone has to go out and vote, he knows due to the corona virus that his supporters are more likely to vote in person that Biden‚Äôs, thus giving him the vote advantage
Joe #Biden and the Great #Leaders of 2020 Are Part of a #Club. #leadership #election #trump
A major union representing U.S. postal workers has endorsed Joe Biden for president, a move that comes as President Trump has acknowledged starving the postal service of money in order to make it more difficult to vote by mail in November‚Äôs election.
It's going to be pretty tame. Any right wing protest in the last several years has boiled down to about half a dozen fat white guys who are forgotten in a day or so.  You'll survive Biden's presidency. Don't be a drama queen.
If Biden endorsed a Maoist "shovel ready" program to deal landlords, I'd be down üòè
By all means, poke fun at Biden for being old and forgetting what office he‚Äôs running for. He probably can‚Äôt use an iPhone, has to get his assistant to dial for him. He is still creepy around women, and he rambles... But his phone placement is perfectly fine. Again, try it.
To the folks poking fun at Biden for holding his iPhone ‚Äúupside down‚Äù, with the speakers &amp; mic away from himself. Since the original iPhone, I‚Äôve pointed my speakers to the closest vertical surface and not myself. Sound is better after bouncing back. Try it. Mic works fine, too.
I‚Äôll bet you a paycheck that all the looting and rioting stops when Joe Biden becomes president.
Tell me how many people died from the Obama Biden administration. Oh wait that's right they stopped counting.
Joe Biden understands that the only thing that resonates with Middle America is the Friends episode where Joey gets his head stuck in a Turkey.
Biden is a very devout Catholic and Tobin should examine is own conscience.

We‚Äôre trying to escape dictatorship. I understand you don‚Äôt love Biden. However, it‚Äôs a vote, not a marriage. Please #voteBlue.
Biden on the other hand is easy to ignore. We‚Äôve ignored him for 40 years. He never won the Dem nomination after several tries (&amp; technically didn‚Äôt win this one either) &amp; Kamala dropped out after getting only 2%  in primaries. Compare that to Trump. It‚Äôll be a Trump landslide.
The Fuck Trump Party endorses Biden and Harris for their platform plank of not being Trump.   Fuck Trump for a Better Tomorrow Fuck Trump for a Better America
Oh thank you. I'm an Indep. I vote cross ticket. I'm looking out what is best, and it isn't Biden/Harris unless they change their messages - it isn't working for me.
Alright everybody say it with me and say it from the chest; FUCK Joe Biden and FUCK Kamala Harris. Both have absolutely terrible political records.
Biden is just some old guy reminiscing about the good old days before the house was on fire.
Do not allow Trump to cause more damage. Vote Biden
1. Biden has *explicitly* stated he opposes defunding the police, along with a substantial majority of elected democrats 2. What trans issues? Equal protection under the law? 3. Full term infants are not aborted and no one is suggesting we do so

Both choices are bad choices. Will I vote Biden? Yes, but regretfully.  We have fallen off a cliff, one choice lets us continue free fall, the other choice gives us a parachute.   With Biden we will still be falling and in trouble but there might be time to find another solution.
Biden needs help with his Pampers first then his pants
It's great that you can't stand Biden-Harris. But the nasty memes &amp; links you're sharing, are probably circulated by the russians. You're playing right into their hands. I'm not 100% satisfied, either. But we got to do what we can to get that demon out of the white house, pronto!
I guess that's why white women are LYING, claiming to be black women to get higher paid jobs.  Over half a century the Democratic Party has systematically DESTROYED the black middle class family, &amp; created chains of poverty for black people. Biden is the enemy, not the friend.
1st Biden said your not black if you vote for Trump...now he said we're not good citizens if we don't wear masks. All the time, outside wear masks... You really going to vote for this trash America?
This should be in EVERY Biden campaign ad. #BidenHarris #JoeBiden
They wanted her as POTUS &amp; when that wasn‚Äôt going to happen, they pulled her out so she couldn‚Äôt face #Tulsi like criticism. She‚Äôs who they wanted. Dems don‚Äôt pick their candidates. Now they‚Äôll push her to POTUS in front of #Biden &amp; push him out. ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù
If you are a U.S. citizen, and you do not vote for Biden, I never want to speak to you again. You can unfollow me now.
Joe Biden just said today that if he is elected he and Kamala will mandate EVERYONE in the country to wear masks INSIDE AND OUTSIDE for 3 Straight Months. üò≥üò≥ #Trump2020
in the 4 years Biden is protecting DACA, my friend and hundreds others may be able to get permanent citizenship. It's not kicking the can down the road for them.
Remember when they said ‚Äúmoving the embassy to Jerusalem was going to blow up the region‚Äù ... it didn‚Äôt happen. They‚Äôre lying to you.   GOP new voter registration in swing states &amp; fund raising totals don‚Äôt support your Biden win theory. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I'm well aware of Obama's terrible record on immigration.  It's very easy for us folks with no stake in the game to say it's no worse under Trump, but for the people I know who ARE effected, having Biden over Trump makes a massive difference.
For better or for worse, Trump lost too much support to win again. We're stuck with President Biden and Harris now for at least the next four years.
I need to get a Biden one for that reason.
He also passed DACA, which has had tangible benefits for my friends. Biden will protect DACA, Trump wont.
No man. You live in Vegas. It‚Äôs a sure thing right? Go put $1,000 on Biden ‚ÄúSniff your kids‚Äù &amp; Harris ‚Äúlock you up for pot.‚Äù  It‚Äôs a sure thing right? Guaranteed cash. Do it.
Absolutely. The DNC and the Biden campaign can't bring the fire because they don't have any in them.
There is no way Pete is going to primary incumbent Democrats. No chance. If Biden decides  not to run Kamala will, and Pete will work hard to see her elected.

I really am tempted to do full anti-electoralism some days because my change in suffering under Biden vs Trump is marginal - I guess that's sort of a result of my white privilege. When I remember the unique needs of oppressed peoples tho, I just cant morally justify that position
I don't disagree with you that people will suffer regardless, but there will be less suffering under Biden. For example, I have friends who are DACA recipients that live in fear under Trump who are guaranteed to be protected under Biden.
Y‚Äôall know you misspelled Trump?        ‚ÄúAt every turn, Biden has been wrong about the virus, ignoring the scientific evidence and putting left-wing politics before facts.‚Äù -
Counterpoint: the most vulnerable people in our society are going to be more hurt by another 4 years of Trump than 4 years of Biden. I advocate for socialism because I care about the well being of others, and Im willing to compromise my idealism for their sake.
That's not Joe Biden
Yep. He's making a gamble that Biden supporters will stay home, at the expense of the groups you mentioned *and* the health of his own supporters. He'd let all of them die in a heartbeat if it meant he didn't lose.
It was wrong in the case of Cruz, and it's wrong in the case of Harris.   American politics is sick and morally bankrupt.   Trump, Biden, Harris, Pence,     - all aren't worthy of representing the American people.
Joe Biden is going to lose no matter what
How can you say that? You are hearing the words that were spoken from VP Biden‚Äôs mouth. These are his words.

Maxine Waters Defends Crime Bill And Mass Incarceration Mistakes By Biden And Kamala: Will Never Happen Again
Making the perfect the enemy of the good never gets anyone anywhere, and it won't get Dems anywhere in 2020, so it doesn't make sense to throw the baby out with the bathwater if you don't think Biden/Harris is the perfect super duo for w.e. vision of Left politics you have.
Productively holding Joe Biden and Kamala Harris accountable has it‚Äôs due space - but playing a black and white game of partisan division is getting people killed and exactly what the GOP wants. Grow up.
Obama-Biden administration gave too much power to Iran.   Enemy of my enemy made UAE &amp; Israel friends.
How can Biden make eating facial masks a federal crime or regulation.  Can the Feds demand it?   Are there federal laws on safety?
You guys are so pathetic. You've got the worst people in the world in the White house and Congress and this is the best  you can come up with. I'm glad you are supporting the Biden/Harris ticket.

Creepy, sleepy Joe would resign for "health reasons" if they took Whitehouse. The Biden/Harris ticket is not going to win, the Dems know it. Both Biden &amp; Harris are just being given fake fealty as a show of thanks. All insiders know the Dems are going to lose.
The Obama to Biden districts were a problem and Amy won TRUMP districts.  And probably AA turnout as well.  Both contributed.  But if they weren't going to turn out in 20, WOW.
I'm told they are the most pragmatic voting block ever.  I'm told Trump is an existential threat to them.  You telling me, they weren't going to show?  Even tho they did big for Biden in the primaries? Those narratives are apparently BS.

Lets do this. #BidenHarris
And I won't be voting for Joe Biden. He's much too much of a conservative and Republican for me. The same goes for Harris.  But keep trying to pretend that this is the most radical far-left ticket in the history of our country because Twitler told you to.

A lot of Biden voters were more enthusiastic about voting against Trump then they were FOR Biden. This seems to be cementing Biden support (or Dem ticket support) amongst that group of voters
I'm afraid to show my support for Biden. TRIED to go camping 2 weeks ago. My in laws got into a HUGE debate. Dont mix alcohol and politics.

I make no secret of my disdain for the DNC. They're paid to ignore us and market to us without actually solving anything. Biden isn't even on my list of grudge candidates (let alone one I'd be happy with). But I intend to use every tool at my disposal to save folks I care about.

Spokane is slight red but trending well.  70% of votes are there.  And I'm confident they'll vote Biden. Rural is very red. BUT, riots and Dem silence on it are absolutely killing Ds here.  Just can't understate it and I hope the primary numbers wake them up cause ppl didn't buy

That's all 45* is capable of. He drones on and on reading badly from what someone wrote for him and he can't tell the truth if his life depended on it. I find Biden/Harris such a breath of fresh air with truth, hope and plans for the future.
The doctor is right and so are you! But if Biden wins by dumb luck all this will magically  disappear or subside  super fast. This is a political  game at public expense.
Inside the grueling VP search that led Biden to Harris
U vote for what is there now.  ND biden is the clear choice.  But Im 100% positive this loses other votes.  Just a matter of how many proggressives are now "energized".  FFS I'm willing to vote for an old, gaffe prone guy who doesn't match me politically with a race baiting...
I‚Äôm sure Joe Biden is shivering in his boots because Dilbert is pissed at him.
What bugs me is that it bugs suupporters to acknowledge reality on both sides on this. Its all politics.  Facts do not matter to one side more than the other.I vote Biden cause he's better than Trump.  Thats it.  But I won't deny the reality that the dude ain't sharp as should be
Just honestly ppl, Biden has lost a step which is to be expected for an old man.  Always been a gaffe machine but its worse now.  I dont hate him for natural shit.  But lets not be delusional about it.
Joe biden's memory
I'm curious about your position that The Revolutionary Communist Party has endorsed Joe Biden. This was prior to his VP pick. If you are supportive of that, then bye bye to your trust fund and material positions &amp; private life.
Clinton won Minnesota by 1.5%, and I don't see much evidence that Biden would be that close to Clinton's margin. My guess is the truth is more like Biden +6/7 than either +2 or +12.
Ridin' with Biden, rather
Tomorrow they're gonna turn around and pull the "By not Ridin' for Biden, it's almost like you want him to kill LGBT community" card

I disagree, because I think the federal deficit is already $2.7T, in large thanks to Trump‚Äôs administration‚Äôs spending. Democrats like Biden and Harris are working to make sure every American can financially survive the pandemic.

The narrative on the right, and basically accepted by many mods, is that Biden is losing it.  They like him well enuf under the circumstances but many doubt he makes it thru 4 years
You understand that your vote means nothing to them right? Even if there are enough lefty never Biden folks to throw it to Trump, they‚Äôre totally ok with that.   Trump = easy fundraising &amp; an easy foil to blame all the craven stuff they want to do anyway. We have 0 leverage

Not a waist. Look at the candidate that fits you and represents what you want in a leader. Not a waist!   Its a waist when you blindly pick a candidate and you did no research. I hate the "anything is better than what we have" argument." I equally hate the "Biden is Evil".
Bernie should have been the DNC nomination all together. But we already know they rigged the election to give Hilary the nomination, why wouldn't they do that again for Biden?
I knew and trusted Joe Biden to make the best choice for the Nation and he did.

The moments before Biden choosing Harris were tense and full of humor
Analysis: What Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris says about him
Straight set up. There is no way, in any sane person‚Äôs mind, that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the best option to not only lead our country but to defeat Trump in an election. No fucking way.  Prison population will increase &amp; be the new form of slavery under that admin, watch
Biden...Harris...One thing I can agree with is it‚Äôs better than the alternative, and if I could vote I‚Äôd wake myself up to go to the voting booth, get it over with, use some sanitizer, then wipe the tears from eyes.
I believe Harris puts the Senate in play for Rs.  I believe she is that unpopular with mods.  They are cool with Biden.  Harris is too far.
Its similar to a Trump Cruz ticket.  This isnt typical make up after a nasty primary shit.  Deeply personal.  This is the first time I've felt like Biden wasnt completely in control of the campaign.  I mean damn, she said that about you and knows better!
Hard same. Warren is the only candidate on Biden's VP list I have *any* respect for, and she's got her own truckload of problematic baggage.   Kinda makes me wish there was a way to kick everybody over 50 out of politics -.-'
The benghazi shit wouldn't play with the mods; only rally Trumps base.  I can say this very confidently:  Eastern WA mods can't stand her.  At. All.  The biden debate thing sealed the deal.  There's so much shit on her.  Only EW wouldve been worse and the VP matters this year
It really is like Trump picking Cruz for Veep.  I really thought Biden was stronger than that.  Honest to goodness wow.
Hot take:  Amy will never be POTUS.  She'll take a cabinet post and get wrapped up in some impossible BS controversy.  Biden had the opportunity to pick the most qualified AND electable and chose to appease the progressive woke crowd.  He is not who I thought he could be.
Thank you Vice President Biden for choosing President Harris. I think President Obama will agree with his Vice President.

I respect your views, and I think Harris is not a leftist. She's a moderate liberal and more centrist. Both Biden and Harris (and liberals in general) are pro-capitalism, arguably with more protections for workers and the unemployed than conservatives.

Without cause is tough. But I gotta go with this ticket vs Trump. Biden‚Äôs history is set, he can‚Äôt change the past but he can change the future. Harris is the same but she‚Äôs in her 50‚Äôs so she has a lot of life left &amp; can school Joe on how to fix a system they help perpetuate.
Amy was the most obvious choice there has ever been. Ive never had a strong opinion on VP ever!  Didn't care.  Matters this year. And Biden cut the field to like an 8th of Americans to satisfy the wokes.  And ppl saw that.  Wasnt about best person.  Was about pandering
Hurt.  Guaranteed.  Screencast the numbers now and watch totals in Nov.  Biden still wins but apparently Dems are determined to mKe it interesting

I echo the sentiments that Biden and Harris aren't my ideal candidates, but I'm still voting for them. We'll at least have a shot at being listened to as we raise our voices. We're not getting that with Trump. We try to raise our voices and he responds like a manipulative spouse.
Woo Hoo!  Biden picked Kamala Harris‚ÄîI was sooo hoping for this!!!  Yay!
Medicare 4 All but her ruthless takedown of Biden on bussing, basically calling him a racist on national TV and many, many other statements which will come to light.  They feel like they are voting her POTUS.And she would never be ahead this much over Trump. Amy was clear choice.
Gotta say, Dems are tone deaf. Still gonna vote that way, but damn... in a time of the largest movement against how the police operate in the U.S. and we get Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Still voting for them.... RIP my soul.
I'm voting Biden.  But this is a net negative to the ticket no doubt.  None.
There are shit tons of not never Trumper moderate Rs who are inclined to vote Biden under the circumstances.  I meet with them every single day. And this will be a net negative for them cause they think a vote for him is a vote for her as next POTUS. May still vote Biden, may not
Lol, what of Biden called Mayor Peat out just to lower expectations just enough to get people excited
I'm riding with Biden under the circumstances but I'm very disappointed.  And I know how mods feel about her.  It will sway some cause they view her as the next POTUS.  Lead is big enuf he can get away with it.
I'm a mid 30's white cishet man. I'm the last one who should be spouting opinions, so I'll keep it short.  I'm not thrilled with Kamala. I'm still voting for Biden because not Trump. Neither choice is good, one is less bad. I'll take 4 years of no action over 4 years of decline.
Yeah not sure why u dumb over an opinion that has relevance. Biden a weirdo and Kamala got a past. I'm sure my vote will go that way still but there are questions I need to hear answered or I won't vote at all.

The VP position has turned into more of a symbolic position used to regain voters the presidential candidate lost. She's only picked to help Biden win. Trump picked Pence to help him gain that Christian vote. He fooled many. Hopefully Biden will tap into his VPs skills.
I disagree. She's evolved. People do. She has name recognition and broad appeal. Most of the Twitter polls had her way ahead. I think it's a strong ticket. Marijuana is legal now in many states, it's not demonized as it once was. It's a non-issue. Biden said he'd leave it alone.
Yes, it's definitely Joe Biden's fault you're voting for a dumb criminal bigot.  We totally expected you to not do that.

Biden &amp; Harris have put a lot of blacks in prison, &amp; she is married to a white man. But she still is black &amp; now they ( Biden &amp; Harris) have a chance to fix a lot of the problems wrong with our justice system. They know because they did a lot of of it.

Picking a cop to be your running-mate in 2020 has got to be the greatest example that Biden is senile which I have ever seen
Most of the Twitter polls were heavily in her favor. Biden listened, and did the right thing to help him win.

Tactically, if they want to maximize impact and reverse Trump policies they should hire a lawyer not a politician. But, umm... they might just be down to maintain most of the status quo but put a softer face on it. Not like Biden's time at VP was a heyday of conservation.

Biden can win this election by appealing to Progressives &amp; sure up his support within Black &amp; Brown communities which are the base of the Democratic Party. He doen‚Äôt need to appeal to Republicans. If they‚Äôre as ashamed of Trump as they say, they would do they right thing anyway.

This is depressing! Vote for Joe Biden! Pass the word! Get out the vote! Vote out that orange lardass Trump! Trump is a Russian traitor!
And besides we basically hot an inanimate object in Biden so I would hope we got a VP pick who could at least prop him up once in a while to do something useful.
So then you do give a fuck. Well so do most people and for some of them the vp pick is going to be a factor into Biden earning their votes. We can't just vote Trump out and go back to the same conditions that led to his election. Also Biden could straight up die so important.
This thing is won with big D turnout (which will happen either way) and flipping burbs.  She'll seal the deal.  When I talk to Rs they acknowledge that but say Biden won't pick her.  Might even be deflating for them.  Its so freaking obvious she is the choice

To be clear I'm riding with Biden under the circumstances despite all those who claim I'm faking it or aomething.  Whovever he picks Im in. But Im telling you, others won't do the same.
Biden IS NOT going to pick the lady who basically called him a racist on national TV.  Not. Gonna. Happen.  He is old and less pragmatic and can't stomach the possibility of working with such a devious person for 4 years.  He doesn't trust her.  He and BO trusted each other

Don't worry, they love Biden and his son. Lol
What I think would be the smartest move (though he won't do it and it would be maaaaaybe somewhat risky) would be for Biden to work towards finding the most moderate Republican he can, or a Republican who has just been a thorn to Trump, to try and snag the moderates.
I hope it stays that way.  As you know I have my doubts.  If Biden is able to make some progress, I think it holds off the growing D Soc wing a while longer

Sanders has said multiple times that he wants to use a public option as a transition to single payer (which is all i want from Biden and Yang) because it‚Äôs not realistic to eliminate that many private jobs with no transition. however the taxes should be mandatory.
Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to keep Biden hidden...
Stop looking at it as Biden v. Trump and look at the rest of it. The Supreme Court, the Senate, Congress, executive orders, USPS, SS and on and on. I didn't want Biden either, but I'll be Goddammed if I play any role in Trump getting another term.

Yet the Biden ‚Äúrallies‚Äù get covered in full and live. You‚Äôre not smart are you?
Vote Green Party! Our state will vote for Biden regardless and all the politicians in the coming years must adopt Green Party legislation to save the planet.
I mean: make a case for Biden because he is stomping his feet like a spoiled toddler when it comes to supporting policy that would actually help people and get him votes. If you want to defeat Trump improve Biden because he is shit right now
Vote for Biden anyway. People's lives are at stake.
Most candidates run to the center in the general election. Biden is moving left.  via
Great ad- w/a few edits Biden could use it effectively. I‚Äôm unsure how I feel about that play-on-JFK quote at the end. We‚Äôre in battle with a ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs in it for me‚Äù culture personified by Trump and the GOP, it‚Äôs how we got here. Not sure I buy into implicitly endorsing the idea.
Trump is just so threatened by Biden/Harris!  It‚Äôs called insecure üòü!
BWAH HAHA HAAA! Unscientific?? Mr. Bleach Man who said it would disappear by Easter?!?! Trump calls Biden's coronavirus plan unscientific, rejects call for U.S. mask mandate
When Trump was faced with a decision he didnt follow the science, he followed miracle cures offered on Fox. Biden Will Follow The Best Scientific Advice. Not some witch doctor who thinks demon seed is a thing.
Vote for Biden. Trump is destroying the whole world.

like Biden‚Äôs policies will kill people too obviously but LESS THAN WITH TRUMP and a 3rd party candidate can‚Äôt win, EVEN BERNIE IS SAYING TO VOTE FOR BIDEN
we‚Äôre literally gonna be stuck with either trump or biden so may as well pick the one that‚Äôs not a fascist and who doesn‚Äôt think corona is a hoax ? Lmfaooo
Lmao people attacking ‚Äòvote blue no matter who‚Äô as though it‚Äôs a general rule that we all are gonna keep saying in every election forever &amp; as though we actually like biden like nahh it‚Äôs literally just for this election üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I think Joe Biden is gonna be a fine president what y‚Äôall talking about ????
There‚Äôs three ways post-Biden election plays out: 1) Kamala as Pres (neoliberal reign for 4-8 more years) 2) an actual honest-to-god socialist President (the best scenario) 3) an evil Republican far scarier than Donald J Trump
Biden isn't too far off of that. He and his cop will pursue anarchists with more fervor than the baffoon Trump will. You need to start working on turning Biden into a passable candidate. Quit vote shaming. Nobody owes a vote to anybody else.
if joe biden becomes president it‚Äôs boutta be woodrow wilson pt 2
Life is feeling very chaotic atm. Did 2 things: Donated to Biden/Harris Reached out to schedule an appt with mental health counselor. #MentalHealthMatters #dontletthedarknesswinagain
Look how many voters the democrats are swaying with moderate Joe Biden!
Kamala could beat you without Biden. Mind dwarf.
I think for a lot of people that the idea that "they think things will change this time" is wrong. I think people are looking for a greater sense of stability right now. They have minimum expectations of Biden, but assume they might survive him.
Like Biden did yesterday you mean?
Thank you, Julia! This and the Supreme Court appointments should silence ANY ridiculous purity B.S. from progressive complainers turning their backs on Biden/Harris. This is why it is imperative that we bring back Civics 101 beginning in grade school.
BIDEN IS LITERALLY A FUCKING REPUBLICAN.
And now: *Harris a cop *Biden is a racist, dementia-riddled rapist *Trump is a racist, dementia-riddled rapist *Pence needs to be electrocuted *Execute everyone in Epstein's book *Execute Breonna Taylor's murderers *criminalize racist judges *criminalize willful misinformation
You represent hope for a return to ethical government. You and Joe Biden wiill repair our world leadership. I am not religious, but I pray to God that you will prevail.
A vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for the party of Bloomberg and Kasich, Steve Schmidt and Rick Wilson.   If you‚Äôre a lefty and you‚Äôre response to this starts with ‚Äúbut Trump‚Äù you fail to see what brought us Trump in the first place.
I can‚Äôt see anything Biden does or can do to change my mind... Trump 2020
Say what you want about Biden, but he said nothing will fundamentally changed and he delivered üò§
Interesting you put the impetus on the voter and not on the candidate. Weird logic. Maybe tell Biden to adopt things that 80% of voters want
Does Biden try to delegitimize scientists? Does he deny climate change? Would he actively try to dismantle environmental regulations? Does he openly stoke the fires of white supremacy? Would he ignore medical professionals in the middle of a pandemic?
Pretty dumb move. Biden has only ignored us and actually sought to not include what we, the majority of voters, are asking for. Go get your boy and tell him to stop trying to lose.
I meant if it's stated as tit for tat, it give legs to their Hunter Biden memes. (But I acknowledge those PR rules as to what gives a story legs are all shot the pieces now). So, hold each Trump/Kushner accountable for their own feeding at the public trough!  Yes.

Actually no. Hillary was ahead 3 points. Biden is ahead 12 points. Even Trump's polling has him behind 11 points

Thank you, Joe Biden, for choosing Kamala Harris as your running mate.  Now we have a fighting, winning team.  Let us all fight together to save our people and to save our democracy.  To borrow a Revolutionary War slogan:  everyone HOLD FAST!
I am excited that Joe Biden chose you as his running mate.  I know that you and Biden will fight for our people, our democracy and our Constitution.  I will fight with you.
If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America
Rescued again by Joe Biden!
Fabulous!!                           Harris just showed why Biden chose her
Not all Biden supporters are warmongers and racists.   But they all decided warmongering and racism weren‚Äôt deal breakers for them.
Theres nothing to be proud of. You‚Äôre too cowardly to make a hard but necessary choice, thats all this is. Biden sucks but Trump is exponentially worse, we cannot risk 4 more years of this shit
You can call it vote bullying if you like. The point still stands. Its a wasted vote, and attitudes like this are whats going to land us with 4 more years of Trump. Biden sucks, but its pretty asinine to pretend he is anywhere near as bad as trump
Jesus do your research or get a new job. Her view on health care has evolved and she is now 200% behind Biden‚Äôs plan to expand Obamacare NOT  go with Medicare for all got that?  -I did your job for you now speak the truth !!!
"It was a party that claimed to adhere to the Constitution and the rule of law. No Republican leader today abides by these tenets."
i know he sucks but please for the love of everything vote for biden, i dont want another 4 years of this carrot lookin ass toddler‚Äôs bullshit
Seriously who cares at this point. Trump is raging against the dying of the empire, Biden is useless nostalgia for better times while we‚Äôre collectively euthanized. Any change will come from outside the democrats
waiting for the day biden slips up and calls kamala harris barack
I just followed you, now we're just waiting for the screw-ups, ahem, controversies, that are bound to happen with the Biden-Harris ticket.
The context of that edit of WAP to have Biden and Kamala in the video given the touching in the video (not weird on its own) and Biden‚Äôs actual behavior towards women (deeply weird) is Not Good Folks. Liberals are brain diseased for sure
Vote for Biden instead of Chuck Schumer?
So I'm streaming it now and let Biden speak just to hear what is different, and just found it hilarious he has to go back 3 years to Charlottesville to talk about racism. Motherfucker we in the streets today for the same shit
The left-wing is going to need to apply constant pressure to a Biden-Harris presidency (protests, organizing, local level elections, etc). Biden-Harris will not want to move left but we have to force them to do so.
Send proof of Biden being compassionate. Like acting in a compassionate way.
I didn't want to vote for Hillary and the electoral college makes my vote (Blue state) essentially null. I'm voting this year for Biden/Harris to make a statement to Republicans that they need to do better and to make sure Trump doesn't contest the election.

ma‚Äôam we all realize that it sucks but we literally have no choice right now ?? we either get trump or biden and trump is the one leading america towards being a fascist regime
went into an anxious &amp; dissociative episode at the grocery store yesterday after Biden‚Äôs announcement this moment in time is pure misery
You must have memory holed the Obama years completely because republicans gained so much ground between intentional compromises and taking everything back  the midterms. Meanwhile Biden says he‚Äôs gonna compromise again

What good would voting for Biden do, versus watching the DNC finally burn? What message is more important? Trump can't do much without congress. If we elect Biden, they will screw us over again in 2024, at least til 2028, and then how many will die in wars and bs in the meantime?

No. Not voting for Trump. I'm not voting for Biden. You didn't read my comment.
Trump asked to respond to the Biden/Harris Ticket.
Is this a pro-Biden account? I'm not voting for Trump, but I have yet to see you call Biden out on any of his BS.
Joe Biden is racist. He wrote the crime bill. Until he made these recent concessions. I don't trust him. I'm NOT voting for Trump. Also, I'm not sure it's worth continuing to enable the DNC and all of their BS while they continue to play us.
The way I see it is we only have two real options currently and it‚Äôs either Biden and her or trump and who the fuck is going to pick trump
She‚Äôs super problematic and I don‚Äôt know what the Biden people and the DNC knows that we don‚Äôt about why they think she‚Äôll help the ticket...? Maybe Tulsi was living on island time and missed the Zoom call...
It‚Äôs gonna be just like 2016 I think - liberals going in insanely sure and overconfident and then incredulous when tons of people stay home out of disillusionment, combined with the types of voter suppression they helped normalize during the primary. Idk anyone excited for Biden
if trump wins again he could very well end up turning america into a dictatorship and finding a way to stay in control even after 2024 and that‚Äôs absolutely terrifying, at least with biden we know we‚Äôd only have to deal with him for 4 years
Biden is a Jack Kennedy kind of Catholic- he is loyal to America
WHEN TRUMP GETS ELECTED AGAIN I DONT WANT TO SEE A SINGLE FUCKING PERSON WHO CHOOSES TO NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN COMPLAINING IT WILL BE Y‚ÄôALLS FAULT
lmfao we‚Äôre so screwed nobody is even realizing that we just NEED TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE YES BIDEN SUCKS TOO BUT HE‚ÄôS THE LESSER OF THE TWO EVILS OMFG
so has the whole of twitter basically just decided they‚Äôd rather have trump &amp; pence than biden &amp; kamala ..?
yes kamala harris is a terrible person &amp; we can acknowledge that while also understanding that voting for her &amp; biden is the only way to get Trump out of office üò≠üò≠
Kamala inherited Hillary‚Äôs foreign policy advisor Michelle Flournoy, who was going to be her defense secretary and will likely now be Biden‚Äôs  She founded Center for a New American Security which is full of Bush-era warmongers and funded by weapons manufacturers and oil companies
Why are you tryna get your constituents to vote for Biden tho?? I thought racism was your platform?
This election is seriouslyyyy not the election to do it. I really can‚Äôt risk trump winning again, the platform he‚Äôs given hate is just toooo much. Biden fucking sucks too but we need better ppl in the cabinet ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è plus idk if boycott would ever work, we need an outright revolution

Who knows if she‚Äôs even voting for them. She hasn‚Äôt said a single thing about Biden since she dropped out

Pls don't wipe your ass with your vote by voting 3rd party because you don't like Trump OR Biden
I will begrudgingly vote for Biden but knowing that it won‚Äôt actually allow for change, not real change, just away from Trump and back to status quo is incredibly infuriating. And I‚Äôm white. I can‚Äôt even imagine how it is for people of color.
I‚Äôve seen so many black activists this evening talking about not voting because Biden/Harris are complicit in racism but also knowing in order to properly apply pressure through protests for actual change we need to vote in democrats. This is such a shitty situation.
My true motivation for this upcoming election is who won‚Äôt ensure climate catastrophe. I think it‚Äôs obvious who doesn‚Äôt care about science. So basically Biden/Harris not being hellbent to fuck the earth will get my vote but I‚Äôm no fanboy or even happy about it.

Excellent choice, soon-to-be President Biden!
Imagine waking up in the first day of the Biden/Harris presidency. Its going to feel like bathing for the first time in 4 years. No vile, racist, Russian assets in the white house, all the human cockroaches scurrying back into the shadows after their horribleness has no home.

Biden better give you a Medal of Honor for your tweets getting us all through the past four years of this bullshit üòÇüôå
it‚Äôs hilarious how hard copmala went on biden just to be his running mate hahahahahahah identity politics are the wurst
Biden swore to a black female VP, and  couldn't provide the paperwork showing she is black. So she was never a real candidate for VP.
Joe Biden has picked a strong women as a running mate. Rumors abound Trump is looking for a new running mate. Mike Pence is trying a new look.
She was AG in 2016, man. I don't even want to argue about this but I'm really not sure where you're getting these points from. Biden doesn't support defund the police. It's pretty amazing to think 2 conservative dems are going to defund the police.
Kamala Harris will be the first Black woman nominated for vice president by a major party  via    Im very excited to support Biden and Harris!
Kamala Harris insinuated that Biden was racist on national television and he made her his running mate LMFAO
Agreed but I definitely feel confident with this lineup. If anything, they will capture the moderate vote while the popularity of Sanders and Warren among progressives will nudge Biden and Harris farther to the left.
With Biden being really old and covid going around, VP is way more important. Warren's wheelhouse is monetary policy. State dept is not where she would probably choose to be.
I can respect that I just would have preferred less cop worship. Biden already was talking about giving cops more money federally and this all feels on point for things going in the wrong direction.

Yup. My main concern is if Biden wins, Kamala will likely be the nominee in 2024
Kamala Harris, the junior senator from California, has been picked as Joe Biden's running mate. Harris will be the third woman nominated as vice president on a major party ticket.
Glad Biden picked Kamala Harris, those California Electoral votes are critical.
I called Biden picking Kamala back after Bernie dropped out. Not shocked at all
What‚Äôs worse, trumps negligence killing thousands of Americans or Obama/Biden‚Äôs competence in killing millions around the world?
Yes, it goes without saying, but I‚Äôm fully on board with Biden/Harris 2020! Mostly because of Kamala Harris! When will there be merch?

Biden/Tawky Tawny 2020!
Alright. I'm officially ready to be disappointed by Biden's VP pick.
He's got a number of paths forward. If he debates Biden face to face it's over.
I wouldn't say it's "in the bag" however he has a better chance than the left is giving him credit for. He's got a number of accomplishments under his belt and Biden clearly has signs of mental decline.
first of all i can complain about establishment dems all the fuck i want and second of all biden promised a black woman/poc as his vp and if he doesnt deliver its just another example of politicians lying to get what they want
I‚Äôve suggested this before, let me ask it as a question ‚Äî  Why hasn‚Äôt Biden considered one or more INDIGENOUS women as his VP ‚Äúpick‚Äù (to the best of available evidence)? #Biden #Biden2020 #BidenVP
Yang stopped being relevant the moment he bent the knee for Biden and took the gig on CNN. He'll get exactly what Warren got for selling out, nothing.
Ranks right up there with the idea that "the voters" picked Joe Biden.
Georgia Poll:  Biden 46% (+2) Trump 44%
Meeting with Joe Biden. What's the mystery?
I know this election isn‚Äôt life or death for you, self described lawyer/writer/mom. You‚Äôre working from home or raising your kids. I‚Äôm among the 30 million unemployed who don‚Äôt have healthcare and see a demagogue in Trump and then Biden saying ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù
This idea that the only people who are not excited or unenthusiastic w Biden being privileged is super ridiculous. The people who‚Äôve been most angry w Trump has been wealthy educated liberals. Most of every demographic under 50 didn‚Äôt vote for Biden among democrats
I‚Äôm not voting for him, but if I was choosing between Biden and Trump, foreign policy comes first.
Not at all. And it sucks I wish I could find a single reason to get excited about Joe Biden the kids in cages + mass deportations started under Obama/Biden, why would they end when he‚Äôs back? I‚Äôm still not gonna have healthcare. I believe the path forward is not at the ballot box
2016 did matter, and I voted for Hilary. America is in terminal decline, Trump is in denial about it, Joe Biden wants us all to pretend it‚Äôs 2010 again while it burns. The election matters, im just altogether checked out, not because im privileged but bc i don‚Äôt have delusions
Like Biden did in the 90s?
And Biden supposedly is the one with cognitive issues?
One thing I want to be really clear about ahead of time is that while I may or may not lambaste Biden for picking a less-than-progressive choice who thus does not meet the demands of the moment, I will not be criticizing any of the women for having been chosen.
And his kid has issues with Biden being out of it.
But seriously, keep pushing the biden narrative. It‚Äôs actually v helpful for us sweetie ;) Thanks for looking at my profile, I‚Äôm flattered!!
Must appreciate Trump signing the First Step Act in contrast to Biden‚Äôs crime bill.
I won‚Äôt be voting for Biden then, as he is compromised by donors
Ok best of luck to you and those who support Biden. I hope he loses, but if he wins I will not deny the legitimacy of his win, I won‚Äôt make up a fake claim that he was a Russian agent and try to get him impeached over bullshit, and I won‚Äôt #resist like a fucking spoilt child.
Honest to God, if the governors race in 2024 was Jenny Durkan vs Tim Sheldon, I would probably abstain. There is also a 100% chance I'm voting for Biden in November.
Depressingly on point
Damn when the NYT has to acknowledge reality to push back on antifa, you know the polling for Biden must be starting to deteriorate due to the chaos caused by the Dems armed wing....
‚ÄúThere will probably be books written on what that says about Americans and gender in U.S. politics, but there just isn't the same disdain for Biden that there was for Clinton.‚Äù

We need everyone to vote for Biden in states like Florida, Texas, Arizona,etc.  Trump HAS to be removed. By not voting for Biden, you're saying trump is doing fine--he's acceptable.  I want better than Biden too. I'm willing to start w/Biden &amp; then get the best person in 4 years.
I didn't say you weren't voting.  I live in the beautiful state of Washington where I'm surrounded by intelligent people.  I'm not concerned about Washington picking Biden.  Florida on the other hand is a zoo--more karen's per square mile than any other state.  Please vote Biden
Right now trump HAS to be removed.  We'll start with Biden &amp; get a better person in the white house in the future.  If you dont vote for Biden you're basically saying trump in office is acceptable.  You're saying this dangerous full of hate monster sack of shit is good enough.
When I see these Biden videos all I can think of is  !
He keeps giving it sugar boosters which do nothing for long term growth and will hurt us when Biden becomes President in January.

Due to Trump's utter incompetence, Joe Biden will inherit a devastated economy that Republicans will openly try to sabotage and undermine for political gain. Taking glory in the failure of the dream of what was America the brave.
I don‚Äôt think Joe Biden needs any help from the Russians.
What if Biden nominated Ivana Trump as his VP?   (not ivanKa, the first wife, Ivana)
He may have said that publicly but he didn't even know he had to contact the Commission for Presidential Debates at first. Trump thought requests were sent to him. He made a fool of himself saying Biden wouldn't debate him when the commission was waiting for a response from him.
Nice way to try to curcumferentially marginalize Kanye while overtly criticizing Trump. All this while wearing blinders to Biden‚Äôs mentation deficiencies.
Yeah, it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúBiden Syndrome.‚Äù
Biden is a Bernie surrogate.
I think it would kill him because those executives are major donors to his campaign and I think some even have high up positions within it. Biden wants to give the reibs back to Larry fucking Summers and Bloomberg, after all

Biden gave me another reason to NOT vote for him. Thanks Joe!
I keep going back and forth on my guess for Biden's pick. Right now I'm thinking Gretchen Whitmer, just because she's the one option who is neither progressive nor a woman of color. It fits Biden's MO to pick the only person sure to upset literally everyone he needs to appeal to.
And people are STILL wondering if they should vote for Biden. My God.

Joe Biden has sent three requests, yes three requests, to the Commision on Presidential Debates to debate Trump. Trump has not responded, he's sent zero requests to them. So why is Trump scared?

You want to investigate Biden fine let‚Äôs investigate Ivanka &amp; Jared they make millions from several countries. So what Biden made $50,000 a mo. from Ukraine he did nothing wrong what are the Trump children doing. Check one check all.  They are just as wrong

If they look real to you, then I implore you to look for yourself and see how hypocritically it is for an Indian Jamaican woman who's ancestors were slave owner's, who called Biden a racist and rapist just months ago, accept being a running mate as the 1st African American woman
But covering it fairly or misrepresenting facts and twisting it to look as though trump is bad and it was all Biden's doing, I'll never trust the msm ever again
Such lies and deceit. You'd rather go backwards with fake Biden and even more fake Harris
Ummm socialism and government regulations are left, capitalism and not interfering is right. So Medicare for all is left, Biden said that's much government involvement, where does that put Biden? ü§∑
Then you're voting for a fraud, who is Indian and Jamaican, not African American, called Biden out for his racism not long ago, and literally had ancestors who owned slaves to which there are records proving it. Way to set us all back.

Joe Biden is literally Donald Trump just a few stages deeper into dementia and instead of being on the apprentice and owning casinos he just was openly racist and sexist for 40 years.

News break for ya skippy but Harris is his running mate, she is more corrupt then Biden, if Biden wins the election I can assure ya she will push for the 25th Amend to have him removed from Office on the grounds he has Dementia, not clearly fit to be President
I don't think even he knows he picked her, I think it was Jill Biden who picked her not Joe.
Patriots, seeing Harris has been tapped to be Biden's running mate we all really need to get down and pray plus get our asses out to vote for Trump. Biden/Harris can not be elected or America will be no more.
Oh shit you got us, guess we will vote for Biden now, not like those pics are photoshopped, taken out of context, and literally shows a father spending time with his daughter. You're delusional.
As crooked as she is, she got a way to become the President, if Biden wins, without any votes. All she has to do is invoke the 25th Amend. against Biden which she will succeed and then becomes the first Minority Female President without even an Election.
I said it in another tweet, if Biden wins, and I am sure we won't let that happen, she's going to push for the 25th Amen. in order to be President without being elected, she ran for the office and failed. This will be her chance to get in the office. Remember her threat.
People wake up, seeing Harris is now have been nominated as the VP for Biden and what she has said concerning us AS WELL as Biden, if Biden wins she will push for the enactment of the 25th A against Biden thus forcing him out of office to make her President w/o being elected.

Everyone pretty much knows Biden (age 77 now, 78 upon inauguration) will be a one-termer and will be the wedge for his VP to become the 47th president.  That's why he needs to think long and hard about who it's going to be.
I'm fairly certain that all the voters who would be influenced by a bully mocking a disabled reporter, for instance, are so firmly in the Trump camp it would be impossible to pry them out by the sight of Biden one-upping him with his own monkey show. We're going for independents.

Susan Rice Sells Netflix Shares as Biden VP Pick Speculation Heats Up  via
The greatest Biden virtue is his honestly and authenticity plus he has charisma
He wants Biden to win to stop the investigations. Period.
No signs with Biden but wait till he picks a running mate, that will be the true test.
Anyone who votes for Biden without the opportunity to view a debate is basing their vote totally on imagination, what you imagine he is, rather than who he really is. Losers Fred Fleitz: If Biden skips debates with Trump here's how our enemies will read it
Watching President Trump and Biden go at it, is going to be a lot like Billy Madison's speech about the puppy.I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd piss people off with what I‚Äôm about to say, if I had a Twitter following:  Fuck Donald Trump. Fuck Joe Biden. Fuck Pence and his homophobia. Fuck Kamala Harris. Fuck Sean Hannity. Fuck Rush. Fuck Betsy DeVoss. Most of all, fuck all of us. #fuckpolitics
Is she saying she hopes Biden will stay alive until November or she Hopes they can do mail in ballots so they can rig the election
I have decided to stop following the White House and Press Secretary and what ever that thing is  until we get a real President and Vice President in Biden and Harris.  This ass wipe is not going to break the will of the American People!!!
I bet Biden knows how to pronounce our national parks.
Personally I think we‚Äôre looking at just that. There are no good candidates. What Trump has going for him is that he‚Äôs the evil we know.  Biden is a moron and Harris had already shown Shek Day or do anything to further her political aspirations. Everything is scary.
If you really want to get down to the brass tacks as to why Trump is president it's because of the candidate they put up again. Had it been anybody but Hillary Trump would not have won. Blame the DNC for why Trump is in office. And they very likely did it again with Biden.
I will still pay attention but if Biden is president I won't open Twitter every morning scared of what I'm about to read. And that I'm very much looking forward to.
Why does the virus have to be gone by election day in order for Biden to win? I don't follow your logic.
Republicans can no longer debate ideas so they lie about about birth certificates, emails, Biden's health, and now this garbage. Once upon a time we were the party of ideas.
Biden doesn‚Äôt speak out of both sides of his mouth. He is an American patriot. The village idiot lies 24/7 and his kkkult sucks it up. Vote üó≥ blue. End the lies.
Come on, Mr. Biden voted to invade Iraq, I‚Äôm afraid he would be more like Mr. Roosevelt, than Mr. Chamberlain.
It's hilarious how hard Fox and right wing media is trying to paint the most moderate ticket since LBJ as radicals. I mean, you can't get more down the middle moderate than Biden and Harris.
. being his VP selection makes me feel much better about Joe Biden potentially being president. We gotta get Tumps donkey ass out no matter what but I definitely didn‚Äôt want to jump from the frying pan into the fire üî•
So my take on this is that both candidates seek to be President but Trump is relaxing on the train letting others do the work as he coasts along in his comfortable life, while Biden is labouring and doing all the work himself without the glamour and comfort... Trump own goal!

Antifa . com goes straight to Joe Biden's website. What in the....wow.... #Tump2020 #PrayForTheStupid
You know what I‚Äôm worried about now? All of these buttheads who are SO against Biden/Harris that they either don‚Äôt vote or vote for someone else and Tr*mp wins. Again. The same way he did last time. Everyone just needs to fucking suck it up so we can make progress. #BidenHarris
Right up until inauguration day when Biden rattles off some bullshit about ‚Äúhealing the nation‚Äù and ‚Äúcoming together‚Äù and let‚Äôs all of these assholes off the hook, just like the Bush, Reagan and Nixon criminal organizations before them.
Still gonna vote for Biden/Harris but we need to know what she‚Äôs about just as much as Biden.   We cannot allow this to go unknown.   Also I‚Äôm really tired of everyone seeing this and going ‚Äúwell are you gonna vote for Tr*mp then?‚Äù No! Get your head out of your ass.
#HannityForBiden   After letting, even encouraging, Trump to make a total fool of himself in this interview, it's clear that Hannity is now working for Biden. Keep up the good work!
Joe Biden really helped write the 3 strlikes law........... but holding my vote would be ignorant too. What in the entire fuck ü§¶üèæ
That said Biden/Harris is still a better choice than, well, whatever is left of the failed trump administration. Just so tone deaf to have her as vp after months of protests against police brutality and an unfair justice system
You got an inside scoop on Biden getting Epsteined or something?
So now you guys want the debates?? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ If they can debate, then so can Trump and Biden.
They both agree Biden sexually assaulted women
settle for biden settle for biden settle for biden settle for biden settle for biden settle for biden settle for biden settle for biden  any other vote is a vote for trump so please  settle for biden
settle for biden???
So Biden finally announces his VP pick and it's  He absolutely could have done worse. She's certainly going to steer him in the right direction.   Now let's get out the vote and kick the orange idiot out of office! #resist #BlueWave2020 #BlackLivesMatter
The enthusiasm I‚Äôm seeing for Harris is making me smile.  Where do I get my Biden/Harris sign and bumper stickers??
Well, this is true!  Biden/Harris!
Holy Shit. Be Realistic Biden/Harris agruable worst than Trump #NeverBiden #HawkinsWalker2020
Lol  everyone who thinks Biden actually had a choice for his VP
Half white and hate Biden's racist ass and half Asian and hate Kamala's cop ass. Kamala is a historic moment for Asians like Margret Thatcher was a historic moment for women.
...  No matter how nasty Kamala was during the debates and Kavanagh,   Joe Biden forgives her cause her hair smells so good!
What do you think? Will Biden jump another 5 points in the polls?
Same. However, I feel there are many qualified women who are going to hold important leadership roles within the Biden-Harris White House. Excited for the change.
The Biden campaign was all but dead until it went to South Carolina. There, black people propped up his campaign which Y‚Äôall( Republicans) can‚Äôt have it both ways. We didn‚Äôt vote overwhelmingly for Kamala just because she‚Äôs black. Now she‚Äôs VP candidate, we gonna vote for Biden?
3-4 would be fine but will we even have 1? Joe Biden is so far left we will be living in a socialist economy something the founders would definitely not be pleased with.
Moderate???  You spelled "Far Left" wrong. And I wonder if she still thinks Biden is racist??
But you know. Black ain‚Äôt black with Biden.
I know that it seems hard to believe that I have received from him. But with the presidential election going on this year in America. I ended up voting for Joe Biden for president of the United States!
Joe Biden really just picked missblowsalot to be his vp? Lol
This just in joe Biden announces his replacement
So happy Biden chose you. It is time to ROCK the world and kick Trump and his administration to the curb.
I fully expect you to take a role of great responsibility in the Biden cabinet.
Does the Kamala Harris pick sway any voters who weren't already voting for Biden?
We got this, America! Congratulations to Kamala‚Äî Biden and Kamala 2020!
Kamala was the obvious choice 6 months ago, and I‚Äôm glad that Biden didn‚Äôt overthink it.

Dont know what you are talking about.... Portland street people aren;t Biden voters.... they are Black Bloc and Socialists
I think the VP choice is Biden's to make. He has to work with her.
The real important difference? Look at how small Biden's hands and feet are!
Yah? Australia is about to be ran right over by China! And president Biden won't help you out either!
Same kind of promises the USA Dems make to negroes and other minorities ahead of every election. Promisses they always break! Joe Biden already broke a big promise, and he isn't even elected yet. He failed to name his VP last week. Trump has kept EVERY single promise. Trudeau?lol
Biden supporters = racists
If she loves her husband, Jill Biden needs to step in and throw in the towel.
Did Putin OK it?  Sad that you lost your moral compass. Going after Biden with Russian intell.
I‚Äôm sure if Biden gets elected the will be absolutely 0 racist people. None, there were none before Trump so...
It's getting very sad at this point. When will the person who promised to be with him forever (Jill Biden) finally step in and take care of her husband??
Vote Joe Biden to be a racists pedophile..
"BIDEN IS GONNA TAKE OUR GUNS!"  Bitch they said Obama was too!!! Yet here I am, still locked and loaded.   Congress ain't organized enough to vote on anything.
Trump says Biden will "hurt God". Think about that. Trump is saying God is so weak, so vulnerable, that a lone Democrat can defeat him. That's not the God I believe in. How about you?
And you brought along Trump the Heretic. Trump said Biden would "hurt God". Clearly, Trump views God as weak, vulnerable, able to be beaten by a mere mortal. Is that how YOU view God? Do you agree with Trump that God is impotent? Why do you associate with a non-believer?
Trump said Biden would "hurt God". Clearly, Trump thinks God is weak, vulnerable, able to be beaten by a common mortal. Trumps' God is apparently a loser. Trump said so.
Think about it, Obama would most likely have a spot in Biden‚Äôs presidency. If he wanted it. üòÄ
He would probably be a better president than Biden. At least he can say a complete sentence
Biden is RACIST
I know several people who are saying this, having it ready by that day isn‚Äôt to help him win the election, but because this is a hoax and it will go away when Biden wins  ... according to them üòêüòê
Most likely no unless she runs as an independant. The Dem party wouldn't stray from Biden if he's president for 4 years.
To use your quote Biden "Could Stand In the Middle Of Fifth Avenue And Shoot Somebody And he Wouldn't Lose Any Voters" because you are done!  The difference being Biden would never do it. #RepublicansForBiden #RepublicansAgainstTrump #Biden2020
At least Biden listens and apologizes.
"Unlike African Americans, Latinos are diverse". You must be referring to this. But that was actually Biden who is saying all the racist stuff. It's cool, we all make typos sometimes! Just double check the names before you post your tweets next time. üëçü•≥.
We are all native. You either vote for the president who is unashamed of being an outright racist or Biden.
Too bad that's NOT what Biden actually said into the camera. This tweet is just a campaign fixer trying to make Joe not look like the racist he is. #JoeBidenIsARacist
Knowing that Joe Biden is struggling so much cognitively...if you cast an early vote for him BEFORE he debates (without handlers and prompters), you don‚Äôt care about this country AND you are grossly irresponsible. Period.
Honestly I fucking hate Biden but he is most definitely the better option. I just wish that he'd keep his mouth shut because every time he talks he says something stupid
Watching Vice President Biden Eulogizes Senator Byrd
Imagine being so ignorant of who God is that you believe a person could hurt him.
Biden already has a plan. Thank goodness.

What a deranged maniac. Attacking Joe Biden‚Äôs character will be the nail in Trump‚Äôs political coffin.
I don‚Äôt think that comparing Trump to Biden is a fair comparison, any more than it is appropriate to compare Hitler to Margaret Thatcher. One is clearly a demigogue who has‚ÄîLITERALLY‚Äî pried children from their mothers and locked them up in prison camps. And that‚Äôs just 1 example.Yep and their names are Biden/Harris 2020! You done Matty Pants McDrunkface, you done! #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #RepublicansAreDestroyingAmerica #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
But, is it a fair bargain?
I‚Äôm gonna make a strong, good faith effort to ensure this doesn‚Äôt happen, and I hope you will too, but there are somethings we need to discuss in case Biden/Harris loses.
Terrified. Biden could of chosen Miss Piggy and you idiots would be giddy with excitement.
Ha! Don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt be voting for Biden. Great bit of voter outreach there.
Biden/Harris don't WANT to #EarnMyVote.  Period.   I am laser focused on policy and voting records--both are absolutely abysmal on every fundamental level.
Here's a fool who thinks Progressives ruined Hillary Clinton in 2016 and will ruin Joe Biden in 2020.  Wrong. Those politicians failed/will fail based on their own merits.  Face it dude: Biden/Harris should be on the REPUBLICAN ticket!
Biden &amp; Harris will change things üíØ
If Biden manages to when with all of these dirty tactics that  is directing #postmastergeneralDeJoy to take. Can  fire him when he becomes the 46th President? This is #VoterSuppression
Another BS deep state sponsored editorial trying to pass as journalism.
Even though Biden doesn't check all your boxes, his agenda benefits the majority of the people. The main thing is to get Trump out. He's destroying our nation. I'd vote for a rock as long as it got him the hell out of there!!
Such an easy call. Biden is so stupid on this issue.
Sorry hon, this is a reach. Biden is doing exactly nothing to reach out to Latinos and that sure af includes Harris.
So how do you explain that Joe Biden is a practicing Catholic and the VP will be carrying out his vision of the country.  I am Catholic and I do not believe in abortion.  I believe that Joe Biden believes the same as I do.  Trump does not go to church or believe in saving lives.
But the more important point is the overwhelming evidence presented showed that President Trump did it: He wrongfully conditioned military assistance to Ukraine on a commitment to announce an investigation into Joe Biden.
Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Marco Rubio (R- Fla.) were the first out of the block to explain that the president is guilty but shouldn‚Äôt be ousted for it.
Should - Vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Does this need explaining?
Here‚Äôs some stuff we shouldn‚Äôt be doing and some stuff we should do re: the Biden/Harris ticket:
Each sign costs $600,000!?  I assume only Biden and Kamala bought them ü§£
You're running scared, Mr Trump. You're so befuddled by the Biden-Harris ticket, that you're inventing the most absurd lies and rewriting history. Per usual, you are spouting one lie after another, embarrassing yourself and the GOP nearly every time you open your mouth.
This is a set up. In the next week or two Joe Biden will have an health issue or be Hilleried, while this is happening Kamala will be by his side ( acting like the loyal friend). Then the Democrats will bow their heads in remorse and Kamala runs for  President.
Taking a 1 tweet break from posting shit about Biden to bring you something wholesome.

New post (Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate for November presidential election) has been published on Covid-19 News Info -
There's an endless list of things I'd rather do than watch Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak together.  Near the top are: chewing shards of broken glass, performing my own colonoscopy, having long conversations with foreign telemarketers, and licking fresh bat guano.
I really want to believe in Biden/Harris I really do. But
God Biden is a boring speaker
The two party system will never die if people like us who don't support it don't vote it out. In current polls, Jo Jorgensen is only about 4% behind Trump. Biden is losing drastically in most polls. If you're a Bernie supporter, why not vote Jo?
Off you go to the Comrades 4 Biden gulag.
I can't stop shitting on Biden! It just keeps coming OUT OH GOD!!!
BREAKING: Biden determined to stop the spread of Communism in North Vietnam.
When she did that to Biden it sank her campaign.
We have a level of income inequality that makes democracy unsustainable. I am suppose to believe that Biden, Harris, Pelosi and Schumer are going to reverse their lives work, alienate their donors and do that?
This  and  double-stack is the best thing I've seen yet today. Side note/true story: Biden picking Harris won me a burger and fries.
I don‚Äôt get the same feeling now, Biden just doesn‚Äôt inspire loathing the way Clinton did. But I do feel that a lot of people feel they are being ignored and written off. And that can‚Äôt be good
Are you daft? She believes Biden is guilty of the sexual accusations against him yet she is now his running mate.
WAKE UP.  I just totally got that Biden and Harris are a political joke in a bad way. It's all BS smoke and mirrors.  It isn't us against them.  It's us against whoever wants to make us all slaves.  They hate trump because he loves this country and is fighting for OUR freedom.
THIS MAKES ZERO SENSE and sinister.  Why would dems have Biden and Harris?  Because maybe ?! Someone wants this country weak for a takeover??  It's a nagging unease that someone's pulling the wool over constituents eyes to use them for ulterior purposes.  Know what I mean??
I‚Äôm voting for Trump/Pence over the Biden/Harris alternative. And, Tom. . . nobody who supports the party of the abortion death-cult gets to assess the morality of anyone. Ever.
According to the ongoing narrative, Joe Biden (simultaneous evil mastermind and aging dotard) has picked Kamala Harris (at once a cop and anarcho-syndicalist coming to take our guns) to enact their evil plan of turning all of America into Seattle.  Plus, they hate each other. /1
It does make for an interesting narrative wherein Joe Biden (simultaneous evil genius and aging dotard) has selected as his running mate Kamala Harris (simultaneously a cop, and Bernie Sanders who will install a communist anarchic dictatorship).  Oh, and they hate each other.
I mean I really don't see Biden sending out the fucking gestapo to kidnap civilians using their right to protest so
Biden/Harris 2020: Sniff and Blow.
Well, I find this thread very interesting. I completely agree that the people need to continue in mass movements for there to be change. But I find it sadly cynical to attribute no admirable values and virtues to Biden and Harris.
Is getting chosen for VP so unimportant that you get called on the phone and the nomination sent in a text? How special?! Or is it that Biden can't be trusted to talk in person because he's tanking fast?
The news stations are interviewing East Indian women who are crying over their success at having another Indian woman running with Biden ??  A bit confusing.
Why are the news stations having women politicians of East Indian descent weeping with joy over their triumph at having an Indian woman running with Biden?
Great, can hardly wait for Trump to send the next stimulus so I can donate it to Biden/Harris 2020
Problem is...that's the best pitch Joe Biden has right now.
Hey so a lot of folks are saying it‚Äôs tone deaf for Biden to pick California‚Äôs top cop as VP in the light of the BLM movement‚Äôs call to defund... but I actually think it‚Äôs a formal fuck you! The DNC isn‚Äôt blind to the movement - they hate it.
Biden/Harris: Where dead and Red intersect
YES YES YES!! Happy Day! Our country needs to heal from Trump and the Biden/Harris ticket can do that. Joy! üòä
Biden did not pick the best candidate but choose a black female... No racism or sexism there...
Wall Street is celebrating Harris I have not heard Biden or Harris in a wealth tax. Nothing

I'm not a huge fan of either. I will be voting for them, though. Harris is just as establishment as Biden is but i think she will help him with voter turn out.
She whiffed the Kavanough hearings and when she attacked Biden it sunk her campaign so I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äúfighter‚Äù thing is your best play here except for feels.  Also, prison labor

Let's be honest, Biden could have picked a dead Christmas tree for VP and I'd still be voting for him.
Tears of joy!!!!!!  Biden/Harris 2020
Dude, that ‚Äòhiding in the basement‚Äô is so played out. Biden can ride a bicycle, walk and chew gum at the same time, think and speak coherently. Trump cannot drink a glass of water with one hand, walk down a ramp, tie his own shoes, wipe his own butt, nor can he pronounce Yosemite
Solid tweet. Will not be voting for Biden.
Are they going to form a human shield around her to protect her from the sniffing groper Biden?
Well Biden‚Äôs brains are pretty much gone
A vote for Biden is a vote against the fucking gestapo and a vote for Grandma being able to have SSI income. It probably isn't much but it's better than nothing.
When is Biden naming his VP candidate??
The VP choice is going to be the actual POTUS. Biden is in rapid decline, and is incapable of executing the duties of the office.

I think you need proof for that. On the other hand, there is proof that Biden is corrupt.

Meh. Hillary didn‚Äôt lose because of Russia. If Biden loses it won‚Äôt be because of Russia. Am I supposed to be viscerally outraged that China is working against Trump? I‚Äôm not
I am sure the Republicans will be happy to let President Biden do the same?  Right?
i‚Äôm saying that while biden isn‚Äôt in the right, trump most definitely isn‚Äôt either so this isn‚Äôt something to critique
so i‚Äôm not saying that biden‚Äôs thing right here is very good, but don‚Äôt act like trump is innocent either. elections are scummy, that‚Äôs just how it works
I don‚Äôt want Biden but Tara Reade is nonsense
But they are no longer on the list, correct? So am I to understand that you would support Biden if someone else with those qualifications for VP were on the list?
Because either way, y'all are going to say we can't elect Biden if he chooses Kamala, or if he chooses Rice. You'll find an excuse for putting in the worst president in history back in because you believe either one of the VP candidates nullifies Biden's chances.
, repeat after me. And you get extra points if you get it right. "Person, woman, man, camera, TV, President Biden".
Why haven‚Äôt Biden or his elder-abusing puppet masters cared about American manufacturing for the last 45 years? Explain that, will you?
China wants Biden - why would any American vote for him?
Marginally.  I promise you a year into his administration Biden's WH will look a lot like Trumps.  Full of Wall Street executives and warhawks.   At best you can say the Extremely Religious Right Wing won't have as much control.
It‚Äôs not illegal. Any United States citizen over the age of 35 can run for president. Kanye has the money and backing to do so. I don‚Äôt see that as cheating one bit. The Democrats are just whinning that it‚Äôll take votes away from Joe Biden. It will also take votes away from trump

That's my elevator pitch for Biden: he's boring, but doesn't boring sound nice right now?
The fact that Biden has not chosen a VP a week into August before the election is a stupid fucking publicity stunt. This is not going to benefit the country. Do better DNC. This is not a GOP supporting tweet, I‚Äôm just fucking tired of 60+ year olds acting like fucking children.
Joe Biden as well as Donald Trump are BOTH both not mental fit or stable to run the United States. We are fucked either way.
I hope Biden pardons him. What an excruciating &amp; inhumane sentence.  Those judges that upheld his sentence were proudly waving their racist flag. Each one of those white male judges should be arrested for this alone.
Biden‚Äôs Contra outreach? You‚Äôd think
Biden has the Contras running his Latino outreach
Oh ffs Biden is going to say out loud everything third wayers think
I agree. Biden is fucked and his VP will take over.
Biden is Not-A-Nazi. Yeah...  I'll go with #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Oh jeez. Go read the court transcripts.... They are public information. Take the wool off from over your eyes.
I can't find reasonable reasons to not like Biden
They are just not scary dogs. You can‚Äôt make them scary. That‚Äôs the problem Trump has wirh Biden
So insanly heartbreaking &amp; so completely avoidable. We're not beating this until we have an actual PRESIDENT. Please hurry Biden White House.
Wall Street is fine with Biden and Pelosi
I hope they get Kanye on the ballot. The few votes he gets will come from trump not Biden! The Democrats are smart enough to understand that he is mentally ill...like trump!
Well no shit Sherlock. Why would anyone drink hand sanitizer. It must be people who love Biden/Sanders/AOC. Only those people would be dumb enough
I guess Biden has your vote!!!Voting isn‚Äôt binary!!  Biden earn votes by supporting popular policies that help out the majority of voters... Medicare for all, ending wars, free college. Strengthening anti trust. Breaking up the banks...  A Trump win is the DEMOCRATIC parties fault. Never the voters..
The only real Democrat who ran for president ANTI-war and healthcare for PROFIT Tulsi Gabbard literally chewed her up and spit her out during the presidential debates and people are talking as if she can just fill in for Biden as if that is actually Democratic or actually a thing
Biden is not Trump ..wake up
I know right? At least your cousin and lifelong friend stuck with THE PLAN and let you "win" Poor Biden has to be told THE PLAN once every half hour ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
You guys heard of the fine people hoax? Biden kicked off his campaign with that lie yesterday.
We are going to need the rounds for the civil war the Left will start if Trump wins. If Biden wins, we'll need them for Betos confiscation plan. Not for mass shootings, but for the revolution you folks seem to want.
Very important to understand this. Not voting for Biden or not voting at all is the same as voting for Trump.  Make no mistake: every single one of Trump's followers will be voting for him in November.  #VoteOutTheGOP
Voting for Biden and Harris does not mean they are perfect. It is simply what needs to be done. Accountability will still be held.
People who say that voting for Biden is the same thing as voting for Trump are trying to convince you not to vote... which is the same thing as voting for Trump. Our enemies are still hard at work interfering in our elections.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
If Biden manages to win despite all of Trump's overt sabotage of basic voting processes, the Dems' response better not be "See? Our democracy works!".
Biden will hire "The Lone Ranger" to enforce his mandate.  Who was that unmasked man? I've got a silver bullet for him.
I was just thinking about what Trump said about all suburban housewives will vote for him he never mentioned that before Camilla Harris was nominated as vice president to Joe Biden. This is a very racist tweet saying that suburban housewives don't like black Americans. We 1)üëá
Not just the questions, h already destroyed everything Biden has said! haha
This is great. No debate will be required; every stupid thing Biden says, Trump can just call a press conference and pick it apart!  LOL   Joe can't take questions because he doesn't even know what he is saying!
Yes, and we need to work on ensuring certain senators don‚Äôt win. If we don‚Äôt take the Senate then even with the presidency Biden and Harris will have a hell of a time getting things done that need to get done because of what Trump has done to our country. Dems need it all back.
Well it looks like your dreams have just turned to nightmares! You might as well start now saying hello to President Biden and to vice president Harris
Oh-the words of a scared man, Biden and Harris, they are the chain to bed and you can‚Äôt do it! So tell me are your nails still intact or have you Bitten them them off yet
You are an awful governor. Please stop using Washingtonians lives for your Biden administration audition. I think they get that you are anti Constititional Republic, free-range leftist radical.
Imagine voting for Biden &amp; Harris ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Person: 1 tweet about how bad Trump is, 50 tweets about how bad Biden/Harris are.  Same Person: Upset that people think they don't want Biden to beat Trump.
Living in Seattle metro, King County... is there even a point voting for Biden?  Feels like pissing in an ocean of piss and saying that you helped.
Trump WILL destroy this country. WILL kill millions of people. And may well do even more.  Biden/Harris, well, we don't know what they'll do, but the odds of it being WORSE than Trump are slim, so I'll take them.
So as a public servant, performing the will of the governed, that means thousands of people were contacting him to do this? Naw, his days are spent auditioning for Biden administration. He needs to check a few boxes at WA states expense.
Biden will defer. He'll get run over on day one.
7 times Kamala Harris effortlessly proved just how incompetent Trump really is
After learning more about Harris, I'm legitimately getting pissed off. The problem is, we don't have a choice. We have terrible options, but we need to stop dividing the vote. Any vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump. I hate it. We cannot survive another Trump term.
My stance is very dependent on where I am. This is a rock solid, unshakeable blue state. Biden WILL win. My vote has zero impact on the actual election. Therefore, my vote is not a forced choice, it's an endorsement. And I STRONGLY feel none of the 3 options deserve that.
Biden literally doesn't even support legalizing marijuana, and Kama'lock-em-up Harris built an entire career out of throwing innocent people in prison for victimless crimes
I see no compelling reason to vote for either. Biden/Harris is an absolutely atrocious pair I agree with on *nothing,* and Jorgensen/Cohen is an absolutely pathetic, laughable ticket of completely unqualified nobodies with zero credibility (not to mention Jo is cringe af)
There is no chance of Biden losing Washington. My vote is not relevant to the outcome of the election and is not a case of harm reduction or forced preference, it's a case of making a normative endorsement of a particular candidate/ticket
So was she born in the US? Because Biden wont survive and we don't need another illegal president.
what if you have people in your life that feel the exact truth but about Gates or Biden?
Sorry folks it‚Äôs been taken down off her twitter and is no longer there.  So I can‚Äôt prove. I saw the video myself and was impressed. Well if someone recorded it, they will post it.  No poof- but I remember her saying is ‚ÄúBiden is an old man, an old racist‚Äù.
Otherwise I could say that Joe Biden  sniffed a unicorn + actually was part of Corn Pops gang, I have the photos!  Btw I‚Äôd like to see Trump saying that it was a cesspool. All the leader elites knew of the Island, on both sides of the aisle! Knowing of it doesn‚Äôt mean complicit.
Kamala Harris you are adored!!  Biden a good man.  Our ticket is hot!
To all the "apples to oranges" people out there:  Obama and Biden didn't downplay Ebola, call it a hoax, or tell us that it would magically disappear - they did their jobs.  Trump can't handle a crisis because he's mentally impaired.  That's why we have 165K+ dead from #COVID19.
I‚Äôm a suburban wife and mother and I would walk across broken glass on my hands and knees to vote for Biden and Harris.
Would be just as accurate if biden went to antifa site.
I hear he‚Äôs been spending a lot of money trying to fight this virus. And is in the background trying to help with the Biden campaign. So don‚Äôt be so ready to judge people. If you don‚Äôt know the answer don‚Äôt ask the question.
It‚Äôs just ignorance. I hope people don‚Äôt get into arguments about this shit with these people. Don‚Äôt waste your time. It‚Äôs like arguing with Trump. Spend time on lifting up Biden and Harris.
Hoping Biden holds the independent voters until after the election.
Senator Kamala Harris has campaigned for climate justice and stood up to the NRA. Her selection to Vice President Biden‚Äôs ticket is the right choice for this moment in our history; I‚Äôm looking forward to what‚Äôs to come and proud to support her.
If you‚Äôre talking down on Biden/Harris then all you‚Äôre doing is supporting/helping trump ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I love Kamala!  She gave me chills listening to her. She‚Äôs absolutely the right pick!  GO BIDEN HARRIS!  I‚Äôm going to now donate.
I am really enjoying listening to Biden and Harris without the noise of applause and screaming from the audience. It's very peaceful and calming and informative
As November approaches, you're going to notice more and more accounts claiming to be leftists who will try to encourage you not to vote. Not voting for Biden or not voting at all is the same as voting for Trump.  #ElectionInterference is constant.
Harris is unmoored in her ambition, unmoored meaning zero scruples in what she will do to further Kamala Harris. And she will be the prez as Biden will exit soon after the election. She is radical, angry, and wants power.
Gonna tell my kids this was Joe Biden's running mate
No, the premise of your question is faulty. There is no evidence to believe that Biden will behave the same way as Trump. No evidence that Biden will continue the process of destroying the country and attempting to turn it into a right-wing authoritarian dictatorship.
...oh Sorry this one is of Biden speaking as a racist. People can change, so I look for that hasn't he just doubled down?  I'm still looking for the one I saw of Kalama calling him out after the debates outside of building of brick, in front of doorway.
Bernie supporters were happy to say ‚Äúto hell with Bernie‚Äù after he endorsed Biden &amp; was unable to get him to move meaningfully left. Shocked the pundits who thought he was a ‚Äúcult leader‚Äù, but we were never a cult of personality (great track CM Punk forever) but a cult of policy.
White "leftists" going on and on about how they can't morally vote for Biden.
You and Bernie was my dream ticket, but Ill take you and Biden over The Pumpkin and The Pence any day. Can't wait for VP Debate #VoteBidenHarris2020
If Biden had picked a white dude as his running mate, would we be going all in exploring his ethnicity like people seem to be doing with Harris?
Why have I seen zero campaigning by Biden? By this time in the Obama campaign people were composing songs. Do you really all think Trump is going to lose? Did you notice that you were sure he was going to lose last time?
- excellent piece on   and bravo to Joe Biden.  Her long and dedicated career ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù &amp; yes she will be a wonderful VP and Klobuchar‚Äôs analogy of the NASA‚Äôs women beautifully depicted in ‚ÄúHidden Figures‚Äù was spot on &amp; it‚Äôs VERY EXCITING
It is true, Biden confirms.
Bottom line is that I believe in her and her ideas and I'm happy that so many of them are being adopted by Biden. She has and will continue to work hard in the name of public service because she knows it's not about her. It's about us. She has my support in all she does.
It is okay to be excited about Kamala Harris. She has changed her tune about LGBTQ people in the last few years which is good. Doesn't mean she isn't problematic, just like Biden. Regardless both of them are significantly better than the garbage currently in the Oval Office.
Perfect is the enemy of the good. For marginalized people there's a huge difference between Trump/Pence v Biden/Harris. For privileged liberals maybe not so much.
I still haven't forgotten how Biden treated Anita Hill.   Moving forward doesn't mean anything is forgotten.   I'm still voting #BidenHarris2020 .
Thank you, Juan. And for those privileged lefties at Counterpunch and the like who want the perfect and the pure it's time for them to get on board because for marginalized people (not privileged people like them) there' a HUGE difference between Biden/Harris v Trump/Pence.
...If 45 loses, there's still the damage done: fires of hatred stoked into cultural conflagrations; how much we've hastened the destruction of a habitable world; how we've alienated allies &amp; become a global joke. We need more than Biden/Harris‚Äîwe need a love revolution. ...
Why the fuck did Biden pick a cop as his running mate? Is he trying to lose this election?
So Kamala's Biden's running mate, I'm not surprised, just disappointed.
As much as I've been stanning Warren since 2016, I fully support Harris on the ticket with Biden.  I will vote #BidenHarris2020  with a big smile on my face.   With a blue wave in the Senate, Warren can thrive and work to unfuck Trump's fuckery. I'd love her 2b next Sen Maj Ldr.
Watching season 2 of Alf and they are making references to Joe Biden running for President. It‚Äôs kind of cool that Alf was ahead of its time. #Alf
She is to the left of Biden, and can be ruthless, so I think she the brawler.
I just made my first political donation, ever. Plus, I bought a Biden/Harris t-shirt. Now I want to punch a Nazi right in the fucking throat.
Everyone‚Äôs frustrated and taking solace in others verbalizing it. Honestly anyone Biden might pick would prompt a similar torrent of bile (for similar reasons; this whole campaign has been Dems telling us to get bent).
Yes he‚Äôs given us hope.  A reason to smile. BIDEN HARRIS!
"Vote Blue No Matter Who" is literally the exact same kind of totalitarian rhetoric that got us in the CURRENT mess, especially given a Biden/Harris ticket with Pete Buttigieg on the cabinet is indistinguishable in policy terms from Bush/Cheney with Paul Wolfowitz on the cabinet
Biden is the worst recent candidate except for Trump and Hillary. We were screwed before we even voted last time and this time.
Exactly. Warren supporter that will vote Biden because it's the right thing to do even though I'm not a fan of him.
It's gonna be Biden or Trump. Biden is not ideal but there's nothing to think about. Very few could be worse than Trump...
The State Department is going to need some massive rebuilding. Also, sanctions on Russia and Saudi Arabia need to be harsh and comprehensive. I hope Biden and Harris make that a priority.
Both she and Biden make noises about police reform, but Biden has said he supports community policing, which actually increases the budget/scope of policing. We need to be moving the other direction. Here's hoping they listen to the Black organizers who are pushing for change!
The available choices for the positions in the Biden administration are just delicious.  Attny General, Secretary of Treasury, Speaker of the House, Senate Majority Leader.  Strategic decisions need to be ready to go at the time of the inauguration.
Literally no one is doing this. We are all fucking terrified, and actually dealing with REAL LIFE consequences of the current administration. We can‚Äôt afford to be fucking intellectual about this. A Biden/Harris vote buys us some time to start to heal. It doesn‚Äôt end the fight.
I can find way more pics of Dumb Don with Ghislane Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstien than Biden. #TRUMPLIVESONPEDOISLAND
That would work, too, I just think she's so good with legislation that she'd be perfect at getting the right bills on Biden's desk. I don't trust Schumer for that at all.
Dude, I was already going to vote Biden/Harris, you don't have to sell it so hard
Okay cool cool, Biden/Harris - these folx want our vote, and are a heck of a lot better than the other choice, obvi. Let's push them towards abolition in the next few months, huh?
So vote for Trump to guarantee that Biden/Harris don‚Äôt get elected.
I am not a big fan of either  Biden or Harris.  Do I think they can stomp tRump? You betcha. Do I think things will change dramatically? Yes &amp; no.  Do I think Gov't action will be more in alignment with my beliefs with them in office? Fvck yes!
Joe Biden didn't pick anyone. His handlers did.
Yeah, I caucused for Bernie in 2016, and canvassed for him this year. I definitely hope Biden wins! But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll actually change much more than tone, and comes with another likely problem‚Äîwhite people feel comfortable again and stop engaging in politics.
You're wise beyond your years CJ.  Kamala bends with the wind.  If Biden wins, Kamala will be POTUS in 3-weeks to 90 days, and that is why she is his running mate.
That's good once in a while. Its Hot in CT but its August so that's not news. Wait Biden picked a running mater.
I would have liked Kamala to choose Biden as the VP- but I will take this for sure.
Once Biden promised a black woman as his VP, it kind of had to be Harris. She was the only in-the-box choice (statewide officeholder), and Biden can't afford to go out of the box.
Biden will wipe the floor in a debate with you. It's no contest. Add in a Senator Harris debate against Pence? Cherry on top. ü§£ #BidenHarris2020
No, the tough choice is Biden and Kamala. I thought you were responding to my response to a poll by  asking which of the FOUR you‚Äôd prefer to be president. And even considering it a two option poll of JUST Biden &amp; Harris, I cant decide.
I‚Äôm a little surprised! Apparently she quit following the Biden campaign on Twitter a few days ago so I thought ‚Äúwhew, at least it‚Äôs not Kamala!‚Äù
Lets' do this. Biden/Harris 2020.
It‚Äôs the definition of harm reduction. All four of them are bad news for most Americans. Trump and Pence far worse, sure. But even considering Chris‚Äô post a two-option poll and to choose between Biden and Kamala is also a choice I struggle with. Both suck for their own reasons.
As many have chimed in, this is a very safe pick by Biden. A move that won't win him any new votes in the swing states but is certain not to cost him votes at the same time. This is a great ticket and can help get the voters out (thought Tim Kaine was such a Meh pick in 2016)
I hope Biden announces his whole cabinet.  Let's get the recovery effort underway.
Oh good, Biden picked the cop. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Does Biden know she is black?
Who's Biden and what team is he being traded to?
Biden's VP was the candidates we met along the way
Not sure how I ever wound up following this guy but I'm blocking him now.  Not voting for Biden is the same as voting for Trump.  Our enemies are going to focus their efforts on this disinformation tactic the closer we get to November.  Don't be a Dave. Don't buy into it.
When Joe Biden is President,we will

Is Biden being blackmailed? Black male leaders warn Biden ‚Äòwill lose‚Äô election if he doesn't name Black female running mate
Guarantee Trump will schedule a speech or press conference as soon as it looks like Biden is about to announce. It's like clockwork. Anything to distract and draw the spotlight back on him. The media needs to pledge to ignore it, whatever it is
Sen. Warren would make a perfect Attorney General in the Biden Presidency.
- Joe Biden can actually ride a bicycle - Donald Trump can't even walk down a ramp
Must be a naive Biden supporter.
I agree that Trump is much worse, and an existential threat to democracy. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs wrong to ask ‚Äúmy team‚Äù to stand for something helpful beyond ‚Äúnot as bad as trump‚Äù, yet so many of Biden‚Äôs biggest supporters say that even doing that is helping Trump. üôÑ
I tend to get attacked and see my fellow lefties get attacked for criticizing Biden and Dems with ‚Äúdo you WANT Trump to win?‚Äù or ‚Äúwe just have to have unity, no purity tests!‚Äù and the Venn Diagram of people who make fun of Trump‚Äôs appearance is basically just a circle.
- fascinating article about the bubble wrap artist Bradley Hart and what a phenomenal idea!  Beautiful colors, realistic renditions and surprisingly efficient and effective.  Great exploration piece on glamping - that‚Äôs my way of camping.  Nice piece on Biden too! Vote
Actually...maybe Joe Biden.
Biden is not moving left. Remember the mask thing we discussed earlier?
Biden doesn't give a f*ck about trans people; one is not better than the other. One of them is just putting on a mask, so to speak.
Through ,please vote for  Joe Biden .it's the only choice it's our best choice  He is everything a president should be. He is empathetic he is smart and bright and he loves America. He was a great vice president and he will make a great president that I have no doubt
Right  and deserve better to vote him out and into prison, and Joe Biden will get our country back to being the majestic, incredible country it once was before the dictator commandant took over the presidency illegally For our very lives that we preciously and painfully have gone
You mean like the one where Hillary was given the questions beforehand so she could study? The moderator has to be you, madame governor, or another honest person who won't help Biden find his podium.
Kamala, Susan, Val is my short list for VP choice. Regardless, I will vote for Joe Biden even if he chooses a rock for his VP...üíôüíôüíô

- great discussion: the tactical mistake of Biden‚Äôs VP announcement &amp; marginalizing the position and making it appear that the most qualified will not be selected.  Agree-there are many qualified black women who don‚Äôt need that tokenism approach
Too bad you're in cahoots with Putin and Oligarchs and Ukrainian information about Biden stirred up by Guilliani. Your mentor would be ashamed of you Lenningrad Lindsey.
Biden should pick Trump as his running mate, then tell Trump he has to step down because he can't run for VP while also being President. 50% chance Trump falls for it.
Let‚Äôs see. Having debate with spouse over Biden‚Äôs plan. I‚Äôm all for lowering/capping/removing student loans but also agree in forgiveness, if possible.

Even this morons wife ,Kim Kardashian,said that Kanye is mentally Disturbed. sadly,Trump is throwing money at him,and using him  to cause Biden to lose votes ..someone in this family needs to step in and get  him some much needed help,and stop him from making him a bigger fool
Don't let this keep happening because of the Commandant ,heir Trump. We have already had one Holocaust.never again?!? Is again Don't vote for this ignorant, ignoramus.please  Vote for Biden ,he loves America,has empathy.and will make this country great ,once again
There is no way Biden can get away without debating Trump!  I see what is going on because I have clarity and truth within me.  Thank you Tucker... Thank you for reporting the Truth with sardonic wit sprinkled in!
With a presidential candidate like Biden it's quiet obvious why you would believe that.
Remember when Americans decided who the president would be?
But remember for privileged leftists re-electing trump might be ok but for those on margins it‚Äôs a huge difference with real consequences. Note Chomsky backs Biden.
The people out there preaching the pragmatism of Biden ignoring all leftist policy demands to attract moderate voters clearly haven‚Äôt read this. Democrats haven‚Äôt won the white vote in over 30 years. Going for moderate republicans isn‚Äôt the path to victory
Its like Trump listened to John Lennon's "Imagine" and thought. I could blame that on Joe Biden. Smhü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Geoff Duncan got caught. Looking at Georgia‚Äôs guidelines, they are willing to let your child die. Vote for  in 2020. Joe Biden will protect your child, Joe knows the pain of losing a child.

Dammit it people, I meant I waited hours for someone to point out that he said it wrong. He can't get away with a single misspeak. Try listening to Biden complete a sentence. I don't agree with Dinesh on this, but he is right about different pronounciations.

I think Biden is picking Harris
I am absolutely positive that THAT is exactly what Biden &amp; Trump's owNER wants people to think TWO FALSE CATEGORIES ONLY If you don't believe the wmds russiagate incubator babies media you have to be you ABSOLUTELY have to be a Cheeto lover or a PRO-WAR Obama "democrat"üôÑ STUPID
So the Second Amendment will just go away, overnight, without YOU??  BS, Biden will not take our guns.  You are so desperate with another SCARE tactic.  Just resign and save us the trouble of an Election!!!
Imagine unironically believing that JOE BIDEN is what socialists, Communists, and Anarchists want
Trust me when I tell you that you are the tremendous lawlessness that‚Äôs here in the United States. Please to go ahead and resign before you get embarrassed by losing badly against Joe Biden
And know Biden is against God! And he‚Äôs going to take away your guns!!ü•∂ü•∂
I always respected you,but I am so disappointed because your remarks are racist.Whoever Joe Biden pics as his running mate will not be about race it will be about who is the most intelligent and who fits the vice president position .shame on you ,you should know better
I find this very racist I am surprised ,and disappointed at C cup
He's saying the Latino community is rich and diverse, but discourse tends to center on the black community. If you actually think Biden meant "blacks have no culture" you've got epic brain worms.
After watching POTUS &amp; Biden speak lately, Bush II looks like the most eloquent SOB ever! ü§£
Jesus shut the fuck up with this nonsense. Maybe Biden could listen and help himself by supporting incredibly popular policy! Why is it the fault of Biden‚Äôs critics for asking for more, and not Biden himself for refusing to get behind policies popular with voters?
Let me just say that if Biden WAS powerful enough to actually hurt God, maybe the smart money would be to follow him instead.
If there is a God, Trump will be watching Biden as POTUS from a prison cell.  Narcissists are always the victims in their own eyes.
Trump just says things and throws ‚Äústuff‚Äù out there to see what will stick or what he can make people believe. Biden wants to hurt God? What?
Michelle Obama! Biden would completely clean Trump‚Äôs clock and Democrats would surge down the ballot. We want Michelle! #MichelleObama
Boy you don‚Äôt give up do you?  A new lie daily re Biden.  ü§ÆIf Biden wins and gives a lawful order to have a stubborn Trump removed from the West Wing, the military will obey.

Trump is racist, cartoonishly corrupt, and destroying our standing in the world. So it ain't Trump is a pretty compelling reason.  Biden is a center left technocrat, he'll be great. Prior to running most republicans also thought he was a great person.

Is QAnon the shape of the Republican backlash to come? -- If Joe Biden wins, there will be a far-right reaction. This deranged cult is already finding a place in the GOP.
It is exactly like that, Biden is working towards becoming President, Trump is seemingly working towards losing

Not a nice lady at all.  She &amp; Biden started their campaign with a bald-faced lie - that Trump had described Nazis, KKK, etc as including some "fine people", when, in fact, he had strongly &amp; repeatedly denounced them (&amp; the "fine people" were locals attending to support R.E. Lee.
So many Trump signs in PA.  Upper Bucks.  Zero biden.  Zero.  Like an empty vessel, zero.
Thanks. You gonna vote for Biden?
Joe Biden sexually assaulted Tara Reade. Know this truth. Unfollowing or muting your "Principled Progressive" friends isn't going to erase this truth.  #MeToo #IbelieveTara #BelieveWomen
I would remind you that Obama Expanded Bush's wars, which Biden voted for. I would also remind you that Obama passed the laws that are now being used to brutalize protesters across America. The issue isn't the number of promises fulfilled, it's the weight of the promises.
Joe Biden is a racist.
#Medicare4All, student debt forgiveness, his antiwar stance, his support for Palestinian self-determination, his morality, etc.  Biden doesn't stand anywhere his corporate/billionaires buddies don't tell him, he's a liar, backs racist policies, etc.

Biden wasn‚Äôt my choice either. But I will happily cast my vote for him and then for Kamala in 2024. And your money, your choice. I think all tactics should be employed, the stakes are too high to be prudish at this point.
You argued that Biden has moved left. I responded with the FACT that Biden has advocated for conservative policies in the past, and that where Biden claims to have moved left, there is no indication that he was being sincere (I/E, Wall St. Donors) so your argument is invalid.
So Democrats want us to put the fate of the election in the hands of people who believe Biden is their only hope for survival. What could go wrong?

Honest question, what if you voted for Obama, and Hilary, and still plan on voting for Biden/Harris, but don‚Äôt like Harris due to her time as DA? Does that makes you a racist?

Pence has lost 165,000+ lives on his watch. Willing to take my chances on Biden/Harris.
Funny how Biden is smart and capable until he needs to be a confused old man who doesn't know what an Anarchist is. Love how y'all will give him the benefit of the doubt on this shit and have the nerve to mock the GOP for doing the same dumb thing. No thanks. I'm good.
Cop for VP? Barf.  All politicians are awful. I'm voting for the (much, much) better platform, not because I think Biden and Harris are great people who deserve to be in power.
Why does your dad hate Biden?
Yes!!!!! Fuck yes!!! Im so happy!!! There is hope! #KamalaHarrisForVP  Open SmartNews to read 'Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman' here:  or you can directly access the content using this link here:
Biden picked who we expected him to pick for the reasons we expected him to pick her.  That‚Äôs all the opining I can muster about it presently.
Father, thank you for clarifying. I think it shows EXACTLY the type of man and campaign Joe Biden is running
BIDEN AND HARRIS are the traitors they serve corporate interests and never minorities or the working class. What they should be doing is muzzling the corporations and and empowering the working class. #Hawkins2020
My friends are calling me Larrydamus. Through all the twists and turns I said it was gonna be Biden/Harris since spring 2019. Today‚Äôs lucky numbers are 6, 18 and 52.
Kamala Harris is a former police officer, and a member of the Establishment undemocratic party. She has never passed or supported the working class in anyway. IMPEACH BIDEN!
No. He literally said he wanted to prosecute people with my political beliefs like two weeks ago. Fuck Joe Biden. If the Dems think they don't need to reach out to the Left, that's their fucking problem. I'm not letting them threaten me with the GOP as an excuse to be lazy.
So during a time when everyone is screaming for criminal justice reform and police reform, Biden decides to choose Kamala Harris as his VP? This election really is going to hell in a hand basket.
Never expected Biden to be playing 4D chess. Damn.
I am very disappointed. I thought the day Biden's crew announced their choice of VP candidate would give us a hint of their overall plan. Instead they chose an Jamaican/Indian woman not an African American woman with no plan for the future.
The main problem I have with leftists is their purity tests.  Anything less than Bernie‚Äôs entire platform is a no go.  With Biden, you get like 75-80% of that. It‚Äôs really up to the senate to dictate Biden‚Äôs agenda.
I'm voting  Washington will carry for Biden/Harris with or without my vote. At least this will possibly strengthen some kind of opposition to Republicans and Democrats in the future. If this vote results in Trump's election so be it.
It‚Äôs actually very touching, it‚Äôs about grief:  In the video it is 2 minutes in.
Excellent choice! I look forward to a Biden/Harris Whitehouse!
Biden and Harris will be the end of African American Men
Opinion | Kamala Harris was Joe Biden‚Äôs boldest and most qualified pick
Is it just me or did  Biden just channel his inner "Ash Ketchum" &amp; summon his most powerful Pokemon?
Still trying to use tactics from his 2016 playbook.  First nickname apparently didn't stick to Biden like it did with Hilary.  Now he's throwing out a lame nickname for Kamala.  Man-Baby is going down in November.
You know I won't. But I find this entire situation hilarious. It's a bold move for Biden and one that might actually work.
Biden picked Kamala Harris.  Called that a long bloody time ago
That's exactly how I feel. I'm voting for Biden/Harris, but holding my nose as I do so. I know at least one member of my family is voting third party (Luckily WA is a solidly blue state).
The Harris pick is strategic. It won't really drive away any of the "center-right" that have switched to Biden after realizing the dumpster fire of Trump. She has a political fanbase that it brings in, and so many progressives know that we have to vote this ticket no matter what.
First Biden, now Harris. The 2020 election is DOA.
Can anyone tell me why I should vote Biden in the replies?
Joe Biden picked the VP with the hardest name for Trump to pronounce. #kamala
Chidi!!! One of the most satisfying things I can already see? Telling these cornflakes to get over it! Then remind them that Biden is their President!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Wowza, Biden making moves
Hey Trump supporters!! I'm just gonna say this now!!  Get over it Cornflakes!! Biden IS going to be your President!   My name is Chris, and I approve this message!
On behalf of the Black Community, Nobody is voting for Biden/Harris. Thanks‚ò∫Ô∏è
That has got to be the worst fucking combination i have ever heard of. Joe Biden and Kamekai Harris? Are you fucking kidding me
GREAT NEWS !!!
Soon to be President Biden, and Vice President Harris!!!  I am so excited to get liberated from Trump and his cronies!!!
If the NFL goes with it, the sport of American football may be the best living campaign ad the Biden campaign has, because gods know they've got no other high ground other than "not Trump". The architect of the '94 crime bill and the Dems' top cop...in 2020...
Biden will be our next POTUS!!!
Joe Biden is literally begging me not to vote for him.
Oh Angela!!! I just cannot wait to see Biden and Harris sworn in!! January of 2021 will be liberating!!

Biden just chose Kamala Harris as his running mate.
BREAKING: Biden reveals VP pick
For those interested in the VP pick, the Thursday speakers: Joe Biden; the Biden Family; Cory Booker; Gavin Newsom; Keisha Lance Bottoms; Tammy Baldwin; Tammy Duckworth; Chris Coons and Kamala Harris.  Duh!
I think that is a product of the breathless media. Yes...Biden has changed the timeline. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs for drama. He knows the importance of this choice and wants to get it right. Just my take on it.
UT county how could you elect the liberal  You have to question the mental stability of anyone that would support dementia Creepy Joe Biden. Vote Tanner out of office.  #TRUMP2020 #KAG2020LandslideVictory
I think it is very funny that a large percentage of Biden voters are expecting him to die in office

Why New Gun Owners Should Fear A Joe Biden Presidency
Oh STFU!! The stock market is NOT helping the average US Citizen. Nor is it reducing the death toll from Trump's incompetence!  Remember that in November folks! The stock market is much more important than you or your loved ones lives!   Biden gets my vote!
Honestly I will laugh my ass off if Biden chooses Buttigieg as his VP after all of this speculation. It would be the funniest, most plausible pick he could make that would piss of literally everybody and have exactly zero political ramifications for him.
Biden VP pick: Susan Rice, the diplomat  and lightning rod  Susan looks sharp... Capable..and the logical choice.. As for kamala. AG is her thing
Rumor has it you stopped following Joe Biden on Twitter. Does that mean you are not the VP pick?
It's a reverse discrimination dog whistle to his followers that men are being victimized by liberals and women. I predict a fresh wave of folks complaining that Biden is breaking the law (based on what I've read, he isn't).  It also gets the conversation off of Russia/Covid/etc.
Biden also has a back story that appeals. Following a fatal accident involving a wife and child he made a point of commuting each evening  to surviving sons from Washington and knew many passengers &amp; staff on Amtrak by name. I don‚Äôt know why but I feel it shows a decent man.

Anyone have any thoughts on this or noticed it too? Biden gets a ton of likes on his tweets, has less followers than the prez, yet prez has 80M followers and I don't think I've seen a tweet with more than 300k likes.
Don't know why we're stressing over Biden's VP pick, it's not like there are any good options there
Didn't watch it. No need to ever watch a Trump News conference ever again. I know it's filled with lies.   I will wait till January of 2021, when President Biden gives us a news conference!
Mr.  There's a story regarding Opponent  and Hunter Biden in BIG TROUBLE. Not sure if you knew what's going on and Ukraine will be investigating  aka Sniffling Joe.   God bless you and protect you always.

Minn. group that saw $$ surge, some from Biden staffers, bailed out alleged violent criminals: report
Obama/Biden is the reason we got trump, right? Biden/horrible choice, will be the reason we wind up with President Alex Jones. If the candidates refuse to fight for us, then they don't get my vote. Period. Forcing me to choose between evil and diet evil, is not a choice. #FUCKEM
So good ole sleepy Joe is saying low income people are criminals. Think about that ... Minn. group that saw $$ surge, some from Biden staffers, bailed out alleged violent criminals: report
We're not given any worthwhile candidates.  Out of a country of over 300 million people, are we supposed to believe that Trump and Biden are the best we can do?
This has been made clear over and over. Joe Biden is a narcissist and a racist and that has been made clear over and over. He verbally slams black people and they still get brainwashed by the left. This is changing and I believe 2020 will be a game changer!
Scott Bolden, DNC PAST CHAIRsaid this morning that the black vote is guaranteed. He said blacks will vote for Biden no matter what. I DISAGREE üíØ perrrrrcent.
Do we think Biden actually tweeted this.....?
Actually saw a Biden sign in Oxford. Didn‚Äôt know people were happily/voluntarily voting for him lol
Biden is a terrific Republican candidate
Dems are fucked. Too much leg work for the electorate to be so fortunate as to get the status quo compromise of Biden.
So what you are saying is that the protests that are happening today under the Trump presidency would happen inder a Biden presidency.  In order to stop the protests that are happening with Trump as president will stop if Trump is re-elected.  Your logic is that of a grifter.
We won't allow Biden to be elected President.
Really? Because Kamala would be the easiest to control by the lib/left once Biden is medically removed from the Oval.  Know liar Susan Rice is a traitor &amp; wouldn't be controllable at all.
One constituency Biden has is the black vote. If he chooses a white woman instead, will will lose the black vote and perhaps replaced by that white woman candidate who cannot beat Trump
Rainbows üåà and unicorns ü¶Ñ . US response to COVID-19 won‚Äôt even start until January 22 2021 and even then only if Biden wins.

To be honest it would probably take some kind of experimental teledildonics for Biden to live to next January

Look kiddo, you know Trump can barely string three words together at this point. Biden can physical and mentally run circles around Trump.  Biden has an election platform. What is Trump running on? "I don't want to go to jail" is not a 4-year plan.
Yep, he's mad he got fired so his big revenge is to vote for Biden.
I'm a Christian and I don't support Trump. Heck, I don't even support Biden either.
I agree. Ultimately it will be about building. In the USA there is a golden opportunity in November to make a big difference. It's a real shame Bernie isn't the one up against Trump. But let's hope Biden will shape up.
So much for my wager of "Joe Biden accidentally picks WWF's Kamala as VP"
I voted green in 2016, but I was in a solid blue state. I won't be this time. I'm all for us getting super leftist people elected, but we can't have 4 more years of trump, it's at least one more supreme court choice he gets.  I fucking hate Biden, but a blowout needs to happen.
Has anyone ever seen our nation so divided and sick before? Has anyone ever heard a president attack his opponents or other political party the way Trump has? It's unreal how terrible he treats those who are Democrat! Trump's buddies are just as vile. I cannot wait to vote Biden!
I'm voting for Biden, because he is going to save this great nation from the pathetic idiot that is destroying it. 160,000 dead, a Bankrupt nation, and the most divided this nation has ever been. All under Trump and his crime family.
LRT:  The biggest problem with this election is the bad stuff Trump is doing is almost all stuff that Biden supported as long as it wasn't done by Trump
Yep. She'll be easier to control by the lib left especially when she's made Pres once Biden is forced to resign due to senility.
Dems charge Trump to defund Social Security; GOP says Biden embracing socialism
There are more Republicans against Trump who either won‚Äôt vote or will vote for Joe Biden than people realize
Potential Biden VP pick Susan Rice's son is a massive Trump-loving conservative
This is your Legacy &amp; History of your True Colors.  Demonrats puppet aka  Records of Shame.  Hannity: Biden doesn't know what city he's in  via
Everyone pretty much knows Biden (age 77 now, 78 upon inauguration) will be a one-termer and will be the wedge for his VP to become the 47th president.  That's why he needs to think long and hard about who it's going to be.
I'm fairly certain that all the voters who would be influenced by a bully mocking a disabled reporter, for instance, are so firmly in the Trump camp it would be impossible to pry them out by the sight of Biden one-upping him with his own monkey show. We're going for independents.
Why is Biden so wimpy, biding his time on the VP decision?
WHAT IS AMAZING  MR BIDEN??? IS HOW MUCH MISS INFORMATION YOU ARE ALWAYS  DISPLAYING???   WHY DON'T YOU JUST  GO AWAY  SOMEWHERE???
CORRUPTION in our faces EVERY SINGLE DAY! I know this gmhas to be fraudulent! There isn‚Äôt a single ethical Republican left in office!
that says Biden 2020. I'm confused.
Biden is going to have a heck of a mess to clean up.
Disagree. Biden made Obama palatable to white voters.  He got Obama to the WH.   Hillary should have chosen Bob Casey of PA.  Conservative D.  He would have gotten those extra votes in PA or MI.
Not a fan of Trump or Biden, but no one person can take the blame for this collapse.  It's our own appetite for lusts of the flesh.  James 4:1-4
Biden only needs to get 2% of the white vote (&gt; age 45) in six states (MI, PA, OH,FL, WI &amp; AZ. The only woman to poll positively in those states was Harris.
Trump is going to do as much damage as possible before he is evicted!   The damage is severe. Trump has literally destroyed this nation.   Biden! It's time to come out swinging!
I don't give a f$ck how hard Trump tries to make it for me to vote! I guarantee I will vote! Even if it means being in a wheelchair, hospital bed, or on a ventilator!   I will stand in line for the next 2 months if that's what it takes!! Biden will get my vote!
His constant bashing of Democrats is getting pretty old. I think it's time for Biden to come out swinging! Trump is sealing his fate. If anyone on the left was on the ropes, Trump destroyed those potential votes.
I believe that Kamala Harris will be the VP pick because she is a weak willed Dem who will be easily controlled should Biden have to bow out of the Oval in 6mos leaving her as President. Rice is a traitor w her own agenda who won't be bullied by her own party.
Actually, we do. Billionaires provide jobs where the working class can work. You know jobs that provide money/security. Jobs that you/Biden are trying to take away.  Heard of that before?
Biden should pick 3 Vice Presidents to appeal to the polyamorous voter.
Biden needs to be more Obama like, and inspire people to vote for him
What are you posing for? Question your own sanity if you follow Biden. He is a very troubled man. Be open to sane change not violent demonstrators that crazy Pelosi &amp; Schumer suport plus Socialism. Your Pose looks like Narcissism.
I want to thank you for the excellent videos that show how much of a snake Trump and his crime family is.   I cannot wait to vote for Biden. No matter how hard Trump tries to prevent me from voting, I will! I will stand in line for 60 days if I have to!
Don't BLAME what you have done on Biden.  He hasn't made the decisions for the last four years.  YOU HAVE!!!  BLAME GAMES are for sissies. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpCantRideABike
Trump is a vile racist. It's so obvious. Biden will literally heal the enormous damage Trump has inflicted on the race relations in this nation. I am literally voting for Biden, because I want the racist Trump gone.
She never said that wasn't his intention. Her point was that the black vote doesn't belong to the . and that Biden should offer something more then not Drumpf to attract votes. You know that but you're just an entitled troll. McResistence.
Biden is so "Old School", it scares me.  We can't continue to move in circles where the only choices we have are "Old School" or a total outright "Idiot" like tRUMP.  We need progress toward "Common Sense" and a halt to "Slavery" once and "for all peoples".  Mark Charles in 2020.
It‚Äôs really just by a hair that Joe Biden is hanging on!

It has been awhile since I felt hopeful, so this is Great! Excited that Trump is having a meltdown; &amp; Excited about Kamala Harris being picked by Biden! Also Happy for Chrissy Teigen &amp; John Legend on their good news!

I remember joe Biden saying he was gonna run for US senate. While a gaffe, coincidentally, his senate seat is up for re-election this year
Team Joe, is so cool. Like hipster, ironic, twenty years behind cool. #TeamJoe  #Biden  #joecool #maverick #egoiswritingchecks
vote for Biden thats how it stops
at least biden knows how to work hard and not sit there doing nothing while everyone else does the work.
Yes.  Please give Obama and Biden hours and hours of free airtime talking about all the great things they did and undermining everything  Cheeto...
So are biden harris ever going to take question from the press?   they ask for a 3 month mask mandate but refuse to clarify their comments. shove your mask and vaccine where the sun dont shine.
anybody else watching this biden news conference?  we must all wear mask for the next 3 months. bullshit.   he is so low energy, is he ok?
Mark my words: Biden will regret having not chosen Karen Bass or Elizabeth Warren and thereby alienating the progressives of the party and independent leftists. I'm terrified of a repeat of the 2016 election now, esp. since  gives Trump the same odds he had then
Either way the realty is you have 2 people to pick from: the Trump &amp; Biden. Full stop, that‚Äôs it...
What Kamala Harris reveals about Joe Biden. Commentary from  at the
If they were gonna take advantage of a dead man's account to keep tweeting it should have been more creative at least.   Like, "did you see what Biden did now? Laughing so hard that I'm literally dead."
The guy who died after getting infected by the hoax virus at Trump's rally says that Biden's campaign is weird.   Huh.
Biden is not a Catholic. Read the catechism.
When Biden announces Harris as his running mate
If he wanted dirt on the left (specifically the Biden campaign), he could use ANYTHING joe Biden has said
Donald Trump saying he loves Fracking! Seriously!! I vote we just let Trump open his stupid ass mouth, because every time he does, it's a vote for Biden!! Trump is trying to kill the world, &amp; his followers don't even care. #FUCKTRUMPANDHISCRONIES
Vote Green Party or stay home then, since voting for Biden is such an obvious non starter. Trump gets your vote either way, and thanks you for your support
NOT GOING TO BE A PRESIDENT BIDEN!!
Vote for Trump. He's your only hope. He understands the nuances of race relations and identity, Biden doesn't!   Biden is a racist, Trump has done more for Black and Brown people than any president, evendors Lincoln
at least he actually does stuff and and is giving money for improvements to infrastructure. I don‚Äôt care for politicians. Trumps not a politician. He actually does stuff. Biden‚Äôs been in Office for like 50 years ...
YES YES YES THANK YOU LORD JESUS GLORY GLORY GLORY AIN'T NO STOPPING US NOW WE'RE ON THE MOVE VOTE JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS TO GOD BE THE GLORY HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH AMEN AMEN AMEN!!!!!!!

god Biden is insufferable
So biden harris first campaign event is two and a half hours late,  I think Biden just figured out who his vp pick is.
I cant wait to watch how the media will treat harris and biden differently than  The difference will be astounding.
Watch the first Biden/Cameltoe press conference
Biden said he would possibly veto M4A, wrote the most racist crime bill in modern history, was apart of the birth of our horrible border policy, Kamala hid exonerating info as a PA, enforces longer terms to provide the state with cheap labor, then laughed about herself smokingpot
Class act, both Biden and Harris. #BidenHarris2020  #BlueWave2020
Wrong, Bishop. Biden is a Catholic. Now tweet an apology for your error.
He knows Biden is not Clinton right and this is not 2016?  Asking for a friend
Again this is not 2016, Trump has 3 and 1/2 years to ruin America and most importantly Joe Biden is not Hilary Clinton.
Biden / Harris illusion will last 4 years max
To hell with Biden and all the liberals. #MAGA2020
Is Trump a moderate? No. Nothing moderate about him in any way. But you love him for his extremism.   So weird for you to criticize Biden for this.
Yeah, whiny leftists, Biden sucks. Kamala sucks. Democracy will always suck under capitalism. Politics is dirty and not always our prison-abolition wet dreams made reality. But, wow, I'd really rather have the illusion of democracy under neo-liberal capitalism than a neofascist!!
Joe Biden is gonna sniff Kamala‚Äôs hairris
Biden and the Ugandan giant how can u lose
are you backing Joe Biden this election?
Here too.  Totally support this decision and thrill at the thought of what a President Biden cabinet will look like.  Wowza.  So ready to see an end to the deluge of daily ugliness we have endured for the last four years.
Tbh, Biden could have picked a russet potato as his running mate and I would still vote for him. I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs  though (and not a potato)
But yeah, Harris and Biden are a couple of great people. Face it, both sides are pretty much GIGO - Garbage In, Garbage Out. Garbage politicians go into office, and garbage bills, taxes, etc. come out that we have to deal with and they do not.
Biden fought de-segregation of schools, because he didn't want his kids to "go to a racial jungle."
I‚Äôm so disappointed with this whole biden campaign already
Empathy vs Assholes = #Biden vs #Trump
Irrationally refusing to look into Biden and Kamala Harris more closely is an odd take, and pretty dangerous.   Also, quarantine Donald? Pretty sure it was governors forcing the country into quarantine, and leftist governors forcing us to stay in quarantine.
Biden has had decades to solve shit, and hasn't. The crime bill, for one, plus other lovely accolades in his political career.  And Kamala hiding DNA evidence is pretty low.  We, yet again, have an election with two pretty shitty candidates.
Eh, maybe you should look into Harris and Biden a little more first.
Well, yeah. But Kamala is hardly a champion of justice herself. So while Biden might still be the "better" choice. That doesn't mean we need to ignore the issues with presidential candidate Biden and his VP pick. We can't just ignore because "oh it's still better than Trump.
I am honestly wondering if Biden and the left/DNC even want to win this election, or want Trump to win so they can keep blaming the decades of corruption, ineptitude and the current pandemic on him. #KamalaIsaCop
BREAKING: Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
Biden is not Clinton and trump had not been president for 3 1/2 years and ruined United States
Yeah you know why Biden will do something at about the pandemic other than sit on his ass and golf
Biden is no Catholic.
The GOP still has not figured out that Joe Biden is not Clinton I see.
Fresh ink from
All joking aside, nothing about Joe Biden currently comes off as strong, competent or honest.
biden still will win by 18%
Biden? The puppet candidate suffering from dementia, ahead in the polls? Sounds like a fake poll, just as in 2016.
It doesn't matter.  You'll all fall in line behind Biden anyway.  Cenk already said anybody that doesn't vote for Biden is morally inferior, so why should the DNC allow you to be a part of their convention when you've already pledged your loyalty to them?
I feel like, Biden + team obviously are trying to balance: who they think would do the best job, bring the right qualities - with also, who brings the votes, helps them win? Their fave, might not poll as well. All the options were so great. I trust them to choose correctly. üñ§
I don‚Äôt believe that Joe Biden actually writes any of these tweets. Love them or hate them, at least I know that Trump does. At least we are hearing from the actual candidate and not some employee.
And, to top it all off, the Dems &amp; the MSM are blaming the Russians for Biden's unpopularity. You just can't make this stuff up!
Biden is totally out of touch with the American people &amp; himself, for that matter.
No way Biden picks the rat as his running mate
Yep so Biden up at least 5
They told him Biden is picking Harris as vp
So the info he got in Biden from Rudy was crap, got it.
‚ÄúBiden can ride a bike, he mentally stable. Even if he bit his own wife‚Äôs finger, prefers truth over facts, and can‚Äôt remember if he‚Äôs in Iowa or New Hampshire, he‚Äôs mentally stable, he can ride a bike‚Äù

Why do we need to tax the rich when we can just borrow trilions of dollars and never pay it back?  Not being "contrary" just tired of Bernie's people rooting against Biden, which may not apply to you personally but is a popular theme with Bernie linked accounts
So is it insecurity or just being so cucked by Trump that you bootlick this hard.  Even if it said Biden, flying a giant flag with a politicians name on your truck is just cringe.  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Tim for Biden to announce his VP pick
Sorry, no clarification needed. He stepped in it once again. For pity's sake, Biden is in mid-stage dementia. He needs to retire. This Dem trainwreck of a candidate is painful to watch, &amp; I am even a Trump supporter.
The sirens should be going off yet all is silent.  We have observed Biden and have concluded he would be sliced and diced in a Debate.  THE DNC &amp; BIDEN CAMPAIGN KNOW IT TOO  So WHY did they agree to 3 Debates starting in December?  WHAT do they have planned BEFORE SEPTEMBER?
Yeah, we will once Biden is POTUS!
Odd that the Democrat base sat at home and let all the Democrats you don't approve of vote for, and thereby select,  Joe Biden
Omg make this pay-per-view and take my money please oh sweet baby Biden-hurting Jesus, make this a thing.
If elected Biden will stab God in the eye with a sharp stick
You are lost and as such your opinion means little. You stand with anti Semitic Marxists and think you are on a path to victory... Throw in Biden and then throw in the Anarchists and the ANTIFA??? No wonder you are lost and why you will lose.
We now have to figure out what the DEMS &amp; DNC are up to before September. The DNC agreed to 3 Debates in September. YOU have seen Biden the last few days and know he has lost it. THEY KNOW IT TOO! So WHY did they agree unless they knew something was happening before those dates?
Biden already has my vote, man. Trump doesn't need to keep selling me on him....
E N E R G Y.  Biden is against energy.   Biden should use this in a campaign ad, lol. I'm not even mad. This is amazing.
Lol Trump thinks Biden can destroy God, Guns, and even  E N E R G Y.  Biden must be powerful af.
Economy?    he said light bulbs made him look orange, people didn‚Äôt have water for showers before he was president.  Said Biden would take away god and the church.    He is out of his god damn mind
I think this is fair, considering what they've been up to with money shenanigans. But... bad timing for Biden, since it'll be more "deMoCraTs aRe cOminG foR yEr gUns!!!"
I say Biden called prez at 8pm pacific
Yep people Still not figured out that Biden is not Clinton
If Biden is an atheist he has my vote!

I remember, that scares me! What kind of false accusation will they come up with relating to Hunter Biden &amp; Joe?
He knows Biden won‚Äôt pardon him.
Wow! I can‚Äôt believe some people want this man as President when he is intimidating the postal service. The back-and-forth comes amid a vigorous campaign by President Trump to sow doubts about mail-in voting as he faces a difficult fight for reelection against Democrat Joe Biden.
I‚Äôve read it. We already have evidence that Obama directed the whole corrupt operation.
You‚Äôve missed something. Indictments don‚Äôt need to reach Obama/Biden to incriminate them, only their close officials. We already have plenty of evidence in the public domain.
He directed it. We have the records of the White House meeting where Obama led the whole thing. January 5th 2017.
He‚Äôll change his mind when the indictments pile up on Obama/Biden administration.
Name a reason you not voting for BIDEN without mentioning TRUMP
Will, what did you honestly expect....the corrupt protecting the corrupt! Durham and Barr gonna make "swamp" very uncomfortable for the next few months....Biden needs to be worried, he was dead caught in the middle of this abomination of a presidential coup!
The subject was "being creepy" per you. Trump talking about dating his daughter isn't creepy?  Um ok..üòÇüòÇüòÇ Let me break this down for you.  If Joe Biden was a paper sack of potato peels, he would be a better, more effective president than Trump could be on his very best day.

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
What people don't understand about my outrage is I have no real problem w/Harris or Biden being on the ticket.    What I have a major problem with is BOTH on ticket &amp; NO Progressive representation on the ticket.
Trump has already said he won't accept Biden winning.  Nothing new here.
After Biden in office;  Federal control of covid-19 testing &amp; mandate on face masks.  Children reunited with parents &amp; Defund ICE. Total remodel DHS.  Replace cabinet with actually qualified people. Start undoing all the BS trump put in place. Prosecute #ProsecuteTrumpNow &amp; Barr
Bullshit, Biden is far more intelligent than the clowning tge while house. Thighland, Yo se mites, and let's not forget 2 Corinthians.
To: Mitch McConnel Ya know, it's one thing for your GOP folks to slant questions during hearings to "get the other side of the story"  It's quite another for Ron Johnson to blatantly say that he is using his committee to get dirt on Biden for the sole purpose of electing trump
Gotta love the deflection. Biden‚Äôs gaffes are dementia, it‚Äôs elder abuse.
More deflection. It‚Äôs hard to accept where this‚Äôs going, isn‚Äôt it? Indictments are coming for the Obama/Biden administration.
So......when Biden is Inaugurated, would you prefer he quote Gerald Ford....re: Nixon "Our long National nightmare is over" or should he say...re: trump "All of our National dreams have come true"
How is there not an age limit on who can run for president? Like this man Biden is 77 years old, would be 78 going into office. Like what?? The average life expectancy for a male in the US is 76 üòÇ
Except, this one won‚Äôt fall apart because of Obama/Biden and Mueller corruption.
Imagine if Biden or Obama or Hillary announced to the nation they they were "coordinating" with the Treasury Secretary to give "payments" to the American people without Congressional approval?
And we know she is voting for Biden-Harris
Thank you I Love my country and our democratic system. That's why I'm voting Biden!
Biden and Harris will end this national nightmare we are living in.  Hands down, they will restore civility, stop the racism, stop the madness Ttump has brought down on all of us.  So pack your bags cause you going down too.

So stop telling me to vote for the "lesser evil" when there is no such thing. There is no Biden and Trump, there is only capitalism and fascism. There is no voting them away. We are so far past that point.
The Dems kneecapped Bernie because he would have actually won, and he would have been bad for capitalism. They pushed for Biden because he's a capitalist. Dems and Republicans are on the same side, capitalism. The presidential election is just a sitcom. I'm tired of watching tbh.

Prevaricator trump is saying Kamala Harris (who was born in California) does not meet the citizen requirements. Who else will he falsely accuse? My senseless neighbor came over to tell me that Biden will need to pick another running mate. Fox news does it again.
Biden doesn't inspire me even by 1/10ths of the way Obama did.  If that doesn't tell you how jaded I am about the elections, nothing will. This shit needs to end.
Counter hot take:  If you don't vote for Biden you have chosen to reinforce fascism.  There is a time to attack and a time to defend. The left lost this run and now we must mitigate damage. Vote for the enemy you want. Biden and Kamala have BOTH been dragged left in the past.

Seems like Biden isn't allowed in public at all, without supervision. That's probably a good idea...
If he truly 'understood what he posted was wrong' he never would've posted in the first place  wait for it ~ trump will come to his defence  Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  via
She made him cry.   I can't wait to see what will happen when the Biden/Harris take office.
Such a lier can you even tell the truth once. I tell ya you don‚Äôt deserve to be Biden‚Äôs VP. You disgrace the position.
Congratulations! I'm so VERY happy Joe Biden made you his choice for his running mate! You'll make a superb VP!
My 91 yr old Mom,  just called to tell me that she had decided in Jan 2017 to vote for Biden in 2020.  Me: Mom, are you OK? Mom: I'm fine, why? Me: Um, Joe wasn't running then Mom: I know, what I meant was I'd vote for any Dem who could fog up a mirror on election day.  Whew!!
I could feel my whole body relax when Biden &amp; Kamala spoke about their Covid-19 plan this morning. I know I was getting the truth. I wish we could paste Biden &amp; Kamala into the WH!
Medical Advisor to Biden: If all Americans wear masks for 3 months we can save 40,000 lives Biden: Then we will order it  Medical Advisor to trump: (same as above) trump: I might lose votes if I order that, so no.
Biden/Harris 2020.  Yea baby!!!
Even if masks are required in heavily populated areas or areas where #COVID19 cases are high... cases aren't high everywhere. For example, would you force someone to wear a mask on a ranch in Wyoming? Biden/Harris and many of their supporters sound like control freaks to me.
So will she announce she is supporting the Biden/Harris ticket to avoid past missteps at the Republican convention?
Biden and Harris just had a private meeting with a number of advisors, including former Fed Chair Janet Yellen....  I would loved to have heard the discussion about the current Fed action of buying  corporate stocks to prop up the market.
Kanye may have danced with the devil but who's throwing the Ball?  Who is not only dancing but sleeping w the devil?  A: The puppet masters that control Biden (they needed one who was weak, loosing his faculties &amp; unable to fight) and have placed KHarris to assume the throne....
And he may have a stroke if Biden names you Attorney General...... Please, please Joe.....just do it

You just admitted you‚Äôre mean to Biden psycho.
Even so, I think Ayaan has more than earned the right to be half-wrong once in a while. I think Biden's sloppiness is quite dangerous.
Sir low income housing is a necessity for alot of families.  Why are you so against the low income folks who are hard workers? I guess if your not rolling in money you don't count. Biden for president 100%.
45 is literally an overt racist, son of a klansman. Biden has certainly said (and yes - 30 yrs ago) done some racist acts, but you're fooling urself if u believe black ppl think Biden is racist. White, 45 supporters are the ONLY ones who say Biden's racist. üôÑü§£üåä

Sudden thought just occurred to me: If #TrumpKillsUSPS, doesn't that also affect his base of voters as well--not just Biden and the Democrats?
Too bad it won't happen with the Biden Harris ticket.
I'm not young and I'm not going to vote for Prez/VP, only for down ballot.    My state is a guaranteed win for Dems. Biden doesn't even bother to campaign here. The elections are called before they even start counting my state's votes. My vote literally does not matter.

Biden/Harris are not trying to make the US a socialist society, however Trump is trying to be a dictator and you are falling right in step with it...
Covid19 is a perfect analogy for American politics. Trump is the virus, and Biden is a mask. The mask is uncomfortable, and you're not happy you have to wear it, but you understand that if you don't it will literally cost lives so you wear it, because it's the right thing to do.
Does anybody else ever feel personally attacked by Trump? Because he's going after social security and affordable housing, and my medical care, and my LGBTQ community and my vagina. Then all these privileged white guys on my feed take a "never Biden" stance that could kill me.

Are you talking about Alabama‚Äôs Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General that was confirmed in the senate by republicans only? Betsy DeVos? Trump? Biden has progressed from his stances from 40 years ago while republicans senators and the current president and staff still support it?!
Even Biden?
No.  And Warren would be forced to betray her progressive beliefs to enforce Biden/ Harris Wallstreet agenda.
I'm in a, Blue State where Right-Leaning Wallstreet Dems Biden/ Harris don't even bother to campaign.  They don't care about us because they call the elections before including our electoral votes. They don't give a damn about progressives. So they won't miss it when I don't vote
I feel like Biden picked Harris just to add diversity.
No.  I would have been okay with Karen Bass too.  She has progressive cred.  But Progressives are being denied representation in any power seat.  Right-Leaning Dems like Biden/ Harris take us for granted. Don't even campaign in my blue state. My vote doesn't matter to them.
I lived through Reagan years.  Biden is damn close to a Reaganite
She jumps on the bandwagon after she thinks it will get her points.  Her campaign was Right-Leaning which is why Biden picked her and Wallstreet is celebrating.
Biden and Harris would have been considered Reagan Dems in the 80s. They've moved the "center" way to the Right.  Wallstreet is celebrating.    I'm in a Blue state so they won't miss me not voting for Pres.  They don't even campaign here.
Still not going to support them.  My state is Blue. Progressives are the only ones that listen to us.  Biden &amp; Harris don't represent Progressives.  So they won't miss my vote.  I'm voting down ballot but will vote None on President/VP
They don't even campaign here because Washington is a reliably Blue state.  The only ones who have cared are Progressives.  Biden &amp; Harris don't care about our votes.  So why bother when my vote won't matter.
First off,  they're to the right of most Dems.    But... here's the only selling point necessary  Biden/ Harris aren't Fascists like Trump/ Pence
I'm not a Bernie fan.  Biden could have united the party by picking Warren.  Instead her picked a Wallstreet,  Right-Leaning,  "Law&amp;Order " cop
Cool. You didn‚Äôt even bring one single rational reason to the thread for your prejudices towards Biden and your unequivocal support for Trump. Your commentary was completely full of hypocritical bipartisan hacks. The fact you cant even promote a single rational reason says It all
Your point? That you hold Biden to a much higher standard than you do with Trump and Republicans? There‚Äôs video of Trump lying about cheating on his wife and wishing child self traffickers well. Your political hack jobs are a disgrace to free speech and the american way.
It was over 40 years ago. Again, why endorse republicans who have/had the same opinion yet attack Biden for it? Cause you and others with the same sentiment have no moral compass at all. You are not a patriot. Patriots don‚Äôt use their freedom to promote hypocrisy. Despicable.
Why do you care about what Biden did 45 years ago? Republicans were the masterminds behind segregation laws and DeVos and Trump are trying to bring it back yet you use It as a talking point to attack Biden? You have no moral compass. Is this how we make America great again?
Your partisan hacks here are anti-American and unpatriotic reasons for  bigotry. If you‚Äôre going to try to use talking points to discredit Biden don‚Äôt use ones that overly discredit Trump too. Make them at least rational. How do you only have hypocritical talking points?
That Trump is exponentially more of a racist than Biden. True. Yet you‚Äôre still voting for Trump? Thanks for clarifying your rationale behind your support for Potus 45. Trying to argue not to support Biden cause he‚Äôs racist when Trump is quantifiablly more racist is unpatriotic.
It‚Äôs pathetic that supporters of Trump even try to bring up the race card when attempting to discredit Biden. How patriotic and American. Way to Make America Great Again. One hypocritical and biased opinion after another to justify your prejudices and ignorance.
Racist you say? When did Biden take out multiple newspaper ads calling for the death of black teenagers that didn‚Äôt even commit a crime and then refuse to apologize or admit wrongdoing when it was proven they were innocent? He didn‚Äôt? Who did? Trump you say?! What a rarionale.
Q: Have you sent this same tweet to Biden? If not, why?
And now we're really pissed off.  We'll vote out the fascist,  but are not going to support the Corporate Right-Leaning Biden/ Harris Admin when they're in office.
She doesn't even respect Biden. She must be drunk on power. Where is her personal integrity. Oh, maybe she doesn't have any.i
Yeah.  Warren was gracious,  letting Biden take credit of her plans revised for COVIDtimes.  Biden used them to get support.   And has now clearly signaled with Harris as VP nom,  that he will NOT be working towards them at all.  They both would have been Republicans 40 yes ago
So what if Biden intentionally chose a woman. Do you feel threatened by that?
No they won't because we're being denied representation at the table. We have to choose Biden for less abuse but it's still Wallstreet Right-Leaning abusive policies.
More than half of the Democratic Party is being denied a power seat to represent us.  This is nothing short of major regressive move for the Dem party even if we are required to vote for Biden to get rid of Fascists.  It's still a hostage transfer situation to just less abuse
Does NOT mean I support Biden/ Harris in ANY way except to get Trump out then throw them out in 2024!
We have nothing to vote FOR , only AGAINST.  That's all because we're being denied representation in the seats of power.  So we vote AGAINST Trump Fascism by being forced to vote for Biden/ Harris Right- Leaning Wallstreet regressive ticket.
One of my fb friends is all mad. She‚Äôs big mad! But claims she‚Äôll vote for Biden anyway.  She‚Äôs railing about KH because of Bernie blah blah blah...
Didn't Trump just say yesterday the pandemic of 1917 (1918) ended the second world war. Yeah, he did. So at this point which old guy do you trust more? My money is on Biden. Cause Trump is Putins puppet.
Wait...was Joe Biden not vice president to president Obama for 8 years?

Agreed, Biden Harris for an honest America.

Yeah.  Warren/AOC 2024 and AOC 2028. If we survive the right- leaning Biden-Harris years.  But as older working poor with disabilities,  I'm going to be screwed for 4 more years either way.
Well,  I won't vote for Harris in 2024 unless the only alternative is another Fascist.  That's the only reason to vote for Biden/ Harris if you're a progressive.  I want more representation than "At least we're not Fascists. "
10% unemployed, 165000 Dead from the virus that will just go away. Who needs your promises? Biden Harris to govern.
It hasnt happened in 4 years, but we *can* actually hold politicians accountable for their bullshit while in office. That is a thing we can normally do.  I just hope Biden's actually ready for the broke, sick, angry, radicalized nation he's about to inherit.
The electoral college says otherwise. I'm voting Jo Jorgensen, but in my state I'm sure Biden will win, so it doesn't really matter who I vote for. But at least I voted for the person I think would do the best job.
We'll vote for Biden,  because we have been FORCED to become One- Issue voters since we now have zero representation on the ticket.  Our only issue is voting Trump out. You can't make it into any kind of good, though. Because the Right-leaning Dem ticket betrays working poor.
Like the single issue voters voting to get Trump out? Because Biden Harris is crap for representing me.  The only reason they get my vote is because the alternative is Fascism.  I may puke voting for them, but I'll do it. Even knowing that they have it out to destroy Progressives
They will never fix it.  They are Wallstreet darlings.  That's why Wallstreet is celebrating Biden picking Harris.  Progressives have been betrayed again.
I didn‚Äôt say Biden wants to kill it. Their party is moving that way. Look at their up and comers.  says he loves capitalism all the time. I‚Äôm just pointing out the insanity of voting for bigger government instead of smaller. Trump needs to go. But not to these two.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden as a stop gap. But  we should all buy ARs.
Also,  remember Cabinet members are usually a short term career ending job.  She wouldn't go back to the Senate.  None of her policies would be implemented.  Except for the ones Biden &amp; Harris have stolen to pad their lack &amp; pretend they will work for ordinary Americans.

Warren needs a power seat,  not one where she's forced to implement the anti-progressive policies of a right- leaning Wallstreet Biden/Harris Admin.  Unfortunately, Biden has ruled her out for SCOTUS because she isn't Black. And Senate Dems won't make her their leader.

Did Joe Biden take out newspaper ads to wrongfully convict black teens of murder and refuse to apologize or admit wrongdoing when they were finally exonerated and freed? Didn‚Äôt think so. Who did? Oh, yeah. That was Trump
I‚Äôm confused. You claim you‚Äôre tough on crime and all this video does is claim Biden is too. How does this make you look good exactly? If anything, It makes him appeal to more conservative voters. Are you conceding already? It will save lives if you do.
Kamala worked with Joe Biden's son, Beau. He has a soft spot for her.
Except Biden/ Harris is a Wallstreet,  Right-Leaning, "Law &amp; Order " ticket that only pays lip- service to progressive causes.  Their slogan may as well be "We're Not Fascists Like The Other Side", because that's the only thing getting them elected.
Biden proved today that he does not support working poor Americans. We'll vote for him instead of Fascism,  but he won't be making any progressive changes like we need.
Don't lecture me.  I know better than you having lived through it.  There were excellent choices to move in a progressive direction at a time when it would be supported because of Trump and COVID.  Instead Biden picked Wallstreet "Law &amp; Order" after stealing Warren's work.
Unless Schumer quits and manages to appoint her to Dem Senate Leader--OR--Biden recinds his requirement for SCOTUS nominees to be Black,  there's no adequate position that she should accept.  Everything else is just being a mouthpiece forced to promote someone else's policies
I wish I could of seen Joe Biden‚Äôs reaction when they told him who his running partner was ü§£
People like WALLSTREET who are celebrating getting their right- leaning corporate Dem ticket?  Only reason there's any progressive support is bc alternative is fascism. It's only lip-service/won't enact ANYTHING progressive. Biden has signaled no seat for Progressives at table
I am so excited to vote for you and Joe Biden. I will never forget talking with you about gun violence prevention in Des Moines. You will be a force for good in our country! #BidenHarris2020
Biden would have never picked Kamala if Fentanyl Floyd never died
We will never get Warren as Dem Senate Majority/ Minority Leader. Schumer won't step down &amp; Corporate, Blue Dog,  Law &amp; Order Dems like Harris would never vote for her to be.   Biden rejected her for SCOTUS because she isn't Black.  There are no more power seats for Progressives
If she were in the Cabinet,  she would be forced to enact the regressive right- leaning policies of Biden/ Harris.  Only a mouthpiece lackey without the power to make progressive change.  It's a short term crap. Career ending job.
I am kinda "meh" about the Kamala Harris VP pick. This has been the rumor for the last few months. I will vote for Biden but only because the alternative is far worse.
I hope you don't blame God for not answering your prayer when Biden and Harris take office in January.
are democrats who are saying they‚Äôre going to refuse to vote for biden/harris really fine with trump winning again???
I said I would vote for the lesser evil.  That doesn't mean I will support the evil.  I'm voting AGAINST Trump. Not because I like or support a Biden Harris agenda.
She would be forced to run BIDEN'S Treasury, not hers.  Not progressive
Celebrating Biden/Harris 2020
If biden wins we should prepare for our first female president cause biden would not be able to finish the term the way he is going mentally.
Tell it to Biden who has denied Progressives representation.
No.  We're not.  I'll vote Biden/ Harris,  but I will not support their regressive agenda that denies Progressives a seat in one of the power positions.
Warren was SHUNNED by people like Biden who refused to support her for heading the CFPB even though she created it!!!!
And all of that is driven by POTUS, VP, SENATE Leaders,  etc.  Cabinet just are mouth pieces to do the work.  Warren would be blocked from making Progressive changes by Biden and Harris.    This is a bullshit move and Progressives won't forget it.
My advice is once Biden is in, we all should start a movement aimed at kicking out the chair from under the Corporate Democrats. First order of business: Ranked Choice Voting in all 50 States. Second order of business (can be concurrent): Find and run actual leftist candidates.
No.  POTUS. VP. Senate Dems Leader. House Dems Leader. SCOTUS.   Those are the positions with power. Biden has already ruled EW out of SCOTUS because she isn't Black.  The others are not open or up to him. They won't happen.  So,  yeah.  The Progressive Wing is betrayed again.
More people are excited about Kamala Harris than Joe Biden. Which is so funny because yall didn't support her months ago when she could've been the front.
I'm voting Against Trump.  It just so happens that means I have to vote for Biden/Harris.  I will NOT "support" them though. Progressives and Elizabeth Warren deserves seat at table of power. Anything less than Senate Dem leader or SCOTUS is an insult. We know those won't happen

Yeah.  Great motivating.  "Vote Biden/ Harris! We're Against Progressives,  But At Least We're Not Trump/Pence"  I hate the Dem party right now.  Just not quite as much as I hate the GOP.
Wrong guy. Joe Biden is somebody who rides a bicycle.
I‚Äôm not fond of Biden at all really and I was already planning to vote for him because Trump is a fucking disaster &amp; needs to go. BUT! Knowing Kamala  Harris will be kicking his butt through a presidency wins it for me. üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
The Biden-Harris ticket is like the movie AIR FORCE ONE, but better. :)
Just heard Joe Biden ask when he'll be able to pick his VP running mate.
you damn well her and Joe Biden are 1,000,000 times better than your pathetic traitor self and your little pee on Pence Nov 3 YOU ARE FIRED YOU SOB
We won't forget the insult.  We won't forget that Biden Admin doesn't really give a damn about us.  We will vote Trump out,  but we're not on the same "Biden/Harris" divisive team continuing the right-leaning Dem BS.
This long list is precisely why I think  shit the bed. When these facts get used by Trump, the entire Biden campaign is fucked. Susan Rice was the safer option. Why pass her over?!
Picking Sen. Kamala Harris after her speaks volumes on Joe Biden's character/judgement.  He DNW a sycophant lap dog(Pence), he want's his own "Joe Biden." A trusted, competent partner that helps get shit done. With a Trans Am. She should get one.
This!!   We've had our donations taken, our goodwill abused,  our Candidate's work stolen. And now we've been one again denied a place at the table.   We'll vote Biden 2020, but we are NOT on the same team.
Hot Take: Would've been better if  had  replace William Barr instead of being the VP.  This is white, and fucked up as hell. I'm fully expecting things to be the same under Biden as they were under Trump, because clearly both of them have lost their marbles.
We get more of this with Trump. I don‚Äôt think any reasonable person is arguing against that, and I wasn‚Äôt either  However, the tyranny of the oligarchy remains unchallenged under a Biden presidency and that‚Äôs a fact  It‚Äôs the reason they knifed Bernie ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Or Biden dropping and we have a Michelle Obama - Kamala Harris ticket?
So it will be Michelle Obama and Kamala, with Biden dropping out?
Yeah,  because Biden and Harris will NOT be fighting for us after election day.   Right now the best that can be said of Biden/Harris is "They aren't Trump/Pence"
The only thing great that is going to be going on in the WhiteHouse is you leaving so that President Biden and Vice President Harris can come in and clean up your mess.
Joe Biden picked a narc right in the middle of an anti-cop eraüòÇ I‚Äôm üíÄ
Crap job.  She needs to be in a Power Seat.  Not stuck to the side.  Only Senate Dem leader would be a suitable position. Or SCOTUS. Schumer won't step aside &amp; she isn't Black so Biden has said he won't appoint her.
What is the over/under on how many days till Hidin Biden resigns and Kamala takes the nomination?
In a minor role of anything. Unless she is on SCOTUS (which she has already been excluded from nom by Biden because she isn't Black) or Senate Majority/ Minority Leader,  which we know won't happen, then this is an insult to the progressive base that has fought &amp; fundraised.
It's reprehensible that Elizabeth Warren once again did all the work only to be shunned by a Biden containing ticket/admin. Warren is smarter than Biden and Harris combined.   I'll vote Biden 2020, but no support past that.
How does one simply vote for joe Biden and go to sleep at night? Oof
#BidenHarris2020 Go team Biden!
Will still vote Biden 2020, but no support after that and no more donations from me either.
Join me in supporting Biden Victory Fund viaSo... not cool with Biden either? Or are sexual assaults only valid if they‚Äôre performed by the red?
ü§£ü§£ So you want the country to be run by ‚Äúnasty.‚Äù Wow. At least you‚Äôre honest about your lack of integrity. Just curious... why is it okay for Biden to slip by with 8 accusers and a voting record more racist than a clan member‚Äôs?
Lol as you back a guy who has been accused 8 times (Biden), and was told by Harris herself that he was a racist and that his accuser should be believed. Nice deflection though - victims only matter if bloo says so.
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
She won‚Äôt have time, she‚Äôll be too busy backpedaling on how she called Biden a racist rapist. Funny how you are cool with believing it as long as it fits inside your little echo chamber üôÑ
So you believe Biden is as well? ‚ÄòCause she did the same to him... or does yours and Harris‚Äô integrity hang out in the sewer together?
Curious where you dropped your integrity... she called out Biden, too, you going to keep backing her up now? I‚Äôll wait...
Lol then she called out Biden but you want him to be president, WITH her ü§£ü§£ zero integrity
Pretty sure this can be Joe Biden's Day 1 plan.
I would f*ching walk on my swollen legs and Neuropathy ridden feet to hand deliver my ballot for Biden/Harris in November. Fuck Trump and the complicit GOP. ALL OF YOU! #USPS #USPSsabotage #VoteBlue #BidenHarris2020
What they WANT is JUST enough voters for BIDEN to SQUEAK By.  No more AOCSs.
And the Democrats have COWARDLY  marched to the RIGHT because they  just ASCENT to most of the suppresion   they don't ACTUALLY Want a VAST POOL of new voters because they KNOW new voters are NOT in love with Biden.
So here is the thing about Biden vs Trump.  In the short term, we might not get arrested under a Biden admin but within a year or two, Biden will be showing its facist head.  So vs Trump being already at the same point.
Biden is a fascist too.  Really the US government both the democrats and republicans have been part of a fascist government since the beginging of time.
Well if someone wants Biden's DNA and he fights it I'll be the first to get on his case....
Hopefully there's a straightforward way to get rid of this DeJoy douchebag if Biden wins and Dems take the Senate. This postal board thing seems like it might be a problem.
The future of the Dems is Tulsi Gabbard. Biden should have picked her. #UnityCandidate #sarcasm #noIwasnotkidnappeditsajoke
would him endorsing biden mean anything? i think it might.
The Republicans will be radicalizing people to the right during Biden because most people will think Biden is left and that is something which Vaush misunderstands and all.
Uhhhhh. President Biden, actually.
Nice, but I think he should have to trade a couple packs of cigarettes before he gets to watch coverage of Biden &amp;  Harris as they receive the Nobel Prize for defeating his corrupt keister.
I‚Äôm confused on that viral Kamala/Biden moment. She‚Äôs pro bussing? üôÉ
Yes. Biden and Harris are pretty yikes but Trump is even more yikes.
Seeing the news about the NY police union endorsing Trump made me remember that the International Association of Fire Fighters has endorsed Biden.  Once again we get to see who is on the side of the community.
Joe Biden is embarrassing to even watch.
How dare you imply that we aren't doing enough by voting for Joe Biden. How dare you imply any existence of weakness within the democratic party. Jed Bartlet is turning in his grave, sir.
Democratic Socialists get off their asses and form a 3rd party? Surely you jest. You'll just snipe at Biden, Harris, Pelosi, etc. That vile social media behavior won Bernie 5 whole states in 2020. You're the kiss of death.
Joe Biden:  "wowee zowee, will you look at that! It's looneytunes!"  Elizabeth Warren: "I demand the Inspector General of the post office investigate DeJoy"  IG of the PO : "ok, I'm investigating"  One person here actually gets shit done. And sadly it's not our Pres nominee .
That‚Äôs my observation as well.  Though must I sadly report the first Biden sign in my neighborhood appeared in the last couple weeks.  There seems to (rightly) be zero enthusiasm for the guy. Seen several BLM and anti-Trump signs though.
So are you, why aren't you phonebanking for Biden right now? Every call you don't make for Biden is a call for Trump
Thought the great one was not drawing a salary? He can't keep his shit straight. Getting nervous and showing vulnerability. Biden-Harris team have him off balance. #TrumpHasNoPlan
Ok so we can agree via transcript he totally condemned white supremacists, check, we have the shithole countries comment from "sources", cool, and then we literally watch cities burn on tv for months but biden said "hey man, dont do that" (probably doesnt remember though).

While you were settling for Biden, i studied the labor theory of value
‚ÄòS all good. It is hard to target messaging that much on what is by default a public platform, but I try to aim ‚Äúcriticize Biden to try to extract better talking points from him‚Äù at his supporters, and ‚ÄúTrump sucks, let‚Äôs get rid of him
Thank you, I think you‚Äôre very thoughtful as well. I‚Äôd like to be able to influence more non-voters toward voting for Biden / unseating Trump. I have to believe at least somewhat in what I‚Äôm saying though. I think Tlaib‚Äôs approach is a good one.
Biden‚Äôs digital team are some of the best in the business, I just cant comprehend ‚Äúhire comedians to write your emails‚Äù
If Clinton showed anything it‚Äôs that promising M4A doesn‚Äôt mean you have to actually do it; it costs almost nothing to merely point out the flaws in the health insurance system. That Biden won‚Äôt even pretend he‚Äôs interested in fixing health care during a pandemic is disappointing
This is true. Which is why we have to take a hard stand. If Trump losing is more important to the Democrats than Biden winning then they can come over to our side. We tried supporting their side and it got us and them nowhere.
What will move me is Biden or his reps publicly acknowledging and apologizing for past mistakes, and communicating their new position on those issues. It‚Äôs worked well enough on Harris in the past.
Why would we expect Joe fucking Biden to roll back the clock on American fascism when he already had the goddamn opportunity with a more progressive partner than Kamala Harris.
P.s. I'm voting Down ticket  blue but am not likely voting for Biden. I don't have a dog in this fight.  But I know Soccer moms better than trump.
BTW My $5 bet says Suburbanite Soccer moms Break in the direction of Biden simply because they're concerned the  white house is xenophobic homophobic racist and a number of other forms of bigotry they'd rather not be taught to their kids.
And what did the white house do? Instead of disassembling it and putting the 90s government back together, they sent in Joe fucking Biden, who cut costs then called it a victory.
Then ask it of EVERY politician and start with Joe Biden.
It IS facing something new. I don't recall Joe Biden installing a crony corrupt postmaster general to slow down the USPS, cut overtime, sack the exec board, and scrap mail sorting machines. Each machine costs $1+ mil, so hardly a cost saving measure, ridiculous as that reason is.
The suburbanite housewife is more worried about the lessons the xenophobic clown in the white house is sending to her kids,  I know soccer moms better than trump does.  she's probably voting Biden. I don't have a problem with her. I'm actually shocked as a pretty left wing punk
The ENTIRE BIDEN FAMILY got filthy rich shamelessly using Joe's political connections. Americans are fed up.
‚ÄúThe ‚Äòsuburban housewife‚Äô will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge!‚Äù
Unfortunately, you‚Äôre right. There are people who can say something to sway me, but those people are Biden and Harris. I‚Äôll be watching the debates closely, plus any press release their campaign puts out. I honestly want an excuse to be bad at leftism and vote ‚Äúblue‚Äù again.
‚ÄúHer agenda might not sound sufficiently ambitious in Northern California but it could very easily play differently in Michigan and Wisconsin,‚Äù Schnur said, naming two swing states narrowly clinched by Trump in 2016 but that Biden now leads in the polls.
During her unsuccessful presidential campaign, Harris attacked Biden for failing to support an overhaul of the nation‚Äôs health care system, but he slammed her for attempting to ‚Äúhave it every which way.‚Äù With Biden at the top of the ticket, Harris will have to move from
Harris said she was proud to join Biden and blamed Trump for mismanaging the coronavirus and the economy.  ‚ÄúWe need a mandate that proves that the past few years do not represent who we are or who we aspire to be,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúJoe likes to say that character is on the ballot.
If you're not chomping at the bit to vote for Biden/Harris, I don't think there's much I can say to sway you. I understand the down-ballot arg, but it pales, in my mind, in the face of this fundamental threat. ymmv
On Wednesday, Biden formally introduced Harris as his running mate in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, praising her for going after the gun lobby and oil industry and saying he wanted her ‚Äúto be the last voice in the room‚Äù when he makes his toughest decisions.
Almost immediately after Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris as his pick for vice president, the Trump campaign and his acolytes began casting the California senator as a ‚Äúfar-left radical‚Äù set on transforming the U.S. into a socialist‚Äôs dream
So that gives Biden/Harris even less time than they already have to communicate a platform I‚Äôd be able to vote for. Yet another super gross and manipulative move by Trump and his goons.
worry less about biden and more about me I am the extremist and  I am prepared to vote my values for the first time.
as a Radical leftist I renounce Biden and Harris. #politics #political #Republicans
I have no problem being made into the Democrats Armor  in that  respect. Biden isn't one of us Radical leftist.

Biden promised to cure cancer to a crowded room. He told another that "not a single solitary scientist think Bernies plan will work". If you think Biden plans on following through on his climate change plan then let me tell you about how he's going to cure cancer in 4 years.
4th rate editing job.  Wasted a minute of my time and I'm not voting for Biden.
Congratulations, I'm so excited &amp; happy about your running as Vice President. I believe Joe Biden is one of the most honest people in Washington. Also, I believe that he is surrounding himself with capable, educated, &amp; honest individuals. All the Best, Deb Churchill
When I heard that masking comment from Biden, my first thought was...control over the people and here we go again.  Sick bastards.
Vote for Biden and talk to all of your reformed (almost) MAGA people. We must blow Trumpkut of the water in November. Live you
If you live in Washington state and vote for Biden, you're not participating in "harm reduction", you're just endorsing his right wing policies.
If true Biden wins in a walk, even with rigging. When non-Republicans and non-conservatives vote good things will flow.
Yes, we all have to vote for Biden this time around because we are held hostage. It doesn‚Äôt mean we have to be happy about it, or ignore that other things need to be done to fix it so we‚Äôre not held hostage next time. Don‚Äôt be so single minded you‚Äôre willing to ignore the future
Why won't Biden, or any Left Wing leader, denounce Antifa? One of these two movements is terrorizing residential neighborhoods in my city on a nightly basis.
I feel like I have no meaningful way to express my  real values in our political process...  It's not me throwing a fit because my guy didn't win it's realizing me and Biden are worlds apart. #politics #political  #democrat #democrats #liberal #liberals and just being unwilling
Great interview. I especially appreciate his answers to questions about how a Biden presidency will help Wisconsin.
We do. I just hope Biden won‚Äôt take us down ‚ÄòFord road‚Äô. We can‚Äôt afford that.
Don't talk to cops... Or our worthless lying mayor. Maybe stick around at a protest long enough to get gassed next time, and not just show up for the Instagram selfies. The only students that still like you at the end of the year are the proud boys &amp; Biden lovers.
I still have a hard time imagining the military would officially back a Trump coup, if only because he's been consistently personally shitty to them and Biden is a conventional warmonger. There are benefits to the status quo.  That doesn't mean the rank and file would follow tho.
If you're genuinely so terrified of trump blame yourselves for voting biden in.
I can't stand her based on all the seriously fk'd stuff she has done over the years in California but this meme made me have a good chuckle.  I guess my issues with her are similar to why I can't stand Biden due to all the crap he did while a Senator in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Why aren‚Äôt the Mountain Goats writing Biden‚Äôs car commercials?
Postal union endorses Biden candidacy as 'survival' of USPS at stake.

to fucking switch  your Vote from Biden to Bernie.... #howiehawkins2020
Russians are creating fake ANTIFA web pages and linking them to Joe Biden 2020; Trump is openly trying to suppress voting; 1 out of 4 tests in Texas are positive thanks to GOP leadership; on and on‚Äîand this is on you GOPranos. You are enemies of democracy.
You üëèüèª need üëèüèª to üëèüèª vote üëèüèª Biden üëèüèªüëèüèª
National organized labor works for the DNC. You think Perez/Biden/Pelosi want a general strike? No, they don‚Äôt. It has to come from the bottom up. Pick a walk-out date and spread that shit like wildfire and we‚Äôll see what happens. Waiting for leaders is what losers do.
Bill Clinton didn‚Äôt really deliver on that, but he promised to try. Biden promises *not* to try. It‚Äôs frankly ridiculous that people keep trying to paint Biden as an FDR-like progressive when only Sanders‚Äô platform was even close.
Yes, progressives are well aware of the back to brunch crowd, and that's one of the biggest dangers of a Biden presidency, people who hear Democrats say shit like this and don't push back.
Biden should base his campaign around being a wife guy
If China hacks Trump and sends advance notification of when the releases will be so that Biden can plan his strategy around them and he doesn't tell the DOJ so they can investigate the cyber-attack, then yes, that would be corrupt of Biden.
I said some very similar things when I took an Instagram survey for Biden. Hopefully this sort of thing gets the message through to them, that they fucked up if they wanted the progressive vote.
?  Biden would have won comfortably.
*Suppression of the vote  *Incitement of the virus  *Disenfranchisement of poor people and people of color  *Destruction of the environment and bullying a minor (Greta Thunberg) *Promoter of Qanon conspiracy theories   Biden/Harris  for Truth
Joe Biden is racist and picked his vp running mate solely on her race. Again, he is showing the world he is racist.
This is an election of apathy. People are voting for Biden, because they have to, with little to no enthusiasm. This will not fare well with undecided voters. I'm walking away from Democrats this time. I haven't decided to vote for Trump. But, I won't vote for Biden.
society as we know it, you just get a possible chance to avert that eventuality in 4 years, instead of 12 with Trump rather than Biden / Harris.
So happy 4  right now - can‚Äôt wait for  to fire up this fall ‚ÄúJoe Biden had the audacity to choose a black woman to be his running mate - and ya know who that black woman is - itttt‚Äôs meeeeee‚Äù that was a Kamala open w/ an Oprah slide at the end.
Reason enough to vote for Biden/Harris. We have such a short time for action on climate change before passing the point of no return.
Count me as one who will settle for Biden.
I don‚Äôt think you need to shame them as much as explain that as flawed as Biden is, a vote for him is a vote against our actually fascist current president. (And everything Ian said.)
I was following this account... I don't follow liars.  Immediate #Unfollow
Barr should investigate Biden for creating the Wuhan virus. CNN reported Ukraine was involved. The only way to keep America great again is to make it great the first time around, reelect POTUS. #MAGA #KAGA #presidentialharrassment
uh? Joe Biden spend decades trying to defund social security.
Just like those pics conservatives are passing around with Biden consoling his grandkids at their father's funeral, and saying he's a predator?
That is why he picked  .  They are a perfect fit &amp; compliment each other.  BTW you are right behind Biden in age.  Look what you have done to our country.
We need a government that not only "listens to", but actually ACTS on science. We cannot afford to NOT have the #GreenNewDeal  Wake up Biden!
Very true, though which candidate will lead to more profitable profits is  something they very much consider.  I would expect Biden makes a good case for long game- definitely more stable than Great Orange Leader.  Stability is attractive to the insurance industry, generally.
So you got to keep more of your money and you‚Äôre whining about it?  Biden said he‚Äôs eliminating the Trump cuts and will raise taxes.
The left is going to be blamed regardless if Biden loses, just accept that now, that's what is going to happen, no amount of comity or ass kissing is going to change that.  There is however a lot of leverage in saying we could have won if these voters wanted to vote for us.
Than there is in rubber stamping a right wing Biden administration.   You're just both saying a lot of demonstrably untrue fabricated bullshit that is easily debunked with some cursory research.
Not everything that's corrupt is criminal. If Biden had done what he's accused of re: Hunter &amp; Burisma (he didn't, but still) it wouldn't have been a crime. Removing a corrupt prosecutor was in America / the West's interests.

Reason 9,000,000 I‚Äôm all I‚Äôm with Biden/Harris
Voting for Biden/Harris is jumping on the fast train to Socialism. Affordable  healthcare &amp; college for all means higher taxes for the working people. Nothing is free &amp; I know who will pay. I will be working &amp; getting less while someone else does less &amp; getting more.  #TRUMP2020
Not sure what the problem is... Chris Wallace won‚Äôt actually ask Biden a tough question
Reason enough to vote for Biden/Harris. Trump is doing worse than nothing. He is rolling back regulations.
After Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are sworn into office, we certainly will.
Lyin Biden is running on a "i am not Trump" platform no policies included....
There is no way Biden is winning short of a rigged electing.
They're only voting for Biden because they're basically comfortable...
Should the federal government require everyone to wear masks like Joe Biden wants?
He‚Äôs clearly talking about Biden. Hannity even quotes Biden a few times in that video lol poor attempt from the left
99.9 percent... The only Biden flag I've seen also had an American flag??? Head scratcher lol
Biden mostly seems to be unafraid to touch young women...
He doesn't, we just get to try again sooner than we do under Biden and Harris.
Good.  All the more reason I will be walking over broken glass if need be to vote for Biden and Harris.
VP: "Well I've got some red meat for you: We're not going to let Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris cut America's meat!"  Insert any one of a dozen jokes here that are totally obvious, probably juvenile, and yet still completely on point because‚Ä¶Pence.
Herman Cain's zombie Twitter account doesn't count.
NO, I am writing in Tulsi Gabbard. The DNC is corrupt and when you lose in November don't blame it on the voters, blame it on the corrupt people that control you and Biden. #NeverBidenNeverKamala #IStandWithTulsi #TulsiExposedKamala #TulsiGabbard
CNN should mention that time in 2010 when Joe Biden spoke at a Klansman‚Äôs funeral and called him a mentor and friend.
your "a new poll reinforces" is incorrect, I think- shouldn't Trump's be worse, not better? "Biden is viewed more positively than Clinton was, and Trump is viewed more positively than he was"
From the conclusion of your article.  "But Biden‚Äôs comments over time make clear that he has at least been willing to keep cuts to Social Security and Medicare as negotiating chips"
There is video of Biden proposing cuts to social security on the floor of the senate, for fucks sake.  You Blue MAGA people are just as bad as Trump, all fake news all the time, when it looks bad for your favs.  Just utterly useless Americans.
Kamala is much worse than Hillary in every aspect which is why the Biden campaign is looking like a big dummy.
It's disgusting how Biden shamelessly used his political connections to make himself and his entire family filthy rich.
As I said, I would be just fine with Trump hiring someone to speak with Ukrainians who had stories about hypothetical Biden corruption, sure.  The problem is that in this case, the "corruption" is being completely invented from whole cloth.
I didn't read that story before linking it, but if you are asserting that Obama did not try to cut social security, or that Biden has not tried to cut social security, you are lying.  Full stop.
Primary elections were held with in-person voting during a pandemic. Biden was given free corporate media coverage. Other candidates dropped out to endorse Biden just as other options had a chance. The voters did not choose Biden.
Nor will it change under Biden.
?  Trump literally can't run for two more terms, this is basic constitutional law.  And there will be no primary in 2024 if Biden wins, people pretending otherwise are lying to themselves.
Are you fact checking Biden also?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Sanders is one of the few decent people in politics, Biden and Harris certainly aren't.
If Joe Biden had corrupt business deals in Ukraine, I would be OK with Trump paying people to go talk to his business partners to learn about them, yes.   How do you not see the difference between a hostile gov't funded endeavor and private citizens?
I like Beto but come on dude! He shouldn't have endorsed Biden pre Super Tuesday, we knew they wouldn't help TX.
trump has been a hundred times more disrespectful to Biden than Harris could ever dream of being. Her calling Biden on bussing made perfect sense and I think showed him how tough and unafraid she is, which impressed him because he, unlike trump, respects women.
I will believe Biden has moved left when there is policy passed, and not a moment before.   And Favs knows that too, he just doesn't have a high opinion of his listeners intelligence.
They know since Biden‚Äôs the D ticket, their boats gonna float fine no matter who wins. Nothing special in it for any investment of time or $$
I think Vaush is realizing he is on the wrong side of the history here and is double downing on his points that Biden is the best way forward when he is obviously not.
Poll: Biden Expands Lead Over Trump; A Third Of Country Says It Won't Get Vaccinated, via
Biden said "Shoot them in the leg." The difference between that and "throw them in a van" isn't meaningfully different to those protesting police corruption.
Brinkmanship is, unfortunately, the best way I can see to advance it in 2020. I want Biden to worry about losing, not feel like he can coast on ‚Äúblue no matter who‚Äù loyalists pushing everyone to give up.
Where‚Äôs Rudy G? Hiding till October to pop Hunter Biden crazy shit.
Trump being worse doesn't make Biden not a conservative, and doesn't make what you're saying anything other than apologia.

Biden is more conservative than Eisenhower. You are saying we need to vote for him anyways. That is conservative apologia.
I can respect an election. We don't always get what we want, but I would feel better, if  - Biden would have actually won the primaries without a coup  - if the pick for VP would at least have some electoral backing, for example more delegates than

This is fascinating! One thing that rankles me a/b Biden is that his style only works for and among good ole (white) boys. I love that Obama and Hillary bonded over the way the rest of us have to approach work. ‚ô•Ô∏è
I get exactly what I deserve when I‚Äôm forced to watch Biden ads whilst viewing fishing videos on YouTube
I feel like I'm banging my head against a wall. I've been making this same argument all month now but I always get the same "But Biden isn't great!". Never an answer about how letting Trump win will make things easier. They just ignore it. I hate to call people Russian bots but..
None of this is fair.  1. The interview question implies that Harris didn't like Biden. Which isn't at all what she said at the time.  2. Now she's accused of lying and not taking politics seriously. Which is obviously wrong.  "You could have done better" is critique. Not hatred.
We definitely don't have enough time for the long game of electing Biden and Harris to run the party for the next 12 years that people in this thread are advocating for.
My Mom is a Biden supporter. Myself, I aligned more with Warren/Sanders.  Whenever we talked about the election during the Primary, we knew we were voting for WHOEVER ended up running against Trump.  It's Biden and I'm voting for Biden/Harris.   It's that simple. #NeverTrump
Both didn't win the primary. Biden got in there via coup and Harris was roundly rejected.  It's amazing, how 45% of the DEM electorate doesn't appear to matter at all and sabotaging our democratic process is just fine when convenient.
Biden/Harris platform. Needs more student loan forgiveness for public servants, but also for everyone, especially first generation scholars.
Please keep BIDEN and all the other walking corpse predators TF away from her.  Keep at least a two corpse, head to feet of course, distance from anyone of them at any time and this 18 year woman.
Good for you.  The 25% Biden difference is unaffected as my parents are Republicans voting for Biden.
Another item on the long list of reforms needed in the Biden/Harris era. We‚Äôve done this before and can do it again (progressive era, New Deal, post-Watergate, Church cmte, etc).
Judge Kenneth K. Lee Appointed byDonald Trump  Consuelo M. Callahan: Appointed by George W. Bush  Barbara M. G. Lynn (Voted against): Appointed by Bill Clinton  Republicans focusing on appointing judges for the last 4 years has worked. Dems better do the same if Biden wins.
Most of We the People will be voting for Joe Biden, we're tired of having a crook in the WH.
Vote Biden then call him out on his shit
I'm abstaining because I refuse to put my name forward for Kamala. I was gonna hold my nose and vote for Biden, but he fucked that wayyyy up

I have all sorts of issues with Biden, but it‚Äôs a little rich to hear critiques like this from the party of white supremacists
do you seriously think that people who voted against Hillary aren't going to vote against Biden too? I think Dems assume a way more shallow stupidity in Trump voters than is generally true. Most of them (in error, IMO, but sincerely) were voting against the broad establishment
You do realize identity theft is profitable and that voter fraud is not, don't you?  What's more likely, the people buying these IDs are running up debts .... or they are trying to vote twice because they're REALLY BIG Biden supporters?
When did politicians stop caring about rumor and innuendo??  It‚Äôs almost as if the  has just been suckering people in for 20 years with the goal of going balls to the walls now to usurp complete power. Even after Biden is in there‚Äôll be a hellu cleanup on aisle 9. F‚Äôsheesh
Absolutely no one who voted for Trump is going to vote for Biden instead
But if we can vote in Biden he'll be able to turn that around, right? All the more reason to vote for the man.
I aM So LeFTy, I supPorT BiDen FoR PrEsidEnt  ewwww...
Lol at the dude who thinks Biden can even remember his promises
What incentive does Biden have to back progressive policy? He has already rejected the baseline issue for us, #MedicareForAll
Pence can't pardon trump for crimes not already been indicted for and hasn't been tried for , there's a big list and it will stick .  Pence won't be anything in January , Biden will be president .
I‚Äôm starting to think ‚ÄòBernie or Bust‚Äô is just as ridiculous of a position as ‚ÄòRidin‚Äô with Biden‚Äô. Instead of placing all your hopes on one politician, you *could* examine our political system as a whole and realize it doesn‚Äôt matter who you vote for.  The electoral process..
Biden is a glass of milk. Not your first choice, but not too bad.  Trump is a glass of sewer water, bugs, and coronavirus.   The choice is YOURS.  #Biden2020 #DumpTrump
Citizens United isn‚Äôt abstract. It is concrete. Conservative Justices sided with the argument that limitless money in campaigns is free speech. Democrats want to legislate campaign finance reform &amp; Republican senate is blocking it. Want change? Vote for Biden
I will vote to elect you and Biden , and if trump became president and I lose my social security , I will fight him .
Imagine calling yourself a leftist while you bend yourself into a pretzel for Joe Biden of all people

Biden helped write the legislation that primarily caused this system to be as fucked up as it is. I honestly don't think he would be any better or worse than Trump. If we actually want change we have to work outside of this two party corruption feedback loop
I have theory, Kamala Harris was told to drop out early to keep her from sustaining any more collateral damage during the debates,they had her as the VP pick at that point,then got Bernie out, Biden would be easy to remove giving Kamala the Presidency at some point

The new Biden/Harris campaign ad shows Joe down on one knee. Apparently Commie'la is a great teacher. Joe looks ready to perform orally.
If Biden gets the vote of postal workers, that‚Äôs gonna be clutch.
Cool , we can put you in prison for tampering with the mailing system to help you win the election ,   Don't worry , we will vote for Biden and we'll drag your ass out kicking and screaming if you don't go willingly .  Have fun in prison punk .
Biden is up 25%
At 77, Biden still rides a bicycle for exercise &amp; keeps his weight down There's no dementia there but Trump is morbidly obese &amp; can barely walk his fat behind down a ramp &amp; can't put together a coherent sentence so guess where the dementia is.
If Biden tries to come for Portland's needle exchanges ill slingshot a rig full of HIV blood into his face Muntadhar al-Zaidi style
"regardless of whether or not you personally have been extorted into supporting Biden"
Twitter is an open forum, you post things, people get to reply.   Attacking people who are clearly vastly morally superior to the Democratic party, regardless of whether or not you personally have been extorted into supporting Biden is bad form, and bad for the Overton Window.
THE ONLY TIME I will let someone vaccinate me is when I see an F.D.A. approval on the vaccine &amp; when Joe Biden is in office. FULL STOP!
Still behind in my mind.  Biden will be behind until January when he takes the oath as far as I'm concerned.
the VERY Drug warriors I've been railing against for YEARS. and now I'm just supposed to I don't know abandon everything I've ever written about and vote Biden. I stand by it all. Ergo. Howie.
Wow, you mean they‚Äôre real people? Flawed and capable of short comings? Good lord what‚Äôs the world coming to? Fascinating read. And really stoked confidence in a potential Biden administration frankly. But ya, the Obama/Biden memes weren‚Äôt real life, oh well.
It's disgusting how Biden and his entire family got filthy rich by shamelessly using his political connections.

Joe Biden Accused Of "Enforcing Sharia Law"  Watch:    #NotMeUs
Please give us one issue on which Biden has been our ally and not a major roadblock.
..as though the only defining characteristic of blackness is how ‚ÄúPOCs‚Äù are treated by the police. I personally have no issue in voting for Biden/Harris because I understand politics. What I do have issues with is the erasure of blackness as a defined people with a defined cause.
You can't be in America you must mean duh trump that is destroying America and great minds like biden's are not talkers they do things for our country trump only destroys so he can win plus he cheats and lies on all things
Maybe not, particularly with Biden/Harris. But Dems usually benefit from higher voter turnout (why GOP works so hard to supress votes) and who knows how many of those people were victims of The New Jim Crow
All the more reason to vote for Biden/Harris.
The thing I‚Äôm most looking forward to about the Biden Harris presidency is not being outraged constantly
But y'all were so ready to called #Harris a non-Black radical leftist fascist cop, and #Biden a sleepwalking dementia addled dithering r****t.
My wife just got notified her "good" employee sponsored insurance plan is leaving her with a $1024 bill for going to the emergency room for, long story, but basically a 2 minute visit.  F*ck Mainstream Media, F*ck Biden, F*ck Kamala, F*ck Trump &amp; F*ck the DNC
Not a peep from leftists and our mailboxes being taken out; but plenty of sh*t to say about Biden and Harris.
Trump's answer to that question is hell no he doesn't regret lying or cheating on his wife his taxes the election or Americans he's such a scumbag  can't wait till Biden and Harris win this election trump trust cheating always that's what crimminals do
Biden will drop out before or shortly after the midterms in 2022 and there will be no primary in 2024.  The Democratic party does not support primaries of incumbent Presidents, and even if there were, the last two elections should show you how hard taking down Harris will be.
It's for these reasons That I can't bear to continue down this road and continue to vote against my own values. Biden doesn't speak for me and when I told him don't put her up he didn't even reply.
Oh, and the Biden campaign was lying about CDC recommendations until early April, it would be great if we had a candidate that actually gave a shit about science, but we don't.
We got PLAYED! Joe Biden policies are that of the same as Trump! #VoteThemOut!
Biden's "plans" are sheepherding bullshit and worth less than the electrons used to transmit them.  He probably can't even speak extemporaneously about them.
that moment in history.   We likely get someone like AOC in 2024 with Trump still in office, with a Biden Harris win we know we are getting Harris in 2024, and in 2028 assuming she wins 2024.
Also, read that article, Biden isn't in fact promising to go back to that approach, that was sarcasm, he is saying he won't get rid of the sanctions that violated our side of the terms in the Iranian deal, ie: he plans to continue Trump era foreign policy towards Iran.
I don‚Äôt think Amy threw her support behind Biden picking a WOC for pats on the head.
Joe Biden also sucks shit,so no
If Biden gets elected quarantine is legally over for 48 hours. Catch me in a sleeping bag at Bar Bar
i'm sure you've been ratio'd on this but you mean the cages biden and obama built and the scotus that biden personally enabled while humiliating anita hill?  you all let the left go in 2016 as well.
Trump is looking for any excuse not to debate Biden, so....... perhaps not the best negotiating device. Trump knows how poorly he'll do; how stupid he comes across (cuz he IS).
Good thing Biden is going back to that approach to Iran.
Stamp of approval:
I‚Äôll take this another step: Leftists shouldn‚Äôt see Biden‚Äôs victory as a ‚Äògood thing‚Äô for our movement.  He and Trump both have already wrought havoc on society, oppressing and attacking anyone who refuses to bend to the will of the State.  At this point, electoralism is dead..
Idk who need to hear this bu Biden isn't going to follow through on his climate change plan.. Joe Biden is the same candidate that promised to cure cancer if he was elected but said Sander's (not so radical) plan to address climate change wouldn't ever work.
And we already know that Biden supports regime change in Venezuela, a goal of the oil industry and the oil industry alone, and that he has no intentions of doing anything about fracking.
"that‚Äôs a whole lot of accelerated global warming tracing right back to America‚Äôs front door."  Now there's perhaps a debate to be had about whether or not this was intentional, and purely on the optics Biden and Obama were and are superior.  But all that really matters is tons

Usually I want October to go by as slowly as possible to savor every moment of the most wonderful time of the year, but now November simply cannot come soon enough.  Can't wait to cast my vote for Biden/Harris!
I don't know how much more clear it can be that everyone needs to vote FOR Biden-Harris, *and* get ready to mobilize in any way possible to get this guy out of office. He is incredibly dangerous.
Trump is objectively awful on the environment, no argument from me, but so is Biden, so again the only relevant question is when do you get to do something about it.  4 years is 4 years less than 8 and 8 years less than 12.
Trump still hasn't done as much damage to the environment as Obama and Biden did, mostly because Trump can't do the things they already did, like turning the US into the largest oil producer on the planet.
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ON THIS LIST WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION! Is your head up your ass for the warmth?? "Nothing will fundamentally change" they are the fucking same. Just screwing the worker and making the rich richer. God liberals are the worst
Of course it does and this is yet another item to repair once we flip the Senate as well as elect Biden.  If we're don't flip the Senate it'll be trouble.  So many wrongs and things to codify in laws.
Looks like Joe Biden is sniffing her. Can't wait for the convention.
But they say electing Biden would turn the US into a banana republic.   EVERY ACCUSATION IS AN ADMISSION WITH THESE BUFFOONS
Neither presidency is going to address climate change, which means the only relevant question for our young people's future is when do you get the next earliest chance to address climate change, with Trump it's 4 years, with Biden and Harris it's probably more than 12.
"WE ARE NOT GONNA LET JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS BEAT...OUR....MEAT!!!" (from stage right) "Sir! reduce! reee-duuuuce our meat!"
I sincerely love to see people online be like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt love Biden/Harris either but I‚Äôm voting strategically!‚Äù and the strategy is to capitulate with no demands, leverage, or resolve. 4D chess; very inspiring
you were a Yang supporter...he was not a socialist, that is more like Biden/Harris...confusing to me...You really aren't sure what you want or believe..but the BS talking points are so hollow. You had this country, move..why not be more happy instead of so bitter?
It's sooooo touching that Trump cares so much about how Joe Biden is treated well or not.
What are the plans for the future of the GOP? The POTUS can‚Äôt even answer that from his favorite newscast. What a TOTAL LET DOWN! Biden/Harris for 20/20! Save our democracy!
Not implying obviously that Harris is an ‚Äúevil‚Äù at all, but the article also ignores that Biden has been the presumptive nominee for a while and progressives have had time to adjust. Few seriously believed Biden would choose someone from the far left.
I'm curious how man missed social security checks will swing a senior from trump to biden
Get used to fighting. We will never not need to.  Trump wins? We'll have to fight every day. Trump loses? We'll have to fight every day. Forces have been coalescing to derail a Biden term.  We are never going back to the normal that some people still think we are operating in.
I'm pretty sure at least 633,108 people will vote for Biden and Harris this November.  #USPS
‚ÄúWe can hold them accountable‚Äù is what the dems say. What this actually translates to is ‚Äúshut the fuck up, vote for our guy‚Äù as Biden said at the outset of this campaign: ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù
Biden and Kamala: King and Queen of Mass incarceration.
You blocked Obama from putting oversight in at the post office for political reasons, after helping russia to help trump get electioned. Your brainwashed followers still believe lies about Democrats, Hillary, Biden, and Kamala and you have never denounced those lies
No. It takes an immense amount of cognitive dissonance to look at Trump then look at Biden and be like ‚Äúeh theyre pretty much the same‚Äù
We need to get back to being the party of the new deal and STOP CRIMINALIZING POVERTY amongst other things. OH and if you are a Woman shocked and horrified that this Feminist activist won't support Biden well just keep in mind that Clintons Welfare reform destroyed the very

So there's a chance we'll have two presidents back-to-back inspired at least in part by spite to show they can do better than Obama did?  Cool cool cool cool cool...
Vote Biden.  You won‚Äôt be as sorry as I hope you are now for voting for Trump.
if you're campaigning for the hearts and minds of older people who essentially think the republican parties ideas and agendas are just swell and they're morally upstanding then you'd use the Tactics Biden's using. But I'd rather lose than go with that shit.
Ironically, I support your POV at the federal level where I will hold my nose and vote for Biden. In PDX the mayor is merely a vote so yeah I‚Äôll assume the posture of the loyal opposition. Vigor.
If everyone votes blue and the Biden loses, the DNC can only think to go after GOP voters. That mean even more right leaning "left" candidates. THAT'S BAD CHANGE.   You only shift the overton window by pulling from the left.
I will definitely get vaccinated, but not with some Trumpian fly-by-night debacle. If they have one developed after Biden has been inaugurated...
Tuliscrats &amp; YangGang = Howlers DNC and GOP = The Society's Gold Houses Trump, Pence, Biden, Harris = Pixies
If Biden loses and the DNC see it as a failure to listen to the people who voted third party and next time they cater to them? THATS GOOD CHANGE. If enough vote third and the GOP &amp; DNC  lose power? THATS GOOD CHANGE.
Why would they support Joe Biden?
wait till you find out Biden was vp for 8 years and still let shit like joe arpaio's tent camp exist. don't worry about the ICE centers tho: you might get so angry you start calling for for the Kristallnacht
PENCE: The selection of California liberal Senator Kamala Harris as Joe Biden&amp;#039;s running mate simply confirms everything President Trump and I have been saying about Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.
There's Nothing more Pathetic than your Comment! Lemme guess, Voting for Biden is the way to go? Sorry, I want my rights left alone thank you
Third, Green and Bernie votes aren't siphoned Biden votes or anything. They're people who value different things and aren't being catered to by Biden or Trump. They aren't jerks, they're a statistic of how much your candidate failed.
This is wrong on so many levels. First, your vote doesn't matter in the way you think due to the electoral college. Second, Oregon is gonna be Biden, it doesn't matter how many more Biden votes there are than Trump ones, just that there are more.
First off, own what you did, and you have. Realize your choice is Trump or not trump rather than trump vs biden.
People aren't organizing a General Strike to help Biden, they're organizing one as an indictment of the entire system, letting the Democratic party co opt this idea is a terrible idea.

More spicy hot takes cuz I've seen this all over a lot of people I know's various profiles.   If someone doesn't vote for Biden, they aren't voting for Trump (well besides the ones that explicitly voted Trump but that's besides the point). Stop guilting people for it.
As evil as this bitch and Biden white ass is imma still vote for them smfh
Didn‚Äôt vote for Biden not supporting Biden! Period!
How many times.. That's Harris - Biden. Honestly, you might get people confused.
What isn't it. I agree with Cornel that she can't be trusted &amp; we have to be honest about her &amp; Biden even if they get our vote
Again, I don't think they're perfect, I'm not even a registered Green, I do think there is a lot more value in showing there is a block of voters that reject Blue No Matter Who than running up Biden's popular vote score for no reason.  If you get them to 5% they get federal

F.... Joe Biden,  he can wear a mask, but I'm NOT changing religions.
Not me! I was with Kamala from the start and when she dropped out I went to Biden. Seeing these two atop the ticket has had me celebrating and spending swag money like crazy! #BidenHarris2020

K Harris was not Born in the USA, according to what i learned in school she can not become President if Biden dies or becomes more senile, then the Speaker of the House becomes president
She denied hundreds of early releases to low level drug offenders because it would take away cheap (slavery) labor from California prisons‚Äîin fact, when Biden declared her VP, stocks in prisons went up!
I'm progressive. Biden and Harris are closet republicans.
I would take position in Joe Biden's White House. Most the time anyone would.Trump the only one i know that never filled his cabinet.Or had to put out ads to fill it.
This plus an earlier NYT article indicate Obama and team failed to really see who Biden is and his strengths, focused too much on superficial faults.  Leading of course to the world-historical disaster of picking HRC as 2016 nominee.
But just to be on the same page... Not voting for Trump, should not mean voting for Biden.  Right?  #NeverBiden #NeverTrump   #VoteJo
The other day  was going to the Biden campaign and vis versa!
But like my dad says, you can't put the shit back in the goose. I'm way too lazy to go through an unfollow them all. So if you could kindly just block me, I only care about anarchist and other far-left content, I'd rather eat shit than vote Biden.  That's all
Listen. If you're a dem or a blue wave or k hive or Biden lover, unfollow me. If I followed you first, honestly a couple years ago I took a bunch of adderal, set up this Twitter, and followed like a thousand democrat and environmentalist accounts. I regret every bit of it,
Video's and recordings to release under my sworn oath to the people of Oregon.  Will Biden or Trump save my family from corruption?  Hell no there not. Why not you both talk about our laws and freedom? Right! Here is a whistleblower &amp; witness with video and 20 full tapes of this
When did Biden say that? Do you have a link?
I'm a truck driver, white male. And I'm Biden all the way
so when she called out Biden on his segregationist past and retracted it as a JK moment that was change too right? i know it was an eternity ago (june) so records might be spotty.
Not ALL who voted for trump in 2016 are members of his cult. The cult loves him because he hates who they hate (people of color, liberals, strong women...). There is his cult and then there are people who were conned who we need to embrace because they will vote for Biden/Harris.

A Shapiroesque surrogate comes in and says ‚Äúlook at all the outspoken radical leftists voting for Biden though, doesn‚Äôt that prove he‚Äôs a commie?‚Äù.  Maybe the vote can be printed out with the following diagram:
I wish #Biden would have chose #StaceyAbrams instead. She's 10000% better than Kamala who is a cop #ACAB who put 1500 people in prison on petty cannabis charges. I'm only voting for #BidenHarris2020 because anything is better than trump. I would love to vote for Stacey!
Here is the text from this mornings campaign email:  "Kamala Harris is the meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful, MOST LIBERAL of anyone in the U.S. Senate, and I cannot believe that Joe Biden would pick her as his running mate."
That‚Äôs why, even with pandemic unemployment etc, I‚Äôm still worried about Biden/Harris. They‚Äôre selling ‚Äúreturn to normal‚Äù but has that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù been lost forever? It‚Äôs like trying to set a wet log on fire.
Rose emojis for Biden
In this house, we are whites with college degrees, Biden 100%
Biden has supported tough-on-crime policies for his entire political career. As a prosecutor, Harris enforced them.
Driving around Oregon you don't see much, if any Biden stuff. Plenty of Bernie, Hillary and Obama things still around though. I saw a UN flag in front of the house the other day and just shook my head in disbelief.
‚ÄúHi, i‚Äôm white. My life under Bernie, Biden, Trump, Mccain, Obama, Ben Carson and that cowboy guy that tried to run would be the same. But i refuse to vote for Biden because my principles tho. Kids in cages thats fine.‚Äù (There are bipocs that buy into the narrative too)
So the millions that lost their homes under Obama and Biden got chicken?   Blue checkmarks have lost the script.
Are you a doctor? Biden was VP,His job was to work with Obama. It was Obama not Biden call. Obama follow the doctor advice,Trump did not. Not all sickness are the same.This one getting worse as it evolves. It spread faster and not has hard to get now. It has gotten more deadly.
Right! Every minute you don't spend phone banking for Biden, you're phone banking for Trump!
I think a Biden admin would be fundamentally better for DEMOCRACY, for global alliances, for everyone. If you are having trouble reading tea leaves, read ON TYRANNY by Tim Snyder. 128 pgs that lays bare the direction which re-election would take us.
If Biden wins, you can kiss it all goodbye. I'm not expecting much, anyway. üôÑ
Nine out of 10 Democrats support Kamala. The Biden campaign raised $48 million in two days since her announcement. People are ready to win. Twitter is a bubble. Get real.
Feeling despair. Even though Trump is slowing down the mail to interfere, can Biden still win this election?
Me tooüòú
And after SC, Biden was never on the ropes against Sanders or Warren, etc.
In 2012, Dems could argue that Romney had shifted positions and become more ‚Äúseverely conservative‚Äù to win primary. But Biden never really catered to the left.
Oh, thanks.  Last week it was "Well, not voting for Biden is voting for Trump, but you do you, hun."  I just block them all no matter what their current voter suppression phrase is.
This is incredible! It sums up what makes her so bad. Either she didn‚Äôt mean what she said about Biden. Or she is working with someone who opposed her basic right to an education. either way, she won‚Äôt address the question.
Ill contribute the whole $3,400 to Biden/ Harris... thanks Mr Prez!
Too many people are just voting for "not Trump"   Biden could say he's pro holocaust and a vast majority of his supporters would support him over Trump
Clarify for me: So you won‚Äôt demonize a fellow catholic. But will happily demonize Joe Biden and all the democrats for being pro-choice?  Is that correct?
classic toxic cis white male exceptionalism.  folks, you really do hate to see it.  only way to offset this is by voting for **checks notes** joseph robinette biden jr this november
Here's the scenario... community with 250,000 voters. Score is tied. Trump has 100K, Biden has 100K. 50K have decided to stay home or vote 3rd party. Those 50K would never vote for Trump, but if they would/could find their way to vote for Biden? Game over.
They can‚Äôt arrest him, they don‚Äôt have anything. The person who needs to be arrested is Biden‚Äòs opponent
Then why the hell did you actively try to defund it for 40 years?  Liar. #NeverBiden #NeverTrump
Hear me out... This Presidential race could be like season one of the Politician where both candidates are forced to nominate the best VPs to win (which was basically the reality for Biden). Which means Trump should drop Pence and nominate someone that actually invigorates voters

You mean IF he leaves. There‚Äôs no way he accepts a Biden win. If it‚Äôs a blow out he‚Äôll say Russia did it or some shit and if it‚Äôs close he‚Äôll say it was mail-in fraud. I‚Äôm a bit afraid for December/January regardless of what happens.
Think about the implications of a general strike before the election, after a Biden victory, and after a Trump victory and which would be most effective.

Sounds like biden#Bernie called out to my soul, my need for community, common cause, for solidarity, sanity, decency, all the things we're so lacking! Biden is a soggy piece of white bread! #GeneralStrikeSeptember1st - We organize now bc there won't be a second chance! The planet is burning!
Biden: Who turn off the light?
That‚Äôs what Biden‚Äôs banking on. Keep the lockdowns starve the people.  If they‚Äôre losing he wins? Not a great look but it‚Äôs the strategy. We shall see!

So Obama and Biden had oversight weaponizing the Justice Department to spy on Trump‚Äôs campaign. Now Biden‚Äôs old bones are getting thrown in door. How fitting.
We‚Äôve already lost some women‚Äôs rights under Trump. We‚Äôve also lost LGBTQ+ rights, the environment has suffered, and racial injustice has increased. For all these reasons, I‚Äôm voting Biden/Harris. Of course we can criticize what we don‚Äôt like, but it‚Äôs either them or Trump.
Black vote is eroding for Dems.  They‚Äôre waking up to the reality that 50 years of dem run cities has got them nothing but murderous destruction and poverty.  Watch trump crack 10% in the black vote and the Biden black vote not show up.  Book it.
Trump oversaw the lowest back unemployment rate in history and signed he first step act. Lots of blacks home from prison now because of Trump. What racist behaviour? Saying all blacks are the same? Oh wait that was Biden two days ago.

You‚Äôre missing it. Enthusiasm. Dem models assumed Obama style black turnout. They didn‚Äôt show. Will they show for old man segregationist ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù Biden? Doubt it.  Trumps numbers are higher than Mitt and McCain among black vote. He will win.
Can‚Äôt wait!  Buddy of mine in Texas said he saw lots of Obama and Hillary signs in Dallas.  Hasn‚Äôt seen a single Biden sign.  You betta hope blacks get off the couch in Milwaukee for the old man!!  üòÇ  I can‚Äôt see it.
So, does this mean you will vote Biden-Harris?
Let this thread be an object lesson for Bernie Sanders and other Democrats in a Biden-Harris administration.  Come together and get things done. Better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.
Novogratz Says Stock-Market Bubble Will Probably¬†Pop If Biden Wins
Voting isn‚Äôt binary!!  Biden earn votes by supporting popular policies that help out the majority of voters... Medicare for all, ending wars, free college. Strengthening anti trust. Breaking up the banks...  A Trump win is the DEMOCRATIC parties fault. Never the voters..
If it makes you feel any better, the USPS Postal Workers Union has endorsed Biden.
We need national leadership during this health crisis, looking for Biden/Harris to give us the direction.
The Hill's Campaign Report: Biden, Harris make first public appearance as running mates
Or, he'll just wait for rapist Uncle Joe to pardon him. There is no way a criminal like Joe Biden pisses off the Republicans he so loves by sending Trump to jail, plus he doesn't want to end up in prison at the end of his crime spree. I'd prefer to burn the nation down.
Look we all get it,economic hardship based upon phoney lockdowns IS the Biden campaign. It‚Äôs their only hope, your Hail Mary. Try not to pretend otherwise it‚Äôs transparent. Americans will decide if Trump or a frail old man losing his mind and selling tax hikes can restart economy
Interesting: if Biden would call for Postal Service banking (an excellent idea, IMO); that means that banking, check cashing, &amp; payday-loan interests have a very strong incentive to see the USPS demolished before Biden can be elected.
M4A &amp; GND are equally important to me. Biden has done nothing, but give us the finger on these...and many other...issues.
If Trump would have led, we would be out of this pandemic, the strongest economy and 80% support regardless of party. There would be no Biden or Kamala -- However, his narcissism, incessant tweets and all about him attitude has us where we are. He never works: Golf, Tweeter, TV.
The trumpers don't harass me nearly as badly or as often as Biden supporters. They are fucking BRUTAL!
Thanks! I had defended him from people that were shaming him BC he was voting for Biden. I didn't even agree with him, but supported his right to vote for whomever he felt he needed to. That was a complete betrayal. Then he started talking shit about me to the vote shamers!
Really now?
I can't knock Joe Biden.  Some of the best years of my life were in the 3rd grade.
Michael Dukakis is gonna be so excited that Biden and the Cock Gobbler probably will win double the states he won in 88‚Äô.

The supposedly slower of the two is gonna be the one to defeat u, better get your homie Putin on Mr Biden.
Well f*** this and Joe Biden.   Biden-Harris:  the ultimate police state solution.  Enjoy your civil liberties while you still got them.
It's interesting that the loser known as Joe Biden picked another loser who had to end her campaign of lies and performative expressions of outrage.
That is still a tautology not an argument:  What will anyone accomplish by not voting for Biden?  What is the outcome that will happen?   What is the change that will happen?
Sure did. He said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a Biden fan, I‚Äôll have to plug my nose to vote for him.‚Äù Dude, this is exactly why you are perpetually single!!! üí©for BRAINS.
you also, still, have not explain why voting for anyone but Biden is going to meaningfully make any change, at all, ever. We know, absolutely, that third party stuff doesn't do it. It hasn't in the past, it won't in the future. So that argument is closed I'm afraid

Ok so the point here was to bring up a question vaush has answered *extensively* in order to prove a point that has already been disproven?  Biden has moved left, a lot, thanks in part to Bernies massive, massive popularity.
I put the ‚ÄúTrump discount‚Äù in the polls at minimum 8 points.  So if Biden has a 4 point lead in FLA, he‚Äôs ahead by about 4. Biden camp knows this which is why they‚Äôre panicking on mail in.
Still not voting for Biden. Gooood luck.
Sigh.
And that‚Äôs to say nothing of the millions upon millions of recovered people with antibodies. Get the virus, move on.  Or hide under your bed for ten years.  We all know it: the lockdown IS the Biden campaign.

There has been a lot of misery caused by your father the last 3 1/2 years. The best hope is the Biden DOJ will assign a special counsel to investigate the Trump crime family and the outcome will be a number of them will serve a prison sentence.
Biden makes Trump look like a idiot when it comes to real issues. Trump is only good at trolling.
Having a great accountant does not equate to being mentally incapable of remembering where you are Joe Biden.
So, here's the thing about Biden/Harris. Neither one has been great to the trans community: my friends, my family, myself. Obviously voting against fascists is good but I'm not excited about it. Duopoly systems are crap.
It's not journalists' job to do propoganda on behalf of a political figure or party - if it were, we would no longer be a free country. If one critical article is, to you, akin to a lynching or a coup against Biden, I think you may need to reflect on the skew in your perspective.

But even then, *absolute* worst case in Florida is that an additional 2% of GE ballots miss the cutoff. So if those are 75-25 Biden it cuts his margin by 1%. But I'm skeptical 100% of the "last two days" ballots would not make it.

I don't need to be reminded how horrible Donald Trump and the Republicans are, I'm well aware. We had many choices, Joe Biden was one of the worse. I hoped we would go with Bernie and fight for real change, so settle and get nothing for it.  5/10

Killing civilians with drone warfare is a war crime. And why would I want Biden to hate Jews? I know you hate palestinians and Muslims but try to look past your hatred for a second
You are right. That is why we are voting for Biden.
You do realize that that is exactly what Biden and Harris are doing as well, right? They will do anything at all cost to win. That‚Äôs what is expected.
Me thinks triumphant profiles of Biden Campaign staff is premature.
If trump wasn‚Äôt working to steal the election is never want mail to be handled by corps like ups + fedex. We may have no other choice which is the only reason I‚Äôd encourage those companies to step in. If the usps was too far gone - then Biden can then reinstate the usps.

That's simply not true.  Biden and Harris have both been quoted as saying that they're for confiscations; not to mention their 100% Open-Borders and "*Free Everything" policies, which are patently absurd.  Take back the DNC from the socialists.
I used my real name on my original account and was doxxed for making some jerk in Vegas unhappy.
No, that's not what's being said at all. Example: medically vulnerable people I know will suffer greatly under trump, but their funds and access will expand greatly under biden (via ACA, which worked better for them) - it's not a catch-all but you can't say that's not better
If anyone on the Biden campaign can't figure out that Trump's insults against Harris are a way of baiting her into unnecessary responses which in turn elevate her overall visibility above Biden's... then they deserve what's coming next.
"Healing" on the day after Trump engineered a Mideast reconciliation and on the day Hillary announces she would happily serve in a Biden Administration. Thanks, John.
No, I'm not. I'm saying Trump is very very bad, may even ruin democracy permanently, but Biden, while having similar policies in some areas (not many) will give us time to fight for the agenda we all really want, without risking lives under trump
I honestly think there's nothing funny about Biden's cognitive decline and it very much should be something people should consider when casting their vote. One of many factors.
But this is okay???
You don‚Äôt have to be in mental decline with a fetish for sniffing kids to vote for Biden, but you have to be comfortable with someone in mental decline who likes sniffing kids to vote for Biden.
But like- didn‚Äôt Biden win Black voters in the primary?  What am I missing?
Facts what are your facts. I said he was a playboy. Biden has several, its a stupid argument . Has nothing to do with him doing his job. He was never in politics and never was arrested or charged for any
For me, not voting for the racist, rapist, conservative sociopath that is Joe Biden and his predatory prosecutorial side-kick who puts and keeps innocent people in jail for slave labor is a matter of sustaining my morality. I just disagree with justifying a rapist for POTUS.
The Fatal Weakness of Kamala Harris as Biden's Running Mate in the Post-...  via
You‚Äôre so full of shit it‚Äôs mind boggling. You just don‚Äôt want legal voters putting Trump back in office. You want widespread voter fraud to put dumb shit Biden in. The old man can‚Äôt even make an intelligent sentence. And you want him running this country?! No thanks Osama*.
I mean, he's giving speeches about exactly that:
Notice that the statement doesn't say you can't vote for the *party.  It says you can't support this *candidate without violating the faith.  And as much as I dislike the Biden ad, I agree with this assessment. To vote for Trump in support of his policies violates social doctrine
Normally I agree with you, Steve-O..... but not this time. Lesser of two evils voting is killing this country, one election at a time.   People forget there's a space to write a name in. And that there's more than just Trump and Biden running.
Why not arrest, prosecute, and imprison rioters as both Trump and Biden want?
GOP senator draws fire from all sides on Biden, Obama-era probes
Former VP Biden is a puppet. Rest assured that the people at the top of the Democratic Party who call the shots and write the bills will be the same whether he finishes his first term or not.
If her advisement to a hypothetical Biden administration is even slightly as flimsy as saying what she thinks Biden wants to hear or what it will take to earn more out of her political career, it defeats the purpose of having a female VP and also delegitimizes the admin
What a stupid strategy.   Biden must be incapable of unscripted thought and that's unfortunate
I'll admit, I don't know everything about Kamala, but what I've seen makes me question the integrity of the Biden campaign as a whole, even if they somehow manage to attain the presidency.
In today‚Äôs episode of #FauxNews the Trumpaganda machine reports that Obama doesn‚Äôt really support Biden, Kamala isn‚Äôt really American, and a vote for Joe is really a vote for Hillary.   Stop the nonsense. Don‚Äôt buy from Fox sponsors. #ByeHannity #HatefulEight #UnFoxAmerica
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Joe Biden was the architect of the 94 crime bill. Pretty racist if you ask me.
Just because other candidates running in the primary had better platforms doesn‚Äôt mean we have to pretend that Biden isn‚Äôt running on a platform that‚Äôll do a lot of good for a lot of people.
Nope. You're the victim of political narrative. Biden isn't creepy at all &amp; he's not "taking advantage" of anyone. It's as innocuous as a grandparent giving a simple hug. If there were any "creepy" intents there, there'd been at least a little effort to hide it from casual view.
Kamala Harris' comment with Stephen Colbert about "dropping bombs," on Biden repeatedly saying "It was a debate" And her refusal to pardon black men in prison saying that prisons would lose labor is a sign to me that she's willing to say whatever it takes to get what she wants.

So don't vote.   üòâ  If the turnout tanks no-one can claim they have a mandate.   If everyone shows up for Biden-Harris they'll have free rein.   They're each responsible for a huge part of the system we're fighting.   Individual votes aren't what decides elections.

There's no lie there. I agree that M4A and universal healthcare aren't completely synonymous; M4A is a form of universal healthcare. If a M4A bill passed both Congress and Senate, and Biden vetoed it, that is a direct action against universal healthcare.

Biden supported the crime bill and Harris is a prosecutor. Obama killed more Syrian children than tRump ever did. The reality is the opposite. You're privileged if you "settle" for Biden because their policies don't hurt YOU. They still hurt BIPOC people, though.
That's applicable to both Trump and Biden.
Ironic how Trump et al attack his foes with ad hominems that more easily fit Trump himself. "Crooked" Trump paying hush money to porn stars with election funds so they don't talk about where he "grabs them by". Biden may kiss babies,  but at least doesn't French them like Trump.
The difference between your argument and mine is that I'm admitting I dont like Biden but will take that personal L for the chance to build local movements and stop the immediate threat. You and your boy in the OP believe keeping Trump is a viable option.
Biden is not Trump ..wake up
I loved  until she participated in the media infomercial promoting Biden for weeks on end.   and media decided who got to win.
Biden has consistently through his career right up until about 5 years ago spoken against abortion rights and the hyde amendment. Trump, on the other hand, has made no significant strikes on it. Ironically, Abortion (and for similar reasons, legal marijuana) is safer under trump.

I'm not willing to concede that. My view just factors in harm over a longer timeframe than a single election. So even in a harm reduction sense, I don't see voting for Biden as being actual harm reduction.
what are you willing to do about the USPS? Put your democratic money where your mother is. Biden will lose your Trump because of this.

Which president would be more imperial, based on their record? Which president would worsen mass incarceration? You actually have to have an extremely narrow definition of the word to think it applies to Trump but not Biden
Incorrect. Right now, the only thing a third party vote will do is elect Trump. So, why not create more flexibility with Biden?
No, I'm not. I'm saying there's value to leftists, progressives in getting Biden over trump, and there are reasons being presented. I'm not watering anything down.
Again Biden was not my option. I do not like this ticket.  But I'm also not a spoiled child.
It would help the post office. Covid would at least have a unified response. No unmarked federal troops in major cities.  Biden has agreed to a okay amount of the green new deal. Just to name a few. Again to pretend that Trump = Biden is a losing argument, factually.

I appreciate it. And I agree with you! I didn‚Äôt vote for Biden or Harris in the primaries. Look at my page‚Äîyou‚Äôll see me fundraising for Bernie. But I can compromise for 81 days if it means defeating a growing fascist movement in this country. We have no other choice right now
Well he's got my vote. Kamala and Biden have done far more harm to the black community than Trump ever could
I didn't say anything close to that. I said that the items listed aren't actually things they agree on, it's just made to look that way. None of those are positions Biden has taken. But I'm happy to be proven wrong with citations.
But that's my point. We know it won't happen with Trump but we don't know what happens with Biden
Yep - it forwards to Biden's site now.
Biden is an actual idiot:
Hold your nose and vote for Biden. The US Presidential elections are a binary choice‚Äîyou should always vote for the candidate you like the most, even if you don't care for them.  If you really just cannot do that, skip the election rather than vote for Donald.
No one is saying our problems started with Trump. But the situation is definitely worse under him. Why not try something else? We can keep fighting with Biden the same way we fought with Trump
The sad part is y‚Äôall ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù would have sucked it up and kept it moving if Biden chose a white man. Y‚Äôall only going up bc it‚Äôs a Black woman. FTR
I heard one time Biden forgot the name of a constituent. Yikes!

Question from a late convert to the Kamala camp - is there a site out there still selling Kamala merchandise? Or is it all "Biden-Harris" now?
Oh yeah. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are big time anarchists.
I think they will speak out against it, but Trump's mismanagement of the virus is more consequential so far--more than 160,000 dead? People want to know what Biden-Harris will do about this monumental tragedy and failure.
So what you're really saying  is that you're a loud annoying capitalist that causes mad pollution and Biden supports clean renewable energy while smoking fat ass blunts and listening to electric avenue???
4 years ago today in states of Pennsylvania, Clinton was up nine points. Today Biden is up six points. Wisconsin, Clinton was up 9.4 points. Today Biden is up 6.5 points. Ohio, Clinton was up 2.6 points. Today Biden is up 2.3 points. Trump won all 3 states. #trump2020
Definitely do Biden a favor by wasting money in one of the biggest Democratic stronghold in the country.
i‚Äôm infuriated by the ongoing effort to paint the biden/harris ticket as bland and uninspiring, like airline food chicken, while simultaneously describing trump as like eating shit with broken glass in it  there‚Äôs no chicken on the menu, friends, it‚Äôs dog shit and horse shit
These guys say there's no difference between Democrats and Republicans. They call Democrats conservative. It's not rational. Nothing Biden or Harris can do or say will please them. I don't think Biden and Harris will be courting them.
I urge all those who believe in freedom and democracy to stand with the people of The USA who are demanding a better life.   I look forward to working with the Biden administration to push back as firmly as possible against the Trump-rigged election.     Fixed it for you.
It has been a challenge for me as a non-black person to explain my position to someone who is black and liberal that Biden/Harris is bad for the the black community. Because I am not black and don't understand the black experience.
You mean the person who pressured Ukraine to put some dirt on Biden was clean in 2016. Everyone is corrupt but Trump is not. üòÇüòÇüòÇ  If you are interested, I can get you a good deal on the West Seattle Bridge.
I agree that protest violence is a problem. As far as I can tell in Seattle, most of it is committed by a core of young white men who identify as anarchists or sometimes Marxists. They are not voting for the Biden-Harris ticket.
Fuck this.

If I had to guess liberals and progressives are not in the majority of Biden backers . . . so the answer to your question is more like, "actually it's these other people . . ." and those are called establishment democrats who actually aren't very liberal or progressive
we just push biden to the left on line subsidies
But at the end of the day, it's a two-party system. Progressives and liberals should wholeheartedly support Biden because the enemy of your enemy is your friend

I don't think there's any legal evidence for Biden being a pedophile, but there's lots of court cases about Trump's sexual assault preferences. I don't think he should be in power any more - over 27 settled cases regarding sexual misconduct. Biden? 0.
If you think the criticisms of Biden and Harris are about a "purity test" instead of about real lives being impacted, you're missing the point.
Actually I like Biden quite a bit have for a long time
You claim a lot of so-called ‚Äòcredibility‚Äô for yourself BUT you attempt to prove it by voting for Biden!!!?? You‚Äôve only proven you are mentally scrambled! You  vote for Biden and you will be a total loser!
Not all of it. There are important and immediate difference between Biden, Trump. For instance ACA, SC nominations, HHS funding, Pardons, Cabinet operations, Diplomacy, medicaid protections  Lots of these will have immediate effect for POC, Immigrants, Health Vulnerable people
narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016 by fewer than 80,000 votes in PA, WI, and MI to secure the 46 electoral votes that handed him a 304-226 victory.   Polls have put Biden ahead of Trump in all 3 states in 2020.
It‚Äôs easy. Hold your nose &amp; vote for Biden/Harris. The country as we know it may not survive another Trump term. Read Mary Trump‚Äôs book. That should help convince you, if you‚Äôre not already, that Donald does not have the character or abilities to be President. It‚Äôs a quick read.

It‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre voting Biden (I‚Äôm not) but please stop kidding yourselves that Kamala and Biden haven‚Äôt spent their entire careers putting kids in cages
Are Biden and Harris above criticism? Hell, no.  Are there much, much, MUCH better ways to spend your time and energy than criticizing them right now? FUCK, YES!
Pay him tribute by voting for Biden.
They‚Äôre both awful on FP. Biden is pro-Israel, pro-Guaido, supported the war in Iraq, and stood by and said nothing while Obama committed war crimes
When I said Biden is more electable, I meant to the broad swath of voters who turn out to elections, not just the people reading this thread.
crazy how that was all completely organic! such a move clearly did not come from behind the scenes moves like negotiating with weaker campaigns to all drop out simultaneously and endorse biden in exchange for appointed positions!
Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake  via
Hey, I appreciate your passion but I'm talking about things in a different way.   My argument for Biden is that he's employing progressive people, and isn't trump. Additionally, I cannot see the damage in replacing Biden with Trump but I can see the damage of keeping Trump
Can't wait for Tr*mp to try and use this "If Biden is elected, he's going to bring back the mailboxes and mail will be flowing like it used to into your neighborhoods!"
Oh, these guys will torch Biden ballots...they're straight up criminals.
They already impeached him because he was mean to Joe Biden
Hey  , would you teach the Biden team how it's done? We need an account like yours to support the Biden/Harris campaign!
My take: There will be a significant amount of us who either vote third party or don't vote at all in the general election, but there'll probably be an even greater amount of people who do vote for Biden and Harris out of fear. However you feel, at least vote!
Her partner is Joe Biden who always forgets her name is Kamala.  The two most characteristic fools in Congress came together and dreamed of dominating America for 4 or 8 years.üòí

That's another MSM talking point...I used to buy that, too.  Have you actually looked into the Ukrainian cases against Biden and listened to the tapes and looked at the documents...?
That‚Äôs right justice is coming in the name of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and you will be one on the list. Do you ever stop to think of the lives that you completely destroy. No because you don‚Äôt give a shit. Wait till someone starts fucking with your life.

Vote for Biden. He‚Äôs a decent guy. Trump is a murderer, a racist, sexist, a liar.
You know it's farked up when Donald Trump has a real chance at running to the LEFT of the "centrist" DNC.  Imagine the result if he backed Medicare For All or other issues the large majority of voters (including Republicans) want, but Biden/DNC went out of their way to üí© on.
If you think the claims of charity fraud are bad....then you REALLY should be beside yourself over the Biden's and their actions in Ukraine and China!
Biden will take a pasting. The Left are on their last legs and if he is the best they can do then they really are in trouble. False mail-in votes is a big worry - We are regularly prosecuting people this side of the pond for illegal voting practices. The Dems are even worse.

That‚Äôs not an argument. That‚Äôs an assumption your Rachel Maddow warped mind leaps to in defense of your precious professional managerial class dogma. The argument is they she clearly does not want Trump to win and believes Biden‚Äôs failings as a politician will demoralize voters.
I support Kamala Harris over Donald Trump &amp; Biden most definitely.   I‚Äôve read some things about her record too that weren‚Äôt good but they were some of the things he mentioned so I‚Äôve got to research more of how her policy advocacy impacted black folks tangibly.
Harm reduction in itself is hypothesis. You don't KNOW that harm will be reduced if people vote for Biden. You THINK that, but it's not fact.
Republicans are holding this up. Vote for Biden
No they don't!  They will be bought off just like everyone else seems to be but for a few good people!  We can't trust the damn post office with our mail anymore than we can trust Joe Biden with our mail!  Absentee ballots, fine -- post office mailed ballots -- NOT FINE!!!!!!!!

However, Biden has a chance of winning and Hawkins has no chance at all. I'm not saying he doesn't have the better stance but it doesn't matter, electability is what matters
Actually he is wrong. You have been trying to destroy this country, for your own personal gain. Biden/Harris will win and hopefully the new AG, along with the NY AG, will investigate you and hold you responsible for your criminal acts.
Biden is charging $25 for a sign plus $9 in shipping. This is quite expensive. Especially charging for shipping is a major turn off
My guess is if you‚Äôre this fragile, you were never going to vote for Biden in the first place

Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris won't take press questions. Somehow CNN &amp; MSNBC seem okay with that. Why? Because they don't really have questions. They'd mostly just cheer-lead and lob softballs anyway. The campaign will keep the duo from answering questions as long as they can.
they quite literally advocated for "relentless bullying of rape victims," and they haven't provided evidence that this leads to votes for biden and harm reduction  I think we're done here
So the deal is to have employers ‚Äúdefer‚Äù payment of payroll taxes.  I hate to say it but it‚Äôs a politically genius move. The payments are delayed, and if Trump loses they return after the election and can be blamed on Biden/Harris. If Trump wins, he‚Äôll just lie it away.
Question: has anyone from the DNC or the campaign even reached out directly to Juli√°n? Cause Biden‚Äôs campaign pulled the ‚Äúhe has an important role‚Äù stuff but other than the police reform exchange on here, I haven‚Äôt seen anything to indicate attempts to include him.
Biden. Any vote for anyone other than Joe, or not voting at all only helps trump.

Also, don‚Äôt act like voting for Biden is some huge harm-reduction. There‚Äôs very few issues where he‚Äôs better and the ones where he is, it‚Äôs not by much. Only by a minuscule amount. He‚Äôs not even bringing us back to the Obama days, he‚Äôs too scared to even go that far ‚Äúleft‚Äù
Y‚Äôall realize that you can still protest if Biden/Harris are in offcie, right?
OK Bernie, repeat after me:  Vote for Joe Biden/ Kamala Harris.

Do we have anything better to do? Yes I would. Unfortunately I wouldn't wait to vote for Biden so...
joe biden literally supported the actual iraq war
And with Biden, we have a perfect idea of how he‚Äôll govern. As a neo-lib with neo-con tendencies. He‚Äôs willing to work with right-wingers which would be okay if they worked on leftist policies, but instead Biden works with them on their right-wing policies.
My point is that, right now, this is what we have to do. Protest the hell of Biden and Harris when they‚Äôre in office. Go nuts. But we need a start on the right track, and Trump has pointed us in a direction that will be much harder to get out of.
But family or people with different thoughts or conclusions don't qualify... Got it.   Are you even objective enough to recognize the Corruption in career politicians like Biden &amp; Pelosi profiting off foreign governments and ours?
The other thing to take into account when considering why some of dont want to vote for #Biden is that if I vote for someone and they‚Äôre elected, I feel responsible for their actions in office. War crimes, incompetence, enabling systematic racism, or whatever it may be
If anyone is curious, there's actually some surprisingly good stuff in there

No. Biden is not better. Biden has been advocating for cutting social security for decades. Biden will veto M4A.  You can vote for whoever you want, but that right ends where you start telling others how they are supposed to exercise their "right" by voting for your choice.

Hi Susan - please post your endorsement of Biden/ Harris for President. Your followers need to hear from YOU that you will be voting to have Trump removed from office. (A sound argument can be made that failure to do so is tacit support for Trump).
Regardless, I'm a "liberal" and I want Biden to win and I want to be able to pass progressive legislation in 2021.
No one is buying the gaslighting from the 2016 playbook. You‚Äôre losing and you deserve it. In fact, indictments and prosecutions should commence the day Biden/Harris take office. Day 1.

Biden will be a good president.  He knows how to bring people together.  To get anything done on the Federal level u need someone who can work both sides of the isle.

I'm also curious how the Biden/Harris campaign will react. In the Obama campaign, in general I felt race was dealt with a bit obliquely, at least until

He tweeted out some bullshit this morning about how Biden and Harris weren‚Äôt perfect but better than Trump or something weak ass like that. Note that he did not block the person who said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fuck with cops‚Äù aka a non- or third-party voter.
Suck it up unless you want four more years of this insanity! Joe Biden is a decent man. He won‚Äôt tweet bullshit lies or retweet QAnon conspiracy theories or be a racist ,white supremacist using dog whistles or use the office to enrich  himself and his family.  #VoteJoeBiden2020
Trump: Absentee good; mail in bad.   Others: they'rethe same thing.  Trump: well then, vote for me good; vote for Biden bad  Others: so you're reallyjust trying to save your ass?  Trump: No, by which I mean yes, by which I mean no, by which I mean yes, by which I mean...
Lots of people make accusations and none were credible. Biden has many accusers.... Somehow #metoo only applies to people on the left who accuse the right? You‚Äôve lost credibility here, bro.
Remember when Obama left his yacht to force the entire Democratic party to sabotage Bernie and get Biden the candidacy?  Why cant you have that level of coordination to stop Trump?
Biden didnt choose Kamala because shes black and a woman. He chose her because her hair smelled the best.
Even if Biden were to embrace progressive policies, I believe he's just be pandering for votes. I know Joe.
Vote for Biden to secure that Trump does not get elected. After 2020 you can go back to choose whomever you would like!
Sure. It's always the "white folk's" fault.
And Beau Biden plays into this how?  It's the counter-argument to the statement you made.  You set the arena, I am just playing in it.
Very important to understand this. Not voting for Biden or not voting at all is the same as voting for Trump.  Make no mistake: every single one of Trump's followers will be voting for him in November.  #VoteOutTheGOP
Voting for Biden and Harris does not mean they are perfect. It is simply what needs to be done. Accountability will still be held.
Here is the difference..Trump has thrown out the ground rules.  Biden has human decency, Trump does not.  It doesn't make it right, but when you knock down barriers and dish things out, people are going to hit back.  It's pretty simple.  Trump also said 160k dead "is what it is."
You aren‚Äôt understanding my point. Even if the USPS were to blatantly illegally prevent delivery of every ballots people mail on Election Day, Oregon‚Äôs electoral votes will still go to Biden. Voter suppression only matters (for the presidential election) in battleground states.

‚ÄúDonald Trump was the national leader of the grotesque, racist birther movement with respect to President Obama and has sought to fuel racism and tear our nation apart on every single day of his presidency,‚Äù a Biden campaign spokesman said in an email.

There‚Äôs Nothing That will stop me from voting for Biden/Harris
This is so fucking pathetic. You're after the Biden Harris ticket because they want to put out some new dietary guidelines and divest from fossil fuels over a couple decades. That sounds like adulting. You represent the childish "give me what I want now!" strain of America.
Then Biden can call the military in on them.
It‚Äôs called harm reduction, and it‚Äôs why for the first time in years I‚Äôm gonna diverge from your stance. I love and appreciate you, Bri and your vote is yours. Do what you want. But I‚Äôm voting against Fascism, not for anyone. Biden will get my vote.

If you have been waiting for a sign from God that Trump needs to go, it is knocking on the door. Please sign for the package. Vote Biden.    Two minutes. Literally. Two.
The only hope I have with a potential Biden/Harris presidency is that at the very least these people can be pushed left through conventional political and activist means. Voting Biden means we get a chance to fight for ourselves. Trump is a death sentence.
And Biden should be up by 30 points right now, but we can't always get what we want.
What has every crime bill been. A democratic crime bill by a democratic president. - Joe Biden
He acknowledges that if the vote was today it'd probably be a win for Biden. The uncertainty is more about stats state-by-state and the possibility that something could shift the polls between now and November. I agree you can't really put a # on that, not the same as roulette.
The idea of having to vote for Biden (if I could vote) as a progressive makes my skin crawl as much as yours.   But voting this November will literally decide who lives and who dies in the next years. It was like this in 2016 and we failed. It needs to be different now.
Kamala Harris is like the mean auntie that remarried and has a new husband (Joe Biden) that‚Äôs cool, but you only like him because he‚Äôs kinda family now, but he ain‚Äôt though.
Biden being the first non-Ivy candidate since Walter Mondale in 1984 is honestly a nasty bit of history.
This is why I don‚Äôt understand people who are torn on voting between Trump and Biden. Trump is actively trying to interfere with the election. Trump wants to be a dictator. Trump is a threat to democracy. Biden is the store brand Pepsi of politicians. He‚Äôs just average.
lol...You‚Äôre salty because Biden announced his VP pick via the Internet??? Your boss does EVERYTHING through twitter...you know that‚Äôs also the Internet...right?? Did you think Biden was going to announce it in Tulsa to seed a second Covid outbreak?

Kamala Harris brings much-needed diversity on a host of fronts to the Democratic presidential ticket as Joe Biden's running mate.
Quite easily. He follows the rule of law, family man, protects freedom of religion and has been one of the few president to talk about Christian persecution in the ME. While Biden and Harris have signed into a communist unity deal. Communism is morally wrong.
You‚Äôre the worst excuse for a twitter account. And a Christian supporting Biden?
I'm having trouble finding it at the moment but I saw a poll last week and likely mail-in voters prefer Biden 2:1 and likely in-person voters prefer Trump 3:2, so I think that has most to do with the calculus. Hurting possible constituents is just collateral damage.
Fantastic ad. Put pressure on Biden now.
same ones who salivate over a peace deal that's not a deal and today the "will he/won't he" with snowden. i'm sure barr will release some red meat bullshit today about Obama and Biden creating Russiagate out of whole cloth.  And media will LAP IT UP

To me, voting for Biden in this election is a lot like wearing a mask. It‚Äôs making me generally uncomfortable and feels like a minuscule action against unstoppable forces, but it costs me nothing, and there‚Äôs a small chance it‚Äôll protect someone I care about.
isn't presidency 2024 prior. it's effectivize Trump (as well as administration of his), no deterrence. outdo the bad Left and Biden/Obama has caused. A much needed bandage for our souls. of America. of the world. for a better future for you. and beyond's'.
I am seeing a lot of folks upset about Kamala because she sucks. That's fair, and I actually agree completely. Her anti trans beliefs hurt me, personally. But please still vote for her and Joe fucking Biden. Also, let's talk about inherent trauma, a thread.

No, but not supporting Biden and saying all politicians are bad is what elected Trump in 2016. They‚Äôre not both bad ‚Äî Trump is the worst thing to happen to the in a century, and Biden is a steady hand that knows how to lead in a crisis.
Does it hurt that most Democrats don't know that and will still vote for Biden/Harris, because they are too lazy to do their own research and believe everything at face value from what the media shows?
Thanks for the reminder. Finished the ‚Äúto do‚Äù of becoming a Biden-Harris ‚Äúfounding donor.‚Äù
Nafy, look at what Trump has done to divide the country with the protests and look at the uniting messages Biden has shared. I think the choice is obvious in the 2020 election, not the 1976 election.
And I thought I made it clear why I'm not voting for him. I will vote down ballot, for many Democrats that aren't anything spectacular but my state's general system gives literally two choices in every race. I would vote for Biden if I lived in Michigan or something
Some of the latest: "Kamala Harris is the meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful, MOST LIBERAL of anyone in the U.S. Senate"  "That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left."
No I'm not sitting and "pouting". Bernie wasn't the "perfect" candidate. He's also not on a comparable level to Biden in any form who is a completely terrible and inadequate candidate who's made the lives of American's worse.
If Joe Biden were racist, why would Obama pick him to be his VP for 8 years?

This nothingburger doesn't add up. Obviously it's just a paper dove for Trump to wave around. Netanyahu knows Biden hasn't forgotten that he punked Obama in our house (in front of silent un-American Republicans). But what did the UAE get? Something.

Well Kamala isn‚Äôt POTUS nominee. Biden is. He can stomach a VP. I sincerely think he just wanted to keep a woman from being President.

I think this 'trying to find the differences' &amp; having no choice but to back the lesser of two evils is how we've ended up with in this position.  If Biden says he'll remove all 800 US military bases across the globe &amp; stop bombing brown children, maybe he'd get my backing.

Not only is Joe Biden not the left, he doesn't represent the left in any way. He has nothing in common with the left. He doesn't listen to the left, because, in fact, he despises the left.
right like all the arguments ive seen for biden are either accusing ppl who don't vote of moral superiority complex OR "anything is better than trump" like can yall come up with . even one good talking point
I met Anita Hill before the hearings. She was obviously very sharp. I have despised Biden since. He's why I never even considered voting for Obama. If that's your choice for a running mate...and now by extension, it says nothing good about Harris.
ANOTHER BIRTHER LIE.
Do you get a sense that there‚Äôs any loyalty to Biden since he has some roots there?
I'm not saying don't vote for Biden. In fact, I will personally be voting for Biden.  Let's just be realistic about what Biden presidency entails. We will be fighting alone.
I get real nervous when so many radical leftist seem to be promoting violence. Then when already Harris is acting like a dictator. Keep her out it is not about Biden. They will probably eliminate him quickly like they did JFK.
I do like Biden, just not as much as a few of the other dem candidates.) But, when I think of a Biden presidency, I know without a doubt that I won‚Äôt cringe every single day about what he is saying/doing/ignoring. I -know- he will focus on the country and not himself. He‚Äôs decent
i see this sentiment echoed when leftists perpetuate the notion that once we vote biden in, liberals will fight alongside us.  they will not. the only reason they are "fighting alongside us" now is because our hatred of Trump coincides with theirs.

So, while the Biden/Harris campaign is clearly reminding us of what a president and a vice president actually look like in a crisis; Trump is throwing wild haymakers with his hammer.
You are an awful governor. Please stop using Washingtonians lives for your Biden administration audition. I think they get that you are anti Constititional Republic, free-range leftist radical.
Imagine voting for Biden &amp; Harris ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Person: 1 tweet about how bad Trump is, 50 tweets about how bad Biden/Harris are.  Same Person: Upset that people think they don't want Biden to beat Trump.
Living in Seattle metro, King County... is there even a point voting for Biden?  Feels like pissing in an ocean of piss and saying that you helped.
Trump WILL destroy this country. WILL kill millions of people. And may well do even more.  Biden/Harris, well, we don't know what they'll do, but the odds of it being WORSE than Trump are slim, so I'll take them.

I get this position 100%. But I couldn't vote for him. Abortion is my biggest issue. Trump is no stalwart there but he's adjusted to be a repub. Anyway, the choices aren't great. Either way. Biden, I think, will be a puppet.
Harris and Biden will be better than Trump...They won't kill people like Trump and republicans to get it better...we wouldn't be in this shape if trump and Republicans didn't call virus a hoax...
Biden will defer. He'll get run over on day one.
7 times Kamala Harris effortlessly proved just how incompetent Trump really is
After learning more about Harris, I'm legitimately getting pissed off. The problem is, we don't have a choice. We have terrible options, but we need to stop dividing the vote. Any vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump. I hate it. We cannot survive another Trump term.
My stance is very dependent on where I am. This is a rock solid, unshakeable blue state. Biden WILL win. My vote has zero impact on the actual election. Therefore, my vote is not a forced choice, it's an endorsement. And I STRONGLY feel none of the 3 options deserve that.
Biden literally doesn't even support legalizing marijuana, and Kama'lock-em-up Harris built an entire career out of throwing innocent people in prison for victimless crimes
I see no compelling reason to vote for either. Biden/Harris is an absolutely atrocious pair I agree with on *nothing,* and Jorgensen/Cohen is an absolutely pathetic, laughable ticket of completely unqualified nobodies with zero credibility (not to mention Jo is cringe af)
There is no chance of Biden losing Washington. My vote is not relevant to the outcome of the election and is not a case of harm reduction or forced preference, it's a case of making a normative endorsement of a particular candidate/ticket
Sorry folks it‚Äôs been taken down off her twitter and is no longer there.  So I can‚Äôt prove. I saw the video myself and was impressed. Well if someone recorded it, they will post it.  No poof- but I remember her saying is ‚ÄúBiden is an old man, an old racist‚Äù.
Doubt it  fights against legalization &amp; #Biden is not a friend of the leaf either.
Otherwise I could say that Joe Biden  sniffed a unicorn + actually was part of Corn Pops gang, I have the photos!  Btw I‚Äôd like to see Trump saying that it was a cesspool. All the leader elites knew of the Island, on both sides of the aisle! Knowing of it doesn‚Äôt mean complicit.
Former Republican Governor John Kasich of Ohio will be speaking at Democratic Convention.  What position will he hold in Biden Cabinet.  A great leader gets the best person for each position no matter what party affilation. #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
I appreciate the explanation, as that‚Äôs not what I took from your earlier tweets. I agree pressure from the left should/will shape the campaign &amp; administration. It seems it has already, as Biden has moved that way (some) - whether through Bernie or progressives in the streets.
To all the "apples to oranges" people out there:  Obama and Biden didn't downplay Ebola, call it a hoax, or tell us that it would magically disappear - they did their jobs.  Trump can't handle a crisis because he's mentally impaired.  That's why we have 165K+ dead from #COVID19.
I‚Äôm a suburban wife and mother and I would walk across broken glass on my hands and knees to vote for Biden and Harris.
Would be just as accurate if biden went to antifa site.
I hear he‚Äôs been spending a lot of money trying to fight this virus. And is in the background trying to help with the Biden campaign. So don‚Äôt be so ready to judge people. If you don‚Äôt know the answer don‚Äôt ask the question.
Now watch #Biden speak. Good god I never thought I would miss someone who could string a complex thought together more.  #Biden2020
It‚Äôs just ignorance. I hope people don‚Äôt get into arguments about this shit with these people. Don‚Äôt waste your time. It‚Äôs like arguing with Trump. Spend time on lifting up Biden and Harris.
Hoping Biden holds the independent voters until after the election.
Senator Kamala Harris has campaigned for climate justice and stood up to the NRA. Her selection to Vice President Biden‚Äôs ticket is the right choice for this moment in our history; I‚Äôm looking forward to what‚Äôs to come and proud to support her.
The Trump/Pence campaign has nothing but racist and misogynistic sticks and stones to throw while the Biden/Harris campaign offers a definitive and substantive way out of our American nightmare.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris - these are Damn fine people.  #BidenHarris2020  #Biden2020
I am really enjoying listening to Biden and Harris without the noise of applause and screaming from the audience. It's very peaceful and calming and informative
As November approaches, you're going to notice more and more accounts claiming to be leftists who will try to encourage you not to vote. Not voting for Biden or not voting at all is the same as voting for Trump.  #ElectionInterference is constant.
I'm honestly less concerned about conservative voters and more concerned at the perfect candidate crowd that has paid zero fucking attention to actual history. Look, I'm no Biden fan or Harris fan. But I know how they will pick better justices than Pence/Trump.
Harris is unmoored in her ambition, unmoored meaning zero scruples in what she will do to further Kamala Harris. And she will be the prez as Biden will exit soon after the election. She is radical, angry, and wants power.
Gonna tell my kids this was Joe Biden's running mate
No, the premise of your question is faulty. There is no evidence to believe that Biden will behave the same way as Trump. No evidence that Biden will continue the process of destroying the country and attempting to turn it into a right-wing authoritarian dictatorship.
...oh Sorry this one is of Biden speaking as a racist. People can change, so I look for that hasn't he just doubled down?  I'm still looking for the one I saw of Kalama calling him out after the debates outside of building of brick, in front of doorway.
Bernie supporters were happy to say ‚Äúto hell with Bernie‚Äù after he endorsed Biden &amp; was unable to get him to move meaningfully left. Shocked the pundits who thought he was a ‚Äúcult leader‚Äù, but we were never a cult of personality (great track CM Punk forever) but a cult of policy.
Did she say she isn't voting? She's not voting Biden or Trump. There are other options. And choosing not to vote for president is still a choice. Still her decision. And one she doesn't have to state.
White "leftists" going on and on about how they can't morally vote for Biden.
There's no way I could vote for Biden. Zero. His values do not represent mine. At one time, that was true of Tom, too.
You and Bernie was my dream ticket, but Ill take you and Biden over The Pumpkin and The Pence any day. Can't wait for VP Debate #VoteBidenHarris2020
Why have I seen zero campaigning by Biden? By this time in the Obama campaign people were composing songs. Do you really all think Trump is going to lose? Did you notice that you were sure he was going to lose last time?
- excellent piece on   and bravo to Joe Biden.  Her long and dedicated career ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù &amp; yes she will be a wonderful VP and Klobuchar‚Äôs analogy of the NASA‚Äôs women beautifully depicted in ‚ÄúHidden Figures‚Äù was spot on &amp; it‚Äôs VERY EXCITING
Bottom line is that I believe in her and her ideas and I'm happy that so many of them are being adopted by Biden. She has and will continue to work hard in the name of public service because she knows it's not about her. It's about us. She has my support in all she does.
It makes sense Harris would be Biden‚Äôs pick, nothing sells politics today better than a vagina. #gop #fakenews #ObamaGate #Kavanaugh
It is okay to be excited about Kamala Harris. She has changed her tune about LGBTQ people in the last few years which is good. Doesn't mean she isn't problematic, just like Biden. Regardless both of them are significantly better than the garbage currently in the Oval Office.
Perfect is the enemy of the good. For marginalized people there's a huge difference between Trump/Pence v Biden/Harris. For privileged liberals maybe not so much.
I still haven't forgotten how Biden treated Anita Hill.   Moving forward doesn't mean anything is forgotten.   I'm still voting #BidenHarris2020 .
Thank you, Juan. And for those privileged lefties at Counterpunch and the like who want the perfect and the pure it's time for them to get on board because for marginalized people (not privileged people like them) there' a HUGE difference between Biden/Harris v Trump/Pence.
...If 45 loses, there's still the damage done: fires of hatred stoked into cultural conflagrations; how much we've hastened the destruction of a habitable world; how we've alienated allies &amp; become a global joke. We need more than Biden/Harris‚Äîwe need a love revolution. ...
Why the fuck did Biden pick a cop as his running mate? Is he trying to lose this election?
So Kamala's Biden's running mate, I'm not surprised, just disappointed.
OK, it's really great that Harris has this immigrant background and is making history etc. etc. TBH I'm far more interested in (a) can she help Biden beat Trump? and (b) what are the policies she will fight for going forward?
As much as I've been stanning Warren since 2016, I fully support Harris on the ticket with Biden.  I will vote #BidenHarris2020  with a big smile on my face.   With a blue wave in the Senate, Warren can thrive and work to unfuck Trump's fuckery. I'd love her 2b next Sen Maj Ldr.
Watching season 2 of Alf and they are making references to Joe Biden running for President. It‚Äôs kind of cool that Alf was ahead of its time. #Alf

Joe Biden, like myself own guns.  Quit while you are ahead before the NRA goes into bankruptcy.
Kamala Harris is an incredibly strong, gifted public servant who will help write our history. She's also a savvy, talented politician and exactly who Joe Biden needs to win in a landslide. #MVP   Election night 2008 was incredible. It can happen again this fall. Let's make it so.
Everyone‚Äôs frustrated and taking solace in others verbalizing it. Honestly anyone Biden might pick would prompt a similar torrent of bile (for similar reasons; this whole campaign has been Dems telling us to get bent).
"Vote Blue No Matter Who" is literally the exact same kind of totalitarian rhetoric that got us in the CURRENT mess, especially given a Biden/Harris ticket with Pete Buttigieg on the cabinet is indistinguishable in policy terms from Bush/Cheney with Paul Wolfowitz on the cabinet
Biden is the worst recent candidate except for Trump and Hillary. We were screwed before we even voted last time and this time.
More than stepped up: formed a lasting and deep friendship and comraderie among peers that the current administration is sorely lacking it its servile adoration of the President.   I‚Äôll happily vote for Biden/Harris. They weren‚Äôt my first choices, but they‚Äôre good ones.
I also think it says a good things about Biden that he looked past the clashes they had in debates (and the crappy advice he‚Äôs apparently been getting from his friends that they‚Äôve been leaking to the press).
Harris is a pretty good choice. She doesn‚Äôt bring much regionality (Biden is going to win California, regardless), but she‚Äôs a smart, thoughtful, and dedicated public servant who represents groups that Dems have taken for granted for far too long.
Not surprised. They agree on prosecution and incarceration. She is smart and has a quick wit. Biden desperately needs a defender and attack dog on his ticket.
Exactly. Warren supporter that will vote Biden because it's the right thing to do even though I'm not a fan of him.
It's gonna be Biden or Trump. Biden is not ideal but there's nothing to think about. Very few could be worse than Trump...
The State Department is going to need some massive rebuilding. Also, sanctions on Russia and Saudi Arabia need to be harsh and comprehensive. I hope Biden and Harris make that a priority.
Both she and Biden make noises about police reform, but Biden has said he supports community policing, which actually increases the budget/scope of policing. We need to be moving the other direction. Here's hoping they listen to the Black organizers who are pushing for change!
The available choices for the positions in the Biden administration are just delicious.  Attny General, Secretary of Treasury, Speaker of the House, Senate Majority Leader.  Strategic decisions need to be ready to go at the time of the inauguration.
Literally no one is doing this. We are all fucking terrified, and actually dealing with REAL LIFE consequences of the current administration. We can‚Äôt afford to be fucking intellectual about this. A Biden/Harris vote buys us some time to start to heal. It doesn‚Äôt end the fight.
I can find way more pics of Dumb Don with Ghislane Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstien than Biden. #TRUMPLIVESONPEDOISLAND
That would work, too, I just think she's so good with legislation that she'd be perfect at getting the right bills on Biden's desk. I don't trust Schumer for that at all.
Dude, I was already going to vote Biden/Harris, you don't have to sell it so hard
Okay cool cool, Biden/Harris - these folx want our vote, and are a heck of a lot better than the other choice, obvi. Let's push them towards abolition in the next few months, huh?
So vote for Trump to guarantee that Biden/Harris don‚Äôt get elected.
Unless I‚Äôm badly mistaken,  is talking about a formal vote as a delegate, only on the platform.  It really is a completely separate issue from voting for Biden or not.  That said: Blind, knee-jerk ‚Äúthe Party is always right no matter what they do‚Äù used to be the USSR.
Hey #DonnieDimwit...at least Kamala can put together a coherent sentence. Something I have yet to see you do. You can't even read a teleprompter. LOL!  I can hardly wait to see the upcoming debates! Biden/Harris are going to wipe the floor up with you and Pency.
Well, it's Kamala Harris for Biden's Veep. So there's that...
I am not a big fan of either  Biden or Harris.  Do I think they can stomp tRump? You betcha. Do I think things will change dramatically? Yes &amp; no.  Do I think Gov't action will be more in alignment with my beliefs with them in office? Fvck yes!
Joe Biden didn't pick anyone. His handlers did.
Yeah, Biden/Harris are notorious socialists.
Yeah, I caucused for Bernie in 2016, and canvassed for him this year. I definitely hope Biden wins! But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll actually change much more than tone, and comes with another likely problem‚Äîwhite people feel comfortable again and stop engaging in politics.
You're wise beyond your years CJ.  Kamala bends with the wind.  If Biden wins, Kamala will be POTUS in 3-weeks to 90 days, and that is why she is his running mate.
That's good once in a while. Its Hot in CT but its August so that's not news. Wait Biden picked a running mater.
i love how harris was trying to beat biden n call him a racist and now has to act like nothing happened rofl both loserz
I would have liked Kamala to choose Biden as the VP- but I will take this for sure.
Once Biden promised a black woman as his VP, it kind of had to be Harris. She was the only in-the-box choice (statewide officeholder), and Biden can't afford to go out of the box.
Biden will wipe the floor in a debate with you. It's no contest. Add in a Senator Harris debate against Pence? Cherry on top. ü§£ #BidenHarris2020
No, the tough choice is Biden and Kamala. I thought you were responding to my response to a poll by  asking which of the FOUR you‚Äôd prefer to be president. And even considering it a two option poll of JUST Biden &amp; Harris, I cant decide.
I‚Äôm a little surprised! Apparently she quit following the Biden campaign on Twitter a few days ago so I thought ‚Äúwhew, at least it‚Äôs not Kamala!‚Äù
Lets' do this. Biden/Harris 2020.
It‚Äôs the definition of harm reduction. All four of them are bad news for most Americans. Trump and Pence far worse, sure. But even considering Chris‚Äô post a two-option poll and to choose between Biden and Kamala is also a choice I struggle with. Both suck for their own reasons.

There's much more to the presidency than the online culture war. A President Biden doesn't mean whities are going to start being hanged. Wisdom regarding international relations, particularly with our allies, is quite a few rungs higher on the ladder.
Biden's mental faculties have slipped, no doubt. But like I said, the people on his team, including the VP, will be miles better than the current resident in the White House. Any lip service they pay to progressives is just that, lip service.
Unfortunately there really are no other viable options. Tbh, to get the current occupant out, I'd be happy with a "Weekend at Biden's" presidency, as I know he'll have basically centrist advisors around him. It would have been a much tougher call if there was a far left candidate

Is Biden being blackmailed? Black male leaders warn Biden ‚Äòwill lose‚Äô election if he doesn't name Black female running mate

Guarantee Trump will schedule a speech or press conference as soon as it looks like Biden is about to announce. It's like clockwork. Anything to distract and draw the spotlight back on him. The media needs to pledge to ignore it, whatever it is
I just checked-so is Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi.

Look we all get it,economic hardship based upon phoney lockdowns IS the Biden campaign. It‚Äôs their only hope, your Hail Mary. Try not to pretend otherwise it‚Äôs transparent. Americans will decide if Trump or a frail old man losing his mind and selling tax hikes can restart economy
Interesting: if Biden would call for Postal Service banking (an excellent idea, IMO); that means that banking, check cashing, &amp; payday-loan interests have a very strong incentive to see the USPS demolished before Biden can be elected.
M4A &amp; GND are equally important to me. Biden has done nothing, but give us the finger on these...and many other...issues.

I mean you know I‚Äôm not particularly enthused about Biden but to pretend you can‚Äôt figure out what policies he‚Äôs running on when google is right there...
Ok so the point here was to bring up a question vaush has answered *extensively* in order to prove a point that has already been disproven?  Biden has moved left, a lot, thanks in part to Bernies massive, massive popularity.
I put the ‚ÄúTrump discount‚Äù in the polls at minimum 8 points.  So if Biden has a 4 point lead in FLA, he‚Äôs ahead by about 4. Biden camp knows this which is why they‚Äôre panicking on mail in.
Still not voting for Biden. Gooood luck.
Sigh.
And that‚Äôs to say nothing of the millions upon millions of recovered people with antibodies. Get the virus, move on.  Or hide under your bed for ten years.  We all know it: the lockdown IS the Biden campaign.
continue tommorow. Also his polls with women arent great   Idk if there's any truth to this:  Or   But i'd argue: it's good to tweet, what's the risk? You could turn people around who look you bitter currently. Do it, if team permits,
I do not want to vote for Biden. The Crime bill effected millions of people, including me, but what is happening to the USPS cannot continue. So I might cry while doing it but I  will add my vote.
Michelle didn‚Äôt want to be president or VP otherwise she would have been the choice. A lot of people see through Trumps shit now, we will fight and win in November. Biden literally could sleep and do less damage than Trump üôè
I disagree, Biden will be a 1 term president but he‚Äôll do fine. It‚Äôs why he won the primary by a land slide bedause he works between republicans and democrats where as no other candidate could.
I bet he is  a Biden supporter
There has been a lot of misery caused by your father the last 3 1/2 years. The best hope is the Biden DOJ will assign a special counsel to investigate the Trump crime family and the outcome will be a number of them will serve a prison sentence.
Biden makes Trump look like a idiot when it comes to real issues. Trump is only good at trolling.
Having a great accountant does not equate to being mentally incapable of remembering where you are Joe Biden.
So, here's the thing about Biden/Harris. Neither one has been great to the trans community: my friends, my family, myself. Obviously voting against fascists is good but I'm not excited about it. Duopoly systems are crap.
It's not journalists' job to do propoganda on behalf of a political figure or party - if it were, we would no longer be a free country. If one critical article is, to you, akin to a lynching or a coup against Biden, I think you may need to reflect on the skew in your perspective.
Ok hear me out.  Biden is part of the Demon Slayer Corps and that's why he sniffs people all the time.
Better question:  I wonder why Biden won‚Äôt take it!  üòÇ actually none of us is wondering that because we already know why he won‚Äôt take it üòÜ
Biden will tax your Cap Gains heavily. Your rebuttal?
But even then, *absolute* worst case in Florida is that an additional 2% of GE ballots miss the cutoff. So if those are 75-25 Biden it cuts his margin by 1%. But I'm skeptical 100% of the "last two days" ballots would not make it.
Jr recently accused Biden of having had two aneurysms, unprompted, out of the blue. Therefore, Sr has had two aneurysms.

Anyways vote for Biden now then "hold him accountable" when he gets into office, unfortunately elections are the only accountability moment for a president, but I dunno figure it out
Fox News said they don‚Äôt expect Biden to be around in Nov. They just had a feeling. And bc Trump likes to follow the dictators handbook, jailing his opponents seems like a natural next step. Fake a crime and have your cronies lock him up. Russia probably working on ‚Äúevidence‚Äù now
Not really, Hunter Biden isn‚Äôt president of the United States and doesn‚Äôt hold a political office. Trump absolutely does, Hunter is just a diversion Trump uses to keep his base from questioning him or holding him accountable &amp; it clearly works on some of his supporters ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

There is a reason Trump won‚Äôt show you his taxes while asking every other president to show them including Biden who happily did. It‚Äôs not Audits, it‚Äôs because it will clearly show the payments to his businesses from the US treasury üòé
How does Joe Biden argue against M4A in an interview yet in that same interview argues for it
Again, I agree, Donald Trump has to go. But I cannot vote for Joe Biden. The message that sends to other victims is too horrific to bear. In my anger, I nearly destroyed a friend. I may not be able to share their story, but I can refuse to accept Joe Biden.   10/10
I don't need to be reminded how horrible Donald Trump and the Republicans are, I'm well aware. We had many choices, Joe Biden was one of the worse. I hoped we would go with Bernie and fight for real change, so settle and get nothing for it.  5/10
Many have approached me about details about a friend I mentioned who was victimized by Joe Biden. I nearly told the story, which is not mine to tell, against the victim's wishes, out of anger. As much as I want justice, violating this person's trust ...  1/10
Killing civilians with drone warfare is a war crime. And why would I want Biden to hate Jews? I know you hate palestinians and Muslims but try to look past your hatred for a second
You are right. That is why we are voting for Biden.
You do realize that that is exactly what Biden and Harris are doing as well, right? They will do anything at all cost to win. That‚Äôs what is expected.
Me thinks triumphant profiles of Biden Campaign staff is premature.

Fucking love white people who totally forget the transformation X made after going to Africa talking to me because of the four memes they've read.   Do I think X would've liked Biden. NO.  Do I think he'd realize the threat Trump posed to the country. Absolutely.
He did if you voted for him, and Biden‚Äôs gonna lose anyway. The vote is going to be as messed up as it has ever been this year. Privilege is saying it‚Äôs okay to settle for four more years of the same while people die, ass
That's simply not true.  Biden and Harris have both been quoted as saying that they're for confiscations; not to mention their 100% Open-Borders and "*Free Everything" policies, which are patently absurd.  Take back the DNC from the socialists.
I used my real name on my original account and was doxxed for making some jerk in Vegas unhappy.
No, that's not what's being said at all. Example: medically vulnerable people I know will suffer greatly under trump, but their funds and access will expand greatly under biden (via ACA, which worked better for them) - it's not a catch-all but you can't say that's not better
If anyone on the Biden campaign can't figure out that Trump's insults against Harris are a way of baiting her into unnecessary responses which in turn elevate her overall visibility above Biden's... then they deserve what's coming next.
No, I'm not. I'm saying Trump is very very bad, may even ruin democracy permanently, but Biden, while having similar policies in some areas (not many) will give us time to fight for the agenda we all really want, without risking lives under trump
I honestly think there's nothing funny about Biden's cognitive decline and it very much should be something people should consider when casting their vote. One of many factors.
But this is okay???
You don‚Äôt have to be in mental decline with a fetish for sniffing kids to vote for Biden, but you have to be comfortable with someone in mental decline who likes sniffing kids to vote for Biden.
But like- didn‚Äôt Biden win Black voters in the primary?  What am I missing?
Facts what are your facts. I said he was a playboy. Biden has several, its a stupid argument . Has nothing to do with him doing his job. He was never in politics and never was arrested or charged for any
For me, not voting for the racist, rapist, conservative sociopath that is Joe Biden and his predatory prosecutorial side-kick who puts and keeps innocent people in jail for slave labor is a matter of sustaining my morality. I just disagree with justifying a rapist for POTUS.

You‚Äôre so full of shit it‚Äôs mind boggling. You just don‚Äôt want legal voters putting Trump back in office. You want widespread voter fraud to put dumb shit Biden in. The old man can‚Äôt even make an intelligent sentence. And you want him running this country?! No thanks Osama*.
I mean, he's giving speeches about exactly that:
Notice that the statement doesn't say you can't vote for the *party.  It says you can't support this *candidate without violating the faith.  And as much as I dislike the Biden ad, I agree with this assessment. To vote for Trump in support of his policies violates social doctrine
Normally I agree with you, Steve-O..... but not this time. Lesser of two evils voting is killing this country, one election at a time.   People forget there's a space to write a name in. And that there's more than just Trump and Biden running.
Why not arrest, prosecute, and imprison rioters as both Trump and Biden want?
GOP senator draws fire from all sides on Biden, Obama-era probes
Former VP Biden is a puppet. Rest assured that the people at the top of the Democratic Party who call the shots and write the bills will be the same whether he finishes his first term or not.
If her advisement to a hypothetical Biden administration is even slightly as flimsy as saying what she thinks Biden wants to hear or what it will take to earn more out of her political career, it defeats the purpose of having a female VP and also delegitimizes the admin
What a stupid strategy.   Biden must be incapable of unscripted thought and that's unfortunate
I'll admit, I don't know everything about Kamala, but what I've seen makes me question the integrity of the Biden campaign as a whole, even if they somehow manage to attain the presidency.
In today‚Äôs episode of #FauxNews the Trumpaganda machine reports that Obama doesn‚Äôt really support Biden, Kamala isn‚Äôt really American, and a vote for Joe is really a vote for Hillary.   Stop the nonsense. Don‚Äôt buy from Fox sponsors. #ByeHannity #HatefulEight #UnFoxAmerica
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Joe Biden was the architect of the 94 crime bill. Pretty racist if you ask me.
Just because other candidates running in the primary had better platforms doesn‚Äôt mean we have to pretend that Biden isn‚Äôt running on a platform that‚Äôll do a lot of good for a lot of people.
Nope. You're the victim of political narrative. Biden isn't creepy at all &amp; he's not "taking advantage" of anyone. It's as innocuous as a grandparent giving a simple hug. If there were any "creepy" intents there, there'd been at least a little effort to hide it from casual view.
Kamala Harris' comment with Stephen Colbert about "dropping bombs," on Biden repeatedly saying "It was a debate" And her refusal to pardon black men in prison saying that prisons would lose labor is a sign to me that she's willing to say whatever it takes to get what she wants.

So don't vote.   üòâ  If the turnout tanks no-one can claim they have a mandate.   If everyone shows up for Biden-Harris they'll have free rein.   They're each responsible for a huge part of the system we're fighting.   Individual votes aren't what decides elections.

The Ukraine thing was murky as hell, especially as Biden was clearly guilty of getting an absurdly high-end job for his shitheel, wastrel son.  The Post Office? Surely there's lots of Republicans who have strong feelings about this.   Maybe Pelosi doesn't think it's lurid enough.

There's no lie there. I agree that M4A and universal healthcare aren't completely synonymous; M4A is a form of universal healthcare. If a M4A bill passed both Congress and Senate, and Biden vetoed it, that is a direct action against universal healthcare.

Aren't you the guy who said something about Biden doing something harmful to democracy?
GOP with Trump is akin to an abusive partner intent on destroying your life. DNC with Biden/Clinton is akin to an abusive partner who secretly feeds Trump all the information and resources he needs to be an omnipresent threat in your life so DNC gets 'protective good guy' points.
Voting for Biden is your only choice. Don't dissapoint us.

You mean like Joe Biden?
A useful perspective on voting Democrat for president in 2020.  The Biden Bus does not go to the destination you're looking for, but the Trump Train goes in the complete opposite direction.  You're not marrying Biden, you're rejecting Trump. Vote, then move on with your activism.

Biden supported the crime bill and Harris is a prosecutor. Obama killed more Syrian children than tRump ever did. The reality is the opposite. You're privileged if you "settle" for Biden because their policies don't hurt YOU. They still hurt BIPOC people, though.
That's applicable to both Trump and Biden.
Ironic how Trump et al attack his foes with ad hominems that more easily fit Trump himself. "Crooked" Trump paying hush money to porn stars with election funds so they don't talk about where he "grabs them by". Biden may kiss babies,  but at least doesn't French them like Trump.
The difference between your argument and mine is that I'm admitting I dont like Biden but will take that personal L for the chance to build local movements and stop the immediate threat. You and your boy in the OP believe keeping Trump is a viable option.
I loved  until she participated in the media infomercial promoting Biden for weeks on end.   and media decided who got to win.
Biden has consistently through his career right up until about 5 years ago spoken against abortion rights and the hyde amendment. Trump, on the other hand, has made no significant strikes on it. Ironically, Abortion (and for similar reasons, legal marijuana) is safer under trump.
Where can I buy a "Biden / Harris 2020 - Fuck Your Feelings" t-shirt? Ideally one with an image of them flipping birds, to really piss off the Trump snowflakes

He has one of the most comprehensive environmental plans ever put forward by any candidate.
"The Biden Plan," a public healthcare option "like" Medicare that definitely won't add anymore complexity to the hellscape of insurance options and makes you eligible for tax credits if you make a certain amount of income to reduce your premium üôÉüôÉüôÉ
Unfortunate that he reserves those for only self-aggrandizement. What about the key traits of governing such as ethics, compassion, respect, service, et al? You know, those things that Biden has that Donald "Just about me" Trump only sees as obstacles to "winning"?
I'm not willing to concede that. My view just factors in harm over a longer timeframe than a single election. So even in a harm reduction sense, I don't see voting for Biden as being actual harm reduction.
If Biden/Harris win in November and power transfers without a civil war, we're just going to ignore that this has all demonstrated bigger problems than that transfer could solve, aren't we?

Which president would be more imperial, based on their record? Which president would worsen mass incarceration? You actually have to have an extremely narrow definition of the word to think it applies to Trump but not Biden
Incorrect. Right now, the only thing a third party vote will do is elect Trump. So, why not create more flexibility with Biden?
No, I'm not. I'm saying there's value to leftists, progressives in getting Biden over trump, and there are reasons being presented. I'm not watering anything down.
Again Biden was not my option. I do not like this ticket.  But I'm also not a spoiled child.
It would help the post office. Covid would at least have a unified response. No unmarked federal troops in major cities.  Biden has agreed to a okay amount of the green new deal. Just to name a few. Again to pretend that Trump = Biden is a losing argument, factually.

If Biden and Harris are for the ‚Äúradical left‚Äù why is it that all the leftists are attacking them as being part of the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù, too moderate, Trump Democrats, etc. It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre just slightly left of center and you‚Äôre making up desperate lies.

Libs will blame Trump for all the problems they /see/, but will make excuses for and/or not even see problems under Biden. They're comfortable under Democratic presidents

intent to stay or not. -to Biden's team, you know this is why you're in yourposition now reading teeetin your moment of time.
At the very least the Biden DOJ should keep its nose in Kushner ratfucking, any obvious bribery they can find, etc.
It seems very likely that a committed Biden DOJ could find all sorts of election/campaign finance/civil rights act laws being broken. But IDK if you want to prosecute govt officials for this, it does start to get dicey. Maybe it's the rationale for a reconciliation comission.

Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
You can see this in the pathetic campaign against Biden. He's senile &amp; he's a manchurian candidate for socialists. Kamala is a diss to the left because Wall Street but also a secret leftist Trojan horse. None of it makes any larger sense.
"Biden's team thought that picking Duckworth would help them crush Trump" is getting high on your own supply.  She ran behind Hillary Clinton in Illinois!
Yeah and they should hold all of them accountable even Obama and Biden!!!!
Seriously, we must get Trump out of there. I would vote for Voldemort before I would vote for Trump. Biden was never my guy, but he isn't a diabolical dictator, so there's that.

[Fox News] poll/ 49% of voters prefer Joe Biden, compared to 42% for Trump.
Nobody:  Pence: Under Biden and Harris Americans will no longer be able breath fresh air or drink tap water!  They are trying to take the atmosphere away from rural Americans!!!
We keep hearing that Biden will need a massive blowout victory to keep Trump from claiming victory on Election Night and trying discount the mail in votes as fradulent. If the Marist findings hold up, that will be virtually impossible.   Link to poll:   4/4
Right now he has a three-pronged strategy; 1. Barr's report on Obama/Biden/ on Russia, 2) Race/gender bigot dDog whistles against Kamala H, and 3) Cripple the post office.  This is enough for him to throw the results into chaos and a protracted court process. #resist

If Lenin was still alive and endorsed Joe Biden I would attribute it to senility.
Embarrassed that I listen to them and went and saw them live. Hopefully the money I donated to Kamala and Biden offsets this!
Biden's first move in office is to ensure funding for the USPS by doing away with social security
I'm a lifelong liberal but I can't help but worry that this election is not the time for advancing social causes. We have to get Trump out. Electability is the key. Biden's VP choice may help get Trump elected. It's time to appeal to mainstream America.
We all have a role to play in ensuring the Biden-Harris administration is as progressive as possible,  says in Friday keynote. #NN20 Wise words we should all heed. So beautifully said, as  remarked.
Oh, Biden wouldn't pardon Trump no matter what and Trump knows he's going to jail when he leaves the While House so he has absolutely every incentive in the world and nothing to lose to rig this election as hard as possible then try to appoint himself president for life.
The amount of times I have to reread things because it says Biden not bidet or vice versa is honestly astounding.
He was talking about white people who put their needs before the needs of black people.   If you cant see that Trump is objectively worse for black people than Biden you are being delusional.   Even a marginal step towards progress is better than allowing this idiot to continue
Joe Biden said No Malarkey‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. This wouldn‚Äôt happen in Biden‚Äôs America.

Can we do that while also not compromising a Biden presidency? I cannot do another 4 years of Trump
Really looking forward to hearing all the people who raged about federal LE being deployed to protect a court house explain how Joe Biden will enforce a national mask mandate.
Thinking voting for Biden is supporting biden rather than realizing the situation is a pretty simplistic take.
Can you please take over and be  President Biden now? Please
Yeah I'm not saying he would be hyped. Just saying he wasnt a child about important situations and decisions.   If he was in New York I dont think he'd vote Biden. But if he was in a swing state... I think you'd be surprised what an older malcolm x might've done.

Vote for Biden. You know the answer!
Leftists love to use empty suits...Biden case in point
I hope the American people will reject it, but I worry we won‚Äôt forcefully enough, and that Biden will concede.  On the other hand by November millions will be homeless and the social contract is all the way broken, so nothing left to lose.
Biden has one of the most aggressive climate change policies on the planet.

It is kinda pure Democratic Party that they wanted people to vote in person during the primary at the peak of COVID bc it favored Biden voters but now that Trump is manipulating USPS to do it they are throwing a fit.
If Biden was the POTUS, he would have had all the Intel and professionals to share the info regarding this. Meaning, Biden would have handled this virus like a boss, preventing a pandemic! Trump...... Failed miserably. How about that Mike? üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I get real nervous when so many radical leftist seem to be promoting violence. Then when already Harris is acting like a dictator. Keep her out it is not about Biden. They will probably eliminate him quickly like they did JFK.

More like Harris will have Biden killed so she can be the top of the ticket
Oh hey, I almost died from H1N1, but it only killed my financial future. Somewhere out there is a bill I'll never be able to touch while keeping a roof over my head, and that was all under Obama; Biden was there the whole time too, so nothing is gonna change anytime soon
Now that Biden has his VP pick it is 100% clear that whoever wins this election, we are all losing. Big time.

They both agree Biden sexually assaulted women
That‚Äôs kinda how Biden got the job from  Obama. He had some good points on  Obama during the debates. And Biden turned into Obama‚Äôs cheerleader when he was picked. Your fiercest opposition in the debat is usually someone who cares as much as you do. Those who care are good allies
I mean I'm gonna not vote for Biden, but it's not like I have to do that to own the Neolibs. They're getting constantly owned every single day. They think Pete Buttigieg is cool. That's so fucking sad I almost want to vote for Biden out of pity.

Honest question, what if you voted for Obama, and Hilary, and still plan on voting for Biden/Harris, but don‚Äôt like Harris due to her time as DA? Does that makes you a racist?
I love watching you talk about how great Biden is and how much of a lunatic Trump is...  You do realize backing a president who has had 160,000 American souls die on his watch... is probably political suicide.  #EndTheNightmare
If you see baggage, flawed, difficult, ambitious, just stop reading the article.   Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris even after she was mean to him on stage. That's something Trump and a lot of Twitter wouldn't do.

That's how you get Trump reelected splitting democratic votes away from Biden.
Pence has lost 165,000+ lives on his watch. Willing to take my chances on Biden/Harris.
Funny how Biden is smart and capable until he needs to be a confused old man who doesn't know what an Anarchist is. Love how y'all will give him the benefit of the doubt on this shit and have the nerve to mock the GOP for doing the same dumb thing. No thanks. I'm good.

BIDEN AND HARRIS are the traitors they serve corporate interests and never minorities or the working class. What they should be doing is muzzling the corporations and and empowering the working class. #Hawkins2020
Kamala Harris is a former police officer, and a member of the Establishment undemocratic party. She has never passed or supported the working class in anyway. IMPEACH BIDEN!
No. He literally said he wanted to prosecute people with my political beliefs like two weeks ago. Fuck Joe Biden. If the Dems think they don't need to reach out to the Left, that's their fucking problem. I'm not letting them threaten me with the GOP as an excuse to be lazy.
So during a time when everyone is screaming for criminal justice reform and police reform, Biden decides to choose Kamala Harris as his VP? This election really is going to hell in a hand basket.
It‚Äôs actually very touching, it‚Äôs about grief:  In the video it is 2 minutes in.
Excellent choice! I look forward to a Biden/Harris Whitehouse!

Oh STFU!! The stock market is NOT helping the average US Citizen. Nor is it reducing the death toll from Trump's incompetence!  Remember that in November folks! The stock market is much more important than you or your loved ones lives!   Biden gets my vote!
Honestly I will laugh my ass off if Biden chooses Buttigieg as his VP after all of this speculation. It would be the funniest, most plausible pick he could make that would piss of literally everybody and have exactly zero political ramifications for him.
Biden also has a back story that appeals. Following a fatal accident involving a wife and child he made a point of commuting each evening  to surviving sons from Washington and knew many passengers &amp; staff on Amtrak by name. I don‚Äôt know why but I feel it shows a decent man.

Don't know why we're stressing over Biden's VP pick, it's not like there are any good options there
Didn't watch it. No need to ever watch a Trump News conference ever again. I know it's filled with lies.   I will wait till January of 2021, when President Biden gives us a news conference!

So what you are saying is that the protests that are happening today under the Trump presidency would happen inder a Biden presidency.  In order to stop the protests that are happening with Trump as president will stop if Trump is re-elected.  Your logic is that of a grifter.

I agree. Ultimately it will be about building. In the USA there is a golden opportunity in November to make a big difference. It's a real shame Bernie isn't the one up against Trump. But let's hope Biden will shape up.
So much for my wager of "Joe Biden accidentally picks WWF's Kamala as VP"
I voted green in 2016, but I was in a solid blue state. I won't be this time. I'm all for us getting super leftist people elected, but we can't have 4 more years of trump, it's at least one more supreme court choice he gets.  I fucking hate Biden, but a blowout needs to happen.
Has anyone ever seen our nation so divided and sick before? Has anyone ever heard a president attack his opponents or other political party the way Trump has? It's unreal how terrible he treats those who are Democrat! Trump's buddies are just as vile. I cannot wait to vote Biden!
I'm voting for Biden, because he is going to save this great nation from the pathetic idiot that is destroying it. 160,000 dead, a Bankrupt nation, and the most divided this nation has ever been. All under Trump and his crime family.

Disagree. Biden made Obama palatable to white voters.  He got Obama to the WH.   Hillary should have chosen Bob Casey of PA.  Conservative D.  He would have gotten those extra votes in PA or MI.
Biden only needs to get 2% of the white vote (&gt; age 45) in six states (MI, PA, OH,FL, WI &amp; AZ. The only woman to poll positively in those states was Harris.
Trump is going to do as much damage as possible before he is evicted!   The damage is severe. Trump has literally destroyed this nation.   Biden! It's time to come out swinging!
I don't give a f$ck how hard Trump tries to make it for me to vote! I guarantee I will vote! Even if it means being in a wheelchair, hospital bed, or on a ventilator!   I will stand in line for the next 2 months if that's what it takes!! Biden will get my vote!

Trump is a vile racist. It's so obvious. Biden will literally heal the enormous damage Trump has inflicted on the race relations in this nation. I am literally voting for Biden, because I want the racist Trump gone.
Biden is so "Old School", it scares me.  We can't continue to move in circles where the only choices we have are "Old School" or a total outright "Idiot" like tRUMP.  We need progress toward "Common Sense" and a halt to "Slavery" once and "for all peoples".  Mark Charles in 2020.

Biden is suffering cognitive progressive failure and it shows in his speach and also in his ability to even have something written for him. Pitiful Biden plagiarized Reagan for his VP announcement.

This new ad only points out the truth and puts a bow on top. It‚Äôs hard to see how anyone could think Biden is anything but a snake oil salesman. I am a bit surprised that he chose Harris with her new ‚ÄòJoker‚Äô face- as in the character from Batman.
That‚Äôs kinda how Biden got the job from  Obama. He had some good points on  Obama during the debates. And Biden turned into Obama‚Äôs cheerleader when he was picked. Your fiercest opposition in the debat is usually someone who cares as much as you do. Those who care are good allies
Even of Biden did, he'd be lying.
Wow, you're not very informed, are you?  "I don't want my kids growing up in a racial jungle" Joe Biden, author of the Crime Bill, the Bankruptcy Bill, the Patriot Act. And the same man who was anti-choice and pro DOMA.  Get your head out of your ass and you'll see the light.

Never expected Biden to be playing 4D chess. Damn.
I am very disappointed. I thought the day Biden's crew announced their choice of VP candidate would give us a hint of their overall plan. Instead they chose an Jamaican/Indian woman not an African American woman with no plan for the future.
The main problem I have with leftists is their purity tests.  Anything less than Bernie‚Äôs entire platform is a no go.  With Biden, you get like 75-80% of that. It‚Äôs really up to the senate to dictate Biden‚Äôs agenda.
The same compassion Kamala showed when she was Too Cop and Biden showed when he wrote the Crime and Bankruptcy Bills? No, thanks.
I'm voting  Washington will carry for Biden/Harris with or without my vote. At least this will possibly strengthen some kind of opposition to Republicans and Democrats in the future. If this vote results in Trump's election so be it.

Is it just me or did  Biden just channel his inner "Ash Ketchum" &amp; summon his most powerful Pokemon?
Friendly reminder that Kamala Harris is a cop and Biden adding her to the ticket among increasing party division over a lack of progressive action is like police responding to police brutality protests with flashbangs and tear gas.
Still trying to use tactics from his 2016 playbook.  First nickname apparently didn't stick to Biden like it did with Hilary.  Now he's throwing out a lame nickname for Kamala.  Man-Baby is going down in November.
You know I won't. But I find this entire situation hilarious. It's a bold move for Biden and one that might actually work.
The Harris pick is strategic. It won't really drive away any of the "center-right" that have switched to Biden after realizing the dumpster fire of Trump. She has a political fanbase that it brings in, and so many progressives know that we have to vote this ticket no matter what.
First Biden, now Harris. The 2020 election is DOA.

I believe that Kamala Harris will be the VP pick because she is a weak willed Dem who will be easily controlled should Biden have to bow out of the Oval in 6mos leaving her as President. Rice is a traitor w her own agenda who won't be bullied by her own party.
Actually, we do. Billionaires provide jobs where the working class can work. You know jobs that provide money/security. Jobs that you/Biden are trying to take away.  Heard of that before?
Biden needs to be more Obama like, and inspire people to vote for him
What are you posing for? Question your own sanity if you follow Biden. He is a very troubled man. Be open to sane change not violent demonstrators that crazy Pelosi &amp; Schumer suport plus Socialism. Your Pose looks like Narcissism.
She never said that wasn't his intention. Her point was that the black vote doesn't belong to the . and that Biden should offer something more then not Drumpf to attract votes. You know that but you're just an entitled troll. McResistence.

Sounds about right. Fake news is detrimental to ppl's lives since they refuse to showcase the immediate decline of Biden then lie 24/7 abt everything else.  Looks like you gained 10 more lbs. Stress eating again?

Make no mistake their is something in the works that will try to save Biden plus they want the last laugh on conservatives. Itneeds to be investigated because he isn‚Äôt even qualified to run for President. Something is going on that none of us know about. Investigate please hearme
The greatest Biden virtue is his honestly and authenticity plus he has charisma
I thought it would disappear on 11/4  should the worst happen &amp; Biden steals the election. But then the Biden-Sanders manifesto came out where 7mill jobs would be lost. Makes sense that Biden (or whoever is running the Oval) would increase the #'s of CV cases &amp; close ...

Good God, we can see the problem with Biden without Russia's help.
Josh what will you trust more a Trump administration or a Biden cabinet with smart dedicated personnel. It‚Äôs more than just Trump/ Biden
No one has a plan that offers the least bit of certainty about what to do; not I, not you, or anyone else posting here. Joe Biden is also real quiet about any specifics, other than criticism.
I'm sure they're not, but I hope "democratic leadership" notices how Republicans are trying to paint Joe freaking Biden as the next Che Guevara.    You could run Mitt Romney against Trump and they'd call him a Marxist. It's no reason to not back actual progressives.
‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said so many times before, we‚Äôre in the battle for the soul of our nation, and President Trump‚Äôs decision today to profane God and to smear my faith in a political attack is a stark reminder of what the stakes of this fight truly are.‚Äù Joe Biden

This is good. Trump will see this and want to debate. And then Trump will self destruct in a debate against Biden.
Yes Biden should sign onto... checks notes... a bunch of slogans that don‚Äôt have a chance of passing even with a Democrat controlled senate.  Rightttt, you know Bernie ran on these policies and lost right?
Eight years of steady leadership and sensible regulation did more for prosperity than Bush's deregulation or whatever the fuck Trump's plan to the extent that he has one is.  This is why I vote for centrist mainstream Democrats like Biden, Obama, and Clinton.

By all accounts he‚Äôs been reduced to his so-called ‚Äúbase‚Äù. Provided all the sane people go out to vote, Biden should get a landslide.

No, I'm not. I'm saying Trump is very very bad, may even ruin democracy permanently, but Biden, while having similar policies in some areas (not many) will give us time to fight for the agenda we all really want, without risking lives under trump

The voters chose Biden. Turnout among progressives was abysmal, even in progressive states like Wa, California. I voted for Bernie, was very dissatisfied with the exit polls
Incorrect. Right now, the only thing a third party vote will do is elect Trump. So, why not create more flexibility with Biden?
No, I'm not. I'm saying there's value to leftists, progressives in getting Biden over trump, and there are reasons being presented. I'm not watering anything down.
Yes, this is known.   My argument is not for the ideology of Biden. It's for the functionality of a president that won't be breaking norms every day. I'm sure people can appreciate why this is important
I disagree.
Will admit tho that some of the Never Biden folks are pretty embarrassing even as somebody that generally agrees with the sentiment, some of them *kinda* seem to downplay the badness of Trump and suggest some uh... sus things for a progressive to say imo
I think the general idea is that whatever would come from a Biden Administration isn't significant enough to warrant particularly supporting him
There's lots of reasons to not like Biden. There's some good policies in there too, and with the added bonus that he isn't Trump, who defeated both the content and character of our country.   I agree with what was said about the Obama admin. Et al

Not all of it. There are important and immediate difference between Biden, Trump. For instance ACA, SC nominations, HHS funding, Pardons, Cabinet operations, Diplomacy, medicaid protections  Lots of these will have immediate effect for POC, Immigrants, Health Vulnerable people
When I said Biden is more electable, I meant to the broad swath of voters who turn out to elections, not just the people reading this thread.
Hey, I appreciate your passion but I'm talking about things in a different way.   My argument for Biden is that he's employing progressive people, and isn't trump. Additionally, I cannot see the damage in replacing Biden with Trump but I can see the damage of keeping Trump
However, Biden has a chance of winning and Hawkins has no chance at all. I'm not saying he doesn't have the better stance but it doesn't matter, electability is what matters
So the deal is to have employers ‚Äúdefer‚Äù payment of payroll taxes.  I hate to say it but it‚Äôs a politically genius move. The payments are delayed, and if Trump loses they return after the election and can be blamed on Biden/Harris. If Trump wins, he‚Äôll just lie it away.

It's not even close to the same, for a number of reasons. Biden is a warhawk, and he might be (yet unproven) an assaulter, but he didn't break the law in office - Trump literally has, and was impeached for it. He has done more too. It's hard to keep track of how bad it is now
No dude youre misunderstanding me. I'm saying: Trump and Biden are both bad on every policy dimension we can think of but trump is especially bad not because of policy, but bc of process. He isnt afraid to break the law and will keep doing so, in ways that can't be fixed.

What Kamala Harris and Joe Biden will need to reconcile
I‚Äôm crying rn...Biden-Harris speaking together ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª it‚Äôs beautiful. It‚Äôs eloquent. It‚Äôs relevant. It‚Äôs factual. It‚Äôs compassionate. It‚Äôs INCLUSIVE.
Well said. No one wants garbage, I want the progressive policy to happen, which is why I believe Biden is the only path where we will have the breathing room to exist long enough to elect someone.
Biden and Kamala are giving a press conference... the last 9 minutes Biden have been talking about Kamala and Trump ... Nothing about himself or his plans ...
Senator Harris isn't naive American... she is East Indian... poor Biden. He is confused
AZ wont cut it alone. He's got a great shot at 258 out the door (with MI and WI likely going Biden). AZ would put him at 269... which interestingly means if Trump won the rest of the toss-ups... they'd tie at 269.
Weird, I can‚Äôt imagine Dr. Jill Biden wearing a jacket that says ‚ÄòI REALLY DON‚ÄôT CARE DO YOU‚Äô or plagiarizing Michelle Obama‚Äôs speeches.

I call bullshit. Biden didn‚Äôt Inform anyone until the day before the announcement. Otherwise, we would have had leaks a long tome ago.
He should -and he should confront the shit out of Trump with every lit he‚Äôs said and hammer him straight into the floor. I‚Äôd start with, ‚Äòso you must really love the Obama/Biden policies become you‚Äôve been taking credit for things WE passed like they‚Äôre your own‚Äô.
Get a free Biden-Harris sticker
I'm not saying those are the two choices. What if, by choosing Biden, and therefore gaining time, progressives get a chance to win office and start the process of moving towards what we want? That would not be dying slowly. That's what I want.
And btw, a vote for anyone other than Trump is a vote for Biden...  See how that shit works both ways?  #GreenParty2020
I didn't say I don't see it. I said that trump will make it worse, much worse, than Biden. We keep spiraling around this over and over. Would you rather take 5 steps back, or 25?
The propaganda is that Trump and Biden are the same. Neither are good but trump is many times worse and will make the progressive agenda harder to achieve for decades to come
Wouldn‚Äôt 2024 be when Biden is up for re-election if he wins in 2020?

Biden is a placeholder.  He won't go on to be the acting president - if he were even elected, which he won't be!
Trump has done more in criminal justice reform than Biden and Harris combined.

Harris wants U.S. to give Americans $2,000 a month during pandemic, a contrast with Biden‚Äôs measured approach
Absolutely. Biden is a spineless pile of jelly and his administration can be made to enact progressive policy. The administration that‚Äôs building increasing fortification around the White House and emboldening far-right militia types is prepared to kill Americans to retain power.
A Biden/Harris administration does need progressives to fight it, but can still be fought with the tools of voting and activism. A Trump administration that no longer fears being removed politically has catastrophic violence as its only outcome.
Picking Harris, Biden puts centrist stamp on Democrats' future
Make calls, write letters, discuss issues, and take the streets. Never let anyone forget for a second that Donald Trump and Joe Biden are both racist rapists. Disturb anyone gets comfortable.  Be worth more than your vote, and you will have my support.
So you say you don't want Biden/Harris?
Again, vote Biden to get rid of Trump, then keep righting for progressive policies. Trump is far more dangerous than left/right differences
I get that people have legit concerns with both Biden and Harris. I really do. But I would rather vote for a sack of moldy potatoes than Trump, so can we just get this whole thing over with already?

If Biden had picked a white dude as his running mate, would we be going all in exploring his ethnicity like people seem to be doing with Harris?
Nobody believes a word that you say so why would we care what you think about creepy Joe Biden?
That is most true, and I will do everything in my power to help Biden and her win.
Biden should challenge him to walking down a ramp, drinking out of a glass, word pronunciation, riding a bike, answering a question without going off topic and babbling incoherently. It would be humiliating for trump.
And I'm stuck thinking about Biden's history of sexual assault, and I'm stuck with all those racist quotes swirling through my mind. It's been less than a week since he was in the news for saying something racist!  And I also know what Trump is. The whole situation just stinks.
And because the average person isn't paying close attention and doesn't have a long memory, that choice‚Äîboiled down to gender and (vaguely) race‚ÄîHarris' VP pick status will inform the general impression of Biden's stance on gender and race.
Putting aside Biden v. Trump for a moment...  Biden had to shift toward the left to stay competitive in the primary. The hope I keep hearing from progressives is that they'll be able to put pressure on him to achieve their goals.  Picking Harris for VP doesn't inspire much hope.
Neither Biden nor Harris are good people. But they also still share political allegiance with good people who are willing to try and fix things, so having them in power makes it easier to vote in/ empower those good people. Useful change is possible even if  they don‚Äôt want it.

It is true, Biden confirms.
What to Know About Kamala Harris, Joe Biden‚Äôs V.P. Choice
‚ÄúOne is not to the exclusion of the other‚Äù Don‚Äôt be a Foggy Bottom f*cker and deny that we aren‚Äôt all one heart in this together. üéµüé∂ - inspired by Kamala üòÅ #quotes (loosely lol) #KamalaHarrisVP #YouGotThis #BidenHarris #Biden #Biden2020 #BidenHarris2020 #futureisbright#LastWord I  would love to wake up the morning of November 4, 2020 and find out Biden/Harris won by the biggest landslide in history. The last landslides went to a crook and a pirate it‚Äôs our turn!
Nope. You're the victim of political narrative. Biden isn't creepy at all &amp; he's not "taking advantage" of anyone. It's as innocuous as a grandparent giving a simple hug. If there were any "creepy" intents there, there'd been at least a little effort to hide it from casual view.
Ironic how Trump et al attack his foes with ad hominems that more easily fit Trump himself. "Crooked" Trump paying hush money to porn stars with election funds so they don't talk about where he "grabs them by". Biden may kiss babies,  but at least doesn't French them like Trump.
Unfortunate that he reserves those for only self-aggrandizement. What about the key traits of governing such as ethics, compassion, respect, service, et al? You know, those things that Biden has that Donald "Just about me" Trump only sees as obstacles to "winning"?
We have never had such a corrupt President that is backed by a corrupt Senate and Attny General and friends.Biden needs to put many laws in for protection against this ever happening again.
Schumer, pelosi and Biden all voted for the 2005 bill, you realize that right?
I don't know what the rest of y'all think, but Trump looked a helluva lot slower coming down that ADA-approved ramp at West Point &amp; lumbering around the golf course, than Biden does biking, etc. It's clear Joe is more fit than "Snuffleupa-Trump".
Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake  via
Nonsense, what Pres Trump actually said was, he just heard the claim before the news conference.  He went on to debunk the idea by saying undoubtedly the Biden campaign had checked it out.  Fake news
We can safely assume this guilty FBI lawyer has been cooperating with prosecutor Durham to nail senior officials in the Obama-era CIA, FBI, DNI and main Justice.  If Biden is elected, though, all this will be in vain.
The Biden campaign should start putting out national advertising how voters should vote, when they should vote, and that they need to turn their ballots in by the middle of October.
Ahh I can see that. I was thinking of it as a binary (Trump v Biden)...but you are right...maybe a Bernie supporter who votes for Biden but still is disappointed (but would be furious if Trump won). Thanks for that perspective!!

Joe Biden could have picked Jeff Luhnow as his running mate and it wouldn't have sent me to vote red.  Or, an actual alligator. Or, something not alive.

What happens when Biden loses in 2024 and another republican comes in and revokes all this again?
Okay but imo it doesn‚Äôt matter that trumps plan is worse if Biden‚Äôs plan doesn‚Äôt actually stop the impending disaster. If you were building a levee and your two options were ‚Äúno levee‚Äù and ‚Äúlevee that looks good but won‚Äôt stop the flood‚Äù I feel Iike you‚Äôd look for other options
As you say, Biden will have to spend a lot of time fighting just to get these incremental changes so why not actually go for the whole thing? He‚Äôs cutting himself off at the legs by starting out with a plan that wouldn‚Äôt be enough if it did go off without a hitch, which it won‚Äôt

Ok. So Biden makes multiple racist remarks in the last few weeks and you're willing to overlook them because Trump mispronounced some words and some 40+ year old controversy?  Got it.

We are addressing Biden's racist statement from this past week. He has a habit of this. Your response is to ignore it and bring up a 40 year old Trump story? Typical, hypocritical leftist.

The post office hasn't failed. But if they haven't the money to carry the mail reliably and promptly, then it's Mr. Trump's job to get the money. He is the Executive branch of the government. Making sure USPS works well is his responsibility. Biden can do that job if Trump won't.

You don't have to be crazy about a candidate. You don't have to agree with all of their policies and record. You just have to believe that the country would be better off with Biden than with Trump. Biden may not get us all the way there, but he's a step in the right direction.
While I am no longer a supporter of Trump(or Clinton,Biden, any Dem or Rep) this is a true statement about the last 4 years. So rudely cut off by a virus that media won‚Äôt stop scaring us with.

You want to investigate Biden fine let‚Äôs investigate Ivanka &amp; Jared they make millions from several countries. So what Biden made $50,000 a mo. from Ukraine he did nothing wrong what are the Trump children doing. Check one check all.  They are just as wrong
You mean Biden right?
You're putting a lot of words in my mouth. I despise Trump and want him gone for all the same reasons as you. If the left wants to use their power they should fracture the party right now and replace Biden. Vote blue no matter who will back anyone right?
Biden is likely the 1st. candidate for POTUS that can't count backwards from 20 by 3... a test for stage 4 Alzheimer's.
Not just the repubs. Biden has been trying for 40 years to gut both programs.
A third candidate only helps Trump if you assume my vote belongs to Biden. If everyone who is swallowing the bitter Biden pill refused to do so, they would replace him because they wouldn't have the numbers. Towing party line is throwing your vote away.

Bush created the DHS and ICE and illegally invaded a country and killed a million people. Biden brags about writing the Patriot Act. Trump is a fascist but he's using the tools they created.

I not only strongly suspect Biden &amp; Kamala are not only willing to sell their very own arses to corp USA, for a few $'s more, they'll even toss in their Grandma's, then I fully agree! Other than that one little flaw, I suspect, given the chance, Kamala will  be a great President.

But covering it fairly or misrepresenting facts and twisting it to look as though trump is bad and it was all Biden's doing, I'll never trust the msm ever again
Yes absolutely!!  We need to start taking steps to control this disease!  Hopefully Biden/Harris have already started on a plan to attack this thing! (Given Trump doesn't cheat his way back)

Biden and Harris are gonna scare many people into changing there votes. Thats fine with me President Trump is going to win in November!!! #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
That‚Äôs a contortion, yes. But the presidential election is binary at this point, and given my options, I‚Äôm thrilled to vote the much lesser of two evils. Trump aspires to dictatorship. He must be voted out of office. Biden describes it as an ‚Äúinflection point;‚Äù it is.
Idk, i had no idea Biden has an unscalable wall on his property. Oh, it‚Äôs scalable? Ok, so he‚Äôs doing it more for personal use on his own property, and not as a deterrent against immigration to protect an entire fucking country. Maybe trump should invest in a moat as well, lol
Personally I think we‚Äôre looking at just that. There are no good candidates. What Trump has going for him is that he‚Äôs the evil we know.  Biden is a moron and Harris had already shown Shek Day or do anything to further her political aspirations. Everything is scary.
You're delusional if you honestly believe Biden will be worse than Trump on race issues.
If you really want to get down to the brass tacks as to why Trump is president it's because of the candidate they put up again. Had it been anybody but Hillary Trump would not have won. Blame the DNC for why Trump is in office. And they very likely did it again with Biden.
Once Biden is elected sure!
You‚Äôd think Biden would‚Äôve checked that before he asked her to join the ticket.

You can thank the Democrat party for that.  Make sure you run out and vote for Biden in Nov if you like this.
Then you're voting for a fraud, who is Indian and Jamaican, not African American, called Biden out for his racism not long ago, and literally had ancestors who owned slaves to which there are records proving it. Way to set us all back.
Remember that Biden was VP before he won the presidential nomination.
82% of Trump's lawyers will be gone when Joe Biden wins!! Thank God!! Hey Rudy, did your boy call the bat cave? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I will still pay attention but if Biden is president I won't open Twitter every morning scared of what I'm about to read. And that I'm very much looking forward to.
That would be Trump. Senator Byrd was involved in the KKK throughout much of the 1940‚Äôs. He was a Senator who‚Äôs length of service in the US Congress is 2nd only to the late Rep John Dingell. He later denounced his time with the KKK. People grow and learn.
That‚Äôs a really big if. Biden doesn‚Äôt even support nuking the filibuster as of yet.
How do you think they get the money? They‚Äôre expected to keep their promises to their donors. If Biden‚Äôs promise was ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change,‚Äù or something like that, he‚Äôs expected to keep it.
When did I say I wasn‚Äôt voting Biden? Or are you assuming something?  I‚Äôm allowed to have my criticisms. Now shush.
Hoping  has a place for him in the Biden/Harris Administration!
This article from 2019 indicates Joe Biden ‚Äúhad quietly indicated that he would almost certainly not run for a second term while declining to make a promise.‚Äù Is that still the case?
Fox News' Jeanine Pirro Tries To Walk Back Ominous Prediction About Joe Biden #SmartNews
I don‚Äôt see her running for that immediately. It would be bad optics and would look like she‚Äôs running against Biden.
You do realize trump is running against Biden not Harris right?
Also we can have our differences of opinion on where she would be best at.   I‚Äôm sure wherever she goes (or stays), she‚Äôll make the most of it.  Just expressing my disappointment that Biden probably won‚Äôt want a fierce advocate for everyday people to be a part of his admin.
Not me, thankfully.  I do have a couple of kids who've bought into the "Trump and Biden are the same!" line.
She could say she helped Biden directly to fix everything.
High key I don‚Äôt think Biden is even going to nominate Warren for Treasury Secretary.  I‚Äôm becoming more convinced she‚Äôs going to be completely shut out of his administration because it‚Äôs what his corporate donors and the powers that be want.

Electing Joe Biden President of the United States of America... has help for the handicapped gone to far?
Yes we are... and we‚Äôre allowed to be in our feelings. I personally am still committed to voting for Biden, so I don‚Äôt need to be tone policed.
No one said that they didn‚Äôt want Biden to be president.
The world is already laughing. Our country has already collapsed.  Unfortunately, Joe Biden isn't President...
Mr.Biden.Look at Thermo Fisher they are an American company making strides with making tests and leading the way in agribusiness could be an agriculture Secretary in there!! But definitely testing contracts
Guess who showed up to vote in SC, and put Biden on the top of the ticket? Guess who's on TV sharing their opinions freely and succinctly? I can find a lot of material to support my contention.
I wonder if that comment made by  could be construed as a veiled threat towards VP Biden to do him some type of harm? Or to trigger a unstable Trump supporter to follow through? Is the Secret Service going to follow through on this? If not why not? America is asking
Biden is right.  Wearing masks is about our responsibility to use whatever means necessary, however imperfect, to protect each other in times of crisis.  The people shrieking that their freedom is infringed by such a slight inconvenience are just selfish crybabies.
I'm a Biden-Harris supporter tired of the ultra lefty sore loser bullshit trying to split the Dem ticket.   Trump is an existential threat to all POC and women who choose not to be baby factories.   People who don't think that's enough of a reason to vote Biden are human garbage.
We‚Äôll see. Biden might just kowtow to his corporate donors‚Äô wishes and advisors like Larry Summers, just like he did with his VP pick.
I never said he was perfect. You think Trump is pro-environment? Biden may not be the best on that count, but he's a hell of a lot better than Trump.
Just stop. Biden is far from the answer to the problems in the US. FAR from the answer. But we all know fascism is absolutely a non-starter. Overt racism is a non-starter. Trump is a non-starter. We can work with a guy like Biden.
And my argument is Biden offers NOTHING. rally republicans to vote for him, because that's basically what he is. Shaming people who don't have healthcare to vote for someone who won't try and fix that ain't it.
Why does the virus have to be gone by election day in order for Biden to win? I don't follow your logic.
Not a fan of Harris because of her policies in the past, but I gotta say I‚Äôm impressed that Biden chose a woman of color as his running mate. I‚Äôm not going to let my reservations prevent me from voting blue (it never has before, and it especially won‚Äôt now)

Biden is a puppet of communist China
i‚Äôve been seeing (including the media) call her a cop, so i literally assumed she was a ‚Äúcop‚Äù so mb on that part! as much as we all wanted a woc vp (or anyone else other than harris &amp; biden for the dems) we‚Äôre all in agreement that she was a destructive choice.
I think we need to employ the same tactics to get a change in ALL the old guard in D.C. On both sides of the aisle, they're all just as corrupt and loonie as Biden.
Had to mention Biden‚Äôs plagerism. Just threw it in there.üôÑ
I didn't give you Biden but I will vote for him. He has a plan to battle coronavirus and will be a leader of the USA, not a dictator-wanna-be. And he won't be for sale to Russia, North Korea, or China.
I was alarmed about the Pelosi potentially becoming President portion mess.  I don‚Äôt support Biden or Harris for political office though &amp; it has nothing at all to do with their race, color of skin, or citizenship, origin of birth...I just don‚Äôt agree w/ their policies
So you're planning to leave the country? Because that's the only way you will not wind up under the leadership of either Biden or Trump.
He may be able to defund it but Biden will bring it back. Lol
Me, too. With the caveat that he‚Äôs the one on the ticket we can most hold accountable. Womxn‚Äôs Marches, anti-kids in cages rallies, &amp; BLM protests MUST continue if Biden wins. Things aren‚Äôt different bc of a Dem President. We can‚Äôt let up until we get what we want: Better lives.

Ah, so Biden is comparable to Dahmer or Manson. Gotcha. But it's going to be him or Trump. If I had to pick Dahmer or Manson to watch my dog, I just wouldn't leave my dog. But the only way you get to not live under the leadership of POTUS is to leave the country.
So what's your suggestion? We get either Biden or Trump come January. If you really don't care which one wins, I don't know what to tell you. Let 40% of the country make your choice, I guess.

Most people only read the headlines. Personally, i get a kick of conservative articles freaking out about things that don't exist, like Biden and Harris being Marxists. Hilarious!
Who would you trust to watch your dog? Trump or Biden? Pence or Harris?
I'm blocking every single person who claims to be a progressive and is criticizing the Biden-Harris ticket. Sorry, there's one shot against #45, there are zero other choices, so fuck right off.
The people rejected Medicare for All at the ONLY place that it mattered: the election, and chose Biden.  The problem with polls, is that they can lead people to make choices they won't support at the polls. QED.
The Russian and Trump BOT army has been set loose with the Biden/Harris news yesterday. It is only going to get worst from here on out. To bad Jack/Twitter won't do anything about it.
If Biden doesn't get elected the SCOTUS will be incredibly skewed toward the right for the next 20 years. He can't do 2 terms, he's too old.
We've been trying to do that for 200 years.   Not gonna happen before November. In 81 days, this country will choose the people who take the oath in January. It will be either Biden or Trump. You can make your voice heard, or let others choose for you.
It's kind of amusingly universal -- they all think they're criticizing Harris and Biden, but every time they just name reasons I'm eager to vote #BidenHarris2020.
so Joe you selected a ex-Senator of state that's losing their taxpayers to the state of Texas. So... a senator that doesn't know how to fix the homeless as vp and a ex-vp, Biden, that did nothing for the economy for 8 years; lovely....
Very good point. It will take decades to get back on track, so we can move forward as a better country. Biden and Harris will not fix all but they are a foundation to prevent future trumps and a foundation to save this world.

I wrote in a candidate in 2016. My state is solidly Dem, so I felt safe doing it as I was "voting my conscious" but as it became clear T was winning election night, I regretted my choice for fear even my state would not go as usual. I will vote Biden/Harris this time.
I feel like the massive shaming of people who have legitimate concerns about Biden-Harris is disproportionate to the number of people who won‚Äôt vote. But I may be wrong.
I have a suspicion that most people on the left criticizing Biden-Harris are probably still going to vote for them. But I‚Äôll take a poll anyway... if you are a leftist who is critical of the Dem ticket, will you still vote for them?
A little advice for you...you should never go on TV and speak immediately after Biden, and especially never after Kamala.  It just magnifies how fucking stupid and low-energy you truly are. You should fire whomever in your campaign set that up. #douchebagnchief

And lets walk this through... What are you afraid of specifically if you were to cast a vote for Biden and Harris?
To what extent could a Biden administration retroactively fine/enforce/prosecute these crimes?
Great. But we're still going to wind up with either Biden or Trump at the helm come January.
What did Biden say here that wasn‚Äôt true?  He did say this. The Charlottesville group is at best antisemitic. Trump did call them very fine people. Do you not think Trump is racist with all he‚Äôs said and done in the past?
It's amazing the way Idiot Trump buys into the Radical Right. I mean, just look at our nation right now under Trump! It's insane what is happening!! How can anyone say this nation is great under Trump? We are sick, divided, and bankrupt. Biden gets my vote!
If Biden/Harris win, I want to see the Womxn‚Äôs Marches continue on Washington, the BLM protests continue, and the rallies to free kids from cages keep going. Our lives still won‚Äôt be better, but they‚Äôll at least have a chance to be.
We are a safe blue state, it‚Äôs true, so we can protest vote. The. The bigger conversation for us in WA is beyond who our presidential vote will be. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat are each of us doing to hold Biden accountable, hold Trump accountable, and how can we keep that going in 2021?‚Äù
I've now heard 3 R's bring up the Harris/Biden debate saying that she was mad bc he supported bussing.  But... she was saying he was against bussing.  They don't even know what the controversy is.  Neither do voters.  This issue is not a big deal.
Never forget Biden said this during a worldwide pandemic.
Well I know FOR SURE Biden won't so what's the difference?
Joe Biden texts me more consistently than any boyfriend I've ever had
But you can't. You will wind up in either of the other two places. We will have either Biden or Trump. Who is even running for Green this year anyway, and what have they done to consolidate political power since 2016?
Edit... *former readers Also, there is no ‚Äúassuming‚Äù the attempt. This pathetic birtherism opinion published THE DAY AFTER Biden names Kamala Harris as his running mate? Your former readers aren‚Äôt that stupid. It is what it is.
You don't get those choices. We will inaugurate either Biden or Trump in January. There is no other possibility.
How credible? As credible as the Biden accusers because I highly doudt that.
Is he working for the Biden campaign?
At least Trump has his ego getting in the way.  Biden will have no idea what's going on also, but his team of lobbyist handlers are supremely adept at evil.
#BernieOrBust wasn't a threat, it was a reality.  Nothing Bernie himself could say, never mind your privileged ass, to make anything about Biden appealing to voters that matter, not you or me, but people who've never voted in their life because they're too busy just surviving.
You just don't get it.  Trump is a symptom of a bigger disease.  Putting up shitlibs like Biden IS WHAT MAKES TRUMP RELEVANT.
‚ÄúWhenever I see a black person I start screaming ‚ÄòJoe Biden is a communist!‚Äô until I feel better.‚Äù ‚Äìcons, probably
I pick Trump then.  I'd prefer to let him golf for another four years while we elect downballot progressives and topple statues, you know... reshape society on our own.  Biden would only codify everything done by Trump so far and wage war after war after war.
I did vote for Clinton in '16 but it took my husband reminding me how guilty I would feel if she somehow lost our typically safe blue state. This year I'm excited to vote against Trump and know how much better Biden/Harris will be
Explain how the real world outcomes of a Biden Admin wouldn't be even worse.  Trump has started zero new wars and only overthrown one democracy.  Biden:
But we can't. That's not an option. Trust me, we'll get either Biden or Trump. So in your eyes, we either go 3 or 20 miles backwards. And people like me will make that choice for you. Running for POTUS isn't building political power.
Healing America from the destruction of the current administration needs to begin with a vote November 3rd for Biden/Harris.
They need to earn your vote as much as they need to work to earn mine.  But don‚Äôt go off about how the system hasn‚Äôt changed and nothing‚Äôs getting any better if you don‚Äôt vote the way that gets us closest to that change.  End of the day, Trump/Pence ain‚Äôt it. Biden/Harris is.
I, too, want to dismantle the system that forces us to make those choices and makes a third party impossible.  But we haven‚Äôt done that yet.  And refusing to vote Biden/Harris in 2020 doesn‚Äôt get us any closer.  So if you refuse to vote Biden/Harris, fine. That‚Äôs your right.
So I‚Äôm voting Biden/Harris because with the wins in the House and potentially the Senate we CAN and WILL hold Biden accountable for every vote, every veto, and every policy.  People forget progressives needed 5 seats to shift the axis of power to the left.
I‚Äôm gonna loss some followers, I‚Äôm sure, but here we go:  After sitting with it for months. After watching secret federal police kidnap protestors in Portland. After watching people I love suffer under #COVID19 layoffs and unemployment.  I‚Äôm voting Biden/Harris. 1/

You claim we'll have a "depression" if Biden is President instead of you being president. We're in one now, you idiot. And you are the cause. Your failure, your incompetence, has us in a depression. But you're too stupid to realize that.
I know thats right! Fun him into the ground girl! Dump trump!üíØ biden/harris is the future
It will be either Biden or Trump. There is no other possible outcome. Why didn't your preferred candidate get on the ballot in one of the two major parties? That's how to get the bus you want. Duverger's law.
I'm old enough to remember when we were told the Democrats were justified in nominating centrists like Biden &amp; Harris because the GOP wouldn't be able to smear them as socialists/communists.
So my take on this is that both candidates seek to be President but Trump is relaxing on the train letting others do the work as he coasts along in his comfortable life, while Biden is labouring and doing all the work himself without the glamour and comfort... Trump own goal!

I won't have to repost it. I have a huge list of biden's crap that I will post until election day. Facts are not attacks.
I'd crawl over broken glass to vote for the BIDEN/HARRIS ticket in November. Thankfully I won't have to b/c we do all mail in voting here in Washington State.
Great speeches from BIDEN/HARRIS. Very inspiring. I‚Äôm ready to vote now! #BidenHarris2020
Biden is just before the Boomers. Kamala is the last of them.  Why does it matter?
People out here supporting Biden and Harris with BLM filters on their profiles. You‚Äôre ignorant and/or fake party line fools just virtue signaling. Do everyone a favor and just don‚Äôt vote, it‚Äôs obvious you don‚Äôt pay any actual attention.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Still gonna vote for Biden/Harris but we need to know what she‚Äôs about just as much as Biden.   We cannot allow this to go unknown.   Also I‚Äôm really tired of everyone seeing this and going ‚Äúwell are you gonna vote for Tr*mp then?‚Äù No! Get your head out of your ass.
Had to turn it off in the car ü§ÆBiden is the biggest racist around  the Democrat Govenors who shut down our state are the reasons why our economy is bad!  Biden can‚Äôt stand his VP pick, as noted by his comments last year. What a üé™üòÇüòÇ#MAGA2020LandslideVictory üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Sure, I'll play. A vote for Biden is a, "I am willing to condone evil and make justifications why it must be done."
Biden could have picked Sarah Palin, and the republicans would still bitch whine complain and cry in their covfefe. Lol
So I turned off Biden and his lies only to now hear my useless  is giving illegals covid relief!!! WTF
The donors picked Kamala Harris. You don't have to remind Biden of that.
Tell me, what would go forward if Biden wins? Medicare-for-all? No. student loan forgiveness? no. Cannabis legalization? no. Doing what the Republicans want? of course.
13:45 PDT The Staples Singers, "I Know a Place," album version, playing now. Camera zooms into the lectern adorned with Biden Harris logo.
Yes, Biden is obviously just another senile old pussygrabbering mental image of tRump!
I suspect Biden won't finish his 1st term, &amp; Kamala Harris ( The rigid cop who Self-hates other African Americans, &amp; Asians) will become president of the US~ Ergo, EF Biden, I'll #VoteForBernieSanders !
Drinking game: Look for a non-white person at Biden/Kamala event. Drink when you see one. Journalists don‚Äôt count!!
Lindsey Graham for Joe Biden :)
Equating Trump and Biden is a privileged idea because they‚Äôre saying it would not make any difference to them one way or another.. completely disregarding that Trump is a real danger to many on multiple levels. Preventing progress for the sake of political perfection is dangerous
For real though you have to vote for Biden.
A middle finger to Bernie. A middle finger to Warren (though, i'm sure she'll have a spot). A middle finger to what is really happening in America right now when people are calling to defund the police. Biden wrote the crime bill. Biden and Harris are pro-police.
not only sexist, as with 2016, but you are also a racist.  She's better than Biden. Biden's better than Trump. No one should vote for Trump. If we have to go back to the status quo, we go back to the status quo, but this is a big middle finger to the progressive left.
This is exactly what the democrats want. When Biden said months ago that his VP would be a woman of colour, that's identity politics, and is used as a weapon against the white supremacy/misogyny of Trump.
People are questioning if Harris is "black enough". Imagine if someone stated Biden wasn't white enough. I mean, it is an outrageous statement to question whether someone is truly the colour of their skin....
America is racist... what‚Äôs your point? We all know who we DONT want. I‚Äôd vote for a dog over trump. So, happy to have Biden/Harris 2020 in a two party system.
Google is your friend. Joe is NOT a friend of the Earth.
I think that Joe Biden would have done better to pick Val Demings Karen Bass, or Susan Rice Anyone of those 3 women would have been a much better choice. I consider Kamala Harris bad baggage!
Between having Biden and Harris safely in the White House, and Kirschner (more than) competently running DoJ, I might actually be able to sleep again at night.
You were right yesterday when you asked if Biden could make a bad choice. Val Demings, Karen Bass, Susan Rice any of the 3 would have been better. Harris is just bad baggage!
Great analogy. I‚Äôm catching the Biden/Harris bus üöå #BeepBeep #BidenHarris2020
If Biden wins, we need to learn Chinese :(
Ayo its really 100 reasons to critisize Biden but they create a lie so they can get right to the racism every time lmao
Don the Con started strong... Then ended last!! Some highlights of Don the Cons work!  * A divided Nation. * A deadly pandemic. * Half the nation out of work. * A nation on the brink of Bankruptcy.  This is why I am voting for Biden/Harris!
These are the same people who support defunding the police   A vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for socialism
June Cleaver would vote Biden/Harris!
What are you doing if Joe Biden tells you you ain‚Äôt black üò≠üòÇ
And even with a teleprompter and notes Biden can‚Äôt put a sentence together lol.
Let's re-phrase that slightly....Biden/Harris is 12 points ahead.
9 year old account with 109 followers. Looks like the Biden bots have moved over from correct the record. Same pay scale?
Yur more afraid of her than U are of Biden,All yur below the belt negativity won't work on her,She,We all expect racist inuendos+ rhetoric from U,Yur a desperate man who will lie+make up numbers!She is gonna make U slip up! She's gonna make ya look like what UR,A LIAR+A RACIST
Yea i definitely feel ya man. I voted for Thor Odinson in 2016 but will vote Biden in 2020 simply because we cannot afford another 4 years of the Trump. RBG certainly won't last another term and likely Breyer as well. Thomas could retire and be replaced by a younger conservative.
Your attempt at humor during this horrible pandemic isn't funny at all. Biden clearly is NOT in his basement. He is following health safety protocols, unlike you idiots.
So the Black Voices for Trump Coalition is one black lady sandwiched in between two whites? I think the people you speak of are storming the Biden Harris bus across the street.
The left: "Biden/Harris are just cops!"  The right: "Pee pads &amp; knee pads 2020 trololol!"  Me: "I hate this ride let me off."
Biden could have picked Sarah Palin, and the GOP would still bitch whine complain about her
It's only a reality if you make it one. The DNC has ARMIES of people repeating the lie that there are only 2 people running and we MUST vote for sexual predator Biden and cop Harris. Just say no.
Just stop. A vote for DT is a vote for DT. A vote for Biden is a vote for Biden. Just admit you are fine with being a corporate puppet. Nothing wrong with that . But STOP with the "we only have 2 candidates" BS. It's just not true.
I think an important consideration is if you are in a swing state. I‚Äôm in WA, for example, which‚Äôll go Biden no matter what so I‚Äôm freer to write in/abstain. In a swing state, I would say voting for Biden has more importance/usefulness.
It's not a sane choice when Biden was INSTALLED by rigging the primary. I will NOT vote for cheaters, nor sexual predators and liars.
Must have missed his state of the unions. Amazing speeches. Biden can‚Äôt even call kamala to congratulate her without a note card of what he is supposed to say.
Why would Biden/Harris debate either of these #PutinsPuppets until they disclose their tax returns and #TraitorInChief sanctions Russia for putting bounties on our soldiers.
Why would Biden debate #LiarInChief / #PutinsPuppet until he discloses his tax returns and vows to sanction Russia due to  bounties on US soldiers?
The Biden Harris ticket is now a test of how far Dems will violate their principles for power. Corrupt, corporate crony &amp; creepy Joe matched with corrupt, over zealous prosecutor &amp; super dishonest elite Kamala. The two people that least represent Dem voters. #NeverBiden
I disagree, I can‚Äôt wait to see Biden not be able to put two coherent sentences together on national television
"Actions speak louder than words."  This axiom is universally understood by all voters.  IMHO, conservatives should be focusing on the "actions" of the candidates, and judging those actions.  Biden's actions are not Catholic, despite his claims otherwise.  Actions, not words.
Don't like liars? Good.
Biden stated on more than one occasion that he would VETO M4A. Biden has been trying for 40 years to gut SS and Medicare. What's the draw again?

I am a full time Alzheimer caregiver... I believe Biden is in Stage 4.
Remember what I said about bickering AFTER. I just blocked someone for saying ‚Äúfirst we have to fight Trump, then we have to fight Biden.‚Äù  THIS contributes more to this chaos than anything but Republican ignorance.   Friendly fire sucks.
Donald Trump calls Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate Kamala Harris ‚Äòmost horrible‚Äô member of Senate #SmartNews
Biden finds himself in a unique position historically- as the white male VP for the first black president and choosing the first black woman VP for his own presidency.
The answer is simple. NEITHER. if you think Biden is some kind of savior, I have a bridge to sell you. He stated on numerous occasions that he's all in for the insurance companies. He's bought and paid for like every other centrist.
This is funny - when will Stacy start shaming Biden for not picking someone 100% black as Harris is only half percent black! Again, this is funny!!
If you fvck this election for Biden... ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
Trump tweeted this: The ‚Äúsuburban housewife‚Äù will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge. Disgusting.
Joe Biden is literally Donald Trump just a few stages deeper into dementia and instead of being on the apprentice and owning casinos he just was openly racist and sexist for 40 years.
Harris is not progressive. She's as far right as Biden in policy, and she's a middle finger to the left that are protesting police brutality in the streets right now that she was chosen to be VP. You can't remake Harris as a progressive. She isn't, never has been.
I may not be thrilled about Biden‚Äôs vp choice.. but he could‚Äôve chosen a fucking rat and I‚Äôd still vote for him over tRuMp #BidenHarris2020 #VoteHimOut
I am hopeful for so much change, but I‚Äôve said since Biden first became a candidate that he was not my first choice. I want to share this as a reminder that blindly accepting just anything (the way those who follow Trump seem to) is not what it means to vote.
Biden and Ginsberg are like the mother in ‚Äúpsycho‚Äù at the Bates Motel. Mummies in a rocking chair.
Does anybody have a problem with the fact Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris because of her gender and skin color, not for her ideas and character?
You know how the character (The Joker) has that fixated smile on his face 24/7. Now that Kamala is Biden's VP, just imagine all the dis-connected Black folks out there with this Joker smile.  They're even smiling while sleeping.  #B1 #CutTheCheck #NoAntiBlackRacism
NOW I love Kamala.
I am actually more excited about Biden/Harris than I was about Clinton/Kaine. I believe that these two can actually help repair the damage that numbnuts and his douches have done to America. If we give them the House and Senate, they will put us on the fast track fix this mess.
THESE are the people I want running a country I live in. Their pasts? LEARN TO LIVE WITH YOUR "ISSUES". You CANNOT claim that somewhat flawed Biden and Harris is not better than a thoroughly corrupt, traitorous Trump.   Grow the FUG up. This is your ticket.  GET BUSY.
#HannityForBiden   After letting, even encouraging, Trump to make a total fool of himself in this interview, it's clear that Hannity is now working for Biden. Keep up the good work!
I thought it was black voters in southern states who elevated Biden to victory, against the progressive voters like me who preferred Sanders or Warren.
I do not believe that Joe Biden will simply step down.  Nope.  His cabinet will invoke the 25th Amendment, citing his mental incompetence.  It will be sad and solemn and respectful.  And, the first woman president would be appointed, not elected.  IMHO.
To me, it‚Äôs a matter of degrees. I find Trump and his ilk to be worse for a variety of reasons. Biden is still shit, but he‚Äôs less shit than Trump.
"The Biden-Harris ticket is the ‚ÄòDream Team‚Äô for our public schools and our students ‚Äì one that respects educators and will listen to those who know the...kids in the classrooms when it comes to what is best for our students." Here are 6 reasons why!

I want obama held accountable. I'm not saying Trump will do that, but Biden will ensure it never happens.   I didn't vote trump in 2016. I will this time.
CAN YOU BE A FUCKING PRESIDENT AND STOP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THE FUCK JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS ARE DOING?! PEOPLE ARE DYING
If I had to choose I'd pick Biden but ONLY cut im sick of Trump's term
I don't man, you tell me. Biden voted to confirm these assholes.
Patriots, the whole world is watching us, we need to concentrate and Vote Red this Election. If Biden/Harris win, it will not just be us in a Civil War it will be World Wide, every Country will be in a Civil War against these tyrants even in their own Country.
I trust Biden‚Äôs decision making a lot more than Trump.
That‚Äôs why China loves Biden!
Joe Biden really helped write the 3 strlikes law........... but holding my vote would be ignorant too. What in the entire fuck ü§¶üèæ
I've already declared that I'm voting for Clive Anderson. Though I may vote for Biden. Heck, even  is more qualified for the White House than Cheetos-Face...
You can find the link to the poll itself in this article in the third paragraph.
She got her ass whooped by Tulsi... her one memorable debate moment was when she implied Biden was racist.
Joe Biden is a Roman Catholic,practicing.
That‚Äôs because Biden isn‚Äôt a mob boss.
Uuuuuuh yeah, placing your faith in Democrats on a lot of those is going to disappoint you. They're terrible on the environment, Obama/Biden were the ones putting kids in cages when the photos came out, and a lot of the COVID deaths are happening under Democrat leadership. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Supporting Kamala‚Äôs VP nom doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôve stopped saying ‚ÄúDefund the police!‚Äù It means we have to shout it louder so when she or Biden get a question about it, they give the right answer and make a goddamn promise.
All Cops Are Bastards  &amp;  Kamala is a cop  Hence...   we better TF vote for the team with her bastard ass on it  üîµBIDEN-HARRIS 2020 üîµ
So who is the puppeteer for the far left who is really running the Biden Campaign because someone is.....
Also, they always say ‚Äúafter the election‚Äù but what does that mean? Biden gets elected and what? It‚Äôs not like they support us anyway.
I bet you believe what your told about Hunter Biden as well. Lol
That said Biden/Harris is still a better choice than, well, whatever is left of the failed trump administration. Just so tone deaf to have her as vp after months of protests against police brutality and an unfair justice system
Have you watched any of Joe Biden's campaign?  I seriously can't believe the Dem's followed the worst campaign in US history with an even worse one.
If you supported Harris for VP, I don‚Äôt even want to hear where you think Warren would be best, in Biden‚Äôs administration or otherwise.  You already got your damn VP. Be happy about that.
Just vote for Biden and shut the fuck up. App been exhausting last 12 hours. Y‚Äôall realize the opposition is DONALD TRUMP right??
sorry loser, I am a strong Trump Supporter. If you want a total Civil War then go ahead and vote for her, I mean vote for Biden.
You got an inside scoop on Biden getting Epsteined or something?
News break for ya skippy but Harris is his running mate, she is more corrupt then Biden, if Biden wins the election I can assure ya she will push for the 25th Amend to have him removed from Office on the grounds he has Dementia, not clearly fit to be President
I don't think even he knows he picked her, I think it was Jill Biden who picked her not Joe.
Patriots, seeing Harris has been tapped to be Biden's running mate we all really need to get down and pray plus get our asses out to vote for Trump. Biden/Harris can not be elected or America will be no more.
will you explain your change in opinion on Biden and Harris?
Oh shit you got us, guess we will vote for Biden now, not like those pics are photoshopped, taken out of context, and literally shows a father spending time with his daughter. You're delusional.
As crooked as she is, she got a way to become the President, if Biden wins, without any votes. All she has to do is invoke the 25th Amend. against Biden which she will succeed and then becomes the first Minority Female President without even an Election.
VEEP is as important as farts in the wind. What's the and percentage comparing Biden and Sanders?  #DemExit #ProgressiveNotDemocrat
I keep thinking a/b #VPHarris. I differ w/ her on some policies, as I differ w/ Biden. But the more I look at her record &amp; personality, the more I see her as not only a strong VP but also a strong Prez, which, let's be honest, we need to consider. Really happy a/b this ticket!
I said it in another tweet, if Biden wins, and I am sure we won't let that happen, she's going to push for the 25th Amen. in order to be President without being elected, she ran for the office and failed. This will be her chance to get in the office. Remember her threat.
So now you guys want the debates?? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ If they can debate, then so can Trump and Biden.
People wake up, seeing Harris is now have been nominated as the VP for Biden and what she has said concerning us AS WELL as Biden, if Biden wins she will push for the enactment of the 25th A against Biden thus forcing him out of office to make her President w/o being elected.
but watch them try to skip the president debate for biden. no cue cards
How truly strange 2020 is can be summed up noting Joe Walsh is rooting for Biden / Harris
With Veepstakes over and me being thoroughly disappointed in the outcome I guess I‚Äôll mostly just be focusing on Senate races and stuff now.  Good luck Biden! I‚Äôll vote for you, but that‚Äôs probably it.

Biden and Harris make debut as running mates, vowing to defeat Trump  They look wonderful together I think compliments the democratic party and they will be invincible cannot wait to see Kamala go after Mikey pinhead pence she will tear him a new ass......
He‚Äôs has been a civil rights attorney and is Jewish.  That is a very righteous combination from the ‚Äò60s.  It makes me even more proud of this ticket.  Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Kamala Harris and Douglas Emhoff will rock this world!
I‚Äôm sorry, what? Joe Biden is a Catholic! Are you serious,or just trying to be relevant? News flash, you are neither! Sit down!
1 Biden is only a puppet in the Radical Democratic agenda. Joe Biden is being elderly abused and being used by the Democratic Party! ‚ÄúIf‚Äù Biden is elected to the highest office in the United States he won‚Äôt make it to Inauguration Day!
Biden...Harris...One thing I can agree with is it‚Äôs better than the alternative, and if I could vote I‚Äôd wake myself up to go to the voting booth, get it over with, use some sanitizer, then wipe the tears from eyes.
But if I don‚Äôt vote Biden I‚Äôm not black üòÇ they both say racist stuff. You should vote for people based off of their ideas for policies, foreign affairs, etc. Not based off who makes you feel good inside.
CANNOT operate a cellular phone so what's that tell you and he definitely IS NOT running his own  account he is just a RUNG IN A LADDER plus I here there is a contract out on BIDEN he's GREEN LIT whatever that means.  Something about past deals that have failed.

Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, adding former rival to ticket  Kamala Harris you should be honored Joey Biden Kamala was not my first pick...BUT HER SPUNKINESS AND ENERGY ARE QUALITIES OF A FINE VICE PRESIDENT AND SHE WILL TEAR PENCE APART......
Not to mention that back in the day Biden fought for segregation.
I echo the sentiments that Biden and Harris aren't my ideal candidates, but I'm still voting for them. We'll at least have a shot at being listened to as we raise our voices. We're not getting that with Trump. We try to raise our voices and he responds like a manipulative spouse.
I would like to thank the DNC for choosing  as Biden‚Äôs VP Nominee. (I wonder if Joe knows yet?) Thank you for doing everything possible to throw the election!
This guy endorses Biden and all y‚Äôall still worship him? If Donald trump is racist wtf is joe Biden lmao. This world is truly in Satans hands

I understand but strongly disagree. I respect him and agree shaming voters is not effective. I‚Äôm strongly encouraging him to reconsider because the fact is it‚Äôs trump or Biden. It will not be Green this cycle.

Donald Trump is So threatened by VP Joe Biden that he's willing to take help from any Country, he's willing to take down the Postal service, he's going to continue to risk American lives to discourage voting, funding Kanye West for Prez to take votes....what am I missing?
I just have to say this, all these idiots tweeting about the a$$ in the WH signing an EO for pre-existing healthcare coverage is about as stupid as it gets! It‚Äôs called the ACA thank you Obama/Biden
That‚Äôs wonderful they agree on Biden, but I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt agree on Bama and Auburn.
Joe Biden is 77.  Nancy Pelosi is 80. Are you kidding me?
Intel shows Russia trying to "denigrate" Biden, and China prefers Trump lose
is it true that if there is no clear voted Pres. that Pelosi will be the interim president until it‚Äôs sorted out?  Makes sense that she would have Biden (a puppet) there to cause chaos between him and Trump, putting her in the house until it‚Äôs decided. Scarrrry!
"Joe Biden is unfit to be president and Joe Biden is a racist. Joe Biden has the mind-set of a plantation owner." -Leo Terrell
Like you, I‚Äôm not a fan of the current administration, but you‚Äôve been endorsing Biden for months. Just admit you‚Äôre voting for him because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen. His VP pick will be irrelevant to you...
God, as he watches Biden become too powerful to stopI really wouldn't be so confident Malcolm would vote for Joe Biden, or that he would give any credence whatsoever to the broader liberal-versus-conservative framework.
Thread! My view of this is different than other ppl‚Äôs + I totally get not wanting to vote for Biden like,,, fuck him! I think getting trump out is a harm reduction strategy only if we don‚Äôt return to complacency but it‚Äôs not my place to tell marginalized communities how to vote.
This tweet is just enraging me for so many reasons. If they instead endorse Biden, would that be a better thing? And what do you mean by ‚Äúpotential‚Äù problem, as if civil servants should ever be giving political endorsements even through a representative.
This Biden?
Biden will heart just as many of not more people, we can at least use Trump to hurt the right people.  The DNC wants to play dirty politics  I'm game
And you're not very convincing, I've at least cited all my shit, nor am I insulting, insulting people doesn't really make me wanna vote for Biden
Oh this ain't a hate vote, he earned it by being more in favor of Medicare for all than Biden, and by giving me 1200 dollars. He's the most liberal president I've had in my lifetime that's for sure
Biden says that under him nothing will change so not sure how that's an argument against Trump
It's alright I understand, I just think it's best to go on the offensive. Progressives won't win bending the knee to biden
I live in Washington. In the d primaries they voted joe biden. I dont know a single person who voted for him. They all went Bernie. I doubt they'll go trump because of the institutional corruption. We have 3 counties who go blue. If we had real elections. Trump would win easily
If Biden wins, do you think he‚Äôll resign before his term his is up so that Pence will pardon him? Is this a possibility?
Trump's even more supportive of universal healthcare than Biden is  please understand, Trump can be used as a weapon against the establishment.
Trump wants your vote, I am a Bernie supporter who's gone Trump, in my eyes, the best way to get the corperate Dems out is to embarrass them in front of America by losing to Trump. It's worked well so far, it'd work even better if Biden loses.  Join me brother, please. Fuck DNC.
Joe Biden has already forgotten that he's getting the nomination.
All of them need to be arrested for treason, and if Biden doesn‚Äôt do that I will not vote for his 2nd term!

No it isn't, infact I'd say it's better. Biden in more against Medicare for all than Trump after all.
I am sure biden will slaughter trump on the fake popular vote and trump will win. Just to piss them off as they play both sides.
That's hilarious. You call Kamala, our future Vice President, a nasty woman. You You can't honestly believe you respect any woman in the entire world. You wanna build a statue? Make it of Kamala, because she's going to make history by helping Biden take you down.
I think it comes down to, like in most coups, if the military will back him.  W Biden as the other choice I think theyre not gonna take sides cus its win/win  If anyone willing to cut the millitary budget were the dem pic itd be another story

Neither Biden nor Harris have great criminal justice track records. While I am hopeful that they will take this country to the next level, my fear is that many will see it as the stopping point for the grassroots work.
Seriously I 'd be thrilled if Biden/Kamala delivered one of these. Ecstatic if more than one.
's choice of  gives me hope. Biden has shown that he's not afraid to elevate someone who will make him look bad if it's for the good of our Nation.  I'm 100% behind this ticket. So happy  is on it!

This is why lesser of 2 evils voting g is problematic. Joe Biden is supposed the most left DNC platform ever but somehow it's way less progressive than every Dem platform until 1980? Literally hasn't been an opposition party since Reagan.
It's going to Joe Biden's campaign. There something democrats are great at, exploiting black people.   I seem to recall having a civil war to correct this kind of stuff, but what can you do? Some have a short memory.

Nothing about Biden. Not a fan of or Harris whatsoever.  "COLLAPSE" look around in your America!!! Get your shit together &amp; force a huge stimulus check for the Rest of the year!!!!
Since one could argue Biden is worse than Trump - he shares many of Trump's flaws, has a longer track record of doing so, and has accomplishments like the Iraq War that Donnie still hasn't achieved - you'll forgive me if I take a pass on your Red Team versus Blue Team bullshit.
‚ÄúWe want to win but we‚Äôre scared some random judge will throw them off the ballot in a swing state.‚Äù
And Biden /Harris are actually Center Right. 45 is so far right that he can't even see the middle from where he is.  This conversation with you is worthless, though. You're too far into Putin's pockets to even know reason. So... bye, Felicia!
Ummm... Biden isn't the one who lead to then highest per capita spread of the virus anywhere in the world. That was your boy Trump

Thank you. Voting Biden/Harris. Also, beware Russian bots and the crap they spew. It‚Äôs amazing how many people lap it up and regurgitate it.
Even if i didnt want a boost   FUCK JOE BIDEN
That's the point.   Biden or Saager????   Actual progressive people that don't have a voice in the Democratic party would vote for Saager. Especially when it comes to a lot of economic issues.  It's not the person.(no duh, I would rather have krystal) it's about any progress
At least you are showing Biden doing something you are incapable of!
This is in fact, really good and worth watching. They shoot straight past the bullshit about Biden/Harris and go right into applying what we know about Movement theory and power relations to our situation now and what to focus on. All of their points are interesting. Good show ü§ò
Yeah. People can vote for Biden if they want. I understand the train of thought. But this "Biden is a good guy / good candidate" thing is an insult to my intelligence AND ignores the important fact that even if he wins you will have to fight against him for every bit of progress.
Joe biden supports antifa because he is a communist just like Trump and the rest. As backed by the communist central bankers who took this country when they killed lincoln. Its called HISTORY.
2.  Legitimacy of the outcome.  His tactic is to overwhelm the system with shit.  So, anything less than a total landslide with all 50 states certifying electors sufficient to give Biden a clear 270 electoral votes, will create the confusion that raises this scenario.

This gets into one of the major problems with American politics, and why Obama/Biden led us directly into Trump (and why Biden/Harris would deliver us into the next Trump). Trump singles out Democrats as lying out-of-touch elitists working against Americans' interests...
I gave you an honest answer. I don't fuckin' waste my time with Joe Biden webcasts or whatever. Better things to do.  Many of his lies are promises (or crafted non-promises) he has no intention of keeping. I can't strictly prove it's a lie, but you're a fool if you believe him.

200% agree.  I rather have  as president. It's about making the country better. Saager _ I could agree on many things.  I don't agree with much at all when it comes to Biden &amp; Harris. If I do they don't go far enough for the betterment of the American people
The PANDEMIC is highlighting all the failures of our duopoly for the last many decades.   They people like US to close our eyes, shut our mouths &amp; turn off independent thinking &amp; vote 4 biden &amp; Harris. That will eventually lead to a smarter, more organized Trump with a ideology
Good possibility. Even the "squad" massively let's US down. Especially AOC.   Voting for Nancy to be speaker.   Biden has a large part to play in how Trump eventually became president. Going down the rebulican lite path (neo-liberlism) making our w Country worse off got US Trump
I am proud to be part of this milestone on Joe Biden‚Äôs path to becoming the 46th President of the United States. We have 83 days to elect fantastic Democrats up &amp; down the ballot, &amp; I will wake up each day ready to get to work. Will you join me, Team Heck? #giveaheck #heck4ltgov
Biden promised every girlboss running he'd make them VP so they'd all endorse a republican rapist racist, then grabbed Kamala based on correcting the news cycle.  Maybe if your idea of political change is getting women into power try not investing is spineless dupes
I am leaning towards 4 more yrs of Trump, instead of 8-12 more years of neo-liberlism.  Why? The progressive push from 3rd parties will continue.  Millions won't go to sleep if Trump wins again.   Biden administration will be pretty much Trump administration.  4yrs less then 8-12
Mr. Smith was sounding decent earlier about beating Biden or Trump.  Now he shows his true political ideology.   Pandering, identity politics &amp; neo-liberlism
REVEALED: Spoiler candidate Kanye West met with Jared Kushner amid efforts to derail Biden campaign -
Biden and Harris gave emotional and dynamic speeches. Whatever this is from Trump is just droning on and on and on...
. is a great contributor to public discourse. In May, tho, she used her WaPo pedestal to advocate something awful. She was &amp; is wrong. She should apologize.  Yet I wonder if she knew in May Biden's Veep reveal would swallow her book release news?
Every Democrat, including Biden and Harris, needs to amplify the need to defend our Postal Service.
I do wish Biden and Harris had attacked Trump for slowing down the mail. This is an issue which affects everyone.
Biden attacked Anita Hill in support of Clarence Thomas. Biden's been on the wrong side of many key issues (abortion, gay marriage) for most of his career. He straight up campaigned for a Republican in 2018. No reason to think he won't nominate some right-wing "compromise" judge.
I just want you to vote against Trump-I get you aren‚Äôt jazzed by Biden but tyranny is real and it isn‚Äôt far from our reality. You don‚Äôt need to do more- just please don‚Äôt convince others to do less.
Those were excellent speeches from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Kamala is so much more lively than Biden I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they have her taking the reins to keep him off the tv
In isolation, maybe? I guess? Donnie hasn't plunged us into another Iraq War, so that's at least a point in his favor vs Biden. But Donnie says worse things than Biden does.  But this election isn't in isolation. The people lose either way, either for 4 years or for much longer.
Plus the fact the demand was such a hilarious concession of the point. Five lies in 11 days, from a guy trying to avoid public appearances. Was this person afraid I would name four? I can't even fully attribute the Twitter lie to Biden, as he clearly doesn't run that account.
Yeah, but Joe Biden will probably have someone quite a bit younger help him turn it on.

Idk what to talk about on this weekend's show. Could blabber on about Biden/Harris but who cares. All the leftists lost their Primary in my area. Anybody got links about PNW projects, organizations, upcoming events, reports from protests etc? That's my jam.
It‚Äôs ignorant to vote for someone just because of their political party. Biden will do the exact same things that Trump has done to our country. There are no differences between them. Biden does not give a single shit about minorities. At all.
I was already not voting for Biden and now that he picked Kamala Harris I‚Äôm super not voting for him  (p.s. Trump can fuck off too)
Me too! My heart swelled up with joy, when Biden announced a strong woman as his running mate.
I can't believe that people think that Biden is capable of finding his slippers in his basement. People keep on looking down &amp; not observing what is really going on.
So Biden still did less for America in 40 yrs than Trump has done in 3 1/2 yrs, Thanks, got it! üòÜ
‚Äúwe‚Äôre not voting biden in we‚Äôre voting trump out‚Äù is the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever heard and shows that people really don‚Äôt care about actual policy or change and just want to have their ‚Äúteam win‚Äù
That's what hard. I get that progressives (like myself) are not happy with the Biden/Harris ticket. I personally am weary of establishment Democrats and how much they are corporate sponsored. Biden had an abysmal record. Harris's is pretty bad too. One problem at a time.
Seriously, this 70 IQ Jimmy Dore level essentialism hobbles us as leftists. I‚Äôve explained 1000 ways why not supporting Biden would be disastrous for the left, and your only response is ‚Äúheh... the DNC is corrupt tho‚Äù   I‚Äôm aware, why not address some actual points dummy
No one should rest until Biden &amp; Harris are sworn in.
Don't fall for these hit pieces on Kamala Harris. Kamala is one of the most progressive lawmakers we have. Do your own research &amp; homework! And vote Biden Harris 2020 November 3rd üó≥
So: 4 years of Biden. That doesn‚Äôt mean we stop there. That‚Äôs 4 years of direct action, 4 years of spreading our message instead of Trump dominating the discourse, 4 years of not getting blamed single handedly for Trump‚Äôs re-election, and 4 years of markedly better policy.
My response is we got even closer but ultimately failed because the DNC was organized enough to pull together last minute behind Biden. If I told you an open democratic socialist was a nut hair away from snagging the dem nomination a decade ago, you would laugh at me.
I think he is being facetious. I'm guessing he's a "blood red" Republican and he's taking a shot at Biden by implying that he's NOT Catholic.
The law for running for President is where the person running was born, not the parents! I wish that could be a loop hole, but Biden won‚Äôt win, so no worries! #Trump2020üá∫üá∏üî•
My heart swelled with joy when Biden picked a strong running mate.
I‚Äôll bet the DNC brought that convention lineup to Biden and leveraged jt into the Kamala pick
Kamala Harris took Biden‚Äôs ticket from a ticket I was voting for out of necessity and desperation to a ticket I‚Äôm excited about.
Kamala Harris does not represent my values anymore then Joe Biden does. However I was never under the impression the VP pick would be an actual labor/socialist/progressive candidate. This ticket is by the wealthy to placate the salary class that feels guilty. Nothing more. üëé
Yeah, for sure. I think something that gets lost in a lot of mainstream discussion of these issues is that for people like me, Bernie was a pretty big compromise. When we get to the point of a Biden/Harris ticket, it goes from being a compromise to an insult.
I tend to believe the change will come (if it ever does) outside of the scope of electoral politics, but I largely agree with Freya here. Biden is a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù choice but my personal political beliefs are such that the difference between the right and ‚Äúleft‚Äù is a rounding error.
Accountability argument isn't going to work. Moving the democrats left is a fucking joke. Democrats have a house majority &amp; Nancy won't even have a vote on #MedicareForAll   Harris record is very conservative &amp; so is Biden.
It is a conservative majority right now &amp; they struck it down.   Supreme Court isn't gonna move anyone. Biden &amp; Harris care about their careers &amp; that's about it.
Supreme Court..... Biden isn't giving 2 shits about the Supreme Court.   Biden picks will be about the same.
Biden &amp; Obama deported 2 million.  Biden was talking about a wall back in the 90s.  Harris is a fucking cop.FUCKING COP!  Biden policies aren't gonna be that different from Trump policies.  It's gonna suck under a Trump or Biden administration.  Neo-liberlism is what got US Trump
A vote for the Biden/Harris ticket will turn the whole country into a üí©hole!!!
Sorry Liz, but what‚Äôs happening in Portland is not happening under Biden/Harris, it‚Äôs happening under Trump/Pence. Why do Republicans always point at the utter destruction under their policy and say ‚Äúsee look what will happen if you elect Democrats? ARE YOU FUCKEN KIDDING ME???
Is that your Biden phonebanking script?
Oh look they already had it lined up to use Kamala's accusations against Biden.
"The Democrats will save us." lol  Trump was able to attack Hillary from the left because Hillary was an awful candidate - almost as bad as Joe.  You can blame me for the world's ills if you want. But I would rather wipe my ass with my vote than ever give it to Biden or Trump.
Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign mate, I think who he chose to as his VP to run with. Kamela Harris.
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris. But actually.
Actually biden just loves Trump the communist trogen horse and picked someone that no one liked. He KNOWS THIS and just played your ass. Maybe you should get over yourself and the name calling..
That is a compelling case but I still think Trump being elected for four more years is far worse than Biden and Harris winning. Fighting the establishment Dems is a fight for next year and is a fight I will gladly be a part of. But I think, for now, that Trump needs to go.
bernie happily took another 200 billion and gave it to biden and endorsed him. How many times does he have to stomp on your dick before you wake up?
Yeah, I'm a little confused. If people aren't voting for Biden, than who?  Are you voting for Trump?  Wouldn't voting for anyone other than Biden be like voting for Trump as no one else has a chance to win? What could be worse than 4 more from 45?
It surprises me that people actually think a third party vote is a good decision. All it will do is take votes away from Biden/Kamala and hand the country back to Trump so he can destroy it even more.  We need to get more people to vote. Not voting is a huge waste.
James, you ain't black if you consider not voting for Joe Biden.
I am going to put an American flag on one corner of my truck and  Biden/Harris flag on the other.  I‚Äôm going to drive the streets of Olympia, Wa and show that the flag belongs to all of us.  I hope I can start a movement with this.  ITS OUR FLAG!!  Not trump supporters!!!
I know with just over 3k followers this might not get much traction, but hear me out. When I see a flag flying on the back of any vehicle, I think ‚ÄúTrump supporters‚Äô. Today I decided that I‚Äôm taking the flag back. As soon as a Biden/Harris flag is available 1/2
100% Riden with Biden.
Nada, I wouldn't mess with you man. You look like you're all out of bubble gum. Biden and Harris aren't perfect for me, but I gotta start somewhere.

I agree with this. Today's announcement has created so much positive momentum for the campaign. Biden dominated the news cycle and neither he nor Harris said a word in public. Tomorrow their joint appearance will generate more positive buzz, leading perfectly into the convention.
It boggles my mind how you can be so snarky while being such a damn sucker.  8 years of Obama/Biden delivered us directly into Trump. So where would a Biden presidency deliver us?  You want us to vote for the guy opposing M4A while telling us to in-person vote during a pandemic?

GOP senator draws fire from all sides on Biden, Obama-era probes
Nope. You're the victim of political narrative. Biden isn't creepy at all &amp; he's not "taking advantage" of anyone. It's as innocuous as a grandparent giving a simple hug. If there were any "creepy" intents there, there'd been at least a little effort to hide it from casual view.
Biden campaign sends scathing statement in response to Trump stoking false conspiracy theory
Ironic how Trump et al attack his foes with ad hominems that more easily fit Trump himself. "Crooked" Trump paying hush money to porn stars with election funds so they don't talk about where he "grabs them by". Biden may kiss babies,  but at least doesn't French them like Trump.
Unfortunate that he reserves those for only self-aggrandizement. What about the key traits of governing such as ethics, compassion, respect, service, et al? You know, those things that Biden has that Donald "Just about me" Trump only sees as obstacles to "winning"?
We have never had such a corrupt President that is backed by a corrupt Senate and Attny General and friends.Biden needs to put many laws in for protection against this ever happening again.
Will admit tho that some of the Never Biden folks are pretty embarrassing even as somebody that generally agrees with the sentiment, some of them *kinda* seem to downplay the badness of Trump and suggest some uh... sus things for a progressive to say imo
I think the general idea is that whatever would come from a Biden Administration isn't significant enough to warrant particularly supporting him
Schumer, pelosi and Biden all voted for the 2005 bill, you realize that right?
I don't know what the rest of y'all think, but Trump looked a helluva lot slower coming down that ADA-approved ramp at West Point &amp; lumbering around the golf course, than Biden does biking, etc. It's clear Joe is more fit than "Snuffleupa-Trump".

Nothing can make me not vote for BIDEN. NOTHING
You aren‚Äôt understanding my point. Even if the USPS were to blatantly illegally prevent delivery of every ballots people mail on Election Day, Oregon‚Äôs electoral votes will still go to Biden. Voter suppression only matters (for the presidential election) in battleground states.
There‚Äôs Nothing That will stop me from voting for Biden/Harris

I voted for Nader in California, where it didn‚Äôt matter. And I learned that feeling good about myself while voting wasn‚Äôt what voting is about. Pull up your pants, vote Biden.

Harris is a bigger train wreck then Biden
trump could win despite losing the popular vote by ~3%. Polls could be off by another ~3% in his favor. And it's easy to imagine legit votes that don't officially get postmarked in time strip another ~3% from Biden.  Biden at 9% over trump is ostensibly a tie.

Ok well I will vote for Biden then.  That won me over Demon.
When you are in decline your desperate requirement is to hide it unless you trust the folks around you. I expect even in Biden's diminishment he senses the people he knows would eat his liver for a breath of power.

Biden should challenge him to walking down a ramp, drinking out of a glass, word pronunciation, riding a bike, answering a question without going off topic and babbling incoherently. It would be humiliating for trump.
And I'm stuck thinking about Biden's history of sexual assault, and I'm stuck with all those racist quotes swirling through my mind. It's been less than a week since he was in the news for saying something racist!  And I also know what Trump is. The whole situation just stinks.
And because the average person isn't paying close attention and doesn't have a long memory, that choice‚Äîboiled down to gender and (vaguely) race‚ÄîHarris' VP pick status will inform the general impression of Biden's stance on gender and race.
Putting aside Biden v. Trump for a moment...  Biden had to shift toward the left to stay competitive in the primary. The hope I keep hearing from progressives is that they'll be able to put pressure on him to achieve their goals.  Picking Harris for VP doesn't inspire much hope.

Now that Biden has his VP pick it is 100% clear that whoever wins this election, we are all losing. Big time.

I did vote for Clinton in '16 but it took my husband reminding me how guilty I would feel if she somehow lost our typically safe blue state. This year I'm excited to vote against Trump and know how much better Biden/Harris will be
So my take on this is that both candidates seek to be President but Trump is relaxing on the train letting others do the work as he coasts along in his comfortable life, while Biden is labouring and doing all the work himself without the glamour and comfort... Trump own goal!

Absolutely. Trump is looking for loyalty only, trust isn‚Äôt important.   Biden is looking for integrity.
Make Online Great Again baby, vote for Joe Biden and everyone can stop posting about politics
Ok , my 26 year old son says Biden lost the millennials votes with the Harris pick ?

I rail against Twitter folks who declare what you &amp; I should do. How we should twitter. Don‚Äôt like it. But my god. Tweeting ‚Äúwill Jill Biden be a better First Lady than Melanie‚Äù is just some lazy-ass shit. It just is. Tweet what ya want. But it‚Äôs lazy.
Wait, so you‚Äôre saying trump did more in 4 years than Biden in over 4 decades?!
Biden and Harris gave tremendous speeches, did you watch?
Biden - Harris 2020. Vote blue.
Tweeters in the US - is the amount of grants Trump is tweeting about tonight a response to the Biden - Harris combination and his concerns?  What do people think of KH? Do they think she and Biden stand a chance of winning (in a fair election)?
Don the Con started strong... Then ended last!! Some highlights of Don the Cons work!  * A divided Nation. * A deadly pandemic. * Half the nation out of work. * A nation on the brink of Bankruptcy.  This is why I am voting for Biden/Harris!

Your attempt at humor during this horrible pandemic isn't funny at all. Biden clearly is NOT in his basement. He is following health safety protocols, unlike you idiots.
Hey  - can you introduce me to the retarded 4 y.o. who believes your shit about Kamala or Biden ‚Äústealing your guns and exploding the gov‚Äôt‚Äù? You have a voting record. You have zero respect for your constituents because you treat them like they are imbeciles.

Is there a betting pool on when Biden steps down and Harris takes over!
Yes, you got it!! Check Biden‚Äôs son Hunter who owns an investment company in Shanghai, China! The Bank of China provided him with interest-free loans. If it weren't for his father, who would give him free money?
Piece of advice for Trump: if you want Biden/Harris to lose, the first thing you should do is stand down yourself.
You got an inside scoop on Biden getting Epsteined or something?
Also this email kinda makes Biden and Harris seem like punk rock anarchists. üë®üèª‚Äçüé§üë©üèΩ‚Äçüé§

‚ÄúAs a presidential candidate, [Kamala Harris] put forth a very knowledgeable, thorough platform as well that speaks to her breadth of knowledge of Indian Country &amp; tribal issues. I think that‚Äôs why together w/ [Joe] Biden ... they make a great team‚Äù - Pechanga Chair Mark Macarro
They both agree Biden sexually assaulted women
That‚Äôs kinda how Biden got the job from  Obama. He had some good points on  Obama during the debates. And Biden turned into Obama‚Äôs cheerleader when he was picked. Your fiercest opposition in the debat is usually someone who cares as much as you do. Those who care are good allies
I mean I'm gonna not vote for Biden, but it's not like I have to do that to own the Neolibs. They're getting constantly owned every single day. They think Pete Buttigieg is cool. That's so fucking sad I almost want to vote for Biden out of pity.
Vote green and organize with local activists to try to get my community the support that Trump will actively burn down, while Biden will simply not rebuild it. See? Progress. The last guy stabbed you, but I won't.   I won't dress your wound though. What're you, team knife?
Jill Biden's going to make a great First Lady.

Lets get to it!! Biden and Harris 2020
I'd rather help get your boss moving...out of the White House. Biden/Harris 2020.
Trump has driven this country into a shithole, filled with bodies of 160,000 + dead American souls,  Millions unemployed,  soon millions will be evicted  I'll go with Biden, who actually works all day and doesn't idlely watch Americans die and starve.  #EndTheNightmare
Honest question, what if you voted for Obama, and Hilary, and still plan on voting for Biden/Harris, but don‚Äôt like Harris due to her time as DA? Does that makes you a racist?
I love watching you talk about how great Biden is and how much of a lunatic Trump is...  You do realize backing a president who has had 160,000 American souls die on his watch... is probably political suicide.  #EndTheNightmare
If you see baggage, flawed, difficult, ambitious, just stop reading the article.   Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris even after she was mean to him on stage. That's something Trump and a lot of Twitter wouldn't do.
I put up a Biden banner on my profile, but this may be better?
I didn't know that Biden had in him to choose her.  Hell, Yeah, She is the Right Choice for these times.
Our United States of America needs Biden/Harris. Please vote in 2020! It‚Äôs time we remove trump, before he destroys us ALL‚úåÔ∏è
I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb(or am I) to say that #Biden DID NOT choose #KamalaHarrisForVP. The Democrats chose her for him. #BidenHarris2020
Remember Joe Biden is a feeble old man who somehow is not progressive enough and too progressive and is an existential threat to our strong nation, because he‚Äôs a feeble old man. Got it?
That's how you get Trump reelected splitting democratic votes away from Biden.
Pence has lost 165,000+ lives on his watch. Willing to take my chances on Biden/Harris.
Funny how Biden is smart and capable until he needs to be a confused old man who doesn't know what an Anarchist is. Love how y'all will give him the benefit of the doubt on this shit and have the nerve to mock the GOP for doing the same dumb thing. No thanks. I'm good.

My friends are calling me Larrydamus. Through all the twists and turns I said it was gonna be Biden/Harris since spring 2019. Today‚Äôs lucky numbers are 6, 18 and 52.
Kamala Harris is a former police officer, and a member of the Establishment undemocratic party. She has never passed or supported the working class in anyway. IMPEACH BIDEN!
No. He literally said he wanted to prosecute people with my political beliefs like two weeks ago. Fuck Joe Biden. If the Dems think they don't need to reach out to the Left, that's their fucking problem. I'm not letting them threaten me with the GOP as an excuse to be lazy.
So during a time when everyone is screaming for criminal justice reform and police reform, Biden decides to choose Kamala Harris as his VP? This election really is going to hell in a hand basket.
It‚Äôs actually very touching, it‚Äôs about grief:  In the video it is 2 minutes in.
Excellent choice! I look forward to a Biden/Harris Whitehouse!
But you know. Black ain‚Äôt black with Biden.
Biden and Harris will be the end of African American Men

Joe Biden really just picked missblowsalot to be his vp? Lol

BREAKING: Biden reveals VP pick
For those interested in the VP pick, the Thursday speakers: Joe Biden; the Biden Family; Cory Booker; Gavin Newsom; Keisha Lance Bottoms; Tammy Baldwin; Tammy Duckworth; Chris Coons and Kamala Harris.  Duh!
I think that is a product of the breathless media. Yes...Biden has changed the timeline. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs for drama. He knows the importance of this choice and wants to get it right. Just my take on it.
I think it is very funny that a large percentage of Biden voters are expecting him to die in office

Honestly I will laugh my ass off if Biden chooses Buttigieg as his VP after all of this speculation. It would be the funniest, most plausible pick he could make that would piss of literally everybody and have exactly zero political ramifications for him.
Biden also has a back story that appeals. Following a fatal accident involving a wife and child he made a point of commuting each evening  to surviving sons from Washington and knew many passengers &amp; staff on Amtrak by name. I don‚Äôt know why but I feel it shows a decent man.
Tucker rips lack of coverage of DC mass shooting, claims media silent to help Biden campaign  #FoxNews
Anyone have any thoughts on this or noticed it too? Biden gets a ton of likes on his tweets, has less followers than the prez, yet prez has 80M followers and I don't think I've seen a tweet with more than 300k likes.
Don't know why we're stressing over Biden's VP pick, it's not like there are any good options there
Didn't watch it. No need to ever watch a Trump News conference ever again. I know it's filled with lies.   I will wait till January of 2021, when President Biden gives us a news conference!

Actually saw a Biden sign in Oxford. Didn‚Äôt know people were happily/voluntarily voting for him lol
So what you are saying is that the protests that are happening today under the Trump presidency would happen inder a Biden presidency.  In order to stop the protests that are happening with Trump as president will stop if Trump is re-elected.  Your logic is that of a grifter.
This Biden character just feels fake.
To be honest it would probably take some kind of experimental teledildonics for Biden to live to next January

I'm a Christian and I don't support Trump. Heck, I don't even support Biden either.
I agree. Ultimately it will be about building. In the USA there is a golden opportunity in November to make a big difference. It's a real shame Bernie isn't the one up against Trump. But let's hope Biden will shape up.
So much for my wager of "Joe Biden accidentally picks WWF's Kamala as VP"
I voted green in 2016, but I was in a solid blue state. I won't be this time. I'm all for us getting super leftist people elected, but we can't have 4 more years of trump, it's at least one more supreme court choice he gets.  I fucking hate Biden, but a blowout needs to happen.
Has anyone ever seen our nation so divided and sick before? Has anyone ever heard a president attack his opponents or other political party the way Trump has? It's unreal how terrible he treats those who are Democrat! Trump's buddies are just as vile. I cannot wait to vote Biden!
I'm voting for Biden, because he is going to save this great nation from the pathetic idiot that is destroying it. 160,000 dead, a Bankrupt nation, and the most divided this nation has ever been. All under Trump and his crime family.

Everyone pretty much knows Biden (age 77 now, 78 upon inauguration) will be a one-termer and will be the wedge for his VP to become the 47th president.  That's why he needs to think long and hard about who it's going to be.
I'm fairly certain that all the voters who would be influenced by a bully mocking a disabled reporter, for instance, are so firmly in the Trump camp it would be impossible to pry them out by the sight of Biden one-upping him with his own monkey show. We're going for independents.
Why is Biden so wimpy, biding his time on the VP decision?
CORRUPTION in our faces EVERY SINGLE DAY! I know this gmhas to be fraudulent! There isn‚Äôt a single ethical Republican left in office!
that says Biden 2020. I'm confused.
Disagree. Biden made Obama palatable to white voters.  He got Obama to the WH.   Hillary should have chosen Bob Casey of PA.  Conservative D.  He would have gotten those extra votes in PA or MI.
Biden only needs to get 2% of the white vote (&gt; age 45) in six states (MI, PA, OH,FL, WI &amp; AZ. The only woman to poll positively in those states was Harris.
Trump is going to do as much damage as possible before he is evicted!   The damage is severe. Trump has literally destroyed this nation.   Biden! It's time to come out swinging!
I don't give a f$ck how hard Trump tries to make it for me to vote! I guarantee I will vote! Even if it means being in a wheelchair, hospital bed, or on a ventilator!   I will stand in line for the next 2 months if that's what it takes!! Biden will get my vote!
His constant bashing of Democrats is getting pretty old. I think it's time for Biden to come out swinging! Trump is sealing his fate. If anyone on the left was on the ropes, Trump destroyed those potential votes.
Biden should pick 3 Vice Presidents to appeal to the polyamorous voter.
Biden needs to be more Obama like, and inspire people to vote for him
What are you posing for? Question your own sanity if you follow Biden. He is a very troubled man. Be open to sane change not violent demonstrators that crazy Pelosi &amp; Schumer suport plus Socialism. Your Pose looks like Narcissism.
I want to thank you for the excellent videos that show how much of a snake Trump and his crime family is.   I cannot wait to vote for Biden. No matter how hard Trump tries to prevent me from voting, I will! I will stand in line for 60 days if I have to!
Don't BLAME what you have done on Biden.  He hasn't made the decisions for the last four years.  YOU HAVE!!!  BLAME GAMES are for sissies. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpCantRideABike
Trump is a vile racist. It's so obvious. Biden will literally heal the enormous damage Trump has inflicted on the race relations in this nation. I am literally voting for Biden, because I want the racist Trump gone.
Biden is so "Old School", it scares me.  We can't continue to move in circles where the only choices we have are "Old School" or a total outright "Idiot" like tRUMP.  We need progress toward "Common Sense" and a halt to "Slavery" once and "for all peoples".  Mark Charles in 2020.

This tweet is just enraging me for so many reasons. If they instead endorse Biden, would that be a better thing? And what do you mean by ‚Äúpotential‚Äù problem, as if civil servants should ever be giving political endorsements even through a representative.
This Biden?
Biden will heart just as many of not more people, we can at least use Trump to hurt the right people.  The DNC wants to play dirty politics  I'm game
And you're not very convincing, I've at least cited all my shit, nor am I insulting, insulting people doesn't really make me wanna vote for Biden
Oh this ain't a hate vote, he earned it by being more in favor of Medicare for all than Biden, and by giving me 1200 dollars. He's the most liberal president I've had in my lifetime that's for sure
Biden says that under him nothing will change so not sure how that's an argument against Trump
It's alright I understand, I just think it's best to go on the offensive. Progressives won't win bending the knee to biden
I live in Washington. In the d primaries they voted joe biden. I dont know a single person who voted for him. They all went Bernie. I doubt they'll go trump because of the institutional corruption. We have 3 counties who go blue. If we had real elections. Trump would win easily
If Biden wins, do you think he‚Äôll resign before his term his is up so that Pence will pardon him? Is this a possibility?
Trump's even more supportive of universal healthcare than Biden is  please understand, Trump can be used as a weapon against the establishment.
Trump wants your vote, I am a Bernie supporter who's gone Trump, in my eyes, the best way to get the corperate Dems out is to embarrass them in front of America by losing to Trump. It's worked well so far, it'd work even better if Biden loses.  Join me brother, please. Fuck DNC.
Joe Biden has already forgotten that he's getting the nomination.

That's hilarious. You call Kamala, our future Vice President, a nasty woman. You You can't honestly believe you respect any woman in the entire world. You wanna build a statue? Make it of Kamala, because she's going to make history by helping Biden take you down.

Seriously I 'd be thrilled if Biden/Kamala delivered one of these. Ecstatic if more than one.

This is why lesser of 2 evils voting g is problematic. Joe Biden is supposed the most left DNC platform ever but somehow it's way less progressive than every Dem platform until 1980? Literally hasn't been an opposition party since Reagan.

Vote early to make sure you don't see biden on a debate stage
Vote for Biden! (Only if you like living in a democracy, though.)
Right no more bullies
Oh, they've been trying it hard recently. If it makes them feel better to blame me for their candidates sucking shit, then they can blame me if they want. But I would rather wipe my ass with my vote than ever give it to either Joe Biden or Donald Trump.
In the beginning (perhaps, like 48 hours ago) the idea seemed, so exciting (I‚Äôm sure), &amp; the people were overjoyed, but now ‚Äînullified! Obama gave him two terms &amp; now he‚Äôs working Kamala Harris to give him two terms. Joe Biden loves to work the minority &amp; reap all the gain. üëä
Ah, guessing that's a quote from Biden when asked what his foreign policy is?

Joe Biden is exhausting the Oval Office with his bid for the Presidency. Powers of the VP are null &amp; are set into place to advocate &amp; serve the President. If it were not this way, it would defeat constitutionally the purpose of having a President. The President &amp; First Lady lead.

Not to mention he made peace with Russia and N. Korea while the media tried saying he‚Äôd start a world war. He did things people said were never possible. Keep shifting your narrative. Don‚Äôt know how you can refer to him as racist when you have Biden running against him. Lmfao
If Biden &amp; Harris win it will be without my support or my vote
Thought this said Malarky and envisioned an ad where Biden yells malarky at each and every policy failure. That ad would slap, but Markey‚Äôs slaps harder.
Nothing about Biden. Not a fan of or Harris whatsoever.  "COLLAPSE" look around in your America!!! Get your shit together &amp; force a huge stimulus check for the Rest of the year!!!!
Since one could argue Biden is worse than Trump - he shares many of Trump's flaws, has a longer track record of doing so, and has accomplishments like the Iraq War that Donnie still hasn't achieved - you'll forgive me if I take a pass on your Red Team versus Blue Team bullshit.
‚ÄúWe want to win but we‚Äôre scared some random judge will throw them off the ballot in a swing state.‚Äù
And Biden /Harris are actually Center Right. 45 is so far right that he can't even see the middle from where he is.  This conversation with you is worthless, though. You're too far into Putin's pockets to even know reason. So... bye, Felicia!
Ummm... Biden isn't the one who lead to then highest per capita spread of the virus anywhere in the world. That was your boy Trump
Never. We have to rid ourselves of this scum. Biden/Harris!!!
Joe Biden and the Curious Case of the Cognitive Test  via
This is indeed the main reason I'm voting for Biden.
Psst Biden is a conservative LOL
Trump is trying to create a dictatorship by lying and Q s___! and your vote won‚Äôt count with the Post Office dismantling and WEAR A MASK to save 40,000 lives ! Biden=leadership not a golf cheat!
The one who believes Biden's accusers of Sexual Assault and Harassment...
Biden is to the  right of Reagan and they call him progressive
I observed the Democratic Party seems to ride the coattails of ‚Äúsymbolism‚Äù not the truth necessarily. Symbolically, Joe Biden is a snake for what he is trying to do. Hence, silence the minority vote with a minority running mate to win the majority popular vote. üïä
Powers of the VP are limited. This a Trump vs Biden race. Joe Biden has served as VP for 2 terms. If he wins, this will be his 3rd term in the WH. Thus, 12 years in the White House. I wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs qualified. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs greedy &amp; jealous. So, he put Kamala in the mix.

Thank goodness they are covering Biden.
WTF??? Total gaslighting BS! More jobs in the last 3 years than Obama and Biden in the 8 years previous?
A vote for the Biden/Harris ticket is a vote for the destruction of America! #Trump2020
Trump is so bad, it would only make sense if 81% vote for Biden. That would be very healing.
I muted Joe Biden. Trying to decide whether to undo it. üòû
Everyone who says they would have voted for Biden if not for Harris is a Trump supporter.  And always was.  Whether actively or passively.
Bill, she's phony because she accused  of being a racist, and believes his sexual assault accuser...yet, is willing to be is running mate?   Crocodile tears for Biden banning bussing, yet all smiles accepting the nomination.   That qualifies as phony to me!
It brings tears to my eyes of how proud I am but the winner takes all. Once a ‚Äúman‚Äù becomes President the campaign game is over &amp; everything changes. This a Donald Trump vs Joe Biden (who, has already served as VP &amp; understands the procedure) election for Office of the President.
Thank you. Voting Biden/Harris. Also, beware Russian bots and the crap they spew. It‚Äôs amazing how many people lap it up and regurgitate it.
Even if i didnt want a boost   FUCK JOE BIDEN
That's the point.   Biden or Saager????   Actual progressive people that don't have a voice in the Democratic party would vote for Saager. Especially when it comes to a lot of economic issues.  It's not the person.(no duh, I would rather have krystal) it's about any progress
At least you are showing Biden doing something you are incapable of!
This is in fact, really good and worth watching. They shoot straight past the bullshit about Biden/Harris and go right into applying what we know about Movement theory and power relations to our situation now and what to focus on. All of their points are interesting. Good show ü§ò
Yeah. People can vote for Biden if they want. I understand the train of thought. But this "Biden is a good guy / good candidate" thing is an insult to my intelligence AND ignores the important fact that even if he wins you will have to fight against him for every bit of progress.
Joe biden supports antifa because he is a communist just like Trump and the rest. As backed by the communist central bankers who took this country when they killed lincoln. Its called HISTORY.
2.  Legitimacy of the outcome.  His tactic is to overwhelm the system with shit.  So, anything less than a total landslide with all 50 states certifying electors sufficient to give Biden a clear 270 electoral votes, will create the confusion that raises this scenario.

Well Kamala Harris said that Biden is a racist but yet she's joining his ticket.
I'm still gonna vote Biden and Harris.
If you go to post a Facebook post and type in  It brings up Joe Biden for president without even Google or without even going to the Internet it just automatically brings it up on Facebook
This gets into one of the major problems with American politics, and why Obama/Biden led us directly into Trump (and why Biden/Harris would deliver us into the next Trump). Trump singles out Democrats as lying out-of-touch elitists working against Americans' interests...
I gave you an honest answer. I don't fuckin' waste my time with Joe Biden webcasts or whatever. Better things to do.  Many of his lies are promises (or crafted non-promises) he has no intention of keeping. I can't strictly prove it's a lie, but you're a fool if you believe him.

Your homeboy Joe Biden thinks black people who do not vote for him lose their black card.
NEWSFLASH!  Joe Biden was the #2 man in the administration that created the growing economy that Trump destroyed.
Absolutely right. Biden should start holding his own ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù updates for the press every day.
When you vote for Biden/Harris you get a certificate printed that proves you‚Äôre a good person who cares about other people and it‚Äôs gets you BOGO CBD oil from your local Whole Foods
New story in Forbes about how Jared Kushner is manipulating Kanye West into running a spoiler campaign to divert votes from Joe Biden.
200% agree.  I rather have  as president. It's about making the country better. Saager _ I could agree on many things.  I don't agree with much at all when it comes to Biden &amp; Harris. If I do they don't go far enough for the betterment of the American people
The PANDEMIC is highlighting all the failures of our duopoly for the last many decades.   They people like US to close our eyes, shut our mouths &amp; turn off independent thinking &amp; vote 4 biden &amp; Harris. That will eventually lead to a smarter, more organized Trump with a ideology
Good possibility. Even the "squad" massively let's US down. Especially AOC.   Voting for Nancy to be speaker.   Biden has a large part to play in how Trump eventually became president. Going down the rebulican lite path (neo-liberlism) making our w Country worse off got US Trump
I am proud to be part of this milestone on Joe Biden‚Äôs path to becoming the 46th President of the United States. We have 83 days to elect fantastic Democrats up &amp; down the ballot, &amp; I will wake up each day ready to get to work. Will you join me, Team Heck? #giveaheck #heck4ltgov
Biden promised every girlboss running he'd make them VP so they'd all endorse a republican rapist racist, then grabbed Kamala based on correcting the news cycle.  Maybe if your idea of political change is getting women into power try not investing is spineless dupes
I am leaning towards 4 more yrs of Trump, instead of 8-12 more years of neo-liberlism.  Why? The progressive push from 3rd parties will continue.  Millions won't go to sleep if Trump wins again.   Biden administration will be pretty much Trump administration.  4yrs less then 8-12
Mr. Smith was sounding decent earlier about beating Biden or Trump.  Now he shows his true political ideology.   Pandering, identity politics &amp; neo-liberlism
REVEALED: Spoiler candidate Kanye West met with Jared Kushner amid efforts to derail Biden campaign -
Biden and Harris gave emotional and dynamic speeches. Whatever this is from Trump is just droning on and on and on...
. is a great contributor to public discourse. In May, tho, she used her WaPo pedestal to advocate something awful. She was &amp; is wrong. She should apologize.  Yet I wonder if she knew in May Biden's Veep reveal would swallow her book release news?
Every Democrat, including Biden and Harris, needs to amplify the need to defend our Postal Service.
I do wish Biden and Harris had attacked Trump for slowing down the mail. This is an issue which affects everyone.
Biden attacked Anita Hill in support of Clarence Thomas. Biden's been on the wrong side of many key issues (abortion, gay marriage) for most of his career. He straight up campaigned for a Republican in 2018. No reason to think he won't nominate some right-wing "compromise" judge.
I just want you to vote against Trump-I get you aren‚Äôt jazzed by Biden but tyranny is real and it isn‚Äôt far from our reality. You don‚Äôt need to do more- just please don‚Äôt convince others to do less.
Those were excellent speeches from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Kamala is so much more lively than Biden I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they have her taking the reins to keep him off the tv
In isolation, maybe? I guess? Donnie hasn't plunged us into another Iraq War, so that's at least a point in his favor vs Biden. But Donnie says worse things than Biden does.  But this election isn't in isolation. The people lose either way, either for 4 years or for much longer.
Not one time have I heard Vice President Biden say "My Administration"! What a difference this makes for America. #BidenHarris2020
Plus the fact the demand was such a hilarious concession of the point. Five lies in 11 days, from a guy trying to avoid public appearances. Was this person afraid I would name four? I can't even fully attribute the Twitter lie to Biden, as he clearly doesn't run that account.
Yeah, but Joe Biden will probably have someone quite a bit younger help him turn it on.

Young Voters Love Trump's COVID Plan...When Told It's Biden's  via
Idk what to talk about on this weekend's show. Could blabber on about Biden/Harris but who cares. All the leftists lost their Primary in my area. Anybody got links about PNW projects, organizations, upcoming events, reports from protests etc? That's my jam.
It‚Äôs ignorant to vote for someone just because of their political party. Biden will do the exact same things that Trump has done to our country. There are no differences between them. Biden does not give a single shit about minorities. At all.
I was already not voting for Biden and now that he picked Kamala Harris I‚Äôm super not voting for him  (p.s. Trump can fuck off too)
Me too! My heart swelled up with joy, when Biden announced a strong woman as his running mate.
I can't believe that people think that Biden is capable of finding his slippers in his basement. People keep on looking down &amp; not observing what is really going on.
So Biden still did less for America in 40 yrs than Trump has done in 3 1/2 yrs, Thanks, got it! üòÜ
‚Äúwe‚Äôre not voting biden in we‚Äôre voting trump out‚Äù is the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever heard and shows that people really don‚Äôt care about actual policy or change and just want to have their ‚Äúteam win‚Äù
That's what hard. I get that progressives (like myself) are not happy with the Biden/Harris ticket. I personally am weary of establishment Democrats and how much they are corporate sponsored. Biden had an abysmal record. Harris's is pretty bad too. One problem at a time.
Seriously, this 70 IQ Jimmy Dore level essentialism hobbles us as leftists. I‚Äôve explained 1000 ways why not supporting Biden would be disastrous for the left, and your only response is ‚Äúheh... the DNC is corrupt tho‚Äù   I‚Äôm aware, why not address some actual points dummy
No one should rest until Biden &amp; Harris are sworn in.
Don't fall for these hit pieces on Kamala Harris. Kamala is one of the most progressive lawmakers we have. Do your own research &amp; homework! And vote Biden Harris 2020 November 3rd üó≥
So: 4 years of Biden. That doesn‚Äôt mean we stop there. That‚Äôs 4 years of direct action, 4 years of spreading our message instead of Trump dominating the discourse, 4 years of not getting blamed single handedly for Trump‚Äôs re-election, and 4 years of markedly better policy.
My response is we got even closer but ultimately failed because the DNC was organized enough to pull together last minute behind Biden. If I told you an open democratic socialist was a nut hair away from snagging the dem nomination a decade ago, you would laugh at me.
I think he is being facetious. I'm guessing he's a "blood red" Republican and he's taking a shot at Biden by implying that he's NOT Catholic.
The law for running for President is where the person running was born, not the parents! I wish that could be a loop hole, but Biden won‚Äôt win, so no worries! #Trump2020üá∫üá∏üî•
My heart swelled with joy when Biden picked a strong running mate.
I‚Äôll bet the DNC brought that convention lineup to Biden and leveraged jt into the Kamala pick
Really, watch her first debate with Biden. Attacking him, blame blame blame, as she incarcerated minorities..She is a phony, egotistical, and a female version of the current DC executive leadership
Kamala Harris took Biden‚Äôs ticket from a ticket I was voting for out of necessity and desperation to a ticket I‚Äôm excited about.
Kamala Harris does not represent my values anymore then Joe Biden does. However I was never under the impression the VP pick would be an actual labor/socialist/progressive candidate. This ticket is by the wealthy to placate the salary class that feels guilty. Nothing more. üëé
Yeah, for sure. I think something that gets lost in a lot of mainstream discussion of these issues is that for people like me, Bernie was a pretty big compromise. When we get to the point of a Biden/Harris ticket, it goes from being a compromise to an insult.
I tend to believe the change will come (if it ever does) outside of the scope of electoral politics, but I largely agree with Freya here. Biden is a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù choice but my personal political beliefs are such that the difference between the right and ‚Äúleft‚Äù is a rounding error.
Accountability argument isn't going to work. Moving the democrats left is a fucking joke. Democrats have a house majority &amp; Nancy won't even have a vote on #MedicareForAll   Harris record is very conservative &amp; so is Biden.
It is a conservative majority right now &amp; they struck it down.   Supreme Court isn't gonna move anyone. Biden &amp; Harris care about their careers &amp; that's about it.
Supreme Court..... Biden isn't giving 2 shits about the Supreme Court.   Biden picks will be about the same.
Biden &amp; Obama deported 2 million.  Biden was talking about a wall back in the 90s.  Harris is a fucking cop.FUCKING COP!  Biden policies aren't gonna be that different from Trump policies.  It's gonna suck under a Trump or Biden administration.  Neo-liberlism is what got US Trump
Biden would be like ‚Äúc‚Äômon man‚Äù and discourage Hitler from genociding
It‚Äôs almost like these people are bad and have no moral backbone and will always say whatever is best for them in any given moment.
A vote for the Biden/Harris ticket will turn the whole country into a üí©hole!!!
Sorry Liz, but what‚Äôs happening in Portland is not happening under Biden/Harris, it‚Äôs happening under Trump/Pence. Why do Republicans always point at the utter destruction under their policy and say ‚Äúsee look what will happen if you elect Democrats? ARE YOU FUCKEN KIDDING ME???
Is that your Biden phonebanking script?
Oh look they already had it lined up to use Kamala's accusations against Biden.
"The Democrats will save us." lol  Trump was able to attack Hillary from the left because Hillary was an awful candidate - almost as bad as Joe.  You can blame me for the world's ills if you want. But I would rather wipe my ass with my vote than ever give it to Biden or Trump.
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris. But actually.
Actually biden just loves Trump the communist trogen horse and picked someone that no one liked. He KNOWS THIS and just played your ass. Maybe you should get over yourself and the name calling..
That is a compelling case but I still think Trump being elected for four more years is far worse than Biden and Harris winning. Fighting the establishment Dems is a fight for next year and is a fight I will gladly be a part of. But I think, for now, that Trump needs to go.
bernie happily took another 200 billion and gave it to biden and endorsed him. How many times does he have to stomp on your dick before you wake up?
Yeah, I'm a little confused. If people aren't voting for Biden, than who?  Are you voting for Trump?  Wouldn't voting for anyone other than Biden be like voting for Trump as no one else has a chance to win? What could be worse than 4 more from 45?
It surprises me that people actually think a third party vote is a good decision. All it will do is take votes away from Biden/Kamala and hand the country back to Trump so he can destroy it even more.  We need to get more people to vote. Not voting is a huge waste.
James, you ain't black if you consider not voting for Joe Biden.
I am going to put an American flag on one corner of my truck and  Biden/Harris flag on the other.  I‚Äôm going to drive the streets of Olympia, Wa and show that the flag belongs to all of us.  I hope I can start a movement with this.  ITS OUR FLAG!!  Not trump supporters!!!
I know with just over 3k followers this might not get much traction, but hear me out. When I see a flag flying on the back of any vehicle, I think ‚ÄúTrump supporters‚Äô. Today I decided that I‚Äôm taking the flag back. As soon as a Biden/Harris flag is available 1/2
100% Riden with Biden.
Nada, I wouldn't mess with you man. You look like you're all out of bubble gum. Biden and Harris aren't perfect for me, but I gotta start somewhere.
GET YOUR WEAPONS AMERICA, IF BIDEN AND HARRIS GET INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, YOUR RIGHT TO OWN AND BARE ARMS IS GONE. IMAGINE NIT BEING ABLE TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY. NEXT PEOPLE WILL DISAPPEAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AFTER GOVERNMENT VISITS.
If they were smart they would've had a plan for whoever Biden chose. But we're talking abt Trump here. Smart he is not.

This Biden campaign so predictable cuz they‚Äôre not actually letting him make decisions (which is smart).
Getting to watch #MayaRudolph as #KamalaHarris  is just icing on the cake for Biden‚Äôs decision. #BidenHarris2020
I agree with this. Today's announcement has created so much positive momentum for the campaign. Biden dominated the news cycle and neither he nor Harris said a word in public. Tomorrow their joint appearance will generate more positive buzz, leading perfectly into the convention.
It boggles my mind how you can be so snarky while being such a damn sucker.  8 years of Obama/Biden delivered us directly into Trump. So where would a Biden presidency deliver us?  You want us to vote for the guy opposing M4A while telling us to in-person vote during a pandemic?It's unclear that [Biden] winning at the ballot box is going to solve very many of the problems that might be causing the revolutionary tension.
Ouch, yeah. I first thought you were subtweeting more the people still upset that Biden got the D nomination. But you're also ‚Äî perhaps? ‚Äî alluding to whether a certain celebrity's sudden candidacy could siphon off just enough votes to effect a state or two like I na√Øvely worry?

Mr Biden's twitter writer.  I am wondering if Mr Biden told you to say that.  I would like to know what has changed since Mr Biden tried to freeze social security.  I would say half of Biden's career (50 years) was trying to destroy social security.  Why would we believe you?

Even Biden isn't that senile.  If he has Hillary Clinton emptying trash cans at the Dept. of Agriculture she'll be on the news every day of the week.  If he made her Ambassador to Zambia she'd have a pan-African war going on within a month.

So ‚Ä¶ in this scenario, Trump is the hare and Biden is the tortoise? Is that what I'm supposed to take away? We all know how that turned out, right?  Also, do you really want to show Biden as strong enough to propel a handcar by himself, esp. after his bike ride, this wknd?  #Sad
Another amusing quote by Mr Biden which is totally empty of any content what so ever.  Are you ever going to say anything useful at all?  If you think you are going to boost our confidence with "we can do it", you got another thing coming.  Please STOP!

That Kamala Harris youthful exuberance &amp; confidence totally overshadowed Joe Biden today - and that's ok #mamala
Biden will get 100% because if you don't vote for him " "you ain't black"! You need #PedoJoe's permission if you want to retain your black ethnicity!
Interesting that you pointed to her, I've said that this is turning into the Democratic version of McCain vs Obama... Biden and Harris are the antithesis of what their party wants and although Trump isn't favorable, the 'hold your nose and vote' doesn't inspire people.
Joe Biden was a member of the first Biracial administration. Now he will continue that as a new tradition, and make another first as a member of the first Bigender administration.  Hell Trump can claim to record for most corrupt.  #VoteBrightBlueAmerica
Of course that's what you want because you know Biden is slippin
If Biden can not debate Trump, how would he run the country?  It is a very very weak move by a very weak man.  Your suggestion that there be no debates just reminds me that the man has locked himself in his basement afraid to speak.
Biden is Catholic
And here you are, passive aggressively tweeting and hiding. Faceless for a reason? Just vote the Biden ticket and get over yourself. üôÑüôÑüôÑ
Trump is only wrong in that this would happen if Biden gets elected. He could lose the election to  and we‚Äôd all be better off.

You think Sleepy Joe Biden, the most establishment politician that ran this year would choose a VP that actually wants fundamental change? Keep dreaming, brotha.
Another winner of a decision by Mr Biden.
Just a very gentle reminder that we can (and should) criticize Biden/Harris while also realizing that they are both 1000X better than the current jackasses.
"Joe Biden nailed this decision. By choosing Senator Kamala Harris as America's next vice president, he's underscored his own judgment and character. Reality shows us that these attributes are not optional in a president."  - Barack Obama on Biden-Harris

As I read through these posts I‚Äôm concerned! So many uneducated grown-ups. Acting like children. Just running with the fact that they hate Donald Trump. Wanting to elect an old man ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù  who is in early stages of dementia. WTF?
I am a follower of Biden cause I want to hear what that idiot has to say next.  It did not take long for me to figure out that he is too stupid to write his own tweets.
Second World War (??) Trump running neck n neck with Biden in the race for most gaffes  Let's just call it a draw &amp; move on
I am sorry Mr Biden, a socialist government does not work for me or most Americans.  You can take your plans and put them away cause you will not ever have a chance to implement them.  Thanks but no thanks.
It means China thinks they can work with Biden and HOPES he wins. Russia likes Trump and is CHEATING our systems to HELP him win.

Christie should tell trump to get a dog, ride a bike and show true empathy and he‚Äôll at least be  1% of Biden
This all day long. Biden‚Äôs not bragging about riding a bike, just doing it. Trump uses drinking one handed in a rally as a strength!
Whoever Biden's twitter writer is, is clueless.  Biden is now completely out of the picture.  I suspect he will start using AI for his videos.  I demand he start appearing in person!

Who has any Biden clothes?
Biden last seen on a bicycle, you're last seen on a golf cart, big comparison, big, no one has ever seen anything like that before.
We have a virtual reality candidate.  AI has advanced enough to allow someone to look like Biden and actually be someone else!!!!  Is this what is happening?  It most certainly could be happening.  Trump can not agree to a virtual reality debate!!
How many strikes does Biden get before MSM decides its a lost cause?  ha ha ha... I think they should double down.
Awaiting Biden's VeeP pick.
Only people who show signs of impairment take the test. Trumps already taken it Biden hasn‚Äôt. Let‚Äôs use deductive reasoning on that one
I don‚Äôt think you understand. You‚Äôre referring to intelligence and Biden still has trump beat. Nice try though
That sounds like a conspiracy theory, Mr Biden.  You don't believe in conspiracies do you?  Once you wake up, the election should be over and you will have lost.... if they let you actually run.... bwa ha ha ha ha ha...
How the fuck is Trump and Biden the BEST America has to offer smh üòÖ
Biden is a racist!  He is so racist after 50 years of hurting minorities that he doesn‚Äôt understand how to correct for it. Trump 2020!
What planet are these people on?  I see it as msm are so biased toward Biden that nobody believes in them any more.   You could say they are so stupid it‚Äôs backfired.  Nobody wants their opinion any more.
We don't need to attract repubs to Biden. We need to attract the other 45% of people who are independent and often don't bother to vote. Repubs are always going to vote for real Repugs over Repug-Lite in bigger numbers. Excite the base who's more progressive if you want to win!
So, the dems are trying to mislead again and say the Russians are interfering again with the elections.  Being as nice as possible, you would have to be naive to fall for that again.  It certainly does not require Russia to find a way to denigrate Biden.  He does it to himself.
Setting for Biden is not an option.
I don‚Äôt care if Joe Biden can‚Äôt ride a tricycle, pees his pants and can only say three words... he is still light years ahead of Donald Trump. If Joe Biden takes a nap for four years straight he will have a better presidency than Trump
My 23 year old College Junior (he took a couple years to find himself before college...lived in Leipzig, Germany coaching American football at 19) sent me this yesterday.  Yes he is registered to vote and says all his friends are voting Biden. He‚Äôs in Arkansas.
Where is Biden‚Äôs helmet?
I dont understand why people think he would take Biden votes. Only people insane enough to vote for Trump will vote for Kanye.
Read the thread. China and Iran may be advocates for Biden. There is no sign that they are attempting to subvert our election.  Russia on the other hand is actively trying to subvert our election in favor of Trump. Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley are helping them. MAGA Senators
John Lewis.  Dig him up and he‚Äôs more articles than Biden.
receiving Russian info on Biden to help Trump?
I bet Biden iz excited about finding out who his running mate will be.
why do you have someone writing your twitter messages.  Trump writes his own.  You should have Biden learn how to communicate with the public.  This is a freaking disgrace.
Unless Biden is elected.
Kanye shouted out the quiet part. Oops.
Russia doesn‚Äôt want Biden to win. China doesn‚Äôt want Trump to win. We used to fight our battles using proxies.  Now WE are the proxy in THEIR battle.  Your MAGA hat brought us to the kids table. Happy now?
Counterintelligence chief: Russia aiming to ‚Äúdenigrate‚Äù  ahead of election
Maybe Donald is throwing in the towel? Should Biden just take it from here? Is that a hidden message you‚Äôve given?
Your words are marked.  I suppose if you are wrong on this (I suspect you are wrong on most things), it still would not convince you to vote for Trump.  Trump is articulate, says what he means and means what he says.  He is the opposite of Biden, who really can't say a sentence.
That's my point, I'm a gun owner for life, and I'll accept any regulation I have to follow. First thing Biden should do is ban assault rifles and pistols. Get back to hunting, target, and protecting the home, period.
I truly try to understand you VP Biden
You voting for Joe or against Trump.  Nobody in their right mind would vote for Biden.  Trump has had a very peaceful 4 years as POTUS, helped a lot of people and rebuilt our military.  I don't think he has been callous at all.  I guess I need some examples.  Trump 2020!
I 100% agree.  Let's get the vote out.  Let's see what kind of following the dems get after your campaign -- everyone needs to vote.  The future of America is on the line and Biden looks to destroy it!  Make it clear to all involved.  We like America the way it is!  Trump 2020!
OK, this stuff pisses me off.  Joe Biden is a devout Catholic. I may have my issues with Catholic dogma, but I have no reservations about Biden's beliefs in, or intentions toward, either Christianity or our nation.  How are evangelicals suckered by this despotic ass?
Biden refuses to refer to God.  He is the anti-religion candidate the way Obama was -- unless you want to consider the muslim religion.  I also think you are anti-God Mr Kristol.  I mean let's get serious here.
Jesus. Biden has owned that car since it was new, in '67. I'm not going to nail him to a cross for buying a car in his 20s AND THEN KEEPING IT IN GOOD CONDITION.  I hope when he's done with the country, it's restored to a similar condition.  Go find something else to bitch about.
God help us no. Trump and the shameful racist republicans are using him to attempt taking votes away from Biden. They. Are. Using. Him.Does anyone else wonder how Biden can tweet but not finish an audible sentence?
Sure, Hillary can serve in a Biden Administration. Joe will have a cheeseburger and fries. Hold the onions.

I‚Äôm not ‚Äúcrazy about‚Äù Biden, either, but we‚Äôre in a fight for our lives, our community, our country, and our moral compass. The only vote that makes sense is Biden/Harris.
I wonder if she is voting for Biden like me...
We will be rejoicing after you are voted out. We will celebrate your loss! We will be elated by your demise ! We will dance once you are convicted of crimes against our country! We will dance when Biden is the president! Good bye EVIL TRUMP!
Bullshit...Biden is incompetent and your character is seriously flawed. What possibly could go wrong in a Biden/Harris administration? How about the collapse of the U.S. economy, accelerated erosion of  constitutional rights, and armed conflict within our borders.
I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this but Kanye is going to take more votes from Trump than he will from Biden
I can‚Äôt wait until I can say President Biden!!
Trump looks in a mirror and pretends what he sees is Biden. He may not have the intellectual capacity to realize it, but he‚Äôs talking about himself. About the only things he is good at is lying and projection.
Sure, let's go full government dictatorship. Trump, the authoritarian, needs to become even more authoritarian--like Biden and (especially) Harris. You ever hear of states, and the Constitution as it applies to state and federal authority.
I'm a white woman going to vote for #Biden. I like #KamalaHarris. #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden raised $26 million in the 24 hours after he named Kamala Harris as his running mate, doubling his previous one-day record.
- are you make g an implied threat to Joe Biden?
I can not believe how stupid people are on this page.  They are going to sit out of the race and not vote for Biden. What ignorance and arrogance. Not to mention the privilege that you have in order to sit this one out. Trump will be elected because of these morons. Black men?
Yes he did, Mr 'I alone can fix it', he sure as hell did-now, Mrs Vice President,üéâwe need you &amp; Mr President Biden to repair this beautiful country of ours
Hey girl, let's do this! BIDEN/HARRIS2020üéâ
Jo has no chance of winning this cycle. She and the Independent party stand to kill and replace the GOP by endorsing thr Biden/Harris ticket. Harris, being the most pro-cop Dem, can attract disillusioned GOP voters. Jo can gain in the long run by playing ball now.
If your take is ‚ÄúTrump and Biden are both trash so I‚Äôm not gonna vote‚Äù You‚Äôre basically saying you‚Äôre fine with how things are currently tbh

Biden is Catholic
Yeah real ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù. A woman who openly said she believes the victims Biden sexually assaulted and calls him a racist, now, accepting his call to be his VP candidate to further her career. She‚Äôs a beyond repulsive. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
This is the depression talking, but at this point I don‚Äôt f***ing care about Biden‚Äòs shortcomings. 45‚Äôs negligence has helped kill multiple friends and family members in three months. I‚Äôm done. I don‚Äôt care who gets him out or what they‚Äôve done,  I just need him f***ing gone.

Thanks for regurgitating the GOP talking points that were emailed as out as soon as Biden‚Äôs VP pick was announced. üôÑ
Just a very gentle reminder that we can (and should) criticize Biden/Harris while also realizing that they are both 1000X better than the current jackasses.
Biden picked the cop :(
Of course that is only one aspect of the prison issue. There are the 3 strikes laws, the overly harsh drug penalties. Something Biden had a hand in and has apologized for.   trump is calling Harris "nasty" for standing up to Biden.  Biden rewards her.  That is #BidenIntegrity
Trump four more years! Thank you Biden.
This is map I want to see!  Biden/Harris is a winning team that will get us there
Keep telling you Joe Biden will never be president he secured it today Kamala Harris good choice

Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate
She‚Äôs very unlikeable.  She got eliminated early in the race because of that.  She will not help Biden, and will pave the way for Nikki Haley in 24 should Biden win.  Pete B was the choice; Demings &gt;&gt; Harris.

Don‚Äôt know about Arizona but in Washington one neighbor had a yard full of trump signs until Trump made comments about god and Biden hating god. The next day all signs of trump were gone.  Voters are waking up.

Today's major issue for the Democrats; Trump says "Thighland" then immediately corrects himself. Biden says "huh...who's  thigh?" And immediately asks what state is he in, followed by, "where are the restrooms?"
Ok. I‚Äôm voting for low taxes, a strong economy, a strong military, conservative justices and the repeal of Obama Care and Roe v. Wade.   No to Biden. Yes to Trump.
He's senile like Biden.
Most normal people are voting for Mr. Biden. Trump is crazy and trying to kill everyone. No contest, voting blue is all we can do.
