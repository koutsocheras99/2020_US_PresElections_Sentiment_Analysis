Trump is POTUS in name only
Have you ever caught yourself in the middle of an argument with a Trump supporter, and you realize what the fuck am I doing here?
How do you figure that he is racist or senile? What proof do you have, except for Trump's need to find some way to insult him, nickname him, turn him into a monster like Trump is? He could never compete with Obama, could never even begin, so he tried to erase Obama's legacy. 1/
Trump isn‚Äôt just running against Joe Biden. He‚Äôs running against a virus that doesn‚Äôt belong to a political party, doesn‚Äôt watch Fox News, &amp; doesn‚Äôt care how many times the president of the US tries to wish it away. The virus has a big vote this year,
Just as you think you have him cornered. He didn't just know Epstein. They were in business together. Trump was behind it all. That is why Trump had to make sure that Epstein never got the chance to talk... And why he wishes Maxwell "well" so much... Just a... Reminder.  3/
Now that we've covered the racism side of Trump, what about his other side? The side of him that oozes from him like pus, like a diseased wound weeping its infected, rotten, acrid fluids, turning noses and stomachs of everyone who catches a glimpse of his true self 1/

I never really liked Republicans but I'm 100% against them now Their patronizing of Trump's ignorance is more than I can stand
Remember Russia put Put Bounties On Are Troops, and Trump did nothing.
Trump‚Äôs cognitive decline is very apparent when you compare it with Trump from five years ago. Never mind that he‚Äôs a corrupt criminal traitor who is going to be wiped out in a blue tsunami.
If Trump went to prison, he‚Äôd be the prey, not the predator. Some big bad dude would make him wear lipstick and pigtails and answer to Cindy.‚Äù
#VoteOutRacism is trending. So I say #VoteOutRacism and vote for Trump and the GOP, the ORIGINAL anti-racism party. The party that doesn‚Äôt say things like ‚Äúthe black community isn‚Äôt diverse‚Äù or ‚Äúpoor kids are just as smart as white kids‚Äù

Trump and the Republican Party will forever be known as the party who gave TRILLIONS away to big businesses but said NO to $600 per week for unemployed Americans.
If you truly believe that Donald Trump isn't a racist, the inside of your mind must be a terrifying, confusing place. Biden may have made some gaffes, But Trump is an outright racist...
We will lose some Trump voters so there is that
You people think Americans are idiots. Everyone except Trump cultists can see through this bullshit. It has been the law of the land for 10 years. Maybe get your criminal president to drop his lawsuits against ACA
I merged my accounts and saw this on here it is still relevant today. I wonder how many others have lost previously okay relationships to Trump and his madness?
Could either be a Bernie Bro (and I was a Bernie supporter) or a troll / disinformation source.  By his policies Biden actually has the most progressive platform of any Democratic pres candidate ever.  Progressives should be ok with that.  Esp compared to Trump, good lord.
Okay. You don‚Äôt get to insult people &amp; then act like a whiny little brat when someone tells you to stop. Trump is toxic. He doesn‚Äôt give a shit about you.

The stimulus thing makes me wonder whether certain Republican senators are using the pretty heavy cover of their incumbency and fiscal responsibility to hurt Trump here. I think there are at least some that would trade four years of Biden for a more traditional GOP again.
Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare
In regard to #3, maybe that's why I'm less certain. Even if things only get marginally better, instead of marginally worse, Trump could sell a steady hand and people may be stupid enough to buy it. But you're probably correct that things will get worse. No stimulus is killer.
Remember üëá.  Trump = Hitler.  Hides in a bunker; separates children from parents; deploys secret police, etc.  WAKE UP.

Criminal. Trump and the GOP have no bottom. Doing everything they can to steal another election. Putin continues to have his way. This is pathetic.
Did...Trump write this tweet...?
Wrong. It‚Äôs right there on the HHS page. The ACA (aka Obamacare) says you can‚Äôt be denied due to pre existing conditions under the plan you get from your employer, which is what most Americans have. Trump Republicans are being conned by a charlatan.

Thanks for proving my point. Trump was referring to the killing thousands of protesters in Tiannamen Square. So you are saying that the way to deal w/ protesters who want democracy is by attacking them viciously and horribly. Congrats, you just aligned yourself with the CCP.
I question this. Why would China want Biden to win. With Trump, they continue to see America, diminished as a world power. Plus they know to just wave money in front of him and he will follow.

this godly version is an idolater and con man, brandishing a Bible after threatening to deploy the military to crack down on protesters. Several have accused Trump of exploiting religion for political benefit while holding little belief in religious tenets.
I'm guessing he's going to have the chance to "sue" the jail again as, if he's on probation, that's going to send him right back where he belongs. Calling Donald Trump ain't gonna save his a$$.
Unlike the crimes the Obama administration perpetrated on Trump.  As always, liberals morality is always self serving.  Real crimes versus "I don't like you so I'm gonna harass you".  This is not a 2A lawsuit anyway. Focus please.
That is too abstract. You must look in detail, what vote moves you toward, or less far away, from your goal. Trump has moved further away from Progressive goals than Clinton would have. I.e. $2,000,000,000,000 less revenue for m4a. $26 trill. Debt harms future m4a support.
So is government officials using federal law enforcement to spy in political candidates.  Why aren't all those people in jail?  Of course, the NRA is a conservative organization so we will trump up charges and use them. This is political pure and simple.
You really think so? Dude isn‚Äôt okay in the head. Neither is Trump of course... I don‚Äôt think competence is what Biden will bring personally... maybe his cabinet will at least be okay?

This is comment is un intelligent and weak.  It could literally be said about anything Trump does that does not involve COVID.  C‚Äômon. Do better ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüá∫üá∏
Saw your tweet but not the preceding ones. Had to look to see if you meant Kanye or Trump.
I know, I've blocked more bots &amp; trump trolls than I've retweeted or commented on. Have actually chopped/cracked a few teeth, grinding them bc of their insane coments, just like their bogus
I think key will be the 6% of Orman voters in 2018 Gov. Couldnt stomach Kobach and couldn‚Äôt vote for a Dem. will 2 more years of trump mania plus a more ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù Dem candidate push them to Bollier w/o a 3rd party candidate?
To make it simple..... list his accomplishments in regards to serving justice for Trump...... I‚Äôm waiting
I think people are looking too much into the fact that Marshall isn‚Äôt Kobach but overlooking that fact that Bollier isn‚Äôt Kelly. B is a former JoCo GOP. Kelly is a Topeka Dem forever. Some of those Trump-Kelly voters may see similar choice with different dynamics.
It is difficult to debate silly putty. The man can‚Äôt answer a question or stay on topic. tRump‚Äôs responses are nothing but nonsense &amp; attacks. That‚Äôs not a debate. I would also suggest that debates are not going to change anybody‚Äôs mind. I don‚Äôt know why we plan to have them.
160,000+ people are dead because of the incompetence of this WH and tRump betrayed our troops. He colluded with Russia and goes golfing every weekend. If jobs have been added it‚Äôs in spite of him not because of him.
Trump will never take action to control the virus.  In the first place, he is incompetent and doesn‚Äôt know what to do. In the second place, taking action now would be an admission that he was wrong to ignore it and call it a hoax six months ago.
The trump campaign ALSO thinks that chldrn don‚Äôt die from Covid; doesnt know the difference between England and B.C;thinks Finland is part of Russia and that Venezuela is part of the United States &amp;he does not ( can not ???) read! Are the debates even needed?
The problem is these headlines say ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù or ‚Äútrump charity‚Äù without actually mentioning what the charity was supposedly for. ‚ÄúKids with cancer‚Äù really gets one‚Äôs attention.
Trump campaign has nothing real on Biden so they have to make it up:
Why? Marshall is in that spot where he was trump skeptical before run (2016 Kasich guy) so couldn‚Äôt get the endorsement so had to be Trumpy during primary in a state wear growing area is more moderate (JoCo). He‚Äôs favorite but not surprising (see McSally 2018)
OMG! They're digging deep to even get donors.      Lara Trump: The President wants to know if you want the 2020 MAGA Hat that he signed for you. Can I tell him you're interested? Donate &amp; WIN NOW:
I believe most determined ppl would wait for 8 days to get Trump out.
Trump wings it as he goes along. No structured plan since he stole the WH

Did not see this in US news. Apparently, it does not fit the narrative of Trump encouraging Russian interference.

Trump was a NY real estate developer for decades. He is used to being hated like this. Dude has a really thick hide.
Yeah it does, because Trump is the Republican party. These others are RINO's! Like your dad.
So, Trump pronounced Thailand as #Thighland . Will he struggle w Phuket, which is one of Thailand's popular tourist spots? #Thailand #Phuket #Dynang River
If Donald Trump is correct and Joe Biden can hurt God, maybe I should start saying "Bidendamnit."

The ‚ÄúBiden is against God‚Äù strategy will be the thing that does trump in, because NOBODY believes that and EVERYBODY can see the desperation.
Where there is smoke there will be fire.  #45 just digging a deeper hole for himself.   So pathetic.  Trump Signs Executive Order That Will Effectively Ban Use Of TikTok In the U.S.
There is no way in hell that Hilary is anywhere close to this ticket. People's disdain for her is what got Trump elected. Had the dems gotten rid of their super delegates retarded rules, Bernie is our current president. They gave Trump the victory because she is despised by all.

Just because he said yeah yeah doesn‚Äôt mean he wasnt indicating he wasnt understanding that.  The problem is you‚Äôre assuming, and I quite frankly am assuming what his intentions were.  Know who wasn‚Äôt?  Flynn who pleaded guilty!  Then more corruption from Barr, and Trump occurred
Not hilarious truth.  You can try to con your way out of it.  Trump asked for their help on tv.  Flynn acknowledged from the ambassador something had to be done about the sanctions.  Went on further, and said soon as they‚Äôre in office they‚Äôll see what their relationship will be.
yeah Trump is probably going to get another four years
I've been kinda busy the last few days. Has trump told an old school Polack joke yet? I have this one in my office pool.
Actually in 8 years, Obama spent about $97M for vacations. Trump has spent about $109M in less than 4. Next unvalid point???
Prayers for President Trump. Very rich enemies out there...
Plummer Trump.
Yup. I like my mask. I keep six feet on purpose and usually avoid groups. But when the vaccine is approved and I think it‚Äôs sooner than not..We should be coming together and enjoying masking up knowing it‚Äôs less than a year before we‚Äôre done. But Trump can‚Äôt put US before him.
If Donald Trump said this, everyone would want him arrested or even say to have him be put in the electric chair
I actually grew up with republican parents. I had hoped Romney would win because Trump was such a buffoon. But if Biden winning means that all this crap stops, we get a gentleman in office and a VP who can SPELL VP!! and can return dignity. Let‚Äôs GO!
Well they would. Remember when Trump banned travel to Europe, everyone was on his ass.
Trump never gives, never negotiates; it's always "take it or I'll take my marbles and go home." For Trump it's black-and-white:  "I win or I lose."
She should debate Trump. Not a fair fight.
Pelosi: if you want to be an advocate for them‚Ä¶No how about she says the truth and you don‚Äôt like it, we see you  And know what you‚Äôre doing, your whole goal is about getting Trump out of office instead of working for the people that elected you..shameful
I know you‚Äôre smarter than that Beckel,you just hate Trump.
They hate Trump so much that they want to see the American people suffer‚Ä¶ Democrats let that sink in for a minute
‚ÄúThis latest iteration is simply more of the right doing Trump‚Äôs bidding for him to distract from his own Russia problems, which are real and a grave threat to our national security.‚Äù
Oh my god we are going back to Clinton.  You are a trump supporter.  If they did anything wrong then they should be punished as well.  But a republican lead investigation determined there was no wrong doing.
This is straight out of a Trump universe. I'm going to take away your education because you told the truth. I weep for humanity.
Trump is NOT pushing any vaxx agenda for mandatory vaxx.  He is pushing for it to be available to the freaked out frightened people who are desperate for it.
If Trump banning Tik Tok doesn‚Äôt motivate Gen Z to vote him out of office, nothing will.
Trump didn‚Äôt deny any of O‚ÄôDonnell‚Äôs specific allegations in a subsequent (1997) Playboy¬†magazine interview ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe stuff O‚ÄôDonnell wrote about me is probably true,‚Äù Trump said at the time.
Thank you for sharing. Unfortunately they were probably trying to keep up with this guy..
Seems as relevant as ever.
The Book Trumped by O'Donnell came out in 1991. Attributed quotes to Trump:  "I‚Äôve got black accountants. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day."
Suggesting you will throw your vote away with a meaningless gesture and potentially helping Trump be re-elected indicates you are all about yourself rather than the country.  Sad.
The religious frauds are the evangelicals that follow tRump!
Never Republican doesn‚Äôt mean Never Trump
Does anyone remember....‚ÄùTrump will NEVER be President‚Äù? Does anyone remember Rachel Maddow....‚ÄùTrump is basically a Russian Op‚Äù? Does anyone remember...‚ÄùITS MUELLER TIME‚Äù? Does anyone remember.... ‚ÄúHillary called Trump to concede the election‚Äù?   Yeah, me neither.
The Postmaster General is a Trump appointee and a huge campaign donor. You cannot believe anything he says.
If that doesn't put you in the mood for Donald Trump, how about "Don't Fear the Reaper"?
Trump to sign an executive order that will halt evictions, possibly extend the 600$ unemployment benefit among other things. Dems want a trillion dollars which Trump rightly said that it‚Äôs really just a bailout for Democratic run cities. Just say NO.
Another Trump supporter will not be voting this November
Who would be afraid to debate Donald Trump?   Hahahahaha  Hahahahaha  Hahahahaha  Hahahahaha   I would just fact check him every time he opened his lying mouth.
What is wrong with us?  If Biden is really having health issues why are his handlers allowing him to be denigrated, brunt of jokes and ridiculed? Surely something can be done about this.  Politics be damned.  I will be voting for Trump and praying for Biden.
Here is some real stuff.
Just more Bullshit.
Trump is waiting for his Penthouse to be completed in Trump Tower Moscow then he will load up the family &amp; probably try to keep Air Force One in Russia for himself!
Congress needs to quit adding pork to the bills they pass. They pass bills and add things that don‚Äôt even have anything to do with the bill and President Trump can't line item Bills. The Supreme Court declared line items vetoes for the president unconstitutional in 1998.
are clearly hurting on getting enough people to pledge to his reelection. Currently with $100 or more you can get an autographed picture of tRump and...wait for it...a signed MAGA hat. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
And thnx to our President...the military will defend Trump. So step on up!
If Trump was actually a Christian he wouldn‚Äôt think anyone could hurt the Bible or hurt God.
You'd do better to reject Trump instead of to embrace him.

If trump said something like this......
Now, THIS is desperation and also complete crap. Biden is a devout Catholic. As far as I can tell, Trump practices no religion at all.
also a reminder that biden agreed to rejoin the paris climate agreement and provide healthcare reform that would help with the climate change and virus issues that trump denies even exist
Amanda loves Trump. Just watch her sychophanty ads.
Fauci has already made it clear her is only staying for us and doing what he can. I also think that trump knows Fauci is the one he can't f*%k with.
My guess has always been that Trump doesn't really want a second term, he just wants to destroy the country. So he'll do anything to accomplish the objective.
Nope. Trump is far worse at confusion than Biden will ever be or ever has been. No comparison.
No one really wants Biden to win they‚Äôre just desperate for Trump to lose. Huge difference. It‚Äôs hard to rally behind a candidate no one truly believes in so all the energy is being thrown at attacking any threatening opposition
I suppose the man is pleased Trump held the Bible upside down, not thinking about the similarity with the upside-down cross in devil worship. But yeh.
The scenario continues in which Trump-minion raise the bar for Trump to crush their expectations.
Trump should of known that before agreeing to the schedule.
That‚Äôs funny because Trump reminds me of Lloyd Bridges.
*This was Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúon mssg‚Äù moment?
Your performance in Baltimore was a sham and a failure. After listening to you on Fox News talk about the Trump team downward spiral tells me you are either stupid or a purveyor of wrong information. Probably the second. When you talk about polls it showed you know nothing C 2016
I'm guessing that Trump was thinking of Epstein Island when he talked about Thighland.
How dumb do they all feel now that it‚Äôs been proven that hydroxychloriquin actually works and helps if used early on?? Such morons on the left. They could have promoted to help save lives but instead chose Trump derangement syndrome.
Holy....shoot. If Trump said this buildings would be burned. Sad thing is I‚Äôm guessing he didn‚Äôt meAn to say it. Sadder is that his wife allows this clearly sick man to be running for the most stressful job in the world. This should tell you everything you need to know about libs
The CDC, the WHO and nearly every health agency and developed country in the world recommends or mandates masks. Even the Trump Administration says masks are good things. But, hey, if you want to follow Sweden let's be sure to do that in other aspects of public policy too.
I said what has Trump said that is racist?
The secret service agents tear gassed them, not Trump.
What has Trump said that is racist?
If Trump said this, everyone would say he should go to the electric chair!
Trump is causing all this chaos.
tRump says you "hate God." A suggested response, Proverbs 6, lines 16 through 19. 1/3
Trump is a horrible person to even think something so evil. What is wrong with his mind?  Get him out of office ASAP  He‚Äôs poisoning America every second he‚Äôs allowed to squat in the WH
Remember, it‚Äôs not the NRA leadership‚Äôs fraud that Trump is unhappy about. It that they got caught.
After the election Biden will need to set up a separate, well staffed division in the Justice Dept (criminal &amp; civil) just to go after Trump &amp; his ilk for unprecedented crimes and profiteering to loot the US government &amp; its people. Will probably take over ten years to unravel.
I can‚Äôt imagine Fauci wants Trump to be in office when it is approved. Like Carter with the hostages, they were released when Reagan took office. My guess is first available late November-December.
Are US  govt / Trump accounts labeled as well?
Trump is a fraud who is killing people.
Wife's uncle passed away.  Of course that side of the family is Catholic and having full-on visitation and funeral.  People are flying in to attend. My wife in tears saying, "Are we the only ones who get it?" No honey, they haven't taken science classes and voted for Trump.
Trump thinks he is the head of the Republican Party. If he wants Congress to pass a relief act he just needs to tell McConnell to pass the stimulus bill passed by the House in May. Republicans won‚Äôt pass the House bill and won‚Äôt negotiate with Democrats to pass a Senate version.
I often think how easier some things would be if I wasn't born with a conscience like Trump and the billionaires
If Trump would have said that how soon would Pelosi and Schumer call for a press conference?
Back to this? Flip flop until it all makes sense? Okay sweetheart. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ It worked long before Trump, it works FOR Trump, it will work after Trump. We're just expanding who's eligible.
They show ACTUAL photos of Trump. NOT photoshopped pics. It's sad the number of ignorant, brainwashed, people still support this corrupt criminal. Just remember, if you die from COVID, "it is what it is". THAT's how much your mango messiah cares about you losers.
Nary a peep of outrage from Trump family supporters!

Maybe she is voting for Jo Jorgensen. That is the most rational choice. Biden is senile and Trump is not the sharpest knife in the drawer.  Trump apparently is not a war monger but the idea of Biden with the nuclear football is truly frightening.

What is up with Trump's chair? I noticed the same in the Chris Wallace interview. It looks like an adult sitting in a kid's chair.
trump signed an executive order to ban tiktok but couldn‚Äôt sign one to get immediate relief to struggling americans while the house/senate/whoever bicker about what a relief bill should look like. smh.
The legacy of Trump won't be tax cuts, no war in the middle east, military investment or even the economy.  Those can be erased in 6 months.   Legacy will be opening the realm of genuine, populist middle class politics on the Right.   A playbook for future, even stronger leaders.
Got on the list.   Somehow I'm both Ye and Trump 2020.   Good place to be.
Teach me how to be pious like you Chad. How does a sinner like myself attain the virtue you speak of, by voting for Trump?
It‚Äôs been an incompetent mess for years. Well before Trump.
HUGE NEWS.  Trump is a moron.  Wait, that‚Äôs not news.
The golf club crowd is now cheering Trump's attacks on the media and booing a question that Trump didn't like. And with that, he ended the press conference.   I don't know why I watch these events.
In response to a follow-up question about Russian interference in the election, Trump says the biggest threat of foreign interference is mail-in ballots. ffs.
Now Trump is back to his claim that if he had lost in 2016, the United States would now be at war with North Korea.
Question about Russia trying to meddle in the election to help Trump. Trump says he "doesn't care" what the intelligence says b/c he says that he is harder on Russia than anyone.
Trump seems to have retreated from his nationwide federalization of policing. He said today that the feds can only go to cities with permission (which he said they are waiting for in Illinois and Oregon). I have no explanation for the apparent change.
Trump says that a "Favored Nation Clause" that he issued will mean that people in the U.S. will be able to buy drugs at whatever the lowest price the drug is available in any other country.
Trump just said that he is issuing an executive order that will require all insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions. "This has never been done before." No other details were provided.
Trump actually qualified his statement about testing being the reason for increased U.S. cases. He actually changed it to "one of the reasons" that cases are increasing. Progress.
The administration is really looking for odd data slices to make its COVID-19 response look good. Trump just said that more than half of U.S. counties reported fewer than 20 cases last week. üòï
Trump just ad-libbed that the pandemic is disappearing.
Trump did not cause the coronavirus. People would have died and the economy would have slumped regardless of what he did. His fault is that he has done everything possible to make it much worse than it needed to be.
That phrase (MAGA) makes much more sense now than in did 4 years ago. Let's make America like it was before Trump and that will be so much better!
Surprise.  More "sky-is-purple" Trump brown-nosery from Lindsey.  Trump did NOT endorse Roger Marshall.  In fact, he had to be talked out of backing his good buddy, KKKobach.  Beware of false idols, Lindsey.
I think it's safe to say that every single action taken by Trump, every INaction, and every word spoken at this point is all about November 3rd.  Look at the pattern.  "I need you to do me a favor, though."
Couldn‚Äôt tell if you were talking about Kanye or Trump!
Wow.  "I'm rubber, you're glue."  Incisive commentary.
That's all you got?  Nothing about Trump letting Putin get away with bounties on our soldiers?  Huh.  Strange.
this post has representatives of the entire left, trump supporters, closeted neocons, actual fascist provocateurs... incredible
I also think the Rs aren‚Äôt really trying to negotiate because they want to let Trump be the hero who takes care of people via executive order.
DEMs: Trump should have shut down the entire economy earlier. And he should have kept it shut down longer.  SAME DEMs: This bad economy is all Trump's fault.   Me: Pick one. You can't have them both.
This is the strangest description of a Trump critics I have ever read.
OK I‚Äôll let Trump have this one. But Yo-rup?! Who says that?
What trump appointee is in charge of the FDA? I don't trust the safety of a vaccine until Biden's people say it's safe.
you have to accept that this is  is the only reason Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein went separate ways. Big deal about human trafficking he did things for America right? How dare those victims try to seek justice.
Even if it's sometime shortly after the election, I'd want it tested well. I don't trust the safety if trump has been behind the development.
I feel like it was just last week Trump was a Nazi fascist killer for suggesting schools reopen  Now that Cuomo signaled reopening were totally on board?
The presidential debates are terrifying; the cards are stacked against Biden. He must NOT ONCE appear confused or have a verbal gaffe. Trump can continue to display his constant inability to comprehend words or speak coherently and that's just Trump?
According to Trump apologist, Thighland is the cosmopolite way to say Thailand n Trump is just such a sophisticate. Welcome to the United Schtates, conveves.
D'Souza's description of Trump's critics sounds like more like the resume of his supporters. And, unlike his ignorant   and unsupported jab,  I believe demographic research will uphold my statement.
Trump doesn‚Äôt know a thing about Jesus and it seems like most Evangelicals don‚Äôt either
I just downloaded the Tik-Tok app out of spite because I love doing anything to oppose Trump.
Trump said ‚Äúyou probably won‚Äôt see me for a while‚Äù prompting mass speculation
First I read this as ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù &amp; this was a prediction for a book written in the future by white supremacists praising him for all but wiping out black and brown Americans by withholding a vaccine for COVID.... then realized I misread it... then realized Trump might do that ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Okay. Two tweets. I‚Äôm a bad patient. The poll also shows Trump up 50-43 over Biden. And Trump only +3 on job approval in KS (48-45). All in the ballpark of the limited polling we‚Äôve seen so far this year in KS. We‚Äôll be a Trump state, but maybe not as strongly as 2016, I‚Äôd bet.
I‚Äôll ration myself 1 tweet: PPP shows KS senate at Marshall 43%-Bollier 42%. So no clear leader given the MOE. But again, Bollier has a tough slog to get undecideds who probably lean Trump for POTUS. Good to have another poll here. KS Senate is definitely worth watching.
Media: We know Biden sucks but TRUMP IS HITLER.
Not sure who's the brainiac behind Trump's strategy in this. I think West's presence pulls at least as much from Trump as Biden.
I can't wait until Trump says that 2+2 = 5.    Dinesh will somehow try to convince himself that it REALLY DOES equal 5.  And will, again, self-check, to our great delight.
The media will have a conniption when Trump is awful in the debates but starts closing the gap in the polls with Biden.
If the GOP had nominated somebody in 2012 to run against Obama who was 78, we would have NUMEROUS stories pointing out the risks of electing somebody this old. But since it's a DEM running against terrible Trump, we can't even have the discussion.
The lead story on  was Biden's dumb comment about Black Americans. They spent four minutes on it, including a montage of 15 years of Biden gaffes. "Nobody is watching Biden screwing up" (because of the pandemic). Has Trump ever not said dumb things every day?
You're an independent it seems now. If we could get even just 30% of people to vote their conscious and not by party lines we really could make some real changes towards the middle again.  Love Trump or hate him the reality is is he was driven from the Ds.
RINO'S for burning cities, high crime, riots, looting. Bankrupting the country with the Green New Deal and shipping good paying jobs overseas. We support high taxes, more regulation, high unemployment...
Finally sat down and watched that full AXIOS Trump interview. My brain turned to sludge. Trump is so fucking stupid.
Donald J Trump is your president get used to it!
Understandable. I hope for the best as well. Though frankly I‚Äôd for for a freakin ham sandwich over Trump.
No need to explain.  We know what Trump Derangement Syndrome symptoms look like.  If anybody had done this to Barack Hussein Obummer they would have been lambasted by the main stream media, hollywood, academia, and the libtards on social media for weeks as a racist.  #QAnon2020
Trump retweeted the N word. Which is kinda the same as reading someone else‚Äôs words out loud? Idk
I'll never vote Trump but Biden keeps trying to be funny and little bits of indecisiveness and lack of judgement are creeping in.  This is not the time to be stupid  We need you to step up not down.
You need to understand 1) flippant answers to media questions are Trumpish.  Be Presidential.  2) Quit playing games with VP choice. Should have been done.  We need a distinguished and decisive leader -- the anti-Trump.  Play games and you lose the middle.
I thought if no one was tested, no one would have it.  Why is Trump testing?
If you mean we are more fucked if Trump wins a second term, agree.  But this is Biden‚Äôs stutter.  It‚Äôs not new to anyone.
Wow, Biden is more powerful than God (in Trump‚Äôs head).  Amazing.
Trump is officially banning the awful TikTok app.   This is the Trump I voted for: BIG ACTION. BIG RESULTS.   Let's do Google next.
I dunno. Just seems appropriate for Trump supporters.
you‚Äôre right, 4 more years of trump is the best for america
Can we skip ahead to the pt when some art wunderkind creates pop-art screen prints of Trump's face in zany neon colors &amp; everyone laughs &amp; says can you believe that shit ever really happened then we drink fizzy red cocktails with Campari &amp; laugh so loud the neighbor dogs bark?
I‚Äôve reached out to God for a comment regarding Trump‚Äôs assertion about Biden and He gave it 5 Pinocchios.
Remind me who‚Äôs the president. Obama, Biden, or tRump?
Credit where credit appears to be due. This is a good thing. I hoped Trump wouldn't go an entire term without doing anything right.
It didn't dawn on me until now, but Trump is essentially Auric Goldfinger. Haha. He even looks like he's painted gold!
Wow, whoever Trump would pick would be getting a lot of money coming their way!
No, I do NOT want to launch personal attacks. I want trump supporters to stop supporting a probable child fuckers and rapists. That's what I want.
You're a trump supporter. Are you freaking kidding?
I'm not "attacking" you. I am SICK of hearing trump supporters go after Clinton for being an associate of Epstein's while completely ignoring trump was as well. The hypocrisy is absolutely gross.
The only reason you're bringing up the Clintons is to deflect from trump. All the child fuckers have got to be brought to justice. Period. I don't care what their last names are. Child rapists have to be punished.
You're gross. You'd really protect trump even if it was proven he's a pedophile. You'd just say "fake news."
Thighland‚Äôs Prime Minister has confirmed that Trump wanted dirt on Biden for official recognition from the US government.

The Washington Post: Opinions | If Biden wins, the post-Trump corruption purge will have to be epic
I‚Äôm hopeful, but it will only happen if Trump wins.
I wonder if that's true in this era (particularly under Trump). Ideally, I'd like it to be true. But corruption can be an asset for exerting influence. It allowed for things like this that might have increased the NRA's overall effectiveness:
Doesn't it indirectly affect Trump? There have been many reports that the NRA illegally funneled $40 million of Russian money into the 2106 Trump campaign.
Donald Trump is the SINGLE GREATEST THREAT to Americans and, in fact, world humanity.
Says you? Trump has been a failure at everything he's done! Do you listen to him speak, he doesn't know how, what has he done? Examples?
At least in NY, there was one recent precedent James mentioned: the Trump Foundation. üòú

This move at this time may have just gotten trump re elected.
Who is this message targeted toward? I can't figure it out. Is there some kind of organized election boycott I'm missing out on?
Has there even been a presidential campaign with so little focus on policy?  Trump doesn't have an agenda outside of "I'm great and let's make America great again. Again."  And Biden? Can ANYBODY articulate his policy priorities? Joe sure can't. It's basically "Obama Part 2".
Is everyone ready for the NY AG announcement to be the most anti-climactic event since Trump's Senate impeachment trial?
This is the end of the 2020 film. Scientist face Trump against himself causing a Trumpian loop, an infinite cycle of inanity that cannot be broken.   We are all saved.
Guiliani, in support of Trump, bashing Biden for his strange non-sequiturs and inability to utter coherent thoughts is the ultimate in irony, no?
I actually agree with Trump on this one. Move up the debates! Especially with the high number of people who will be voting early by mail.
Donald Trump only cares about his ego and making money, and if you cared about America you wouldn‚Äôt vote for him

How many prosecutors are after the whole tRump family?
Start with yourself, Trump. Please go away immediately.
OK, so how do you plan on making the case for a Trump Democrat against the Senate Majority leader?  Because the people of Kentucky DO NOT WANT McGrath and what she represents.  So "well, she's better than McConnell" isn't enough, whereas Booker was.  Run him as an independent?

Bullshit. Instead of listening to his own people and the intelligence agencies he listened to Jerad Kushner who said it was no big deal. trump's administration could have warned the leaders of our major international hubs what was coming. Medical supplies came too late.
Dude, we have a DIRECT model for this pandemic from 1918 and you all are trying to ignore that for that piece of sh*t trump. You‚Äôre SO embarrassing yourselves. Biggest self own of all time.
Trump negates all of Biden's worst tendencies.
That's what's fascinating about Trump v Biden. Most of the things that would normally make Biden unelectable still pale compared to what Trump does and says. So you just shrug them off now when Biden does them. The media sure ain't going to hold him accountable for these gaffes.
Every time you all try to shift the blame for the piss-poor GLOBAL pandemic response from trump to state and city politicians you just ensure we‚Äôll be coming out in droves to vote against trump. A pandemic demands federal response. Period. Even libertarians understand that.
You  had the chance to stop Trump. This is on you. Your legacy.
You are a fake person #trump
He's 77. He's not going to get a handle on his temper.  But this is part of what makes the Biden v Trump matchup interesting. The types of things that would normally make Biden unelectable like this pale compared to Trump's personality issues. Trump negates all of this from Joe.
America loves our Great President Trump.
Agreed. I voted third party as a protest vote in 2016 because Trump and Hillary are terrible people who should never be president. And Biden might still force me to do this again depending on how things play out. But as of today I lean towards voting Biden.
That was WAY cringey! Yikes!  He really should never be president, and yet I'm going to have to vote for him over Trump. Lord I hate these two parties for making me vote for Biden.
That's absurd (and I assume you don't mean this literally but it's still absurd). As a comparison she's less ambitious (or at least no more) than Ted Cruz. Would you make this same criticism if Trump had picked Cruz as his VP?
He‚Äôs awful and he‚Äôs still better than Trump. What a shit show.

Video from  of Trump's call to Marshall #ksleg
LATEST: Marshall takes call from Trump, who congratulates him on "incredible race" after declining to endorse in the primary; Kobach concedes and backs Marshall  #ksleg
I wonder if Trump endorsing Kobach would have helped.   Really, the only candidates running ads in my area were Roger Marshall and Kris Kobach.   Marshall took the MAGA approach by posting photos with Trump.   Water under the bridge now.
No secret that candidate - and candidate spouse - management is a big part of a campaign. Just ask the Trump campaign

Trump is the Turing test for parody.
It is amazing. He has obliterated all our theories about political communication b/c he overloads us with stupidity. We can't keep up. To quote Trump: "No one could have anticipated this."
Amazingly, despite decades of contrary evidence, Trump still thinks most people are dumber than him.
Mail in voting will clearly help Trump, we need to scrap the whole system and go in person with ID only. It's the only way to protect the system from his corruption!
Combining your twitter activities, maybe you should talk to the Trump people about makeup tips. Look at that incredible bronzer line during the Axios interview.
After the Garland nomination failed (older moderate didn't succeed) and Trump really emphasized youth in his overall judicial nominations, I think 56 is going to be too old for Biden to nominate a judge to SCOTUS.
If you ever wonder why "I didn't vote" beat Hillary and Trump in 2016, it's because people like you prop up garbage candidates and insist it is the only choice.  If you feed people bullshit and they refuse to eat it, stop feeding people bullshit.
I find it funny that you blame me and "people like me" for getting Trump and McConnell re-elected.  If you support an undemocratic political party that doesn't care if it loses or not, you're going to get loser candidates that lose.  That's on you, friend, not me.  Fix yourself
just imagine if every interview done with trump went like the axios one. i mean shit
And since I'm bitchin &amp; raging today: Jonathan Swan's colleagues, et al, are celebrating &amp; congratulating their admiration/envy of his Trump interview. THIS INTERVIEW METHOD/STYLE SHOULD BE THE *NORM*!

Your problem is you think the Democratic Party is trying to oppose Trump.  Once you clear yourself of that toxic delusion, legitimate criticism of an oligarchic political party makes sense.
Yes, because my tax dollars for the NAVY do not pay for them to express their political opinions on my dime. How outraged would you be if it was a Trump Mask being worn?

Watching the Axios HBO interview with Trump the graphs really stood out to me, so I screen grabbed them.  Unfortunately with no titles on the graphs we cannot evaluate his claims. However, it's comical that they happened to only print graphs that make the US look good.
Translation:  I am scared by how demented my preferred candidate sounds and how Trumplike he is. Therefore, I would rather he hide than actually engage Trump in a debate to "win votes" like a normal candidate would.  Seriously, you #BlueMAGA cult members....

My gut feeling for 2020.   Minnesota was winnable with a good economy. Putting into the D column for this reason.   Trump basically conceded NV. Solid blue.   Wisconsin is labeled blue by experts, I see it as a tossup.   16 possibilities for Biden. 5 for Trump.  23-35% Trump win.
This is like a SNL skit but I am so sad to know that it‚Äôs real and trump is just that dense and dumb.
Basically, if Trump wins the electoral college but Biden wins popular - Biden will call on his electorates in Wisconsin &amp; Michigan to go to the House. Regardless of the votes.  In their wargame, Biden wins traditionally or Biden will strongarm win.

Biden should never even sniff the White House (see what I did there?) but he's likely going to be POTUS because he's running against Trump, who is a truly awful person, a moron on policy, and a terrible, terrible president.  Deserve is a relative term. And I'm voting for Biden.

I think Trump has made a strategic error by lowering the bar so much for Biden, who basically just needs to show up and be semi-coherent to get over that bar.  I don't want either of these guys to be president. But I will indeed cringe and vote for Biden over Trump every day.

Are you kidding me with this?  Trump and his family are BARRED from running a NON-PROFIT in New York. His ex-attorney just left prison due to a campaign finance violation.  We ALL KNOW that barely scratches the surface, because they are witholding subpoenad docs.  But both sides?
When you have such contempt for the First Amendment, we're not going to be nice to you. Supporting trump is un-American and unpatriotic.

How about we throw all those tapes about Trump out there. Let's have those Pee Pee tapes....
DELETE YOUR FACEBOOK.
Do who have any evidence at all that anyone is going to vote for him? Who are the people that we assume are stupid enough to do this? Seems potential Trump supporters are more likely than Biden supporters.
Im not a trump supporter or anything but do you think Hillary wouldve done better?
Or Trump‚Äôs entire life, factually speaking.
She is as crazed as trump.

Have Republican senators like Cory Gardner been asked what they think about the Trump campaign and GOP operatives using someone obviously have a mental health crisis as a prop for  their benefit?   And reporting every word Kanye says only amplifies this. Please stop.
No Trump
Kansas City, MO. Awesome Midwest city. Just don't drive 30 minutes in any direction... or you're in Trump Country.
It Figures. I would not be surprised if Trump is behind this.
Trump thinks his depends is a mask.
For some strange reason, Donald Trump only started performing random acts of kindness once he'd decided to run for president. Anything from the 70s? The 80s? The 90s?
This from LIAR:  Harry Reid on Trump‚Äôs Mental State: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs Something Wrong‚Äò -- He‚Äôs ‚ÄòGetting Worse‚Äò.  Projection much?  was always a gaffe machine but now he can even complete a coherent thought.
Another Trump tragedy.
this godly version is an idolater and con man, brandishing a Bible after threatening to deploy the military to crack down on protesters. Several have accused Trump of exploiting religion for political benefit while holding little belief in religious tenets.
I'm guessing he's going to have the chance to "sue" the jail again as, if he's on probation, that's going to send him right back where he belongs. Calling Donald Trump ain't gonna save his a$$.
That is too abstract. You must look in detail, what vote moves you toward, or less far away, from your goal. Trump has moved further away from Progressive goals than Clinton would have. I.e. $2,000,000,000,000 less revenue for m4a. $26 trill. Debt harms future m4a support.
You really think so? Dude isn‚Äôt okay in the head. Neither is Trump of course... I don‚Äôt think competence is what Biden will bring personally... maybe his cabinet will at least be okay?
This is where we battle, it's just the odds are stacked us in some form or manner,Trump isn't quitting on us and I'm not on him
Our junior senator has gone full on Trump Jr. saying  campaign is failing coming off her massive primary win. Looks like  and  are intimidated.

Another Trump who will lie for his beliefs. How do you explain the death of my friend, Edgar?  Oh wait, he probably wasn't worth anything because he was not a rich, white guy.  FOOL.
One of the great days of my life as a political junkie and government educator.  I wish that Trump would follow his lead. I would gladly wave as he and Melania left in a helicopter off to FL or some other horrible location that welcomes criminals and defrocked presidents.
Enabling them to respond to the fallout of Covid 19 i's not bailing them out for their bad decisions. It's a remedy for the damage done by Trump, you and your Party.
Trump thinks (somehow) that it's HIS money. Like when he had his signature on those stimulus checks and the letters he had sent afterwards. Like we should THANK him for providing us OUR MONEY that we paid as taxes (something I'm pretty sure he doesn't do much of).
Donald Trump -- DONALD TRUMP (you know, the pathological liar with all the extramarital affairs) -- is questioning Joe Biden's faith.

Russia is denigrating Biden and we are supposed to believe that Trump has ‚Äúno ties‚Äù to Russia even if it‚Äôs just through his Family/Close advisors?
Why are we paying for this twice? Do you get a cut Pat? Does trump or his cronies?
You allowed this Pat. You voted to keep trump in office when you knew he was corrupt &amp; lying about Ukraine. You know Putin helped put him in office &amp; you are allowing it again. The USPS needs protection as does our election process. Do your job. Do you vote by mail? So does KS.
Oh wow, I didn‚Äôt think you knew about COVID. Do you know about the hell KS Republicans have given our Governor for trying to keep us safe?  You could have helped her keep our state safe by being a leader &amp; supporting what scientists were saying, instead of a trump ass kisser.
Have you not seen the 1999 video of trump saying he‚Äôs pro choice and thinks abortion should be allowed?
At least he has insight to his wrongs. Trump has no moral compass.
Let‚Äôs face it-he‚Äôs an old white man trying to lead a divided country. Joe is not my first choice but I believe he‚Äôs a better leader than Trump. And I‚Äôm excited to hear who our next VP will be. So many great choices who will help him navigate.
But you believe in trump lmao
I watched trump gas peaceful protestors for a photo op which is unconstitutional. He does not protect our rights as Americans. How can you support a dude who was sleeping w/ a pornstar while his wife had just given birth. The Christian way?

Why is trump allowed to cheat? It's not supposedro be a campaign rally.
Reminder that it took Trump until mid-March to declare the coronavirus a national emergency while most countries were acting in February. He‚Äôll rush to a social media app tho.
What I just gave you was literally Biden's stance from the primary. It's weird, because the "Biden wants to abolish charter schools" is a debunked claim made by Trump.
Negative, I saw the longer video.  So, you are implying trump is not racist - with his history &amp; recent remarks?  OMG, you lost all credibility.
UV on an inanimate object is vastly different in the science community than UV shot into the body as trump suggested. He also said disinfectant not just light.
Tell Facebook to stop allowing right-wing politicians to spread lies and misinformation!
Kobach &amp;the voter fraud task force that trump appointed found statistically insignificant irregularities. You don‚Äôt trust the Republicans to report the truth? How about the other investigations over time? Are you referencing what happened in the North Carolina Republican primary?
In 2012 93% of the African American vote went to Obama. In 2016, 91% of the African American vote went to Clinton. You don't see that w/ the Hispanic vote (66% Clinton 28% Trump) or the White vote.
Exactly. As someone who loves research it‚Äôs hilarious you also love trump. If you do your research on him you can find 1000 reasons why not to love him &amp; 20k+ lies that have been directly documented. But I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre lying about your ‚Äúdegrees‚Äù so not surprised there.
DeSantis will do anything and say anything to stay in Trump‚Äôs good graces and on his radar.

Okay so you have zero idea what you‚Äôre going to do after trump can‚Äôt be president anymore? Got it!
That‚Äôs all you have to do to beat Donnie lmao shut up and stay hidden and trump will do the leg work. People will vote for Biden just because he‚Äôs not trump.

Trump's idea of banning TikTok makes no goddamn sense. What's he gonna do, order Apple and Google to remove it from their app store? They'll just tell him to fuck off. Apple ignores the government all the time, like when the FBI asked them to create a backdoor to their phones.

Honestly most of the "liberal" media Trump decries actually helped him, having these "both sides" debates for every issue, as if both positions are innately reasonable. Like here's a panel of expert doctors, but let's also hear out some crazy who thinks masks are an evil plot.
Trump isn't going to (or attempt to) delay the election. But by suggesting the possibility he's now made other, only slightly less insidious measures, e.g. restricting mail-in voting, seem like a compromise. And as always the media will attempt to be "objective" and gobble it up.

Trump: Everything on tv is fake news  Swan: Police were kidnapping people.  Trump: No they haven't, don't you even watch TV?
You mean that thing that the Affordable Care Act, AKA 'ObamaCare' has covered for years that Trump is trying to get overturned at the Supreme Court? You pepopl ehave zero shame.

tRump doing the news conference from his ritzy golf club was such a ‚ÄúLet them eat cake‚Äù moment
Trump has done little or nothing for America. We are the laughing stock globally. He doesn‚Äôt believe in his Intelligence Community. He never asked Putin if he had payed Afghanistan Taliban fighters. Putin is helping him win the 2020 election!
So you‚Äôre telling me... When trump was like we need to get rid of Obamacare. He decuides let‚Äôs establish is with a different name
TRUMP 2020 and beyond
Trump is a virus
"Hot mic." üòÇüòÇüòÇ  Oh no! Trump got "caught" telling people the thing he says to everybody all day ever day. You sure got him this time, Jim!   Also: "Dear Diary..."
The mendacity of the gop knows no bounds.  They will lie about ANYTHING including laws signed by President Obama 10 years ago which now trump wants credit for - all while he's in front of SCOTUS trying to take coverage away from millions.
Joe Biden ain‚Äôt said or done anything that make me wanna vote for him it‚Äôs literally cause the other choice is trump bad built ass
That was one of the BIG LIES dems screamed at us; Trump won't cover pre-existing conditions.üòÇüòÇüòÇwhat morons!
A monkey with $440 million throwing darts at the newspaper stock listings would be worth $20 billion now.  Trump screwed around in real estate and pissed off $18 billion.  And he still owes $5 billion to the people he refused to pay, if he hadn't declared bankruptcy.
To Trump it‚Äôs just real estate!
Yeah, you must be one of those Trump-supporting idiots who don't understand that tariffs aren't imposed on other countries. They're imposed on our own citizens for importing goods. Tariffs hurt us more than them, ffs.
WATCH:  Who are the GOP operatives secretly undermining Trump's goals?  via
President Donald Trump laid out his plan for the executive order in a speech from Bedminster, New Jersey, Friday night. The order would address payroll taxes, unemployment benefits, student loans and eviction moratoriums.  #KAKEnews
Oh and delaying delivery of medications. Not that Trump would even consider or care about that.
Sorry I guess I just don‚Äôt understand how fertility issues and Supporting Trump have anything to do with each other in that situation but ok
Trump thinks he has carte blanche to just take matters in his own hands.  Congress?  Who needs Congress?
Trump is disgusting. He is the real fake news.
REPUBLICAN SENATORS NEED TO GET A HANDLE ON TRUMP NOW BEFORE YOU'RE TO LATE. HE'S KILLING YOUR PARTY!

REPUBLICAN SENATORS NEED TO GET A HANDLE ON TRUMP NOW BEFORE YOU'RE TO LATE. HE'S KILLING YOUR PARTY!
You are despicable for accepting fake informations from Russians on Biden. You apparently have no shame for siding with Ron Johnson and Russia to interfere in our elections to help Trump. You and Ron Johnson are a threat to our democracy. Resign now!
Did my first ever write-in vote in 2016.  Wouldn't EVER vote for HC but not a Trump fan. After voting, Hubby and I drove the countryside.  Turned on the TV just as it was starting to look like he might win. Mesmerized for hours as the results became obvious.
Trumps loyalty is with Putin, remember Helsinki, bounties on our troops from Russia. If you vote for Trump you're a traitor just like him!
I don‚Äôt want my kids to die,   CAP CLASS SIZES NOW.    #ableg #abpoli #abed
Trumps puppets Meadows and Mnuchin are just doing what Trump is telling them to do. That is not negotiating. He wants to do the payroll tax deal just for votes, it does not help the unemployed one iota and hurts Social Security big time. He wants to dictate just like buddy Putin!

Pres. Trump holds Friday evening briefing
Carole, how can you like all those things in your bio and put Trump with them when he has violated nearly all?
Or it could be because Trump is responsible for 160,000 American deaths.
Cheater, cheater, no one likes cheaters!  Criminal, criminal, no one likes criminals!  Trump, Trump, no on likes   Trumps!
I fight it every day. This virus and the antics of Trump will get to the strongest of people. Just a little while longer and he and his pals will be gone.
Well more than half of America voted for Trump too
Unless, of course, they're federal agents sent by President Trump!
Xi himself said he prefers trump because Dems care about ethics. trump gave China a win on Hong Kong, the Uighurs, WHO, and trade - not to mention shipping them tons of our PPE while deny the virus even existed here despite people dying.
Msm doing same as they did in 2016 - helping their buddy trump. Hopefully enough have wised up and will ignore the spin and false equivalency.
Nowhere in that report does it say those counties prefer VP Biden. News media lying to the public again to help their pal trump.
Well I can tell you one thing choosing between  trumps agenda and the left liberal wackos agenda... it‚Äôs not even a debate and besides personally I think Trump if they would‚Äôve given the guy half a chance from the day he got inaugurated he probably could‚Äôve done great things
Trump nailed the press conference..he took the gloves off
Well it‚Äôs obvious that the media is trying to sway public opinion toward Biden same as with social media trying to sway public opinion to Biden so if he‚Äôs going to cheat by God we should as well I hope every vote cast marks a checkmark for Trump
Trump worships the ground Putin walks on.  Oh,  and he is also scared to death of him.  If you doubt this,  go back and look at the pictures from the Helsinki meeting. They reveal a lot.
I‚Äôm sure he was fucking THRILLED to talk to Donald Trump...
Your inaction and dereliction of duty made this the TRUMP virus and thousands of lives dead because of YOU!
Joe, Donald Trump's too busy for that now..... in case you weren't aware, there's a v. important election goin' on #KAG #Trump2020 #RussiaHoax #WW3 üá∫üá∏
McConnell let crazy take the White House knowing full well they cheated and thinking he could control Trump.
Trump has all the right enemies.
That's literally the only explanation for  's complete flip flop from Trump basher to having his head so far up his ass he digests his food for him.
It‚Äôs because woke Tyler has ruined the show. I‚Äôm sure he controls the twitter feed as well. Used to love listening but the Trump is an idiot, and our governor is an idiot just gets exhausting. It‚Äôs basically Who‚Äôs Taller, Craig reading dead pool names and Dr. Meena and Mr. Skin.
I am guessing Trump thinks it‚Äôs a hoax and fake news.
It also smells too much like Trump trying to buy the election.
We pray for him, with the Lord on your side, NO one can stand against us ever. AMERICA We the people kneel to no one, but are lord, God are father in heaven! We pray for President Trump, Amen.
Yep, unless you're Manafort, flynn,stone,trump &amp; then you have benefited.
What in the hell does Trump have on you Lindsey? It has to be powerful bad. Trump isn't going down alone. Remember that.
Good for you do something for the American people and at the same time stick it in their ass!!! Trump 2020
That seems to be exact reason it's presented as it is, especially considering trump &amp; his campaign have already been trying to tie Biden to China. Interestingly Xi himself said he prefers trump as Dems care about ethics (&amp; trump has handed China wins on Hong Kong, WHO, &amp; trade).
Meanwhile Putin wants Trump to win again because he can literally place bounties on the heads of US soldiers and Trump will outright refuse to even address it.  And because Trump has said himself that he trusts Putin over his own intelligence community. Just a communist puppet.
Everyone who's dad is not just as guilty as Epstein raise your hand NOT SO FAST BABY TRUMP yeah I hate to be the one that has to tell you that you can't raise your hands but I'm sure you have enough going on right now with rhe whole your dad Fkn up America &amp; everything.
AND Trump‚Äôs penis can reach all the way to the back of your throat!
WH called a lid, meaning no new news for the day.  trump is golfing i believe
Relax, badass. I was being sarcastic about all the different scandals Trump is involved in. Unclench, breathe, carry on.
OOOOO internet tough girl. Is Trump still hiding in his bunker? Do you think your sidearm makes you scary?
Don't believe the bit about China for one minute. Ratcliffe is simply trying to hand ammo to trump to use against Biden. Xi has already said he prefers trump because Dems care about things like ethics &amp; trump is transactional (he's already handed China wins w/Hong Kong &amp; WHO).
Hmmm.  If China feels this way about Trump being reelected,  I wonder how our allies feel?  Seeing Trump as ‚Äòunpredictable,‚Äô China would prefer he not win reelection, intelligence official says By Shane Harris
Trump is proof you can't buy: Intelligence, self-awareness, class, compassion nor empathy.
No telling how much money Trump and his gang of crooks are stealing from the stimulus trillions. He's firing all the inspector generals so we don't have any watchdogs to keep them honest. Just like his Tax Returns that hide his crooked deals. ROTTEN AS IT GETS!!!!
donald j. trump is apparently the person who should decide where black people vote.  i‚Äôm waiting for fox news‚Äô outrage on this statement, but i‚Äôm afraid i‚Äôll die of old age before then.
Donald Trump is not the voice for Black voters. He's a white nationalist, he said it.
LYING Tweety Trump is not worthy of votes from anyone, anywhere, anyhow, anyway !!!
it seems as though all they think China is currently doing is being publicly critical of Trump‚Äôs policies - which surely they have the right to do.
Trump should have known better than to offer this advice given his personal experience.
I don't see how. Things weren't that good before Covid-19. But things have gotten considerably worse since then.  And that is largely because of the very poor way the Trump administration has managed this crisis.
I knew Newsweek was fake news... they were too chummy on Trump.
and please don‚Äôt say ‚Äúto defeat trump‚Äù
7 year old kid died in Georgia the day after Trump claimed kids were immune. Twitter and Facebook are right to remove literal fake news.

Men, does your wife have to stand behind you at stores and rub your back to keep you from yelling at the workers. Or did you not vote Trump?

Trump and his followers
but the reason i'm undecided is that i'm weighing the negative change with trump with the stagnation of biden; i'm not so sure i can take another four years of maga chuds. (2/2)
i'm a leftist who is undecided, but i'll tell you that i think most leftists (including myself) think that voting for biden will just elongate the politics that gave us trump, and that the moderate dnc platform won't really give us effective change. (1/2)
I‚Äôm with you - totally sucks.  The hardest thing to hear - and argue with - is ‚ÄòA vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump‚Äô.   Horrible but probably true -
No wonder Trump gets it from both parties!
Trump continues to flout social distancing guidelines even as he urges others to follow them
Funny the o lot dirt you can dig up on Biden is a cspan video from 1993. All you gotta do to see this kinda nonsense from Trump is to look at his twitter posts from yesterday. Stop comparing two pieces of shit, thinking one piece of shit is better than the other. It‚Äôs foolish.
It‚Äôs hilarious how people are more focused on the President and his mispronunciations of a word yet are silent about the fact that every single lie they‚Äôve spoken about Donald Trump and his motives is what Biden ACTUALLY is. This impending judgment is turning into a good tv show!
If the youth of today need a social platform to organize against trump, may I suggest the antiquated and morally irresponsible Facebook? I know, kids, it's a dinosaur used by other dinosaurs, but think of how you could shame your relatives when they post fake memes. #Facebook
This is true. trump blusters more than any Category 3 hurricane, so I guess that qualifies him as a force of nature.
I'm pretty sick of trump legislating and rigging the courts. He needs to stay in his lane.
has meghan mccain not seen how every republican candidate has painted themselves a trump loyalist?  until further notice, all republicans are pro-trump with a few exceptions.

Who do you think Trump is striving to be? I'm not trying to lead the free world. So its ok if he takes money from the military to build a wall he said we wouldnt pay for, call african countries shit holes and side with Dictators over Americans as long as he asks for forgivness?

See my comment. Trump did not know this and certainly did not pronounce it with a soft t. Pronouncing the t would be an affect or accent - not his crude rudimentary, illerterate style of speaking. Come on you are just trying to show off as some snobbish intellectual.

Trump is the biggest national security threat  has.
Well I am not part of Trump campaign I am just pointing out what creepy Joe is capable of doing and saying.  He does all of the racist remarks frequently knowing fake news media would have him a pass as always simply because he's a Democrat.
We really butchered this thread. Good luck, anyone trying to follow along.  I understand how important it is to vote trump out of office. I am just extremely frustrated that he is the best we could do. I hope he doesn't gaff his way into 4 more years of Trump.

I‚Äôm sickened. I‚Äôm a Democrat and Christian - raised Catholic. Trump is blasphemous.
Unpopular opinion: using references to the Antichrist against Trump is just as disingenuous and devoid of actual Christianity as the Trump church photo op.
Plus, if someone is actually a Christian and believes that Trump is "the Beast" they wouldn't be bothering with worrying about this election, as the Antichrist won't be beaten until Christ returns for the third and final time.

I used to lean right as an independent but after trump has exposed the corruption going on for first time I‚Äôm now a democrat.
As a life long republican before Trump, it amazes me that many Americans will vote for a man that is more loyal to the Russian president than our own intelligence agencies! Remember Helsinki and bounties on our troops in Afghanistan!!

Trump‚Äôs goal is to help people survive damages caused by covid, he thinks cities/institutions with $ shortages from before covid is a separate issue.
If the Trump vs Biden debate were a Pay-Per-View I would buy it in a second.

Just my own opinion I know. But I think we're screwed either way. Over 300 million people in America, and our choice is Donald Trump or Joe Biden? Yikes!!
I think he means as a practice, as happens in authoritarian countries and emerging democracies. trump is so incredibly criminal and corrupt tho that he breaks all norms.
Twitter temporarily bans Trump team from tweeting
But it's okay to gather in crowds of a few thousand people to protest I get it they want law abiding people to comply not the ones protesting and rioting  and looting they need the law abiding people out of the way. Don't know how long before we the people decide we had enough.

My sister, like you, skipped checking the top box in 2016. I rue that, but she followed her conscience, and to quote a phrase, "It is what it is." trump didn't ascend into the highest office because of unchecked boxes. He got there because of the Electoral College. Remember that.
Good morning. Fuck Trump.
Yes. I even think I would bring Mary Trump's book and read aloud certain passages. Hell, I could bring  a  wheelbarrow of all the tell-all books his former staff have written about him. No need to read it. Just wheel it down the line and let everybody see it. #LetsDoIt!

How dare he question Joe ‚Äú mass incarceration ‚Äú Biden‚Äôs mental health. Listen to JRE and you‚Äôll see Rogan is far from a trump supporter. One of the most important elections in my lifetime and they chose Biden, I question this also
We need a Lincoln ad where they show coffin after coffin then cut to the video of trump saying ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù then cut back to more endless streams of coffins while dark music plays in the background.
EVERY politician delegitimizes the elections... either during the process or after the result. Gore sued to win Florida. Hillary claims Russia stole the election. Hell Stacey Abraham‚Äôs still thinks she won üòÇ and you‚Äôre upset bc trump ASKED if the election should be postponed? ü§£
Praying in church what a scandel something trump has never done i think this ad actually helps Biden more than trump looks like it backfired.

While im not a clinton fan, Americans didnt choose Trump the first time.
Stop with the conspiracies and VOTE. Pelosi indeed may know something that ‚Äúcould‚Äù take down Trump, but she‚Äôs just a public servant dependent on a broken system that has repeatedly failed the country.
it's WRONG to have a trump supporter on to campaign and repeat attacks on VP Biden under the false guise of being just a random CEO. Allowing partisan lies with zero pushback helps spread disinfo and hurts our democracy.

Your bill was filled with special interest bullshit. It wasn‚Äôt serious, it shouldn‚Äôt be passed. If this bill is the same kind of turd, my hope is real legislators will vote it down, not likely, or Trump vetoes it. Write a clean bill focused solely on citizens,  just once.
He is establishing a defense of not being able to stand trial for when the shitz hits the fan after Trump yanks the covers off of him and his merry band of thieves.
What a Trump v Biden debate looks like.
TRUMP IS THE SWAMP!
My take... They are all a bunch of robots that are scared of Trump and can‚Äôt stand up for themselves or what they Believe in.
They know they can‚Äôt beat Trump in a legit head to head race. Watch for massive fraud.
Trump is worst than the swamp.
And you Mr Trump have left Our Country in shambles.

As a life long republican before Trump, it amazes me that many Americans will vote for a man that is more loyal to the Russian president than our own intelligence agencies! Remember Helsinki and bounties on our troops in Afghanistan!!

This bullshit brought to you by the network controlled by a close personal friend of trump, who made sure to help ratfuck our last presidential election to install the puppet.
Right. The Democrats still have 89 days to wrongly accuse Trump of at least 89 new false accusations through the judicial system, corrupt tv and print attacks, political ads, Twitter, on and on.  Isn‚Äôt going to stop what‚Äôs coming Nov 3.
It's disturbing that Rep's are capitalizing on Kanye's bipolar disorder to further Trump's chances. The man needs continual treatment. Hopefully he has people around him to help him with the process of getting healthy.

Trump: ‚ÄúYa know I thought that Adolph Rupp was a great guy, tremendous guy. My favorite NBA players? So many, how could you choose....Larry Bird was nice. Kyle Korver, obviously. Stockton, very supportive. Dirk Nowi-*checks notes* yeah that‚Äôs all. Stockton.‚Äù

In his warehouse! Insane! Trump buys a bunch with our money and then tells poor Navarro, ‚ÄúI want it sold‚Äù! Like he‚Äôs a CEO and Peter Navarro is a salesman.  ‚ÄúI want it sold now or heads are going to spin!‚Äù Sound familiar. OFFS!!!
And it worked to clearly show me we have an idiot running economic policy with Trump as well.
America deserves JUSTICE for every person involved in failed sabotage of Trump‚Äôs presidency. Prosecute every one of them; no matter their elected/appointed position right up to Obama, Obiden and Oclinton. America not settling for less than full Justice this time. Spread the word.

Suicides, drug overdoses and abuse do not politically affect Donald Trump therefore they are an acceptable trade off so lockdowns can continue over a disease that kills a tiny fraction of people.

Are you suggesting that Biden's administration be as corrupt as Trump's?
The President shouldn't be directing any sort of criminal investigations be done. It should be left to the DOJ. The President getting involved in the DOJ is one of the worst bits of corruption in the Trump administration.

The point I‚Äôm making is that anyone who votes for Biden surrenders all right to call Trump supporters racists and pedophiles when more proof of the same exists for Joe Biden
Sure, and I don‚Äôt think Trump‚Äôs a good human being either. I was discussing this with someone earlier, I‚Äôm just tired of being gaslit and called a racist for voting for Trump, knowing there is more proof that Biden is racist and I‚Äôm called racist by people who will vote for Biden

Oh really? Because I‚Äôve felt the same way about Trump for 4 years but still get dragged in the mud for even being conservative. By that standard, if you‚Äôre voting for Joe Biden, I don‚Äôt really give a shit about your opinion about my Trump vote. Put your money where your mouth is.
AXIOS on HBO: President Trump Exclusive Interview (Full Episode) | HBO  via  ü§°
Just like Trump.
As President Trump should have.  Obama will be remember historically as one of the most corrupt administrations ever!
I'm in Kansas and everyone I know received theirs within a few weeks. The only hold up was Trump's signature.
YESTERDAY president #Trump was slamming his fist on the table saying how voting by mail üó≥ (absentee) is full of fraudulent activity. NOW. ONE DAY later. He tweets (of course) that FL has secure and safe voting processes and everyone should vote by mail. üßêüßêüßê
My biology teacher was the goofiest one of the bunch ü§™ she straight up said that trump needed to build the wall to keep all the Mexicans from ‚Äúinvading‚Äù Texas, I just LOVE lab days
Close your eyes and imagine Trump delivering a eulogy for anyone. No one in there right mind would ask Trump to deliver a eulogy. He‚Äôd lie, ramble and complain that he was the one  people should have sympathy for. ‚Äú If only the departed had tried bleach, they‚Äôd be alive today‚Äù
people are telling me im crazy for siding with Obama now, like I can't change my opinions. Can a person who voted for Trump in 2016 vote for Biden this time around?
Kanye never stopped supporting Trump. He is a Republican Trojan horse. Vote for Biden if you want to defeat Trump in November.
And all Trump does is pander to blacks, hispanics, &amp; asians. White people need jobs too! Sad!
Ridiculous statement. The Swamp, which Donald Trump had damn near defeated, has come back disguised as the Revolution. Nothing you see on your tv or Facebook, is the whole truth. For the love of America, educate yourself!
Some will be for sale, the ones who can pay will be oil billionaires, Russian oligarchs, and Daesh.  Perhaps also Duterte and some emerging cartel types. Trump may even buy some to pass around to his tyrant friends or Ivanka.
Wowwww! Just wow watching this #AxiosOnHBO Trump interview.  I want to quote shocking parts in this tweet, but I can‚Äôt pick one.. there‚Äôs just too many. üòü What the actual fudge?
No yelling in the day room Mr. Trump.  And put on your mask.
A completely garbled, incoherent Biden elicits no response; Trump mispronounces one word and it's a front page headline! WTF! Donald Trump mispronounces 'Yosemite' at White House event  via
Sadly, the Republican nominee is a Trump sycophant, too.  Our only hope is to defeat Marshall in the general.
I‚Äôd like to see a powerful ad where you show multitude of caskets then jump to trump where he says ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù something along those lines.
Sadly, Marshall is a Trump sycophant, too.  I just hope Barbara Bollier, Democrat, can defeat Marshall in the general.  Fingers crossed.
And now  has to convince me to vote for him. The ballot says vote for one or fewer. Trump didn‚Äôt convince me in 2016, and hasn‚Äôt this year either. I‚Äôm not afraid of ‚Äúor fewer‚Äù...because my trust is not in these men. And I don‚Äôt fear the left. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
There is TREMENDOUS Lawlessness in America‚Äôs White House. It will be easy to stop in November by voting Trump out of office.
Trump sues Nevada to stop mail-in voting. Where‚Äôs his standing?  Where‚Äôs the standing of the state or national Republican Party?  It would seem to me only a voter in NV has standing. (Haven‚Äôt seen petition).
Trump sues Nevada to stop mail-in voting. Where‚Äôs his standing?  Where‚Äôs the standing of the state or national Republican Party?  It would seem to me only a voter in NV has standing. (Haven‚Äôt seen petition).
‚ÄúDing a ling Kelly‚Äù???  Gov Kelly has kept Kansas on a science, instead of political track.   If everyone had listened to Gov. Kelly, instead of trump, kansas would be even better off.    Marshall is nothing but a ‚ÄúTrump puppet‚Äù.
And Trump still has kids in cages??!!??!!??.
Make fun of Donald Trump, that'll get instant engagement
Well, either way, the gals in my fan group are primarily Trump supporters, and many of them are not voting this year.  Many are elderly and don't want to hit the in-person polls, and now they do not trust any ballot going through mail no matter what it's called.
I cannot believe this is who the Democratic Party chose as their nominee. These people are psychopaths and if you really vote for Biden instead of Trump you should be checked mentally too.
It truly blows my mind that some people can sit there and slander Obama but then act like Trump is a saint üòÇ
This is your daily reminder that disliking Trump and what he does, doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt also disagree with other presidents. He‚Äôs just the one currently in office and we can‚Äôt change the past.
Well, if Trump doesn't want people to vote by mail and he's not willing to make a push to make sure that polling places stay open or that more of them open, then he's doing nothing but suppressing the vote.
So TX has the same system as FL.  So does the majority of swing states.   So I'm sure that that would be ok in those swing states now since Trump has approved the way they vote in FL.  Only makes sense right?
Actually the impeachment process impeached the impeachment by not finding trump guilty ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Barry told russia he‚Äôd have more ‚Äúflexibility‚Äù after the election, he sacrificed Crimea to Russian agression, his head of state sold russia uranium, etc.
What concerns me is that there is not real evidence of voter fraud and Trump is trying to act like there is because he's losing.   If FL has an "ok system" for mail-in voting and their system is run the SAME WAY as other states that should tell you something.
I suggest Trump debate Tony Shilue as Tony does his Biden impersonation
Florida, for example, apparently they are ok for mail-in ballots now per trump - but the same states he says will cheat do their mail in voting the exact same way.
They are getting desperate because they know trump is gonna lose need to round up the evangelical vote.
I have a bunch of Christian followers who are writing to me telling me they are leaving their churches because their pastor is talking about TRUMP and not GOD.   Trump is a false idol. #maga #christians #god #trump2020
Trump is Kim tested, Kim approved.
Trump is going on TV to promote himself while I will be volunteering with Habitat for Humanity. Wonder when the last time Our president volunteered without the press there to witness it so he could increase his ‚Äúratings.‚Äù Why can‚Äôt People see how selfish and self promoting he is?
Yeah, he is very funny. SMH
I have to ask, if you think Trump is the best ever. Who do you think is the worst?
Cause Trump is nothing but love?
Watch the full "Axios on HBO" interview with President Trump - Axios
Donald Trump flounders in interview over US Covid-19 death toll | Donald Trump | The Guardian
Chairman Treasonous trump is delusional and a pathological liar
Exactly, trump acts like this is a nation of republicans and we democrats are second hand citizens with lesser rights.
Y'all need to report it as what it is - his attempt to copy Putin. Every oligarch must get permission from Putin to do bus else they end up in prison or on the run &amp; Putin always gets his cut. NYTimes tried to frame this as tRUmp being a 'CEO' when it's him being an authoritarian
Rule of law or trump!
if you vote for trump you‚Äôre going to hell periodtttttt üî•üî•üî•
In the real world #TraitortRUmp has been sitting his obese lardass on appropriated funds, refusing to release them for almost a year. Also he deports victims.
In the real world, victims are denied visas and are deported by #KremlinBarbie's monstrous father.
Ask her about 'tRUmp escorts.' Or about the Eastern European girls her daddy trafficked thru his 'modeling' agency (business model of which Epstein copied). Btw tRUmp cut funding for pursuing trafficking cases &amp; deported victims.
#NepotismBarbie's daddy cut funding &amp; investgation of trafficking cases, deported victims including those needed as witnesses to prosecute cases. Her family's $$ was made via human trafficking. She owns trademarks for 'tRUmp escorts' in China.
Dems won‚Äôt condem Antifa because they are using those thugs for their own political purposes, mainly to create chaos so they can blame Trump. Antifa is the Dems‚Äô goon squad.
Fuck Donald trump and fuck ice
Can a reporter check on Jeff sessions? He threw his career away too on trump and maybe the pair can do a vaudeville act together. Wear red hats, canes, tap shoes‚Äîyou know, something real nice.
Trump was at Jon Lewis's funeral in spirit.. Obama made sure of that..
We also have the most deaths and hospitalizations per capita from Covid-19 in the world.  Trump is an abject failure at protecting America and his mixed messaging is responsible for countless deaths.
Kobach is such a crappy candidate.. I knew he would lose..(i voted for him and took 3 first time voters with me, didn't matter) He is cold, Arrogant and doesn't connect with people.. Every vote he got today and 2 years ago, was only because Trump asked us to..
Our Dem candidate will kick Marshall‚Äôs ass in November!! Chairman Treasonous trump didn‚Äôt even bother to endorse anyone in this primary. üòÇ
We had a fantastic turnout in Kansas for the Democrat US Senate primary! If she win in November it will be HISTORIC! Chairman Treasonous trump didn‚Äôt even bother to endorse a Republican here. üòÇ He‚Äôs such a dick! And BTW...
hiring and abusing undocumented workers plus created a 'modeling agency' known for trafficking Eastern European girls.Then show them an ad for 'tRUmp escorts.' Their chosen one isn't who they think. 2/2
Anyone dealing with a qcult family member, let them know tRUmp's family fortune was built on human trafficking via his granddad &amp; he carried on the family tradition by 1/2
On his last day in office #Trump is gonna pardon the Silk Road guy and say "Love the site!"
We have legislation. Truth is under trump DOJ has STOPPED pursuing cases, trump cut funding, and has deported not only victims but victims needed as witnesses to help prosecute a case.
is being endorsed by the American Postal Workers Union of Massachusetts.  With all we‚Äôve seen regarding Trump‚Äôs contempt for the post office and attempts to defund it, it speaks volumes that those postal workers think Ed will speak for them.
It'd be nice if in a story like this they mention things like fact trafficking help and prosecutions have gone down under trump because he took funding away &amp; he's made it much more difficult for non-US victims to even get help. 1/2
Lol  tell that to the 60% of Kansans Indp#ependents that disapprove of Trump, while you‚Äôve demonstrated you‚Äôll just be his rubber stamp. üòÇ

Wichita also elected a Democratic mayor.  Farmers have suffered tremendously under trump trade fiascos.  I have hope.
"[Bipartisan, employer, and worker union] Opinions at the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing stood in sharp contrast to those of President Donald J. Trump, who has tried to defund and eliminate the CSB three times."
So glad that  won! He is a conservative and a Trump supporter. Now on to the General!
I think this is a mistake. 66% of Kansas Independents disapprove of Trump. Marshall spent the entire Primary talking about how he would be a better ally of Trump. Bollier polls ONE point under Marshall in the same poll she polled ONE point over Kobach. Kansas has closed primaries
You assumed that the black bear was voting for Biden? I'm sure the bear is on some Democrats voter roll anyway! Good üêª voting for Trump!!!!
He had already given his acceptance speech and thank everyone appropriately. Then Trump called.
He'll be Trump's lawyer. Not kidding.
Reminder - Kansas has 'closed' primaries. You can affiliate at the poll, if you're unaffiliated. But don't let some of these totals make it look like Moderates and Dems are outnumbered. Independents in Kansas disapprove of Trump 66% to 33%. They'll be voting in November.
Oh those 6 poor people protesting on the corner have to pack up and go home.. darn..buh bye! Watch Kansas go blue in November! Hey Trump Kris needs a roommate.
The SWAMP rats win again!  Sad day for Kansas &amp; sad day for   You should have backed   He was a warrior for you. Marshall is just a pawn for the Trump haters in the Senate.
More would have died if not for President Trump. Dems wanted partying in the streets.
Bunker baby Trump couldn't build his wall on the border, but he did build numerous walls to surround the people's house in Washington DC.  It will be a great relief to watch his walls get torn down on Jan 21. 2021.
Biden will never debate Trump. OR you if he does it will be a video feed from his basement w people to feed him answers. Anyone that thinks Biden won‚Äôt have all the questions provided to him by the Democratic Party is nuts.  Remember Hillary &amp; Donna Brazile?
White supremacists murder Americans by the scores and you're still worried about graffiti artists and ppl that throw milkshakes.  You're priorities are farked up dude.  White supremacists still remain the biggest internal terrorist threat to America according to Trump's own FBI.
Thank you. News media execs think we normal folk don't notice how much they help trump by repeating his lies, platforming his disinfo, and normalizing him, but we do and are sick of it. Thank you for speaking out.
She's quitting because even the so-called left-wing media helps promote and normalize trump by platforming his disinfo, not because 'cancel culture' as your ridiculous article in the RU propaganda friendly  implies.
‚ÄúMy husband has Alzheimer‚Äôs, so I‚Äôm out campaigning for him, but can you believe that Trump is trying to fundamentally change all of Joe‚Äôs screw ups he made with B.O.?  Isn‚Äôt that craziest thing you‚Äôve ever heard???‚Äù
‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù ‚Äì President Trump defends coronavirus response
No, it doesn't. No one cares. Trump let McConnel put ads in KS against Kobach! He is a true, hard core conservative!
Well gee Elizabeth the laws and rules of voting apply to u regardless If you‚Äôre a trump supporter. But go ahead and play victim like all of his other pathetic followers
...well, that's not going to get him the vote of anyone that is sick of Trump and thought Marshall would be a good alt to Kobach because he wouldn't be a Trump sycophant. lol
Bullshit!!! NYC has been run by a Bafoon!! Trump will always have my vote but I'm sure going to be pissed if he bails out any poorly run city!!!
Trump says massive explosion in Beirut was likely an ‚Äòattack‚Äô
I blame Trump.
Not sure that applies to whoever's running the organization and so gets to set work conditions. You'd think something could be done but trump's administration is so corrupt they're doing things no one ever thought we'd need laws against.
Trump doesn‚Äôt care about anything but trump.
Trump has admitted it‚Äôs ok if Russia supports things in Afghanistan against American troops since we supported mujahideen against the soviets in the 80‚Äôs.
You know the expression  ‚ÄòKeep your enemies close.‚Äô  The minute Trump dumps either, he or she will be on every Liberal tv station talking trash about President Trump. Keeping them is strategy.
Sometimes you are entirely too diplomatic. Trump is the most imbecilic Potus in history.
He is.  He‚Äôs awesome and honest.  Something you don‚Äôt see in the swamp.  I hope he gets an awesome job in the Trump administration.
The Trump Administration is selling off the Arctic Refuge, threatening Indigenous Peoples, wildlife and America‚Äôs last great wilderness. Help stop them!
She said something correct for once -- noone  but Trump could muck up a pandemic, fail to lead, fail to follow the science, and defect and misconstrue the data and facts like Trump has.
üé∂ Que sera, sera üéµ whatever will be, will be üé∂ ‚Äî Donald Trump re Covid deaths under his watch.
Drove through Winfield for the first time in months and almost puked watching middle aged white women dance around with trump signs
Of course, Trump statement is the exact opposite of what I am reading.    I heard they were storing the explosive material in a warehouse, some fireworks caught fire, spread and ignited the explosive material.  I do NOT KNOW if this is true, but what I have read.
I don‚Äôt like Trump all that much, but I‚Äôm a pragmatist. He is a rolling turd ball, but so too are many of the Democrats.   I‚Äôll take some dumb tweets and moronic interviews all day long to protect policy from these Democrats.   #Antifa #Trump2020
Trump is going to kill us all!!
You remind me of a saying my Father always said....  "The easiest job in the world is that of a critic"      Biden tells Trump to 'do your job' as coronavirus fails to 'just disappear' | Coronavirus outbreak | The Guardian
I want to remove any possible circumstance (undelivered ballot, signature doesn't match enough, insufficient postage, etc.) that could prevent me from voting against Trump. I would move mountains to vote against him and it is going to be counted.
Wow! that is all I have got to say!!!! #TrumpHasNoPlan
Trump was tougher in this interview on John Lewis than he was Ghislaine Maxwell...take a second and really think about what that says about him as a human being.
Do you have anything better to do then stalk Trump page all day..
#Save the country...vote Trump!
There has been an insurrection going on in Portland for over a year. It has nothing to do with poor management.  Ted Wheeler has done a great job of destroying a city.  The main goal of the Radical Left is to kill Trump and destroy the country.  The Rad left will be the dead left
Did you just use a quote from someone else to call Trump racist? Like, is that really a stunt you just tried to pull?
Are you voting for Biden Who isn‚Äôt really there or are you just fighting against Trump? If the latter you are missing the point. Love America, FREEDOM and Liberty.
Who exactly are you fighting for?  Joe-Joe is almost brain dead. Get him to the debate stage and let‚Äôs see what his policies will be. He won‚Äôt be able to remember them. Hate Trump, but love America.
So what exactly makes Donald Trump racist? It gets said an awful lot, but never proven. On the other hand, it‚Äôs awfully easy to find clips of Biden saying the n-word on the congressional floor and of him pigeonholing black voters with his ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù statement
Am I the only one who just heard Trump say in his presser that the explosion in Beirut was a bombing? What a reckless thing to say. It was a result a very large amount ammonium nitrate that had been stored there for over 6 years.
This has been tRump from the beginning
Trump supporters are afraid to speak up because of the mob. There is a silent majority
USPS is just another among countless examples where Trump puts a wealthy doner in charge,  who,  by the way,  knows virtually nothing about the organization he is in charge of.  No wonder our government departments and agencies are so bad.  They have bad, clueless leaders.
That‚Äôs not the message you conveyed with your first reply at all. The tweet and article were about conservatism, not Donald Trump, and you failed the test. Don‚Äôt go back now

My mom just asked me to show her how to vote for trump.. LOL HAHAH excuse me??????

This is probably one of the most important elections in our lifetime!As team the two of you will ensure that trump goes home &amp; Joe Biden will be our next President of the United States! Republicans will thank us later as it costs millions for him to play golf weekly in Florida.
Trump‚Äôs demand for US cut of a TikTok deal is unprecedented
You're right, of course, but it's his utter indifference to John Lewis's value as a human being except as measured by whether Lewis attended Trump's inauguration and SOTU addresses that is galling as well.
Typical blame someone else for your problems.... This person was stating ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about the racist comments by President Trump, come on out to Chinatown and mingle..‚Äù like another split hair did in San Francisco... Just plain dumb.
Trump tweeted out that vote by mail is ok for Florida now.
Yeah, get them out before the first debate!  losers, Well it seems that everything you said President Trump was doing is actually what your scandalous azz was doing.. Like not accepting the outcome of an election. Paying Russian informants for falsified documents. #GoTheFAwayHag
More people are catching on with each passing day. #NarcissisticSociopath
Most Dems have been in Congress for 40+ years and you blame President Trump.?!? They love useful idiots.
trump killling y‚Äôall kids and y‚Äôall just letting him smh ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I notice Trump sort of pooped out on a response to that.  Guess he had a flash of lucidity.
You know damn well Trump is on those logs.
Trump!
Poll: 31 percent trust Trump on coronavirus.  Coincidentally, that also represents the number of dumbasses in this country.
"New York prosecutor seeking Trump‚Äôs taxes cites ‚Äòprotracted criminal conduct‚Äô at the Trump Organization"
Shame on Trump Shame on every Trump enabler Shame on every GOP Senator Shame on Barr, Pence, Pompeo, etc.  Shame on every member of the Trump Crime Family.  None of you will ever raise the the level of integrity and national worth of John Lewis.
Just a question to all trolls with no life waiting to post at every Trump tweet. Do you actually think you‚Äôre going to change any of our minds about voting for Trump? Nope, you won‚Äôt! #Trump2020 #WalkAway ASAP!
Good grief, 160K covid deaths and Trump's reply:  "it is what it is"  Trump is going to lose on 11/3/2020 -- ""it is what it is".
Trump now wants a cut of Tiktok deal ‚Äî thats a good deal- also should get a cut of all  ofTrumps businesses.
Nope.  Trump has no heart or soul.
Trump is obviously at peace with the notion of 200,000 American CV19 deaths.
"Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the President." Theodore Roosevelt, 26th President that created the park system. Have Republicans sold there soul to Trump?
Trump can‚Äôt pronounce Yosemite. However, he doesn‚Äôt have a problem with Death Valley! 160,000 American deaths from CV19. Don‚Äôt let him distract you!
"Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the President." Theodore Roosevelt, 26th President. Have Republicans sold there soul to Trump?
Trump‚Äôs performance during the Axios interview was the only cognitive test necessary to judge his ability to lead. He is unable.

Giving a child life is not the same as being a parent.
He did. He literally said he was mad she didn't want to have kids right when he wanted them.
How is it Trump didn‚Äôt remember meeting Stormy Daniels, or paying her hush money? He claims he doesn‚Äôt remember Lev Parnas, even though Lev has about  20 pictures with Trump at multiple events.However, he clearly remembers Ghislaine Maxwell and wishes her well. Seems very odd.
Halfway point as an election worker and everyone has worn masks. Yes, several were worn below the nose. One woman had it covering most of her eyes. And one wrote ‚ÄúTrump 2020‚Äù on hers (which is not electioneering because he isn‚Äôt on today‚Äôs ballot) #govote

It won‚Äôt matter trump Joe is going to beat you like a rented mule 11/3/20..
Remember just a couple weeks ago when Trump sent ‚Äúwell wishes‚Äù to Maxwell and now out of the blue decides to give aid to trafficking survivors? He‚Äôs been on the island, he‚Äôs had multiple accusations of rape, many photo ops with Epstein and Maxwell. Stop with Bill and wake tf up.
"I know. Mommy's friend likes Donald Trump...." And I'm sure she had more to say, but the laughter that ensued drowned it out. ü§£
Gaffes happen? Once is a slip. For Trump its just normal parts of his speechs. Like when he said this is one of the wettest hurricanes ever  from the stand point of water,  when he met with Tim Apple, or when he called Paradise CA. Pleasure CA.
Hey Karen stop being a Karen. What do you expect him to do exactly? Thoughts and Prays? Yeah 51 minutes ago and all you can think about is bashing President Trump.
You‚Äôre delusional! Trump is guilty of ignoring the Coronavirus &amp; didn‚Äôt &amp; doesn‚Äôt choose to see what is happening because it will keep him from winning the election. Coronavirus is a National event  &amp; a global event. He is the Leader of the Free world but.... he‚Äôs NOT!
Since when you were interested in mentioned jobs rates killary? You were the same person complaining president Trump didn't do anything to bring unemployment rate down because it was all your beloved party Democrats.  Why are you blaming him of jobless rates now? Ha
Trump can‚Äôt pronounce Yosemite. However, he doesn‚Äôt have a problem with Death Valley! 160,000 American deaths from CV19. Don‚Äôt let him distract you!
Trump wants your school to open with in person learning. Baron Trump school has online only instruction until Oct. What‚Äôs good enough for the President‚Äôs children should be good enough for my children. Stop politicizing  grade schools.
Get over that phrase. It‚Äôs not going to happen. Changes need to be made to the Police but we need the Police. You like saying that &amp; saying horrible things about Democrats! I grew up Republican but Trump made me jump ship! Many from Fox also helped in that decision.
how you gonna support trump but vacation in mexico?
How is it Trump didn‚Äôt remember meeting Stormy Daniels, or paying her hush money? He claims he doesn‚Äôt remember Lev Parnas, even though Lev has about  20 pictures with Trump at multiple events.However, he clearly remembers Ghislaine Maxwell and wishes her well. Seems very odd.
Also because Trump said so.
Instead of spinning your way through the pandemic with charts you don‚Äôt really understand just get a national strategy in place and minimize the deaths and that would get you a better shot at re-election but trump doesn‚Äôt understand that just keeps deflecting and gaslighting.
Yes.  He knew what he was doing.  He had all the resources in the world and chose to put those people infected with non Covid.  I think purposely to blame Trump.  So he must pay.

What the right wing STILL doesn't understand is SCOTUS is NOT supposed to rule on conservative or liberal ideology, but on the Constitution. And Pence is forgetting that had Roberts acted like a judge instead of an outside observer in impeachment, Trump would no longer be Pres.
But the president has established guidelines, funding, policies, etc. even if governors wanted to do more they can‚Äôt because they‚Äôre limited by their federal government. Finally, by what you‚Äôre saying, Trump has sat back this entire time and done nothing?
I wish Trump had accomplishments he could use to get people to elect him but there‚Äôs nothing he really accomplished. Instead you have to try to lie about Biden to make him look crazier than Trump.
That is not stuttering. That is he can't complete a basic train of thought. You want your POTUS, who can't think???? Nice one, on "Yo Semite". Trump mispronounced one word of the millions he speaks. Let me know when the next one comes along. I will wait, but expecting crickets.

This is why I blocked Trump on here. Anyone who has been paying attention knows exactly who he is. They knew before he even became president. He's a white supremacist who has been given the highest office to operate out of. I don't need to drive myself crazy to understand that.
In previous election cycles this would have been clear, but somewhere in the midst of COVID-19, the desire to beat Donald Trump, all other candidates dropping out, and an online DNC, several fellow delegates, and some people higher in the party as well, have forgotten that. (3/6)

Lets be real, trump is counting on changing just enough votes to squeeze out a win, just like he did in 2016. We all know votes were changed in key states and it will happen again.  Vote by mail, but do not mail your ballot. Instead hand deliver to election office.

Gonna be extra hard to blame this on Trump. They will try, however.
Donald Trump and I are very different in many ways - like I didn't have to cheat to get into college - but one way we are alike, neither of us is a billionaire.
This is comment is un intelligent and weak.  It could literally be said about anything Trump does that does not involve COVID.  C‚Äômon. Do better ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüá∫üá∏
Saw your tweet but not the preceding ones. Had to look to see if you meant Kanye or Trump.
I think key will be the 6% of Orman voters in 2018 Gov. Couldnt stomach Kobach and couldn‚Äôt vote for a Dem. will 2 more years of trump mania plus a more ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù Dem candidate push them to Bollier w/o a 3rd party candidate?
To make it simple..... list his accomplishments in regards to serving justice for Trump...... I‚Äôm waiting
replacing red trump with a blue trump seriously risks ensuring we end up with something *worse* than trump in 2024.  Four years of no meaningful progress and president biden insulting people the way he does will erase the memory of Trump enough for R's to refurbish themselves.
I think people are looking too much into the fact that Marshall isn‚Äôt Kobach but overlooking that fact that Bollier isn‚Äôt Kelly. B is a former JoCo GOP. Kelly is a Topeka Dem forever. Some of those Trump-Kelly voters may see similar choice with different dynamics.
It is difficult to debate silly putty. The man can‚Äôt answer a question or stay on topic. tRump‚Äôs responses are nothing but nonsense &amp; attacks. That‚Äôs not a debate. I would also suggest that debates are not going to change anybody‚Äôs mind. I don‚Äôt know why we plan to have them.
160,000+ people are dead because of the incompetence of this WH and tRump betrayed our troops. He colluded with Russia and goes golfing every weekend. If jobs have been added it‚Äôs in spite of him not because of him.
Trump will never take action to control the virus.  In the first place, he is incompetent and doesn‚Äôt know what to do. In the second place, taking action now would be an admission that he was wrong to ignore it and call it a hoax six months ago.
Uneducated trump base trying to rewrite history.
Not sure whether you are joking but I think it's actually a good point. Trump depends largely on low-intellect people who believe that what they see on TV is real.
The trump campaign ALSO thinks that chldrn don‚Äôt die from Covid; doesnt know the difference between England and B.C;thinks Finland is part of Russia and that Venezuela is part of the United States &amp;he does not ( can not ???) read! Are the debates even needed?
The problem is these headlines say ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù or ‚Äútrump charity‚Äù without actually mentioning what the charity was supposedly for. ‚ÄúKids with cancer‚Äù really gets one‚Äôs attention.
Trump campaign has nothing real on Biden so they have to make it up:
Why? Marshall is in that spot where he was trump skeptical before run (2016 Kasich guy) so couldn‚Äôt get the endorsement so had to be Trumpy during primary in a state wear growing area is more moderate (JoCo). He‚Äôs favorite but not surprising (see McSally 2018)
I believe most determined ppl would wait for 8 days to get Trump out.
Trump wings it as he goes along. No structured plan since he stole the WH

Did not see this in US news. Apparently, it does not fit the narrative of Trump encouraging Russian interference.
Your daily reminder the president enlisted Rudy Giuliani and others to extort political favors from a foreign government to interfere in our election. Trump broke his oath. He is a traitor to the United States as is everyone that gives him a pass. Retribution is coming in Nov.

Not true and it‚Äôs called the Trump Virus. Get it right, Spanky.
You mean the Trump Virus
You daily reminder that our president enlisted Rudy Giuliani, Mike Pompeo and others to extort a foreign government into starting political investigations in order to influence the election in his favor. Trump is a traitor as are all those who support him.
They need to keep Joe Biden off the air till November... no ones voting for him anyway, just let trump lose it on his own.

Trump was a NY real estate developer for decades. He is used to being hated like this. Dude has a really thick hide.
Yeah it does, because Trump is the Republican party. These others are RINO's! Like your dad.
And yet... go far enough right, and this is just political, like how NY shut down Trump U and the Trump Foundation.  I guess they want to be scammed?
If Donald Trump is correct and Joe Biden can hurt God, maybe I should start saying "Bidendamnit."
Facebook removes troll farm posing as African-American support for Donald Trump
Trump is a Great PRESIDENT and keeps his promises. .  It just sounds this way to you.
The ‚ÄúBiden is against God‚Äù strategy will be the thing that does trump in, because NOBODY believes that and EVERYBODY can see the desperation.
Where there is smoke there will be fire.  #45 just digging a deeper hole for himself.   So pathetic.  Trump Signs Executive Order That Will Effectively Ban Use Of TikTok In the U.S.
There is no way in hell that Hilary is anywhere close to this ticket. People's disdain for her is what got Trump elected. Had the dems gotten rid of their super delegates retarded rules, Bernie is our current president. They gave Trump the victory because she is despised by all.
I like to imagine someone from the Trump team called him and put him up to this as part of the price of that pardon.

Just because he said yeah yeah doesn‚Äôt mean he wasnt indicating he wasnt understanding that.  The problem is you‚Äôre assuming, and I quite frankly am assuming what his intentions were.  Know who wasn‚Äôt?  Flynn who pleaded guilty!  Then more corruption from Barr, and Trump occurred
Not hilarious truth.  You can try to con your way out of it.  Trump asked for their help on tv.  Flynn acknowledged from the ambassador something had to be done about the sanctions.  Went on further, and said soon as they‚Äôre in office they‚Äôll see what their relationship will be.
yeah Trump is probably going to get another four years
I've been kinda busy the last few days. Has trump told an old school Polack joke yet? I have this one in my office pool.
Notice how Trump never says what his message is. Because he doesn't have one. All he has are childish nicknames &amp; insults. Pathetic.
Prayers for President Trump. Very rich enemies out there...
Plummer Trump.
Arrest Trump
Can't we do better than our own blue trump? Replace Joe biden at the convention with someone who isn't racist and demented. We don't have to walk off the cliff like this
Yup. I like my mask. I keep six feet on purpose and usually avoid groups. But when the vaccine is approved and I think it‚Äôs sooner than not..We should be coming together and enjoying masking up knowing it‚Äôs less than a year before we‚Äôre done. But Trump can‚Äôt put US before him.
Can't we at least pretend we can do better than a blue trump?
If Donald Trump said this, everyone would want him arrested or even say to have him be put in the electric chair
We're supposed to be drawing distinctions from trump, not matching him. Let's not run a demented, self obsessed racist, please? Replace this mess at the convention
I actually grew up with republican parents. I had hoped Romney would win because Trump was such a buffoon. But if Biden winning means that all this crap stops, we get a gentleman in office and a VP who can SPELL VP!! and can return dignity. Let‚Äôs GO!
Well they would. Remember when Trump banned travel to Europe, everyone was on his ass.
Trump never gives, never negotiates; it's always "take it or I'll take my marbles and go home." For Trump it's black-and-white:  "I win or I lose."
She should debate Trump. Not a fair fight.
Pelosi: if you want to be an advocate for them‚Ä¶No how about she says the truth and you don‚Äôt like it, we see you  And know what you‚Äôre doing, your whole goal is about getting Trump out of office instead of working for the people that elected you..shameful
I know you‚Äôre smarter than that Beckel,you just hate Trump.
They hate Trump so much that they want to see the American people suffer‚Ä¶ Democrats let that sink in for a minute
‚ÄúThis latest iteration is simply more of the right doing Trump‚Äôs bidding for him to distract from his own Russia problems, which are real and a grave threat to our national security.‚Äù
I'm willing to bet Trump never kept a promise in his life.
Oh my god we are going back to Clinton.  You are a trump supporter.  If they did anything wrong then they should be punished as well.  But a republican lead investigation determined there was no wrong doing.
This is straight out of a Trump universe. I'm going to take away your education because you told the truth. I weep for humanity.
Trump is NOT pushing any vaxx agenda for mandatory vaxx.  He is pushing for it to be available to the freaked out frightened people who are desperate for it.
If Trump banning Tik Tok doesn‚Äôt motivate Gen Z to vote him out of office, nothing will.
Thank you for sharing. Unfortunately they were probably trying to keep up with this guy..
Seems as relevant as ever.
Suggesting you will throw your vote away with a meaningless gesture and potentially helping Trump be re-elected indicates you are all about yourself rather than the country.  Sad.

The Postmaster General is a Trump appointee and a huge campaign donor. You cannot believe anything he says.
If that doesn't put you in the mood for Donald Trump, how about "Don't Fear the Reaper"?
Trump to sign an executive order that will halt evictions, possibly extend the 600$ unemployment benefit among other things. Dems want a trillion dollars which Trump rightly said that it‚Äôs really just a bailout for Democratic run cities. Just say NO.
Who would be afraid to debate Donald Trump?   Hahahahaha  Hahahahaha  Hahahahaha  Hahahahaha   I would just fact check him every time he opened his lying mouth.
What is wrong with us?  If Biden is really having health issues why are his handlers allowing him to be denigrated, brunt of jokes and ridiculed? Surely something can be done about this.  Politics be damned.  I will be voting for Trump and praying for Biden.
Here is some real stuff.
Just more Bullshit.
Trump is waiting for his Penthouse to be completed in Trump Tower Moscow then he will load up the family &amp; probably try to keep Air Force One in Russia for himself!
I heard it was either a strip club near Mar-A-Lago or the playground at Trump's favorite KFC.
Almost 60% of Americans disapprove of the job ‚Äúsmall man‚Äù  is doing. 60% of Americans believe our country is on the wrong track. America can‚Äôt trust Trump or anyone in his administration for that matter. They want  because he speaks the truth.
Congress needs to quit adding pork to the bills they pass. They pass bills and add things that don‚Äôt even have anything to do with the bill and President Trump can't line item Bills. The Supreme Court declared line items vetoes for the president unconstitutional in 1998.
And thnx to our President...the military will defend Trump. So step on up!
If Trump was actually a Christian he wouldn‚Äôt think anyone could hurt the Bible or hurt God.

Lemme guess: Trump and the GOP
Amanda loves Trump. Just watch her sychophanty ads.
Fauci has already made it clear her is only staying for us and doing what he can. I also think that trump knows Fauci is the one he can't f*%k with.
If your God is named Donald Trump then I suppose Joe Biden is against him.
My guess has always been that Trump doesn't really want a second term, he just wants to destroy the country. So he'll do anything to accomplish the objective.
I live in Kansas. Trump's plumber lost in the primary to a medical doctor.
Nope. Trump is far worse at confusion than Biden will ever be or ever has been. No comparison.
No one really wants Biden to win they‚Äôre just desperate for Trump to lose. Huge difference. It‚Äôs hard to rally behind a candidate no one truly believes in so all the energy is being thrown at attacking any threatening opposition
I suppose the man is pleased Trump held the Bible upside down, not thinking about the similarity with the upside-down cross in devil worship. But yeh.
The scenario continues in which Trump-minion raise the bar for Trump to crush their expectations.
Trump should of known that before agreeing to the schedule.
That‚Äôs funny because Trump reminds me of Lloyd Bridges.
Your performance in Baltimore was a sham and a failure. After listening to you on Fox News talk about the Trump team downward spiral tells me you are either stupid or a purveyor of wrong information. Probably the second. When you talk about polls it showed you know nothing C 2016
I'm guessing that Trump was thinking of Epstein Island when he talked about Thighland.
Last time I saw Trump laugh was when a supporter who screamed "SEND HER BACK" after he mentioned Ilhan Omar.
How dumb do they all feel now that it‚Äôs been proven that hydroxychloriquin actually works and helps if used early on?? Such morons on the left. They could have promoted to help save lives but instead chose Trump derangement syndrome.
Holy....shoot. If Trump said this buildings would be burned. Sad thing is I‚Äôm guessing he didn‚Äôt meAn to say it. Sadder is that his wife allows this clearly sick man to be running for the most stressful job in the world. This should tell you everything you need to know about libs
The CDC, the WHO and nearly every health agency and developed country in the world recommends or mandates masks. Even the Trump Administration says masks are good things. But, hey, if you want to follow Sweden let's be sure to do that in other aspects of public policy too.

If only the data I collect were this definitive. Whether school districts are holding in-person classes this fall has zero relationship to local prevalence of COVID. It's determined by the share of the county's vote that went to Trump in 2016. See Fig. 1!

Nope.  If I were on the right, I'd close my eyes and deny, ignore, and avoid, also I'd kiss Trump's ass and claim we are doing a helluva job combating this virus, and that it is completely contained, and kids should all be in school because playing hooky is bad.
Well now I‚Äôm curious. Has he been cancelled by Trump?? Nah. He‚Äôs hiding something.
I do want to go on record saying that the EO won't go into effect. Something will happy that will make Trump happy or it just won't be enforceable. These EOs are so he can make-believe he's actually doing something because he can't show any leadership with Congress.
Comforting to know you can be suffering from a complete mental breakdown, like he is, and as long as you fill out the paperwork, you can still run to be the leader of the free world. Kinda explains how we got Trump eh?
Just once I'd like a reporter to ask Trump this question "Do you really give a shit about anyone but yourself?" Just be out with it. We all know he doesn't but I think we need a few reporters with balls to get it out of him.
Yes.  My dad succumbed to Narcissistic Dementia.  It was horrifying.  Trump is 80% there. Stay tuned.

Even Fauci is trying to give Trump a major clue to help his re-election. Trump today said this whole thing is the fault of each governor. Same guy in 2016 said he alone could fix ANYTHING!

Poor little Mike is disappointed. Well, you and Trump are hell-of-a-lot worse than a disappointment to the entire U.S. I'm disappointed you can be so stupid!  Pence slams Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts as 'a disappointment to conservatives'
nah. this is what they do with Trump all the time... taking things out of context and making inaccurate implications
Kansas City Southern receives permit approval to build an additional, parallel bridge span next to its existing international bridge in Laredo, Texas - via  #supplychain #usmca
Start with the Trump administration !!
This is going to be annoying. Trump and his campaign are going to say anything to get elected and the media will just take his statements and report them without any care to show if they are even possible.
You are the king of debt...
‚ÄúWell Trump is racist and sexist‚Äù, I will match you point for point why Biden is legitimately racist and a creep. It just really blows my mind that someone would vote for him.
Question to anyone who is really gonna vote for Biden.. why are you voting for him? Without talking shit about Trump, what is the reason you are voting for Biden? Based on his merits alone. I don‚Äôt see it. He literally has no clue what is going on. And if you wanna go the whole
Which is what Trump does every day.  Only difference here is he is insane
Does anyone else find it ironic that all through the 2016 election and into his presidency Democrats constantly called President Trump mentally unfit with zero evidence, then turn around an nominate a candidate who is BLATANTLY in cognitive decline?    #PutThatInYourPipe
Why do we care? Trump isn‚Äôt fit to be President. I know her Dad would vote Biden.
Trump supporters..I don‚Äôt get it..they apparently lost their way..
What‚Äôs wrong with it? I get it..your not happy Biden is the nominee. You have a choice..support him or vote Trump. I will support Joe Biden..because I see what Trump has done to this country.
What is a Trump? Absolutely embarrassed!
Hey I just realized your sentence ended like Joe Biden and his speeches all question marks???? #Confused #BidenIsPuppet
I'll look more democratic Kool-Aid
Since the responses ave devolved to ‚Äúshe‚Äôs rich and she should give her money away‚Äù know that she has given more than $400 million.  the Trump foundation was forced to close due to illegal activities in 2018.
I've never known a pres that didn't try to kill us:  Reagan with "there you go again" Bush I with "read my lips" Clinton with sax, and his brother Bush II with his bumpkinisms Obama with dad jokes  I don't remember them ever trying to literally kill everyone like Trump has.
I couldn't find the original tweet.  "Let's see Trump wriggle out of this..."  ...tweet to be continued...
That's the trump we've all come to know... shift blame.
Come on America, Trump landslide 2020.üëç
How are they hiding it? Trump blames China every time he opens his mouth, which is frequently. If media is ‚Äúhiding‚Äù it then  I wouldn‚Äôt have heard about it, now would I?
We're out here talking about the stupid things Trump and Biden say and here's Pat Roberts saying things like this.
Of course he did run this. Trump can't win with an honest campaign. Spoiler: he won't win with a dishonest one either.
Yet before the hearing Trump himself said she couldn't be trusted to testify.
Yep, Trump lies so often, tries to distract from his other lies!
who you taking Ash Kaash or Teanna Trump?
You can tell this "advocate" is just pushing trump for clout.   Average ppl see this and think that you hate yourself.
My only thought is that these ads cater to Trump's base--the ones they don't need to cater to. Great tactic. üôÑ
I don't understand this weird tactic the Trump campaign is using. First, we're all stuck at home trying to keep from getting sick. Second, how is staying home much better than what Trump is doing which is staying home or at his golf course?
i like donald trump
Anyone else ever been to Yos-e-mite besides Trump?
Remember the outrage when 60,000 DEATHS were being predicted? We're almost at 160,000 now, and Trump still thinks we have under control. We are becoming desensitized to  the tragedy confronting us!
Trump wants to rule like Putin. For ever. He will try to use military to protect his Presidency
you are in titled to your opinion I am independent have always been and not a Trump fan nor do I think Biden is a winner either.
Man did Hamilton‚Äôs campaign and media consultants see him coming. They‚Äôre going to retire on that guy. Kinda proved only Trump can be Trump.
Trump is trying to treat our children like sheep to slaughter.
Trump should not be allowed to use the White House as a GOP convention platform to deliver his GOP acceptance speech. To me, it's abuse of power! Won't be his first time though!
Trump says he didn't know John Lewis, but I tell you, that John Lewis certainly knew Trump and what Trump is!
The Senate judiciary committee meets today in their investigation of the Trump investigation. Yet they cannot agree on a virus relief resolution while people suffer. WHERE THE HELL ARE THEIR PRIORITIES?  Certainly not with the people.
In simpler terms.....any vote against trump is corrupt, invalid and should be tossed. This man is a corrupt and egotistical narcissist. It will take decades to repair all the damage he has done.
how bad is your life when you're a Trump reject? At least he's not in the position of making KS a national laughingstock
Trump makes me wanna puke..every day..

Trump has no clue what he's up against. he'd like to think he does, but the extent of his brain power is confined to a cognitive test a five year old designed.
U.S. Senate candidate Kris Kobach has made his first appearance at his watch party tonight. Earlier today he told us that he‚Äôs not expecting an endorsement form President Trump given DC republicans push for opponent Congressman Roger Marshall. #kssen
No Seth I think you‚Äôre a white supremacists , President Trump doesn‚Äôt hate himself you hate yourself and you hate white people you have a good time. I don‚Äôt have a problem being quite know why I didn‚Äôt do it. Me being white is Gods  choice not my choice.

Trump has no, none, as in ZERO evidence of potential voter fraud. But he does have evidence that he's about to get his ass kicked in this election, even in Florida. Lol. Hence the turnabout in mail voting in Florida.
Absolutely clinical interview with president Trump. What a masterpiece in journalism.
Travel restrictions due to Covid are pretty brutal, almost as bad as when trump placed travel bans on multiple countries because "muslim"
So AOC is the only democrat that gets the finger in the eye. The big finger at that. The rest is just attacks on Trump.
someone in the comments had a great idea, a button that has "bunch of crap" that can be pressed during interviews and Trump press conferences.
I agree, I love that they keep letting Trump do interviews. Every single one adds evidence to the massive file that will decide whether he's institutionalized or imprisoned after this.  Let him keep talking, it's pure entertainment.
I think as Trump and his deplorables go off to prison, Biden needs to say "it is what it is."  On repeat.
oh definitely. Trump will wither under the pressure. Plus I bet either there's no audience or such a limited audience he won't have enough oxygen to fuel his rants.
‚ÄòIdiot‚Äô Trump mocked after struggling to pronounce Yosemite: ‚ÄòAnd he questions Biden‚Äôs cognitive abilities?‚Äô
This is like saying 31% of people trust Trump lead the country in the most deadly fight since WWI.
Wake up people, Trump is simply trying to justify why he won't fly to Florida, at taxpayer expense no less, to vote.
Trump is an idiot last night he said we should send the kids back to school  when literally 250 people got sick after one day of school and no baseball and basketball ratings haven‚Äôt went down
So what you're saying is that you love Trump more than the Constitution. Cool. Good to know.
I think the problem is more with people who think they‚Äôre being morally superior by choosing 3rd party. If you actually care about helping and protecting the communities you claim to care about, then we need to ensure that Trump is not in office.
"We have the pandemic under control." -Trump yesterday, as 1,000 more died from the virus. "Its going to get worse before it gets better." -Trump last week.  "We are doing everything we can to stop the virus." -Trump yesterday. Golf away motherfucker.  Golf away. 1st Amendment.
So much on military spending. Why? Maybe because Trump stole billions from the pentagon's funds to build a wall!
They‚Äôre all Trump supporters... so my dad will be getting a write in vote
Some strong voices in LA for Trump - God bless them!
Why isn‚Äôt president Trump personally stopping all deaths in America? This is a fair and legitimate question.    #PutThatInYourPipe

Trump is +12 in my state. He won it by 20 last go round.    #PutThatInYourPipe
The truth is out. Trump and his family are murderers.
You're a fool. Trump is a sociopath that must be removed before Nov 3. 25th amendment now
False. Trump bnb is mentally I'll. He has no insight or judgment.  Allowing bnb him to continue to remain as POTUS is murdering US ci TY dozens. 25th Amendment now
He's not a generic R. Ideologically, he's much like Trump but not as abrasive. Pompeo is a fighter though. He's building a strong record as veteran, businessman, congressman, CIA Director, and now SoS. If he wants President I think he'll also add KS Governor or Senator in 2022.
Pompeo will be a major player if he wants it. Perhaps the frontrunner. I'd put stronger odds on him than Pence. Haley might also be a top contender. I could see Cruz trying again. Kobach will be in the conversation if he makes the Senate. Possibly Trump Jr. But also others...
My granddaughter is in 1st grade this year and is smarter than tRump
ya i restart on the 27th and im going back willingly because my grades got alot worse in online school but i'll be safe unloaded and im not gonna let trump kill me with his stupidnessw\
Biden is too far gone. He can't cope w/presidency. If you really want to destroy American &amp; make us live in poverty, hungry &amp; lose our Religious freedom then run Hillary, Cuomo, Michelle. Trump is the only hope to bring us back from debt.
Trump is correct !  He needs to start telling the people the truth instead his same old Con job every day !!   ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
I'm a Kansan and I hate him. Throw in Pompeo and we have two trump lovin shit bags.
I just mean the local ones. They‚Äôre all insane and they all LOOOOOOOOVE Trump.

how do you feel about tiktok accounts like this one using Red Kingdom as an anthem to promote Donald Trump's relection campaign? #redkingdom
Must be a Monday .. but since Trump planted his ass in the WH.. every day feels like a Monday ...
Trump is not a doctor chemist nor a scholar and we all know that. Republicans please wake up and listen to the lies.
To  (Sloppy Joe) you had better not debate Trump, cuz if you thought Hillary caught shit you will be murdered...lol
The minute you stopped talking about your state and started to become a junior huckster for Trump, you sold your soul and all credibility you had built.  Try again. California needs balance, but you don't appear to be strong enough to deliver it.
So, Trump‚Äôs issue with mail-in ballots:  I had assumed it was because he was worried that more mail-in votes meant more Dems would vote. My wife thought it was because of the insecurity/hackability of the in person voting machines. Her notion is far more terrifying

Ah, the leftist playbook. Besmirch, insult &amp; denigrate. No facts, as is the norm.  At least Trump knows who he is, where he is, the job he is seeking .... and doesn't hide in the basement (only coming out for scripted softball "interviews').

. has always, ALWAYS been a racist. it shows here.  . has always, ALWAYS been a fascist. it shows here.  if you support him, you cannot say you don't support racism and fascism.  a vote for Trump is a vote for hate and oppression.

Nope...just a libtard attempt to make Trump look bad!
As do all Christian Conservatives,we love our country and culture, unlike you,Trump isn‚Äôt a Dictator the Dictators are who the liberal socialist Democratic Party in America support ! China Iran Venezuela Cuba pure pig vomit! Biden, AOC,Talib, Omar, these are the lousiest!

oh, no disagreement there. Ds should commit to it, but hold it until after the election. if Trump loses, he's a sitting duck, and they can let the courts send him to Leavenworth. if, by some unholy agreement with Satan, he wins, and Ds take Senate and keep House, he's fucked.
#TraitorsSupportTraitorTrump  watch out, Aussies. Trump will stab you in the back. ask the EU.
Trump's cognitive test from this past week
In a course I took  a Democrat lecturer explained how he merges datasets for targeting.  does the same for Trump. Both parties know a voter like  prefers Dems even if he unaffiliates in the future. Would be much more powerful with google tracking!
Obama spent nearly $10 Trillion dollars, doubled our National debt. Sent most of that money to foreign countries. Trump is the hardest working prez. Dem's Socialism will humble even Movie Stars &amp; $20 Million dollar Athletes. It takes money upto 85% &amp; redistributed it to the poor.
Fuck Dr. Birx. She is complicit with the Trump Admin. She made her bed with 45, now she wants to cry wolf? FOH. We‚Äôve been known this virus was serious and we don‚Äôt know how it behaves. We‚Äôre having issues and it still hasn‚Äôt mutated.
so they've gone from fraud (there is none) to delayed outcome.  no matter what happens, Trump will find a way to delay the outcome. the only voter frauds in the country are Trump, his enablers, and

Banning travel from chine wouldn't have done the trick.. tRump got his border wall, only this is a wall preventing American's from going to other countries since we're so badly infected. #maskup #VoteOutTrump #FredsFailure #TrumpleThinSkin #BunkerBoyTrump #VoteBlue2020
Interesting statement, considering YOU don't give Trump the respect of the office he holds. I love how blind you are to your own hypocrisy.  #Trump2020
Yeah, thought you guys were the alternative to Trump. You proved me wrong.
"We've all said it. Don't act like you haven't."  "He didn't participate, why are you sex shaming?"  "Ÿ±ŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸéŸÖŸíÿØŸè ŸÑŸêŸÑŸéŸëŸ∞ŸáŸê, President Trump"
On top of that. Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself. Bill Clinton went to pedo island 26 times in a two year period. Trump was never there. The democrats and FBI have been covering this up since 2011. The pedo ring is being exposed. #Trump2020
. The trouble is 21st century truth is often complex, nuanced, requires the pre-frontal cortex, and frequently in some way esoteric, while Trump‚Äôs *political technology* trades in simple limbic emotion and works exoterically.

Yes because we all know trump will turn a debate into a shit show anyway
this was not  writing this. the language is not Trump. I'm guessing he had a TIA or two which is causing his physical weaknesses to become more apparent. that's on top of the dementia issue. #TrumpIsNotWell
Can we just ban tRump? #TrumpleThinSkin #TrumpKillsAmericans #FuckYouTrump  #FredsFailure
main takeaway:  is scared China will influence election via TikTok. yet, they're actively seeking foreign assist on behalf of  Brazil, Russia, Ukraine.  I call bullshit, you fucking assholes. this is about Trump's ego, not natl sec.
timeline: Trump signs EO to can TikTok. TikTok files injunction, remains open. litigation proceeds through November, into next year. Biden wins election. Biden inaugurated Jan 20 at noon. signs EO reversing Trump ban.  it's all for show, kids.
Oh I will be voting and it‚Äôs going to be hilarious when Trump loses to one of the worst democratic candidates in a century. How‚Äôs that trump economy doing? 150k Americans dead am I right?
What about your brother, steroid boy. He sent infected COVID patients back into nursing homes killing hundreds when Trump had a medical ship with beds available, Your liberal Democratic fake news weaseling coward!
Also take a good look at the United States right now? We have no right to talk on human rights. Tear gassing our citizens and picking protesters up in unmarked vans? Sounds like trump has his new gestapo in place
What about the children trump has in cages and the black men being murdered by our police for walking down the street? And what about Trumps ties to jefferey Epstein‚Äôs pedophilia cult? ü§°ü§°ü§°
Gonna be hilarious when Trump loses to dementia Joe! Oh wait y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt gonna accept the election either way right? The inner facsist in you won‚Äôt allow it

Y‚Äôall do realize Trump trying to ‚Äúban‚Äù Tik Tok is just another distraction from his disastrous handle on the pandemic and civil discourse right now?

Mid pandemic &amp; mass chaos for schools trying to reopen, President Trump says he plans to ban TikTok from the US
I find it ironic that a lot of customers come through wearing "trump 2020" facemasks.  Isn't he the lead Covid denier ?
only if you're Trump
Check out GAL4xY_PR0DUCT10NS's video! #TikTok yeah Trump should be very worried if the ban happen because we will push back 10 times worse
You know Trump, I'm all for federal intervention with these clowns. But at least have your feds identify themselves when they pluck protestors off the street and use marked cars. And make sure your feds are arresting them for valid reasons.
Are you on crack Trump?
Trump will EO it. or at least try to.
I'm one of the not most parents.  Trump can shove off. so can this moron.
Trump is more childish than the teens who use TikTok.
No matter what Trump is going to try to leave his name sake on the White House either it be remodeled the Rosegarden or the oval office because he wants it to be remembered as the Trump change
I have an idea ..vote for Trump ..he will welcome you..
And Liquor store? U can get your celebratory champagne and vote for Trump at the same time..
Murray, Yes, Trump is blunt. He's also realistic about our economy. It wouldn't be so bad if the Left didn't blame him no matter which way he decides. Dems have a distinct agenda for America. It's called Bankruptcy so we are forced under the Godless UN doing what we are told.
Matthew, Trump is the ONLY one who can bring our economy back. Those who are clueless are burdening future generations w/a dismal existences. Stock Market Crash? Not looking forward to waiting in line for a can of soup or loaf of bread like Cuba. $25 Trilion debt coming due too?
Trump gonna have the biggest power move in 2020. Taking down the pedo ring. Trump was a Hollywood elite, he knows what went on, that‚Äôs why no one wanted him to ge President. #exposed
And what was Trump doing during his briefings? Ignoring them completely! Trump: It'll be gone by Easter. It'll be gone by Summer. It'll just disappear. We're doing great.
You may be right. No one may be listed as dying from heart, cancer, lungs, diabetes, dementia, MS, parkinson, ALS, asthma, etc. Blame it on the virus &amp; Trump! Dems may succeed in closing us down? Sad to see America bankrupt, poverty, open borders &amp; squalor. Dismal future for all?
You promise to repeal and replace all you did was repeal so that makes you worse than Biden or any other former presidential official ever in the world. Mr. Comrade mashed potato head Trump
Congressman Clyburn don‚Äôt listen to Mashed potatoes head Comrade Trump
Republicans are forcing the Census Bureau to finish its count early instead of giving them more time like they need.   This will cause astronomical repercussions throughout the country and Trump is getting away with it.   Fill out the census.
Totally..I just can‚Äôt listen to their BS! All they have to say is Trump did it all right and STFU! Let the left point out the real facts!
The trash that comes from his mouth affects the whole world. Get it thru your head people, Trump is personally responsible for the deaths of so many of our own citizens!  Trump's trashing of democracy will have consequences beyond America
You are complaining about the deficit now that we are in a national crisis? You and Trump ran it up big time before March hit! You don't have to give the dems everything but come on, your bill is ridiculous.
I live in an area of the country where not supporting trump enough is used as an attack.  #yikes
They better NEVER accuse Trump of using his press briefings as campaign stumps again!!!ü§¨
He got in my face when I was protesting at the Trump rally, trying to get me to take a swing in front of cops...I wanted to so bad
Dump that Trump, if you wanna make america great again let someone else win!
Trump really can go catch COVID anytime now. I'm not holding him back.
the Republican Party no longer exists.  You and your trump cult followers have totally killed a once proud party. A party that stood for things Americans could be proud of. Hard work. Strong military. Family. Now it‚Äôs just a cult. #Congrats
Karen, the second part of your statement would apply so aptly to Trump. Talk about hatred for others.
They were actually going to do something but abandoned plans because of bullshit political pettiness. Trump could've been a hero and be coasting to reelection but now is struggling and threatening to upend our democracy because he's a failure.
I‚Äôd be curious how veterans that support Trump can still do so after seeing this.
Kansas secretary of state says no to Trump‚Äôs proposed delay of the November election.
How can trump say the jobs report looks good but over a million people filled for unemployment.
Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab opposes Pres. Trump's request to encourage the delay of November elections...
He committed treason by ordering the spying on the Trump campaign.  He also ordered the targeting of Michael Flynn for destruction.

Trump has no power to delay the upcoming election. This is just a desperate plea because he knows he is losing.
Apparently you have arrived. Trump is a new Christian, stop hating and pray for him. Do you still drink milk? He does. What a pity your going to use the word of God to condemn, that‚Äôs not at all what that scripture is referring to. Ok, be perfect!
Look at handle. Not actual trump. Parody account.
The Republican sycophants should have realized by now that Trump doesn't joke.
Dumbasses. Virus came from Europe too...no ban. Thousands still came from China AFTER the ban. Just like trump...blame everybody else. #NoBallsGOP
No, I would resign if my boss required me to stand up and greet Trump.  Or perhaps call in deathly ill that day.

You also must avoid common sense, peer reviewed studies &amp; anyone who doesn't buy into political lies.   N95 masks are the only actual help in contaminated areas.   You can riot/protest w/o masks in the 1000s, but don't dare sing in church, go to a Trump rally or a hair salon. TDS

1) remember, even though he's going to get it, Biden ISN'T officially the Dem nominee yet 2) voting NO to the platform =/= she supports Tr*mp, you idiots. The platform does not include med4all which a majority of Dem voters want. She's actually voting in line FOR the people.
Give me 5 things Biden has done for this country.
Of course not bc he's mentally ill...and that's exactly why the PREDATORS, i.e. Jared Kushner and Trump r pouncing on him bc they believe he can STEAL a good percentage of the Black votes away from Biden/Harris in key states.  I mean...I'm not Sherlock Holmes but seems logical.üßê
I just had a thought, maybe a premonition that when Biden wins, Trump supporters are going to riot by setting fire to USPS postal vehicles.

Make it official and hold him in contempt.  People need to start going to jail NOW for what's happening, not "maybe" later if Biden wins.
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Call For Mask Mandates Nationwide To Prevent Coronavirus

when does Biden do an actual interview by someone who's not his friend?
The photographer posted an edited version of Joe Biden's 2020 campaign logo.
BIDEN ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS, RACIST.  THOUGHT OF BLACKS AS INFERIOR RACE.  VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN SO THEIR CHILDREN WOULDN'T GO TO SCHOOL WITH BLACKS.  BIDEN WROTE CRIME BILL, RESULTED IN MASS INCARCERATION OF MINORITIES.
Vote for Biden. There is no perfect candidate, just as there are no perfect people.
Harvarti is very underrated and a personal favorite of mine. Also, I am voting for Joe Biden but that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt mean I like him.
BIDEN ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  ABOUT 8O YRS OLD, BRAIN SURGERIES, POLL EVEN DEMOCRAT SHOWS DEMENTIA.  OFTEN DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.  WAS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SAID IN VERMONT, HAD ON NO MASK.  SAID RUNNING FOR SENATE CAMPAIGN HIDING HIM
As I drive around Kansas City (MO) area for post mates I‚Äôve seen a total of 3 Biden signs.
This has got to be the most racist thing I have ever heard a politician say, good thing it‚Äôs a dumb millennial who‚Äôs typing, we all know his boy Biden created this system
I am excited to endorse the presidential ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  They are ready to tackle the crippling issues facing our country with the urgency and seriousness they deserve.  #VoteEarly #VoteOften #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden isn't a sensitive little bitch like Trump so he was able to put his big boy pants on and move on.
He said it at a campaign rally in February, dumbass! The entire month he did nothing to prepare our country for the worst pandemic in 100 years. Called it a hoax by the Democrats. And for the record, again I am not a Democrat, not a Biden supporter, but Trump has got to go.
Vote 11 03 2020!! Let‚Äôs get behind the Biden/Harris ticket. #templeoffaithkc #VoteBidenHarris2020
How many days before the election will Barr announce an investigation into Biden and Harris?
Right? Bernie is a bit too crazy now for me. But Kamala and Biden are hardly an answer either.
I thought the very same thing. What‚Äôs Biden got to do with it? Why use his pic? That way if anybody googles it, his pic comes up insinuating he was involved? Bloomberg = original dirty trickster.
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked ‚ÄòAunt Jemima as his VP‚Äô A lawmaker has been asked to step down after comments about vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris
Hear ye, hear ye - people over the age of 45:  Ultimatums and shaming folks about not agreeing with you (now, in regards to the Biden/Harris ticket) has never, in the history of the world, counteracted hopelessness.
If you really don't see the difference between Biden and Trump, you're lying to yourself.   I 100% support a #GeneralStrike. Wouldn't a strike be more effective with Biden in office?
The Undertold, Undersold Story of Kamala Harris
The postal workers union endorses Biden-Harris. Never forget roughly 100,000 US Veterans work for USPS and their livelihoods are on the line.
Lol, offended so easily! Give an example of Trump being a racist? I‚Äôll wait....  ‚ÄúBecause poor kids are just smart as white kids‚Äù or ‚Äúc‚Äômon man! You ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for me!‚Äù Quotes like Joe Biden! (And you can even spell Trump correctly)
Just been listening to CNN and Trump answering questions from reporters? I can‚Äôt believe how they allow this clown to lie and not one of them challenge him? Bashing Joe Biden with false statements and blaming Dems, non stop?  This is the worst country in the history of America
I hate you you are not black and I pray that not a one black person vote for you fake b.tch.And your sick partner diaper Joe Biden. Go to hell you and your party.
if you have information on Biden release it. Why don't you just go ahead and resign instead of joining Trump to change our democracy into a fascist country. I consider you a traitor and it is sad.
It's been all over Twitter where I saw,along with audio of the call made from Ukraine officials to Biden,how they fired him and changed their laws to accommodate further bribes apparently lol,try to keep up
The staffer on the Biden campaign who discovered this should get extra ice cream today.
Immigrant children were reported by the AP as being locked up as early as June 2014 under Obama/Biden. Our choices r the guy that said he wouldnt tear them down or the guy that set them up?  You allude if she doesnt vote for the ‚Äúright‚Äù candidate those kids are ‚Äúon her‚Äù
Does Joe Biden even write his own tweets? #BidenHarris2020
I‚Äôll get it when the Biden administration says it‚Äôs safe.
I stand by that Biden will be a GOOD president.
Mike Pence said that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to take your meat. If that happens you can no longer go to a meet and greet. It will just be a greet.
Joe Biden could walk up to me and stab me in the side and Kamala could walk by and spit on me as I lay there on the ground bleeding and I WOULD STILL VOTE FOR THEM.  I would.
You‚Äôre digging a deeper hole. Don‚Äôt play word games. Just say yes, Biden and Harris need to answer questions.
It's 2020 and the Republican party is strongly warning me that Joe Biden is coming for my meat.
Trump and Biden are polar opposites when it comes to policy.
It looks like Biden is exactly where Hillary was at this time in 2016.  Hillary had the ‚Äúfirst woman president‚Äù thing going for her, I did see Hillary bumper stickers and yard signs.  I have seen exactly one Biden bumper sticker and zero Biden yard signs.
She has 1/4 mixed white and Jamaican. 1/2 Tamil. 1/4 white Irish slave-owner.  Biden has insulted American blacks with this choice.
Biden insulted blacks by choosing her to represent blacks..  Biden insulted women by choosing her to represent women.
Biden has insulted blacks with his choice of a ‚Äúblack‚Äú. 1/2 Tamil, 1/4 Irish slave-owner, 1/4 mixed white/ Jamaican.
Biden has insulted blacks by his choice of a ‚Äúblack‚Äù who is 1/2 Tamil, 1/4 Irish slave owner, 1/4 mix Jamaican + white.  Biden has insulted women by his choice of an arrogant Hoe who used sex to get jobs.  Biden himself is an insult to America.  Corrupt.
No one is voting for Biden, they're just voting against Trump
The amount of new Biden signs I saw on my walk this morning &gt;&gt;&gt; I‚Äôve never been more proud to see people settle
Every Republican including Joe Biden has tried to defund Social Security.  I am so old that I can vividly remember my grandmother caring for both her bed-ridden mother and bed-ridden mother-in-law in her home for years.
Obama and Biden need to plead guilty, along with a multitude of others!
Hillary Clinton is the nasty woman‚Äôs disease.  She choreographed this 2020 Democratic primary with scary precision.  From Iowa on.  The Clintons anointed Harris in the Hamptons three years ago to be the 2020 Democratic nominee. If Biden wins, Harris will be president.
She'd have a better chance compared to Dementia Joe Biden.
This is not original, but it is like Biden stole your car then comes back to ask you for gas money.
While there are undoubtedly many who will not get vaccinated out of some strange political loyalty or belief in conspiracy, there are far more who are lying when they say they won't.  Talk is cheap. Self-preservation is an effective motivator.
As long as people are buying post office shirts and forever stamps, they‚Äôre not selecting checks for the Biden campaign. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden is the dmt death burst of democracy
It‚Äôs since Biden and Kamala announced ppl have become way more lenient with social justice, that protest energy is dead...
I see the hardened racist washed up fallen star is trending again. I will NOT give him attn but he‚Äôs trying to smear Biden. What I WILL say. MATURE PPL listen,grow,change. #BidenHarris2020Landslide #VetsResistSquadron
Their original plan announced in Feb was to vote for the underdog and prolong the primaries, which was expected to be sanders. Then sanders won the first three, so they changed track to biden. Then dems latched on to biden's one win to consolidate with unprecedented intensity.
Among those voters who plan to use mail-in ballots, Biden leads by an astounding 50 points, 72% to 22%.  Among those who plan to vote in-person on Election Day, Trump leads by 35 pts, 55% to 31%.  Among those who plan to vote in-person early, Trump leads by 4 pts, 49% to 45%.
It‚Äôs OK. Biden and trump are tied for the white people vote which means Trump has lost.
Sometimes you just have to scratch your head and wonder where all of this is leading us.  Democratic Party sets rules for criticizing Biden‚Äôs VP pick Kamala Harris -  -
How?  Joe Biden will have complete media complicity
Dr. Siegel tells Tucker Carlson there is 'no science' behind Biden's mask mandate
If liberals are hesitant to join us in a #GeneralStrike  during the fucking Trump administration after Washington DC abandoned MILLIONS of people  I have no idea how anyone can make a coherent argument that they will help us push Biden left when he's in charge  Clown shit
BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW OBAMA  LEADER OF METOO ENDORSED MULTI-MILLIONAIRE BIDEN FOR PRES WHEN HE WAS ACCUSED OF RAPE OF POOR TARA READE.  CAREER, ACCUSED OF SEX CRIMES OF POOR WOMEN &amp; LITTLE GIRLS.  WHY DID DR GILL BIDEN LET IT CONTINUE?
The disappointing thing was Craig Melvyns indignant question as to when Biden/Harris were going to start "answering questions." They know they are co-conspirators but feel entitled to do Trumps dirty work for him
Alot of people call themselves anti imperialist but they are telling people to vote for Biden  Very confusing
If Joe Biden were president we would have a united plan against the pandemic. There would be a mandated mask order. If we really want this pandemic to end wear an effing mask! The GOP needs to step aside and let the smart people lead.
Why do they think will have leverage over Biden when Biden already said he will be a one term president?  Obama did all the shit he did while worrying about reelection  Biden is to his RIGHT and doesnt have to worry about it plus you pledged your vote. Makes no sense
But a biden presidency congeals the unification of democrats with Bush Republicans, and results in liberals then defending all those hideous trump policies when biden just continues them.
Essentially what I just heard on  is: Trump moves the news cycle Biden/Harris have not followed that tactic , and remained laser focused on their agenda because they are not answering reporters questions That leads to the inescapable conclusion, the news media enables Trump
That's funny. Buy me a Punch Presidente Maduro when Biden wins.
Do you really not remember biden and Obama championing pipelines and incentivizing the massive expansion of fracking wells for natural gas?  Wells which are currently vomiting super-greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere, totally uncontrolled, as they are abandoned?
A NEW POLL FINDS THAT BIDEN'S SUPPORTERS ARE LESS ENTHUSIASTIC OF HIM.  RASMUSSEN REPORT SURVEY POLL: 59% THINK BIDEN IS UNLIKELY TO FINISH HIS FIRST TERM.  HIS VP IS NOT BLACK, SHE IS JAMAICAN INDIAN.   NOBODY WANTS THE JOB OF SELLING BIDEN DOOR TO DOOR.
Overconfident. Biden is neck and neck in 3 traditional red states. Kicking ass in all other blue states.
You know Biden wins Florida. Trump has zero chance at reelection. Bet you a good cigar.
I want him to explain how we push Biden to the left after pledging out vote to him when he's going to be a one term president anyway and dont have to worry about reelection  Very interested in hearing it
I have issues with the woman that basically called Biden a racist and said she believed his accusers jumping at the chance to run with him.
Dude. Trump can't win. End of story. Biden is so prepared. 600 lawyers ready at his response. Done deal.
As we all knew, SHE‚ÄôS the one running and doing all the talking for Hidin‚Äô Biden!  Sorry, but I‚Äôm totally sick of her, already!!!
punching left accomplishes what exactly?  He is a fucking grifter  He is pissing more people off than convincing to vote Biden
If biden wants to actually oppose trump policies and push for good things instead, I'm all ears. But he's very clearly not interested in that.
That, ultimately, is the problem. Biden doesn't actually represent stopping trump policies at all. He represents getting liberals to support trump policies at 60% power. I'd rather then keep opposing fascism instead of being partially invested in it.
Trouble is, biden has made it clear that not only will he not punish any of those trump people if he gets in office, he's likely to generally sustain all of trump's policies. He literally said he's going to make most of the trump tax cuts permanent!
Biden will save the Post Office. Republicans are dead meat. This party is so fucked up. I hope they all rot in hell. Especially Pedophile Gym Jordan I am really pissed off. Hate that party.
If Joe Biden were president, we‚Äôd already be past the worst of this. Instead we have record-setting unemployment and 200,000 deaths projected through next month. Please look at reality. Or just keep quiet.
BIDEN HAS ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS ALL RACIST &amp; SEXIST.   THOUGHT OF BLACKS AS INFERIOR RACE  VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN AGAINST MINORITIES.  SENATE AIDE TARA READE ACCUSED MULTI-MILLIONAIRE  BIDEN OF RAPE  CAREER, ACCUSED OF SEX CRIMES
To put it bluntly: biden and the democrats explicitly aren't even offering bread and circuses and have rejected doing so for costs. They're at best just promising that the prison guard kicking you in the stomach might not be a white man, perhaps, someday.
Can we get Biden to take some questions for Christsakes
Vote AGAINST Trump!  Vot e Biden/Harris2020 #DumpTrump2020
I mean... Biden is going to sustain all of the brutal trump policies about protest responses. This federal escalation was literally out of a playbook biden and Obama wrote! None of the tear gas and beatings and punitive arrests will stop or even slow down.
We can‚Äôt get Biden even to take ANY questions. He forgets where he is.  Creepy Joe
We need to add 10 points to Trump and take away 10 points from Biden with every one of these polls we see. That‚Äôs the advantage Trump gets from the cheating, the suppression, the screwing with the postal service, and Russia.
It's not like they were voting Biden anyway.                                                 #Joemala2020
Biden is going to sustain every single negative policy from trump, he's explicitly said he's rejecting every policy I consider important, he's going to drop DACA like it's hot... If he wants my vote, he can consider changing his mind on any of those things. Try supporting m4a Joe
BIDEN ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS, RACIST &amp; SEXIST.  VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN SO THEIR CHILDREN WOULDN'T GO TO SCHOOL WITH BLACKS.  SENATE AIDE TARA READE ACCUSED MULTI-MILLIONAIRE BIDEN OF RAPE.  CAREER ACCUSED OF SEX CRIMES OF WOMEN
how do we get Pence and Biden to Debate?  Followed by Harris and Trump?  Mix it up, baby!
Kamala Harris in past interviews has said she wouldn't champion programs and policies specifically beneficial to Black ADOS. Nor has she or Joe Biden addressed any of the issues mentioned here, in their campaigns. She is literally just a Black face in a high place. #BidenHarris
I‚Äôm also not going to let Joe Biden cut my meat.
I don't think Joe biden's ever had a original thought in his head.
Joe Biden is no John Kerry when it comes to his Catholic faith, and this invites a robust debate about the public significance of Catholic faith.
History of asthma.... As a child but was able to play sports in Highschool and College... and was a life guard....but couldn't serve due to Asthma.  Hmmmmü§î (6 Deferments for Biden.)
Not even close. Clinton was within margin. Biden is not.
BIDEN &amp; DEMOCRATS WANTING CRIME AND EVEN MURDER IN ORDER TO DEFEAT REPUBLICANS IN NOVEMBER.  DEMOCRATS SEEM TO WANT TO TURN CITIES INTO WARZONE.  THEY WANT CRIME AND MURDER.    BIDEN WANTS TO CHANGE POLICE FUNDS, HE HAS A FUND THAT GETS RIOTERS OUT OF JAIL.
Is that the best that you have Pence? Biden and Harris will take away red meat when they are elected. No wonder Trump‚Äôs rigging the election (Putin, post office, birther conspiracies).Believe me, it‚Äôs not going to happen. You are out. Becky
And Clinton says she would be willing to serve in a Biden administration...as the President when they put Joe in the home. #KillarysBack #Trump2020
A ‚Äúselfless leader‚Äù huh? Interesting to hear considering earlier this year Kamala said she believed the women who accused Joe Biden of sexual assault and rape. This party is bought and paid for more than creepy Joe‚Äôs son.
BIDEN &amp; DEMOCRATS WANTING CRIME AND EVEN MURDER IN ORDER TO DEFEAT REPUBLICANS IN NOVEMBER.  DEMOCRATS SEEM TO WANT TO TURN CITIES INTO WARZONE.  THEY WANT CRIME AND MURDER.  BIDEN WANTS TO MISMANDLE POLICE FUNDS.  HAS A FUND USED TO GET RIOTERS OUT OF JAIL.
Did Biden serve?
lets watch trumps train go by using coal to continue ruin the atmosphere because he doesn‚Äôt care at all about Mother Earth. Then let‚Äôs watch Biden put all his power into MAN POWER to get any where he wants. #biden2020
Yeah, Politico does love a good ‚ÄúDems in Disarray‚Äù story but this is interesting. A lot of gossip but this is why a lot of people like Biden. He‚Äôs just a regular guy whose accomplished a lot and always faced adversity including ‚Äúelites‚Äù who have never accepted him
Vote Biden/Harris unless you‚Äôre in a sure-thing blue state. And hold them accountable for their despicable bullshit.
There‚Äôs a lot of groups who have room to criticize Biden bumbling like an idiot and Trump supporters are not one üòÇ y‚Äôall have the King idiot please pipe down
There are so many "progressives" with Stockholm Syndrome over the two party system to the point where they repeat their political fanfiction as if its fact   We couldn't push Obama to the left, and Joe Biden is to his RIGHT
Those people aren't Biden voters anyway.
Adding to a long list of exs in which he manipulates faith for pol gain the¬†pres‚Äôs rant in Ohio¬†last Thurs also undermined yet another sec of the Constitution ‚Äî¬†Article 6, Section 3¬†‚Äî which quite specifically states that there is no relig test for office.
This is in contrast to the Obama's and Clintons" and Biden's who all saw their net worth sky rocket.  One works for you and the rest for themselves and their cronies.
Biden, Harris blasted by mainstream media for not taking questions from reporters
Vox says Biden is 'moving left' with Harris on ticket despite media calling her 'moderate'
Biden lies about what Trump says, makes it the centerpiece of his campaign, and you can‚Äôt see who is creating racial division in pursuit of power? Instead, you suggest someone you don‚Äôt know is racist. Cognitive dissonance. More important, Biden hurts America.
We Catholics should be able to explain how our faith informs all of our decisions, including our political ones. Biden's decision to lean in to the discussion, and not to avoid it, will be good for Catholicism, whether or not it is good for the Democrats.
WTF is Pence talking about??? Biden &amp; Harris r now going to ''cut America's meat?" How and where do they come up with this nonsense anyway???üò≥üëá
He won't. Perhaps we should focus our imagination on Biden and Harris taking office in January 2021.üëç
POST OFFICE IS NOT GOING ANY WHERE. TRUMP IS. LET THAT SINK IN. TRUMP IS DONE. TIMING IS EVERYTHING. BIDEN WILL STILL KICK HIS ASS. TRUMP IS GOING BYE BYE.
If and/or when Biden/Harris win in a landslide victory, the Senate will naturally flip.  Then we can finally get things done and Mitch will lose all his power, even if he wins re-election, which I don't feel he will...not even close. The Turtle's time is up too.
Yes, this IS our last stand, James. And WE THE PEOPLE are drawing a line in sand and we chose Biden and Harris on November 3.   Why u ask?üò≥ Bc we've fucking HAD it with this sociopathic LUNATIC.üëá  So, ya know, you've LOST. ‚ö°Ô∏è
Biden looks so ready to take our country back.
America, tell my friend John Fox to vote Biden.
The American people are seeing how frail the Orange ass is. Biden looks vibrant and ready to roll.
"We're not gonna let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America's meat". Mike Pence..
That would require senile old Joe to speak without a cue card or teleprompter &amp; we all know that is no longer part of Biden‚Äôs skill set.
Looks like the Democrat‚Äôs get-out-of-Biden-nominee card was to allow him to appoint an ineligible running mate par for the course after all BO was never eligible to serve as POTUS either
I had some steaks in the freezer last night but Joe Biden and Kamala Harris snuck in and stole all my meat.
BREAKING: New FOX poll says that Biden is leading Trump 50 to 36% on who Americans think who would do a better job handling coronavirus.  That's a 14 point lead...which is astounding, considering our ''divisiveness."   Doesn't look like we're that divided any longer.üò≥
Amen üëè And now Biden/Harris üôèüéâ
Conservative Lisa: Barack's Father Was Never a US Citizens = Not a Natural Born US Citizen Disqualifies his Presidency Both Kamala‚Äôs parents were foreign citizens at the time of her birth disqualifying entire Biden/Harris Democrat ticket=Trump WINS vs No D
Joe biden does not want your guns!
How did he get that from Biden recommending that everyone wear a mask?Look what the Democrat blue waves did to Biden‚Äôs boat...
That‚Äôs statistic is for 143 criminal convictions for absentee ballot fraud which is a true statistic because absentee voting is very secure. That‚Äôs what Trump wants. Biden wants people to just mail in votes with USPS with no verification. SUPER BAD, for both sides (fraud)
Give me 5 things Biden has done for this country.
He doesn‚Äôt really need to....Trump is doing a fine job building support for Biden.
So could Pelosi take the presidency, make Biden her vice president, Then resign, Biden moves up, And then he makes Kamala Harris his Vice President?
We have known all of this for 3.5 years.The misdeeds go all the way up to Obama and Biden.Not a single traitor has been charged to date with the election weeks away.There is NO guarantee that Trump wins and if he doesnt the worst political crime in US history goes away like that.
Joe Biden can‚Äôt explain the Electoral College. Seriously.
It's infuriating that those who oppose Trump are willing to accept Biden. Really anyone who thinks that Biden is the best option in this country is not using their brain. At least his VP can complete a thought which is a small upgrade.
Near Biden‚Äôs hometown on the night he is expected to accept the Democratic nomination (he is Biden). Grammar doesn‚Äôt matter here.   ALL LIVES MATTER, BACK THE BLUE
Joe Biden 2020 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Bunker Boy‚Äù That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the campaign.
Now There's No Denying It: Obama, BIDEN, Comey, FBI Spied On Trump... Period
You are correct, my main client voted 4 Trump now she is Biden, because Trump just has to go she says, I said if you could see the big picture you wouldn't think so, ppl Do Not Understand the Optics on purpose and the tweeting, lost won't listen at all!
Joe Biden has been in Washington for 50 years. If you think he's all of a sudden going to bring the change you're wanting now... You're more delusional that he is. #ElectionDay #ThirdParty #November3rd
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ the latest from the tRump team. Code Red, what a joke!!! Bring on Hillary.   Pres. Trump: Crooked Hillary suggested she'll serve in a Biden Admin. We MUST keep her out of the White House! CODE RED
Mr. Biden, there‚Äôs a difference between an absentee ballot and universal mail-in voting.
Notice, they never said to wear masks outside like Biden talked about. If they had asked it that way the number would be around 40 %. The amount of brainwashed die hard Democrat‚Äôs.
So Joe Biden is really not President? So I am assuming their are about 20 Co-Presidents?
300k+ National Association of Letter Carriers ENDORSE Joe Biden. üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá That's what I like to hear.
Vote Biden-Harris 2020 if You Want to Kill the Republic
It's a  social distancing Friday night at the drive thru.  Saving the #COVID19 spreading to the 18 to 29 Biden voters.  I have #Royals &amp;  to watch.
I had heard or read that she was Obama‚Äôs choice and that Biden wanted governor Whitmer from Michigan
The ONLY President to do this. And the only candidate for President who didn‚Äôt become a multi-millionaire as a career politician and crony foreign deals like Joe Biden did.  Biden has been in government for nearly 50 years. FIFTY.
Your argument also applies to Obama/Biden replacing previously lost jobs, not creating them.
I‚Äôm a white person without a collage degree and I would walk barefoot through broken glass to cast my vote for Biden. It doesn‚Äôt take a collage degree to despise a lying, cheating evil man and his grifter family.
Make it official and hold him in contempt.  People need to start going to jail NOW for what's happening, not "maybe" later if Biden wins.

If Biden is elected, ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt seen nothin yet!!!!‚Äù
Hey King Biden wanna be. .how about NO! #BidenIsARacist
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim Democrats will rig this election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
The thing is, the kind of people who will vote for Biden don't care about tax increases. None of them pay taxes. They're either here illegally or living in their mom's basement.
Stick to sports. The dude got owned by Trump. Not one single reporter asked that question recently. Shannon, if you really are as smart as you are, name five things Biden has done for our country.
People think Biden and Harris are just politicians with a few flaws when in fact they're very awful people who have caused some of the very same problems some people think they will solve for some reason
You cannot be serious? If this Trump Virus wasn‚Äôt as truly serious as it continues to be, your idiotic comment would be laughable. 160,000 + Americans DEAD and counting. If the Biden/Harris Administration was in charge, we all would be better off.   #BidenHarris2020 üíô
C‚Äômon. I answered your question honestly. Man up. The chaos in Seattle okay with you?  Defunding the police sound like a good idea?  Do you support Chicago BLM leaders defending looting calling it reparations? Biden saying we all need to wear masks outside, even in rural Kansas?
Idk anyone who isn‚Äôt voting for Biden, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre out there but they probably wouldn‚Äôt vote anyway
not sure if you answered this question but just curious, if Biden had chosen Tulsi would you have definitely voted for him?
Then maybe, if nothing can be done now, Biden's DOJ will indict Trump. He would be out of office, could be charged, could be impeached. That way he doesn't get to run for president again.
The fact Biden is trying to take credit for this is exactly why he shouldn‚Äôt be president. He tries to take credit for what others have done.
He‚Äôs accusing Biden of HIS approach...so he should be VERY familiar with it.
Harris has the same criminal mind as LBJ.  And she's just as determined as he was to be POTUS. Biden won't last long.
Biden's "black"  VP.   1/2 Tamil, 1/4 white Irish slave-owner, 1/4 mixed white-Jamaican. Biden insults blacks.
And yet there are still more unemployed right now than when President Obama and VP Biden left office. Hmmmmm
Who would you like to see as Attorney General, once Biden-Harris win??
For President?  This time?  Yeah.    I‚Äôm voting for Biden.  Republicans have sold their soul to Trump.  I don‚Äôt feel good about it, and I think Biden‚Äôs corrupt, but it‚Äôs the lesser of 2 evils.  I‚Äôm voting for Marshall in the Senate.  I haven‚Äôt decided between Davids/Adkins.
I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden will have a dog in the White House. Although I agree he probably won‚Äôt want a cow.
Would love to hear your opinion on this. But my hope is that Kamala has changed her mind on CJ considering what has happened this year. We the people need to keep speaking up and put pressure on making change. I think Biden and Kamala are intelligent enough to ‚Äúchange their mind‚Äù
trump vs biden, trumps winning by a landslide üìà
Took me 15 seconds to find, copy, and paste.

Vote for Biden and get this parasite out of the WH.
I love the people who are like  ‚ÄúPLAN: Nov 3 - get Biden and Harris elected.  Nov 4 - push them to be better!‚Äù  Then they provide a laundry list of policies that they would essentially want from a candidate who isn‚Äôt worthless/ACTUALLY progressive. It‚Äôs so sad.
Harris has done more pressers and answered more questions than Biden did since the pandemic started. That's just what I'm looking for in a POTUS - delegation until it's time to stand up and read something my babysitter wrote for me.
The obvious counter to this is the Biden campaign can tweet mugshots of criminals from the Trump administration.

Trump knows he can‚Äôt beat Biden in a fair election, a rigged election or even a fraudulent election. His only hope is to remove Biden from the race. Trump is stirring up the troops.
Prove it with real numbers. I believe that you could say, with all honesty, that your inaction on #COVID19 has killed more in 3 months than Obama/Biden did in 8 years.
Joe Biden LIES.
170,000 people are dead thanks to the incompetence of you and this WH. Do you have nothing else to do? You should be scared of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They will save our country and our democracy. It will take decades to fix what you have destroyed. GFY
So what? Biden is so out of it he hasnt sent his own tweet in ages.
All those things you said about Biden were.....  Just politics?
You all miss the point here.  The Pence(anti-glbt)  loving supporter whos openly gay is questioning Biden as a possible homophobe. The hypocrisy here is ridiculous &amp; reveals his loyalty to the political party is way more relevant to him than his concern for glbt rights.
Kamala has the criminal mind of LBJ and she wants the presidency just as much as he did.  So Joe Biden will not last long.
Kamala has no integrity.  Neither does Tara Reade,  who has stated that she is still going to vote for Biden
Kamala has the same criminal mind as LBJ and she wants the presidency just as much as LBJ did. Joe Biden knows that he is just a temporary placeholder for Kamala.  George Soros has picked Kamala.
George Soros has picked her to be the next POTUS. He‚Äôs ordered his son Alex and all his open society foundation‚Äòs to get her into office. Biden is her place holder.
Yes, The latest orders of George Soros.  He‚Äôs now put his son Alex and all of his ‚Äúopen society‚Äù foundation ordered to support her and make her POTUS. Joe Biden knows he is just her temporary placeholder.
Kamala has no integrity. What do you expect????  She wants to be POTOS and has the same criminal mind as LBJ.  Biden won‚Äôt last long, he‚Äôs her place holder.
Yep.  We‚Äôve got another LBJ here.  Lbj got together with Hoover and they took out JFK.  Joe Biden won‚Äôt last long.

I think that this mother will vote for Biden/Harris....
She plans to get rid of Biden and become POTUS.  Willie said 8/11/20:  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll work her backside off for Biden‚Äù.  He deliberately said ‚Äúbackside‚Äù.
All your disparaging comments are falling on deaf ears.  We are thrilled with a Joe Biden Kamala Harris ticket. #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
Watch rude Kamala attack Joe Biden.    For Joe now to choose her as his VP tells me that Joe lacks self-respect....
You do realize that people see Trump almost every day make up something out of thin air, lie, do nothing with Covid, spin conspiracy theories, etc and in the middle of the worst pandemic we've seen in generations, I think Biden will have enough material to hold his own.

100% agree. RCV would change thing dramatically. I wouldn‚Äôt mind putting Biden as my 2nd choice. I think RCV is possible down the road. We just need greater dem presence in the state legislature
A mean, nasty Liar.   Biden should lose millions of votes for choosing her. I think he wants to lose.
Duh, Biden has dementia but I actually wanted Kamala as President from the jump

Hmmm. Interesting, that would do very little unless Biden were to put that money into title 1 and change the formula of school wide funding to targeted funding. I am sure that plan also has very little to do with CTE in minority districts. Throwing money doesn‚Äôt create solutions

How long until Biden and Harris say, "We need to move on and not live in the past" when asked why charges not happening with Trump.
Still amazed that Biden was appointed by the DNC and we all pretend and go forward like it never happened.

Have Biden take one. Trump already has.
Even Democratic voters said so too!
So every one of these voters need to have the FBI called on them to Karen?
Yep. As this happens more and more people will tune it out. Biden should fade to background and let her take this. America will have to get used to a mature response instead of our kindergarten teacher.
Face reality. Joe Biden is more than likely is going to be a one term president. And some of those think Joe won‚Äôt even make it through his first term. Face the facts.
I mean she‚Äôs right. His cognitive health isn‚Äôt the best. Almost 50 percent of voters believe Biden won‚Äôt make it through his first term. He is going to be more than likely a one term president.
Pretty clear a current terrorist organization in the United States supports Biden

Hillary shot herself in the foot by not campaigning in Wisconsin Michigan and PA. And it could cost Biden too if Trump makes up ground, which appears he is starting to a bit.
Pretty clear with Biden being not able to speak without a teleprompter, and the debate being Trump, Biden, and the moderator, that these debates need to be on PPV!
Everyone is afraid of trump but not realizing that the neoliberal Democratic policies pushed ppl to vote for Trump. Biden isn‚Äôt as disliked as Hillary but he also has 0 excitement behind him.
Fuck nudes send your vote for Harris/Biden
Watch to see what the tone of the reporters is for the Biden/Harris Press Conference.  I'll bet it is a liberal media "love in" totally unlike the treatment of President Trump.
Read This: "Chris Wallace: Trump Wishes Biden Had Picked Anyone But Kamala Harris"
But that‚Äôs the point...voting means you CAN complain. Bc you cast your vote and are not seeing change. Get involved with your local government! Keep talking about it. Bc in this country you have that right. Yeah Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt great...but rn we just need better. (1/2)
Biden looks like most Republicans in the house, old white dude???
As Conway calls on Harris to define her stance on late term abortion, the Biden campaign goes silent. It will be great to see her lie her wiggle out of this and other questions because Kamattress is a confirmed liar.
I agree with you 100 percent. No politician is going to be perfect.  My hope is that Kamala and Biden will listen to the people. Biden choosing Kamala proves he‚Äôs willing to put differences aside for the good of America.  We the people need to give them a chance to bring change.
Biden has been in office forever and only done bad things
(Polling isn‚Äôt everything but)  I don‚Äôt think y‚Äôall realize how big of a deal it is that Trump is only 7 points behind Biden in Kansas. Hillary lost Kansas by TWENTY-ONE points in 2016. If we keep trending in this direction, Kansas could go blue (!) in 2024.
You can criticize Kamala Harris without being sexist or racist.  You can also criticize her while planning to vote for her.  You can also criticize her and not attack her with sexism or racism.  Joe Biden is a putz tho.

Anyone else get the feeling the GOP is adding him to the ballots to take away from Biden getting more votes, like how KS GOP added Bob Hamilton to the primary to steal votes from Kobach (helps Dem win)? I feel like they're leaning heavily into this now that Harris is the VP nom.
If Biden wins we lose.

Just the way I like it out in the open. Biden/Harris operate the same in the system but speak in covert ways to gain favor with certain communities but have the same goal as Trump.
If asked, I wonder if Trump would say ‚ÄúMary Magellan.‚Äù  Biden: ‚ÄúLove your God. Love your neighbor.‚Äù  Trump: ‚ÄúI loved my neighbor- she became my 2nd wife!‚Äù
Take it to the extreme of every vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump...but at this point, it is what it is. Vote 3rd party for Congress. We putting Biden/Harris on a count down as soon as they are in office. Like...better act like yall know
And all of this, although troubling, is still not as as bad as the slippery slope to fascism we‚Äôre riding. We have a clear choice before us-only one destroys the US. We have the luxury of looking at these things after Trump &amp; his cronies are out.  For now, I‚Äôll vote Biden/Harris.
Maybe it‚Äôs just me &amp; maybe I‚Äôm a little off, but even if that were true, it creeps me out &lt; Pence‚Äôs over the top evangelical bit.  (Shrug).  Either way, I still think both she &amp; Pence are far better human beings from what I‚Äôve seen than Trump or Biden.  But that‚Äôs a low bar.

Introduction of a 3rd party isn't realistic at this juncture. Getting Cheeto Jesus and his corrupt asshats out of office is vital to America at this point. We can then put Biden/Harris on a timer. I will vote 3rd party, have before in local elections, just not right now.
Great vote for her in 4 years...right now isn't the time. Every single vote not for Biden/Harris is a vote for Trump. There was enough people that choose not to vote last election to put him into office...people already on the same, I don't like either candidates.

I‚Äôm excited for Kamala as the VP pick.   I also hope Biden finds a way to include more women in his cabinet. Let‚Äôs get Warren in there. Susan Rice and Amy Klobuchar, too.   It‚Äôs time to let women run this country for a while.
#ohLiz  I'm old enough to remember when candidates ran on their records, not trying to blame opponents for stuff going on NOW, under their watch, especially Biden who's not currently in office or Harris for stuff not in her state! The Gop seems very scared!
2. The report reminds that the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy and its precedent, both include highly conditional language committing the USG to restrain arms sales only on the basis of knowledge of intent. A Biden admin should make a much harder commitment.

We've seen multiple stories depicting Harris, and the Biden-Harris ticket as moderate and centrist. Which is absurd. Show me ONE piece of Harris' platform that was moderate or centrist. But the media will work hard to portray the ticket as such. And it will work. 5/
The voters splintered into groups both to the left and the right of mainstream liberalism / establishment DEMs. The progressive activist wing gravitated towards Bernie and Warren. The bulk of DEM voters gravitated towards Biden (the only option NOT in the progressive lane). 3/

America believe the women who Biden raped. Why doesn't the Fake News do something?
This "logic" also means voting third-party is a vote for Biden because it's not for Trump.  Scream at Biden to offer something to vote for other than "I'm not the other guy".  Try M4A, I hear it's the bee's knees.
I find the "only privileged people won't vote for Biden" arguments infuriating, because my number one concern with Biden winning is that the lot of you will seize the opportunity to stop caring about politics.

Biden believed that it did not make up the majority of the party, and continued to run as an old school liberal. Did not embrace #M4A for instance. And I continue to believe that he's right, and that this is why he won the nomination. 4/
People like Biden and Pelosi used to represent the leftwing of the DEM party. I describe them now as old school liberals. There was always a more extreme group further left, but they were largely ignored by the party and the media. 2/
That‚Äôs not what I said. For clarification I‚Äôd estimate about 20% on the far right and 20% on far left engage in this behavior. I know plenty of good people who voted for Trump. And plenty who will vote Biden.
This is what Congress should have been doing (minus the specifics in #3-4) for Trump's entire term. Who knows how many daily Teapot Dome-level scandals they could have uncovered by now?  That impeachment was over a phone call about Hunter Biden, and not this, was negligence.
If the DEMs win the Senate, there will absolutely be pressure to nuke the filibuster. I've tweeted this before. I think it would be shortsighted and a terrible mistake. And I'm not sure where Biden is on the issue.  I don't think they'll really expand the court. I could be wrong.
Correct. Though she certainly never came across well trying to be a hardcore progressive either. Progressives certainly didn't buy it. I suspect she's pretty much inline with Biden philosophically.
I largely agree with you. Biden is not a moderate. He's just more moderate than the rest of the field. I've repeatedly described him as an old school liberal.  I'm just hoping that being a former legislator he understands the need for the filibuster. Has he been asked about this?
OMG another lie. Show us EXACTLY where Trump said he'd defund Social Security if reelected.  Team Biden has so many legit areas to take on Trump, but I've seen MULTIPLE lies coming from their accounts this week. BE BETTER THAN THIS!
The DEM party has basically split into three groups: moderates (yes some exist), liberals and the progressive / activist wing. Basically every candidate but Joe ran in the progressive lane. Biden was only available choice for libs and moderates. IMO
Clyburn certainly helped Biden in SC, but Biden was always going to win SC. I was still predicting that Biden would win the nomination (before SC) after not doing well in Iowa and NH.
So who represents the 80% of blacks better who still support the police: Biden/Harris or the activist wing who want to defund the police?  This is why Biden won the nomination. He understood where the base REALLY stands. 3/end
The activist wing of  continue to believe that they are the base of the party. They are not. Biden won the nomination largely because he understood that the party voters are NOT as progressive as the activist wing. 1/
While I almost certainly won't vote for Biden, I think it's folly to write off anybody legitimately interested in building a conservative, center-right future in America solely based on a single vote.
Biden has all but stated that he doesn't want progressives.  He wants moderate Dems and non-Trump Republicans.  Why don't you go after the undecided voters and convince them to vote Biden?    Biden isn't giving us anything and we're not giving him our vote.

But what worries me the most is that the Durham investigation findings will be used by Trump to invalidate some or all of the election results (by connecting the findings to allegations of fraud by Biden in 2020). I know that sounds paranoid, but I don't just Trump at all.
The media is going to be so busy covering what Kamala says that they're going to ignore that Biden isn't doing much, aren't they?
She knows this is NOT an answerable question. NOBODY IN THE WORLD knows the answer to this question. OMG she's going to make me regret my tweets saying she was the right choice for Biden. SMDH
Senator Harris said she believes the Women who said they were Raped by Biden. Print that because that is that's the Truth.
When Obama blames Biden for Obamagate America will get it's proof.
One thing that Warren really brought to the table was a clear anti-corruption vision. It would be good to see Biden and Harris make this is a priority. It could have important long-term effects and is good politics for creating a contrast w/ Trump.
Biden is remembering CARTER?
I'm 99% sure of two October surprises: a vaccine announcement (even if it's not really ready) and the Durham Investigation. I could see a 5-10% surge for Trump from those. Combine that with voter suppression and other surprises and I don't feel that Biden's lead is near safe.
I've never been an enormous Biden fan. But governing is a skill that Trump seems allergic to. Unlike many conservatives, I feel that our gov't institutions are very important. And the damage done to the Dep't of State, EPA, USPS, etc. might take decades to recover from.

Kamala Harris has a full endorsement of the largest abortion provider in the United States.
What about the sex claims of the women that work for Biden?
BREAKING NEWS! Senator Harris has received information from all the 10 Women who Presidential Candidate Joe Biden had sexual relations with in his office in Washington DC over the past 12 years. He is reported to be having a National Press Conference in the next few hours.
The context is, M4A gets passed, except it has to be a perfect bill that doesn‚Äôt raise taxes more than a public option (spoiler it won‚Äôt) and then Biden vetoes it lmao that is such a bad faith ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù response to the reality of what M4A is.
So Biden is using the Black woman. Shame on the sex offender Senator Harris claims she believes more than Biden's bull shit stories.
The whole playbook of the right is to say "leftists/liberals LOVE this" because their fanbase will then go "OH. So I will oppose that! I won't support that shit!"  That is why they are saying Harris and Biden are radical leftists. Not because they believe it.

I mean I‚Äôm still voting Biden, I‚Äôm just pissed off about it.
I will wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support Kamala Harris as the VP candidate. But a little piece of me still wishes Biden picked Duckworth. She doesn't mince words.
For me the biggest factor is biden at least has 2 trillion dollar climate plan whereas trump is actively cutting funding for environmental protections. Plus if trump replaces RBG, there is a very high possibility Roe v Wade will be overturned.
Trumpists: Biden isn't Catholic. Harris isn't African-American.  But it's liberals who are obsessed with identity politics.
‚ÄúDefending the constitution‚Äù üôÑ. In the debates she was asked about gun control and said she would use executive order to bypass congress and ban all firearms. Biden said you can‚Äôt just go over the constitution. She rolled her eyes, laughed, and said yes we can.

I made the point in 2016 that we should all have a minimum threshold of what we're willing to vote for. And for me, both Trump and Hillary were below that threshold. I voted third party.  I have to admit Biden isn't far above that threshold, but he is at the moment. Barely.

No Hillary will soon be VP when Biden dies and Harris picks Hillary as VP. And You know what happens when Hillary wants something. Poor Harris is a goner too.
Correct. None of us have ANY idea what Rice's underlying policy preferences would be if she were POTUS. And while Harris ran as a progressive, she didn't do so convincingly. She's probably MORE inline with Biden / old school liberalism.
Moderate to liberal. I think that's the problem virtually every DEM candidate had. Biden was the ONLY one who understood that the party's voters were NOT as far left as the activist wing. I tweeted repeatedly that Harris and Booker were running in the wrong lane.
You must be a bot because you follow people who share similar interests and viewpoints as you.  Might we suggest you slow down and accept your slow death via the Biden/Harris ticket? - Twitter, probably
Biden is the guy that will soon die and Harris and BLM will have their way.

Anyone who is not a Marxist is now a centrist. üòÇüòÇ  The goal post shifting is nuts. Biden is an old school liberal. They keep calling him a moderate. He's not. Harris is harder to pin down. She ran as a progressive but didn't sell it well. I tend to believe she's just liberal.
Harris said she believes the sex charges against Biden are true.
Call them what they are. These racists weren't voting for Biden anyway.
Harris said she believes the Sexual Charges against Biden are True. Now what.
Interesting that Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon w/ no experience in housing policy, was the only African-American appointed in Trump's cabinet, as the Secretary of HUD.  And now, Corey Booker is the 1st name that Trump thinks of for Biden's public housing Secretary. ü§î

. one of our Vice Presidential experts, lends a hand to    You have to win first: What Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris tells us about Biden  via
I'm already tired of #HotTakeTwitter over Biden's pick of Harris for VP.
&lt;shrug&gt; Biden was never going to excite the left wing extremists. Many of them don't vote anyway. Vast majority of DEMs, moderate and liberal, will unite just fine behind this ticket. And this ticket won't scare moderate independent / swing state voters. It's the right pick.
To all the people tweeting that Harris will hurt Biden with blacks because of her past as a prosecutor, you're wrong.  Hillary beat Trump 89-8 with the black vote. Biden is likely to do better than this.
She‚Äôs a fake progressive. Warren would have motivated right wing voters WAY more than Harris will. The left will fall in line behind Biden-Harris just fine.
The left will fall in line behind Biden-Harris. Don‚Äôt pretend otherwise.
Yep. Biden basically needs to prove he‚Äôs still relatively competent. If he does that, I think he pretty much cruises to victory. Biden refusing to debate would look terrible.
Hey y‚Äôall. There was no perfect VP choice. There never is. Just like there‚Äôs no perfect presidential nominee. While I would have personally preferred Amy K, Harris is absolutely a competent pick IMO.   Biden risked losing my vote if he‚Äôd chosen Warren, Abrams or Rice.
And the fact that she has the experience and is qualified to run the country if something should happen to Biden.
Good grief, I cannot comprehend thinking Trump is a better choice than anyone, let alone better than Biden/Harris.
With Biden in power I‚Äôm afraid Dems will feel like they don‚Äôt have to pander towards progressives and become more of a right wing political party than they already are
Idk I ultimately seem both as two sides of the same coin. Harris is her own issue with her constant harassment of Black communities and withholding evidence that can overturn convictions. I‚Äôd rather have Biden since he‚Äôs just racist and not dangerous and racist but...
NYTimes: Kamala Harris Is the Future, So Mike Pence May Well Be History Kamala Harris Is the Future, So Mike Pence May Well Be History
idea: we just put Trump and Biden into a boxing ring, no groin strikes, 12-6 elbows, eye gouging, throttle choking, or forfeit from exhaustion. last one standing wins president. Biden will forget why he‚Äôs there by the first round, and Trump will be out of breath by the same time
‚ÄúBaal, Bombs and Biden‚Äù doesn‚Äôt either.  Just to make sure we are leaving the other side of the Empire out.
The Progressives &amp; Warren supporters have as yet no way of knowing the details of  Biden/Harris/DNC platform. Therefore, it's illogical &amp; immature to assume that platform hasn't been influenced &amp; informed by other perspectives.
People don‚Äôt have a legit reason to joe Biden, they just voting out of hatred ! They can‚Äôt name one policy joe Biden is going for ü§£ü§£ü§£
Proof joe Biden a racist and kamala running with him üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Harris  said she believed the sexual accusers, Not Biden
Nope just facts of the matter. Just like how Trump's accusers never came out until 2016, after he ran for president, whilst Tara Reid's accusations date back to the 90's when she worked under Biden.
Reid, her ex-huband, her mother, and her friends attest she is talking about Biden, but "common sense" says they are talking about a different staffer. Delusion.
So Reid herself, her ex, and her friends attest that she's talking about Biden but you, random twitter user, know that she's ACTUALLY talking about a different staffer in his office. I see.
When Pete was in Delaware a couple of days ago, there were reports that Biden was likely to make him the White House Chief of Staff.
In March 25, 1996, Tara Reade‚Äôs then husband filed a court declaration which stated that Tara Reade had told him in 1993 that she was being sexually harassed while working in the office of Senator Joe Biden.  1996.
Joe Biden sexually assaulted Tara Reid in 1993. Corroborated by Her Friends. Corroborated by Her Mother. Corroborated by Her Ex-Husband.
Eh, but Biden and Kamala are literally neoliberals. That‚Äôs their political description. They won‚Äôt go further left unless it threatens their ability to maintain power. In fact, expect the opposite over the next few months. We did this in 2016.
Fuck Biden, Kamala, Trump, and Pence. All them crackers sucks n ain't none of em gonna do shit to help me...  #JustAnotherDayInAmericaGettinFucked #TakeAnotherBiteOfTheShitSandwichCalledLife

Neither Harris nor Biden support true single payer universal healthcare. Which at this point is the bottom bar for true progressive politics. So yay for four years of ineffective fake progressive politics from the moderate democrats.

Less than 6 months ago you wanted Americans to believe Joe Biden was a racist . You emphasized it over and over ‚Äî what has changed ? Is he still a racist ?or does that drop since he chose you ? Do you have standards ?

The Biden ticket to #BLM supporters
I just wanna know if you're supporting the Biden/Harris ticket, or or are you going to sit this one out, since your girl ain't homecoming queen!
Biden should also announce his short lists for top cabinet posts, starting with Attorney General and Secretary of State, to demonstrate that he will nominate consummate professionals, unlike the current slate of sycophants and toadies.
People who openly defend Biden , are pieces of shit ! And like pedos
I'm not a huge Biden fan, but I've always felt that his empathy and emotion were genuine (unlike Bill Clinton's).
Unless Biden is dead, he will run for re-election in 2024.
I thought the news was just wrong - she had never followed Biden. Was the reporting actual right that she unfollowed him?
Half the Country: #ACAB   Joe Biden:
"what about the other two percent, doc" oh they are making fun of joe biden's vp pick
Are you attracted to women? Would you date an attractive woman if she's not your daughter? Is that weird to you? Must be lonely to be you. Literally the worst things you can come up with are some words. There's videos of Biden groping CHILDREN. Enough said.
Both Harris and Biden have acknowledged the mistaken ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù approach of the early 90s. As DA, Harris routinely reduced pot cases to misdemeanors, did not prosecute juvenile sex workers, and was considered the most progressive DA around by public defenders.
It's always a strawman. There's no videos of Trump fondling anyone. I really don't care what you say or how you feel. I've seen the pictures you're talking about and I've seen the videos of Biden. It's clear to me. Apparently not to you.
Full of hope for women in America. I am so happy that Biden‚Äôs pick of Kamala has reignited that hope again.
Yeah we all know Democrats love to flip flop every 14 months thanks for sharing. The videos of Biden groping kids is enough for me thanks.
I thought we were doing a folksy Biden routine.
I hope we have all the film from the primary debates archived between Kamala and Biden.   ‚òïÔ∏è
So what?  Lots of former rivals make good teams. Indeed, Harris on crime probably ends up being an asset for Biden.
Excited AF that  Kamala Harris is  Biden‚Äôs VP pick!!! #shesafighter #shesambitious #MVP #ivegotherback #KamalaHarrisForVP #kamala

Been telling you for months:  1 - They most likely won't play college football this fall  2 - Biden would pick Harris for VP
Very glad the Dems, during historic anti-police protests, have decided to run ‚Äútop cop‚Äù Kamala and author of the Crime Bill Biden on the same ticket.
I'm on the phone w/ the Biden campaign right now. This public declaration of Kamala Harris as Biden's running mate has complicated my VP nomination.
Doesn't matter what the GOP says against her. This pick just further secured the majority of female, African-American, and minority votes for Biden. It was a smart pick and the right pick, IMO.
Never forget their were actual candidates with actual platforms but instead the DNC chose to rally behind Biden.
Between this and The Biden/Harris announcement I think I need to go back to bed.
Look I wanted Liz Warren to be the nominee but I understand why she isn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm fine with it  Every ounce of energy has to go in to making sure that Biden and Harris win this thing. Otherwise the country might not exist in 4 years

of course joe biden picked kamala, he had to cancel out his pick being a black woman with the fact that she‚Äôs a cop ! üòå
Biden picking Kamala Harris is a BIG F U to all progressives in the country. It just shows how tone deaf he is
LFG   Biden and Harris
Why have Democrats picked such bad and/or boring VPs?  Kaine Biden Edwards Lieberman Gore Bentsen Ferraro Mondale  Ferraro was the only bold choice. Biden might be the first one of the group to actually succeed after their VP nomination.

Really? I've never heard that theory. I've been really upset about Trump's mocking of Biden's speech impediment. If Trump has a reading disability, I would definitely lay off of criticizing things in that area.
Got some inside information about Biden's VP pick.  It's me.  After my tweets yesterday about tampons, Biden said that I had become the clear favorite.
Cardi B is essentially a campaign surrogate for Joe Biden.   I made the mistake of googling WAP.   Each day we stray further from God's light.
Biden's VP pick is the main character in what you're writing now: we good, or totally screwed?
It's been Biden's pandering and public comments that has made this such a public and rotten process. He should have said this one thing: "We will pick the best and most qualified person to be vice president."    created this problem.
Biden‚Äôs going with his heart, Susan Rice will be the vp pick #VPPick #2020Election #Veepstakes
I'm sure the republican spin machine will make it look like Biden isn't capable of being president and everyone will pretend like he's sundowning more than the current president.
OK Biden Who is your Black VP choice going to say took the Goods? Was it Reparations ?
I don't see Biden dying or resigning but I do see Trump stealing the election again.
Biden is also stupid.
Hillary was the MOST PREPARED NOMINEE in history and can‚Äôt even get a VP call from Biden!
How is he responsible job losses? Because it was recommended to shut the economy down by scientists? He is responsible for people getting sick? The GDP drop because of the shutdown?  President "China is Ok" Biden, no shutdown and we would have jobs? BTW, where were jobs when VP?
If Biden said this, it would get 20 minutes each hour on Fox.
It‚Äôs easy to forget the public polling has a watchdog purpose. If the polls have Biden by +6 in a state and they perform consistently across the country, and somehow Trump wins that state by +1: big red flag üö©
Seriously. I refuse to believe that  doesn‚Äôt know who Biden chooses in the finale.
Ok #BachelorNation I can‚Äôt wait any longer to see who Biden has picked as his running mate. I think it‚Äôs time for you to put your sleuthing skills to use.
I can picture it now. Biden introduces Pete, says he fills the campaign's need to improve his polling among young people who have "high hopes" for the future.  Haha gonna light myself on fire.
That would have been too bright. Give Sanders a do nothing job that placates most of his followers but also because of his age guarantees he can't succeed Biden or pick Biden's successor.
Counterpoint: It's Joe Biden.
We‚Äôre only three months away from Election Day and this mf‚Äôer still doesn‚Äôt have a declared VP. Hope the people in states who primary votes actually mattered are feeling like idiots. The only thing that gonna cost Biden the win is himself and a half-baked campaign team.
Lol sounds like Fox News talking about biden
I am voting for Biden. ‚ù§Ô∏è
We need to call debates right now.   Keep the momentum going, and keep Biden on his heels.   After huge EOs helping the middle class its time to get some Biden vs Trump prizefight airtime.   Invite Ye too.
Were is the Biden VP?
Sigh.  In 2016 Hillary beat Trump 89-8 among black voters.  What's your prediction for Trump's share of the black vote in 2020? Biden is more popular among blacks than Hillary was.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ  That's not remotely believable. They're just trying to tamp down criticism of Biden's eventual VP pick.
I‚Äôm so tired of going on Facebook and seeing conservatives label Joe Biden as a socialist, it‚Äôs offensive to socialists and leftists every where
Why don‚Äôt you ask the black community what they think about Biden‚Äôs gaffes? (Spoiler alert: they don‚Äôt give a sh*t because trump is a clear and present danger to the country.)
I didn‚Äôt see this in the US papers - a pretty strong statement on nuclear disarmament.

Would you be willing to commit, right now, to calling bullshit on the hordes of republicans that will immediately bask in the sacredness of the constitution if Biden is elected? They are going to offer you lots of power in exchange for keeping your mouth shut.
We will just have to disagree agree on this. Because yes people should give to the candidates not them BUT until Trump is out of office I will take their help. I‚Äôm under no allusion that they will continue to be on our side November 4 if Biden wins.
Except it was. It seems the headline is changed but the same thing is in the piece.
And Biden? HA.. HA HA HA Ha. What did I .....say..????
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Joe Biden seems determined to screw up his lead.  What is wrong with leadership.    Stop making jokes, Joe.  You're hurting your own campaign!
Traditionally this is true. This is the first time that for me, it will matter. I won‚Äôt vote Trump. And since I think it‚Äôs possible Biden won‚Äôt last the term, his VP choice matters to me.
Biden gets elected, turns the presidency over to a minority woman, she gets voted out next election, we are all racist and sexists again.
BREAKING: Biden has not chosen me as his running mate.
Biden is riding a bike. How about we skip the debates and have a Trump-Biden bike race?
I'm from WI &amp; I live in KS.  We want  to take votes from Biden &amp; Trump.  If your candidate is so solid, why not #LetHerSpeak?
Biden has known for a while who he‚Äôs going to pick. It‚Äôs just that his advisors don‚Äôt like her and keep pushing for alternatives.
You know what? Somebody on Biden's staff crafts these tweets, and that's GOOD, because Biden will surround himself with a staff that is GOOD.
And this is exactly why Biden should not debate a pathological liar, because Biden would end up having to defend himself against absolute nonsense.  To paraphrase the adage, never debate a lying fool, because, in the end, one won‚Äôt be able to tell who is who.
Here is what Biden should do: hold a press conference at the same hour every day to 1) identify and play a clip of the lies told by the president the previous day; 2) then the tell the real, evidence-based facts.
Tell us how you really feel Joe Biden!  via
All due respect, AND let me be 100% CRYSTAL CLEAR you are DUE ZERO respect, you are A TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD human. YOU BREATHE IN LIES. YOU EXHALE LIES. Joe Biden could be in a coma w/HALF of his BRAIN missing, he'd STILL BE MORE QUALIFIED THAN YOU TO BE POTUS!!!
Biden already had my vote, but now he can destroy God? Sign me the fuck up.
The key difference is only one campaign demonstratively worked with a foreign government to gather illegally obtained information against an opponent. The other is Biden.
So you acknowledge this isn‚Äôt Team Biden?
And now he says that Portland is the "radical left's" "roadmap for America." He says the radical left will turn the country into Portland if Biden is elected.
Who is dumping?   If I were high level on Biden campaign I might be self dumping to get reactions and start inoculating the press a bit.
Biden has pandered endlessly (in particular about narrowing his search only to women of color). Then they basically trotted them at one at a time (testing the waters) to get them shredded and exposed. What a terrible way to pick your VP.

idk man Biden has appeared confused and delivered constant gaffes and it hasn't seemed to matter so far...
The presidential debates are terrifying; the cards are stacked against Biden. He must NOT ONCE appear confused or have a verbal gaffe. Trump can continue to display his constant inability to comprehend words or speak coherently and that's just Trump?
Is Biden gaffe-prone and says foolish, entitled crap? Yup. I read his Latinos comment as Dems taking black voters for granted. Should he be much more careful? Yup. Does perniciously racist, &amp; hate-mongering, privileged current president have any grounds to criticize Biden?! NO!
Okay. Two tweets. I‚Äôm a bad patient. The poll also shows Trump up 50-43 over Biden. And Trump only +3 on job approval in KS (48-45). All in the ballpark of the limited polling we‚Äôve seen so far this year in KS. We‚Äôll be a Trump state, but maybe not as strongly as 2016, I‚Äôd bet.

Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
1) remember, even though he's going to get it, Biden ISN'T officially the Dem nominee yet 2) voting NO to the platform =/= she supports Tr*mp, you idiots. The platform does not include med4all which a majority of Dem voters want. She's actually voting in line FOR the people.
Of course not bc he's mentally ill...and that's exactly why the PREDATORS, i.e. Jared Kushner and Trump r pouncing on him bc they believe he can STEAL a good percentage of the Black votes away from Biden/Harris in key states.  I mean...I'm not Sherlock Holmes but seems logical.üßê
I just had a thought, maybe a premonition that when Biden wins, Trump supporters are going to riot by setting fire to USPS postal vehicles.

You are confusing ‚Äúdictator‚Äù and ‚Äúconservative‚Äù. They aren‚Äôt the same.  Trump has added a massive amount to our deficit (11.5 Trillion), has introduced protectionist trade policies, undermined the rule of law and spent 3 years picking winners and losers. Biden won‚Äôt do that.

before, everyone was writing Biden off since he hadn't won a single primary yet. The centrists banded together in a way they didn't with the Republicans, where it was divided, the opposite happened there in 2016.
I don't know how Biden is seriously flawed unless its being a traditional politician with lots of experience. Buttigieg, Koblachar et al jumped to Biden's aisle bf Super Tuesday, Sanders supporters were very mad about that one. But Biden's unexpected win in Carolina got it going
You go Biden take out the orange faced liar....
I think bc Biden is much more widely liked. + plenty of people didn‚Äôt vote or voted for Trump bc they didn‚Äôt think he would be as bad as he has turned out to be. I expected the worst and he surpassed that. My dad has never voted for a Dem in his 70 years and he‚Äôs voting for Biden
We get Biden and ppl will still protest bc we  SHOULD. Four more years of the Orange Cyst and we‚Äôre all good as dead. But I‚Äôm not going down quietly. Shame that you are.
That's because Biden does not cater to the 1%

You're asking #Biden to assume the responsibilities of president before he's elected. Or, are you conceding that he is de facto president and 45 should vacate the office?
They don‚Äôt because it‚Äôs you. Awful person, awful performance in the job, awful agenda constantly lying, bullying and attacking people. People don‚Äôt like you. The press doesn‚Äôt you or your failed presidency nor your cheating to steal another election. Biden is the opposite of you.

But a biden presidency congeals the unification of democrats with Bush Republicans, and results in liberals then defending all those hideous trump policies when biden just continues them.
That's funny. Buy me a Punch Presidente Maduro when Biden wins.

If biden wants to actually oppose trump policies and push for good things instead, I'm all ears. But he's very clearly not interested in that.
That, ultimately, is the problem. Biden doesn't actually represent stopping trump policies at all. He represents getting liberals to support trump policies at 60% power. I'd rather then keep opposing fascism instead of being partially invested in it.
Trouble is, biden has made it clear that not only will he not punish any of those trump people if he gets in office, he's likely to generally sustain all of trump's policies. He literally said he's going to make most of the trump tax cuts permanent!
Biden will save the Post Office. Republicans are dead meat. This party is so fucked up. I hope they all rot in hell. Especially Pedophile Gym Jordan I am really pissed off. Hate that party.

BIDEN &amp; DEMOCRATS WANTING CRIME AND EVEN MURDER IN ORDER TO DEFEAT REPUBLICANS IN NOVEMBER.  DEMOCRATS SEEM TO WANT TO TURN CITIES INTO WARZONE.  THEY WANT CRIME AND MURDER.    BIDEN WANTS TO CHANGE POLICE FUNDS, HE HAS A FUND THAT GETS RIOTERS OUT OF JAIL.
Is that the best that you have Pence? Biden and Harris will take away red meat when they are elected. No wonder Trump‚Äôs rigging the election (Putin, post office, birther conspiracies).Believe me, it‚Äôs not going to happen. You are out. Becky
And Clinton says she would be willing to serve in a Biden administration...as the President when they put Joe in the home. #KillarysBack #Trump2020
A ‚Äúselfless leader‚Äù huh? Interesting to hear considering earlier this year Kamala said she believed the women who accused Joe Biden of sexual assault and rape. This party is bought and paid for more than creepy Joe‚Äôs son.
BIDEN &amp; DEMOCRATS WANTING CRIME AND EVEN MURDER IN ORDER TO DEFEAT REPUBLICANS IN NOVEMBER.  DEMOCRATS SEEM TO WANT TO TURN CITIES INTO WARZONE.  THEY WANT CRIME AND MURDER.  BIDEN WANTS TO MISMANDLE POLICE FUNDS.  HAS A FUND USED TO GET RIOTERS OUT OF JAIL.
Did Biden serve?
lets watch trumps train go by using coal to continue ruin the atmosphere because he doesn‚Äôt care at all about Mother Earth. Then let‚Äôs watch Biden put all his power into MAN POWER to get any where he wants. #biden2020
Vote Biden/Harris unless you‚Äôre in a sure-thing blue state. And hold them accountable for their despicable bullshit.
There‚Äôs a lot of groups who have room to criticize Biden bumbling like an idiot and Trump supporters are not one üòÇ y‚Äôall have the King idiot please pipe down
There are so many "progressives" with Stockholm Syndrome over the two party system to the point where they repeat their political fanfiction as if its fact   We couldn't push Obama to the left, and Joe Biden is to his RIGHT
Those people aren't Biden voters anyway.
Adding to a long list of exs in which he manipulates faith for pol gain the¬†pres‚Äôs rant in Ohio¬†last Thurs also undermined yet another sec of the Constitution ‚Äî¬†Article 6, Section 3¬†‚Äî which quite specifically states that there is no relig test for office.
This is in contrast to the Obama's and Clintons" and Biden's who all saw their net worth sky rocket.  One works for you and the rest for themselves and their cronies.
Biden, Harris blasted by mainstream media for not taking questions from reporters
Vox says Biden is 'moving left' with Harris on ticket despite media calling her 'moderate'
Biden lies about what Trump says, makes it the centerpiece of his campaign, and you can‚Äôt see who is creating racial division in pursuit of power? Instead, you suggest someone you don‚Äôt know is racist. Cognitive dissonance. More important, Biden hurts America.
We Catholics should be able to explain how our faith informs all of our decisions, including our political ones. Biden's decision to lean in to the discussion, and not to avoid it, will be good for Catholicism, whether or not it is good for the Democrats.
WTF is Pence talking about??? Biden &amp; Harris r now going to ''cut America's meat?" How and where do they come up with this nonsense anyway???üò≥üëá
He won't. Perhaps we should focus our imagination on Biden and Harris taking office in January 2021.üëç
POST OFFICE IS NOT GOING ANY WHERE. TRUMP IS. LET THAT SINK IN. TRUMP IS DONE. TIMING IS EVERYTHING. BIDEN WILL STILL KICK HIS ASS. TRUMP IS GOING BYE BYE.
If and/or when Biden/Harris win in a landslide victory, the Senate will naturally flip.  Then we can finally get things done and Mitch will lose all his power, even if he wins re-election, which I don't feel he will...not even close. The Turtle's time is up too.
Yes, this IS our last stand, James. And WE THE PEOPLE are drawing a line in sand and we chose Biden and Harris on November 3.   Why u ask?üò≥ Bc we've fucking HAD it with this sociopathic LUNATIC.üëá  So, ya know, you've LOST. ‚ö°Ô∏è
Biden looks so ready to take our country back.
America, tell my friend John Fox to vote Biden.
The American people are seeing how frail the Orange ass is. Biden looks vibrant and ready to roll.
That would require senile old Joe to speak without a cue card or teleprompter &amp; we all know that is no longer part of Biden‚Äôs skill set.
Looks like the Democrat‚Äôs get-out-of-Biden-nominee card was to allow him to appoint an ineligible running mate par for the course after all BO was never eligible to serve as POTUS either
I had some steaks in the freezer last night but Joe Biden and Kamala Harris snuck in and stole all my meat.
BREAKING: New FOX poll says that Biden is leading Trump 50 to 36% on who Americans think who would do a better job handling coronavirus.  That's a 14 point lead...which is astounding, considering our ''divisiveness."   Doesn't look like we're that divided any longer.üò≥
Amen üëè And now Biden/Harris üôèüéâ
Conservative Lisa: Barack's Father Was Never a US Citizens = Not a Natural Born US Citizen Disqualifies his Presidency Both Kamala‚Äôs parents were foreign citizens at the time of her birth disqualifying entire Biden/Harris Democrat ticket=Trump WINS vs No DBiden's story makes me love him more. He has such heart. We need him.
My husband was a maga when I met him. Now he near vomits at the memories. He was also a shit person who was hiding a lot of stuff. He‚Äôs voting for Biden in November.
You know Greta, I really don‚Äôt care. I really don‚Äôt care if Biden has a press conference. I really don‚Äôt care if trump has liar sessions. I really don‚Äôt care if trump takes questions, because he just lies anyway. I really don‚Äôt care what you think - you are a trumper.
Yeah the Vermont result was the one that made it seem inevitable that Biden would win, especially Biden winning Virginia by more than Sanders did Vermont.
Keep up the good work President Trump. We will continue to welcome Republicans who are changing there vote to Biden! Love the #LincolnProjectEffect
But baby trump, Biden &amp; Harris are grownups &amp; moved on with their common goals for the good of our country.  you should try it. It‚Äôs what leaders do.
Oof can‚Äôt image that really swaying your choice that much. I‚Äôve been bullied by so many trump supporters, even some Biden supporters. A few people aren‚Äôt the big picture.
I think it‚Äôs that your area was small that you went through &amp; Biden supporters aren‚Äôt nearly as obnoxious as trump supporters. Just realize there isn‚Äôt a silent majority - you all have a shit ton of yard signs.
Please vote for the greater good. Joe Biden wouldn‚Äôt sabotage the USPS for personal political gain especially considering it delays veterans from receiving their mailed medication prescriptions
You have to admit there's better things for him to be speaking about right now than an entire lineup of speeches about Joe Biden's failures, specifically. So many moves from this administration feel like they came directly from the mind of a 13 year old.
Everyone should view this video showing the past history of  Joe Biden continuously lying:
As Biden promises to rein in private prisons, they're throwing money at Republicans  via
Biden outworking dt again...
Trump or Biden. They‚Äôre both trash
What kind of fantasyland do you live in if you think Biden is radical... Biden! Lol
And Kamala called Joe Biden a racist in how she described hium at the debates.
They say trump, Pence, Biden, but not Harris. They also said Barack Hussein Obama.
Hahaha! Really Mike, you think we are that stupid? Come-on-man.   You know what you guys did do? Your sorry actions, caused 165,000 American deaths. A number VP Biden &amp; Pres Obama can‚Äôt match. You are disgusting &amp; sick for even bragging about this with your tremendous failure.
I've noticed, people mostly say trump, Pence, or Biden when referring to those men, so why are they not saying Harris?  Why is tucker say ‚ÄúKamala‚Äù, especially when he doesn‚Äôt know how to pronounce it?
Hahaha how tf did Biden get Kamala to talk about Amtrak in her own speech lol. "Riding the rails"
Hey  - any comment yet on president Trump‚Äôs outright verbal attack on Joe Biden‚Äôs faith - claiming he‚Äôs ‚Äòagainst God‚Äô? Or will you remain the silent coward and not speak out against the attack on faith?  Still waiting to hear from you
In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
Yeah, I laughed when trump said that today. They had that line written from the get-go, no matter Biden's choice. I think trump was drooling for Warren, but so was I - for very different reasons.
This is all on trump. PPE was essential for their lives &amp; he could have gotten it manufactured here, if he cared. He had the power &amp; chose to ignore their needs - our needs too. All those special healthcare providers died, because trump refused to do his job.  Elect Biden/Harris.
She might as well since Biden will be gone
I‚Äôm a little sad, because I wanted you Senator Warren. I will support Biden/Harris, because I know you will.
Dear Humans: Please let‚Äôs all overcome our hateful past and get behind the Biden-Harris ticket. They are who America needs right now!! #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris2020
She doesn‚Äôt fight for the ‚Äúlittle guy‚Äù when that little guy is in the womb. She loves the option of abortion up until birth, fights for Planned Parenthood to the point of breaking the law and covering it up. If any pro life voter votes for Biden, I‚Äôm shocked.
She would've done better if Biden hadn't been in the mix. He had the "juice" because of his association &amp; friendship with Pres. Obama.
Have heard a lot of folks say that as they traveled to stir his from around the country trump signs outnumbered Biden signs 10-1
If you‚Äôd like to learn more about Biden‚Äôs extensive plans, here‚Äôs a link!
A vote for a Biden-Harris ticket is a vote for:  -Making 4-year colleges tuition free for a large majority of students -The reversal of Trumps painful and deceitful immigration laws -A thorough climate plan, with trillions in government funding to get us carbon neutral ASAP
I don't have much to say on Kamala herself but their strategy for picking the VP is so dumb. Like Biden is already centrist as shit, what are they doing trying to appeal to Republicans even more? Can we please just once unite the rest of our party?
This is a great choice, solid ticket  Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as vice president - The Washington Post
Kamala Harris being Joe Biden‚Äôs VP Pick is pretty awesome I would have been happy with her or Elizabeth Warren.
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his running mate
Just as predicted the most corrupt president in American history is pulling out the most corrupt measures to try and get re-elected from sabotaging the USPS and mail-in ballots to more brazenly colluding with Russia to smear Biden &amp; again interfere in our election üò°
Joe Biden can when a debate with Trump even if Joe was anesthetized. Trump vocabulary consists of about 50 words.
Yeah, let Biden do it.
I read a real bad take on Biden and the VP choice (and apparently the slow nature of it). I could only think of you. So I guess you're doing well on the organic marketing of the new book.
Let‚Äôs see a Biden speech
Biden has been working in the system for 50 years and has done nothing to help.  Furthermore, based on his remarks in the past, he doesn‚Äôt want to.
I'd find it much easier to vote for Biden if he'd stop lying again and again and again.
But Joe Biden
Someone tell the Secret Service these guys are stalking Biden.
it isn‚Äôt even Trump vs Biden anymore for me,  it‚Äôs American freedom vs Communist tyranny
At this point I think the presidential debates should consit of all canadates trying to put shapes in the correct hole on those baby toys, because I‚Äôm 90% sure Biden and trump are to incompetent to do so  #LetHerSpeak #LetHerDebate
I‚Äôll feel disappointed but I feel like Biden is a puppet for people who will push him in a direction I agree with. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping for. All I care about is having someone in office who will work harder for the environment.
False. Biden is picking up Bernies environment plan. Trump is for fracking and that cannot keep happening. It‚Äôs not really about politics or sides. It‚Äôs about who will help the earth and who won‚Äôt.
ending new fracking would mean it would stop. You can only do it in a location once so once active locations were done it would be over.
Anarchy- vote Biden bros.  I have a hard time feeling sorry. They voted for this government.  There‚Äôs no real change ever without chaos.  Live it. Then decide how to vote next time.
We don‚Äôt trust you Ron, because you carry water for trump &amp; Putin. You are dishonest with the American people about the Russians, Ukraine, &amp; Biden. LIES.

Biden brosI think Biden is healthy enough, but if he leaves it to Kamala in ‚Äò24 - I BET she taps Mayor Pete for her VP pick.. üò≠ü§£
You are stupid.  Biden will defend our national parks.  Biden will nominate impartial jurists to the Supreme Court.  Biden will nominate hundreds of judges that aren't in bed with big oil.
Only his base watches these. They hurt him more than help.  Biden is doing fine.  Just let Adderall addicted Trump talk nonsense everyday and he loses support every day.
Swiss Skydiver answered a lot of questions today...  ...unlike Joe Biden.
Biden probably could get a couple of old guys in a rubber inner tube.
Trump Biden 2020!!! #KAG #WinRed #WW3
A pandemic going on millions out of work the economy in tatters the USPS under attack and you think smearing hunter biden is gonna get the traction you expect to get the orange buffoon re-elected?
Biden flotilla looks different than the  flotilla.
Biden is purposefully putting lipstick on the universal mail-in pig completely open to fraud.  Biden speaks no truth.  If you requested a mail-in ballot, use it. If you received one you didn‚Äôt request Do Not Use It. Go to the polls Patriots.  Vote R√©publican.
Again, Biden should just start acting like he is already the president.  Like mandate masks for everyone, at all times, except when in your house or driving in your car.
As a South Asian in politics,  nomination is a big deal to me. We have come a long way from my childhood when I saw myself seldom represented by political figures (who I viewed as celebrities).
Well Joe Biden should not be allowed to be a candidate for President. He is corrupt.
Agree.  How is Biden running for President?  He‚Äôs a criminal.  He was in that January 5 meeting.
Trump has accomplished for the Far Eastern countries is Amazing. May they now live in peace. WOW.  After all these years, Trump gets it done.  Fantastic.  Biden staking a claim is pathetic.Stolen Honor. Shame on Biden. Obama had 8 yrs and all they did was send billions in cash.
President Trump is blowing Joe Biden out of the water on the internet... Trump has 28.8 million followers on facebook compared to  Biden that with 2.8 million and on twitter The President has 85 million+ followers and Joe has a pale 8.4 million.  Do election polls lie?
Exactly right. A vote for Biden is actually a vote for Harris for the presidency. Patriots, no matter what, show up at the polls and vote Red.
that the deal was built on efforts by ‚Äúmultiple administrations,‚Äù including the Obama-Biden administration that preceded Trump‚Äôs, to foster a broader Arab-Israeli opening.e-deal-to-normalize-relations/ via
But at the same time the program could be updated. New, fresh ideas should be embraced. The founding fathers developed a system that gave us Biden v Trump after all
Not a Biden fan but this makes him more interesting as a person &amp; politician üëáüèª
sense trump has openly admitted to deliberately messing with the postal service to suppress votes,if the polls show him winning,let biden contest the polls and ask for a recount,keep in limbo til the end of january,and who does the constitution say becomes president?.
Not to mention, where is Obama, Al Sharpton, JOE BIDEN, they all made it to Floyd's?
Life = 0 when you wake up with #Biden ?
Joe Biden is pathetic.
I would be willing to bet $1M that Joe Biden will wreck the economy, but worse than that, he'll screw up all the Dem's policies because he can't remember what they are.  The Dems will have him shot, so they can completely destroy the country, which is their end game.
I don‚Äôt know why Killary isn‚Äôt freaking out with a possible Harris/Biden ticket and the possibility of her becoming the first female President.
I‚Äôm scared if Biden gets in office he gone start locking niggas up
TBH, Trump seems to be doing Biden's work for him.  Operation 'let him talk' seems to be working, when it comes to Trump.   But I would love to watch you do an interview with
Biden and Harris, both usually seen without masks until the day after she was ‚Äúchosen‚Äù, now trying to ‚Äúlead by example‚Äù and spike the scamdemic fear factor!
The Democrats  see the writing on the wall.  Trump is picking up voters in most demographics, economic data is looking good, and Biden- Harris aren‚Äôt.  The Dems are scared.
He doesn‚Äôt know how right he is! Vote Biden/Harris 2020!
Biden is a perverted creep. üò°
Top story: NYPD union endorses Trump, nicknames Joe Biden 'Sleepy Joe'  see more
Probably a reason Biden waited as long as possible to announce her.
Would you serve in the Biden admin if you were asked to?  Are you feeling ok now?
You‚Äôre worried about winning against Joe Biden! So you begin to play dirty. The only way to win is if you CHEAT! The USPS is failing so you put someone in charge so you can make sure mail in votes don‚Äôt get counted
HANNITY ISNT TALKING ABOUT TRUMP YOU BUFFOONS!! HE IS TALKING ABOUT BIDEN
Hey Jim, why aren't you asking why Biden and Harris refused to answer questions at their press event today?  #Hypocrite #FakeNews
Joe Biden, you are dead broke.  The Dems are Dead Broke. You over spent for 40 years and produced nothing but debt.  You've literally stolen the future of millions of Americans. We don't trust you and your Nuclear Bomb, Trampala.
But, they're going to lie &amp; do their best to hide how really ugly Joe Biden is.
I know.  People need to think long and hard about that fact.  Do we want 4 years of Obama?  Nope.  We put in 8 years, we put up with him not yelling everyday to remove him.  I want to know how criminal Biden can run for President?  He‚Äôs wanted in Ukraine.  He‚Äôs a criminal.
At least Rudy's daughter is smart enough to endorse Biden.  #NastyWomenAgainstTrump
Here's a wild idea. Biden wears a mask because hes not actually talking it's someone else speaking using software to make themselves sound like biden through a PA speaker
if Maggie Rogers wants me to vote for joe Biden I will do it...I guess
i loathe biden as much as one person can loathe another but please vote for him
If you vote for anyone besides Biden, at this point, you do want Trump in office. So yes, you'll continue to be called out.
Joe Biden is a blatant LIAR!!!
Lindsey Graham needs a hearing aid.  Several.  And Mitch "Mumbles" McConnell is one step away from being Joe Biden.  Nancy Pelosi is a Meth Head.  I wouldn't give a nickel to any of them.  All they'd do is send you a bill to tax you on the nickel.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president:  #KAKEnews
So best case scenario if Biden wins that America somehow survives? That‚Äôs not the question. The question is: Are we better off than today? Will a pro-abortion, pro wealth re-distribution, anti-Capitalism, anti-Christian worldview from the top make us a better or worse country?
Well I hope those 150 black men see that and forget Biden.
Trampala Harris and Traitor Joe had a press conference today, and Joe Biden couldn't even speak.  It's obvious Biden is not running for President. Harris is the Radical Dem's pick, in charge of destroying the Constitution.
Hmmm... seems Trump, his Minions and Biden and his Minions have all started in with each of their respective narratives on why the election results will be null and void. Linking what Graham said with Our current state, could We imply Our current Regime is Corrupt as well? ü§îü§îü§î
Why is Joe Biden being allowed to run for President?  He‚Äôs been named as someone who was in a meeting framing Flynn?
Many of them do.  Joe Biden owns hunting shotguns and a Beretta handgun.
I've seen the theory that the best way to maximize your vote is to vote 3rd party, as:  1. A vote for a 3rd party is a vote for Trump 2. A vote for a 3rd party is a vote for Biden 3. A vote for a 3rd party is a vote for the 3rd party candidate.  Ergo, it's worth 3 votes!!!
Biden cant fix anything he barely knows what's going on in his own basement
Snowden came out with a book at the beginning of the primary pushing Russian disinfo on President Obama and VP Biden. That's what this is about. trump wants him to help attack our election and democracy.
No no no no. Shame on you ACLU. He's a traitor who most recently promoted Russian disinfo Pres Obama &amp; VP Biden. He put lives in danger.  He is neither a whistleblower nor a hero.
At beginning of the primary Snowden pushed his book (which US news media stupidly gave him a platform to do) during which he insinuated all sorts of things about Pres Obama &amp; VP Biden, in case anyone's wondering what this traitor's cooking up with the traitor in our WH.
Biden may have some social ineptitude as far as boundaries, but awkwardness and documented sexual assault with dozens of victims and keeping close company and association with Epstein and Ghislane Maxwell are 2 entirely separate things.
It's going to be hilarious when they're making these about Biden 10 seconds after he's sworn in.
Wow, knew Biden already sucked by himself,  now with this Broad he has running with him. How comical.  LOSERS
Vote for Biden.
And Pirro‚Äôs ominous words that something will happen to Biden. Does she know something?
I wish I knew you in person. That way I could remonstrate as Jesus exemplified and the Apostle Paul exhorted, in private. You‚Äôre not being clever or funny, or charitable. You do not know the state of Joe Biden‚Äôs soul.
voting will help, but it IS NOT the end all, say all answer, that‚Äôs what people don‚Äôt get. Sure, let‚Äôs get Joe Biden and Kamala Harris elected, but unless we can push them left and unless they stand up to Wall Street and corporate America, and put actual Americans first.. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I think he‚Äôs right. Many of his supporters follow him blindly! Because of this we need to get out the vote. This election will be the most important election of our lives!  Biden must win this election!
While we are fretting, I don't see anyone saying they're giving up or that he's winning in any way. Biden raised an astonishing amount of money in the last day, people are gearing up to fight.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Sigh. I guess. It just feels dangerous to give ammunition to the privatization crowd. I live across town from the Koch bros. and I know they have so much money and power. Hopefully Biden and his people can also quash that power a bit.

I had Covid in Kansas and ended up in Covid ward at hospital. All nurses and doctors disgusted w PPE shortages and lack of support from Trump. Almost everyone here is a Republican. Either they won‚Äôt vote or they‚Äôll go to Biden we are more red than TX though so won‚Äôt matter.
If tRump wins we will need to learn Russian!  We know where tRump is headed so the only option is to elect Biden/Harris. We also must stop tRump from continuing to destroy the country before the election and inauguration.  #TrumpIsKillingUSPS  #TrumpIsKillingAmericans
Do you think that is an accurate representation of Biden and Trump's beliefs?  I am liberal as hell and live in Kansas, and I do not understand people always saying we want to  take away guns.  We'd like to get them out of the hands of criminals, but not legal gun owners.

I will take Biden's gaffes over Trump's documented 20,000 lies (and counting) and actual evil any day. Biden says stupid stuff. Trump is just stupid.
Sen Harris will be a great VP. She made mistakes in her campaign,  , that ultimately doomed it. She‚Äôll learn from this and it was wise of Joe Biden not to let her campaign people onboard

You are making a very compelling case here.  Yep you swayed me. Voting for Biden/Harris!
I belief Mr Biden isn‚Äôt capable of an original thought. He just repeats the words that the leaders of his party tell him. Without original ideas growth and innovation go stagnant. How is he going to move this Country in the right direction if new thoughts &amp;ideas are non-Existent?
I sure hope Biden doesn't do something truly senile like suggest there were airports during the 1770s or that WW2 happened in 1917-1918.
They were democrats, YOU.  That was your group biden.  The President thinks well of all people- unlike you and obama/dems

You obviously aren‚Äôt following. Luck was all it was. There‚Äôs no evidence trump didn‚Äôt ‚Äúput his people first‚Äù and in fact all the evidence in the world he responded equal to or better than other countries and better than any alternative president like Biden for ex would have.
President Trump listens &amp; has changed to. But media don‚Äôt report that. Nothing is as important as admitting ur wrong. I have a question has Joe Biden ever apologized for looking up to a pure racist, Robert Byrd. Just wondering, I don‚Äôt know how anyone could support that man
Will you also chastise Biden for mispronouncing her name in his speech announcing her as his VP pick?
All this does is fire up democrats and suburban women plus independents to vote democrat if this is all they got it is going to be a Biden mega landslide.
Makes it even better that Biden mispronounced her name in his speech naming her as his VP pick!
Thank you for your courageous work in the face of sheep. I would not expect Biden to do the right thing here, but we do need an equivalent to the Nuremberg Trials next year.  We need to outlaw the goper party.
Omg can we stop complaining abt Joe Biden &amp; Kamal Harris that‚Äôs exactly how we got into this situation. ANYTHING (Besides Kanye) is better than Trump. So miss me with all that justice reform bullshit that Trump dont give a fuck abt either. Not voting is a vote for Trump ‚ÄºÔ∏è
You can vote for Biden because you hate Trump. Conversely, you can vote for Trump because you think Biden is incompetent. But can we please stop pretending that Biden/Kamala is some sort of savior ticket? It‚Äôs still the lesser of two evils mindset &amp; we deserve better.
I think it‚Äôs good that Hillary and Pelosi chose an Indian-American, no wait, a poor black girl, no wait, whatever she is this time, to be Biden‚Äôs VP. What could go wrong?
If anything happens to Biden Ms Pirro is the number one suspect.
Biden has a message for you....
Ridin with biden....
If you not voting cause you don‚Äôt believe in the system, by all means do you. But if you not voting just cause, I hope you fall down the stairs tbh. Biden at the bare minimum has political experience. How does it not make sense for him to be president over donald trump??

This is honestly the most logical argument I've seen for Biden. I hate Biden, but I can't justify a practical reason to vote 3rd party at this point. Even if the bus is only traveling 1 block down the street, it's still closer to the destination. #BidenHarris2020
She's the most qualified to be Biden's running mate. I don't have a double standard that a man can do it, but a woman can't. It's a cheap shot, especially considering Trump's history with women. If you don't like her, fine, but make it about her politics and quality of work.
Canada has done us a great service in the person of Daniel Dale.  I would suggest a Medal of Freedom from President Biden.
One thing Joe Biden has down is his ability to look and sound presidential.  Contrast that with what we've seen in the last 3 and a half years. Choosing the person and ticket that is right for this nation shouldn't be hard.

Here is a hella for thread that  found for me and holy shit her record has even more shit than what I thought she had. The horrifying things she and Biden have done. There is no excuse. If you vote for Biden and Kamala, you can go fuck yourself.
All the liberals excited about Biden &amp; Kamala make me fucking sick.
What a disaster!!
Biden is already on the DNC HIT LIST.  If he wins, he dies.  Now that‚Äôs one hell of a Demdemic.  Sorry Joe. You Lose.
Just blocked Joe Biden. Blocked Trump and Harris ages ago. Here's to a peaceful fall 2020!
And all Trump &amp; Biden do is pander black/brown (as they say these days). White, Christian people vote too, right
Biden made a huge mistake. Choosing a woman who has spent her career locking up black man for the rest of they lifes. I'm no trump fan. But this is an all time low.
I will be driving to my voting station and with my mask on, stand in line, no matter how long it may be, and proudly vote for Biden/Harris. I hope more Dems will do the same and show Trump we will not take four more years of his destruction.

I don‚Äôt care if I lose any followers because of my excitement for this election.   Was this how I saw things going? Hell no... but Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are amazing people, and Kamala is more progressive than people give her credit for.   We have to rally around them.
Your previous and public assessment of Joe Biden is correct. Biden, like you, is a lifelong racist.   Can‚Äôt change your spots, public and political records now.  But you smell the power which makes your motives dangerous.
You will be a wonderful First Lady and we will do everything to make sure Biden/Harris win!!
After Biden pointing out Kamala's husband in their first campaign appearance together, I can't not think of this...
I don't know. If Trump wins, the desperation of the deep state operatives will hit full boil. If Biden wins, most will assume election fraud--rightfully so. Our ideological divide is fast becoming unbridgeable.

Kamala Harris is unfitvto be Vice President. Biden should know better. But he is a democrat so what do you expect   An idiot to say the least
Nobody needs to be voting democrat on presidential election. No Biden or Kamala Harris  both are liars and unamerican   Both want higher taxes and no constitution   They both will be deported out of this country for the good of our nation   Vote Trump. He will stand up for us
Maybe in 2 years he's seen Trump decline as we all have, and has decided that voting for, to him, the lesser of 2 evils is the adult decision to make? I am not particularly thrilled about Biden myself, but he's several orders of magnitude better than Trump.

I'm surprised that Kamala was the pick.  I can't believe  "If" Trump "didn't" get reelected, that Harris is who they want as president, bc we all KNOW they want to declare Biden Incompetent eventually.
It's really cool that the Biden argument is we should push him left but we also can't critique, complain, or challenge him at all.  Almost like liberals don't care.

But Biden is worse than a rock soooooüòÇ there are more than two choices and if the American people want real change we need to vote like it.
Watch how fast the Biden administration will work to ‚Äòrestore law and order‚Äô.  I bet they‚Äôll make Trump look like a softie.  A lot of ppl are going to jail
I'm sorry but I can't get excited by this. The Harris pick was inevitable. I understand this is an existential election and I will vote Biden, but we can't go back to business as usual. We need to fundamentally change the way  government works. It hasn't worked for 40 years. üôÅ

I am so excited for Biden/Kamala! The perfect ticket to win.
Lets be real, the people upset by Bidens VP pick are the same people who lost Bernie the nomination. Our generation talks a big game but we dont show up to the polls as a whole. Super sad.  Biden made the right pick.
You guys you have no idea how great if a day this is for me. First two of my favorite political people talking to my favorite actors, then we get a Biden / Harris ticket. Maybe 2020 is turning around. ü§ûüèª

What does the map of Montana look like? (The face of Joe Biden).  What is Montana sniffing? (Kamala Harris, I mean Idaho).
Clemens, you are a liar.  Trump has been on the road for weeks checking on companies in need &amp; the VA.  He's been checking on states who have outbreaks. Joe Biden has been living in his bunk bed for the last 8 month.  He and Kam will be the 1st Pres and VP to die in office.

So it's gonna be Biden/Harris, better than Trump/Pence, but far less than us progressives hoped when we started the primary process. So it's a choice between the lesser of two evils once again, center-right vs. extreme far-right.
The firmest slap in the face to BLM is Biden choosing a woman who made a career out of locking up black people over minor marijuana charges, and fighting to keep them in prison PAST their sentencing

In this day and age when massive law enforcement reform NEEDS to happen, Joe Biden picks a cop who wanted to put mothers in prison for their kids missing school. SICK.
I think so.  Biden is Rascist.  Harris is a Radical Leftist.  She will kill off the police, and hurt the country.

Told y'all.  *smug look of superiority*
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden makes his pick for running mate - it is California Senator Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris for Biden VP!!!!!
Yes. I got a tweet from Biden!
I‚Äôm praying Badd I‚Äôm praying. She was my first pick as POTUS. When Biden won the nomination I have been hoping for Kamala.

Xochitl Torres-Small would be a good choice, IMO. Biden's support with Hisp. &amp; Lat. Amrcns is soft compared to other traditionally Dem demos. She's a Blue Dog Dem, which would help solidify moderates that worry Biden is moving to far left to satiate the Bernie stans.
Your a joke Biden you will never be potus
Really hope it‚Äôs Kamala Harris. Seems like a good balance, despite her putting Biden on blast in a debate.
The US judicial system will throw its full weight at you on January 20th.  Hilary Clinton, the new Attorney General will throw your ass in jail.  Sleepy Joe Biden will laugh when asked if he is going to pardon you...

You can't vote for a dead guy.  Joe Biden is a Dead Man Sometimes Walking.
All hail joe biden he will heal you now.....
Biden might not be the democratic candidate a lot of us wanted but his cabinet is going to be STACKED and he will actually listen to them and other experts. Just something to consider before November
Biden Bottoms That shit would be hilarious!
Joe Biden, stay in your basement and don‚Äôt come out.  The DNC needs you dead.
Political Assassinations are coming.  Talk on social media and during rallies say Susan Rice, Kamala Harris, Biden, Trump, Pelosi, DeBlasio, Lightfoot and Cuomo are targets.
Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt blow his own nose, let alone cure Covid.  However, he can blow his election and kill the VP, if the DNC doesn‚Äôt kill him first. #TraitorJoe
Yes, except, in true fashion, you only see the 1% of America and not the rest of us who don‚Äôt want Biden elected over here in middle class America
Just tell them you don't have to be a Dem to vote for Biden, you just have to have morals.
Or you are just setting up the Dems defense if Biden doesn‚Äôt win the election.  Get a new stick this ones getting old &amp; frankly far fetched.  Except the results whatever they may be just like you want Trump to do.  Stop playing both sides of this argument.
Oh, hidin‚Äô Biden...you think we‚Äôre going to fall for your lies.
Biden has more paths then Trump. If Biden takes FL it is a done deal. And yes, but these regions are different geographically and politically. These changes tend to favor Dems.
Allot of these changes are Dems who have been voting red or voted for Trump in 2016. It's not new voters. The lead is much smaller then you think. And isn't an indicator alone on who will win the election. And all Biden needs is a slim win in PA and MI. Maybe AZ or WI. Or FL
Also, there was way more undecideds in 2016, not the case now. And that's with Biden leads. Most last minute deciders chose Trump after the Comey letter. Doesen't seem like that will be the case in 2020. Different year, different election.
Biden is the favorite in these states. Clinton hardly cared about these states in 2016 and still barely lost. Biden is laser focused now. This arrogance reminds me of exactly the Hillary campaigns confidence in 2016. Honestly, I don't mind it.
Theses people already voted for Trump in 2016 and have switched parties.  Dems also still lead in number of Registers. Biden is in a very good spot.
2010 -&gt; 2012 is different then 18 -&gt; 20. Dems have seen their leads continue and expand in some cases. Most R gains are being made by voters registering D -&gt; R or D -&gt; I. Indys gained allot, and Biden leads w/ them. So really Trump isn't getting as many new voters
Biden should challenge Trump to a debate that focuses entirely on the Bible. Let‚Äôs see how that goes for the orange one.
So will Biden announce his VP then...to take away from this news?

They know biden will continue these money making wars
You do know that Clinton announced Kaine only 3 days before the Convention and Obama announced Biden only 2 days before, right? Are you going to base your vote on the VP pick? Do you want the news to focus on that instead of Trump‚Äôs unconstitutional power grab? For what?
No one on this country needs to vote for Biden or any other democrat for president if you love your country and what you have worked for all your life because democrats don‚Äôt care just so long as they are in office
I will vote for Joe Biden if he picks Mr. Potato Head as his VP running mate.
Idiots....vote for Biden he won‚Äôt know where he is at the whole 4 years he is in office and your investments will be gone
Not a "confirmed trumper" here either....Biden, Trump, neither are fit to be president.
WATCH: Joe Biden VP pick?
And Mr Biden can‚Äôt ride a motorcycle!  Which is better bike or motorcycle?
Also, unlike Trump, when Biden does something wrong, he acknowledges it, apologizes for it, and tries to do better, instead of either pretending he never said it, our doubling down on it.
Biden says stupid shit sometimes. That's not a big shocker to anybody who's been paying attention for more than the last 4 years. I can't speak for anyone else, but I'll take gaffes over 4 more years of the dismantling of our government in favor of billionaires. YMMV.
This is so dangerous. Clearly this is a prelude to claiming China hacked the vote to help VP Biden win. O'Brien also spread the lie that Putin preferred Sanders, when Sanders was being propped up by RU because of perceived weakness against their preferred candidate, trump. 1/2
Duh!  Just shoot them in the knee.  Joe Biden says that's best.
If the criteria is that she can't be smarter than Biden, the list just got really short.
Poll numbers play a major part in all of this,also timing/the election.The closer to election for stimulus checks to be handed out the better for Trump.Its probably the only thing to increase Trumps numbers &amp; done later gives Biden less time to rebound
Stop making fun of Joe Biden! It's Rude!
Show me one candidate or news outlet that has said if Biden wins, the pandemic will go away. We just want someone who will actually lead us and listen to science, rather than worrying about Wall Street and his own unstable fortune.
So then you're agreeing that Trump is at least as unacceptable because of his KKK endorsement as Biden is because his son once had a cushy job in Ukraine? Good to know. To quote a BRILLIANT mind: Checkmate.
So this further drives suspicion that something is wrong with Biden. At this point the debate needs to be held just to prove that he is mentally competent.
I remain hopeful that whomever the VP selection is can excite voters enough to overlook their reasons for not wanting to vote for Biden.. I really want it to be Yang. He attracts votes from both sides and would be such an asset! But it‚Äôll probably be someone I don‚Äôt know well.
Well, why not.  Biden gave away state secrets.  Let them have access to our DOD intelligence network, and put them in charge of half of the Middle East.  They love #TraitorJoe.  Let's kick him in the balls again, except he doesn't have any.
Perhaps it has something to do with the utter contempt so many Bernie supporters have been showing Biden since he beat Bernie?
Good thing Hunter Biden isn‚Äôt a Candidate then. Literal neonazis and the KKK support Trump. Bet you have no issue with that though.
Yup. BernieBro ideology:  Agree with Biden: 75% Agree with Trump: 0%  They‚Äôre both the same!!!
All he has to do is not shit himself in public and the press will fall all over themselves to praise him. I mean, non-Fox reporters were questioning whether VP Biden was *really* joking over a joke about choosing his VP but trump's daily propganda hour they praise.

I don't believe for 1 minute China prefers VP Biden. Xi said himself he prefers trump to Dems because Dems care about ethics. trump handed Xi wins on the Uighurs, Hong Kong, trade, and WHO. That report was written to give trump ammo as he already tries to tie Biden to China.
They are weirdos. Biden signs yet to come out w VP pick.
She's selfish like others who know exactly what trump is but can't bring themselves to vote for Biden or will do so only under certain conditions. She's not who'll be hurt if we lose, her wealth and privilege protect her. If  is willing to vote Dem what's her excuse?

Joe Biden can't take action on anything.  He's a liar, traitor, and 40 year failure.  #TraitorJoe is never going to be President.  He's barely alive.
They could end up retired in a "permanent" way.  Real Americans will not put up with tyrants like Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, AOC, Harris, DeBlasio, Cuomo.  They can have the public employees they turned into slaves, but as for me, I'll take a Sig P226.

Kinda looks like Joe Biden.
Good Job Mr. President.  Particularly liked the way you kicked Pelosi/Schumer/Biden in the balls.  The Pres also provided new protections for our VETS so they will never be abused in VA Hospitals again.  Abuse was always one of Obama's favorite tactics.
You‚Äôre exactly right if trump screws with the mail service i will just hand deliver my families ballots and we are all voting for biden.
Joe Biden and 1 life jacket
Nobody believes Joe Biden actually has a plan.  Keep highlighting this nonsense, people see through the BS. Let‚Äôs see the actual plan then
He also gave financial assistance to Americans in need, deferred payments on college debt and froze the interest on that debt at 0%. AND created new protections to assure our Vets will no longer be abused in VA Hospitals. Lastly, he kicked Schumer/Pelosi/Biden in the balls. Nice.
Dude... you are hilarious!  You must be a lunatic.. err.. comedian! Sorry, had a Biden moment, you know, your mentor, Biden. you need to get over yourself.   Draft? Again.  I appreciate you opening your democratic mouth and proving you‚Äôre a bigger idiot than once thought! üëç
Maybe I didn't say that loud enough.  The Democrats have no use for Joe Biden, except they already put his name on ballots.  The Dems have selected two very dangerous terrorists to run the country. Susan Rice and/or Kamala Harris is the Democrat choice for President. America Dies
The truth is, Obama and Biden gave away all drug manufacturing to China.  Biden was involved in sending secrets to China so they could attack us with bio-terror.  The greatest threat to America since Adolf Hitler is The Democrat Party.
Democrats announce that Joe Biden is not their President.  The Vice President being chosen by the far left of the DNC will be President.  Susan Rice or Kamala Harris, two of the most dangerous Anti-American radicals is the Dem choice for President.

No it wasn't.  FoxNews repeatedly stated that Biden had chosen a running mate, instead of reporting that a quick witted Biden trolled Steve Ducey while riding a bike and wearing a mask.
Never! But that didn‚Äôt stop me from telling the pollsters I would definitely vote Biden,  ‚Äúf***ing‚Äù with the pollster numbers like they did COVID.
I mean, unless something changes drastically in the next 3 months, it won‚Äôt matter who I vote for, Biden will win in a landslide
I‚Äôm not here to support Biden. Trump was elected by being racist, especially  against Hispanics, and motivating tons of white supremacists to vote. These are facts.
Traitor, Liar and Socialist, Joe Biden has 40 years experience.  #TraitorJoe
Joey... Joey Biden is going to do all of that????  Bahahaha!
First of all nothing Biden says or does is clear. Mask during outdoor excercise and no helmet, makes sense.
The ‚Å¶ has accepted Russia‚Äôs help without shame or a glimmer of remorse   KNOW that they care NOTHING about their oaths to the Constitution   Their oaths and allegiances are to THEMSELVES   Just look at how they‚Äôre attacking Mueller &amp; Co.
#FoxNews is reporting that #Biden has picked his VP running mate. Announcement imminent. #Election2020
To be clear, I don't think what Biden said was racist at all. A majority of Blacks are Democrat. Latinos are a whole other story, especially in states like Florida and Texas. What Biden said was factual, but he could of worded it much better.
I do feel like Kanye won't have a big effect on this election. I'm more afraid of low voter turnout in communities w/ POC. I feel like the way the media covered Biden and what he said about blacks could hurt him, especially if he has more gaffes.
America CAN be great again after Biden wins in November!
This is so fucking stupid. Please don't vote for biden.
Go ahead keep replying... I can debate my position all day with Truth, Knowledge and Light.  Can you say the same of Biden or Trump?  They are hiding in their houses and behind security while I‚Äôm traveling the US free as a bird doing what I do to bring Light back to The People.
#TraitorJoe is not the Democrat Presidential Candidate. Nancy Pelosi said it doesn't matter who they choose for VP, the election is over and the President selected.  The reason Biden hasn't named the VP is, the Dems have chosen the VP to be the President.  Joe is a red herring.
Joe Biden and every one of his associates are the face of evil.  Their goal is to overthrow our government.  Their goal is to overthrow the Constitution.  Their goal is to make Black Americans slaves.  Their goal is to create anarchy, then attack the poor and kill them.

Well I damn sure we don‚Äôt end up in a racist era of Biden

That seems to be exact reason it's presented as it is, especially considering trump &amp; his campaign have already been trying to tie Biden to China. Interestingly Xi himself said he prefers trump as Dems care about ethics (&amp; trump has handed China wins on Hong Kong, WHO, &amp; trade).
Don't believe the bit about China for one minute. Ratcliffe is simply trying to hand ammo to trump to use against Biden. Xi has already said he prefers trump because Dems care about things like ethics &amp; trump is transactional (he's already handed China wins w/Hong Kong &amp; WHO).

Yelling this statement does not make it true.  Neither does not addressing Mr Biden‚Äôs statements because other Americans want to know your rebuttal as well Mr Trump. This is how my children act, ignoring statements they don‚Äôt want to answer, grow up...
You can thank Bill Clinton and Obama for that.  They were the ones that signed the trade deals that gave foreign countries all our manufacturing.  They also increased taxes on American Companies.  Same tax rates that Joe Biden wants to use.  Biden means death.
Oh it looks like Ted has scared those guys.  Good God.  Let‚Äôs make this last through the election and people will be so pissed off Biden won‚Äôt stand a chance.
(meaning i am considering between voting third party and biden, thus be alright with biden losing, which i'm not sure i am)
but the reason i'm undecided is that i'm weighing the negative change with trump with the stagnation of biden; i'm not so sure i can take another four years of maga chuds. (2/2)
i'm a leftist who is undecided, but i'll tell you that i think most leftists (including myself) think that voting for biden will just elongate the politics that gave us trump, and that the moderate dnc platform won't really give us effective change. (1/2)
I‚Äôm with you - totally sucks.  The hardest thing to hear - and argue with - is ‚ÄòA vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump‚Äô.   Horrible but probably true -
They only pointed out that VP Biden is Catholic.  They made no implication that they are Catholic. As a Catholic who used to be Southern Baptist, I will occasionally say services instead of mass so chill.

Funny the o lot dirt you can dig up on Biden is a cspan video from 1993. All you gotta do to see this kinda nonsense from Trump is to look at his twitter posts from yesterday. Stop comparing two pieces of shit, thinking one piece of shit is better than the other. It‚Äôs foolish.
It‚Äôs hilarious how people are more focused on the President and his mispronunciations of a word yet are silent about the fact that every single lie they‚Äôve spoken about Donald Trump and his motives is what Biden ACTUALLY is. This impending judgment is turning into a good tv show!

Right, there is for everyone. But he doesn't advertise them, you know what I mean? For example, whenever I see a post by Sen Sanders, he's almost always talking policy or changes he wants to make. I rarely EVER see that from Biden. Just "we gotta get trump out of office" lol
They‚Äôre not gonna stick around because Joe Biden does say stupid shit like you do. They stick around your press conference so they have to laugh at when I go out for drinks.

Everyone is afraid of trump but not realizing that the neoliberal Democratic policies pushed ppl to vote for Trump. Biden isn‚Äôt as disliked as Hillary but he also has 0 excitement behind him.
But that‚Äôs the point...voting means you CAN complain. Bc you cast your vote and are not seeing change. Get involved with your local government! Keep talking about it. Bc in this country you have that right. Yeah Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt great...but rn we just need better. (1/2)
Biden looks like most Republicans in the house, old white dude???
As Conway calls on Harris to define her stance on late term abortion, the Biden campaign goes silent. It will be great to see her lie her wiggle out of this and other questions because Kamattress is a confirmed liar.
(Polling isn‚Äôt everything but)  I don‚Äôt think y‚Äôall realize how big of a deal it is that Trump is only 7 points behind Biden in Kansas. Hillary lost Kansas by TWENTY-ONE points in 2016. If we keep trending in this direction, Kansas could go blue (!) in 2024.
Historically exciting? I'm not African American so I won't answer how I feel about Biden choosing a woman of today. I just want to remind folks, however, Harriet Tubman isn't available.
Biden said ‚Äúif y‚Äôall don‚Äôt vote for me than you ain‚Äôt black‚Äù and y‚Äôall kneegroes really gon vote for em.
It's true, and I've already heard people on the right saying this "Hoax will all go away once the election is over" Like no, it'll go away after Biden gets in office because he will do the right thing and shut stuff down and listen to actual scientists.
Not to mention reflecting on good faith criticisms is how your party and ticket grow stronger. We've already seen it working with people pushing Biden to be more open to ideas on the left.
I‚Äôm convinced niggas is just scared and voting for Biden is the nice little white pat on the back they need to make sure everything is okay.....FOH they‚Äôre all white supremacist.
Just the way I like it out in the open. Biden/Harris operate the same in the system but speak in covert ways to gain favor with certain communities but have the same goal as Trump.
If asked, I wonder if Trump would say ‚ÄúMary Magellan.‚Äù  Biden: ‚ÄúLove your God. Love your neighbor.‚Äù  Trump: ‚ÄúI loved my neighbor- she became my 2nd wife!‚Äù
Maybe it‚Äôs just me &amp; maybe I‚Äôm a little off, but even if that were true, it creeps me out &lt; Pence‚Äôs over the top evangelical bit.  (Shrug).  Either way, I still think both she &amp; Pence are far better human beings from what I‚Äôve seen than Trump or Biden.  But that‚Äôs a low bar.
Harris calls Biden a racist during primaries and still gets the nod. Politics makes strange bedfellows
I won‚Äôt be voting for you. I want safety &amp; I‚Äôm thrilled that my children can experience diversity, knowing they are no better than families in low income housing. Biden would reinstate it, giving better opportunities to Americans. I don‚Äôt know why Corey Booker is thrown in but ok
I don't understand even contemplating not voting Biden. I full stop do not like him, but the other option is a fraud committing white supremacist that is literally watching us die from a pandemic he could have prevented.
I kind of want to order a sheet, use one to vote for Biden-Harris, and then frame the rest.
I'm SO over "VP discourse." No matter who Biden picked my goal has always been the same: Get Trump out, and push a Biden administration as far left as possible. Harris is further left than Biden, and I'm hopeful that she'll be receptive to progressive voices in the party.
This is what I‚Äôm talking about. Get Joe Biden and Kamala in office and then we PUSH THEM. We demand change. I‚Äôm talking EXTREME PUBLIC OUTRAGE to force their hand on progressive issues.   Cenk Uygur: What We MUST Do If Joe Biden Wins in 2020  via
I‚Äôm interested to see where this Biden ticket goes from here.   There‚Äôs reason to believe that Kamala will save this man from himself. She knows where the country is headed in terms of progressive ideas.   She just has a hard time commiting to these ideas. We gotta push her.
So far my Twitter timeline this morning is full of Progressives slamming more moderate liberals over Biden/Harris, who are busy quickly backtracking earlier slams of Harris, while right wing people are saying at least they have morals, while backing Donald Fucking Trump.

I can‚Äôt believe Biden didn‚Äôt work harder to find a running mate his opponents would approve of
Great pick for VP! Unfortunately we are probably only minutes away from hateful and racist rhetoric from DJT,  Carlson and Hannity. DJT has already said Senator Harris is a nasty person. Really? Has he ever listened to the trash coming from his own mouth?
You can support Biden and still find this hilarious.
He is basically saying the VP Biden is not a Catholic! I am pretty sure you are told you are being excommunicated before everyone else is, but this disgraceful bishop is following trump‚Äôs lead and doing it by tweet!

The people close to Reagan including his own son acknowledge Reagan really struggled his last two years in office. Biden has always been scatter brained at times. We have no idea if its really more than that right now. But we should. Then again I don't think Trump is healthy.
Racism has nothing to do with it.  What EXACTLY did Obama (or Biden) do to improve black lives in America.  Please do tell. And Biden is self aware enough at this point to be a Socialist or any other ist. But Socialists are pulling all his strings. He is a disaster.
So I guess since the  is fine with accepting help from foreign entities, Biden should get in touch with China right away.

We have known all of this for 3.5 years.The misdeeds go all the way up to Obama and Biden.Not a single traitor has been charged to date with the election weeks away.There is NO guarantee that Trump wins and if he doesnt the worst political crime in US history goes away like that.
Joe Biden can‚Äôt explain the Electoral College. Seriously.
It's infuriating that those who oppose Trump are willing to accept Biden. Really anyone who thinks that Biden is the best option in this country is not using their brain. At least his VP can complete a thought which is a small upgrade.
Near Biden‚Äôs hometown on the night he is expected to accept the Democratic nomination (he is Biden). Grammar doesn‚Äôt matter here.   ALL LIVES MATTER, BACK THE BLUE
Joe Biden 2020 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Bunker Boy‚Äù That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the campaign.

You are correct, my main client voted 4 Trump now she is Biden, because Trump just has to go she says, I said if you could see the big picture you wouldn't think so, ppl Do Not Understand the Optics on purpose and the tweeting, lost won't listen at all!
We added our 4th yard sign today for ‚Å¶‚Å¶  Our Biden-Harris sign should arrive next week. Go, Blue Wave!
Joe Biden has been in Washington for 50 years. If you think he's all of a sudden going to bring the change you're wanting now... You're more delusional that he is. #ElectionDay #ThirdParty #November3rd
Two will happen and the Democrats are setting the stage 1. The election will be contested 2. If Biden wins he will not complete his term, Democrats will claim he is mentally unfit for office #25 Amendment, Kamala will swoop right in as Commander in Chief!
Notice, they never said to wear masks outside like Biden talked about. If they had asked it that way the number would be around 40 %. The amount of brainwashed die hard Democrat‚Äôs.
So Joe Biden is really not President? So I am assuming their are about 20 Co-Presidents?

Sadly, our lives do depend on it. Biden / Harris 2020
The ONLY President to do this. And the only candidate for President who didn‚Äôt become a multi-millionaire as a career politician and crony foreign deals like Joe Biden did.  Biden has been in government for nearly 50 years. FIFTY.
OK....Can we get past the "woman" thing. We all know she is a woman. But she is a person and the most qualified person Pres. Biden could have picked. AND she can reach more people because they can relate to her.
Your argument also applies to Obama/Biden replacing previously lost jobs, not creating them.
I‚Äôm a white person without a collage degree and I would walk barefoot through broken glass to cast my vote for Biden. It doesn‚Äôt take a collage degree to despise a lying, cheating evil man and his grifter family.

Harvarti is very underrated and a personal favorite of mine. Also, I am voting for Joe Biden but that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt mean I like him.
I am excited to endorse the presidential ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  They are ready to tackle the crippling issues facing our country with the urgency and seriousness they deserve.  #VoteEarly #VoteOften #BidenHarris2020
He said it at a campaign rally in February, dumbass! The entire month he did nothing to prepare our country for the worst pandemic in 100 years. Called it a hoax by the Democrats. And for the record, again I am not a Democrat, not a Biden supporter, but Trump has got to go.
Right? Bernie is a bit too crazy now for me. But Kamala and Biden are hardly an answer either.
Just been listening to CNN and Trump answering questions from reporters? I can‚Äôt believe how they allow this clown to lie and not one of them challenge him? Bashing Joe Biden with false statements and blaming Dems, non stop?  This is the worst country in the history of America
Joe Biden could walk up to me and stab me in the side and Kamala could walk by and spit on me as I lay there on the ground bleeding and I WOULD STILL VOTE FOR THEM.  I would.

Biden has insulted blacks by his choice of a ‚Äúblack‚Äù who is 1/2 Tamil, 1/4 Irish slave owner, 1/4 mix Jamaican + white.  Biden has insulted women by his choice of an arrogant Hoe who used sex to get jobs.  Biden himself is an insult to America.  Corrupt.
Among those voters who plan to use mail-in ballots, Biden leads by an astounding 50 points, 72% to 22%.  Among those who plan to vote in-person on Election Day, Trump leads by 35 pts, 55% to 31%.  Among those who plan to vote in-person early, Trump leads by 4 pts, 49% to 45%.

No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim Democrats will rig this election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
The thing is, the kind of people who will vote for Biden don't care about tax increases. None of them pay taxes. They're either here illegally or living in their mom's basement.
Stick to sports. The dude got owned by Trump. Not one single reporter asked that question recently. Shannon, if you really are as smart as you are, name five things Biden has done for our country.
On August 20th, Joe Biden will accept the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. Don‚Äôt miss it.  #DemConvention
People think Biden and Harris are just politicians with a few flaws when in fact they're very awful people who have caused some of the very same problems some people think they will solve for some reason
You cannot be serious? If this Trump Virus wasn‚Äôt as truly serious as it continues to be, your idiotic comment would be laughable. 160,000 + Americans DEAD and counting. If the Biden/Harris Administration was in charge, we all would be better off.   #BidenHarris2020 üíô
C‚Äômon. I answered your question honestly. Man up. The chaos in Seattle okay with you?  Defunding the police sound like a good idea?  Do you support Chicago BLM leaders defending looting calling it reparations? Biden saying we all need to wear masks outside, even in rural Kansas?
Idk anyone who isn‚Äôt voting for Biden, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre out there but they probably wouldn‚Äôt vote anyway
If you are annoyed that Biden isn‚Äôt exactly who you want to vote for, so are unexcited about participating in this election: I have good news!    If you vote some random third party or sit out the election, you won‚Äôt have to worry about voting ever again.
Make it fair and ask Joe Biden the same question! I heard plenty of whoppers coming from Joe.
not sure if you answered this question but just curious, if Biden had chosen Tulsi would you have definitely voted for him?
Ben Shapiro: Democrats slammed federal presence in US cities, but they want to 'send the feds to yell at you about masks?'
Then maybe, if nothing can be done now, Biden's DOJ will indict Trump. He would be out of office, could be charged, could be impeached. That way he doesn't get to run for president again.
The fact Biden is trying to take credit for this is exactly why he shouldn‚Äôt be president. He tries to take credit for what others have done.
Harris has the same criminal mind as LBJ.  And she's just as determined as he was to be POTUS. Biden won't last long.

All the times Kamala Harris criticized Joe Biden during the Democratic primary
It didn't spread cause Obama and Biden took care of it for the country.
At least President Biden has faith. tRump's faith is the church of "People are Sheep" and I am ready to shear them all.
I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden will have a dog in the White House. Although I agree he probably won‚Äôt want a cow.
Would love to hear your opinion on this. But my hope is that Kamala has changed her mind on CJ considering what has happened this year. We the people need to keep speaking up and put pressure on making change. I think Biden and Kamala are intelligent enough to ‚Äúchange their mind‚Äù

Harris has done more pressers and answered more questions than Biden did since the pandemic started. That's just what I'm looking for in a POTUS - delegation until it's time to stand up and read something my babysitter wrote for me.

Trump knows he can‚Äôt beat Biden in a fair election, a rigged election or even a fraudulent election. His only hope is to remove Biden from the race. Trump is stirring up the troops.
Prove it with real numbers. I believe that you could say, with all honesty, that your inaction on #COVID19 has killed more in 3 months than Obama/Biden did in 8 years.

Once again, Dems will have to clean up the sh!t storm left behind by a corrupt and incompetent GOP administration. With the support of the majority of the American people, I believe Biden/Harris can restore our country and go after those criminally responsible. #VoteTrumpOut
So what? Biden is so out of it he hasnt sent his own tweet in ages.
All those things you said about Biden were.....  Just politics?
You all miss the point here.  The Pence(anti-glbt)  loving supporter whos openly gay is questioning Biden as a possible homophobe. The hypocrisy here is ridiculous &amp; reveals his loyalty to the political party is way more relevant to him than his concern for glbt rights.
Kamala has the criminal mind of LBJ and she wants the presidency just as much as he did.  So Joe Biden will not last long.
I think they think too little of black voters that they think they‚Äôre so dumb to vote for Kanye instead of Biden
Kamala has no integrity.  Neither does Tara Reade,  who has stated that she is still going to vote for Biden
Why would the Trump campaign (or anyone) think that black people would vote for Kanye if they otherwise would‚Äôve voted for Biden?
Kamala has the same criminal mind as LBJ and she wants the presidency just as much as LBJ did. Joe Biden knows that he is just a temporary placeholder for Kamala.  George Soros has picked Kamala.
George Soros has picked her to be the next POTUS. He‚Äôs ordered his son Alex and all his open society foundation‚Äòs to get her into office. Biden is her place holder.
Yes, The latest orders of George Soros.  He‚Äôs now put his son Alex and all of his ‚Äúopen society‚Äù foundation ordered to support her and make her POTUS. Joe Biden knows he is just her temporary placeholder.
Kamala has no integrity. What do you expect????  She wants to be POTOS and has the same criminal mind as LBJ.  Biden won‚Äôt last long, he‚Äôs her place holder.

Have Biden take one. Trump already has.
Even Democratic voters said so too!
So every one of these voters need to have the FBI called on them to Karen?
Yep. As this happens more and more people will tune it out. Biden should fade to background and let her take this. America will have to get used to a mature response instead of our kindergarten teacher.
Face reality. Joe Biden is more than likely is going to be a one term president. And some of those think Joe won‚Äôt even make it through his first term. Face the facts.
I mean she‚Äôs right. His cognitive health isn‚Äôt the best. Almost 50 percent of voters believe Biden won‚Äôt make it through his first term. He is going to be more than likely a one term president.
Pretty clear a current terrorist organization in the United States supports Biden

Kamala will do ALL THE TALKING!!! Wait and see‚Äî‚Äîshe‚Äôs the one Dems are really running for President and I‚Äôll bet Hidin‚Äô Biden steps down from the campaign at the last minute [ (mental) health reasons].
It's incredible that biden is actively snubbing hispanics and muslims. At this point I can only assume it is a personal grudge because those demographics supported bernie in the primary; no other explanation makes sense.
Hillary shot herself in the foot by not campaigning in Wisconsin Michigan and PA. And it could cost Biden too if Trump makes up ground, which appears he is starting to a bit.
Pretty clear with Biden being not able to speak without a teleprompter, and the debate being Trump, Biden, and the moderator, that these debates need to be on PPV!
Dang! That's important. Too bad Joe biden really obviously doesn't actually give a shit about any of that, and would rather lose than make a single concession to get people to vote for him
Fuck nudes send your vote for Harris/Biden
Watch to see what the tone of the reporters is for the Biden/Harris Press Conference.  I'll bet it is a liberal media "love in" totally unlike the treatment of President Trump.
Read This: "Chris Wallace: Trump Wishes Biden Had Picked Anyone But Kamala Harris"
But that‚Äôs the point...voting means you CAN complain. Bc you cast your vote and are not seeing change. Get involved with your local government! Keep talking about it. Bc in this country you have that right. Yeah Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt great...but rn we just need better. (1/2)
Biden looks like most Republicans in the house, old white dude???
As Conway calls on Harris to define her stance on late term abortion, the Biden campaign goes silent. It will be great to see her lie her wiggle out of this and other questions because Kamattress is a confirmed liar.
I agree with you 100 percent. No politician is going to be perfect.  My hope is that Kamala and Biden will listen to the people. Biden choosing Kamala proves he‚Äôs willing to put differences aside for the good of America.  We the people need to give them a chance to bring change.
Biden has been in office forever and only done bad things
You can criticize Kamala Harris without being sexist or racist.  You can also criticize her while planning to vote for her.  You can also criticize her and not attack her with sexism or racism.  Joe Biden is a putz tho.
I enjoyed reading every word of this. h/t    Kamala Harris, Gen X‚Äôs Moment, and the Fall of House Boomer  via
Did Biden actually pick Kamala or did President Trump make the choice for him?
Wow. Marshall and Bollier have about the same name ID also. She‚Äôs running ahead of Biden. Really great poll for Barbara
If biden wants to actually offer the left concessions, I'll vote for him. If he doesn't, I won't. Simple
Anyone else get the feeling the GOP is adding him to the ballots to take away from Biden getting more votes, like how KS GOP added Bob Hamilton to the primary to steal votes from Kobach (helps Dem win)? I feel like they're leaning heavily into this now that Harris is the VP nom.
Biden was chosen by the party to be obama's vp specifically because he was the racist segregationist senator from MBNA, and the party wanted assurances that obama wouldn't rock the boat when it came to banks, finance, or racist white people
If Biden wins we lose.
Joe Biden‚Äôs racist past kinda‚Äô makes me wonder why he picked the ‚Äúwhitest‚Äù black woman on his VP list‚Ä¶.

In other conspiracies, it‚Äôs okay to shut down the post office because the postal union endorsed Biden, so clearly would influence the vote.   Unfair, conspiracy, etc.
Ah, right wing conspiracy theory I had missed.   Kamala is not the VP pick. It‚Äôs a ruse. Biden will be forced out within days of being sworn in, she‚Äôll be in charge.  Which is just ASSUMED to be awful I guess because WOC? They don‚Äôt even bother to say why that‚Äôs bad!
I‚Äôm convinced niggas is just scared and voting for Biden is the nice little white pat on the back they need to make sure everything is okay.....FOH they‚Äôre all white supremacist.
Just the way I like it out in the open. Biden/Harris operate the same in the system but speak in covert ways to gain favor with certain communities but have the same goal as Trump.
The problems that made covid such an uncontrolled terror in the US are fundamental and endemic to the US.  And, given the chance for a do-over, everyone is failing again. Even biden is calling for schools to open "for the economy" despite that being an obviously insane idea.
If you think this is as bad a strategy as it obviously is, bring it up with biden and ask him to change. Imploring people to slurp up the hot spit on our faces is a losing proposition. Consider instead telling biden to stop hocking loogies at a huge part of the democratic base.
If biden and the people around him remotely agreed with you, they would offer the left more than insults and spit. They have explicitly made the decision that they would rather lose to trump again than offer even a single thing to the left. They do not care like you do.
Take it to the extreme of every vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump...but at this point, it is what it is. Vote 3rd party for Congress. We putting Biden/Harris on a count down as soon as they are in office. Like...better act like yall know

Biden's campaign explicitly made the decision to offer nothing but insults to the left because they thought they will get all the votes they need from suburban Republicans. If you no longer feel that is the case, consider offering the left something other than spit.
We literally were shouting from the rooftops during the primary. The media did not cover it, and when they did cover it it was through a lens of "bitter bernie bros".  Well, we told you for a year we wouldn't vote for joe biden, you nominated him anyway. Go call some Republicans.
Biden is literally opposed to all the policies that would stop my friends from dying, and a supporter of the policies that are killing them. He's as bad for me and mine as trump

Maybe that's why Biden waited so longTHIS BID FOR THE PRESIDENCY IS NOT GOING TO BE ABOUT BIDEN vs. TRUMP, BUT IT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT HARRIS vs. TRUMP.  TRUMP WAS BORN IN THE YEAR OF THE DOG, AND HARRIS WAS BORN IN THE YEAR OF THE DRAGON, WHICH MEANS THEY ARE ARCHENEMIES AND IN DIRECT CONFLICT TO ONE ANOTHER.
KAMALA HARRIS WAS BORN IN THE YEAR OF THE DRAGON, AND SO THAT MEANS NO ONE CAN COMPETE AGAINST HER TO THE TOP.  NOT EVEN, JOE BIDEN.  DRAGONS CAN OUTSHINE ANY MAN OR WOMAN, AND MAGICALLY BE IN CONTROL OF THEIR SITUATIONS AND REALITIES.

Unless they are black and smoke weed. Bad choice Biden. But then again... derp derp derp
Biden said he was going to pick a woman for VP. Congrats, Joe. It was a 50/50 proposition.
You may be right. All five of the suburban ‚Äúhousewives‚Äù will be voting for you. The rest of us suburbanites will be voting for Biden/Harris.
I don‚Äôt think people realize what a force Jill Biden is. She flies under the radar but she is to Joe what Nancy was to Ronald Reagan.

I think they should switch it up. Let Biden debate Pence and Harris debate Donald.
Biden is taking his VP pick seriously. For someone who constantly cries sexism it seems sexist to me that you‚Äôre making a joke about it. You weren‚Äôt saying the same thing when Trump and Romney were making their picks.
This is an OPINION piece.  I haven't seen any tax plan from Biden. Nice try.  I'm still not voting for you,  or
Oh no, you mean Biden wants to help the poor and hurt the rich?  Tragedy?!?!
From that list, Warren. Although Nina Turner would be a great pick as well.
He gave one to Bill C. &amp; Biden too.Did you even read it? The corruption would be from China and Puppet Biden.

Biden may not remember where he‚Äôs at, who he served as VP under, or what office he‚Äôs running for but he sure hasn‚Äôt forgotten how to take credit for other people‚Äôs accomplishments.  #LyinBiden #Plagiarist #Pathetic
Shd knows Biden is going to lose.
I‚Äôve been wanting to get rid of pigs and cows forever.  Thank goodness Biden will be the next President.  He‚Äôll also rid the country of a snake
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
How don‚Äôt you get the outrage?? We are mad at the media, if the roles were reversed this would be all over CNN and Biden would be having a field day with it. How don‚Äôt you get that? The killer being arrested immediately has nothing to do with it
I‚Äôm not blinded by party, I‚Äôm going to vote for the one who‚Äôs not actively destroying our country. Was Biden my first choice? No but he‚Äôs a hell of a lot better than the alternative
Much of Biden plan list things already done.
Biden is a career long foreign policy leader. Biden is not an asshole like Trump.
It wasn't by a Libtard either! Tho Obama and Biden will say "It was by our very hard work Trump managed this"!
Kamala: ‚ÄúI believe Joe Biden‚Äôs sexual assault accusers. I also believe he is a racist who didn‚Äôt want me to go to a good school. I‚Äôm proud to be his running mate.‚Äù   You‚Äôll likely notice that sentence doesn‚Äôt make much sense.   #PutThatInYourPipe
As a eucharistic minister for my parish, Biden or any other Demo (local, state, national) I recognize and on record as pro abortion, I would not serve them Communion. May get yelled at by priest or Archbishop, but oh well.
Biden-Harris win. Harris demotes herself to AG, overwhelmingly approved. She prosecutes Trump. wins. She is awarded Nobel Peace Prize, given by Biden in Rose Garden. promotes her back to VP.  a person can dream...
The best of Biden - I love his quote about being dumb - he stole that too. #JoeBiden
The best of Biden - I love his quote about being dumb - he stole that too.
Why are we horrible human beings? It‚Äôs funny because I would say about 90% of the Biden supporters I try having conversations with just fly off the handle and can‚Äôt have a real life discussion.
Joe Biden + Kamala Harris = AntiCatholicism Ticket?  via
Please President Trump Kindly stomp all over Biden , Kindly.
That‚Äôs fantastic.. imagine if you will living in a household where the other person is a Trump supporter .. it‚Äôs been very uncomfortable.. I sleep on the sofa .. my choice .. I told him last night Joe Biden is a good man.. His response.. How do I know that?
Lol. Biden mispronounced his running mates name? üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠
I did not add the .com the first time but I get Joe Biden when I enter  too
No A/C or Biden was loosing it and they couldn't put him on stage?
$2,000 A Month Stimulus Check Now That Biden Picked Kamala?
Just one of the many things that I hate about Biden and the dem establishment is this call for a return to decency as some sort of alt to Trump. I must say, fuck decency. What part of I, and everyone else, want and need M4A do they not fucking understand?
You think Trump has dementia??  Biden doesn‚Äôt even know what planet he is on!
Fuck Trump Fuck Pence Fuck Biden Fuck Harris like bruh y‚Äôall gave us the options of all clowns
Yea he outta pocket for that, but joe Biden picking a black VP really is more an insult then anything cause HE ONLY DID THAT. For the votes &amp; that‚Äôs obvious.
Get used to it. This will be the Trump surrgate attack on the Biden ticket up until the election. Then they get to call her VP like the rest of us. Time for worthless JW to go dry up in a ditch.
Lol. Scott went Biden on air...
Pat gave the YouTube address with the same confidence as Biden listing his academic credentials.   #PutThatInYourPipe
Another good alliteration for Joe.   Babblin Biden.   #PutThatInYourPipe
Does anyone remember that story Kamala told to accuse Biden of racism was a lie?    #PutThatInYourPipe
Aw that poor woman has internalized racism. Remember black people are monolithic, ask Biden.   #PutThatInYourPipe
Joe Biden‚Äôs gaffes seem to not only be insane but possibly clairvoyant as well. Kamala may indeed be the future president.   #PutThatInYourPipe
Biden/Harris ... well at least it‚Äôs not Trump!
Vote for Trump! Because we are tired of his lying ass! We are voting Biden/Harris and proud of it! Perhaps you need a sit down with Bernie!
I'm not leaving my party. I'm tired of Trump. I'm tired of sexist ppl who don't vote for qualified women.  That's ok.....WE GOT THIS !!! Biden/Harris2020
Biden/Harris....all the way!
Where does one find a "Biden Supporter"?
if Biden selected a potato for VP you would have written the same tweet
Joe Biden just picked the woman who called him a racist who hung out with segregationists, and who said she believed his sexual harassment accusers. I just don‚Äôt understand anymore.
My only comment on Biden‚Äôs pick is this:   My Twitter T/L speaks the truth.
Not only is  experienced and qualified, but  decision to choose a woman of color to be his vice president ‚Äì the first time that‚Äôs ever happened on a major party‚Äôs ticket - should make us all proud to be Americans today.
I simply love, and am brought to tears by the elation &amp; sheer joy on women‚Äôs faces as a woman has been selected by Joe Biden to be his running mate.  This joy will repeat 3 times in our history: at the convention, on election night, &amp; at her swearing in.
So exciting ....Congrats Kamala Harris  "Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
fun and games in the biden basement
Trumps not perfect and I don‚Äôt agree with some of the stuff he says. But if Biden becomes president this country is screwed. If you need proof of that look at all the cities that have riots/looting. They are all run by Democrats who want to defund the police. Look at the numbers
Poll: Alarming Portion of Dem Voters Don't Believe Biden Can Finish a Single Term in Office
The choice marks just the third time in history a woman has been chosen as a running mate on a major party presidential ticket, and the first time a Black woman has been selected.
Ok so Biden said if you vote for Trump you ain‚Äôt black. He said the Barack Obama was, and I quote, ‚Äúthe first maintstream African-American who is articulate bright and clean‚Äù. WOW. ‚Äúyou cant go to a 7-11 or a Dunkins unless you have a slight Indian a accent.
Racist things Biden said: ‚ÄúObama is the first mainstream African American who is articulate, bright and clean‚Äù   ‚ÄúIf you vote for Trump, you ain‚Äôt black‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go into a 7-eleven or a Dunking Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent‚Äù
OK if I wasn‚Äôt voting for Joe Biden 20 minutes ago now that I know it‚Äôs Kamala Harris wow that‚Äôs just one more reason for me not to pick Joe Biden.
I would rather give Trump's party my ticket instead of vote for Biden/Harris... at least, I know where they are with the bullshit.
I can't wait to watch Biden and Harris get up and punch back.
I‚Äôd rather Kamala be AG but this is a safe choice. Biden/Harris 2020.
Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.
I‚Äôll save you the time. Biden has chosen a VP but hasn‚Äôt announced yet. So it‚Äôs all ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù of a pick no one knows. At least on the cable news networks.
Don't forget Biden. Now, just to solidify those thoughts he chooses Rice. Or whomever puppets Biden chose Rice. Those two have such great track records. That was sarcasm for those of you liberals that don't understand that. #BidenIsAPuppet #Trump2020
This is hilarious.  I will likely make the same facial expressions when Biden announces his vp pick.
get ready for the internet to break when Biden announces his VP.
BS. Did you see Joe riding his bike the other day. All Trump does is watch Fox news and tweet all day. Biden will keep a full schedule.

Biden campaign staffers donate to group that bails out jailed Minneapolis protesters: report  #FoxNews
He would never be able to get the launch codes right if Biden was elected
Thank youüôè
Nice to meet you #resisters
Trump supporters: It's just a slip of the tongue. Shut up. #BestPresident  Biden: Shrek is good Pixar movie.  Trump supporters: Why hasn't Biden been committed yet? Clearly his mind is dust. Shame no one loves him to stop his insanity.
Dear Nancy Pelosi thank you for your harrd work. It cannot be easy dealing with the corrupt occupation of the WH. Let us know what we as Americans can do besides VOTE BIDEN  and Democratic to flip the Senate.
Biden and Trump God help us...
Biden: if you aren't going out and destorying and looking stores and burning the US flag you ain't american
Thank you Molly
give me one with joe biden - "i smell hair"
Biden: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not jokin‚Äô I literally am a racist! These slip ups are with me trying to hide it! Imagine if I wasn‚Äôt trying to hide it!‚Äù   #PutThatInYourPipe
Episode 4 is up after a bit of a hiatus for vacations.  ITCOHE EP:4 HCQ, Biden, and more tangents.  via
I want Biden to Make America Healthy Again...whoever he picks we will support. The Bernie supporters will have to deal with it or sit this election out. Perhaps those supporters want to reelect Trump..Disgusting
New to Twitter #FBR
If Joe Biden really wants to win he‚Äôll walk out to the first debate with the 2016 freshman cypher playing
Always a diversion with Trump. After 4 + years most Americans are aware of his tactics. Besides being mentally unfit for the office he has proven a real danger to humanity and our planet. Life  long Kansan here. Voting Joe Biden President and Barbara Bollier for Senate.
Biden probably should have a MAGA hat and Trump tie ready because Trump's only retort will be "WRONG" and Biden can then stick him in a corner to defend it.
I think it will be Harris but it could be Rice as Biden may not want to lose a Senate seat.
yeah, because going out of your way to kill American kids is really the only level you haven't publicly stooped to yet.  But thank you for doing so much work to campaign and rise funds for our soon-to-be elected forty-fifth President, Joe Biden!
My dad just tried to get me to not vote for Biden by saying that he‚Äôd lead us to socialism...like bro that‚Äôs what I want
Lyin‚Äô Biden!!!!ü§°

I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúSalvadore√±os con Biden Official Kickoff!‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Actually I have a better idea. Roller Derby. Biden could take out Trump no problem and Kamala would send Pence crying back to Mother
The next six months Nancy Pelosi will take a charge Donald Trump will be gone Joe Biden will be confirmed as president of United States and the judicial proceedings will happen Against trump‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs my prediction Rachel
What in sweet Biden‚Äôs name is this picture that I am looking at?
Y‚Äôall arguing about white and black.. trump &amp; Biden while there‚Äôs children being raped on camera. Being sacrificed, having their faces cut off and chemicals extracted from their fucking Brains.Goofy asf. Like extra goofy. I‚Äôll slap the next mfer come at me on some Political shit.
In case anyone needed confirmation of Kanye‚Äôs role is, here it is:
Between the Axios interview, Thighland, 160,000 deaths, Deustch Bank, and Biden looking at a possible 350+ electoral vote victory, this hasn't been a good week for Trump.
A picture says a thousand words. I suppose according to Pelosi and Biden they would say " I guess we forgot to add sugar to the Kool-Aid for that City"
