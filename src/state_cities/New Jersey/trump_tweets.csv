Toxic narcicists who steal their status with falsehoods; seize power at the expense of others; demand unquestioning obedience; and are addicted to adulation and priviledge -  believe laws and rules only apply to lesser beings. For examples, google Trump, LaPierre,  or Falwell.

One can make a strong argument that Trump should be placed in the "group interest" category of The American Voter's levels of conceptualization.
Wrong Chris. Trump loves the camera and never turns down a chance to talk in public. More presidents need to learn how good that is for the country. Regardless of the polls he’d debate weekly and you know it.

Read, absorb, and retweet the whole story. It's at least as revealing of what's inside Donald Trump as all the racism, financial corruption, treachery, and sexual criminality we already know about.
Waiting to see how quickly Donald Trump amplifies the fake footage to support his own fact-free "facts" and thought-free "thoughts".
These are no more Jews than Trump's "Christians" are Christians. People who've replaced every last trace of Jewish moral and ethical values with a vicious, racist, and authoritarian ethnic nationalism. If they're legitimate Jews, I'm not. And if I'm a legitimate Jew, they're not.
Since the Book of Exodus, this has always expressed the principle of retribution being equal to, not greater than the injury. Trump's frequent descriptions of himself as a counterpuncher who always and compulsively hits back harder completely violate the Biblical principle.

Remember what happened in Yugoslavia in the late 1980s. Slobodan Milosevic was elected as president and became partial dictator in 1991. The country broke up between 1991 and 1997 and he was deposed in 2000. Trump's election in 2016 = Milosevic election in 1988.
Milosevic did the same thing to Serbia that Trump will do to America.
That's why he has always gone to church every Sunday and Trump has never gone.
Trump cronies lie about everything-including doctored video &amp; audio of their opponents. Remember the press conference microphone "grab. Now Biden's backgrounds, speech patterns, and hand gestures are being altered in Trump ads. It's still lying. The thing Trump is best at.
Trump is more like Slobodan Milosevic. Remember what happened after his first three years in office between 1987 and 1989? America is now at the point of what Yugoslavia looked like in 1989. We know what will be coming in five months from now.

Haven't believed Graham since he was defeated by President Trump. Never trust the TRUMPBROKE.

if you love China, vote for basement joe.  He will reverse anything Trump effected.   Biden hates Trump enough to want higher taxes, open borders, more abortions, high unemployment, military weakness--all in exchange for power.
If Biden wins, say goodbye to anything Trump.  He hates Trump enough to reverse lower taxes, restrictions on abortions, secure borders, military supremacy, energy independence, and even religious freedom.
I'm still waiting for a journalist/ reporter to ask trump what he *specifically* means when he says "we're looking at that very strongly," or any of his other meaningless, vacuous expressions.
What will Biden, the hiding basement guy, bring to our country?   His hatred of Trump will destroy anything Trump gave America:   lower taxes, energy independence, support for police and military, secure borders, restrictions on abortion, better trade deals, veterans health care.

Trump is to powerful for us to defeat now. I will need to act as the Trojan Horse from ancient times in order to reach what he hides from us because that is how Greece defeated Troy and I will need to do the same with the Trump campaign members.
Okay. Here’s where the impeachment succeeds: political weaponry against the Senators who, in lockstep, voted to acquit. It helps also, to use as a campaign crowbar against trump: “no one is stopping him. You, the voter, have to. Make America FREE again.”  I’ve done MY research.
Of course it’s “fair to question” the leadership. But be fair about it.  Trump *has* done a number on all of us. But it would be massively worse (I know, hard to imagine) if not for the Democratic House and the efforts of Speaker Pelosi.  Now you’re attacking me? Shame on YOU!

As for the term "witch hunt" being used by Trump, I finally understand why he uses that term. He has been casting spells that are made to set me and my IRL brothers into #conflict in the worst possible ways. What did Trump have to gain by making all the countries hate each other?
Like Trump, I have been a slave to personal glory and judged others based on their image and wrongfully attacked their heritage. I especially paid dearly for biting the hands that fed me. He loves when someone harms the innocent which is a very disgusting thing to indulge at all.
I hate myself for persecuting my old friends from school and it was just so horrible that such happened between me and my loved ones. I am becoming more and more like Trump every single time. I just hate the fact that I was overcome by the blind hatred that set me to hurt others.
I finally realize now (according to Trump's tweet) that President Trump is the one who sets me on a path to hurt my old schoolmates and have them persecuted in the worst possible ways. He wanted me to have my loved ones persecuted and he wanted me to hate on the harmless animals.

Spoken like the Classic Megalomaniacal Narcissist Trump so obviously is.Lets hope Trump never has to mention Phuket in a speech!
trump is racist and disrespectful and rude .. my keyboard said it best
Yes! Perfect for the role of president Trump
My administration said we were taking Trump Plaza Down...A video is worth a thousand words #herecomethereds #teamsmall #mayorsmall #cityofatlanticcity #wealwaysworking #itsagreatdayhereinthecityofatlanticcity
Yep Trump made them do it 😂😂
No no no no. Four more years. Trump 2020!💪🇺🇸🙂
Classic #FakeNews by #Microsoft, #MSN, #abc, #WSJ.  Full intelligence report said #Russia helping #Trump, hurting #Biden while #CCP #ChineseCommunistParty &amp; #Iran helping Biden, hurting Trump. But #Mainstream #Media reports only half of story.  Half Truth = Whole Lie.

President Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat. But what is WeChat, and why is it so controversial?
Trump u ain’t worthy of any vote. But u will do ok

Even Fox News is over the tRump craziness!!
Trump is always wrong though. Duh
Don’t get me wrong. I love Trump. But the same could be said for those who think  god is the good guy the devil is the bad guy.
I would happily wait 8 hours to Dump Trump!!
thought I would share that my post office is cutting hours starting 8/10 to close at 1pm. We have a business POBox and this is not necessary or convenient other than trump trying to cheat his way back w no postal service for voting.
And Trump is "plain ass" racist!!

I honestly look at people differently when they're openly supportive of Trump now. I can't help it. How can someone not see him for the corrupt, immature, bitter chump that he is, even moreso that someone could think he gives a fuck about them? Yikes, man. Just. Yikes.
The orders take effect in 45 days and could bar the popular apps from the Apple and Google app stores, effectively removing them from U.S. distribution.

It crazy how people say they love America and seem to want to protect Americans, and in the same space call their fellow citizens “demonic”. Trump allows you to spew that hate, that’s why you support him. Such a shame. God sees all, remember that.

I’m done here! Even knowing Trump is protecting himself while promoting misinformation to his followers about the virus doesn’t mean anything to them. It’s going to take them losing someone close to them before they realize this virus doesn’t care about any of us! PERIOD!
You know #amazon is doing great when trump is mad at them! Probably cause they are richer and know how to run a business! Not bankrupt it 🧐
Trump doesn’t have any control over his supporters, people suck but I wouldn’t pin that on our President. As far as my knowledge, Trump has endorsed wearing masks. He also can’t really control states or what they do, people would flip if he declared marshal law and took over.
bahaha - it doesn't matter what Trump says
If Trump is a cuckoo then Biden should win.  Am I right?   Kinda doesn’t matter what side your on, the debates is going to be a fun one.

I don’t get why all you trump supporters love to bring stuff that doesn’t even have to do with the conversation. Of course none of that stuff is his fault. The way the virus has been is his fault. He openly chose to ignore and treat like as the deaths keep piling up
The choice is binary. The choice is clear. Four more years of Trump, the ConMan sociopath, or four years of Biden. No other choice. If you don’t vote or vote for a third-party candidate, it’s a vote for ConMan Don

Thanks Trump!
Skip the Debates. Trump is not worth the time or effort.
Or that attitude will help make 4 more years of Trump a reality. Which, you know, is fact. But hey you Conservatives that say “not my brand of Conservatism” sit on the sidelines and stay irrelevant with “blistering criticisms” of the awful orange man. You’re doin the Lord’s Work

I've been looking at the polls and I made a mock election map and estimated the toss-ups. Obviously, on election night tRump will be ahead because of his death cult voting in person, but once the mail-in ballots get counted this is what I think the map will look like.
Trump has no shame.
if trump is gonna ban tik tok can he at least bring back vine? thx
Don't you love tRump's logic?!?!
Not a one! That's OK--more people who will not be able to vote for Trump!!

doesn’t president trump have better things to be worrying about than a social media app ? 😂
We don’t need Progreasives, and I don’t mean that as an insult. This battle will be won by the middle. The “extremists” (again not an insult just a generalization) of both wings are irrelevant IMO. Trump’s Con base is going to vote for him no matter what. We need to pick off subs
trump and Jordan are despicable

Who  will hit the street if Trump delays election?
TRUMP ON MAIL IN VOTING!
America or Trump
But Democrats never wanted to delay the election.... Are you ok in the head? Dems knew Trump has wanted to delay it for months and Trump's cult have attacked Dems for being stupid for thinking Trump would ever want to do that, yet here he is admitting it and y'all are silent.
Ah yes, that's why Trump wants to delay the election right? Control? Make it where no one gets to express their constitutional right to vote by delaying the election as long as he can.
article 51 - getting some traction on Twitter..is this another danger area with trump
Trump is the most bigoted  and hateful person. Enjoy your ignorance....go to online classes about Construction, Bill of Rights is called amendments. Read.

Would that also be the case for an “assassination”?  Lincoln, Kennedy, Trump  No matter who had won this presidency I’ve been mentioning long before the 2016 election the winner would most likely be “assassinated” eventually
Cool then who are you voting for in November if trump doesn't cancel the election and give the presidency to Pelosi?
Poor simple minded Trump supporters, don't understand the concept of a satirical comment.  Hopefully they just leave America and move to Russia this time instead of trying to secede, killing millions of actual Americans in the process again.

Herman Cain, former presidential candidate and Trump surrogate, dies after battling coronavirus
Forever missed! I think Herman was the one who coined the name TDS Trump Derangement Syndrome! Just heartbreaking,Prayers for the Cain Family ❤️🙏🙏🙏
No the Dem response was that there should be strict quarantining around the few infected. That was the virus dies there and the US can stay open. If we killed the virus once it got here and closed travel, 150k wouldn't be dead right now. Trump ignored it instead and it spread.
Would you rather have Biden, who obviously pays someone to run his twitter account?   Or Trump?   Because I’d rather have
Not to mention when NY got hit, Trump was calling it a hoax and there was no need to panic, was restricting medical supplies and wouldn't provide testing leaving Cuomo to do everything on his own. Now Florida and Texas have NY medical workers going there trying to save them.
I plan on going to DC on January 20th if Trump doesn’t have the election and am going to go to the White House to protest. Who is with me?
comes out against vote by mail, just like trump.
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
I am a huge Trump supporter, BUT if the Ebeneezer Scrooges in the Republican Senate do not get off their ASS and get something done NOW about the unemployment compensation issue, GOP has NO CHANCE of winning in November!! They are behaving as if there is no election coming up!!

Why does Trump always look like he’s pretending to be president in a Scary movie sequel 😂
He suppresses free speech &amp; used military force to stop peaceful protests.  Trump fires anyone who  tries to hold him accountable &amp; stops them from testifying against him.
What are the odds Trump doesn’t pardon every single person he’s ever even breathed on to give no one any incentive to testify against him and also including himself which might not work but will probably end up in the Federal Courts for years since it’s an unanswered question?

All the things Trump is saying about Biden (he will destroy the suburbs, he hates god, he's going to replace your SUVs with bicycles) are exactly how the people who now run The Lincoln Project tried to depict Obama, but unlike Trump, they knew enough not to just say it out loud.
Trump has done so much in 3 years than 4 previous presidents combined . Dems didn’t  learn a lesson from 2016 loss. November will teach a lesson. Most immigrant Americans are getting behind trump

“Can be interpreted many ways” you said it can be taken in almost any context... a vast majority of his supporters take his words at face value. Why you crying about the media? These are my opinions after watching trump himself, not some media shill.
Tell it trump is president and watch it turn tail...

No one, no English speaker calls Thailand "Thighland". Please stop. You are EMBARRASSING yourself. Trump even corrected himself after his error calling it Thailand. It must be so exhausting running in circles playing damage control for this clown. 😅😅

“After nearly four years of Trump’s chaos, incompetence, corruption, narcissism, nepotism, racism, authoritarianism and nihilism, I’m very seriously considering voting for Biden, “  🤯🤯🤯
The trump White House’s obstruction of any oversight of its crimes is unprecedented in US history — just like trump’s corruption. It’s long past time we heard from mcgahn.   Thank you   for your relentless push for accountability.
Trump’s attacks to destroy the post office to help his re-election is an attack on every single American and on democracy itself.
Trump’s tax returns must see the light of day.   The Supreme Court was dead wrong in delaying our oversight and inhibiting congressional authority to check the executive, but we will not give up our fight to uncover his corruption.
What’s happening: trump is trying to shut down the post office, imperil 600,000 workers, and end your mail during a pandemic because he wants to stop mail voting. It’s true.

The media plays a heavy hand in the destruction of our democracy for never holding Donald Trump to the same standard they would have held any other president in history, and demanding his resignation. Instead they celebrate his “new tone”.
You are dealing with frustrated and deranged people, hence all the rioting.When thier radical leftist ideas don’t pan out and are unpopular with normal ppl you need to turn towards violence.Of course they blame this on trump. They are too predictable.
See this is the problem. Everybody thinks he’s slipping.   When  said “He’s against God”, Trump believes that.  Because Trump (in his mind) believes he’s God.
They’ll find another platform to mess with Trump. No worries.
#DaddyIssuesDonny screwed up the current lie about Biden and taxes. The going lie is 3T, the same amount as Trump raised the national debt when he first got in, not 4T. You gotta’ keep your lies straight.

I think more non-Whites (and Whites too) would be onboard with Trump if he actually embodied the fascism that he is accused of.This here is the exact problem. That said, Trump's rise has correlated with increase in race based violence. He has to go
These two groups don't really overlap. People who like Trump do so because he reinforces their white identity politics. People on the left who don't like Biden do so because he's too much like Trump. Some of them will vote for him anyway, but almost none will vote Trump.

America found out about the China #ConcentrationCamps a year ago. Trump said nothing. He was Xi’s best buddy back then. Now suddenly Trump gives a shit because he wants to make China the bad guy for his own benefit. I believe Trump would be killing Muslims in America if he could.
He also states that theres no need to eliminate the filibuster , because with Trump gone, his experience with the senate will allow him to easily pass legislation without a super majority. Does he not remember how Republicans acted in the senate when he was vice president?

It is criminal what Trump is doing to America.  He has shown zero empathy for the 161,000 Americans who have died from Covid at the hands of his horrendous leadership.
So Trump wants to sign an execuative order to extend unemployment benefits, extend an eviction moratorium and defer student loan payments and forgive their interest, while the Dems still can’t reach an agreement on any of this, and refuse to do a short term extension. 🤔

Thanks to Obamacare, we have ALREADY had coverage for preexisting conditions FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS, despite trump's repeated attempts to kill it -- during a pandemic.  #ThanksObama
.  Here is the complaint filed
After Trump signed the executive order for pre-existing conditions, he promised to capture Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
AG Barr is hated by the Democratic party! He is helping with human trafficking along with our great President, Donald Trump. Let that sink in. Don't be blind now. Do it! #WalkAway
No that’s not the point. A human being got resources he did not have access to you. That trump’s your vague interpretation of why someone decided to give him those resources. I don’t care why they did it, the end effect is still the same and nobody is hurt in the process.
Nobody ever said that Trump is the brightest bulb in the chandelier.
Trump says Biden 'hurt the Bible, he's against God, he's against guns'
It can't be happening 😢 trump stop!
I can't wait to argue with my aunt about how Trump didn't come up with Obamacare.
Asks  If Pompeo talked to Russia about bounties, why didn't Trump?
Satan gave us trump
every one of Trump's failures occurred here in the United States. he's losing because he doesn't have an answer for any of them. seeing how fixated on China you are, it seems neither do you.
I disagree there, and I like the policies he’s presented. Wasn’t one of Trump’s big things appointing conservative folks to judicial positions?
Not to be deterred by testing positive for coronavirus in late June, Kimberly Guilfoyle will return to the Hamptons to host fundraisers for Trump this weekend
you're going to have a hard time convincing voters that China made Trump shutter pandemic monitoring. or divert federal resources to political allies. or distribute misinformation to the American people.  but I look forward to watching you try lol
Since Trump been in the office ppl are being flat out racist. They’re not even hiding it anymore .
Well, you’ll be voting for a criminal in November, since Trump is one.   George Floyd’s prior criminality was irrelevant to him being slowly murdered over 8:46 — as it is to the point you think you’re making.

Obama and the Dems already did that, geniuses. God, Trump is really scared he’s going to lose, isn’t he?
Maybe Italian newspapers talk about Trump because there are no problems in Italy?
Yup. But it also has the flavor of the pronouncement that Trump did Obama a favor by questioning his citizenship.
Interesting because he wants to sign an executive order to get money in the hands of unemployed Americans! While the democrats hold shit up as usual! #walkaway #maga #trump #gaysfortrump #humansfortrump
5) ...Trump actually made an effort to build strong relations with Indian-Americans &amp; India, recognizing our contributions &amp; showing solidarity. What prevented the Dems from doing this? Why didn't THEY take the initiative like Trump did during the historic "Howdy Modi" event?
Is that why Trump is president?
The Orange Buffoon doesn't realize that the ACA has been covering pre-existing conditions for years! "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"  #TrumpIsAnAsshole

I think it’s possible you see a brief shift in identity politics, there may be a last-gasp of middle class “morality” (we can’t allow this!). Although all pure speculation here, and I truly think it depends on “what Trump does.”
The Trump administration is trying to destroy the already beleaguered USPS before the election — because the only way they can win is to cheat — This is a big fucking deal
Please apply those words to yourself...#trump
Um, no.  inherited nearly 11% unemployment from George W. Bush and in 8 years he reduced it to 4.65% which is what Trump inherited. It's now at 3.7%. Basic math shows who did all the heavy lifting to restore the American economy - the black guy, not the orange one.
This is exactly why Trump will win, again and again.  The racists are Democrats.
#Jewish advocacy groups slam Trump's pick for German ambassador for bigoted comments
They *can't* do that under the ACA right now, but you're right. It *is* discrimination and it *is* illegal right now.  Trump's admin is working to make it legal again and promising an executive order to "insure coverage"--which likely won't work since Obama couldn't use one.
WRONG. Premiums went up after Trump decided to get the ACA and make it very scarce and make it so that it wasn’t profitable for the insurance companies or the patients on the
Unfortunately I can't recognize our country only after 4 years of Trump or was I not paying attention or maybe people weren't speaking loud enough for all of us to actually listen to their voices or we weren't ready to listen and learn about all of the issues?
Trump isnt a successful anything let alone a successful entrepreneur. Successful entrepreneurs dont claim bankruptcy several times which leads us 2 question if he really is a "billionaire". Owning mansions &amp; planes means diddly squat if u go thru life being asshole.
That’s exactly what campaigning against Trump Is doing.
I didn’t have the desire or energy to deal with Trump’s nonsense this afternoon or this evening but I can see from others that some seriously insane stuff occurred at his “press conference” (aka campaign rally) in NJ. I’ll head back to the Twitter frontline on the weekend!

Watch to the end because you’re obviously racist pointing to the wrong candidate..or maybe you just choose to ignore what Biden says &amp; stands for &amp; will vote for him anyway just bc u hate TRUMP just for the sake of hate. Dillusional &amp; irresponsible move.
GOP is an embarrassment. Anyone of them who supports mail in ballots this late in the game deserves to lose to corrupt Dem election rigging. They’ve done ZERO to help Trump or stand up for the base. I’m done, won’t support cucks. Cocaine is overrated.
Should every democratic congressperson be charged for crimes against humanity for resisting Trump’s travel ban and accelerating the spread of the virus??
No he's just a ruthless bitch. He wants this because he'll be getting a cut from the industry. That's it.   Trump isn't a complicated motherfuck. Anything he does benefits him financially
He NEVER said how much $ the employment benefits would be. Will it remain 600$ ?..I hate when he speaks he creates mayhem on top of mayhem. Never specifics.🙄 i hardly understand a dam thing he's reading..

To steal the election, Trump's new henchman at the Post Office -- Louis DeJoy -- has just removed anyone who could prevent him from creating chaos with mail-in voting. Does DeJoy know we will strike with great vengeance + furious anger anyone who attempts to destroy our USPS?

The answer to the “Democrats have a God problem” dilemma can’t just be: “Trump is terrible.” Trump aside, the Dems have long struggled with a faith disconnect. Biden seeks to bridge some of that divide, but let’s explore a bit deeper:
Do you ever want to post a prediction but the prediction sounds insane and then it ends up coming tru and you’re like “damn I should’ve posted it!” But anyway trump is gonna be “assasinated” soon goodnight

Personally, I think liberals (and anti-Trump people generally) and the media learned the lesson of 2016 too well, and have forgotten how close the election was. Small shifts in turnout can have huge impacts on the electoral map.

All the things Trump is saying about Biden (he will destroy the suburbs, he hates god, he's going to replace your SUVs with bicycles) are exactly how the people who now run The Lincoln Project tried to depict Obama, but unlike Trump, they knew enough not to just say it out loud.
Trump only knows what FOX tells him.   When he’s out of office- there should be a special committee to review each of his “official” appearances; and these “rallies” should be billed back to his campaign. Sue him in court to recover our taxpayer dollars. He’s obscene.

You took my Tweet as supporting Trump?  I hope the short bus picks you up on time come election day.
He slipped over Trump who was Epstien's bussom buddy and swing partner. Not to mentioned all the other alledged assaults.
Joe is NOT a racist. Trump is. Period
$350,000 $350,000 just to spend time with Donald Trump. Is that a year or lifetime? Most don't have $350.00 for a monthly bills. What millionaire spends $350,000 a year for mortgage. Throwing away need money. So sad.
Meanwhile...
Nope. No spin. Never told you where to live. I told you if you don't like American policies you can leave, because its not up for debate. Two different things. Too much spin. You complain but you are still here. And when Trump gets reelected you will still be here!
I heard “joe biden has embraced the policies of the radical left” in an ad and I got kinda excited til I realized it was just a trump ad
Underestimating Trump worked out well once already.
To be clear I don't believe that Trump is actually outflanking the Democrats, but he could.
So did Trump dupp them.  He let them start on the massine? and then supported HCQ so no max? is needed?  They are going to lose billions of dollars.
Actually Trump is "novel" in some ways. Compared to his predecessors he's anti-media, extremely egotistic, lack of respect for former presidents, and he's the 1st president to side w/ dictators and not the free world.
Given that I’ve seen other “conservative” voices tweet similar enthusiasm for this, it seems more like a plot to convince their low cognition followers that Trump came up with the idea.
Just had to watch a trump ad watching an anime about a bad police state. Know you’re audience?
Trump or someone on his staff got wise to the fact that "there was a tweet for that" was constantly a topic here. And he often &amp; frequently contradicted some political stand he'd taken years ago. So they're deleting old tweets. Purging. NEXT - Trump gets purged.
So yes, Dems are in a pickle: they can accept GOP demands and cut a deal, or insist on bigger stimulus, allowing Trump to cherry pick popular stuff to do unilaterally.   And allowing you to whine about neoliberalism whatever they choose.
Ambivalence at its finest... "They’re being drawn now," Trump said, tying the threat of executive action to the ongoing talks in Congress over coronavirus relief. "We’ll see what happens. It’s possible we’ll make a deal, but it’s also possible we won’t."
I completely get hating Trump...but I'll never get supporting Biden.
They don't call him #MoscowMitch for nothing.   So Oleg Deripaska laundered more Russian/Ukrainian money in Kentucky. Not just the alleged aluminum refining mill, but this building former PNC Bank Building. All laundered money. Trump was in on some of that.

Tuff job to have now!  What a man? Trump 2020
Yeah let’s make sure no one blames poor poor trump! That poor billionaire president, he’s the real victim here!
It's a great game: if Dems compromise they are useless neoliberals. If they hold out for better deal and Trump gets to do stuff unileterally, they are useless neoliberals.   The only way to win is to recognize the other player is a grifting idiot.
I honestly hope you remember your first love. Get as far away from Trump as possible. He is not of God and pulling everyone away from their creator. I met your dad he wouldn't have fallen for the rhetoric.  I wish you well because I'm told to but enough.
"Mr. Trump, who I do not support,"
The same stipulation was in CARES Act. It was also in the bill House passed. And the reason Trump is doing this unileterally is because Dems are insisting on expanded UI and state aid. So how they are useless here? Please be specific.
Exactly, what Trump team is doing,  is exactly what I said is a disgraced that Trump should not be doing."USING PEOPLE". Y'all suspended my account. And they doing just that.  Damn Shame.

Trump is saying it has never been done before. Funny, seeing as insurance companies are already required to do so .
Yes but you said that I am on Obamacare when I am not. Like I said, Trump said it in relationship to companies not covering coronavirus care. He knew what he neant, we knew, you just didn't know🤷🏼‍♀️

Not everyone who has insurance has Obamacare dummy. And when he enacted "the no preexisting conditions clause" was for people who utilized the Obamacare site. It wasn't a mandate for all insurance companies like Trump's is. And then you got obamacare and you owed 20k in taxes🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️

Statistically no chance to win. And no real vehicle by which to push his agenda or even realistically start a movement. I think big change must grow from inside the Democrats. Trump did it to republicans quickly so it’s possible. I’m willing to wait and prevent a trump win.

Hitler’s name is recognized all over the world too, would you call him a success? 🤔 Maybe he was successful to some extent if you’re a fan of Hitler’s. Same difference. Trump, the president of our United States cannot get a bank loan in America, how successful is he really?
Because he has political ambitions for after trump.

What changes here?  Do you know how this works?  Can Trump force lower prices by executive order?   Furthermore, had Obama done that, would you have supported him?  I distinctly recall the right going ballistic over the possibility of Medicare negotiating lower prices.
They haven't made that decision for him yet. So many Lame Pres Trump haters to choose from!

I’m no fan of Trump, but you’re better than this, Jon. Since the pandemic started, about 20 million jobs disappeared. We’re just going to ignore that?
I have a job, I'm fine.   I'm fine helping others, but pre-existing conditions are covered by law already!!!  He just issued an executive order to force insurers to do something they already have to do, that's nuts!  Does that not bother you that Trump would do that?
Hm yes, wanting to create a better and faster process is  bad. Not to mention that our previous president, deported a significant more amount of immigrants than Trump has done.

Trump vowed to drain the swamp...... created Dante’s Inferno.
So Trump starts putting in Obamacare to try and look good before the election.  Nice try Fatman, nobody believes you.
It would not surprised me But they can't control covid deaths and Trump was briefed in December and did nothing till MARCH 26th  .It makes him culpable.
I’m starting to believe that Trump is made out of clay.
I had to drive through exurban Jersey today, where Trump banners and blue line flags abounded, so this checks out.
Also, so Cuomo come October right before the election, he’ll close the schools because of a few cases and say, “ well, we listened to Trump” and pin it on him for causeing it
I've been reading his posts for over a year. He's doing what it will take to give Trump the win, just so he can feel morally superior. I've been dealing with people like that for 40 years of charity work.
Biden apologizes for his gaffes. Trump doubles down. No comparison.
Trump signs Obamacare.   Seems to be a requirement to either be stupid or amoral to work for Trump.
Donald Trump hasn’t had any integrity or credibility since he was a little lying toddler. A coward, a cheat, a thief, immoral, an abuser, etc. There are no positive adjectives in the English language to describe Trump’s repulsiveness.
I’ve seen it discussed and dismissed. I believe it to be accurate. The wrong choice, or anti-police sympathizing will guarantee a 2nd Trump term.

Trump would love to control the media and everyone &amp; everything else...a true sign that he’s no doubt a fascist pig.
They will be spiking their drinks with coronovirus and taking it home with them. So, I’m going on the assumption that there may be less Trump supporters voting in November. Ah , how stupid people are.
Hate to say it, but Trump is correct about political activity.
I would love to fact check how many articles you guys have published where it’s completely bullshit or just flat out wrong. Journalism is now about anyone who can sit behind a computer and make up the best story about trump to make him look bad. Sad. Write real news
Say what you like but the guy is political genius   Sign's executive order.   1. Dems sue, lose. Trump extends benefits at lower weekly amount,  gets payroll tax cuts.  2. Dems win, stop extended benefits,  stop payroll tax cut.  Proves dems don't care. The guy can’t lose !
And a few have no masks, ALL are not socially distant, and truly give no fucks about anything. VOTE OUT THE REPUBLICANS in November and VOTE OUT TRUMP THE DUMP 💩
You people are all claiming trump won’t leave if he lost. Which is funny because you people have done the same shit essentially. You people have not stopped crying and saying how unfair it is since trumps been in office. It’s been 3 years. Time to face facts. Hypocrite

That's what we do. Dems are seen as weak and don't want to fight! That's why the news takes a heavier hand with us. Hill's emails a perfect example. 2016 Trump said Putin called Obama the N word. ALL the media was there. Have you heard about it?
China is meddling in our elections to get rid of Trump and Russia is meddling in our election so they could keep their ‘useful idiot’ in office... That’s why  is going after China and not Russia. A real president would go after them both...

Trump only travels to his own properties and is one of the most poorly educated men I’ve ever encountered. I’ve never heard him speak meaningfully of art, culture or discuss literature. He serves cold fast food at the White House, FFS. Hardly a cosmopolitan man.

Exactly right. And this is why I don’t believe anything he says about China. I believe that Trump even used that farce of a trade war with China to give the huge soybean business we had with them to Russia.
What do you make of the idea that Trump keeps people angry and engaged? I feel a lot of centrist libs go to sleep when they vote and then everything “goes back to normal” and they dont actually pressure the prez. What do you think?

The Trashy Trump Family does a lot of business with China so I am having a hard time believing his sincerity with anything he does regarding China. I don’t trust a single word out of his orange mouth. And still not 1 derogatory word about Russia in 5 years &amp; counting.

I've never heard “Yo-rup." It's amazing that you think it's the majority pronunciation. It's not supported by dictionaries. If you are going by your own ear, maybe there's some sort of defect? Or are you trolling everybody for some perverse reason? Deflect attention from Trump?
for Biden they are gaffs for trump he is a racist. Yeah we see you

JUST IN: Judge rules that President Trump cannot postpone defamation suit involving gossip columnist E. Jean Carroll.
Well it's possible that when #Trump said #Thighland he was recalling his latest #Asian escort:
Melania was a “high class”, meaning expensive, call girl that Trump legalized. That’s all she was and that’s all she’ll ever be.
The Trump campaign is basically the "Ed Good, Rocko Bad" episode of Rocko's Modern Life.
I’m sorry to tell you but those statements are racist and no One else would get away with that especially if it were Donald Trump.. please don’t get it twisted
Another translation is Trump thinks God is weak. Where are the hardcore Christian Trumpers
It's that crazy Trump double standard. Boggles the mind. You'd think since she's a "Judge" she would know that the law should apply to EVERYONE! 🤦 You just can't make this S**T up.
Who lasts longer, Armas or Trump?
the Trump White House is just fucking trolling us now, isn’t it?
I was accused of being a Trump supporter because I said voters should have a higher standard than "not as bad as Trump."
So Donny Dingleberry is as horrible as advertised, and Joe Biden is smart because he delegates, empowering his staffers to do their jobs?   Also, have you seen Donny "Yo Semite Yo Semites" "Thigh land" Trump speak recently?
Don’t forget also that Trump is destroying our constitution rights to freedom of speech. It’s his, AG Barr &amp; Republicans trying to suppress minorities rights to vote and freedom.
Opie your mayor and governor, and others, chose to play politics instead of managing the crisis. HCQ was recommended by doctors all over the world who were finding success with it. Once Trump brought attention to that the liberals made the drug a political issue, costing lives.
or horrifying.  if i read Trump quotes or transcripts (i CANNOT listen to him, not for 1 second) as if he were a character written by Joseph Heller, i end up doubled over laughing.  then 5 minutes later, just like w/Heller, i’m appalled at myself for laughing.
Maybe Biden should change his policy and its wouldn't matter if he is attack people will still vote not a policy of am better than trump and am barack friend without any policy that benefit people .
Trump’s a grifter who’s cheated/bankrupted every company he’s ever touched. We have no idea how much $ he has or how much $ he owes. But go ahead &amp; mock the less fortunate. It fits your personality.   BTW, many of his critics actually have money &amp; degrees. They aren’t elitists
Asked my friend from France if he had seen Trump's interview. - he hadn't - so, I sent him the link.  Apparently people in France aren't able to watch it, is there a work around?
Ok but what exact are we going to do about Trump. How can we be sure he won’t get another 4 years?
The moderates at the debates will tear Trump apart. Biden just have to give him all the ropes let him hang himself with it...
Why am I not surprised that    and the others at  side with crooks. Look who their president,  has done in his past. Trump Univ &amp; Trump Foundation. Both scam orgs that went out of business because of fraud.

I’m so glad Trump is banning tik tok tbh, only smart thing he’s thought of while in office
Trump’s done nothing but torture Americans. And all with the cheers from the lethal Republicans.
Like or dislike Joe Biden, I don't think anyone could ever say Joe Biden isn't a man of faith. Meanwhile, everyone would say Donald Trump is an asshole.

I still don’t understand the tiktok nonsense. But Trump should know far right use tiktok just as much as the left. If it’s truly about China getting info... is Microsoft any better?

Biden doesn't have to be faster than the bear.  He has to be faster than Trump.  Who on the same day declared Biden would "hurt G-d."  Again, not my favorite strategy (and not my top choice from the field, but I'm all in on him).

He’s the COVID19 death president. These aren’t new jobs. They’re jobs that are coming back slowly after months of being shut down. Maybe you should talk about the thousands of businesses that will never reopen, again because of Trump negligence.
Just heard about Pence’s comments on Roberts and Cuomo. The VP is a spineless SOB. Roberts is following the law not voting for Trump’s policies. Cuomo has done a good job to contain the virus. For Pence to blame him is unfair. Not Cuomo’s fault, Trump said it was a hoax!!!

Almost like it's a pattern from DOJ under this administration. From the top on down. Sessions ( and Barr ( set the culture.
Yes. I think they are taking advantage of people's trauma wrt Trump to move as far neoliberal as possible under the radar bc they are betting on negative partisanship to carry Biden through no matter what he does. It's odious.

Maybe Biden shouldn’t debate Trump. Why does Trump want more debates? That’s usually a sign the incumbent is behind in the polls. If I were Biden, I would refuse to debate Trump unless the President releases his last 5 years of tax returns.Have you heard ‘Old Man Trump’ by Chip Godwin on #SoundCloud? #np
Old Man Trump: Tom Morello gives new life to Woody Guthrie's protest song
Fool, Trump owns nothing. Putin and Deutsche Bank own it all.
If Donald Trump were standing in front of me, I would say to him what Tom Cruise said to Jack Nicholson at the end of A Few Good Men:  "You're under arrest, you son of a bitch!"
One week or zero weeks. Which is longer? Pelosi wanted $600. Mitch said $200. Pelosi said $600, Mitch said $400. Pelosi said $600, Mitch said $400 while they work on a better system.     Schumer made it clear that it's all or nothing. Trump should offer $599 and see what happens
Nice to know, but Trump isn't going to draw within the lines. They should not have you covering events like this. It will happen again.
How sad that Trump is now using a mentally impaired man to suppress the black vote. #KayneWest
Trump is an idiot, self serving version of Churchill, Biden is an old but mostly component version of Neville Chamberlain, and Nazi China just unleashes a virus on us and they are trying to rule the world. Who should I vote for?
So zero weeks is preferable to one weeks? And the GOP is the one that's made concessions. If Trump offered $599.99 a week in UI benefits Pelosi would still refuse.
Exactly. Just meet each other halfway and be done with it. If Trump made unemployment $599.99 Pelosi would still refuse, even if he pulled his pork pet projects out of the bill. Idiots on both sides
Then don't give it.  First of all, the House impeaches, the Senate runs the trial.  Second of all, an impeached President CAN go to jail. There is no law preventing Trump from being indicted at any time, including right now, and the process concluding with him being imprisoned.
I do not concur.  True, Trump IS a complete idiot, but that is hardly huge news.

claims   action against  Trump's campaign post amounts to ‘election interference’...nah, she is just sore that they can't put bald-faced lies and medical disinformation out like they did in years past.  Sad.

We were all expecting Letitia James to do something regarding Trump.  This is like hoping trying to cure cancer, and inventing a good-tasting fat-free ice cream instead.
Experts say faster and more frequent virus tests are needed.  Meanwhile,  Trump's goons are pushing out disinformation about #COVID19 and attacking Dr. Fauci.    Shameful
Trump's time is  coming.
Here we go. The ELITES thinking they're better than other's  that don't think like they do. And while you're at it, let's fat shame. SMFH
I was hoping Letitia James announcement today would take down Trump. But, she's doing a helluva a job ripping Wayne LaPierre &amp; the NRA a new asshole. #DissolveTheNRA

Instead, go with this: "...whose actions are completely at odds with the values and teachings of *my faith.*" It transitions into the following paragraph where Biden contrasts his faith and values from Trump's actions without the implication that Trump is "faking" it.
My only quibble is that  could have left off the part about Trump's actions being "at odds with the values and teaching that he professes to believe in." They're in fact directly in line with the values of a large segment of the American Christian Right.
From  statement: "My faith teaches me to walk humbly, while President Trump teargassed peaceful protestors so he could walk over to a church for a photo op."
I'm starting to think the establishment wanted Donald Trump to win.
This is a solid statement that doesn't make the mistake too many on the left make -- claiming Trump and his evangelical backers are "not a real Christians."  talks about how his faith guides HIM, which is different from saying his faith should drive policy.

Why am I not surprised that    and the others at  side with crooks. Look who their president,  has done in his past. Trump Univ &amp; Trump Foundation. Both scam orgs that went out of business because of fraud.
One reason a day until election on why you should vote for Biden, a thread:  8️⃣8️⃣ days till election (reason 13): Trump said yesterday Biden has "no religion . . . he's against God." Yet, the bible is literally passage after passage telling you not to be like Donald Trump.
Told my brother last night the only reason trump the president is Cuz America is a big business/corporation &amp; trump is the best CEO for the job 📝📝📝
No Windows? Damn you Joe Biden! LOL
I’m so glad Trump is banning tik tok tbh, only smart thing he’s thought of while in office
Like or dislike Joe Biden, I don't think anyone could ever say Joe Biden isn't a man of faith. Meanwhile, everyone would say Donald Trump is an asshole.
Biden doesn't have to be faster than the bear.  He has to be faster than Trump.  Who on the same day declared Biden would "hurt G-d."  Again, not my favorite strategy (and not my top choice from the field, but I'm all in on him).

No fake news Trump repeatedly struggles to pronounce words during conspiracy-laden rally, before suggesting he'll pardon Roger Stone in late-night tweet
Neither choices would mean meaningful change for the descendants of slaves so fuck both candidates. Biden created a large part of the mess we are in by comparison Trump learnt from him. Black America doesn’t have a choice vote locally this election we have no dogs in the fight:

He’s the COVID19 death president. These aren’t new jobs. They’re jobs that are coming back slowly after months of being shut down. Maybe you should talk about the thousands of businesses that will never reopen, again because of Trump negligence.
Yes. I think they are taking advantage of people's trauma wrt Trump to move as far neoliberal as possible under the radar bc they are betting on negative partisanship to carry Biden through no matter what he does. It's odious.
It’s like, is Trump their sugar daddy or something? Seriously.
Trump &amp; Joe just playing in our face at this point. Neither of them fuck with us and they just pointing the finger like well he’s more racist than me so come settle over here 🖕🏾

Vote TRUMP HOUSE and SENATE.  The one thing I noticed about him is that he follows the constitution. Only executive actipn when congress fails to act.please save our country.
Never-Trump Republicans don't make sense to me because the general message the administration has put out is "you can get whatever you like" on basically every single policy goal that Republicans want.
The goal is to confuse the masses and creat more division in order for Donald trump to win. Please seek the medical help you so desperately need.
That’s your decision and people should respect that. I personally haven’t seen enough from Mr. Biden that would persuade me to vote for him. He seems short tempered and defensive. If the election was today, I’d have to lean towards Trump.
If Trump, Stone, Barr, &amp; conspirators are not held accountable for their crimes, this country and its principles go straight into the toilet.  I'm I being an alarmist?
Idk if we’ll make it two decades post Trump if we let him have a second term. 😖 The hate he’s inspired and emboldened plus how much of an idiot he is has been pretty devastating. Can’t wait to get rid of him.

Eat shit. I trust trump to bankrupt &amp; destroy the country, like he did with every single 1 of the businesses he inherited &amp; proved himself to be completely incompetent to run (which coupled with his siphoning off $ &amp; failing to devote any effort to his job, led to 6 BANKRUPTCIES)

These two groups don't really overlap. People who like Trump do so because he reinforces their white identity politics. People on the left who don't like Biden do so because he's too much like Trump. Some of them will vote for him anyway, but almost none will vote Trump.

Utter rubbish. Even the typically fawning Washington Times knew the Trump “travel ban” was crap.
Actually that’s what I meant and didn’t express it right because I haven’t slept all night. One theory is that Biden will be proclaimed the winner and Trump will state that the elections were rigged through mailings. A stalemate will bring in the United Nations and military rule.

If Trump says his generals think it was a bomb, we assume that Trump misunderstood his generals. They will explain to their president today, very slowly and with pictures, what they meant and tomorrow Trump and friends will know more.

Yeah but when Biden opens his mouth, like he's done for the last 2 days (Are you a Junkie, All Blacks are the same)...he neutralizes Trump crazy talk with his.
The claim was Biden has a stutter.  It's not a stutter.  He's in a major, steep cognitive decline. He should not be running for president. This has nothing to do with Trump, other than people's hate for him bizarrely driving them to support a man clearly unfit, mentally, to lead.

America found out about the China #ConcentrationCamps a year ago. Trump said nothing. He was Xi’s best buddy back then. Now suddenly Trump gives a shit because he wants to make China the bad guy for his own benefit. I believe Trump would be killing Muslims in America if he could.
He also states that theres no need to eliminate the filibuster , because with Trump gone, his experience with the senate will allow him to easily pass legislation without a super majority. Does he not remember how Republicans acted in the senate when he was vice president?

So Trump wants to sign an execuative order to extend unemployment benefits, extend an eviction moratorium and defer student loan payments and forgive their interest, while the Dems still can’t reach an agreement on any of this, and refuse to do a short term extension. 🤔

Yes. Unclear how it's not an exoticized version of supply and demand. Why are elites (ill defined) uniquely destabilizing when overproduced (vs working class)? Is it that working class just shuts up and dies while elites become indignant? Bit dubious, working class elected Trump.

They *can't* do that under the ACA right now, but you're right. It *is* discrimination and it *is* illegal right now.  Trump's admin is working to make it legal again and promising an executive order to "insure coverage"--which likely won't work since Obama couldn't use one.
WRONG. Premiums went up after Trump decided to get the ACA and make it very scarce and make it so that it wasn’t profitable for the insurance companies or the patients on the
Unfortunately I can't recognize our country only after 4 years of Trump or was I not paying attention or maybe people weren't speaking loud enough for all of us to actually listen to their voices or we weren't ready to listen and learn about all of the issues?

Remember during Katrina when Kayne said George W hates black people?  Well I’m saying that Kanye hates black people. Anyone that supports trump, even if they are black themselves, hates Black people.
Pres. Trump laid out his plan for the executive order in a speech.  He accused Democrats of holding coronavirus stimulus negotiations "hostage," and said the order would defer payroll taxes until to the end of the year and be retroactive to July 1.
If Trump says his generals think it was a bomb, we assume that Trump misunderstood his generals. They will explain to their president today, very slowly and with pictures, what they meant and tomorrow Trump and friends will know more.

Biden is far, far from perfect—seriously flawed, in fact—but Trump is dangerous, and the scary part is that fascist regimes always come to power with the consent of part of the population and the indifference of another part. (end)

Donald Trump using the office of the Presidency to serve and promote his and his family’s businesses, as well as business he finds friendly. Donald Trump is vilifying legitimate media, referring to them in perfect Dictator language as “enemies of the people.” (17)
Donald Trump has, and continues to hire white supremacists in his administration, giving people power to limit voting rights and defund public schools as well as other under the table dealings not as prevalent as gaffes shared on social media platforms.(16)
Donald Trump is systemically attempting to discredit the system of voting, especially in areas he finds unfriendly, in order to maintain and consolidate his personal power.  (15)
Donald Trump pardons convicted felons who he has a personal interest in keeping out of the justice system. (14)
Donald Trump is systemically purging the Justice Department of all independent career employees. He’s doing that to shield HIMSELF from investigation and oversight, and using it to investigate his political enemies, with an end-goal of prosecution. (13)

You sat on this for 3 months, your version of the bill was garbage, take some responsibility.

"But yes, there is a candidate without real religion or Christian morality. His name is Donald Trump."  🗣️ Stop. This. 🗣️  Trump and his apologists exemplify a particular type of Christianity. Just because it makes you look bad, don't blame it on being "without religion."

It’s going to be really funny when Trump signs an Executive Order extending the eviction moratorium and Jared sues to overturn it.
Happy to come in to talk about Trump’s speech/ language difficulties as opposed to Biden’s. Thank you for bringing this very important issue up this week! #LetsGetAfterIt #SLP #SpeechPathologists

It's ok, Joe. Ignore the trolls and do your best. Trump has poisoned our nation to decency.
Instead, go with this: "...whose actions are completely at odds with the values and teachings of *my faith.*" It transitions into the following paragraph where Biden contrasts his faith and values from Trump's actions without the implication that Trump is "faking" it.
My only quibble is that  could have left off the part about Trump's actions being "at odds with the values and teaching that he professes to believe in." They're in fact directly in line with the values of a large segment of the American Christian Right.
From  statement: "My faith teaches me to walk humbly, while President Trump teargassed peaceful protestors so he could walk over to a church for a photo op."
This is a solid statement that doesn't make the mistake too many on the left make -- claiming Trump and his evangelical backers are "not a real Christians."  talks about how his faith guides HIM, which is different from saying his faith should drive policy.

That would be very, very bad for Trump. With all this BLM nonsense revving up a good portion of guilt ridden white folks, plus no time to campaign hard against her. It would be very problematic

I had a big stiff drink that night. Then Megyn Kelly called it for Trump in North Carolina, followed by a loud roar from the people outside Fox studios. That was a glimmer of hope that never waned.

Trump has a small base support. I have seen ONE Biden supporter with a Biden shirt...and it was superimposed in the photo! It wasn’t even real!
I find it remarkable to observe the comparison between sleepy Joe's son and Trump's sons and daughters. All accomplishing something, all mattering to themselves, their families and their community as a whole. Where's? Like father like son

So you’re going to pout if you don’t get what you want and vote for Trump? Or stay home?  Anything that takes away from Biden’s chances of beating Trump is a liability. The goal is to beat Trump and that means getting moderate voters, not appeasing progressive ideologues.
I must have been yes - and I wasn’t blaming previous administrations for everything wrong with his either...I don’t defend every decision made just because I voted for them - what’s wrong is wrong - the separation policy was still President Trump’s
Obama’s, Bush’s and Clinton’s are referenced. I sent a few - we agreed this was being done in Obama’s time - I pointed out it wasn’t for all illegal immigrants at the border - that came about with “zero tolerance” which President Trump stopped already but families still sep.
You’re such a bitter person. Guess the president really did ruin your life! Biden is such a nasty old man it’s funny when he gets angry and snaps at people. I can see his campaign shake in fear! Well 4 more years of Trump will give you something to do!
of course Obama influenced the so-called counterintelligence investigation of Trump. We have the transcripts. She denies knowledge of it but she still won't talk about the predicate, the rationale for spying on a political opponent. #SpyGate #YatesHearing is bs

10,704 votes in Michigan. 22,708 in Wisconsin. 44,292 in Pennsylvania.  77,704 votes over 3 States made the difference for Trump.  162,854 Americans have died from COVID-19.  How many of those 162,854 were among his difference-makers?  How many of their survivors will switch?
Actually, I am better off than I was 4 years ago.  But that's because I got a hip replacement, through ObamaCare.  So, the reason I'm better off than I was 4 years ago is because of something Obama did, something Trump wants to get rid of.

162,804 Americans have died from COVID-19.  That's about 53 9/11s.  Or, a new 9/11 every 3 days.  Trump threw the Obama-Biden pandemic playbook away, for spite.  How many of those 162,804 would have been saved if he'd kept it? If only 10%, that's still 16,280 people.

Donald Trump has called on Federal authorities to crush people protest, going as far as calling Blacks Matter a “terrorist group,” with the legal and law enforcement implications that could lead to.(19)
Donald Trump is courting white supremacists with a “eye wink” as he continues to repeat their conspiracy theories and dismisses their role in racial unrest. (18)
Donald Trump using the office of the Presidency to serve and promote his and his family’s businesses, as well as business he finds friendly. Donald Trump is vilifying legitimate media, referring to them in perfect Dictator language as “enemies of the people.” (17)
Donald Trump has, and continues to hire white supremacists in his administration, giving people power to limit voting rights and defund public schools as well as other under the table dealings not as prevalent as gaffes shared on social media platforms.(16)
Donald Trump is systemically attempting to discredit the system of voting, especially in areas he finds unfriendly, in order to maintain and consolidate his personal power.  (15)
Donald Trump pardons convicted felons who he has a personal interest in keeping out of the justice system. (14)
Donald Trump is systemically purging the Justice Department of all independent career employees. He’s doing that to shield HIMSELF from investigation and oversight, and using it to investigate his political enemies, with an end-goal of prosecution. (13)
But politics being politics, Biden was also USED by Barak Obama. Obama needed those ‘working class’ white folks, some of them bigoted, to win. Joe spoke their language--no different than a heathen Donald Trump choosing a religious fanatic Pence to the white evangelical vote.(11)

You are dealing with frustrated and deranged people, hence all the rioting.When thier radical leftist ideas don’t pan out and are unpopular with normal ppl you need to turn towards violence.Of course they blame this on trump. They are too predictable.
What is it going to be like from November to Inauguration Day if Trump loses, well, I would point to the practical example of the first Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein saw the writing on the wall, nodded thoughtfully, shrugged, then set some 700 Kuwaiti oil wells on fire.
Let's count the ways for one to get fired from the Trump's Admin 1.Tell Truth, 2.Expose Lies, Don't go along w/a Cover Up. Don't Lie for DT. Be honest, have Integrity, b a Patriot.
Yes. I think they are taking advantage of people's trauma wrt Trump to move as far neoliberal as possible under the radar bc they are betting on negative partisanship to carry Biden through no matter what he does. It's odious.
#DaddyIssuesDonny screwed up the current lie about Biden and taxes. The going lie is 3T, the same amount as Trump raised the national debt when he first got in, not 4T. You gotta’ keep your lies straight.
It’s like, is Trump their sugar daddy or something? Seriously.
Trump &amp; Joe just playing in our face at this point. Neither of them fuck with us and they just pointing the finger like well he’s more racist than me so come settle over here 🖕🏾
Well sure you have to wash all that sludge out of you "hair"...
I don’t have any Trump voting friends. If they voted for him and I know about it...they are dead to me
Humans are like vases to Trump.  Things.
No change: 3 years after Trump tweeted out a trans military ban, the White House is still sticking to the policy. #transgender #rights #LGBQT
It’s funny how Joe Biden says all black people think alike but nobody saying anything   Funny when Trump calls the Chinese Virus he’s called a racist 🤔
If Trump loses to him it just shows you how much Trump sucks lolol
I used to block but now I kind of hope they're trying to deprogram from the trump cult. As soon as they start shit or report me I block
I’m not going to partake in the conversation about Biden being a devout catholic compared to Trump not being able to name a bible verse. Reason being I think religion has no business being a factor in politics or anything in life. Being religious doesn’t make you a good person.
Once again the press don't get it.,🙄smfh. Sir u can find a cure for cancer and they will say u trying to profit from the sick. God blessed Pres Trump and VP Pence 4 more years.
Trump is a  classic narcissist
"I am Never Trump but that doesn't mean I'll vote for Biden."  "I think being electrocuted is bad, but that doesn't mean I'll stop sticking this fork in my toaster."  [Eyes lock. Swoon. Birds fly about,  "Love is a Many Splendored Thing" starts playing.]
Biden needs to stay in his basement and never come out!!! Or better yet send him to the old folks home, Trump is coming to eat him alive on the debate stage. I’m sorry but uh is this the best the democrats have. Stutters way too much
Wow. What growth!! What an incredible government we have. Yay Trump. Not.

I’m independent. I’m not voting for Trump because he’s a republican. I’m voting for him because he’s not part of the system of insiders and cronies that your dad was part of. He’s an outsider and he’s the closest we’ll ever get to having a regular guy, one of us, as potus.
So what can #trump do today to piss more people off?   #blackout #CriticalRole #Biden #coronavirus #COVID19 #COVID__19 #BlackLivesMatter #lockdown #america #Election2020
Energy is neither created or destroyed &amp; it looks like the universe is giving us our just rewards for allowing Donald Trump to ascend this high. If we don’t fix this, our karma will only get worse. Y’all been warned. Good day. #blackout
You say that because you pretend that Trump is an aberration as a Republican, instead of the logical outcome of 50+ years of racism, denying science, and blurring lines between Church and State. It has been a naked grab for power.  After Trump is gone, you guys go next.
donald j trump loves his country
President Trump is among the greatest of american presidents
yeah because biden’s policies actually hurt minorities, unlike all of trump’s policies
name one time trump said something as stupid

I’ve been spending too much money on VALORANT thanks trump for cutting me off
Notwithstanding your clear lie that it wasn't covered by MSNBC or CNN, the clear takeaway is that once the "controversy" was reported, he clarified his position quickly and with humility. Try comparing that to Trump and any of his gaffes, mispronunciations or outright lies.
He’ll still look better than tRump!!
🤔🤔🤔 BUNKER PUTIN PUPPET TRUMP WILL PROBABLY BE THE FRIST PRESIDENT TO HEAD-LINE ON AMERICA GREED.💰THE BIGGEST CONS.💰
This whole #TikTok #WeChat #Microsoft #Trump thing smells like a conspiracy. #FollowTheMoney
ha ha ha. Trump is terrible at even cheating. Ask his wives.
this says ventilators, we have a surplus, we are giving them to whole world, trump gave governors everything they asked for and they still fuck up
In what world does this make Trump the bad guy? 🤡🌎  “Advisers” told the enemy they feared their own leader 🤬
I know. I wouldn’t want to see Trump either. You might not catch COVID from him, but you might catch his stink on you, which might be worse.
Since the GOP is now wholly owned by Trump, I beg to differ. You think you’re better than them. You are not.
probably because he thought they were guilty 🤪, so let me get this straight, trump heavily invests in a black man for president, then within the same year becomes a racist, stop being blinded by skin color, the world is more complicated
"Trump Targets WeChat and TikTok, in Sharp Escalation With China" The government cited national security concerns in announcing sweeping restrictions on two popular Chinese social media networks, a move that is likely to be met with retaliation. via NYT

I played follow the leader when I was a kid. We were so focused on following that we didn't see the crash that was coming. The same thing is happening with the Democrats they are so busy following and not thinking, they will crash and Trump will be Victorius!

If they believed in Trump, they wouldn't have invented a benevolent fairy named Q who will expose government corruption. It's better than taking the black pill and being hopeless.  That's probably where I'm at nowadays.
Most Trump supporters are more like DNC-haters. They know Trump is bad news but they believe the DNC is just as bad, which is why you get the, "but what about the DNC rigging its elections..." or "but Biden wrote the 94 crime bill and helped mass incarceration." (1/2)
Just another wacky day for delusional Trump.
Neither does Donald Trump.
Yes, I will be voting for Trump!

Tik Tok is my thing... You can actually be waay! More active! Open! And honest w/ every one on tik tok! &amp; give actual opinions &amp; thoughts w/ out it being such a Big deal 😆 Im just tired of twitter attacking people #Trump for actually trying to help America which is so backwards
When the history of this election is written, it will be incontrovertible that Republicans who loved country over party turned the tide against Donald Trump.  ; .
Trump wish you were here😷 not😜
Donald Trump will not be a candidate for re-election. You and others have mused about this situation. It is inevitable.
Donald Trump will not stand for re-election. Remember this tweet!
Please don't even give this oxygen. Trump like all bullies will back down. If not on January 20 there will be President Pelosi until the courts resolve everything.
The headline should read “Trump lies about Obama-Era Fair Housing Rule”
C'mon Joe.. you gotta be better then this to beat trump.  Incoherent babbling isn't gonna get it done
They should do a survey on would they take it if Dr Fauci endorses it.  I think  since Trump thought you could inject bleach no one is going to believe him on a vaccine.
Anyone in media wanna ask Trump why he’s more focused on TikTok than Covid?
Trump should send the feds from Portland to   house. Wanna keep being a non compliant douche?
Every interview I’ve seen since the pandemic begin with Donald Trump in my opinion has shown what anunempathetic, uncaring piece of shit he truly is. How anyone can support this man is beyond me #Biden2020
It is what it is. (Trump on every consequence...)
I know Thant’s why I’m voting Trump 2020
Ya know why I trust mail-in voting?  It's simple.  If Trump could find a way to cheat with it, he'd be promoting it.  If foreign govs could hack it &amp; help him win, he'd be promoting it.  Also, he wants the old Republicans in Fla to continue to use it.   Feel better now? VBM
Seriously? No SANE person would pick phoney Trump a.k.a. A. B. is the only real option.
Funniest CNN interview ever. Said to a Trump spokeswoman, "Now you're just saying a bunch crap!" 😂
Joe Biden can go up there &amp; say nick nack patty wack give a dog a bone. Still better than Trump lol
That trump Axios interview was one of the most pathetic things I’ve ever seen. How anyone can watch interviews like that and praise trump in any capacity is beyond me. Absolute embarrassment
I hope someone tells that to Trump.
COVID will end as soon as trump is out of office at the end of the election
Very low-end talent as you move down the lineup. No match for the Canes!!
You should just sub-let some of your space in POTUS's head to the Trump campaign!
You have to lie for Trump to the public about the virus or he starts his attacks to discredit you.  I can’t wait until he’s out of office and we welcome him to our world. No more access to his daily tests for himself and everyone around him.
Yes, America needs 4 more years of Trump!
My husband and i are voting for Trump! NJ!
Yes, that is because everything is Trumps fault! According to the left, From day one. The left would blame slavery on Trump too if they could!
I love that hand sanitizer companies will go bankrupt if Trump isn’t elected.  Im willing to take the risk!
I think everytime trump tweets make America great again we all should retweet it with #makeamericagreatagainwithBiden
TRADE DEALS and eliminating federal bullshit regulations. President Trump is best!
Trump doesn't want anything to interfere with his golf.
I am in New Jersey and sadly I have seen a few Biden yard signs. But it seems the Trump supporters have gone underground to avoid the hate and tantrums. Everyone I talk to wouldn’t think of voting for Biden.
Ummm that is not surprising at all! Is it about Trump? Nope! Media remains silent!
This has to be why Trump is banning Tik Tok.
Imagine being this close to a Microsoft deal and losing it to a dumb Trump tweet
Trump the most clueless President in history.
Keep Storm clean. Don't get it dirty. And if you're Trump flag gets dirty. Wash it!! 🇺🇲😉👍... Good luck 👍 with your toy..
Ocasio-Cortez tries to stop housing rule as Trump plays to race
What I don’t understand is Trump’s actions and lack there of regarding the virus and protests are clearly someone who it not thinking competently or rationally but nothing is done.  Why?  Why our Federal Government not doing something!
Trump doing great things? He really is making a change in America? Idk but I’m sure there are more pressing issues you know 🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️😂
Trump is so busy handling the real issues in America he has time to ban  #thinkaboutit
Trump you live in LA LA land. Logic just isn't one of your strengths.
Oh sure, ban it right as I have a video hit 15,000 views. Typical.
lol "rare small pawed Trump"!
As a fellow former elected official, I appreciate your insight. Time to place over/under on Trump announcing he will not run in November.
Could the suspension of spending by the Trump campaign be a precursor to POTUS dropping out of the race? Look for negotiations for pardon and global non prosecution from state AG's.   and

Fine, don’t blame Trump. How about blaming Herman Cains own stupidity.
That’s sad may he Rest In Peace.  Another life taken by Trump.  Those who went to his campaign event in Texas yesterday ..don’t think this can’t be you.
Maybe you should worry about the Trump epidemic in the US.
Why is he so afraid of vote by mail?? Because the people who are smart enough to wear masks, stay home as much as they can and vote by mail are the people who don’t support Trump and are the ones he hasn’t taken out &amp; made sick yet!This here is the exact problem. That said, Trump's rise has correlated with increase in race based violence. He has to go
These two groups don't really overlap. People who like Trump do so because he reinforces their white identity politics. People on the left who don't like Biden do so because he's too much like Trump. Some of them will vote for him anyway, but almost none will vote Trump.

Utter rubbish. Even the typically fawning Washington Times knew the Trump “travel ban” was crap.
Actually that’s what I meant and didn’t express it right because I haven’t slept all night. One theory is that Biden will be proclaimed the winner and Trump will state that the elections were rigged through mailings. A stalemate will bring in the United Nations and military rule.

Pres. Trump laid out his plan for the executive order in a speech.  He accused Democrats of holding coronavirus stimulus negotiations "hostage," and said the order would defer payroll taxes until to the end of the year and be retroactive to July 1.
If Trump says his generals think it was a bomb, we assume that Trump misunderstood his generals. They will explain to their president today, very slowly and with pictures, what they meant and tomorrow Trump and friends will know more.
i thank you so much for everything you did for our country as a Greek American Democrat who is against trump i want you as our vice president

So they think they're all invincible from getting this virus? They don't seem to care if they do get it. Roll of the dice, Russian roulette. How irresponsible in not caring if they give the virus to someone else. Trump doesn't give a damn either. What a selfish, incompetent man.
I can’t help bet wonder if this fungus has infected Trump.

Yeah but when Biden opens his mouth, like he's done for the last 2 days (Are you a Junkie, All Blacks are the same)...he neutralizes Trump crazy talk with his.
The claim was Biden has a stutter.  It's not a stutter.  He's in a major, steep cognitive decline. He should not be running for president. This has nothing to do with Trump, other than people's hate for him bizarrely driving them to support a man clearly unfit, mentally, to lead.

I think Bolton is a sleazy traitor for refusing to testify at the impeachment. But I don’t think he’s a liar. And that stupid sanctions thing Trump did was in direct response to Bolton’s accusation. Plus Trump now wants to scapegoat China for coronavirus so... new plan. Typical.
We need to look back 200 years of US history to make Trump understand his mistakes.

Trump vowed to drain the swamp...... created Dante’s Inferno.
It would not surprised me But they can't control covid deaths and Trump was briefed in December and did nothing till MARCH 26th  .It makes him culpable.
I've been reading his posts for over a year. He's doing what it will take to give Trump the win, just so he can feel morally superior. I've been dealing with people like that for 40 years of charity work.

160,000 deaths due to Trump's incompetence and greed.He knew in December and did nothing.
Yep!!!! McConnell said the other day, if trump agrees , we will follow.
And if you knew it was a hyperbole than why you answer like I though Trump was going to cure it and not the researchers.
Too late, could Trump walk those words back
We will literally die if Trump is back in office and idk how ppl don’t see this. Biden has office experience under Obama’s administration. I don’t see how u can vote against someone who has been there.
This is the *opposition* to Trump. A good distillation of why people outside the US can’t breathe a sign of relief when Trump loses power.
He may not want to, but everything trump touches must die.
for Biden they are gaffs for trump he is a racist. Yeah we see you
Maybe Biden should change his policy and its wouldn't matter if he is attack people will still vote not a policy of am better than trump and am barack friend without any policy that benefit people .

Trump is culpable for 160,000 because he knew about the virus in December and did nothing till MARCH as of today .
As a Christian, I think Donald Trump is a perfect epitome of the seven deadly sins. Some Christians I know have suggested that he may be the Antichrist. I don’t go along, but only because I make Spock eyes at any suggestion that America is the center of the universe.

Instead, go with this: "...whose actions are completely at odds with the values and teachings of *my faith.*" It transitions into the following paragraph where Biden contrasts his faith and values from Trump's actions without the implication that Trump is "faking" it.
My only quibble is that  could have left off the part about Trump's actions being "at odds with the values and teaching that he professes to believe in." They're in fact directly in line with the values of a large segment of the American Christian Right.
From  statement: "My faith teaches me to walk humbly, while President Trump teargassed peaceful protestors so he could walk over to a church for a photo op."
I'm starting to think the establishment wanted Donald Trump to win.
This is a solid statement that doesn't make the mistake too many on the left make -- claiming Trump and his evangelical backers are "not a real Christians."  talks about how his faith guides HIM, which is different from saying his faith should drive policy.
Trump is not a Republican and you know it. He hijacked your party, insulted your father, brought disgrace to the presidency and ruined our reputation among other civilized nations.  What more do you need? Biden spoke at your father's funeral and the Trumps were asked to stay away

No I understood you just fine. Unlike the majority of the people on here, I have braincells. I just disagree that Trump isn't the worst possible candidate. Is Biden amazing? Do I want him to win? Fuck no. But another 4yrs of Trump would be far worse. Everyone has their opinions🤷🏻‍♀️
Lol had to redo that one, huh? And politicians are endorsed. This is not a secret. Do you really believe Trump hasn't taken money from anyone to fit their political agendas? If so I think it's about time someone told you that Santa isn't real, either 😕

Yeah, I've listened to Trump speak. My ears bled. Stupid runs deep with him.
There is no such thing as the silent majority since Trump didn’t win the popular vote. So really Trumpers are the silent minority!
All I see is when Trump and Biden go at each other.
He is an idiot. He should lock himself in the basement before he give the second term to Trump. Not that I want him to win but he is making easier for Trump every time he opens his mouth
I hate trump
Trump supporters so angry...battery on a child needs to raise the offense higher, when committed by an adult...maybe Trump can pardon him if he gets a speedy trial lol.
Hopefully calling Biden godless is enough for America. Trump is desperate &amp;, as he did during his campaign,will say every &amp; anything he can to try to win reelection. Trump doesnt counterpunch, he simply lies.He lied yesterday,he lied today &amp; will lie tomorrow. He is a liar. Vote.
He has excellent candidates that he can select from  as opposed to Trump who selected a man that defunded the needle exchange program during the aides epidemic.
Lord I pray that Lindsay gets send packing he has supported the fascist racist ideology of hate divisiveness and fear that Trump has caused in this country as well as 160,000 covid deaths.
Trump either gets you sick or kills you .We have 160,000 deaths as of today and he express well wishes his female pedophile friends but not condolences for the death due to covid.
Definitely  Trump is actually destroying the Republican party  and thats sad.
Trump the fascist with and ideology of hate divisiveness and fear let's not forget he is a racist who supports pedophiles but not dead Americans from covid 19.

She is a lawyer representing Trump in a frivolous lawsuit against a small TV station in Wisconsin.    is using  ‘s lawyers to get on the ballot. Is this what you want to be your godly legacy, Kanye?  cc
Real Americans live in cities and states. Show trump how much #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Exactly what you just said!
fuck donald trump. that’s it. that’s the tweet.
It's laughable  Trump '$puppet
Plus there’s so many counties that went from Obama to trump. Racists just magically appeared there I guess
Also doubt that there will be a war under Trump. Dude has dodged 5 wars within the first 4 years of his admiration. 2 of them being this year
Trump lawyer, Lane Ruhland, seen rushing petitions into Wisconsin courthouse to get you on the ballot.  If you’re so godly, ethical, &amp; say you’re “serious”about being president, Kanye, why are you using Trump’s lawyer?🤔 How will you explain this to your kids? cc
I have a job, I'm fine.   I'm fine helping others, but pre-existing conditions are covered by law already!!!  He just issued an executive order to force insurers to do something they already have to do, that's nuts!  Does that not bother you that Trump would do that?
Hm yes, wanting to create a better and faster process is  bad. Not to mention that our previous president, deported a significant more amount of immigrants than Trump has done.
A Black reporter is booed by a 99% white crowd... And Trump talks about protests.
Thank you President Donald Trump for everything you have been doing for America. Election Day , we put these assholes to shame. 🇺🇸
Trump signs Obamacare.   Seems to be a requirement to either be stupid or amoral to work for Trump.
🛑Trickledown Trump&amp;Repub' leader dont-care.*rep Susan Collins says relief bill is dead on arrival urges dems 2 be more realistic. 😲TELL THE AMERICAN🇺🇸PEOPLE WHO CANT FEED OR PAY THEIR RENT&amp;MORTGAGES.*TO MORE REALISTIC.*SHE HAS FOOD&amp;HER BILLS ARE PAYED.
And a few have no masks, ALL are not socially distant, and truly give no fucks about anything. VOTE OUT THE REPUBLICANS in November and VOTE OUT TRUMP THE DUMP 💩
It’s a Friday night. Regular people aren’t following this. But Trump announcing he’s going to sign an EO doing something Obamacare already does, while he’s simultaneously trying to repeal Obamacare, is the dumbest thing. And he thinks we’re all dumb enough to go along with it.
🛑Bunker Putin puppet Trump, Moscow Mitch McConnell,yes-man Mark Meadows&amp;Repub'leaders  want 2 cut unemployment from $600to$200.*They're worried about someone receiving $1.00 dollars more than they should receive. 😔while millions of Americans suffer.
In 2016 Trump said he heard Putin call Obama the "N" word! I don't remember the press investigating this and reporting on it. Maybe it's because the press calls Obama the  "N" word too!
Trump going to issue and executive order demanding insurance companies cover pre-existing conditions.  Obama made insurance companies unable to deny patients with pre-existing conditions in 2009.
Trump and Thanos had this planned all along!!
Sooooo what’s the point of this Trump waste of TV time? I thought Fridays were for pointless political news dumps.
Donald Trump bragging about job numbers the last 3 months is like the guy who brags about scoring 15 points in the 4th quarter when his team was losing by 160,000 dead people
If Donald Trump the politician ever runs into Donald Trump the businessman things might get awkward.
I am having an even harder time than normal understanding wtf Trump is saying right now
In addition.... as Trump keeps vomiting the words “China Virus’ where are the Asians raising their voices? Where are the effin* K-Pop stars? Hear my words &gt;  After this crack-head will be done blaiming  “Gina” ... he will come after all Asians. Silence is not an option. Fight.
I purchased call of duty WWII last month to do a Trump gaming video thia month😁

🤔ANY FOREIGN🌏COUNTRY INVOLVED IN MESSING AROUND IN AMERICA🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 DEMOCRACY.*(KNOWINGLY)* ***SHOULD BE ACT OF WAR.
That's what we do. Dems are seen as weak and don't want to fight! That's why the news takes a heavier hand with us. Hill's emails a perfect example. 2016 Trump said Putin called Obama the N word. ALL the media was there. Have you heard about it?
This staged press conference in Bedminster with entitled members of the club while people are STRUGGLING to eat and pay bills.  You should be ashamed ⁦
What is the Sham Wow guy doing with trump?
The kind of people who would spend $100,000s to join one of Trump’s golf clubs look exactly the way I imagined they would.
So, so sad. Welcome to Trump’s America. Had enough yet?
Why do I get the feeling that both those pronunciations have also only ever been uttered by Trump
He’s trying to give himself an exit ramp from the crazy train that is the Trump presidency.

I’ve never felt safe lol especially in the last 3 years. Now trump is saying he going to deploy his secret police to more cities. Been spending a lot more time at the range and hitting the heavy bag.
When a reporter asks him a question he doesn’t like  &amp; he pulls his press pass.  You &amp; I will never agree on this subject or any other that  includes Trump.  God Bless America if Trump gets in again.

Imagine? He should do it. He should do every single thing trump did to steal an election. The game has changed, either get with it or get left behind.
If you feel Trump is the answer to the mess our country is in then vote him back in. But I can’t believe you think this incompetent, mentally Ill , dictator is the answer to our future.
Quite shocking really,    and  are Trump sycophants at worst and enablers at best.

Let’s see how this is perceived by those who demanded the schools close and Trump was killing kids/teachers.
Sad, yes. Dinesh is not even hiding the fact that he abhors poor or disadvantaged Americans. Hysterical that he thinks that Trump is a “cosmopolitan”. Trump is just a racist idiot in an expensive suit.
pretending Thighland was a Guided by Voices lyrics reference and not more Trump-dementia nonsense yesterday was a winning strategy, now I can't stop thinking Cardi B's new track is about Women Against Pornography. this gloss actually works well! sort of.
As soon Trump leaves twitter i’m leaving too🇺🇸
The only pervert &amp; rapist is our President!  Trump Must go to restore our values as Americans.
You got to be kidding I don’t even recognize my country anymore!  Trump has made the United States a joke  in the eyes of the world.

Look at Trump!! He has a list a mile long of slurs to every ethnic group! Difference is he is one of the most prejudiced ever! Tell the truth just once!

Trump is more concerned about his "ratings" than anything else.  He went chasing the adornment of "patriots" instead of the health well being of the US  constituency and the economy.

It is sad. Sad that somehow  manages to castigate and disparage most of Trump’s actual base while pandering and slaving like a deluded sycophant. He has labeled being poor &amp; w/o means to travel as less than
What do you make of the idea that Trump keeps people angry and engaged? I feel a lot of centrist libs go to sleep when they vote and then everything “goes back to normal” and they dont actually pressure the prez. What do you think?
“Can be interpreted many ways” you said it can be taken in almost any context... a vast majority of his supporters take his words at face value. Why you crying about the media? These are my opinions after watching trump himself, not some media shill.
Tell it trump is president and watch it turn tail...
Given Trump's real estate history "Shlock Home Syndrome" might be more appropriate if less topical...
Trump calls virus a “hoax” &amp; says about 50 times that “the virus will disappear.” His supporters: “he doesn’t actually mean the words he repeats every week!”
I've never heard “Yo-rup." It's amazing that you think it's the majority pronunciation. It's not supported by dictionaries. If you are going by your own ear, maybe there's some sort of defect? Or are you trolling everybody for some perverse reason? Deflect attention from Trump?

The Trump campaign is basically the "Ed Good, Rocko Bad" episode of Rocko's Modern Life.
The mental gymnastics these assholes go through just so they can believe trump is the first president in history to not lie... “from an analytical standpoint” potus speaks like a third grade child.
Biden is far, far from perfect—seriously flawed, in fact—but Trump is dangerous, and the scary part is that fascist regimes always come to power with the consent of part of the population and the indifference of another part. (end)
I could go on but the little I’ve written about Trump is a chapter of an authoritarian regime playbook, and an introduction to how fascist regimes get consolidated.  (20)
Donald Trump has called on Federal authorities to crush people protest, going as far as calling Blacks Matter a “terrorist group,” with the legal and law enforcement implications that could lead to.(19)
Donald Trump is courting white supremacists with a “eye wink” as he continues to repeat their conspiracy theories and dismisses their role in racial unrest. (18)
Donald Trump using the office of the Presidency to serve and promote his and his family’s businesses, as well as business he finds friendly. Donald Trump is vilifying legitimate media, referring to them in perfect Dictator language as “enemies of the people.” (17)
Donald Trump has, and continues to hire white supremacists in his administration, giving people power to limit voting rights and defund public schools as well as other under the table dealings not as prevalent as gaffes shared on social media platforms.(16)
Donald Trump is systemically attempting to discredit the system of voting, especially in areas he finds unfriendly, in order to maintain and consolidate his personal power.  (15)
Donald Trump pardons convicted felons who he has a personal interest in keeping out of the justice system. (14)
Donald Trump is systemically purging the Justice Department of all independent career employees. He’s doing that to shield HIMSELF from investigation and oversight, and using it to investigate his political enemies, with an end-goal of prosecution. (13)
But politics being politics, Biden was also USED by Barak Obama. Obama needed those ‘working class’ white folks, some of them bigoted, to win. Joe spoke their language--no different than a heathen Donald Trump choosing a religious fanatic Pence to the white evangelical vote.(11)
Another translation is Trump thinks God is weak. Where are the hardcore Christian Trumpers
Donald Trump is basically Job from Arrested Development except instead of doing magic, he raped.  And "we" made him President.
Note: Donald Trump never apologizes.
Secretly supporting President Trump?
I think we are all in the same boat. Generalized anxiety over the state of the US and the world. Trump must go. Life will be so much better then. Hang in there! We’re all in this together.
The “let shit fix itself” plan has gotten how many unemployed and how many more dead? Think about this, we have a vaccine for the flu but that shit still sticks around. What makes you think the trump virus is going to disappear?
So Donny Dingleberry is as horrible as advertised, and Joe Biden is smart because he delegates, empowering his staffers to do their jobs?   Also, have you seen Donny "Yo Semite Yo Semites" "Thigh land" Trump speak recently?
Opie your mayor and governor, and others, chose to play politics instead of managing the crisis. HCQ was recommended by doctors all over the world who were finding success with it. Once Trump brought attention to that the liberals made the drug a political issue, costing lives.

Ok but what exact are we going to do about Trump. How can we be sure he won’t get another 4 years?

I’m old enough to remember when trump promised 15 times to replace Obamacare...
How many times did trump say he’d replace Obamacare?
Something about Trump entices these guys. Why? I can’t understand it at all. Is it the porn prostitutes? Is it the 6 bankruptcies and Deutsche Bank still willing to lend $$$? Is it’s Trump way of constantly lying and shifting the blame? Is it the beauty pageants? Whaaaaat?
I had Obamacare thinking it was god and opted out after paying $475 a month. Twitter sends out the most ridiculous shit. Stop being anti Trump and your going against your own platform for deleting people’s accounts. You guys suck and should be sued big time
This time Trump will win the electoral college by another very small margin based on in-person voting. Biden will win in a landslide if ONLY The mail had been a little faster. But the mail will not be fast enough.

I agree , these people hide behind the abortion story I’m Catholic and know a lot of older Catholics who do the same thing. trump could literally murder someone and they would use the same excuse and vote for him . I think most people are pro choice not pro abortion .
So many things wrong in this post. 1)Trump hasn’t started any war, economical or not.  2)People said we could go to the moon, look where we are at now. 3)Pure anti-American Doctrine. As most who read this take it as an absolute truth and not opinion as clearly stated. God help us
I thought I was the only one this observation of deception by McConnell and Republicons in an attempt to make their incompetent ignorant hate and fear mongering lying pretentious wannabe lifelong criminal conman Donald Trump looks like a saviour for American lives he devastated.
Trump, one step ahead, always.
No one, no English speaker calls Thailand "Thighland". Please stop. You are EMBARRASSING yourself. Trump even corrected himself after his error calling it Thailand. It must be so exhausting running in circles playing damage control for this clown. 😅😅
The truth is only uncomfortable to those who are Blinded and motivated by Hate Fear Lies Ignorance Bluster and unprecedented Hyprocracy and Arrogance by Republicon politicians the likes of Trump/McConnell who's policies are tailored to greedy billionaires and bloated corporations
Ha!  He hasn’t done anything!  And I’m not a liberal. And Trump is not a conservative. He’s an incompetent conman.  You want him to be what he says he is, but he’s not. He hasn’t built a wall; Mexico hasn’t paid for it; Hillary is not in jail; Obamagate is not a thing.
The mental gymnastics these assholes go through just so they can believe trump is the first president in history to not lie... “from an analytical standpoint” potus speaks like a third grade child.
Biden is far, far from perfect—seriously flawed, in fact—but Trump is dangerous, and the scary part is that fascist regimes always come to power with the consent of part of the population and the indifference of another part. (end)
I could go on but the little I’ve written about Trump is a chapter of an authoritarian regime playbook, and an introduction to how fascist regimes get consolidated.  (20)
Donald Trump has called on Federal authorities to crush people protest, going as far as calling Blacks Matter a “terrorist group,” with the legal and law enforcement implications that could lead to.(19)
Donald Trump is courting white supremacists with a “eye wink” as he continues to repeat their conspiracy theories and dismisses their role in racial unrest. (18)
Donald Trump using the office of the Presidency to serve and promote his and his family’s businesses, as well as business he finds friendly. Donald Trump is vilifying legitimate media, referring to them in perfect Dictator language as “enemies of the people.” (17)
Donald Trump has, and continues to hire white supremacists in his administration, giving people power to limit voting rights and defund public schools as well as other under the table dealings not as prevalent as gaffes shared on social media platforms.(16)
Donald Trump is systemically attempting to discredit the system of voting, especially in areas he finds unfriendly, in order to maintain and consolidate his personal power.  (15)
Donald Trump pardons convicted felons who he has a personal interest in keeping out of the justice system. (14)
Donald Trump is systemically purging the Justice Department of all independent career employees. He’s doing that to shield HIMSELF from investigation and oversight, and using it to investigate his political enemies, with an end-goal of prosecution. (13)
But politics being politics, Biden was also USED by Barak Obama. Obama needed those ‘working class’ white folks, some of them bigoted, to win. Joe spoke their language--no different than a heathen Donald Trump choosing a religious fanatic Pence to the white evangelical vote.(11)
Donald Trump is basically Job from Arrested Development except instead of doing magic, he raped.  And "we" made him President.

You are dealing with frustrated and deranged people, hence all the rioting.When thier radical leftist ideas don’t pan out and are unpopular with normal ppl you need to turn towards violence.Of course they blame this on trump. They are too predictable.
See this is the problem. Everybody thinks he’s slipping.   When  said “He’s against God”, Trump believes that.  Because Trump (in his mind) believes he’s God.
They’ll find another platform to mess with Trump. No worries.
He wishes maxwell “well” because she has stuff on him &amp; wants her to stay quiet. Remember the court docs for the 13yr old who claimed Trump/Epstein together assaulted her? The claims were so unbelievable at the ⏰ but now they match everything we’ve learned frm the Epstein case?

You do realize Trump corrected himself after and said it properly the second time right?  With this level of stupidity you try to pass off as logic and intelligence, I can see how you ended up a convicted criminal
I will withhold my judgement on Trump &amp; Navarro's tariffs until I hear from Dr. Fauci. It's only fair since Navarro, an economist, feels compelled to weigh in on hydroxychloroquine and medical responses to the pandemic.
Please explain this to me.  How can Trump stop private companies from doing business?  They are not regulated by the government.
Notwithstanding your clear lie that it wasn't covered by MSNBC or CNN, the clear takeaway is that once the "controversy" was reported, he clarified his position quickly and with humility. Try comparing that to Trump and any of his gaffes, mispronunciations or outright lies.

Folks say it’s the low-information voter. Trump said, “I love the uneducated,” with good reason.

We’re splitting hairs here, but if we really want to be specific, then the Biden campaign offered no meaningful good-faith concessions—&amp; in the context of a negotiation, I think it’s very reasonable to say that this is effectively the same thing as offering no concessions at all
We already had eight years of everything getting progressively worse under Biden &amp; Obama, &amp; all liberals did was gaslight the public and blame the GOP, because they don’t even want to understand what the problem is—they want to remain comfortable &amp; feel like they’re right

Okay well when you say things like this it doesn’t come across at all like ironic participation meant to mock how shitty the candidates are, it sounds like you’re arguing in favor of voting for Biden &amp; Harris because of like some ridiculous harm reduction bullshit
Joe Biden: how badly would you like to be VP?  Kamala Harris: 😮
Like millions are right now losing their fucking homes &amp; being thrown out on the street, and a whole hell of a lot of them aren’t going to be able to feed their families or afford medication—what do we say to them? “Wait until Biden’s in office &amp; hope we can push him left”
Why would you ever in a million years believe that liberals would do anything under a Biden presidency except make excuses for his crackdown on protestors, the same exact way they make excuses for him now &amp; the same exact way they made excuses for Obama
It’s not pushing Democrats left, it’s seizing back power &amp; demanding compliance—it’ll be just as crucial under a Biden administration as it will under Trump, and the crackdown retaliation we’ll have to anticipate, prepare for &amp; deal with will be exactly the same in either case
The Dems are pushing Biden &amp; Harris explicitly because they won’t move left—everything from welcoming Republicans like George W. Bush &amp; John Kasich into the party to fully embracing the Lincoln Project are as clear an indicator as you could ask for that they’re only moving right
It’s gonna keep going up now, Biden’s too
Well he’s a Biden supporter in the sense that he seems to genuinely believe in the system that produced the Biden/Harris ticket, and in how he keeps arguing that there’s some sort of actual honest-to-god value in the idea of trying to push Biden left after the election
“Trump has to be stopped, he’s a dictator with no respect for the law willing to do anything to stay in power—he could very well lose the election &amp; still refuse to leave the White House”  Oh shit oh god what should we do  “Vote for Biden”  Ok but—  “Shut the fuck up &amp; do it”
So wait are you saying that by recognizing how Biden’s objectively as terrible as Trump, it means I still think the election matters  I’m honestly asking because it doesn’t make any more sense now than it did the first time you said it &amp; I feel like I must be misunderstanding you
This is one is one tradition that should never be stopped. Deblasio is being run by his radical wife and daughter just like Biden will be run by Camelo
1.) She doesn’t represent progress—she’s every bit as awful as Clinton  2.) Democrats have been making empty promises for decades &amp; Biden served eight years alongside one of the worst offenders  3.) Removing those statues saved how many lives &amp; abolished how many police forces
Racists don't patronize inferiors. By '16 urban jobs were oversees &amp; Illegals were scooping up the dregs. Trump went after jobs, illegals plus enterprise zones. Cities are working. Racist like Biden don't give 2nd chances, just life sentences. Trump listens.
I’ll add for good measure (in order to make fun of how pathetic and entitled Joe Kennedy III is) that JFK was the first of many austerity Dems which morphed into the Corporate Neoliberalism of Bill Clinton, Obama, and Joe Biden that pervades the party today.
I’m holding a grudge for the rest of my life whether Biden wins or not.

REAL?? The short video released Aug. 9 on the Demo Nat'l Convention’s Twitter account. Biden's use of nuns as an inspirational example of “generosity to others” comes despite his promise to renew legal action against the Little Sisters of the Poor should he win election.
Stupid move to allow something as serious as a vote for President to be so casually generated as a mailed paper to all homes with no security.  Next mail in diplomas, drivers' license, and home generated birth certificates.  Cheap shot for Biden.

Only a fool would think any politician doesn’t, Biden is even worse, like his running mate Kameltoe
Nice try. Every major Dem supported both those wars. especially Biden. In fact most still do. Read a book Mr Attorney
This is just wrong. He was asked about and he said he didn't know and that he was sure that she was appropriately vetted by Biden. You facing people are horrible!!!
Biden, uh  Biden chose Kamala Harris because she was the only other candidate as far right as he is, and this isn’t a slippery slope into anything except Kamala being in the White House for three straight terms as Republicans complete their takeover of the party
Those reporters are so disrespectful,  the President calls on everyone, you have #Biden picking and choosing reporters, then needs a script for the softball questions he gets😡😡, the msm is so putrid, I am so tired of their hate!!
Wonder what he'd do if you were Biden's or Harris' guest at the debates?
That’s all you’re saying now—earlier you were arguing that there’s some sort of realistic possibility that Biden &amp; Harris give even a single solitary fuck what the people want
So am I, Mr Biden.
Well when you’re arguing that you can push Biden &amp; Harris left once they’re in office when literally all they’ve done is move further &amp; further right in the lead up to the election where they still need our votes to actually win, then yeah wishcasting is exactly what you’re doing
For 50 years, Biden has been lying, plagiarizing, &amp; stretching the truth on a daily basis. Harris is just the same. When Biden gets caught he gets louder and threatens sit up fights.
So give it to Biden to kill more people get life long judges that oppose our pro-choice values?
Omg yes! They are already laying the groundwork with the ant  Biden website bs yesterday 😂😂
It’s just like the previews/opener at any movie/concert....Biden is the opener you pay little mind to bc Kamala is the main performer
Of course if Biden wins, the Republicans in 2021 will suddenly discover that Article II gives the president almost no power. And if Dems take both houses, they'll find that Article I is also toothless. That'll leave Article III, but only for right-wing judges.
Hey  you should give  MORE speaking time than to billionaires and never-Trump Republicans. As well as to other speakers who appeal to younger voters.  Biden's biggest weakness is among young voters. Why not use the convention to help fix that?
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  via
Biden already tried that Trish. Haven't you seen the commercial were he plagiarize's President Trump's AmericaFirst? "Buy American". "Hire American". I always have trouble getting off the floor from laughing so hard. When Biden says it. Then GND that would destroy jobs.🤣🤣
It doesn't matter what Biden says,  they don't arrest criminals who loot and burn things, NOBODY will even pay attn to that. Yawn.
did BIDEN AND HARRIS SAY WEAR MASKS for the next 3 MONTHS?? Ummm that’s the November election 😂🤣 what a joke #Trump2020
These sound bites of Biden they hunted for to make him seem confused still do not approximate the default incoherence of Trump's every spoken statement.
“Biden is exactly the same” - Twitter idiots
Typical Biden Blabber.
Joe Walsh , should know that Tucker Carlson pronounced Kamala's first name exactly as joe biden does.
I’m voting for Biden as a harm reduction measure. Nothing more. I do not support the Democrat party or their candidate. The Democrats won’t fix shit, they’ll just stop making it worse as quickly.
&amp; if you want further evidence that Harris was indeed the “safe” choice, look no further than the very positive reaction of stocks in S&amp;P, Nasdaq. Up baby! Investors don’t see Biden/Harris doing much to hurt their profits. Warren on the other hand...Now that would’ve been bold
Zerlina, I strongly disagree. Nor, do I think it was “bold” as  said yest. Biden is ol’ school but he ain’t stupid. He knows which way wind is blowing - who saved HIM. Folks like me would’ve REVOLTED if he DID NOT pick a BLACK woman.The TIMES pushed Biden to Harris.
I believe Kamala Harris will be doing some heavy lifting...
The senior vote will result in a Biden win theoretically, but the problem is that the incumbent will challenge results in all ythose states to force a contingent election.
Kamala Harris woke up today a different person.   The fake news media named her a moderate.  She is no longer a dirty cop.  They forgot to tell joe biden before he picked her.   What a nasty trick .
You're not being honest with yourself if you say Biden is in a good mental state.
This should be the Biden-Harris campaign slogan.
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia
Again—there is absolutely no reason to believe this  Literally everything about Biden’s career, his campaign, his VP—all of it makes clear in no uncertain terms that Biden &amp; Harris will be moving nowhere after being elected except further right  So what are you basing this on
I said something! When I saw she said Biden will not make it in November, I said to myself, what a dumb comment she said on live tv! Fox needs to fire her
why didn’t you televise any of the Biden/Harris campaign speech?
The Kamala Harris pick: Did Democrat Joe Biden slip on his second banana?
Sometimes comedy write's itself. Sometimes reality helps. Then there's Biden/Harris.
They’re the same to everyone for whom nothing will fundamentally change  Literally the only difference is that Trump’s a loose cannon, so corporate media goes after him when he undermines the interests of the donor class—but as with Obama &amp; Bush, they’ll be complicit under Biden
Biden has already spent months surrounding himself with Wall Street execs, he’s got right-wing bigot John Kasich speaking at the convention, he still refuses to push for single-payer during a global pandemic crisis &amp; this is all when he still needs our votes to get elected
I'm not voting for Biden but doesn't the fact that she has to "rebound" from her record beg the question...Why? If she did an ethical job and followed her conscience, why must she defend what she did? Again. I'm no fan of hers but this is what we do now and its wrong.
Biden is old and senile, and a Pedophil, but she is as dumb as a doorknob, prison parents of children for truancy, while leaving her junkies on the street., she only knows one way to get a head! Head😂😭😅🤣😆😜🤪🤡 she is dumber than most 16 year olds!
No. he means Biden.
It's Biden. Of course not
What a terrible vp pick. Not a single voter would change their mind for Biden because of her.
Everyone I've heard &amp; spoken to,seems to think Kamala Harris is a nasty woman. She sounds condescending. She said some pretty rotten things about Joe Biden himself. She says what suits her own success. I don't think I'm the only American that has this opinion.
I watched your speech after you were announced as Biden's VP. I know there wasn't a large audience there while you were speaking that could adequately communicate to you the incredible sense of joy we feel. You should know many of us stood up at home &amp; gave U a standing ovation!
Intelligence is wasted on him anyway. Trump has pretty much eliminated daily intelligence briefings. Biden has already started receiving them.
Funny you should mention that, it and being a woman are the only two qualifications anyone on the left and most notably Joe Biden has mentioned. You know why? So that unless you say she is perfect in every way the  you’re racist/sexist chorus will be deafening! So transparent!
If and it's a big IF Biden/Harris win Biden won't last a month after election decision.
⁦I’m all in after hearing  today. #BidenHarris2020
Yeah just not for Trump or Biden
LMFAO! Obama/Biden economy was based on taxpayer funding, doubled the National Debt and still had high employment, low workforce participation, huge number on food stamps. Nice try!
Has anyone else notice for two days ( since Biden’s announcement) major cable news networks have not covered trumps press conferences????
Did you say “people that can speak in sentences” that’s pretty good, you were including #Biden in that? That’s even better!
Kamala Harris: Countries rush to celebrate Biden's running mate
That statement alone should be the end of Biden/Harris campaign.
you hate politics then you go on to discredit Biden for attending a Klansman’s funeral without mentioning it was Robert Byrd’s funeral who had 52 years of public service where McConnell gave an eulogy and where every Republican leader praised the former Senator.
If there are two ppl to easily take to apart, it's heels up Kamala and that doddering old fool Biden.  I mean really,  they are just empty shells. If it wasn't for the podium panels for ole Joe to read, he'd still be stuttering. C'mon man. 😂😂😂🤣
A vote against someone is still a vote for someone, and I refuse to vote for someone I don’t believe in. We keep getting shit options because they just believe we have to take what we can get. Trump is a reflection of the country and it’s been exposed, but Biden in office just -
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Overconfidence kills. Don’t be cocky. We hope that Biden/Harris wins, it would be incredible and might save democracy, though it’s probably too late for that. 🤞🏼
I disagree with you about Biden being a decent man. I must say though I would never guess you to be Biden's age. You look like you might be in your early sixties. Biden looks like he's about 90
Listening to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris reintroduce to America what true leadership and moral character sounds like.  Tune in if you can...  there may actually be a light at the end of this horrific Trump administration.
When will you give a reason not to vote for Biden-Harris?
Awesome pick by Biden. Proud of this party. Time to put the racists back in the bottle.
I'm surprised you weren't marching with those klansmen in Charlottesville Biden with your record on race

Who chose this music for Biden/Harris?  "Yes We Can Can' by the Pointer Sisters? Haven't heard that in a minute!
And isn’t Kamala a rape apologist for accepting the offer? She is on record saying she believes Biden’s accusers and respects them for coming forward.
Do you have any idea how thoroughly you embarrass yourself by Saying conservative network exists to tear down Joe Biden is there an equivalent for Trump? Perhaps the single most disingenuous hypocritical audible feces ever dropped from any orafice anywhere ever in history!
Hammonton has strong ties to both parties' presidential candidates-- as  pointed out today, it is Jill Biden's hometown; it is also
“People are dying” becauseee of our for-profit healthcare system Joe vows to protect.  “The earth is dying” becauseee the Obama/Biden administration felt signing a piece of paper was enough. And now Joe won’t even support major climate action.  Tired? More like dead in 10 years.
It’s very convenient for Biden to be having memory issues. Ukraine
Fuck Trump Fuck Biden Fuck FOX News Fuck CNN Fuck everyone Fuck the human race We all deserve to burn and die #NoLivesMatter
Let the best woman/man team win!! Biden/Harris...
And CNN and MSNBC will ignore them as they broadcast Trump claiming Biden and Harris are hiding in their respective basements.
I would agree on the one hand, but on the other hand, I think Biden will obliterate him. Trump can be utterly destroyed from 99 different directions.  The fat man can't think on his feet, and he has no substance to stand on, so...
I agree with  . Biden is to much of a coward to take a solid position and stand up for it. His eel like backbone will become more evident over time. Add this to all of the other Biden issues he'll really prove to be presidential. NOT
so y’all really voting for Coonmala and “you ain’t blacc” Biden? 👀👀
I think it just might be the simple reason. Biden stupidly &amp; cowardly boxed himself in to a women of color. Give me a credible option significantly better than Harris. None of them, including Harris, are qualified. All have baggage
Bucks County white woman here and I cannot wait to vote for Biden/Harris!
Good morning FB family, so it’s Biden &amp; Harris...45 is stewing now trying his best to do what he does just make up stuff and throw it on the wall to see what sticks....but it’s too late now...let’s say this together to 45.....November is coming....November is coming.....!
I can't believe  is actually going to cover anything related to Biden--they will they cut away immediately if Trump sneezes and tells them to air it.  All evening long the entertainment personalities bash Trump, but structurally, MSNBC and CNN are Trump allies.
I am thrilled with Kamala as the VP choice but Jim Clyburn just said on CNN that a lot of people did not support her for President because they wanted to see her as Biden’s. VP, wow, what a sad fucking statement that says about those black folks.
He just listed a lot of reasons to support the Biden/Harris ticket
I believe Harris will have an effect on the election. Half of Democrats don't think Biden will make it through his first term. The question is, does anyone really believe Kamala Harris can run our country? She was already run out of the primaries very early on
Which is what, exactly?
Joe Biden is only the 4th catholic nominee for president, and the first catholic Vice President
Joe Biden isn’t catholic? Are you sure about that?
Harris is not your problem Donald Dump Biden is stop your racist rant on Harris and concentrate on Biden.
Kamala Harris is an opportunist who will sell her soul for power.  Just like Biden did.  Guess she no longer cares if he fears kids growing up in a racial jungle.
Kamala Harris may choose to laugh at everything, but i don't think she is funny at all.She laughs at her withholding exonerating evidence in case of death row inmate.    Life with biden is not funny.
She should be easy to beat.  She adds nothing to Biden's bid.   Nasty to the core.  don't be surprised if she leads his impeachment team.
Biden picks the weakest mate, Kamala is the most acerbic candidate. Why?  It takes one to know one.
Why are so many Trump supporters outraged by this? Y’all keep saying that trump is gonna win, so why do you care so much about who Biden picked?
What ever happened to  She would of been the perfect VP pick and could easily take over for Biden.
by Oct 15, Joe Biden will leave the ticket and K Harris will decide that for him.   Be ready, America.  Amazing how many young people are ready to endorse him and her without any understanding at all.
You were on my timeline!!!  LOL lowest unemployment,  opportunity zones, fully funded HBCUs, prison reform, first step act. More than Obama/Biden did in 8 years!!!  Actions, not words!!
Trump's last TV ad lied and claimed Biden supported defunding the police. He doesn't. Trump's latest ad lies again and claims Biden will keep kids out of school for four years. He won't. Trump lies about everything and his cult follows their leader. A sociopath's culture.
Biden didn't pick Kneepads Harris - someone else did
Tears in my eyes😥but so much love and hope in my heart!! Thank you President Biden and VP Harris❤️❤️ 💙💙💙💙💙💙
Biden is a life long Catholic.  What do you call Trump?
Maya Rudolph reacts to Kamala Harris as Biden's VP pick, her SNL return
Biden won the nomination. He’s not who I wanted, either...but a second trump victory is unacceptable
I don’t think Biden can serve 2 terms, his vp needed to be a candidate that could be elected in 24
But that didn’t happen, and our option is Biden/Harris vs trump/pence. I’m pretty secure in my choice
I am so excited! Biden - Harris 2020!! 🎉
I’d be voting for the Biden-anybody ticket, but I am a big fan of  she’s the candidate I supported during the primary season, I was sad she dropped out before I could cast a vote for her in PA, but I will cast a vote for her in November
I feel like Biden is already on life support
HELL YA I'VE VOTING FOR BIDEN !
Choosing Kamala is such a poorly thought out decision. Like, yeah I don’t care who it is anyway, but Biden choosing a cop is so unsurprising and seems not thought out
I’m supporting Joe Biden for president because he’ll be a steadfast advocate for our nation’s public school students and educators.   Will you pledge to support Joe, too?
Where have you been?  Biden announced it this afternoon.
It’s so weird to see sensible conservatives back the Biden campaign.  Shows we aren’t so divided.
#foxnews  Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. Forget about it.  President Trump 2020!
how can you honestly defend Joe Biden? Can't you see he's out of his mind? Probably early dementia? How can you defend him on TV? What's wrong with you? And Trump will fix our economy just like he made it the strongest in 50 years
Just to be clear, You are the same person who about a year ago was in agreement that the women coming forward against Biden were telling the truth. Can we expect this type of wishy washy behavior in office as well? hard pass thanks. #Trump2020
Biden selects “Headboard Harris” , yep it’s over....
Biden chose Harris..  who are you picking for VP? #WhereisPence #Trump2020
Go to your bunker and stay there till biden throws you out
Biden /Harris- best bet from all perspectives.👍💘
Team Biden all the way!!!
Kamala Harris will cause Joe Biden to lose votes due to her actions regarding Al Franken.
That’s Right Joe Biden 🇺🇸
Only a short time will prove that Biden did not have anything to say about his running mate.  She was selected by the party leaders, and will soon move to remove him from the ticket.   It is not a thing yet.
We're going to beat you and Biden. The silent majority is much stronger than you know.
Yup. Circa 2023, when Biden gets the 25th Amendment invoked.
Congratulations! Biden-Harris....the only choice for those who care about Democracy.
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
GREAT TICKET!!!! I knew it would be no matter what, but this is what I was hoping for.   Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Very ironic that the WWF wrestler "Kamala", real name James Harris, died a few days ago, and Kamala Harris is selected as Biden's running mate today.
The funny thing is, Trump bashed Biden today for committing to a female VP, so...
I want a Biden-Harris sticker, and I want it NOW!
We need a return to sanity! Vote Biden/Harris!!
Biden picks Harris for VP -
reminder.....there are no unicorns in politics.....Biden could have picked a bologna sandwich and I’d still vote for him.... Trump must be defeated!!  Period!!  Full Stop!!
They’re just a waste of human flesh but now it’s Biden and Harris let go!!!!🤣🤣
Biden on cusp of historic running mate announcement
Guess what the excuse will be for Dems doing absolutely nothing during a Biden administration?  1) Russia/China.  2) The GOP is impeaching Joe so there’s literally nothing he can do during a 2-year debacle.  3) Finding “middle-ground” with Republicans trying to impeach him.  🤷🏻‍♂️
Three of Biden's potential picks pose a serious threat to him.  Word is already out that if one of those 3 not yet to be identified, is selected she will be a force leading the Impeach Biden effort within one month of the inauguration.   Be careful, Joe.
Ban Biden.......  Hey Joe, you still have the AR-14?
U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) will will be one of the speakers at next week’s Democratic National Convention. He will address the convention remotely on Aug. 20, the same night Joe Biden accepts his party’s nomination, officials announced today.
Seeing both "Biden's VP" and "Sarah Palin" trending at the same time scared me for a second.
Monmouth poll: Biden holds 10-point lead over Trump -
The reason why I'm predicting a 269-269 tie again this year is because Biden was one of the servants of Clinton, Bush, and Obama who created the conditions that resulted in trump getting elected. The old testament is being repeated here. 7 years of feast then 7 years of famine.
I think it would be incredibly helpful for somebody to walk you through why Biden’s means-tested “free college” plan is incredibly inefficient &amp; so needlessly complicated that it will inevitably exclude a significant number of the very families it’s ostensibly designed to help
I was wondering when that was going to go up, Biden is up 8 now
But it is what the majority wants  Biden’s plan is corporate welfare that does nothing but perpetuate our already-unsustainable private for-profit system  Grow up—just because he won the primary doesn’t mean he’s entitled to votes without doing anything to actually earn them
So no, “most people” do not prefer Biden’s plan
&amp; I totally appreciate yours, Korte. I’m so thru w/ neoliberalism too. Phrases/words I now hate: “building on Obamacare” - excuse to block M4ALL. Susan Rice - love her sass but enough. Biden “knows us” - taking base for granted. 4 More Yrs of Trump- nothing compares to this virus
"At a moment of crisis America is cursed with a president who is incompetent, deeply ignorant, yet so personally insecure that he surrounds himself with people who tell him he’s a universal genius."  Paul Krugman Vote Biden...

Biden’s ramble???!  Have you heard Trump speak.
This shit is even more horrifying in the midst of an actual honest-to-god global pandemic  If Biden is genuinely serious about winning this election he has to adopt a sweeping single-payer Medicare for All system—it’s such a no brainer and there’s literally no reason not to do it
Most people do not prefer Biden’s plan &amp; are in fact sick &amp; tired of having to ration their own care &amp; medication or go bankrupt because their copays &amp; deductibles have been spiraling out of control for decades while their coverage shrinks exponentially
If Biden wants to win, he has to adopt Medicare for All—it’s incredibly popular &amp; an overwhelming majority of Americans want it  Unless we force him to do it in order to earn our votes, Trump wins  So if you really want Trump out, why are you fighting so hard to get him reelected
It certainly does matter. ESPECIALLY if Biden doesn't finish his 1st week in office. Because of cognitive problems.
You mean like a 3 years of corrupt media, democrats incl.Obama/Biden and FBI droning a Russia collusion mantra echoing off each other to seem corroborative till many believe it so blindly that even a mountain of evidence proving it was a lie doesn’t phase them? Some expert
You have to go back to Ancient Israel. The House of Ahab is comprised of Ahab (Clinton), Jezebel (Hillary), Jehoram (Obama) and one of Jehoram's servants (Biden). Jehu (Trump) beat Jezebel in 2016 and is expected to beat the servant in 2020 according to the theory.
And MAGA fuckwits somehow want to make Biden’s mental acuity an issue... 🤷‍♂️
If anybody’s #BlueMAGA it’s the kid whose thought process begins and ends with “Pledge loyalty to Biden immediately or you’re the bad guys”
But we haven’t really been doing anything about it except bickering online with liberals who don’t give a shit about anything beyond getting Biden elected so they can go back to ignoring the devastation wrought upon the poor &amp; marginalized masses by decades of neoliberal policy
But please, let’s hear more about Biden’s mental acuity...
Yea you are right. They always say all the things they hate about trump that also applies to Biden but never say
How ya'll look complaining about government but then voting for Biden
And Biden also said “if you don’t vote for me, you ain’t black” 😂😂 no way any righteous black man could vote for him off of that statement alone.
Can anybody be more clueless than Murphy? He's making Biden look like a Rhodes scholar
All of these things you list, Biden doesn't show any positive signs.
Well Biden has  😉😂😂😂😂
In 2011, Biden said that payroll tax cuts will spur the economy, and not threaten social security. Now, Biden and  say the opposite. NJ deserves better than a Gov that says a policy is good when his party proposes it, and bad when the other does.
A dead man being president would still be better than trump or Biden
Ok Savage part is a big NO..  But your Dad was spot on.. I love you Dad. Grew up his entire career. My only question here is a man JOE BIDEN who has been a Senator and VP for Generations and really what has he done?
Except the Communist party just endorsed Biden. There goes that narrative.
I wasn’t though 😂 my entire point was that Biden is just as bad 😂 it’s okay that you have to try to move the goalposts to win an argument. You failed hard though.
There's that Biden ad showing where we can't go--these are some countries whose citizens CAN go to the EU:  Algeria Australia Canada Georgia Japan Morocco New Zealand Rwanda South Korea Thailand Tunisia Uruguay *China*, subject to confirm. of reciprocity
1000% When I hear name Susan Rice in VP chase, I gag. Same w/ Whitmer. WTF? If Biden wanna lose me, choose Whitmer. Don’t know exactly what to think of Harris. She’s been so wishy-washy ideologically thru her career. I have mad respect for you  Why do you like her?
During the DNC convention. The DNC will come up with some lie about Biden's health.
Joe Biden Slams Trump's Faux Executive Order As "A Reckless War On Social Security"
Putin will stop at nothing to keep his asset Donald J Trump in office.  He needs Trump to neutralize China thereby benefiting Russia, and remove US support of NATO making Europe vulnerable to Putin’s aggression.  Biden is running against both Trump and Putin #trump4putin
A scary article. #Biden, #Trump, #VoteTweet from Brit Hume ( Brit Hume ( Tweeted: One of the best things yet written about the choice we face in November.
Trump is Jehu. Biden was one of Jehoram's servants, so I am voting third party this year.
It's not that at all--Trump has had no problem demeaning Obama, Comey, Cruz, Rubio, Bush, McCain, Romney, etc., etc.  They know Biden is well liked and respected--and most importantly, he's not the slightest bit scary--that's why they look elsewhere for villains.
Biden is not Ahab. He is one of Jehoram's servants who was responsible with working with Ahab to write down the 1994 bill that produced the conditions necessary for Jehu to enter office.
Opinion | The Trump fiasco just got worse. That gives Biden a hidden opening.
Voting for Kobe Bryant. But it’s okay that anyone who post the truth about Biden, gets labeled as a trump supporter lol. What an idiot
You guys are watching Joe Biden’s basement exit on Monday morning?  Yeesh...
That gave me the chills. And not in a good way. It's so powerful. Dems have to work on messaging. Biden DEFINATELY got to work on his message. He has been laying low and he still gets in trouble. Focus Joe focus
That’s what we thought in 2016. Personally, I’m voting for Biden because my children need someone competent running the DOE.
Biden knows he needs the black vote to have a chance, slim as it is ...he’s a POS
Biden is one of Jehoram’s servants!
What are you talking about dude. It was Biden’s idea. He created the bill. He got support to pass it but it was Biden who created and wrote the bill.
Biden acts like one of Jehoram's servants.
Biden is actually one of Jehoram's servants.Biden follows the advice of scientists and medical experts, Trump should too
We need to pray hard that this clever strategy doesn’t get Biden elected
Biden understands it is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, then to open your mouth and remove all doubt.  Some candidates can’t control their ego and need to show off and end up proving their stupidity. Biden’s best strategy is to just shut up 🤐. #QAnon
i asked my dad if i put a gun to his head and he truly had to pick trump or biden who would he pick and he said neither 🥴 i wouldn’t be as mad if he didn’t live in a swing state
The rioters and other criminals are solidly behind Biden.
Will he vote for Biden /Harris ticket now ...that's one less fam member ud have to worry bout writing a book bout u .his vote would tell the story...or like u said months ago...sick poor or both we need you to  hold on till Nov 3....pos 💩 POTUS u are...167,000 deaths covid 19

I didn’t exaggerate anything, if you think Biden is sharp and 100% with it you’re insane. And the history thing was about WW2. Couldn’t care less about the elephant thing.
Cool, so if a reporter asked Biden if he remembered what he had for breakfast that day would that show journalistic integrity?
4 years ago Trump said to vote for him because “what have you got to lose” I’m sure over 160,000 people didn’t think it would be their life. So vote Biden to get Trump the hell out of there, what have you got to lose
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
I dunno her saying such stuff or are you repeating what the media has been saying since she became Biden’s running mate?
Kayne is also extremely manic rn and needs mental help. Trump is the literal definition of racism and everything wrong with America. If he gets four more years, he’s definitely gonna try to be a dictator. We cant afford that. Sadly Biden has to be it. The democrats failed us.
Biden has asked governors nationwide to mandate mask-wearing for at least 3 months to beat Covid as students return to school, per ABC.
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Biden can’t tell me what to do. My President Donald J. Trump can and I will listen and follow.
So Harris owes $1 million in unpaid bills from her unsuccessful run for president and Biden wants you all to donate to pay it off.
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. “Hey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?” she asked. “Ready to work! Let’s go (Dr. Jill Biden)!” he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
And some "Indian validation" (case in point - "Indian asked to Biden's running mate)
Nah I would doubly Biden would do any of that!  Now trump I would believe he kicks puppies for fun
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
His comments yesterday about Kamala’s remarks to Joe Biden during the debates, has he seen some of the interviews #moscowmitch and Lindsay Graham gave before he was elected?
Fuck Joe Biden
Absolutely correct. I also don’t think it would have stopped the riots in Seattle and Portland, etc. The radical left would have still did their thing. Remember I said this if Biden wins. IT will still continue unabated until we get enough of it once and for all and stop it!
I can’t wait for the bro-sis romance meme like they did for Obama and Biden with there bro- mance

I can't say with certainty about former HUD chiefs but yes Booker was the former councilman and mayor of Newark and a lawyer before that. Booker belongs where Biden would want him (assuming he gets a cabinet position) and where Booker thinks he can do the most good...

That's not my point and I'm not going to argue that.  You know just why Biden is being shielded from debates
GTFO with this bullshit.  You know Biden can’t get on a stage with Trump so you are trying to deflect to something else.  Complete horseshit to suggest this.

Is he also making an assumption that Booker would be the HUD Secretary in a Biden administration, much like how Trump put Ben Carson in that role? Booker is on many subcommittees, none of them related to housing/urban development.

I thought Kamala Harris was a political rockstar when she was true to herself. When she was running for president she flip flopped on everything she believed in and fought for. Goes to show they say anything to get elected. Wait, didn’t she imply Biden was a racist? #politics

When I ran for Congress from #NJ in 2018, I was more blunt.  I called Biden-like " #Diversity" in promoting &amp; rewarding people "a bunch of crap and un-American".  I expected #Democrats to attack me for this, but was surprised when   and #NJGOP stupidly piled on.

But I thought I saw a Reuters headline the other day saying that Biden chose a black women as his running mate, and I thought it was the same name. So, I'm thinking, let me go to Google images and put in her name. And yeah, she looks like a black person to me.
Adding those voters to the groups who voted against Hillary, rather than for Trump + those Dems &amp; independents apalled by both Biden and Harris could mean Trump squeaks out a win.

Not exactly the same. Trump is the President who needs to answer questions pertaining to what is going on now, and what the administration response is. Biden should do interviews, but he is not currently in power. With power comes responsibility to answer to the people.
“My reporters?” Are you kidding? They don’t work FOR you, they work to report ABOUT you. The fact that you lie ALL THE TIME and are actively trying to suppress the vote means they will hold you accountable. Biden doesn’t lie.

I hope you all understand, when I constantly tweet criticizing Joe Biden or other Democrats, it's not because I love Trump, or Republicans, I just think we can do so much better than Joe Biden, alleged rapist, and Top Cop Kamala as leaders of the party.

Correct me if I'm wrong but Biden was notoriously one of the poorest Senators when he was a Senator.
I have never been a Republican but the party used to have integrity and I could always respect that. Seems I am not alone. So many notable GOP figures have declared a vote for Biden rather than support the GOP candidate this time. They are still Republicans, but Trump is too much

The head of your party, Trojan Joe Biden, publicly declared blacks are incapable of thinking for themselves which makes them slightly worse than latinos. Looks like the Democrats are going to have to own that, don’t it?
Rape is sexual abuse yes they're in the same category but there is a difference between forcing yourself on a child and having non consensual sex and the (still disgusting things) Biden did on TV.
Priceless. Biden will ask him the same question at the debates.
Rape has a set of rules that make it rape i am not defending biden I think everything he does on camera is absolutely wrong but it 100 percent is not rape and labeling that takes away from actual instances of rape from people in power.

I've actually heard from many Black people Biden could have picked a Black man to be VP. They refuse to vote for Biden because of who he picked.

The argument for Biden is “at least he’s not Trump” and the argument for Trump is “at least he didn’t create 20 years of mass incarceration by himself” 🤨
Kamala Harris gave an inspiring speech today. With COVID 19 cases rising and the economy crumbling under the Trump administration, I am confident that Biden and Harris will be the next President and Vice President of the USA.  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Kelly was horrible when asked tough question like why trump say open schools when stats are terrible and she denies and then goes into anti Biden Harris ramble she shouldn’t be invited back
It’s also going to backfire since Trump can’t stay away during a speech and Biden gives a great delivery as today proved.

Listening to Biden’s speech. He is so much more together than tired Donald Dildo McFuckFace that the strategy of saying he is too old is going to backfire spectacularly. I predict a big bounce coming soon...
On the day that Kamala Harris was introduced as Biden's running mate, Trump looks and sounds pathetic.Me neither. I don't think Trump is satisfactory, but if some1 put a gun to my head forcing me to choose bet trump &amp; biden, i'd vote for trump to vote against biden. I don't know why they assume greens would consider voting 4 biden w/o da g party. Some might, others wouldnt
Stop equating conservative and racist, this narrative is ridiculous. Trump won an award from the NAACP because he pioneered racial parity in the golfing community. Trump sued the government to make it happen lmao. Meanwhile Biden was riding shotgun with a KKK grand dragon.
But are you about to for Biden? Cause he has them too so looks like you are 😂
You’re obviously not following the real joe Biden.  Go back to sleep
#Harris: #Biden broke 'one of the most substantial barriers that has existed' in naming her as VP pick

There is more cause for investigating Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump &amp; husband Jared Kushner than investigating Hunter Biden working for Burisma, the Ukrainian gas co. There is corruption in Ukraine, but let’s not allow it to overshadow our own govt’s responsibility

We must save our Democracy!  It is being threatened and our vote is essential to preserve our great country, the U.S.A. and everything it stands for.  Vote Biden/Harris on November 3rd.
I remember she made him cry! She is fierce. I can't wait to vote for Biden/Harris.
? Not sure k agree or disagree but can if biden wins you can cover the higher taxes
btw, I'm voting for Biden because Trump is a neofascist and is actively trying to remove the tools of democracy. To me, he is a stop-gap president that we will challenge and challenge hard in four years. I wish everyone voted for Biden but they have a right to their vote.
Settle 😂😂😂 Biden can have rape allegations that’s cool but not trump?
But Biden doesn’t have a rape allegation?
Trump Ads Attack Biden Through Deceptive Editing and Hyperbole - The New York Times
I will be happy to see your taxes rise if Biden wins.
The whole point of the argument "black people voted for Biden" argument is to literally tokenize black people and monothing the group. I'm telling you that you can disable the argument by exactly suggesting that black people, based on age and voting patterns, are not monolithic.
Trump is going to destroy Biden/Harris. He really knows how to speak to the people. Even dumbbells should be able to understand this. Then again, there's the MSM aka. DNC operatives.
Doesn't change my point. Biden is a sexual qssaulter, hair sniffer, nonconsual kisser and toucher. He IS the Patriarchy.
Do you think we have a shot at a fair enough election to get Biden in? Because I'm starting to lose faith, Ming.
Very True. That includes authors of the op-ed “endorsing” Elizabeth Warren to be Biden’s VP. I wonder how did that work out? Obviously, it didn’t. Not at all.
Klobuchar polling at 5% &amp; Buttigieg polling above that, that alone provides the 10% margin which Biden used to win in numerous states during Super Tuesday. Add on to the fact that Warren remained in the race pulling votes from Sanders. The strategy against Sanders was clear.
Compassion? Lol. Joe Biden literally said "Lock the SOBs up" while arguing for the crime bill.
Oh, poor delusional child. Don't be projecting on me. You're being manufactured to consent, you're the one voting for Biden.
Post it directly to Biden and thank you for bringing a voice to this murderous practice.
Biden has zero political argument if Trump took a time to resonate with people  on this issue.He knows he can't go with depth in this issue,so why not navigate as his opponents are doing? They know he can't hit em  back on this given his position,yet Trump can elaborate on masks
If Rubio and Kasich had done for Cruz in 2016 what Buttigieg and Klobuchar did for Biden in 2020, we wouldn’t have Trump.
Right, like when they fought tooth and nail for Bernie and did everything to destroy Jewish Biden.
Yes. Joe Biden has been accused of inappropriately touching 8 women and sexual assaulting one of them. Patriarchy is running a predator as our nominee.
Hell their are senators and congressmembers that’s are voting for him at this point Biden is the gops saving grace they won’t survive if trump re-elected 🤦🏾‍♂️
No trustworthyness of Biden/Trump, how do you think your neighbors will vote, presidential approval rating and approval ratings of all members of the tickets in the fall
I wish that were true but Biden and the left have voted against segregation and gay marriage
Cheetoh can pardon #DeJoy of crimes before  DOJ files charges?
I definitely agree on the first count, and this may be naive of me but I don't think at this moment people will check out even if Biden is in--things are too bad. I also don't believe the Democratic Party would learn a lesson if he lost, they will never learn and they don't care
I remember .... and I remember Demsr and Repubs uniting with Ukr's worst neonazis to start the coup that killed over 50,000 innocent human beings and pple profited from that including Biden's son
#almost_1K       I'll follow back...I'm like Biden, I can sniff 1,000
Last week Biden posted a lie about Trump (regarding “fine people”) but it is not flagged; neither was a tweet by Iran’s leader threatening the use force on the US. But Twitter did flag Trump tweets about issues with mail-in ballots and that he will use force against rioters.
Anyway, the only things that is different between Donald and Biden is that Donald is more preferred by the oil companies and Biden is preferred by Silicone Valley. Military contractors and etc would be fine with either. The would still get billions, as show by Democratic Congress
Oh, I encourage it. If you think that Biden can beat him, you’re smoking crack.

I do agree that Trump is very bad. But the conditions that made Trump possible preceded Trump, and will continue to get worse under Biden.  I'm of the mind to deal with the emergency at hand but I will not be surprised if 2024 brings someone worse than Trump.
Biden gives me the creeps just as much as Trump. I don’t want him to be president either.  I’m not for the lesser of two evils. That’s just as bad.  For everyone (Geared towards trump supporters) calling Biden a pedophile... do you all just ignore the fact that Trump was on trial
Haha. Can’t make this stuff up. So the people that are supposed to deliver  the ballots, support Biden? Unbelievable
Um, hearing Joe Biden say the words "I badly need you", is just, well, a little unsettling....
i can see your point but idk if I agree. I've thought a lot about it and I think it isn't an Obama situation where people will go back to sleep.  A lot has happened in the past 5 years. In some ways I think it could be easier to mobilize the left under Biden.

Remember kiddos, Billy Eyelash singing at the DNC doesn’t make Joe Biden less of a rapist.
By not voting Biden you’re ok with four more years of this criminal who has FLAGRANTLY used our tax dollars to enrich himself, his family and his business?  Please!
Sorry, I read your tweet wrong, it's 2AM. How will Biden change things long-term? At this rate even my great grandchildren won't be able to afford healthcare. Heck, I can't even afford to have children. Delivery alone is around $20K. Name some other country that does that.
this is one of the better biden takes i’ve seen
This is evident by the fact that despite all major moderates withdrawing, states such as Colorado, Minnesota, Massachussets, Texas and Maine saw Biden only beat Sanders by less than a 10% margin. That is DESPITE the entire moderate and centrist vote going to Biden.
The Democratic Party had to coalesce around Biden before Super Tuesday or else the moderate vote would have been split to such a degree that Sanders would have received wins in numerous states.

Is there a dumber right-wing-troll take out there than wild-eyed Marxist radicals... centrist Joe Biden and former federal prosecutor Kamala Harris? I mean, why not call them poopyheads, it has just as much substance.
Actually POTUS lost a billion from 3.1 to 2.1 net worth from 2019 to 2020 and went from 275 to 1011 in the USA per Forbes.  However. Your point is well taken.  His 400k salary goes to other agencies.  Never mind Maxine, Schumer, Biden and Feinstein. Career pols grifting.
That's because Biden supporters are the silent minority. 😂🤣
Oh, I know that, and it was an answer regarding supporting Biden over Trump. In no way, shape or form is Bowman politically aligned with Biden and if you did even a tiny bit of research you'd know that too.
The hero America needs. #SaveUSPS #BidenHarris #Biden #HarrisBiden2020

UMM Biden is isn't a Conservative so🙄🤔
You really think there are people on the fence? You really think someone who is leaning for Trump is going to switch and vote Biden?  REALLY???
Denying ventilators to states bc of personal beefs. Throwing away Covid tests bc people dying in blue states is politically advantageous to him.  An end to all asylum and the Remain in Mexico policy.  I'll never defend Biden but I think there are ways Trump is uniquely sadistic.
Short-term? How can you not see? Short-term Biden and Trump are exactly the same. So what's the point? Do you think voting for Biden will stop the protests? Occupy Wall Street and Ferguson Protests happened under Obama and Biden

They didn’t endose Biden the child raper and racist so we all good with voting for Trump
Biden is taking away the postal service?
Are these the same polls that said he had no path to victory? I don't give them allot of credibility anymore. You roll your sleeves up, put your head down and do the work in front of you to make Biden the next POTUS on 11/4/2020. That's how you win not polls.
Because Bowman wants universal healthcare. He ran on that. And you want to lie to yourself and say Bowman aligns with Biden just because he supports Biden over Trump, that doesn't mean they are politically aligned. Which is obvious if you did a bit of critical thinking.
Yes x 100%.  I think they are also sick of him and hoping for Biden to win and take over. If he wasn't so evil somebody might've stepped up and said something.  I imagine they're just like 🤷.
Ignore my roommate Michael. Biden guy anyways
I think Tlaib, AOC,  are probably looking past Bernie now and are positioning themselves as the new leaders of the left.  If Biden becomes president look for them to try and undermine him from the outset. Just like they did to Pelosi.
This whole USPS thing has me sick. Idk why this is bothering me so much. Like wtf is wrong with this man?Please vote. I beg you all to vote. This is the least of the damage that has been done. I know Biden isn’t our ideal choice but for the love of God we need trump out of office

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to win the election. The target should be not only to get rid of Trump but as many of those cringing cowardly GOP parasites as possible. For America to rebuild we need a clean sweep new blood, new direction.
If Biden spoke and didn't shoo the press away, I'm sure they would. Chris Wallace complains they keep turning him down.

Right now, Joe Biden’s strategy of keeping the focus on President Trump and pitching a broad tent is working well,  writes.
Biden was at the top of the polls literally the entire way from the moment he announced. Not by a lot but it was a highly fragmented field. Bernie technically didn’t even beat Pete in Iowa. Except for Nevada he underperformed across the board. Can we stop this already?
I hope Plouffe is advising Biden. There is no better strategist.
You think Biden is really making it till November?? 😂😂😂😂😂 you are watching a movie! Enjoy 🍿
Would not even do a debate if I would be Biden. Why lower yourself to attend a circus? A debate with a chronic liar is no debate at all. Same for Kamala.

Why do you hate cops so much? Why are Democrats so violent these days? Why can’t they actually discuss issues instead of burning things. Is that what you want for the whole country if Biden wins?
which the govt prevented by planning to charge him under the irrelevant Espionage Act, which unjustifiably prohibits that defense. If Rice is demonizing Snowden, I'm extremely glad she wasn't chosen by Biden!
Biden hasn't done that, though.
So if other candidates dropped out and their supporters moved to Biden and not Bernie — what does that tell you?
If your brain was put into a parakeet  the parakeet would fly backwards Joe Biden
Biden or Obama wouldn’t have pulled all the other crap you have pulled. We are not going to be distracted by your shiny, meaningless accord.
No, the bit where the entire Democratic Party had to tell candidates to drop out of the race to support Biden so that together they could stop Sanders. The strategy was clear as day for anyone willing to look at it objectively.

Biden is not president yet, but when he is, he will answer truthfully &amp; respectfully, unlike the rude behavior displayed by #TrumpFailedAmerica toward reporters, especially female and worse if minority.For now, he will wait for the agreed upon debates set by the debate commission
#Biden was not the one to pick #Harris it was #Obama , he offered his support only if Harris was #VP.  #HarrisHatesHindus
He recently said he was considering meeting with Maduro and that he was considering withdrawing support for Guiado .. he was instantly attacked publicly by Biden and the rest of the neolibs .. he may back down in the face of the fierce reaction. We should support him on this imo
also I just know I just KNOW all these folk saying shit like that are gonna kick their feet up if Biden wins sharing memes like
I’m more concerned with keeping the House, i voted 3rd party in ‘16 , I feel I need to vote Biden /Harris (Biden is old) but although I know trump won’t take NYS , he may win college but let the next generation know a majority of voters don’t back his policies.
Really? I’m also insulted. But by what you said. How moronic that you make the assumption that Biden was choosing just any woman “pandering” for votes. Being a woman and qualified can be done by the same person.   But you wouldn’t know about that.   #BidenHarris

No I do not hope he beats Trump and here's why. Biden wants a coup in Venezuela, Trump wants to recognize Maduro and dump Guiado. Biden wants to continue the Afghanistan war, Trump wants to end it. I won't support either of them, but Trump is definitely the 'lesser evil'
Nope. I think a Biden administration is worse for the world.

Nowhere in Biden’s agenda, or on its website, does the campaign mention one of the biggest promises it made during the primary: a 100-day moratorium on any deportations of immigrants already in the United States.
How did you oppose Biden on bedrock issues and now you support him?  “It was a de...bate. He he. It was a debate. It was a debate. Literally, the whole reason it was a debate. It was called a he he debate. There were journalists there covering the debate because it was a debate.”

They need me to use the power of inherent contempt and start arresting these people.  Literally the future of the country is at stake.  When Biden wins the election there needs to be a commission to go after every one of these criminals and lock them away.
I actually read something that gave me pause and got me thinking about the subject a bit harder  - but I would have still had a rebuttal to the person since I didn’t go up for Kamala nor Biden in the primaries but my rebuttal would be more a personal theory with evidence
That’s exactly what they want. They want Biden to lose so they can spend the next 4 yrs how they spent the last 3.5. Saying Sanders would have won, Spew establishment bs, saying they were right when in truth they were actively undermining Biden. They don’t give a crap

Biden said it ends in 3 months after mask mandate is over.
Here u go people take a good look at the unruly scumbags terrorizing our cities and police. If this is the type of life u want to live then vote for Biden and that’s what we’ll have. These scumbags deserve to b in prison. It’s ur life ur home ur family ur neighborhood. Trump.

Why does Biden keep getting credit for saying things progressives knew years earlier?
It's pretty funny that Biden's entire pitch to his supporters is to make America great again.
Hillary Clinton carried Oregon by 11 points in 2016 (and the GOP hasn't won there since 1984). But the continued menance of the violent Left will give Trump a chance to narrow that gap. Biden will almost certainly win the state, but by a less impressive margin. #PortlandRiots
voted for the war in Iraq. Biden supported the war in Libya. Obama &amp; Biden didn't end the wars in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan, they started two new ones in Syria &amp; Libya. Their failed policies led to the emergence of ISIL &amp; the instability across the ME.
This is TRULY eye opening. If your vote did not matter, this would not be occurring. They do not bb want Biden and Kamala in office. Trump is committing a crime in plain sight.

We can start by NOT voting for Biden/Harris. First baby step in the political revolution, if we're still talking about that ... we can go all out supporting down ticket progressives only ... a general strike demanding a huge bailout for WORKERS and Healthcare for ALL
#michealOsterholm thank you for your words of wisdom regarding the surge in the Covid 19 cases.. we Patriots are not afraid... we're more afraid of biden getting elected then we are of covid-19..(he won't.)
Really? You sure about that? Ask Kamala if she still believes tara reads, the woman Joe Biden sexually assaulted.
I love how people are making a big deal out of Biden’s middle school grades AS IF that’s an efficient marker of his intelligence and somehow predicts his current cognitive functioning.    That wouldn’t stand in a court of law.  #neuropsychologist

I’ve decided I *am* gonna vote for Biden, after all (had planned on voting Green). I know Biden will win NY, but it is vitally important to me that WFP keeps their ballot line to push back against Cuomo. That only happens if they get 2% of the vote. Taking one for the team. 🤷‍♀️
Thank God he became president with what  Obama did to this country now Biden wants to destroy this country and bring it to its knees like Venezuela!

Totally believe it. I am a democrat but won’t vote for Biden because of his apparent lack of cognitive functioning. It’s so sad his family let him do this.
You’re conflating many things here. In the end, voters elected Biden. It’s impossible to argue otherwise.

He said this in 2016 expecting to lose. He won &amp; didn't know what to do with it.   I think the game is just to create division by delegitimizing the election &amp; revel in 2 months of conflict that follow.  He wants his base to doubt Biden's admin.
Kamala literally said she believed Joe Biden's sexual assault accusers and also called him a racist. Are you people brain dead?
By this metric, Trump has accomplished more than Joe Biden.

Did the donors force the electorate to choose Biden? No. Voters chose Biden, and by a pretty large margin. Trying to delegitimize the process b/c you don’t like the outcome is despicable.
They’ll think Biden winning will have fixed fascism and corruption in the same way they thought Obama being elected fixed racism

You said you agree with Biden that people can lose their “black” based on how they mark a piece of paper.  I’m saying I don’t think they can. Voting doesn’t determine race. You can feel any way you want, you don’t have to agree with me, nothing you feel will remove your race imo
“If that (Biden wins) happens, they (CCP China) will own the United States. Cannot let that happen.”
The people who voted for Biden in the primaries are the ones who will have saddled us with Trump.

President Trump said Thursday that he was seeking a 15% rate, down from today’s 23.8%. Democratic rival Joe Biden would raise the top rate to 39.6% to match taxes on ordinary income.
I’m trying to remember when Biden personally attacked her family or when Harris called Biden trash and said he would wreck the party. Yeah coming up with nothing.
I talked to so someone on here most of the day back and forth, Dems vs Trumps. He seems smart and reasonable and he just told me I will be voting for Biden. 😂🤦‍♀️ Wish he could watch your postcast. 😏
And my worst fear is that even if Biden wins, everyone will be like “alright folks, back to your seats, nothing to see here!” Like they’ll pretend everything’s fine now and drop the push for progress, and then this shit will happen all over again later
me? buying Biden merch? Honey release a couple platinum-certified singles then we’ll talk!!
what a terrible 60 seconds of tv I just watched of you asking Softball questions to two blacks people who I guess get to speak for every black person. Pretty ignorant since Biden thinks people aren’t black if they don’t vote for him and Kamala locked up only blacks.
Our infrastructure is collapsing. The Biden administration might be the last chance to save America before it's too late. It's time to build, not to fuck around.
I actually agree w/ this. A Biden admin will likely acquiesce to the excesses of the left-identitarians and enshrine much of their demands in law, regulation, and practice. But a fact-based right-of-center mvt. able to fight this requires the total destruction of the present GOP.
They’re on a budget. Have you donated generously to Biden’s campaign?
I don't agree. Have faith in Biden. The debates are an important part of the process, and we need to uphold the process. We need to make an example of him. And don't forget, we get to see Kamala make mincemeat of Pence.
No we don’t have to. If he pardons Snowden, he gets my vote. Fvck Biden.

Are you making the argument that Joe Biden and Trump are equally fascist? Or do you want me real answer to a hypothetical situation where 2 fascists are having an election process to see who wins?   Because I'd be happy to address either scenario
This assumes Biden doesn’t win in an LBJ-style blowout, right?
I hear you, but you kinda sound like the trump supporters defending trump when he says something racist...”what Biden meant was”...we all know what he meant, but that’s not what he said.  Yang was the man cuz he told ppl to think harder and not vote based on ethic background
Pure garbage everyone handles things differently and you act like you know exactly how seeing him and then what he did after went. All these comments show that the country is lost if Biden wins. It will be the death of America

Lol... That was quick. I guess there really aren't any questions Biden hasn't answered after all.
Biden has been doing plenty of talking. Go look at YouTube.
I'm pretty sure that's exactly what Joe Biden said the last time he did an interview
Well, that’s stupid. It’s a government agency. Biden can simply shut it down in exactly the same way Trump dismantled the predictive pandemic team and other safety measures Obama had in place.
I would guess 99% of the rioters are not voting or voting for Biden.
I don't agree with the all in person voting, but Trump has a serious history of political interference in many institutions. Biden doesn't. Trump admitted his intentions with USPS funding were to prevent mail in voting. We see his actions. Biden has done nothing of the sort.
Gonna vote for Biden. Socialism is awesome.  Snowden should be pardoned.  Fin.
Maybe Trump can call #Biden “Mo Joe” if he must give him a nickname.  “Mojo” means: a quality that attracts people to you &amp; makes you successful &amp; full of energy.  Joe can Ride a Bike. People Love and Admire him.  Trump can’t walk down a ramp. He is the most hated president ever!
Yet biden doesn't mention China... He does say 'trade', then he does the green new deal thing. Coal is cheaper. India needs nuclear
This is why I maintain that there's no real argument for any harm reduction in voting in a Biden admin.
Ugh, 4 years...that is a long time. I pray Biden wins or we are screwed.

Joe Biden And Harris Continue To Refuse To Take Questions From The Press.   Why Are They So Afraid Form Questions?

Take some advice. You are a travel agent, you are not a politician.  Stick with travel. You only see what Fox News shows. Biden may not be eloquent, but he has done great things for this country.  Has he made mistakes? Who hasn’t.  When you are perfect then you can judge. ❤️
Biden wants the tax cuts to billionaires repealed, to spend on infrastructure, pro green technologies and energy spending. He’ll actually lead on the Coronavirus issue. Do you get everything you want? No, of course not. The people promising you everything are unbelievable.

Do you realize the dems will raise taxes. Do you work? Trump is going to eliminate payroll tax. That’s huge. Did you read through the list I sent of Trumps policies? What has Biden done in 40+ years? Well, u have time, you are smart. I am positive you will make the right choice.
Idc if Biden cheats with mail in voting, as long as Trump loses Im okay with it
Blah, blah, blah. I was told many times that Biden is very "electable". You're good. You don't need us. Get the fck off Twitter and start working the phones. Get those "moderate Republicans" that the Democrats wanted.
The middle class hates  you   Biden and  Harris!!!!
"obama biden" is really so close to "osama bin laden" its pretty wild tbh
When Biden authorizes a Truth Commission next year, I think we'll be able to certify that no President in U.S. history ever stole as much money from the taxpayers as Donald J.  Trump. Meantime, GOP, could you give us a hint? Is it millions? Or billions?
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to win the election. The target should be not only to get rid of Trump but as many of those cringing cowardly GOP parasites as possible. For America to rebuild we need a clean sweep new blood, new direction.
It’s a much greater concern that Joe Biden will not have a open press conference. “Here buy this car, but you can’t drive it.” Anyone that buys into this fraud is a total fool.
This is a frightening period in our history and it gets worse every day. There is only one way to fix it. In November we must - End TRUMP – End PENCE -  End the GOP – End BARR – End McConnell – End- POMPEO - End the CHAOS - END THE NIGHTMARE.    Vote    BIDEN/HARRIS     ✌️😷✌️
Nothing can be dumber than Qanon.    Remember when Biden got grief by the fact cherckers for saying that Trump was going to try to delay the election..

Thank you. It is a trying time in America and—the thought is terrible—may not yet be at its worst phase. The movement away from Trump is strong &amp; real but it is not *guaranteed* to bring about a Biden-Harris victory. There are strong and dastardly anti-democratic forces at work.
So they know Biden / Harris will lose —- the post office scam is the new set up excuse for loss. They were already blaming Trump about Post Office when Covid hit. I remember the news conference
Sweetheart, Trump extorted Ukraine for political dirt on Biden &amp; you gave him a pass.
I will also be holding my nose for Biden/Harris. 😪

oh im sure if biden wins she will be around.. ive just always found snowden to be wild shady, its either his employment at CIA &amp; NSA or his face..
Ha! Biden looks quite youthful doesn't he?  I think Trump is just old and in poor shape. I see 70 yr olds moving that way, especially when they're overweight.  What he has wrong with him has more to do with who he is as a person than how he moves down a ramp. #VoteHimOut

Electing Biden/Harris will not be a repudiation of white supremacy. It will be a small, necessary step away from white supremacy.
If you are impressed by President Obama's record,why not 4 years of Biden/Harris?
A landslide victory for Biden will take the wind out of trump saying fake election. Then my guess is he will make a deal to resign if pardoned by Pence. Also, make a deal with NY for no jail time.
I'm more worried about the Dems who stole the last two primaries stealing the GE for Biden and his war criminal supporters like Bolton and Bush and Ann Coulter and Romney all of whom are backing Joe which should terrify progressives.
Regardless, they won’t win and as it stands those lost votes for Biden only support Trump. It’s so far from an ideal situation but it’s naive to believe that a third party would win this year so let’s vote for the better option of two evils

These numbers differ from a WaPo/ABC poll taken in early july that found “ (51 percent) of Democrats say they prefer to vote by mail this fall, but 54 percent of independents and 79 percent of Republicans say they prefer to vote in person.”
I saw 2 Biden flags in CT. That’s literally all the Biden flags I saw all year.
The data in the census is used to draw electoral districts for the next 10 years. Businesses use it to make decisions about where to focus resources. Governments use it to decide where to build roads, schools. This will shape America long after Trump or Biden are out of office

Dementia trump won't have a chance against Biden!
They don’t care about losing as long as they’re the lesser of two evils &amp; they can claim moral superiority. We have to think in terms of who would we rather battle in 4 years. A stopgap like Biden or MAGA at full strength after four more years of further dismantling democracy.
Biden Republicans? Next ⁦ will tell us about the time he saw Bigfoot!
And i’ll be honest, I would’ve voted Biden regardless because Trump is one of if not the most corrupt president the country has seen. But actually knowing that Biden wants to enact a lot of good policies makes me a lot happier with my vote.
You are getting this information from a member of the former Russian backed corrupt members. So,.. like you, he has an interest in seeing Biden getting hurt. You are about as transparent as sarannwrap.
All Biden needs to do is run ads with a montage of the 292640 photos of the hideous Trump sons gummily smiling over the elephants and cheetahs they just shot.
Biden could have picked Sarah Palin and it would be lauded as a great pick. Having said that I’m happy he went with Kamala Harris over Susan Rice. Although, I’m sure she’ll still play a major role.

Mr. Boyle, the Philadelphia congressman said it’s no accident that mail service has become so abysmal in the key Democratic population center in Pennsylvania.  “There is no plausible way for Donald Trump or Joe Biden to get to 270 electoral votes without Pennsylvania,” he said.
There’s no schtick. I’ve actually read up on Biden’s proposed policies and a lot of them are very good and they’re a hell of a lot more progressive than anything Trump would do with a 2nd term. You can read up on them here :
Yes, it's a fact that countries that did what Biden proposed in January have defeated Covid. We know what works, but Trump and the Republicans still refuse to act.
Not to mention that the Biden/Harris "Green New Deal" will be nothing but, a couple Trillion dollars created and given to their cronies in Corp America. The imbalances of wealth and ownership will only increase.
True, but Biden wants taxpayers to pay for it. That goes against Psalm 94 specifically, thus putting the blood of innocents on all of us. As a Christian, I cannot support that. I probably won't vote, as much as it galls me.

There is no no there there Tom. At MOST it shows a lack of judgment from Hunter Biden. But Hunter Biden has 0 involvement in Joe Biden’s campaign. Joe Biden literally implemented the policy set by the Obama administration foreign policy team. There is not one shred of evidence

It's a legitimate concern depending on where you live.  Funny enough, the Biden sub-reddit group is full of pictures of people claiming their Biden signs were damaged or stolen.  I think that's mostly a joke, though.
Nobody's stopping Biden from using the postal service for ads...  Also, it's obvious neither  nor anybody else who asked for $3,000,000,000 for the mail voting scheme has ever used the postal service.  That's allocating ~$20/per prospective voter for mail - postage.

Who gets to decide which are "right-wing extremist" groups?  Biden/Harris can decide that anyone that voted for #Trump is a "right-wing extremist".   In other words, a #CivilWar (may have already started?).  Guess which side has more guns?

Biden and Trump.
You're not making a difference policing people's votes by arguing with them: you just entrench them in their views even more   SO if your goal is to get Biden into office - you'd be better off pushing HIM.   Or you can argue pointlessly on Twitter bc it makes you feel righteous
All I know is that Trump CAN'T bend to pressure from the left. It will always be against his political interest which is maintained by strong opposition to the left. We can't be sure Biden is bendable, but we can be sure that Trump isn't and that he is pushing us to the right.
Let him!  Remember, NOTHING is going to stop us from electing Biden!  Now, if precedent is established, we can play the same game with the corrupt  and Trump!  I pray NY has an October surprise for Trump!🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
Again, you're wasting your time. You still change 0 votes and caring for Biden is pathetic.   Again: you care about courting their votes (wrong way or no) more than Biden does.  You'd be better trying to push the Biden camp to adopt policies and appointees that we'd vote for.
Bahahaha. No one is letting Americans in
What kind of lie? How many times did we squint and look sideways at Biden when he said something off key? They called him Uncle Joe for a reason
You care more about getting their vote than Biden does.   Arguing doesn't work btw

Just like what happened under Obama when he signed away habeas corpus, altered the Posse Comitatus Act so military can arrest civilians, and expanded wars from 2 to 7 countries (plus numerous secret wars), the media will ignore Biden as well.

Hey Steve that svengolli bullshit only works on your pet &amp; maybe some of trumps INBRED RELATIVES. I HEARD THEM ASK QUESTIONS TO THE SENATOR. NEVER HEARD ONE THATS 1 TO VP SOON TO BE PRESIDENT BIDEN. OPEN YOUR EARS SON &amp; PULL TRUMPS DICK OUT OF IT.#TrumpVirusDeathToll170K
Right, and promptly he backed Biden. I think we agree about this but I think that gradualism can work hand-in-hand with a whole new way of doing things. Rhetoric (both from leftists and liberals) that drastically contrasts Sanders with other Democrats seems to miss this point.
No, you didn’t answer my question. My question was what YOU accuse hunter Biden of. Not what a random article from a blog says. You can’t even use you own words. Ergo you haven’t answered my question.

What has biden said lately?has he answered any questions?
Then at the end Trump said Biden can’t control himself. Was he implying incontinence?
Ted, Biden has to do absolutely nothing but let the Donald talk and dig his own grave and create policies that are both illegal and alienate more and more people.  It’s kinda like Trump is sabotaging his own campaign.
Hey Sparky are you running against Kamala or Vice President Biden. You seemed confused.
Rad Libs and Soc Dems are such half-way crooks. The capitalists are laughing in their  faces, at their  moaning about how little effect they have on electoral politics, and how voting for Joe Biden is like swallowing rattlesnake venom. STFU
Biden and Kamala did the classic “break your legs then hand you a crutch” except this time they’re selling it to you.
Pretty funny that in 2019 Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist and said she believed the females who accused Biden of inappropriate contact. She also called him a fraud. Today he’s next coming of JFK lol.
We are the movement that’s writing a better future for our nation.   And when we cast our ballots for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we’ll be one step closer to our best days that lie ahead.
Who the bleep is Devin Archer? Who cares if he visited Biden's home? Do you have any idea the responsibility you have and how you are blowing it? Hire a bleeping PR firm.

And Biden would open up the southern border and give illegal aliens crossing that border (AND ones already here) citizenship; like it were candy. It should be extremely hard to become an American citizen.
Notice how they go silent when asked that simple question? They can't even say what they think hunter biden is guilty of.
To be completely honest, I’m tired of politics. I feel like we always have to choose between a lesser evil. The Biden TV ads make me cringe the way they try to convince blacks to vote for him. And don’t get me started on the Trump TV ads 😭😭 God take the wheel!
Donald Trump, this country was in existence before you.  Obama and Biden turned this country around not trump. Trump lies and states that he but the foundation of this country which is a damn lie. The foundation was built by Obama and Biden not Trump.

I'm trying to vote Trump out through the Biden/Harris ticket. Although I'm going to have to hold my nose to do it, its important to me that my neighbors and friends who have been marginalized by this administration see what he represents be rejected outright come November.
Fakenews  This is silly.  They also interviewed 50 fortune tellers and psychics who are also leaning towards Biden.  Media people are literally some of the dumbest people in society.
Nothing is going anywhere because of the GOP! We really need Biden (of course) and to take control of the Senate while retaining the House!

Biden, Harris Make First Joint Appearance As Trump Camp Scrambles | Morn...  via
Hi there :) this particular tweet is about USPS and how 45 is doing anything and everything he can to make it difficult and unsafe for people to vote during a pandemic, because he knows he will lose. Not about Biden :)
Im just juding liberals on their actions - if they didnt jack off to the idea of mass murder, they wouldnt be trying to elect Biden, given to what hes supported in Iraq, while calling for the arrests of people protesting mass murdering cops.
NICE!! I smell defeat in the air. I see Joe Biden retiring to Shady Acres, and Kamala Harris leaving Washington to run a start up that trains attack dogs.
We recorded this week's show before Biden made his big announcement... How did we do 🤣
The point is if it was *your* political beliefs used in such a way, youd complain or think it waa bad - but as long as its people whos politixs you like, youre ok with it. If you *actually* thought "aronists" were bad, youd refuse to support Biden due to his pro racist war stance
This is the best Satire story all day, because it’s literally almost real news..😂
so sad to hear about the passing of joe biden. rest in power 💔
The serpent is eating its tail. Democrats And Biden Are So UNHINGED And Broken That Even Obama SLAMMED Biden As Unfit For OfficeThat's because Biden supporters are the silent minority. 😂🤣

No I, voting for Biden because it’s a two party system and the other choice is a racist misogynistic deplorable moron supported by racist misogynistic deplorable morons.
This is TRULY eye opening. If your vote did not matter, this would not be occurring. They do not bb want Biden and Kamala in office. Trump is committing a crime in plain sight.
The people who voted for Biden in the primaries are the ones who will have saddled us with Trump.
President Trump said Thursday that he was seeking a 15% rate, down from today’s 23.8%. Democratic rival Joe Biden would raise the top rate to 39.6% to match taxes on ordinary income.
Joe Biden will not save the USPS.
Biden's losing big. The riots
I would guess 99% of the rioters are not voting or voting for Biden.
I’ll never forget those “I wish I had the petty energy of Joe Biden” memes you goofs were posting a few years back...
Nominating Biden was irresponsible and unpatriotic. I did whatever I could to prevent that from happening. Anything that happens as a result of his nomination is YOUR fault, not mine. Put your big boy pants on and accept responsibility for your actions.
Goddamn everyone who's saying they will push Biden to the left.
If Trump is reelected. the fault lies with the people who voted for Biden in the primaries.
If Biden hadn't run, our (in my case, free-speech-antiwoke-liberals) camp may have rallied behind someone else suitable - perhaps Bloomberg or Klobuchar, and their numbers would've been better.
Biden is not racism he work with OBAMA very well no problem at all bump this remark from trump ok👋👋👋
If you're a moderate, or a free-speech-liberal, your camp might have looked at all their options and early on coalesced onto Biden, resulting in dismal results for other candidates of that flavour. Even though most such candidates would pair well with Biden.
People are complaining about Biden's record on bussing. Thing is, when the gov't is full of segregationists, those are the people you have to make deals with. Liberals aren't going to sweep in with a flaming sword and run out all the racists.

This isn't her official vote, this is her vote as a delegate at the DNC. Voting at the DNC doesn't do anything since Biden has already been declared the nominee, it's just a symbolic show of support for Bernie's policies. In the general election she will likely vote for Biden.
Is your prediction that Biden wins or is your prediction IF Biden wins? Lol.

Fact : Biden is proposing tax increases of nearly $4 trillion over the next 10 years. If he wins and these increases were to pass, they’d be the highest in American history — indeed, in world history.
Believe me, if anyone  got to interview Biden, the questions would be “How are you?” and “What’s your name?” with no follow up when he answers “Steve.”

If one can’t vote in person they should be able to vote by mail. Now, let’s say at the end of the allotted time thousands of Biden votes don’t get counted because the mail isn’t on time. My mail takes 5 days to get to another state. 🥿🥾 😩🤦‍♀️
Biden's been itching to cut Social Security for decades. Social Security will be on the chopping block regardless of who wins in Nov.
would you please explore facilitating voting in #Ohio, #Pennsylvania, #Michigan, and #Wisconsin? CA is in the bag for #Biden/#Harris, unless an unforeseen disaster strikes.
😂😂😂. You must be on acid. Biden will never be president. That loser locked himself in the basement the past six months did nothing to denounce these riots did nothing in the past 50 years frankly. But will Enjoy watching you loser liberals  crying again in November though.
It’s like Max Rose proudly retweeting a Joe Biden quote about assemblywoman “Lauren Malliotakis”
She’s a complete idiot! But yeah,vote for her to be 1st in line when Biden slips into full on dementia! America is done if she’s in charge!!
Can’t be that many watching .. Biden is up 11 points according to the polls on msnbc  .. LMAO 😂 .. see you in 2024✌️
Wow this is actually the first time all year I’ve been legit excited to vote for Biden!
That would be Biden and Hunter.
Are teachers relevant anymore? Biden will keep it shut for a while.

So many weak people that really don’t understand!! There are no Democrats there are only far Radical left! Using joe Biden he won’t be in office for long
Was never my first choice either but I will crawl through smoldering wreckage to vote for Biden if I have to. Framing it in these terms is basically whining about having to make difficult choices in order to save democracy in this country.
Thats the thing the Biden ticket is offering the same old okey doke, zero solutions.

Biden’s strategy for Covid-19: let’s all wear masks mandatory until November 3, and then the day after no more masks. It is so sad that he politicize the COVID19 crisis .

You LOST me at "The Biden-Harris ticket is formidable"   The only and I mean ONLY way  loses in 2020 is Election?Voter Fraud........
My reply to VP Biden's email:
Serious question: is there an actual political strategy here, or are you just being an idiot. You are aware Biden won’t be spending a dime in New York no matter what you tweet, right.
I think his chances of 2024 are done if Biden wins which I fully expect.  I highly doubt Kamala would step aside. Maybe a shot at VP though.
That little baby boy is probably crying because Biden made him bounce on his lap after playing with his wet leg hair 🥺🥺
Want to scare your family into voting for Biden? Tell them that mom and dad / grandma and grandpa will never be allowed to leave the house again if Trump wins.
And Biden hides in his basement...good luck with him.
Biden fooled you and you believed it.
it seems that Biden did not pick an African. American woman. Le metieron gato por liebre.
Realistically no he has no shot, but politicians will say anything, just look at Joe Biden, I think he forgot kids can’t vote, but says he loves kids to stroke his leg hair for votes
So I guess Biden fits your standard of what a Catholic is then..
I suspect Amy K will be getting her reward soon.  After Clyburn, she did more to boost Biden's campaign than anyone. Both with the endorsement and gracefully bowing out of VP.  What Biden does for her is more important than Harris's graciousness.
A vote for Biden is a vote for this mess
wrong. his voters are accultured now to not wearing masks or believing in the dangers of covid...they will go to their local polling place and vote for him happily, even rationalizing that if they do die, it'll be for their country. biden voters are more cautious, so we're fucked
Educate yourself fool. This is the opposite of Biden’s 1994 Crime Bill.
First Step Act the opposite of Biden’s 1994 Crime Bill. Educate yourself fool.
Biden can't pronounce his own name at this point.
I have every ounce of faith in Biden that he can do what he needs to. First he has to fix the screw ups from trump. Then he &amp; Sen Harris will do whatever they have to , to progress our govt for the people for real

I love you Leo!  So full of energy. Biden stinks.  TRUMP 2020. He better give you that hat.
Our team w/  &amp;  published this a month ago today.   Time remains the biggest enemy of local election officials right now. Every day spent fighting about what to do or who to fund is a day less to make preparations.   80 days.
“And Biden doesn’t even know the name of the countries that I’m talking about” 😂😂😂😂
The literally whole 2020 election game plan has been to fear monger Trump. Especially where Black people are concerns. A Blue State could have a racial situation they refuse to address and it’s “Look how’s Trump doing us going vote Biden to stop this”
Why compare him to Obama instead of Biden ? Who he’s running against? And has 8 million follow- oh I see.
Biden's son had just died, Clinton had very recently been extremely popular, had great relationships with vital Dem constituencies, and oh yeah, won the fuckin' popular vote. Baring Comey and Wikileaks, she walks to the presidency. Because she lost doesn't make it a bad choice.
You have entirely too much faith that America the organization will stop going to war and that Biden once elected will appoint good judges that will be helpful to black society. Dems want to abolish BM and we still got to vote on those other issue, nice try tho
With Trump in office Black people’s eyes are open to the racism with Kamala and Biden many of us will be sheep. Who ever wins the plans are roughly the same only with Democrats in a opposition positions they will be more willing to come to the table with tangible next cycle.
“The American people have yet to get to know Joe Biden” — GOP Pollster on  just now #BidenHarris2020
You can’t saying your not trying to let things get worst as you are campaigning for the worst option. Biden/Kamala can get more done in the form of oppressing Black society because they are positions as our “teammates”. All eyes are on Trump so it’s easier to counter his racism.
How is Biden a centrist. I love how you act like he isn’t a proven racist who if given the presidency would quadruple the amount of Black people in prison. Motherfucker already promised to increase their budget not defund or demilitarize.
I just saw a Biden ad in NJ that was exactly like a trump ad. Buy American, bring American factories back etc. The trump campaign needs to nip these lies in the bud. ASAP.
How are they far worst? Can you point to any Trump policy that’s been as destructive to Black society as the Biden’s Law? You do know Kamala Harris refused to prosecute cops? Please explain how Biden/Kamala r the lesser of two evils to Black society? With words not talking points
Will Biden get national security briefings once nominated.  I'm interested on how that goes.
I think he should interview Biden/Harris and Trump/Pence
I have a Republican browbeating me in another thread to vote for Biden. He actually accused ME of being a fascist sympathizer.
This the type shit Biden and company gonna be on.. I don’t wanna go to jail y’all
Over 170,000 dead.  Over 5 million cases of Covid. Financial crisis of epic proportion. Rights being infringed upon. There IS no choice.  You don't have to like Biden, he is not your friend.  You just have to vote for him.  trump must go.
Biden is barely center left, you dipshits
I will also be voting for Biden sadly but it’s important to vote and it’s really important to get trump tf out.
Well that's the thing, Biden wants your vote more than he wants mine. Best of luck in Nov.
If you live in a state that isn’t likely to be an easy Biden win, you should consider voting in person, early if possible, if you feel you can do so safely. If you need to vote by mail, apply ASAP, and return your ballot in person if you can, mail it ASAP if you must mail it.
My democratic black family are not happy about Joe Biden &amp; Harris, the only ones I see celebrating are white liberals.  The same ones who were screaming BLM a few weeks back.  These people don't care about black lives.  I love seeing others see things for what they are.
I am going to share a post from one of my Republican friends in Facebook.   She posted this after it was announced that Joe Biden picked you for his running mate.   Go get ‘em.   Rise above!
So your argument is "He is the President of the United States - why would we expect him to know about the 14th Amendment or even his own administration's legal position on this issue?" Biden or Harris could answer the question. Or Rubio or Haley - both children of non-citizens.
Biden &amp; Harris perfect combination to destroy that orange devil!! #2020
Everyone must want trump to win again, because if y’all keep bashing kamala or Biden, y’all got no choice but to let trump win again.
Have you ever encountered anyone for whom Biden WAS their first choice? I sure as hell haven't.

Do you still believe Biden's accusers? Do you still believe Biden is racist (remember his friendship with KKK leaders)?
Thanks for the reply. I should probably disclose I'm kind of subtweeting a group of people, and not you. I'm so irritated w/ those who keep insisting Biden will prosecute Trump when he literally keeps telling us he won't. Fantasy and projection are not helpful in any way.
🤣no, they are laughing at you not Biden.
Truer words have never been spoken 👍 biden will opt out for health harris will pick another black woman Todays politics are all about race not qualifications👎 TRUMP / PENCE 2020 ❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Biden doesn’t remember what day it is let alone current events. He remembers the kids playing with his hairy legs though. Lol
I said it to all my friends, they said I was crazy. biden will opt out for health &amp; she will pick another black woman These elections today aren't about your qualifications it's about what color you are 👎👎👎 TRUMP / PENCE ❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
It’s amazing how he continually lies. He lied about Biden defunding police &amp; couldn’t find it when given a chance. We are a connected world economy and can no longer become isolated. We have to learn to deal with trading partners equally &amp; equitably.
Fascist Putin side is more evil than centrist Biden
really. Like when I mentioned this last hour
If Biden wins, it'll be the Cop/Mayo Pete in 2024 because Biden won't make it through to the end of the term.
Listen I'm on board with Mr Biden and Ms Harris but being an extreme progressive I don't expect too much. Just rid us of this disease that is currently oozing from the white house, attorney general office and sec of state. Cause if Trump   steals the election USA won't recover

Donny, your Twitter feed gave Joe Biden's campaign lots of free advertising, this week. Keep up the good work.
I don't want Trump but I am not voting for Biden. So If that means Trump wins 🤷🏾‍♂️ I already survived 4 years of him, sure I can do it again.
please hold Biden accountable and ask him why he plagiarizes every speech?
We're gunna get more high-quality polls now after Biden picked a running mate and conventions start. There will probably be some bounces and marginal shifts.
Maybe Biden forgot he plagiarized? He is dementia.
This is as funny as kamala calling biden a rapist and a racist and being his VP lol
That's bad but biden saying black people ain't diverse is OK..lmaooo can't make this shit up
Joe Biden literally quit a previous Presidential run because of his lies, and yet he ran for both VP and President again.
Joe Biden’s USA.  Be very careful citizens.
And there’s also so many ways to educate this kid in a way that’s more productive like “well I respect your opinion but Biden has been gross towards women and Kamala is responsible for xyz!”This email from the Biden campaign is too accurate
Jack, I just looked up one of these on Biden's campaign web page... SS. He plans to strengthen, not cut it. Where are you getting your info.?
Biden’s climate platform doesnt mention fossi fuels once. If you cared about the environment the most youd vote green
So Ignore The Fact that Biden is a Racist, believes Marriage is only between a man and a woman, and he admitted to quid pro crow, which means he will be impeached???  No Thank You, Give The Nomination to Tulsi.
My mother, who voted for Trump, says she's voting Biden because she really loves Kamala Harris. Says she's very sharp, and was a prosecutor. So much for voting only the top of the ticket.
Of course Biden couldn't do it. Because Biden recognizes the UAE as a nation of slaveholders and supporters of terrorism.  Now, Russia, Saudi Arabia, China and North Korea have to split the pie of owning you one more way. And they're not going to like it.
Of course I'm serious. Biden has an 8-year record as the #2 man in a very successful Presidency. Trump has a 3 1/2-year record as the most spectacularly failed President ever.  He's Pierce, Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Harding, Hoover, Nixon and Dubya all rolled into one.
Of course Biden can do the job. Why wouldn't he?  We know Trump can't do the job.
Somewhat hyperbolic, don't you think? Biden knows he couldn't possibly do anything with taxes until we're out of this depression. However, there was no reason for Trump's corporate tax breaks, and some companies (ie Amazon) should start paying taxes!
I pray with you, and trust me millions of Americans pray every day! We see what the Democrats are doing and sadly Biden is just a puppet for the extreme Left!

Not only that, but somewhere McConnell is saying, this disenfranchisement may not be enough to save Trump, but if it saves a Senate seat or two and we can block Joe Biden, we should do it. The war rages on.
President-elect Joe Biden, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.  161 days before they're sworn in.
If, hypothetically, you could press a button to ensure that Biden 100% wins the election - you should push the button. In fact, denying this is solid evidence that you care too much about elections.
Nah this is straight incorrect. Howie hawkins has a way more progressive platform. Vote for him if you actually believe in those things. I was never going to vote biden to begin with so im not ‘taking a vote away from him’.
I do assume Q members will vote for Trump over Biden for sure.
The problem with a reality TV show is real people get hurt. Even POTUS with the best of intentions, leave ppl out/behind. In my opinion, America is not doing the best that it can right now and I don't think Biden is the answer, but I do believe we have to stop Trump.
Pick your poison this election but this pandemic is the best thing to happen to Biden. You all need to hear him talk unfiltered and field questions before giving him your vote.

Why would she be correct now.  beat her just like he will destroy  and if he doesn’t Biden will destroy America and not even realize he is doing it because he is nothing but a puppet. The debates will reveal how truly clueless Biden is.
That’s fine because thousands of people just decided to vote for Trump when  decided to blame  for the economy and unemployment numbers. Why are Biden/Harris afraid to answer questions? How will raising taxes improve the economy??

Look on the bright side. There's  a fighting chance that Biden might get in, not an exciting prospect in isolation , but he won't be there for long and his black female running mate will take over and then maybe a hint of sanity will come back to American politics.

Absolutely correct. The minute Joe Biden supports a national mask policy, Fox News comes up with a poll saying that 76% of the American public support it. Total BS! Who the hell are they polling?

No, Biden selected Kamala Harris to be his running mate, and together, they will leave Donald Trump's future as flat as a pancake.

The crime bill sucked but when you know better, you do better. The bill had passed with bipartisan support, even a lot from the congressional black caucus. It wasn't controversial back then and that's why Biden gets a pass today.

Besides initial quarantine for Covid, my best guess is when your opponent is sinking himself, stay quiet.   I will agree Biden seems older, but i listened carefully during his interviews and he seems all there to me. Besides, I would vote for a wet rag over Trump for sure.
Not really, Biden knows what year it is.
You can find the statements by all Democrats including Biden, Bernie, Kamla and all in public where they are slamming India and supporting Pakistan.  If you were paid by Democrats for this article, then it is a professional duty you did... But Democrats are Anti-India.
Trump is an idiot, but Joe Biden will be a total puppet. He has a political track record of NOTHING.
It's not pure hate, but that doesn't matter. I wouldn't vote for him regardless. Talk about indignation, that you can diagnose a mental disorder from your home. Who's regurgitating talking points? All I know is Biden is prone to gaffes and apologizes when he needs to. #character
New story on NPR: Biden And Harris To Introduce Their Presidential Ticket In Delaware
How many steps are in between joe biden and a walk on water candidate?
I'm sure the billionaire that openly bragged about groping women is the one they'll feel safe with.   That's not to say Biden gets a pass but it's just another reason why it should've been Bernie running.   Also the dog whistling has turned into a nuclear alert siren.
Joe Biden did not write that tweet. Poor Joe doesn’t even know he’s alive.
Yes it is!!! Who knew Biden would launch #OGwisdom? Watch out!!! His Administration will roar!
Dumbass people only think theres 2 options in an election. Honestly Biden is worse than Trump but it’s trendy to hate Trump
I need answers !! Biden is NOT it
I wish Bob Barker was alive to play Joe Biden on SNL...
No. Biden/Harris being incredibly shitty candidates that will not change anything is what will help trump win
Of course I was never going to vote for Biden. It’s Medicare for All or no vote!
U.S. Coronavirus deaths: 167,789  How many of those would have lived if Trump hadn't decided to govern by spite and, among other things, throw away the Obama-Biden pandemic playbook?
Neither Blacks nor Indians are going to vote for Biden with such antics.
Sorry, don’t want a Biden administration. Medicare for All or no vote!
Bring 'em on. Biden picked somebody even tougher than he is. She can take 'em, and she can dish 'em right back out.  As Toby Ziegler would say, "Ginger, get the popcorn!"
Biden if 5X or 10X more respectful of the fundamental principles of democracy than  or your party. You're done in November.
That shot of Biden riding a bicycle, was THAT in a basement, stupid?
6 terms in the Senate and 2 as Vice President vs. Going bankrupt running casinos. Biden isn't the one who failed in his chosen profession.
I haven’t been following tbh. Trump is a wild man and Biden’s “you ain’t black...” comments turned me off
This was posted well before Biden announced his pick. I am not disappointed at all.
To all Dems complaining about the Kamala pick. First, I disagree and I’m happy with it. But also WHO CARES? I’d vote for Biden-Fork 2020, Biden-Owl 2020, Biden-Chair 2020. Esp. if you have a big platform, your tweets could discourage someone from voting. THIS IS NOT THE YEAR.
Putin isn't done. Putin needs another 4 years to totally dismantle our government. It's Biden vs. Putin.
She's black *and* a cop. I'm sure that will attract black people because of BlackLM &amp; the BlueLM posse for the cop part and not just alienate everybody for the other reason. 🙄  I'd say we're moving into the "...and find out" stage but I suspect Biden's not done fucking about
I don’t have the answers on how to win the votes of black people in America and neither does Trump or Biden.  #wheremyindendentsat #GreenParty2020?
Alright I'm calling it now for Biden. A Dem who gets 58% (!!!) of the 65+ age group wins in a landslide
You can't be this Stupid, Right??? Mail Trucks are Being Replaced with Brand New Ones Thanks To Trump, after Biden gave them No Money for his 8 years as VP.
Biden won’t have a cabinet overtly trying to dismantle the post office, dept of education, environmental regulations.  But will continue to serve Wall Street, health insurance industry, the fossil fuel industry etc
You Just Described Joe Biden, not Donald Trump.
In picking Harris, Biden makes history and plays it safe...strike that....plays it smart and boldly so.
Agreed, but if Trump and Biden were to ever get on stage together that’s basically murder. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 #Trump2020
If the commie hill is the one conservatives want to die on with Biden/Kamala then go right ahead.
THIS DECISION AINT EASY MY NIGGA!!!!! ITS EITHER BIDEN AND KAMALA OR TRUMP AND PENCE WE FUCKED EITHER WAY
I’m not trying to start an argument, probably more a discussion, but who would’ve been your choice as Biden’s VP? I think Harris makes an interesting choice because her tough nature would appeal to people want a law and order administration. Biden is a transitional president.
Imagine being a part of the campaign that failed so miserably and gave us Trump and then having the nerve to call a rightfully frustrated citizen a douchebag. I’m voting for Biden and I hope all of my fellow progressives too but you people are so arrogant and irritating.
Biden just wants to get in Kamala’s pants
All black votes are going to Biden . He just won this election .
I love when people call Joe Biden "radical." It's like he's been slow-playing everyone for the past 42 years, just waiting for the right opportunity to unleash his true "radical" agenda.
And two of the people who think that are Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
I completely agree, but it's not what shook out. It sucks, but Biden was the moderate choice, and he cleared the field. Should have been Warren, but here we are, and we just have to keep pushing for more great women.
Trump 2020! Or lose to the Democrats who allow our cities to be destroyed! Once the rioters are done there, they will come to our towns and homes!  Biden and Harris is a team who don’t respect each other! Wow what a sick team!
Joe Biden picked the worst possible vice president.
I wonder if Biden remembers Harris castrated him during the debates? Calling with examples a racist! Harris actually supported the sexual claims against Biden! She clearly doesn’t respect or even like him!
creates truth based on what he fears - Biden and Harris knew this would happen, by tomorrow he will pissed off about seeing halal carts on the streets of NYC
No, we weren't. He still very much had a path to victory then, in spite of the constant msm lies claiming he didn't. Neither he nor Biden were anywhere near the required 1991 delegates.
Well, really surprised she walked all over him at the debates, called him a racist and really brought some of the things he said and did against Blacks! Surprised she is a tough woman who also supported the women who claimed Biden of sexual misconduct! Not a good choice!
There's a famous electronics store near Madison Square Garden called B&amp;H Photo &amp; Video. The slogan is "Ya go to B&amp;H!"  We go to B&amp;H. Biden &amp; Harris.
How much you wanna bet the blame will shift to Biden instead of the Dem run cities when he's president.
this white woman has the back of  too. Can’t wait, just can’t wait for this team to bring it home in November. Team Biden/Harris all the way
Will Vote 4 U, But Biden, um NO.
How predictable you are, Sean. Harris is not an extreme socialist. And, she told Biden he's not a racist. Byrd has said joining the clan was a huge mistake. Count the women who have accused Trump of much worse than Biden. Keep trying. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
But Tulsi is half Samoan and a Hindu, so Biden could have said "she's still a woman of color." But we all know it was the Obama faction that picked Harris, not Biden himself. Harris brings nothing to the table.
congratulations to  great choice  you’ll both be great for America. Biden/Harris 2020 all the way. You’ve got this Senator, &amp; we’ve got you! 1st female VP, 1st women of color as VP Now, LETS TAKE IT TO THE FINISH LINE!This is TRULY eye opening. If your vote did not matter, this would not be occurring. They do not bb want Biden and Kamala in office. Trump is committing a crime in plain sight.
Biden is not racism he work with OBAMA very well no problem at all bump this remark from trump ok👋👋👋
Uhhh he’s objectively bad for DACA and other undocumented people seeking legalization. Not that Biden is much better, but, life would be a lot easier under Biden
What did Obama and Biden do for the African Americans in the 8 years in power? Nothing! Remember that when you vote.

This is the same senile fool who weeks ago said "Trump has given up as president because of covid-19".  So what does Joe Biden do? He picks the one candidate whot:     * Got ZERO delegates  * Was the first candidate to quit after universally rejected by democrats.
* : "Since we have 'no doubt' Joe Biden was leading in the polls,**  scotus should rule in favor of Biden /Harris, or lose ALL credibility &amp; be responsible for more riots &amp; bloodshed!"   ** MSM is exaggerating Joe Biden's lead, if he even has one, to justify removing 45!
*I have no doubt  &amp;  in conjunction with the mainstream media , esp.  are going to use Coronavirus to perform a #CoupDetat on November 3rd.  *MSM : "We won't know the winner for weeks,but polls had Biden ahead". *CNN "Trump did this 2 stay in office!

The whole "we get him out with a Biden landslide" trope is bullshit, right? Does anyone know where that originated?
He would know an island from a peninsula . He moved his residency to Florida because  as soon as Biden says I do they're indicting him on some serious charges oh yes there going to be an arrest. The presidency saved him for now , because you can't indict a sitting president.
That's a negative  Biden has a proven 8 years in the White House record Kamala has a public background  prosecutorial background,. Trump and his so call pro are a bunch of money grubbing do nothing's. Trump has claimed bankruptcy 9 times every business hes started tanked
Ok. Yeah. Why not endorse Joe Biden? That might help. Or You Need To Calm Down
MAGA by electing Biden Harris!
Believe me, if anyone  got to interview Biden, the questions would be “How are you?” and “What’s your name?” with no follow up when he answers “Steve.”

Jill Biden “cares” is pushing a man sliding down the slope of dementia for a job he cannot handle. That’s some sort of caring!

If you live in a state that isn’t likely to be an easy Biden win, you should consider voting in person, early if possible, if you feel you can do so safely. If you need to vote by mail, apply ASAP, and return your ballot in person if you can, mail it ASAP if you must mail it.
My democratic black family are not happy about Joe Biden &amp; Harris, the only ones I see celebrating are white liberals.  The same ones who were screaming BLM a few weeks back.  These people don't care about black lives.  I love seeing others see things for what they are.
So your argument is "He is the President of the United States - why would we expect him to know about the 14th Amendment or even his own administration's legal position on this issue?" Biden or Harris could answer the question. Or Rubio or Haley - both children of non-citizens.

Omg this is why i hope biden loses because of ppl like you
Just looked at the Biden-Harris website for the first time and got literal heart palpitations seeing Kamala's face &lt;3
Do you still believe his accusers?  Do you still think Biden is a racist?
Telling y'all...nobody wants Biden.
Trump’s Plan An Election Win No Matter What-Reducing the number of Biden voters by as much as possible.  -Increasing the number of Biden voters mailing in their votes.  -Wrecking the U.S. Postal Service so votes don’t get received on time, or can’t get counted in a timely way.1/2
If Joe Biden's health continues to get worse I believe that Kamala will be sworn in as president. It may not be in the first 100 day's or the first week. It will be on the first day. That's if Joe and Kamala were to win this election.
Expansion? You mean the worst economy since the great depression created by Obama and Biden tax and spend and democrat failed housing initiatives.
i never said not to vote biden harris, just that harris is a shitty choice
You are bunch of liars and cheaters who have destroyed our country because of your lust for power! The Biden/Harris ticket will save our country!
Can anybody tell me what Biden saying in this video ,,🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back  via
Biden Harris the 46th Team, mission is to save the USA
This sounds great! Thanks for giving me more reasons to vote for Biden/Harris!
I’ve been to jail twice and I’d hate to get some bs ass charge and then be in jail FOREVER bc y’all bitches started voting for Biden bc you and Kamala in the same fuccn sorority...
Biden’s a moderate, always has been, for the most part.  The “radical left” and “Bernie agenda” won’t work. And the “open borders” argument, oldest scare tactic in the book.
Guys please vote Biden. He wasn’t the best option but he’s way better than the orange man in the White House right now
Biden picked the most antiblack black candidate possible amazing 😂
Someone please tell Biden to stfu.  Bad enough most of his "supporters" are just voting for him in spite of 45.
Am I the only one who is the least bit excited about Kamala Harris?  Her resume is tainted.  Biden obviously picked her cuz of the diversity factor to bring in the votes.  It's either Biden/Harris or Trump/Pence.  People would vote for Tom &amp; Jerry as long as it's against Trump.
Assuming capital gains rates in ten years is egregious right now. Trump wants to elongate them and Biden wants to triple them. Huge potential dispersion of outcomes.
Biden has been a known liar and plagiarist for 45 years
You're either unredeemably cynical or you've seriously drunk the #Republican Kool Aid. Biden/Harris is a fine, stable ticket for.our country after the wack-job theft-ring  that has been the Trump administration.
Am definitely voting for Biden !
I saw some clips from the Biden-Harris thing yesterday and was glad to see the focus on Trump’s incompetence rather than his moral turpitude, which didn’t work in 2016.
Thank you finally someone else see’s the positive and hoping for a change for this country #KamalaHarris  Joe Biden
How about Joe Biden?
The people who are like Biden wasn’t my choice. If I can’t have Bernie I guess I’m voting Trump... are you for real? Like you really think Trump is the best choice after all of what he has caused?
Tbh cuz ion fuck wit Biden either 🤦🏾‍♂️😭
Biden - Harris to the finish line!!!
not the same people who said we need an “electable” candidate like biden getting mad. i thought he was electable? now is your chance to prove it.
Top story: WATCH: New Trump ad hammers Biden/Harris over Joe's endless array of racial gaffes  see more
Well I sure don’t think you support Biden
Joe Biden has been in government for almost 50 years getting paid every day...can you name 5 major accomplishments he has had. I’ll even give you one...the disasterous 1994 Crime Bill...so seriously, try without Googling (it doesn’t help) Name 4 accomplishments...
Yes, of course, you're right.  Then you should consider yourself lucky, at least he's not charging you to play, unlike Obama/Biden.
Can you be any more biased? Running interference for Biden. I think it's you guys who should have your 1st amendment rights looked at, you no longer are the arbiter of truth.  Far from it actually, you act more like the propaganda wing of the DNC, Goebbels would be proud.
I thought she was running for BO, what’s all this President talk...Ohhhhhhh so you all know that Biden is a prop, thanks for confirming!
I think it makes them both racist. They both support the same racist agenda. No? Just bcz she is a POC doesn't make her exempt from racism. Biden found the perfect running mate...someone who locked up more blacks than he did.
Americans have a clear choice to make. They can either stand with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris or they can stand with Donald Trump, the Republican Party, and the people pictured below. I know where I stand. Biden/Harris 2020
Can’t wait to say President Biden. Cause lord knows I’ll never give Trump that much respect
She used the Biden dildo.

Ummmm! Ok buddy! This is not a game though and we will see how sharp he really is when the country votes in November. We could GIF each other all day, but I have better things to do like go and donate to Biden/Harris ticket. You can get off my lawn now fella!

She need to worry about Trump mental decline he's in worst shape than Biden .
fuck biden fuck trump we've been given the illusion of choice but the reality is the system is fucked
Joe Biden used to believe Mrs Hillary Clinton should've been the President of the United States of America not Mr Donald Tump. But that was before he nominated Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate for VP, somebody who makes all of us look younger.🌟This email from the Biden campaign is too accurate
Really? You name 1 thing Biden/Harris have done for the black community and I will name 5 things Trump has done for the black community!
I find the Biden/Harris ticket insulting as a woman. The VP was chosen based on color and gender period! I would love for someone to tell me why they’re voting for these two clowns!
Socialism and Marxism can not work and will never work. Biden’s ideas lead to the destruction of the USA . Look at Chicago, NYC, Seattle, Baltimore, and Venezuela. Is that what thru want for the USA 🇺🇸?
I'm not sure. She really does hit every point Biden needs - adds diversity to the ticket, adds relative youth, is a credible President, has an impressive resume.   I think she would have been in the thick either way, but the public knows her now and she's been fully vetted.
So Ignore The Fact that Biden is a Racist, believes Marriage is only between a man and a woman, and he admitted to quid pro crow, which means he will be impeached???  No Thank You, Give The Nomination to Tulsi.
Are you for Biden?
we have a biden/harris table of books at work and some woman stopped on her way out of the store to take the time to flip them all over so you couldn’t see the covers 🙄
They have, but they're all voting for Biden and the right calls them liberals now.
People post memes because they have no argument! You want to know how dumb people are? They chose a VP to run w/ Biden based on color not on qualifications! That tells you exactly what the dems think of the idiots that vote for them!
We've been saying the both of them are saving the places of the real nominees. Never seen Biden ever going that far, without health issues.

it seems that Biden did not pick an African. American woman. Le metieron gato por liebre.
Biden can't pronounce his own name at this point.
I would vote for Biden. On 2016, I made the mistake of voting for the green party. Didn't like Trump or Hillery. I think Biden picking  Kamala is a winner.
Did Biden need a cheet sheet?
Vote Biden-Harris 2020 If You Want to Kill the Republic
But Biden can win one electoral vote in Nebraska.  Trump cannot win any NY EC votes
He also reversed Biden’s crime bill that put more black people in jail for misdemeanors. And pardoned wrongfully convicted people. Which were from the black community. And under Trump the Black businesses start ups has increased 400%!
please hold Biden accountable and ask him why he plagiarizes every speech?
Speaking of peculiar arguments, this one would certainly qualify: "Your guy is more senile than my guy." Biden's mental decline is undeniable. You may have decided that it doesn't matter &amp; you're going to vote for him anyway, but denying reality makes you look pretty foolish.
Maybe Biden forgot he plagiarized? He is dementia.
If Biden- Harris win, they will reverse it and make Iran more powerful by renewing the nuclear deal. That’s a real threat to not only America but the world. They are a real threat and shouldn’t win.
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris  *(And a whole bunch of other lies and racist comments.* MY VIEWS
Voting for Biden will bring this... This judge wants to destroy an 8-year old boy whose crazy mother wants him to be a girl. And they order the father to pay for it!
If Biden wins, China will enter the US market even more aggressively than before. It’s a real threat.
Why does Biden's chief opponent's top attack surrogate deserve a spot at all? Biden and his team giving this much airtime to Sanders' team is pretty magnanimous.
Wow the greatest idea by the Biden/kamala team: wear a mask. I thought that was Trumps idea and his administration? Plagiarized idea again.

This Was Awkward: Joe Biden's Handoff to Kamala Was Strange, Weird and What Was He Doing with that Podium Tap?
A while back she said she was voting for Biden because she thinks he'll be a weaker enemy.
did not threaten Joe Biden. She said what everyone is thinking. His dementia is worsening and he isn’t the official nominee yet. Dems can pull the rug out from under him at any time. That’s why the Republicans haven’t really started their ads against him.#ridiculous
Well, they did have the Soros/Biden playbook of Planned Looting &amp; Destruction and Wilmington wasn't listed today.
GUYS WE CANNOT FUCK THIS UP. I know y’all don’t love Biden but Trump needs to go 😅
That is Fake, David Duke and The KKK have endorsed Biden.
Just like Obama and Biden did
I did and it went directly to  no bypassing through at all. Now we have definitive proof of the connection!                         Antifa &amp; Biden = Perfect Together
FOX Business just said the first thing on the Biden website is a mask with their logo. All they need now is a hat so all of his supporters look exactly the same. First they control you by virus, then they make you all look the same. Then freeze wages. Communism anyone?
Neil Cavuto corrects team Trump for saying Kamala called Biden a racist, his colleague pushes back

I like how Biden’s pick for VP is so important to people, Joe Biden said it’s easy being Vice President b/c you don’t have to do anything and agrees it’s like being the grandparent instead of the parent
He’s spent his life failing. And you of all people who had a personal distaste for his politics and now you’re riding his wagon. What does that say about you? Easily bought and paid for! Better hold on to that money cause you’re not going any further with Biden.

Sorry Donald.  Biden/Harris will win unless you change your ways to the environment (leave salmon alone).  Listen to your son. He’s smart and correct.   It’sl not safe.  to kill the wildlife I. China needs to
So Biden all of a sudden isn’t a weirdo pedo cause Kamala is next to him ..
Wrong again the previous play book from Obama/Biden is what caused the problem to begin with. They had to revamp the entire system.
You’re talking about Epstein lol ok 75,000 in hot dogs Obama ordered and Hillary recommending he use their designated site. And then you have Pevy Biden with his mits all over children like Lester the molester. You must agree with all of that madness. Can’t see it any other way.
These people eat all kinds of bullshit. Trump has created such a strong economy. There is more money being injected into this country than ever before. If this pandemic happens during Obama/Biden we would be doomed. We barely made it through the Obama recessions.
And yet you still can’t come up with anything Biden has done for blacks.
So besides a crime bill that Biden signed in 94 to put more blacks in jail for misdemeanors, what did he do?

I am praying to God to give we the people the power and strength to go to the poll to vote Trump out of office.Speaking with friends and family to vote for Biden.
Politics are so..meh. She dogged Biden til the cows came home (and vice versa) and now she’s his running mate. I get it but 😒
At the beginning of the process I supported Biden, them I shifted to Warren, then Harris, and then back to Biden. So I am elated about the Biden/Harris ticket.
As if there was any doubt who I was voting for...This just cements my decision!

The people who voted for Biden in the primaries are the ones who will have saddled us with Trump.

If Trump is reelected. the fault lies with the people who voted for Biden in the primaries.
If Biden hadn't run, our (in my case, free-speech-antiwoke-liberals) camp may have rallied behind someone else suitable - perhaps Bloomberg or Klobuchar, and their numbers would've been better.
Biden is not racism he work with OBAMA very well no problem at all bump this remark from trump ok👋👋👋
If you're a moderate, or a free-speech-liberal, your camp might have looked at all their options and early on coalesced onto Biden, resulting in dismal results for other candidates of that flavour. Even though most such candidates would pair well with Biden.

WTF are you doing? U still on the Warren Bandwagon when Warren is on the BIDEN bandwagon? If u want Trump gone, u need to stop and vote blue. This election is too important. Revisit the Warren ticket in 4 more years.
It will be amazing to see you as a Vice President, and hopefully, once you and Biden fix this mess, it will be even better to see you as the first Woman President of the United States.
Biden is a believer in communism, Americans awaken
This is just a stunning embarrassment for Bruni and the Times. The woman candidate isn’t emotional enough for you to connect with? She’s insufficiently harping on her background for you to feel that frisson you were hoping for?
One reason a day until election on why you should vote for Biden, a thread:  8️⃣0️⃣ days till election (reason 21): Trump promoted birtherism against President Obama. Trump is now publicly questioning whether Kamala Harris is eligible despite being born in Oakland, California
Biden doesn’t remember how to drive
I’m glad I’m one of them.

Interesting. People are really upset with Angela Davis for supporting Kamala Harris. Yes Kamala’s done some fucked up, inexcusable things in her career. But if y’all are not voting Biden/Harris I genuinely wanna know what’s the alternative?
Biden really only need WI, Michigan, Ohio and PA
And yet Wallace carries Biden’s water. 🙄🙄🙄
I need an edit of the "Whatever It Takes" trailer for Avengers Endgame, except instead of Thanos, it's Trump talking about the awful things he's done, and really, it's a blatent "Vote For Biden" ad because we're not gonna last another four years under this buffoon.
"The Ultimate Recovery: Cycles of Pain Anchor Biden's Moment" by The Associated Press via NYT
Funny how suggesting both candidates meet a neutral Black leader is some how sabotaging Biden campaign. Why is it that his campaign is so dependent on Black people getting the shaft n not complaining about it? Seems like they want to continue business like usual not change things

My man just gobbling White dick and calling it empowerment 😪 which celebrity or talking head told you evicting Trump was Black people top priority like racism is all trump and his folks. Like Biden n Kamala aren’t as anti Black as him but in sheep clothes. Wake up
Unless Biden goes into complete basement mode and lets Harris be the surrogate, I don't think the focus on her lasts more than a couple of weeks. Chatter will still come up.  But do you think they'd just ignore Biden?  I support him, and recognize there is MATERIAL on him.
Good for you.
What was irresponsible was nominating Biden in the first place.
I can oppose Biden and not vote for Trump.
Fuck Biden, Fuck Trump, I’m voting for this guy 😳🇩🇴
But Biden knows UKRAINE CASH. He and Hunter know that to a tee.
Biden dosen’t know where his basement toilet is.
How do you feel about Biden's accuser? ##metoounlessitsbiden #MeToo
lobbyist bought biden’s brother an island 10 miles from epstein’s
LDS For Biden followed me and i’m neither LDS nor For Biden but okay
Afraid if Biden has to answer a question off the top of his head, he won’t know what’s going on without teleprompter or notes. They again, he could always tell us his CORNPOP story.
Biden's been itching to cut Social Security for decades. Social Security will be on the chopping block regardless of who wins in Nov.
would you please explore facilitating voting in #Ohio, #Pennsylvania, #Michigan, and #Wisconsin? CA is in the bag for #Biden/#Harris, unless an unforeseen disaster strikes.
Let's ask our liberal friends to answer:  Do you agree with Joe Biden's policy to restore Law and Order to America?
Wow this is actually the first time all year I’ve been legit excited to vote for Biden!
That would be Biden and Hunter.
Are teachers relevant anymore? Biden will keep it shut for a while.
Harris / Biden would put it deep in their pockets looking for more.
Wow, that's a lot of work to do for the average Biden supporter 😉
Was never my first choice either but I will crawl through smoldering wreckage to vote for Biden if I have to. Framing it in these terms is basically whining about having to make difficult choices in order to save democracy in this country.
Thats the thing the Biden ticket is offering the same old okey doke, zero solutions.
. you need to bring  the help your election! Biden and Kamala weekness is #China !
If Biden voters can riot in person they can vote in person

You LOST me at "The Biden-Harris ticket is formidable"   The only and I mean ONLY way  loses in 2020 is Election?Voter Fraud........
Serious question: is there an actual political strategy here, or are you just being an idiot. You are aware Biden won’t be spending a dime in New York no matter what you tweet, right.
I think his chances of 2024 are done if Biden wins which I fully expect.  I highly doubt Kamala would step aside. Maybe a shot at VP though.
So I guess Biden fits your standard of what a Catholic is then..
I suspect Amy K will be getting her reward soon.  After Clyburn, she did more to boost Biden's campaign than anyone. Both with the endorsement and gracefully bowing out of VP.  What Biden does for her is more important than Harris's graciousness.
wrong. his voters are accultured now to not wearing masks or believing in the dangers of covid...they will go to their local polling place and vote for him happily, even rationalizing that if they do die, it'll be for their country. biden voters are more cautious, so we're fucked
Krystal and Saagar: New Poll Reveals Biden's BIGGEST Vulnerability  via
Joe Biden the liar and plagiarism expert
I love you Leo!  So full of energy. Biden stinks.  TRUMP 2020. He better give you that hat.
“And Biden doesn’t even know the name of the countries that I’m talking about” 😂😂😂😂
The literally whole 2020 election game plan has been to fear monger Trump. Especially where Black people are concerns. A Blue State could have a racial situation they refuse to address and it’s “Look how’s Trump doing us going vote Biden to stop this”
Biden's son had just died, Clinton had very recently been extremely popular, had great relationships with vital Dem constituencies, and oh yeah, won the fuckin' popular vote. Baring Comey and Wikileaks, she walks to the presidency. Because she lost doesn't make it a bad choice.
You have entirely too much faith that America the organization will stop going to war and that Biden once elected will appoint good judges that will be helpful to black society. Dems want to abolish BM and we still got to vote on those other issue, nice try tho
With Trump in office Black people’s eyes are open to the racism with Kamala and Biden many of us will be sheep. Who ever wins the plans are roughly the same only with Democrats in a opposition positions they will be more willing to come to the table with tangible next cycle.
You can’t saying your not trying to let things get worst as you are campaigning for the worst option. Biden/Kamala can get more done in the form of oppressing Black society because they are positions as our “teammates”. All eyes are on Trump so it’s easier to counter his racism.
How is Biden a centrist. I love how you act like he isn’t a proven racist who if given the presidency would quadruple the amount of Black people in prison. Motherfucker already promised to increase their budget not defund or demilitarize.
How are they far worst? Can you point to any Trump policy that’s been as destructive to Black society as the Biden’s Law? You do know Kamala Harris refused to prosecute cops? Please explain how Biden/Kamala r the lesser of two evils to Black society? With words not talking points
I have a Republican browbeating me in another thread to vote for Biden. He actually accused ME of being a fascist sympathizer.
This the type shit Biden and company gonna be on.. I don’t wanna go to jail y’all
Over 170,000 dead.  Over 5 million cases of Covid. Financial crisis of epic proportion. Rights being infringed upon. There IS no choice.  You don't have to like Biden, he is not your friend.  You just have to vote for him.  trump must go.
Biden is barely center left, you dipshits
Well that's the thing, Biden wants your vote more than he wants mine. Best of luck in Nov.
My democratic black family are not happy about Joe Biden &amp; Harris, the only ones I see celebrating are white liberals.  The same ones who were screaming BLM a few weeks back.  These people don't care about black lives.  I love seeing others see things for what they are.
Biden &amp; Harris perfect combination to destroy that orange devil!! #2020
Everyone must want trump to win again, because if y’all keep bashing kamala or Biden, y’all got no choice but to let trump win again.
Have you ever encountered anyone for whom Biden WAS their first choice? I sure as hell haven't.
One reason a day until election on why you should vote for Biden, a thread:  8️⃣1️⃣ days till election (reason 20): Trump made hush-money payments to women like Stephanie Clifford after sleeping with her while Melania was pregnant with their child.
Thanks for the reply. I should probably disclose I'm kind of subtweeting a group of people, and not you. I'm so irritated w/ those who keep insisting Biden will prosecute Trump when he literally keeps telling us he won't. Fantasy and projection are not helpful in any way.
🤣no, they are laughing at you not Biden.
If Biden wins, it'll be the Cop/Mayo Pete in 2024 because Biden won't make it through to the end of the term.
Listen I'm on board with Mr Biden and Ms Harris but being an extreme progressive I don't expect too much. Just rid us of this disease that is currently oozing from the white house, attorney general office and sec of state. Cause if Trump   steals the election USA won't recover
Hoping AG Barr announces the arrest of Biden today. Cleveland and Miami raid. Where’s Hunter???
If y’all don’t understand politics just say that. The way y’all ranting &amp; raving about Biden &amp; Harris got me looking at y’all like....
No thank you. I would rather not have a private company with access to my votes. Who do you think the CEO’s support? Ever had a “lost package”? I think there will be a lot of lost Biden votes, should have got the insurance.

We're gunna get more high-quality polls now after Biden picked a running mate and conventions start. There will probably be some bounces and marginal shifts.
This is as funny as kamala calling biden a rapist and a racist and being his VP lol
That's bad but biden saying black people ain't diverse is OK..lmaooo can't make this shit up
Joe Biden literally quit a previous Presidential run because of his lies, and yet he ran for both VP and President again.
All of you all are ridiculous if you think for a second she or Biden are comparative to trump. He can’t even name 10 presidents. He doesn’t know when world war 2 ended. He tear gased American citizens. He condones racism and bigotry... and still somehow you all compare them smh
And there’s also so many ways to educate this kid in a way that’s more productive like “well I respect your opinion but Biden has been gross towards women and Kamala is responsible for xyz!”

You are so right about Biden's ideology. I suspect what's happening is the Dem establishment and Never Trump Republicans are consolidating power not to stop the fascism, but rather to crush the left.
One thing is to be a trumper, but another thing is to be a Republican looking forward to see a new President this 2020 election. America more united than ever, with or without Mail-in-Ballots  One Nation  On November 3rd Trump is done!
(to be clear, what I mean is use access only afforded by one's role for political purposes - if it were open to everyone - if Biden and whomever the Greens and LP folk nominated could use the Whitehouse for this, less a problem)

And what if Biden doesn't win? It could happen! Yeah I don't want to think about it either but JFC stop selling out the absolute basics people should demand from government.
"Yay, Fed Ex delivered all the ballots and now Biden is President" -- yeah that's cool, but he doesn't take office til January (if all goes smoothly!) and the time between now and then will bankrupt what few functioning small businesses we have left.
According to Biden it’s whoever votes for him.

i  guess we can thank joe biden for this movie
Yes Dr. Biden. For sure. As  says “Hope reborn.”
With Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his "running mate," my latest for  looks at how that term originated in double-harness horse-racing in the mid-19th century before making the jump to politics.
The race between Trump/Pence and Biden/Harris shows the degraded state of American politics. Biden’s selection of Harris is the latest proof that racialist politics is reactionary. For genuine socialism! Vote

Trump’s Plan An Election Win No Matter What-Reducing the number of Biden voters by as much as possible.  -Increasing the number of Biden voters mailing in their votes.  -Wrecking the U.S. Postal Service so votes don’t get received on time, or can’t get counted in a timely way.1/2
Two reasons we have President Trump and VP Pence are the Clinton/Kaine ticket didn't pass some purity tests, and it wasn't inspirational enough. Please remember what's at stake this year, and vote for the better option of Biden and Harris.
This is part of the reason a 71/29 Biden poll is so meaningless when the White House will do everything in its power to keep democrats from voting.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Expansion? You mean the worst economy since the great depression created by Obama and Biden tax and spend and democrat failed housing initiatives.
The real question is - when will  be endorsing Biden/Kamala? Now that the VP has been picked, no need to wait any longer.
I think...I THINK this is her saying not to send in your mail-in ballot for Joe Biden because you might end up with the black lady.   That's what I think she was probably going for.   I say this without looking at a clip because why would I do that to myself?  #BidenHarris
in all seriousness: those who are voting need to show up bc they’re already showing signs of trying to cheat this election. it’s not in the bad just bc Biden is popular, that’s the same mistake Hillary made.

I don't know why they assume greens would consider voting 4 biden w/o da g party. Some might, others wouldnt
Stop equating conservative and racist, this narrative is ridiculous. Trump won an award from the NAACP because he pioneered racial parity in the golfing community. Trump sued the government to make it happen lmao. Meanwhile Biden was riding shotgun with a KKK grand dragon.

? Not sure k agree or disagree but can if biden wins you can cover the higher taxes
btw, I'm voting for Biden because Trump is a neofascist and is actively trying to remove the tools of democracy. To me, he is a stop-gap president that we will challenge and challenge hard in four years. I wish everyone voted for Biden but they have a right to their vote.

The whole point of the argument "black people voted for Biden" argument is to literally tokenize black people and monothing the group. I'm telling you that you can disable the argument by exactly suggesting that black people, based on age and voting patterns, are not monolithic.
Trump is going to destroy Biden/Harris. He really knows how to speak to the people. Even dumbbells should be able to understand this. Then again, there's the MSM aka. DNC operatives.
Doesn't change my point. Biden is a sexual qssaulter, hair sniffer, nonconsual kisser and toucher. He IS the Patriarchy.
Do you think we have a shot at a fair enough election to get Biden in? Because I'm starting to lose faith, Ming.
Very True. That includes authors of the op-ed “endorsing” Elizabeth Warren to be Biden’s VP. I wonder how did that work out? Obviously, it didn’t. Not at all.
Klobuchar polling at 5% &amp; Buttigieg polling above that, that alone provides the 10% margin which Biden used to win in numerous states during Super Tuesday. Add on to the fact that Warren remained in the race pulling votes from Sanders. The strategy against Sanders was clear.
Compassion? Lol. Joe Biden literally said "Lock the SOBs up" while arguing for the crime bill.
Oh, poor delusional child. Don't be projecting on me. You're being manufactured to consent, you're the one voting for Biden.
Post it directly to Biden and thank you for bringing a voice to this murderous practice.
Biden has zero political argument if Trump took a time to resonate with people  on this issue.He knows he can't go with depth in this issue,so why not navigate as his opponents are doing? They know he can't hit em  back on this given his position,yet Trump can elaborate on masks
If Rubio and Kasich had done for Cruz in 2016 what Buttigieg and Klobuchar did for Biden in 2020, we wouldn’t have Trump.
Right, like when they fought tooth and nail for Bernie and did everything to destroy Jewish Biden.
Yes. Joe Biden has been accused of inappropriately touching 8 women and sexual assaulting one of them. Patriarchy is running a predator as our nominee.
Hell their are senators and congressmembers that’s are voting for him at this point Biden is the gops saving grace they won’t survive if trump re-elected 🤦🏾‍♂️

I definitely agree on the first count, and this may be naive of me but I don't think at this moment people will check out even if Biden is in--things are too bad. I also don't believe the Democratic Party would learn a lesson if he lost, they will never learn and they don't care

Last week Biden posted a lie about Trump (regarding “fine people”) but it is not flagged; neither was a tweet by Iran’s leader threatening the use force on the US. But Twitter did flag Trump tweets about issues with mail-in ballots and that he will use force against rioters.
Anyway, the only things that is different between Donald and Biden is that Donald is more preferred by the oil companies and Biden is preferred by Silicone Valley. Military contractors and etc would be fine with either. The would still get billions, as show by Democratic Congress
Oh, I encourage it. If you think that Biden can beat him, you’re smoking crack.

Haha. Can’t make this stuff up. So the people that are supposed to deliver  the ballots, support Biden? Unbelievable
Um, hearing Joe Biden say the words "I badly need you", is just, well, a little unsettling....
i can see your point but idk if I agree. I've thought a lot about it and I think it isn't an Obama situation where people will go back to sleep.  A lot has happened in the past 5 years. In some ways I think it could be easier to mobilize the left under Biden.

This is evident by the fact that despite all major moderates withdrawing, states such as Colorado, Minnesota, Massachussets, Texas and Maine saw Biden only beat Sanders by less than a 10% margin. That is DESPITE the entire moderate and centrist vote going to Biden.
The Democratic Party had to coalesce around Biden before Super Tuesday or else the moderate vote would have been split to such a degree that Sanders would have received wins in numerous states.
If you were stupid enough to vote for Joe Biden in the primary, or Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary, you need to watch this video
Top Contributors, federal election data for Joe Biden, 2020 cycle • OpenSecrets
Is there a dumber right-wing-troll take out there than wild-eyed Marxist radicals... centrist Joe Biden and former federal prosecutor Kamala Harris? I mean, why not call them poopyheads, it has just as much substance.
Actually POTUS lost a billion from 3.1 to 2.1 net worth from 2019 to 2020 and went from 275 to 1011 in the USA per Forbes.  However. Your point is well taken.  His 400k salary goes to other agencies.  Never mind Maxine, Schumer, Biden and Feinstein. Career pols grifting.
That's because Biden supporters are the silent minority. 😂🤣
Oh, I know that, and it was an answer regarding supporting Biden over Trump. In no way, shape or form is Bowman politically aligned with Biden and if you did even a tiny bit of research you'd know that too.
The hero America needs. #SaveUSPS #BidenHarris #Biden #HarrisBiden2020
Did Trump release his taxes? Cuz Biden did.
A will know they messed up when they see Biden speak after  It will be like seeing the future while stuck in the past. #YangGang #YangIsSpeaking
GOP are ready to blow up minor errors by investigators in 16 RussiaHacking &amp; turn it into a  crime spree. Theyll go aft Obama &amp; Biden. Next step 4 Fascism so dont be surprised if they try to arrest them &amp; say the election was hacked. #Belarus #USFascism
UMM Biden is isn't a Conservative so🙄🤔
You really think there are people on the fence? You really think someone who is leaning for Trump is going to switch and vote Biden?  REALLY???
Denying ventilators to states bc of personal beefs. Throwing away Covid tests bc people dying in blue states is politically advantageous to him.  An end to all asylum and the Remain in Mexico policy.  I'll never defend Biden but I think there are ways Trump is uniquely sadistic.
Short-term? How can you not see? Short-term Biden and Trump are exactly the same. So what's the point? Do you think voting for Biden will stop the protests? Occupy Wall Street and Ferguson Protests happened under Obama and Biden
Taxes are going up if Biden wins
And Joe started about 3 feet from home and needed jim clyburn, obama, and tom perez to intervene + MSNBC and CNN structuring coverage to advantage #StatusQuoJoe  Biden: greater name recognition, has been running for president since the 80’s, also an old white man and christian…
you know me I get like at least 200 to 300 followers a day and I’ve only been on here since March and now all of a sudden every day I have less and less this is no joke I had no idea this whole Trump Biden thing would be “such a thing”  I’m really not into it ugh
They didn’t endose Biden the child raper and racist so we all good with voting for Trump
Biden is taking away the postal service?
Are these the same polls that said he had no path to victory? I don't give them allot of credibility anymore. You roll your sleeves up, put your head down and do the work in front of you to make Biden the next POTUS on 11/4/2020. That's how you win not polls.
Because Bowman wants universal healthcare. He ran on that. And you want to lie to yourself and say Bowman aligns with Biden just because he supports Biden over Trump, that doesn't mean they are politically aligned. Which is obvious if you did a bit of critical thinking.
Yes x 100%.  I think they are also sick of him and hoping for Biden to win and take over. If he wasn't so evil somebody might've stepped up and said something.  I imagine they're just like 🤷.
Ignore my roommate Michael. Biden guy anyways
I think Tlaib, AOC,  are probably looking past Bernie now and are positioning themselves as the new leaders of the left.  If Biden becomes president look for them to try and undermine him from the outset. Just like they did to Pelosi.
This whole USPS thing has me sick. Idk why this is bothering me so much. Like wtf is wrong with this man?Please vote. I beg you all to vote. This is the least of the damage that has been done. I know Biden isn’t our ideal choice but for the love of God we need trump out of office

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to win the election. The target should be not only to get rid of Trump but as many of those cringing cowardly GOP parasites as possible. For America to rebuild we need a clean sweep new blood, new direction.
If Biden spoke and didn't shoo the press away, I'm sure they would. Chris Wallace complains they keep turning him down.

You can’t reform Trump do be more of a good-doer than Biden
Right now, Joe Biden’s strategy of keeping the focus on President Trump and pitching a broad tent is working well,  writes.
Biden was at the top of the polls literally the entire way from the moment he announced. Not by a lot but it was a highly fragmented field. Bernie technically didn’t even beat Pete in Iowa. Except for Nevada he underperformed across the board. Can we stop this already?
I hope Plouffe is advising Biden. There is no better strategist.
You think Biden is really making it till November?? 😂😂😂😂😂 you are watching a movie! Enjoy 🍿
Would not even do a debate if I would be Biden. Why lower yourself to attend a circus? A debate with a chronic liar is no debate at all. Same for Kamala.

Why do you hate cops so much? Why are Democrats so violent these days? Why can’t they actually discuss issues instead of burning things. Is that what you want for the whole country if Biden wins?
which the govt prevented by planning to charge him under the irrelevant Espionage Act, which unjustifiably prohibits that defense. If Rice is demonizing Snowden, I'm extremely glad she wasn't chosen by Biden!
Biden hasn't done that, though.
So if other candidates dropped out and their supporters moved to Biden and not Bernie — what does that tell you?
If your brain was put into a parakeet  the parakeet would fly backwards Joe Biden
Biden or Obama wouldn’t have pulled all the other crap you have pulled. We are not going to be distracted by your shiny, meaningless accord.
No, the bit where the entire Democratic Party had to tell candidates to drop out of the race to support Biden so that together they could stop Sanders. The strategy was clear as day for anyone willing to look at it objectively.

I feel like I need to have both Donald Trump and Joe Biden bumper stickers because they’re both just the two best guys who could possibly run this great nation
Biden is not president yet, but when he is, he will answer truthfully &amp; respectfully, unlike the rude behavior displayed by #TrumpFailedAmerica toward reporters, especially female and worse if minority.For now, he will wait for the agreed upon debates set by the debate commission
#Biden was not the one to pick #Harris it was #Obama , he offered his support only if Harris was #VP.  #HarrisHatesHindus
He recently said he was considering meeting with Maduro and that he was considering withdrawing support for Guiado .. he was instantly attacked publicly by Biden and the rest of the neolibs .. he may back down in the face of the fierce reaction. We should support him on this imo
also I just know I just KNOW all these folk saying shit like that are gonna kick their feet up if Biden wins sharing memes like
I’m more concerned with keeping the House, i voted 3rd party in ‘16 , I feel I need to vote Biden /Harris (Biden is old) but although I know trump won’t take NYS , he may win college but let the next generation know a majority of voters don’t back his policies.
Really? I’m also insulted. But by what you said. How moronic that you make the assumption that Biden was choosing just any woman “pandering” for votes. Being a woman and qualified can be done by the same person.   But you wouldn’t know about that.   #BidenHarris

Biden is telling us that in July the GOP raised approx 26 million more than the DNC ... he seems distressed. Clearly he wasn't aware of us at all. Now he's begging us for even 'five bucks' ... why would he need our money anyhow, he's got his big donors.
In response to the "old black people voted for Biden," just point out that young black people voted for Bernie, and the only common denominator of what Biden won was boomers. No more, no less. Had nothing to do with race.

How/why did you oppose Biden on bedrock issues last year and now you support him and are his VP?

She should tell Biden that...
It's a new class of bot. Older accounts are hacked and all their tweets are wiped. Then suddenly they got on a tweeting spree pushing propaganda. So you've got grandmamagee from 2008 with 159 tweets suddenly posting Biden is satan.
You should be focusing on getting Biden to throw in some Funky Winkerbean references as Rust Belt outreach.
No I do not hope he beats Trump and here's why. Biden wants a coup in Venezuela, Trump wants to recognize Maduro and dump Guiado. Biden wants to continue the Afghanistan war, Trump wants to end it. I won't support either of them, but Trump is definitely the 'lesser evil'
Nope. I think a Biden administration is worse for the world.

Nowhere in Biden’s agenda, or on its website, does the campaign mention one of the biggest promises it made during the primary: a 100-day moratorium on any deportations of immigrants already in the United States.
How did you oppose Biden on bedrock issues and now you support him?  “It was a de...bate. He he. It was a debate. It was a debate. Literally, the whole reason it was a debate. It was called a he he debate. There were journalists there covering the debate because it was a debate.”

Lol. Ok. I supported Bernie in the primary in 2016 and 2020, but right now I'm on Team Biden... Can't believe there are people now peeps who wud vote against Biden or not at all to own the centrists. 4 years is enough for me with such a right wing government
What is odd is your attacks on Biden’s son Good God, man, Jared had a federal plan for fighting Covid and dropped it when he saw spikes in blue states. Jared deliberately let Americans die. Focus on that FACT!
It blows uo trumps argument that Biden and Harris are “the Radical Left”
They need me to use the power of inherent contempt and start arresting these people.  Literally the future of the country is at stake.  When Biden wins the election there needs to be a commission to go after every one of these criminals and lock them away.
I actually read something that gave me pause and got me thinking about the subject a bit harder  - but I would have still had a rebuttal to the person since I didn’t go up for Kamala nor Biden in the primaries but my rebuttal would be more a personal theory with evidence
That’s exactly what they want. They want Biden to lose so they can spend the next 4 yrs how they spent the last 3.5. Saying Sanders would have won, Spew establishment bs, saying they were right when in truth they were actively undermining Biden. They don’t give a crap
i actually did read into his climate plan and it’s not the worst? it’s not the green new deal but it is a lot more progressive than i expected from biden. idk. i’m still not sure what to do re: voting.

Hillary Clinton carried Oregon by 11 points in 2016 (and the GOP hasn't won there since 1984). But the continued menance of the violent Left will give Trump a chance to narrow that gap. Biden will almost certainly win the state, but by a less impressive margin. #PortlandRiots

Did the donors force the electorate to choose Biden? No. Voters chose Biden, and by a pretty large margin. Trying to delegitimize the process b/c you don’t like the outcome is despicable.
They’ll think Biden winning will have fixed fascism and corruption in the same way they thought Obama being elected fixed racism
If Joe Biden wins in November, I will make a top 100 gaffes video. Actually, by that time, it will probably be 150. Going to be a 2 hour video.
Markets should be pricing in would-be Biden win already — they're not
You said you agree with Biden that people can lose their “black” based on how they mark a piece of paper.  I’m saying I don’t think they can. Voting doesn’t determine race. You can feel any way you want, you don’t have to agree with me, nothing you feel will remove your race imo
“If that (Biden wins) happens, they (CCP China) will own the United States. Cannot let that happen.”
The people who voted for Biden in the primaries are the ones who will have saddled us with Trump.
How funny would it have been if Biden picked this demon for his vp lol
If  really pardons Snowden, watch Biden and the rest of the Democrats bitterly oppose it. Susan Rice did it already.
I bet he still holds his rally on Thursday in PA ahead of Joe Biden’s acceptance.
Caribbean MASSIVE 📣  Do not forget the Biden Mighty Sorrel. After a few sips, you'll forget what media gaffe he's saying sorry for.
President Trump said Thursday that he was seeking a 15% rate, down from today’s 23.8%. Democratic rival Joe Biden would raise the top rate to 39.6% to match taxes on ordinary income.
I’m trying to remember when Biden personally attacked her family or when Harris called Biden trash and said he would wreck the party. Yeah coming up with nothing.
I talked to so someone on here most of the day back and forth, Dems vs Trumps. He seems smart and reasonable and he just told me I will be voting for Biden. 😂🤦‍♀️ Wish he could watch your postcast. 😏
And my worst fear is that even if Biden wins, everyone will be like “alright folks, back to your seats, nothing to see here!” Like they’ll pretend everything’s fine now and drop the push for progress, and then this shit will happen all over again later
me? buying Biden merch? Honey release a couple platinum-certified singles then we’ll talk!!
what a terrible 60 seconds of tv I just watched of you asking Softball questions to two blacks people who I guess get to speak for every black person. Pretty ignorant since Biden thinks people aren’t black if they don’t vote for him and Kamala locked up only blacks.
Our infrastructure is collapsing. The Biden administration might be the last chance to save America before it's too late. It's time to build, not to fuck around.
I actually agree w/ this. A Biden admin will likely acquiesce to the excesses of the left-identitarians and enshrine much of their demands in law, regulation, and practice. But a fact-based right-of-center mvt. able to fight this requires the total destruction of the present GOP.
They’re on a budget. Have you donated generously to Biden’s campaign?
I don't agree. Have faith in Biden. The debates are an important part of the process, and we need to uphold the process. We need to make an example of him. And don't forget, we get to see Kamala make mincemeat of Pence.
No we don’t have to. If he pardons Snowden, he gets my vote. Fvck Biden.
Joe Biden will not save the USPS.
Joe biden is against federally legalizing cannabis and #MedicareForAll due to 💰corruption within the  Old boomers are the worst.
Biden can't even take a single question if If ur an alley oop #whereisjoebiden
I think a naked erratic empire is better for the world than another missionary american value democrat. Plus both right &amp; left hate the neolib status quo, so even if Biden wins the conditions that got Trump elected aren't going away.
Biden's losing big. The riots
Biden/Harris will save USPS, FBI, CIA, DHS, and USA.

Are you making the argument that Joe Biden and Trump are equally fascist? Or do you want me real answer to a hypothetical situation where 2 fascists are having an election process to see who wins?   Because I'd be happy to address either scenario
This assumes Biden doesn’t win in an LBJ-style blowout, right?
I hear you, but you kinda sound like the trump supporters defending trump when he says something racist...”what Biden meant was”...we all know what he meant, but that’s not what he said.  Yang was the man cuz he told ppl to think harder and not vote based on ethic background
Pure garbage everyone handles things differently and you act like you know exactly how seeing him and then what he did after went. All these comments show that the country is lost if Biden wins. It will be the death of America

Grateful, grateful. “Running Against” emphasized ‘Don’t stop hitting.’ Is Biden’s timidity risky? Are we prey to delusion that Trump defeats himself?
Lol... That was quick. I guess there really aren't any questions Biden hasn't answered after all.
Biden has been doing plenty of talking. Go look at YouTube.
I'm pretty sure that's exactly what Joe Biden said the last time he did an interview
Well, that’s stupid. It’s a government agency. Biden can simply shut it down in exactly the same way Trump dismantled the predictive pandemic team and other safety measures Obama had in place.
I would guess 99% of the rioters are not voting or voting for Biden.
I don't agree with the all in person voting, but Trump has a serious history of political interference in many institutions. Biden doesn't. Trump admitted his intentions with USPS funding were to prevent mail in voting. We see his actions. Biden has done nothing of the sort.
Gonna vote for Biden. Socialism is awesome.  Snowden should be pardoned.  Fin.
Maybe Trump can call #Biden “Mo Joe” if he must give him a nickname.  “Mojo” means: a quality that attracts people to you &amp; makes you successful &amp; full of energy.  Joe can Ride a Bike. People Love and Admire him.  Trump can’t walk down a ramp. He is the most hated president ever!
Yet biden doesn't mention China... He does say 'trade', then he does the green new deal thing. Coal is cheaper. India needs nuclear
This is why I maintain that there's no real argument for any harm reduction in voting in a Biden admin.
Ugh, 4 years...that is a long time. I pray Biden wins or we are screwed.
All you idiots that vote for Biden forget about your 2nd amendment rights
Biden has an ad on Instagram about building the USA better and he's getting hammered in the comments 😂
Trump has been the most transparent President in history taking questions from all media outlets unlike brain dead Biden. As far as the pussy grabbing thing, you're just jealous it wasn't yours🤣😂🤣
Nah its biden telling people to vote for someone else , like in the primaries xD
And Trump and his followers literally think that Biden is a socialist in case you don’t realize just how insanely different their actual policies are
.....and there never will be a boat parade for Biden
I mean, also to rehabilitate Biden’s image for a potential 2016 run, so I guess it’s doing that work now. I just can’t tell if people are actually that gullible and really buy take manufactured political narratives at face value or if they’re just being disingenuous also
Are you serious? This video is authentic as are the 50 other clips I can show you where this poor old man doesnt know where the hell he is or what the hell he is doing there. Feel free to search YouTube for Biden making a fool of himself. There's dozens upon dozens of vids.
Stop the act. If biden was really racist you would love it and support him fully
Joe Biden And Harris Continue To Refuse To Take Questions From The Press.   Why Are They So Afraid Form Questions?
It is great in concept but it is naive to think a majority would ever vote third party. Biden would not hurt as many individuals as Trump, can we agree on that? He wouldn’t hurt the environment as badly, he wouldn’t embarrass America at a global level as much, right?

Ok, and for FIFTY of those years Biden has been in office. What does that say abt him? Trump had NOTHING to do with previous political corruption. He's ONLY been in politics since 2016! POLITICIANS, and globalists hate him. They've passed their hate to the useful idiots.
I’ll never forget those “I wish I had the petty energy of Joe Biden” memes you goofs were posting a few years back...
Take some advice. You are a travel agent, you are not a politician.  Stick with travel. You only see what Fox News shows. Biden may not be eloquent, but he has done great things for this country.  Has he made mistakes? Who hasn’t.  When you are perfect then you can judge. ❤️
Biden wants the tax cuts to billionaires repealed, to spend on infrastructure, pro green technologies and energy spending. He’ll actually lead on the Coronavirus issue. Do you get everything you want? No, of course not. The people promising you everything are unbelievable.

Hows pushing Biden left going?
Yes but to fix your analogy, you are changing a burning, worn down, and slashed tire, for a flat tire. You can not argue that Biden is as abhorrently bad as Trump, or else you’ve been blind to trumps history and the last 4 years.

I’m not here to say I SUPPORT biden but as a black man I feel safer in America where the leader isn’t overtly calling for white supremacy. The point is that you have to live in America so we have to choose the leader that won’t harm the most people

so biden wins &amp; the election is disputed by trump. still a couple months in there for biden to die or become totally incapable of being president. what then? kamala harris, who nobody voted for as president, mounts a legal challenge to stop trump remaining in office? good luck.
Give me a fucking break. Why don’t you focus on some of the real issues out there &amp; not this garbage. Just admit it that you will all lose in November. If Biden is so far ahead in the polls WTF are you worrying about? He supposedly has a 20 point lead. 🤔🤔🤔

#Gutfeld  It’s still unbelievable that the Dems picked Biden and Harris. Two of the candidates that drew very little enthusiasm.
I literally feel the same as I did four years ago.   Never felt like Hillary could beat Trump. I just never did. I never thought she had a shot.  I feel worse about Biden.  There's just no way. Push back against anyone who talks as if Biden will be the pres.  He  just won't be
Then Biden should announce his cabinet at same time as GOP convention
Biden is not racism he work with OBAMA very well no problem at all bump this remark from trump ok👋👋👋
This statement is a gift to the Biden campaign.

So they know Biden / Harris will lose —- the post office scam is the new set up excuse for loss. They were already blaming Trump about Post Office when Covid hit. I remember the news conference

Ha! Biden looks quite youthful doesn't he?  I think Trump is just old and in poor shape. I see 70 yr olds moving that way, especially when they're overweight.  What he has wrong with him has more to do with who he is as a person than how he moves down a ramp. #VoteHimOut

Electing Biden/Harris will not be a repudiation of white supremacy. It will be a small, necessary step away from white supremacy.
If you are impressed by President Obama's record,why not 4 years of Biden/Harris?
A landslide victory for Biden will take the wind out of trump saying fake election. Then my guess is he will make a deal to resign if pardoned by Pence. Also, make a deal with NY for no jail time.
I'm more worried about the Dems who stole the last two primaries stealing the GE for Biden and his war criminal supporters like Bolton and Bush and Ann Coulter and Romney all of whom are backing Joe which should terrify progressives.
Regardless, they won’t win and as it stands those lost votes for Biden only support Trump. It’s so far from an ideal situation but it’s naive to believe that a third party would win this year so let’s vote for the better option of two evils

These numbers differ from a WaPo/ABC poll taken in early july that found “ (51 percent) of Democrats say they prefer to vote by mail this fall, but 54 percent of independents and 79 percent of Republicans say they prefer to vote in person.”
I saw 2 Biden flags in CT. That’s literally all the Biden flags I saw all year.
The data in the census is used to draw electoral districts for the next 10 years. Businesses use it to make decisions about where to focus resources. Governments use it to decide where to build roads, schools. This will shape America long after Trump or Biden are out of office

We’ve also seen Joe Biden’s tax returns,.. if there was anything fishy I think someone would’ve pointed it out by now. Unlike your boss, who is a Iiar and a cheat, as well as a money laundering pig. But keep doing you.
Dementia trump won't have a chance against Biden!
They don’t care about losing as long as they’re the lesser of two evils &amp; they can claim moral superiority. We have to think in terms of who would we rather battle in 4 years. A stopgap like Biden or MAGA at full strength after four more years of further dismantling democracy.
Biden Republicans? Next ⁦ will tell us about the time he saw Bigfoot!
And i’ll be honest, I would’ve voted Biden regardless because Trump is one of if not the most corrupt president the country has seen. But actually knowing that Biden wants to enact a lot of good policies makes me a lot happier with my vote.
You are getting this information from a member of the former Russian backed corrupt members. So,.. like you, he has an interest in seeing Biden getting hurt. You are about as transparent as sarannwrap.
All Biden needs to do is run ads with a montage of the 292640 photos of the hideous Trump sons gummily smiling over the elephants and cheetahs they just shot.
Biden could have picked Sarah Palin and it would be lauded as a great pick. Having said that I’m happy he went with Kamala Harris over Susan Rice. Although, I’m sure she’ll still play a major role.
Biden staffers didn’t have to rush the press out of the room. Joe Biden can answer any questions! This wasn’t a Q&amp;A! Look how #SleazyDonald handles the press.  “Wah! Fake news! VEWY UNFAIOO!” -#CrybabyTrump
This is a frightening period in our history and it gets worse every day. There is only one way to fix it. In November we must - End TRUMP – End PENCE -  End the GOP – End BARR – End McConnell – End- POMPEO - End the CHAOS - END THE NIGHTMARE.    Vote  Biden/Harris   ✌️😷✌️
Biden can’t form a coherent sentence and she acts like when the Joker saw his face for the first time. What a pair.
I refuse to read anything cribs billl racist pig Biden puts out there. Hey to each there own. U want to support him, good luck. I will never do that.
Mr. Boyle, the Philadelphia congressman said it’s no accident that mail service has become so abysmal in the key Democratic population center in Pennsylvania.  “There is no plausible way for Donald Trump or Joe Biden to get to 270 electoral votes without Pennsylvania,” he said.
There’s no schtick. I’ve actually read up on Biden’s proposed policies and a lot of them are very good and they’re a hell of a lot more progressive than anything Trump would do with a 2nd term. You can read up on them here :
Yes, it's a fact that countries that did what Biden proposed in January have defeated Covid. We know what works, but Trump and the Republicans still refuse to act.
Not to mention that the Biden/Harris "Green New Deal" will be nothing but, a couple Trillion dollars created and given to their cronies in Corp America. The imbalances of wealth and ownership will only increase.
True, but Biden wants taxpayers to pay for it. That goes against Psalm 94 specifically, thus putting the blood of innocents on all of us. As a Christian, I cannot support that. I probably won't vote, as much as it galls me.

How Joe Biden Chose Kamala Harris as VP - The New York Times
Cuz ur whole shtick is how Biden is 10% better Trump and so we should accept what they did during the primaries... I will never accept that. Downballots only! My money and energy goes to primary the old crooks. Period.Me neither. I don't think Trump is satisfactory, but if some1 put a gun to my head forcing me to choose bet trump &amp; biden, i'd vote for trump to vote against biden. I don't know why they assume greens would consider voting 4 biden w/o da g party. Some might, others wouldnt
Stop equating conservative and racist, this narrative is ridiculous. Trump won an award from the NAACP because he pioneered racial parity in the golfing community. Trump sued the government to make it happen lmao. Meanwhile Biden was riding shotgun with a KKK grand dragon.

We must save our Democracy!  It is being threatened and our vote is essential to preserve our great country, the U.S.A. and everything it stands for.  Vote Biden/Harris on November 3rd.
I remember she made him cry! She is fierce. I can't wait to vote for Biden/Harris.
? Not sure k agree or disagree but can if biden wins you can cover the higher taxes
btw, I'm voting for Biden because Trump is a neofascist and is actively trying to remove the tools of democracy. To me, he is a stop-gap president that we will challenge and challenge hard in four years. I wish everyone voted for Biden but they have a right to their vote.
Settle 😂😂😂 Biden can have rape allegations that’s cool but not trump?
But Biden doesn’t have a rape allegation?

I will be happy to see your taxes rise if Biden wins.
The whole point of the argument "black people voted for Biden" argument is to literally tokenize black people and monothing the group. I'm telling you that you can disable the argument by exactly suggesting that black people, based on age and voting patterns, are not monolithic.
Trump is going to destroy Biden/Harris. He really knows how to speak to the people. Even dumbbells should be able to understand this. Then again, there's the MSM aka. DNC operatives.
Doesn't change my point. Biden is a sexual qssaulter, hair sniffer, nonconsual kisser and toucher. He IS the Patriarchy.
Very True. That includes authors of the op-ed “endorsing” Elizabeth Warren to be Biden’s VP. I wonder how did that work out? Obviously, it didn’t. Not at all.
Klobuchar polling at 5% &amp; Buttigieg polling above that, that alone provides the 10% margin which Biden used to win in numerous states during Super Tuesday. Add on to the fact that Warren remained in the race pulling votes from Sanders. The strategy against Sanders was clear.
Compassion? Lol. Joe Biden literally said "Lock the SOBs up" while arguing for the crime bill.
Post it directly to Biden and thank you for bringing a voice to this murderous practice.
Biden has zero political argument if Trump took a time to resonate with people  on this issue.He knows he can't go with depth in this issue,so why not navigate as his opponents are doing? They know he can't hit em  back on this given his position,yet Trump can elaborate on masks
If Rubio and Kasich had done for Cruz in 2016 what Buttigieg and Klobuchar did for Biden in 2020, we wouldn’t have Trump.
Yes. Joe Biden has been accused of inappropriately touching 8 women and sexual assaulting one of them. Patriarchy is running a predator as our nominee.
No trustworthyness of Biden/Trump, how do you think your neighbors will vote, presidential approval rating and approval ratings of all members of the tickets in the fall
Cheetoh can pardon #DeJoy of crimes before  DOJ files charges?
I definitely agree on the first count, and this may be naive of me but I don't think at this moment people will check out even if Biden is in--things are too bad. I also don't believe the Democratic Party would learn a lesson if he lost, they will never learn and they don't care
I remember .... and I remember Demsr and Repubs uniting with Ukr's worst neonazis to start the coup that killed over 50,000 innocent human beings and pple profited from that including Biden's son
#almost_1K       I'll follow back...I'm like Biden, I can sniff 1,000
Last week Biden posted a lie about Trump (regarding “fine people”) but it is not flagged; neither was a tweet by Iran’s leader threatening the use force on the US. But Twitter did flag Trump tweets about issues with mail-in ballots and that he will use force against rioters.
Oh, I encourage it. If you think that Biden can beat him, you’re smoking crack.

I do agree that Trump is very bad. But the conditions that made Trump possible preceded Trump, and will continue to get worse under Biden.  I'm of the mind to deal with the emergency at hand but I will not be surprised if 2024 brings someone worse than Trump.
Biden gives me the creeps just as much as Trump. I don’t want him to be president either.  I’m not for the lesser of two evils. That’s just as bad.  For everyone (Geared towards trump supporters) calling Biden a pedophile... do you all just ignore the fact that Trump was on trial
Haha. Can’t make this stuff up. So the people that are supposed to deliver  the ballots, support Biden? Unbelievable
Um, hearing Joe Biden say the words "I badly need you", is just, well, a little unsettling....
i can see your point but idk if I agree. I've thought a lot about it and I think it isn't an Obama situation where people will go back to sleep.  A lot has happened in the past 5 years. In some ways I think it could be easier to mobilize the left under Biden.

Remember kiddos, Billy Eyelash singing at the DNC doesn’t make Joe Biden less of a rapist.
By not voting Biden you’re ok with four more years of this criminal who has FLAGRANTLY used our tax dollars to enrich himself, his family and his business?  Please!
This is evident by the fact that despite all major moderates withdrawing, states such as Colorado, Minnesota, Massachussets, Texas and Maine saw Biden only beat Sanders by less than a 10% margin. That is DESPITE the entire moderate and centrist vote going to Biden.
The Democratic Party had to coalesce around Biden before Super Tuesday or else the moderate vote would have been split to such a degree that Sanders would have received wins in numerous states.

Is there a dumber right-wing-troll take out there than wild-eyed Marxist radicals... centrist Joe Biden and former federal prosecutor Kamala Harris? I mean, why not call them poopyheads, it has just as much substance.
Actually POTUS lost a billion from 3.1 to 2.1 net worth from 2019 to 2020 and went from 275 to 1011 in the USA per Forbes.  However. Your point is well taken.  His 400k salary goes to other agencies.  Never mind Maxine, Schumer, Biden and Feinstein. Career pols grifting.
Oh, I know that, and it was an answer regarding supporting Biden over Trump. In no way, shape or form is Bowman politically aligned with Biden and if you did even a tiny bit of research you'd know that too.
Did Trump release his taxes? Cuz Biden did.

You really think there are people on the fence? You really think someone who is leaning for Trump is going to switch and vote Biden?  REALLY???
Denying ventilators to states bc of personal beefs. Throwing away Covid tests bc people dying in blue states is politically advantageous to him.  An end to all asylum and the Remain in Mexico policy.  I'll never defend Biden but I think there are ways Trump is uniquely sadistic.
And Joe started about 3 feet from home and needed jim clyburn, obama, and tom perez to intervene + MSNBC and CNN structuring coverage to advantage #StatusQuoJoe  Biden: greater name recognition, has been running for president since the 80’s, also an old white man and christian…

They didn’t endose Biden the child raper and racist so we all good with voting for Trump
Biden is taking away the postal service?
Are these the same polls that said he had no path to victory? I don't give them allot of credibility anymore. You roll your sleeves up, put your head down and do the work in front of you to make Biden the next POTUS on 11/4/2020. That's how you win not polls.
Because Bowman wants universal healthcare. He ran on that. And you want to lie to yourself and say Bowman aligns with Biden just because he supports Biden over Trump, that doesn't mean they are politically aligned. Which is obvious if you did a bit of critical thinking.
Yes x 100%.  I think they are also sick of him and hoping for Biden to win and take over. If he wasn't so evil somebody might've stepped up and said something.  I imagine they're just like 🤷.

Right now, Joe Biden’s strategy of keeping the focus on President Trump and pitching a broad tent is working well,  writes.
Biden was at the top of the polls literally the entire way from the moment he announced. Not by a lot but it was a highly fragmented field. Bernie technically didn’t even beat Pete in Iowa. Except for Nevada he underperformed across the board. Can we stop this already?
I hope Plouffe is advising Biden. There is no better strategist.
You think Biden is really making it till November?? 😂😂😂😂😂 you are watching a movie! Enjoy 🍿
Would not even do a debate if I would be Biden. Why lower yourself to attend a circus? A debate with a chronic liar is no debate at all. Same for Kamala.

Why do you hate cops so much? Why are Democrats so violent these days? Why can’t they actually discuss issues instead of burning things. Is that what you want for the whole country if Biden wins?
which the govt prevented by planning to charge him under the irrelevant Espionage Act, which unjustifiably prohibits that defense. If Rice is demonizing Snowden, I'm extremely glad she wasn't chosen by Biden!
Biden hasn't done that, though.
So if other candidates dropped out and their supporters moved to Biden and not Bernie — what does that tell you?

Biden or Obama wouldn’t have pulled all the other crap you have pulled. We are not going to be distracted by your shiny, meaningless accord.
No, the bit where the entire Democratic Party had to tell candidates to drop out of the race to support Biden so that together they could stop Sanders. The strategy was clear as day for anyone willing to look at it objectively.

He recently said he was considering meeting with Maduro and that he was considering withdrawing support for Guiado .. he was instantly attacked publicly by Biden and the rest of the neolibs .. he may back down in the face of the fierce reaction. We should support him on this imo

#michealOsterholm thank you for your words of wisdom regarding the surge in the Covid 19 cases.. we Patriots are not afraid... we're more afraid of biden getting elected then we are of covid-19..(he won't.)
Really? You sure about that? Ask Kamala if she still believes tara reads, the woman Joe Biden sexually assaulted.
I love how people are making a big deal out of Biden’s middle school grades AS IF that’s an efficient marker of his intelligence and somehow predicts his current cognitive functioning.    That wouldn’t stand in a court of law.  #neuropsychologist

Banned flights from China as Pelosi and Biden called him racist...Biden is not president yet, but when he is, he will answer truthfully &amp; respectfully, unlike the rude behavior displayed by #TrumpFailedAmerica toward reporters, especially female and worse if minority.For now, he will wait for the agreed upon debates set by the debate commission
Lol... That was quick. I guess there really aren't any questions Biden hasn't answered after all.
Nah its biden telling people to vote for someone else , like in the primaries xD

Here’s another great Dementia Donnie supporter #Biden/Harris2020
Not exactly the same. Trump is the President who needs to answer questions pertaining to what is going on now, and what the administration response is. Biden should do interviews, but he is not currently in power. With power comes responsibility to answer to the people.
“My reporters?” Are you kidding? They don’t work FOR you, they work to report ABOUT you. The fact that you lie ALL THE TIME and are actively trying to suppress the vote means they will hold you accountable. Biden doesn’t lie.
Biden is out of his mind.
Does Biden support sending kids back? I mean last time I checked he didn’t and said it wasn’t safe, but I could be wrong. Trump wants everything and all things open along with the idiot DeVos.
Biden is an embarrassment to himself and the country.  It’s pretty sad.  He seems to have no idea how inept he is. He has been holding this idea for years.  Dementia!
Biden is incapable of answering questions! He would have to wear ear phones to get answers from someone on the other end of the phone. He embarrasses himself ever time he speaks. Sad.  DEMS are just using him. He needs assisted living

I hope you all understand, when I constantly tweet criticizing Joe Biden or other Democrats, it's not because I love Trump, or Republicans, I just think we can do so much better than Joe Biden, alleged rapist, and Top Cop Kamala as leaders of the party.

Rape is sexual abuse yes they're in the same category but there is a difference between forcing yourself on a child and having non consensual sex and the (still disgusting things) Biden did on TV.
Priceless. Biden will ask him the same question at the debates.
Rape has a set of rules that make it rape i am not defending biden I think everything he does on camera is absolutely wrong but it 100 percent is not rape and labeling that takes away from actual instances of rape from people in power.

60,000,000 people got it. Biden’s own chief of staff admitted their response was a total failure and they got lucky the death rate was so low.
I've actually heard from many Black people Biden could have picked a Black man to be VP. They refuse to vote for Biden because of who he picked.
Stop wondering. You can and should vote for  . Biden is a fake Christen. #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020And Biden is the answer? Spare me
Yes, I believe in Biden’s accusers 😡 Which is why I’m running as his VP😍
But Biden is winning
sorry, i came here to hear the NYT tell us more on why Democrats don't want Biden
Jill Biden “cares” is pushing a man sliding down the slope of dementia for a job he cannot handle. That’s some sort of caring!
A ham sandwich has the same cognitive recognition as Biden. Maybe slightly more.
I live in NJ and I have seen ONE Biden sign. I can’t say I’ve seen many Trump signs but def more than one!

Oh media, media... Can we stick to real issues. In this CNN report, the title makes it seem like Trump actually said something (which would be totally realistic), ...
Open your eyes Biden and Vp put more people in prison for small things like weed, Biden’s a racist and his vp called him one months ago and is now back tracking, and he can barely hold a sentence let alone be a president
If Biden- Harris win, they will reverse it and make Iran more powerful by renewing the nuclear deal. That’s a real threat to not only America but the world. They are a real threat and shouldn’t win.
You ran your state Cali straight into the ground, you ran your presidential bid straight into the ground, you ran Biden straight into the ground. We will not let you partner with Biden to run America straight into the ground. No thanks!
Voting for Biden will bring this... This judge wants to destroy an 8-year old boy whose crazy mother wants him to be a girl. And they order the father to pay for it!
My wife (moderate D), and in-laws (swing voters, definite Biden voters) love him. I just keep quiet. They're like "Why can't he run for president now? Is it too late?"
If Biden wins, China will enter the US market even more aggressively than before. It’s a real threat.
I’m voting for the non pedo #Kanye2020 ya’ll trending #SaveTheChildren but voting for Biden or Trump? Ya’ll weird
Lol no. I don't get it with Cuomo. He hasn't even done a good job! If Biden wins, Harris will be the frontrunner vs. probably a younger progressive like Katie Porter. I don't see AOC ever running for bigger office.
Joe Biden has no authority.
After 47 years in government how’s 78 yo Biden “all of a sudden “ going to fix everything. If he knew what the problem was why didn’t he do something before now???
As much as I hate settling for Biden, I can’t stand more Trump, and a vote for biden can potentially be the bridge to more progressive candidates if he fucks up
Because the DNC will only pander to people who they know will vote. If progressives in large don’t show up, the DNC will stop wasting money trying to get us to vote. We just need to put a lot of pressure on Biden
i never said not to vote biden harris, just that harris is a shitty choice
That will be the end of our country if Biden gets elected
You are bunch of liars and cheaters who have destroyed our country because of your lust for power! The Biden/Harris ticket will save our country!
This sounds great! Thanks for giving me more reasons to vote for Biden/Harris!
Guys please vote Biden. He wasn’t the best option but he’s way better than the orange man in the White House right now
Joe Biden has been in government for almost 50 years getting paid every day...can you name 5 major accomplishments he has had. I’ll even give you one...the disasterous 1994 Crime Bill...so seriously, try without Googling (it doesn’t help) Name 4 accomplishments...
I thought she was running for BO, what’s all this President talk...Ohhhhhhh so you all know that Biden is a prop, thanks for confirming!
She's a puppet. A place holder and so is Biden. The real candidates will be snuck in on y'all dems soon enough. But it don't matter.  when people start getting a few hundred extra dollars back into their checks each week thanks to Trump. who do you think they will vote 4?
This is true. She is a hypocrite and a fraud! Don't let her pander to you.... Your choice Trump 2020=no income taxes.. Biden 2020=increased income taxes and lost jobs... The choice seems obvious.
this guy has the nerve to give Biden the nickname “Sleepy”Seems like 5:30 pm has become the same awful tiresome bedtime story every day, it’s too early for bedtime  Zzzzzzzzzzzzz #GreenEggsandHamIsBetter

As a former Cville resident, the events of 3 yrs ago hit me to the core. This outward racism and bigotry can happen anywhere and is what, in part, drove me to run for public office.  Excited to be on the same local ticket with Biden/Harris this fall to reclaim the soul of America

Well if Biden by a miracle wins makes it through a first term, he won't be running in 2024, so who would be the leader of the Dem Party then?
I believe that why Biden picked her.
Trump has done more for the black community than any other president. Biden is an absolute bigot.
This is also America..for my many friends, near and far, here and overseas, the inclusive spirit of this American nation is alive and well.. BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
I am voting #GreenParty. Not a  member; fled 30 yrs ago. It does not represent me or my values. THERE IS NO CHANGE THERE; for me, status quo=death. So why would I vote for Biden/Harris unless I were suicidal??? NOT a protest—THIS is MY vote, MY choice!
It's also fundamentally different than the others. I think people have bracketology brain when they look at it. If the election was today it's probably 95% for Biden. He's just modeling three months out for various potential changes. I don't see that number as a negative.
I am enjoying the meltdown though. I mean, I get it. I will never truly take a deep breath until he is physically out of the building. But I think it's hilarious that we're panicking over a model that says Biden is winning 7/10 times.

Joe Biden didn't earn any on the fence voters with that pick. It's an uphill battle on the debate stage for both tbh
Seeing that Biden picked Kamala today literally gave me butterflies I’m so excited about the idea of a woman being in office
I don’t think it will be a Biden/Kamala switch. She isn’t personable at all.

While yes, Biden was far from the best choice, if he gets blown tf out and that doesn’t spark a revolution then the DNC will believe all the pandering he has done to progressives was a waste
I only believe in settle for biden because if we prove to be a group that doesn’t vote the DNC won’t care why and just pander to those who do vote, furthering the country more right
Don't they mean from the list of black females? Biden severely limited his options when he committed to having a black female. Is there someone from that limited group who would better help the ticket?
Biden boxed himself in when he declared he would limit his choice to black females. My comments are relevant only within that limited framework. BTW in business that sort of comment about race / ethnicity would get you sued.
Very excited to see my feed filled with shade against Harris and Biden, stay tuned for all my retweets
If I were Joe Biden, I wouldn't stress a whole lot about a child rape enabler accusing me of being insufficiently deferential to the dogma of his child rape enabling club. But that's just me.
Okay i was just asking. Personally I think Kamla Harris should have been the Democratic nomination and i mean that sincerely. I fully understand ut hated for Trump just dont think Biden is mentally capable. Harris is a great choice she was a good DA and was not soft on crime
So you were not going go vote Biden otherwise? What does that say about Biden? Because that's kind of what ur saying
Yes there are. Do not forget the Indians, we can get Biden over the finish line.
I don’t care about Donald Trump but imagine voting for Joe Biden
Oh Susan, you must be hard of hearing?  once again shows his true colors on the video! You are the one in denial!  By the way, President Trump has just been guaranteed 4 more years in office with Biden's pick for Vice President!  Fake, toke smoking Kamala!
It will get higher after Biden just picked Kamala Harris as his vice president!
We should feel as ambivalent about her as Biden. Not that we have any other choice.

Interesting about Harris is most of her criticism comes from the left. The right loses the anti-law enforcement angle with a Biden-Harris ticket. Her selection will be more about engaging with the left instead of fighting the right. Are they gonna bring up her pro-police record?
BIDEN/HARRIS 2020 LET'S GO MOTHERFUCKERS
Yeah, the RCP average and 538 average have moved slightly closer because of a lot of lower-quality polls. The good pollsters continuously show a big Biden lead. You could tell Cohn was hoping for like a Biden +6 from Monmouth today and he got another double-digit margin.

For the love of the god Joe Biden is going to destroy, please shut him down for the year. He's too valuable over the next six years. Stop pretending this season matters! #Nats
I think that’s fear mongering to some degree. Even if Biden just lasts 2 years, I think people are more excited to get rid of a senile, corrupt Donny than a far left Dem party taking over. If that happens they will be punished in 2022 and 2024. We will see
Also I agree Biden himself won’t move the Dems any further left. But their voters and party members will require that. It’s arguably necessary after the last 4 horrible years. But they’ll have hell to pay if they go to far left &amp; will lose in the 2022 midterms or 2024 general
Blaming the suburbs for Trump is just weird? They’ve always been GOP leaning. 2nd Biden is beating him in the suburbs based on polls for 2020 so if Biden wins that’ll be part of the reason. Also both parties have shifted far from the center due to polarization. They both suck.
I have seen one Biden sign in someone’s yard. One.
for a different party back then- low taxes/more libertarian/genuinely cared to be decent and polite. Trumps generally awful behavior is why the suburbs hate him so much.   Dems have a unique challenge keeping those voters into the 2020s if Biden wins- esp with the leftward lurch

Joe Biden is hiding in such a huge basement that it has trees and enough room to ride a bike.

I find the Biden/Harris ticket insulting as a woman. The VP was chosen based on color and gender period! I would love for someone to tell me why they’re voting for these two clowns!
I'm not sure. She really does hit every point Biden needs - adds diversity to the ticket, adds relative youth, is a credible President, has an impressive resume.   I think she would have been in the thick either way, but the public knows her now and she's been fully vetted.
Biden’s climate platform doesnt mention fossi fuels once. If you cared about the environment the most youd vote green
So Ignore The Fact that Biden is a Racist, believes Marriage is only between a man and a woman, and he admitted to quid pro crow, which means he will be impeached???  No Thank You, Give The Nomination to Tulsi.
My mother, who voted for Trump, says she's voting Biden because she really loves Kamala Harris. Says she's very sharp, and was a prosecutor. So much for voting only the top of the ticket.
Racism does still exist, but the majority on the right call it out when it happens. We don't support it in any way.   But Biden? Racist. Harris called him out on it too. And now? She's a hypocrite.   All the Racism from Biden now just disappears and Harris is now ok with Biden..
Of course Biden couldn't do it. Because Biden recognizes the UAE as a nation of slaveholders and supporters of terrorism.  Now, Russia, Saudi Arabia, China and North Korea have to split the pie of owning you one more way. And they're not going to like it.
Of course I'm serious. Biden has an 8-year record as the #2 man in a very successful Presidency. Trump has a 3 1/2-year record as the most spectacularly failed President ever.  He's Pierce, Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Harding, Hoover, Nixon and Dubya all rolled into one.
Of course Biden can do the job. Why wouldn't he?  We know Trump can't do the job.

Pick your poison this election but this pandemic is the best thing to happen to Biden. You all need to hear him talk unfiltered and field questions before giving him your vote.

Why would she be correct now.  beat her just like he will destroy  and if he doesn’t Biden will destroy America and not even realize he is doing it because he is nothing but a puppet. The debates will reveal how truly clueless Biden is.
That’s fine because thousands of people just decided to vote for Trump when  decided to blame  for the economy and unemployment numbers. Why are Biden/Harris afraid to answer questions? How will raising taxes improve the economy??

The media is definitely showing their blatant bias. They fear a Biden win will tank their ratings. Guess what? Good. They can do their actual job instead
Biden will not change anything
and  are now blaming the economy and unemployment numbers on   ARE THEY SERIOUS?? #Trump shut the country down and that’s what destroyed the economy. What would Biden have done differently??
said that 50k lives would have been saved if  acted 2 weeks sooner...then when?? If he did what?? Biden called #Trump xenophobic and racist for shutting down travel when he did. So what would Biden and Harris have done. EXPLAIN what Trump did wrong.
Under Biden &amp; YOU they have to LIVE long enough to get it!! You guys have chaos &amp; DEATH 💀 running WILD!!
This is why voting out Trump isn’t enough. We also have to pressure Biden/Harris, the House and Senate Dems to push for dismantling the systemic racism.
No, Biden selected Kamala Harris to be his running mate, and together, they will leave Donald Trump's future as flat as a pancake.
Most important thing to me is Biden over 50%. Clinton never had polling over 50%. She may have been ahead, but there was a huge undecided margin plus Gary Johnson.
But Biden can win one electoral vote in Nebraska.  Trump cannot win any NY EC votes
He also reversed Biden’s crime bill that put more black people in jail for misdemeanors. And pardoned wrongfully convicted people. Which were from the black community. And under Trump the Black businesses start ups has increased 400%!
Speaking of peculiar arguments, this one would certainly qualify: "Your guy is more senile than my guy." Biden's mental decline is undeniable. You may have decided that it doesn't matter &amp; you're going to vote for him anyway, but denying reality makes you look pretty foolish.

I'm not even a huge fan of Biden/Harris, but damn, that entrance though 😮
Biden/Harris is "Hope reborn." Now, we all need to go make history!
I’ve noticed ever since Biden announced Harris, there’ve been videos of her dancing
Just like Obama and Biden did
Biden is taller than me at 5’11 while Pence is 5’8, which is around my height

Republicans: Biden is in cognitive decline!  Also Republicans: I have some thoughts on Pamela Harris.
We/US don't need stupid senators or representatives to bring crimially guilty parties to justice. That is what the DOJ, FBI and police/DA departments are for.  If gop are guilty, let their heads roll with the prior obama, biden and clinton administration people...
I like how Biden’s pick for VP is so important to people, Joe Biden said it’s easy being Vice President b/c you don’t have to do anything and agrees it’s like being the grandparent instead of the parent
Not really, Biden knows what year it is.
You can find the statements by all Democrats including Biden, Bernie, Kamla and all in public where they are slamming India and supporting Pakistan.  If you were paid by Democrats for this article, then it is a professional duty you did... But Democrats are Anti-India.
Trump is an idiot, but Joe Biden will be a total puppet. He has a political track record of NOTHING.
My fiancee's grandfather voted Republican from 1968 to 2012 and for McMullin in 2016. He's all in on Biden/Harris this time.
New story on NPR: Biden And Harris To Introduce Their Presidential Ticket In Delaware
How many steps are in between joe biden and a walk on water candidate?
I'm sure the billionaire that openly bragged about groping women is the one they'll feel safe with.   That's not to say Biden gets a pass but it's just another reason why it should've been Bernie running.   Also the dog whistling has turned into a nuclear alert siren.
Joe Biden did not write that tweet. Poor Joe doesn’t even know he’s alive.
Yes it is!!! Who knew Biden would launch #OGwisdom? Watch out!!! His Administration will roar!
Dumbass people only think theres 2 options in an election. Honestly Biden is worse than Trump but it’s trendy to hate Trump
I need answers !! Biden is NOT it
Maya Rudolph and Jason Sudeikis are gonna have field days on SNL if Biden/Harris wins
I do fear that a Tea Party type of faction might form if Biden isn’t good enough
The third part is the most important. So many lapsed into inactivity from 2009-2011 and 2013-2015. Hold Biden/Harris accountable without being disrespectful. Let the GOP be the racist assholes
I wish Bob Barker was alive to play Joe Biden on SNL...
No. Biden/Harris being incredibly shitty candidates that will not change anything is what will help trump win
It’s a good day to block Biden/Harris apologists
Eyeeee really don’t wanna hear that pile of flaming garbage excuse that we shouldn’t be highly critical of Biden/Harris because we can’t “afford” to......girl listen to yourself before you speak on shit that doesn’t concern you
Of course I was never going to vote for Biden. It’s Medicare for All or no vote!
U.S. Coronavirus deaths: 167,789  How many of those would have lived if Trump hadn't decided to govern by spite and, among other things, throw away the Obama-Biden pandemic playbook?
Neither Blacks nor Indians are going to vote for Biden with such antics.
Sorry, don’t want a Biden administration. Medicare for All or no vote!
Bring 'em on. Biden picked somebody even tougher than he is. She can take 'em, and she can dish 'em right back out.  As Toby Ziegler would say, "Ginger, get the popcorn!"
That shot of Biden riding a bicycle, was THAT in a basement, stupid?
6 terms in the Senate and 2 as Vice President vs. Going bankrupt running casinos. Biden isn't the one who failed in his chosen profession.
This was posted well before Biden announced his pick. I am not disappointed at all.
Most important thing is getting Trump out. I’ll deal with Biden and Harris once they’re in office
To all Dems complaining about the Kamala pick. First, I disagree and I’m happy with it. But also WHO CARES? I’d vote for Biden-Fork 2020, Biden-Owl 2020, Biden-Chair 2020. Esp. if you have a big platform, your tweets could discourage someone from voting. THIS IS NOT THE YEAR.
Putin isn't done. Putin needs another 4 years to totally dismantle our government. It's Biden vs. Putin.
I don’t have the answers on how to win the votes of black people in America and neither does Trump or Biden.  #wheremyindendentsat #GreenParty2020?
Alright I'm calling it now for Biden. A Dem who gets 58% (!!!) of the 65+ age group wins in a landslide
You can't be this Stupid, Right??? Mail Trucks are Being Replaced with Brand New Ones Thanks To Trump, after Biden gave them No Money for his 8 years as VP.
Biden won’t have a cabinet overtly trying to dismantle the post office, dept of education, environmental regulations.  But will continue to serve Wall Street, health insurance industry, the fossil fuel industry etc
You Just Described Joe Biden, not Donald Trump.
In picking Harris, Biden makes history and plays it safe...strike that....plays it smart and boldly so.
Agreed, but if Trump and Biden were to ever get on stage together that’s basically murder. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 #Trump2020
If the commie hill is the one conservatives want to die on with Biden/Kamala then go right ahead.
THIS DECISION AINT EASY MY NIGGA!!!!! ITS EITHER BIDEN AND KAMALA OR TRUMP AND PENCE WE FUCKED EITHER WAYBiden is not president yet, but when he is, he will answer truthfully &amp; respectfully, unlike the rude behavior displayed by #TrumpFailedAmerica toward reporters, especially female and worse if minority.For now, he will wait for the agreed upon debates set by the debate commission
Lol... That was quick. I guess there really aren't any questions Biden hasn't answered after all.
Here's another source that again questions the claim...
It's been fact checked several times...
Biden is not racism he work with OBAMA very well no problem at all bump this remark from trump ok👋👋👋
Uhhh he’s objectively bad for DACA and other undocumented people seeking legalization. Not that Biden is much better, but, life would be a lot easier under Biden
What did Obama and Biden do for the African Americans in the 8 years in power? Nothing! Remember that when you vote.

This is the same senile fool who weeks ago said "Trump has given up as president because of covid-19".  So what does Joe Biden do? He picks the one candidate whot:     * Got ZERO delegates  * Was the first candidate to quit after universally rejected by democrats.
* : "Since we have 'no doubt' Joe Biden was leading in the polls,**  scotus should rule in favor of Biden /Harris, or lose ALL credibility &amp; be responsible for more riots &amp; bloodshed!"   ** MSM is exaggerating Joe Biden's lead, if he even has one, to justify removing 45!
*I have no doubt  &amp;  in conjunction with the mainstream media , esp.  are going to use Coronavirus to perform a #CoupDetat on November 3rd.  *MSM : "We won't know the winner for weeks,but polls had Biden ahead". *CNN "Trump did this 2 stay in office!
A profile of Joe Biden's running mate Kamala Harris.
Will you and W endorse Joe Biden?  Please bring Jimmy on too.  I’m begging
Biden will incorporate the Antifa and BLM and black panthers into the department of justice
The whole "we get him out with a Biden landslide" trope is bullshit, right? Does anyone know where that originated?
He would know an island from a peninsula . He moved his residency to Florida because  as soon as Biden says I do they're indicting him on some serious charges oh yes there going to be an arrest. The presidency saved him for now , because you can't indict a sitting president.
That's a negative  Biden has a proven 8 years in the White House record Kamala has a public background  prosecutorial background,. Trump and his so call pro are a bunch of money grubbing do nothing's. Trump has claimed bankruptcy 9 times every business hes started tanked
Ok. Yeah. Why not endorse Joe Biden? That might help. Or You Need To Calm Down
MAGA by electing Biden Harris!
Believe me, if anyone  got to interview Biden, the questions would be “How are you?” and “What’s your name?” with no follow up when he answers “Steve.”

Biden-Harris are focused on the pandemic as #TrumpMeltdown should. We cannot recover until that is addressed. Also, there is no V-shaped recovery. We are still solidly in pandemic mode.
Postal Workers Union endorses Joe Biden for President.
“Your” reporters behave *exactly* like that: they’re called Fox News and OANN.  *The people’s* reporters ask questions of every public official — as they do when attending a Biden press conference. (Which that wasn’t.)

Pence must refuse to debate until a Trump Biden debate occurs.
But I thought I saw a Reuters headline the other day saying that Biden chose a black women as his running mate, and I thought it was the same name. So, I'm thinking, let me go to Google images and put in her name. And yeah, she looks like a black person to me.
Joe Biden is just Obama bin Biden
Adam Silver would be a better president than trump and Biden smh sad af
Adding those voters to the groups who voted against Hillary, rather than for Trump + those Dems &amp; independents apalled by both Biden and Harris could mean Trump squeaks out a win.
Disgusting. Perspective | An enslaved person’s words provide painful context for mayor’s post about Biden picking ‘Aunt Jemima as his VP’
Whether or not we avoid it with Biden it is HERE with Trump.
The issue is fascism...and I’ll take a flawed candidate against a fascist. No one is insinuating Biden to be a freedom fighter. That’s silly.
And there’s your answer,  people so indoctrinated that they are willing to ignore 40+ years of evidence that Trump has followed in his racist father’s footsteps, and instead make accusations without any evidence concerning Biden’s mental state. It’s a cult.
It will be amazing to see you as a Vice President, and hopefully, once you and Biden fix this mess, it will be even better to see you as the first Woman President of the United States.
See how dirty politics is , Kamal used to disagree and argue with Biden now she’s kissing his ass👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
Driving from Maplewood to East Hanover we definitely crossed a line. West Orange was an interzone of Biden signs.
Bullshit Biden has 8 years of White House  experience.  Trumps been there almost4 and hasn't experienced anything but laughter boos and failures oh and the 20,000 lies
Ok dumb don, you are so sharp you are cutting down our people in every way possible, job losses, income inequality, COVID 19 mismanagement, 165,000 plus deaths, homelessness on the rise, economic volatility, and on and on. Biden may stutter but you lie!

“My reporters?” Are you kidding? They don’t work FOR you, they work to report ABOUT you. The fact that you lie ALL THE TIME and are actively trying to suppress the vote means they will hold you accountable. Biden doesn’t lie.
Biden is out of his mind.
Biden doesn’t remember how to drive
Does Biden support sending kids back? I mean last time I checked he didn’t and said it wasn’t safe, but I could be wrong. Trump wants everything and all things open along with the idiot DeVos.
Joe Biden’s family owned slaves!
Joe Biden is a racist!
Biden is an embarrassment to himself and the country.  It’s pretty sad.  He seems to have no idea how inept he is. He has been holding this idea for years.  Dementia!
Biden is incapable of answering questions! He would have to wear ear phones to get answers from someone on the other end of the phone. He embarrasses himself ever time he speaks. Sad.  DEMS are just using him. He needs assisted living

We are with Biden and Kamala . At least we have an ideal of their politics and what they are capable of, Trump had no political experience. Just maybe this experience coming into the White House  can turn this mess around. Cause this covid19 is on a killing spree.
Interesting. People are really upset with Angela Davis for supporting Kamala Harris. Yes Kamala’s done some fucked up, inexcusable things in her career. But if y’all are not voting Biden/Harris I genuinely wanna know what’s the alternative?

It is crystal clear what their intentions are. Biden is a weak AF candidate with dementia. It’s common sense. I also really trust 3rd party ballot harvesters.....NOT!
If there is mandatory mail in ballots it will be the most fucked up fraudulent election in history. Ballots will be tossed, forged and 3rd party operatives will pick them up. Unofficial ballots won’t be counted for half a year. They know Biden is weak AF and has dementia

I think he should interview Biden/Harris and Trump/Pence

Purely wishful thinking. I don’t see a lot of enthusiasm for Biden but my contact with the rest of the world has been limited lately.
If you live in a state that isn’t likely to be an easy Biden win, you should consider voting in person, early if possible, if you feel you can do so safely. If you need to vote by mail, apply ASAP, and return your ballot in person if you can, mail it ASAP if you must mail it.
Biden we I’ll get 90% of the Black vote, as would anyone else running against that proven racist.
Probably promised a cabinet appointment if she attacks and Biden/Harris elected.
My democratic black family are not happy about Joe Biden &amp; Harris, the only ones I see celebrating are white liberals.  The same ones who were screaming BLM a few weeks back.  These people don't care about black lives.  I love seeing others see things for what they are.
So your argument is "He is the President of the United States - why would we expect him to know about the 14th Amendment or even his own administration's legal position on this issue?" Biden or Harris could answer the question. Or Rubio or Haley - both children of non-citizens.
That Biden was VP in an administration that presided over a recovery from the brink of an almost depression would make this a hard sell to anyone except Trump's lowly educated fans.

Thanks for the reply. I should probably disclose I'm kind of subtweeting a group of people, and not you. I'm so irritated w/ those who keep insisting Biden will prosecute Trump when he literally keeps telling us he won't. Fantasy and projection are not helpful in any way.
Ukraine was manufactured and it failed. In fact it suggests Biden’s family used Air Force 2 to conduct personal business with China/Ukraine. Russia highlighted Clinton’s paid for fake intel anti get warrant from Obama’s justice dept to spy on trump team. Smart people realize this
China wants Joe Biden in the White House so they can return to ripping off our country.  We can’t let that happen.

This is my dream team, Biden/Harris 2020!  For the first time in the last 31/2 years + more, you heard from two politicians who spoke from the heart &amp; gave me hope to fight for our democracy in November 3, 2020.…
Your NASTY you DONT DESERVE TO BE CALLED PRE... NOPE CANT DO IT #45 it is YOU DID NOT MAKE AMERICA GREAT YOU RAN the USA to the ground YOUR PATHETIC...BYE President Dump  November 3rd President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris
What are we going to do if this is an effective tactic? Say if Trump wins a narrow advantage in the Electoral College. Is he our president? How about if Biden wins very narrowly and Trump refuses to leave office? Prepare for the worst because this is not going to end well.
Omg. He has full blown dementia. Was that before or after the disastrous Iran deal. He’s right. The normal countries in the area were so terrified after Biden’s Iran deal, they sought peace with trump.

I dont have an agenda I just think there is a difference between rape and what biden did which is still disgusting they have very distinct definitions and misusing it weakens how bad each actually is.
The head of your party, Trojan Joe Biden, publicly declared blacks are incapable of thinking for themselves which makes them slightly worse than latinos. Looks like the Democrats are going to have to own that, don’t it?
Rape is sexual abuse yes they're in the same category but there is a difference between forcing yourself on a child and having non consensual sex and the (still disgusting things) Biden did on TV.
Question I haven’t been following too closely so maybe you already answered this but do you still think Biden is a sexual abuser? Do you still think he is a racist?  Why did you withhold information that would have freed and innocent person. FINALLY WHAT ARE YOUR PRONOUNS
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked %27Aunt Jemima as his VP%27  via
Rape has a set of rules that make it rape i am not defending biden I think everything he does on camera is absolutely wrong but it 100 percent is not rape and labeling that takes away from actual instances of rape from people in power.
"We're not gonna let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America's meat." is just amazing. LOL
Harris was literally just announced as Biden’s VP and they won’t take questions from the press. What are they hiding from?
It's a binary choice, you either vote for Biden or Trump, it's that simple!
And the fact that you’ve been kissing Trump’s ass and trashing Biden constantly for the past six months at least means what dude? You’re a bot and you’re hysterical. I’ve also heard you’re actually Eric Trump...lol
Didn't you mean to say Harris/Biden? He's nothing but a puppet and the Democrats, Soros, etc. are pulling his strings. The country is almost unrecognizable now, if they win it's all over.
😂😂😂 Biden’s way to live...
i  guess we can thank joe biden for this movie
continues his daily lie fest &amp; tries to annoy Biden supporters with Harris-Biden reference. Biden is a big enough man &amp; secure, that this antagonism is not a threat to his self esteem, unlike #TrumpIsAMoron . Trump already raised debt 3T.
Ryan I live in a blue state and I am not voting for Biden. I think I would if I lived in a swing state. It's so hard when it's Trump you are up against.
Yes Dr. Biden. For sure. As  says “Hope reborn.”
I don't think it will get much worse than now. What the hell do we have to lose with Biden!
Absolutely freakin' not, and I know Biden has already suggested such a thing. Shouldn't have happened for Nixon and it sure as hell shouldn't happen for Trump OR his grown co-conspiratorial kids.
Trump is writing the Biden campaign's ads to air in the suburbs
Fox News host claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden - Business Insider. Resign please 🤬
Joe Biden can’t find a journalist who doesn’t secretly work for his campaign!
"Trump’s Attacks on the Biden-Harris Ticket" by Unknown Author via NYTI feel if it were a fair election, Biden would win easily. But with all of the cheating, interference and subterfuge going on I, too, am scared.
Let’s do it to Biden now! He’s had 50 years of being a lousy no good thief!
Biden should announce a cabinet pick right before Trump delivers his acceptance speech. Works both ways🤣
That is a really good reason not to vote Biden in office.
When Biden wins will Dejoy then be prosecuted for interference, since we know Barr won't go there? Do you think Dejoy has thought this out that far in advance?
I’m going to take a Chance here, but does anybody else get the feeling that Bernie Bros are more than willing to cut off their nose to spite their face in this election?  Sure crap on Biden and maybe get 4 more years of Trump, blatant racism and kids in cages.  Good job!
I will put on a hazmat suit if I have to. I will be voting for Biden. Not for some self-centered washed up in competent failed so called President.
Wow! 50 yrs of politics and this is what he comes up with. Trump already said to wear masks, called for travel ban back in January when Biden said it was racist, and brokered  a middleast peace plan. I'm really struggling to see what people see in this guy
?Mandated Masks?  What’s next from Biden/Harris?  Given their propensity for control I imagine they will mandate tracer apps on our mandated smart phones. And they will probably pay for them.  Relax everyone, get a good cuppa Joe.
Anybody else think Joe Biden could have chosen Jeff Flake as a running mate and Trump and Fox News would say the pick was to far left to be trusted?
5) Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate; 4) “Friday Night Massacre” at Post Office; 3) Wars and rumors thereof between Israel and Hamas, Turkey and Greece, and India and China; 2) Satanic Temple claims religious exemption from abortion restrictions;
If I want to vote for another lunatic, another man I wouldn’t trust around my daughters. And vote a woman who stated on national tv she believed Biden’s accusers then forgot about that because power seems more important to her into office? Yeah maybe 🤦🏻‍♂️ replace crazy with crazy?
That is the truth! Biden can't remember how to pronounce Kamala's name!
I honestly can’t vote for either of them I just can’t trump(racist egotistical rapist) and pence ( super racist ) Or Biden (secretly racist) and kamila ( queen of mass incarceration) I honestly at this point gonna let y’all pick how I die cause shits lose lose
I know we all hate trump but do y’all understand Biden is no different?
KAG 2020? Do you mean that you're promising more covid deaths? That's not so great so I'll be voting for Biden.
I’m going to chill tonight.  Eat dinner.  Hang with the kids, then watch the Flyers kick he’ll out of the Habs.  I’m not going to get wrankled over Bros crapping on Biden/Harris.  Then I will sleep soundly.  Going to be a good night.
I think the AC went off! But what a wonderful speech from both of them! So exciting! Go Biden &amp; Harris!
In THIS moment Biden/Harris are proving that we do not have to hold the official title to bring about positive change.  By supporting them, we empower them to officiate change for the next four years.
This is democrat hatred and fake news rhetoric stirring up all the nut jobs thinking they now have a duty to remove our POTUS ! Especially now that they know the Biden Harris ticket is doomed!
This was the natural reaction to Biden's "You ain't black" comment:
Then your gonna complain if he’s in office again. atleast both Biden and his VP have an actual intelligence.
Tall seriously aren’t gonna vote cause miss Biden’s VP? so what your saying is you’d rather have a low IQ dumb ass as your president still? Smh
Remember, voting for Biden/Harris is only a temporary fix to the problem that is abolishing the idea of a two-party system that leads us to choose between corruption and maybe-less-corruption!
Because when Trump loses he wants Biden to have this big mess to try and get us out of while he sits back and criticizes him in tweets.
Why can’t people just disagree about the issues anymore? People feel compelled to propogate these insane lies about politicians they disagree with. Facebook is full of posts saying Kamala Harris’ father is a slave trader or Joe Biden is evil, satanic, etc.
Do a person's actions factor in at all to your endorsements? Because she was picked because she's a cop in the 2020 world of "defund the police", her skin color, and her gender. Biden admitted this by limiting his choices.  At what point does "content of their character" begin?
I love you!   I look forward to all the good work you and Biden will do starting in January!!
Sad thing is I just read she can be president 😪 if something happens to Biden! Look out 🇺🇸 America if they get in!
Kamala and Biden are extremely dangerous for America! Unless you like your whole pay check to go to taxes, lose your second amendment, and let our military go to hell! We need to stop them!!!!
I understand that I need to be more outraged about Presidential abuses and graft.  But I’m at my limit these days.  My outrage changes nothing.  So, I’m just going to wait until Nov, and vote for Joe Biden.
"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character." - MLK Joe Biden purposely choose a woman who is a POC. Makes me sick!
Biden is consistently cringeworthy and it has zero to do with his speech impediment. People say it's elder abuse because he looks confused. It makes me sad.
If Trump publicly calls for Green / Libertarian candidates to be a part of the debate process, it would severely damage the Biden campaign. Either Biden is cool with the process, and gets his vote further split, or he isn't, and he hates democracy.
Doesn’t matter who he picks, I’m voting for Joe Biden❤️
Trump rocks right back at work Biden would be hiding under the desk lol
Of course Biden is against lowering taxes and lies about what Trump said
Can’t get Trump out, can’t vote Biden in. What options do we have?
Oh I agree I’d never take a trump vaccine.  I’m waiting for Joe Biden.  And the vaccine I follow is the Oxford one just because I read one of the scientists behind it injected it into her own kids.  (Obviously older kids)
I see a lot of you call out Trump's clear bullshit, so vote Biden, for the love of God before this nation crumbles any more than it has already, Trump ain't gonna change, things will not get better with this man as our leader, the last four years should've been proof of that.
We need to keep Biden out! No raising taxes!!
Mail in voting is scary not just because of the USPS. This makes it to easy to cheat the system.Every dog , cat and rabbit of Democrats will have names and ss numbers 🙄 and voting for Biden.
He is the best man for President to get the job done ✔. America 🇺🇸 will be in deep shit if Biden gets in!!!!Me neither. I don't think Trump is satisfactory, but if some1 put a gun to my head forcing me to choose bet trump &amp; biden, i'd vote for trump to vote against biden. I don't know why they assume greens would consider voting 4 biden w/o da g party. Some might, others wouldnt
Stop equating conservative and racist, this narrative is ridiculous. Trump won an award from the NAACP because he pioneered racial parity in the golfing community. Trump sued the government to make it happen lmao. Meanwhile Biden was riding shotgun with a KKK grand dragon.
But are you about to for Biden? Cause he has them too so looks like you are 😂
You’re obviously not following the real joe Biden.  Go back to sleep

I remember she made him cry! She is fierce. I can't wait to vote for Biden/Harris.
? Not sure k agree or disagree but can if biden wins you can cover the higher taxes
btw, I'm voting for Biden because Trump is a neofascist and is actively trying to remove the tools of democracy. To me, he is a stop-gap president that we will challenge and challenge hard in four years. I wish everyone voted for Biden but they have a right to their vote.
Settle 😂😂😂 Biden can have rape allegations that’s cool but not trump?
But Biden doesn’t have a rape allegation?
Trump Ads Attack Biden Through Deceptive Editing and Hyperbole - The New York Times
I will be happy to see your taxes rise if Biden wins.
The whole point of the argument "black people voted for Biden" argument is to literally tokenize black people and monothing the group. I'm telling you that you can disable the argument by exactly suggesting that black people, based on age and voting patterns, are not monolithic.
Trump is going to destroy Biden/Harris. He really knows how to speak to the people. Even dumbbells should be able to understand this. Then again, there's the MSM aka. DNC operatives.
Doesn't change my point. Biden is a sexual qssaulter, hair sniffer, nonconsual kisser and toucher. He IS the Patriarchy.
Very True. That includes authors of the op-ed “endorsing” Elizabeth Warren to be Biden’s VP. I wonder how did that work out? Obviously, it didn’t. Not at all.
Klobuchar polling at 5% &amp; Buttigieg polling above that, that alone provides the 10% margin which Biden used to win in numerous states during Super Tuesday. Add on to the fact that Warren remained in the race pulling votes from Sanders. The strategy against Sanders was clear.
Compassion? Lol. Joe Biden literally said "Lock the SOBs up" while arguing for the crime bill.
Post it directly to Biden and thank you for bringing a voice to this murderous practice.
Biden has zero political argument if Trump took a time to resonate with people  on this issue.He knows he can't go with depth in this issue,so why not navigate as his opponents are doing? They know he can't hit em  back on this given his position,yet Trump can elaborate on masks
If Rubio and Kasich had done for Cruz in 2016 what Buttigieg and Klobuchar did for Biden in 2020, we wouldn’t have Trump.
Yes. Joe Biden has been accused of inappropriately touching 8 women and sexual assaulting one of them. Patriarchy is running a predator as our nominee.

Cheetoh can pardon #DeJoy of crimes before  DOJ files charges?
I definitely agree on the first count, and this may be naive of me but I don't think at this moment people will check out even if Biden is in--things are too bad. I also don't believe the Democratic Party would learn a lesson if he lost, they will never learn and they don't care
I remember .... and I remember Demsr and Repubs uniting with Ukr's worst neonazis to start the coup that killed over 50,000 innocent human beings and pple profited from that including Biden's son
#almost_1K       I'll follow back...I'm like Biden, I can sniff 1,000
Last week Biden posted a lie about Trump (regarding “fine people”) but it is not flagged; neither was a tweet by Iran’s leader threatening the use force on the US. But Twitter did flag Trump tweets about issues with mail-in ballots and that he will use force against rioters.
Oh, I encourage it. If you think that Biden can beat him, you’re smoking crack.

I do agree that Trump is very bad. But the conditions that made Trump possible preceded Trump, and will continue to get worse under Biden.  I'm of the mind to deal with the emergency at hand but I will not be surprised if 2024 brings someone worse than Trump.
Biden gives me the creeps just as much as Trump. I don’t want him to be president either.  I’m not for the lesser of two evils. That’s just as bad.  For everyone (Geared towards trump supporters) calling Biden a pedophile... do you all just ignore the fact that Trump was on trial
Haha. Can’t make this stuff up. So the people that are supposed to deliver  the ballots, support Biden? Unbelievable
Um, hearing Joe Biden say the words "I badly need you", is just, well, a little unsettling....
i can see your point but idk if I agree. I've thought a lot about it and I think it isn't an Obama situation where people will go back to sleep.  A lot has happened in the past 5 years. In some ways I think it could be easier to mobilize the left under Biden.

Remember kiddos, Billy Eyelash singing at the DNC doesn’t make Joe Biden less of a rapist.
By not voting Biden you’re ok with four more years of this criminal who has FLAGRANTLY used our tax dollars to enrich himself, his family and his business?  Please!
This is evident by the fact that despite all major moderates withdrawing, states such as Colorado, Minnesota, Massachussets, Texas and Maine saw Biden only beat Sanders by less than a 10% margin. That is DESPITE the entire moderate and centrist vote going to Biden.
The Democratic Party had to coalesce around Biden before Super Tuesday or else the moderate vote would have been split to such a degree that Sanders would have received wins in numerous states.

Actually POTUS lost a billion from 3.1 to 2.1 net worth from 2019 to 2020 and went from 275 to 1011 in the USA per Forbes.  However. Your point is well taken.  His 400k salary goes to other agencies.  Never mind Maxine, Schumer, Biden and Feinstein. Career pols grifting.
Oh, I know that, and it was an answer regarding supporting Biden over Trump. In no way, shape or form is Bowman politically aligned with Biden and if you did even a tiny bit of research you'd know that too.
Did Trump release his taxes? Cuz Biden did.

Denying ventilators to states bc of personal beefs. Throwing away Covid tests bc people dying in blue states is politically advantageous to him.  An end to all asylum and the Remain in Mexico policy.  I'll never defend Biden but I think there are ways Trump is uniquely sadistic.

They didn’t endose Biden the child raper and racist so we all good with voting for Trump
Biden is taking away the postal service?
Are these the same polls that said he had no path to victory? I don't give them allot of credibility anymore. You roll your sleeves up, put your head down and do the work in front of you to make Biden the next POTUS on 11/4/2020. That's how you win not polls.
Because Bowman wants universal healthcare. He ran on that. And you want to lie to yourself and say Bowman aligns with Biden just because he supports Biden over Trump, that doesn't mean they are politically aligned. Which is obvious if you did a bit of critical thinking.
Yes x 100%.  I think they are also sick of him and hoping for Biden to win and take over. If he wasn't so evil somebody might've stepped up and said something.  I imagine they're just like 🤷.

You can’t reform Trump do be more of a good-doer than Biden
Right now, Joe Biden’s strategy of keeping the focus on President Trump and pitching a broad tent is working well,  writes.
Biden was at the top of the polls literally the entire way from the moment he announced. Not by a lot but it was a highly fragmented field. Bernie technically didn’t even beat Pete in Iowa. Except for Nevada he underperformed across the board. Can we stop this already?
I hope Plouffe is advising Biden. There is no better strategist.
You think Biden is really making it till November?? 😂😂😂😂😂 you are watching a movie! Enjoy 🍿
Would not even do a debate if I would be Biden. Why lower yourself to attend a circus? A debate with a chronic liar is no debate at all. Same for Kamala.

Why do you hate cops so much? Why are Democrats so violent these days? Why can’t they actually discuss issues instead of burning things. Is that what you want for the whole country if Biden wins?
which the govt prevented by planning to charge him under the irrelevant Espionage Act, which unjustifiably prohibits that defense. If Rice is demonizing Snowden, I'm extremely glad she wasn't chosen by Biden!
Biden hasn't done that, though.
So if other candidates dropped out and their supporters moved to Biden and not Bernie — what does that tell you?
If your brain was put into a parakeet  the parakeet would fly backwards Joe Biden
Biden or Obama wouldn’t have pulled all the other crap you have pulled. We are not going to be distracted by your shiny, meaningless accord.
No, the bit where the entire Democratic Party had to tell candidates to drop out of the race to support Biden so that together they could stop Sanders. The strategy was clear as day for anyone willing to look at it objectively.
I feel like I need to have both Donald Trump and Joe Biden bumper stickers because they’re both just the two best guys who could possibly run this great nation
#Biden was not the one to pick #Harris it was #Obama , he offered his support only if Harris was #VP.  #HarrisHatesHindus
He recently said he was considering meeting with Maduro and that he was considering withdrawing support for Guiado .. he was instantly attacked publicly by Biden and the rest of the neolibs .. he may back down in the face of the fierce reaction. We should support him on this imo
also I just know I just KNOW all these folk saying shit like that are gonna kick their feet up if Biden wins sharing memes like
I’m more concerned with keeping the House, i voted 3rd party in ‘16 , I feel I need to vote Biden /Harris (Biden is old) but although I know trump won’t take NYS , he may win college but let the next generation know a majority of voters don’t back his policies.
Really? I’m also insulted. But by what you said. How moronic that you make the assumption that Biden was choosing just any woman “pandering” for votes. Being a woman and qualified can be done by the same person.   But you wouldn’t know about that.   #BidenHarris

In response to the "old black people voted for Biden," just point out that young black people voted for Bernie, and the only common denominator of what Biden won was boomers. No more, no less. Had nothing to do with race.

Hey Ron, this isn’t going to work. Btw... what the hell were doing in Russia?! Seriously, I’m an ex-republican and I’m voting for Joe Biden no matter what any of you say.
Biden-Trump Polls Looking ‘Remarkably Similar’ To Summer Of 2016

In 1970 it was illegal for the postal Union to strike. There was 100 percent support. It took the economy to their knees. As we see the disruption of the US Mail by DT and his treasonous administration, It has wide consequences to the People. He has declared war. State AGs:AZ ,
Did he say he was gonna vote for Biden ???
Romney doesn't have to switch parties. He just should announce he's voting for Biden to protest what Trump has done to his Republican Party...
Biden &amp; Kamala or is it Kamala &amp; Biden?  What are they for?  Open borders  Medicare for all  criminals before law abiding citizens  Actually let Biden's own words do the talking  Kamala too
Case for the emotional candidate story:
A sober look at the reality, without emotions about Trump getting in the way, reveals that a Biden administration is far worse for the world.
She should tell Biden that...
You should be focusing on getting Biden to throw in some Funky Winkerbean references as Rust Belt outreach.
No I do not hope he beats Trump and here's why. Biden wants a coup in Venezuela, Trump wants to recognize Maduro and dump Guiado. Biden wants to continue the Afghanistan war, Trump wants to end it. I won't support either of them, but Trump is definitely the 'lesser evil'
Nope. I think a Biden administration is worse for the world.

An economy cannot be restored by raising taxes and over regulating businesses.  That was Obama’s plan, it’s Biden’s Plan now and it will fail and destroy the economy again like it did under Obama.
In Iowa, and around the country, polls are showing older voters trending toward Joe Biden and away from President Trump—a potentially tectonic development.
What do U know when u have all ur millions to cushion ur ass u have no idea what it is to be a working American stay out of politics U have no voice in it n if biden gets in u can kiss all ur millions good bye bc he’ll be taxing u till U have nothing
Watch "Noah, a former Republican from PA, knows that Joe Biden's character is what this country needs" on YouTube
Nowhere in Biden’s agenda, or on its website, does the campaign mention one of the biggest promises it made during the primary: a 100-day moratorium on any deportations of immigrants already in the United States.
How did you oppose Biden on bedrock issues and now you support him?  “It was a de...bate. He he. It was a debate. It was a debate. Literally, the whole reason it was a debate. It was called a he he debate. There were journalists there covering the debate because it was a debate.”
Lol. Ok. I supported Bernie in the primary in 2016 and 2020, but right now I'm on Team Biden... Can't believe there are people now peeps who wud vote against Biden or not at all to own the centrists. 4 years is enough for me with such a right wing government
What is odd is your attacks on Biden’s son Good God, man, Jared had a federal plan for fighting Covid and dropped it when he saw spikes in blue states. Jared deliberately let Americans die. Focus on that FACT!
It blows uo trumps argument that Biden and Harris are “the Radical Left”
They need me to use the power of inherent contempt and start arresting these people.  Literally the future of the country is at stake.  When Biden wins the election there needs to be a commission to go after every one of these criminals and lock them away.
That’s exactly what they want. They want Biden to lose so they can spend the next 4 yrs how they spent the last 3.5. Saying Sanders would have won, Spew establishment bs, saying they were right when in truth they were actively undermining Biden. They don’t give a crap
Kamala Harris last year on Biden's praise for racist segregationists  via
Lara Trump has signed an NDA and she’s on the payroll. You think she’s going to be honest? Oh, and women were not insulted with Biden’s VP choice. Trump camp is nervous 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Biden's Veepstakes was so bad that Kamala was the least bad of the final four
Didn’t Biden speak at the funeral of a dem senator from WV that was in the KKK?  Thats some pretty recent history #glasshouses
Anything Trump had his hand in is a bankruptcy of your life waiting to happen. I’ll wait for Biden to clean up trump’s FDA and CDC mess first, thanks. 😐
never responded to me. They’re so pathetic &amp; cowardly. All people who don’t vote for Biden are selfish.
How would you like to hear 'it is what it is' in regards to a family member that died from Covid-19? That's disrespectful, so he doesn't get respect in return - it's simple. I don't give a shit about Biden, we're talking about Trump aren't we?
Trump rips 'Sleepy Joe' Biden for not taking any questions from reporters during an event with Kamala Harris
I don’t believe with this “get better” with Joe Biden! Nice gentleman but to old and demention! This is to seriously for our Country . Trump is to old too, but around him is a lot smart and perspective people!
is such a coward. They’re also ridiculous &amp; selfish because they’re not going to vote for Biden.
OH Bull----t Trump everything. IT IS The FDA that approves a vaccine. You must be one of those far left liberal who blames everything on Trump. If Biden &amp; Harry get in "Watch Out"
probably smart of biden to avoid a campaign relitigating beghazi and having to run to the right of trump on snowden
all politicians should be in prison 😸 especially Biden and trump
On May 1st, the NYT Editorial Board called for a full and thorough investigation into allegations that Joe Biden sexually assaulted Tara Reade as well as Trump's sexual misconduct. The DNC and the Biden camp have refused, as have Trump and RNC.
Joe Biden is a man of character. A true mensch. He’s every Donald Trump is not.
You literally copied someone else on that rent free Joe Biden comment. You’re lame man. Can’t even come up w something original. Go troll somewhere else.
I’ve never felt more pessimistic about our democracy. We have 1 party whose base seems just fine with unaccountable fascist dictatorship that makes it almost impossible to hold the other party accountable as they also sell us out. Now Dems say Biden shouldn’t debate. We’re fucked
No I, voting for Biden because it’s a two party system and the other choice is a racist misogynistic deplorable moron supported by racist misogynistic deplorable morons.
Biden said it ends in 3 months after mask mandate is over.
Stipulated.  Now, can we also agree that other government employees should stay out of it?

Unless Biden got a stroke down in his pants from u , Jeff? I knew many Jeff’s. They were male prostututes
keep skewing everything to make it look bad, like all the democrats do. you dont even know. you all R just mad and butt hurt that republicans won. you realize if Biden wins the world will be in shambles, the market will be awful, and taxes are getting raised for everyone. f that
Why does Biden keep getting credit for saying things progressives knew years earlier?
It's pretty funny that Biden's entire pitch to his supporters is to make America great again.
Hillary Clinton carried Oregon by 11 points in 2016 (and the GOP hasn't won there since 1984). But the continued menance of the violent Left will give Trump a chance to narrow that gap. Biden will almost certainly win the state, but by a less impressive margin. #PortlandRiots
voted for the war in Iraq. Biden supported the war in Libya. Obama &amp; Biden didn't end the wars in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan, they started two new ones in Syria &amp; Libya. Their failed policies led to the emergence of ISIL &amp; the instability across the ME.

Watch "Trump does not represent our country well. Due to Trump's poor behavior, Dave is voting for Biden." on YouTube
American Independence Day this year is November 3 when we vote in the Democratic majority into the House and Senate, as well as President Biden and Vice President Harris.
Serious question: what’s your plan when Trump is out of office? How do you plan to earn an income or work in general? Everything on your site and twitter is about Trump I don’t see anything about Biden so what’s the plan? Skid row? Compton?
As Melania uses a mail in ballot and Trump advises red states to use mail in ballots. Just say you’d rather Trump soil the integrity of our election then see him lose to Biden.
Which video, this one?    It's a pretty good demonstration of how your attacks on Biden are far more appropriately directed towards trump.  Only thing "deceptive" is your propaganda show.
A president Joe Biden would be great for the stock market: former Obama official  by
Biden is a child pedo and Kamala isn’t really allowed to even be VP with parents from god only knows where. Also Biden’s son married his dead brothers wife. I think the Trump family is holy compared to Biden and Kamala
#Biden Biden and the rest are dirty crooked  politicians who care nothing for the people.  They wanted destruction of our country from the beginning!  Selfish power hungry tools!
Biden -Harris needs to choose an AG that will prosecute many of #Trumps administration
To clarify, I’m voting for Biden on the  line, lol.
We can start by NOT voting for Biden/Harris. First baby step in the political revolution, if we're still talking about that ... we can go all out supporting down ticket progressives only ... a general strike demanding a huge bailout for WORKERS and Healthcare for ALL
#michealOsterholm thank you for your words of wisdom regarding the surge in the Covid 19 cases.. we Patriots are not afraid... we're more afraid of biden getting elected then we are of covid-19..(he won't.)
Really? You sure about that? Ask Kamala if she still believes tara reads, the woman Joe Biden sexually assaulted.
I love how people are making a big deal out of Biden’s middle school grades AS IF that’s an efficient marker of his intelligence and somehow predicts his current cognitive functioning.    That wouldn’t stand in a court of law.  #neuropsychologist
no one believes joe biden is writing his own tweets
Banned flights from China as Pelosi and Biden called him racist...This is TRULY eye opening. If your vote did not matter, this would not be occurring. They do not bb want Biden and Kamala in office. Trump is committing a crime in plain sight.
If Biden hadn't run, our (in my case, free-speech-antiwoke-liberals) camp may have rallied behind someone else suitable - perhaps Bloomberg or Klobuchar, and their numbers would've been better.
If you're a moderate, or a free-speech-liberal, your camp might have looked at all their options and early on coalesced onto Biden, resulting in dismal results for other candidates of that flavour. Even though most such candidates would pair well with Biden.
Where’s the Biden parades ? Lol
Socialism and Marxism can not work and will never work. Biden’s ideas lead to the destruction of the USA . Look at Chicago, NYC, Seattle, Baltimore, and Venezuela. Is that what thru want for the USA 🇺🇸?
so biden sniffing women? LMAO like there’s an ENTIRE compilation 😭
Twitter is surprised that so many people are supporting Trump.  Twitter,  supports Biden and the radical left.  It is what it is.
Plenty of Joe Biden yard signs all over America! Never have I seen so much enthusiasm for a candidate 😂
we have a biden/harris table of books at work and some woman stopped on her way out of the store to take the time to flip them all over so you couldn’t see the covers 🙄
Jill Biden “cares” is pushing a man sliding down the slope of dementia for a job he cannot handle. That’s some sort of caring!
A ham sandwich has the same cognitive recognition as Biden. Maybe slightly more.
Communists for Biden
Joe Biden’s family owned slaves!
Joe Biden is a racist!
I live in NJ and I have seen ONE Biden sign. I can’t say I’ve seen many Trump signs but def more than one!

Gotta say Joe Biden can stop short of killing someone on 5th and I'm still voting for him.  #FuckOctoberSurprise
We've been saying the both of them are saving the places of the real nominees. Never seen Biden ever going that far, without health issues.
I can oppose Biden and not vote for Trump.

Biden doesn't even know what day it is today let alone trying to tell the entire country to wear masks. Even if he does become President, this won't make it through Congress because Republicans and Democrats will fight each other the whole time.
Biden stupidity on full display.
Join me in supporting #BidenHarris2020 via    81 days. 81 days to organize, to mobilize, and fight to ensure we can finally say goodbye to the national nightmare we call Donald Trump.  Text READY to 30330 to help VP Biden &amp; Sen. Harris win in Nov!
Was never my first choice either but I will crawl through smoldering wreckage to vote for Biden if I have to. Framing it in these terms is basically whining about having to make difficult choices in order to save democracy in this country.
Biden’s strategy for Covid-19: let’s all wear masks mandatory until November 3, and then the day after no more masks. It is so sad that he politicize the COVID19 crisis .

First Step Act the opposite of Biden’s 1994 Crime Bill. Educate yourself fool.
Biden can't pronounce his own name at this point.
I have every ounce of faith in Biden that he can do what he needs to. First he has to fix the screw ups from trump. Then he &amp; Sen Harris will do whatever they have to , to progress our govt for the people for real

please hold Biden accountable and ask him why he plagiarizes every speech?
Maybe Biden forgot he plagiarized? He is dementia.
If Biden- Harris win, they will reverse it and make Iran more powerful by renewing the nuclear deal. That’s a real threat to not only America but the world. They are a real threat and shouldn’t win.
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris  *(And a whole bunch of other lies and racist comments.* MY VIEWS
Former presidential candidate and Sen. Kamala Harris (D–Calif.) said last year that she believed three women (Lucy Flores, Caitlyn Caruso, and D.J. Hill) who accused Biden of inappropriate touching or kissing. "I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story
That is why we need someone else other than biden I mean I we really saying biden is the best we can produce among democrat,give us charles Booker or Warren or Rice or ed Markey
(to be clear, what I mean is use access only afforded by one's role for political purposes - if it were open to everyone - if Biden and whomever the Greens and LP folk nominated could use the Whitehouse for this, less a problem)
Voting for Biden will bring this... This judge wants to destroy an 8-year old boy whose crazy mother wants him to be a girl. And they order the father to pay for it!
If Biden wins, China will enter the US market even more aggressively than before. It’s a real threat.
Because Bernie said nothing but the truth and the black base didn't come out for him at all. If not for covid there would have been a really fight between Bernie and Biden. It showed that a lot of 2016 probably came down to Hillary not exciting anyone.
you made a video of Biden talking over that Godspeed you! Black emperor song right?
Didn't Trump just sign Criminal Justice Reform, while Biden signed the '94 crime bill. GOP never advocated to hide exculpatory evidence to preserve a prosecutors winning percentage
Actually a ass wipe. He should ask Biden that

Biden called on Trump when he mandated an end to riots with national guard or federal troops as being a form of monarchy or dictatorship. Now he calls on a mandating governors to mandate  to wear a mask. He forgets that governors should make their own decisions.

Kamala Harris Is Biden's VP Pick -- Here's What It Means For The Election And Beyond
I am a registered Republican.  I am voting Biden, so don't try to tag me.  Prison labor is a bad deal all around.  The warden doesn't get what he deserves, nor do the inmates.  Producers who compete with free-market labor get undercut.  Tell us how to do it better.
Donated $2800 (the federal limit on contributions to a candidate) to Biden for President; this election should be a shoe-in and Trump is in my view a uniquely terrible leader, but always hedge your bets and bend reality towards your preferred outcomes.
When no one was looking, he said they have to have the Biden/Harris logo, or a Trump Sucks. That's the only choices. 🤪
Just when you thought Biden couldn’t be any more racist!!
How many pictures exist with Trump &amp; Epstein ... and how many exist if Biden &amp; Epstein??
At 12:01 p.m. 20 January 2021, having been sworn in, Biden will be in charge, even if he does not occupy the White House.  Failing that, the Speaker of the House can act.    First priority: change the nuclear codes.
I think she should take that time to speak about how she raised so much money and said she would vote for biden and is still only given 60 seconds. Talk about some progressive victories and say we need more progressives running for congress
Its just sad that there are ppl who believe this lie that kamala is a radical left 🤦‍♂️ all you ppl on the right could actually win if you just told the truth. You don't even have to lie to beat biden and kamala and yet you still do 🤦‍♂️
Absolutely freakin' not, and I know Biden has already suggested such a thing. Shouldn't have happened for Nixon and it sure as hell shouldn't happen for Trump OR his grown co-conspiratorial kids.
*Restore America-Russia under Obama-Biden   *Obama/Biden/Clinton have unfinished business like Uranium one, resumption of annexation and violation of Ukraine's territory by Putin. *Pleasing Iran &amp; stomping Israel!  The return of the military-industrial complex under #BidenHarris.
Omg this is why i hope biden loses because of ppl like you
Kamala Harris jump all over Kavanaugh for alleged sexual misconduct and said she believed it was true. She also believed the women who came forward and said Biden did something with his finger. And now that joe ask her to be VP He’s is a solid guy.
If Joe Biden's health continues to get worse I believe that Kamala will be sworn in as president. It may not be in the first 100 day's or the first week. It will be on the first day. That's if Joe and Kamala were to win this election.
She was a loser in her presidential run and now she’s a star. Fake news, socialists Dems help to promote her. It will do nothing to help Biden. Trump 2020 👍🇺🇸👏👏
You are bunch of liars and cheaters who have destroyed our country because of your lust for power! The Biden/Harris ticket will save our country!
Can anybody tell me what Biden saying in this video ,,🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
I’ve been to jail twice and I’d hate to get some bs ass charge and then be in jail FOREVER bc y’all bitches started voting for Biden bc you and Kamala in the same fuccn sorority...
You're either unredeemably cynical or you've seriously drunk the #Republican Kool Aid. Biden/Harris is a fine, stable ticket for.our country after the wack-job theft-ring  that has been the Trump administration.
Am definitely voting for Biden !
Pay them no mind. This is the election : Maybe 1% of GOP voters that will vote Biden, 1% of Bernie nihilists, 1% of Independents, 1%+ of women and 1% of Obama 2012 turned Trump 2016 voters because they hated Hillary. Add that to Hillary’s 2016 vote total and Biden wins.
Thank you finally someone else see’s the positive and hoping for a change for this country #KamalaHarris  Joe Biden
The people who are like Biden wasn’t my choice. If I can’t have Bernie I guess I’m voting Trump... are you for real? Like you really think Trump is the best choice after all of what he has caused?
Well, they did have the Soros/Biden playbook of Planned Looting &amp; Destruction and Wilmington wasn't listed today.
Biden - Harris to the finish line!!!

Joe Biden has been in government for almost 50 years getting paid every day...can you name 5 major accomplishments he has had. I’ll even give you one...the disasterous 1994 Crime Bill...so seriously, try without Googling (it doesn’t help) Name 4 accomplishments...
I thought she was running for BO, what’s all this President talk...Ohhhhhhh so you all know that Biden is a prop, thanks for confirming!
I think it makes them both racist. They both support the same racist agenda. No? Just bcz she is a POC doesn't make her exempt from racism. Biden found the perfect running mate...someone who locked up more blacks than he did.
One of the perks of owning our home is that now I can take part in the American tradition of lawn-sign warfare. Doesn’t help that I’m smack in the middle of Trump County, NYC, but I have to do something to fight back.  Current winner is “Biden 2020: Dear Lord Make It Stop”
Kamala Harris said Joe was a racist and groper on the campaign trail. Now  picked for VP Biden is a American hero.
Biden and Harris pushing for the minority and black votes. Ask yourself what has the democrats done in the past 30 years for both. It took a businessman to become president to help minorities And blacks move forward. Trump has done more in 3 yrs then anyone
fuck biden fuck trump we've been given the illusion of choice but the reality is the system is fucked
Joe Biden used to believe Mrs Hillary Clinton should've been the President of the United States of America not Mr Donald Tump. But that was before he nominated Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate for VP, somebody who makes all of us look younger.🌟
Yes Doctor Biden  God Blees you a keep you safe on the trail .We have to win .
The same will happen, once or twice, in a Biden administration.  That's the result of having ambassadorial appointments go to donors.  Next term, I hope the appointees spend their own cash on residence upgrades and parties, the way they have always done...but not in this term.
Kamala Harris was force to leave the run for president with a 2% vote of confidence, now picked by Biden for Vice President she is now hailed as a super star by fake news and the, Democrat party. Hippocrates
Is Kamala Harris perfect? Probably not.  Your tweet is critical enough to make me believe you would vote against her.    Fine. Do it.  You'll never find a job.  At least with Biden, you have a chance.
I think we the American people need someone strong and tuff to go against orange face Donald trump and kamala Harris is that woman along with Biden to take our country back 🏆🏆🏆🏆happy kamala won🔥🔥
Joe Biden SNIFFING little girls (COMPILATION)
Your being conned by the Dems. Biden might as well be a cardboard cutout. Really who do you think your voting for it’s not Biden. It will be everybody who wants America The land of the unfree.
It’s amazing how Biden/Harris blame Trump for the unemployment rate when it is the Democratic governors who insist businesses stay closed!  #Hypocrites
Think about if your a Democrat your not voting for Biden your voting for Kalama Harris not Biden the Dems have no shame. She called him racist  now she’s with him PHONEY.Democrats &amp; Republicans will be doomed to a socialist country.GODhelp the whole country.
I did and it went directly to  no bypassing through at all. Now we have definitive proof of the connection!                         Antifa &amp; Biden = Perfect Together
A gracious and cogent speech by Biden. How ready are we to have leaders who speak in complete thoughts and sentences?
Joe Biden sounds so presidential right now
Sexual assault like Joe Biden did to Tara Reade? You know the one Kamala said she believes? Which one of Joe’s sexual assaults are you talking about?
I don't like you or Biden, that being said I dislike you far worse; It's not even close, your are much more evil! You have been sued for race discrimination towards Black Americans for not renting to us. You still want to kill the Central Park 5 ! Kick🦶 rocks🗻 with flip flops
biden is basically another trump ana, it's all a bunch of bullshitt, the world is fucked....
I know the Biden campaign wouldn’t do it!
FOX Business just said the first thing on the Biden website is a mask with their logo. All they need now is a hat so all of his supporters look exactly the same. First they control you by virus, then they make you all look the same. Then freeze wages. Communism anyone?
I care CCP is betting on Biden’s win.
Democratic strategists on the news: ”I believe only a very big minority of people, who don’t want to vote for Biden will vote for Trump.”  ...glad it’s only a very big minority 🤣
This will now be my response  to anyone who trashes Biden or Harris, while excusing Trump’s despicable actions.. or to anyone who fails to wear a face mask...
How come Biden was not wearing a helmet when riding his bike? #justasking

Donald Trump Mike Pence Joe Biden and Kamala Harris didnt grow up like me so now what should I do?
Time for the fascist racist ideology of hate divisiveness and fear to end .Time for Biden/kamala.
Is it really necessary for y’all to get on the internet and talk about how “I don’t like Kamala, but...” It don’t matter! This woman is making history and we need to vote for her and Biden regardless!
If you told my wife and I that on election day we would have to crawl through 10 lava fields layered with covid encrusted glass shards to vote for Biden/Harris, we would do it 💯
Pretty horrid stance on abortion for one. When you consider Biden’s frailty, she could be making decision very soon.
I'll be voting Biden/ Harris no matter what y'all come up with!
Joe Biden Picks Sen. Kamala Harris As The Running Mate To Defeat A Trump...  via  trump wins 2020 election dems don’t want to win
This sums up my feelings quite well on Biden picking Harris and what the party actually stands for

President- Joe Biden   Vice President- Kamala Harris   Secretary of State- Pete Buttigieg   Secretary of Defense- Tammy Duckworth  Attorney General- Susan Rice   Secretary of Treasury- Elizabeth Warren
Biden’s VP once called him racist
So Biden all of a sudden isn’t a weirdo pedo cause Kamala is next to him ..
I don’t think it will be a Biden/Kamala switch. She isn’t personable at all.
Great job, this is the Joe Biden I remember from my younger days. I never cared for him.
Biden is a Cuck for the Left ...
Thank you!!!! We will vote Biden/ Harris to save our beloved nation.
Kamala Harris, Biden's V.P. Pick, Is First Woman of Color on Major Party Ticket

Yes she does is bringing this country together and she knows it could be done with Biden.
We as women should support each other that’s the problem in this country we don’t know how to support each other. I believe with Biden and Kamala we could definitely do that we need it this country is broken under the leadership of Trump.
That’s great &amp; all but, if you don’t use your platform wisely it won’t make a difference if she was green 😂. Biden old as hell, most likely she’ll take over by year 2. So we’ll see how it goes 🤷🏾‍♂️

Dude, you called it the “Biden Crime Bill” stop this LoL.Biden is not president yet, but when he is, he will answer truthfully &amp; respectfully, unlike the rude behavior displayed by #TrumpFailedAmerica toward reporters, especially female and worse if minority.For now, he will wait for the agreed upon debates set by the debate commission
No I, voting for Biden because it’s a two party system and the other choice is a racist misogynistic deplorable moron supported by racist misogynistic deplorable morons.
Biden's losing big. The riots
Lol... That was quick. I guess there really aren't any questions Biden hasn't answered after all.
Here's another source that again questions the claim...
It's been fact checked several times...
Biden is not racism he work with OBAMA very well no problem at all bump this remark from trump ok👋👋👋
People are complaining about Biden's record on bussing. Thing is, when the gov't is full of segregationists, those are the people you have to make deals with. Liberals aren't going to sweep in with a flaming sword and run out all the racists.
The text today was "donate to stop crooked hillary from being in Biden's administration"  Amateur hour
Uhhh he’s objectively bad for DACA and other undocumented people seeking legalization. Not that Biden is much better, but, life would be a lot easier under Biden
What did Obama and Biden do for the African Americans in the 8 years in power? Nothing! Remember that when you vote.
I’m cool with this. She’ll make Joe Biden her VP, then resign. Then Joe and Kamala will take power.

Will you and W endorse Joe Biden?  Please bring Jimmy on too.  I’m begging
The whole "we get him out with a Biden landslide" trope is bullshit, right? Does anyone know where that originated?
Your stretching the fuck out the one drop rule also Brown skin doesn’t mean ally. Kamala sent her whole career invested in anti blackness. Her partner Joe Biden the reason so many black men are in jail. Your not for black people if you ignore all the damage they done.
He would know an island from a peninsula . He moved his residency to Florida because  as soon as Biden says I do they're indicting him on some serious charges oh yes there going to be an arrest. The presidency saved him for now , because you can't indict a sitting president.
That's a negative  Biden has a proven 8 years in the White House record Kamala has a public background  prosecutorial background,. Trump and his so call pro are a bunch of money grubbing do nothing's. Trump has claimed bankruptcy 9 times every business hes started tanked
Ok. Yeah. Why not endorse Joe Biden? That might help. Or You Need To Calm Down
And he says Biden is mentally incompetent. Mr. Projection. It's a real horserace between Trump's stupidity and depravity.
Biden-Harris are focused on the pandemic as #TrumpMeltdown should. We cannot recover until that is addressed. Also, there is no V-shaped recovery. We are still solidly in pandemic mode.
Keep that special bond with you Mr. Biden
AND I GET THAT. Truly, I do. And that was literally his only reasoning for likely voting trump again.  I asked what he doesn’t like about Biden.  He mentions the video of Biden smelling a girls head.

It will be amazing to see you as a Vice President, and hopefully, once you and Biden fix this mess, it will be even better to see you as the first Woman President of the United States.
Bullshit Biden has 8 years of White House  experience.  Trumps been there almost4 and hasn't experienced anything but laughter boos and failures oh and the 20,000 lies
Ok dumb don, you are so sharp you are cutting down our people in every way possible, job losses, income inequality, COVID 19 mismanagement, 165,000 plus deaths, homelessness on the rise, economic volatility, and on and on. Biden may stutter but you lie!

This is just a stunning embarrassment for Bruni and the Times. The woman candidate isn’t emotional enough for you to connect with? She’s insufficiently harping on her background for you to feel that frisson you were hoping for?
Not exactly the same. Trump is the President who needs to answer questions pertaining to what is going on now, and what the administration response is. Biden should do interviews, but he is not currently in power. With power comes responsibility to answer to the people.
they know trump is going to lose. So theyll mess up America to the point  thatwhen Biden takes office itll be such chaos that fox can start talking about see what happens you vote  Dem. Because fox and the Republicans  have convenient amnesia.  When it comes to the mess they made
“My reporters?” Are you kidding? They don’t work FOR you, they work to report ABOUT you. The fact that you lie ALL THE TIME and are actively trying to suppress the vote means they will hold you accountable. Biden doesn’t lie.
Biden doesn’t remember how to drive
Does Biden support sending kids back? I mean last time I checked he didn’t and said it wasn’t safe, but I could be wrong. Trump wants everything and all things open along with the idiot DeVos.
I’m glad I’m one of them.

We are with Biden and Kamala . At least we have an ideal of their politics and what they are capable of, Trump had no political experience. Just maybe this experience coming into the White House  can turn this mess around. Cause this covid19 is on a killing spree.
Interesting. People are really upset with Angela Davis for supporting Kamala Harris. Yes Kamala’s done some fucked up, inexcusable things in her career. But if y’all are not voting Biden/Harris I genuinely wanna know what’s the alternative?
Biden really only need WI, Michigan, Ohio and PA
And yet Wallace carries Biden’s water. 🙄🙄🙄
I need an edit of the "Whatever It Takes" trailer for Avengers Endgame, except instead of Thanos, it's Trump talking about the awful things he's done, and really, it's a blatent "Vote For Biden" ad because we're not gonna last another four years under this buffoon.

My man just gobbling White dick and calling it empowerment 😪 which celebrity or talking head told you evicting Trump was Black people top priority like racism is all trump and his folks. Like Biden n Kamala aren’t as anti Black as him but in sheep clothes. Wake up
Unless Biden goes into complete basement mode and lets Harris be the surrogate, I don't think the focus on her lasts more than a couple of weeks. Chatter will still come up.  But do you think they'd just ignore Biden?  I support him, and recognize there is MATERIAL on him.

It is crystal clear what their intentions are. Biden is a weak AF candidate with dementia. It’s common sense. I also really trust 3rd party ballot harvesters.....NOT!
If there is mandatory mail in ballots it will be the most fucked up fraudulent election in history. Ballots will be tossed, forged and 3rd party operatives will pick them up. Unofficial ballots won’t be counted for half a year. They know Biden is weak AF and has dementia
You LOST me at "The Biden-Harris ticket is formidable"   The only and I mean ONLY way  loses in 2020 is Election?Voter Fraud........
Serious question: is there an actual political strategy here, or are you just being an idiot. You are aware Biden won’t be spending a dime in New York no matter what you tweet, right.
I think his chances of 2024 are done if Biden wins which I fully expect.  I highly doubt Kamala would step aside. Maybe a shot at VP though.
So I guess Biden fits your standard of what a Catholic is then..
I am not one of those "Biden people". Trump is who he is but to experience the idiocies of other Americans regurgitating Trump's nonsensical thinking makes it very difficult to defend my country to  people around the world who are now always laughing at us.
I suspect Amy K will be getting her reward soon.  After Clyburn, she did more to boost Biden's campaign than anyone. Both with the endorsement and gracefully bowing out of VP.  What Biden does for her is more important than Harris's graciousness.
wrong. his voters are accultured now to not wearing masks or believing in the dangers of covid...they will go to their local polling place and vote for him happily, even rationalizing that if they do die, it'll be for their country. biden voters are more cautious, so we're fucked

I love you Leo!  So full of energy. Biden stinks.  TRUMP 2020. He better give you that hat.
The literally whole 2020 election game plan has been to fear monger Trump. Especially where Black people are concerns. A Blue State could have a racial situation they refuse to address and it’s “Look how’s Trump doing us going vote Biden to stop this”
Biden's son had just died, Clinton had very recently been extremely popular, had great relationships with vital Dem constituencies, and oh yeah, won the fuckin' popular vote. Baring Comey and Wikileaks, she walks to the presidency. Because she lost doesn't make it a bad choice.
You have entirely too much faith that America the organization will stop going to war and that Biden once elected will appoint good judges that will be helpful to black society. Dems want to abolish BM and we still got to vote on those other issue, nice try tho
With Trump in office Black people’s eyes are open to the racism with Kamala and Biden many of us will be sheep. Who ever wins the plans are roughly the same only with Democrats in a opposition positions they will be more willing to come to the table with tangible next cycle.
You can’t saying your not trying to let things get worst as you are campaigning for the worst option. Biden/Kamala can get more done in the form of oppressing Black society because they are positions as our “teammates”. All eyes are on Trump so it’s easier to counter his racism.
How is Biden a centrist. I love how you act like he isn’t a proven racist who if given the presidency would quadruple the amount of Black people in prison. Motherfucker already promised to increase their budget not defund or demilitarize.
How are they far worst? Can you point to any Trump policy that’s been as destructive to Black society as the Biden’s Law? You do know Kamala Harris refused to prosecute cops? Please explain how Biden/Kamala r the lesser of two evils to Black society? With words not talking points
#GiulianiMarriedHisCousin is carrying #TrumpVirus’ water and lying as usual. These are scare tactics meant to replace a plan. Trump has no plan, just like he has had no plan for the pandemic.
This the type shit Biden and company gonna be on.. I don’t wanna go to jail y’all
Purely wishful thinking. I don’t see a lot of enthusiasm for Biden but my contact with the rest of the world has been limited lately.
Biden is barely center left, you dipshits
Biden we I’ll get 90% of the Black vote, as would anyone else running against that proven racist.
Probably promised a cabinet appointment if she attacks and Biden/Harris elected.
My democratic black family are not happy about Joe Biden &amp; Harris, the only ones I see celebrating are white liberals.  The same ones who were screaming BLM a few weeks back.  These people don't care about black lives.  I love seeing others see things for what they are.
That Biden was VP in an administration that presided over a recovery from the brink of an almost depression would make this a hard sell to anyone except Trump's lowly educated fans.

Thanks for the reply. I should probably disclose I'm kind of subtweeting a group of people, and not you. I'm so irritated w/ those who keep insisting Biden will prosecute Trump when he literally keeps telling us he won't. Fantasy and projection are not helpful in any way.
🤣no, they are laughing at you not Biden.
Ukraine was manufactured and it failed. In fact it suggests Biden’s family used Air Force 2 to conduct personal business with China/Ukraine. Russia highlighted Clinton’s paid for fake intel anti get warrant from Obama’s justice dept to spy on trump team. Smart people realize this
China wants Joe Biden in the White House so they can return to ripping off our country.  We can’t let that happen.
Listen I'm on board with Mr Biden and Ms Harris but being an extreme progressive I don't expect too much. Just rid us of this disease that is currently oozing from the white house, attorney general office and sec of state. Cause if Trump   steals the election USA won't recover
If y’all don’t understand politics just say that. The way y’all ranting &amp; raving about Biden &amp; Harris got me looking at y’all like....

Obama/Biden was the worst administration ever to ignore Israel and appease the Muslim world... giving them credit can only a very sick man who wrote that script for a demented Joe

It is crystal clear what their intentions are. Biden is a weak AF candidate with dementia. It’s common sense. I also really trust 3rd party ballot harvesters.....NOT!
If there is mandatory mail in ballots it will be the most fucked up fraudulent election in history. Ballots will be tossed, forged and 3rd party operatives will pick them up. Unofficial ballots won’t be counted for half a year. They know Biden is weak AF and has dementia
Biden looked like he was going to cry
Trump is trying to cheat his way in the election by deliberately sabotaging the post office to slow down mail in ballots. A vote for Joe Biden is a #VoteForDemocracy

I dont have an agenda I just think there is a difference between rape and what biden did which is still disgusting they have very distinct definitions and misusing it weakens how bad each actually is.
The head of your party, Trojan Joe Biden, publicly declared blacks are incapable of thinking for themselves which makes them slightly worse than latinos. Looks like the Democrats are going to have to own that, don’t it?
Rape is sexual abuse yes they're in the same category but there is a difference between forcing yourself on a child and having non consensual sex and the (still disgusting things) Biden did on TV.
Priceless. Biden will ask him the same question at the debates.
Rape has a set of rules that make it rape i am not defending biden I think everything he does on camera is absolutely wrong but it 100 percent is not rape and labeling that takes away from actual instances of rape from people in power.

There are always reasons.  Bush Jr. had the 9/11 attacks, then had the housing crisis that started in 2007.  Trump has the Coronavirus pandemic.  Somehow when good Dems like Clinton and Obama are in charge, these 'reasons' are prevented/avoided.  I'll take my chances with Biden.

You can't honestly tell me that Biden is a strong candidate in comparison to guys like Clinton and Reagan. I feel like we're in a no win situation. Trump didn't kill all of those people. His delayed reaction did cost lives. I would like to see what happens from here.
The only reason why Biden has any chance is because of the virus + he's milked it and Black people aren't so high on Harris as Biden thinks. I'm not loving this election. Just because Trump is a fing liar isn't a reason to vote for a weak minded candidate ( maybe w/dementia)
Harris was friends with Beau Biden. It's getting to the point where the age for being president should be limited. Both men scare me. Harris will destroy Pence in a debate but Trump will destroy Biden. Since Harris's nomination, betting odds have moved closer to Trump.
I don't know. Harris is a sensational talker + seems to be a no-nonsense person from what I hear. It's Biden that scares me. People have little confidence that he complete an entire term ( he'll be 82! and he doesn't seem strong. Harris was a sentimental choice for him?

Good enough for me! I don't want to hear about Medicare for all nor stupid green deal. I wonder if the squad truly knows how much Obama/Biden did for the environment? Trump rolled back 85% includingThe Paris Accord. Emissions and Green were set back in 2009, I worked on ACES.
Job creation....  Obama/Biden 2013-2016: 216,000/month.   and  2017-present: MINUS-136,000/month.  Trump/Pence 2017-through-February 2020: 185,000/month  And that's while robbing the Treasury blind to redistribute to the rich.

On the day that Kamala Harris was introduced as Biden's running mate, Trump looks and sounds pathetic.
I don’t believe Biden is going to look out for the many. I believe a lot of what he says is lip service. I do think though that Harris has a lot of good going for her &amp; can evolve past some things a lot of people don’t like. I think she can do some good if she’s willing to change
Ya know what’s kind of ironic? Trump and his friends at Fox use the same attacks so often, that their predictability has taken any sting out their messaging. I feel like everyone is so over their repetitive negativity that it’s making Biden/Harris feel even fresher.

So first thing on the Biden/Harris agenda is get rid of Freedom of Speech
Two sincere, simpatico, seasoned, singular, leaders joined to offer American people, badly hurting, that there is another way. A team emerged with purpose not to destroy but to build back better. This dual introduction went a long way to  give credence to the Biden Harris credo.
