The 'they' is President Obama's administration. I believe he thought Hillary would win, but I believe she was fed to the wolves. (Steam shooting off my head!) Trump should have been arrested and tried for espionage ie stopped.
Here‚Äôs a great round up of Trump‚Äôs failed leadership- on issues not mentioned lately because we are all too busy trying to stay alive and deal with thousands of Americans dying daily because of Trump-
Thank you for a fresh take on Trump‚Äôs massive failures- economically and socially-not even counting No. 1: The Pandemic- thousands of Americans are dying who didn‚Äôt have to -
What if you and pedo Joe Biden refuse to accept 4 more years of president Trump?
Perry Stone going to explain Trump/ Cyrus similarities to you as did Trey Smith did.
Trey Smith pay attention to this one kinda bring it all together all post more later many modern Prophets say Trump was Chosen by God to be Cyrus of our time Trey will explain that part
What leadership? DeSantis must be a graduate of the Trump Academy. DUMB and DUMBER NEED TO WAKE UP!
You guys realize we are only hours away from Trump announcing, he too  is slated to be a recipient of the ‚ÄòRipple of Hope Award‚Äô for his amazing ability to mass murder Americans on a pretty much daily basis in 2020...
Trump saying people criticizing him is illegal feels familiar.... sit down john you FAT MOTHERFUCKER
Dude please. Real well is moron and said that FBI and spy AGAIN on Trump campaign.   And u asked abt Barr, well hear u go. Stop listening to politicians and media u may learn stuff  AG Barr to Nuke House Democrats: Covering Up for 'Russiagate,' Demonizing Police Featured
If you‚Äôre havin trouble figurin our whether you‚Äôre for me or for trump, then you ain‚Äôt a woman of color- Joe you know you wanna say this so bad
Next modern day Prophet is Mark Taylor prediction of Trump being President next is Trey Smith author of God in a nutshell I can go on forever. Why you think everything evil is fighting Trump and he wins cause God Almighty protection is there strong Even a second term is predicted
John Lewis said horrible things about our President and was full in on the impeachment farce. Trump is supposed to make nice?
Well let me explain to you something I know you won't understand unless you are a scholar of the Holy Bible. Trump is like Cyrus. Trump was Chosen to be President God has a job for him to do Prophets said Trump was next President as far back as 2000. Most noted one is Kim Clement
Trump isn't God Almighty you act like he is always expecting him to do everything an then blame him for everything you think is bad. Y'all are idiots üòÇ
PONZI schemes. They  are gaining financial and popularity by hating on Trump. They are getting money for lying. after Nov, we will get our pay back. But they hv to live with fact they walked out on Repubs and now support chaos, fires, bus in burning, murder, collusion and Biden.
Btw Matt. That was sarcasm. Trump sucks; Biden 2020
Trump is an all around loser. He let's Putin target his own soldiers overseas. He may as well send Vladimir a Thank You Card. Does absolutely nothing. He certainly ignores Intelligence Agents, and Health Experts, though. Leading to 147,000+ deaths. A real Menace #TrumpleThinSkin
LOL. 3 BROS, AINT WORKING!   independents moving to support the president,  That enthusiasm included some 300,000 supporters who opened their wallets last Tuesday and pumped $20 million into Trump‚Äôs campaign  This trend toward Trump is also showing up in registering new voters.
Yep GOOD TIMES!  With independents moving to support the president,  That enthusiasm included some 300,000 supporters who opened their wallets last Tuesday and pumped $20 million into Trump‚Äôs campaign  This trend toward Trump is also showing up in registering new voters.
Lol. Yeah pretty insane!  independents moving to support the president,  That enthusiasm included some 300,000 supporters who opened their wallets last Tuesday and pumped $20 million into Trump‚Äôs campaign  This trend toward Trump is also showing up in registering new voters.
It really did strike me as fishy at the time. Trump announced it so soon after the news of Fauci‚Äôs invitation. Pure Trump jealousy and narcissism. And a relief to know the Yankees didn‚Äôt actually invite him.
Trump Needed to Be Told Republicans Were Getting Sick to Take Action on Coronavirus, Report Says

Rep. Swalwell on new information showing FBI spied on Trump: ‚ÄòThey were right to do it‚Äô  Spying id illeagal. And it ain't thin skin, it's CALLED pissed off that Democrats can get away with spying.
But to come out and say Trump will lose the election if we don‚Äôt wear masks? I think he‚Äôs a Trojan horse for the deep state..
President Trump‚Äôs handling of the coronavirus pandemic put his political fate in grave jeopardy. Now he‚Äôs hoping to get credit for his administration‚Äôs aggressive push for a vaccine -‚Äì and crossing his fingers that one gets approved before Election Day.
They'll do some spin on how that is not ANTIFA, it's some sort of right wing terrorists that hijacked it, and pose themselves as ANTIFA to boost Trump's chances of re-election.
Shame on you Nicole  you knew this all along! LOL If you really want to know where Trump learned everything he knows about Covid19 just watch this episode of "The Dead Zone" Plague (TV Episode 2003) - IMDb -   It's like frickin time travel man!
I didn‚Äôt know Tricky Dick Morris was a Medical Einstein with 10 PhD‚Äôs. This asswipe just said ‚ÄúIf you want Trump to win, Wear the damn Masks‚Äù...WTF ???
Dumbest comment on twitter. Casual racism? Pointing out facts are always racist according to libtards like you. Do all libtards hate Trump so much they are willing to tear down the entire system just to avoid his re-election.
Not sure that would even break the top 25 list of Most Trump Things Ever
Time to donate to her opponent.  Fuck that shit.  You're either with us or you're not.  She just declared for Trump, as far as I'm concerned.

you‚Äôre 100% correct... The thing that gets me is Trump is in favor of continuing the UE benefits as well as another round of stimulus checks. I‚Äôm totally confused what McConnell and company are trying to accomplish.
They called and asked me for money a while back I told them would never give one penny to Republican politicians only give money to the Trump campaign.
Americans are not stupid. They know these protests and mayhem are intentional so all deaths and casualtys can be blamed on Trump. Americans know what is happening and will vote accordingly.
this is the love-child of trump and stormi daniels

President Donald Trump has been using the Rose Garden a lot more lately to make statements and hold news conferences in the age of the coronavirus. The first lady also hosted a state dinner for Australia in the garden last year.Oh let‚Äôs look at a recent example. Defense bill is also veto proof. Bipartisan. Trump HATES it. He doesn‚Äôt have to sign but it will become law. He is powerless. So will Trump take credit for removing confederate names from bases?
Really then why r u all still so butt hurt about not being able 2 put him and his enabler wife back in the WH? Also so excited about putting Biden in after 8 years of  doing nothing against Epstein? Pick a lane.Barr is a lapdog but goes after JE if it could hurt trump. Idiots
Bayou Brief: Trump Trumps Trump | First Draft
Oh really üßê  I follow things fairly closely. Trump apparently dabbled with underage girls on occasion (see palling around with Epstein, and charges filed by then 13 yo girl against him).  Quite frankly, I do not believe you. Just a made up lie for the MAGGSfolk  Links ?
I can bet you would do the same to save yourself. It‚Äôs literally obnoxious that you can‚Äôt fathom trump also being part of it- trump likes 13 year olds...weird you support that bro. Go look up the 24 women that accused him over a 30 year period.
Right On,Dump Trump,He is not a example at all,He gotta go,For all people in the USA sake,Trump has no empathy at all,Just like is racist Father Fred Sr.which whom created the monsterüëπ

Donald Trump traveling around spreading COVID one old black man at a time seems a little too scooby doo villainesque even for him. And yet ...
Why would me staying married put Trump in prison?
Trump is doing exactly zero about child sex traffickers. Remember, he wished child sex trafficker Ghislane Maxwell well. (Coded message to keep her mouth shut &amp; a pardon is coming her way after the election. Else he will have her killed like Barr did Epstein).
Like the torturing of innocent brown refugee children that Trump started ? These are REAL CHILDREN not ‚Äúunborn children‚Äù.  Being OK with Putin putting bounties on US military.  Killing 154,000 Americans with his various Pro-Death policies, and much more.
Almost forgot. Trump wanted the wall to help stop the trafficking from Mexico. Dems fought him tooth and nail.
We also have never had a President threatening to not leave. We have always had peaceful transfer of power.  Trump has made it clear, he‚Äôs not planning to do that.
I really hope this is the case but I think we are jumping to conclusions. The Trump vote is undercounted. Rasmussen polls, the same ones that showed him losing the election by two points in 2016 are showing him within 3 now. Rasmussen was actually the most accurate poll in 2016
Another one for you.   Do your own research. I did.
You read about trafficking arrests around the globe every week now  This is just the first couple of articles I found.
Im not sure he ever really left.  And I‚Äôm just really happy he seems to be here now. Trump is acting increasingly like a cornered rat.
Is Trump the second coming of false prophet Jim Jones? Thousands of Trump followers are dead today because Trump led them to destruction. Now Trump want to postpone the November election lol. I can't wait to vote against Trump.. the tooks about false prophets. Trump is here.

Trump don‚Äôt want people kneeling bro.. cause he see that‚Äôs bringing people together against his racist ass..
Trump leads thousands of his followers to death. Trump told Herman Cain wear a mask it you want to. Cain decided that he wasn't going to wear a mask because Trump wasn't wearing one. Now Mr. Cain is dead. We blame you Trump.

It will backfire severely on the Dems combined with the Barr hearing. Comparing Trump to Bull Connor?

Trump is freaked over mail-in voting. He‚Äôs trying to shut down the USPS.
A Trump donor and crony.
Trump banned Epstein and Maxwell. Trump is only person who helped the prosecutor with Epstein‚Äôs only conviction. I guess news media didn‚Äôt mention that? And Trump is the reason Maxwell is currently behind bars awaiting trial.
Oh, my bad, I thought that was a bad foul, but I didn't realize the dunk didn't go in... (telling on myself here.)  But, seriously, Trump‚Äôs American Gestapo needs to be shut down. #NBA

Trump said
When trump thought he would lose to Hillary in 2016, he said the election was rigged. When he shockingly won, we realized he was right. This time, Biden will win despite trump‚Äôs attempt to rig it again. We have learned.
I love how the media will report something President Trump has said and add that there is no evidence for his claim. I don't think I have ever heard that done so consistently before Trump - and they ONLY do it for Trump. Even Fox-News does it, as they did today on voter fraud.
No matter, in the end they will all climb aboard the trump train no matter what direction it heads.
I agree with the gloomy forecast of what may happen when Trump loses. He'll have to be dragged out of there.
Went from being surrounded by intelligent, radical, beautiful Black people to the land of Trump and Alabama state flags on lifted pickup trucks.  I hate it here.

All true. How did donnie pay his respects? Sending out a racist segregation tweet today, ruining what Sen.Lewis fought for. Trump is going straight to hell &amp; the only person that will be at his funeral is Ivanka. Is there a venue lg enough for the rest of us to throw a party?
Graves disease.
So how long before Trump attacks him on twitter and he is forced to step down form the Feferalist Society.
The entire NBA took a knee! Man y‚Äôall have to check Trump Tweets in 20 minutes üòÇ
I am sorry that you don't agree with me. I will point out that we aren't having violent protests here. We are a strong, beautiful, &amp; diverse city. Why do you think that we are giving campaign fodder to Trump?

It can be both. Trump can kill two birds with one stone. Distract from GDP report &amp; normalize the idea of a President calling for postponing the election. And people can attack liberals for taking it seriously. There‚Äôs really no downside to him doing this(there should be though).
tRump is planning a coup. What can we do? This article provides doable instructions for CHN-speaking US citizens, green card holders, and ones at different stages of immigration or simply care about justice and democracy on this land. As a bonus, 1/2

Dictator Trump  via  Yep
You wouldn‚Äôt let your staff wear masks. You were talking to the traitor Bill Barr after his hearing and you were right next to him. I pray he gets Covid-19. Trump too and the rest of the anti-mask Republicans who are responsible for the deaths of 1000s of people &amp; a bad economy.
‚ÄúWhat aboutism‚Äù is your defense of Trump‚Äôs racism ?  Trump is deeply racist. Sen Byrd has been dead for a decade - and unlike Trump renounced his racist past.
So Trump want to send kids back to school.... but want to push back #2020Election because of #COVID19
Zero chance this happens without a Trump win.
Pompeo claimed today he couldn‚Äôt answer this question either. Crooked Trump enablers, both of them.
Haven‚Äôt listened to a  speech in a while but #Trump sounds out of breath and struggling. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica

Calabresi has been quiet for too long. He is a Trump enabler and his reputation is in tatters. ‚ÄúDemocratic hyperbole?‚Äù Really?
The President was impeached because of lawlessness and corruption. Defenseless behavior which placed lives at risk. And this cat wants to weigh in now? Too late. His reputation, like the other Trump enablers, is in tatters.
I keep thinking about this and the Trump admin's rollback of Prison Rape Elimiation Act guidance and rules that put trans women at *SIGNIFICANTLY* higher risk of harm and death.
Donald Trump killed Herman Cain
Please WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS, Please, call out Donald Trump. Stop him from LYING!

Trump is a literal JOKE! I dont understand!!
You and I are the 'manager', we're Trump's boss. Come November, we're going to sack him, put him out to pasture.
Trump‚Äôs only ‚Äúwork‚Äù as president has been to enrich himself, serve Putin, emulate other dictators and satisfy his own sadistic, misogynistic, homophobic and racist beliefs. He‚Äôs betrayed the country, killed tens of thousands and grows more delusional and dangerous each day.
when has President Obama needed to take credit from tRump? please list them????????????
Trump Talking about evictions a couple days before people have to pay rent ... the level of absolute pathetic bull$hit that has been baked into this cake we‚Äôre being served is unreal

Trump? what do we need ... ?
Only 4634 people died of Coronavirus in China. The deadly virus outbreak in 1918 was named the Spanish Flu because there was so much reporting about it there... therefore COVID-19 should be called the Trump Virus. No one has had to talk about it more than Trump. #TrumpGenocide
Actually, Cain either committed suicide, or trump caused his death. And the name of the virus is  #TrumpVirus
What‚Äôs ‚ÄúPlaaaahzma‚Äù ? Trump
You've really bought into the media hysteria haven't you? The system is fucked up. Trump is bad, but he's just the logical progression after years of shit leadership. Biden continues the same.

New Orleans, LA  TRUMP 2020
Nobody wants oil rigs near Florida's beautiful beaches. But the Trump Administration still plans to drill off of Florida's Gulf Coast once the Eastern Gulf Moratorium expires in 2022. It's time to permanently ban drilling in the Eastern Gulf.
America,  Apparently, Trump never read the constitution he swore to protect....  so ignore his tweets today.
Again love preIt always will if we just let it. We can‚Äôt let our beloved democracy remain in the hands of a man so full of hate, anger &amp; bigotry that he seeks to destroy it from within bc nobody likes him. Trump doesn‚Äôt care about us or our country. He‚Äôs incapable. #VoteJoe

Just imagining Trump giving a eulogy and somehow managing to turn another person‚Äôs funeral into a rant about all his grudges.
Amazing to contrast Trump's anti-democratic talking points to with the talks to John Lewis' funeral. One group of people activity fighting to protect our democracy - to honor a man who was willing to die to for it. The other group, trying to sow seeds of doubt in our democracy.

The Trump White House after Obama‚Äôs speech.
Trump can‚Äôt change the date of the election and Calabresi knows that. He‚Äôs just a last minute escapist, getting off the Titanic before it sinks. I‚Äôm happy that he‚Äôs abandoning Trump but he can keep his flimsy justification.
Trump's tweet this AM was not surprising and I don't think we should be giving it attention. Instead, we should be talking much more about how shameful it is that he doesn't think it's a big deal that he's the only living president that didn't even attend John Lewis's funeral.
Who said anything about Trump?? Who's the paranoid one now?!? LMAO
Republicans openly challenge Trump's tweet on delaying election.  THE GOP HAD THEIR CHANCE TO RID US OF trump AND  THEY DIDN‚ÄôT...NOW WE DON‚ÄôT WANT THEM OR HIM NOW!
Watch Live: Trump to hold press conference
Truth !!  I knew Donald Trump was utter scum almost 3 decades ago, when I was a registered R &amp; he was a registered D.  BTW, Fred Trump was arrested during a KKK riot in NYC. Donald has continued his father‚Äôs racist tradition.
Our lives have been turned upside down because of Trump
All I can think about is him cheesing at the Trump rally. 1 less
Lol, everyone has a turning point, but Trump has none; no bottom.
thing is, at the end of all this there's still a good chance that trump will be responsible for fewer overall human deaths
Herman Cain no longer has value to Trump, so he will be erased.
Boy, and u think the trump years is full of racial harmony? Trump is the most racially divisive president in history.  Obama did what Lewis would have wanted him to do. Sorry if u don‚Äôt understand that
Trump is too effing ignorant to get them, someone will have to explain them to him.
When are y‚Äôall going to wake up and look around you.  Trump is killing our citizenry, our economy, our military, and now he‚Äôs trying to kill our elections
I love it, just absolutely committed to being a no-argument simp. I already scrolled up to see if there was even a kernel of anything specific and there‚Äôs nothing there. Just a formless assertion that Trump‚Äôs tweet was conjecture without any follow-up.
That was not a funeral service, that was an anti trump rally

For those out there putting down ppl not having graduated college, Bill stopped at high school.  All billionaires are not master thinkers. Most don't have common sense. That's where the hysteria began bc Trump has it all!
Trump is a profoundly evil human being is multiple ways. From treason to racism to sexual abuse to sadism and more, he is evil in every way.  Those that support him endorse his evil.  No true Christian can knowingly support such evil.  The goat Christians will drop in # soon.
what did he expect to get nasty comments? he‚Äôs a trump supporter
when did tRump say that? before or after he praised the confederate statues or said there were good people on both sides of the white nationalist murdering a protester?
Or, more akin to his petty juvenile style, deflect simply from Obama‚Äôs eloquent, touching, inspiring Lewis eulogy that made trump look extremely gd awful.
Man you really bring everything back to Trump dont you? #biasedmuch?
I‚Äôll save this tweet for the inevitable follow-up from Trump where he doubles down on wanting to delay the election.

Right now on  's site,there are 23"articles/story captions"(on top half main site).8 are about Trump, 9 are negative.Obama makes 1st appearance in a year and the headline, "Obama gets standing ovation for John Lewis eulogy".It's not about Obama or Trump- it is blatant bias!!
this is from Project Veritas. Right wing group known for making fake videos. I hate trump too but it's clear why they used a video of him in a mask so they could do the voiceover of him saying anything. Surprised they did it to trump tho and not Biden.
Needs to be one speaking to those who listen or are tempted to listen to Trump. Sounds like a  charge...
He‚Äôs dead because of his loyalty to the crazy GOP party and ignorant Trump outweighed common sense to protect his own health!
I  had tears coming out of my eyes today when I read all anti trump people writing that Herman's death was caused by us.
how in the he‚Äôll you‚Äôre in office with your criminal record!  I forgot your criminal impeached Trump have you a pass. Georgia do better!

Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election  #SmartNews
Informed all on FB if you support trump unfriend me now !
You must be delirious. Trump has brought the USA down to third world status in a free fall. He is NOT A LEADER AND NEVER WILL BE!
Didn‚Äôt you just write an op ed about how ridiculous it was that Biden said Trump would do this?   How is the media so ignorant about Trump? Everybody schmuck who has been paying attention knew with 100% certainty that Trump would be floating the idea of delaying the election.
I imagine a lot of rank &amp; file grunts are Trumpers, but the Pentagon brass despise him. Their order to forbid the Confederate flag at all military installations was widely interpreted as a message to Trump that they are not behind him, &amp; would not support him in that event.
So we gone act like Trump hasn‚Äôt said anything racist and did cause thousand of Americans their lives and hasn‚Äôt had sexual assault cases?
He might, but not because he is Biden.   Democrats could have run a wooden chair for president, and they would have voted for it only because it wasn‚Äôt trump.

I'm absolutely ready. Just remember when we're throwing Trump's fat ass out of the White House, lift with your legs not your back.

Here is Trump‚Äôs budget. Line G is the program that Adams has to rewrite ($85M). As you can see there is a $0 for FY20. You can‚Äôt try to kill something then take credit for it living.
Personal benefits?? I‚Äôd give both a kidney and a lung to not have any more trump appointed federal judges. It sounds like you don‚Äôt like Adrian and that‚Äôs ok. But he is still our best chance to have a senator who is a democrat.
Trump would get blasted for weeks if he did this. #DoubleStandard
This week Trump urged all states to open up, but voting needs to be postponed in November? He's insane.
Everyone uses this article but it doesn‚Äôt mention that in the FY20 budget, Trump zeroed out the program. Alma Adams &amp; Doug Jones pushes Congress but it ended. Adams wrote the new bill which passed both houses in a veto proof majority; signature was performative.
Shame on you, CNN. You just could not wait to break away from coverage of John Lewis' funeral to cover the demented, narcissistic, asinine, daily childishness of Donald Trump. It's extremely foolish to be manipulated by him. #ByeBye
Opinion | Americans are suffering. Trump offers them a doctor who warns of sex with demons.
How many people who attend the Trump Rally on June 20th have since come down with Covid-19?

Incidently, Trump Admin never did stop kidnapping little kids. It‚Äôs just done secretively. It‚Äôs just come out that the crimes continue. Be an grown up and read the newspaper.   If you voted for this monster, that‚Äôs on you.
No one is celebrating Hermain Cain‚Äôs death but it‚Äôs important to note it, because these semi-prominent followers of Trump‚Äôs dangerous ideology are getting people killed every day. Hopefully people who learn of his death can be persuaded to begin to believe the science.
Any company or anything Trump supports, i know not to fw it. That means those people are just like him.

Don‚Äôt argue from a place of ignorance, especially when defending sociopathic monsters like Trump and his immigration policy Renfeild, Steven Miller. What they‚Äôve done is Crimes Against Humanity, cell in The Hague stuff. Obama did nothing vaguely like that.

Herman Cain is dead because he drank Donald Trump‚Äôs Koolaid.
The election will not be delayed nor will it be by mail in ballot and Trump will win again. Liberals are looney tunes.
Trump's priorities have him promoting quacks who link the virus to demon sperm.
Already here. Why pay to keep women and children or anybody in long term detention? Trump put children in those cages, overcrowding them and keeping them long term separated from family.  Adult men in a holding cell is not children caged long term.  Apples and oranges.
The list of things Trump couldn't do but has now done reaches from here to outer space. So I take no comfort in knowing he "can't" delay the election.
No pardon from Trump after January 2021...
I don‚Äôt want any both ways. I want you nasty racists to look at the complete picture instead of your child‚Äôs veiw of everything.  With Trump, cruelty is the point. He is a sociopath and sadistic. No normal person could think of the brutal stuff done at the border.
I didn't think it was that bad - i thought it was almost rhetorical...  but Trump knew exactly what he was doing and here we go

Donald Trump has capitulated to China over and over.
There is no aspect of being a sick asshole that you haven‚Äôt engaged in. Using the death of Herman Cain to trash President Trump is truly beyond the pale.
TRUTH IS SETTING IN  Trump said it's "curious" that Dr. Anthony Fauci &amp; Dr. Deborah Birx enjoy high approval ratings as it relates to their handling of COVID-19 while he does not. "They're highly thought of but nobody likes me," laments Trump.
Just realized that Trump and Biden are older than every living president except Jimmy Carter.

I‚Äôm still dying off the fact that they had their own colored section at a Trump rally
Really don't need no light to see through trump.
There are 150,000+ dead Americans due to a virus that Trump said would disappear &amp; was under control. More deaths than in all the wars/conflicts the US has been in since WW2. Wake your butts up ppl. Trump is incompetent &amp; killing us
Don‚Äôt be distracted by talk of moving the election. The GDP is down 30%. Hundreds of thousands are dying from COVID. Trump must be held to account.
I suggest that you not block them unless they are hostile. Your posts may have some small effect on someone who otherwise would vote for Trump. Of course if they are belligerent, misogynistic, narcissistic, feeble-minded sociopaths (like our president), I'd suggest block away!
Does she still believe that she talks to trump several times a day?
U have to be a heartless person not to see that Ana (a staunch conservative) is right. These ppl did not believe in doctor or expert recommendations. They listened to &amp; tried to pls Trump. Now they are dead or ill. See the pattern here?
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
tRump is suppose to lead in times like these but what does he do? He fires the pandemic response team and says the virus is a hoax. this is he fault. but also Cains fault for not taking his own health serious enough to put on a mask and listening to the CDC.

2020 Election Live Updates: Republicans Reject Trump‚Äôs Suggestion to Delay Election, Something He Cannot Do - The New York Times
It‚Äôs an absolute truth. And if a Democrat was in the White House up for re-election you would be saying the same thing Trump is saying.  Everyone can vote in person and be safe.
Trump supporters are constantly projecting. Your president does something unbelievably reckless and irresponsible and all you have to say is "sometimes people on the left are that bad".
Do you think, for a second, all this talk of Constitutionality means anything to Trump?  It's quite clear the Constitution is not his concern. What will stop him?
Neither Trump nor Barr (nor you) decide when we will have elections. This is not your fiefdom to run ramshackle over.
No comfort in this.
It‚Äôs difficult to take you seriously on anything that isn‚Äôt trump trump trump.  That‚Äôs why I shall be voting for  and sending you packing in November.

If vote-by-mail ends up hurting the GOP, despite it not doing that in the states who have it, whose fault is that? It's Trump's fault for lying so much about it to everyone that it alters the number of Republicans who do it. This is why the GOP should be defending vote-by-mail.
Which is exactly what Trump wanted
Did I see Clinton commemorate John Lewis before trump ? Did I miss that
Mostly younger people attended the protest. Maybe they were asymptomatic. Older people attended the trump rally. Can‚Äôt prove one contributed and the other didn‚Äôt without testing and contact tracing. You can‚Äôt have cases without TESTING!
Trump had potential and opportunity, but had no moral center, no vision for what "winning" looked like.  So, he picked twitter spats at a time when the nation needed a leader.  It's time to turn the page on this disaster.
Was the music guy subtweeting Trump with that song?
Nope. Remember Trump WANTS the kids back in school.  He wants people to also go out to vote. Biden and his people want the kids to STAY home and they want us to stay home and vote from home.
I grew up in Texas around people I considered to be good people. Many of them are conservatives and Christians (I am neither) - and I challenge any person who calls themselves a ‚Äúconservative‚Äù to explain how Trump, his policies, or behavior aligns with any of that.

This is tragic. Supporting Trump can literally get you killed. He tested positive nine days after the Tulsa rally.
Could say the same thing about Trump considering he didn‚Äôt get the popular vote.
By now the media and viewers should know that Trump gets the bulk of his research and reading from Twitter. Anything he sees on Twitter that he believes he can manipulate in his favor by way of distraction and division he grabs on to. Folks keep your eyes on the prize. Vote. Vote

The Trump administration has said publicly that its goal is to privatize the USPS. They are very open about their desire to kill the agency, so it is not surprising that instead of actually fixing it they would take measures to erode its popularity.
He really went to a trump rally knowing he was high risk for the virus that's wild as hell to me
Trump said we finna enter a dictatorship and y‚Äôall not listening!
Right? I am not worried about Trump LEGALLY undermining the election.

That's the bigger problem that people are missing. Getting Trump out of office won't be the quick fix most people think it will be.
Unfortunately, the Constitution no longer matters. Trump will sign an executive order making himself president until another one is elected, which won't ever happen. Congress and the Supreme Court will do absolutely nothing about it.

President Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
Interesting that Trump proves the point of the left instead of his own in this video.   Did this news station receive a single fraudulent vote in their experiment? No. But they did experience voter disenfranchisement, which is how republicans win elections.
...but I don‚Äôt think that Nancy Pelosi wants to be President. The 20th Amendment mandates that the current President‚Äôs term ends at noon on Jan. 20, no matter WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN ELECTION OR NOT. Pence and Trump would be removed and the Speaker of the House is 3rd in line.
This is now the third time on this thread (about Cedric Richmond and Richard Barr) in which you have invoked Trump. Trump lives rent-free in your (collective) minds. Your day is affected by his every tweet. Trump has nothing to do with my day-to-day life. No politician does.
We should honestly vote right now considering how much of this country Trump has killed
Ummm... the President doesn't have the ability to delay the election, and you know he will never concede. Whoever wins in November we're screwed, either way Trump won't leave office without a full blown Constitutional crisis and probably bloodshed. 2020 saving the worst for last
Trump gonna throw a extra couple hundred and stop the checks right before voting time and say vote for me if you want more
Trump knows he‚Äôs gonna lose, no matter when the election is held, who votes, or how they vote.  This is nothing more than an admission of that inevitability. So this is not about delaying it to a more opportune time. It‚Äôs about declaring the outcome fraudulent in advance.
Trump weighs close to 300lbs. Just saying.
Trump is capable of anything but cracking up like this 3 months before the election is a disaster for his campaign. He's admitting he's losing and his desperation and instability incentivizes the establishment to cut him loose.

Trump holds a grudge.  In the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Donald Trump, his father and Trump Management, alleging the Trumps engaged in housing discrimination.   Fast forward 2020 DJT tweet.  Same as he ever was: racist
But do you really think that ones who say it works have a political agenda, or that it really works for the people they treated. The left doesn‚Äôt want it to work because it would bring this virus to a halt  and President Trump touts it.

You do realize Trump and a large number of his staff vote by mail, right? It‚Äôs a thing that happens. Many states use it. Louisiana has early voting so we don‚Äôt all have to stand in lines for hours on Election Day if we choose not to.
You would quit Twitter if Trump lost? A) I‚Äôm not putting that in the hands of strangers. B) Part of my job is social media, so I kinda have to pass on that.   I do not believe he will win. I‚Äôd classify him as the underdog. But stranger things have happened.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to November‚Äôs presidential election. The president is also making allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
Mail in voting is absentee voting, updated. It‚Äôs been used for a very long time. No problems. Trump is afraid Democrats May mail vote in substantial numbers and kick his ass back to 5th Avenue. Start packing.

Trump Campaign associates failed to report any of the Russian/WikiLeaks overtures to fed law enforcement, publicly denied any contacts with Russians/WikiLeaks, and encouraged the public to doubt that Russia was behind the hacking and distribution of stolen emails.
Michael Cohen, on behalf of the Trump Organization, brokered a secret deal for a Trump Tower Moscow project directly involving Putin‚Äôs inner circle, at least until June 2016.
Trump requested campaign affiliates to get Clinton‚Äôs emails, which resulted in an individual apparently acting in coordination with the Campaign claiming to have successfully contacted Russian hackers.
Russian military hackers may have followed Trump‚Äôs July 27, 2016 public statement ‚ÄúRussia if you‚Äôre listening ‚Ä¶‚Äù within hours by targeting Clinton‚Äôs personal office for the first time.
Donald Trump Jr. told the Russians during the meeting that Trump could revisit the issue of the Magnitsky Act if elected.
Trump Tower meeting: (1) On receiving an email offering derogatory information on Clinton coming from a Russian government official, Donald Trump Jr. ‚Äúappears to have accepted that offer;‚Äù (2) members of the Campaign discussed the Trump Tower meeting beforehand
Trump Campaign chairman Manafort expected Trump‚Äôs winning the presidency would mean Deripaska would want to use Manafort to advance Deripaska‚Äôs interests in the United States and elsewhere.
The Trump Campaign chairman periodically shared internal polling data with the Russian spy with the expectation it would be shared with Putin-linked oligarch, Oleg Deripaska.
The Trump Campaign chairman and deputy chairman (Paul Manafort and Rick Gates) knowingly shared internal polling data and information on battleground states with a Russian spy; and the Campaign chairman worked with the Russian spy on a pro-Russia ‚Äúpeace‚Äù plan for Ukraine.
1. Trump was receptive to a Campaign national security adviser‚Äôs (George Papadopoulos) pursuit of a back channel to Putin.
The redacted Mueller Report documents a series of activities that show strong evidence of collusion. Or, more precisely, it provides significant evidence that Trump Campaign coordinated with, cooperated with, encouraged, or gave support to Russian interference activities.
Then the only reason for the "hearing" was to have a prop to scold and yell at. They could have used a cardboard cutout. This was not a hearing. It was a grandstanding platform to appease the liberal constituents who want to see their reps "give it to" the Trump administration.

There was only one irrrgularity for the fisa warrants. There are many that were fine. You know that you are reaching with the Biden issue. It was already determined he has done nothing wrong. And you know trump colludes, he is still doing it.
Mueller said he did not evaluate ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù with the Russian government. ‚ÄúThe president was not exculpated for the acts that he allegedly committed,‚Äù Mueller told the House judiciary committee, adding that Trump could theoretically be indicted after he leaves office.
This is what I don't get. Let's say you're all in on republican. Then you see this kind of answer. What's being said without being said is, we know Trump got Russian help, so he can't come out and automatically say "yes it's wrong" why would you still support that.
Because Fauci is a medical doctor and Trump didnt listen to him. During a pandemic. Not exactly a question for the ages.

And how did he do that? We're waiting because he REFUSED to do what he"promised" to do. Remember that? Oh, forgot that already. Sure, sure,.. just like Mexico was going to pay for his vanity wall, right? Tick tock Trump, tick tock. I hope he first rots in prison then in HELL.

Trump KILLED GOD.
The Corona Virus is about to get far worse. The amount of damage done by the #Hydroxychloroquine crap yesterday is amazing to watch.  Millions of right winger now believe if they get sick there is a miracle cure because Donald Trump and the Right wing media pushed it so hard.
And just to add, Fauci never said the drugged worked. He said it looked promising but was too early to tell. Testing needed to be done to know for sure. You know, back when everyone was all, "But Trump said!"

This happened in 2016 as well. I remember it well. They  even had the NERVE to argue with me the day AFTER the election. "Well, no I didn't vote, but my mom/dad did for Trump". I wanted to WRING their scrawy PRIVILEGED little necks. "Nothing will change" Don't live there anymore.
Exactly. Magats "try", and I emphasize TRY to throw kids in the mix. It's ludicrous. Trump uses children as he uses adults. How MANY has he KILLED at the border? How many has put in harm's way by NOT following thru on his gun control "promise"? Now sending them to their deaths.
I agree that your lack of Covid/Trump references is a definite plus for this script.  But, I'm not sure most audiences are going to get all of your deep-cut references to Tusk era Fleetwood Mac.
I know a bit of both.  Biden? Well let‚Äôs see, I have always personally liked him. I think he‚Äôs honest. I don‚Äôt see in him the cultish autocratic populist Trump embodies. The only thing Trump and I agree is Iraq. So this:
Oh I agree with that. Trump and his band of proud boys love to do just that. Then, they send his Gestapo in. It's dispicable.

Yeah don't turn this around. You are making a big deal over a supposed "outbreak" in Tulsa because of the Trump rally and ignoring the "outbreaks" at protests and rallies. Not wearing a mask doesn't make a person stupid or idiotic. Many masks were being worn at both gatherings!
WTF difference does it make if a person is "high profile" or not. They are people nonetheless and you're only making a big deal out of Caine because you think he got it a Trump rally. The mayor of Atlanta tested positive after attending a protest.

Trump literally did away with Obama administration‚Äôs playbook on pandemic and failed to do the bare minimum in preventing It from roaring into a fire in The US while continuously down playing it.
I‚Äôm not sure why people are okay with Trump leveraging Ukraine for supposed dirt on Biden.
But if we‚Äôre comparing shit sandwiches, you‚Äôre gonna have to draw up all the bullshit Trump has done or denied or straight up lied about to save face politically. At the very LEAST Biden has the common sense not to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, nix a pandemic plan,
Do you feel that it‚Äôs an error on Trump‚Äôs part to send Federal Police to Portland?
I think A) Biden has played nice with separatists back in the day and has not  followed through with promises to protect groups of folks who deserve protection, and B) Biden is now set up to pass progressive policies on key issues that Trump has failed to acknowledge as issues.

Joe Biden is a lackluster politician but he stands mountains higher than anyone else in question here in terms of ethics. He‚Äôs also the only viable option in replacing Trump and so, the only one actually worth scrutinizing. He undeniably the better choice for President. IMO.
He's here to fix the problem, by sending in Federal Troops, for Law and Order Trump will not face up to anything, it's always someone else fault, but he's going to fix it You can't FIX STUPID !!!

Trump is a true President too if you voted for him or not.  He was elected just like Obama.  I even voted for Obana the first time because I thought he was different. I was wrong. I am now called a racist because I voted for Trump and will do so again.

Has Trump said anything about #HermanCain dying? Probably not because he doesn't care.
Trump is gonna win again ON NOVEMBER 3RD! Biden won't concede though and will claim voter suppression. In the end you will all be crying just like you did in 2016 because you're a bunch of babies!
I think Herman Cain belongs alongside Sarah Palin in the pantheon of not serious candidates for high office who over the years helped Trump see the precise triangulation of attitude and issues to pull off the ultimate grift
Yeah don't turn this around. You are making a big deal over a supposed "outbreak" in Tulsa because of the Trump rally and ignoring the "outbreaks" at protests and rallies. Not wearing a mask doesn't make a person stupid or idiotic. Many masks were being worn at both gatherings!
WTF difference does it make if a person is "high profile" or not. They are people nonetheless and you're only making a big deal out of Caine because you think he got it a Trump rally. The mayor of Atlanta tested positive after attending a protest.
Makes one wonder what Putin and Maxwell have in common with tRump? Birds of a feather...
Its not a distraction. THe economy is no longer abysmal. The GDP is from April through June. THe economy was shutdown. I support Trump. I do not support delaying the election. He isn't going to try to delay the election. You just love getting trolled!

After that court ruled against oregon, I am concerned that trump's goons will now attack other democratic cities in stated he has no chance to win. Maybe NY is exception bc he is scared of cuomo
When I try to tell magas here that # of covid cases is just unforgivable, they say that the numbers have been skewed. That is lower as people with cancers heart attacks, strokes r being deemed covid vics. There is NOTHING u can say to them to dissuade them from their trump love
Seems that new campaign manager advised to wh dr to get him off adderall and on benzo sedative such as xanax or atavan. Thus the " calmer, nicer fake trump."

I think trump knows exactly what he‚Äôs doing. He radicalizing and weaponizing his followers. It‚Äôs horrifying to me to see my family and loved ones turned so hateful and full of a lust for violence towards the other side. It‚Äôs like their only goal is to hurt democrats and liberals
with how viciously corrupt his cronies are that can affect the election should Biden accept if he loses? We all know Trump will steal this election. It‚Äôs a known fact that even he knows we know. What happens then? What‚Äôs important is who is the military loyal to?
Ryan, Bernie's not running for POTUS in 2020 and Bernie's endorsing Joe Biden for POTUS in 2020. Only choices left for a socialist in 2020 - other than Joe Biden for POTUS - are Donald Trump and a write in choice for POTUS which is a vote for Donald Trump, as well.

Cohen will be able to write his book, which I understand he wants released well before election. I recall he did say he had much more information when he testified. Trump is afraid of this book, so they tried unsuccessfully to keep in secure custody
I am noting this new campaign manager is unfortunately " creating a more subdued, sober, calm" trump.

Chris Ruddy drank the Trump kool-aid. He‚Äôs delusional. To say Trump has done a great job. WTF? Thank you for trying to set him straight. Chris Ruddy is completely wrong. Get him off the camera.
Obama was presidential. Even had he never held public office, his qualities would still be evident. tRump knows that he has only deficits, and can never even hope to rise to Obama's level.

Part of me is horrified at the thought of Trump disputing the election. The other part is intrigued by the thought of US marshals dragging him out of the WH in handcuffs on Jan. 20 and tossing him into the nearest dumpster.

This take is just as bad as Trump.   Embarrassing.
Let's be real; if Lincoln, Reagan, Nixon came back and saw what trump has done to their party........ Not a single former GOP President, VP, or GOP presidential nominee came to trump's 1st convention. I don't think that EVER happened before, even with the Whig partyü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
I know. But there's one thing I am longing for: a crushing defeat for Trump. It won't matter how much he whines or cries if we stomp him hard enough.
Every time Trump tweets something harmful or ridiculous someone in his administration says he was just kidding!
Things change, trump USED to be slim and fit like Biden..........
It's what Lewis dedicated his life to, so it was quite appropriate. In the same way you would expect hookers, porn stars, and mobsters to eulogize Trump and talk about their common interests and passions.
in truth, propagandists like hannity and pompeo and the traitors they serve, like donald trump - are THE threat to the USA.  why aren't YOU in gitmo yet, sean?

The fact that Trump and his crew didn't renew the Voting Rights Act should scare you if you are a true American patriot.   Everyone should have the right to vote.

Trump wouldn‚Äôt even go pay his respects to John Lewis.  Meanwhile, Former POTUS W eulogized.  John Lewis was a civil rights fighter and a hero, it says a lot about a person who refuses to attend his memorial.
It has nothing to do with Trump leaving peacefully. That's an opportunistic statement. It's about wanting to make sure the election isn't stolen by fraud. It's about protecting our country and the American people.

Absolutely. A lot of folks fail to realize that the Dem party, in world politics, would literally be considered right-wing, and in some cases, far-right. Trump went mask off since the protests started and went full fascist.  Now Dems are trying to appeal to those supporters.
If I were a school superintendent in some deep-red county in middle America who knows it's not safe to return to in-person classes, Trump's postponing-the-election tweet just gave me some incredible cover to cancel the school year.

Leave you have created more racism and a most serious financial problem for the USA then ever  have added trillion and trillions of dollars too our debt, bringing the USA to the threshold of a Trump Bankruptcy.  You have created "The Trump Virus Pandemic".
that is what  says.  Since trump had you tested, it's his fault that you have rona.
I would much rather be under trump than biden
I think many people have been saying that for years now.  Right,      Trump &amp; his cronies are the best thing that's grassland to Russia in decades.  Like #LobbyistChad #CoverUpGeneralBarr &amp; #CruellaDeVos to name but three.

Trump, and most of his staff, voted this week, by mail.
If you were really sick and your only two choices for medical advice were trump and Fauci. Who would you choose? Maybe that is why.
Keep spreading the word.  We need to decide what meds we want to take.  Should be between dr and patient not the big pharm or Dr Fauci.  Pres Trump needs to allow this.
President Trump suggests postponing November's elections citing issues with universal mail-in voting. Calls the 2020 elections most inaccurate and fraudulent in history.
The First Amendment and the USA Constitution were nullified, WHEN KILLARY LOST AND DONALD J TRUMP WON IN 2016.

Cannot wait to see libs and neocons to get angry about Trump taking troops out of Germany as if the Cold War didn't ended decades ago and that all of it is just a giant scam coming from the military industrial complex.

He's a 'race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot', is what, Lindsey Graham said. "Textbook racist ", is what Paul Ryan called what trump said about a Mexican-American judge. "He's a fvcking moron", is what his Secretary of State said about him. Maybe nobody likes trump!

You‚Äôve got to be kidding. This is a typical republican. This is why I‚Äôm happy Trump isn‚Äôt typical. Trumps intentions are way beyond the idea of government housing. Get everyone working for great pay by bringing manufacturing back.
He wants the FBI to spend twice as much for a smaller building down the street from his hotel. To keep a competitor from getting the building like he illegally got the old post office building for his hotel. trump grifts, we die!
Seriously, 150,000 have died from COVID-19,  30 million may be evicted from their homes soon. The $600 extra benefit people need is about to expire. What's the one thing trump wants in the bill?

It just occurred to me that Trump uses twitter an awful lot but he definitely doesn't read the replies. I think if he did he would just rage quit the internet.
The response really just writes itself: "Susan Collins has had just one priority for years: pretending to be "concerned" as Trump burns the country down. Time for her to step aside and let someone with better priorities do the job."

I‚Äôm not going to say Trump is squeaky, but the corporate GOP heavily resisted Trump and he still won. Contrast with DNC, who threw the primary twice for corporate candidates instead of giving Bernie and his supporters a fair shot.  If you hate Trump, I pray you vote 3rd party.
By then we'll he a decade into Trump Jr's reign.  #MAGA
Trump isn‚Äôt business as usual. He‚Äôs got lots of problems, and a lot of the same BS that establishment phonies have, but he has a pinch of libertarian anti war populist that makes him better than the corporate puppets we‚Äôve had for half a century or more.
Due to Trump telling the post office to slow the mail down, your jewelry orders may take longer to get to you--I ship with priority mail express 2-3 day shipping (you pay $9.99 per package) but I've been having customers tell me their packages are slow. I'm sorry for that :(

Biden will resist social change and allow interventionism. Contrast with Trump pulling out of Germany to the chagrin of the establishment.  Didn‚Äôt the DNC/Biden have primaries during the peak of COVID?
Trump ran on ending wars and has done better in 4 years than Obama in 8. Read we were pulling out of Germany. GOP/DNC hate it, so you know it‚Äôs the right move. If Tulsi is in a cabinet, I‚Äôm more likely to vote for that team.

Was this the topic of Trump‚Äôs phone call with Putin?
Because it's how I feel. I've seen so much hate from the conservative far right who believe Trump is Jesus.   Of course, many of those who voted Trump in 2016 only did so because they felt they had no choice. But those who spread hate really hurt our country.
We gotta vote Trump outta there.
It‚Äôs ‚Äûmission accomplished‚Äú anyway. They got the footage for Trump‚Äòs campaign ads. It was never about anything else.

Trump should be held criminally responsible for many of the Covid 19 death, he has created the worlds worst response too this pandemic and refuses to understand what the science Doctors say. He should be arrested and jailed immediately.

Trump is not only a disgrace as a human being he also is a cruel in your face presentation of someone who does not care about most American.

Did Trump ever say anything about the passing of Rep. John Lewis?
Trump that is a good tweet. I hate on your tweets when you say ridicolous things. BUT, I will support you if you do the right thing.
Whatever. Sick Dems. Sick Reps. Two sides of the same sick coin. And Trump is the sickest of them all... claiming to "drain the swamp" and then doing the exact opposite.
Trump you sounded defeated today. Tomorrow is Friday and the last day of the month. A perfect day to resign.
Not all Americans, just the ones listening to Trump.
I believe it's my civic duty to hold our elected officials accountable for their actions (or lack thereof). You only see what Trump tells you to see... what's the difference?
Wrong. He does not have the right unless Congress says he has. States declaring a state of emergency or Trump declaring a national state of emergency still does not give him the authority to declare martial law on his own. BTW, I don't have a "team."
150,000 and counting. tRump is still golfing, campaigning &amp; throwing out conspiracy theories. What he‚Äôs NOT doing is leading. He gives mixed messages regarding health and his supporters believe him. Hence, the USA has the highest death toll on the PLANET.
The "federal" people he deployed in Portland were unmarked... I've not heard what area of federal law enforcement they were from. If they were soldiers, then Trump already violated the Posse Comitatus Act which prohibits the use of the military for law enforcement.
Trump has absolutely no basis for declaring nationwide martial law, and it still doesn't mean he can postpone the election (especially when he himself is touting it's safe to go back to school).
If Trump tried to declare martial law and postpone the election, he'd basically be declaring himself a dictator and destroying the Republic. If you support that, you might as well pack up and move to Russia... that's where you belong. Once again, your "facts" are incorrect.

If you're a Republican and not a Trump supporter, you're called a RINO even if you still support the Republican platform...  Makes no sense.
This "Trump is joking" bit is getting tiresome. Yes, it's so damn funny that the sitting president wants to tweet about acting like an authorization. So damned funny.
Yea, that sounds like misinformation posted on Trump's campaign website.
What evidence is the basis of your concern? Oh, right, because Trump has directed you to be concerned. Lapdog.
I disagree. Supporting the Republican platform and blind "loyalty" to Trump are two very different things. Tying oneself to Trump or riding on his coattails because he's popular with some groups is a very different decision. The Republican party is not the "Trump party."
There‚Äôs a special place in hell for Donald trump and the rest of the political people lol they only care about themselves and only pretend to care about others
The reason this holds no water is, just like all of their other recommendations, is all about beating Trump....and not the best interest of the American people. If someone wants to be registered to vote, they need to get up and do it themselves.
With no evidence of mail-in voter fraud, Trump is desperately grabbing at straws hoping something will boost his failing campaign. It's not working.
Trump is "pullin' a Putin"

CNN and MNBC are not in the same boat as Breitbart, CBN, or a lot of fake news sources.  CNN Commentators and Opinion people will share their views, and let you know that they think Trump has to go.  That's different from lying, that's a difference of opinion.
And it is Trump's fault. You forgot to say that Alyssa.
So you think they should just ban Trump, Jr. and the other people that don't adhere to the terms of service?
Or, would you be like "What a jerk" ;-P  If Trump donates the equivalent he makes by inviting one person to lunch - a few times a year, then it's nothing to brag about.
Goddamn you  and being right about everything Trump since 2015.
Oh my!  The President was holding hands with his wife??  The Outrage! The Horror! You'd never see Trump do anything like that!
I'm offended by a lot of what Trump does and says. And I'm disappointed by the fact that he's President at all.  I'm not offended that he flies in Air Force One, because he is President, as much as we wish he wasn't, and that's what it is for.
Here, this one lists it:    Each one on the list, I'm assuming, gets $100,000.   So, one guest at the dinner table's worth for Trump.

The difference between you &amp; I is that I will sign anything agreeing to that lie if the kids get released today. Hell, I‚Äôll agree that trump is the messiah like he claims, if they are released today. It‚Äôs not about politics for me. It‚Äôs about freeing kids from cages.
No but they brought bricks to the protest and hit my sister who was protesting bruh! I don‚Äôt like trump either but there needs to be no violence. I have ZERO tolerance for that crap from either side!
Awesome, I'm sorry I missed it too, I was just taking a chance of trying to sway a vote..  Trump 2020...
At first I thought Trump was just stupid. Then I thought demented. Now I see he‚Äôs clearly INSANE.
Amazing how they lie with a straight face &amp; that is exactly what the news media is showing the public.unless you watch things for yourself you will never know the truth. I made up my mind to vote for Trump, too much Demo deceit.
How can you possibly say she‚Äôs doing great.  She was a down right disrespectful bitch to Mr. Barr &amp; he did not deserve that treatment.  If anything, I think she is helping Trump get re elected.  Thank you Dean.  Trump 2020!
"Trump, conversely, has not officially committed to the scheduled debates. Instead, his campaign has been seeking changes to the debate schedule, and, according to the New York Times, wants an unusual role in selecting the moderators."
"Biden has officially committed to participating in the three scheduled presidential debates -- and Biden has repeatedly said he is eager to debate Trump even if the pandemic forces them to hold the event online rather than in person."
It may be the fact that you're awesome, and a good person with a heart and empathy.  Trump would never think of such a thing.
Traitor Trump is a lapdog for Putin. He will do whatever Putin wants.

If Trump came up with a vaccine I would stay far far away because the knowledge of how to do that isn't inherited from your uncle.
Donald Trump is not a HIGH functioning sociopath.   Donald is a LOW functioning sociopath. With money.
My dad is just dumbfounded as to how his siblings can still support Trump. I am dumbfounded how my friends can still support Trump.   I know what you mean. Trump needs to go.
Failure to lead is not good enough. Say exactly what Trump failed to do in this pandemic. Not enough PPE, not declaring a state of emergency, not issuing mandates to quickly build enough ventilators, not stockpiling face masks for medical staff
There are more photos with  trump and maxwell than with Barron and his ‚Äú dad (ish)!!
He knows.  He is just trying another tactic.  I highly recommend Mary Trumps book on Trump and his family.

Two words, trump and Maxwel/ Epstein, NOW THATS CREEPY!
How can they accuse him of anything? He couldn't get a word in edge wise.
All you all ever want to do is spend our money investigating.  People who throw objects at police officers are not peaceful protesters.The problem is your hate for President Trump is greater than your love for America and therefore you all will do anything to destroy America.
who does Barr work for? The people of the USA or Trump?
The little people are seriously in trouble.  Other countries took care of their people.  This is a definite way for Trump to lose which is good but at a terrible cost of bills not being paid.  We are creating more debt by the day.  People won‚Äôt be able to take this much longer!
We have local task force working on a pvt/public angle. I don‚Äôt think anyone believes Trump replaces it.
BS how that‚Äôs possible AD Barr told Jerry Nadler, Andy Schiff, Pelosi  been saying 3 years Ex FBI Peter Strzok find no evidence against Russia Collusion against President Trump! Ukraine, impeachment 4 years Zip! Democratic Congress broke dam laws! Joe Biden was involved Ukraine!

Peter Strzok investigates against Trump‚Äôs campaign, no evidence Russia, Ukraine, impeachment NONE! Nadler, Schiff, Pelosi Democratic Congress should be in jail for prejudice, perjury!! Should apologize to President Trump!
Ah, so the pharmaceutical companies are the culprit, not the anti-Trump, leftist communists!

Trump didn't arrest anyone. The FBI did. You remember, the FBI that Trump hates? This has been an ongoing federal investigation since 2008.
The Trump admin has also produced the largest backlog of pending T-visa applications - the special visa created by the TVPA for immigrant trafficking survivors - along with the highest number of denials in the history of the program and the lowest number of approvals in 10 yrs.
The fact is most anti-trafficking groups criticize Trump administration, saying it has abandoned actual survivors of trafficking when they need any sort of immigration relief.
Stop giving Trump exclusive credit for stuff that's been done for the last 20 years. Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act in 2000.
Epstein was first investigated &amp; eventually arrested in 2005. Case was shut down by Alexander Acosta (served as Trump's Secretary of Labor for 2 years) &amp; was negotiated by Alan Dershowitz (one of Trump's attorneys). So many connections. Maybe Trump should have been indicted too?
I've long said I'd vote for a potted plant than Trump, so Biden and a rock sounds even better than that.
I think for a lot of Republicans, if they want to save their party, they should vote Blue up and down the ticket in November.  They need to point out that the direction Trump is leading them is wrong, and that's the best way to do it.
Barr started and reminded that he is looking forward to retiring because he knows he may be in trouble once Trump is gone.
Trump is an issue. Period.
Trump is an issue. Period.
You mean like how he doesn't read Trump's tweets, but he knows what time which tweets were posted?
Have all of Trump's favorite doctors received their medical degrees from Trump University?
As okay as you are with Trump hugging Jeffrey Epstein.
So your defense of Trump spreading information is that the media also does it? (Ever hear the saying, "Two wrongs don't make a right"?) If it's wrong for the media, then it's wrong for Trump, correct? Otherwise, you're saying there's a double standard.
Criticism for his incompetency and holding him accountable is not defamation. If it were legal defamation, Trump would sue. Provide examples of the "blatant lies," please.
I only heard one.  Trump didn't literally say inject bleach, he just said something that lead some people to believe he thought that would be a good idea.
Unless he was running against Trump.
What‚Äôs wrong with President Trump is helping our country, USA better future than President Obama‚Äôs record? Democratic Congress don‚Äôt own government! They failed their jobs! Sent our jobs to another country like China, Mexico,  ruined by labor costs, higher taxes! Look different!

Well, Trump certainly doesn't, and many Republicans have proven they don't either. Maybe we should start voting for the best individuals for the job instead of a particular party.
trump supporters are the main ones who strive to better help our vets so how dare anyone say horrible things about our amazing president  we love you keep up the great work

Trump suppresses Free Speech. He puts comedians on no-fly lists and calls peaceful protesters anarchists, all while he has a constant attack on the Media who are constitutionally protected by the first Amendment.  Right now, most Republicans are following that lead.

Sleepy joe no one respects you they will only vote for you because they dont like trump
Take Trump's war on Protesters as an example.  Are there some people causing trouble, starting fires, etc? Yes.  Is every protester in that category? No.  By grouping them together, Trump's made enemies of them all, and shown his lack of empathy and tact.
Hey Lightfoot you are the worst Mayor and you don‚Äôt know how to run anything. I bet Pres. Trump was excited to get a letter from you. Tend to your own business and leave everyone else alone.

you seriously are delusional. Seek out the facts because you look like and sound like an idiot. Trump did nothing in January February did nothing. He banned China from entering the country. Besides that trump is racist and actually hates blacks.
That is backwards. Even Trump didn't get a good education and had to pay other people to take his tests.
Trump is less fit for office. If you want to vote for someone better write in Elizabeth Warren, she is more than fit. If you prefer to vote for a conservative, write in Bill Weld. But don't pick the worst choice just because you don't like the only sane person still running.
Ivanka didn't get patents in China? Jr. isn't building a hotel in Russia? Trump doesn't have ties to Turkey?
No, I don't support Trump... so why would I move to China or Russia or any of his buddies' countries?   Unlike Trump, I think China's concentration camps are wrong and we shouldn't be asking them for help in our elections.
Pray All "True Americans" vote in November. If we don't the End begins. Keep praying that God shows us mercy in the next 5 months. If He allows America a second chance and keeps President Trump in office, I will know that God expects us to turn back to Him in 2021. Amen.
I really believe they were ready in 2016. Hillary got the popular vote, but she was plagued with "baggage" that many couldn't get past. Plus Trump cheated. I think with the right woman, it can easily happen in 4 years.

I'm not shocked at all, Teddy. Anyone who isn't up Trump's ass knows this is the right thing to do; we've had enough of a fascist cult led by a traitor in Congress.
I didn't mean it that literally, it's just that many people seem to support Trump beyond reason, no matter what he's done or said. Country should come before Party and before any individual in that party.
Leah have you tried talking with Mr. Trump? I‚Äôm sure he would listen. He is a kind man. Give it a whirl
No... loving your country and freedom are not related to supporting Trump.  Trump worship is an entirely different animal, completely separated from a love or respect for the United States.
We always thought that aliens would sit in the wings until they were needed to save us from unmitigated disaster... e.g. if we were about to start a global nuclear war. I guess the Trump presidency was enough for them.
Of course I am going to boycott baseball. This kneeling garbage is a stupid protest against President Trump.
Trump is a stooge, most world leaders are able to manipulate him into doing what they want, and if they want the US to collapse then they want to keep him happy and in his current position.  I do not think that Trump is purposely helping China, he just wants them to help him.
So what your saying is that Trump has already succeeded in dividing the country?  My thoughts on "Obamagate" is that it's a stupid conspiracy theory about the past when we should be look to the future, and uniting our "divided" country.
Additionally, China wouldn't benefit from Trump leaving office. He is systematically destroying the US Government, which is opening up room in the global landscape for China to expand their reach, both economically and with their military.
Trump did not rebuild the military. And Obama did not destroy it. When Obama was President we still put more of our GDP on Military Spending than almost any other country. He lowered it a bit, but they did not "run out of bullets".
Fox news and OAN have a narrative to explain away the times that Trump says something that makes him sound like a fascist or racist or a bigot, so they are both spinning things in opposite directions.   We need to actually listen to his words and judge for ourselves.
If you actually want me to go over some reasons why I don't think Trump is a good President, I'd be happy to, but since you don't want to listen to me, as you've said, then just go find the answers to those questions yourself.
