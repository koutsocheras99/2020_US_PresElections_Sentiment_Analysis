Hard to disagree. I felt the same way during the first impeachment. It’s a sad day when I’d take Pence as president. But after Trump has tried to sabotage the election, he’s infringing on our constitution. We need to uphold our democracy no matter the cost.

Hey Kevin, arguing with someone that peddles in conspiracies like Carole is pointless. You can use facts and data all day long and it wouldn't matter. It's just a worldwide conspiracy because people don't like Trump 🤣 just happy I don't live in Texas.
The "model" you quoted came out months after the pandemic started from the WH. It was a guesstimate on how many COULD have died. What national plan was implemented to curb the numbers? Do you recall Trump said it's up to the individual states? I'm sorry, but you sound foolish.
Don, with respect for the great work you're doing, this is not a useful approach. Trump wants to kill USPS as we know. But more funding now is not the answer. His hand-picked USPS leader is openly &amp; intentionally ordering employees to slow service. He must be removed immediately!

It’s far past time for Americans to know the real polling numbers. And these are likely to cause Democrats to heat up the suicide hotline. It’s definitely bad news for Camp Biden. Because President Trump is crushing creepy Joe, especially in swing states where it matters most.
That, and also there was normie dems' weird mindset about how nothing about a candidate matters other than being a safe bet to beat Trump.  Bernie could have done a better job making the case that he was just as much or more of a safe bet to win than anyone else

Why does this still shock people? Lots of women, esp.those that lived in NYC knew what a pig trump is. He makes no attempt to hide it. Ask Howard Stern. Ask the wives he cheated on. Ask Billy Bush. Ask his strippers. What is shocking, is that Rep.voters condoned it in 2016.
And that’s why they hate trump because he shut down their gravy train to free taxpayer money.  I wish America would wake up and see how corrupt our entire political class has become
My reflection/anger is retrospective... IF Trump is removed,  the new admin MUST make changes immediately and aggressivly.. things we NEVER thought need to be put into law with clear consequences and non of this bullshit of pleasing “all sides”  talking to you

No doubt many of them are Erik Prince's private military employees (his company Academi was formerly Blackwater). Some likely have served in other "hot spots" such as Portland working hard to further the anti-democratic aims of right-wing dictators around the world like Trump.
One of the reasons Trump and his enablers have been able to get away with the horrible things they have done to America and our allies around the world is the negligence on display among the media. Despite great work done by some (Maddow, O'Donnell, et alia), too many were MIA.

Trump has failed to lead. I’m no fan of his at all. I want him gone.   But the virus has no humanity. It’s merciless. It’s not tied to one person, place, or party.
Pelosi should not have resorted to calling our crisis the Trump Virus. It’s both hypocritical and dumb, distracting from REAL issues at hand.   Not a fan. Just like I’m not a fan of calling it three Chinese Virus for the same reasons.

But your "crazy" friends should be handled with kid gloves? You may not like what they stand for, but all Americans are afforded the protection of the constitution. Why are these "police" in full military gear? Trump wants states to handle their business until he doesn't.
There's no national testing plan. Trump put it on the individual states to figure it out and now wants to claim how great and extensive testing is. Now instead of leaving the states on their own they're pushing that ALL schools should open. Buckshot approach no linear approach.
Article from June where Trump is quoted as saying people wear masks as disapproval of him and not because of CV. He's petty.
I didn't say it was patriotic...Trump did. It could've made a big difference 4 months ago. It's my belief that his change in tone the past couple of days is because his poll numbers are abysmal. He's played this card before so I don't trust he'll stay the course. He's so inept.A Trump lackey.

Nah. Trump fully supports Absentee Ballots.  Let everyone vote absentee. That way we can ensure safety.
The people that were caught red handed trying to burn the courthouse in Portland were all associated with the firestarter, who was found out to be an Aryan, far right, white supremacist, fascist, Trump supporter. He was directed by the far right to create a riot. So there's that.
Also in spring 2016, Trump threatened violence by his supporters in order to discourage a delegate revolt at the 2016 GOP convention. That wasn’t “fascistic” enough for Mr. Calabresi, but this morning’s tweet is?  Again: I welcome his support. But I’d also appreciate a reckoning.
A year or so ago, my 81 year old trump supporting mother told me Tucker Carlson speaks her language. I’ll never forget it as long as I live.

...after he said in a GOP debate that he’d order a war crime (killing families of terrorists), and insisted generals would follow his illegal order because he would be a “strong” leader. Did Mr. Calabresi miss that debate? (It was the one where Trump also talked about his penis.)
Resistance libs love to talk about how they miss "not having to think about the president" when like they don't have to now either. They read about whatever trump is doing and say UGH I HATE HIM SO MUCH and then go back to their normal lives because it doesn't affect them
No masks Covidiots
tRump deflecting his minions’ attention back to Obama. It’s classic penis envy - Obama was the greatest President in recent history and tRump is the worst in all of history so bad tells you how bad good was - not fooled - Obama is a gentleman &amp; a scholar #TrumpIsLosing 🏌️‍♂️📱🍔💩🤡
The Trump virus was already here. And you still aren’t doing shit! How much is the bounty for a dead American? We know you don’t care about the Troops!!
Look, I welcome all converts, no matter how belated. But it would behoove folks like Mr. Calabresi to eventually acknowledge *they were wrong* to not see this coming, and gravely wrong to enable it. Trump has been “fascistic” all along. I first called him that in February 2016...

Oh please. Y'all said that 4 years ago, and look at the shit Trump and Republicans have done to our country. He had 4 yrs. He's destroyed relationships w/ our allies. He's threatening to postpone the election. He's trampled our civil rights. He is destroying the planet.
Nope. Trump is a dweeb. He doesn't know enough about anything at all to "hate" it.
Sounds a lot like Trump's goon squad.
She's a Trump follower and watches Fox News, so of course she wouldn't have seen it. Not that, that matters anyway.
But that's not something trump has done that no other one has... that's just fulfilling the role of the office.

Trump doesn’t understand that the young aren’t the only ones who will be in schools, teachers, administrators, janitors, substitutes will not be immune, and neither will be the kids! That’s a lie, are you willing to bet your child’s life on Trump’s lies?
You want to shield your pals from lawsuits, cut unemployment, give money to big coprporatins and build a building to help Trump make more money.
So will you wear a mask at the next Trump rally Lady G?
Has Mr Schwartz totaled the campaign donations that have landed in Trump Enterprise’s bank account? I have been doing some reading on that topic. Reminds me of when the Trump family was forced to shutter their “Foundation” because they used it as a personal piggy bank. Grifters.
This is why I don't get worked up when people say Trump is trying to rig the election. These dudes can't do a damn thing right.

Trump Pushes Ever Closer to Martial Law (Revelation 18)
So....now that Hermain Cain tragically passed after catching COVID and not being careful, do you think that the Trump campaign complains about Biden being careful ("hiding in his basement") now?!
The fact that the head of the Federalist Society just called for Trump's removal AFTER they got all their wingnut judges on the courts tells you they viewed him as a useful idiot all along.
I did.  And you’re right. O isn’t sincere. He’s fake - a puppet for others. Doesn’t care cuz he’s rich &amp; narcissistic. The worst narcissist to come on the political scene ever. And since.  Trump’s got a huge ego, but there’s a huge difference.
Opinion | Joe Biden accused Trump of trying to delay the election. He should know better. - The Washington Post. ⁦    Embarrassing eh.
This is tRump's America right now! So, He'll be fine handing over his misuse of everything he's ever touched in the US Gvmt. The prosecutors, including SDNY will be on him so quick. BTW, it looks like his taxes will be out and available very soon. #blocktrumpers #TrumpIsARacist
In other words , trump has no plan.  He’s good at making ultimatems, poor at guidelines, financing help for states dealing with the virus, and protecting the electorate.
This seems like a set up in the making.
Let’s start with who Trump put in charge, his son-in-law. I repeat. His son-in-law. *tap tap tap* Hey Republicans, can you hear me?! Son. In. Law.
Bush was worse than Trump. He’s just not as flagrantly stupid.
Trump says vote 4biden I will vote even if 4biden Like and retweet your in agreement too. Even if it means posting a digital copy of our ballot on Twitter/Facebook/or any other social media outlet, We will, A Great solution to 45 bitching about the slower mail sevice he caused.

It was if it winnowed down the Trump enablers in this country....
put it this way: trump won in a landslide in 16. what voters are switching sides in 2020? is dem momentum/enthusiasm any greater now (hint, it’s not)? are MAGA folks or the Right in general any less supportive of trump (hint, theyre not - he had a 50% in iowa 2016, it’s 91 now)?
Hahahahaha ok buddy. Exactly what I called - you dummies all think it's a conspiracy, so there is no point debating. Keep drinking the Trump Kool-Aid, pal. No interest in furthering this chat as you think it's all a big hoax so, again, take care.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Cornyn is a joke. Every time tRump makes an ass out of himself grasping for anything to help him stay in the WH/Oval Office, some Republicon idiot says he was joking. tRump is known for many personality traits, but natural comedian is NOT one of them. He’s scared and grasping.
Delay the Election . The only thing embarrassing about our elections is that Trump is the Liar , Big Liar !
Excuse me but it was the trump virus  killed Herman Cain.
We can assure you Trump that your ass is fired come Nov 3rd
Fascism: I posted 1 sentence about Trump being a Meth head and I literally had someone tell me that If I wanted to be a member of my own freemason lodge, I have to stop speaking facts. This is fascism. Silencing freedom of speech.  has destroyed our country.
I doubt trump writes his own tweets. Move along.
Why America Feels Like a Post-Soviet State. Sad, but true. “Reporting upstairs” permeates the Trump Administration.
Pissed off a magat making light that donald is a rich pedobear! Who got of on small technicality where he paid settlment to victims.... Who's sister was also a judge at the time.....its plain to see the corruption dont stop at the cops.
Fucking Delusional Donnie Trump rambling Gaslighting his supporters  #BunkerBoy
ICYBN (In case you been nappin'): I've been predicting that Trump will try to delay or scrap the election. Today's tweet is a trial balloon. He and the puppeteers will learn where the resistance is, and how the move can be more effective. The move comes in Oct. Chaos is the goal.
So how is Trump acting now that he learned he can’t delay the election? Or has he accepted that yet? Are they still explaining it to him using small words?
I was furious at NPR because they reported Trump’s press conference saying that “ he’s asking Democrats to cooperate in getting help in terms of help for the unemployed. Nothing about Rs dragging their feet and trying to cut unemployment to $200 from $600.
Do you know how stupid you sound. Only the Republicans are doing that shit. Your boy Devin said so his Damn self. He said it's the only the Republican party is going to win this November. So ur goal is to stop us. all the while trump and u are doing the exact same shit.
I lost respect for Hurd for his coward vote to give Trump a pass for Ukraine scandal and impeachment.
Read this statement. Read this statement from a US Senator. Questioning why a court, which has a guilty plea from a defendant, that sentenced said defendant properly. Now this lapdog thinks it should all go away because Trump's AG decides to drop charges! Banana Republicans!
I love the mail in voting that we have in Colorado and will definitely be using vis mail in ballot in November to vote against Donald Trump and there not a thang that him and Putin can do about it.
It was only a matter of time. Trump supporters harassing my b.i.l. for being too brown in Colo. Told him to go back home. 1/3 of his ancestors have always called S. Colorado home. The rest were here before the United States existed. Now my child wants to avoid getting a tan.😠
I truly believe what Mary Trump said, that Donald Trump would have loved nothing better, than to have been the one with his knee on the neck of George Floyd. That is exactly what he is doing now, by suppressing the vote !
Saying that Trump "can't" delay the election is answering the wrong question. The real question is: What happens when he tries? Suppose one—or a few—governors go along with him? Saying "they can't" dodges the question again. What brand of chaos ensues?
More lies: The 46.7 miles of border wall that has so far been built (a meager 2.3 percent of the border itself), according to CBP, stands small in the shadow of the 654 miles of barriers that already existed along the southwest border before Trump took office.
#WeWillVote for Trump to hit the road.
He’s Dead ‘cause he did what Trump told him to do!!!!  Naively went to the Tulsa Rally without Social Distancing or wearing a mask!!!!!!
Funny how all Democrats, as well as some Republicans, have vehemently defended this racist relic when Trump was calling for its end.
you know it's wild out here when  is calling for impeachment and calling Trump "fascistic."
“If there were marked differences between Cory Gardner and Donald Trump, you could see that kind of ticket splitting going on. But, here, there is no difference. A vote for Cory Gardner is a vote for Donald Trump."
Nikki Haley. Never forget she called  Jared a genius. Stated Trump doesn’t lie. But was silent on Jamal Khashoggi.
This presser today with Trump was worse than you can imagine.  I've started watching again, not because I can stomach him now, but I'm watching the cognitive decline.  I predict he just crumbles around the 2nd week of October.
"Don't use any news sites" so what are we looking to for information, crackpot doctors that believe in alien DNA and demon sperm? Trump who constantly lies? His minions? You are in a cult. Trump probably laughs at how gullible you are.
Trump is so desperate he tries blaming mail in ballots, trying to change the election date, anything to avoid the obvious. He is a goner.
Worst GDP un US history, thanks Trump!
Let’s get this straight.  In 2016, We went for the red curtain.  This year, there is no curtain.  We know you and your character.  No longer are we blind.  We choose the blue stage.  Biden and trump are both known to us now.
Your administration is focused only on your re-election, because Donald Trump only cares about Donald Trump.
the real story is that he shouldn't have been at the trump rally. rest in peace herman cain ..

Hi resisters!  Have you contacted your local senators and reps today and demanded they hold trump accountable now for sending gestapo troops into American cities?  Don’t wait for November. Demand action now.
you’ll be surprised when President Trump wins in a landslide!
Total silence from Cory and the  about Trump interfering with the presidential election.  The  is weak and corrupt.
Lmaooo. And yet everything trump has ever said doesn’t.
Trump is simply evil
Then it’s a good thing that mail-in isn’t actually fraught with fraud. That’s just nonsense that Trump wants people to believe.
Trump has caused 150k deaths in this country with his inaction and nonsense. Cain and the others in Tulsa are victims of Trump And their own stupidity. I won’t say he deserved to die, but I do hope his death is a call to action for these bozos and their 🤡 leader.
Maybe consider the context before responding with your hot take on all Americans. I most definitely do NOT miss the Bush fam. The point was simple: Trump is such an egregious piece of shit that it makes you miss literally any other president.
Trump's already told us he doesn't kid and we know that is true because humor is a higher level of development and he's not there. Anytime someone says he was joking you can count on it being a lie.
Is it ironic that Cain died of the virus after attending Trump's need to do a rally in Tulsa?
Trump Twitter better not get a hold of this
If he can stand up to Jim Crow laws, everything that he did, sacrifice what he gave, we can surely stand up to Trump.  Follow his example and lead.  He showed us the way, and did it with love.
#MAGA: Trump's COVID-infused #TulsaRally killed Herman Cain
Genius. Sheer genius.  Trump reacts to firestorm over suggestion of election delay, cites risks from mail-in voting  #FoxNews
When have you ever taught in a public school? You have been such a good little trump today that now the CDC is untrustworthy.
And I am a Hispanic woman against Trump.... One of us is on the right side of history. The racists hate you too.
And still made the decision to put his fragile health at risk by attending Trump’s rally. CONTEXT!
The "embarrassment" to our country happened in November 2016, when Donald Trump was elected President. And it has grown exponentially.
is the percentage including the recent republicans found to have voted fraudulently by mail-in ballot, especially trump who he himself is guilty
Trump did this on purpose. Reince Priebus was/is a fool. Trump bluffed them he would go 3rd party and "Self-Fund".  They caved. FUCK THEM ALL
A terrified Trump will become a desperate Trump. We think he's evil now...I'm guessing we ain't seen shit yet.
Here, I fixed it for you..."Donald Trump is a rapist.  He's going to prison along with the rest of the Trumps.  SOON!."
Trump administration issues memo slashing DACA program
Trump's supporters are dwindling.  He's lost the military, he alienated the courts now, his sheen is getting dull.  By then, he's going to be someone nobody wants to help, a complete outsider like Nixon was the day he resigned.
Every president I can recall promised to ensure the elections would be fair, and they did. Except Trump.
It is the end of The Republic. I don't see how we can come back from this. It's not just Trump, it is the block he represents. We cannot see each other's views. We speak different languages. We apparently worship different Gods. This is gonna be crazy. Not the good kind.
Treasonous? Yes, trump is!!
As previously tweeted, all the people that want a rifle designed to kill people on a battlefield can vote for Trump.  All the people who afraid for the kids or themselves, at a school, church, synagogue or Walmart can vote for Joe. I can live with it.
President Trump, You must quit keeping your promises! That is not how politicians do things. Obviously you didn't get the memo.  Just kidding!
Trump can whine all he wants from a jail cell after the election.

His game is pathetic and we all know what he's doing. I feel for Biden and all he will have to address after the last 4 years. Biden will conduct transition regardless of Trump's tantrums. What's going to be horrifying is Trump and a lameduck GOP Senate and what they will attempt
You mean Sean Trump?
The government can run with Trump sitting in the WH. Biden can probably run the government from home and a decent office building in Dover or Wilmington.
Sigh. All the Trump humpers are dumb. It's so tiring explaining things to you, especially when you seem incapable of comprehending.  "Mail-in voting" (in most states) is the same as absentee voting. The voter requests a ballot.   Only In CO HI OR UT &amp; WA is it all vote-by-mail.
Kinda surprised Trump didn't try to make a comic company in the 90's that would have failed spectacularly...I bet he has an ungodly amount of pallets full of 90's Image number ones in some garage somewhere.
Well beehive is a new trump word. Was it a beautiful beehive or was it a very very very large beehive that no one has ever seen before

Jesus.  How do all the conservative pundits magically "interpret" Trump's words so that they're the least offensive to the nation on a consistent basis?  When are you  gonna take him at face value and listen to the damage his words are having on the nation?
Just another Trump lie. It was the Trump virus.
And he caught  it at a Trump Rally in Tulsa.  And we only know this because Cain is famous.. How many others got sick and/or died to feed Trump’s ego that night? It is a tragedy that never should have happened.
I'm guessing they are trying to cast out the demon inside Trump, right? Did I get it right?

Trump’s tone....sounded like he was heavily drugged.  And his skin tone??
TRUMP PLEASE SHUT YOUR GOD DAMN MOUTH
tRump and his GOP ...the shit they do is so exhausting and old news. We know...this is not new news but rather a new headline.  He has ruined this country.
No matter what though, a Trump win will make the left cry foul.  There’s really no way to get it right.  We are being set up for more chaos.
Indeed, Trump deranged health scare nazis have done quite a number on America. Hoax after hoax after hysterical stampede, just to get one man, at the expense of countless lives &amp; untold misery.  Once just cynical manipulative opportunists, Democrats are now a vicious evil plague.
Someone please make Trump stop
Trump is on msnbc now talking about delaying elections. Why do they even give him an audience? Who’s worse Teump or news station that let trump dpiel his shit for an hour or two a day
Lol. We cited credible studies, not crackpot quack doctors who believe in alien DNA and demon sperm.  He's a Trump supporter, he could have requested the hcq early on. But he's dead now.  We've not pushed any vaccine because none have been approved.  Trump has though.
What Trump jbasically said in this #WhiteHouse briefing is that WHEN the #election is held in November, and WHEN he loses, he will contest the results and try to drag it out for months if not years and refuse to leave the White House - so basically, become an illegal squatter.
Here in Colorado, everyone is mailed a ballot. However, you don't have to return it by mail. You can drop your ballot off in a ballot box at the county clerk's office or other designated locations. I highly recommend this given Trump's ongoing efforts to destroy the Post Office.
Every time Trump shits his pants he yells at China 🇨🇳... never his fault
It's Trump's fault. #ItsTrumpsFault
Wait, what. Trump's argument against vote by mail is the post office fucked up and had some ballots get there too late. So we should not protect people's health by not allowing it instead of just appropriately funding the postal service?
Trump is rambling rambling

So your telling me that if trump wins again there is a chance that I might get deported
Didn't your team try to sneak in $1.75 billion for a new FBI building to protect Trump's hotel interests and then pretend you had no idea that was in there? Or was that all just a dream? It couldn't be reality, because who would do something that stupid?
Because it has never been big enough for Democrats to steal elections with, until now. The fact that the Trump hating zealots are so anxious to have everything done through mail without any face-to-face verification says everything you need to know about why they want it.
Trump's presidency, is causing deaths.....and he WILL NOT USE MY CHILDREN AS GUINEA PIGS !!!!! .
China DID stop COVID-19 in their own country. They even provided us with the data we needed to do the same. You squandered your own opportunity stop it. You can’t blame China for your own incompetence. How about we start calling it the “Trump Virus”?  #TrumpVirus

"It could have been stopped..." Did Trump just acknowledge phucked up?
Well. Okay then. I thought for sure they'd hold onto Trump with their cold dead fingers, anything to keep power.
The Federalist Society founder, is now calling on Trump to be impeached again for attempting to delay the election, any comment? Or are you going to continue to ignore the fact that you are supporting a racist dictator?

It is really baffling to me. When people I know personally tell me they still like Trump I'm like "Have you heard him speak?" I just don't get it. They must want to watch the world burn.
Trump has no chance heck he shut down Republican primaries because it was possible that he wouldn't even get the Republican nomination and he's the party leader.
Why are Republicans and mostly Trump working so hard for Russia. Isn't he supposed to be the President of the United States instead? #TraitorInChief
Shut up!! We’re definitely voting just for TRUMP!!
So which would look worse for trump. Saving countless lives and suppressing COVID (like nearly every other competent country so far) while temporarily tanking the economy, or letting 150,000+ die while, get this, STILL tanking the economy
If Trump got the chance Moscow Mitch would ramrod it through the Senate on Jan 19th.
Trump is now justifying the deaths of those who have died — many of whom are elderly.  This is sickening to listen to.
Firing trump will not get rid of the virus. How stupid
This man Trump is using this press conference he called “urgently” to tell us how bad other countries are doing with corona 😂😂 not the usa with 60k new cases a day and 1k deaths, but Japan, Israel and Latam lol no shame ffs
Trump.
Oh, &amp; I'd be remiss if I didn't add that all of this would've been true with or without COVID-19 but COVID-19 pandemic &amp; the historic failure of Trump's gov in handling it (or success, - I still think they partly purposefully let it get this bad) makes this that much more urgent.
A story about Trump's tweet today and why it's illegal and Q&amp;A about it. Thought it might be helpful.
It's sad to see ppl leveraging #HermanCain's death as a means to promote the mast vs. anti-mask debate. This man died, his family is grieving.   I'm pro-mask, anti-Trump and identify as a progressive Democrat.. but man. The left really needs to stop vilifying the right like this.
Sounds like he was extremely stupid to not be wearing a mask during a pandemic then, don't you think? Anyway, Trump's quack doctor said it's a cure so why didn't it work?
Yes &amp; no. Had Trump, Fox News, GOP taken this shit seriously last yr, took the necessary precautions &amp; not politicized the crap out of it &amp; required a mask mandate outside of the home, maybe these idiots who boast about not wearing a mask, wouldn't get sick &amp; die from COVID-19.
I guess I don't see the point of your tweet either? Like Trump is gonna stop acting like a petty dictator because people are settling for biden? Or people who feel disenfranchised by the system are gonna be like "Wow they are being upfront the system sucks I am gonna vote now!"
Til we get Tom Cotton coasting off of racist Republicans' nostalgia for the Trump years? Because that's terrifying. So... hopefully  is up to the task here, because he has a lot of work to do to not only clean up after Trump, but prevent the next one.
Now’s not the time, but you don’t really seem to have a problem with Trump so go ahead and vote third party - that’s a vote that historically helps the incumbent. If you feel this way you should immediately log off and start knocking on doors
Ranked choice voting. Voter's Bill of Rights. Student loan forgiveness. (Now I'm just ticking off my political fantasy wishes but like, the first part of all of this? Necessary to avoid another Trump. Just saying.)

We need to, over the next four years (assuming Trump loses and actually leaves), start passing laws to enshrine our norms surrounding presidents into law. No more running without immediately releasing tax returns. No more being able to run any kind of business while running.
You miss a president who can put lipstick on a pig. Trump is trash, but he’s so dangerous because of your party’s decades long attack on democracy and the feckless Democrats working only for their corporate bosses.
The November election will be an absolute SHAM and I am URGING every Patriotic American who supports President Trump to BOYCOTT the election by refusing to vote.
Cool, vote third party and watch when Biden or Trump is elected
The more powerful the resistance against Trump becomes, the more agitated he becomes, &amp; the more racism he spews! He doesn't deserve to be called "President," he should be referred to as "the impeached President!". That's what he is. Any other Pres. would have been removed by now
It really isn’t. Trump is unhinged and Biden’s not a threat.
AAPL UP AMZN UP MARKET UP TRUMP WINS AGAIN
as they could have been (and yes, I'm saying that knowing every single awful thing that has happened the last few years) is because Trump is incompetent. Ivanka isn't incompetent. Tom Cotton isn't incompetent. Both are just as fascist but in prettier and more palatable packages.

A related question - did any of them have reputations to uphold before Trump?
“The Catholic Church in the United States has long advocated for the Dreamers and we will continue to stand with them,” said Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles.
Also none of these people said boo when we started locking brown kids up in cages even under Obama, and then when the program expanded to taking away children from their parents under Trump they applauded it.  So, let's not pretend that we haven't always had a fascist undertone.
Every time Trump talks his mouth looks like he's giving someone a blow job.
Well, when you play with fire and everybody that doesn't think exactly like you has been telling you it's fire for *at lest* five years (and Trump didn't come out of the clear blue sky, so that's being real generous).... you're gonna get burned.
WRONG.  Colorado has been voting by mail for decades.  It works, it's safe, TRUMP is just a scared whiny little bit*ch

President Trump does NOT have the authority to move the election. His suggesting otherwise is a dangerous and unprecedented power grab at denying you YOUR rights during a pandemic. He's willing to do anything to stay in office. We must take this threat to our Democracy seriously.
I'm not blinded.  Biden is not the best speaker and often makes gaffs.  Trump is WILLFULLY IGNORANT. He is an unintelligent grifter...and you are the mark.  You are being used.
I think Trump just enjoys bugging the hell out of libs since they dealt him so much pain. I know him. If he loses in 2020 he will cause them pain like they never knew. He doesnt like to lose. They will hurt for a very long time.
I know this young man. He was cool before this. Now he’s helping recruit high school &amp; college students to work the polls in November (because, yes, Trump, the election will go on whether or not you were joking about killing representative democracy).
Really think about this for a minute. Trump has just admitted in front of God and everybody that he's done such a bad job as Prez, he's the first one in history who could not hand off government to his successor.

That would be the one good thing trump would have done. I would rather have the us start a war now instead of in like a few years when China is alot more powerful. We don't want another WW2 senerio.
So Chuckles, Co-Founder of the Federalist Society calling for Trump’s impeachment based on his tweet suggesting a delay in the November Election. Care to comment?
Putin is playing a chess game with our Constitution.  Trump, McConnell and Bar are pawns.  We need a master chess strategy to defeat Putin.  Get ready.
Will do! Be there with no mask standing at the front door to see everyone! Trump 2020
trump would rather burn it all down than lose. He doesn’t care about our democracy or Americans, only himself. November can’t get here fast enough.
Mail in ballots are only for trump supporters, apparently.
Ffs... trump cannot delay the election.  Only congress can, and they’re already pushing back on any suggestion of that happening.
“Obama and Trump are 2 sides of the same coin.”  Yeah, the coin is called “history”, and one of them is on the wrong side...
The only media talking about “mail-in ballots,” is Phaux Spews and Trump backed OANN.  In other words, just the fake news media.
"What's more, even if the voting day were changed, the US Constitution mandates that a presidential administration only last four years. In other words, Donald Trump's first term will expire at noon on 20 January, 2021, one way or another."  BBC 7/30/20
Truth. Trump fears accountability.
Obama delivers call to arms in eulogy for Lewis, links Trump to racist Southern leaders who fought civil rights in…
No way I would work for Trump. That sounds miserable.
If Trump is able to say he is the sole reason for the economy when the numbers are good, he should also take total responsibility when it’s this bad, right? And if not, then doesn’t that just prove that he didn’t have much of a role in the economy in the first place?
That’s trump making America great again. What’s the problem?  Also he profited off of the deal probably on the front end and the back end, just like he is supposed to, right?
I think tRump is trying to make Herman Cain into John Lewis
Y’all do realize we don’t have to try to make George Bush and Bill Clinton look better just because Trump sucks? They can all be shitty humans, and let’s be honest, they all are
Trump's administration is literally arguing in court that immigrants aren't whole persons...  But sure, it's unfair to compare them to Nazis.  Fuck off.
The real reason  wants to delay the 2020 election is because he wants to delay going to prison!  You see Donald knows he’s in deep shit with the #sdny after he is out of office! He and the whole trump crime family is going to prison!
Following trump, will they ever learn!
Today in presidential history: 1. Obama delivers amazing eulogy for John Lewis, an American hero. 2. Trump killed Herman Cain, former leading GOP candidate for President.
Why does the American public fall for trump’s “distraction of the day” repeatedly? We all know he tweeted about the election today to distract everyone from the disastrous GDP contraction. Stop taking the bait!
I don’t watch Trump anymore. Just you and Sarah.
If they want to win, the GOP incumbents and candidates will soon jump off the Trump train-wreck!
Funny how trump’s tweet about delaying the elec came 15 mins after release of the worst economic report in US history.  It would take action by both houses of Congress.  A delay beyond Dec would require a constitutional amendment.    Not happening.
Trump caused his death. He went to Tulsa without a mask for Trump!

Lost my boy a few weeks ago. When we think the world should end, they remind us that pure love actually exists and we are worth it. Btw Trump doesn’t have a dog. Kinda explains a lot doesn’t it?
Hey Don,  give Trump a break.  He said two weeks.   That gives him until August 2, 2020.
So let me get this straight..we have to deal with Trump AND the freaking Kardashians?!?  What the hell?!? Couldn’t we just get locusts?!?🙄🤬🤬

So... is it time to take Trump literally but not seriously yet? Asking for my conservative friends.
how many women have accused Trump? And I think that case was investigated, but how very trumpian of you to feel it is relevant
Your last sentence describes trump. Can't forgive you for your stupidity. Hes ignorant, cruel, incompetent and not wealthy. I don't like him and his family sucking off the treasury and screwing the country.
I swear Trump has had a stroke or something. He done lost his damned mind
Do you know how stupid you sound. Only the Republicans are doing that shit. Your boy Devin said so his Damn self. He said it's the only the Republican party is going to win this November. So ur goal is to stop us. all the while trump and u are doing the exact same shit.
Trump loyalist who tested positive for coronavirus is America’s ‘dumbest’ congressman, says Lincoln Project co-founder
Every president I can recall promised to ensure the elections would be fair, and they did. Except Trump.
It is the end of The Republic. I don't see how we can come back from this. It's not just Trump, it is the block he represents. We cannot see each other's views. We speak different languages. We apparently worship different Gods. This is gonna be crazy. Not the good kind.
I will vote to get rid of lunatic Trump and his Gop puppets!🌹💋
mcconnell, barr and trump
President Trump now virtually calling for a re-run of this November's Presidential election before it's started. Loser.
Trump is this close 🤏to saying we should open schools so kids can get the virus and donate plasma. Like the human batteries in the Matrix. That would make more sense than saying kids are "virtually immune."  #TrumpCoronaRally
We've all been assuring ourselves that Trump can't delay the election, or that a delay past 1/20 means Pelosi takes over. But since when has Trump followed the rules? Everyone should read this and act. We have to stop this.
Oh a sexist for Trump, how novel.  And you see nothing wrong with the way you just responded, do you, given that you disagree with her. Wonder if your mother and grandmother would approve of you talking to a woman that way?  Don’t kid yourself.
John Lewis hated Trump bc he beat Hillary. Not attending Trump’s inauguration was petty &amp; hateful.
But you're good with Trump allowing russia to put bounties on our soldiers. Cool
Well said. It was unfortunate of me to include substance abusers with Trump supporters.
Trump is saving the country.  Stop the hate at least for a day.
I realize more everyday that the polls are being manipulated.  no one in their right mind would vote for Biden, including the Trump hating dems.  Biden, Bernie, AOC, Warren would ruin this country even before their VP takes over.
Understood, and I agree.  So lumping trump supporters with alcoholics isn't fair.  I finally agree with you.  I love some trump supporters I know, but I excuse them for that.   I see what you mean…  still I'd be suspicious of undiscovered human failings with a trump supporter…
I’m sure Herman’s stage 4 cancer May have had something to do w/his death, ya think?   Trump says he looks great in a mask; he never said he didn’t.  Pay attention.
Really, huh?  Trump has murdered everyone who has died in the US the last 3.5 yrs.  Talk about bloody tiny hands. ❤️.  MAGA bc Biden has nothing in his brain!
Harvey the Rabbit shouted across Parliament Square that a culprit is being sought after a smelly trump lingered in the last cabinet meeting #HasToBeHunt
Good question!  The flaw is twisting your logic around to justify supporting someone as obviously faulted as Trump.  Believing what you want to believe.  Finding "TRUTH” in websites that match your preexisting inner beliefs.  Feeling persecuted by honest reporting.
Maye he needs help. "Sorry I killed Herman Cain by calling COVID a hoax and having a stupid rally in Oklahoma." Sincerely, Donald J. Trump.
Upon closer reflection I see your point of likening a trump supporter to alcoholics, but only in that both things are bad.  So it’s not a very interesting comparison and not one I intended to make.
I guess Ben Carson is your last black vote. Mask up Ben. Trump needs you. 😷🥽
Doesn't Cornyn know that Trump used CAPS when he tweeted?
I wonder what kind of surgery will be needed to remove Pompeo's head from Trump's colon.
Mooch! Was so frustrated with you back in the day on  when you were still a Trump sycophant. Now, so happy watching your evolution away from Trumpism- Country b4 Party! Thanks, man!
And to think the left got mad when Pres Trump spoke in the Rose Garden about his sleepy creepy brain dead opponent.
A dear friend from high school posted this comment on a Breitbart feed: “President Trump, we have faith you are hearing us. It’s simple. Make the medicine that we know works available. No vaccines sir. No one is going to get one anyway. No Republican or Christian anyway. 1/
You didn’t give a damn about Herman Cain &amp; you’re politicizing his death by blaming Trump - as if.
😆😆😆Oh, yeah. Like you have a moral leg to stand on. "It's a Democrat hoax. It's under control. Masks don't work. It will be gone in April." You and Trump have mismanaged America into 150,000 deaths. Sit down.
Who likened Trump supporters to alcoholics?  Certainly not I.
Maybe if China hadn’t unleashed the virus on us?  How about Trump stopping flights?  Speak facts not hate.
Impossible. Trump upstaging Barack Obama? Not under any circumstances.
#WeWillVote to dump tRUmp.
If Trump would have paid his respects in person he would have been demonized by the left &amp; given msm fodder for their Hate.
Dems never miss an opportunity to hate on Trump, even a funeral.
Blame &amp; Hate Trump no matter how ignorant you are.
exactly...which put him in the high risk category. He chose to go to the trump rally where he probably infected so many more.
5 of 5 stars to Too Much and Never Enough by Mary L. Trump
You think Biden isn't going to ask?  The scenario here is Trump trying to remain in office beyond his Constitutionally mandated term end on Jan 20th, at which point Biden or Pelosi (most likely) would take the oath. Then they're going to be issuing orders.
No one is surprised. It doesn't. This study is seriously flawed. Worst quarterly GDP loss in modern history. 40M unemployed. 150,000 dead from the virus. Trump isn't always right.
Well yes, I see what you are trying to say, though when I'm making a contrast with Trump, it doesn't really undermine my point!
The entire cast of Hamilton will invite me to their birthday party if I pass on that a culprit is being sought after a smelly trump lingered in the last cabinet meeting #HasToBeHunt
I'm okay with being in the minority -- this white woman has NEVER voted Republican, and there's no way I would have ever voted for Trump.  Anyone who has lived in New York for any amount of time know about his business acumen.  BANKRUPTCIES!
More oratory in the very tip of Barack Obama's little finger than in the entirety of Donald Trump's giant bloated frame. #JohnLewisFuneral #eulogy
Trump killed him!!
Fat mike this is a guy with an eye on the presidency.  Like trump not a reader, msn of history or apparently of honor.
We work? Trump isn’t. He muddies the water. Sends mixed messages and really sees Covid as a threat to his re-election. Yes failed leadership on his part. And you a slavish follower. Begone
Please get the testing ramped up so we can get this under control!!! Push trump in the ass this is ridiculous!!
Donald Trump’s threat to delay or change the 2020 election is empty and absurd. Our election will be on November 3rd and it’s more important than ever to get out to vote and elect Joe Biden.
No. They had to because Trump did nothing to contain the virus in January and now 150,000+ Americans are unnecessarily dead. Hilarious! Ps- S Korea, Japan, New Zealand &amp; others contained covid &amp; are now operating normally, because they don't have a dipshit con artist in charge.
Maybe you and trump can go to the service
Said Trump to absolutely no one. Why aren't you just honest?
#MAGA2020 #TeamTrump #maga  Trump, Barack is killing it today.  And you're hiding in your bunker.  #Fail
I think you misunderstood. Apparently, trump makes everyone sign an NDA’s.
This is the news Trump is trying to distract us from today with his absurd delay election comments.
See you said that dirty word "science." You could also say math, but Trump is inept at both.
#MAGA2020 #maga #TeamTrump  Trump you're a fucking moron.
Maybe trump will give a beautiful eulogy
Same in Colorado. Voter suppression is harder to do with mail in ballots. That’s why the GOP and Trump don’t want it.
Biden slams Trump for promoting false COVID-19 claims from 'crazy woman'  via
Well, it was studied in the journal, and his Brazil study was a controlled trial.  Let's pick it a part on the merits...not pick it a part because "Trump"...who I agree, of course..is dangerous.
values down on my watch. So keep voting for me"  So to my Trump-supporting friends - when you see minority Christians who are unable to vote for Trump this fall, it's not because we "love and support abortion" or have bought into the "fake news media bias" against him...
It took over 30 days for a reporter to finally ask Trump about Russian bounties on U.S. soldiers....seems you're not doing your job very well.
Might have helped if trump didn’t hold a no mask rally in Tulsa #TrumpIsKillingAmericans
But Trump and his cronies did “absentee ballots” not mail in ballots, which are evil. &lt;roll eyes&gt;
it would be nice if trump went to Cain's memorial svc in the rotunda
You all is trump supporters. I suspect you figured this out already. Antifa is a loose term applied by trumpies to protesters  it’s been horribly overused. How did you know they were antifa?
will trump go to his memorial svc?
Why don’t you question the real security issue?? Putin putting a bounty on our American soldiers!! Trump doing nothing other than saying he didn’t get the briefing!! Really!?
New York for instance only allow for third trimester abortions if the fetus wasn’t viable or the patients life was at risk, mr trump would have you believing otherwise 1.3% of abortions are third tri because it’s only allowed strictly, but the left wants to “kill babies”? 🙄
And not a peep from Trump.   #TrumpIsKillingAmericans

Get rid of substance abusers, Trump supporters, lowlifes, unhappy, angry people and you’re way less than half. Why settle for less?
Trump postponing the election has been an anxiety over here since way before the pandemic. Coming from him and his people, it would absolutely not be done in good faith or in any way to benefit the public health. They might use that as an excuse but they really don't care.
And it’s been politicised - mustn’t promote anything Trump did..
You have just made a great case against Trump. After 3 years our elections are not secure? Where is Trump's election security legislation?
I aint going anywhere - enjoy these last few months - Trump is toast.
This is 90 percent distraction from the GDP and unemployment claims numbers; it is 5 percent the daily 'hey, pay attention to me'; and 5 percent the Trump fantasy to be more like Putin.  Show Trump's lack of commitment to democracy -- he's got to go!
Good will "trump" evil. Enough have had enough of this sociopath in chief.
So basically Trump and Parscale killed this man.
Already tired of the panic responses to Trump suggesting delaying the election. He can say what he wants, there's no indication that the support he needs in the military, State Dept., Secret Service, etc. do do anything unconstitutional exists. We vote, he leaves, done.
Show me how they won't. Is their any indication the military, State Department, Secret Service, etc. are going to ignore the law and take their orders from Trump instead of the legal President? If not, then who cares what he claims on Jan 22nd, he's not the President.
States need to have drop off boxes, like we have in Colorado, so we don't have to worry if the Post Office under Trump will even deliver them!
What exactly does this have to do with trump? Because he’s fat or because he’s orange?
Trump doesn’t care about mail in ballots. In the event Trump loses, he is going to claim voter fraud and will blame his loss to the mail in ballots.
deeply glad I got my degrees in American History before Trump became President, because fuck me, good luck wading through all this lads
Stop sharing the fake video of Trump with the comedian doing the voice over. Today is too important to give them a 'social media lies' platform to focus on and distract with.
I love how theses GOP senators trot out their garbage distraction talking points minutes after Trump's daily assault on our democracy. It would be funny if it wasn't so tragic.
Is there anything to stop Trump completely screwing over the GOP and just pulling out of the race to save his face?

Make a statement about Trump delaying the election, ffs.
Not as on-the-nose as you think. Graham will almost definitely support Trump trying to postpone the election.
I remember when Trump got elected and someone told that he’ll stay on as president illegally. I said it couldn’t happen. How naïve I was.
Trump winning by diverting attention and raging against something states control. He’s owning the narrative today when the GDP report and jobless claims are the real story. Media falls for Trump every time.  He’s spewing garbage trying to find a nugget that helps him.
Trump changing the subject away from the disaster he has refused to address. Covid. He’s like a bad magician pulling a rabbit out of a cage and claiming it was a hat and it’s Obama’s fault it was a cage and not a hat.
#MAGA2020 #TeamTrump #maga  Trump you are destroying  this  country.  Resign now.
Troubling.  Concerning.  All trump.
The economy will only be boosted when Americans have money in their hand to do so.  It’s not happening now so why wouldn’t this be a better idea than just to give the wealthy tax breaks..Not sure how the new FBI building helps the economy..maybe Trump’s hotels but not the economy
Trump is trying to, unconstitutionally, destroy the USPS right before the election.  Let’s see, he has already screamed about wanting to limit mail-in balloting, and now he is trying to destroy the USPS.  Hmm.
According to the video of her getting arrested she’s a spokesperson for QAnon and was hired to destroy the display by Trump.
What’s sad is people defend her and her kind. She deserves everything negative that comes her way, and worse since she’s “a QAnon spokesperson”.  Fuck her and that conspiracy group intent on violence if Trump isn’t President for Life.
Because tRump is giving them judges. It’s not hard. Just watch what they do and ignore what they say. It’s all about the judges and money.
You democrats are mentally going off the deep end as you’re realizing you’re going down Nov 3 so you’re throwing every insane thing u can think of at Trump.  Your desperation will no doubt get worse. The American ppl are on to the dems’ ridiculous claims.
trump said he passed the test. No one really knows the actual answer as to why he was taking it or if he passed. The doctors are not going to say anything without his permission. He also probably had an ND the doctors had to sign.
Discussing this at breakfast - why wouldn’t someone of this calibre in their field, be trusted? Simply because hydroxychloroquine has now become politicised, because it was promoted by Trump. Meanwhile, Harvard *dropout Gates... 😐
I debunked majority of those claims I feel like you trump supporters don’t know nothing about ideologies
Yet trump was pro choice before 😏
Total lies &amp; you know it.  Trump has brought us through a horrible time with many unknown challenges &amp; only vile criticism from democrats totally against him  every turn.  Thank God for Trump. Dems are evil &amp; will be defeated bc the country is on to you.
How many Trump supporters out there have been IMPACTED by this man's DISREGARD for ALL of us. He tells YOU &amp; I what he thinks we want to hear, and creates smoke screens and DISTRACTIONS as he tries to HIDE his own agenda. I LOVE you all, but come on!
What would the Rs do if one of them dies because they took Trump’s stupid advice⁉️

I watched the press conference live. Thought Dr. Birx was going to have a coronary right there on the stage. Clorox also thought he said it since they issued an advisory the next day not to swallow their products LOL. Of course, Trump has said many stupid, irresponsible things.
Not true.  Trump hurts himself every time he opens his ignorant mouth. He's his own worst enemy. Trump is making the Democrats ads for them. "Inject disinfectant"  - what a loser Trump is.
Today we lost 1,485 people to the #TrumpVirus. A day  spent tweeting about witch doctors &amp; minority invasion of the suburbs. Trump has dementia &amp; it is clear that he is stuck in his early teen years in the midst of white flight. He doesn't know what year it is!
Correct!  Democracy is on the line.  We must all vote for Trump to keep theUS a democracy and not a socialist country.  I finally agree with you!
Go to the next Trump rally and don't wear a mask.
Well if demon sex and demon sperm are actual things, the GOP and the Trump administration are the place to find them.

Trump is such a liar ... the protests in Portland are taking place in the area of about one block.  All Trump knows how to do: lie and fear-monger.
The reason this won't work is republicans have been telling us for years that they're all the same -- corrupt.  Even if Americans think that maybe the Obama administration did something wrong, they'll figure Trump is way worse and Biden will be better for America!
Why do you like Trump? Are you ok with Russia putting bounties on our military’s head? Are you ok with people kidnapping you in the street when you are protesting for you religious rights? I just don’t get you people.
You're kidding, right? This is Trump trying to be strategic for America? No, it's strategic for Russia. I'm not near an expert but this has been playing out since 2017. Bit by bit. And Putin, err, Trump needs to get it done now, just in case he can't steal the election.

Well, Mitch, you are the one holding things up and blaming the dems. Hitler and Goebbels did that. They said, "Blame others for that which you are doing." You and Trump are good students.
Trump’s chief of staff says they won’t make the deadline to renew unemployment insurance: ‘Nowhere close to a deal’ -  They never wanted to. It's all about the cruelty.
The girl is literally guiding Biden, hanging on to him! Can you imagine if that was Trump?!?!
I’m tired of these stupid statements about Trump by dems in power.  Easy to demonize Trump (they all do it) - just throw words out there with no explanation, proof, reason.  These are small petty people. With no other prez  was the vitriol so bad.  LOVE TRUMP
I'm no defender of trump. I just think there's been a pattern of us learning new information and then things changing regarding covid, and so I hope this guy from Yale gets a hearing.

Trump re-election strategy: Crank racism up to 11‼️
Trump has been a mess no doubt, but he is a reflection of us. we as Americans are a mess as well if we think it's all his fault and Congress isn't to blame both Republicans and Democrats.
Are you sure they’re Biden allies⁉️ This sure stinks of Trump/Putin‼️‼️
One of the criticisms I might share with our president is that sometimes those things get dismissed out of hand simply because he's associated with them. And rightly so :-) but in this case the word Yale carries some weight &amp; I think they should be investigated Trump or no Trump

Mr. Trump.   You will be charged, convicted and imprisoned for Treason and for Crimes Against Humanity.  We are coming for you in November.
“Debates” are just another chance for Trump to rant and lie in the spotlight. Excepting the unlikely scenario where numbers show debates could help Dems lock up the Senate, Biden should pass. Make embedded fact checkers a condition so Trump will chicken out.
He said a truth! It's a new Trump!
😂 Have you ever actually LISTENED to Trump?! OBVIOUSLY not! 😂 The most illiterate, inarticulate president in the history of this country!
Fox news wants ratings. Biden is hot. Trump is losing. Like a dawg.

in the end, it will all come down to money, but I do think it is this:  Remember that thing that cured your virus? Trump told you to take that. He said saved your life and you should vote for him.  What's HE got to lose? If it doesn't work, they die. No big deal.
That's why trump is pushing it! He owns stock in the company that makes it.
Go ahead Trump, pull that trigger.  It will not end well for you, or your secret police.
yes, trump did the wrong things, seems republicans make all kinds of excuses for an awful being. Certainly not human
Just one more example of Jabba the Trump's Gestapo tactics.
It would take Putin 60 seconds to convince Trump that doing something was in Trump's favor.  Example: "Bring your soldiers home from Germany.  Make a commercial on reconnecting these families  show happy dads and children.   You should counter this Lincoln group garbage". Done.

If you go to a public place indoors, please wear a mask.  Otherwise you're saying you support Trump and don't care about infecting others.
That's not accurate.  If he loses, secrete service will remove him.  Hence, Trump has no intention of losing the election.

Most Trump supporters I’ve seen claim that officer acted accordingly or that his kneeling was not the cause of death. And even if Trump supporters claim his death was wrong, they certainly haven’t shown that they care.
Not be trump
Barr is not trapped. He is there willingly. Anyone with any morals or integrity would leave the Trump administration and testify to Congress and the world what they have witnessed. Stop bullshitting us.
Trump is doing what an actual fascist dictator would do. He is sending in Federal troops (against the wishes of local government) to attack peaceful protesters. Arrest the people destroying government property, but don't tear gas moms, dads, and veterans.
America, #ThePresidentIsACrybaby and is perplexed why no one likes him as compared to Fauci. Let me take a stab at it. Fauci is trying to help us not to die.  The Daily Beast: Trump: How Come People Like Fauci but 'Nobody Likes Me?'.   via
Not false. Why didn't the country shutdown when Obama and his administration had to deal with H1N1, Ebola, and SARS? It's because Obama competently handled these viral outbreaks. Trump has done nothing but tweet, play golf, and spread misinformation.
Trump destroys himself. By his lies, by his ignorance, by his obvious misogyny and racism. People who are decent humans don't like Trump.
And I am saying you are the hypocrite. You chastised Tado for using "lady man" but support Trump who banned trans people from the military.
Nothing the democrats can do about Trump/Barr as the democrats are going to be voted out - Americans are sick &amp; tired of their lies &amp; corruption.
I have not seen anything trump since North Dakota. Colorado is, I believe, blue instead of purple this election.
I love nothing than bashing Donald Trump for his ineptitude &amp; hypocrisy. But Big Pharma are NOT the good guys here, they refuse to lower prices. There is something called Pharma Tourism where elderly &amp; sick people have to go to Mexico or Canada their meds in the US #FuckBigPharma
You're wrong. Fauci has a higher approval rating then Trump, which is driving Trump crazy. It is the White House that is trying to discredit Fauci. Fauci tells the truth; Trump wants people to die.
Yes, the total devastation is because of Trump's incompetence at being a leader.
Trump is president. I said it. But he is not my president in the way I normally say someone is president. Now that I think about it, I've never seen had to say that with previous presidents, and I have lived, so far, with 11 presidents.
Here's why you're the hypocrite,  .  You're so concerned about Tado insulting trans people but you support Trump who banned them from the military. That is the definition of "double standard."
Trump abruptly ends briefing after being pressed over retweeting misinformation                                        The guy (trump) is an idiot   Please VOTE BIDEN   Spare our country from being flushed
If people hate Trump so much, they make the mistake of voting in people like Biden and Clinton, rather than respectable socialists such as Sanders. Although what worries me about Sanders is that his dirty laundry is near nonexistent, at least you know Biden/Clinton are dirty.
In 2024 trump will be 78. Older, dimmer, fatter. And no more love able.
You keep touting that 4 more years of Trump like a give a shit. It's so fucking obvious that you don't care about anything but you and that frankly is just sad as hell.
#MAGA2020 #maga #TeamTrump  Trump you look like a fucking moron.
I think she's talking about Trump's:  - Failed trade w/ China - Failed nuclear deal w/ DPRK - Racist tactics to resolve racial injustice - Decimated DoJ &amp; State Dept - Kids separated from families &amp; in cages - Collusion w/ Russia  Pick all that apply.
Trump is the one politicizing the virus. No other president has ever done that. Other presidents don't play golf during a crisis. Any other president would have had a national plan.
All while Trump is playing golf.
It was bizarre, poorly put together, and not very accurate.  Just Trump scaring 55 y.o white folks into more ridiculousness
That's where our government should have protected us. Millionaires and billionaires received pandemic benefits. That's wrong. Trump's buddies got richer. The Trump administration isn't helping anyone but himself and his friends.
Fauci wasn't a political hack until Trump said he was. There was a lot of misinformation in the beginning because we knew nothing about the virus.   I played softball not because I am a lesbian but because I was good at it.
Yes, but you can't pay your bills if you're dead. Or, look at the increased debt if you have to be hospitalized with the virus for any length of time.  The first step was to contain the virus. Trump didn't do that so lives are lost and so is the economy.
In case there was any doubt, Trump knows why people don't like or approve of him.
As someone who played softball for 20 years, I felt badly for Fauci's pitch. But who cares - the man has a brilliant mind, something Trump supporters don't appreciate. You respond better to lies and bullying.   Where's the double standard?
I am a hater of everything Trump.
You're not a good person. You support Trump.
tRump is more pathetic every day.
I had hoped getting rid of Trump would be like removing a mole or draining a boil. It’s turned out to be more like removing a 10 pound cancerous puss draining tumor with a putty knife and a corkscrew.
Murphy's Mom is a Trump supporter who thinks wearing a mask infringes on her freedom.   You definitely don't fvcking want her.
Just saw a Trump ad that started with text "Biden wants to defund police" &amp; featured a grandma calling 911 during a burglary. The voice on the other end was an answering machine that said something akin to "we can't answer the phone because our budget was cut".  She was attacked
Boozer is a Trump supporter so he is going to be against anyone who is not straight and white. Remember, anything different from them makes them uncomfortable.
Who's imposing martial law except for Trump? You see taking safety precautions to prevent the spread of a highly virulent disease as taking away your rights? What law is it violating? You're twisted in your head.
How have I sponged off the U.S.?   Trump didn't serve. Neither has any member of his family. Is he sponging off the U.S.? Does he also hate the U.S? He must, by your standards.
Trump would never allow murals of black men and women to be painted on any Federal building. He's a racist.
It’s because you have lied to us thousands of times. I wouldn’t believe trump if he said the sky was blue. #TrumpVirus #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
The wind is tearing down Donald Trump's border wall 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Trump Virus is the reason more Americans want mail in ballots.
We are voting Trump 2020
We ridin' the trump train to crazytown.
As much as the reallocated funds need to be returned to the original budgets, letting the GOP slip them back in is like approving Trump's money grab. The GOP need to pay a price for allowing Trump to bastardize the budget.
More corruption by the Trump Swamp. How much did DeVos know? The next Attorney General will have plenty to pursue.
Biden will only get worse. Anyone who votes for him irrationally hates Trump more than they care about the future of us &amp; our country.  Bernie will be pulling Biden’s strings - he already is.
I can not believe it!! They ask a question and don't let General Bill Barr answer!! Democrats are just pathetic, but they are losing control ,losing all States and giving the election for president Trump...
Hey  what little grifting amongst family and friends?  #TrumpCrimeFamily
Oh FFS. What a load of bullshit. Barr is trump's stooge. He lies with impunity and hopes people like you continue the lies. #BarrTestimony #CorruptAndComplicitGOP
Well I'm pissed I missed the beginning of this hearing with Trump's flunky. #BarrTestimony
If Trump wins, I predict Pelosi will lose so she won’t have to resign.
This hearing is getting Trump elected.
Thank you for telling the truth. Thank you for your service. You might as well resign now, though, because Trump.
Yet he said that Trump's tweets that he didn't read made his job difficult?
Impossible Trump is broke. I give it less than 2 years and the Trumps file for bankruptcy again. It will be Obama’s and Covid’s fault not his fault for being over leveraged!
I've been watching the hearing. Dems are fkn it up. Instead of asking meaningful questions, they're using their time for political rhetoric, like Trump's pressers. I hate fkn politicians.
#ItsOurHouse ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️  White House continues to build new 13-foot high 'anti climb' wall
Here to deliver a letter to Cory Gardner asking him to stand up against Trump's Lawsuit to repeal the ACA while Black and Latinx communities are being disproportionately affected by Coronavirus. It's reckless and quite frankly racist to take away care from millions who need it.
Captain SecretPants at Number 10 gave my bumhole a tickle with their little finger, winked at me and said a culprit is being sought after a smelly trump lingered in the last cabinet meeting #HasToBeHunt
Then we will just be told that Trump was the demon in this scenario and Jerry Nadler will call it a myth that the media ever said that Trump said anything about fish tank cleaner.
From now on, Trump will insist cameras don't show his legs.
Kobach, who loves to kiss Trump's ass by claiming voter fraud, has found another issue to project GOP lies.
After #TrumpKillsTexas, where will he kill next?  Also, when will the #MSM learn that Trump will NEVER change his tone? He may occasionally speak w/ a different tone but that's him acting. And he's not a good actor.
I am less hopeful that we can fix the country, but I still agree we can only try to survive by getting rid of Trump.
Barr spars with Dems on Trump ties, riots at fiery House hearing
And if Covid-19 is such a hoax, why have 12 of the Marlins (Florida baseball team) tested positive? The MLB did everything they could to keep the players safe but they still contracted the virus. These Trump morons thing schools should reopen - what a cruel and disastrous move.
Yeah.... cuz that worked so well with trump.  *sigh*
That’s the way, bury your head, ignore the facts and maintain your anti-Trump Derangement Syndrome!
We are shutdown. The United States is shutdown. There are 42,000,000 unemployed. Thousands are at risk of eviction. What has Trump done about it? Describe to me what Trump's National Plan is to save American lives and restart the economy. I'll wait....
Not gonna lie, but Bolsonaro’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been amongst the very worst, if you want to criticise Trump’s statement of “less testing, less cases” wait until you see Bolsonaro’s method.   AuthRight spaghetti sauce man couldn’t tell his arse from his elbow.
The Mueller Report found 150 contacts between Trump campaign and Russia. Our allies (Australia, England) had similar reports. That is not fake news and Obama did not spy on Trump.
Although their time is limited, and I'm no supporter of Barr or Trump, the Democrats questions appear to be bullying him. They should let him answer and explain. Otherwise the hearing may not appear to be legimate.
Demon Sperm is trending on Twitter this morning.   Just another Tuesday in Trump's 2020.
Twitter should end all Trump accounts permanently. All their trash talk is hurting our country!
This is going nowhere, Democrats are painting a picture of trump using slight of hand and the republicans are are telling Americans that they are protecting us and courthouses and status. I hope this helps but I doubt it will. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace

Fantastic. The cool kids are ready to get rid of Trump.
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣 trump will be indicted Jan. 20.
His sisters not a judge anymore! No more mistrial defense. Or interferences.
“Respectable” conservatives like Calabresi have been telling me for 4½ years I was hysterically overreacting when I called Trump fascistic. “Trump Derangement Syndrome!” “You said that about Romney too!” (Nope.)  If they’ve finally realized they were wrong, great—but maybe say so
Still waiting for Trump's national plan to lower the COVID Rates, testing and contract tracing, make sure schools are safe and for us to have a safe national election.  When is he going to release?
The courthouse firestarter apprehended in Portland was found to be tied to a white supremacist, Aryan, racist group. He was directed by the far right to incite violence among the peaceful protesters. You're a moron. tRump's a racist. #TrumpleThinSkin

And 2 dead with Ebola in 2014 make Obama a failed president , 150 k and counting dead Americans makes Trump a successful one ! That GOP for ya
Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
trump:  It's too dangerous to hold our election in November.  Also trump:  It's safe enough to send your babies to school right now.
⁦ : This one is for you!      You have echoed lies and defended demagoguery. It must sting to still be defending Trump.
You are dying breed, wrong side of history! You have and your Con man Trump has made China a more reliable country as compared to USA!
Rules for thee but not for me! Anyway, Trump’s tweet about delaying the 2020 election has probably already cured covid.
Im so sick and tired of these I voted Republican all my life and voted for trump because he was the lesser of two evils bullshitters. now months before his term ends with lowered chances of re-election gop voters have seen the light! FUCK YOU! Y’all made this. #FederalistSociety
Nah. Trump fully supports Absentee Ballots.  Let everyone vote absentee. That way we can ensure safety.
The people that were caught red handed trying to burn the courthouse in Portland were all associated with the firestarter, who was found out to be an Aryan, far right, white supremacist, fascist, Trump supporter. He was directed by the far right to create a riot. So there's that.
Also in spring 2016, Trump threatened violence by his supporters in order to discourage a delegate revolt at the 2016 GOP convention. That wasn’t “fascistic” enough for Mr. Calabresi, but this morning’s tweet is?  Again: I welcome his support. But I’d also appreciate a reckoning.
A year or so ago, my 81 year old trump supporting mother told me Tucker Carlson speaks her language. I’ll never forget it as long as I live.
He has to be stopped. Mail in ballots are now drop off ballots. Vote early.  Trump is destroying ⁦ Another American icon being taken down to help his election
So now it’s ‘Communist’ China? Is this all you and Trump have for the campaign? Don’t you have anything better to do than harass the NBA?

Well, I am a conservative. That's the point.  Regardless, it appears that  did oppose Trump's Tweet today.
is GOING DOWN... Number of Americans who fervently oppose Trump's reelection approaches point of no return  #SmartNews
...after he said in a GOP debate that he’d order a war crime (killing families of terrorists), and insisted generals would follow his illegal order because he would be a “strong” leader. Did Mr. Calabresi miss that debate? (It was the one where Trump also talked about his penis.)
Resistance libs love to talk about how they miss "not having to think about the president" when like they don't have to now either. They read about whatever trump is doing and say UGH I HATE HIM SO MUCH and then go back to their normal lives because it doesn't affect them
No masks Covidiots
tRump deflecting his minions’ attention back to Obama. It’s classic penis envy - Obama was the greatest President in recent history and tRump is the worst in all of history so bad tells you how bad good was - not fooled - Obama is a gentleman &amp; a scholar #TrumpIsLosing 🏌️‍♂️📱🍔💩🤡
The Trump virus was already here. And you still aren’t doing shit! How much is the bounty for a dead American? We know you don’t care about the Troops!!
Look, I welcome all converts, no matter how belated. But it would behoove folks like Mr. Calabresi to eventually acknowledge *they were wrong* to not see this coming, and gravely wrong to enable it. Trump has been “fascistic” all along. I first called him that in February 2016...
Trump’s gathering in OK dissing the wearing of masks and social distancing  caused Herman Cain’s death #TrumpHasBloodOnHisHands #TrumpLiesPeopleDie #TrumpIsNotWell
Trump 2020!!
Oh please. Y'all said that 4 years ago, and look at the shit Trump and Republicans have done to our country. He had 4 yrs. He's destroyed relationships w/ our allies. He's threatening to postpone the election. He's trampled our civil rights. He is destroying the planet.
Nope. Trump is a dweeb. He doesn't know enough about anything at all to "hate" it.
Be careful!  The trump family is looting the national treasures!
Sounds a lot like Trump's goon squad.
She's a Trump follower and watches Fox News, so of course she wouldn't have seen it. Not that, that matters anyway.
But that's not something trump has done that no other one has... that's just fulfilling the role of the office.
Which is worse:  Trump on TV or a tornado overhead?
Wrote this 10 days ago...almost nobody seemed to have noticed that Dems were trying to give the Department of Homeland Security $50 billion at the very moment Dems were issuing press releases pretending to be mad at Trump for deploying DHS police to cities

The fact that the head of the Federalist Society just called for Trump's removal AFTER they got all their wingnut judges on the courts tells you they viewed him as a useful idiot all along.
I did.  And you’re right. O isn’t sincere. He’s fake - a puppet for others. Doesn’t care cuz he’s rich &amp; narcissistic. The worst narcissist to come on the political scene ever. And since.  Trump’s got a huge ego, but there’s a huge difference.

put it this way: trump won in a landslide in 16. what voters are switching sides in 2020? is dem momentum/enthusiasm any greater now (hint, it’s not)? are MAGA folks or the Right in general any less supportive of trump (hint, theyre not - he had a 50% in iowa 2016, it’s 91 now)?
Not to mention the lies. Local Dem leadership closed polling places, nor Republicans and it's impossible for it to have been Trump.  Ignorance and Fake News at best

For the Dems, It’s all come down to we don’t care about who is President, we just don’t want Trump. I know some conservatives that don’t want Trump to win only because how bad things might be if he was re-elected. Now that’s Democracy!!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

ICYBN (In case you been nappin'): I've been predicting that Trump will try to delay or scrap the election. Today's tweet is a trial balloon. He and the puppeteers will learn where the resistance is, and how the move can be more effective. The move comes in Oct. Chaos is the goal.
So how is Trump acting now that he learned he can’t delay the election? Or has he accepted that yet? Are they still explaining it to him using small words?
I was furious at NPR because they reported Trump’s press conference saying that “ he’s asking Democrats to cooperate in getting help in terms of help for the unemployed. Nothing about Rs dragging their feet and trying to cut unemployment to $200 from $600.
Jason, millions of folks believe Trump is the worse President in history and a lying criminal. When asked about Biden’s qualifications to be President, you replied “better than Trump”. That’s quite the endorsement!  Biden’s better than a criminal.

It was only a matter of time. Trump supporters harassing my b.i.l. for being too brown in Colo. Told him to go back home. 1/3 of his ancestors have always called S. Colorado home. The rest were here before the United States existed. Now my child wants to avoid getting a tan.😠
I truly believe what Mary Trump said, that Donald Trump would have loved nothing better, than to have been the one with his knee on the neck of George Floyd. That is exactly what he is doing now, by suppressing the vote !
Saying that Trump "can't" delay the election is answering the wrong question. The real question is: What happens when he tries? Suppose one—or a few—governors go along with him? Saying "they can't" dodges the question again. What brand of chaos ensues?
More lies: The 46.7 miles of border wall that has so far been built (a meager 2.3 percent of the border itself), according to CBP, stands small in the shadow of the 654 miles of barriers that already existed along the southwest border before Trump took office.
#WeWillVote for Trump to hit the road.
He’s Dead ‘cause he did what Trump told him to do!!!!  Naively went to the Tulsa Rally without Social Distancing or wearing a mask!!!!!!
Funny how all Democrats, as well as some Republicans, have vehemently defended this racist relic when Trump was calling for its end.
you know it's wild out here when  is calling for impeachment and calling Trump "fascistic."
“If there were marked differences between Cory Gardner and Donald Trump, you could see that kind of ticket splitting going on. But, here, there is no difference. A vote for Cory Gardner is a vote for Donald Trump."
Nikki Haley. Never forget she called  Jared a genius. Stated Trump doesn’t lie. But was silent on Jamal Khashoggi.
This presser today with Trump was worse than you can imagine.  I've started watching again, not because I can stomach him now, but I'm watching the cognitive decline.  I predict he just crumbles around the 2nd week of October.
"Don't use any news sites" so what are we looking to for information, crackpot doctors that believe in alien DNA and demon sperm? Trump who constantly lies? His minions? You are in a cult. Trump probably laughs at how gullible you are.
Trump is so desperate he tries blaming mail in ballots, trying to change the election date, anything to avoid the obvious. He is a goner.
Worst GDP un US history, thanks Trump!
Let’s get this straight.  In 2016, We went for the red curtain.  This year, there is no curtain.  We know you and your character.  No longer are we blind.  We choose the blue stage.  Biden and trump are both known to us now.
Your administration is focused only on your re-election, because Donald Trump only cares about Donald Trump.
the real story is that he shouldn't have been at the trump rally. rest in peace herman cain ..

you’ll be surprised when President Trump wins in a landslide!
Total silence from Cory and the  about Trump interfering with the presidential election.  The  is weak and corrupt.
Lmaooo. And yet everything trump has ever said doesn’t.
Trump is simply evil
Then it’s a good thing that mail-in isn’t actually fraught with fraud. That’s just nonsense that Trump wants people to believe.
Trump has caused 150k deaths in this country with his inaction and nonsense. Cain and the others in Tulsa are victims of Trump And their own stupidity. I won’t say he deserved to die, but I do hope his death is a call to action for these bozos and their 🤡 leader.
Maybe consider the context before responding with your hot take on all Americans. I most definitely do NOT miss the Bush fam. The point was simple: Trump is such an egregious piece of shit that it makes you miss literally any other president.
Trump's already told us he doesn't kid and we know that is true because humor is a higher level of development and he's not there. Anytime someone says he was joking you can count on it being a lie.
Is it ironic that Cain died of the virus after attending Trump's need to do a rally in Tulsa?
Trump Twitter better not get a hold of this
If he can stand up to Jim Crow laws, everything that he did, sacrifice what he gave, we can surely stand up to Trump.  Follow his example and lead.  He showed us the way, and did it with love.

When have you ever taught in a public school? You have been such a good little trump today that now the CDC is untrustworthy.
And I am a Hispanic woman against Trump.... One of us is on the right side of history. The racists hate you too.
And still made the decision to put his fragile health at risk by attending Trump’s rally. CONTEXT!
The "embarrassment" to our country happened in November 2016, when Donald Trump was elected President. And it has grown exponentially.
is the percentage including the recent republicans found to have voted fraudulently by mail-in ballot, especially trump who he himself is guilty
Trump did this on purpose. Reince Priebus was/is a fool. Trump bluffed them he would go 3rd party and "Self-Fund".  They caved. FUCK THEM ALL
A terrified Trump will become a desperate Trump. We think he's evil now...I'm guessing we ain't seen shit yet.

Trump administration issues memo slashing DACA program
Trump's supporters are dwindling.  He's lost the military, he alienated the courts now, his sheen is getting dull.  By then, he's going to be someone nobody wants to help, a complete outsider like Nixon was the day he resigned.
Every president I can recall promised to ensure the elections would be fair, and they did. Except Trump.
It is the end of The Republic. I don't see how we can come back from this. It's not just Trump, it is the block he represents. We cannot see each other's views. We speak different languages. We apparently worship different Gods. This is gonna be crazy. Not the good kind.
Treasonous? Yes, trump is!!
As previously tweeted, all the people that want a rifle designed to kill people on a battlefield can vote for Trump.  All the people who afraid for the kids or themselves, at a school, church, synagogue or Walmart can vote for Joe. I can live with it.
Trump’s friend Cain didn’t wear a mask. He’s dead.
It always takes at least two to three weeks for states to certify their election results. What you see is trump blowing out his ass as usual.
President Trump, You must quit keeping your promises! That is not how politicians do things. Obviously you didn't get the memo.  Just kidding!
Trump can whine all he wants from a jail cell after the election.
Actually he lost his black friend due to trump’s insistence on a mask fee rally. So in effect, trump murdered him.

His game is pathetic and we all know what he's doing. I feel for Biden and all he will have to address after the last 4 years. Biden will conduct transition regardless of Trump's tantrums. What's going to be horrifying is Trump and a lameduck GOP Senate and what they will attempt
You mean Sean Trump?
The government can run with Trump sitting in the WH. Biden can probably run the government from home and a decent office building in Dover or Wilmington.
mcconnell, barr and trump
Sigh. All the Trump humpers are dumb. It's so tiring explaining things to you, especially when you seem incapable of comprehending.  "Mail-in voting" (in most states) is the same as absentee voting. The voter requests a ballot.   Only In CO HI OR UT &amp; WA is it all vote-by-mail.
President Trump now virtually calling for a re-run of this November's Presidential election before it's started. Loser.
Kinda surprised Trump didn't try to make a comic company in the 90's that would have failed spectacularly...I bet he has an ungodly amount of pallets full of 90's Image number ones in some garage somewhere.

Just another Trump lie. It was the Trump virus.
And he caught  it at a Trump Rally in Tulsa.  And we only know this because Cain is famous.. How many others got sick and/or died to feed Trump’s ego that night? It is a tragedy that never should have happened.
I'm guessing they are trying to cast out the demon inside Trump, right? Did I get it right?

‘Undemocratic, Outrageous And Insulting’: Gov. Jared Polis Reacts To Trump’s Tweet About Delaying Election
You say people are lazy but create a system where they make more to stay home? But don’t understand why people say raise minimum wage. No your bill was dumb. Then the deadline is here and y’all haven’t late talks. Trump blames Pelosi and Pelosi trump. These are the best minds???
A Trump presidency 🤦🏼‍♀️
Even though we're dealing with a pandemic right now, y'all do know people have a choice to participate in group gatherings? To blame President Trump is pure ignorance.
Trump’s tone....sounded like he was heavily drugged.  And his skin tone??
TRUMP PLEASE SHUT YOUR GOD DAMN MOUTH
Trump is this close 🤏to saying we should open schools so kids can get the virus and donate plasma. Like the human batteries in the Matrix. That would make more sense than saying kids are "virtually immune."  #TrumpCoronaRally
tRump and his GOP ...the shit they do is so exhausting and old news. We know...this is not new news but rather a new headline.  He has ruined this country.
Obama is a slimy liar and the agent provocateur in the ongoing attempt at a coup d’etat to unseat President Trump before the November Presidential Election.
No matter what though, a Trump win will make the left cry foul.  There’s really no way to get it right.  We are being set up for more chaos.
Indeed, Trump deranged health scare nazis have done quite a number on America. Hoax after hoax after hysterical stampede, just to get one man, at the expense of countless lives &amp; untold misery.  Once just cynical manipulative opportunists, Democrats are now a vicious evil plague.
Someone please make Trump stop
Trump is on msnbc now talking about delaying elections. Why do they even give him an audience? Who’s worse Teump or news station that let trump dpiel his shit for an hour or two a day
Lol. We cited credible studies, not crackpot quack doctors who believe in alien DNA and demon sperm.  He's a Trump supporter, he could have requested the hcq early on. But he's dead now.  We've not pushed any vaccine because none have been approved.  Trump has though.
What Trump jbasically said in this #WhiteHouse briefing is that WHEN the #election is held in November, and WHEN he loses, he will contest the results and try to drag it out for months if not years and refuse to leave the White House - so basically, become an illegal squatter.
Here in Colorado, everyone is mailed a ballot. However, you don't have to return it by mail. You can drop your ballot off in a ballot box at the county clerk's office or other designated locations. I highly recommend this given Trump's ongoing efforts to destroy the Post Office.
Every time Trump shits his pants he yells at China 🇨🇳... never his fault
It's Trump's fault. #ItsTrumpsFault
Wait, what. Trump's argument against vote by mail is the post office fucked up and had some ballots get there too late. So we should not protect people's health by not allowing it instead of just appropriately funding the postal service?
The Marxist puppet Biden will never debate President Trump.
Trump is rambling rambling
Ut oh, we're now talking about smart people and stupid people...I wonder if there is a basket of stupid people, according to Trump.
Not all was bad some was good, one car had a BLM flag flying through the wind as they went pass me shouting fuck tRUMP.
Biden would absolutely have done better, as illustrated by the fact that he isn't taking unnecessary trips out of his house and is working remotely as much as possible. In other words, taking the virus seriously, unlike Trump.

Okay it's no longer a press conference ...it's turned into a trump rally. I'm done
We've all been assuring ourselves that Trump can't delay the election, or that a delay past 1/20 means Pelosi takes over. But since when has Trump followed the rules? Everyone should read this and act. We have to stop this.
Lol Trump is just saying Republicans are working for all the things they are actively fighting against. He just lies with so little effort it's crazy.
So your telling me that if trump wins again there is a chance that I might get deported
Didn't your team try to sneak in $1.75 billion for a new FBI building to protect Trump's hotel interests and then pretend you had no idea that was in there? Or was that all just a dream? It couldn't be reality, because who would do something that stupid?
Because it has never been big enough for Democrats to steal elections with, until now. The fact that the Trump hating zealots are so anxious to have everything done through mail without any face-to-face verification says everything you need to know about why they want it.
Trump's presidency, is causing deaths.....and he WILL NOT USE MY CHILDREN AS GUINEA PIGS !!!!! .
China DID stop COVID-19 in their own country. They even provided us with the data we needed to do the same. You squandered your own opportunity stop it. You can’t blame China for your own incompetence. How about we start calling it the “Trump Virus”?  #TrumpVirus
did they reject his premise (that the election would be rigged) or just his conclusion? Seems to me like the premise is what Trump's trying to sell.
Trump’s let’s-trash-democracy bid to distract from day’s terrible economic news was rejected by every Republican I’ve seen: McConnell, Cruz, Rubio, McCarthy and also  And only Trump would say it on the day of voting-rights-champion John Lewis’ funeral. #cosen

Well. Okay then. I thought for sure they'd hold onto Trump with their cold dead fingers, anything to keep power.
That’s why we need trump to stop trying to ban mail in voting

It is really baffling to me. When people I know personally tell me they still like Trump I'm like "Have you heard him speak?" I just don't get it. They must want to watch the world burn.
Trump has no chance heck he shut down Republican primaries because it was possible that he wouldn't even get the Republican nomination and he's the party leader.
Why are Republicans and mostly Trump working so hard for Russia. Isn't he supposed to be the President of the United States instead? #TraitorInChief
Shut up!! We’re definitely voting just for TRUMP!!
So which would look worse for trump. Saving countless lives and suppressing COVID (like nearly every other competent country so far) while temporarily tanking the economy, or letting 150,000+ die while, get this, STILL tanking the economy
If Trump got the chance Moscow Mitch would ramrod it through the Senate on Jan 19th.
Trump is now justifying the deaths of those who have died — many of whom are elderly.  This is sickening to listen to.
Firing trump will not get rid of the virus. How stupid
This man Trump is using this press conference he called “urgently” to tell us how bad other countries are doing with corona 😂😂 not the usa with 60k new cases a day and 1k deaths, but Japan, Israel and Latam lol no shame ffs
Trump.
Oh, &amp; I'd be remiss if I didn't add that all of this would've been true with or without COVID-19 but COVID-19 pandemic &amp; the historic failure of Trump's gov in handling it (or success, - I still think they partly purposefully let it get this bad) makes this that much more urgent.
A story about Trump's tweet today and why it's illegal and Q&amp;A about it. Thought it might be helpful.
It's sad to see ppl leveraging #HermanCain's death as a means to promote the mast vs. anti-mask debate. This man died, his family is grieving.   I'm pro-mask, anti-Trump and identify as a progressive Democrat.. but man. The left really needs to stop vilifying the right like this.
Sounds like he was extremely stupid to not be wearing a mask during a pandemic then, don't you think? Anyway, Trump's quack doctor said it's a cure so why didn't it work?
Yes &amp; no. Had Trump, Fox News, GOP taken this shit seriously last yr, took the necessary precautions &amp; not politicized the crap out of it &amp; required a mask mandate outside of the home, maybe these idiots who boast about not wearing a mask, wouldn't get sick &amp; die from COVID-19.
I guess I don't see the point of your tweet either? Like Trump is gonna stop acting like a petty dictator because people are settling for biden? Or people who feel disenfranchised by the system are gonna be like "Wow they are being upfront the system sucks I am gonna vote now!"
Til we get Tom Cotton coasting off of racist Republicans' nostalgia for the Trump years? Because that's terrifying. So... hopefully  is up to the task here, because he has a lot of work to do to not only clean up after Trump, but prevent the next one.
Now’s not the time, but you don’t really seem to have a problem with Trump so go ahead and vote third party - that’s a vote that historically helps the incumbent. If you feel this way you should immediately log off and start knocking on doors
Oh a sexist for Trump, how novel.  And you see nothing wrong with the way you just responded, do you, given that you disagree with her. Wonder if your mother and grandmother would approve of you talking to a woman that way?  Don’t kid yourself.

We need to, over the next four years (assuming Trump loses and actually leaves), start passing laws to enshrine our norms surrounding presidents into law. No more running without immediately releasing tax returns. No more being able to run any kind of business while running.
You miss a president who can put lipstick on a pig. Trump is trash, but he’s so dangerous because of your party’s decades long attack on democracy and the feckless Democrats working only for their corporate bosses.
I live in Colorado where we’ve been using mail-in ballots as an option since 2014 and it’s shown to be at least as secure as in-person voting and yields a larger turnout. Which, if Trump is right about the silent majority, wouldn’t the GOP want as many people to vote as possible.
The November election will be an absolute SHAM and I am URGING every Patriotic American who supports President Trump to BOYCOTT the election by refusing to vote.
Cool, vote third party and watch when Biden or Trump is elected
The more powerful the resistance against Trump becomes, the more agitated he becomes, &amp; the more racism he spews! He doesn't deserve to be called "President," he should be referred to as "the impeached President!". That's what he is. Any other Pres. would have been removed by now

A related question - did any of them have reputations to uphold before Trump?
“The Catholic Church in the United States has long advocated for the Dreamers and we will continue to stand with them,” said Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles.
Also none of these people said boo when we started locking brown kids up in cages even under Obama, and then when the program expanded to taking away children from their parents under Trump they applauded it.  So, let's not pretend that we haven't always had a fascist undertone.
Every time Trump talks his mouth looks like he's giving someone a blow job.
Well, when you play with fire and everybody that doesn't think exactly like you has been telling you it's fire for *at lest* five years (and Trump didn't come out of the clear blue sky, so that's being real generous).... you're gonna get burned.

President Trump does NOT have the authority to move the election. His suggesting otherwise is a dangerous and unprecedented power grab at denying you YOUR rights during a pandemic. He's willing to do anything to stay in office. We must take this threat to our Democracy seriously.
I'm not blinded.  Biden is not the best speaker and often makes gaffs.  Trump is WILLFULLY IGNORANT. He is an unintelligent grifter...and you are the mark.  You are being used.
The problem is that the remaining moderate Dems are believing that  Joe Biden will be a moderate Dem president and worth it to dump Trump.  The indications are that, even if he is able to remain competent and is not removed, he will have a far left VP and cow to the far left
I think Trump just enjoys bugging the hell out of libs since they dealt him so much pain. I know him. If he loses in 2020 he will cause them pain like they never knew. He doesnt like to lose. They will hurt for a very long time.
I know this young man. He was cool before this. Now he’s helping recruit high school &amp; college students to work the polls in November (because, yes, Trump, the election will go on whether or not you were joking about killing representative democracy).
Really think about this for a minute. Trump has just admitted in front of God and everybody that he's done such a bad job as Prez, he's the first one in history who could not hand off government to his successor.

That’s not fair. Trump is more than responsible for most of the COVID deaths...but COVIDiots, like Cain, absolutely made their choices and have to live or die with the consequences.
Putin is playing a chess game with our Constitution.  Trump, McConnell and Bar are pawns.  We need a master chess strategy to defeat Putin.  Get ready.
Will do! Be there with no mask standing at the front door to see everyone! Trump 2020
trump would rather burn it all down than lose. He doesn’t care about our democracy or Americans, only himself. November can’t get here fast enough.
Mail in ballots are only for trump supporters, apparently.
Ffs... trump cannot delay the election.  Only congress can, and they’re already pushing back on any suggestion of that happening.

If Trump is able to say he is the sole reason for the economy when the numbers are good, he should also take total responsibility when it’s this bad, right? And if not, then doesn’t that just prove that he didn’t have much of a role in the economy in the first place?
That’s trump making America great again. What’s the problem?  Also he profited off of the deal probably on the front end and the back end, just like he is supposed to, right?

The real reason  wants to delay the 2020 election is because he wants to delay going to prison!  You see Donald knows he’s in deep shit with the #sdny after he is out of office! He and the whole trump crime family is going to prison!
Following trump, will they ever learn!
Today in presidential history: 1. Obama delivers amazing eulogy for John Lewis, an American hero. 2. Trump killed Herman Cain, former leading GOP candidate for President.
Why does the American public fall for trump’s “distraction of the day” repeatedly? We all know he tweeted about the election today to distract everyone from the disastrous GDP contraction. Stop taking the bait!
I don’t watch Trump anymore. Just you and Sarah.
If they want to win, the GOP incumbents and candidates will soon jump off the Trump train-wreck!
Funny how trump’s tweet about delaying the elec came 15 mins after release of the worst economic report in US history.  It would take action by both houses of Congress.  A delay beyond Dec would require a constitutional amendment.    Not happening.
Trump caused his death. He went to Tulsa without a mask for Trump!

Yes, we've fallen some. But Trump proved we were already a lot lower than some of us realized or admitted.
Yeah I thought the same when tRump didn't attend John Lewis's funeral but that's how he rolls
We all know the trump cult has no evidence regarding any of the harebrained conspiracy theories they spout.  That's why the answer is always "look it up", rather than, ya know, actual evidence.
Its fed by a Qanon conspiracy theroy investigated by the trump administration to deflect and protect the ineptness of a lying President.
Your asking us about a foreign Polucy - What the fuck is that all about?!!!! In every case - tRump does the WRONG THING! #WhatAFuckingMORON
He's today's Jim Jones for some ppl. They are drinking the tRUMP cyanide.
Why do you make a big deal if Trump both tweets a ton or very little over a period of time? Does his tweet frequency really correspond to anything?
Cain was black, therefore, trump will never think anything about him.  Even the blacks who adore trump are trash people to trump.
Oh you mean the tRump virus 🦠- these flareups wouldn’t be bad if you had done your job in January and February - fake news that trump administration is doing well (or anything frankly) What a fucking disaster. tRump lies and gives inaccurate info including virus &amp; poll standing!
13,000 likes for Laura ingraham that's terrible. Losing in every possible way. Deceit, lie propaganda, misinformation, tRump as z kissing. Finally catching up as your ratings drop into a chasm of no return.  #imgrahamisanasz #TrumpFailedAmerica  #foxnewsliars  #FoxFakes
Trump is being the usual Trump, floating goofball ideas as though they are legit and he's seriously considering them. I'm quite sure his advisors have made it clear it's not happening. He doesn't care. He just likes the shock and awe he can create. It's what he gets off on.
Did you hear Trump say that? Think for yourself! Oh sorry, I forgot you are a Republican.
He threw his life away for a tRUMP ideology - that makes no sense.
Perspective | My entire state votes by mail. Sorry, Mr. President. It works great.
As much as the left is trying to provoke a civil war, in cities like Portland, I seriously doubt it will happen. We will vote Trump out for sure, just like we voted Clinton in in 2016.
I still want to know why you look like Trump. I think you have a problem.
Funny but you only mentioned something that you blame Democrats of. Are you concerned about voter suppression Liz? What about the machines that are purchased from people that support Donald Trump, does that concern you at all? You people are absolutely freaking unbelievable.
As a Democrat, I have to ask you, what are we going to do when Trump and his followers cancel the election; thus, again kicking sand in our face? We hear our leaders talk tough, but 😑 meh.. Flynn is free, Stone is free, storm troopers continue to abuse us.
Everything tRUMP touches dies is the title of a book. The author hit it on the nose it's so true.  If you are smart you want no part of Donald J Trump.
"Trump Administration Easing More Obama-Era Oil and Gas Rules" by The Associated Press via NYT
You must be related to Donald Trump, you said that lie as if you had true conviction.
I'm stunned we haven't reached a point where Trump taunts blue states with that stupid electorial map.
Pres. Trump attempting to interfere with the election process again.  Please report.
Herman Caine attended your ridiculous rally in Tulsa where tRumpies did not wear masks and many rally personnel were already infected - he got the virus at this stupid rally and now he’s dead. He followed tRump right into his grave.
Says the bootlicker who ran to #MangoMussolini for a job. Calls tRump a conman and a fraud, runs to get a job. Then as a senator votes with him all the time. Then turns around and votes for removal from office. You are seriously confused there Mitt.
Trump is pushing their anxiety buttons daily!
I realize more everyday that the polls are being manipulated.  no one in their right mind would vote for Biden, including the Trump hating dems.  Biden, Bernie, AOC, Warren would ruin this country even before their VP takes over.
Hannity and Mnuchin can't buy what was left of the middle classes houses out of foreclosure until trump and the GOP bankrupt them.
What about all the "The global pain. loss and uncertainty  and headache and dreams..." that was destroyed by the Obama administration? Or is it only an issue when the scary red man commits war crimes. How many countries did obama attack? How many has trump?
That shows me everything I need to know about Nap. He's a petulant jerk. Trump often tweets suggestions and his thoughts with no real meaning and only a shark would jump at that bait to render ridicule. I would advance that Nap is projecting. He certainly displays those traits!
There are ZERO Biden signs in Colorado. A few Bernie and way more Trump that’s last election.
Using a mans death to make a political statement against Trump. You’re sick.
Maybe you should pray that you get some mental healthcare, so you won’t kill anymore innocent people with your Covid. You should pray that the decent, hard working people with jobs vote Trump out of office, or you won’t get your welfare check. 150,000 are dead because of you..
Oh. Kind of like Trump only discussing politics while 151, 570 people have died to get himself re-elected? Oh, and trying to delay the election in November because he's failing?!

Trump really reset the standard for presidential behavior with John McCain, right
Understood, and I agree.  So lumping trump supporters with alcoholics isn't fair.  I finally agree with you.  I love some trump supporters I know, but I excuse them for that.   I see what you mean…  still I'd be suspicious of undiscovered human failings with a trump supporter…
marco "WISHES" trump hadn't said that.  He was able to say that because of you, you mouse-sized, shriveled-brain, cowering, mangy dog.
idk how this take isn't all over the place, but Donald Trump literally killed Herman Cain. He's not dead because of some abstract thing, he's dead because of the rally in Tulsa.
Same in Colorado. It’s only pure ignorance to not have mail in voting. Considering we are the only country that doesn’t allow a day off for voting, it’s the only logical way. Trump is a fucking lunatic, and he knows he is done!
I'm disgusted that anyone is questioning Obama's eulogy for John Lewis, because politics were mentioned. It's quite sickening because Trump only talks politics while 151,000 people have died.
It’s not safe to do either, but hey Trump is making America great again, and that all that matters. Isn’t fun how 40 years of Republicans doing nothing has snowballed into an impossible situation? No healthcare, no social welfare backups, no education, no PPE, and no hope.

In 97 days we have to choose America, not Trump! Then things will get even worse until January 20, 2021. When he's gone, we can pick up what's left and try to #BuildBackBetter. I wonder if I'll still be alive and what will remain. I hope I make it!

Good question!  The flaw is twisting your logic around to justify supporting someone as obviously faulted as Trump.  Believing what you want to believe.  Finding "TRUTH” in websites that match your preexisting inner beliefs.  Feeling persecuted by honest reporting.
Liberal logic: If you vote for Trump you're a racist and a white supremacist, even if you are black! In fact, if they don't vote for Biden then "you ain't black" and a white Biden voter is blacker on the inside than you are! You can't debate rationally with that level of crazy.
We should renovate the West Wing. Let's start by removing Trump.

Upon closer reflection I see your point of likening a trump supporter to alcoholics, but only in that both things are bad.  So it’s not a very interesting comparison and not one I intended to make.

It's a well known scientific fact that people should be wearing masks where social distancing is not possible. Trump's failed leadership caused people at the Tusla rally to not wear masks.  Better analogy: if the driver didn't grow up in an alcoholic home, he might not have DUIed

Yeah, I don’t think tRump is thinking through his positions.
To help Christ fight the One World Order is why they say we need "More Jesus" instead of more government accountability.  This is why the say "everybody in power is corrupt" when you point out Trump's many failures.
Why has the Christian Right stopped valuing family values? Like, why do we they still plan to vote for Trump &amp; the anti-science stooges who support him? One word answer: RELIGION  They ascribe to a theology called One World Order or New World Order.

and if we’re going by normal voting trends like “people blame the prez for the economy”, then incumbency is also usually a huge advantage. also, this isn’t a normal economic downtown, covid/the shutdowns just give the right another way to blame the dems for it instead of trump
Amen  Obama was most corrupt President in US History. Having orchestrated the attempted coup d’etat to unseat President Trump, he ranks up there with Emperor Caligula in Ancient Rome as being one of the most diabolical of all world leaders.

Shame that someone who had beaten the odds, would have allowed himself to be exposed at Trump's Tulsa rally where there were few masks and no social distancing.   Goodbye Herman Cain. You added a lot of color and excitement to American politics.
And to think the left got mad when Pres Trump spoke in the Rose Garden about his sleepy creepy brain dead opponent.
how many conservatives do you actually know? i’m just telling you the whole “people blame the president for the economy” isn’t true anymore. those people don’t blame trump. his support among the right is higher than ever. normal analysis of voting trends doesn’t work anymore.

Too dangerous for adults to vote, but safe enough to send your babies to school.   Rex was right.  Fucking moron:  Trump’s call to ‘delay’ the election is a distraction — but it’s also a serious threat -
killed  by holding his rally and encouraging people to not wear masks. Unfortunately, Herman Cain signed a waiver so Trump can't be held responsible for killing a man. #TrumpKillsUS #TrumpMurderedCain
You think Trump posted that? He talked trash about him several months ago. God it must be a rough time for you right now.
Does anyone still honestly believe Trump won't lie to get what he wants?
The only way he would do this is if he can make a deal that nobody (SDNY) will prosecute him.  If we see Biden winning in a landslide I can’t see anyone being willing to let Trump get out of jail free
A dear friend from high school posted this comment on a Breitbart feed: “President Trump, we have faith you are hearing us. It’s simple. Make the medicine that we know works available. No vaccines sir. No one is going to get one anyway. No Republican or Christian anyway. 1/

biden needs support from the left to win, cuz the right has dug in on trump. people are less motivated overall to go out and vote than they were in 2016. i hate trump but i think having any kind of confidence that biden’s got this in the bag is insane.

Republicans are gonna regret letting Trump run their party into the ground when they lose the White House and Senate this fall 😂
He's right. If Trump would have worn a mask and encouraged others to do so, Herman might still be alive. It's like wearing a seatbelt.

Incredible.  If Trump had any respect for humanity he would be alive (along with the rest of the 150k).
Maybe you should come up with policies or a platform as opposed to Trump retweets and conspiracy theories.

It’s crazy to think that Herman Cain could have got Covid at a Trump rally and 2weeks later has passed away.
Have fun in your Parler circle jerk. All the weird conservatives who were told by trump that everyone is out to get them so they went to a new app so they could all just agree with each other without having to be inconvenienced by being told they’re wrong
My guess is to make Trump look bad and get him out of office after the attempted coup did not work or allegations of everything that Hillary and Barrack actually did also did not work.
Same goes for saying something even remotely conservative or patriotic. The conversation will have zero to do with Trump but the unhinged Left sees Trump everywhere they turn. He haunts them. Hard to believe THEY obsess about Trump even more than Trump obsesses about Trump! 🤣
President Trump lives on Twitter. Just stop.
so, so, so many people on the right think covid is overblown/“politicized” &amp; the resulting economic disaster is the fault of the dems for “forcing shutdowns”. trump voters from 16 are still trump voters in 20, but libs and leftists are less motivated for biden than for hillary
Explain. Are you threatened by the questioning of credentials of the "experts" Trump likes?
Trump unknowingly honored the Congressman by not dishonoring him with his presence.
I was musing whether cops would stop armed Trump supporters from committing political violence.
Checks and balances. Twitter is freaking out because of Trump Tweets, but let's remember that our system, in the main, works when it comes to this kind of faux-authoritarian nonsense.  Trump tweeted that to dominate the news cycle once again and the sad thing is it always works.
It feels to me like he's doing the, "Well, I have a black friend, too!" thing.  No matter that he caused Cain to get Covid. It's STILL 100% all about Trump.
Very similar acts, deflection is literally deflecting guilt to appear innocent. Projection is to outwardly chastise someone for the things you are guiltily of. Trump is also a master of gaslighting, which has made many supporters believe things they know are not true.
Trump is trying to depress the vote on November 3rd by implying he will delay the election and interfere with mail in ballots. This is intentional and even though he will likely not carry this out the mere implication is enough to depress the vote and spread cynicism.
Trump paid someone else to take his civics class. He’s a moron!
If Trump would have paid his respects in person he would have been demonized by the left &amp; given msm fodder for their Hate.
Will you accept Colorado election results on November? We vote by mail here, if you remember. What if Trump loses CO? What will you do? Back the Secretary of State of CO or back Trump? Does it depend on how your election goes?
This is what trump would like to distract us from today.     “John Lewis devoted his time on this Earth (to) fighting the very attacks on democracy and what's best in America that we're seeing circulate right now."
My sis posted on FB the day after “some of the best people I know voted for Trump/Clinton and if you are angry at people voting differently you are the problem” told her it was emotionally manipulative. Somehow I ended up apologizing and our relationship has never been the same.

If you can show me credible doctors saying it then I'll admit to that.  It appears the only doctors willing to say Hydroxycloroquine either work under Trump/anti maskers or ... alien DNA doctors?  I think the link I sent explains why Trump would be so for the sale of...
Well yes, I see what you are trying to say, though when I'm making a contrast with Trump, it doesn't really undermine my point!
Because Trump supporters aren’t worth my time.  Or anyone’s time.  You all are lost.

Trump and Republicans should memorialize Cain the same way they would treat any Republican who takes Coronavirus seriously by calling him a RINO who hates freedom and sides with the "Enemies of The Homeland" like antifa and Democrats and journalists and mask-wearers.
Trump supporters are so blinded by racism.
Trump can’t and will never compare.
Yes. If we get rid of trump in nov but if we don’t continue to fight against racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, the violence that is white supremacy—all so deeply rooted in this country—we’ll have another trump someday.  #resist

Only Lying Don Trump could accomplish this.
Today, Pres. Clinton, Pres. Bush, &amp; Pres. Obama helped us bid farewell to John Lewis  Today, Pres. Trump hawked a random pizza company, and suggested we move the Nov. 2020 general election for which he's polling overwhelmingly poorly.   Today, the GOP was absent from both events.
I'm no fan of Trump but isolationist economic policy has been on the economic agenda's of the big European nations and Asian countries for years. I don't really attribute the tariffs to him but to the right-wing changes that have been sweeping the globe for 15+ years.
That Trump. He’s such a comedian.
Trump wants kids in schools and parents not to vote. That’s the tweet.
He should move to Russia. I hear they have beds for all the tRump's there...

I'm not convinced that Trump engaged in pedo acts, based on the past accusations and frankly his own actions I believe Trumps acts would be more of a force able rape or rape by power or status. Again, their is no proof, just circumstancal evidence.
Harris was a great prosecutor and if she became the first female president it would be fantastic. However, during the debates, all I remember is that she was really anti-trump. I'm still not sure what her platform is as of this moment.
White America was outraged about a black president.  Trump was their response.
I'm just wondering about those who still "support Trump because the economy is doing well." Do they read...or?
Trump killed him!!

Impeachment had to happen. Full stop.   Trump is a menace.   You may still buy into the libertarian fallacy that the President doesn’t affect the daily lives of Americans, but if that was ever true, it’s nonsense now.   At least 25% of voters accept what he says.
This is one of my favorite movies and I think this is something a lot of us have been thinking:  V for Vendetta predicted the Trump Administration.
I thought we were there already? I was starting to assume that it was the GOP saying collectively, "Not it" with the slower ones getting picked. For example, I assume Gohmert, Gaetz, and Nunes will be on Trump 2.0 if that awful day happens. (GOP rejects.)
If I never hear the name tRump, it will be a glorious day!
We work? Trump isn’t. He muddies the water. Sends mixed messages and really sees Covid as a threat to his re-election. Yes failed leadership on his part. And you a slavish follower. Begone
Please get the testing ramped up so we can get this under control!!! Push trump in the ass this is ridiculous!!
Donald Trump’s threat to delay or change the 2020 election is empty and absurd. Our election will be on November 3rd and it’s more important than ever to get out to vote and elect Joe Biden.
I feel good that we will be rid of Trump should we all make it to Inauguration Day...but “should” cannot be assumed and all the good words and polls mean nothing with thugs attack protesters in the street and a virus spreads relentlessly throughout the land.
Here's the thing:  Cain's mask stance was a symptom of a larger issue - the Trump administration's abysmal handling of a global pandemic, partially out of spite for the previous president. We risk some real bootstrap shit if we focus only on masks. I'm not commenting on Cain.
Trump, Barr, Pompeo, McConnell, Jordan, Gaetz, Gohmert, Graham...we have many George Wallaces now. Way too many.
Wow you really got him on this one. Damn how will trump come back from doing something illegal
Just another Trump lie. Absentee and mail in voting are the same.
No. They had to because Trump did nothing to contain the virus in January and now 150,000+ Americans are unnecessarily dead. Hilarious! Ps- S Korea, Japan, New Zealand &amp; others contained covid &amp; are now operating normally, because they don't have a dipshit con artist in charge.
I wonder what would happen if Putin is deposed before Trump is defeated? Where would he flee to then? North Korea?

You'll be a supporter of mail-in voting then, yay, knew you were not with Trump. Well done.
Trump’s idol, Hitler was defeated because he started too many battles.  is losing on Every front. His Fascist graffiti squad is being watched by the world, which is losing. Trump is a total failure and will fail this also. The GOP has 90 days of terror left.
You’re part of the reason we can’t make change on a federal level. But whatever, don’t vote. That’s what they want. So pls also don’t say shit if trump is re-elected &amp; things continue to go horribly.
I think you misunderstood. Apparently, trump makes everyone sign an NDA’s.

The worse and most corrupt president in the United States history   And you don’t like trump because facts are coming to surface
I thought POTUS was used as opposed to Trump to make the Q posts sound more “official” but that’s JMO.
article titled: Republicans openly challenge Trump's tweet on delaying election  Quotes:  "I don't think that's...particularly good.." Graham "I doubt it gets...traction" Thune "Not answering any questions" Ernst  This blind drive for "balance" where media goes wrong.

Trump is literally complaining about how bad mail in ballots while making them bad
"...what The AP found in an analysis of more than 200 arrests: even those accused of breaking the law during the liberal city’s nightly rallies don’t neatly fit into President Donald Trump’s depiction of protesters as “"anarchists and agitators."”

Funny how you blame trump! That what the news told you funny how the wyhuan lab was funded by the Obama administration but that’s just a fact!
Trump or America didn’t create COVID19. We want what you want to find the cure for COVID19. We want to return to work &amp; our children return to school under a CONTROLLED COVID19. We want to live &amp; not watch our love ones &amp; neighbors suffer &amp; die. Believe this
They're not going to cut away from saying goodbye to a hero to give Trump time.  He's nuts and a complete asshole.
If feel bad for his victims. All the people he infected (and infect them, he certainly did). He knew what he was doing and he did it anyways. The science was clear. No tears for Herman, but Trump did provide the nails for the coffin.
I believe in America.  Trump has held up a mirror to Americans so we can see what we are made of.  We are tougher than Putin imagines.
Fascinating how it’s ok for Trump to “throw punches” when defending himself and even call others names in an attempt to shame them. But.....it’s not ok for Tapper to defend himself, frankly with poise and consideration.What? All of a sudden Herman Cain is righteous?  He is/was just a littke brughter tgan Trump
we must hold Trump responsible for suggesting the vote be delayed. Impeachable offense... Congress please do your job! #impeachthelawbreakingdictatorwannabe
Not to mention the lies. Local Dem leadership closed polling places, nor Republicans and it's impossible for it to have been Trump.  Ignorance and Fake News at best
For the Dems, It’s all come down to we don’t care about who is President, we just don’t want Trump. I know some conservatives that don’t want Trump to win only because how bad things might be if he was re-elected. Now that’s Democracy!!
Jason, millions of folks believe Trump is the worse President in history and a lying criminal. When asked about Biden’s qualifications to be President, you replied “better than Trump”. That’s quite the endorsement!  Biden’s better than a criminal.
Trump is so desperate he tries blaming mail in ballots, trying to change the election date, anything to avoid the obvious. He is a goner.

It always takes at least two to three weeks for states to certify their election results. What you see is trump blowing out his ass as usual.
Actually he lost his black friend due to trump’s insistence on a mask fee rally. So in effect, trump murdered him.
And trump doesn’t? Ever listen to him? Can’t put three words together in a coherent sentence.

That’s trump making America great again. What’s the problem?  Also he profited off of the deal probably on the front end and the back end, just like he is supposed to, right?
If they want to win, the GOP incumbents and candidates will soon jump off the Trump train-wreck!
To help Christ fight the One World Order is why they say we need "More Jesus" instead of more government accountability.  This is why the say "everybody in power is corrupt" when you point out Trump's many failures.
Why has the Christian Right stopped valuing family values? Like, why do we they still plan to vote for Trump &amp; the anti-science stooges who support him? One word answer: RELIGION  They ascribe to a theology called One World Order or New World Order.

It sounds a lot like that guy who does a great impersonation of Trump and is hilarious. I can’t remember his name at the moment but, even though I can’t stand Trump, I don’t think is real. Also, that funny guy didn’t make this either, it’s one of his existing impersonations.
Trump didn’t start this and it won’t end when he’s out of office. He just mobilized it to his advantage. In fact it could get worse as the people who adore him feel threatened especially with a diverse cabinet under a Dem president. We’ve got a lot of work to do as a country.
You are so amazing! You are the only Trump I’d like to see in office. The book is excellent.
Don’t you watch the news.  Even Swalwell who used to say that it was a conspiracy to say that Obama spied on Trump has now moved to the line that it was right to spy on Trump.   Come on, I can’t discuss things with you if you don’t even know current developments
Funny you use Nixon as an example.   He got caught spying on his political adversaries as well.   What Obama and company have done makes that look like child’s play.   Also, it is not a fact that Trump sold us out to Russia.  It’s an assumption, mostly to cover their arses.
The Apostle John wrote that this would happen in the Book of Revelations. Believers must turn their back on God in order for Babylon(Western World) to fall and for the AntiChrist to take power. Trump is merely a Puppet of Satan in this time before the 7 years of Tribulation!

I was particularly tickled when Trump involved The Bush Administration for contradicting support, adding, 'no friends of mine....' Right before he said that I thought, 'Even the former Bush administration hates you. You don't even compare to their evil.'
Because conservatives, Republicans/Trumpublicans, right wing nut jobs, Trumpsters, Trumpers, "Always Trump"'ers, etc always like to cherry pick the parts of the Bible that they interpret differently so that it applies to whatever bullshit they want to further their agendas on.

To my fellow Colorado liberals/leftists, regardless of your party affiliations (or lack thereof), help vote out the Trump asskisser, Cory Gardner!  He is a card-carrying member of the Trumpublican GOP party.

Trump continues to be iresponsible with false covid ads, and withdrawing troops just to please Putin.
Have you even listened to Trump speak? You really aren’t very bright are you.
almost certainly!  via
I recall Trump mentioning diabetes a long time ago
Trump defends Germany withdrawal  The only one delinquent here is Trump. He is doing it to please Putin. The man is a threat to our National Security.
Trump says he has not spoken to Putin about alleged Russian bounties on U.S. troops  Trump said nothing but kiss Putin's ass. trump is a fool and Putin knows it.
'Slap in the face': Romney blasts troop withdrawal from Germany  trump was on the phone with Russia. So of course trump plays the puppet and withdraws troops to please Putin again. This administration is just corrupt and has to go.
Trump, Mnuchin float short-term deal as relief talks stall  kicking it down the road does not work. this is typical of our government who just can not function.
I don't think Republicans realize anything. Certainly not the concept of a history book being made in the future. Who needs to think about history? When Donald j Trump is the president. I almost feel bad for them. Keyword being almost. 😂🤣😂🤣
McConnell suggests Dems are trying to 'sabotage' the next coronavirus bill  leave to McConnell and the GOP ran senate to throw blame. It is common for them and trump to do so. They added FBI bldg. money, border wall money which is not a covid priority.
Trump says he has not spoken to Putin about alleged Russian bounties on U.S. troops  was to afraid to. the man is spineless. talks a big song and dance and just pees his pants.
Trump administration to send federal agents to Cleveland, Detroit and Milwaukee  what the heel for. More trump photo ops? The states have their own national guard. They do not need thugs of trump.

Why not? He may not accept responsibility but the Buck stops at his golf cart! Trump was in charge of protecting the USA from the Trump Virus and he failed BIGLY! He ignored it and delayed taking proactive action. This is why the USA leads the world in cases and deaths.
One of my problems with Trump has been, if he makes statements like this in public, what is he saying in private? A person who looks down on minorities and low-income families has NO business running our country. If you support this racist rhetoric, YOU are part of the problem.
Election must be coming up?  Santa Trump is flying around on Air Force 1 handing out money!
ugh, do you not see the whole point here, yes, all these mega billionaires could donate, what is more important, ending the GOP and trump destruction of American or giving some money that might last a month or two - him donating to defeat trump and the GOP will last forever.
This is INFURIATING!   Trump clearly says he doesn’t have a problem with Russian bounties or supplying weapons to the Taliban because “we did it too!” That was against the Soviets, this is a different time, and Russia is actively working against us on ALL fronts! #TraitorTrump
Exactly! Trump* and the GOP are the party( if you can even call them that) of hate, cruelty and racism‼️
Where is this "proof"?  I mean if proof is shown against Trump, it's "fake news", but usually the only "proof" we get to the contrary is "Believe me", so if there is actual proof, let's see itA Trump lackey.

His sisters not a judge anymore! No more mistrial defense. Or interferences.
“Respectable” conservatives like Calabresi have been telling me for 4½ years I was hysterically overreacting when I called Trump fascistic. “Trump Derangement Syndrome!” “You said that about Romney too!” (Nope.)  If they’ve finally realized they were wrong, great—but maybe say so
Still waiting for Trump's national plan to lower the COVID Rates, testing and contract tracing, make sure schools are safe and for us to have a safe national election.  When is he going to release?
The courthouse firestarter apprehended in Portland was found to be tied to a white supremacist, Aryan, racist group. He was directed by the far right to incite violence among the peaceful protesters. You're a moron. tRump's a racist. #TrumpleThinSkin

Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
trump:  It's too dangerous to hold our election in November.  Also trump:  It's safe enough to send your babies to school right now.

You are dying breed, wrong side of history! You have and your Con man Trump has made China a more reliable country as compared to USA!
Rules for thee but not for me! Anyway, Trump’s tweet about delaying the 2020 election has probably already cured covid.
Im so sick and tired of these I voted Republican all my life and voted for trump because he was the lesser of two evils bullshitters. now months before his term ends with lowered chances of re-election gop voters have seen the light! FUCK YOU! Y’all made this. #FederalistSociety
Nah. Trump fully supports Absentee Ballots.  Let everyone vote absentee. That way we can ensure safety.
The people that were caught red handed trying to burn the courthouse in Portland were all associated with the firestarter, who was found out to be an Aryan, far right, white supremacist, fascist, Trump supporter. He was directed by the far right to create a riot. So there's that.
Also in spring 2016, Trump threatened violence by his supporters in order to discourage a delegate revolt at the 2016 GOP convention. That wasn’t “fascistic” enough for Mr. Calabresi, but this morning’s tweet is?  Again: I welcome his support. But I’d also appreciate a reckoning.
A year or so ago, my 81 year old trump supporting mother told me Tucker Carlson speaks her language. I’ll never forget it as long as I live.

Well, I am a conservative. That's the point.  Regardless, it appears that  did oppose Trump's Tweet today.
is GOING DOWN... Number of Americans who fervently oppose Trump's reelection approaches point of no return  #SmartNews
...after he said in a GOP debate that he’d order a war crime (killing families of terrorists), and insisted generals would follow his illegal order because he would be a “strong” leader. Did Mr. Calabresi miss that debate? (It was the one where Trump also talked about his penis.)
Resistance libs love to talk about how they miss "not having to think about the president" when like they don't have to now either. They read about whatever trump is doing and say UGH I HATE HIM SO MUCH and then go back to their normal lives because it doesn't affect them
tRump deflecting his minions’ attention back to Obama. It’s classic penis envy - Obama was the greatest President in recent history and tRump is the worst in all of history so bad tells you how bad good was - not fooled - Obama is a gentleman &amp; a scholar #TrumpIsLosing 🏌️‍♂️📱🍔💩🤡
The Trump virus was already here. And you still aren’t doing shit! How much is the bounty for a dead American? We know you don’t care about the Troops!!
Look, I welcome all converts, no matter how belated. But it would behoove folks like Mr. Calabresi to eventually acknowledge *they were wrong* to not see this coming, and gravely wrong to enable it. Trump has been “fascistic” all along. I first called him that in February 2016...
Trump 2020!!
Oh please. Y'all said that 4 years ago, and look at the shit Trump and Republicans have done to our country. He had 4 yrs. He's destroyed relationships w/ our allies. He's threatening to postpone the election. He's trampled our civil rights. He is destroying the planet.
Nope. Trump is a dweeb. He doesn't know enough about anything at all to "hate" it.
Be careful!  The trump family is looting the national treasures!
Sounds a lot like Trump's goon squad.
She's a Trump follower and watches Fox News, so of course she wouldn't have seen it. Not that, that matters anyway.
But that's not something trump has done that no other one has... that's just fulfilling the role of the office.
Which is worse:  Trump on TV or a tornado overhead?

Do you have ANY proof whatsoever his cancer came back? Do you have any explanation for why he was perfectly healthy walking around the Trump Tulsa rally in June? Give me a fucking break
Rad! Proud that my buddy  could set the *president of the United States* straight in this great op-ed about how easy and safe it is to run an election by mail, as we do in Colorado. No matter your political beliefs, the facts are crystal clear.
and you think those obama to trump voters are coming back to mush brain biden? lol
I don't think this decline and Trump getting Elected is a coincidence.
Lost my boy a few weeks ago. When we think the world should end, they remind us that pure love actually exists and we are worth it. Btw Trump doesn’t have a dog. Kinda explains a lot doesn’t it?
and you think those “normies” voted for trump because the economy (under obama) was benefiting them? you really think swing voters for trump were basing their decision on the economy? lol
I keep thinking we need the trump lookalike like the movie Dave to come in and make him look like an actual somewhat intelligent, caring human being! Too much to ask?
So would a biden presidency. You have given nothing other than orange man bad. If trump is so terrible, give me 5 things he has done that no other president has?

Trump doesn’t understand that the young aren’t the only ones who will be in schools, teachers, administrators, janitors, substitutes will not be immune, and neither will be the kids! That’s a lie, are you willing to bet your child’s life on Trump’s lies?
You want to shield your pals from lawsuits, cut unemployment, give money to big coprporatins and build a building to help Trump make more money.

The fact that the head of the Federalist Society just called for Trump's removal AFTER they got all their wingnut judges on the courts tells you they viewed him as a useful idiot all along.
I did.  And you’re right. O isn’t sincere. He’s fake - a puppet for others. Doesn’t care cuz he’s rich &amp; narcissistic. The worst narcissist to come on the political scene ever. And since.  Trump’s got a huge ego, but there’s a huge difference.

In other words , trump has no plan.  He’s good at making ultimatems, poor at guidelines, financing help for states dealing with the virus, and protecting the electorate.

ICYBN (In case you been nappin'): I've been predicting that Trump will try to delay or scrap the election. Today's tweet is a trial balloon. He and the puppeteers will learn where the resistance is, and how the move can be more effective. The move comes in Oct. Chaos is the goal.
So how is Trump acting now that he learned he can’t delay the election? Or has he accepted that yet? Are they still explaining it to him using small words?
I was furious at NPR because they reported Trump’s press conference saying that “ he’s asking Democrats to cooperate in getting help in terms of help for the unemployed. Nothing about Rs dragging their feet and trying to cut unemployment to $200 from $600.
Jason, millions of folks believe Trump is the worse President in history and a lying criminal. When asked about Biden’s qualifications to be President, you replied “better than Trump”. That’s quite the endorsement!  Biden’s better than a criminal.
Hard to disagree. I felt the same way during the first impeachment. It’s a sad day when I’d take Pence as president. But after Trump has tried to sabotage the election, he’s infringing on our constitution. We need to uphold our democracy no matter the cost.

I truly believe what Mary Trump said, that Donald Trump would have loved nothing better, than to have been the one with his knee on the neck of George Floyd. That is exactly what he is doing now, by suppressing the vote !
Saying that Trump "can't" delay the election is answering the wrong question. The real question is: What happens when he tries? Suppose one—or a few—governors go along with him? Saying "they can't" dodges the question again. What brand of chaos ensues?
More lies: The 46.7 miles of border wall that has so far been built (a meager 2.3 percent of the border itself), according to CBP, stands small in the shadow of the 654 miles of barriers that already existed along the southwest border before Trump took office.

Maybe consider the context before responding with your hot take on all Americans. I most definitely do NOT miss the Bush fam. The point was simple: Trump is such an egregious piece of shit that it makes you miss literally any other president.
Trump's already told us he doesn't kid and we know that is true because humor is a higher level of development and he's not there. Anytime someone says he was joking you can count on it being a lie.
Is it ironic that Cain died of the virus after attending Trump's need to do a rally in Tulsa?

His game is pathetic and we all know what he's doing. I feel for Biden and all he will have to address after the last 4 years. Biden will conduct transition regardless of Trump's tantrums. What's going to be horrifying is Trump and a lameduck GOP Senate and what they will attempt
You mean Sean Trump?
The government can run with Trump sitting in the WH. Biden can probably run the government from home and a decent office building in Dover or Wilmington.
mcconnell, barr and trump
Sigh. All the Trump humpers are dumb. It's so tiring explaining things to you, especially when you seem incapable of comprehending.  "Mail-in voting" (in most states) is the same as absentee voting. The voter requests a ballot.   Only In CO HI OR UT &amp; WA is it all vote-by-mail.
President Trump now virtually calling for a re-run of this November's Presidential election before it's started. Loser.
Kinda surprised Trump didn't try to make a comic company in the 90's that would have failed spectacularly...I bet he has an ungodly amount of pallets full of 90's Image number ones in some garage somewhere.
Well beehive is a new trump word. Was it a beautiful beehive or was it a very very very large beehive that no one has ever seen before

6:15pm Trump threatens if protestors do not clear the streets. The National Guard will go in and take care of things. He calls these protestors “professional Anarchists”. 😠
Just another Trump lie. It was the Trump virus.
And he caught  it at a Trump Rally in Tulsa.  And we only know this because Cain is famous.. How many others got sick and/or died to feed Trump’s ego that night? It is a tragedy that never should have happened.
I'm guessing they are trying to cast out the demon inside Trump, right? Did I get it right?
The Impeached  is worried about money &amp; other country’s  paying there way. The citizens of the United States file Class action suit against Trump and the Trump  children for reimbursement of golf trips and trips taken two other countries.

‘Undemocratic, Outrageous And Insulting’: Gov. Jared Polis Reacts To Trump’s Tweet About Delaying Election
You say people are lazy but create a system where they make more to stay home? But don’t understand why people say raise minimum wage. No your bill was dumb. Then the deadline is here and y’all haven’t late talks. Trump blames Pelosi and Pelosi trump. These are the best minds???
A Trump presidency 🤦🏼‍♀️
Even though we're dealing with a pandemic right now, y'all do know people have a choice to participate in group gatherings? To blame President Trump is pure ignorance.
Trump’s tone....sounded like he was heavily drugged.  And his skin tone??
TRUMP PLEASE SHUT YOUR GOD DAMN MOUTH
Trump is this close 🤏to saying we should open schools so kids can get the virus and donate plasma. Like the human batteries in the Matrix. That would make more sense than saying kids are "virtually immune."  #TrumpCoronaRally
tRump and his GOP ...the shit they do is so exhausting and old news. We know...this is not new news but rather a new headline.  He has ruined this country.
Obama is a slimy liar and the agent provocateur in the ongoing attempt at a coup d’etat to unseat President Trump before the November Presidential Election.
No matter what though, a Trump win will make the left cry foul.  There’s really no way to get it right.  We are being set up for more chaos.
Indeed, Trump deranged health scare nazis have done quite a number on America. Hoax after hoax after hysterical stampede, just to get one man, at the expense of countless lives &amp; untold misery.  Once just cynical manipulative opportunists, Democrats are now a vicious evil plague.
HOORAY Tulsa.....NO MASKS required. Murder is on Trump!
Someone please make Trump stop
Trump is on msnbc now talking about delaying elections. Why do they even give him an audience? Who’s worse Teump or news station that let trump dpiel his shit for an hour or two a day
Lol. We cited credible studies, not crackpot quack doctors who believe in alien DNA and demon sperm.  He's a Trump supporter, he could have requested the hcq early on. But he's dead now.  We've not pushed any vaccine because none have been approved.  Trump has though.
What Trump jbasically said in this #WhiteHouse briefing is that WHEN the #election is held in November, and WHEN he loses, he will contest the results and try to drag it out for months if not years and refuse to leave the White House - so basically, become an illegal squatter.
Here in Colorado, everyone is mailed a ballot. However, you don't have to return it by mail. You can drop your ballot off in a ballot box at the county clerk's office or other designated locations. I highly recommend this given Trump's ongoing efforts to destroy the Post Office.
It's Trump's fault. #ItsTrumpsFault
Wait, what. Trump's argument against vote by mail is the post office fucked up and had some ballots get there too late. So we should not protect people's health by not allowing it instead of just appropriately funding the postal service?
The Marxist puppet Biden will never debate President Trump.
Trump is rambling rambling
Ut oh, we're now talking about smart people and stupid people...I wonder if there is a basket of stupid people, according to Trump.
Not all was bad some was good, one car had a BLM flag flying through the wind as they went pass me shouting fuck tRUMP.
YOUR GOING TO LOSE TRUMP
It's sort of like the Iraqi ballot in which Saddam Hussein got 98% of the votes - there's just one name on it, and you check Yes or No. For Trump, it would only have his name on it...
Watch Live: President Trump holding White House news conference
Trump puts himself first Here we go with the campaign rally
Okay it's no longer a press conference ...it's turned into a trump rally. I'm done
We've all been assuring ourselves that Trump can't delay the election, or that a delay past 1/20 means Pelosi takes over. But since when has Trump followed the rules? Everyone should read this and act. We have to stop this.
Lol Trump is just saying Republicans are working for all the things they are actively fighting against. He just lies with so little effort it's crazy.
So your telling me that if trump wins again there is a chance that I might get deported
Didn't your team try to sneak in $1.75 billion for a new FBI building to protect Trump's hotel interests and then pretend you had no idea that was in there? Or was that all just a dream? It couldn't be reality, because who would do something that stupid?
Because it has never been big enough for Democrats to steal elections with, until now. The fact that the Trump hating zealots are so anxious to have everything done through mail without any face-to-face verification says everything you need to know about why they want it.
Trump's presidency, is causing deaths.....and he WILL NOT USE MY CHILDREN AS GUINEA PIGS !!!!! .
China DID stop COVID-19 in their own country. They even provided us with the data we needed to do the same. You squandered your own opportunity stop it. You can’t blame China for your own incompetence. How about we start calling it the “Trump Virus”?  #TrumpVirus
did they reject his premise (that the election would be rigged) or just his conclusion? Seems to me like the premise is what Trump's trying to sell.
Trump’s let’s-trash-democracy bid to distract from day’s terrible economic news was rejected by every Republican I’ve seen: McConnell, Cruz, Rubio, McCarthy and also  And only Trump would say it on the day of voting-rights-champion John Lewis’ funeral. #cosen
He also should have eschewed going to Trump rallies, but RIP

Shorter Steven Calabresi take: "I've taken godawful, inexplicable, entirely partisan positions on Trump's innumerable crimes and other misdeeds for years now, but this one thing is finally a bridge too far."  I mean, good for him, but also, whatevs.
"It could have been stopped..." Did Trump just acknowledge phucked up?
Well. Okay then. I thought for sure they'd hold onto Trump with their cold dead fingers, anything to keep power.
That’s why we need trump to stop trying to ban mail in voting
The Federalist Society founder, is now calling on Trump to be impeached again for attempting to delay the election, any comment? Or are you going to continue to ignore the fact that you are supporting a racist dictator?
TRUMP IS FUCKING ILLITERATE!   He can't pronounce "Plasma" correctly!  I just.... UGH!!!!!!!!!  #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K #TrumpFailedAmerica
tRump just claimed that Oregon, Illinois, Washington are all having resurgences and that Florida and Texas are containing the virus. He just lies. #trumpvirus #voteblue #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #wewillvote #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K #TrumpKillsUS
Refused to wear a mask, went to trump’s Tulsa rally without one &amp; got COVID!
It is really baffling to me. When people I know personally tell me they still like Trump I'm like "Have you heard him speak?" I just don't get it. They must want to watch the world burn.
Trump has no chance heck he shut down Republican primaries because it was possible that he wouldn't even get the Republican nomination and he's the party leader.
Why are Republicans and mostly Trump working so hard for Russia. Isn't he supposed to be the President of the United States instead? #TraitorInChief
Shut up!! We’re definitely voting just for TRUMP!!
😆😂🤣  i thought lindsey graham knew Trump better!!!
So which would look worse for trump. Saving countless lives and suppressing COVID (like nearly every other competent country so far) while temporarily tanking the economy, or letting 150,000+ die while, get this, STILL tanking the economy
If Trump got the chance Moscow Mitch would ramrod it through the Senate on Jan 19th.
Trump is now justifying the deaths of those who have died — many of whom are elderly.  This is sickening to listen to.
Firing trump will not get rid of the virus. How stupid
This man Trump is using this press conference he called “urgently” to tell us how bad other countries are doing with corona 😂😂 not the usa with 60k new cases a day and 1k deaths, but Japan, Israel and Latam lol no shame ffs
Trump.
Oh, &amp; I'd be remiss if I didn't add that all of this would've been true with or without COVID-19 but COVID-19 pandemic &amp; the historic failure of Trump's gov in handling it (or success, - I still think they partly purposefully let it get this bad) makes this that much more urgent.
A story about Trump's tweet today and why it's illegal and Q&amp;A about it. Thought it might be helpful.
It's sad to see ppl leveraging #HermanCain's death as a means to promote the mast vs. anti-mask debate. This man died, his family is grieving.   I'm pro-mask, anti-Trump and identify as a progressive Democrat.. but man. The left really needs to stop vilifying the right like this.
Sounds like he was extremely stupid to not be wearing a mask during a pandemic then, don't you think? Anyway, Trump's quack doctor said it's a cure so why didn't it work?
Yes &amp; no. Had Trump, Fox News, GOP taken this shit seriously last yr, took the necessary precautions &amp; not politicized the crap out of it &amp; required a mask mandate outside of the home, maybe these idiots who boast about not wearing a mask, wouldn't get sick &amp; die from COVID-19.
I guess I don't see the point of your tweet either? Like Trump is gonna stop acting like a petty dictator because people are settling for biden? Or people who feel disenfranchised by the system are gonna be like "Wow they are being upfront the system sucks I am gonna vote now!"
Til we get Tom Cotton coasting off of racist Republicans' nostalgia for the Trump years? Because that's terrifying. So... hopefully  is up to the task here, because he has a lot of work to do to not only clean up after Trump, but prevent the next one.
Now’s not the time, but you don’t really seem to have a problem with Trump so go ahead and vote third party - that’s a vote that historically helps the incumbent. If you feel this way you should immediately log off and start knocking on doors
Oh a sexist for Trump, how novel.  And you see nothing wrong with the way you just responded, do you, given that you disagree with her. Wonder if your mother and grandmother would approve of you talking to a woman that way?  Don’t kid yourself.
Ranked choice voting. Voter's Bill of Rights. Student loan forgiveness. (Now I'm just ticking off my political fantasy wishes but like, the first part of all of this? Necessary to avoid another Trump. Just saying.)

So what shiny object is trump going to throw out there today during the #clownshow    Covid is dire, the economy has tanked..?   I guess #Hydroxychloroquine and moving, I mean stealing the election ?    What this space I guess.
We need to, over the next four years (assuming Trump loses and actually leaves), start passing laws to enshrine our norms surrounding presidents into law. No more running without immediately releasing tax returns. No more being able to run any kind of business while running.
You miss a president who can put lipstick on a pig. Trump is trash, but he’s so dangerous because of your party’s decades long attack on democracy and the feckless Democrats working only for their corporate bosses.
I live in Colorado where we’ve been using mail-in ballots as an option since 2014 and it’s shown to be at least as secure as in-person voting and yields a larger turnout. Which, if Trump is right about the silent majority, wouldn’t the GOP want as many people to vote as possible.
The November election will be an absolute SHAM and I am URGING every Patriotic American who supports President Trump to BOYCOTT the election by refusing to vote.
Cool, vote third party and watch when Biden or Trump is elected
The more powerful the resistance against Trump becomes, the more agitated he becomes, &amp; the more racism he spews! He doesn't deserve to be called "President," he should be referred to as "the impeached President!". That's what he is. Any other Pres. would have been removed by now
Green groups challenge Trump rollback of bedrock environmental law  #NEPA
It really isn’t. Trump is unhinged and Biden’s not a threat.
as they could have been (and yes, I'm saying that knowing every single awful thing that has happened the last few years) is because Trump is incompetent. Ivanka isn't incompetent. Tom Cotton isn't incompetent. Both are just as fascist but in prettier and more palatable packages.
Trump killed Mr. Cain because of trumps selfishness
Why Trump Has No Power to Postpone the 2020 Election
So like, great, thanks for paying attention now, but don't you dare stop at impeaching Trump and making sure he isn't re-elected, because holy hell Ivanka and Jared are still going to be in the country making who knows what political moves. Most of the reason things aren't as bad
A related question - did any of them have reputations to uphold before Trump?
“The Catholic Church in the United States has long advocated for the Dreamers and we will continue to stand with them,” said Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles.
Also none of these people said boo when we started locking brown kids up in cages even under Obama, and then when the program expanded to taking away children from their parents under Trump they applauded it.  So, let's not pretend that we haven't always had a fascist undertone.
Every time Trump talks his mouth looks like he's giving someone a blow job.
Well, when you play with fire and everybody that doesn't think exactly like you has been telling you it's fire for *at lest* five years (and Trump didn't come out of the clear blue sky, so that's being real generous).... you're gonna get burned.
WRONG.  Colorado has been voting by mail for decades.  It works, it's safe, TRUMP is just a scared whiny little bit*ch
Moms don’t advice from a woman who knowingly associates with  the Trump disgusting family. Moms protect their kids. You and the Trump are a danger to kids everywhere.

President Trump does NOT have the authority to move the election. His suggesting otherwise is a dangerous and unprecedented power grab at denying you YOUR rights during a pandemic. He's willing to do anything to stay in office. We must take this threat to our Democracy seriously.
I'm not blinded.  Biden is not the best speaker and often makes gaffs.  Trump is WILLFULLY IGNORANT. He is an unintelligent grifter...and you are the mark.  You are being used.
The problem is that the remaining moderate Dems are believing that  Joe Biden will be a moderate Dem president and worth it to dump Trump.  The indications are that, even if he is able to remain competent and is not removed, he will have a far left VP and cow to the far left
I know this young man. He was cool before this. Now he’s helping recruit high school &amp; college students to work the polls in November (because, yes, Trump, the election will go on whether or not you were joking about killing representative democracy).
Really think about this for a minute. Trump has just admitted in front of God and everybody that he's done such a bad job as Prez, he's the first one in history who could not hand off government to his successor.
Trump proved that Joe Biden was right in April. #MTPDaily #MSNBC
Good, TRUMP got your attention. Now you know what we have been talking about since the last election season.,

That lie got old. Especially coming from a trump spawn.
But you're good with Trump allowing russia to put bounties on our soldiers. Cool
I'd just like to know what they refer to him as. You know it's not "Donald" or "President Trump".
I don’t know who is worse - MAGAs or Bernie Bros refusing to vote for Biden unless he promises Medicare for all. So it’s ok with them if Trump gets re-elected so the poor and those with pre existing will not be able to get ANY insurance
Trump supporters are like “I’ve never seen a hot liberal” my guy do you not know what a celebrity is
Covid is a hoax !!! He didn’t die of covid! Trump says it’s a hoax
No way tRump. We will vote you out.
Not knowing it is about Trump and the ruling (billionaire) class is kind of the issue and indeed is relevant
Imagine all the positive stuff this guy and everyone else buying into this bullshit will say about Trump in ten years
That would be the one good thing trump would have done. I would rather have the us start a war now instead of in like a few years when China is alot more powerful. We don't want another WW2 senerio.
So Chuckles, Co-Founder of the Federalist Society calling for Trump’s impeachment based on his tweet suggesting a delay in the November Election. Care to comment?

Will do! Be there with no mask standing at the front door to see everyone! Trump 2020
trump would rather burn it all down than lose. He doesn’t care about our democracy or Americans, only himself. November can’t get here fast enough.
Mail in ballots are only for trump supporters, apparently.
Ffs... trump cannot delay the election.  Only congress can, and they’re already pushing back on any suggestion of that happening.
“Obama and Trump are 2 sides of the same coin.”  Yeah, the coin is called “history”, and one of them is on the wrong side...
The only media talking about “mail-in ballots,” is Phaux Spews and Trump backed OANN.  In other words, just the fake news media.

Truth. Trump fears accountability.
Obama delivers call to arms in eulogy for Lewis, links Trump to racist Southern leaders who fought civil rights in…
you are a coward,  you know the answer and you are a coward.  You side with a criminal. Here’s one last question, which is it, America or Trump?  #AmericaOrTrump #WeWillVote #WeWillVoteByMail
No way I would work for Trump. That sounds miserable.
If Trump is able to say he is the sole reason for the economy when the numbers are good, he should also take total responsibility when it’s this bad, right? And if not, then doesn’t that just prove that he didn’t have much of a role in the economy in the first place?
That’s trump making America great again. What’s the problem?  Also he profited off of the deal probably on the front end and the back end, just like he is supposed to, right?
I think tRump is trying to make Herman Cain into John Lewis
Y’all do realize we don’t have to try to make George Bush and Bill Clinton look better just because Trump sucks? They can all be shitty humans, and let’s be honest, they all are
Trump's administration is literally arguing in court that immigrants aren't whole persons...  But sure, it's unfair to compare them to Nazis.  Fuck off.
The real reason  wants to delay the 2020 election is because he wants to delay going to prison!  You see Donald knows he’s in deep shit with the #sdny after he is out of office! He and the whole trump crime family is going to prison!
Following trump, will they ever learn!
Today in presidential history: 1. Obama delivers amazing eulogy for John Lewis, an American hero. 2. Trump killed Herman Cain, former leading GOP candidate for President.
Why does the American public fall for trump’s “distraction of the day” repeatedly? We all know he tweeted about the election today to distract everyone from the disastrous GDP contraction. Stop taking the bait!
I don’t watch Trump anymore. Just you and Sarah.
If they want to win, the GOP incumbents and candidates will soon jump off the Trump train-wreck!
Funny how trump’s tweet about delaying the elec came 15 mins after release of the worst economic report in US history.  It would take action by both houses of Congress.  A delay beyond Dec would require a constitutional amendment.    Not happening.
Trump caused his death. He went to Tulsa without a mask for Trump!

Yes, we've fallen some. But Trump proved we were already a lot lower than some of us realized or admitted.
Yeah I thought the same when tRump didn't attend John Lewis's funeral but that's how he rolls
We all know the trump cult has no evidence regarding any of the harebrained conspiracy theories they spout.  That's why the answer is always "look it up", rather than, ya know, actual evidence.
Its fed by a Qanon conspiracy theroy investigated by the trump administration to deflect and protect the ineptness of a lying President.
Your asking us about a foreign Polucy - What the fuck is that all about?!!!! In every case - tRump does the WRONG THING! #WhatAFuckingMORON

Trump is being the usual Trump, floating goofball ideas as though they are legit and he's seriously considering them. I'm quite sure his advisors have made it clear it's not happening. He doesn't care. He just likes the shock and awe he can create. It's what he gets off on.
Did you hear Trump say that? Think for yourself! Oh sorry, I forgot you are a Republican.
He threw his life away for a tRUMP ideology - that makes no sense.
Perspective | My entire state votes by mail. Sorry, Mr. President. It works great.
As much as the left is trying to provoke a civil war, in cities like Portland, I seriously doubt it will happen. We will vote Trump out for sure, just like we voted Clinton in in 2016.
I still want to know why you look like Trump. I think you have a problem.
Funny but you only mentioned something that you blame Democrats of. Are you concerned about voter suppression Liz? What about the machines that are purchased from people that support Donald Trump, does that concern you at all? You people are absolutely freaking unbelievable.

Pres. Trump attempting to interfere with the election process again.  Please report.
Herman Caine attended your ridiculous rally in Tulsa where tRumpies did not wear masks and many rally personnel were already infected - he got the virus at this stupid rally and now he’s dead. He followed tRump right into his grave.
Says the bootlicker who ran to #MangoMussolini for a job. Calls tRump a conman and a fraud, runs to get a job. Then as a senator votes with him all the time. Then turns around and votes for removal from office. You are seriously confused there Mitt.
Trump is pushing their anxiety buttons daily!
Hannity and Mnuchin can't buy what was left of the middle classes houses out of foreclosure until trump and the GOP bankrupt them.
What about all the "The global pain. loss and uncertainty  and headache and dreams..." that was destroyed by the Obama administration? Or is it only an issue when the scary red man commits war crimes. How many countries did obama attack? How many has trump?
That shows me everything I need to know about Nap. He's a petulant jerk. Trump often tweets suggestions and his thoughts with no real meaning and only a shark would jump at that bait to render ridicule. I would advance that Nap is projecting. He certainly displays those traits!
There are ZERO Biden signs in Colorado. A few Bernie and way more Trump that’s last election.
Using a mans death to make a political statement against Trump. You’re sick.
Maybe you should pray that you get some mental healthcare, so you won’t kill anymore innocent people with your Covid. You should pray that the decent, hard working people with jobs vote Trump out of office, or you won’t get your welfare check. 150,000 are dead because of you..
Oh. Kind of like Trump only discussing politics while 151, 570 people have died to get himself re-elected? Oh, and trying to delay the election in November because he's failing?!

marco "WISHES" trump hadn't said that.  He was able to say that because of you, you mouse-sized, shriveled-brain, cowering, mangy dog.
idk how this take isn't all over the place, but Donald Trump literally killed Herman Cain. He's not dead because of some abstract thing, he's dead because of the rally in Tulsa.
Same in Colorado. It’s only pure ignorance to not have mail in voting. Considering we are the only country that doesn’t allow a day off for voting, it’s the only logical way. Trump is a fucking lunatic, and he knows he is done!
I'm disgusted that anyone is questioning Obama's eulogy for John Lewis, because politics were mentioned. It's quite sickening because Trump only talks politics while 151,000 people have died.
It’s not safe to do either, but hey Trump is making America great again, and that all that matters. Isn’t fun how 40 years of Republicans doing nothing has snowballed into an impossible situation? No healthcare, no social welfare backups, no education, no PPE, and no hope.

What did you say in response to why you have ignored the facts &amp; science about this virus &amp; in doing so, you have his blood on your hands? He was a good man. You, on the other hand, are not. This isn’t the China Virus. It’s the Trump Virus. Your failure has killed 154k Americans

I notice that it’s been very quiet about Herman Cain. Didn’t he go to Tulsa for the Trump rally and then got sick less than 2 weeks later? And oh yeah, he does today from same said hoax of a virus today
My dad called me the day after the election to say: “not all Trump voters are bigots just like all Obama voters weren’t socialists.” Wha???? How are these equivalent in any way?

Liberal logic: If you vote for Trump you're a racist and a white supremacist, even if you are black! In fact, if they don't vote for Biden then "you ain't black" and a white Biden voter is blacker on the inside than you are! You can't debate rationally with that level of crazy.
We should renovate the West Wing. Let's start by removing Trump.

Trump’s bloodline.  #AddAWordRuinATVShow
Although I disagreed w/ him politically, it saddens me that he has passed. He was a very decent man. It is also so terribly sad that it could have been avoided. I so wish people would not follow Trump’s “leadership” ...many lives could have been saved.
I guess Ben Carson is your last black vote. Mask up Ben. Trump needs you. 😷🥽
Doesn't Cornyn know that Trump used CAPS when he tweeted?
Yeah, I don’t think tRump is thinking through his positions.
To help Christ fight the One World Order is why they say we need "More Jesus" instead of more government accountability.  This is why the say "everybody in power is corrupt" when you point out Trump's many failures.
Why has the Christian Right stopped valuing family values? Like, why do we they still plan to vote for Trump &amp; the anti-science stooges who support him? One word answer: RELIGION  They ascribe to a theology called One World Order or New World Order.

Shame that someone who had beaten the odds, would have allowed himself to be exposed at Trump's Tulsa rally where there were few masks and no social distancing.   Goodbye Herman Cain. You added a lot of color and excitement to American politics.
And to think the left got mad when Pres Trump spoke in the Rose Garden about his sleepy creepy brain dead opponent.
how many conservatives do you actually know? i’m just telling you the whole “people blame the president for the economy” isn’t true anymore. those people don’t blame trump. his support among the right is higher than ever. normal analysis of voting trends doesn’t work anymore.

Too dangerous for adults to vote, but safe enough to send your babies to school.   Rex was right.  Fucking moron:  Trump’s call to ‘delay’ the election is a distraction — but it’s also a serious threat -
killed  by holding his rally and encouraging people to not wear masks. Unfortunately, Herman Cain signed a waiver so Trump can't be held responsible for killing a man. #TrumpKillsUS #TrumpMurderedCain
You think Trump posted that? He talked trash about him several months ago. God it must be a rough time for you right now.
Does anyone still honestly believe Trump won't lie to get what he wants?
The only way he would do this is if he can make a deal that nobody (SDNY) will prosecute him.  If we see Biden winning in a landslide I can’t see anyone being willing to let Trump get out of jail free
A dear friend from high school posted this comment on a Breitbart feed: “President Trump, we have faith you are hearing us. It’s simple. Make the medicine that we know works available. No vaccines sir. No one is going to get one anyway. No Republican or Christian anyway. 1/

biden needs support from the left to win, cuz the right has dug in on trump. people are less motivated overall to go out and vote than they were in 2016. i hate trump but i think having any kind of confidence that biden’s got this in the bag is insane.

bro you’re going off the same polls that said trump had no chance of winning in 2016. at least hillary was able to put together a complete sentence and was visible, biden has literally nothing going for him besides “not trump” and we saw how that strategy worked for hillary
Republicans are gonna regret letting Trump run their party into the ground when they lose the White House and Senate this fall 😂
He's right. If Trump would have worn a mask and encouraged others to do so, Herman might still be alive. It's like wearing a seatbelt.
Can we all agree that we will step out into the streets and turn up the song “Happy” and dance if Trump is voted out of office Nov 3rd?  And then we can lullaby each other to sleep with We Shall Overcome ...that night.
i really think you’re overestimating how a lot of people view the covid situation. all of my family are conservatives and all think its overblown &amp; weaponized by the left to try &amp; hurt trump &amp; that the economy is suffering because the democrats are forcing unnecessary lockdowns
Hey  what's your take on this now? Is Biden still "going low"?
Impossible. Trump upstaging Barack Obama? Not under any circumstances.

Trump’s Daily Outrage to distract us from what’s going on. What’s next?
Democrats saying we still went to the polls during the Civil War, and that we shouldn't have any delays, are making Trump's point for him.  Mail-in ballots will lead to huge delays &amp; questions regarding who rightfully won.  Even during the Civil War, we still went to the polls.
Not quite as epic as dying at from a Trump rally, if we're being honest.

Wait until someone tells a “joke” where the punchline involves Trump and a firing squad.
We know that Trump was briefed on a potential covid19 pandemic back in fucking December. What are you even talking about?
Incredible.  If Trump had any respect for humanity he would be alive (along with the rest of the 150k).
Maybe you should come up with policies or a platform as opposed to Trump retweets and conspiracy theories.
Nobody is commenting on Trump's missing all of John Lewis' celebrations.
Thanks - also agree with you that if there is violence, it won't be organized enough to do anything like seize statehouses or county offices before Trump is physically taken from the WH.
Watched John Lewis funeral &amp; after hearing President Obama &amp; how he STOOD up to the BS tRump is pulling GAVE ME HOPE that he is IN THIS TO WIN IT for our DEMOCRACY!
It’s crazy to think that Herman Cain could have got Covid at a Trump rally and 2weeks later has passed away.
Have fun in your Parler circle jerk. All the weird conservatives who were told by trump that everyone is out to get them so they went to a new app so they could all just agree with each other without having to be inconvenienced by being told they’re wrong
My guess is to make Trump look bad and get him out of office after the attempted coup did not work or allegations of everything that Hillary and Barrack actually did also did not work.
Same goes for saying something even remotely conservative or patriotic. The conversation will have zero to do with Trump but the unhinged Left sees Trump everywhere they turn. He haunts them. Hard to believe THEY obsess about Trump even more than Trump obsesses about Trump! 🤣
President Trump lives on Twitter. Just stop.
News Release. Trump does NOT have the power!!!!   Yes, this👇👇👀👇👇
so, so, so many people on the right think covid is overblown/“politicized” &amp; the resulting economic disaster is the fault of the dems for “forcing shutdowns”. trump voters from 16 are still trump voters in 20, but libs and leftists are less motivated for biden than for hillary
Explain. Are you threatened by the questioning of credentials of the "experts" Trump likes?
Trump unknowingly honored the Congressman by not dishonoring him with his presence.
I was musing whether cops would stop armed Trump supporters from committing political violence.
Checks and balances. Twitter is freaking out because of Trump Tweets, but let's remember that our system, in the main, works when it comes to this kind of faux-authoritarian nonsense.  Trump tweeted that to dominate the news cycle once again and the sad thing is it always works.
It feels to me like he's doing the, "Well, I have a black friend, too!" thing.  No matter that he caused Cain to get Covid. It's STILL 100% all about Trump.
Very similar acts, deflection is literally deflecting guilt to appear innocent. Projection is to outwardly chastise someone for the things you are guiltily of. Trump is also a master of gaslighting, which has made many supporters believe things they know are not true.
Trump is trying to depress the vote on November 3rd by implying he will delay the election and interfere with mail in ballots. This is intentional and even though he will likely not carry this out the mere implication is enough to depress the vote and spread cynicism.
Trump paid someone else to take his civics class. He’s a moron!
Will you accept Colorado election results on November? We vote by mail here, if you remember. What if Trump loses CO? What will you do? Back the Secretary of State of CO or back Trump? Does it depend on how your election goes?
This is what trump would like to distract us from today.     “John Lewis devoted his time on this Earth (to) fighting the very attacks on democracy and what's best in America that we're seeing circulate right now."
My sis posted on FB the day after “some of the best people I know voted for Trump/Clinton and if you are angry at people voting differently you are the problem” told her it was emotionally manipulative. Somehow I ended up apologizing and our relationship has never been the same.

What I think all the voters of South Carolina are wishing for is a senator who is not compromised by Trump through favor or blackmail. What does Trump have on you, Lindsey?
He died of Covid after criticizing masks and going to Trump’s Tulsa rally without a mask. It was practically a suicide. It was preventable, but the cult has their hooks in deep with the gullible.
I vehemently oppose Trump. But I don't let politics stop me from respecting decent people who show positive appreciation.

Impeachment had to happen. Full stop.   Trump is a menace.   You may still buy into the libertarian fallacy that the President doesn’t affect the daily lives of Americans, but if that was ever true, it’s nonsense now.   At least 25% of voters accept what he says.
This is one of my favorite movies and I think this is something a lot of us have been thinking:  V for Vendetta predicted the Trump Administration.

Donald Trump’s threat to delay or change the 2020 election is empty and absurd. Our election will be on November 3rd and it’s more important than ever to get out to vote and elect Joe Biden.
I feel good that we will be rid of Trump should we all make it to Inauguration Day...but “should” cannot be assumed and all the good words and polls mean nothing with thugs attack protesters in the street and a virus spreads relentlessly throughout the land.
Here's the thing:  Cain's mask stance was a symptom of a larger issue - the Trump administration's abysmal handling of a global pandemic, partially out of spite for the previous president. We risk some real bootstrap shit if we focus only on masks. I'm not commenting on Cain.

I am 73 yrs old from the state of Colorado and l have been voting absentee ballots since l turned 65 yrs old. I have no intention of changing.  Trump is using scare tactic to stop people from voting. And we have the right to vote how we want to vote.
The closer the election gets and the more it looks like Trump will lose the election, the more Trump will push this. I think he will actually do it, declaring the election process cannot be done fairly. He will postpone them indefinitely declaring himself to be POTUS intern.

The ones I know just like that he’s been really hands off w/DoD. They still think he’s an idiot, but they like that he’s their useful idiot. But even a lot of them are growing disillusioned. I never hear real support, just “Trump’s a clown, but...”
This is fascism what Trump is doing. He is telling companies they must do something which goes against their company policy. This is not free speech, but 100% fascism, stifling real free speech!
Nope. You always put the interests of Donald Trump and your family’s business first.
#MikePompeo and #BillBarr  Are being manipulated by the master manipulator     Boys... better start distancing tRump’s insanity is showing. You’re going down with his dinghy. #NotWorthIt  Your kids are watching.
Honestly you just have no idea what you're talking about. You listen to your conservative propaganda and believe every word of it. If Trump says its fraudulent you'll say its fraudulent. You don't care about facts, bottom line. You'll just keep pandering these falsehoods around
obama guilty of treason, fail the black community with his broken promises, used the black community to get in office and now biden is doing the same thing Trump has done more for the black community then you ever did democrat's only know how to blame others
Could not quite get what Trump was talking about today. I think he just read the first seven words in the headline - Perspective | Republicans are right; election fraud is real. They are perpetrating it.
I went to an endoscopy center to get a colonoscopy first thing this morning (after only 2 hours sleep for obvious reasons). First thing I saw as I entered was a woman checking in just ahead of me with a Trump 2020 face mask. That did not exactly help my day get started off right.
Trump can't delay the election and he knows it.
I'm crying! Is your pic Nixon and Trump mash up?!?!? 🤣🤣🤣
I have to smile at all the never trumpets falling for this yet again.  Trump gets the attention he wants on an issue via tweet, he gets everyone talking about what he’s concerned about, and it gets resolved.  You guys fall for it every time.
Trump is voting by absentee ballot which has many checks which is very different from the mail in voting which is being proposed. Please tell the truth and whole story, not just your slanted view.
The main point is that in no way does this actually help his electoral chances, it only provides political cover for a loss. At best it has no impact, at worst, for him, it convinces 1-3% to just stay home because it's not worth it to vote Trump since "it's already rigged".
Well,,well, we’ll. 🤣🤣🤣 Fuck Trump
Hey  I just wanted to know if you still stand by this
Your Rally!! TRUMP  !!!!!!
Vaccines, Masks, social distancing, Riots, Destruction of American values, traditions &amp; monuments, Pedophiles, corruption, evil China, MSM, Hollywood, police murderers, businesses destroyed, looting, censorship, fake news, + big pharma greed.   Not Trump's fault.  #Plandemic2020
Tell your church leaders that all they have to do is claim that they are protesting Trump. The acceptance for your gathering will be miraculous!!  ;0)
Trump, “we should delay the election because I can’t win because I messed up corona and blm.”  Republican Party Leaders, “Yeah no we aren’t doing that lol.”   😂😂☠️☠️
Seeing an awful lot of pickup trucks flying flags in the past week. Trump flags, Gadsdon flags, American flags. It's a beautiful sight.
No evidence children are less likely to acquire covid, trasmit it or die from it BECUSE they are all in quarantine. No eviidence protests are terrorists or anarchists- NONE. There is no evidence mail in ballots cause fraud as trump knows perfectly well and votes that way himself

Disagree. Herman Cain killed Herman Cain. Many people, sadly, are getting misinformation from Trump, Fox, and these nutcase websites. They don’t know any better. Cain knew where to get facts. Liked the publicity, didn’t he?
You need to take your meds. The paranoia is kicking in. Trump must live rent free in your head.
Angela, could you be anymore ignorant if you tried? Stop blaming Trump for all your problems. You were clueless when Obama was there also. This isn't new. Now go hide from the big bad conspiracy monster.
So trump thinks it’s safe enough for kids and teachers to go back to school but ironically not safe enough for people to vote so he wants to postpone the election?
I don’t even know why he would want to delay it. Delay doesn’t get him another term it actually just makes a shitshow where it’s impossible for trump to get what he wants
I think  killed him. Trump’s not smart enough to make any good decisions, everyone knows that. Pence should man up.

trump is an abomination.
Hey did trump send out "thoughts and prayers" to Herman Caine's family today? You remember him right? He attended trump's failed Tulsa rally and ended up catching COVID. Does trump even care?
That's why I am saying get rid of the USPS since the government isn't good at running stuff like that. Period it isn't just Trump bright guy. It's been operating in the red for a long time. Blame Trump cause he's been around for 40+ years not fixing it right?
You’re a sucker, Bill, and took the bait, hook, line, and sinker. You still don’t really understand Trump.

Just so you know, there is ample evidence that Bernell Trammell was killed for his pro Trump beliefs, but no actual evidence that George Floyd’s killing was racially motivated. Odd, don’t you think?

I ❤️ TRUMP
I just won’t celebrate or normalize the blatant moral issues that I see. I can’t claim to be an ambassador for Christ &amp; a supporter of Trump. To me, those two things are contradictions.  9/9
And finally, no this does not make me a liberal or a Democrat. I pray for Donald Trump. I don’t hate him. (My heart actually breaks for him and what his life has been.) I’m so far from perfect myself, &amp; so desperately in need of grace. Daily. I know only Jesus is perfect. 8/
“Stay out of politics”, people say.   I’ve never in my life spoken publicly for or against a politician (or even cared) — until Trump. But when so many Christians celebrate a man whose character is so antithetical to who we claim to follow, it harms the witness of the Church. 1/
People are getting mad at leftists speaking I’ll of Herman Cain now that he’s dead but I bet there won’t be a word from those same people on the fact that Trump is getting off to his premature death... SMH
What do you care? Joe's not president yet. I noticed how the racist trump administration didn't even bother to send a representative to the Honorable John Lewis' memorial service. And speaking is basement's, remember this 👇🏽
No reason to convict Trump, investigated 4 years and still just made up charges by lying democrat/socialist politicians and deep state operatives, the Kenyan on the other hand will hopefully end up in GITMO where him and his boyfriend belong.
This guy is disgusting... nothing but a photo op... he knows no shame!!  Trump meets with the family of  Vanessa Guillen
“Talk to his staff” He couldn’t set the straight, about something as important as Trump playing with the most important part of our democracy.   What do we need him for? Let the staff handle it.
First you guys refuse to wear mask. You call it a hoax. You claim it’s to make Trump look bad. If you really wanted action you would’ve asked everyday. Now that your ppl are catching it and dying you want to act like you gaf. She was saving test for frontline and first responders
And Trump ignored them only executive branch has executive power

I’m old enough to remember when Trump said he’d personally finance his own campaign.  I guess Putin cut off his allowance.
Ill give a pre speech insight on what Trump will discuss,  'Blah blah lies, blah blah bullshit, blah blah..'  Oh, and i guarantee he'll say something stupid.
Yes. It clearly outlines that it is the extreme pushback against the GOP that constrains Trump. Not what is legal, but how much we the people roar our disapproval. Be ungovernable, and Trump is too much a coward to resist. He does what we let him do.. Vote, and SCREAM AT MOCs.
Because to Trump everyone else's kid(s), their teachers, &amp; their school's staff are all sacrificial not essential.
Liberals: “They said masks weren’t effective because it keeps people from getting sick from you if you’re sick!”  Also liberals: “...this conservative has died from covid-19, (unrelated) he didn’t wear his mask at a trump rally.”
just found out herman kain died from covid by attending a trump rally without a mask. lmao
Respectfully, Mr. Cain died due to the Corona Virus/Covid 19 most likely he was exposed at Trump's Tulsa rally where masks were not required.
Probably because Titanic’s brother said she was a Trump Supporter
I love how the #Democrat "leadership literally thinks  is serious and not trolling them. There was other things that happened today that went right over their heads like #Trump wanted.  #Trump2020

I wish they would all come out together and condemn Trump. I think it would make an impression on the Bush fans.
Belief in Trump instead of belief in science caused this.
Donald is sitting in his tidy whities eating pizza from his favorite place that he just tweeted about. Stark difference between the grace and elegance of Obama and the petulant pettiness of Trump.
#TrumpThreatensAmerica, our constitution, our laws, our election process, and people who go against him. Trump is a dictatorship and must be voted out on November 3rd!
Looks like TRUMP’s plan is working lol 😂
Maybe Trump was signaling with his tweet re: canceling the election that he knew what Obama's speech was going to cover?
To be fair, wasn’t it the press that just last week was talking about Donald Trump’s “change in tone”? How “seriously” he’s now taking things?  One alien DNA anti-vaccine quack and a delayed election tweet later, I wonder... you still think he’s seriously changed tone? Ugh...
When I saw My President trending, I went here go the Trump cult again, because that is what they do. Come to find out it is about Obama!
This is setting up so Trump can claim the election was rigged and he will fight it and refuse to give it up. He will not peacefully transfer power to Biden.
Cant wait for the riveting Media Ad, "Munich 1972, Trump DID it". Only on PBS
Just looked. Trump isn’t trending on Twitter at all. Not even on the list at all.
Trump has a phone and a pen, just like BO!
It would be a very good day for the newspaper editorial boards in America to call for Trump's resignation.

He praised Trump's decision not to require masks at the Rushmore rally.
Apparently some Democrat must have forced the old man to got the the trump h8fest without a mask.    It has nothing to do with the reality that trump made mask wearing political or that large indoor crowds are an epidemiologist's nightmare.
Great questioning!  Pompeo is such a tool of Trump and Putin!
Sorry but you can't trust he government. Start calling for Trump to resign.
Fat ass has a history of not paying his bills. After Trump is defeated in Nov I think cities will sue Trump campaign &amp; GOP.

Care to revisit? Trump: “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???”
We call it "Time for Trump to resign."
I do not and cannot figure Trump out on this one!
People saying Trump can’t mess with the election date apparently haven’t seen a lot of the things he’s been allowed to mess with so far and how little written laws seem to matter when they affect him.
This needs to be the headline everywhere  "In an effort to distract from reports of a historical crash of the US economy, Trump suggests an unconstitutional delay in US Elections"  Because reporting on just delaying the elections is exactly what he wants!
Someone pointed out that Trump awarded a big contract to a guy who holds 55% of Kodak stock (yesterday) &amp; who's sentence was earlier commuted by Trump. Poor Deflection tactic ?
I'd argue that at this point American liberty is wrecked – look at Fed actions in Portland, and soon other cities – and American Democracy has been so damaged already as to need life support – but sure. Getting Trump of office out would be a super start. But it can't end at that.
There is zero evidence Cain contacted COVID at the Trump rally. Despicable.
THAT’S the thing he wished Trump hadn’t said?!?
There's no doubt the Kodak loan and subsequent huge stock rise is a scam.  Just one of the many things this Trump administration will try to get away with before getting voted out.

Highly skeptical abt #hydroxychloroquine as a “cure”, but it according to many health professionals it seems to be a viable treatment for C19 if treated early on. So to completely disavow &amp; discredit these ppl is INSANE. This is not abt a cure. It abt removing Trump from office.
Yup, it's amazing Trump doesn't have it.
They failed...your continued support of Trump belies any claim to honesty.
A trip from Palm Beach, Florida, to Newark, New Jersey. Trump banned Epstein from his resort because of his inappropriate activities.
It seems appropriate for trump to threaten our elections on the day we honor and say goodbye to John Lewis. Get into good trouble and fight for everyone’s right to vote.
Feels like this type of question is the worst thing we can do with Trump. He literally has 20 career-ending events for any other politician. It feels like any attempt to choose the worst diminishes the quantity of truly awful things he has done and unintentionally normalizes him.
#WeWillVote crawling over broken glass and stepping on Legos in the dark to get Trump out of office.
Dave Williams, the state representative for Colorado House District 15, released a letter on Thursday, July 23, asking President Donald Trump to send “help to stop criminals here because ‘selfish bastards’ like Gov. Polis refuse to do so.”

Well, if anyone has his finger on the pulse of what makes "a great embarrassment to the USA" it's Trump.

Not that you brilliant people really are in need of ideas, but I suspect that if we start calling the President "Donald Trump Sr" it will really get on his nerves. Esp. if we call Jr just plain Donald Trump. Thank you for your work this year.

I have family who support Trump &amp; they're not racists, just misguided. Also, in 2016 many Pres Obama voters voted for Trump.

Donald Trump stock market is going down because you opened your mouth again. Please sometimes you should listen to your advisers and think a little bit before you say stuff. I am retired and I depend a lot on what the stock market does.
Trump cannot delay the election, that can only be done by Congress. His mishandling of the Coronavirus is all about money. Look at the Kodak contract, which isn’t the first of its kind.
Guess what, he already got people to pivot away from the Q2 economic contraction. Trump diverts this way all the time, say something crazy that his base doesn't care about to get people to stop talking about things that his base actually does care about, like the economy.
Trump thinks mail-in elections are fraudulent and must think that you are an illegitimate Senator. Maybe you should stop being a coward and speak up about that.
“The U.S. Constitution gives the power to regulate the ‘time, place and manner’ of elections to the U.S. House and Senate, with Congress also empowered to alter the rules. Nowhere is the president granted such power.”

Legitimate white supremacist back Trump. They say his ideals align with their own. You can’t deny that. That’s reason enough for me to oppose Trump. Mindless sheep choose to ignore that. I don’t. Gotta stages for something. There are better leaders or there. Not all Dems play
So "white suburbs" aren't a thing anymore, more people of color now live in the suburbs, and you want them to bring in HUD affordable housing to drive down the cost of the suburbs that more black and brown people now live in..... And you're hung up on something Trump did in 1973

These are the same arguments made during the civil right marches.  People even complained that traffic was disrupted.  This is an important time folks!  Time for Trump to shut up and go home.
The GOP is no longer the party of Reagan.  Trump is removing troops from Germany....and forcing “federal  troops” to battle protesters in American cities.  Putin owns Trump.

Totally irrelevant. Her last name isn’t Trump.
Let's got through this: 1. Troops he is allowing bounties to be put on them 2. We are a republic and tariffs are socialism 3. Trump destroyed the economy with his incompetence over handling COVID 4. Trump is a sociopath and his supporters are a cult 5. Trump is protecting himself
He also said that Putin pays trump and rohrbacher, right?
I hope that when Mitch McConnell dies he doesn’t get visited by anyone. I hope the capitol is under construction so they just have to burry his sorry, greets, destructive, sexist, racist ass and all his children with him. Donal trump is a faggot
cut ties with Epstein long ago....don't even go there.
Don’t do this or at least note it as parody.  It diminishes Trump’s real unacceptable comments.  When you post fake takes it gives his side an opportunity to disavow all his real ridiculous rhetoric.
Wait for a last minute push to name Trump an honorary pallbearer.
Trump Campaign ‘Laundering’ Campaign Finance Money, Election Watchdog Says
I told you three 4 years ago they would be tough years ahead after trump was elected
You need purpose. Come join my campaign. Seriously... You could be a speech writer. We’d be the funniest executive branch in history. Once the story comes out that there’s no Austin Bomber confession, neither Trump nor Biden have a shot.
You don’t get to say if trump is doing right by us, if you aren’t actively in and seeing what he is doing for/with us, so keep talking “almost served but I have 10 reasons why I didn’t”
China FINANCES MILITARY BASES IN COLORADO. Trump borrows or prints money tossing it on the 26 TRILLION DOLLAR DEBT Pile. But paying for GROCERY BAGS will save Aborted Black Babies right?
They're not even giving a choice so they can spite President Trump. They are willing to kill mass amounts of the population.
Well give him a minute and trump will also give them a multi million dollar loan to grow cabbage

Trump didn't ask Putin about putting a $$ price on our soldiers heads. 1st: I doubt a man who is too weak to fire someone in his cabinet in-person will challenge Putin. 2nd: Trump is counting on Putin to undermine our elections so he is not about to make him angry to not deliver

Why are none of the Republicans working? I have heard nothing of them working to get the virus controlled or help the people struggling. Do they not have to work any more till Biden takes over? Because Trump's on his way out they don't work?

This is how Trump feels about Americans.
Which is funny for a guy who brags about voting for Democrats. The guy is like Trump in that he seems only guided by money.
Encourage it. Trump made a huge mistake trying to stop the rioters. Never interrupt your enemy when they are making a mistake.
Yea, when you voted no on the impeachment conviction, where you doing right for Maine? No, you were doing the will of Trump!

We find out Russia hacked our system for COVID vaccine. Now their claiming they’ll have one in a couple of weeks.   REALLY?!   Will Trump call him out?!  I don’t remember him saying anything about the hack.   JC everyday it’s something else.
Really looking forward to trump being regarded as a nationalist jimmy carter by fascists decades down the line.  A one term president who ~wasn't perfect~, but he was one of the "good" ones and was forced out by an establishment that didn't understand him.
Don't care. What is the national plan going forward to suppress COVID?  ▪︎ 4.3 million+ COVID cases  ▪︎ 150k+ dead ▪︎50 million+ unemployed ▪︎ trump refuses to hold Russia accountable for paying bounties to Taliban militia's to kill American troops.
You think that "talking to Putin" is the right play?   Obama would have told him, "you better cut that out"  Trump is way smarter than that.

Really pathetic Druid. Can’t handle the issue at hand so you attack someone with a ridiculous personal opinion 👌really shows how little critical thinking skills trump supporters have
Is it just me, or has  pretty much lost all faith in humanity? I'm right there with you, Mr. Cooper. I can not believe the level of stupidity we face in this country.
No, you finally figured out that everything you and Trump did and ordered was illegal actions of a police state administration and that you were going to get sued. You're a facist and you need to be charged.
Oh heck yeah and that is why he will never go on stage head to head with Trump. He would crush Biden and Biden would have to have a hidden screen in the podium!! Now he can do it in his basement.
Because Barr is Trump's bitch
There just as smart as Trump!
I didn’t even add the funniest part, the woman created a Twitter for the soul reason of trying to get Trump to listen to their story of why their town were “tyrants” who “kidnapped” their dogs for having them living in the hoard.
Resurrecting the concept of Hoovervilles, while conveniently ignoring the history that Hoover was in charge when the system broke, and that Trump is at least trying to fix the system.
Trump will win but Democrats wont accept it. All hell is coming on a white horse and its name is death.
Well daddy trump says the FBI building is in terrible shape, which is likely another lie.
Yeah.....Joe Biden.....he's a big thinker and a incredible speech maker.  Can't wait to see him against President Trump in a debate.  Then people will realize what a big thinker he is.  How could Trump compete with his level of intellect?
That's the Abbott rapid test, which the wh uses to screen people before they pay homage to Jabba the trump.  They wont produce enough to use in schools to protect them but King Fat gets them.

Lewis lost all respect when he jumped on board the "Trump is a racist russian agent" train.  His actions the last few years have overshadowed anything he did with civil rights because he's been complicit in tearing this country apart.
I mean Trump literally just tweeted TODAY that he is supporting the rollback of provisions meant to alleviate de jure segregation. Bringing up stuff Biden voted for 25 years ago isn't really going to prove your point when your guy is doing this stuff right now.
People worry Trump will catch Covid-19 from Republican congressmen from Texas. Trump made a deal with the Devil to spare him and Trump will deliver 150,000 souls.
Trump had three years to lower drug prices and he never did.
Biden repeatedly forgets his location and the subject on which he is speaking in mid-sentence. The most recent example was just yesterday. Slandering Trump will not change the fact your POTUS candidate is plainly descending into dementia.
You're not a king or a dictator. Move out of the US if that's what you want. We don't want you here. We don't want you there. We don't want you anywhere!! We do not want you Donald Trump!! So pack your bags and get out!!
I just wish he would confront Putin about putting a $$ price on the heads of our soldiers, or hacking to steal our vaccine production secrets.   He doesn't do it because he wants Putin to influence our election, and if he pisses Putin off he won't. Trump will do ANYTHING to win

Dem media polling evidence fully supports the shy Trump voter hypothesis. Despite Trump supporters being far more enthusiastic to vote than Biden supporters, the Dem media polling has Biden winning the horse race against Trump with Reagan level margins. Massive disconnect.

How you look blaming Biden for the state of our current affairs. You're the President, and look at the country.  Disease riddled. Economically devastated. Your stormtroopers beating up singing moms and veterans in the streets.  150,000 of us dead.  This is Trump's America.
You literally demanded someone prove they're a fucking American citizen and you don't think you're just like trump supporters? Huh, do we need to take a trip down memory lane to the last election?
Maybe she shouldnt demand people prove they're American citizens. It isn't hard to act just like trump supporters
What's funny is people defending that someone demands others to prove they're Americans is literally what trump supporters did in the last election. Your cult is just like that of MAGA. Don't fool yourself
#Biden #Biden2020 damn Biden supporters, there really isn't much of a difference between them and #trump supporters at this point.
loved your Opening Statement was awesome. Things I trust: I don’t want Dr. Fauci pitching for my team. Dr Fauci. Donald Trump will deny and lie regardless of consequences and my cat wants me dead. I distrust: anything that comes from this administration, platypuses.
The answer to why Trump is not liked is because he's an arrogant, know-nothing egotist who would rather let hundreds of thousands of us die in a pandemic than admit he failed the country with his lack of response.
Yeah, I had to school some people who tried sharing that shit with me. The American people are not stupid, except for trump's base.
Odd how Trump and Gold rise Together ...
Are you that naive? False flag seeding violence was an obvious Trump option.
Teachers in France have had no problems opening schools.  The teachers unions just want to get Trump out of office.  If the teachers weren’t getting paid they would be singing a different tune.  Vote Red: every child should have a school choice.

#tRump is 2 weeks away from dropping you from the ticket. When he loses, he will resign on 19 January and ask you to pardon him.
Fauci and Demorats along with Bill Gates had this planned for the virus to come out! That's way Fauci came out after President Trump was elected and said that this administration was going to have a pandemic outbreak?!? How did he know? WAKE-UP do research!
When you think that Barr is loyal to Trump or Trumpism that is incorrect he is loyal to "Conservatives Without Consciences", he is a tool to another force where Trump is its figurehead and means to a constituency that gives them means but its avenue to power
Barr was an embarrassment - as was  who has no business acting as if he has any moral standing since he aided and abetted a molester.  BTW you have no right to act as if you are anything but a sycophant to the Trump-just a little lap dog.
Telling the truth today is disgusting, but Trump allowing our troops to have bounties put on their heads, you ignore that or call it another hoax, even though are own intelligence agencies said it happened!

Not only for Trump but after the hearings today its more imperative more than ever to win back the house
Barr deliberately narrows a question instead of answering the question asked. Asked about Trump discussed, he narrowed it to "criminal," not in the original Q. What could he have been ducking with that particular answer. Direct instructions by Trump or ? perhaps. Answer technique
Remember when republicans despised socialism which price controls are? Oh they still claim to hate socialism but only with Trump they love it, but if you democrats dare do it, it is evil socialism! Even if it is the same thing Trump is doing! #VoteOutTheGOP
But not to manufacture PPE. It’s easier to blame Obama and China, although Trump sent 17 tons of PPE to China. I wonder where that came from since Obama left an “empty cupboard”   There’s always a catch.
So thankful it isn’t the 2.5 Million projected. Glad Trump ignored Fauci, Pelosi, and Biden when they called him xenophobic for closing flights from China. Now if Dem governors had the intelligence to keep nursing homes safe and Hydro hadn’t been blocked bc of politics...

Trump threatened your right to vote for your leader today.  Yes you.  He threatened YOUR rights.  Now do you care???
Don't be misled. Legal or not,  Trump is going to make a Last Stand and it's going to be UGLY. Don't expect that he's suddenly going to follow the law.

This is a good question.   Trump saving it for white people?
That doesn't track with any other poll, anywhere. So it must be from the same "poll" that Trump uses to say "96% support in the Republican Party!"... the delusional, imaginary poll in Trump's head.

Addendum: And then there’s this. Trump and the GOP want to pick and choose what is real to support whatever particular agenda item they have, despite the obvious contradictions. We see this over and again.
You should hate Trump for holding an indoor event in the midst of a pandemic and telling attendees they should not social distance or wear masks. The virus originated in China, but it was weaponized here, by Trump's lying, minimizing, and deliberate inaction.

The problem for Donald Trump is that he has nowhere to go: Putin won't take him once his utility is gone, and that happens pretty soon. Where's he gonna go? New York? He's dead to that town. Europe? Russia? China? Nope. He's backed himself into a very unique corner.
That number is bigger than electioneering or the virus.  Americans are sick of it all and quitting this economy.  People are fed up and giving up.  That is the Trump lasting legacy.

Zero sympathy for a man who didn’t wear a mask to a Trump rally.  Or anywhere tbh.  If you choose not to listen to scientific data, then enjoy your trip to the afterlife.
Herman Cain may have been a nice guy, but he listened to Trump instead of medical experts. He prioritized politics over his own health. Hard to feel much sympathy when people like Herman Cain want to put all of our lives in danger to worship at the altar of Trump.
Seems like as good a time as any to remind folks that Donald Trump faces criminal indictments once his presidency ends. In that context, it's no wonder he'll do whatever it takes to lie, cheat, and steal the 2020 election.
It's not scary to have regular people living near you. It's scary to be surrounded by other rich folks and think you're going to get robbed when you see a teacher or a barista.
Gosh. I wonder where Trump ever got the idea?
Remembering Lewis today, meanwhile Cain passes and Trump yells from the corner "Hey don't forget about me!".   2020 bingo card keeps getting weirder.

This is not something we should get all hot and bothered by. He's just trying to introduce doubt in its likely  outcome, and we should ignore it. The date of the election is in the Constitution and cannot be altered by Trump or anyone else (barring an Amendment).

Reducing our military readiness so #Putin can breathe easier. That's totally what we pay a President to do. And people wonder why you have to use finger quotes whenever you refer to #Trump as #POTUS.
Hey  here’s another view of your dad’s poorly blended makeup. At what age do the Trump “men” start wearing makeup? How will you apply it with your goofy-ass beard?
Trump seems to have got some fresh talking points from Putin.
Trump is killing Americans. Period. You disagree? You're fucking wrong.Sounds like Trump and reminds me of this:
#UPDATE  "Do I want to see a date change? No," Trump said at the White House hours after raising the idea of a delay in a tweet. "But I don't want to see a crooked election."
President Trump was provided w/ an expert plan on how to handle the pandemic by his own SIL, but instead, he lied about the virus, discouraged testing to protect his image, &amp; pit the states against each other in a fight for scarce resources.
Y'all need to report tRump tweet.
Donald Trump is not going to leave the White House willingly. He'll never accept losing an election because his corruption will be exposed! The statute of limitations from his crimes in NY will not run out unless he wins another by term. The worse crazy is yet to come?
Donald Trump should be charged with the 150,000 Dead Americans that died from the coronavirus because of his bulshit saying that it was a HOAX. Do nothing Trump Unfit as President and as a human being.
Get Donald Trump out of our White House. He's a menace to America's  Constitution, democracy along with making the Department of Justice the laughing stock of the world. He believes that the attorney general of the  United States is his legal lawyer. WRONG answer. 2020 elections.
The America that I fought for, that I lost my blood brother and many many more. Just to let somebody like Donald Trump walk all over our Constitution and Shit all over democracy and make a laughing stock DOJ. He is not our King he is unfit as such. Bone Spur Cadet Draft Dodger.
Treasonous traitors are trying very very hard . We had elections during the civil war, we're going to have elections during Tinkerbell Trump's presidency too. That crap might work in Russia or China. But it's not going to work in the USA, let's make America America again.
They’re getting plenty of help from Trump
I’ve never seen a man so ill fit for the position he holds. History will not be kind to Trump’s supporters &amp; enablers.
Our country is a laughing stock since you became president. Trump go back to Florida. Biden for President
This supremely bad take is further proof that Charlie Kirk is a foolish, lying grifter. You don’t have to like him, but if you say Obama lied more than Trump, you’re as big of a fool as Charlie here &amp; no one should ever take your word seriously again.
If the election were tomorrow, Biden would win for sure. I would still say Biden will win in November. Maybe there's a chance Trump turns the pandemic around, but that doesn't seem likely
Trump is lying again. No fraud with mail in ballots. Kick this president back to Florida.
If trump wins in November she will be gone immediately... right now she is just holding on till then.
You mean a Trump wreck
Nobody wants Trump at their funeral.
Delaying the election is the most dangerous idea Trump has ever floated. The Framers feared this and wrote The Constitution in a way that the president is not king. Let me be clear, he doesn’t have the authority to do this!
To bad, you listened to Trump instead of science back in January.
He died from the hoax. You killed him for listening to Trump.
i think it can be safely said now that trump is a serial killer on a murder spree.
Not so. Trump is Satan the devil. Everything he has done so far us devils work. Accepting election help from communist Russia. Pandering to Putin. Obstructing justice in the investigation of his crimes. Inviting racial tensions and divide among Americans.
It was the fault of the tictok teens. If they didn't falsify the demand for tickets during a pandemic, the event would have been cancelled by Trump. Thought they were so smart but the blood is now on their hands. RIP good sir #HermanCain
Colorado has been voting by mail for years. You and your followers that play this conspiracy theory about mail-in-votes are crazy. You don't want mail in because republicans will lose. Trump already said it. This shows you believe it.
Trump loses he should be dragged out of our White House. 🏡
maybe a foreign power will invade us and remove trump and replace him with their choice.    works for us. 😝
Yeah, now he's Trump's legal advisor and lawyer. He should Resign as AG and apply for the job as Trump's legal lawyer. Bill Barr is supposed to be attorney general for All the American people not just some of the American people.
This is an utter disgrace and insult to the American military men and women who have served during the many years when the US was the leader of the free world. Trump is a petty little man who disgraces us daily.
If you think real hard, Trump himself is the cancel culture! 🤣🤣😂😂
at least she tried to hide it.  while trump openly works for putin &amp; bibi.
On purpose before the elections. Trump's and Republicans doings
Treasonous traitor Trump should be in front of a firing squad.
Another Village idiot, Trump's Cult follower. Loyal till the end.
If Trump is allowed to delay the election he will become our dictator. You people in charge of our lives are failing big time.
If we are in God's hands and you think Trump is God we are in trouble. Trump is satan and anyone that believes in Trump is the devils servant.
Oh come on. The standard politician has been authoritarian. Trump is no different. The only thing is that he has been neutered
President Donald Trump suggested delaying the 2020 presidential election in a Thursday morning tweet while further perpetuating the false claim that mail-in voting leads to widespread voter fraud.
Trump has activated them.
long ago, the cherokee &amp; other nations didn't have just 1 leader. they had people called chiefs but many had input into decisions. the elder women had a say. they used consensus.  this way is a good stop gap 2 prevent 1 person from becoming a dictator. u know.........like trump.
Treasonous traitor Trump.
Trump should still be charged with treason even now along with his AG Bill Barr.
Donald Trump The Village idiot worthless.
Trump's a disgusting treasonous traitor.
Sounds like a typical Trump deal.😳
i had hope for the less indoctrinated to put pressure on the flat earthers to behave..they arent doing trump any favors by catching the #hoax i hope they realize that 🤣🤣🤣
TRUTH.👇   Suburbs = white flight + redlining + NIMBY until the Fair Housing Act of 1968.   Trump says he wants to repeal this to protect the “Suburban Dream” = “White American Dream.”
If this Country was so great Trump would have never gotten near the White House.
You know who else deployed federal agents into the states? Barack Obama. But FOX news &amp; Trump himself had a very different perspective back then. This reminds me of a word, it’s right on the tip of my tongue...what is it...starts with an H...? 🤔
Trump is not loyal to the US.  He should not be allowed to continue to fu*k up this Country. #TheReidOut
mcsally is a female trump.  she's crooked &amp; lies through her teeth.  and she's arrogant.   let's get arizona back to we the people.
Yes. This election will come down to Trump's handling of the coronavirus, and right now he's handling it so badly, it's at Hoover levels of stupidity. Of course, he does have time to get his act together, but if the election was tomorrow, I would say Biden would win
Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh tried to sidestep abortion and Trump financial document cases, CNN reports
You're right! HCQ does cut the death rate of COVID-19 and I wish the real experts (the actual front line doctors) would get a voice in this. Instead they are being silenced.  #TRUMP2020 #COVID19 #COVIDTreatment
The Trump administration on Wednesday named a special envoy for the Arctic, filling a post that had been vacant for more than three years as the administration seeks a greater role in the region.😉
How is this okay??? When did the media and teachers become the bad guys? Oh, wait. 11/8/2016 is when it happened. F Trump, punk!
This is so embarassing &amp; shameful. 🤦‍♀️ Trump can’t stop lying or talking about himself for even 5 minutes. His ignorance is astounding.
Federal agents who have been guarding the U.S. courthouse during violent protests in downtown Portland,  will begin withdrawing in the next 24 hours, Gov. Kate Brown said Wednesday, though Trump administration officials says some will remain on standby.
Treasonous Traitor Tinkerbell Trump  the four T's, we're Fucked.
Trump would never make it to the medieval era in civilization 5 #civilization #wednesdaymorning
Tinkerbell Trump is a big-time Scumbag. He and his Republican Goonies can all go straight to hell.
Tinkerbell Donald Trump The great dictator. America keep your eyes on HE.
Bill Barr is part of the Gestapo organization Trump is his leader.
take heed.  you've told us loud &amp; clear you don't give a shit about us.  therefore, we don't give a shit about you.  good luck in november when trump wins.  because we will NOT reward you for fucking us over in favor of your elite pals.  the dnc is dead.
Is Trump seriously insulting one of our strongest and most important allies like a fucking child? I’m not surprised, just disappointed.
Worried about your economy? Who do you think makes that work? The normal people that you are killing. Until this virus is cleaned up by our governs and mayors. Trump has failed to no return.
You'd be surprised. Trump says we are number one in everything.
We have not had a second wave, we are still on the first. Trump and his administration are to blame for not thinking of the normal people when they knew about it in January. You are all pathetic and we are going to say bye your next election
President Donald Trump said his July 23 phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin was a call "to discuss other things," particularly nuclear proliferation.
what was apparent from the hearings is, he just doesn't care.  he knows trump will pardon him.
America is the laughing stock of the world. Sad no allies or does Trump call Russia a ally
biden has been a liar all his life.  like trump, if he says it, it makes it true in his warped mind.
Coming from a man (Cruz) that sucks up to the man (Trump) that called his wife ugly... that seems odd.   How much does your poor wife hate you?
So? We've been watching Trump get by with his diminished mental capacity for almost four years. What's your point?
Starting to think Lou Dobbs is dumber than Trump, if that's possible!
Dr. Robert Epstein: Google Will Shift 10% of Voters to Make Trump a ‘Blip in History’
We do not want to hear an Ymir’s BS!  Trump 2030!
Only Tinkerbell Trump does that.
C'mon. You're better than that, aren't you? "Solicit assistance IN AN ELECTION."  And no, it's not a stupid question. It's exactly what Trump did with Ukraine's president.  He "solicited assistance" by trying to investigate his opponent "in an election."
what the hell?  is he trying to out-orange trump?
Mike Pence reopening schools  he's a god dam liar, bidden is beating trump in many poles, i voted for trump and i wont do that again, I'm not a hard learner, nothing gets done and stock market not my thing
who are the lawless ones here?  wake up.  we're under martial law.........trump just hasn't officially announced it yet.  he's waiting until the wall around the wh is complete.
so Mr. trump don't like the do as i say not as i do thing hah? well neither do we the people, dictating and micromanaging our lives when gov does the shit they do without any consequence, your bigot hypocrites and not worthy of leading this country
Donald Trump Jr. joins Tucker to discuss Big Tech censorship: It only hurts conservatives
Because the left doesn't have mobs. That would be you and Trump and his administration. You act like you are the New York Mafia. The mafia got taken down. You are doing these things, you kill people of color and those that don’t stand with you.
Why he's not ordered to step down? And if Congress holds the purse, Trump better not get any more money for this new package. The people are watching you allow this person to get away with killing Americans.
military weaponry is to corona virus what intelligence is to trump. no relationship what so ever.
The world has been so unfair to trump, boo hoo hoo hoo! #TrumpCrimeFamily #TraitorTrump #DicatorTrump #votetrumpout
Bill Barr is a treasonous traitor he is all in for Trump. He's not a very good liar cuz we all know what he's up to. Bill Barr should Resign. Trump should resign for not protecting the American people that have passed from the Coronavirus. It was so simple and Trump manage to
Not when it all goes to the rich. Cutting income to those that have lost their jobs because of you. Trump and the rest of Republicans. Shameful little boys. Breaking the law and this will be your last year.
It sure does. 150000 people dead. No medical for thousands of people. Portland is like a war zone thanks to Trump and Barr. It’s been a fucked 2020. It will be better when you are all gone. That would be a great year,
What you think you can threaten every state that isn’t supporting Trump. Ukraine all over again. You don’t like me you get no money. Pathetic childishness little boys.
BILL BARR IS A DISGRACE.  CHOSEN FOR THE SOLE REASON OF PROTECTING TRUMP.  WHAT DOES TRUMP HAVE ON BARR?  everyone knows you're lying &amp; corrupt.  what do you think will happen after trump's gone?  you will be nothing!
The Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Trump failed to follow appropriate procedure when he tried to end the program, but affirmed his ability to do so.
Is an Arrogant, and feels he above the law represented Trump in ever way. He should be disbarred
Dr. Fauci is not lying.  Trump lies everytime he opens his mouth.
He’s a con man along with Trump, you and anyone else that says he great.
If your represent REAL people then why do you always seem to be Pro War and Pro Big Pharma as long as it aligns with your hate for TRUMP. You guys used to really have a backbone until your girl Hillary lost.
How can Barr set the whole time he lies. Republicans praise as the democrats scold him. He gets away with breaking the law and doing what he’s told to do by Trump. This is a evil man.
Bill Barr was never great, but I still can’t stop thinking about how he could’ve kept his reputation somewhat intact if he just stayed away from Trump. The same goes for a lot of people tbh.
Donald Trump Jr. has been temporarily suspended from certain functions on Twitter for violating the website's rules for spreading misinformation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.
i will bet what little i have on trump having big time dirt on the pedo protector.
Lmao these weren't medical experts. Trump keeps attacking the spread of medical information and spreading lies. Your first clue to knowing this is fake, is understanding the source.  Breitbart is a known reich wing propaganda machine that holds zero validity
It's because he'll/they'll focus on communism and paybacks for voting Trump.
She was wearing a trump crop top 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
The Trump family and anyone giving false information should be removed from tweeter.
We don’t believe a word Trump says. Fauci is 100 times better than Trump.
If we did what we needed,  Trump can’t blame China for everything.
a reporter for The New York Times, acquired a Federal Election Commission filing showing the RNC spent $94,800 to purchase copies of the book one week prior to its release &amp; that they offered a signed copy to anyone donating at least $50 to Donald Trump's reelection campaign.
as usual, you don't quite have the facts down.
Because President Trump likes it!
Trump never had credibility.  #cnn
anyone who is more concerned about property damage than the murdering of black people is not only helping donald trump but has no goddam place in congress.  and i feel lewis would agree!
Try that in Colorado! Anti-trump State!!
Woke up and still hate Trump's supporters!!!
It was supposed to be so much worse then, when they blamed Trump there wouldn't have been such backlash.  The dems are like the coyote.
I thought so too. Unfortunately a final round of tallies went to Trump 🙃
So Trump won't be throwing the pitch breaking the "110" year streak. Could this be the possible reason, since they keep refusing to let the Bantus go, with their wealth?
And that is how people like Donald Trump get elected president. Because people can’t be bothered to vote him out of office because they don’t like the other guy!

That’s why it blows my mind that “conservatives” are willing to die on Hill Trump! I don’t trust any of them anymore. They are either deeply deceived, woefully ignorant, or hypocritical liars.
“The transactional nature of the Senate GOP’s groveling surrender to Trump is straightforward: Simply ignore his awfulness and you will get things you want. That bargain required ignoring an ever-growing pile of awfulness.”
At least this explains why Eric has no problem lying &amp; shilling for an amoral man like Trump: he worships a different Jesus than the one in the Bible!
trump is pals with saudi arabia because of israel.  these 3 regimes are all in it together with the zionist israel leading the way.
Stop the shiny box with China. Trump screwed with the way we worked with China and all you care about is bringing the American people down so far that they only depend on their government sounds a little bit like Russia to me
I can’t believe you just lie out of your mouth like that. Those of us that are not your supporters have what’s called brains. We see and hear even when Trump says we shouldn't believe anything we see and hear. Your a joke in everyone’s eyes.
He advertises for Trump than anyone else. And he refuses to stop false adds from you republicans.
White House continues to build new 13-foot high 'anti climb' wall
“It’s very encouraging that Pueblo County did vote for President Trump in 2016. It was the first time in decades that a Republican presidential candidate had won in Pueblo. And I believe that he is going to win Pueblo even bigger this time.”
So maybe Trump can call off his dogs and let people peacefully protest. So you are okay with paid armed white supremacists going in to control as Russia would do? Pathetic.
The first remembrance of John L. Lewis was today at the Capitol. Pelosi - check. McConnel - check. Trump - MIA. Didn't even have the decency to have something read. What a petty little putz. Republican deserve him.
Amen, brother
One of those brave men in uniform here. I’m still waiting on our apology from  &amp;  for wanting us to be used against our fellow citizens who are peacefully protesting and exercising their right to Freedom of Speech. #copolitics #coleg #vetsagainstgop
From his votes on healthcare to his lack of leadership on #coronavirus ,  has always been too much of a coward to put #CountryOverParty because unfortunately, he puts his special interest donors over the dead bodies of his constituents. #copolitics #corygardner

when marla, his mistress at the time, became pregnant, trump tried to get her to have an abortion.  as i've said before....right wing men are against abortions.........unless their mistress gets pregnant.
We need new leadership in order for this to happen.  Trump has no problem with 500k people dying. For that reason alone he needs to go.   Now.
Unfortunately, I think the scandal has cost the Republican Party Trump's re-election. And, I wonder if the pipeline going through Southwest Ohio, Cincinnati area was somehow part of this corruption.
it's the agenda of feds to amp up the violence then msm airs all the stuff that makes the protesters look bad.  if feds hadn't interfered at all, many of these protests may have been ignored.  the trump admin WANTS chaos &amp; violence.

ARE OUR TAX DOLLARS PAYING FOR THIS?? AND WHO'S PROFITING???
I didnt know Trump either caused covid or instructed it to be destructive.
If you'd been working on global warming these storms may not be hitting us this hard. But kissing Trump's ass is more important, or should I say putins is.
Whatever Trump tries to do or say he has the best economy will be lies. We cannot trust Trump with Putin, All the money he is making on his businesses and the virus. Waited to long to start testing.
That's exactly what Trump is doing.
i absolutely love this video.
Resign Trump resign
Resign already Trump our country deserves real leadership not a racist divider!!!
Resign Trump
I think Trump should let Portland, Seattle, New York, etc. burn themselves down, but I’m not arsed at all if he sends cops in to give some Commie shithead arsonists a bit of the old wood shampoo. Screw ‘em.
is it going to boil down to trump, his gestapo against moms, and vets?
Trump didn't either
This is what Trump wants - escalating violence, more secret police, a way for him to declare he’s protecting law and order. Lefties should back off, and protest NON-VIOLENTLY far from federal buildings
Hispanic community don’t fall for any of Trumps what he has done or will do for brown people. Nothing. He don’t care about us. We are on the bottom of totem pole   Trump just wants the wall. Who cares about the wall anymore. Mexicans don’t even want to come to US.
I have a Trump wall joke but Mexico hasn't paid for it yet.
Shiny box, don't look at what Trump and Barr are doing to our own American people, look at china. Their bad people. Look in the mirror dough bag.
What about Trump and his administration. Just know telling supporters to wear a mask. 7 months, really?
No, its Trump Virus, you doofus!
President Trump The Leftist say the LOVE go to church , but you can not go to church the mouth they praise GOD with . They say not but hate.???? How is working for them. All thy have are lies. 🙏🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸

More  loving morons. Flying the flag of the enemy in our own country. While displayijg the crippling ignorance on public forum. Typical trumptards
So u want Trump?
probably the same reason he and trump visited each other.  they're ALL involved.
I love my kids, they are not going to die for Trump.
Trump will probably ask them to come over for dinner, they can have KFC and maybe some wendys or Micky Ds.
Facebook profits by spying on us and using the data to let advertisers target us. Trump is exploiting their model to spread lies about elections — it’s time to investigate #Facebook and rein this in.
The more dead the better is the actions of Trump and his administration. I'm even going to blame his supporters.
trump thinks by destroying the usps he will thwart mail in ballot voting.  this dangerous dictator will do ANYTHING to stay in office.
He’s not God do they really believe a rapist, racist pig is god. They will pay for holding Trump above god.

Trump’s America vs Obama’s America
and i see the opposite....people who DID like trump but now have seen the light at what a pos he is, but won't admit it for fear of being attacked by other righties.  but they'll say they still support him but will vote against him in the secrecy of the booth.
they're probably the ones all costumed up in military/cop gear pretending to be law enforcement so they can beat peaceful protesters for trump.
Because they are nothing but heartless,  greedy, privileged uncaring jerks who need to be sent back home!! They do nothing but let tRump run wild, and look what that has gotten us! Disgusting!
Yes I do! And it's a vote for tRump!
I wanna hear someone from the wome cult say “All Black Lives Matter.” Black Trump supporter’s lives matter too, right?

What planet are you on, things are getting better.. government troops are attacking American citizens, a raging pandemic, trump....
It was a photoshopped receipt.  Kroger has no such charges.

People have this backward, if biden wins things will go back to a pre trump normal, when Trump wins this will all be ratched up 10 fold, we need to be prepairing for a trump win and round 2 of trump didnt win, round 3 c19 round 4 georgefloyd 2.0
Not to worry, Trump is behind him. But DeSantis is really too dumb to see the bus coming. He no longer serves any purpose to Trump, except maybe a tax break on Mar a Lago.
something wicked this way comes................  many compare trump to hitler............i think he's more like mussolini.
Love Rick Wilson. He is a republican but knows what damage Trump has done to their party. If only the rest of Reagan and Bush republicans would follow Rick Wilson
The Senate on Thursday joined the House in approving legislation that would rename bases like Fort Bragg and Fort Benning that are named for Confederate officers.
So upset with the no mouth republicans. How can they allow Trump to send in federal agents into Democratic cities. What happened to republicans cities. America wake up vote in November for Biden.
Your best threads are the ones that you write about yourself, though, the ones abt Trump's "genius" and "All is well" come in a close second:)

Why are all of Trump's gang getting out of prison due to COVID? What about the other prisoners? That's right, only the rich white people are getting out. That's what our government is like. Protect the rich white men. Kill those on the street that actually pay taxes.

Trump and his administration are trying to do like Putin. Kill off as many as possible. He has done everything Putin asked him to. His 36% of supporters should understand what he's doing. I don't think they want Putin in charge.
Yeah, Trump's record does speak for itself.  #CrossTalk
Trump and his administration are killing as many as possible. It's easy to take over and be the dictator. This is what Putin told him to do.
Trump wants to win so they are trying to say about us it’s really them. BLM, Trump started that shit early. We want the guns off our streets. We are not to send armed militant into citizens streets.
Trump is on board with whatever putin is planning.  He has been dismissing Russian hacking since the start. Republicans are fully on board. This is insane. #CrossTalk
The police are not for the people. They support trump. #AMJoy #CrossTalk
they are cozy because the zionist regime of israel owns trump &amp; kushner is a willing participant cause he's an old family friend of crazy netanyahu.  and bibi owns saudi arabia so there you go.
trump AND biden are both worthless.  YOU'RE the one spreading lies.
Ok dummy the trump organization runs the justice Dept... so he should probably just go ahead and do it... oh wait nothing happened!!!
Just another one of Trump's asskissers!
That sounds like Trump
In November every Biden supporter must get out and vote. Trump will be up to his cheating ways. We can’t let up. Don’t listen to the polls. America cannot let this racist heartless, narcissistic, and no empathy Trump live at WH another 4 yrs.
you need to resign.  we all know you are lying for trump.
We all know Russia helped Trump. I can't believe other than your supporters that you think we believe anything you say. Understand when you Constantly blame someone else you reflect of yourself.
The only way trump knows how to win is by cheating. #LastWord

Trump has attacked anyone who has ever  tried to hold him accountable. Now he's attacking voters. This must not be tolerated. #LastWord
"What can Putin offer trump in November?" Trump knows he's finished. He's becoming desperate. This pandemic is showing he doesn't care about people dying. Just hoping to vote him out in November is not good enough. Dems will need to grow a backbone. Fast. #Maddow
People really thought trump was  just gonna stop at undocumented immigrants. Or Puerto Rico. Or Comey. Or IG . Or Ambassadors.  Or Muslim Bans etc. He has been seeing what he can get away with. #Maddow
Trump has no honor. #inners
Trump never stops because he hasn't suffered any consequences. #inners

If you truly believe Donald Trump is morally &amp; intellectually qualified to be POTUS, &amp; that he is representing God’s values in America, you have lost all moral standing in my book, I have zero respect for you, &amp; I would never trust what you say about God or the Bible. Truth.

Covid-19  provided trump with the opportunity to prove  he was the "smartest" "i alone can fix it" president.  He failed. He has only made this crisis worse because he won't GET OUT OF THE WAY and let leaders lead.

President Donald Trump and a top Senate Republican are pushing Congress to preserve the names of military bases that honor Confederate generals, even though the House and Senate have overwhelmingly approved bills that rename them.
“Surging coronavirus deaths compete with the conviction that the pandemic is being hyped to undermine Trump’s reelection. With local case counts still relatively low, many people don’t doubt Covid-19 is real, but dismiss it as no worse than a bad flu.”

Agreed! Thought i was the only one that saw it this way,  i feel the recipe is “will trump leave” narrative combined w “foriegn interference” combined w a cpl of the recently accused cops getting off, and more c19 lockdowns.

Colorado here and I havent seen  even one Biden sign. Lots of Trump signs though.
Trump doesn’t give a shit about anyone including his administration and supporters. This thing wants as many to die as he can kill. He is only worried about his election and his ego. He wants Ivanka and Jared to become king and Queen. Wake up America, he lies and cheats.If the head of The Federalist Society is disavowing Trump it’s simply because Trump is no longer useful

I realize more everyday that the polls are being manipulated.  no one in their right mind would vote for Biden, including the Trump hating dems.  Biden, Bernie, AOC, Warren would ruin this country even before their VP takes over.
Understood, and I agree.  So lumping trump supporters with alcoholics isn't fair.  I finally agree with you.  I love some trump supporters I know, but I excuse them for that.   I see what you mean…  still I'd be suspicious of undiscovered human failings with a trump supporter…
I’m sure Herman’s stage 4 cancer May have had something to do w/his death, ya think?   Trump says he looks great in a mask; he never said he didn’t.  Pay attention.
Really, huh?  Trump has murdered everyone who has died in the US the last 3.5 yrs.  Talk about bloody tiny hands. ❤️.  MAGA bc Biden has nothing in his brain!
Good question!  The flaw is twisting your logic around to justify supporting someone as obviously faulted as Trump.  Believing what you want to believe.  Finding "TRUTH” in websites that match your preexisting inner beliefs.  Feeling persecuted by honest reporting.
Upon closer reflection I see your point of likening a trump supporter to alcoholics, but only in that both things are bad.  So it’s not a very interesting comparison and not one I intended to make.
Will trump be rolling up his sleeve?
Are you seriously that dumb or are you just a troll? You sound like a Trump supporter if I’ve ever heard one.
You didn’t give a damn about Herman Cain &amp; you’re politicizing his death by blaming Trump - as if.
Who likened Trump supporters to alcoholics?  Certainly not I.
Maybe if China hadn’t unleashed the virus on us?  How about Trump stopping flights?  Speak facts not hate.
If Trump would have paid his respects in person he would have been demonized by the left &amp; given msm fodder for their Hate.
Dems never miss an opportunity to hate on Trump, even a funeral.
Blame &amp; Hate Trump no matter how ignorant you are.
No. They had to because Trump did nothing to contain the virus in January and now 150,000+ Americans are unnecessarily dead. Hilarious! Ps- S Korea, Japan, New Zealand &amp; others contained covid &amp; are now operating normally, because they don't have a dipshit con artist in charge.

A Trump lackey.
Trump and Barr are directing the violence. The Portland courthouse firestarter was found to be an Aryan white supremacist, racist leader directed by the far right to incite violence among the peaceful protestors. #TrumpThreatensAmerica  #ImpeachTrumpAgain #TrumpleThinSkin
#TrumpStealsElection #TrumpFraud Trump has initiated step 1 of remaining in office or stealing the election.  Laying the foundation to declare voter fraud.  “There will be fraud, need to delay the election.”
Former Obama Activist: "Run Away" To Trump!  via       I Love this woman, she makes so much sense!
Yes. It's a fact that trump upheld the duties of the office.
But that's not the argument. JFC get treated for your trump derangement syndrome.
But...the picture shows a tiny head and yuge hands. That’s not tRump. #EndTheNightmare
Fantastic. The cool kids are ready to get rid of Trump.
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣 trump will be indicted Jan. 20.
His sisters not a judge anymore! No more mistrial defense. Or interferences.
“Respectable” conservatives like Calabresi have been telling me for 4½ years I was hysterically overreacting when I called Trump fascistic. “Trump Derangement Syndrome!” “You said that about Romney too!” (Nope.)  If they’ve finally realized they were wrong, great—but maybe say so
Still waiting for Trump's national plan to lower the COVID Rates, testing and contract tracing, make sure schools are safe and for us to have a safe national election.  When is he going to release?
The courthouse firestarter apprehended in Portland was found to be tied to a white supremacist, Aryan, racist group. He was directed by the far right to incite violence among the peaceful protesters. You're a moron. tRump's a racist. #TrumpleThinSkin
GDP is -32.9% this quarter, Trump is threatening to move the election, and we’ve lost 150,000 Americans to COVID-19.  #MAGA #Trump #JadeHelm #StopElectingPeopleWhoDontBelieveInGovernment
VERIFY: Video purports to show Trump on hot mic criticizing supporters over masks
And 2 dead with Ebola in 2014 make Obama a failed president , 150 k and counting dead Americans makes Trump a successful one ! That GOP for ya
Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
trump:  It's too dangerous to hold our election in November.  Also trump:  It's safe enough to send your babies to school right now.
⁦ : This one is for you!      You have echoed lies and defended demagoguery. It must sting to still be defending Trump.
You are dying breed, wrong side of history! You have and your Con man Trump has made China a more reliable country as compared to USA!
Rules for thee but not for me! Anyway, Trump’s tweet about delaying the 2020 election has probably already cured covid.
Im so sick and tired of these I voted Republican all my life and voted for trump because he was the lesser of two evils bullshitters. now months before his term ends with lowered chances of re-election gop voters have seen the light! FUCK YOU! Y’all made this. #FederalistSociety
Nah. Trump fully supports Absentee Ballots.  Let everyone vote absentee. That way we can ensure safety.
The people that were caught red handed trying to burn the courthouse in Portland were all associated with the firestarter, who was found out to be an Aryan, far right, white supremacist, fascist, Trump supporter. He was directed by the far right to create a riot. So there's that.
Also in spring 2016, Trump threatened violence by his supporters in order to discourage a delegate revolt at the 2016 GOP convention. That wasn’t “fascistic” enough for Mr. Calabresi, but this morning’s tweet is?  Again: I welcome his support. But I’d also appreciate a reckoning.
A year or so ago, my 81 year old trump supporting mother told me Tucker Carlson speaks her language. I’ll never forget it as long as I live.
So now it’s ‘Communist’ China? Is this all you and Trump have for the campaign? Don’t you have anything better to do than harass the NBA?
just can't quit LYING Just Kidding? Trump Says His Election Delay Tweet Was Just a Ploy to Get ‘Very Dishonest LameStream Media’ to Cover Mail-In Voting  #SmartNews
Well, I am a conservative. That's the point.  Regardless, it appears that  did oppose Trump's Tweet today.
is GOING DOWN... Number of Americans who fervently oppose Trump's reelection approaches point of no return  #SmartNews
...after he said in a GOP debate that he’d order a war crime (killing families of terrorists), and insisted generals would follow his illegal order because he would be a “strong” leader. Did Mr. Calabresi miss that debate? (It was the one where Trump also talked about his penis.)
Resistance libs love to talk about how they miss "not having to think about the president" when like they don't have to now either. They read about whatever trump is doing and say UGH I HATE HIM SO MUCH and then go back to their normal lives because it doesn't affect them
No masks Covidiots
tRump deflecting his minions’ attention back to Obama. It’s classic penis envy - Obama was the greatest President in recent history and tRump is the worst in all of history so bad tells you how bad good was - not fooled - Obama is a gentleman &amp; a scholar #TrumpIsLosing 🏌️‍♂️📱🍔💩🤡
The Trump virus was already here. And you still aren’t doing shit! How much is the bounty for a dead American? We know you don’t care about the Troops!!
Look, I welcome all converts, no matter how belated. But it would behoove folks like Mr. Calabresi to eventually acknowledge *they were wrong* to not see this coming, and gravely wrong to enable it. Trump has been “fascistic” all along. I first called him that in February 2016...
Trump’s gathering in OK dissing the wearing of masks and social distancing  caused Herman Cain’s death #TrumpHasBloodOnHisHands #TrumpLiesPeopleDie #TrumpIsNotWell
Trump 2020!!
Oh please. Y'all said that 4 years ago, and look at the shit Trump and Republicans have done to our country. He had 4 yrs. He's destroyed relationships w/ our allies. He's threatening to postpone the election. He's trampled our civil rights. He is destroying the planet.
Nope. Trump is a dweeb. He doesn't know enough about anything at all to "hate" it.
Be careful!  The trump family is looting the national treasures!
Sounds a lot like Trump's goon squad.
She's a Trump follower and watches Fox News, so of course she wouldn't have seen it. Not that, that matters anyway.
But that's not something trump has done that no other one has... that's just fulfilling the role of the office.
Which is worse:  Trump on TV or a tornado overhead?
Wrote this 10 days ago...almost nobody seemed to have noticed that Dems were trying to give the Department of Homeland Security $50 billion at the very moment Dems were issuing press releases pretending to be mad at Trump for deploying DHS police to cities

I just wanted to tell my fellow Trump supporters to strap in! If you think election years are bad, you haven’t seen nothing yet. I predict the next 96 days are going to be the most brutal we’ve ever seen. Stay safe, stay smart and DONT fall for the traps
Do you have ANY proof whatsoever his cancer came back? Do you have any explanation for why he was perfectly healthy walking around the Trump Tulsa rally in June? Give me a fucking break
Rad! Proud that my buddy  could set the *president of the United States* straight in this great op-ed about how easy and safe it is to run an election by mail, as we do in Colorado. No matter your political beliefs, the facts are crystal clear.
and you think those obama to trump voters are coming back to mush brain biden? lol
I don't think this decline and Trump getting Elected is a coincidence.
Lost my boy a few weeks ago. When we think the world should end, they remind us that pure love actually exists and we are worth it. Btw Trump doesn’t have a dog. Kinda explains a lot doesn’t it?
and you think those “normies” voted for trump because the economy (under obama) was benefiting them? you really think swing voters for trump were basing their decision on the economy? lol
I keep thinking we need the trump lookalike like the movie Dave to come in and make him look like an actual somewhat intelligent, caring human being! Too much to ask?
So would a biden presidency. You have given nothing other than orange man bad. If trump is so terrible, give me 5 things he has done that no other president has?
Why would Trump worry about his supporters? He doesn't even like most of them.
Still gonna stand by this statement that you knew was bullshit then and we all saw/heard it today, you Trump enabling sycophant .
Trump killed him just like he killed 150,000 others. He needed his narcissist supply met. He needs to be worshiped by his sheep or he can’t take it!

Just exactly how well do you think Trump is going to do in the debates?!
Ok. I’m going to scream now.  Two questions ONLY for Trump. 1 why hasn’t he done something about Putin killing our soldiers. 2. What is he going to do about the economy NOW?
C’mon, man. Why can’t   just discuss why tRump’s actions are negligent, treasonous, and impeachable without the unsubstantiated vitriol towards Obama? Immaterial to this article and sinks the plot with whataboutisms. tRump’s actions stand alone. #EndTheNightmare
Trump doesn’t understand that the young aren’t the only ones who will be in schools, teachers, administrators, janitors, substitutes will not be immune, and neither will be the kids! That’s a lie, are you willing to bet your child’s life on Trump’s lies?
You want to shield your pals from lawsuits, cut unemployment, give money to big coprporatins and build a building to help Trump make more money.
So will you wear a mask at the next Trump rally Lady G?
Has Mr Schwartz totaled the campaign donations that have landed in Trump Enterprise’s bank account? I have been doing some reading on that topic. Reminds me of when the Trump family was forced to shutter their “Foundation” because they used it as a personal piggy bank. Grifters.

The fact that the head of the Federalist Society just called for Trump's removal AFTER they got all their wingnut judges on the courts tells you they viewed him as a useful idiot all along.
I did.  And you’re right. O isn’t sincere. He’s fake - a puppet for others. Doesn’t care cuz he’s rich &amp; narcissistic. The worst narcissist to come on the political scene ever. And since.  Trump’s got a huge ego, but there’s a huge difference.

In other words , trump has no plan.  He’s good at making ultimatems, poor at guidelines, financing help for states dealing with the virus, and protecting the electorate.
This seems like a set up in the making.
Let’s start with who Trump put in charge, his son-in-law. I repeat. His son-in-law. *tap tap tap* Hey Republicans, can you hear me?! Son. In. Law.

Delay the Election . The only thing embarrassing about our elections is that Trump is the Liar , Big Liar !

Fucking Delusional Donnie Trump rambling Gaslighting his supporters  #BunkerBoy
ICYBN (In case you been nappin'): I've been predicting that Trump will try to delay or scrap the election. Today's tweet is a trial balloon. He and the puppeteers will learn where the resistance is, and how the move can be more effective. The move comes in Oct. Chaos is the goal.
So how is Trump acting now that he learned he can’t delay the election? Or has he accepted that yet? Are they still explaining it to him using small words?
I was furious at NPR because they reported Trump’s press conference saying that “ he’s asking Democrats to cooperate in getting help in terms of help for the unemployed. Nothing about Rs dragging their feet and trying to cut unemployment to $200 from $600.
Do you know how stupid you sound. Only the Republicans are doing that shit. Your boy Devin said so his Damn self. He said it's the only the Republican party is going to win this November. So ur goal is to stop us. all the while trump and u are doing the exact same shit.

I love the mail in voting that we have in Colorado and will definitely be using vis mail in ballot in November to vote against Donald Trump and there not a thang that him and Putin can do about it.
It was only a matter of time. Trump supporters harassing my b.i.l. for being too brown in Colo. Told him to go back home. 1/3 of his ancestors have always called S. Colorado home. The rest were here before the United States existed. Now my child wants to avoid getting a tan.😠
I truly believe what Mary Trump said, that Donald Trump would have loved nothing better, than to have been the one with his knee on the neck of George Floyd. That is exactly what he is doing now, by suppressing the vote !
Saying that Trump "can't" delay the election is answering the wrong question. The real question is: What happens when he tries? Suppose one—or a few—governors go along with him? Saying "they can't" dodges the question again. What brand of chaos ensues?
#WeWillVote for Trump to hit the road.
He’s Dead ‘cause he did what Trump told him to do!!!!  Naively went to the Tulsa Rally without Social Distancing or wearing a mask!!!!!!

This presser today with Trump was worse than you can imagine.  I've started watching again, not because I can stomach him now, but I'm watching the cognitive decline.  I predict he just crumbles around the 2nd week of October.
Worst GDP un US history, thanks Trump!
Let’s get this straight.  In 2016, We went for the red curtain.  This year, there is no curtain.  We know you and your character.  No longer are we blind.  We choose the blue stage.  Biden and trump are both known to us now.

Total silence from Cory and the  about Trump interfering with the presidential election.  The  is weak and corrupt.
Lmaooo. And yet everything trump has ever said doesn’t.
Trump is simply evil
Then it’s a good thing that mail-in isn’t actually fraught with fraud. That’s just nonsense that Trump wants people to believe.
Trump has caused 150k deaths in this country with his inaction and nonsense. Cain and the others in Tulsa are victims of Trump And their own stupidity. I won’t say he deserved to die, but I do hope his death is a call to action for these bozos and their 🤡 leader.
Maybe consider the context before responding with your hot take on all Americans. I most definitely do NOT miss the Bush fam. The point was simple: Trump is such an egregious piece of shit that it makes you miss literally any other president.
Trump's already told us he doesn't kid and we know that is true because humor is a higher level of development and he's not there. Anytime someone says he was joking you can count on it being a lie.
If he can stand up to Jim Crow laws, everything that he did, sacrifice what he gave, we can surely stand up to Trump.  Follow his example and lead.  He showed us the way, and did it with love.

It is the end of The Republic. I don't see how we can come back from this. It's not just Trump, it is the block he represents. We cannot see each other's views. We speak different languages. We apparently worship different Gods. This is gonna be crazy. Not the good kind.
As previously tweeted, all the people that want a rifle designed to kill people on a battlefield can vote for Trump.  All the people who afraid for the kids or themselves, at a school, church, synagogue or Walmart can vote for Joe. I can live with it.

Sigh. All the Trump humpers are dumb. It's so tiring explaining things to you, especially when you seem incapable of comprehending.  "Mail-in voting" (in most states) is the same as absentee voting. The voter requests a ballot.   Only In CO HI OR UT &amp; WA is it all vote-by-mail.

What Trump jbasically said in this #WhiteHouse briefing is that WHEN the #election is held in November, and WHEN he loses, he will contest the results and try to drag it out for months if not years and refuse to leave the White House - so basically, become an illegal squatter.
Here in Colorado, everyone is mailed a ballot. However, you don't have to return it by mail. You can drop your ballot off in a ballot box at the county clerk's office or other designated locations. I highly recommend this given Trump's ongoing efforts to destroy the Post Office.
Every time Trump shits his pants he yells at China 🇨🇳... never his fault

Because it has never been big enough for Democrats to steal elections with, until now. The fact that the Trump hating zealots are so anxious to have everything done through mail without any face-to-face verification says everything you need to know about why they want it.

Trump’s let’s-trash-democracy bid to distract from day’s terrible economic news was rejected by every Republican I’ve seen: McConnell, Cruz, Rubio, McCarthy and also  And only Trump would say it on the day of voting-rights-champion John Lewis’ funeral. #cosen
He also should have eschewed going to Trump rallies, but RIP
Tell Facebook to stop allowing right-wing politicians to spread lies and misinformation!
#SeattleRiots AND THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING !   Shared via Right News
Shorter Steven Calabresi take: "I've taken godawful, inexplicable, entirely partisan positions on Trump's innumerable crimes and other misdeeds for years now, but this one thing is finally a bridge too far."  I mean, good for him, but also, whatevs.
"It could have been stopped..." Did Trump just acknowledge phucked up?
Well. Okay then. I thought for sure they'd hold onto Trump with their cold dead fingers, anything to keep power.
The Federalist Society founder, is now calling on Trump to be impeached again for attempting to delay the election, any comment? Or are you going to continue to ignore the fact that you are supporting a racist dictator?
TRUMP IS FUCKING ILLITERATE!   He can't pronounce "Plasma" correctly!  I just.... UGH!!!!!!!!!  #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K #TrumpFailedAmerica
tRump just claimed that Oregon, Illinois, Washington are all having resurgences and that Florida and Texas are containing the virus. He just lies. #trumpvirus #voteblue #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #wewillvote #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K #TrumpKillsUS
It is really baffling to me. When people I know personally tell me they still like Trump I'm like "Have you heard him speak?" I just don't get it. They must want to watch the world burn.
Trump has no chance heck he shut down Republican primaries because it was possible that he wouldn't even get the Republican nomination and he's the party leader.
Why are Republicans and mostly Trump working so hard for Russia. Isn't he supposed to be the President of the United States instead? #TraitorInChief
Shut up!! We’re definitely voting just for TRUMP!!
So which would look worse for trump. Saving countless lives and suppressing COVID (like nearly every other competent country so far) while temporarily tanking the economy, or letting 150,000+ die while, get this, STILL tanking the economy
If Trump got the chance Moscow Mitch would ramrod it through the Senate on Jan 19th.
Trump is now justifying the deaths of those who have died — many of whom are elderly.  This is sickening to listen to.
This man Trump is using this press conference he called “urgently” to tell us how bad other countries are doing with corona 😂😂 not the usa with 60k new cases a day and 1k deaths, but Japan, Israel and Latam lol no shame ffs
Trump.
Oh, &amp; I'd be remiss if I didn't add that all of this would've been true with or without COVID-19 but COVID-19 pandemic &amp; the historic failure of Trump's gov in handling it (or success, - I still think they partly purposefully let it get this bad) makes this that much more urgent.
A story about Trump's tweet today and why it's illegal and Q&amp;A about it. Thought it might be helpful.
It's sad to see ppl leveraging #HermanCain's death as a means to promote the mast vs. anti-mask debate. This man died, his family is grieving.   I'm pro-mask, anti-Trump and identify as a progressive Democrat.. but man. The left really needs to stop vilifying the right like this.
Sounds like he was extremely stupid to not be wearing a mask during a pandemic then, don't you think? Anyway, Trump's quack doctor said it's a cure so why didn't it work?
Yes &amp; no. Had Trump, Fox News, GOP taken this shit seriously last yr, took the necessary precautions &amp; not politicized the crap out of it &amp; required a mask mandate outside of the home, maybe these idiots who boast about not wearing a mask, wouldn't get sick &amp; die from COVID-19.
I guess I don't see the point of your tweet either? Like Trump is gonna stop acting like a petty dictator because people are settling for biden? Or people who feel disenfranchised by the system are gonna be like "Wow they are being upfront the system sucks I am gonna vote now!"
Til we get Tom Cotton coasting off of racist Republicans' nostalgia for the Trump years? Because that's terrifying. So... hopefully  is up to the task here, because he has a lot of work to do to not only clean up after Trump, but prevent the next one.
Now’s not the time, but you don’t really seem to have a problem with Trump so go ahead and vote third party - that’s a vote that historically helps the incumbent. If you feel this way you should immediately log off and start knocking on doors
Oh a sexist for Trump, how novel.  And you see nothing wrong with the way you just responded, do you, given that you disagree with her. Wonder if your mother and grandmother would approve of you talking to a woman that way?  Don’t kid yourself.
Ranked choice voting. Voter's Bill of Rights. Student loan forgiveness. (Now I'm just ticking off my political fantasy wishes but like, the first part of all of this? Necessary to avoid another Trump. Just saying.)
The account it was on had Trump 2020 all over it.
thanks for proving that exceptions to voting rules happen and thus acknowledging that a shitty economy isn’t necessarily an election death sentence for trump
ruh roh:  Federalist Society co-founder calls Trump’s election delay ‘fascistic’ — and demands impeachment -
So what shiny object is trump going to throw out there today during the #clownshow    Covid is dire, the economy has tanked..?   I guess #Hydroxychloroquine and moving, I mean stealing the election ?    What this space I guess.
We need to, over the next four years (assuming Trump loses and actually leaves), start passing laws to enshrine our norms surrounding presidents into law. No more running without immediately releasing tax returns. No more being able to run any kind of business while running.
You miss a president who can put lipstick on a pig. Trump is trash, but he’s so dangerous because of your party’s decades long attack on democracy and the feckless Democrats working only for their corporate bosses.
The November election will be an absolute SHAM and I am URGING every Patriotic American who supports President Trump to BOYCOTT the election by refusing to vote.
Cool, vote third party and watch when Biden or Trump is elected
The more powerful the resistance against Trump becomes, the more agitated he becomes, &amp; the more racism he spews! He doesn't deserve to be called "President," he should be referred to as "the impeached President!". That's what he is. Any other Pres. would have been removed by now
It really isn’t. Trump is unhinged and Biden’s not a threat.
AAPL UP AMZN UP MARKET UP TRUMP WINS AGAIN
as they could have been (and yes, I'm saying that knowing every single awful thing that has happened the last few years) is because Trump is incompetent. Ivanka isn't incompetent. Tom Cotton isn't incompetent. Both are just as fascist but in prettier and more palatable packages.
Trump killed Mr. Cain because of trumps selfishness
Why Trump Has No Power to Postpone the 2020 Election
So like, great, thanks for paying attention now, but don't you dare stop at impeaching Trump and making sure he isn't re-elected, because holy hell Ivanka and Jared are still going to be in the country making who knows what political moves. Most of the reason things aren't as bad
A related question - did any of them have reputations to uphold before Trump?
“The Catholic Church in the United States has long advocated for the Dreamers and we will continue to stand with them,” said Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles.
Also none of these people said boo when we started locking brown kids up in cages even under Obama, and then when the program expanded to taking away children from their parents under Trump they applauded it.  So, let's not pretend that we haven't always had a fascist undertone.
Every time Trump talks his mouth looks like he's giving someone a blow job.
Well, when you play with fire and everybody that doesn't think exactly like you has been telling you it's fire for *at lest* five years (and Trump didn't come out of the clear blue sky, so that's being real generous).... you're gonna get burned.
WRONG.  Colorado has been voting by mail for decades.  It works, it's safe, TRUMP is just a scared whiny little bit*chA Trump lackey.
Trump and Barr are directing the violence. The Portland courthouse firestarter was found to be an Aryan white supremacist, racist leader directed by the far right to incite violence among the peaceful protestors. #TrumpThreatensAmerica  #ImpeachTrumpAgain #TrumpleThinSkin
#TrumpStealsElection #TrumpFraud Trump has initiated step 1 of remaining in office or stealing the election.  Laying the foundation to declare voter fraud.  “There will be fraud, need to delay the election.”
Former Obama Activist: "Run Away" To Trump!  via       I Love this woman, she makes so much sense!
Yes. It's a fact that trump upheld the duties of the office.
But that's not the argument. JFC get treated for your trump derangement syndrome.
Fantastic. The cool kids are ready to get rid of Trump.
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣 trump will be indicted Jan. 20.
His sisters not a judge anymore! No more mistrial defense. Or interferences.
“Respectable” conservatives like Calabresi have been telling me for 4½ years I was hysterically overreacting when I called Trump fascistic. “Trump Derangement Syndrome!” “You said that about Romney too!” (Nope.)  If they’ve finally realized they were wrong, great—but maybe say so
Still waiting for Trump's national plan to lower the COVID Rates, testing and contract tracing, make sure schools are safe and for us to have a safe national election.  When is he going to release?
The courthouse firestarter apprehended in Portland was found to be tied to a white supremacist, Aryan, racist group. He was directed by the far right to incite violence among the peaceful protesters. You're a moron. tRump's a racist. #TrumpleThinSkin

And 2 dead with Ebola in 2014 make Obama a failed president , 150 k and counting dead Americans makes Trump a successful one ! That GOP for ya
Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
trump:  It's too dangerous to hold our election in November.  Also trump:  It's safe enough to send your babies to school right now.
⁦ : This one is for you!      You have echoed lies and defended demagoguery. It must sting to still be defending Trump.
You are dying breed, wrong side of history! You have and your Con man Trump has made China a more reliable country as compared to USA!
Rules for thee but not for me! Anyway, Trump’s tweet about delaying the 2020 election has probably already cured covid.
Im so sick and tired of these I voted Republican all my life and voted for trump because he was the lesser of two evils bullshitters. now months before his term ends with lowered chances of re-election gop voters have seen the light! FUCK YOU! Y’all made this. #FederalistSociety
Nah. Trump fully supports Absentee Ballots.  Let everyone vote absentee. That way we can ensure safety.
The people that were caught red handed trying to burn the courthouse in Portland were all associated with the firestarter, who was found out to be an Aryan, far right, white supremacist, fascist, Trump supporter. He was directed by the far right to create a riot. So there's that.
Also in spring 2016, Trump threatened violence by his supporters in order to discourage a delegate revolt at the 2016 GOP convention. That wasn’t “fascistic” enough for Mr. Calabresi, but this morning’s tweet is?  Again: I welcome his support. But I’d also appreciate a reckoning.
A year or so ago, my 81 year old trump supporting mother told me Tucker Carlson speaks her language. I’ll never forget it as long as I live.
So now it’s ‘Communist’ China? Is this all you and Trump have for the campaign? Don’t you have anything better to do than harass the NBA?
just can't quit LYING Just Kidding? Trump Says His Election Delay Tweet Was Just a Ploy to Get ‘Very Dishonest LameStream Media’ to Cover Mail-In Voting  #SmartNews
Well, I am a conservative. That's the point.  Regardless, it appears that  did oppose Trump's Tweet today.
is GOING DOWN... Number of Americans who fervently oppose Trump's reelection approaches point of no return  #SmartNews
...after he said in a GOP debate that he’d order a war crime (killing families of terrorists), and insisted generals would follow his illegal order because he would be a “strong” leader. Did Mr. Calabresi miss that debate? (It was the one where Trump also talked about his penis.)
Resistance libs love to talk about how they miss "not having to think about the president" when like they don't have to now either. They read about whatever trump is doing and say UGH I HATE HIM SO MUCH and then go back to their normal lives because it doesn't affect them
tRump deflecting his minions’ attention back to Obama. It’s classic penis envy - Obama was the greatest President in recent history and tRump is the worst in all of history so bad tells you how bad good was - not fooled - Obama is a gentleman &amp; a scholar #TrumpIsLosing 🏌️‍♂️📱🍔💩🤡
The Trump virus was already here. And you still aren’t doing shit! How much is the bounty for a dead American? We know you don’t care about the Troops!!
Look, I welcome all converts, no matter how belated. But it would behoove folks like Mr. Calabresi to eventually acknowledge *they were wrong* to not see this coming, and gravely wrong to enable it. Trump has been “fascistic” all along. I first called him that in February 2016...
Trump 2020!!
Oh please. Y'all said that 4 years ago, and look at the shit Trump and Republicans have done to our country. He had 4 yrs. He's destroyed relationships w/ our allies. He's threatening to postpone the election. He's trampled our civil rights. He is destroying the planet.
Nope. Trump is a dweeb. He doesn't know enough about anything at all to "hate" it.
Be careful!  The trump family is looting the national treasures!
Sounds a lot like Trump's goon squad.
She's a Trump follower and watches Fox News, so of course she wouldn't have seen it. Not that, that matters anyway.
But that's not something trump has done that no other one has... that's just fulfilling the role of the office.
Which is worse:  Trump on TV or a tornado overhead?
Wrote this 10 days ago...almost nobody seemed to have noticed that Dems were trying to give the Department of Homeland Security $50 billion at the very moment Dems were issuing press releases pretending to be mad at Trump for deploying DHS police to cities

Do you have ANY proof whatsoever his cancer came back? Do you have any explanation for why he was perfectly healthy walking around the Trump Tulsa rally in June? Give me a fucking break
Rad! Proud that my buddy  could set the *president of the United States* straight in this great op-ed about how easy and safe it is to run an election by mail, as we do in Colorado. No matter your political beliefs, the facts are crystal clear.
and you think those obama to trump voters are coming back to mush brain biden? lol
I don't think this decline and Trump getting Elected is a coincidence.
Lost my boy a few weeks ago. When we think the world should end, they remind us that pure love actually exists and we are worth it. Btw Trump doesn’t have a dog. Kinda explains a lot doesn’t it?
and you think those “normies” voted for trump because the economy (under obama) was benefiting them? you really think swing voters for trump were basing their decision on the economy? lol
I keep thinking we need the trump lookalike like the movie Dave to come in and make him look like an actual somewhat intelligent, caring human being! Too much to ask?
So would a biden presidency. You have given nothing other than orange man bad. If trump is so terrible, give me 5 things he has done that no other president has?
Why would Trump worry about his supporters? He doesn't even like most of them.
Still gonna stand by this statement that you knew was bullshit then and we all saw/heard it today, you Trump enabling sycophant .

Ok. I’m going to scream now.  Two questions ONLY for Trump. 1 why hasn’t he done something about Putin killing our soldiers. 2. What is he going to do about the economy NOW?
Trump doesn’t understand that the young aren’t the only ones who will be in schools, teachers, administrators, janitors, substitutes will not be immune, and neither will be the kids! That’s a lie, are you willing to bet your child’s life on Trump’s lies?
You want to shield your pals from lawsuits, cut unemployment, give money to big coprporatins and build a building to help Trump make more money.
Has Mr Schwartz totaled the campaign donations that have landed in Trump Enterprise’s bank account? I have been doing some reading on that topic. Reminds me of when the Trump family was forced to shutter their “Foundation” because they used it as a personal piggy bank. Grifters.

ICYBN (In case you been nappin'): I've been predicting that Trump will try to delay or scrap the election. Today's tweet is a trial balloon. He and the puppeteers will learn where the resistance is, and how the move can be more effective. The move comes in Oct. Chaos is the goal.
So how is Trump acting now that he learned he can’t delay the election? Or has he accepted that yet? Are they still explaining it to him using small words?
I was furious at NPR because they reported Trump’s press conference saying that “ he’s asking Democrats to cooperate in getting help in terms of help for the unemployed. Nothing about Rs dragging their feet and trying to cut unemployment to $200 from $600.

I love the mail in voting that we have in Colorado and will definitely be using vis mail in ballot in November to vote against Donald Trump and there not a thang that him and Putin can do about it.
It was only a matter of time. Trump supporters harassing my b.i.l. for being too brown in Colo. Told him to go back home. 1/3 of his ancestors have always called S. Colorado home. The rest were here before the United States existed. Now my child wants to avoid getting a tan.😠
I truly believe what Mary Trump said, that Donald Trump would have loved nothing better, than to have been the one with his knee on the neck of George Floyd. That is exactly what he is doing now, by suppressing the vote !
Saying that Trump "can't" delay the election is answering the wrong question. The real question is: What happens when he tries? Suppose one—or a few—governors go along with him? Saying "they can't" dodges the question again. What brand of chaos ensues?

Then it’s a good thing that mail-in isn’t actually fraught with fraud. That’s just nonsense that Trump wants people to believe.
Trump has caused 150k deaths in this country with his inaction and nonsense. Cain and the others in Tulsa are victims of Trump And their own stupidity. I won’t say he deserved to die, but I do hope his death is a call to action for these bozos and their 🤡 leader.
Maybe consider the context before responding with your hot take on all Americans. I most definitely do NOT miss the Bush fam. The point was simple: Trump is such an egregious piece of shit that it makes you miss literally any other president.
Trump's already told us he doesn't kid and we know that is true because humor is a higher level of development and he's not there. Anytime someone says he was joking you can count on it being a lie.
If he can stand up to Jim Crow laws, everything that he did, sacrifice what he gave, we can surely stand up to Trump.  Follow his example and lead.  He showed us the way, and did it with love.

Well beehive is a new trump word. Was it a beautiful beehive or was it a very very very large beehive that no one has ever seen before
Are there ANY former United States President’s or Vice President’s who support  Donald Trump? Asking for a friend...
Two Thirds Of Voters Expect Far Left Violence If Trump Wins, Democrats A...  via

Hardest hit industries make sure you mention that your Trump empire benefited the most.
Sorry, China Virus is so February.  Now, with your assistance it is Trump Virus.  Congratulations.
6:15pm Trump threatens if protestors do not clear the streets. The National Guard will go in and take care of things. He calls these protestors “professional Anarchists”. 😠
Just another Trump lie. It was the Trump virus.
And he caught  it at a Trump Rally in Tulsa.  And we only know this because Cain is famous.. How many others got sick and/or died to feed Trump’s ego that night? It is a tragedy that never should have happened.
I'm guessing they are trying to cast out the demon inside Trump, right? Did I get it right?
The Impeached  is worried about money &amp; other country’s  paying there way. The citizens of the United States file Class action suit against Trump and the Trump  children for reimbursement of golf trips and trips taken two other countries.
6:15pm Donald trump deliberately announces that COVID-19 is Chinas Fault 🥱
‘Undemocratic, Outrageous And Insulting’: Gov. Jared Polis Reacts To Trump’s Tweet About Delaying Election
A Trump presidency 🤦🏼‍♀️
Trump’s tone....sounded like he was heavily drugged.  And his skin tone??YOU'RE IN LUCK! I'm almost 110% sure (Trump math) that we will ALL know the results of the election ON ELECTION NIGHT!(for the seventh time) But on election night will be the last time we get told that our prayers have been answered &amp; you're moving to Fl! At least until the trial
You’re right. Trump the President, the leader of our country, has no responsibility in all of this!! GTFO!   So what is the President responsible for?? Our tanking economy? The 4 trillion he added to the deficit? The wall that broke during the hurricane? STFU troll.
MAKE SURE YOU REGISTER TO VOTE AND GET YOUR VOTE IN ON TIME! Remember we aren’t trying to win a fair election...we are trying to win a rigged election!!  Do all you can to help save America from Trump! #8645ElevenThree20 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #trumppresser
So you are OK with Trump for 4 more years.? Bye 👋
I mean his wife is a big time trump supporter and she’s Latina 🤦🏽‍♀️ I am not surprised at all.
Trump has threatened the very fabric of the Republic. He should be arrested for treason.
Yes, such a disaster compared to trump. Tons of sexual assault allegations. Etc.
TRUMP is an IDIOT‼️💁🏼‍♀️...Duh
Tin soldiers of Trump are coming White nationalists on the go This summer I hear the drumming Federal goons in Portland O Better get used to it Constitution is gone Started in three years ago Alliances crumbling viral deaths abound How will you vote now that you know? #WeWillVote
But I was told if we all stopped wearing masks in the summer the Trump Virus would disappear, like a miracle. No?
The trump family is a hate group, and you're a groupie they hold in contempt,  because they actually despise their sycophants.  You are being used. You will be discarded.
WHY is TRUMP at PODIUM talking about Covid19 &amp; Plasma Donation...WHERE is FAUCI⁉️😳
Trump lies and lies and lies. There is no ending to the way he deceives the American people!
Vote by mail isn’t fraudulent. Voting for Trump is!!!
Why does Trump use #FakeNewsMedia when it’s complimentary to making his point???  Then calls it #FakeNews when he doesn’t agree with it. #hippocrasy #TrumpIsACrybaby #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Trump blames China however this is the Trump Virus !!
HOW COME POLIS DIDN'T DO THAT FOR ANTIFA AND BLM IN DENVER THEY PORTECT(DEM') THUNG'S AND LOOTERS ANYTHING TO DO ABOUT CONTROL AND GETTING TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE. KEEP OPEN WELD COUNTY COWBOY UP. TAKE THEM TO COURT FOR VIOLATING ARE RIGHT'S. THEY LIKE THIS SOCAILIST CONTROL OF US.
Trump will let Trevor Reed rot in a Russian jail before he upsets his Daddy Putin by calling for his release.
THEY SAY IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT THE KIDS WELL COVID HAS PROVED OTHERWISE THERE SELFISH HYPOCRITES AND USNG IT (COVID) AS POLITICAL PLATFORM TO GET TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE. OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE LET THERE KIDS GO TO SCHOOL AND SO FAR THERE ARE NO CASES THAT KIDS GAVE TEACHERS THE VIRUS.
Trump has never paid his bills, see his book, and he is proud of it. So if you are providing campaign services, perhaps think of getting paid up front
Chris Stirewalt said Trump made a mistake in his comment about delaying the November election.  Who really cares what this goon thinks.  He got 2016 wrong and he will get 2020 wrong because he is partisan.
Oh Eric. That was a different time and Bill is a Democrat. Yo know the Press practically wet themselves if Trump or the GOP look at them cross-eyed.
Thx Liz, Trump may be destroying the  at this moment we can't let him destroy the country for his own corrupt self interest! #VoteHimOut
[Insert viral commentary on Trump’s latest dangerousness here]
Exactly it’s never the same shit her podcast is exactly that crying about trump she has one target market and that’s people that want to listen to her bitch about trump.
You can't say if he did or did not contract the virus at the rally. He didn't get a "now infected" bubble over his head. Go talk to Trump about it and condemn the lack of preparedness and action that led to this point. Cain was a victim of that inaction and false narrative.
You misspelled Trump
Sen. Cory Gardner will face former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper in November for the U.S. Senate seat he now holds.
This didn’t age very well
No, if you seriously can't see the qualitative &amp; quantitative, non-partisan ways that Donald Trump is radically &amp; negatively different from other American presidents then you are either in denial, out of touch w/ current events &amp; historic parallels or just having people on.
March to YOUR Death with TRUMP
You can do that, but the candidate won't win for a multitude of reasons, the most vital being they are unrecognized as either a candidate or a viable choice.  Yet, all those wasted votes will become indirect votes for Trump &amp; bestow culpability if he wins again by a small margin.
How 'bout we don't, when the President in question is a raving narcissistic fascist w/o a single regard for any type of morality, law, common sense, science or reality. If you get Trump for 4 more years, there won't be the option of ANY parties beyond what they call themselves.
The American people don't want $8 billion in military hardware, you turtle-faced Trump lackey.
ABSOLUTELY...Signatures are checked...PRISON is REAL‼️  TRUMP just touts on FEAR‼️  Mail-In VOTING will SAVE LIVES‼️  Congress—Pass NATIONAL HOLIDAY for Presidential ELECTION...LONG OVERDO‼️       Do the RIGHT THING‼️💁🏼‍♀️
Bleep Trump, stay on the prize! Vote  2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
And that he got COVID after not wearing a mask at a Trump rally
#WeWillVote Trump will lose!
Trump managing Putin's fortune is something I don't see Vlad ever doing considering the way Trump "manages" his own money.
Ya know  you could still agree to remove Trump, and probably save yourselves losing in November, or you could destroy the Republic.
TO CLARIFY: I devoted years of my life to creating cartoons against the Bush/Cheney regime + the death + destruction they caused. I'm infuriated when people try to rewrite Bush history in the face of Trump. Was just struck that when GOP seems to hit bottom, it keeps going lower.
Um, Fuck Trump, that's the tweet, that's all!

Dear Senator, President Trump just suggested the Nov 3rd election should be delayed, are you supporting the President on this idea?
I hear you, and thanks for calling it out. I should have phrased it differently. I so disagree with people absolving Bush due to the contrast with Trump. I was just struck seeing GWB (infamous for mangling words) well-spoken (and not racist, like the current GOP)
Then why is Trump using it without having Covid? Go ahead...
I think TRUMP is trying to instigate a RACE WAR NOW by sending HIS contractor Gestopo military to Democratic run AMERICAN cities...AMERICANS aren’t having this...white nationals r provoking violence to give TRUMP reason😤 AMERICA is READY for a fight🥊but HIS base are WUSSES‼️💁🏼‍♀️
Trump wants to delay the elections. No.
Trump really is a chicken shit, today would be a good day for you to endorse
TRUMP treats are ALLIES like ENEMIES &amp; Our ENEMIES like FRIENDS‼️😳...WTF 💁🏼‍♀️
Ordered By Putin...Enacted by TRUMP...YOU do the MATH‼️😤  Putin is Laughing at US‼️🤬
Jeez, Herman Cain just died because he had to make a point at a Trump rally. Wear your fucking masks.
So I should believe in a person’s ideas when they don’t know simple spelling? Ha, no thanks. But you like Trump, so I can see how you forgive all those Trump memes with misspellings. It’s a coping mechanism, i get it.
Ya, he probably shouldn't have been caught up in the Trump hoax
Trump just tweeted out a suggestion we delay the election.
I assume he got COVID at Trump’s Tulsa rally??
It’s not OK to support Trump or the GOP that support him. You can be a conservative/republican but for the sake of your own ideologies, you should hate the current adminastration as much as the rest of us.
I get how people can romanticize Obama now 4 years into trump. But Jesus they forget how awful his administration really was for a lot of people
I am a trans queer citizen who voted for you and now YOU are letting Donald Trump murder me and my siblings on national television. Still want to have queer friends in three years? Get off your ass.
She called COVID the Trump virus, what an insult! /s
Trump wants to delay the election but mail in ballots are the fraud?
If Trump doesn’t want to lose then he could just resign or decline to run again. Better late than never!
But ONE thing is FOR SURE...  TRUMP has talked to PUTIN 9 Fucking TIMES recently—9Xs😳 NO readout of CALL Substance💁🏼‍♀️  PUTIN is HELPING with this Re-ELECTION YOU can BE SURE‼️😳  Finally TRUMP finds the ONE Government that will HELP HIM‼️
WHAT Does PUTIN have on TRUMP⁉️💁🏼‍♀️
BEWARE Resisters of this CORRUPT GOVERNMENT...TRUMP has had 9 CALLS with PUTIN lately without Read-Outs of Substance&amp; ALL of Sudden The USA r MOVING 12,000 troops out of GERMANY—JUST what PUTIN wanted‼️😳 TRUMP says it’s about MONEY‼️😂Please🤣  BOTS &amp; TROLLS r EVERYWHERE AGAIN‼️
What pisses you off most? The gay marriage thing? Oh. Reading to kids. I'm sure you were angry as hell when he found and killed Bin Laden. Or maybe even the damn tan suit which he still looks better in than trump has his whole term. I still think it's racism. Your leader runs it.
It's in the thread, it's just in a non trump zone so you have to look even harder
Only teachers are not federally employed and Trump can't fire them. But otherwise perfect plan!
Sounds like a better agenda to me than the single issue politics of  - Trump and only Trump.
Except you don’t speak up for Mainers. You don’t speak up for anyone in this country except Trump.
Russia pays the Trump family an undisclosed amount of money on an undisclosed schedule of payment for an as of yet undisclosed purpose. Now what was your point again?
Hey, with our current leader, I may very well NEED a medical professional to follow. Although the term "medical professional" is kinda up in the air since last night when Trump invited a voodoo doctor to serve on the Covid task force! UNBELIEVABLE!
He did all of that, plus things well never know about, all while keeping his dignity &amp; never turning INTO those he fought against. More of a man than I.  Trump says something stupid &amp; I instantly tweet-"You are a moron. You can't be this stupid!" John wouldn't have. Great man!
I'd like to introduce you to my wall. This is my wall. Thanks for the smile you helped give me today &amp; trust me when I say it wasn't easy. Maybe Trump will resign tomorrow. 😁
I plan on sleeping tonight, so I can't think about what a Trump Univ degree would look like, how much it cost, or how many professors of the same subject it would take him to complete a semester. Aren't we on #5 of both Sec of Def, &amp; Sec of Homeland security? WOW!
RESIST! Anyways, I thought it important to thank you, &amp; introduce myself to the only person who took a chance on me today. Have a great evening, &amp; tomorrow maybe Trump will resign. Who knows? 🤞🤞
GOP that I disliked, but soon realized they're not all bad. Just cowardice &amp; corrupt, but Trump? NOPE-F'ING MORON! I don't care care about followers, just the world that my grandchildren have to care for. I'm kind. I'm NOT EVEN CLOSE to as funny as I think I am. I care, &amp; I will
teach them to be kind, compassionate, loving, &amp; treat everyone like their family. To help w/out being asked, &amp; to try each day to make someone smile. I HATE DONALD TRUMP, his family, his supporters,(I struggle w/ the irony daily)&amp; everything they say outloud! I thought it was the
Axios explicitly asked about whether Trump asked Putin about Russian bounties. Trump had no answer. In fact, part of his no-answer included a bit about us funding Afghan fighters against the Soviet Union. “We did it too, why not them?” (Paraphrase)
Cause your opinion matters for sh*t.
To  I assume you fully support this action and reason by Trump?
But we're talking about Obama and not trump. Get with the topic dude
Signatures are verified Moron... TRUMP is the WORSE FEAR MONGER President in the History of OUR Country‼️ I live in Colorado where I have Voted by Mail for 7 years‼️💁🏼‍♀️  TRUMP Opens HIS mouth &amp; LIES just POUR OUT‼️🙄  WISE UP ⬆️
Turning my vote in as early as possible and using a drop off site if possible. Trump will not cheat his way out of losing by slowing usps. The trump experiment is over and it was an even bigger failure than we expected. Time to GTFO of the people’s house.
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty - The Boston Globe.   This is a sobering read. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
I have NEVER cussed this much in my WHOLE life—TRUMP brings out the WORSE in EVERYBODY...HE needs to GO💨
Ha, she advanced herself under the Trump name. The lack of self awareness is astounding.
This comment is what most expect of a Trump supporter. Tacky, ill informed and based on no facts. It’s why we consider you “rednecks”.
HEY! HEY! This IS one of the 38 things that Trump knows more about than anyone on earth! Energy dominance, yep. It's on the list. Too bad he didn't pay more attention to grammer, reading, speech, cognitive decline symptoms, or how exactly Tin Woodman got a heart.❤
This will cost the us taxpayers billions. How the fuck is this a money saving option????  I thought trump was a business man to make stuff more efficient and cost effective!  This is neither.
I’m in northern Colorado our schools will have 50% students in class 2 days and 3 days remote learning. My daughter is 16 and understands the dangers of Covid and I’m still beside myself with fear 😭😢😔😷 I hate Trump and the GOP 😡🤬
A post Pandemic report on how the US handled it is going to be one scathing situation. It’s going to be one page long. “Trump fucked us all for political gain. “
Ya, I have close to Zero time to convince someone to follow me....I don't count followers,I don't know why anyone would, &amp; so maybe you shouldn't follow me. Although my name IS Trump is a dick! And we are dick resistors, right? I mean Trump resistors...goodbye.
Oh, you're fine! Unless you really are Russia. Things have just gotten confusing. 4 yrs ago no one knew what fake news is. Now we've got fake polls, fake news, fake investigations, demons controlling Covid, Putin controlling Trump, Trump controlling nothing (bowels included).
Yes they did President Trump.   I spent hours on the phone in the 90's trying to get Turner to put them on and they did in the late 90's. Can't watch them anymore.  God bless you and the wonderful work you are doing for our country.
It's all Political to get trump out.
Trump wants to bring a back segregation. #trumpsegregationist
Got told recently by a trumper/FORMER friend who's a retired physician: 'you have a Hard Case of Trump Derangement Syndrome'.  I looked it up.  I DO!!!!  They're never going to change, too far dug in, and nothing like a closed mind who knows they're right.
Could have been worse if Trump wasn’t the President.
Is it just ME or Does TRUMP look WORSE than Normal😳—Stress is getting to HIM‼️
That's a kind offer, politely decline.  In order to STOP trump, also gotta squelch the rhetoric, blaming left/Dems/liberals - who want to support #BLM and we certainly don't need ppl misleading by joining ranks with 45 against the peaceful protestors.   Period.  #Resist
This just sickens me to my core. Spent the last 20 years as a Realtor ® That said, this is NOT the America that good humans want.  That's Trump's version of AmeriKKKa. We can't allow this heinous move to continue. #TrumpsAmeriKKKa #AmericaOrTrump  #Invoke25 #RemoveTrumpNow
I happen to think that purging the party of culture warriors, populists, and Trump syncophants is a noble endevour. Replacing any of them with *actual conservatives* is a win. We have primaries for a reason, yes?

If you break the LAW, you pay the price.  Unless, of course, you have contacts that are in power to get you OFF.   I honestly look forward to you people in Trump's inner circle GONE. #RemoveTrumpNow
Maybe because Trump isn't very good around dogs and all. Never touches the fuzzy little bastards.
Surprising. I didn't think Trump was that interested in science.

There should be a law!  Canada has serious fines, mandatory, they're taking care of their citizens... Trump needs to be removed, immediately.
If it's US policy that Europe must build up its defense capabilities, then we need to understand that European governments will want to develop much of any new military hardware themselves, rather than buying from the US. Trump admin wants it both ways.
Trump's right that the US, too, has supplied weapons to groups fighting Russia/the Soviets. But of course, that's not the point. The real issue is that it's Trump's *job* to protect the Americans whom he has ordered into a war zone. If he's not interested in doing so: resign.
My sister says trump can pardon himself. Everyone who sees his crimes is afraid he’ll won’t be held accountable. After four years of hell he has put this County through he must be held accountable.
We've all heard it...whenever Trump opens his mouth.
Here’s another way to visualize the Trump/Republican disaster.
You know when you accuse President Obama of "spying" on your campaign, this is exactly why someone would. Did Obama? No, after running the country successfully for 8 yrs "spying" on you is the LAST thing he'd do! You're just not smart!
Trump has told so many lies how can anyone believe him.
Trump has dirtied the white house from the very beginning.
Uneducated asshats who believe weird shit and listen to Trump. That’s who these fucks are.
Ashes. trump has permanently ruined the GOP.
Did you have to tweet this because Jr. is unable to? Because his account is suspended for spreading lies?  The trump family has permanently doomed the republican party.
Trump is getting advice from Putin on despotism.
For as dumb as Trump is, he bought an AG as his fixer using the people’s money. A definite step up from Cohen.
For as dumb as Trump is, he bought an AG as his fixer using the people’s money. A definite step up from Cohen.
Don't you wonder why people on Twitter are not for Donald Trump but against. You like to tear people down.
Donald Trump is not for the people.
150,000 people are dead because of Trump.
Here’s a thought.  Forget about Trump, all the stupid politics, etc. and actually read up on it.  Study it for yourself.
THE ANCHORS (maybe they'll try to play underwater, as soon as Trump tells them hydroxychloroquine can bring them back to life)
#IwantMyMoneyBack I'll join any class action lawsuit against the trump family, administration, businesses, foundations, ANYTHING he has, he owes to Americans.  And that's not ever going to be enough, 151 THOUSAND dead.  I want them locked up.
Fauci for president.  Trump for prison.  Barr for the last circle of hell.
You seem surprised....I thought the extremely pathetic attempt outside the Whitehouse holding a Bible made it clear that Trump reality begins &amp; ends behind the camera, NOT "protecting Americans, or Federal buildings" its nothing but a commercial to him.
#BidenRice2020 I'll be over the top with Susan Rice as VP, get diplomacy is necessary to heal the chaos left in trump's wake.  All the candidates are fantastic, and needed in the Biden administration, but.. I'm Team Rice!
Are you telling us that the free seeds I got in the mail from China ARE NOT the  stimulus bill round 2? I would've sworn that was their plan. I was waiting for someone to take credit for it, &amp; Trump giving them a medal for it.
I have a list of at least 38 complicated topics that Trump claims he knows more about than anyone on earth. Someone told me today that its confidence. I told her her that's not confidence but obvious mental illness! Who knows? Maybe the law isn't one of the 38 things. No, it is!
I’m always proud to have you represent me but even more so today as you sought justice with one of the most unjust, lying, trump serving snake posing as AG. 👍☮️
So Bill Barr spent the day regurgitating horseshit and covering Trump's ass. Has anything changed?
It’s also about getting trump the hell out of office. Pleaaasseeee
What if #trump doesn’t want to stop the virus? How many Americans will he be able to flick off his #Medicare and #Medicaid payroll when they die?  It’s only the elderly and compromised that are dying. He’s trying to save the #economy. 🤷🏻‍♀️ isn’t that what makes America great? 🤦🏼‍♀️
When you say "quack journalists" are you referring to those who HAVE a degree from a physical college in Journalism? Or is this a Trump University degree? Or  who is NOT/NOR HAS EVER BEEN a journalist AT ALL, EVER! QUOTES FOLLOW.
So you're telling me that I need to go dig up each &amp; every seed that I recieved in the mail somewhat suspicious manner? I thought this was the GOP Covid stimulus part two. I thought the note said "grow your own food dumbass." was a little blunt but its Trump,so.
Trump Asks at Covid Briefing Why Fauci Has a High Approval Rating But He Doesn’t ~Josh Feldman  We hold that truth to be self evident.
What about this trump
Have you considered the approach of just publicly announcing you're going to throw out the first pitch and waiting for atRockies to stop you?
Why doesn't anybody like Trump? We hold that truth to be self-evident.
Why doesn't anybody like Trump? We hold that truth to be self-evident.
More than Trump? Doubt it.
And Trump has even admitted (obliquely) that he doesn't read.
I hear that trump may fire Fauci... lord help us all.
ppl have DIED using this drug.  It's NOT effective - and you're dead fucking wrong on this....like trump - the child rapist. Likely the person creating this meme - is NOT using science - just inciting the idiots.
Sadly, I thought Trump was the anomaly. But what about his enablers? AG Barr’s testimony proves Trump isn’t the only individual his administrations personalizing anomaly. #Trumphasaholeinhissoul
Used this before but it is the truth.  He is the consigliare (advisor) for the Trump syndicate (company). 🤫
Trump is definitely getting his money's worth out of Bill Barr.
Looking for Anti trump followers!  Can I get to the next big goal?  I'll FB!!! #RemoveTrumpNow #TrumpVirus #Tre45on #TrumpKillsAmerica
I even got DM on this. I don't get it. I don't want DMs. I'm not here to sell anything, buy anything...I want to educate on voting and getting trump imprisoned!
How is there a human alive that thinks trump is a good leader? He's plundering, stealing from the money WE pay our entire lives.  And, rapes little girls.  I don't get it.
i refuse to date fish boys, hunting boys, frat boys, trump boys, and alcoholic boys. now do you understand why i am permanently single :)
Full Media coverage for their ranting agenda against Trump and GOP.
To those guys out there who think the reason they can't get laid is just because they're a trump fan, let me say this as gently as I can...
James reading Trump’s tweets.
Well... Okay.  Having a trump sycophant like you endorse this person truly makes her NOT attractive.
Well,  world 🌎, welcome to the new 2020 America brought to you by the USA 🇺🇸 President Donald J Trump, where violence and brutality to peaceful protesters is the order of the day! This is a new war zone redefined by this president.
On a lighter note!  Hoping to get more followers, so I can get out from under the limitations and avoid more 3 day spankings!  I'm in awe of you all, the fight to save America from the trump virus continues!! #TrumpIsATraitor
Has he ever said this about Trump?
Trump's 'Murica... you helped create the beast by doing nothing just like at OSU.
I find this story to be a horrific example of punishing someone for personal feelings, &amp; everyone has the same right to express themselves. He being a scientist on TV doesn't matter! It's astonishing how this country has been destroyed by Trump in 3½yrs!
ME INSANE⁉️😂  WE have ALL seen the videos of POLICE loading BRICKS 🧱 into Their Vehicles&amp;POLICE Slashing Tires in a Parking Lot&amp;BLAMING it on the PROTESTORS&amp;TRUMP gassing PEACEFUL PROTESTORS in DC 2take a  CAMPAIGN PICTURE‼️  THIS PRESIDENT would do ANYTHING to get Re-ELECTED
Yet Trump retweet practically the same thing and nothing happens
And at the end of the day, trump will look foolish as always.
Lets see trump on Colbert!
But the poll also found much fewer trump supporters
Sorry GOP, trump has cost you the Senior vote. You are done.
Funny how real scientists and medical doctors disagree with you and Dr. Uncle trump.  Stop spreading lies azzhole.
GIVE ME a BREAK...  TRUMP PAID People at RALLIES... TRUMP is PAYING People to START Violence at PROTEST in Portland &amp; Seattle to JUSTIFY HIS Military Deployment‼️  HE LIES, HE CHEATS &amp; HE CAN’T BE TRUSTED‼️😤  TRUMP wants CHAOS &amp; UNREST   It’s ALL about MONEY &amp; POWER
There has NEVER, EVER been another human being on earth that has done more to mislead this country than Donald Trump! Dr Fauci is a patriot, extremely qualified &amp; educated. Trump dislikes him b/c he won't support Trumps lies!
The problem w/ being a Trump supporter, well one of the problems is that you actually believe he has more support &amp; voters than is fact. ALL of them could show up &amp; there's still no chance in hell he wins!
Of course you do. Russia has been Trump fan from the beginning, but not b/c you like Trump, but b/c America has never had a more unqualified &amp; monumentally stupid "president"!
When you say "current events" do you mean like the "presidential daily briefings? Or more like your dad not having a computer at his desk in Trump Tower? That's probably considered "current" since EVERYONE has a computer! I bet he'll wait for your book to come out on tape.
It would be shocking if we had any other President than Trump. I think it pales in comparison to Trump &amp; GOP corruption! 2 words. Russian bounties! Zero retaliation, Ø sanctions, Øcondemnation, not so much as a stern phone call! That's NOT normal!
I used to get so pissed in Twitter jail. I called Trump a whiney little bitch &amp; was blocked for 7 days. Then I started added this to everyone of my tweets &amp; haven't been back. Add this to the end of your tweets.  (in my opinion) Even  protects freedom of speech!
Take the country back from who or what? Trump is currently president.
You’re right, but #Trump2020 isn’t the answer. Trump is gassing unarmed women in total disregard to the Bill of Rights. He is a traitor to the United States. Please invest your time in anything else.
It isn’t true. So it isn’t a matter of thinking “it,” (an existential truth) is good or bad. Trump does poorly on Twitter because everyone on Twitter hates him. That’s the trend.
Lol, okay. You have a profile pic of Trump right next to the title "Dictator in Chief". That'll will be the first thing people think when they see your account. Doesn't help that he's a fascist, though so that's not all on you.
Donald Trump is a little bitch boy #ThePresidentIsACrybaby
You got it right in the 1st sentence, it doesn't matter. A bland, barely pro-forma TWEET does not sincere condolences make.  Trump is incapable of offering a full hearted tribute of respect or regard to any man so much more revered &amp; honored than he shall ever be.
Anyone decent, and who cares for Congressman Lewis' legacy, wouldn't want Trump there to besmirch the solemnity of the memorial.  Now, if only McConnell &amp; his ilk had the decency to do the same.
Not so sure about  He’s down with anti-democratic, anti-American authoritarian strongmen like Duterte and he likes being Trump’s boy. It’s the only way he knows.
I hope people remember this when Trump bows down to Putin when he kills my fellow soldiers!
Maybe he should work a little harder to make the trending trump hashtags positive instead of whining about it. Like do something that’s actually positive for the country or the world and maybe a good trump hastag would trend. Nah..just whine he will.
Trump sucks
I think these 'seeds' from allegedly, China bring sent through the mail?  I think that's a straight up black ops 'psy-ops'.  Physiological warfare to dissuade ppl that it's vulnerable - but, it's the trump goons.  Am I crazy?
I agree Trump has caused a lot of problems for the USA
WARNING: Clear your palate of all food and drink before watching this music video of Trump.
if Trump Campaign had asked to use  likeness, is there be process for 501c3 to allow? Previous tweet said it cannot be used for political campaigns. If so, how many other politicians have been called out for doing the same thing over last decades?
I'M VOTING TWICE. Oops, said that out loud.  Just kidding for godsakes. That better not turn up in one of Trump's tweets.

I will guarantee that if a vaccine is developed that stops the virus, but kills 1 in 10 people for other reasons, trump would attempt to order it's release. Because idiot.

Good  does not deserve to be around an icon like John Lewis. Trump is once again telling us who he is, will we listen?
TRUMP = RUSSIANS PUPPET 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
I think the critique here is of the press. And... largely deserved. It's basically the same argument made by Taibbi and Sullivan. The MSM is so overtly spinning for anything remotely anti-Trump that they've forgotten their primary job is to disseminate TRUTH.
Wouldn't have believed Trump anyway.
Wouldn't have believed Trump anyway.
it's the boogaloos and trump thugs doing the damage, NOT the non-violent protestors.  Those are Moms, teens, young adults, vets and medics out there - being attacked by our government.  Illegally.  Get involved - if you supported Obama - you should really be involved!
I just published The Metric is Here   The metric is here, in quotes, is a Trump response to questions about how American success in dealing with Covid will be measured. Oy.
Hope someday soon all these Trump jokes will seem irrelevant and stale. Like seeing a Bill Clinton blowjob joke on an old Whose Line.
Imagine believing Trump is going after human traffickers. Imagine thinking God and Trump have anything to do with each other. Imagine thinking that Q is remotely real.   Account reported. QAnon are a domestic terrorist group.
Seems like all trump’s mob are idiots.
People are criticising Trump for this. However, he sullies everything he interacts with. #ETTD. I'm happy he's not bringing his racist freakshow energy to memorials of John Lewis.
TRUMP has NO idea WHAT HE TWEETING or TALKING about AT ALL‼️🙄 Jesus Christ‼️   CDC should be Updating Public EVERYDAY‼️  FAUCI WE NEED YOU...Where do WE find YOU⁉️💁🏼‍♀️
YES HE DID...BUT TRUMP is suppose (I say that loosely) President of ENTIRE Country &amp; LEWIS is a NATIONAL HERO &amp; TREASURE‼️😤  It’s the PRINCIPAL of it‼️🤬
Agreed! Let Trump twist in the wind.
#Resist Thanks in advance for all followers, trump to stay out of jail for following too many, but.. Catching up in increments!  Hopefully, I'll get to that elusive 5k... For now, I just be want to #FightTrumpFasism #VoteForOurLives
Nice Photoshop. Does it make it better if I say, "Fuck Bill Clinton!" too? There, I said it. Now, how about you take Trump off that pedestal? I'm not holding my breath for you do so, hypocrite. Some of us support pedos. Others do not, myself included.
Trump sure goes to a lot of trouble for viral footage. Couldn't somebody on his staff tell him about CGI for goddsakes?
Millions of people unemployed with very little to do so they're watching. They might not like everything Trump is doing but they hate what the libtards are doing more.
I know you're a skeptic Cern but Trump is gonna win bigly. Electoral and popular vote. This is a statement election.
I agree! Trump will try to upstage the Democratic Convention with Nikki Haley, Hope Hicks or Ivanka as his VP. Pence will resign.
Seems to me, Trump might be losing control of the narrative here.
Holy SHITT😳... just reported that WHITE HOUSE has announced that  WOULD NOT be paying HIS respect to  as HIS body lies in state at the Capitol‼️😤  TRUMP constantly doubles down on HIS STUPIDITY &amp; LACK of True LEADERSHIP‼️  ASSHOLE FOREVER‼️
I’d say this sums up the Trump presidency perfectly... A windy sh*t show of disappointment 🤣😂😷

If Trump calls you overrated, you're in damn good company.
If Trump calls you overrated, you're in damn good company.
I’m asking too?  Trump is a sexist dick!
Again, don't get complacent. If Trump can just fix the economy and bring those dead people back to life he'll sew up the evangelical vote. Stay vigilante.
Please read this. Dr. Zheng-Li Shi should be celebrated for her phenomenal contributions to virology and helping us better understand our world, but instead she's losing sleep over false accusations and having to explain herself. She shouldn't have to.
Nice. Although "Trump was Pissed" is starting to sound like the daily weather report in San Diego. Or something.
It took trump to turn Texas blue. Flush the turd November 3rd.
Facebook has far too much power — and uses it to let Donald Trump run lying ads so they can profit. It's time for federal regulators to investigate #Facebook and act.

Let's see trump on Colbert.
Except for the fact that trump deserves another attack.
Trump is bad news
The BLM moveent is not killing a lot of people &amp; it's getting legislative changes done.  There have been some people killed, some injured &amp; maimed, most of those are protestors willing to risk their own safety to change society for the better.  Meanwhile, Trump plays golf.
My grandfather fought fascists in WWII. As I recall, fascists were killing Jews. But yet, now you support Donald Trump and his authoritarian far right fascist regime. Maybe Jews are on the cleared list THIS TIME right? Maybe this time, it will be someone else.
Wrong nice try twitter zombie. Trump 2020
Not poplar opposites. Different situations, both wrong. Trump is president, this is the wrong that needs righting.
I'm an independent. So I can say, American leaders should not abandon their personnel. Hillary should not have done it. Hillary isn't president. Trump is.  Ok, now you can reply.
And Trump is controlled by Moscow.
TRUMP = RUSSIANS PUPPET 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
trump will approve a complete and total shutdown November 1.
Only trump has to think about impeachment.
But better grammar than trump.
No need. I'm Dem &amp; if this is authentic its deplorable.  There are some (not many, but some) not nice, not cool, not worthy Dems. Joe is one of the good guys &amp; I'm pretty confident you already know that.  Disagree with policies, but don't be like Trump &amp; attack the man (or wife)
Not sure who this player is, but his look tells us all we need to know how he feels about trump.
Jim  is right...the only ones left in Trump's camp at this point are Koolaid drinkers and next of kin.
Setting records every day that trump is!
I rarely feel such an aggressive urge to tweet something but I’ve had a few drinks: The American Anime™️ will only end when Hayley Williams beats Trump in a final battle of good vs. evil, orange skin vs. orange hair.
Sorry, I will be libeling trump long after he's dead. But it won't be libel.
A couple of crooks, talking about trump the other crook.
Can I just say, if Trump decides not to accept the election results in November...tough shit.
Know that thing about we only use 10% of our brains? Well I figure I probably use 85% of THAT trying to figure out funny ways to call Donald Trump an asshole. So that's probably why I forgot to get bread just now. I hope.
Fantastic job on focusing on ending the trumpvirus, number 2 on the list, should be number 1, but since trump is a single issue idiot, there is no surprise the GOP is doomed in November.  Thank you GOP! Giving us trump has sealed your fate.
We need to start educating the MANY who don't know Biden.  I've seen two people I personally know post that he's in the basement.... Which is ludicrous, but, we must get people aware of who Biden IS!  Rather than trump and all his bluster!
Hey Brit, why do I have a feeling your legacy will be similar to Trump's🤔
America will have Post Traumatic Trump Syndrome. #PTTSS  I can't imagine facing this virus with my children (now adult). Can America survive another 6 months with him in power?  He's GOT to be removed.
Perhaps you should go back to Cuba and live with the dictator of your choice. You can even take your favorite dictator, Trump, there. 👍
#OneTermCory has nothing to do with Colorado’s future. He is a failed conservative who is a disgrace to the great state of Colorado. BTW what about the Putin/Trump/GOP bounties on our service members? Support the troops huh? Typically Republican liar.
Trump news: President ignores multiple crises to brag about golf game as White House officials admit coronavirus testing failures ~ article  It all seems...unseemly, it seems to me.
Wonder what Scott and Marlowe think about his politics. They both love buttering Trump’s buttcheeks.

It’s Trump Virus.
The only way we can get Trump to stop using #Facebook ads to mainstream his lies is for federal oversight bodies to investigate — and take appropriate action.
Trump sent ventilators to Russia. Wonder if he's making plans to send Putin some of the thugs he's deployed in Portland and other cities.
Trump Killed thousands
It is your democrat mayors and governors who are making the mask demands, not President Trump and not his supporters.  I would never ask anyone to wear a mask and I didn't until our lib governor and city council mandated it.  So get the facts before you blame everything on Trump.
TRUMP = RUSSIA'S PUPPET 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Not surprised.  Trump supporters are afraid of their own shadow. Boo!
Democrats win the White House, Senate and gain seats in the House. The Republican Party is done, and you have trump to thank for it.
Trump played the elites' game, and realized he didn't want anything to do with it. We picked the perfect President. Someone who dipped their toes in the twisted parties, but who still maintained his conscience and is now working to rid the world of that vileness.
TRUMP 2020
Voting for Trump is voting for dictatorship. Those are just the facts.
My former best friend is now a Trumpie...we can't even have a conversation anymore. An intelligent guy, too. It's that willful ignorance that I don't understand. But Trump has split this country down the middle.
Nothing  and I say this in the nicest way possible, nothing, not even a home invasion by unidentifiable armed militiamen while you're on the toilet finally taking your 1st dump in 5 days, could possibly be a worse disaster than your dear leader tRump.  Nothing, I mean. Nothing.
At the moment, the real people in America prefer Biden to Trump. Can’t dispute that.
I had a joke about Obama, but Trump took credit for it.
TRUMP = RUSSIA'S FAVORITE ASSET 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
But we know Trump is a disaster, so where is the risk? There is none.
We only listen to the advice of Dr. Uncle trump and never wear masks. Thank you for the Democrat sweep of the White House and Senate in November!
Too bad trump is such a non-leader.
We are hoping that The  Yankees and Red Sox kneel August 15th when trump throws out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium.
This is the kind of thing that just BOILS MY BLOOD 🩸😤...THIS is TRUMPS leadership—UNJUSTIFIED &amp; HARMFUL for VOTES from fucking CRAZY PEOPLE that are capable of HARM (pizzagate🙄)...TRUMP is CRIMINAL‼️😡
I LAUGH from the time HE shows HIS face to Commercial Break—THE SCRIPT HE has memorized is OLD &amp; COMICAL...TRUMP “YES” MAN &amp; ONE of the FEW left still WILLING to embarrass HIMSELF on National TV‼️😂
Chances are tRump will throw a tantrum instead of a pitch at Yankees game. Especially if they all kneel.
About the only thing Donald Trump and Jesus have in common is they both got their job through their old man.
I wouldn’t say Kavanaugh was a good pick. And there’s a difference between tolerating Trump and thinking he’s the second coming of Christ. Those people are exhausting.
Idk which statement is more asinine. “Trump is the greatest threat to our nation!” Or “Trump is the best president we’ve ever had!” . All of you are fucking idiots.
Bro, how could you blame ANYONE for trying to get away from an owner who has one foot in Trump’s cabinet as an ambassador, and this guy as the head coach? You should ask  if you can get away with him in his suitcase for free.
How many more ads will #Facebook let Donald Trump run that are filled with false and vote-suppressing content? We can't wait to find out. Federal oversight bodies need to investigate — and act.
Is the United States the 7th bankruptcy trump has presided over or the 8th? Can't keep it straight.
trump, send some paper to wells!
“We’re building a wall on the border of New Mexico, and we’re building a wall in Colorado,” he said. “We’re building a beautiful wall, a big one that really works, that you can’t get over, you can’t get under....”  Donald Trump Wednesday October 23, 2019.
I just read where the NYT had put out false information on treatments. Most expert doctors that haven’t been paid for by the Trump haters praise the treatments that the NYT says are dangerous.
They are trying, trump and Moscow Mitch are standing in the way, until November. Bye Republican party!
I'm anti trump in EVERY way.  trump wanting another four years of golfing on taxpayer's backs.  That's just insignificant compared to his entire life, and the murders of 150K Americans.
How long until they blame trump for this?
That's strange. Calling someone a "F*cking B*tch" makes you resign from a christian organization? But all christian organizations support Adulterer trump? Doesn't make sense!
Right. They are marching all over trump, just like Putin. trump has single handedly doomed the entire republican party.
Running?Boy please!You rather I stay oppressed? GTFOH. I’m living great out here. I’m not arguing with white people. Look at me now ... arguing with a white person from NC about racist ass people.Naw you can have your rebel flag, trump loving, cousin fucking ass red necks ✊🏾
RE:   "I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN."
Bush is the one who really kicked the spending into high gear. Trump and Obama just kept the train going.
Dissed from the great beyond. Like Woody Guthrie calling out Trump's old man. Or something.
If they vote for ANYONE not Biden, it's a vote for trump
The difference will be after Trump wins in November he won't have to worry about an upcoming election and can send in all the federal LEO'S and military to shut the bullshit down in a hurry. We have to win the house back and keep the senate so they can be productive! #Trump2020
It was trump.
Can he and Trump be jailed in a boarder cage? Throw Giuliani in and they'll all be insane within a week.
trump, Cory, Republican Party. All doomed in November.
It was likely trump who blew him away.
Good for President Trump golfing with Brett Favre.   Best POTUS ever.
If you ask me, it really started going to hell the day that Trump stared at the eclipse. Happened to a friend of mine too, but I think he was doing acid.
I read a suggestion trump is setting up his legal issues, by asserting dementia, so he might get excused?????  I mean....I never thought any of THIS would happen....thoughts?
Every player, staff, human - boycott anything and everything TRUMP does.  He's belittled all of the human race, and just wants your adulation.  Turn your backs on him, please. #BoycottTRUMP  Willing to try anything at this point.  #RemoveTrumpNow #tre45on
I won't support ANY business or any human that would have trump appear. How does the opposing team feel about having to stand on a field with this pedophile traitor rapist racist liar thief tax evader sexual predator? #boycottTRUMP Don't follow him on social media, STOP TRUMP NOW
Now do Trump.
I've seen quite a few Biden supporters living in Trump areas &amp; they are nervous about showing their Biden support so that may just go both ways.  People in Trump families/households, neighborhoods, workplaces keeping quiet about voting for Biden.
The thumbs up has a negative meaning to it in other cultures.I wonder if that’s wat trump is trying to tells us. He over uses it.
Trump is a clown. Keep color out of it. It should be the best person for the job regardless of what they look like.
I'd say he was wagging the dog except I don't think Trump's ever touched a dog in his whole life.
I'd say he was wagging the dog except I don't think Trump's ever touched a dog in his whole life.
Many music artists still have intellectual property rights over their music. Once again if the trump campaign actually made any attempt to ask or pay they wouldn’t be getting cease and desists right now. This isn’t difficult
“My goal,” the soldier said, “is NOT to die for MY country - it’s to get the OTHER guy to die for HIS.”  Who are WE to stand in the way of some ill-informed #Trump supporters who’d rather DIE for a maniac than LIVE a long life?  Life’s full of choices - some people make bad ones.
Thanks to Trump's direct doing (policies and opportunities), I finally moved up in Class and it's only taken ~3+ years to do so. To others that don't agree with this, stop complaining about it, go out and do something, work hard, and you too will see the results.
Children will be children. Gotta blame someone for their failures. I have done very well with Trump's economy and continue to do so. Then again, I've worked hard for forty years. President Trump gave me the opportunity to come back after sixteen years of a failed economy.What? All of a sudden Herman Cain is righteous?  He is/was just a littke brughter tgan Trump
He has to be stopped. Mail in ballots are now drop off ballots. Vote early.  Trump is destroying ⁦ Another American icon being taken down to help his election
we must hold Trump responsible for suggesting the vote be delayed. Impeachable offense... Congress please do your job! #impeachthelawbreakingdictatorwannabe
Don’t forget Corey Gardner who said he would stand up to Trump and has voted with him 95% or higher.    Voting him out this November
Not to mention the lies. Local Dem leadership closed polling places, nor Republicans and it's impossible for it to have been Trump.  Ignorance and Fake News at best
For the Dems, It’s all come down to we don’t care about who is President, we just don’t want Trump. I know some conservatives that don’t want Trump to win only because how bad things might be if he was re-elected. Now that’s Democracy!!
Jason, millions of folks believe Trump is the worse President in history and a lying criminal. When asked about Biden’s qualifications to be President, you replied “better than Trump”. That’s quite the endorsement!  Biden’s better than a criminal.
Hard to disagree. I felt the same way during the first impeachment. It’s a sad day when I’d take Pence as president. But after Trump has tried to sabotage the election, he’s infringing on our constitution. We need to uphold our democracy no matter the cost.
Trump is so desperate he tries blaming mail in ballots, trying to change the election date, anything to avoid the obvious. He is a goner.
Is it ironic that Cain died of the virus after attending Trump's need to do a rally in Tulsa?
Trump Recovers Taxpayer Cash On A $1 Billion Obama-Backed Solar Plant That Was Obsolete Before Ever Going Online - The Daily Caller
Trump killed him...now he is saying the china virus killed him!
Trump’s friend Cain didn’t wear a mask. He’s dead.
It always takes at least two to three weeks for states to certify their election results. What you see is trump blowing out his ass as usual.
Actually he lost his black friend due to trump’s insistence on a mask fee rally. So in effect, trump murdered him.
And trump doesn’t? Ever listen to him? Can’t put three words together in a coherent sentence.
Classic trump taking advice from Putin.. as the infamous Rev Sharpton would say “nice try but we gotcha”
You say people are lazy but create a system where they make more to stay home? But don’t understand why people say raise minimum wage. No your bill was dumb. Then the deadline is here and y’all haven’t late talks. Trump blames Pelosi and Pelosi trump. These are the best minds???
Obama is a slimy liar and the agent provocateur in the ongoing attempt at a coup d’etat to unseat President Trump before the November Presidential Election.
HOORAY Tulsa.....NO MASKS required. Murder is on Trump!
Trump is on msnbc now talking about delaying elections. Why do they even give him an audience? Who’s worse Teump or news station that let trump dpiel his shit for an hour or two a day
The Marxist puppet Biden will never debate President Trump.
Okay it's no longer a press conference ...it's turned into a trump rally. I'm done
That’s why we need trump to stop trying to ban mail in voting
Refused to wear a mask, went to trump’s Tulsa rally without one &amp; got COVID!
😆😂🤣  i thought lindsey graham knew Trump better!!!
Green groups challenge Trump rollback of bedrock environmental law  #NEPA
Moms don’t advice from a woman who knowingly associates with  the Trump disgusting family. Moms protect their kids. You and the Trump are a danger to kids everywhere.
🙋‍♀️ is a coward. He knows  is corrupt, he know that this criminal cannot change the election date. He took his WestPoint and Harvard oaths and gave them his middle finger.  He chose Trump over America #AmericaOrTrump #NovemberIsComing
Commence Trump media distraction. People fall for it every time lol "oh no Trump is a fascist", meanwhile the real negative news goes less noticed.
Sounds like Trump is going to have a news conference. I'm hoping this is where he tells America he's resigning🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞
That lie got old. Especially coming from a trump spawn.
No way tRump. We will vote you out.
is a coward;  he knows the answer and has chosen Trump over America, because unfortunately he has forgotten what he learned at West Point and at Harvard.  #TrumpOrAmerica
you are a coward,  you know the answer and you are a coward.  You side with a criminal. Here’s one last question, which is it, America or Trump?  #AmericaOrTrump #WeWillVote #WeWillVoteByMail
No way I would work for Trump. That sounds miserable.
If they want to win, the GOP incumbents and candidates will soon jump off the Trump train-wreck!
As a Democrat, I have to ask you, what are we going to do when Trump and his followers cancel the election; thus, again kicking sand in our face? We hear our leaders talk tough, but 😑 meh.. Flynn is free, Stone is free, storm troopers continue to abuse us.
I notice that it’s been very quiet about Herman Cain. Didn’t he go to Tulsa for the Trump rally and then got sick less than 2 weeks later? And oh yeah, he does today from same said hoax of a virus today
Still showing how hypocritical they are!  Look at the amount of People they have so close together in one room. Yet, they chastise President Trump’s groups plus tell us we can’t even HAVE funerals!
To help Christ fight the One World Order is why they say we need "More Jesus" instead of more government accountability.  This is why the say "everybody in power is corrupt" when you point out Trump's many failures.
Why has the Christian Right stopped valuing family values? Like, why do we they still plan to vote for Trump &amp; the anti-science stooges who support him? One word answer: RELIGION  They ascribe to a theology called One World Order or New World Order.
'Trump Does Not Have Authority To Move Election Date': Griswold
Amen  Obama was most corrupt President in US History. Having orchestrated the attempted coup d’etat to unseat President Trump, he ranks up there with Emperor Caligula in Ancient Rome as being one of the most diabolical of all world leaders.
This deranged old woman, who is Speaker of the US House of Representatives, is a national embarrassment. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Clear the decks of all the Marxist Democrats in Congress.
That’s because there is none. Just more of trump’s lies.
News Release. Trump does NOT have the power!!!!   Yes, this👇👇👀👇👇
My sis posted on FB the day after “some of the best people I know voted for Trump/Clinton and if you are angry at people voting differently you are the problem” told her it was emotionally manipulative. Somehow I ended up apologizing and our relationship has never been the same.
🔴 LIVE: President Trump Roundtable on Donating Plasma at the Red Cross  via
Same. Could you imagine if the virus was way more deadly but trump kept hosting rallies anyway? Imagine trump being briefed like "sir, the new consensus based on polls is that you will lose the election because most of your supporters are dead"
I bet Clinton, Bush, and Obama are all smoking some blunts together remembering John Lewis and Trump is mad because he wasn’t invited 😂
I am very sad I did not support obama during his presidency. I was in the midst of opening my eyes. I combated fake emails, but voted 3rd party last time. I don’t understand trump worship. I’m enjoying learning from &amp; listening to the Obamas now.
Because Trump supporters aren’t worth my time.  Or anyone’s time.  You all are lost.
Trump and Republicans should memorialize Cain the same way they would treat any Republican who takes Coronavirus seriously by calling him a RINO who hates freedom and sides with the "Enemies of The Homeland" like antifa and Democrats and journalists and mask-wearers.
I wonder what would happen if Putin is deposed before Trump is defeated? Where would he flee to then? North Korea?
He got COVID-19 after attending trump’s Tulsa rally without a mask!
trump likes republicans who don’t die from CORONA virus.
The hope is that maybe seeing him openly mock science will be a teachable moment. Even if only .000001% of the MAGA crowd start to come back to something resembling fact based reality over this that would help. Anything is better than nothing. 3/3
FINALLY the GOP leadership has pushed back on Trump’s unconstitutional blathering. #WeWillVote

IED’s are weapons of war- if these jackasses want war -Trump should give it to them- call in the Marines🇺🇸
Trump will pardon him prior to the election, just sad that this continues
What Trump has learned:  Put out any statement - fact or pure fiction - and if enough people choose to believe it OR choose to publicize it, it will become "news", or fact......  It will further distract or divert attention from actual news events.
Maybe so, but fascist pig trump, barr,  continue to stomp on the Constitution (that includes Conway who has repeatedly violated The Hatch Act &amp; ignored subpoenas to answer to those violations).
replace "dear god" with "UNFAIR!!!!" or "WHAT IS HAPPENING?" and this reads exactly like a trump tweet
And got it at Trump rally. You can't make this stuff up....  Herman Cain, a former GOP presidential candidate and Trump campaign surrogate, has died after being hospitalized with COVID-19.  via
Of Trump's ~82 million twitter followers, how many are journalists? Let's be wildly generous and say 2 million. What about the other 82 million people who read his tweets and are affected by them? It's totally ok that he freaks EVERYONE else out?
Yeah they are   They're begging Trump suddenly DROPS OUT of the race   But we KNOW THAT ain't gonna happen   Which means CLEAR SAILING for  🤣😂
So the people that Trump appointed get to decide if Trump's actions are legal? Great. Just great.
After the election. Take down the Republicans from tRUmp clear down to dog catcher
Team Trump .... If Biden knew how to fix America, why didn't he tell Obama?🤷‍♀️
You need to leave the Democratic Party &amp; become a Republican! You  support trump &amp; don’t stand for any Democratic issues. You’re a DINO - Democrat In Name Only!

Herman Cain was a trump supporter and attended his Rally in Tulsa  I'm not morally bankrupt or depraved I think its sick that a man died so trump can boost his ego #TrumpKilledHermanCain
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail  read the constitution you moron. Not in your wheelhouse. And the GOP senate best not get stupid with their enabling.
Pretty sure one of Trump’s first reactions was “Did Cain sign the waiver?”
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail  many states have done mail in voting for years. Never a problem. Bad mgt. of voting are in  Florida and Georgia and Mississippi.
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail  America can not wait any longer to oust this corrupt and inept piece of work occupying the white house. And his enablers in crime.

Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail  not in his power. he can go to hell.
Yeah I know, it's weird how they test positive and really don't end up sick, but that will happen, hopefully to Pastor Pence or Trump, or McConnell or any other Republican
So Trump forced Cain to go to a rally and not wear a mask? PS, masks don’t work.
I fear that Trump will try, unsuccessfully, to dissolve the Constitution claiming it to be "fake news", &amp; will attempt to consolidate his authority.  If that happens, all bets are off as far as I'm concerned.
In Trump’s mind the only valid vote is a vote for him.
Whatever Trump tweets today, it's a distraction from this. #TrumpRecession
Trump wants to delay the election but still send kids back to school 🤨 I hate it here
donald trump won’t delay this years either.
It doesn’t make any sense to me. It blows my mind how people can insist  Trump isn’t racist when he continues to use such degrading terms.
Trump shames Fox News: They forgot who got them where they are
Trump raped a 13 year old.  He wants to date his daughter
Because the royal Trump, said so.
Shameful, atrocious and unethical will be adjectives forever used to describe the Trump presidency!
So non-white families are not part of the American dream in the delusional and dangerous land of Trump? Who gives him the right to pick where people live and who becomes our neighbors and friends. Shettles went out a long time ago. Stop dividing and sowing fear and division.
Trump was always going to suggest delaying the election. He'll "backtrack" a bit on it, say it was a joke or only wondering aloud, then he'll decide his next move based on the amount of pushback he gets.
.   So Biden was crazy to suggest Trump would seek to delay the election hey...  You must be a real high character individual to stand idly by and allow this to occur
The tweet had typical Trump troll quality - tee up issue to cause attention then accuse the “left” of being triggered and also not caring about election security. He also uses his “out card” of question marks to later say he was just posing a question. He’s outrageous on purpose.
This is a perfect example of Donald Trump brings out the worst in people he behaves like a child people see it and they parrot his behavior. #VoteHimOut
The Democrats in Congress are a disgrace. They’re in the process of attempting to destroy America’s constitutional democracy. Vote Trump and Republican in November.
You're welcome to comment on the crux of this tweet Scott.  Trump has now openly sought to make delaying the election a talking point.  Isn't this how democracy died somewhere in Europe in the late 1930's?
Says who.....the “trump tribune”?  Two things you will only ever be #ImpeachedForLife #AmericasGreatestMistake
In Trump’s daily updates back in March when he backed it, the discussion as on the cocktail.
This is serious .... Trump needs to be thrown out of office along with his dregs
Trump floats delaying election.
We need to make tee-shirts with a big orange/burn sienna blob on the front and text that says: “I ran into Donald Trump and he smudged my shirt!”
Trump 2020!
Donald Trump Gave Jessie Jackson Free Hotel Space To Help Low Income Blacks  via
It’s not real someone mixed in audio of  with this video.   However, Trump still stands and moves like an inebriated Sasquatch!
What do you think post-trumpism will look like? Seriously. Like postpartum depression, Trump supporters have been embolden to be their worst selves because that was made to be ok. But after Trump leaves, there will be side effects. Thoughts?
Trump would use this as ammunition for his whole Deep Fakes excuses... maybe better to just delete this crap!
Oh yeah it’s  I remember he did a comedy video impersonation exactly like this. Someone toon the audio from his video and used some digital effects to make it sound live and mixed it, this is fake please don’t retweet! Don’t let Trump claim Fake News!!!
It sounds a lot like that guy who does a great impersonation of Trump and is hilarious. I can’t remember his name at the moment but, even though I can’t stand Trump, I don’t think is real. Also, that funny guy didn’t make this either, it’s one of his existing impersonations.
Trump didn’t start this and it won’t end when he’s out of office. He just mobilized it to his advantage. In fact it could get worse as the people who adore him feel threatened especially with a diverse cabinet under a Dem president. We’ve got a lot of work to do as a country.
You are so amazing! You are the only Trump I’d like to see in office. The book is excellent.
Don’t you watch the news.  Even Swalwell who used to say that it was a conspiracy to say that Obama spied on Trump has now moved to the line that it was right to spy on Trump.   Come on, I can’t discuss things with you if you don’t even know current developments
Hey Kevin, arguing with someone that peddles in conspiracies like Carole is pointless. You can use facts and data all day long and it wouldn't matter. It's just a worldwide conspiracy because people don't like Trump 🤣 just happy I don't live in Texas.
Funny you use Nixon as an example.   He got caught spying on his political adversaries as well.   What Obama and company have done makes that look like child’s play.   Also, it is not a fact that Trump sold us out to Russia.  It’s an assumption, mostly to cover their arses.
The "model" you quoted came out months after the pandemic started from the WH. It was a guesstimate on how many COULD have died. What national plan was implemented to curb the numbers? Do you recall Trump said it's up to the individual states? I'm sorry, but you sound foolish.
Don, with respect for the great work you're doing, this is not a useful approach. Trump wants to kill USPS as we know. But more funding now is not the answer. His hand-picked USPS leader is openly &amp; intentionally ordering employees to slow service. He must be removed immediately!
Damn that's a lot of ignorant racist trash. Americants shouldn't be allowed in this country all supports of hypocrisy &amp; true distruction of America should be in jail or loaded on a ship &amp; sent into orbit. There is no gray area if you support Trump &amp; this regime you are a racist.
The Apostle John wrote that this would happen in the Book of Revelations. Believers must turn their back on God in order for Babylon(Western World) to fall and for the AntiChrist to take power. Trump is merely a Puppet of Satan in this time before the 7 years of Tribulation!
I would rather have a whole neighborhood of  than one neighbor who is a Trump! Except your sister. I would rent her a room😁
“I was very impressed with her and other doctors that stood with her,” Trump told reporters Wednesday morning, ahead of a trip to Texas. “I think she made sense, but I know nothing about her.”

So it turns out the owner of this drive-through coffee business that has Trump n’ Jeeziz n’ guns bumper stickers all over is also a casual homophobe. Who would have guessed.
And alas, the last thing that loyal Americans would want our president to discuss is dead American soldiers. Traitor Trump! Should be trending all over Facebook and Twitter!
“He doesn’t have to win the election. He just has to create a plausible narrative that he didn’t lose.” (Correction: It doesn't need to be plausible. Nothing in his alt reality is plausible yet his cult buys it no matter what.)
I’d bet if you asked the average Trumper how trump has made their life better that they’d be hard pressed to come up with a concrete answer.
And trump. It’s probably one of Putin’s conditions for not revealing the pee pee tapes!
Yet millions do! The same millions that would believe a Dr Demon Seed over Dr Fauci. We’ve got to vote trump out come November if we ever hope to bring sanity back to America!
Trump and his trumpets are undermining our standing on the world stage which only makes us that much weaker.

But enough about Trump’s stormtroopers
We pull out of Germany, and Trump gets help from Russia with the election. Simple.
His supporters are that stupid! There’s no end to their stupidity! They even believe Dr Demon Seed over Dr Fauci! This country is going to hell under trump!
What a bunch of assholes. Very un-American! But what would you expect from trump’s SS?!
Milwaukee, your leaders are heartless. They won’t look into the death of this man simply because he was a Trump supporter. Where is your heart where is your soul where is your conscience?
It’s not even likely a trump supporter.
I was particularly tickled when Trump involved The Bush Administration for contradicting support, adding, 'no friends of mine....' Right before he said that I thought, 'Even the former Bush administration hates you. You don't even compare to their evil.'
Honestly at this point, if trump said “meth cures COVID” republicans would believe it and go buy that, too

Trump country
Because conservatives, Republicans/Trumpublicans, right wing nut jobs, Trumpsters, Trumpers, "Always Trump"'ers, etc always like to cherry pick the parts of the Bible that they interpret differently so that it applies to whatever bullshit they want to further their agendas on.
All I can tell you is we damn sure weren’t ready for trump.
Now trump wants to break our mail to kill off mail in voting.
This is just the footage trump needs to send his federal highly untrained asshats here to show his “law and order”
Trump and the entire GOP like this shit.
Do not people realize we are way f#*'ed Trump wins again?
Jeff, are you sure you have the time to post that tweet?  You only get paid by Soros if you're the first to post after Trump tweets, so you're really being selfless to post being number 4. So special...
The Government scientists who work for Trump in the FDA and CDC would disagree with you. What does this pandemic have to do with Marxism?

I love Mary Trump as a pundit that hasn’t been steeped in journalism cliches
Trump continues to be a mythomaniac.
They have, Dr Fauci has repeatedly said that Trump has listened to him and taken the actions him and Birx recommended.
You need 1 more of those that states "Votes for Trump".
REPEAT AFTER ME...TRUMP MUST GO NOW!  WTF is wrong with people? The numbers have been stabilizing because the numbers no longer go to the CDC! Trump still has not investigated the bounty on our troop's heads!  He is UNSTABLE! He is trying to KILL us ALL!
“One does not simply infect Donald Trump with the Corona virus...” C’mon, yah know, he’s fucking Satan, and everybody who has caught this virus, will reanimate as a zombie after they die, we’re in the shit baby!!!

Going to mock me with a picture of you asking when Trump has been racist.  Damn, you really destroyed my relationship and confidence. I can never return.
They don't they just pretend to for trump so they can save their asses
It's a good thing you have a photo of that moronic tweet of yours.  I cannot believe there are people going around thinking Trump isn't racist. I hope you find that photo years later and cringe at it.
I just don’t have the energy to walk through the entire conspiracy against Trump on the Russia angle.  If and when indictments come we can revisit.
Not the USPS. The Trump admin and the new postmaster general.
Thinking the same thing. Trump wasn’t a hypocrite.

YOU ARE TRUMP, you own this craziness. Once you become one with trump, you are never clean again. I once thought you were the brightest voice on the PROGRESSIVE LEFT, now, I tune you out.
…but the rest of the Dem party didn't agree, and Biden is STILL better than Trump, as long as he selects a reasonable VP. He'll LISTEN to the advisors trying to manipulate him, rather than actively ignoring anything that wasn't already in his head.
Humpty Dumpty Donald Trump got tired of having Great Falls from walls built by all the king's horses &amp; men &amp; usually in Montana   TO SOLVE THIS - He IMMEDIATELY told all the king's horses &amp; men after putting him back together again that THIS TIME he was going to RUN FOR PRESIDENT
How about a GOVERNOR EXECUTIVE ORDER to fix the problem. If trump can rewrite FEDERAL STATUE with a EXECUTIVE ORDER, then I believe a GOVERNOR should be able to override STATE STATUTES by EXECUTIVE ORDER
WOWZA! Must see why President Trump is called a racist!!! 🙌🏼✝️🙏🏼🇺🇸
Trump is a fascist pig who serves only himself.
Humpty Dumpty Donald Trump is just a Trojan Horse for the Radical Alt Right Agenda. He will make them do whatever he wants them to!
I hear there's a Dr in Houston that would vote Trump too. Also advocates demon sex and witchcraft  Given your Daddy Donnie needs all the help he can get it might me worth the trip to have "Occult for Trump."
Of course! What kind of question is this? This is NOT Nazi Germany, it’s America and as much as we may HATE the idea of a Trump supporter, we are GOOD people!

Someday, decades or even centuries from now, we'll have descendants asking themselves, "How was Trump &amp; any "Republican" member of Congress, BOTH House &amp; Senate, allowed to remain in office despite destroying almost every pillar of American democracy &amp; American freedom?"
So less affordable housing as promised here by Trump will somehow solve the homeless problem? That is some first rate #RepublicanLogic. I’ll give you that.
To my fellow Colorado liberals/leftists, regardless of your party affiliations (or lack thereof), help vote out the Trump asskisser, Cory Gardner!  He is a card-carrying member of the Trumpublican GOP party.

I recall Trump mentioning diabetes a long time ago
Trump defends Germany withdrawal  The only one delinquent here is Trump. He is doing it to please Putin. The man is a threat to our National Security.
Trump says he has not spoken to Putin about alleged Russian bounties on U.S. troops  Trump said nothing but kiss Putin's ass. trump is a fool and Putin knows it.
'Slap in the face': Romney blasts troop withdrawal from Germany  trump was on the phone with Russia. So of course trump plays the puppet and withdraws troops to please Putin again. This administration is just corrupt and has to go.
Trump, Mnuchin float short-term deal as relief talks stall  kicking it down the road does not work. this is typical of our government who just can not function.
I don't think Republicans realize anything. Certainly not the concept of a history book being made in the future. Who needs to think about history? When Donald j Trump is the president. I almost feel bad for them. Keyword being almost. 😂🤣😂🤣
McConnell suggests Dems are trying to 'sabotage' the next coronavirus bill  leave to McConnell and the GOP ran senate to throw blame. It is common for them and trump to do so. They added FBI bldg. money, border wall money which is not a covid priority.
Trump says he has not spoken to Putin about alleged Russian bounties on U.S. troops  was to afraid to. the man is spineless. talks a big song and dance and just pees his pants.

Why not? He may not accept responsibility but the Buck stops at his golf cart! Trump was in charge of protecting the USA from the Trump Virus and he failed BIGLY! He ignored it and delayed taking proactive action. This is why the USA leads the world in cases and deaths.
One of my problems with Trump has been, if he makes statements like this in public, what is he saying in private? A person who looks down on minorities and low-income families has NO business running our country. If you support this racist rhetoric, YOU are part of the problem.
Election must be coming up?  Santa Trump is flying around on Air Force 1 handing out money!
Um - trump jr was temporarily suspended for violating the rules of the platform he joined.   But you know this...
It’s not could.  is in big trouble because of his unending loyalty to Trump and unwillingness to watch out for his constituents. Not to mention his support for Putin.
The Right have been conditioned to believe Socialism is bad. They used to think Communism was bad, but since trump entered the WH, with Russia’s help, suddenly Communism isn’t bad anymore. A couple of fools wearing t-shirts showing that. Happened during Mueller investigation.
ugh, do you not see the whole point here, yes, all these mega billionaires could donate, what is more important, ending the GOP and trump destruction of American or giving some money that might last a month or two - him donating to defeat trump and the GOP will last forever.
This is INFURIATING!   Trump clearly says he doesn’t have a problem with Russian bounties or supplying weapons to the Taliban because “we did it too!” That was against the Soviets, this is a different time, and Russia is actively working against us on ALL fronts! #TraitorTrump
Exactly! Trump* and the GOP are the party( if you can even call them that) of hate, cruelty and racism‼️
Where is this "proof"?  I mean if proof is shown against Trump, it's "fake news", but usually the only "proof" we get to the contrary is "Believe me", so if there is actual proof, let's see it
I have a question, is ANYTHING ever Trump's fault? His supporters don't seem to think so.
BIG BUCKS OF TAXPAYER MONEY ARE GOING TO REBUILD THE FBI BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET FROM TRUMP HOTEL. Yes, in the middle of the biggest financial shitshow and virus massacre in history- you are enriching yourself at our expense.

This is like watching the BEST OF POLITICAL BLOOPERS, when watching the trump campaign explain trumps behaviors
trump has one ☝️ AGENDA, TALKING POINTS, REALITY, if he isn’t the originator of the IDEA, it doesn’t exist. They can give him notes, but he can only read so much before his mind drifts to his real thoughts
It is my thinking that fascist pig trump is the devil incarnate.

The Trump admin is destroying 'hard working families' with everything you do. McConnell and Barr are doing everything they can to protect these abuses. I recommend that you shut up and hide until Biden takes over in January and you can go back to a private life.

Not for nothing, but  was told repeatedly holding his rally was a bad idea.   Hardly anyone showed up and Herman Cain caught Covid 19 and passed away.   Trump just doesn’t listen, and he is not that swift. No wonder we are where we are.
AND healthcare is EXTREMELY important. Not medicare for all. Trump is doing everything in his power to get rid of healthcare!
If you get trump you lose all healthcare. So choose your poison. We are losing our Democracy under trump right now. It will be gone if he wins. Welcome to living under a Dictator. You didn't burst my bubble. Single payer is what we should be pushing!
Yep. I want healthcare too. I know it is an issue. But those that won't for Biden because he won't back Medicare for all, well Trump wins. Then you get nothing. He will dismantle ACA. So you are willing to put trump in office for 4 more years (or more) for one issue?
Trump does not have the authority to delay the election. It’s not his call. He’s distracting from other bad news for him - GDP, COVID. Don’t take the bait.

More happy horseshit as Trump invades our cities with his “secret police”, more unemployed since the Great Depression, judges instilled that have never even tried a case, pardons for those that shielded trump, on track for a quarter million dead by Election Day....
They are in total denial. My 93 year old conservative father is voting blue this year, he thinks tRump is an idiot. Although he is quick to say "This does NOT mean that I am a Democrat"
Hopefully by then Trump rolls out federal police and all police agencies take down these terrorist organizations.
So tell us, what has been so dangerous so far? The booming economy we had? Record low unemployment? The end of the NAFTA agreement? Look at democrat run cities and you think Trump is dangerous? Lmao!!
Not to be dramatic or anything but something inside my dishwasher sounds like Jumanji so if I go missing just know I might be in a land where Trump isn't president so leave me be
Damn straight. We have vets in my family going back to the revolutionary was. This is such a low point in American history. Trump and his bff Putin paying bounties to kill American troops. They should face crimes against humanity charges.

I predict even lower polling numbers for Trump next week. Then he can say the new tone didn’t work and he’ll go back to being racist, sexist and all other “ists” again.
⁦ but you can give trump a half trillion lire n a slush fund to enrich himself, his family and his friends.  We are at the precipice of a homeless disaster like you have never seen before. Right before the election.

Do you mean similar to how the Democrats reacted after the last election?  And that little prick has the gall to insinuate that Trump won’t leave when Adam has effectively destroyed any reasonable transfer of power over the last 4 years.

Trump couldn’t get the military to do this, so he hired mercenaries. At taxpayer expense. Erik Prince is making bank on this deal.

It seems to me that the issue is a lot deeper than liking or not liking Donald Trump, which is why I honed in on the issues of white grievance and Christian nationalism.   Of course most R politicians don’t like him, but Donald Trump’s ugly politics did not ascend in a vacuum.
Didn’t Herman Cain attend the recent Trump re-election rally in Tulsa?  Also, respectfully, Pat Buchanan is precisely the kind of politician we used to support whose legacy we should now re-evaluate in light of present events.

Why isn’t the press addressing this with trump and his press secretary?  People want to know.

do all republicans lie? Seems so.   Looks like Kansas will be flipping a senate seat blue. Kansans are not happy with Trump or Barr.
Also, trump cheated on his preg wife and paid off several women (with NDAs) to keep them quiet. Bill had conceptual sex with adult women and because of a deadbeat Linda Tripp, turned on Monica. Both are disgusting but trump feels his money and NDAs are his MO.
I don't know how he does it.   I watch Tucker and Hannity and I am exhausted.   Trump fights 24 hours a day.

What a huge lie. If tha were the case trump could have stopped Coronavirus in its tracks when he first learned of it.   He woukdnt have his Gomes our shooting and pepper spraying Moms either.
was Trump just uninterested in the virus speech you made him read yesterday, or drugged?
Trump keen to use executive orders and circumvent Congress        You all went apoplectic when Obama did this, especially for DACA. I expect to see that same kind of revulsion, otherwise Biden should be able to use it unencumbered.
The only reason trump reversed course on masks is b/c someone told him he would lose the election if persisted. And that not slowing down the pandemic will cost him the election.  It's too little, too late. Too may have died and too many are suffering long term health effects.
If the law is clear, why can’t *local police arrest and detain Trump’s army for violating the Fourth Amendment if nothing else?

Just another sucessful Trump bribe. Cory backs Trump in impeachment and supports his lawlessness; in return, Trump agrees to sign the bill so Cory can go back to Colorado and claim he is a superhero for public lands.  Trump doesn’t care about public land. He cares about himself.

Oh a sexist for Trump, how novel.  And you see nothing wrong with the way you just responded, do you, given that you disagree with her. Wonder if your mother and grandmother would approve of you talking to a woman that way?  Don’t kid yourself.
Well said. It was unfortunate of me to include substance abusers with Trump supporters.
Understood, and I agree.  So lumping trump supporters with alcoholics isn't fair.  I finally agree with you.  I love some trump supporters I know, but I excuse them for that.   I see what you mean…  still I'd be suspicious of undiscovered human failings with a trump supporter…

Good question!  The flaw is twisting your logic around to justify supporting someone as obviously faulted as Trump.  Believing what you want to believe.  Finding "TRUTH” in websites that match your preexisting inner beliefs.  Feeling persecuted by honest reporting.
Upon closer reflection I see your point of likening a trump supporter to alcoholics, but only in that both things are bad.  So it’s not a very interesting comparison and not one I intended to make.

No. They had to because Trump did nothing to contain the virus in January and now 150,000+ Americans are unnecessarily dead. Hilarious! Ps- S Korea, Japan, New Zealand &amp; others contained covid &amp; are now operating normally, because they don't have a dipshit con artist in charge.

Trump winning by diverting attention and raging against something states control. He’s owning the narrative today when the GDP report and jobless claims are the real story. Media falls for Trump every time.  He’s spewing garbage trying to find a nugget that helps him.

You're kidding, right? This is Trump trying to be strategic for America? No, it's strategic for Russia. I'm not near an expert but this has been playing out since 2017. Bit by bit. And Putin, err, Trump needs to get it done now, just in case he can't steal the election.

You're wrong. Fauci has a higher approval rating then Trump, which is driving Trump crazy. It is the White House that is trying to discredit Fauci. Fauci tells the truth; Trump wants people to die.

That's where our government should have protected us. Millionaires and billionaires received pandemic benefits. That's wrong. Trump's buddies got richer. The Trump administration isn't helping anyone but himself and his friends.
Fauci wasn't a political hack until Trump said he was. There was a lot of misinformation in the beginning because we knew nothing about the virus.   I played softball not because I am a lesbian but because I was good at it.
Yes, but you can't pay your bills if you're dead. Or, look at the increased debt if you have to be hospitalized with the virus for any length of time.  The first step was to contain the virus. Trump didn't do that so lives are lost and so is the economy.
In case there was any doubt, Trump knows why people don't like or approve of him.
As someone who played softball for 20 years, I felt badly for Fauci's pitch. But who cares - the man has a brilliant mind, something Trump supporters don't appreciate. You respond better to lies and bullying.   Where's the double standard?
I am a hater of everything Trump.
You're not a good person. You support Trump.
I had hoped getting rid of Trump would be like removing a mole or draining a boil. It’s turned out to be more like removing a 10 pound cancerous puss draining tumor with a putty knife and a corkscrew.Not a big fan of semantics, but the media plays themselves better than Trump ever could.

You are not reading what I have written carefully. I am not blaming the US. I am pointing out similarities between USSR and US objectives in Afghanistan. Trump pointed out that the US killed Soviets through proxies just as the Russians maybe killing Americans through proxies.
Opinion | Americans are suffering. Trump offers them a doctor who warns of sex with demons.
Then what was the Mueller investigation about? It couldn't be about the Trump campaign because the FBI had long before concluded there was no Trump Russia collusion. Since there was no Trump Russia collusion there was no reason for Sessions to recuse himself.
We are to believe that it started because of two conversations with 2 guys who were on the periphery of the Trump campaign. But the dossier was the cornerstone for the FISA warrants &amp; by January 2017 the FBI (&amp; the CIA) had determined that the dossier was rumor and speculation.
Liberals like to delude themselves and you are proving that you are no exception. I know my position about Trump and you don't.
I am not lying. You make baseless assumptions about people that you don't know. You have fantasized a caricature of people that voted for Trump.
Having an open mind is not synonymous with supporting Trump. I voted for Trump but I am not a great supporter of him.
FBI knew in January 2017 that no one in the Trump campaign had colluded with the Russians and that Flynn had done nothing nefarious. So why was a special counsel appointed? It was based on a lie; was part of a cover by the Obama administration for spying on a political opponent.
How could it possibly be a lie? The FBI determined in January 2017, way before the special counsel was appointed, that there was no factual basis for the idea that the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians. You are easily duped friend.
He gave an honest answer based on an issue he hadn’t researched. He didn’t say Trump could delay the election.
The absurd claim that William Barr is a henchmen for Donald Trump. There’s absolutely no evidence of that and the history is that Barr is a rule of law guy unlike Jayapal.
They wanted to thumb their noses at the fake pandemic. They still have another restaurant in CO Springs. They were, they are Trump supporting assholes who chose to break the law.
The only reason for a special counsel was if the president was involved and his attorney general was compromised. The Trump campaign wasn’t involved in Russian interference thus there was no reason for a special counsel to investigate Russian interference.
What was the predicate for the FBI to investigate the Trump campaign? According to the FBI, it was the dossier and the FBI knew in January 2017 the dossier was garbage. So why was there a Mueller probe?
If Trump is not reelected and Democrats gain control of the Senate, all the policies that William Buckley advocated against his entire life will be more likely than ever to become reality.
Trumps not getting a lot of help from NR. Democrats downplayed effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine. Democrats downplaying the lawlessness across the country. Big tech companies supporting Democrats censoring conservatives. But Trump’s form is what’s important to Geraghty.
Do tell, where’s your proof of that one? And, don’t tell me Trump’s voodoo priestess or Qanon leaked it!
One of the reasons that establishment types hate Donald Trump is because he questions conventional wisdom. The US helped people that would become Al-Qaeda kill Soviet soldiers.
Rather curious that the focus of the article is on Trump tweeting this doctor and not the fact that Democrats and media have downplayed this drug because they oppose Trump and not having anything to do with science.
By January 2017, the FBI had already determined that no one in the Trump campaign had broken any laws concerning Russian interference, and Flynn wasn’t a Russian agent. The Mueller investigation was based on a lie.
The problem is you fail to appreciate that there was never any predicate for the Obama administration to spy on the Trump campaign or the Mueller investigation.
He’s absolutely correct. Donald Trump gets positive things done. Joe Biden will mess things up.
Hardly. He says that Trump turned the Department of Homeland Security into a private militia. That is a malicious lie and certainly will appeal to the far left mob and anarchists.
How does that distinguish Trump from Joe Biden? Congressional Democrats? Any other Democrat official?
I repeat, the FBI and Mueller found no criminal violations by Trump campaign members having to do with colluding with the Russians. Therefore he had no corrupt motive. Learn to live with the facts.
Because it wasn’t published by a Republican, a member of the Trump family or a conservative.
What legal authority does Trump have as president to mandate a national health policy concerning COVID-19? Maybe it’s not Trump that’s clueless.
Joe Biden Will Not Defund the Police !!!    Donald tRump is Lying to Americans Again !  Fact !
She was part of the Russia Trump collusion hoax lie. Nancy Pelosi continues to perpetuate that lie to this day despite FBI documentation proving it was a lie all along. There has never been a more divisive and dishonest Speaker of the House in US history.
Then how do you explain the Newsweek article about a study that says hydroxychloroquine has been effective? Only people suffering from TDS think everything is about Trump.
.Until the pandemic, United States was leading the world in income per capita growth between 2017 and 2019. That’s real progress. If you don’t think Trump has policies then you just aren’t paying attention. But Democrats like failure that’s why they celebrate Governor Cuomo.
I don’t need to read volume 2 because it’s nonsense. If the FBI and Mueller found no criminal conduct by Trump campaign relating to Russian interference, how could he have a corrupt motive?
What’s embarrassing is that you can’t distinguish between being unhappy with the policies that Trump talks about as opposed to a candidate who has trouble speaking intelligently on anything.
I also think AG Barr is his own person so not a puppet  of Pres Trump . A straight shooter goes by the law. How dare you  say different !
Kamala , are you thinking “I” nor others buy your comment , nope!! I support Trump 100% !
Obstruction requires corrupt motive. Since Mueller’s team could find no evidence of crimes committed by the Trump campaign related to interference in the election, there could be no corrupt motive.
I’m not a big Trump supporter. But demagoguery is not limited to Donald Trump. The Democrats have been demagoguing the COVID-19 response which is why so many Americans are confused.
Apparently you’re not a fan of the presumption of innocence. I’m glad that President Trump is.
Her hypothetical question was “if Trump loses the election” can he then resign? No, that’s why we have a electoral process.
If Trump wins the election I will never trust anyone again in my life. And that's already a steep slope.
What if Trump loses but refuses to leave office? Here's the worst-case scenario | Lawrence Douglas | Opinion | The Guardian
F U C K. Y O U. donald trump You pile of runny Dog shit🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽 Better keep your eyes open jackoff...🖕🏽
Damn it Democrats, don’t pass this bill. You will have blood on your hands.  The package of bills rolled out on Monday included....In line with Mr. Trump’s demands, it would reserve tens of billions of dollars in federal funding for schools that reopen for in-person instruction.
I'm truly trying to figure out how "Trump gets picked on too much" is in any way relevant.
Tom Hanks became a Greek citizen. The rest of us are going to stay here and fight tyranny in the street if necessary. What does it say that Tom Hanks, mister America, doesn’t want to be an American citizen? Seriously that’s enough to vote for a can of soup not Trump
Do you really believe "Trump might get attacked" is a valid reason to skip out on the funeral of a civil rights leader?  I mean, how insecure is this guy??
Don't blame them.  I'd not want to smear Reagan's good name with Trump's craziness
Thanks love your comment. I agree Dems do not WANT TO CONFRONT VIOLENSE ON OUR CITIES AND TEARING DOWN OUR STATUES!! Why? I think they are not only unconcerned they like it. They want the cities destroyed, economy depressed, citizens lives/ jobs ruined. Why? Blame Trump , sick!!
Shameful , and lack of what is truthful regarding GOP in office and President Trump. I voted for Trump because not his non political past behavior.. BUT HIS ASTUTE KNOWLEDGE AND DESIRE TO hopefully change the path OUR Country was on. AND he did! He accomplished more 3yrs no one h
Biden doesn’t have to!  Trump is a dumpster fire.  Just think of a sitting President losing in the polls to an aging ex VP who doesn’t make many appearances.  Biden is just letting Trump dig his own grave.
You fell for that blatant lie? Biden wants to increase funding for police; specifically for better training.  Rules of thumb: if Fox says it, it's probably wrong. If Trump says it, he's probably guilty of what he's accusing the other person of doing.
Reagan wouldn't recognize Trump's GOP.
It’s called the Trump Virus.
Why do you guys keep using that urban legend narrative? Like they just swapped jerseys one day. I don’t believe people are racist just because they are Democrats but spinning it to call republicans racist and Trump racist is ridiculous.
Hillary Clinton paid Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on Trump from Russian sources. Maybe you would be happier in your life if you based it on reality and not  utter fantasy.
Yeah, Trump’s the embarrassment.
Perhaps part of your problem is that you can’t distinguish when Trump is engaging in humor and Biden is displaying declining mental faculties.
Weak people are of strong people ?? I am a strong person and a Trump supporter !  Again weak people are of strong people what the heck does that ever mean??
Gee Leticia I have lots to say to you!! Obviously though with your comment you won’t listen. Good Luck siding with the socialist party . I am one of many many whom truly care about America and will ALL be voting for Trump 2020
And little Eric Trump thinks interference in an election is Definitely Not A Good Thing
Complacency basically to work with Pres Trump. I am disgusted how Congress has done zero , zero to improve and solve any problems ! Why, basically no interest fo do so, Dems are pissed, and their socialistic platform is only good if they are in power. Non constitutional govt. 🤨
I SO don’t agree . Pres Trump isn’t decrypted far from it ! He is astute hard working and innovative..to solve our County’s problems. BTW I do not know one other Pres that works as hard. He CARES !
Ha! The lawlessness is enabled by the Democrats.. that is the deal . Lif you pay attention Dems are wanting unrest and turmoil . Works for them blame Trump . Blame him as well for trying to end it in PortlNd . Stormtrooper, Gestapo language .. dispicable and you should see it !!
What’s funny is that of the vast majority that support him, Trump wouldn’t piss on the best part of most of them, nor lift a finger to help them when they needed it. Further, he will and is actively fucking them every chance he gets. Covidiot’s abound
The reason you can't make up conspiracies is because Trump already is supporting or killing Maxwell and Epstien. The deep state isn't real. The earth isn't flat. The reason anyone needs a conspiracy theory is to mentally jump around in circles to support something no one else is.
I stand corrected. Which is also something you will never hear Trump say- ever
Shhhh Trump will want to come over!
You’re secret police are inciting violence, breaking the law and trampling on the constitution. President Trump is a Russian agent taking direction from Putin. Enough is enough. Recall these Terror troops and seek forgiveness from God. #LincolnProject
If trump is a racist hes the worst at it lmao.
Motive not clear? 60% of Biden supporters fine with Trump donors losing job, not a far stretch to assume motive here
Yes Bernie Bros.  Definitely say no to Biden so Trump and Barr can gas you morons at your protests.  Most of you will be unemployed and homeless as Trump destroys the working class economy and pisses off our allies but you will have your principles. Sadly, you’ll deserve it.
HATER -of ALL THAT IS American VOTE TRUMP IN NOVEMBER
Biden's campaign is out-raising Trump's right now and Trump is sinking in the polls.  This vaccine would have to garner significant votes.
This must have been an uncomfortable time in your life. We're and HIM are glad you have accepted full Trump Truth.🥔💪.
I'm seeing a lot of this as well --- R voters sitting it out because they can't bring themselves to vote Trump but are still loyal (enough) to the party to not betray them with a D vote.
Plus Trump was all "IT'S RIGGED!!!1!!" before he realized he was going to win.
First responders are now responders. Screeners to decide whether patients live or die, but trump wore a mask today?’
Does Trump understand anything? I mean aside from toilet burger?
Trump literally thinks we’re dumb enough to forget the last 4 months
Trumps new campaign manager obviously threatened to quit unless trump listened to him. 3 campaign managers in 2 weeks is a rend no campaign can withstand. We won’t forget his crimes against the American people
Did trump just say the children are in danger of morbidity and mortality?
Push back on JeffCo &amp; other school districts opening. Push Polis for Exec authority for health emergencies if necessary. CO not a Trump colony  like TX, GA. or FLA!  Protect your constituents!  My wife &amp; I seniors with serious health conditions! Push the GOV!
Please push back on JeffCo &amp; other school districts opening. Use Executive authority for health emergencies if necessary. You are NOT a Trump toady like Kemp, Abbott or Desantis!  Protect your constituents!  My wife &amp; I seniors with serious health conditions! Stand firm!
Republicans: Socialism is the worst 🤬🤬🤬 Now excuse me while I go support Trump while he gives farmers a $28 billion bailout using our taxpayer money.
so trump creates these dismal realities for us, create the crime and poverty through everything he does, then blames democrats and sends in personal militia to cities ravaged by the virus 🦠? People actually don’t see this horror?
When politicians wouldn’t know the truth from a toilet burger. Trump
During the Obama/Biden administration more than 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu. It would seem that the Trump administration looks like it’s doing an absolutely magnificent job in comparison.
How has Trump violated the Constitution?
I haven’t seen Trump set fire to any buildings. How is Trump destroying the country? I think what you have in mind for the country will destroy it.
Very successful business owner? Successful business owners don't go bankrupt four times. Successful business owners pay their contractors. Trump is just a grifter.
Wow,  are you a time traveler? Went into the future and saw this? This is what’s happening right now! While Trump is president. How daft can people be to believe this, and then use it as an argument as to why Trump should be re-elected.
This is Trump's America right now, dipshit. Secret police kidnapping Americans off the street in unmarked vans. Riots in the streets protesting militarized police. A president building a fascist regime. Civil War one bad day away. Trump's America.
The difference is that Joe Biden approves of this behavior while President Trump doesn’t.
But um...Joe Biden approves of this while President Trump doesn’t.
Trump didn't respond for 3 hours in the mid morning because he was golfing. You really need to check your arguments before you post them.
But people are shot because they are.....not the same as the shooter.  I love America also, but it's just America, not United.  If you did deploy, u deployed to protect it all.   Freedoms for folks to carry guns, to speak out against Obama, Trump, Bush...and to kneel.
please do not let the media tell you that being a Christian = being a trump supporter. sincerely, a Christian who sees the irony in tear gassing people to pose with a Bible
They can get comfort zones and pets to sooth them .. just like when Trump was elected. These liberals can they make an effort and get a JOB!  Gee good luck liberals, if the economy is doing well MAYBE  then you will find work. Good luck liberals .😊
Ted Cruz called out this Trump-hating NBA owner for refusing to say these three words  I’m with you Ted Cruz 100% Mark Cuban is an arrogant A

Is that Trump Barbie number one or number two?
What a pathetic hypocritical joke. Nancy Pelosi calls it the Trump virus.
Good Luck with this group of tRump Bootlickers  !  They will sell Florida Down the river and think nothing of it !  Vote Blue 2020 !This almost makes me feel sad for tRump.   Quotes from every other major American leader (hate to call McConnell and, worse yet, W! that, but in contrast?) are all just devastating.    calls out his lies in the *news* story.  Pathetic.
2016-2020 will go down as The Trump Years, period. Whatever your opinion on him, it will be utterly impossible to understand the history of these four years without understanding him. All this to say - sure, but they’ll learn about Trump first. Kaep makes no sense without him.
In case everyone forgot. Trump is a giant fucking hypocrite once again... He voted by mail himself recently.
I deadass forget trump is president on a weekly basis
You have proven, we are not safe in Trump/Pences America.
Trump's gestapo.  #TrumpGestapo
It was safe before this Trump appointed donor took over. Give him a lot of money and he'll give you a job in some agency he wants to ruin.  I will work to get my ballot to an official drop box rather than trust his new bagman, Louis DeJoy.
Everyone from Trump on down doing Putin's bidding.
A Trump lackey.
Trump and Barr are directing the violence. The Portland courthouse firestarter was found to be an Aryan white supremacist, racist leader directed by the far right to incite violence among the peaceful protestors. #TrumpThreatensAmerica  #ImpeachTrumpAgain #TrumpleThinSkin
#TrumpStealsElection #TrumpFraud Trump has initiated step 1 of remaining in office or stealing the election.  Laying the foundation to declare voter fraud.  “There will be fraud, need to delay the election.”
Former Obama Activist: "Run Away" To Trump!  via       I Love this woman, she makes so much sense!
Yes. It's a fact that trump upheld the duties of the office.
But that's not the argument. JFC get treated for your trump derangement syndrome.
Fantastic. The cool kids are ready to get rid of Trump.
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣 trump will be indicted Jan. 20.
His sisters not a judge anymore! No more mistrial defense. Or interferences.
“Respectable” conservatives like Calabresi have been telling me for 4½ years I was hysterically overreacting when I called Trump fascistic. “Trump Derangement Syndrome!” “You said that about Romney too!” (Nope.)  If they’ve finally realized they were wrong, great—but maybe say so
Still waiting for Trump's national plan to lower the COVID Rates, testing and contract tracing, make sure schools are safe and for us to have a safe national election.  When is he going to release?
The courthouse firestarter apprehended in Portland was found to be tied to a white supremacist, Aryan, racist group. He was directed by the far right to incite violence among the peaceful protesters. You're a moron. tRump's a racist. #TrumpleThinSkin
GDP is -32.9% this quarter, Trump is threatening to move the election, and we’ve lost 150,000 Americans to COVID-19.  #MAGA #Trump #JadeHelm #StopElectingPeopleWhoDontBelieveInGovernment

Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
trump:  It's too dangerous to hold our election in November.  Also trump:  It's safe enough to send your babies to school right now.
⁦ : This one is for you!      You have echoed lies and defended demagoguery. It must sting to still be defending Trump.
You are dying breed, wrong side of history! You have and your Con man Trump has made China a more reliable country as compared to USA!
Rules for thee but not for me! Anyway, Trump’s tweet about delaying the 2020 election has probably already cured covid.
Im so sick and tired of these I voted Republican all my life and voted for trump because he was the lesser of two evils bullshitters. now months before his term ends with lowered chances of re-election gop voters have seen the light! FUCK YOU! Y’all made this. #FederalistSociety
Nah. Trump fully supports Absentee Ballots.  Let everyone vote absentee. That way we can ensure safety.
The people that were caught red handed trying to burn the courthouse in Portland were all associated with the firestarter, who was found out to be an Aryan, far right, white supremacist, fascist, Trump supporter. He was directed by the far right to create a riot. So there's that.
Also in spring 2016, Trump threatened violence by his supporters in order to discourage a delegate revolt at the 2016 GOP convention. That wasn’t “fascistic” enough for Mr. Calabresi, but this morning’s tweet is?  Again: I welcome his support. But I’d also appreciate a reckoning.
A year or so ago, my 81 year old trump supporting mother told me Tucker Carlson speaks her language. I’ll never forget it as long as I live.
So now it’s ‘Communist’ China? Is this all you and Trump have for the campaign? Don’t you have anything better to do than harass the NBA?
just can't quit LYING Just Kidding? Trump Says His Election Delay Tweet Was Just a Ploy to Get ‘Very Dishonest LameStream Media’ to Cover Mail-In Voting  #SmartNews
Well, I am a conservative. That's the point.  Regardless, it appears that  did oppose Trump's Tweet today.
is GOING DOWN... Number of Americans who fervently oppose Trump's reelection approaches point of no return  #SmartNews
...after he said in a GOP debate that he’d order a war crime (killing families of terrorists), and insisted generals would follow his illegal order because he would be a “strong” leader. Did Mr. Calabresi miss that debate? (It was the one where Trump also talked about his penis.)
Resistance libs love to talk about how they miss "not having to think about the president" when like they don't have to now either. They read about whatever trump is doing and say UGH I HATE HIM SO MUCH and then go back to their normal lives because it doesn't affect them
tRump deflecting his minions’ attention back to Obama. It’s classic penis envy - Obama was the greatest President in recent history and tRump is the worst in all of history so bad tells you how bad good was - not fooled - Obama is a gentleman &amp; a scholar #TrumpIsLosing 🏌️‍♂️📱🍔💩🤡
The Trump virus was already here. And you still aren’t doing shit! How much is the bounty for a dead American? We know you don’t care about the Troops!!
Look, I welcome all converts, no matter how belated. But it would behoove folks like Mr. Calabresi to eventually acknowledge *they were wrong* to not see this coming, and gravely wrong to enable it. Trump has been “fascistic” all along. I first called him that in February 2016...
Trump 2020!!
Oh please. Y'all said that 4 years ago, and look at the shit Trump and Republicans have done to our country. He had 4 yrs. He's destroyed relationships w/ our allies. He's threatening to postpone the election. He's trampled our civil rights. He is destroying the planet.
Nope. Trump is a dweeb. He doesn't know enough about anything at all to "hate" it.
Be careful!  The trump family is looting the national treasures!
Sounds a lot like Trump's goon squad.
She's a Trump follower and watches Fox News, so of course she wouldn't have seen it. Not that, that matters anyway.
But that's not something trump has done that no other one has... that's just fulfilling the role of the office.
Which is worse:  Trump on TV or a tornado overhead?
Wrote this 10 days ago...almost nobody seemed to have noticed that Dems were trying to give the Department of Homeland Security $50 billion at the very moment Dems were issuing press releases pretending to be mad at Trump for deploying DHS police to cities

Do you have ANY proof whatsoever his cancer came back? Do you have any explanation for why he was perfectly healthy walking around the Trump Tulsa rally in June? Give me a fucking break
Rad! Proud that my buddy  could set the *president of the United States* straight in this great op-ed about how easy and safe it is to run an election by mail, as we do in Colorado. No matter your political beliefs, the facts are crystal clear.
and you think those obama to trump voters are coming back to mush brain biden? lol
I don't think this decline and Trump getting Elected is a coincidence.
Lost my boy a few weeks ago. When we think the world should end, they remind us that pure love actually exists and we are worth it. Btw Trump doesn’t have a dog. Kinda explains a lot doesn’t it?
and you think those “normies” voted for trump because the economy (under obama) was benefiting them? you really think swing voters for trump were basing their decision on the economy? lol
I keep thinking we need the trump lookalike like the movie Dave to come in and make him look like an actual somewhat intelligent, caring human being! Too much to ask?
So would a biden presidency. You have given nothing other than orange man bad. If trump is so terrible, give me 5 things he has done that no other president has?
Why would Trump worry about his supporters? He doesn't even like most of them.

Trump doesn’t understand that the young aren’t the only ones who will be in schools, teachers, administrators, janitors, substitutes will not be immune, and neither will be the kids! That’s a lie, are you willing to bet your child’s life on Trump’s lies?
You want to shield your pals from lawsuits, cut unemployment, give money to big coprporatins and build a building to help Trump make more money.
Has Mr Schwartz totaled the campaign donations that have landed in Trump Enterprise’s bank account? I have been doing some reading on that topic. Reminds me of when the Trump family was forced to shutter their “Foundation” because they used it as a personal piggy bank. Grifters.

The fact that the head of the Federalist Society just called for Trump's removal AFTER they got all their wingnut judges on the courts tells you they viewed him as a useful idiot all along.
I did.  And you’re right. O isn’t sincere. He’s fake - a puppet for others. Doesn’t care cuz he’s rich &amp; narcissistic. The worst narcissist to come on the political scene ever. And since.  Trump’s got a huge ego, but there’s a huge difference.

This is tRump's America right now! So, He'll be fine handing over his misuse of everything he's ever touched in the US Gvmt. The prosecutors, including SDNY will be on him so quick. BTW, it looks like his taxes will be out and available very soon. #blocktrumpers #TrumpIsARacist
In other words , trump has no plan.  He’s good at making ultimatems, poor at guidelines, financing help for states dealing with the virus, and protecting the electorate.
This seems like a set up in the making.
Let’s start with who Trump put in charge, his son-in-law. I repeat. His son-in-law. *tap tap tap* Hey Republicans, can you hear me?! Son. In. Law.
Bush was worse than Trump. He’s just not as flagrantly stupid.
how many women have accused Trump? And I think that case was investigated, but how very trumpian of you to feel it is relevant

put it this way: trump won in a landslide in 16. what voters are switching sides in 2020? is dem momentum/enthusiasm any greater now (hint, it’s not)? are MAGA folks or the Right in general any less supportive of trump (hint, theyre not - he had a 50% in iowa 2016, it’s 91 now)?
Hahahahaha ok buddy. Exactly what I called - you dummies all think it's a conspiracy, so there is no point debating. Keep drinking the Trump Kool-Aid, pal. No interest in furthering this chat as you think it's all a big hoax so, again, take care.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Cornyn is a joke. Every time tRump makes an ass out of himself grasping for anything to help him stay in the WH/Oval Office, some Republicon idiot says he was joking. tRump is known for many personality traits, but natural comedian is NOT one of them. He’s scared and grasping.

Fucking Delusional Donnie Trump rambling Gaslighting his supporters  #BunkerBoy
ICYBN (In case you been nappin'): I've been predicting that Trump will try to delay or scrap the election. Today's tweet is a trial balloon. He and the puppeteers will learn where the resistance is, and how the move can be more effective. The move comes in Oct. Chaos is the goal.
So how is Trump acting now that he learned he can’t delay the election? Or has he accepted that yet? Are they still explaining it to him using small words?
I was furious at NPR because they reported Trump’s press conference saying that “ he’s asking Democrats to cooperate in getting help in terms of help for the unemployed. Nothing about Rs dragging their feet and trying to cut unemployment to $200 from $600.
Do you know how stupid you sound. Only the Republicans are doing that shit. Your boy Devin said so his Damn self. He said it's the only the Republican party is going to win this November. So ur goal is to stop us. all the while trump and u are doing the exact same shit.

Read this statement. Read this statement from a US Senator. Questioning why a court, which has a guilty plea from a defendant, that sentenced said defendant properly. Now this lapdog thinks it should all go away because Trump's AG decides to drop charges! Banana Republicans!
I love the mail in voting that we have in Colorado and will definitely be using vis mail in ballot in November to vote against Donald Trump and there not a thang that him and Putin can do about it.
It was only a matter of time. Trump supporters harassing my b.i.l. for being too brown in Colo. Told him to go back home. 1/3 of his ancestors have always called S. Colorado home. The rest were here before the United States existed. Now my child wants to avoid getting a tan.😠
I truly believe what Mary Trump said, that Donald Trump would have loved nothing better, than to have been the one with his knee on the neck of George Floyd. That is exactly what he is doing now, by suppressing the vote !
Saying that Trump "can't" delay the election is answering the wrong question. The real question is: What happens when he tries? Suppose one—or a few—governors go along with him? Saying "they can't" dodges the question again. What brand of chaos ensues?
#WeWillVote for Trump to hit the road.
He’s Dead ‘cause he did what Trump told him to do!!!!  Naively went to the Tulsa Rally without Social Distancing or wearing a mask!!!!!!
Funny how all Democrats, as well as some Republicans, have vehemently defended this racist relic when Trump was calling for its end.
you know it's wild out here when  is calling for impeachment and calling Trump "fascistic."
“If there were marked differences between Cory Gardner and Donald Trump, you could see that kind of ticket splitting going on. But, here, there is no difference. A vote for Cory Gardner is a vote for Donald Trump."

This presser today with Trump was worse than you can imagine.  I've started watching again, not because I can stomach him now, but I'm watching the cognitive decline.  I predict he just crumbles around the 2nd week of October.

Let’s get this straight.  In 2016, We went for the red curtain.  This year, there is no curtain.  We know you and your character.  No longer are we blind.  We choose the blue stage.  Biden and trump are both known to us now.

Lmaooo. And yet everything trump has ever said doesn’t.
Trump is simply evil
Then it’s a good thing that mail-in isn’t actually fraught with fraud. That’s just nonsense that Trump wants people to believe.
Trump has caused 150k deaths in this country with his inaction and nonsense. Cain and the others in Tulsa are victims of Trump And their own stupidity. I won’t say he deserved to die, but I do hope his death is a call to action for these bozos and their 🤡 leader.
Maybe consider the context before responding with your hot take on all Americans. I most definitely do NOT miss the Bush fam. The point was simple: Trump is such an egregious piece of shit that it makes you miss literally any other president.
Trump's already told us he doesn't kid and we know that is true because humor is a higher level of development and he's not there. Anytime someone says he was joking you can count on it being a lie.
If he can stand up to Jim Crow laws, everything that he did, sacrifice what he gave, we can surely stand up to Trump.  Follow his example and lead.  He showed us the way, and did it with love.

And still made the decision to put his fragile health at risk by attending Trump’s rally. CONTEXT!
The "embarrassment" to our country happened in November 2016, when Donald Trump was elected President. And it has grown exponentially.

Trump's supporters are dwindling.  He's lost the military, he alienated the courts now, his sheen is getting dull.  By then, he's going to be someone nobody wants to help, a complete outsider like Nixon was the day he resigned.
Every president I can recall promised to ensure the elections would be fair, and they did. Except Trump.
It is the end of The Republic. I don't see how we can come back from this. It's not just Trump, it is the block he represents. We cannot see each other's views. We speak different languages. We apparently worship different Gods. This is gonna be crazy. Not the good kind.
As previously tweeted, all the people that want a rifle designed to kill people on a battlefield can vote for Trump.  All the people who afraid for the kids or themselves, at a school, church, synagogue or Walmart can vote for Joe. I can live with it.
President Trump, You must quit keeping your promises! That is not how politicians do things. Obviously you didn't get the memo.  Just kidding!

You mean Sean Trump?
The government can run with Trump sitting in the WH. Biden can probably run the government from home and a decent office building in Dover or Wilmington.
mcconnell, barr and trump
Sigh. All the Trump humpers are dumb. It's so tiring explaining things to you, especially when you seem incapable of comprehending.  "Mail-in voting" (in most states) is the same as absentee voting. The voter requests a ballot.   Only In CO HI OR UT &amp; WA is it all vote-by-mail.
President Trump now virtually calling for a re-run of this November's Presidential election before it's started. Loser.
Kinda surprised Trump didn't try to make a comic company in the 90's that would have failed spectacularly...I bet he has an ungodly amount of pallets full of 90's Image number ones in some garage somewhere.

tRump and his GOP ...the shit they do is so exhausting and old news. We know...this is not new news but rather a new headline.  He has ruined this country.
No matter what though, a Trump win will make the left cry foul.  There’s really no way to get it right.  We are being set up for more chaos.
Indeed, Trump deranged health scare nazis have done quite a number on America. Hoax after hoax after hysterical stampede, just to get one man, at the expense of countless lives &amp; untold misery.  Once just cynical manipulative opportunists, Democrats are now a vicious evil plague.
Someone please make Trump stop
Lol. We cited credible studies, not crackpot quack doctors who believe in alien DNA and demon sperm.  He's a Trump supporter, he could have requested the hcq early on. But he's dead now.  We've not pushed any vaccine because none have been approved.  Trump has though.
What Trump jbasically said in this #WhiteHouse briefing is that WHEN the #election is held in November, and WHEN he loses, he will contest the results and try to drag it out for months if not years and refuse to leave the White House - so basically, become an illegal squatter.
Here in Colorado, everyone is mailed a ballot. However, you don't have to return it by mail. You can drop your ballot off in a ballot box at the county clerk's office or other designated locations. I highly recommend this given Trump's ongoing efforts to destroy the Post Office.
It's Trump's fault. #ItsTrumpsFault
Wait, what. Trump's argument against vote by mail is the post office fucked up and had some ballots get there too late. So we should not protect people's health by not allowing it instead of just appropriately funding the postal service?
Trump is rambling rambling

Lol Trump is just saying Republicans are working for all the things they are actively fighting against. He just lies with so little effort it's crazy.
So your telling me that if trump wins again there is a chance that I might get deported
Didn't your team try to sneak in $1.75 billion for a new FBI building to protect Trump's hotel interests and then pretend you had no idea that was in there? Or was that all just a dream? It couldn't be reality, because who would do something that stupid?
Because it has never been big enough for Democrats to steal elections with, until now. The fact that the Trump hating zealots are so anxious to have everything done through mail without any face-to-face verification says everything you need to know about why they want it.

Well. Okay then. I thought for sure they'd hold onto Trump with their cold dead fingers, anything to keep power.

It is really baffling to me. When people I know personally tell me they still like Trump I'm like "Have you heard him speak?" I just don't get it. They must want to watch the world burn.
Trump has no chance heck he shut down Republican primaries because it was possible that he wouldn't even get the Republican nomination and he's the party leader.
Why are Republicans and mostly Trump working so hard for Russia. Isn't he supposed to be the President of the United States instead? #TraitorInChief

So which would look worse for trump. Saving countless lives and suppressing COVID (like nearly every other competent country so far) while temporarily tanking the economy, or letting 150,000+ die while, get this, STILL tanking the economy
If Trump got the chance Moscow Mitch would ramrod it through the Senate on Jan 19th.
Trump is now justifying the deaths of those who have died — many of whom are elderly.  This is sickening to listen to.
This man Trump is using this press conference he called “urgently” to tell us how bad other countries are doing with corona 😂😂 not the usa with 60k new cases a day and 1k deaths, but Japan, Israel and Latam lol no shame ffs
Trump.
Oh, &amp; I'd be remiss if I didn't add that all of this would've been true with or without COVID-19 but COVID-19 pandemic &amp; the historic failure of Trump's gov in handling it (or success, - I still think they partly purposefully let it get this bad) makes this that much more urgent.
A story about Trump's tweet today and why it's illegal and Q&amp;A about it. Thought it might be helpful.
It's sad to see ppl leveraging #HermanCain's death as a means to promote the mast vs. anti-mask debate. This man died, his family is grieving.   I'm pro-mask, anti-Trump and identify as a progressive Democrat.. but man. The left really needs to stop vilifying the right like this.
Sounds like he was extremely stupid to not be wearing a mask during a pandemic then, don't you think? Anyway, Trump's quack doctor said it's a cure so why didn't it work?
Yes &amp; no. Had Trump, Fox News, GOP taken this shit seriously last yr, took the necessary precautions &amp; not politicized the crap out of it &amp; required a mask mandate outside of the home, maybe these idiots who boast about not wearing a mask, wouldn't get sick &amp; die from COVID-19.
I guess I don't see the point of your tweet either? Like Trump is gonna stop acting like a petty dictator because people are settling for biden? Or people who feel disenfranchised by the system are gonna be like "Wow they are being upfront the system sucks I am gonna vote now!"
Til we get Tom Cotton coasting off of racist Republicans' nostalgia for the Trump years? Because that's terrifying. So... hopefully  is up to the task here, because he has a lot of work to do to not only clean up after Trump, but prevent the next one.
Now’s not the time, but you don’t really seem to have a problem with Trump so go ahead and vote third party - that’s a vote that historically helps the incumbent. If you feel this way you should immediately log off and start knocking on doors
Oh a sexist for Trump, how novel.  And you see nothing wrong with the way you just responded, do you, given that you disagree with her. Wonder if your mother and grandmother would approve of you talking to a woman that way?  Don’t kid yourself.

We need to, over the next four years (assuming Trump loses and actually leaves), start passing laws to enshrine our norms surrounding presidents into law. No more running without immediately releasing tax returns. No more being able to run any kind of business while running.
You miss a president who can put lipstick on a pig. Trump is trash, but he’s so dangerous because of your party’s decades long attack on democracy and the feckless Democrats working only for their corporate bosses.
The November election will be an absolute SHAM and I am URGING every Patriotic American who supports President Trump to BOYCOTT the election by refusing to vote.
Cool, vote third party and watch when Biden or Trump is elected
The more powerful the resistance against Trump becomes, the more agitated he becomes, &amp; the more racism he spews! He doesn't deserve to be called "President," he should be referred to as "the impeached President!". That's what he is. Any other Pres. would have been removed by now
It really isn’t. Trump is unhinged and Biden’s not a threat.
as they could have been (and yes, I'm saying that knowing every single awful thing that has happened the last few years) is because Trump is incompetent. Ivanka isn't incompetent. Tom Cotton isn't incompetent. Both are just as fascist but in prettier and more palatable packages.

A related question - did any of them have reputations to uphold before Trump?
“The Catholic Church in the United States has long advocated for the Dreamers and we will continue to stand with them,” said Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles.
Also none of these people said boo when we started locking brown kids up in cages even under Obama, and then when the program expanded to taking away children from their parents under Trump they applauded it.  So, let's not pretend that we haven't always had a fascist undertone.
Every time Trump talks his mouth looks like he's giving someone a blow job.
Well, when you play with fire and everybody that doesn't think exactly like you has been telling you it's fire for *at lest* five years (and Trump didn't come out of the clear blue sky, so that's being real generous).... you're gonna get burned.

are Trump supporters. That leaves a pretty large remainder. Also, given that Trump support is negatively correlated with education, you also eliminate a lot of dumb people by excluding Trump supporters. So it’s a pretty good litmus test.
Let’s do the math. Roughly 26% of registered voters voted for Trump. About 2/3 of that 26% were men, so we’ll say approximately 17% of registered male voters voted for him. Assuming political preference is fairly constant through the populace, that means that 17% of American men

If you're a Trump supporter, and you find this offensive, stupid, and politically damaging to Trump, how about getting at least as angry at him as you are at the people criticizing him over it?
First, they're always inclined to tear down things that Trump is for. But the fact remains that there's a boatload of difference between what Trump says about the drug, and what most studies of it have shown about it.
⁦ ⁦ ⁦ ⁦  Our president is using Russian talking points to justify them putting targets on our troops backs. He’s not defending us against the assassination of Americans! That’s treason! Enough!

It's more about how Trump has over-hyped &amp; over-sold it (as a miracle drug), and how his loyal supporters latch onto such narratives. As I said, I'm for whatever helps, even if it's a little bit &amp; in select cases. So I'm not sure where this notion of me 'dismissing' it came from.
lol. Yep, that's been a Trump excuse since 2015.

WTF????? Trump Gives 1.16 Billion To Bill Gates’s Alliance &amp; Signs Deal With Pfizer for COVID Vaccine
This is a travesty. The Trump administration needs to be put in check by the judicial branch (assuming congress continues to do nothing.)
Because Trump's personally invested in it. If he wasn't, they wouldn't be either. Personally, I haven't been too critical of the drug, because I'm for whatever helps... even if it's a little bit &amp; in select cases. But this "miracle drug" passion people have for it is pretty wild.
So I guess the liberal volunteers making shields with donated supplies and money for all the criminals, I mean liberals, to use when attacking and provoking police and federal agents, I mean peacefully protesting, is all Trump’s doing as well?

Love how all these BLM protestors trying to spread lies and talk shit about Trump but then be doing the same shit they say he has done and somehow it is ok. #Hypocrites  #AllLivesMatters
Also, is giving out the license plate your way of inciting violence against this person? I bet you whined about Trump inciting violence but here you are doing it, smh!  Guess it's ok for you to do it though, right? Hypocrite!
My neighbor across the street is a Trump supporter. So about once a week I leave an  beer on his doorstep to let him know that even wayward minds can still drink excellent beer. #BlackLivesMatter
The lie is that this is all happening within a 4 block radius. 99% of Portland is fine. Just like 99% of Trump supporters have their head up their ass.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
it is not reprehensible to refer to some federal troops as nazis. It is a shame that you support Trump’s use of them basically as his personal stormtroopers. It is not surprising you would attack Marty Coniglio in this manner but it is/you are disgusting.
Putin's Russians don't appear to love him as much as puppet Trump.
⁦ ⁦  you guys want to run that comparison again on how ⁦ would be focused on America’s problems, not golfing like Obama did? I remember getting down to work, not wasting taxpayer dollars, etc etc! REALLY?
Not every trump supporter is racist but all racists are trump supporters. This is disgusting and should be treated as a hate crime to instill violence
Still Trump
Ah, if only it were that easy to vanquish Trump. *sigh* 🤣😂
But it’s a must that our kids and grandkids go back to school? Another “do as I say, not as I do” situation. ⁦ you deserve to lose the presidency as you’re thoughtless and clueless when it comes to empathy! And it’s killing us!
WE are hearing Trump's political advisors talking.  Watch for him to go off-script and see the real Trump.
Trump only promotes his only small phony gold culture.  He is not capable of respect or love.
We are with U!  My wife and I are almost 75 and have voted both parties.  Trump has to go!  VOTE.
A Godless Trump supporter probably shouldn’t tell someone else to repent.
⁦ you’re totally in over your head! You’ve made a mess of the greatest country on earth! You’ve set race relations back and sprung the healing process ahead just by the contempt for your ways! We need healing not division now!
Look I watched these guys during the last election pulling their hair out about a Trump upset! So it’s garbage! Wait and see! Just get out and vote, the outcome is the outcome, but these guys are clueless!! Nate Silver included!
if it’s fair that  blames China for the virus, then America should blame Trump for the prolonged response and excessive unemployment, loss of life and loss of businesses! Pay the people back like you’re saying China should pay us.
Now go into how Epstein and Trump were known to be best friends for quite a few years, and how girls were funneled from Mar-a-lago to Epstein.
Liberal democrats trying to make Trump look bad.  This BS will get worse up until November
Just stop with your "but, Trump" crap.  You're picking a fight over a quick moment that in context doesn't suggest at all what YOU want to bitch about.  He's following the guidance. Trump does not.
Donald Trump is not the center of the universe.  This is about supporting Black lives. Donald Trump getting bent is just a pleasant side effect.
Fauci throws out first pitch in DC. BLM on many jerseys. Trump, a few miles away, is set aside.
I had one tell me yesterday that Trump is actually very pro LGBTQ and is the most accepting president we had. 🥰
Donald Trump doesn’t have dementia; he’s just a moron.
I just want Yamiche to know that I think she is amazing and the job she does standing up to Trump over these years his made my smile so many times.  You keep up the great work!
Seriously though, if Biden really does plan on destroying suburbia, there are better answers than Trump.
The quickest and easiest way for someone to lose my respect is to ask me to lie for them.  Which is why I'm sad to report that I will never hold a cabinet level position in the Trump administration.
Suburban Housewives of America for Trump!!!
There really are people who think their God is demanding they support Trump.
WHY DO they VOTE for this **** ????? 'Gavin Newsom Rages at Trump Discounting Illegals for # of House Reps'  via

Trump lied then, he lies now.
Trump would brag about taking a piss standing, and getting it all in the bowl.
A red alert from Gary Hart: "there is no justification for a president to have dictatorial powers kept secret from Congress, the press and the American people." #TrumpDictatorship #AmericaIsNowAdictatorship
😂😂😂 Trump dick must be pleasing to your tastebuds 🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾
This literally is, right now, trump’s America.
But, but Trump can recognize an elephant!
BUT, Trump proved he can recognize an elephant!
Where's the infrastructure u promised, the wall is not even done, Mexico is NOT paying for the wall, where's your healthcare plan, and the Trump virus is gaining control.  U r a loser.
It has been confirmed that this woman hasn't even been around the Trump family in at least 20 years or more! And she never spent any time with Trump himself even then. She's just trying to make a quick buck! Where was she in 2016 with this story?
But of course Joe is just trying to sooth the racists-who-vote-for-him conscience. Or he truly believes Trump is some sort of aberration and not the direct conclusion of decades of Republican fear mongering and Southern Strategy.
You can't make this stuff up --&gt; "There is significant remorse over letting deficits rise by $9 trillion during the previous economic expansion."
They aren’t defending the use of masks...they’re protesting Trump.  That’s why.
We’ve all gone to bed and woke up again over the last three years to the Left trying to take back America for Obama’s radical anti-American agenda. These anarchists are children of the Left, not Trump’s creations. Get it right.
Donald Trump inviting the Republican with integrity to any Trump property to break them into sycophantic dogs
How the fuck am I gonna get an ad on YouTube for Donald Trump when the video I’m watching is Cornel West talking about the legacy of James Baldwin? What kind of upside algorithm is this 🙄  Dude, I am not your audience in the slightest
I think  needs help. This is actual footage of America now (while Trump is president).
Trump celebrated those states for doing so.
The whole economy shut down for months. 40-million people lost jobs. Travel from China was halted at a time when Biden mocked at the notion. As for existing inequalities, whose fault are those really? You can’t just make Trump a scapegoat for everything you don’t like.
⁦ has problems with women and blacks in power. He said his mom never told him no, therefor powerful women are a threat. He has no respect for blacks or he would’ve been kinder to Obama! He’s a fearful white guy seeking racist support
Who is getting 60% of the pay of white people? Where do you get those numbers from? Also, as for COVID deaths, black Americans are 2.3 times more likely to die of COVID. How is that President Trump’s fault?
