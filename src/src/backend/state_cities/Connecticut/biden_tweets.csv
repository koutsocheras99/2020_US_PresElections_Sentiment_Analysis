Biden is well???
you are not a Christian so don’t even pretend. There is not a picture ANYWHERE of you attending church. Regardless of who I intend to vote for (it isn’t you you disgusting asshat), questioning Biden’s faith is laughable coming from you.
Dems throughout Trump’s presidency: “You guys we need a great candidate to take down Trump in 2020!”  Dems in 2020: “Ladies and Gentlemen, Joe Biden!”  fml  #Election2020
Wow now you are campaigning for Biden!  Interesting.  What are the reasons you believe he’s a “good catholic”? You like to disparage trump but Biden is a “good Catholic “ He supports the mutilization of babies, especially partial birth abortion. I’d like him to denounce abortion.
I heard a report that Biden is excited to find out who he picked for VP
What about Biden’s racist comment?
I think Joe Biden meant filament , which is an element to turn on the light in his head. Lol
Considering it seems her dad and biden seemed fairly close and how kind biden was to her, you'd think she would vote for him. But even someone dumber than a box of rocks who was a sketchy husband is entitled to vote as they wish.
Trump “Biden will hurt God and the Bible “, from the guy who’s has been married 3 times and had a porn star spank his ass 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🌈👊🏻🇵🇷🇺🇸🇨🇦
It is only dangerous to Biden’s election prospects, that is what the media actually means when they call HCQ dangerous. If Trump liked lollipops those would be consideted very dangerous by the media too.
Biden is a pandering old fool, always has been only now he doesn’t even understand what he is pandering to.
Hmmm, Daniel Day Lewis, Hidden Valley Eatery in Washington, CT. But maybe Joe Biden, The Bean Coffeeshop
Obama and Biden administration was corrupt. The amount of money they sent to the Middle East was crazy.
Maybe ask if ⁦ would be willing to get an X-ray for heels spurs too.   *journalist?
Then vote for Biden
Biden has a point. Just because Trump is a doddering fool, doesn’t mean that every candidate needs to now take a cognitive test.
So you think Biden is a better person. The guy can't complete a thought, hasn't done anything in politics for 40+ years.  If you think just having Biden in office is going to fix the shit happening in the US, you are going to be deeply sorry.  When that time comes, don't complain
IF YOU SUPPORT TRUMP... that is your opinion and you are entitled to it.   IF YOU SUPPORT BIDEN... that is your opinion and you are entitled to it.  Stop name calling random people bc of their beliefs. You’re just spreading the hate. Focus on the real problems around you first.
People are ridiculous they gettin on Joe Biden because of what he said about the test and Coke! well let me tell you something Trump ruined this country Trump helped  COVID-19 to spread Trump didn’t open those emails and nobody’s talking about that and he’s the one in office 🙄
Biden continues to stay in the basement! He will not even go on Chris Wallace show! Scary!
This was the last question on the cognitive test, it’s the hardest, I got all the colors right. Lets see Biden do that
Also did you even take the time to read the article? It’s people selling Trump merchandise outside rallies &amp; not in his control. I can buy a Biden T-shirt made in China too. Like I said, Trump merchandise sold on his website is made in America.
Anyone see Dana Perino's soft ball interview with Jill Biden? What side is she on anyway? Why didn't she ask her where Joe was? Still hiding in his basement trying to hide his dementia?
Or Biden is leaning towards Harris and the Alterkackers Dodd and Rendell are trying to scuttle that decision with back channel leaks.
Kayne West is trying to take votes away from Joe Biden by making a 57 yr old white woman his running mate for VP. I’m not sure if Kayne can even spell President, but he’s balloted in a few southern states. Let get this joker out during these bipolar outbursts. He needs some help
What would happen if vice president biden got sick and passed without picking a running mate would Democrat part forfeit elections
Ppl don't vote policy, they vote identity. JB got the nod on the hook of electability, not policy. In fact, his entire campaign was built on nostalgia. "I'll restore the good old days."   I doubt most voters could name a Biden policy, let be alone tell you its substance.
Now taking bets that Trump will not attend Biden's inauguration.
One thing the polls show is Trump running BEHIND Biden and AHEAD of most Congressional Republicans. Certainly a scenario like this is possible, but the leverage should be write the best bill.
Biden crime family!

My guess is  that once Biden picks his VP #Harris Trump will drop Pence 🌈🇺🇸🇵🇷🇨🇦
Sandernistas: Biden must adopt M4A, ban cars, end the police and make Nina Turner his Veep in order to win the youth vote.   Trump: I’m banning TikTok.
They already baked in a Biden win. Oddly enough Elections are non issue
Right. Obama chose JB because he wasn't competing for the top job. He was nearly invisible for 8 years. When he did pop up, he was promoting chained CPI &amp; other undesireable programs. What does she do if President Biden goes that way again?  President Harris is fine w/ me.
She has a great shot at 2024 whether or not she's VP. If the Biden admin shits the bed, whoever is VP is going into early retirement. There's risk in tieing her career to that old man.
Here’s a shortlist of three. (I could find many more if I looked closer.)  1) Your advocacy on #FreeGrace   2) Your special ed career/vocation choice (makes you a hero every day)  3) Your donation to Joe Biden campaign 👏  *Aside: I found you via Kathy Flaherty
I think #Trump takes all the campaign money, stuffs it in mattress then calls it quits.   Trump Halts TV Advertising as He Struggles in Polls Against Biden
Biden's entire Senate career was defined by support for conservative causes like opposition to bussing, cutting social security, balanced budget, harsh penal system, Patriot Act.   FDR was nothing like that. He had what used to called a sense of noblesse oblige. FWIW.
I hear you, I just see a lot of people praising Obama when they shouldn't and I fear that it could lead to people not holding anyone who isn't Trump accountable in the future. Mad I have to vote Biden, but I will vote for him nevertheless
Biden is creepy. But I'd vote for mickey mouse at this point. Anyone but trump.
You must be blind or something because clearly China sent the virus over and if Obama Biden has the stock pile full we wouldn’t have been in this mess also George Floyd has nothing to do with trump also blm is a horrible bunch of terroist
Biden’s Braun is shot
Joe Biden is gone in the head
Biden thinks we’re in 2024!
Not me and not the world Biden is shot his brain is gone he won’t be running anything they will have people behind him running this country we need one leader that’s trump
Trump did something for our country he created the most jobs of any other president he stood up to China when joes son hunter went missing because they stole money millions from other countries Biden had 1 million black kids killed when he was in office
Not me Biden killed millions of black kids in the inner city he locked them all up and took them away from there families all the wild he’s collecting 80 million for his son in other countries
Listen Biden already did 50 years and got nothing done he’s to old he will be controlled in the office also tell his voters that he had 1 million black kids locked up when he was in office tell his voters the truth we need the truth tell BIDENS voters that he blew billions
People better do there homework on Biden because he locked millions of black men up when he was in office
Wrong wake up man come on do you see what these democrats are doing before COVID 19 trump had the best economy in history better then any president ever then COVID a fake virus is made up by the democrats they tried 5 times to impeach trump didn’t work Biden son where is he
Omg I pray every night that trump wins because if not we are fucked we are gonna be fucked if Biden gets in
You need to grow a brain dude it’s very clear that the democrats want power and they want to ruin this country mark my words if Biden gets in your gonna pray for trump to come backHas Joe Biden ever had sex with anyone older than 12?? Serious question though. I heard he never even touched his wife. Someone get back to me ASAP. #biden #Trump2020 #BeirutBlast #Pedowood
Yeah for sure, exactly the case.  It’s why Biden has ads in Miami with a Cuban voiceover, in LA with a Mexican voiceover, in NY with a Puerto Rican voiceover, etc. The electorate is more culturally and politically diverse
Seems to?  Why is the MSM giving Biden cover?
Biden would be to China like PM Chamberlain was to Germany just before WWII started
#BreakingNews: New York Gov Andrew Cuomo announced he would allow children STATEWIDE to return to classrooms this fall, citing NY’s “success” in battling the COVID19 pandemic.  Will de Blasio go along?  Note: they “can revisit” the plan if DNC &amp; Biden's campaign will so decide 🤭
Those folks aren’t his voters so they don’t matter. Biden’s religion is politics, power and money.
I actually just learned something lately that has me locked in on Biden. I don’t really like him, but apparently whoever wins the state gets all the votes from people who vote independent. So like as much as I wanna vote libertarian it can literally give trump a vote :/
But it’s OK for your campaign to illegally assist Kanye in getting on state ballots to siphon votes away from Joe Biden. “Using” black voters to help you rig the election? Talk about not worthy.

I'm going to begrudgingly vote for Biden while complaining about Biden. To me he's basically a brainless husk, but I think that's an upgrade still.
Trump about Biden “he’s against god and guns”. It seems those two words shouldn’t be in the same sentence unless you move the position of the word against: God against guns.

Potential Biden VP Has Major Problems, Including Her Son Being a Massive Trump Supporter
As a fan of yours from the left (as you usually give me an opposing viewpoint that is well thought-out) I'm shaking my head. Your writing in Mickey Mouse if Biden picks Rice (obviously you're not a fan ... but no explanation to boot) is a bit crazy.
Just putting this out there. Anyone who votes for trump or DOESNT vote for Biden is a POS for life.
Imagine actually believing that Trump is mentally fit and Biden isn’t lol  Trump just said “it is what it is” to over now 160,000 people dying and said he should get credit for deaths being down when there were 2000 deaths TODAY.  Imagine thinking that isn’t true mental illness.
I'd rather have Biden gaffes then Trump lies
Why do I think Trump is as dumb as a rock and dangerously out of whack? He said Biden wants to "hurt the bible, hurt God. "
My hubby said he should leave now pence will pardon him for federal portion and to save country he can meet with ny ag and make some sort of deal! He does not realize how many people are fed up! loads of my Republican friends voting for biden are going in person!
If Biden were in a coma I would vote for him. It's not about Joe. It's about getting rid of the worst blot in the history of our great country

Yes. I am following #Yang's lead and supporting #Biden to get rid of Trump. That's priority number 1.
I’m not the religious person I used to be, but when Donald Trump is voted out this year, Biden’s inaugural song should be “Oh Happy Day.”“Biden has permitted his League of Mediocre White Men to run around dinging up a group of trailblazing female politicians, most of them Black, all of whom have plied paths unimaginably more challenging than any taken by these men” ⁦⁦
21. No one knows if running mates matter, but an argument about Harris as Biden’s running mate is a good argument. To pick Harris to to say to the Democratic base: yes, *it can happen here*.
20. That’s voting for someone who will have no impact, which means Cupp’s opposition to Trump isn’t serious, which means a column about how much depends on Biden’s pick is just striking a pose.
17. Making Cupp’s thesis more absurd: Writing in a candidate is throwing her vote away, which means Biden is the only choice, no matter who his VP pick, if she really means it when she says she’s “sick of all the crap”:
16. They are voting *against* Trump, which means Biden himself is a secondary thought, which means his running mate is a tertiary thought—if they’re thinking about vice presidents at all, which is unlikely.
15. This goes double this year, because many Americans who say they are voting for Biden aren’t really voting *for* Biden.
13. Alas, Cupp doesn’t go there. Instead, she leans into the false thesis of needing a good reason to vote for Biden, as if nearly four years of authoritarianism, corruption, madness and treason were not enough.
11. SEC: For moderates like me who are looking for reasons to vote for Biden, we need to know who’s on that ticket, and soon. I’m hoping, for the sake of the country, he chooses someone I can support.”
10. SEC: “As a staunch conservative who has voted Republican in past elections, I don’t take this lightly. I don’t agree with everything that Biden supports, nor am I 100 percent comfortable with the direction he wants to take the country. …
9. In her latest, she said the choice between voting for Biden and a write-in candidate (she’s against Trump) depends on Biden’s choice of a running mate.
5. NG: He wants to create fear, uncertainty and doubt so that people feel frozen and paralyzed, and then the man of action, Trump himself, can ride in and seize the day.”
2. We are entering a dangerous period fraught with instability and apprehension as well as potential for violence and bloodshed. Donald Trump is most likely to contest anything that’s short of a landslide for Joe Biden.
This is a terrible and inaccurate understanding of Biden’s strength at the top of the ticket

All criticism Doesn’t go out the door once a candidate is the presumptive nominee. Biden is going to have horrible moments. And I’d rather have the flood of critiques coming from people pushing good policy, than those solely comparing the mental statuses of two seniors.

Wow.  Joe Biden is clearly very strong.
I'm  latino and I agree. We have different values andcways to see things depending where we come from. I do not see why this statement is controversial. As a bilingual school yeacher, we have to apply what Biden said to the classroom. What's wrong  with that?

If Biden wins, my fascism warnings will get worse actually.
This is who Joe Biden’s running mate should be.  She is a VERY highly respected woman who can effectively make the case for why a new president should be elected.  Plus she would do well debating Mike Pence.  Also, Trump will have a hard time with speaking negatively about her.
And, for that matter, center-right deficit anxiety: There are columns that I wrote in 2010 and 2011 that I would not write about Biden deficits, unless underlying inflationary conditions change.
Not that there won't be worried centrist press releases about deficits during a Biden presidency. But the intensity of centrist/center-left deficit anxiety in 2010-2012 seems unlikely to return, unless inflation does.
Even if this is true (and I’m skeptical), this is all the more reason to vote for Biden. We know from Trump’s behavior that he would use a vaccine as leverage to reward states that bow down to him, punish ones that don’t, and no doubt would find a way to profit from both.
Here's that piece.
If Biden chooses differently than Obama (who closed books on torture), he’ll face dilemmas about “transitional justice” from elsewhere, including avoiding (appearance of) politics by other means and risk of escalation rather than healing. Important piece.
Boring Biden has nothing to say and he certainly can't even articulate what he just had for breakfast.  He's a boor. Of course he won't debate you.  You need to provoke him so he gets pissed enough to WANT to debate you.    cc:

What's so genius is the Biden Campaign is tapping into the same nostalgia that Trump does for the mid-20th century, when American manufacturing reigned supreme, union jobs prevailed.   But instead of making this nostalgia retrograde, he's making it forward thinking, progressive.
Expect this but hope for the best.

Pete and Amy saw the strength of Biden’s performance in SC and recognized they had no path to the nomination.   They understood a consolidation of moderates was the only way to stop a Progressive takeover.   They were right.   And it worked.   🤷🏽‍♀️
Does Biden ever intend to pick a VP?

Just so I understand...we’ve spent three years hearing that using unvetted, raw intel to investigate a presidential candidate is a “coup,” but...that is exactly what  is doing with Biden? These people are such a joke

I wonder who really wrote this. Sure as heck wasn't ole creepy sleepy fumblin bumblin Joe Biden.
Really? After three years of incompetence and sheer madness, you still think Biden’s pick would change your mind and you’d go and not vote for Biden or even vote for trump? I am convinced republicans are the worst.
Spin it spin it like we are 6 years old and are treated as such. Biden is a moron and every body knows it. But, they are going to vote for him anyway. That is the reason this country is in the situation it is, we have dumb voters incapable of making an intelligent decision.

You should 100% vote for who you want to vote for. I understand &amp; respect that. I do. All I’m saying is the cold reality is that person will not win this election if it’s not Biden or Trump. And if you’re not a hardcore Republican voter, that vote will favor Trump.

False. Voting is not a privilege, it’s a right.   Vote for whoever you want, but a vote for a 3rd party is absolutely a vote for trump (that’s how we ended up with George W. Bush).   Biden ain’t perfect, but compare that gaff to the thousands of Trump comments over the years.

Where is the transcript? So sick of R’s trying to say Biden is struggling mentally when this moron just spews word salad after word salad and the media treats it as if it’s normal for a president to speak this way.
I cannot understand the dissonance of the messaging from the Trump campaign. On one hand they say Joe Biden is mentally incompetent and in his basement hiding? On the other hand they say he is a uniquely powerful man that will bring about a communist revolution and murder god?
I don't think Biden has led in a single quality poll of Iowa. It's absolutely within reach but I also think it's lean R right now. I agree on Arizona

Boy, Biden is going to have tons and tons of shit to clean up!
According to Joe Biden..... the Latino  community is very diverse... but Black ppl?? Not so much. 🤔
Can u interpret this for me.....
Wtf was the question??
Please let there be a transcript. I am so tired of the Trumpalos claiming that Biden doesn’t want to debate Trump because it will show his mental deterioration.
So let me get this straight, you want Joe Biden if he wins to dismantle the NRA? The only organization that fights for your Second Amendment right whether you use it or not it is your right. So sad and so misguided

Even if that were true, there is no reason that Biden had to gain all those voters of people who dropped out except Bernie chose not to compete for them. That was a conscious choice.
That's because our 2 choices are Trump and Biden...no one's voting for  but I don't think it's too much of a stretch to say that America earned this very spot it's currently in right now

This elections funny bc every time trump says something that makes me think shit maybe I should vote for Biden, he does something just as ridiculous. It’s like they’re competing for who’s worse
Thankfully, Joe Biden is not our only choice when it comes to voting against Trump.  I'm sick and tired of voting for what the party that doesn't represent its people chose for us.  I'm not going to be a part of their game. My votes will represent me.

You must be one of the woke ppl. Nobody is scared of you. Trump would destroy you and Biden would grope you. No one believes they are scared of you.  is scared to debate Trump. As an independent I do give you respect for trying Good luck with that. 😉
Guy,   Have you learned nothing.  The media and Dems spent 3 years on Russian Collusion when they knew Hillary paid for the dossier.   Concocting a reason to skip debate is child’s play.   Biden will not debate.   Bank on it.
Last point - didn’t Biden’s law cause millions of Black and Latino men to be put in prison while Trump’s Executive Actions and bills provided them relief from jail? Yes - Biden has a long history to examine. Which “alternative” fact do you want to challenge. Problem is you can’t!
I wish you were correct.  Mark this response....please.   However, there is zero chance Biden will debate.
Yeah he won't leave the whige house when biden wins.    This will be a SHIT SHOW
Heard Petrine on Fox this am. She said Biden would like an additional debate! Right! Biden can’t handle interview! We r not naive.
Most nominees wait until week of convention to name someone. Just because the media is going non-stop trying to guess who it will be doesn’t mean Biden can’t make a decision. In fact, Trump picked Pence on 7/15/16. Pence formally accepted at convention on 7/19/16. #factsmatter
you never argue substance and as usual go for personal. Tell me how Biden has achieved anything in 47 years. Maybe the millions of black kids in prison? Maybe making Anita Hill feel like shit? Maybe not wanting to go after Ben Ladin. Exactly what has he done? Sniff hair?
i have seen biden chocolate though jesse, in massachusetts.. i said "what, no trump candy?" girl says "trumps candy sells out fast." 😆

Honey ! Trump says that Joe Biden is going to wreck America- open up your eyes and see the America we live in now... that is Trumpy’s BS and our tax dollars are paying for it.
If Senile Joe is elected, Jill Biden will be the de facto President.
We won’t know if he is mentally deficient until he actually comes out of hiding. Once he announces his Vice President pick we will need to compare that person to Trump as I don’t think Biden will be on the ballot after his first debate  - unless MSNBC is picking the moderators.
I feel generally gaslighted, but not just by the media. Most leftists on here will call Biden out on policy, but won't mention that his mental functioning is clearly far too damaged to be President too. I feel like I'm the only one who has seen videos of Biden trying to speak.
Bernie is super focused on his base. It's why you all love him so much and why he raised so much money. But It's not enough people to win a Dem primary.   Bernie voters loving Bernie more than Biden voters love Biden doesn't count for anything in the end. It's all just one vote
If I were Biden I would not appear on the same stage as Trump for any reason under any circumstances.  It’s a losing proposition and an embarrassment
Wait why wold Biden supporters go see you lol
I know math is hard for Trump but the virus is here whether you test for it or not... Trump couldn't control the spread of coronavirus but Biden will.
WHAT THE F*CK DO WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS BIDEN PUPPET. AND YOU WONT CALL OUT HER LIES. PROGRESSIVE IS A COVER FOR MARXISM. SHUT HER DOWN
Hopefully Trump has a plan for dealing with this. He can’t debate Biden the same way as Crooked. I actually think it will be harder because how can you have snappy comebacks when everything out of Biden’s mouth sounds like he just came from Pelosi’s vodka buffet.
The aggressive stance the left has had towards Biden has been very good for the Biden camp long term. He is as immune as one can be to charges he's under the control of the "radical left"
The failure of Trumpism will be delivering Biden. If he can’t beat a weak, loser candidate like that as an incumbent - how pathetic can one be? He might win, in which case I’ll salute. But if not - it is pathetic.
There will be more than 0.9% third-party votes. I see it being something like Biden 52.5, Trump 44.5, 3% TP. It could rupture for Trump and bump Joe up to 54-42.5-3.5.
With Biden clearly in dementia mode his VP pick is huge as there is an actual chance they end up being POTUS. Picking a ghoul like Harris will be a terrible decision.
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Praying for that day! The scary thing is how much racism his presidency exposed. How do people justify voting for a man endorsed by David Duke? Or rather, endorsed by him AGAIN? Maybe naive, but I didn’t see it coming in 2016, fingers crossed for Biden!
There won’t ever be a President Biden!
I'm extremely concerned that the "next Trump" is likely to be worse than this one after a Biden Presidency. But I indeed will feel slightly less short-term dread if Biden wins. None of this allows me personally to vote within my morals for either rapist.
Don’t agree what polls saying, I’m pretty shocked Biden has 10+% in Florida and Arizona on Trump
I can’t help but wonder if Biden will be forced to step aside in favor of a new nominee.
We clearly agree Trump must be denied a second term. Biden is a rapist who is unable to speak coherently due to multiple brain surgeries. After a debate, his polls will collapse and he will lose. We must replace Biden to defeat Trump. There is no other choice.
Biden's phrase for implementing Soviet style government in America is "Build Back Better."  Who defines "an equal chance?" or "getting ahead?" Who decides what's fair? BIDEN IS OFFICIALLY ANTI-AMERICAN. No Trump Tweet has been or could be as ugly or hateful as this one.
Time to join Team Biden - join up here -
VP candidates are no better than Biden!! HORRIFIC ! What a Mess! You’ll need all the luck u can get
Philippe Reines said that Trump would be Bidens age if he gets reelected in his second term. TRUMP is Clear of mind and showing his wit. BIDEN is not clear now, and if he becomes president other people will be making decision for him. We can't compare the two at all.
Right-wing pollster for Trumpers desperate for good news. You believe one poll and think dozens of others are fake news? You’re deluding yourselves and it has nothing to do with 2016. Biden has bigger and more consistent leads than Hillary ever did.
I don't get much that  would ever agree to work with the warmonging serial womanizer corporatist Biden. I'm still holding out that something might happen to Biden, which would give Bernie the nomination at the DNC convention. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Who would be Biden’s worst pick for VP? 🤔 I think Hilary Clinton.
When did Biden say he was for medicare for all? He said even if it became a bill he would veto it. and he did say he would give more funding to police.
AOC is dreaming of the day when she can manipulate President Senile Joe Biden into imposing a full Marxist agenda in the United States.
I want Trump defeated too, so I m advocating haed for replacing Biden or voting for Howie. If enough of us voted for Howie, he'd win.
Yeah. That may be true, but I just have moral limits. There were *many* Dem candidates I could have voted for. Biden is a rare person whom I can't even vote for against Trump.
Defeating Trump could occur more reliability and honestly by the DNC having the sense to replace Biden. "Shut up progressives" is a horrible strategy that will result in Trump winning again
While I would love Bernie, there are many people sound of mind and not a rapist for whom I *could* vote against Trump. Biden does not fit that description. Why the heck would the DNC stay with his nomination and risk losing to Trump because their candidate is not mentally ok?
Is he breathing? Then yes. And of course Biden is going to debate him. Perfect way to demonstrate presidential behavior vs clown show.

3 people who spoke anonymously to discuss the plans said a public announcement likely wouldn't happen before the week of Aug. 10. That's one week before Democrats will hold their convention to officially nominate Biden as their presidential nominee.
except it won’t... if Biden was gonna rock with the policies he would have adopted them by now.   also, Bernie doesn’t have policies, he screams shit that he thinks young folks would like then vanishes when people ask “how do you plan to make that happen?”
He should be Biden’s National Security Advisor. I just read Colonel Vindman’s Wikipedia page, the details suggest he’s got the background for the job. 🤔

Why arent you voting for Biden then? Since so many of the hard Berners claim he's no differant than Trump?

Many of the leaks and articles about Harris have really not shown the Biden camp in a good light. The implications that Harris wasn't allowed to fully compete or hasn't shown enough deference come off as sexist to me too.   I'm surprised Biden hasn't shut this down.
This is not a good look for Biden
All the frantic anti-Harris leaks and articles of the last three days has made me think Biden has either settled on her or is very nearly there

Donald Trump, serial adulterer, whoremonger, chronic liar, says Joe Biden is 'against God.'
Everything that Biden has said he would have done would have led to many more deaths.
There is absolutely no need for Joe Biden to “clarify” all of his racist comments over the past 50 years. They are all quite succinct and to the point.

Why do I think Trump is as dumb as a rock and dangerously out of whack? He said Biden wants to "hurt the bible, hurt God. "

This man is mentally ill &amp; in the middle of a manic episode. The fact that Republicans are using him to try and take votes from Biden is disgusting.  The fact that they think the black community will fall for this act shows how little they care or respect this community.
Democrats don’t see anything wrong with Biden’s OBVIOUS mental state. Republicans do. I find that interesting as hell.

Juan, You’re an intelligent man. You must know the Dems are just trying to create chaos. We all do. Biden is a prop and the VP candidates are laughable - not to say SCARY.
It feels like #Biden is going to choose a #Black woman VP just because she's black and a woman.  No bueno.
Let me pose this question ... if Joe Biden was your father would you make him go to the DMV to get re tested for his drivers license?
I wonder which presidential candidate had a policy and opinion on this? 🤔  That guy had so much gold in his ideas! Too bad America missed out and we have to now go with #Biden and some random woman VP. Not voting trump, but not happy wit Biden.
Just in the state that Biden is in... the state of confusion
Joe Biden went to John Lewis’s funeral.
Millions are unhappy. You can continue to back Sanders , vote trump or find a hobby. I'm not a big fan of Biden fan but I'm choosing to dump the Russian asset , outright racist, &amp; domestic terrorist in the Oval office.

Right after Vindman stands on the platform at the Capitol for Biden’s swearing in.
Trump is a reality-phony, paradox intended. So, Biden shouldn’t debate until Trump grants us all 3 wishes. Make it a game show. No debate until he, say, releases his taxes, his physical results and doesn’t tweet for a week. If he does it, debate. But only then.
i can live with an old-school Biden/Team Biden so i hope you are correct. don't kill the stock market. don't over-tax me. keep military strong. sensible gun control. you can reform the police but i think BLM group is a scam. Antifa needs an ass kicking.
I think Trump would be extremely naive to trust Zuckerberg; amoral != immoral, if Biden wins then come January it'll be a whole different Facebook.
what i think: Biden is in serious mental decline and being propped up by the "establishment". within a year he will step down due to his struggles. I hope his backers can hold off the far left
Vote for Joe Biden if you think the police are a nuisance that you’d rather not have to deal with.
Chip off the old block. Joe Biden is a looker.   Young #JoeBiden
I think you spell it Trump .... I see you spelled it wrong a couple times. It’s the same as if I spelled it bIDen. Kinda weird, right? Just being helpful .... in case you have your 2nd grade spelling test soon
Vote for Joe Biden if you want more government intrusion, more government meddling, more government regulations, and more government taxation.

#JoeBiden must be elected in November.   3 Big Ways Social Security Could Change With a Biden Presidency
Agree. I haven’t doven deep, but from afar, a Biden-Harris ticket feels strong. He could use a strong woman to bolster his slight old-man-feeble image.  Warren also fits this bill.
Presidents by and large don’t create jobs. Unemployment is largely dependent on the business cycle, which operates pretty darn independently of fiscal and monetary policy. But even if you think presidents do create jobs, then Biden and Obama “created” even more than Trump.
FOS is an abbreviation for Biden.
Biden would KNOCK trump’s SOCKS OFF if we had a debate like this ...

serious question .... besides Trump bad .... what policies by Biden/Dems should get my support? you guys are asking me to vote Dem and i want to know why
what do you mean .... he is against Joe Biden, right?
SoS is a governing partner too, though - one who in all likelihood would spend just as much time with Biden as the VP, if not more - and in a specific area where we badly need strong leadership.

We need adding the #EqualRightsAmendment to the Constitution front &amp; center. Why wasn’t the #28th mentioned?  38 States have ratified #ERA certification is being blocked -   With #ERA Biden would be 1st president of a Democracy that includes all citizens -
would be better as Treasury Sec. Too white and too close in age to Biden. My fav VP picks - Demming and Rice.
This is how it's gonna be - and worse, all the way through Biden's inauguration.  Buckle up, donate, volunteer and make sure EVERYONE you know is registered and ready to vote (however they can).  Respond with action.  #vote
Exactly!  I got a good chuckle when Trump gave the same answer he gave to HRC in 2015 -- We'll see what happens.  If there are enough idiots to vote for Biden this country is doomed.
The more I see of Joe Biden the more I anticipate they pull him not to far before the election, Trumps team has little time to prepare and they think it throws him off

Miami-Dade is going to screw up their absentee ballots in some disastrous way like they always do and Biden will end up losing Florida by 700 votes, best not to rely too heavily on that.I just Googled about Biden’s stance on the police.    Here’s an article for consideration:

So it's okay for you to laughingly block judges but whine like a baby when the Dem's block you..FU!  Mitch McConnell laughs about stopping Obama hiring judges, allowing Trump to fill courts with conservatives
Ummm..Have you seen your Papa Trumps last few interviews??? 🥴 Seriously Junior...People in glass house’s...Fyi- Biden would kill Trump in any debate. He’s been in way over his head since he entered the WH doors. Trust me, we’re all dying to see it!
I think that request is 100% up to Biden. If he does right by us...He’d be okay. Of course Id elect an eggplant over Trump at this point!

This is a gross statement. Biden’s policies aren’t that different than trumps he’s just more “civilized”. I’ll vote to remove trump but then I’ll support progressives to remove Biden.
Yeah all trump does is turn the nightly coronavirus update into a campaign speech. Oh and bash Biden too!
No. Biden doesn't 'need' them in order to win. Not that you asked but I think if there are any debates, they should be held in an empty studio with just the moderators, crew, candidates, and fact-checkers. However, until Trump releases his tax returns NO debates.

21. No one knows if running mates matter, but an argument about Harris as Biden’s running mate is a good argument. To pick Harris to to say to the Democratic base: yes, *it can happen here*.
20. That’s voting for someone who will have no impact, which means Cupp’s opposition to Trump isn’t serious, which means a column about how much depends on Biden’s pick is just striking a pose.
17. Making Cupp’s thesis more absurd: Writing in a candidate is throwing her vote away, which means Biden is the only choice, no matter who his VP pick, if she really means it when she says she’s “sick of all the crap”:
16. They are voting *against* Trump, which means Biden himself is a secondary thought, which means his running mate is a tertiary thought—if they’re thinking about vice presidents at all, which is unlikely.
15. This goes double this year, because many Americans who say they are voting for Biden aren’t really voting *for* Biden.
13. Alas, Cupp doesn’t go there. Instead, she leans into the false thesis of needing a good reason to vote for Biden, as if nearly four years of authoritarianism, corruption, madness and treason were not enough.
11. SEC: For moderates like me who are looking for reasons to vote for Biden, we need to know who’s on that ticket, and soon. I’m hoping, for the sake of the country, he chooses someone I can support.”
10. SEC: “As a staunch conservative who has voted Republican in past elections, I don’t take this lightly. I don’t agree with everything that Biden supports, nor am I 100 percent comfortable with the direction he wants to take the country. …
9. In her latest, she said the choice between voting for Biden and a write-in candidate (she’s against Trump) depends on Biden’s choice of a running mate.
5. NG: He wants to create fear, uncertainty and doubt so that people feel frozen and paralyzed, and then the man of action, Trump himself, can ride in and seize the day.”
2. We are entering a dangerous period fraught with instability and apprehension as well as potential for violence and bloodshed. Donald Trump is most likely to contest anything that’s short of a landslide for Joe Biden.
This is a terrible and inaccurate understanding of Biden’s strength at the top of the ticket
94 Crime Bill’s Three Strikes law at work. Thanks Joe Biden.
Stunning. Someone told me, even on his campaign website, Trump offers absolutely nothing specific he wants to do or any reason why he wants a 2nd term. Just "Im great, give me $, vote for me." I checked. Yup.  Meanwhile, Biden's website explains what he wants to do on 45 issues.

I really don't understand this weird theory that it's bad somehow for the Vice President to have presidential ambitions.   That would be news to Harry Truman, Henry Wallace, Lyndon Johnson, Hubert H. Humphrey, Estes Kefauver, Walter Mondale, Al Gore, and of course Joe Biden.

Remarkable that Trump somehow has the credibility among his followers to criticize Biden's faith and belief in God?  Its akin to watching Stalin lecture Eisenhower about democracy.  The hubris is hard to fathom.  The enabling by his supports - impossible to swallow.
When Trump states that a Biden presidency will “hurt the Bible, hurt God,” just know that it’s a performative Bible and a Christian nationalist God
Never said he wasn’t there just said that Biden has been hiding 🤷🏻‍♂️

Biden hiring the Republican daughter of a Contra for Latino outreach is pretty much exactly what I’ve come to expect.
It just won’t stick.   Too many people feel like they know Biden and know he’s not a “radical Leftist out to hurt God”.
Sorry. By "optimistic," I meant that Trump would agree to give up power. I don't think he will. I don't think he'll recognize a Biden win even if it's a landslide.
And Trump’s only line of attack against Biden is that he’ll “hurt the Bible and hurt God”?  Yeah, Trump’s flailing in his attempts to run against Biden.  He was primed for Bernie or Liz.

This is what the real Joe Biden looks like without the Botox, the false teeth, the hair plugs and contact lenses:
All criticism Doesn’t go out the door once a candidate is the presumptive nominee. Biden is going to have horrible moments. And I’d rather have the flood of critiques coming from people pushing good policy, than those solely comparing the mental statuses of two seniors.

I know what is wrong. Biden said it. I guess that what Trump said: Puerto Ricans  are the worst Mexicans and Mexicans are rapist, is Ok. Nothing about how different cultures see things differeny. Got it!
Wow.  Joe Biden is clearly very strong.
I'm  latino and I agree. We have different values andcways to see things depending where we come from. I do not see why this statement is controversial. As a bilingual school yeacher, we have to apply what Biden said to the classroom. What's wrong  with that?
And so it starts...Biden can't talk in coherent full sentences so now it is time to nit pick Trump mispronunciations. It doesn't work. Biden is way far ahead.

Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand In The Way Of A Trump Prosecution : NPR
So much for “honesty is the best policy” from this president and his team.
I think there are now genuine forces within the Republican Party that see what the possibilities are. If Biden gives us another 4 years of feeding the banks and pointless wars...
If Biden wins, my fascism warnings will get worse actually.
This is who Joe Biden’s running mate should be.  She is a VERY highly respected woman who can effectively make the case for why a new president should be elected.  Plus she would do well debating Mike Pence.  Also, Trump will have a hard time with speaking negatively about her.
And, for that matter, center-right deficit anxiety: There are columns that I wrote in 2010 and 2011 that I would not write about Biden deficits, unless underlying inflationary conditions change.
Not that there won't be worried centrist press releases about deficits during a Biden presidency. But the intensity of centrist/center-left deficit anxiety in 2010-2012 seems unlikely to return, unless inflation does.
Even if this is true (and I’m skeptical), this is all the more reason to vote for Biden. We know from Trump’s behavior that he would use a vaccine as leverage to reward states that bow down to him, punish ones that don’t, and no doubt would find a way to profit from both.
Here's that piece.
Pelosi and Biden must have done media training together.  They just babble and make little sense.  All that plastic surgery seems to tugged too hard on her brain.
If Biden chooses differently than Obama (who closed books on torture), he’ll face dilemmas about “transitional justice” from elsewhere, including avoiding (appearance of) politics by other means and risk of escalation rather than healing. Important piece.
Boring Biden has nothing to say and he certainly can't even articulate what he just had for breakfast.  He's a boor. Of course he won't debate you.  You need to provoke him so he gets pissed enough to WANT to debate you.    cc:
Watching Twitter Blue Checkmarks' reaction to the Biden Corvette video is a good barometer of who Democrats should never listen to again.   From their perspective, Americans hate driving to the beach, ice cream, baseball on a hot summer day.  What Americans DO love is Socialism.

If you want to sell a #GreenNewDeal to Boomer Dads in Allentown, Sandusky, Sheboygan, and Pontiac, Michigan, this is the way to do it.   Joe Biden isn't running to confiscate your muscle car, make you ride the bus. He wants to build an electric Corvette Stingray with union labor.
What's so genius is the Biden Campaign is tapping into the same nostalgia that Trump does for the mid-20th century, when American manufacturing reigned supreme, union jobs prevailed.   But instead of making this nostalgia retrograde, he's making it forward thinking, progressive.
Expect this but hope for the best.
Agree 100%.

Joe Biden is the clueless one sorry but I don’t care for either one but my vote gotta go with trump
I wondered the same thing, too. It was a disaster and a gift to Joe Biden. But I started reading the responses if his supporters and these people are too stupid to be ashamed. They thought he kicked ass. He did: his own!
Too early to vote for Biden...  dont matter regardless
If Biden needs a hand, it's not on foreign policy. He needs a boost from someone who can help him speak to a younger, hipper crowd on race, gender, criminal justice issues.    He needs help to make the case that voting for the Democratic ticket is forward thinking - cool, even.
RUSH: Ask yourself, if Trump had answered this question of a black reporter, "Are you a junkie, you take cocaine before you come in to talk to me?" can you imagine?
If it came down to a choice between Harris and Rice, then I would vote Harris.   Susan Rice doesn't have experience in elected office. And it's hard to argue the 2020 election will be based on foreign policy, or that Biden is weak on nat sec experience.

My Election prediction. In Blue States that HRC won in 2016, Biden will win with a Total of 75+M Nationwide Votes, Trump will win Same States he won in 2016 with .005% lead &amp; again 62.5M Nationwide Votes, &amp; he wins with the EC. Voters will turn out, but Red States Surpress/Cheat.

Republicans have a clear favorite for Biden’s running mate
It is already in Play, Payoffs have been paid to Election Officials in key areas, all Trump has to do is win the same States as 2016 by the same % or even .05% to get the EC. Biden could mathematically get 100+M Votes in same States as HRC &amp; Lose to 63M Votes for Trump, bc of EC!

I'm starting to think that the whole 🌹 Twitter "bIDeN hAS dEmeNTiA" talking point  originated due to Trump's inner circle realizing that their candidate was exhibiting cognitive decline.   So naturally they had The Intercept circulate this rumor about Biden in March&gt;April 2020.

How detached from reality do you have to be to think that you have done more for Black Americans than John Lewis, especially if you’re Donald Trump???   And y’all question Biden’s cognitive state! Smh...
Sure is and Biden can be counted on to appoint the same kind of Corporate-loving, Wall Street-worshipping, Billionaire Class sycophants as Trump. Probably even some of the same people.
Just a reminder that if Joe Biden said this, GOP would already have a caravan playing the tape over and over again on loudspeakers. But for Trump, this becomes fake news.
I rather have a player kneel for his beliefs, than have a president of the U.S. having service men killed with your selling out to Putin and Russia. Biden and Dems all the way on November 3rd.
I get this impulse, but debates are different. Biden couldn’t challenge Trump the way Swan did here, because debate mods would shut him down for not following the ‘rules’ of ‘debate’. But they wouldn’t challenge him either. So Trump would just have a platform for spouting BS.
No, Biden’s election won’t end the nightmare
This might be too petty, but I really wish Joe Biden would make fun of Donald Trump's tanning and foundation routine.   It seems like just the ribbing that would make 70-year-old men's men who like hunting, fishing, and football to laugh at Trump's vain and effeminate habits.

There cannot be a presidential debate because Biden’s cognitive abilities are gone.
This is a fact. Biden has no shot in a debate. Trump will bully him in the stage, I guarantee it.
The media and the men (Dodd, Rendell) have made the Biden VP process look like it's falling apart, when Biden has likely known all along who his pick was. He's not tripping. Y'all are tripping!
RUSH: The reason they don't want any debates is because specifically of Joe Biden and his inability to do one.
If we define the 2020 edition of critical gender theory the cutoff of socially acceptable thought, 94% of Americans would fail that test.   We need a 77-year-old Catholic to express modern liberalism in terms 77-year-old Catholics can understand.
From a friend.....My entire family of 12 will be voting for Biden.
There's a chorus that feigns offense at every slip of the tongue Biden's ever made on crime, "record players", etc.   That's the largest, swingiest, and most important voting bloc. Americans whose heart is in the right place, but they're having a hard time articulating it.
The Republicans are gonna blame Biden when AIG needs another bailout.
77-year-old Joe Biden, an Irish Catholic from Scranton, who came of age during the Kennedy and Johnson eras, is actually the best standard bearer for this moment.   He can articulate 2020-era Democratic liberalism to the generation that needs to be included in the conversation.
mr biden, it's time to pick your running mate, sir  zzz.. wah? where am i?

Hi normal people who follow me,   Please ignore stuff like this. It's elites talking to each other through the press corps. They are always "worried." They ware always "concerned." This isn't a message for you. Obama picked Biden in late August BTW.  Sincerely,  JS
They know they cannot and should not attempt to speak in a partisan manner. A vote for Biden Is a vote against the American way and a vote for a completely centralized government. This normalizes dependence on the government, which amounts to a relinquishing of individual freedom

You have failed the American people at the time that they needed leadership the most.  warned us about this in late January. You had your warning - you ignored it.
Biden will not debate Trump because the country will see how mentally impaired he is. Just watch his last thirty appearances on his podcasts and on the campaign trail during the primaries. From beginning to end. Scary stuff. And a Trump is going to win.
This is going to make Trump soil his pants.
David, I will be taking your advice reading your tweet: "avoid media figures who claim to know the future. They are self promoting pundits, not respected journalists." Saying "if Biden wins" sounds like you just did the very thing you hate - predicting the future. #Hypocrite
many quivered when the ask came worded as Biden might have:  "we would like you to serve under the President"
I’ll say it again.  I do not believe any polling. If you want to defeat Trump in Nov. — VOTE! Do not leave it to others.  It doesn’t matter what state you’re in. Biden needs to win electoral college decisively and crush him in the popular vote.
Now Twitter allows this naked obscene viewing and will not allow Q! This is 2020 Biden voters that will be naked and poorer than they have ever seen before. I see drugs had to be used in this manifesto!
This is a really good point.   House and Senate Democrats forcing Senate Republicans to extending CARES Act unemployment insurance is more important than announcing Biden's running mate 1 week earlier.   Here, #TrumpDepression relief &gt; presidential politics.

I think if he dropped out now, Biden would lose to whomever the Republicans pick.
No, Biden shouldn’t give in the Progressives.   No.
So do *I* think Biden should appease Progressives.   Absolutely not.   THEY wouldn’t if the roles were reversed.  And AGAIN, we have to win without them.   Lock and load, Democrats
I’m conservative, so I rarely vote Democratic anyway. I don’t feel comfortable voting for Joe Biden in his current state, though I probably would have voted for his 2008 version. I might have voted for Andrew Yang or some earlier versions of some other candidates (e.g., Booker)
It doesn’t matter. Biden can still be elected president even if he’s indicted, and if Trump isn’t elected his term ends at noon on Jan. 20.

From Biden's perspective BLM both pays him and takes the Ukraine debacle out of the sheep's mind.
There is zero chance that Biden would concede to Trump for the "good of the nation."
Maybe Coronavirus will kill presidential debates once and for all. That would be a silver lining.
This chick thinks he hasn't BEEN known for months who his pick was. Biden has one job when it comes to picking a VP: Listen to the man who got him the nomination - Jim Clyburn. All these other folks counted him out after the Iowa caucuses.
... then one day in 2024 or 2028 we could be looking at a Kamala Harris-Tammy Duckworth ticket doubling down on women Senators &gt; Biden Cabinet alums, or a Pete Buttigieg-Tammy Duckworth ticket doubling down on the Midwest swing states and military service.
I think it's more likely that Duckworth is the Secretary of Defense in a Biden-Harris administration.  And Susan Rice is the Secretary of State.  After only POTUS, 3 of the top decision makers on national security and foreign policy would be women of color.
Tammy Duckworth isn't my #1 choice for Vice President. But if she's Biden's running mate I will still be very, very, very happy.   deserves to be on a Democratic ticket - if not this year, inevitably.
I was as anti-strategic-voting as anyone during the primary (I believed and still believe that Warren would make the best President out of all of them), but today the “pick Biden because he’ll bring important demos in key states back into the fold” argument looks pretty good.
Do not worry. Biden will use Covid as an excuse not to debate Trump.
Yep. Purpose of political conventions over last 30-50 years was a television extravaganza that promotes the party platform &amp; personalities.  At this point, what I want from the Dems is Biden on his patio, speaking in soothing, reassuring tones. Skip the balloons.

It HAD enthusiasm w a y back 2016. BIDEN IS WHAT ALL THE NOISE IS ABOUT FOR 2020. Trump can only be remembered for the poor handling of the pandemic, the 155,000 lives loss cuz it will magically disappear, looney! Deceiving the American people at every step for his own gain.
He's not a normal president. In plain view, he has corrupted the Justice system, the Intel, the Postal service, and other ones we aren't aware of yet.   But, for Covid and the economic and social devastation, the man would have easily crushed Biden.   Don't underestimate him!

Biden can’t go from wanting to meet Trump behind the school to ducking debates
I hope that I'm wrong. We'll see. But just as Obama didn't want to set a precedent by prosecuting members of the previous administration for crimes against humanity, it seems likely a Biden administration would, sadly, do the same. The elites *will* protect one another.
If Obama, HRC, or Biden were President right now, we would be having fewer than 100 deaths per day, only 70K in total, testing would be robust, our economy would be rebounding nicely and elected GOP would be having hearings about "the murder of 70K Americans."
Biden said he would veto Medicare for All, so as long as health insurance is still tied to employment it doesn’t matter which party you vote for.

Oh I miss that man! He knew shit back then but Biden is 100% worse today! Imagine the jokes he would be pumping out today if he were still alive NOT the crap that Jimmy Kimmel spews out about our POTUS every day! #Trump2020 ♥️🇺🇸💪🏼
Oh okay thanks, just found it!
Is this being televised?
Trump's interview debacle sends a warning for the fall campaign
Biden is not just as bad. He’s not an idiot! He stutters and it’s sad that people make fun of him for it or think he has dementia. I’ve listened to many of his speeches and he’s very articulate.
When does Biden sit down for one ?
“I love Trump &amp; I love Biden and Kamala is the best”
He and Gov Murphy are shutting down the states so they get a seat in The cabinet. I would ask if he plans on working with Biden.
'They are obsessed': Why Germany has so much riding on the U.S. election  via
Biden will not debate Trump because the country will see how mentally impaired he is. Just watch his last thirty appearances on his podcasts and on the campaign trail during the primaries. From beginning to end. Scary stuff. And a Trump is going to win.
Are you voting for Joe Biden? Because he has predator tendencies
Biden/Harris Dream Team 2020! Let’s make it happen!
Done! Thank you for your service regardless of your political affiliation. Biden will keep our country safe 10x better and not kiss dictators asses, causing security risks, in my opinion. #DictatorTrump
Do not worry. Biden will use Covid as an excuse not to debate Trump.
Ahh, that's the reason why Biden shouldn't do any debates. Not the fact that Biden would look like a stammering, dottering fool. Got it. 👍🏻
Biden’s people will be choosing a VP candidate soon. Joe can’t wait to see who it will be.
Trump's muddled message isn't landing
I wake up every day and think. Joe Biden is the nominee. Really. He really is. And then just carry on w my day
Biden can’t go from wanting to meet Trump behind the school to ducking debates
I forgot to add “Biden with Backstreet Boys” and of course: #KenteCringe
It’s unfortunate that the left has to fight the Democratic Party during a time where we all see the danger of another term. The danger doesn’t chance the fact that progressives are not represented by Biden. We have integrity. We believe our country is better that the status quo.
Honestly, it’s one of the few things he’s said lately that I agree with. In a pandemic with no campaigning or debates, and people worried to vote in person, I can’t think of a time better suited for a delay. I don’t even know what Biden stands for.
I get that some people want Trump out, but if there was ever a time to postpone an election to a time when you could campaign, debate, and vote safely, this would be the one. I don’t even know what Biden stands for at this point.
It would have fallen 95% if Biden had been in charge.
Biden’s plan is to hopefully still be able to dress himself in the morning.
Not me. Biden was a terrible candidate in 1988 and 2008. He’s worse now. A puppet who was rescued from the scrap heap by Obama, he’s an absolute moron. If virtually anyone else was running for the DNC, no problem. But with Biden, I’ll take a hard pass.
Hey Bama. I keep missing you. Hope you’re well!
Yes they are because Trump will be voted out &amp; the native son of Pennsylvania, Joe Biden, will be our 46th President!!  #BidenLandslide2020 #BlueWave2020  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS  #RebuildWithBiden
Your ignorance is really astonishing!! There is no difference between absentee voting &amp; mail in voting!! No matter how people vote you will lose in a Biden landslide!! #IdiotInChief  #TrumpIsAMoron #MailinBallots #ElectionDay   #VoteGOPout #BlueWave2020  #BidenLandslide2020
Diggin the flow, mami!
Mr Biden let’s face it. If we don’t think for ourselves and mask up and “bite the bullet” here, were doomed. He’s never gong to do anything, he’s in a world of his own misery. We need you, we need you bad!
1. Only Congress can change Election Day for federal offices, not you  2. Even if elections are delayed, your term of office expires at noon on January 20th, 2021  3. Hell to the No  "Mark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow”   - Joe Biden
I don’t know if you saw Barbra Streisand’s stupid little sermon. She actually thinks people give a crap to what she thinks. Biden is honest. What a joke!!
If you believe China’s data, you probably think Biden is a smart man. Compare the EU to the US. It’s a better comparison. Let me know what you find.
If anything those who vote shame make me not want to vote or make me despise their candidate even more. My choices something like this: 1. Yang  2. Tulsi 3. Bernie 4. Warren  The rest were a no. I absolutely hated Biden, Buttigeig, Harris, and yes, especially Bloomberg.
I don’t agree with you but, I really appreciate you not vote shaming. I’ve encountered a handful of Biden supporters that do everything they can guilt me into saying yes. You don’t seem like that.The Biden charade is the only charade I’m concerned about
Not until the DNC which Biden isn’t attending so Hillary can be nominated
You’d have to be not Trump and not Biden to get my vote
Can we see a graph on the % of negative stories about Trump vs the percentage of negative stories on Biden on all the cable networks?  How about the amount of minutes of airtime spent on those 3 BIGGEST Biden storylines vs. Russia collusion alone? Please.
You are so awesome, Andy. Thank you so very much for the kind mention.
It would give Trump the win.... he should do it just to win because with either one we’re screwed anyway.  Joe “nothing will fundamentally change” Biden.
Biden did apologize for his remarks.   I have never heard Trump apologize for anything.   Shame on you for defending the worst example on a President
They probably do, but it’s dumb people of any race who will vote for Kanye.  Unfortunately we need those people to vote for Biden, too, to run up the score.
If you’re calling Biden “Uncle Joe”, which used to be a nickname for Stalin, you might unconsciously be showing that you were never going to vote for him.
And you think Joe Biden is the answer?!? Get a clue! RHINO ALERT!!
Snark, sarcasm and wicked sense of humor! Plus very knowledgeable Brian Williams is a great way to end the nightly news mess!
Obama, Hillary and Biden too!
It's what Joe Biden clearly believes about black people, they are all the same it's not the first time he's said something along these lines.
Anyone else think that when Trump says Biden will 'hurt God' that he's exposing how serious his God Complex is?
Or Putin! You can’t vote for Biden if his VP pick is Putin. .... Oh, that’s right... I forgot Putin’s already running with Trump.
Nice deflection try Chris... There is a far cry from a couple of mispronounced words than some of the crap that falls out of bidens mouth.. It's incoherent half the time and complete sentences make no sense.  Biden has alzheimers and I feel bad for him but it's a truth
SHOCKING! (Well, not really...)
Joe Biden is racist. #JoeBidenIsARacist
People just let him get away with saying the most insane sh*t! It's like his Merry Christmas made up bullsh*t! We never had an issue with saying it, yet he made it one! People still repeat that lie! Now he's saying Biden will destroy the Bible and God 🤦‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦‍♀️
Lol Liberals are so desperate to find Biden’s positive qualities that they’ve turned to “He gets his weekly fairytales from child rapists in warlock cosplay”

Sad part it is Joe Biden will maintain decorum in the debate and *Trump will be *Trump! Attempting to bully and be overly aggressive! Whether Biden does or doesn't debate *Trump it all plays into *Trump's BS!
I, literally, don’t even understand what Biden was trying to say. 🤔
Anyone who is serious about depending on Biden’s VP pick to not vote for trump, is by definition, an unserious person.
JOE BIDEN THE LIAR CROOK WHERE'S HUNTER
In my unscientific poll Biden comes in last
I was wondering if you had any comments on Biden saying blacks have no diversity
First person that posts three Biden signs in 24 hours gets a free something
Joe Biden is the definition of spite....despite 70% of Americans being #MedicareForAll Mr Spite would veto it
Biden may have been a moderate before becoming a sock puppet for the extremist in his party.
Lord Chomsky said vote Biden and he is in leftist exile now
SHOCKING! (Well, not really...)
Not one Biden sign not one Biden bumper sticker I’ve never heard a conversation discussing Biden except about cognitive decline
It’s a fucking joke Biden is the punchline
LOLOL  Biden couldn't be president of a PTA!!
I thought I read Biden said no debates then he announced a Republican was speaking for him at the convention.....and he’s not attending.   He will never serve one day as President
Please don’t vote Biden Krystal!!
Biden needs as many votes as possible, including the dummies who would vote for Kanye.
Biden is a clueless puppet.
Joe Biden is a scumbag.    Pass it on.   #NeverBiden
Lol anyone is better than either 2 of these guys but 4 of Trump is better than 8 of the dnc choices at least the public elected trump while Biden was installed
Biden needs all the votes he can get, including the votes of the morons.
Instead of the Alzheimer’s test his inept doctor gave tRump, how about a challenge Stanford-Binet competition between Trump + VP Biden? 😅😂🤣
"Done" as in done with horseshit no one cares about? Try and understand,  whoever Biden picks is pre-approved by all Dem voters and no amount of baggage (the US CP, really? WHO CARES) will change that.
why does biden have to answer trump questions he is not the president? and why do you feel biden should be doing anything at this point like really all he has to do is sit back and let trump open his mouth and speak
You’re describing Biden you realize, who can’t even read a teleprompter
Biden has a stutter, what’s Trump’s excuse?
But he won't because the Left seriously doesn't have anyone better right now. Biden is the only one who has a realistic chance of going to toe-to-toe with Trump and winning, if the economy and pandemic somehow make independents &amp; swing voters turn against Trump
Trump would totally dominate Susan Rice or Kamala Harris. I really hope Biden pulls out and his insane VP choice becomes candidate- that would almost guarantee another landslide
Wrong !  Why should Biden waste his time on a debate knowing that trump will lie about everything?
I’m not saying he was right I’m just saying he was coherent spoke in complete sentences didn’t go off of topic....Biden can’t do that but lie to yourself if you must
because EVERYONE knows Biden can't debate!
you're right , but totally off base about Trump. He wants immigration based on SKILLS, hes always said that, but NOW we must focus on AMERICANS getting jobs. If u think Biden/Socialists will be better than Trump/GOP you're crazy #Trump2020NowMoreThenEver
I saw a poll on twitter with over 4000 votes and Howie beating Biden by double digits.... I was pretty impressed and I’m trying to replicate it now
I know there’s a million why Bernie was better......the question to why Biden is better than Trump is hard to answer really there is no difference.
Biden couldn’t handle that. The rest we will see
All I have to say is Trump handled this way better than Biden ever could at this point in his dementia.  Trump just has to do a few things for the people and he wins.   I suggest #Medicare4All  and #UBI
Ok Bernie now Biden’s turn tell us all the reasons you were better
Biden should only do it if there is a fact checker in real time.
The only Biden volunteer that isn’t lazy is Bernie
The Obama legacy.  Obama didn’t endorse him until Biden promised to uphold Obama’s shitty Legacy... that’s why stopping Bernie was imperative
If only.....Biden is but another useless corporate tool
I'd like to see Biden survive a press conference without hand picked questions... Or an interview with Hannity or tucker or even Brett baier....
If Joe biden wins they will probably just release him
Hmm and they endorsed Joe biden go figure..
Hey you should stop the black and white talk like black is bad and white is good....you’re like Biden lol and that’s why he isn’t getting my vote
BIDEN HAD HIS BEST DAY REMAINING TODAY.....IT’S ONLY DOWN HILL FROM HERE
Tell Joe Biden: Make Abortion Access for All* A Top Priority
COVID-19 was the best thing to ever happen to Joe Biden
Agreed, Joe Biden decided to run for president by choice. If he cannot handle the job because he is too old (personally I feel Trump is to old) then he shouldn't be running for the job.
Ok by your logic Biden should wipe the floor with Trump. He should show the nation he can.
I know the truth about Biden from thoes who had to protect him in the secret service
If you knew what went on with Biden and other women weather they wanted it or not behind closed doors or when the cameras stopped rolling you would not be talking like that.
AND CHINA GAVE US THIS VIRUS. CHINA WANTS BIDEN TO WIN
GATES IS IN BED WITH THE MARXIST AND COMMUNST JOE BIDEN HE HAS MONEY BUT NO COMMONSENSE.
Strap in folks the weird sh*t hasn't started to flow yet! The stuff they pulled on Hillary Clinton is nothing compared to what they are going to throw at Joe Biden! The voter suppression will be outrageous and more obvious, because they don't care! This is going to get real ugly
Even another round when foreclosures begin and all we’re left with is Biden...
I’d prefer 4 years before 8.  Biden will be Hidin and the streets will be filled and the tanks will roll.
Was a red voter for ten years because of misinformation but now I am back to being a blue voter.  Ridin’ with Biden.
When Biden comes out of his hole, he says hes going to bring back jobs!! He is saying he's going to do what TRUMP has already done! How does he propose to do this when he's against manufacturing, pro CHINA, PRO HIGHER TAXES! WE DON'T BELEIVE YOU!!
Maybe Biden's decline will lead to a Convention fight? Maybe Bernie makes a move to be their candidate?
HeyPhil Obama andhis cronies said Benghazi was bcause ofa movie u know where the American heros died protecting the amb they liedfor weeksAnd his sec of lies Susan rice liedher ass off.And now she a possible VP pick for joe Biden.Thats a sorry pool of choices itwill bite her soon
JOE BIDEN. DRIVER.
And Trump supporters got the nerve to laugh at Biden lmao
Abortion is a deal-breaker for him? But the 10's of thousands who have died because of Trump's incompetence is not enough to sway him to vote for Biden?? What kind of friggin logic is this except that this asshat doesn't know the meaning of pro-life
This is Biden mocking us.  I e noticed it happening more and more.  Clinton saying how they stole the primary another example
Yes. You’re so very right. Joe Biden and our next FLOTUS Jill will definitely need us and our all-in support from day one. And thank you Latty for including me in your list. I am humbled to be included with Joe Biden!
4 of 4 WHY??? Biden
3 of 4 Why Biden?
A friend wrote some choice tidbits about why we’re fucked and why it’s so hard to hold our noses and vote Biden 1of4
Bison is a the liar, he has more illegal involvement with forensic countries than any one running this year. The Russians would love to see Biden get the presidency, as they look at him like hikers as someone they can do Busness with. Rennet the Uraineum 1 deal.
I’ve been saying since last summer the unbeatable ticket would be Biden-Harris. I think mostly based on the superficial. But they’d also make a great team and give the country a sense of hope and what’s possible again.
Not fair if Biden doesn't DEBATE TRUMP!! We the voters have a right to make decisions from watching the debates! Its an intrical part of a presidential election! Don't blame the virus, wear a mask! We all know the Dems don't want the debates. TRUMP WOULD DOMINATE!!!
How to know your partner is a predator.....Joe Biden turns her on it must be whispering and the for the camera groping...lol
Absolutely. I don’t need to see Biden debate Trump to know he would be a far better President. Biden was veep for eight years, it’s not like he’s an unknown quantity.
Joe Biden can't even complete a sentence
But you believe the polls that Biden is winning election and everyone loves wha idiot Lamont is doing to ct and that everyone wants single payer healthcare? 🤣
Far more likely the  camp realizes his dementia is so advanced that he can’t be allowed to debate Biden. #trumpdementia
Will Biden's VP pick be better than Pence? She's got my support. #Biden2020
Kids remember in 60 years you too will look like Joe Biden
Ummmm . . .   I have deep respect for Symone. She is a phenom &amp; an electrifying presence. However, this is the wrong focus right now as JB’s black women VP candidates are being publicly maligned during this process.   Will these Black men on Biden’s campaign speak up for them?
I can’t believe worse than Hillary I didn’t think it possible.  Is there someone worse than Biden?  If so that persons next
Bernie Sanders doesn’t have hundreds of videos on youtube showing him groping young girls like his good friend Joe.... FYI for the Biden supporters
Go to YouTube and watch hours of fondling by Biden
I seem to recall Kavenaugh being held to account for things he did in the 70/80s. Why would Joe get a pass. Unlike Kavenaugh, Biden was in office.
Well Joe Biden is a Catholic, so I can’t see why he’d have a problem with that
No to Susan Rice. I'd prefer someone who'd managed to get elected to something on their own account being elevated to President if something happens to Biden. I don't want an appointed President.
Settle for Biden or as I like to say Settle ForBiden .... who are these people?
I will not surrender and I don’t understand people who will.   Settle for Biden people are an embarrassment to themselves.  Settle NEVER!
Numbers growing.... in a twitter poll not that I put much faith in them over 4000 people voted so I paid a little more attention Hawkins had 36% Biden 14%....something to ponder
Lol Hillary couldn’t win even when she won Biden is worse
Point is though you won't have to worry when Biden slaughters and dismembers Trump in November.
had 8 years to move even more forward with his VP Biden yet everything got worse long before  anounced his bid to run for office. Dont believe me than check the dates that Black Lives Matter and Antifa began. Check how Trump received an award for
As Biden said “vote for the other guy”.  Howie Hawkins
Excuse me.... they won’t let us. We picked Bernie.  They stole primaries and gave us Biden
Joe Biden will throw you in jail for weed.
You forgot to hat she called Biden racist hello! Again think twice before you talk!! My opinion
Brilliant! 😂😂😂😂😂👍 She can be the Biden Admin Liar-in-Chief.
Yeah, Moms for Biden don’t get 180 grand a year to sleep with the presidents son. 😊
I just wish the democrats wouldn't vote right along with republicans, with no compromises or arguments, when they do this.  Biden went on the floor for years advocating for cuts to SS and Medicare.
We need a revolt. Why is Biden even on the ballot. He isn’t well. We the people deserve way better. Vote trump at least he has some marbles.
That is true what u say about CT but we were talking about handling the coronavirus.  If u want 2 talk prosperity under Democratic &amp; Republican leadership, I give u this graph.  Don't worry about Biden. Look at the country now. Can u honestly tell me it's better than 4 yrs ago?
Hard to believe Bernie picked Biden over us
Most leftest and progressives I know openly despise Biden and the Democratic party. I think they are in for a very harsh awakening come January.
The only people who are delusional are the ones who think Trump is good for this country and Biden is bad. Read more my friend. Turn off Fox News.
It’s delusional to think Biden or trump cares about you.
Agreed. Along with Biden, Cheney, and most of both administrations
Not voting in the November election this year is one more vote for Trump. Idgaf what you think about Biden, I don’t like him. He isn’t Batman or Superman, he’s not the hero of the long run. He’s the step in the right direction towards a better future
WHAT A BRILLIANT IDEA LETS KICK THE ELECTION BACK 3 TO 5 MONTHS THIS WILL GET CHINESE VIRUS DOWN AND JOE BIDEN WONT KNOW WHO HE IS. DEMOCRATS MELTDOWN.
Ask her to not support Biden he hasn’t even reached out to her what a joke

Thank you Jim! I’m a moderate democrat and I know Joe Biden will do his best to get us where we need to be ... and beyond.
That’s all the choice you got. Go with Biden!!Biden-ites have got to know,  is saying these things because his (apparent) dementia is becoming more prominent. Joe actually thinks these things, and has to be told that what he is saying is wrong (seriously WRONG) He is not realizing they are BAD.
This #Election2020 is between two camps: A BusinessMan vs a Politician. The businessman works for the economy. The Politician works for himself first. Trump vs Biden ( people that vote for Biden wouldn't care even if was Charles Manson), they are just ANTI-TRUMP
I'd rather deal with Trump tweets than Biden's dementia.
For example, I criticize Joe Biden for wanting to increase police funding, but Trump attacks Biden by lying and pretending Biden wants to defund the police.
No, he won't, because I criticize Biden from the left and Trump would see the things I criticize him for as good
Trump doesn't need "ammo" to attack Biden. He'll attack Biden regardless of what you do.
Mark your calendars, Biden Crucifixion at the 2020 Presidential Debate
Or Putin! You can’t vote for Biden if his VP pick is Putin. .... Oh, that’s right... I forgot Putin’s already running with Trump.
Democrats already have the power to get the entire world on board to create a “hoax” infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands  just to make Fearless Leader look bad so I completely believe Biden has the power to hurt God.  Makes total sense
It does now, it’s destroying the country to spite Trump. That whether they want to or not gets them banished from the Republican party. Guess what you wanna vote for Biden auto Democrat  status. Lefty way, they cut off the nose to spite the face.
Biden may have been a moderate before becoming a sock puppet for the extremist in his party.
Y’all actively shit on trump when it’s clear everyone is out to get him. But let Biden slide. Dude can’t even finish a sentence and gropes little girls. That’s cool I guess
We'll find out if Joe Biden is elected
Joe Biden calls a Bkack reporter #BlafricanAmerican
Joe Biden in my honest opinion is in severe cognitive decline. What the democrats are doing is elder abuse. Frankly seeing j.b. makes me want to throw up in my mouth. You seriously want him as a president? Chances are he's on house arrest and being denied his drug of choice.
I have herniated discs and bulging discs and still suffering effects of my concussion and throw my P.T.S.D in the mix and im still better equipped to take a cognitive test then (child abuser sleepy joe Biden) the joke of the democrat party. I was a C.N.A. before finishing h.s.
I don't know how Parker isn't embarrassed to make tweets like this as if Biden doesn't show signs of dementia every damn day.
Democratic National Convention organizers announced that all convention speakers, including Joe Biden, will no longer be traveling to Milwaukee.
Goes to show you a lot about the job Trump is doing that Biden can hide away from everything and still be pummeling Trump in the polls.
“Oh how cute he must be a big cuddly Biden supporter.” Or “look everybody Biden Bear he’s so cute.” TIt would be cute and sweet and fun and a laugh. There’d be merch!
There are so many Biden signs about, I would not even knew he was running if it wasn't for  , because even then he is the permanent cellar dweller, who will run his administration from his basement. Imagine a G20 summit from his basement
Wow, just wow the Kenya gymnastics your lefty loons will go through to stop Biden from debating is laughable. And yes, you’ve exposed yourself as the snake you are lefty liberal as they come wolf on sheep’s clothing.

What is going to be scary in the Trump-Biden debates? NO TELEPROMPTER'S .......Games to play during debate, Everytime Joe Biden says "Uh or Hmm" you gotta take a drink. We should post the results the next day. (Or the day after that when some of you finally wake up)
Massive amount of Wills being written, since the Biden Administration would drive America into the ground.

This was the last question on the cognitive test, it’s the hardest, I got all the colors right. Lets see Biden do that
HB, I totally agree. This is what we've been fighting for. We deserve to have a stable POTUS who actually knows what he's doing. Biden has the experience to get the US out of the multiple crises that we're in.
I'd like to see Biden survive a press conference without hand picked questions... Or an interview with Hannity or tucker or even Brett baier....
Trump news conferences. Makes Biden look awful
Admittedly Biden smelling of farts is not the most unlikely part of my premise
If Joe biden wins they will probably just release him
Hmm and they endorsed Joe biden go figure..
The risks are that these things are fucking pointless. Biden gives an erudite and impassioned 8 minute speech that'd make JFK greet. Trump replies "lol you smell of farts lol" NY Times next day: TRUMP WOWS COUNTRY DURING MASTERFUL DEBATE
Should debate a dummy with a pull string of Biden’s answers in his voice!
How long has Biden been in DC?  50 years? And done what exactly?  Pull your head out...
Oh, I'll definitely be voting for Biden. We've got one chance to fix what Trump has caused here in the states.
Alright im done retweeting joe biden its clear that hes missing half of his brain
Joe Biden's boat parade must be with submarines
the toaster could have picked Biden as  a VP and I'd still vote for it.
If Joe Biden leads Trump by double digits, why is he afraid to debate him?
I'm sure Biden will reverse this hahahahahahahahaha
THIS is why propaganda and lies are dangerous. Will you wake up????
Imagine thinking Joe Biden was that cool
The same way biden leads trump in polling
Look up bigot in a dictionary Biden’s picture will be there What are blacks thinking ?
I hear you, I just see a lot of people praising Obama when they shouldn't and I fear that it could lead to people not holding anyone who isn't Trump accountable in the future. Mad I have to vote Biden, but I will vote for him nevertheless
.      Should start preparing for the conversation that dems will force trump to either debate kamala harris or no one at all. Joe Biden will never get on a debate stage with donald trump
I hope with all my heart that this is a harbinger of Michigan voting for Biden and not Trump this November.
Kamala Harris' selection proves Dems know they have ZERO chance of beating Trump in 2020.  No moderate will ever vote for a CA rep with Biden's dementia.
When Biden announces Kamala Harris as his VP next week, it will be the greatest gift for Donald Trump that you can imagine.  No moderate voter will vote for a Biden/Harris ticket.   CA is not the way to run this country - and Harris will wear that moniker the entire campaignI am going to assume you’re voting for Biden. The man can’t even formulate a thought and be consistent with what he is saying.  very scary for Biden to be placed in the highest office at president. He has done nothing in his 40 years in office what policies will he really fix
I’m voting for Biden even if he picks a loaded, BM’d Depends as his running mate. GTFOH lady.
I wonder who really wrote this. Sure as heck wasn't ole creepy sleepy fumblin bumblin Joe Biden.

Biden won’t debate Need Biden dummy with a pull string with all his wisdoms and POTUS asking the questions.Maybe Dirty Harry could help
Anyone seen Joe Biden and Pat Paulson at the same time?Who has run for POTUS more?
They're seeing Biden as 4 more years of Obama, something which they just violently rejected! So much of the conservative movement is based on rejecting everything about Obama.   It's part of why Hillary lost, and it's why I'm not safe in Biden winning at all.
Bernie. Sanders had the best chance of converting those voters back to the Democratic side, not Biden. Biden was one of the lowest.   This shouldn't be remotely fucking surprising though. Republican voters aren't seeing Biden as a unique candidate.
I'm not sure where liberals got the crack-brained idea that Biden is the "electable candidate" because one super vital piece of data from the beginning of the Democratic primaries really puts in clear focus.
I drove through 3 states last week: MN, WI, &amp; MI. I saw one pro Biden sign.
HB, I totally agree. This is what we've been fighting for. We deserve to have a stable POTUS who actually knows what he's doing. Biden has the experience to get the US out of the multiple crises that we're in.

Joe Biden has spent his entire career supporting and promoting women’s rights. That's why I joined Women For Biden. Join women from across the country as we continue the fight for women's health care, paychecks, safety, and families.

Oh, I'll definitely be voting for Biden. We've got one chance to fix what Trump has caused here in the states.
Alright im done retweeting joe biden its clear that hes missing half of his brain
Joe Biden is a coward who is afraid to debate President Trump and is looking for excuses
Biden could write a book about how to lie to the public and have it look like your the good guy. They’re all so full of shit
My future along with my sons depends on not voting for him and voting for Biden.
Is he breathing? Then yes. And of course Biden is going to debate him. Perfect way to demonstrate presidential behavior vs clown show.
The death of democracy comes with Biden buddy
Fake polling, Fake ads and a fake President, Biden more progressive the Bernie ???? You are desperate and completely delusional.
The only thing saving Biden from a close race is the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic I wasn’t on board with voting for Biden, but after seeing how Trump killed 150,000+ Americans its Biden all the way.
Look up bigot in a dictionary Biden’s picture will be there What are blacks thinking ?
Harris is not my fave. I actually am not a fan. But, in terms of enthusiasm, she’ll bring it. I love Bottoms, to me she has it all! Also, those talking about Rice? Seems no one remembers The Benghazi hearings. Biden has tons of foreign policy cred, he doesn’t need her.
I don't follow the NHL so I can't speak to that. As for Biden, I can tell from your tweet history that you are a big Trump guy but many smart rational people think Biden is the best guy for our country. It's ok that you have a different opinion but don't be obtuse about it.
"I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy," Biden said
Yup.  Biden/Clinton
How asinine: whoever Biden's handlers pick will be selected PRECISELY  because he/she/it is supposed to become president.  Serious question: have you SEEN Biden recently?
if ur liberal but think voting for biden is dumb some1 needs to poop in ur mouth
How today's #Liberals are using #Nazi tactics #CancelCulture #BLM #BlackLivesMatter #AntifaTerrorists #Biden #Democrats #AntifaBLMDomesticTerrorists #AntiFascist
Biden will make it right.  You are a Russian agent.
do you know who that Biden handler was that led him out of the store?   That was a very weird scene...
You sound desperate. Almost pleading.   Is it because Biden is ahead of you in the polls IN TEXAS?
No it's not! What until Biden get in. That's what you'll get.Remarkable that Trump somehow has the credibility among his followers to criticize Biden's faith and belief in God?  Its akin to watching Stalin lecture Eisenhower about democracy.  The hubris is hard to fathom.  The enabling by his supports - impossible to swallow.
Never said he wasn’t there just said that Biden has been hiding 🤷🏻‍♂️
Bruh to be fair Biden has been hiding in his basement this whole time
Joe Biden as usual fantasy he hasn't repeated himself.A Black VP just to get a Black vote. Lol He thinks all Black people think the same. He is always about race.We are all Americans color does not matter when will they figure that out and stop catorgizing people sick of it.
If you cared about all the people that put you in office you would not be doing all you can to hurt us by going against President Trump Whom happens to be doing good for Americans Why would you  campaign to get Biden elected He is unfit and y know it.
Pelosi and Biden must have done media training together.  They just babble and make little sense.  All that plastic surgery seems to tugged too hard on her brain.
You are your own best commercial for Biden. #DumpTrump2020
Lol you got jokes Biden can’t even tie his shoes lol the mans mentally incompetent he won’t even date why because he can’t hang the old fool reads scripts lol trump would destroy him in a debate at the liberals know it
Oh and FYI joe Biden lol that incompetent fool he can’t remember what he had for breakfast let alone run a country that’s why he won’t debate because he can’t
Joe Biden is the clueless one sorry but I don’t care for either one but my vote gotta go with trump
This makes me cry every time I see it because I know our president is a very generous and caring human being! He loves people whether you all realize it or not but he is a people person not a fake phony like racist Joe Biden!
Even Robin Williams saw through the RAMBLING, HAIR SNIFFING, TOUCHY FEELY WITH LITTLE GIRLS, POS, CAREER POLITICIAN, RACIST, DO NOTHING FOR OUR COUNTRY...CREEPY JOE BIDEN!! #Trump2020 #VoteThemOut2020 #VoteRedOrAmericasDead ♥️🇺🇸💥💪🏼👌🏼

Sure is and Biden can be counted on to appoint the same kind of Corporate-loving, Wall Street-worshipping, Billionaire Class sycophants as Trump. Probably even some of the same people.
I rather have a player kneel for his beliefs, than have a president of the U.S. having service men killed with your selling out to Putin and Russia. Biden and Dems all the way on November 3rd.
Well apples and oranges right lol look I don’t really like trump I don’t always like the way he does things but Biden lol my vote got to go with trump
I don’t like trump but I sure as hell not voting for Biden lol
As long as the social distance yes they should debate but see here’s the prob joe Biden can’t debate because he can’t even remember what he had to eat the day before lol and he has to read a script from a teleprompter when you debate you can’t do that lol
Biden will not debate Trump because the country will see how mentally impaired he is. Just watch his last thirty appearances on his podcasts and on the campaign trail during the primaries. From beginning to end. Scary stuff. And a Trump is going to win.
Do not worry. Biden will use Covid as an excuse not to debate Trump.
If you vote for Biden you are voting for someone with dementia. He supports the Marxist Demo-Rats and has done nothing for African Americans except to keep them in poverty and be dependent so they vote for Demo-Rats.
Biden’s people will be choosing a VP candidate soon. Joe can’t wait to see who it will be.
Biden can’t go from wanting to meet Trump behind the school to ducking debates
A dictatorship? Stop exaggerating pls.   And exactly. I’m voting for Biden not his VP. Biden is just as bad to me with sexual misconduct.

Not true, but Biden does seem to be against,  Killing you.  Trump's cool with that because,  "It is what it is."
Trumpito endorsing Biden better than Biden could endorse himself.
It’s just my opinion, but not voting for Trump is NOT enough. Not voting for Biden = a vote for Trump. Why is THAT so hard to understand?
Why would Biden ever consent to a debate?
Well many months ago I heard Trump was not deciding to debate biden and I thought that was not great. So I don’t know I’m trying to turn my feelings around to looking at it from another view and I think maybe he should agree to debate Trump
This is what’s called a win-win...both will be part of Biden’s cabinet (tho I’d love for Rice to be Sec of State).
Looking forward to this Jill Stein supporting assclown praise of Biden’s pick of Harris with as much enthusiasm as when she praised Bernie’s love for Joe Rogan. #girlBye

We are NOT HAPPY WITH YOU DONALD TRUMP BIDEN 2020🇺🇸make America Shit free again!!!
I look at polling information as well as understanding that progressive vote got split in her state bc Bernie is even bigger than her on that role. Progressives aren't sold on Biden, because they want legitimate change not the status quo.
Warren was easily able to skewer everyone but Bernie in the debates, so how are you able to come to that assumption? Additionally, as a progressive, no we are not all just going for Biden. I won't vote for a ticket that is Biden/Harris because that's spitting in our face.
In polls she brings the most votes to Biden, and she helps unite the progressive wing with the moderate wing, something no other VP candidate does
True, here in Key Largo I've only seen one Biden lawn sign and dozens of Trump flags and banners hanging from both houses and boats! By my count of just a few square blocks, that's about a 40 to 1 ratio.
She got into that thing with Biden where she yelled at him for trying to stop bussing in the 70s. I wouldn't think he'd pick her.
Not to be morose or wishing any harm, but I think it’s particularly important for the Biden campaign. It’s not unreasonable to think they could take over the Presidency at some point if Biden wins. Joe is 77 and would be 82 by the end of his first term
You're right, my mistake. "Mop" not "moo." Biden is going to mop the floor with Trump in every debate. Thanks for catching that, the all caps was a bit much though.
What's Biden's plan? Pretty much the same, right?
Biden has already said he will not pardon Trump.
Biden condemned Trump for stoping flights from China the end of February and Nancy P told everyone to go to Chinatown in SF at the end of Feb.  Dr Farci also told us Americans had nothing to worry about at the end of February. Lots of blame to go around!
Did you see hunter biden in your studies?
Biden is a known quantity. So is Trump. I don't need to see a debate to decide, but the question is disingenuous. Biden wants to debate, and will mop the floor with Trump. Trump is the one who will dodge the debates after he gets his ass handed to him in the first one.
I am in love with her as well.  She is my 1st pick.  And she has worked with biden for years. They have a relationship in the oval.
The stronger argument is that Trump has dishonered the presidency, and Biden will not give him the time of day. Trump doesn't deserve to be treated with regard.
If Biden made that kind of gaff people would be screaming from the rooftops that he has dementia. But Trump had set the bar so low for his own "mental acuity" that we all just think it's more normal tRumo stupidity but don't actually question his mental capacity!
This country and Joe Biden cannot afford to lose one vote to an unrealistic candidate.

Completely fair question...Biden would have forgotten by now anyway...
Regardless of the legal ramifications of this proposal, the very fact that Trump is considering an election delay is frightening— though perhaps not all that surprising.

Ahh, that's the reason why Biden shouldn't do any debates. Not the fact that Biden would look like a stammering, dottering fool. Got it. 👍🏻
Trump's muddled message isn't landing
Wait, are there champions, or is it just Trump and Biden duking it out in the ring?
They have been begging, bribing and berating countries opening for dirt on Biden!!!
Has Biden made a comment about not debating?
I'm voting for Biden because he won't deliver us to our enemies. #TrumpDeliveryBoy  #YesWeCanAgain #VoteForJoe
I wake up every day and think. Joe Biden is the nominee. Really. He really is. And then just carry on w my day
You know what? It doesn’t really matter if Trump supporters want to accept it or not. If Biden wins he wins. Just like Trump did in 2016. And Biden won’t need the help of Russia either.
And here’s #SleepyJoe Biden demanding something be done about the Mexican beer disease so he can sniff kids in public again. #votemrmagoonomatterwho
Agree. I haven’t doven deep, but from afar, a Biden-Harris ticket feels strong. He could use a strong woman to bolster his slight old-man-feeble image.  Warren also fits this bill.
Presidents by and large don’t create jobs. Unemployment is largely dependent on the business cycle, which operates pretty darn independently of fiscal and monetary policy. But even if you think presidents do create jobs, then Biden and Obama “created” even more than Trump.
YES, IT WILL BE - Americans will defeat the Donkey Party with stupid leaders like -Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, Schiff, Nadler, Squad, and all its foolish policies, including Defund Police &amp; Socialism !!!!
Why doesn't Biden just pick up some girl from the local convenience store as VP? She will be so overwhelmed I am sure she won't "rub anybody the wrong way"
I forgot to add “Biden with Backstreet Boys” and of course: #KenteCringe
Even Rice who has notable baggage wouldn’t blow it for Biden. Every choice comes with some risk. However, not enough to swing an election like this.
The incumbent president is on pace to lose in a landslide, and people think a pretty anonymous congresswoman who went on a trip 50 years ago to Cuba and had one ill worded quote is going to blow it all for Biden.
Isn't that what you are complaining about? That capital gains taxes will match the earned income tax rate?
I’m betting Obama, Radical Do-Nothing Democrats, Biden, ANTIFA, and the Lamestream Media will also be on the list.
I really think it will easily come off as a fishing expedition considering this was nearly half a century ago. She’s admitted to the Biden campaign that it would come up and even Annette Taddeo said it might cause some problems, but that it certainly wasn’t cataclysmic.
Is #Nunes #conspiring with #Russians to #subvert #presidential #election, #politics
Never said that.  I'm clearly stating what many people are feeling. Fyi 77% of Democrats are voting against trump, not for Biden.
Rep Scalise and 3 experts are demolishing Dems charges that Trump and his admin have not done enough to fight Covid19 - SHAME ON PELOSI, SCHUMER, BIDEN, AND ALL FOOLISH DEMS !!!!
It’s unfortunate that the left has to fight the Democratic Party during a time where we all see the danger of another term. The danger doesn’t chance the fact that progressives are not represented by Biden. We have integrity. We believe our country is better that the status quo.
Honestly, it’s one of the few things he’s said lately that I agree with. In a pandemic with no campaigning or debates, and people worried to vote in person, I can’t think of a time better suited for a delay. I don’t even know what Biden stands for.
I get that some people want Trump out, but if there was ever a time to postpone an election to a time when you could campaign, debate, and vote safely, this would be the one. I don’t even know what Biden stands for at this point.
It would have fallen 95% if Biden had been in charge.
Biden’s plan is to hopefully still be able to dress himself in the morning.
I agree, Donald Trump is not a great guy, but look at our current options. Joe Biden? Dont use the word decent. We had an opportunity to get creative bu the party is being run by the crazy far left. They have zero perspective on what it takes to run an economy.
Gladly volunteer w brothers &amp; sisters 2 assist moving the coward/traitor in chief (   out of White House on instruction from PRESIDENT BIDEN   upon him assuming office.  Served from 68-71 US ARMY and look forward to thanking trump  4 his cowardice
And here comes #SleepyJoe Biden to throw out the first pitch in Cincinnati during a campaign stop. #votemrmagoonomatterwho
Not me. Biden was a terrible candidate in 1988 and 2008. He’s worse now. A puppet who was rescued from the scrap heap by Obama, he’s an absolute moron. If virtually anyone else was running for the DNC, no problem. But with Biden, I’ll take a hard pass.
Hey Bama. I keep missing you. Hope you’re well!
Yes they are because Trump will be voted out &amp; the native son of Pennsylvania, Joe Biden, will be our 46th President!!  #BidenLandslide2020 #BlueWave2020  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS  #RebuildWithBiden
Your ignorance is really astonishing!! There is no difference between absentee voting &amp; mail in voting!! No matter how people vote you will lose in a Biden landslide!! #IdiotInChief  #TrumpIsAMoron #MailinBallots #ElectionDay   #VoteGOPout #BlueWave2020  #BidenLandslide2020
Diggin the flow, mami!
Interfering with an election? Trump literally accuses him and Biden of corruption every other day. About time these punch him back.
would be better as Treasury Sec. Too white and too close in age to Biden. My fav VP picks - Demming and Rice.
What the fuck is wrong with you. Lol. Just answer the question or don’t.  If you want to say “I don’t understand correlation” just say that. Don’t have to demonstrate that. Ok Biden?
This is how it's gonna be - and worse, all the way through Biden's inauguration.  Buckle up, donate, volunteer and make sure EVERYONE you know is registered and ready to vote (however they can).  Respond with action.  #vote
Exactly!  I got a good chuckle when Trump gave the same answer he gave to HRC in 2015 -- We'll see what happens.  If there are enough idiots to vote for Biden this country is doomed.
Tax Hike Under Biden Poses Bigger Threat to Tech Than Hearing
Mr Biden let’s face it. If we don’t think for ourselves and mask up and “bite the bullet” here, were doomed. He’s never gong to do anything, he’s in a world of his own misery. We need you, we need you bad!
1. Only Congress can change Election Day for federal offices, not you  2. Even if elections are delayed, your term of office expires at noon on January 20th, 2021  3. Hell to the No  "Mark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow”   - Joe Biden
According to this ridiculous line of argument Reagan should not pick HW Bush for VP because he attacked him in the primary?  And Biden should pick an unqualified black woman for VP because Kamala is too ambitious and would run for President.... LIKE EVERY OTHER VP IN HISTORY
Dear Schiff - Trump got over $140B for NATO from underpaying nations, including Germany. Dems did nothing and should Biden become President, he will do nothing in that respect along with other give aways !
I don’t know if you saw Barbra Streisand’s stupid little sermon. She actually thinks people give a crap to what she thinks. Biden is honest. What a joke!!
If you believe China’s data, you probably think Biden is a smart man. Compare the EU to the US. It’s a better comparison. Let me know what you find.
And here comes #SleepyJoe Biden on his way to the DNC convention in Milwaukee to thank “the Windy City” for it’s hospitality and looking forward to finding out who’s running for President. #votemrmagoonomatterwho
If anything those who vote shame make me not want to vote or make me despise their candidate even more. My choices something like this: 1. Yang  2. Tulsi 3. Bernie 4. Warren  The rest were a no. I absolutely hated Biden, Buttigeig, Harris, and yes, especially Bloomberg.
I don’t agree with you but, I really appreciate you not vote shaming. I’ve encountered a handful of Biden supporters that do everything they can guilt me into saying yes. You don’t seem like that.
Maybe you should put your energy into convincing the party to drop Biden, who is functionally one of the most significant structural racists IN AMERICAN HISTORY,  before  nomination is officially set, instead of this sad passive struggle for a symbolic appointment.
If Biden wins, his VP is going to be the presumptive nominee after his term, whoever it is. Taking office with a VP ready to serve is always important, but would be an essential selling point now.  Getting them ready for the Presidency should be a high priority.
How does any sane person think Biden is fit to be POTUS. I get that they hate Trump but everything they've tried has been fake and now this Biden support show what that what they said about T45 was all bogus. Can't eat your cake and have it too.
Since the rangers are back and sports are starting to come back I will no longer be tweeting or liking any more politics (except to make fun of Biden cuz it’s just hilarious). It has been a lot of fun pissing everyone off. Open your eyes. Go Vote. ⚡️⚡️
So lol I repeated K bc my English sucked but at least I took my own SATs as probably Biden
Can’t wait to vote for Biden
Per Elizabeth Warren's twitter, the inspector general is being investigated.....by the office of the inspector general? Idk man, this shit is fucking insane. I fucking hate Biden and Harris but I'm voting for them. If I have to do it in person, I guess I'm calling out of work.
Trump calls Joe biden sleepy Joe! But his nick name is  trump the  liar the thief he  rapist!  liar liar liar rapist killer stupid dumb  liar liar Cheeto! Shut up Trump’
"Sitting congresswom(e)n ... Rashida Tlaib and Biden adviser AOC ..." A clear statement that both are congresswomen.  Ninny.
I know. I think about you everytime I hear someone suggest that the debates should be canceled. The good news is that POTUS wants to debate Biden. He won't let it go.
How do you say, "V shaped recovery." In Biden bizzaro world?
Traitor Trump trying peace treaties with Israel , I mean at this point he can’t change his spots , we already know he’s  a con and a piece of shit , vote Biden and we will see real improvements.
#FireJudgeJeaninePirro for threatening violence on Joe Biden
We all know how this will go down - Biden will be touted as a master debater matter how incoherent he is. Trump will be called combative, defensive and a liar. Watch for it...
President Trump created more jobs in the past 3 months than Obama/Biden did in 8 whole years!!!
If I see any of y'all just go back to life as usual if Biden wins, I'm personally dragging you out of your house and flogging you in the streets.
Give one factual source proving that. Not an alleged speculation. Which you can’t.   There are countless cases with Joe Biden with photo evidence.
You support Joe Biden. That’s all that needs to be said
Biden just repeated the lie that Trump said “fine people on both sides”.
Honestly tho I'd vote for a Biden/Lucifer ticket Lucifer is based
I didn't know Biden served in Star Fleet. 😂👍🖖
Jason sudeikis and maya rudolph-biden harris!
You tell someone you dislike Biden and they wanna ask “so you’re voting for Trump?” No dickhead, they both are awful choices and it’s ok to say that
You thought you were witty. You support Biden. Here’s a meme for you and your peers, after the election when you’re all crying in hiding.
Biden and Harris are bad but Trump and Pence are easily worse
You support Biden. You’re a Secret Satanist. Your input value is 0.
Would it be fair then to say that VP Biden is no longer a 'practical Catholic'? While he is baptized into the Church, he is not living by the tenants of our faith.
Can you imagine actually believing that a former prosecutor, and ...um... Joe fucking Biden(?) are the narrow end of some far-left proletariat revolution as opposed to the Democratic Party's explicit rejection of it? Liz doesn't but she has to use the marketing buzzwords.
A lot of Athletes and Celebrities respond to people on social media.  All the places with looting and riots are in Democratic run States.  Its only going to be worst if Biden is elected.
These are also Democratic States.......Its makes you wonder what would happen if the Biden somehow gets elected, we are screwed for 4 years.  People will continue to bitch and moan.
woman physically removing Biden’s hand from her waist. Creepy joe. And u ppl want to elect this person?! I smell another Clinton scandal. Let’s Be real here ppl. Don’t give this creeper ur vote.
Is that why would you vote for Biden or why would go vote for Trump.
Whats a statement that has nothing to support it.  You cant elect someone just because you dont like the other person.  You might like it now but what can Biden provide "really provide and not lies to get votes" to keep America great that Trump created?
Everyone bashes #Trump,but look at #Biden, this woman had to physically remove his hands off her, cmon joe really??! We have another Bill on our hands, please don’t elect this creeper!
Nah, I don't think he could bring himself to retire, and I genuinely think his support for Biden is born from wanting to mitigate damage
What happens after Trump losses?  Will Biden be a good president?  Shouldn’t we expect more from him than be not Trump?
is experiencing signs of a concussion from that one, two punch he received when he heard about Biden/Harris
We knew this was going to happen. Please do not be surprised. Let’s get them elected. Biden/Harris are our Hope/Faith that we’re are going to Rebuild our country and restore the USA in the world stage. Stay FOCUSED.
You don’t seem to be as excited for Biden, you know the he will be the president? That’s is the higher position. Lol
I don’t think you’ll need to do that because with a Biden/Harris ticket tRump has no choice but to be evil with revenge or just walk out. Anyhow he’s gone.
We came out in force in Connecticut. Four year ago you we see Trump/Pence lawn sign. We did not see any this time. Going to get my Biden/Harris sign first thing in the morning. #BidenHarris2020
And she believes Biden accusers! Don’t forget that
Because it's all about her ambition. Everybody knows that Biden isn't capable of being President. He's cenile. Within a month, his cabinet will use the 25th ammendment.
I have been saying all along, if Biden wins the presidency his VP (now we know it's Harris) will be the POTUS within 6 months of the inauguration.
Right! Your voting Biden then?
The temptation to say something cynical about Joe Biden's Catholic faith is strong.  I will pray a rosary for both to seek common good, common ground, and common sense (the ASP's tag line).
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Now is a good time to keep your eyes on tRump for devious actions. Now that Harris in on Biden’s ticket tRump will try to cause trouble. Remember tRump does not care about Americans. He’s only concerned about himself.
OMG, I am soooo excited can hardly breathe! Biden Harris ticket....unstoppable! Glad he chose you! Soooo excited!!!!!
If Biden wins she will be president within 6 months of the inauguration any way. I wonder who she will pick to be VP when that happens
Can I ask you what the real reason why you are voting for Biden?  What policies of his do you support?  I want to know why people believe in Biden.  The only thing I keep seeing if that people don't like Trump &amp; won't vote for him.  I don't hear why people will be voting for him.
It's #KamalaHarrisForVP for #Biden
Biden picks Karmela Harris as running mate. Great job Joe. There is no competition now. You just blew tRump out of the water.
Biden is the Hypocratic Oath of candidates. “First, do no harm.”
Must have had a change of heart since she roasted Biden in the debate
Just saw this on Facebook and thought you would appreciate it 😂.              Three hardest jobs in America right now 1) Police Officer 2) Alaska crab fisherman 3) Sign language interpreter for Joe Biden
Nah I would rather sit and watch paint dry and watch you talk.   Joe Biden is a racist and a sex offender, so I’m sure you are glad you picked him!
Tucker rips lack of coverage of DC mass shooting, claims media silent to help Biden campaign  #FoxNews
I will vote for Biden if he picks a shoe as his running mate.
You know what I think? The only people voting for Biden are the die hards here on Twitter. Any clear thinking person in middle America wants four more years! Take it to the bank!
She was my pick for pres by far but I absolutely didn't want her as vp. If she were, the senate would've gained a gop and her abilities would have less impact as vp. And we really can't have 2 70+ candidates on the ticket. Wished it were warren not biden but ...go biden.
Can former president be VP’s?  Cause I’d be down for 8 more years of Biden/Obama!!?
Thank You Andrea 🌈👊🏻

Sounds like he's biden his time till this thread passes.

Wow now you are campaigning for Biden!  Interesting.  What are the reasons you believe he’s a “good catholic”? You like to disparage trump but Biden is a “good Catholic “ He supports the mutilization of babies, especially partial birth abortion. I’d like him to denounce abortion.
I heard a report that Biden is excited to find out who he picked for VP
What about Biden’s racist comment?
Considering it seems her dad and biden seemed fairly close and how kind biden was to her, you'd think she would vote for him. But even someone dumber than a box of rocks who was a sketchy husband is entitled to vote as they wish.
Trump “Biden will hurt God and the Bible “, from the guy who’s has been married 3 times and had a porn star spank his ass 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🌈👊🏻🇵🇷🇺🇸🇨🇦
It is only dangerous to Biden’s election prospects, that is what the media actually means when they call HCQ dangerous. If Trump liked lollipops those would be consideted very dangerous by the media too.
Biden is a pandering old fool, always has been only now he doesn’t even understand what he is pandering to.

I call BS on that poll. No more ‘dead close heated race.’ Biden couldn’t even pull 200 people together for a virtual gtg. This is what Dems want you to believe so they can throw the election with ballot harvesting and mail in voting. These polls are fabrications.
"We created more jobs in the last 3 months than Obama and Biden did in their two terms."  I mean come on.

Technically she is not. But that doesn’t matter. Elizabeth Warren was a Native American. Joe Biden is ‘intelligent’ so is AOC. Reality has no place on the modern dem party
100% agree. This is the team that almost killed the EU in order to "save" two countries (Syria and Libya) they ended up destroying. Biden's team should run screaming from these clowns...
Strange to see Carlson as a Biden pitch man.
Lol I already said I am not voting for Biden.  Alienating people who already agree with you is an unfortunate strategy
But it’s also fundamentally NOT mortal sin to vote for Biden. It is only a mortal sin to do so if it’s because of his abortion views. One can justify a vote for Biden because of one’s disgust for Trump. I’m not voting for Biden, but to say contrary to that is not church teaching
I don’t know why you took that as a defense of Biden
Woah wait a minute. I don’t support Biden and voted for the President. I’m just pointing out there is a pretty good reason for people to be skeptical of his pro life stance.
So is the sanctity of marriage a non negotiable. Trump’s role modeling of marriage with his divorces is evil as well. Not saying that it outweighs abortion, but both candidates are worse on different non negotiables. Biden is worse on abortion and Trump on marriage

Somthing just not fitting right with me that y’all want Biden over Kanye ???
Biden Selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as Running Mate
Let us know when David Duke switches his allegiance from Trump to Biden.
Everyone who’s saying they won’t vote/Choosing Biden/Harris is just bad: would you rather have 4 more years of tr*mp? And do you think the Green Party or other candidates will get enough traction to make it to the White House? Now is not the time for those dreams, time to vote
Overheard a man telling this other dude that he's voting for Biden because he's "cool with Obama".  I wanted to throw up.
So are we going to bounce between “Harris being a radical leftist who is pulling the strings on Biden” to “Harris isn’t really Black so that community shouldn’t be excited” until election day?
Pick a title that communicates their remit – the problem they should fix... Worry less about communicating the specific responsibilities.    #executive #CEO #CXO #leader #onboarding #onboard #leadership #lead #team #vicepresident #harris #Biden #president
Notice how we only hear “I’m voting against trump” but it’s never “I’m voting for Biden”  Yeah the DNC fucked up. The people wanted Bernie. He had a god damn movement. And if they had listened in 2016 then we wouldn’t be in this hot mess. But y’all ain’t ready to hear it
I know from 2016 this means 71 percent of voters will vote Biden. It's done folks ... Biden's got this in the bag!
Nice try Bill.   Its important for Americs to see Biden as one who has damaged mental capacity.
Can’t imagine a better rollout video.  All in for
“if and WHEN Biden decides to step aside” — got that?!
O, I was in a porno with Joe Biden screaming O
Right outside of Joe Biden's undisclosed basement, Kamala Harris gets to see her new campaign bus 🤭🤣
Help put the Clintons back into power. Vote Biden 2020.
It's got nothing to do with skin color ... That's what the LEFT focuses on.  On the RIGHT, we focus on policy ... Biden has an ever changing one and Kamala has NO policy.  DEMs are screwed ... Trump will beat Biden by even more than he beat Hillary!! 😃
Kamala Harris run for President by embracing the Radical Left  Attacking Joe Biden for racist policies  Voters spotted a phony and rejected #PhonyKamala  But not #SlowJoe, he's... well — slow — and just a “transition candidate” anyway 😱  #VoteDemsOUT #KAG2020
💥 Remember‼️  In the 2012 re-election campaign, Obama, Biden, Hillary Clinton, Susan Rice &amp; Co. were running as “successful” against Islamic terrorism.  So they—REPEATEDLY—denied additional security requests at our #Benghazi American diplomatic compound!
Hillary Is In The News?!  Remind Her Of Benghazi‼️  In the 2012 re-election campaign, Obama, Biden, Hillary Clinton &amp; Co. were running as “successful” against Islamic terrorism.  They—REPEATEDLY—denied security requests at our American diplomatic compound!
Lmfao didn’t kamala call joe Biden racist in the debates America is a fucking reality show...

U.S. Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate for the Democrat side of the 2020 Presidential Election race on Connecticut's Primary Day. #NewCanaan #Connecticut #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris #Democrats
Flat out lying to clients “Financial advisory firm Signum Global is already telling its clients that the choice of Harris reinforces the notion that the Democratic ticket is more moderate than progressive.”
I love Kamala and Biden too.
Fun to watch liberals try to wrap their heads around the fact that Biden is way too senile to confront anyone in a conversation let alone a debate.
Oh cry about it. WAH WAH all we have  are all the most powerful levers of the most powerful government in history at our disposal. Biden has the Delaware Dispatch bea in his pocket! It isn’t fair!!!

Joe Biden has a racism problem — Kamala Harris said as much!
If you become Biden's VP pick then You Ain't Black.
Let’s not forget when asked if “ she believes Joe Biden’s accusers “ yes she said I believe them . It’s all about picking a candidate based on identity politics

Yep...like okay great the republicans called the democrat too liberal.  Well no one believes Joe Biden is a socialist or a tool of the radical left. It doesn't hold any water precisely because of who they are saying it about.  Bernie on the other hand...
There is only Biden or Trump.  Not voting for Biden is a vote for trump. Period.
Someone tell Biden no sniffing her hair during an awkward embrace lol 😂
Trump and Biden on the debate stage is gonna be a battle of who has the most cognitive ability but Kamala and Pence, ohhh man it’s gonna be great seeing her tear his ass apart

5 Things to Know About Biden's VP Pick, Kamala Harris
Flashback: Kamala Harris Said She Believes Joe Biden's Accusers, "I Believe Them" (VIDEO)  via
Trump 2020. Or better yet, not Biden 2020.
You know.. if  had #LetYangSpeak at the convention I still would have been miffed about the #Kamela pick for VP, but I would still have grudgingly voted #Biden.    I'm instead going to #protest the DNC shenanigans by not voting for #Biden.
"Biden made a horrible choice, Monsoon." "What do you mean?" "The man just died. He can't be Vice President." "Not THAT Kamala! Pay attention!!"
If Biden gets elected he’d better not ever turn his back on Harris.
Trump, Pence, Biden, etc have spent their entire careers doing the same 🤷🏽‍♂️
So Joe Biden's email marketer is telling us that he isn't really going to be the president?
Not voting for Biden is a vote for trump. Fact.  Thats how he got in in 2016.
Biden/Harris - grateful for this ticket!!!
Harris checks all the boxes , but she bombed as a Presidential Candidate. And she seems to be running from her past as law &amp; order CA AG. For sure a capable partner to champion the ticket. Should Biden win, Harris will be President in probably a year
It was kind of obvious that Joe Biden has a good relationship with Kamala Harris - which he said was important because of his friendship with President Obama during their terms. She was clearly going to be the choice. :)  I like it!
She and Biden are also going to give Trump a beat down he will never forget.
Y’all can’t say black lives matter and vote for biden kamaela Harris Lmfaoooo she’s a ex cop
It will go a long way to helping me reconsider my #protest decision and decision of others to NOT VOTE #BIDEN.
This is a GREAT point.  Tells us a lot about Joe Biden.
Biden choosing Harris is such a work lol
Oh no, who is going to tell Biden that Kamala Harris died a few days ago?  BBC News - US wrestler James 'Kamala' Harris dies aged 70, WWE confirms
Being mechanical, rehearsed, and unable to connect will not matter if the media throws nothing but softballs her way. She'll be able to rehearse every answer in the same way she rehearsed her attack on Biden in the Dem. debates. She will avoid any difficult interviews. 😠
Biden just picked Kamala Harris for VP making history.
She must pay herself reparations. She wouldn't have the privilege of being Biden's running mate if her ancestors had not oppressed her other ancestors.
I'd respect it if people just tweeted:  "PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY VOTE BIDEN IN OFFICE, I DON'T CARE WHAT HE DOES OR SAYS- AS LONG AS IT'S NOT TRUMP!"   Instead of fake baby wanting people to "have a choice" to vote.  Stand with your mans B. Don't fake shit.
I don't believe Biden to be the lessor of 2 evils. I believe him to be an honest, God fearing man, who has the guts and moral conviction to know when he is wrong and admit it. A quality sadly lacking in so many.
Biden should, under NO circumstances announce his Cabinet picks. Then Trump could campaign against the cabinet picks, not the candidate. Would be disastrous IMHO.
It sucks. I'm not voting the #Biden ticket.   Biden is playing identity politics and I hate it.
Superrrrrrrr happy🇺🇸♥️🇺🇸♥️🇺🇸

Dems always overplay their hand.  Now they want to shut down football at Penn State, Ohio State, Michigan and Wisconsin. As soon as someone asks Biden his opinion on this, the election is over, whichever way he answers.
We have no good choice this election.  I don't think there's any question that Biden will not divide and polarize the country the way trump's rhetoric has. I'll take a moderate do-nothing over a divider any day. It's just a sad state all around.

Sounds like bad advice to me. Nov 3 is about defeating Donald Trump - that’s it.  Each cabinet member named means some subset of independents and NeverTrump Republicans deciding not to vote for Biden.  Keep it simple, bland and commit no unforced errors.
The over Botox face is just jealousy of Jill and Joe Biden, because Melania doesn’t want to do anything with her lying husband.   Did Pirro questioned why Pompous Pompeo took his wife everywhere he goes at taxpayers’ expense?
Republicans will say Joe Biden’s vp is just pandering to liberals. Then what the hell was Sarah Palin about?

It is DT who keeps projecting unfitness onto Biden. There are plenty of other things to impeach for.
That is missing the point. DT is constantly projecting, saying Biden is Sleepy Joe or physicall or mentally unfit. Biden talks openly about his stuttering.
Terrified that Trump has more supporters than we realize.   I have spoken with many who say good things about him and bash Biden—inaccurately.  Scared the polling isn’t accurate &amp; this bastard will win another 4 years.   Aside from voting what can we do to demolish this bastard?
That too. There are so many things. 🤦🏻‍♀️ But DT talks about Biden’s fitness and so shall we.
Biden's Dream Team.
It is a response to DT’s abilitist and ageist comments about Joe Biden. Not ripping on people who are old or disabled.
DT mocks Biden as Slerpy Joe. He mocks the disabled. Not sure why the FDR photo.
Now we learn that Russia is sabotaging Biden. Still waiting for Trump to tell Putin not to interfere.
Looks like folks can support Biden and be racist as well.  Have you  denounced the latest comments made by Joe?
Wasn’t this record played in 2008 and 2012?  i’m guessing Obama had to give back all the guns for Joe Biden to take them again?
Yeah this is just fucking disgusting. Conservatives whine about every Twitter pundit or YouTuber who calls them fascist, yet here is the 3rd or 4th most powerful Republican office holder in the country doing the same thing. Equivalent of Biden saying all Republicans are Nazis.

On Nov 4, should Biden lose, Dems will blame people who stayed home, or voted 3rd party. That’s what they did in 2004 and of course 2016.  They feel like they’re owed votes for not being the other guy. People in the streets from big cities to small towns see through it.
In 2020 we have the benefit of seeing Biden’s atrocious record on the environment, war &amp; militarism, policing, housing, immigration, etc.  So we aren’t excited about “shoot them in the leg” vs “shoot them in the chest.”
According to data the number one reason people are voting for biden is because he isn’t trump. The number one reason voters are voting for trump is cus of policy. This ...... is not good. Biden can win.... but why take that risk with such a demented candidate lmaoo kill me please
If you couple this with the facts that it’s 1. Hard to beat an incumbent president and 2. Voter suppression and the electoral college benefit republicans more..... I smell a repetition of history. Although the data shows Biden in the lead now, if the gap keeps closing... bye bye
Hmmm now I’m less optimistic about Biden’s chances. He still might have the advantage but trump is already closing in the polls BEFORE Biden has even been under the microscope and while trump had fucked up corona response. That’s truly scary lmaoo also let’s look at history
This is cool but it mostly brings home to me how freaking old Biden is. He was writing letters to Hannah Arendt as a US Senator and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1975!

It's so hard to tar and feather #BidenHarris as "radical Left" Bolsheviks bent on seizing your suburban ranch house, abolishing the police, because for 4 years radical Leftists have been screaming "BIDEN DUZNT SUPPORT SOCIALISM", "KAMALA IZ A COP".   Swing voters heard that.

To my followers: I hope yall bring that same scrutinizing energy you have about Trump/Pence to Biden/Harris if they win. Just because there's a change in political party doesn't mean they won't commit similar atrocious acts. No politician should be free from accountability.
Biden and Harris should be asked about what Uber is doing. But that’s because it’s an important public-policy issue, not because of Harris’s brother-in-law.
Hey your boy Biden is the corrupt one. Not Trump. There were numerous contacts between Burisma and the Obama State Department. Lies galore during the impeachment trial
What in Gods name is he talking about...Is he promising or threatening that she will cut my meat?  Pence goes after Biden-Harris ticket on meat, regulations
Is everybody in that administration stuck on stupid, the shits happened on your watch, if anything the Biden administration will have to clean up your shit. You can't make this stuff up.
This is good and not surprising. Her success is now tied to Biden's.

Progressive purity politics: “Trump and Biden are the same, because Trump probably won’t succeed in getting rid of the ACA. Oh and also the ACA is bad anyway, even though people would be dead without it.”

That’s true, but republicans have never respected the rules ever—any precedent set by democrats would be violated as a matter of course by them.  It’s not even clear slowing down the mail will help trump.  He needs every vote and some of Biden’s to win—he needs the mail to work.
One of those two tickets will be president. And even if you were maximally right and Biden did *literally nothing* to the status quo, you would have to think that that would be equally bad as getting rid of the ACA, which Trump would do, if you want to say that they’re “equal.”
You think that Biden, whose running mate explicitly supports M4A, is *literally* no less likely to spend his term trying to demolish the ACA than Trump?
“Biden knows that in building a strong team, it’s imperative to surround yourself with people who aren’t afraid to tell you exactly what they think — especially when they think you’re wrong.  Harris has the guts to do that for Biden, just as Biden.”  Yeah, sure, that happened. 🙄

What Reed has going for him is that Biden has known him for years. They served together in the Senate from 1997 through 2008.   McCaskill and Biden served together briefly, from 2007 through 2008.   Duckworth, like Kamala Harris, are both members of the Class of 2016.
Duckworth would make the most sense, given how she was almost chosen to be Biden's running mate.   Duckworth and Reed would both make sense, as Senators from safe blue states with Democratic governors.   Claire McCaskill holds no office, but seems to want to get back in the ring.

26. While Biden and Harris are expanding the electorate, the president and his allies are chasing after a base of power that’s getting smaller.
23. They are not attacking Harris so much as trying to bring back white voters who don’t want to vote for a racist (because they don’t think of themselves as racists) but will if Trump can show Biden and Harris are as bad or worse than he is.
21. By choosing her, and promising that she’ll govern as his equal, Biden is signalling to that part of the electorate that has never been represented that the time is coming—if and *only if* you do everything in your power to get everyone you know to go vote for me and Kamala.
19. Harris isn’t just “the perfect antidote to Trump’s anti-immigrant, anti-Black, xenophobic attitudes,” as USA Today’s Jill Lawrence and David Mastio wrote this morning.
17. Harris is a “do no harm” choice for white voters already set to vote for Biden. But a biracial daughter of immigrants who self-identifies as Black is more than “safe” for nonwhite voters like Baraki Sellers’ mom.
16. "But what you want my mama to do is, you want my mama to be on the phones, out in her community getting people to the polls, engaging her sorority. You want them to be active participants, and that’s what Kamala brings.”
15. Listen to how  put it to the San Francisco Chronicle before Biden’s announcement: “It’s not about getting those super-voters to the polls—those super-voters, they’re going to go the polls,” the author of My Vanishing Country said.
Poll: Biden Lead Over Trump Continues in Five of Six Battleground States
7. She may not seem the most comfortable fit as a governing partner, a quality Biden said he was seeking, but Harris was viewed as the safest pick to win in November.”
6.  Barack Obama’s advisor wrote today: “In the end, Biden seriously considered others but returned to Harris as the ‘do no harm’ candidate, unlikely to thrill or outrage many.
4. Consider, then, who Harris appeals to. It’s not voters who are already anti-Trump. As long as Biden didn’t pick Tulsi Gabbard or Marianne Williamson, they were going to support the Democratic nominee no matter who he picked.
2. Many people who are going to vote for Biden aren’t really voting *for* him. They are voting *against* the president, which means Biden is a secondary thought,
1. Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. The first thing we should say is that running mates almost never matter. They have very little effect on voter behavior, because voters usually just don’t care. Indeed, in the age of Donald Trump, they might care even less.
Calling it now. Biden dies before November
I agree she may not be a good politician. Just hard to see that she would be the minority they cap for to potentially takeover in a unlikely scenario where Biden doesn't complete his term.  But 🤷🏽‍♂️ I still hate this idea that he picked a minority to help propel them to the office.

Stop making excuses for Biden. He’s beyond any form of sanity. He’s completely lost.  You’re supporting a losing ticket.
Don’t be fooled.  Biden will be scripted the whole way through this election season because he’s too far gone cognitively to make any sense on his own.
There was a bigger crowd of Biden's supporters looting Chicago's Best Buy last night.
Your own daughter is supporting Biden/Harris. What does that tell ya!
Someone skimmed Isabel Wilkerson's new book, saw Biden's announcement, and got ahead of themself.
Too many of us focus on the outward facing deliverables &amp; appearance, at any cost, for the moment &amp; timeline, without considering the inner-workings to assure that deliverability sustains.  How are you sweating the small stuff?   #Leadership #strategy
Are his ignorant statements any worse than Biden telling me I'm not black if I vote for anyone but him? Everyone wants to tell black people who we are and how we think. It's old. 400 years old.
For the people reacting negatively about Biden's selection, consider what a shit stain like tRump does to LGBTQIA....
We hit below the barrel when Trump became President. We’ve been struggling to the top for nearly 4 yrs. We are now seeing the glimmer of hope with Biden/Harris on the ballot!  Nothing is gonna stop us now from righting the wrong of 2016 election. NOTHING!!!!
Joe Biden could not have picked a better running mate. What an "Impactful" selection!
Kamala Harris Gives New Meaning to the Biden Campaign
Everybody on my TL who trashes Biden, Harris, or Biden/Harris is getting unfollowed
if anything people are only voting for biden cause they passionately hate trump being in office
trump wins cause his constituents are passionate (some passionately racist) ... no one is passionate about electing biden and kamala
I'd've thought she'd be a terrible pick, period. Do you think the only reason she was picked is because she's the only other candidate Biden seriously considered who also ran in the primary, so he's thinking she has experience running a campaign &amp; can help his flailing one? 🤔
Both political parties practice white supremacy especially the Democrats specifically Biden and Harris. I call out Democrats because they pretend to care about black people. Wolf vs fox
im mad that the dems had 4 years to choose a candidate and they chose fuccing joe biden ... they thought him being Obama’s VP would be enough to get votes and it’s insulting
biden off da goop :/
Look at lgbtq+ rights under this administration and the judges he puts up. Compare that to her and Biden policy. Look into the policy.
imo, we need to vote with the mindset of the collective and not individually. right now the collective is working towards getting #45 out so voting for biden is how ill be supporting this part of the movement- regardless of if he deserves it. both/and
word i hear that. i agree too. its all a bunch of bullshit and honestly a twisted game. ill be voting for biden in nov, not bc i want to, but bc the visionaries in politics think its the best move right NOW to get us to a better place LATER.
I hope Biden and Kamala dont go on a black vote pandering spree...
I am still absolutely going to vote for the Biden Kamala ticket because I understand the importance of this election, but people need to stop invalidating people’s gut reaction to the news that the VP pick is someone whose past actions as the attorney general of CA have
The Biden campaign has said it plans a rollout that blends the historic nature of Harris’ selection with the realities of the 2020 campaign and the gravity of the nation’s circumstances.
The only way Trump will win is by cheating. It’s not because Joe Biden chose Kamala.
your hero who's a 79 year old, white straight Male and represents a state with the SECOND lowest black population in #America, ALSO voted for the #CrimeBill just like Biden. Let's be fair and consistent
- all cops are bastards - weed should be legal - trans lives matter  harris legit put trans women in men’s prisons.  i’ll probably end up voting for biden anyway just because 4 more years of trump will literally hurt the people around me. i just wish it were bernie.
I’m not considering not voting, Dan. I never said that in my original tweet. I’m just saying that it goes against my own personal beliefs and everything I’ve gone against to support biden and harris just because it’s the “lesser of two evils”
Raise your hands if you are Riden’ with Biden/Harris !!
yep im no genius when it comes to predicting the VP pick impact on voters, just didnt seem like bass v harris would change that much. imo bass is a true progressive and an amazing coalition builder and I thought she had real potential to grow the base.
Democrat Biden and new running mate Harris to make first campaign appearance  Very exciting! This IS the team, that will #DefeatTrump in #November #BidenHarris2020
it would literally be against everything I support to vote for Biden/Harris. what do i do, vote for Biden because he’s slightly better than trump? then that makes me feel like a dick voting for a rapist and a cop
If Harris learned anything from past debates, she will have to be disruptive and raucous. Thats the only way to win VP debates. Thats what Biden did to Ryan in 2012 and got momentum back for Obama.
Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals  #FoxNews   Criminals helping criminals  -THAT'S what biden/harris have for us

In defense of Kamala and her time as a prosecutor. It was the 90s, and public attitudes were very much in favor of getting tough on crime. That 1994 crime bill that people given Biden shit for now - it had a 97% approval rating when it passed.

The Kamala Harris Pick: Geographic Balance Takes Back Seat to Gender, Race
Our  colleague,  published an op-ed in  about Kamala Harris, writing "[Biden's] decision to pick Kamala Harris as his running mate seems like a personal gift to me."
Did I read correctly that she knew Beau Biden? She will be an amazing conscience for Biden, at we have already seen that she doesn't pull her punches.
The current state of the Democratic party as told by quotes from Hamilton: Warren: Treasury or State? Harris: ...So what did I miss? Biden: They shall all sit under their own vines and under their own fig trees, and no one shall make them afraid
I’ve actually learned a lot about how my personal faith intersects with my political views from Biden debates/speeches. He’s talked about this a lot in interesting ways and it’s such a disservice to the man, as well as his faith, to demean him like that.
Seriously. What makes it the most disgusting is that Biden IS catholic! It’s so unbelievably gross for clergy to opine like this on someone who is not their parishioner.
Tbf to Nate he put his money where his mouth is and gave Biden a significantly lower chance than other models
Kamala Harris called Biden a racist and she believes his sexual accusers! Ned, your right this is a great ticket!

A candidate that people will believe won,(with all the fraud planned) that won't happen with Biden/Harris This I feel will lead to Biden not being the nominee after the convention. The question is who will be on the Democratic ticket??? what do you think?
The two people who they feel would have a better chance for the American people to believe won a rigged election.  Biden is a weak candidate and with Harris, as his running mate, he is even weaker. so they go to the convention and the Sanders Followers and the establishment want
I have been thinking... Joe Biden Picked Harris to be his running mate. They both have baggage, and neither is very popular with voters. So I am wondering if this was a setup? follow me her a min. I am thinking maybe this is how the DEMS can have a brokered convention and place
"Kamala is gonna kick Pence's ass!"  What world do you- We're not voting for Pence or Harris, we're voting for Biden or Trump. Stop getting distracted. Harris can't fix Biden; she can't make the decisions that he'll make. How many times do you blame Pence for what Trump does???

That’s a great question actually.  Who would have to be the VP nominee for you NOT to vote for Biden? 1. Hitler 2. Satan 3. Jim Jordan?
how is joe biden responsible for a now-retired judge’s decision in virgina tho
This is gonna kill Biden's ratings in the swing states IMO. He could have chosen a neutral, moderate Democrat- instead he chooses a radical Leftist who slept her way to the top and racebaits every chance she gets. She would be as bad as Obama in the White House
Maybe Kamala and Biden can LEGALIZE it

Wow that's so good and helpful in understanding Biden.
Very excited about Kamala Harris being chosen as Biden’s running mate! Great choice, great ticket!!!
Just bought my Biden/Harris lawn sign. Time to unite and Dump the Turd on Nov. 3rd.

after seeing Biden &amp; Harris photoshopped onto Cardi B &amp; MTS, I'm doubling down on the previous tweet
To me the most interesting thing about Biden picking Kamala for VP is he did it the same week we lost wrestling legend James "Kamala" Harris.  Maybe he just saw Kamala trending and got the wrong idea.
I knew it. How many times did I say he was going to choose Kamala? I think and hope this will make a Trump victory easier.
He will find away to bring the focus back to him (negatively) will not steal my joy. BIDEN/HARRIS 2020.

The way it looks, that's really up to Mitch Mcconnell who successfully kept those seats warm during Obama's presidency and less on Biden.  It would be also more on Amy McGrath, a pro-Trump Democrat to unseat Mitch rather than Biden.
i think there’s a 50/50 chance of biden either dying or developing dementia while in office
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate
#Trump says Biden picking a woman for VP is an insult to men.
Thank goodness Biden doesn’t waste his time worrying about grudges, spite, and revenge.
Not overly excited about Harris as VP but she's at least competent. She's also a good debater, which will be important.   So all-in-all, Biden's VP pick is much better than Hillary's.  Harris &gt; Kaine
A different administration would handle this pandemic much better. It's just not going to be the Biden Administration.  He saw this pandemic and still said healthcare should still be in private interests. Also he shown he will support the police when the state fails its citizens.
Biden will win 2020 and then the Democrats will run Trump for 2024
maybe, if you're a film critic who thinks about tweeting "a Biden / Hitler ticket would be better than Trump," you should rethink that tweet
Ned - Harris says she believes Joe Biden’s sexual accuser.  Do you agree with her?

Kamala Harris, Biden's V.P. Pick, Is First Woman of Color on Major Party Ticket
Trump really stupidly boxed himself by running ads painting Biden as too soft on crime. There is real grounds to go after Kamala's AG record by they can't do it without undercutting their own message now
Even with all the small victories of progressive candidates entering the democratic party in an attempt to reform it, I feel that the American Act of voting is largely performative.  The upper class will always push us to vote for a lesser of 2 evils.  I can't vote for Biden.
This is pretty fair imo. Biden world also clearly tries to push Biden in a more petty direction and he said no
Because he was - and continues to be - a grade A douche.

I’m being censored right now when I suggest Kamala dna Biden are the Whore and the Hobbit. They never censor people for much more outrageous statements against our President
Sure. I also think it's reasonable to think about Senate seats for a Senator from a state with a GOP governor. So basically: who so we want to be president, choosing among humans that aren't Joe Biden and aren't a Senator with a GOP governor? That is the correct question.
Happy to hear the news about Sen.

Vote for Biden anyway, of course!
But if school reopening goes badly his numbers could easily go off a cliff, and that combined with a potential anti-Biden wave in 2022 could make him quite vulnerable.
That’s ridiculous—Biden loves to take questions. Usually can’t get him out of the room.  Didn’t take questions the other day because it was a formal announcement speech.
Campaign in need of cash? You’re a stooge. Check the FEC records you lying has been. Biden is FLUSH w cash. Trump is so down in polls he’s running ads on Fox! Call the wifey home. She’s gone in 83 days.
Individual 1 should go back and checked what Biden said in JANUARY, while he was having his cult gatherings.
Somebody at the FBI definitely needs to interview her concerning this threat to Biden--what does she know and who does she think is going to harm him?
"Stop playing politics with the virus" is actually a good line. Completely disingenuous, hypocritical, and fraudulent, but actually the classic response to the DEVASTATING attack that Biden and Harris made on him yesterday. Don't "play politics" when I kill people--just mourn.

Wall Street was fearful of a Biden/Warren ticket.
The communist party is very much alive and well. They are thoroughly entrenched in the USA and their goal has been and continues to be the complete dismantling and destruction of the country. Vote Biden to help them.
Nah.  It’s a system that’s been around far longer than DeBlasio. He was just anointed as a candidate.  Used to be called Tammany Hall.
I agree Bill. It’s painful, but I think Biden has to go through the gauntlet and do it. Otherwise he just looks too wimpy. He needs to endure the indignity of it. And I think his presidential-ness will blow Trump’s coarseness and sophomoric-ness away.
Does anyone ever notice that Biden is in much better physical shape than Trump?  Trumps body... certainly ain’t no temple!
#Biden and the   has shown their true colors.  Holding out hope that they'll give Yang a #cabinet position is an exercise in futility.  I'll support local Dems.. I cannot support Biden/Kammy.
If you're going to donate $$$ #donate it to local candidates that you #believe in.    They'll need the money a ton more than Biden/Kammy will.
I’m pretty sure it’s not in Biden’s job description to marry people! He was making a political, pandering statement. And you bought it.the baker doesn’t have to make the cake, but govnmt clerks must follow the law. If against their conscience they need a new job.
You still have not explained why you think Biden would have done a better job, considering he said publicly he wouldn’t have shut down travel from China or Europe .
This person hasn’t said one thing that Biden would have done to manage this differently. Maybe because he publicly said he would have kept allowing travel from everywhere and hundreds of thousands more people would have died
So Biden would have shut Europe down but not China? Not sure where you are going with this. Explain what Joe would have done better
Did you agree with Biden when he said Trump was xenophobic for shutting down China travel ? Explain how Biden would have done a better job.
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
I think ideological purity is a bad thing to demand in a candidate. I also think there were better options than Biden. But this is where we’re at. I’m doing what’s right, rather than making a statement over how I wished things were.
Dr. Gary Rose, a political expert, told News 12 that Sen. Kamala Harris – the first Black female to run on a major party's presidential ticket – is exactly what Joe Biden needs.
Were you with Biden when he said he would not shut down travel from China or.. ? What has he mismanaged exactly?
Biden and Harris are so wrong about everything and stating nonsense. Only uniformed ignorant people would believe or back them. Unbelievable!!
Listen, I finally looked at your page, and being gay seems to define you. You know you twisted my words. To be a practicing Catholic, you must practice the faith. Biden doesnt. Do I think Aborigines who never heard of Jesus need to be Catholic to go to heaven? Of course not.
❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Based on the reaction from the left (yes, she is left), 90 % of them want Biden to drop out.
Totally different as Being Jewish is not considered a grave sin in the teachings of the Catholic faith. Why do you have a problem with this? You cannot promote abortion, homosexuality and say you are a good Catholic. Biden is free to find a religion that meets his beliefs.
Already planting the seed for Biden to step down. Embarrassing.
So are we going to bounce between “Harris being a radical leftist who is pulling the strings on Biden” to “Harris isn’t really Black so that community shouldn’t be excited” until election day?
Good grief.  Same guy who last week was blaming Biden for crime bill. Needs to figure out what he’s talking about.
Notice how we only hear “I’m voting against trump” but it’s never “I’m voting for Biden”  Yeah the DNC fucked up. The people wanted Bernie. He had a god damn movement. And if they had listened in 2016 then we wouldn’t be in this hot mess. But y’all ain’t ready to hear it
I think the hypocrisy is Biden claiming,every opportunity he gets, that he is Catholic. This pic is like showing a  self proclaimed vegan eating a steak. You don’t have to agree with Catholicism to see his insincerity.
O, I was in a porno with Joe Biden screaming O
Help put the Clintons back into power. Vote Biden 2020.

I dont get it. Isnt Biden Catholic?
I love Kamala and Biden too.
Fun to watch liberals try to wrap their heads around the fact that Biden is way too senile to confront anyone in a conversation let alone a debate.
Biden / Harris? Yes! Yes, please!

If you want Kamala Harris for president vote for Joe Biden.
If you want a president who will always read from some prepared handler script vote for Joe Biden.

Why Kamala Harris was picked as Joe Biden’s running mate
Biden is Catholic and goes to church every Sunday
Trump and Biden on the debate stage is gonna be a battle of who has the most cognitive ability but Kamala and Pence, ohhh man it’s gonna be great seeing her tear his ass apart
Certainly skipping phase 3 human trials helped push them to the front...(Why didn’t we think of that??)
And Kamala Harris is a moderate. In my view this was the soundest pick Biden could have made, balancing everything out. One indication of a sound mind is a sound decision like this.  Much better VP choice than the last woman VP candidate, Sarah Palin, picked by McCain.
Biden is sick . Uh huh, Just like Hillary was so sick last time, right? That was BS about Hilary and this is BS about Joe now. Better to stick with the facts when you make a point.
And when President Biden honors Madam Vice President and Madam Speaker from the rostrum of the Capitol...wow!
Joe Biden’s choice of Kamala Harris as made her the third woman to run as a VP candidate on a major US presidential party ticket. As well as the first female African American and first person of Indian descent.
You know.. if  had #LetYangSpeak at the convention I still would have been miffed about the #Kamela pick for VP, but I would still have grudgingly voted #Biden.    I'm instead going to #protest the DNC shenanigans by not voting for #Biden.
I'm a Vote Blue No Matter Who guy, but that doesn't mean I'm not also dancing in celebration over a Biden/Harris ticket. This election can't come soon enough!
Trump, Pence, Biden, etc have spent their entire careers doing the same 🤷🏽‍♂️
Biden/Harris - grateful for this ticket!!!
It was kind of obvious that Joe Biden has a good relationship with Kamala Harris - which he said was important because of his friendship with President Obama during their terms. She was clearly going to be the choice. :)  I like it!
It will go a long way to helping me reconsider my #protest decision and decision of others to NOT VOTE #BIDEN.
Me refreshing the Biden website for  merch
Whose voting for Biden just to see  in the Oval Office?! Me. I am. 🙋🏽‍♀️ #VicePresident #OvalOffice #BidenHarris2020

I"m sorry  I'm not liking this.  I've decided to not vote for #Biden due to this choice.

Botox Pirro seems to have problem with Dr. Biden on the campaign trail with her husband.   Jealousy is killing these people.

Hi Greenwich 🙂 Power back on. Thank the electricity gods,,, because #eversource was a total failure. Still no TV or internet yet. Now its on  Optimum. Hopefully it doesn't take forever
Biden wasn't my 1st,2nd or 5th choice....but I'm voting for him for sure. I like Warren ,&amp; I'm sure there is a spot for her in his administration.  Ideally,I'd love Harris or Rice as his pick.
OMG! My husband uses thta phrase all the time!  And, I’d wait in line for days, in the cold and rain, to vote for Biden!
I meant Gov Lamont. Malloy was done in 2019. oops
Biden pick someone with thick skin because trump's going to attack whoever it is but it shouldn't matter because maybe SILENT MAJORITY will put aside their Racism , vote their interests trump's interests not middle class ,poor people Billionaires and Millionaires are trump's

Isn’t “Biden doesn’t deserve the Black vote” also a claim that there is some monolith? Doing the same thing it criticizes
Are you talking about Biden or Trump? If it’s Biden, okay, not ideal. But again Trump is literally about 10X worse in terms of sexual predation and corruption. Not in the same ballpark!
Its not ideal. But youve cherry picked the worst. If you cherry pick the worst of your father, it would be equally bad. But the bigger picture is Biden is much more qualified than your father - in knowledge, experience, ability to hire and listen to talent, and character.
Biden with certainty will usher in less chaos than what we’ve had under DJT.
Probably for the best.. the VP position doesn't have much power other than maybe the chance of becoming president if Biden steps down. Name recognition gets a boost but Yang probably will be more effective in a cabinet position.
What IF #Biden forgets about choosing a woman and ends up choosing #AndrewYang?    Are we in taht timeline? 🤔
Westport (Fairfield county) is a nightmare. Malloy has called for disaster relief. Connecticut ain't gonna get a dime from the fed. We voted for the email lady. #Eversource #poweroutage

The bar is so low with Trump that “well he can ride a bike” is a bit positive for Biden.
Biden could shoot my dog on 5th Avenue and I would still vote for him. And my dog is awesome. Best dog ever!!

There is absolutely no need for Joe Biden to “clarify” all of his racist comments over the past 50 years. They are all quite succinct and to the point.
The Presidency, Our Borders, &amp; System of Government in America are UNDER ATTACK. Vote Biden 2020 to finish the job.
Why do I think Trump is as dumb as a rock and dangerously out of whack? He said Biden wants to "hurt the bible, hurt God. "
If Biden were in a coma I would vote for him. It's not about Joe. It's about getting rid of the worst blot in the history of our great country

Biden should definitely debate Trump! I believe it could be major eye opener for those who are, for whatever reason 🤯 , still undecided. I truly believe Biden would humiliate Trump in any debate as Trump is in way over his head on so many issues. #VoteBidenHarris2020
First of all it is CASES, with an s. Second no I wouldn’t expect him to comment but to at least cooperate since he says he is innocent. If he is the facts will show he is innocent. Biden was willing to cooperate
I would be certainly outraged. We have that in common. But the record is 1 accuser to 20 something. There is a pattern. Biden’s accuser was proven to have lied multiple time about the incident, none of Trumps has.
The fact that u wont waste your years in office tweeting out dangerous opinions &amp; conspiracy theories to fit your own agenda, instead of governing is a huge plus in my book! Biden has just 5407 tweets verses Trump currently at 54.4 tweets &amp; the day is young😳 #VoteBidenHarris2020

Joe biden should bring a lie detector to the presidential debate and hook it up to donald trump and ask trump to tell the truth.. I would pay to see it explode. Who's with me?
Miller is working the crowd in advance of the event hoping by building up Biden to make Trump's performance seem better before it ever happens.  Point in fact: in a TV studio with NO audience and just the debaters and moderators, Trump will fail badly.
I just Googled about Biden’s stance on the police.    Here’s an article for consideration:

On Nov 4, should Biden lose, Dems will blame people who stayed home, or voted 3rd party. That’s what they did in 2004 and of course 2016.  They feel like they’re owed votes for not being the other guy. People in the streets from big cities to small towns see through it.
In 2020 we have the benefit of seeing Biden’s atrocious record on the environment, war &amp; militarism, policing, housing, immigration, etc.  So we aren’t excited about “shoot them in the leg” vs “shoot them in the chest.”
According to data the number one reason people are voting for biden is because he isn’t trump. The number one reason voters are voting for trump is cus of policy. This ...... is not good. Biden can win.... but why take that risk with such a demented candidate lmaoo kill me please
If you couple this with the facts that it’s 1. Hard to beat an incumbent president and 2. Voter suppression and the electoral college benefit republicans more..... I smell a repetition of history. Although the data shows Biden in the lead now, if the gap keeps closing... bye bye
Hmmm now I’m less optimistic about Biden’s chances. He still might have the advantage but trump is already closing in the polls BEFORE Biden has even been under the microscope and while trump had fucked up corona response. That’s truly scary lmaoo also let’s look at history
This is cool but it mostly brings home to me how freaking old Biden is. He was writing letters to Hannah Arendt as a US Senator and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1975!
Trump reflected a ‘grotesque image’ of the American voter — can Biden and Harris reflect something better?
Didn't Kamala Harris believe Joe Biden's accusers? 😩
theres dozens of messages being sent  by not voting for biden, and while its important to understand the validity and significance behind all of them, the loudest and by far the most impactful message is that you don't mind another 4 years of trump
Once again a vote for Biden is a vote for this evil woman to be are president
Biden doesn’t even remember who the Democrats picked for him I’m sorry I feel bad for the man he’s sick and nobody cares
If you don’t vote for Biden, Trump gets back in. Apparently your not crazy about Trump anymore either
ABC if Full of Shit. Joe Biden will not win the Presidency in November 2020. He is too forget full about even his own words half the time. He even forgets when he is reading from a Teleprompter if he takes his eyes 👀 off it for a few seconds! How in the Hell is he going to Run!
He have no platform. I checked his website. Look at Joe Biden website. You will see his platform.

PENCE: The selection of California liberal Senator Kamala Harris as Joe Biden&amp;#039;s running mate simply confirms everything President Trump and I have been saying about Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.

She spoke in absolutes and called the pandemic preventable.  When he closed travel in Feb Biden said he was xenophobic.  We are a country larger than France, the UK,  Italy and Spain put together.  Of course, we have larger numbers of death and infection than others.
Of course not!! They just want to control us!! DON’T let them at all!Dr. Siegel tells Tucker Carlson there is 'no science' behind Biden's mask mandate

60 seconds doesn't give her enough time to complain about how Sanders was cheated out of the nomination AGAIN, &amp; how Biden isn't progressive enough for her idea of the Democratic party.
Stick to your bumper sticker politics. Full your head with QAnon and Alex Jones conspiracy. Get your fill of bubble gum reporting through OANN. Leave the important stuff to the adults. Criticize Biden or Harris’s past and support Trump. Brilliant.

Like I said, we all need to prepare for a permanent pandemic. Resistance to Biden is going to be resistance to masks and vaccines.
Biden has probably been on both sides of the debate!at some point.
I’ll bet you on this part: Between Joe Biden and his Vice President, I know that they have my vote! 🗳 Just saying that.

It's so hard to tar and feather #BidenHarris as "radical Left" Bolsheviks bent on seizing your suburban ranch house, abolishing the police, because for 4 years radical Leftists have been screaming "BIDEN DUZNT SUPPORT SOCIALISM", "KAMALA IZ A COP".   Swing voters heard that.

Biden Campaign Slams Trump for "Sabotaging" Postal Service
Progressive purity politics: “Trump and Biden are the same, because Trump probably won’t succeed in getting rid of the ACA. Oh and also the ACA is bad anyway, even though people would be dead without it.”
I don't have hard data but anecdotally the ratio of men to women accused must be astronomical. It just seemed like such a odd case for the NYT to take stand against Title IX with. But my prediction now is that when Biden gets in they'll implement a sort of Title IX+. They'll
That’s true, but republicans have never respected the rules ever—any precedent set by democrats would be violated as a matter of course by them.  It’s not even clear slowing down the mail will help trump.  He needs every vote and some of Biden’s to win—he needs the mail to work.
One of those two tickets will be president. And even if you were maximally right and Biden did *literally nothing* to the status quo, you would have to think that that would be equally bad as getting rid of the ACA, which Trump would do, if you want to say that they’re “equal.”
You think that Biden, whose running mate explicitly supports M4A, is *literally* no less likely to spend his term trying to demolish the ACA than Trump?
“Biden knows that in building a strong team, it’s imperative to surround yourself with people who aren’t afraid to tell you exactly what they think — especially when they think you’re wrong.  Harris has the guts to do that for Biden, just as Biden.”  Yeah, sure, that happened. 🙄

21. In the hours since Biden’s tapped Kamala Harris as his running mate, the president had waded farther into the slough of sadism. The farther he goes, according to critics, the stronger Biden gets. Well, maybe, depending on the size of November’s electorate.
10. They’d rather think the way Nate Silver and his team thinks—Trump has this or that much chance of losing, Biden has this or that much chance of winning, giving the impression that the country is this close to returning to normal.

Fox News's Delusional and idiot Jeanine Pirro tries to walk back ominous prediction about Joe Biden:  via
I'm guessing responses will be:  - "He's being sarcastic." - "It was going to fail anyway." - "Universal mail-in voting is worth sabotaging the post office." - "It's Obama's fault." - "Biden smelled women's hair so it's okay." - "You made that fake news clip with Photoshop."
What Reed has going for him is that Biden has known him for years. They served together in the Senate from 1997 through 2008.   McCaskill and Biden served together briefly, from 2007 through 2008.   Duckworth, like Kamala Harris, are both members of the Class of 2016.
Duckworth would make the most sense, given how she was almost chosen to be Biden's running mate.   Duckworth and Reed would both make sense, as Senators from safe blue states with Democratic governors.   Claire McCaskill holds no office, but seems to want to get back in the ring.

Not the trump campaign putting the Texas chainsaw massacre spooky camera sound behind Biden’s racial gaffes 😂😂😂
He's telling white Republicans who might vote for Biden that she's no better than Trump, most likely worse, since she's pretending to be something she is not, so they should vote for Trump as defender against unknown evils. This is cynicism in pure form.
Biden and Harris must win this election. But if they run another Wall Street Big Tech crony show, the next wanna be fascist will be the real thing. If the left doesn’t get to do liberation, the right is poised to do it for them.
Amazing that Biden and Harris could put aside their differences and unite to run. Maybe you could learn a thing or 2 or a million from that. THAT is what makes America great. Not your product based Maga B.S.
And Biden said he didn’t want his kids to go to school in a “racial jungle” 🤦🏻‍♂️
What she is saying is she hopes that one of Trumps MAGA goons does something to stop Biden....

Um.. Biden is doing some awfully good knee-bends for a 'low energy candidate.'
Seems like the 'Biden is not fit' trope took a bit of a hit too.
I have come to the conclusion that you liberals are fucked in the head this Vice President pick is the same one who called Biden a raciest lol you all should be committed
Maybe meet us halfway? Maybe Biden shouldn’t say he’d literally VETO Medicare for all? Sorry to whine when people can’t afford a goddamn epi pen after the miraculous ACA 🙄
Such a phony I remember during the Presidential Debates that you practically called Biden a racist!
".. Mr Biden...thinks the nature of Ms Harris’s candidacy will do at least as much as choosing Ms Warren or Ms Abrams would have done to boost turnout where he needs help: among young and non-white voters."
It probably doesn’t help ease concerns about his health for Joe Biden to say his VP is the stuff of Presidents.
What would  say about  for secretary of state in Biden cabinet? Dying to know! IMHO if Susan Rice is odds-on favorite (2-1), Murphy is a plausible dark horse (15-1)
Bashing Biden-Harris 24/7 on social media only helps Trump.
To what extent is it conventional wisdom that Harris will become president some time during Biden's first term?  I don't think it is, but someone suggested it was.   Thoughts?

I still think it’s an oversight to equate them as people... sure, Biden isn’t great; he’s ignorant and racist (but far less so) and in regards to his pedophilia he doesn’t have the 22+ allegations against him, the audio tapes, and the same ties as Trump does. Still bad though.
By choosing her, Biden is signalling to a part of the electorate never represented before that the time is coming when a Black woman will be president—if and **only if** you do everything in your power to get everyone you know to go vote for me and Kamala. THREAD
I understand and agree with your sentiment, but I still feel like there’s a difference in levels between Biden and Trump as people.

‘Don’t talk about racism, racist’: Trump scorched after claiming Biden-Harris campaign has a ‘racism problem’ – Raw Story
26. While Biden and Harris are expanding the electorate, the president and his allies are chasing after a base of power that’s getting smaller.
23. They are not attacking Harris so much as trying to bring back white voters who don’t want to vote for a racist (because they don’t think of themselves as racists) but will if Trump can show Biden and Harris are as bad or worse than he is.
21. By choosing her, and promising that she’ll govern as his equal, Biden is signalling to that part of the electorate that has never been represented that the time is coming—if and *only if* you do everything in your power to get everyone you know to go vote for me and Kamala.
19. Harris isn’t just “the perfect antidote to Trump’s anti-immigrant, anti-Black, xenophobic attitudes,” as USA Today’s Jill Lawrence and David Mastio wrote this morning.
17. Harris is a “do no harm” choice for white voters already set to vote for Biden. But a biracial daughter of immigrants who self-identifies as Black is more than “safe” for nonwhite voters like Baraki Sellers’ mom.
16. "But what you want my mama to do is, you want my mama to be on the phones, out in her community getting people to the polls, engaging her sorority. You want them to be active participants, and that’s what Kamala brings.”
15. Listen to how  put it to the San Francisco Chronicle before Biden’s announcement: “It’s not about getting those super-voters to the polls—those super-voters, they’re going to go the polls,” the author of My Vanishing Country said.
Poll: Biden Lead Over Trump Continues in Five of Six Battleground States
7. She may not seem the most comfortable fit as a governing partner, a quality Biden said he was seeking, but Harris was viewed as the safest pick to win in November.”
6.  Barack Obama’s advisor wrote today: “In the end, Biden seriously considered others but returned to Harris as the ‘do no harm’ candidate, unlikely to thrill or outrage many.
4. Consider, then, who Harris appeals to. It’s not voters who are already anti-Trump. As long as Biden didn’t pick Tulsi Gabbard or Marianne Williamson, they were going to support the Democratic nominee no matter who he picked.
2. Many people who are going to vote for Biden aren’t really voting *for* him. They are voting *against* the president, which means Biden is a secondary thought,
1. Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. The first thing we should say is that running mates almost never matter. They have very little effect on voter behavior, because voters usually just don’t care. Indeed, in the age of Donald Trump, they might care even less.
Calling it now. Biden dies before November
Kamala’s track record with prison sentences is terrible as well... she’s the opposite of police and prison reform tbh. But as you say I’m still taking her and Biden over trump/pence in a heartbeat.
Then you living under a rock because Biden is not capable of tieing his own shoes let alone run a country open your eyes
Do your research you might be surprised at what you find Biden is the raciest here enough said
Because Biden is a raciest he has been his whole life
I agree she may not be a good politician. Just hard to see that she would be the minority they cap for to potentially takeover in a unlikely scenario where Biden doesn't complete his term.  But 🤷🏽‍♂️ I still hate this idea that he picked a minority to help propel them to the office.
Wow have you been living under a rock??? Biden has serious cognitive decline everybody knows it and sees it, the Democrats only endorsed Biden because they can control ever aspect of him they know he can’t run this country on his own

Be weary of those who believe Biden's pick for Kamala is just a ploy to get her into office (as if he'll step down within his presidency).  People love to believe that minorities can't win it on their own merits.
the justification i see of people saying "Settle for Biden" or "atleast he's better than Trump" is the most asinine political drivel I have ever heard

There was more to the convo, mainly her just being a pacifist to Biden &amp; Kamala and me not feeling that. It ended with her asking if I was gonna vote, me saying yes even though I’m far from happy w the choices, &amp; her saying “Well, anything is better than what we have right now.”
I then had to explain her track record and Biden’s. She was surprised to hear it, which means she didn’t even know. Then she’s like “Well, some time has passed, maybe they changed.”
Insane how the same people self righteously and without thought screaming BLM, abolish the police, defund the police, fuck the police, no more jails, etc. are the same people now saying “shut up” to those who don’t like biden the architect of the modern prison state + an enforcer

When Bernie Sanders was the only candidate calling to condition aid to Israel (a microscopically “progressive” position given Israel is an apartheid state), Biden and Harris leapt to the defense of Israel and promised to never touch the slush fund of $10 million every day.

Find out what The Breakfast Club thinks about Biden picking Senator Harris as his running mate!
Joe Biden says his “commitment to Israel is completely unshakable.”  Kamala Harris calls Israel “a beautiful home to democracy and justice,” and when asked whether they adhere to international standards of human rights, she said “overall, yes.”

So what I saw yesterday is that Biden has a very Big Basement. Don't you know the old saying "Starting from the Ground Level leads to Success" But seriously that is one Huge, Big Basement he &amp; Kamala were in yesterday. Huge or as Trump would say "Bigly, Beautiful Basement"
Before Obama-Biden, I don’t think either W. Bush or Cheney were Catholic and I don’t think either Bill Clinton or Gore were either.

This is going to be hilarious because Biden was bullied by Black folks demanding a Black woman VP and he chooses Blue Lives Matter Kamala Harris. When this blows up in Biden’s face and he loses bc of it what will the Dems do next.. 🤔🤔
If Biden doesn’t get elected we're basically electing Donald Trump for president.

Screams “ wake up “ because you dreaming lol lol so joe Biden who can’t remember where he parked his car is refreshing lol lol I’m literally laughing
Why Kamala Harris was picked as Joe Biden’s running mate
I do think Biden/Harris will probably do less harm than Trump/Pence in some important arenas, i.e., being less likely to simply off the healthcare and welfare we do have, have a smarter response to COVID, and idk, Supreme Court and climate stuff. So I’m voting for them.
The flip side is that Biden is not simply a bad pick because he is an old white man. He does appear to be losing his grip, so that’s not promising, but he has a shoddy history on racial justice and doesn’t want to do the work on policing necessary to stop killing Black people.

They’re trying their hardest to throw this. Let’s be honest, Bernie would have won by a landslide (twice) but they just can’t pull it together. They could have threw anything at the people besides Biden and Kamala and won
Does Biden get dinged by Warren or Sanders folks today if he picked someone who didn't run or win delegates?
I imagine she’ll have the same involvement with the administration as Biden did with Obama
Which is especially bad news for trump! Since he cannot yet speak English!
On the brightside for the Biden/Harris ticket, atleast Trump can't criticize Kamala as to why she didn't persecute Mnuchin for foreclosure violations when she was too busy locking up POC with non-violent possession charges.

Harris is a fine choice. The phoniness issue isn’t pulled out of thin air - there is something about her that’s always felt too planned and programmed. But she has the most important quality a Biden VP needs: there’s no question she would do a good job as president.The Daily News. A left wing rag.

Trump v. Biden v. Nickelback? Pick one
I don’t know, if you’re talking about Kamala she’s not my choice personally. Biden wrote the crime bill and she locked up a lot of truant mothers and drug users.
We came pretty close with Bernie twice. We’re stuck with Biden but we’ve come pretty far as a country in that respect.
I don’t necessarily disagree with that. Biden is way too old to run for reelection in 2024 potentially. It’s probably gonna be Harris vs AOC
Maybe. But I feel like Biden is not actively harmful to our civic institutions like Trump is, even though they’re not in their right minds.
That’s why Biden wants to undo trumps tax cuts for the rich. Historically Democrats are much better with the deficit than Republicans are.
I think Biden wants to raise corporate taxes and the top marginal rate to some extent.

Okay -- except I was specifically reacting to umpteen zillion tweets, many tagging the FBI, that said PIRRO IS THREATENING BIDEN!!1! I'm perfectly fine with saying that Pirro is a doofus conspiracy theorist who operates in bad faith.
I’m just over 600. Slowed down a lot and am very happy with the progress. If anyone else wants to follow I follow back. You’ll be entertained at least once. That more than we can say for Biden or Trump at the moment
A fair point. But easily enough refuted by, well, Biden remaining on the ticket. Far zanier and more dangerous conspiracy theories are on their way.
What is it you're not sure I believe? I don't think Pirro threatened Biden in any way. And I think that Pirro says insane things all the time, so a random conjecture from her that Biden might not be on the ticket doesn't move the needle for me.
You have used racist &amp; sexist tropes against  all week. Words like "angry mean, phoney &amp; nasty" are just energizing all of us "nasty women" to work hard to get  Biden/Harris elected!!  She is already polling ahead of you!! 👍 #MisogynistTrump #NastyWomenVote
Mr Biden,  love ya, and Kamala too  . Yesterday, I noticed that when you removed your mask that you touched your face. Please I know it’s difficult but you have to get out of the habit we can’t lose you guys please b careful
I suspect she is saying (without evidence, natch) that Biden's health will be an issue between now and November. On the Pirro Controversy Scale, that hardly even rates a mention, much less a Twitter riot.
Oh, boy, crazyloonperson Jeaninne Pirro is trending, let's see what the story is.  People are saying she *threatened* Joe Biden?? Holy crap.  {watches clip}  Uh, guys. That's not remotely a threat.
#ChameleonKamala, she can become whatever she needs to become to get ahead. As of late...Biden's best bud and VP.
Translation: Gavin doesn't think that Biden will win.

Yea there is. It’s all calculated risk. It’s pretty clear from the VP pick that Biden isn’t counting on the lefts vote. He must think he has enough moderate righty’s to cover
Biden and Harris have written off the left. They aren’t planning on getting the vote and they dont care. They are trying to win with center right voters. So be it. It’s a bold strategy cotton. Let’s see if it pays off.
I am soooo excited to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket in November!! 💙💙💙 #BidenHarris2020Landslide  #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica  #VoteBidenToUniteAmerica #BlueWave2020 #WomenForBidenHarris #WomensVote100
My name is Joe Biden and I did not write this message.
Incapable of coherent thought, as opposed to....Joe Biden? 😂
Love it! They are both discerning and cautionary, but good , strong personalities! She was a very good, very fair AG, and Senator, and who cannot love Joe Biden and his legacy? Very pleased overall!
I truly do not understand these takes. Why are we using this as an opportunity to tear down other women?  Why not given Warren credit for pulling Biden further left?
Great choice Mr Biden! The perfect “yang” to your “ying”! You have my vote 👍

Why would Biden step aside? Is there something wrong with him?
#KamalaHarris for VP? “Biden picked a strong women,” says  editorial writer.  “It shows us that Biden is more interested in winning than personal loyalties...It’s an important moment for women, for South Asian women, for immigrants.”  #SreeCovid19Call
Guess what tRump, we DON’T GIVE A RAT’S ASS what you think about Kamala Harris!  Joe BIden and Kamala Harris are going to win on November 3, 2020
I couldn't have said it better! Hopefully both of you will be an integral part of the Biden administration!! #BidenForPresident  #BlueWave2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  #StrongerTogether #DemocratsWin
What has this president done bad to YOU? I am not a bot. I live in shit hole NY! So please list what Biden has done  in how many years in office? 🤔go ahead  I am waiting...
A little different this time when Biden is senile and likely to step down after a few months. The VP needs to be qualified and Harris is not. She was the first person out of the Democratic primaries. How on earth is she a good pick overall?
Maybe if you are talking about Kamala the Ugandan Giant from the WWE. But if you are talking about Kamala Harris, she’s not even close to being qualified for President, which she will be if Biden wins, bc he will be unfit for office and step down within months.
Here we go!! Painting Joe Biden/Kamala Harris as radical left would be funny if it wasn't so pathetic!! This is a historic day! The Biden admin.will be one of the most diverse EVER when we currently have a white nationalist in the White House! #RacistTrumpMustGo  #BidenHarris2020

Watching Kamala Harris totally gut Biden in the first debate with the "I was that little girl" sound byte last summer, I was convinced that there was no chance for these two to coexist. Politics makes the strangest of bedfellows. Maybe Biden forgot?  #BidenVP
Sooo now we have a Pedophile running for President and a Slut for his VP!  Wow. And they had so much to say about Trump. #biden #kamalaharris
Let Biden try it first. Followed by Pelosi, Schiff, and Comey.
This letter is basically threatening journalists that any critical coverage of Biden's VP pick will be attacked as racist or misogyny. Any journalist who kowtows to the demands in this letter should find another profession, because they'll no longer be journalists.
is awesome &amp; I look forward to a Biden administration that will be as wonderfully diverse as our country is!!  #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS  #DiversityIsOurStrength #VoteBidenToUniteAmerica #BlueWave2020
Should get Comey, too. And Hillary, Obama, Biden, and Rice. Not to mention Wray, Clapper, and Brennan.
Eat shit Biden’s twitter writers. A day late and a dollar short. Fauci is Mr. Wrong and a Hillary loving democrat operative.
Biden escaping a nursing home
I have not decided yet. I def won’t vote for Trump. Biden will wait as long as possible before supporting a policy and a cabinet position that I feel is important to progressive politics. If he does then he has my vote.
That's exactly what they want to do! They want to come in &amp; take our firearms but it would have to be over my dead body! People better buy all the ammo you can...now!! All I can say is God forbid Biden wins SOMEHOW, it would sadly be DEATH TO AMERICA! Pray for OUR COUNTRY! 🙏🇺🇸♥️
Corrupt lying Biden!
At least he can read. Biden can’t read off a teleprompter. The Lincoln Project sucks.
The debates, man. Once they air, it’s over for Biden
Biden is, and always has been, a moderate.  Don't believe the stories trying to paint him as some kind of radical.  Is it likely that you will disagree with some of his policies?  Yes, most certainly.  But he will always be a person of high moral character, and won't embarrass us
touche touche. definitely an idiot in some respects, i just see trump as an intentional racist and biden as gaffe-prone ( i acknowledge my liberal bias in this viewpoint)
if you see biden as a racist, but not trump, then i have nothing more to say to you, god speed and go dawgs
literally is, i guess we have different understandings of what racism is, and we probably wont see eye to eye...all i know is nazis and white supremacist groups fly the flag of one candidate and it isnt biden (miss me with your impending antifa reply)
It'll be open house for your illegal's. That's what you really love about a Biden Presidency. Right ? Turn the USA into Nicaragua and shit.
If you can stand in line at Home Depot and Walmart then you can stand in line to vote. Biden needs the fraudulent mail in ballot to win. He is scum!!!
His VP pick will not change my mind at all. I will vote for Biden/Any creature alive or dead.  But I want to see the VP candidate start campaigning! 💜
"If you don't vote by mail, THEN YOU AIN'T BLACK"  - Joe Biden
Joe Biden does.
Biden is a moron. Time to have him step aside for a decent candidate.
Just leave them alone, believe me I’ve tried and lost friends over! They are not going to realize till after he is all one big lie, which we are not gonna be able to expose until we get Biden in office. Thankfully he lost his other support that put him over the edge swing states
Good, let the Republicans bring up Benghazi rather than attack Biden.  I doubt there is anyone changing their vote based on a six year old non-scandal.
Trump is a bad person. Biden is a decent person. Their church attendance or non-attendance on any given Sunday does not alter this in the least.
It’s also hypocritical because reports are saying China is trying to interfere for Biden. And by reports I mean  which is pretty much rock solid.
Please watch his last twenty “appearances” on tv. Orange man bad but Biden ain’t it. And Harris, Bass, and the lying Susan Rice ain’t it either. MAGA 2020. Orang man good.
i don’t really know. i see so many people say “biden 2020” and it’s just like isnt he worse.
Yeah I support Biden, but at this point I’d back any candidate who shows any interest in ending the pandemic
people only pick biden becasue that’s the only option.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said that while he won’t tear down President Trump’s much-touted wall along the United States’ southern border with Mexico, he also won’t continue construction of the barrier if he’s elected president in November.
We’re is black lives matter now! They should add to the reward. But they spend million for Biden’s campaign. Scumbags
Good luck. I saw my doc and was given anti anxiety meds. They really helped. I haven’t needed an emergency pill, in months. Once my head wasn’t “everywhere”, it was easier to engage. Sending my best, brother. There’s no shame in seeking some help.
I would love to see his reaction to Joe Biden telling him he ain’t black if he doesn’t vote for Joe.
The Dem Politicians don't care because to them this IS normal! THIS IS DISGUSTING AND  BIDEN IS A PIG! Look how uncombfortable cease young children are with him! #VoteNoToPedoJoe #Trump2020 🇺🇸
I was in that rut! I wish I had some sage wisdom, to offer. I just engrossed myself in a few projects, at the house. They’ve spawned other projects, and so on.
Thanks Bill. I finally checked in. Hope your Friday was great.
Nothing is going to help Biden. But let #Jack keep playing his game.
, what the hell do you mean "afraid" ? I'm not "afraid", and I've never been polled ! Dont try and make excuses because Biden is leading in some polls. It sounds desperate. I don't give a damn about those polls. #Trump2020Landslide.
It's NOT okay to sexually assault ANYONE EVER! TELL ME WHY ARE YOU ONLY FOCUSING ON TRUMP AND NOT BIDEN?
A vote for Biden is a vote for China. A vote for  is a vote for America. 🇺🇸
100% correct! Biden is in front of all these cameras touching all these children smelling their hair putting his hands all over their bodies in front of everyone so if he could do that imagine this shit he does behind closed doors!!

No it’s not. The goal for you is to take votes away from Biden
Everyone hates Trump. Everyone hates Biden.  What the hell are we doing?
Slowly but surely the real joe Biden is surfacing
I don't often agree with you, but this headline really does come across as them just trolling you.  If, for some reason, they feel that it's important to report on how you are voting come November, they simply could have said "Meghan McCain won't commit to voting for Biden".
Biden will be TOLD who his VP is going to be. #TrojanHorse
You do know that when you lose, “bigly” you will go to prison? YOU committed Treason, not Obama. Not Biden. YOU!Kamala Harris named by Joe Biden as his VP pick  The greatest  pick for  in modern #American history and history BREAKING indeed! I can't wait for #VPKamalaHarris #BidenHarris2020 #Joe2020 #DefeatTrump #ByeDon2020 #FBR #FBRParty #Resist
Your boy literally said the same exact thing
Now we need the 276 leftist reasons Harris is a bad choice and won’t garner Biden one vote and why #VoteGreen is the only sane choice!
The count down is on in Ct. also.  Cannot take Trump another 81 days, let alone 4 years.  Please vote Biden-Harris
Finally something VP Pence and I agree on.  Vote for Putin's stooges Trump and Pence and kiss democracy goodbye or vote for Biden and Harris and turn this train wreck around.
To sufficiently fund the Postal Service would require more taxes than Joe Biden and Heels Up Harris could dream up, combined.  They'd have to drag Barry out of retirement to invent a few more.
I don’t care if he flunked kindergarten! I am voting for Biden/Harris!
reported the news probably did not make it to many mail in voters and even people that went to polls so leave the voters out of it.  Oh yeah, Harris believes Biden's accusers while calling him a racist.
It's an act of sabotage against the Biden admin. McConnell knows trump will lose and is trying hard to blow up the new administration before it even starts.
Biden has +40 years of evil under his belt
BIden said masks should be mandatory in all states for the next three months at least! No!! Then his VP SELECTION said "NOW THATS WHAT LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE" No , i say thats what fear mongering and taking away our freedom looks like! Yes wear masks in a public setting, thats it!
TRUMP HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB IN RESPONSE TO THE VIRUS,  WOULD HAVE LET MORE TRAVEL FROM CHINA ENTER OUR COUNTRY, TRUMP SHUT IT DOWN!! WE WOULD HAVE MORE DEATHS UNDER YOU! STOP TRYING TO DO WHAT TRUMP HAS ALREADY DONE AND CALL IT YOUR PLAN!
Like you would do any better during a global pandemic and worldwide depression? The only ideas you and Biden have revolve around pot, electric cars, gun confiscation and solar panels.  You would destroy the country in years if you could
biden is smarter than you will ever be
Thomas  If the socialist Communist Joe Biden presidency happens and the house and the senate God forbid goes to that social Communist party we as a country will be in major major trouble!!
I guess my tweet yesterday wasn’t the right way to put my feelings on VP Kamala Harris. I don’t like her at all, but I’m not stupid enough to not vote for Biden-Harris. Trump winning this election will give him an insane ego boost. I live in fear of seeing what happens after that
I was thinking about this the other day after watching Biden and Harris Chances are really good Joe's having that conversation with them I hope
Sure...but so many people believe this crap.  Biden needs to fight like he is 20 points down.
Watch Hannity tonight Bette. Biden/Harris bashing at its best. How’s nyc treating you?  When you moving. I heard that there is a mass exodus.
Just to be clear... Donald trump instituted a travel ban in January. But Joe Biden calling for masks in August is leadership??  I wonder if anyone knows what Joe was saying in January?? Huh,   Would someone at the times happen to have that info?... #crickets
I nominate him for Biden’s Press Secretary
Not a black voice in sight. Great first impression. At least they agree with Biden about the masks.
Absolutely!! Make it great gain and KEEP it that way! Basement boy Biden and his joke of a running mate aren’t up for that job. PLEASE make sure to win in November. It’s the only chance we have. Thanks President Trump. #MAGA #KAG
HAIR SNIFFER JOE BIDEN MAKES FUN OF BLACK KIDS . WILL JOE SNIFF FLIP FLOPPER HARRIS HAIR .    WHERE'S CORRUPT HUNTER SPENDING TAXPAYERS MONEYS.
So if Biden wins and succeeds in stopping the US pandemic, you’ll agree to practice your seppuku, ok?
Why is FOX and the rest of the media starting every show with the BIDEN AND HARRIS TICKET instead of the biggest story of the day. TRUMP BROCKERED A PEACE DEAL BETWEEN ISREAL AND UAE! ITS EPIC AND THE MOST IMPORTANT STORY! They don't want to give TRUMP a win!! I guess we will!!
Biden needs to run like he’s down by 20 points and there are two weeks left !!!!
Headline: Biden and Harris dead in landslide
As talented as Woody Harrelson is and as good an actor as he is he could not capture the demented buffoonery of Biden
That’s why Biden picked her she’s the best fund raiser and he isn’t so basically he’ll be living off her fundraising lol....I had a boyfriend like that
Kamala is a danger to AMERICA! If the left wins through cheating and Biden steps down She will be our next President! She in inauthentic, a phony who will say and do anything to gain power! AMBITIOUS AND RUTHLESS!
Vote for Biden.
President Trump let VP Pence go after Joe Biden vp you concentrate on Joe Biden and whatever the VP that he picked speaks let her talk and she will put her big foot in her big mouth!!
Biden/ Harris are wolves in sheep’s clothing. They are coming for you. Hope you saved your pennies and have a good job. Cause they want you to share it with the world.
If I’m advising Biden, I have him stay in the basement and let 45 tweet and have those crazy afternoon press conferences every day.
Who is this Biden?  Supposedly in politics for 50 years. Why wasn’t he ever giving press conferences daily during the Great Depression while millions lost their jobs and homes. We all loved the money him and Obama gave us. I am still waiting for mine
Biden’s questionable words will be overshadowed continually as long as 45 has an active Twitter account.
You would’ve said this about anybody Biden picked as VP.  Not even an interesting take.
You know what was nasty. Listening to her and Biden just bashing trump and talking about a lot of nothing. Smoke and mirrors. Do nothing democrats. She is gonna make a fool of herself. Hahahahaha I’m gonna enjoy it though
Biden/Harris wolves in sheep’s clothing. They are coming for your house and wallet and job. They need them for the world to enjoy. Hahahahaha good luck. Is Bette staying in New York?  Cuomo needs your money.
I mean you went with the cheap headline instead of commenting on the substance of what Biden said. Why is that?
That’s been Biden’s campaign slogan since he first announced he was running.
Joe Biden basically asleep during Kamala's speech isnt good
You mean a Trump Rally.  Please compare the tone of the Biden/Harris presser and Trump’s presser.
I’m with you, no way Warren was a serious contender. She’s a great senator, but she wouldn’t help Biden with any of the groups he needs to vote for him if he’s going to win. If it came down to two people, then the other was probably Susan Rice.
I’m pretty convinced Biden picked Kamala Harris because he liked the smell of her shampoo.
So cool that a crowd of #BidenHarris2020 supporters have gathered outside of the Delaware High School that VP Biden &amp; Senator Harris are going to speak at. Not a rally of any kind But they showed up anyway!
How come why I type or search up  , Joe Biden's website pops up??? Go ahead, try it.
I find the level-setting game here fascinating.  Kamala Harris is a bold choice and Joe Biden is doing anything but running a safe campaign. The question is whether voters go with the team putting forward substantive policies that improve people's lives or the party stoking fear.
Someone with a Biden sticker on their profile yet hasn't read his platform.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP. And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.  These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it's obvious that this radical
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?). Next, she ends her pathetic run at President. Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
I got this one:  Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn't get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
I’ve seen Biden in the last year and he’s not known where he is, can’t read two sentences off a teleprompter without stumbling, has not answered an unscripted question and is clearly in his dotage. If I were I’d be terrified of a debate too.
Harris believed Biden’s accuser
Considering Harris failed pretty spectacularly in the primaries, that doesn't seem like a great idea. A lot of people just don't like Harris and there's no reason to think she'd appeal to anyone who wasn't going to vote for Biden anyway.
With all due respect if youre arguing Tim Kaine was the Catholic in 2016 you do realize that Joe Biden was the Catholic in 2012 you idiot

Joe Biden just picked the next president if the left wins through cheating! President KAMALA. She is ambitious and ruthless! Biden will step down! Medicare for all, defunding the police, killing babies. VOTE TRUMP!!!!!

Willie Brown: Kamala Harris should 'politely decline' any offer to be Biden's running mate
He knew the prwssvwas chomping at the but to press him on Biden/Harris!  has had enough of his BS and ready hold him accountable and he knows it!
We're not talking about Islamic law. We're talking about her nutty claims that Biden is going to enforce Islamic law. Which is absurd on its face.
We're not talking about living under Islam. We're talking about Joe Biden. And claims that he would enforce Sharia are nutty.
Haha haha.they r real but #fakenewscnn doesn’t show that kind of real news (they just push their opinions) so u haven’t seen reality. It’s ok there is still time but not for biden can’t wait for the debate #FakeNewsMedia
Trump has a problem of not using a script ever and Biden has a problem of using one, ALWAYS.   We could use a happy middle.
Biden/Harris have no experience Biden has done nothing for 40 years and Harris is a diff person in every room she goes in.She is in wall st pocket.That desperate for votes I c.Wait the polls said Hillary was in the lead and what happened.. silent majority,keep the Kleenex handy
The  should already be firing out ads against #KamalaHarris, if they were playing it smart.   They could end the election in three different TV ads of Biden/Harris in less than a month if they play the cards right.
Joe Biden excluded approximately 98.1% of the eligible American public from being looked at for Vice President, soley because he was judging based on Sex &amp; Race.   #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris
McCain/Palin, 2008, Romney/Ryan, 2012, Clinton/Kaine, 2016, .... Biden/Harris? 2020??  For some reason the woke pondering of a Male/Female ticket to the SJW doesn't seem to work in American elections.
She’s not qualified whatsoever and she said she thought that Biden sexually assaulted women in the past yet she agrees to b his running make. What a joke.&amp; she said Jessee smollet was 1 of the nicest person she ever met.Still on her Twitter page. Never retracted #FakeNews loser
We've seen non-stop elder abuse. I've never been a Biden fan, but he shouldn't be allowed to do this, even for the sake of power.
As long as the person is 35 the day they take the oath of office they are fine. On that basis, AOC will be old enough. But, I doubt there will be serious primary challenge to Biden, if he runs again, or Harris, assuming she wants the top spot.
: Kamala will not weirdly mirror Biden’s actions at the table.
100% of Rudy Giulianis will go to jail in a Biden Presidency.
Why are all these celebrities in love with Biden? Just bc he's not Trump????
Donald Trump, Joe Biden declared winners in Connecticut in final presidential primaries of year
Notice how she didn't say Biden?  She knows he's incapable.
My money is still on Biden winning on November.  But, all of the neoliberal Democrats will be very confused and surprised when the BLM protests only escalate in January.
Bibi knows how to work them too. And how to use them to keep pressure on Trump. Trump can’t win without them so expect more “Joe Biden will hurt the Bible” theatre in the months to come
It's true Joe didn't pick her. The Federalist had a story stating they gave Biden a script for his phone to Harris offering her the running mate position. Can you believe he had to be given a script?
She believes Joe Biden’s accusers.
I liked when she believed Joe Biden’s accusers and told her little girl being bussed story making Biden look like the segregationist he is
Biden bows out of a second term and Harris picks AOC as her running mate.
Although I didn’t care WHO Biden picked for VP, I LOVE KAMALA and I’m so effin PUMPED!!!!❤️
Because she believes Joe Biden’s accusers
Biden. Harris. Biden.  Harris. Biden. Harris. Biden. Harris   Biden. Harris.  Biden. Harris.                  Yeah.    Yeah.   Yeah.   Yeah.

Biden picked Harris to be VP. I guess she can pull her campaign bus out of mothballs.
Cenk, I hear you, bro, but perhaps Biden is holding her in reserve for Treasury. THAT would be a great move as well, methinks.

Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
It doesn’t look so good when you use the real dates does it:   Obama/Biden 1/21/2009 8,228 1/22/2017 19,827 Change +11,559 +141%  Trump/Pence Today 27,779 Change +7,952 +40%  Of course the percentage change is what counts not the change in raw numbers.  What a dumbass!
Is Biden the nominee?
If Biden is +2 in Georgia, he is more like +12 in Minnesota.
Sorry David. You’re entitled to your opinion and can vote for any candidate you want. But your comment to Patty about “some” Dems supporting Biden and her believing in a Democratic Party “monolith” was condescending and nasty. You invited a retort and should know better.
Joe “nothing will fundamentally change” Biden loses to Donald “ still trying to make America great again” Trump
This is why they selected Biden, the guy with zero likability because he was the easiest to replace because of age and dementia and bleeding eye balls
Connecticut voters expected to rubber-stamp Trump, Biden
I have no psychic powers, so look at what analysts say They say if Biden wins, expect a 5% drop in the entire stock market and worsening unemployment along with rising taxes. But solar and electric car stocks will likely go up If Trump wins, expect 2% increase in stock market
Do you believe the stock market and economy will plunge if Biden wins the Presidency?
They want a voice in the development of Biden's platform. We can't let the Bernie Bros have all of the fun.

Hmm  Some speculation that Biden wants  'the whole team' ( of potential Cabinet advisers) present for the VP announcement  Trouble is no one has any real idea when the announcement will happen  Neat idea, though!
Trump is being sued by 25 women for sexual harassment...so yeah..Biden is the creepy one.  trump also believes demon witch doctors instead of real doctors. I'll take my chances and vote for the normal guy instead of trump the 🤡
You just have to go as far as looking at Biden's pick to lead his VIP search to understand what type of administration he would have.  I mean Chris "Waitress VIP Mortgage Ireland tax shelter" Dodd????
You scared people will see Biden’s complete mental breakdown during the debates? The country needs to see if the person running for president is mentally stable don’t you think? You prob don’t care because you hate trumo so much you could care less about anything else.
Couple things, Ms. Romney. It’s not his house. It’s our house. These Biden basement jokes aren’t landing like you think they are landing.
I’m so glad I’m not voting for Biden.   I’m equally happy I’m not voting for Trump.   #VoteGreen
Biden is a friggin weirdo
Sure Biden does!  Lol what a joke...  Biden doesn't know who he is! No ground game zero campaign!  Its a joke Trump 2020.  The silent Majority!
Right, because Biden has 16 Chinese Trade Marks and owes China millions. Oh wait, that’s the Trumps!
Well, you gotta have something to talk about I suppose. Currently,  gives Biden a percentage point lead that will translate into a popular vote win of around 10 million votes. With that kind of advantage, Biden would win the EC decisively.
If this differential holds on Election Day and 130 million people vote, Biden will win the popular vote by 70.5 million to 59.5 million - a margin of 11 million votes.
We can vote on issues by computer just like congress did recently....our government is completely obsolete I know this because it doesn’t function and can’t be update just like that 1995 computer in the basement with Joe Biden
This is as important as a contribution to the Biden campaign right now  Democracy Docket Action Fund contributions help to fight voter suppression  They're working very hard to sue the RNC/Trump campaign's effort to mess up mail-in ballots!
Another vote for Biden
I sincerely believe military officers are waiting for orders from President Biden
The major irony of politics is that the Leftists and MSM falsely accuses Trump of selling out to Russia and Putin- but if Biden wins, Biden actually WILL sell out to China, &amp; MSM will brush it under the rug  If Biden wins, look for rally in US-Chinese joint companies like TenCent
Only 3% of Bernie donors donated to Biden.  I say they are more than considering voting 3rd party
Rand Paul is lying to get me to vote for Joe Biden.  #StillBernie #Bernie2020
So you’re voting for Joe Biden? Because Trump isn’t going to do anything about it. He’s too busy kissing Putin’s ass.
Biden should challenge Trump to a bicycle race.  can even keep the training wheels on 🤣🤣🤣
Biden didn’t know the follow up question was coming.... lol wtf
CT dems prodigal son, a drunk womanizing punk who used his position for profit and is still honored today by the CT dems and media.  Kevin, Biden is no saint as his whole family has cashed in on his position and huge racist.
I have a feeling that Biden will be giving Trump a great gift soon- in the form of a completely unelectable running mate. One of them, Rice, used to praise Scientology &amp; Communism; Kamala Harris is a trainwreck, and his other possible choices aren't better
Please stop saying Biden will go left when he said NOTHING WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE start believing people when they tell you who thy are.... listening is an under rated skill
“We are getting clobbered,” he said. “The left-leaning super PACs are bringing a lot more air support to team Biden than the ones on the right are bringing to team Trump, unfortunately.”
With less than 100 days to go until election, what do analysts think each candidate will do for economy? Under Trump, expect 2%+ rise in stock market &amp; economy, with friendlier markets for energy &amp; tax cuts. Biden would mean 5%+ loss but gains for solar, pot &amp; electric car stocks
I wish Biden was in public again so he could tell people to vote for the other guy
A vote for Biden is a vote for tyranny! They want to abolish the police and in tandem take away our guns!! We must keep the freedoms and the constitution in tact! It was what this great country was built on!!! WE MUST VOTE TRUMP AND REPUBLICAN DOWN TICKET!!!
It truly is heartbreaking! At one point so many in  liked and respected Joe Biden! They understood his pain, decency, strength of character and what family means to him! A party to turning their hate and  despicable plays for power and corruption against him is a shame!
Thank you I never saw that interview! I have such respect and admiration for Dr. Jill Biden!
I see no relevance with the picture you posted. Biden and Thurmond served together on the  committee. Biden was chair and Thurmond was ranking member. They kind of had to work together
And Biden said he agreed with Strom Thurmond's passed?
I stand corrected! I'm sure Biden is the real racist and that this video isn't doctered at all! Right?
Like how you heard the cable news sound bites of Biden's comments? Which by the way he has clarified instead of doubled down on

You are so awesome, Andy. Thank you so very much for the kind mention.
It would give Trump the win.... he should do it just to win because with either one we’re screwed anyway.  Joe “nothing will fundamentally change” Biden.
Even though Biden said he’d veto it... people are so STUPID!
Biden did apologize for his remarks.   I have never heard Trump apologize for anything.   Shame on you for defending the worst example on a President
They probably do, but it’s dumb people of any race who will vote for Kanye.  Unfortunately we need those people to vote for Biden, too, to run up the score.
If you’re calling Biden “Uncle Joe”, which used to be a nickname for Stalin, you might unconsciously be showing that you were never going to vote for him.
And you think Joe Biden is the answer?!? Get a clue! RHINO ALERT!!
Snark, sarcasm and wicked sense of humor! Plus very knowledgeable Brian Williams is a great way to end the nightly news mess!
Obama, Hillary and Biden too!Team Trump.... When did any POTUS become responsible for a pandemic?    Why are you playing defense every day, NOT challenging Biden to hold the medical people's feet to the fire and blame Trump.    I believe you get paid... Do your job.

Biden/Kamala Dem Presidential Ticket have NO position on Crime aka Law &amp; Order, which is gripping this nation right now!! There only concern is wearing masks (which I agree) for 3 months (coincidentally expires just after #Election2020 is decided) any thoughts?
Agree. Also, the largest piece of the electorate (over 40%) is Independent. You aren’t going to win without a coalition of Independents and some R’s . There are plenty of Centrists horrified by Trump and anxious to support Biden. People tuning in should feel all our wanted!
I am just wondering, the Biden/Harris ticket has has 2 press conferences in the past three day. And has yet to answer questions. (Hitler never took questions after his speeches either) To me this is starting to look like the start of a Fascist Dictatorship.

Why would you think this is even remotely a possibility after he just spent months pumping up Joe Biden?
Much better odds than that for Murphy and worse for Rice IMHO. Friend of Biden's, but needs Senate approval. She reportedly has a temper &amp; very sharp elbows that made her enemies at State; it's why she withdrew from consideration when Hillary stepped down after BO's 1st term.

In the past month, more Pro-Trump TV ads have aired than Pro-Biden (63,000 vs 54,000), but more has been spent on Biden ads ($40M vs $32M), suggesting that the Biden ads may be reaching more viewers than the Trump ads.  Read the full report here:
Trump has spent nearly double what Biden has on FB and Google ads since mid-April and nearly 3x what Biden has since mid-July.   Overall, digital spending in the presidential race has totaled $420.9M, with $247.7M spent on FB and &amp;173.2M spent on Google.

The candidates' tone is markedly different on FB. In the past month, Trump has only mentioned Biden in 19% of his FB ad spending, whereas Biden has mentioned Trump in 42% of his online spending.  Read the full report here:
Since July 14, the Trump campaign has not aired a single positive ad, and 98% of Trump's airings have been entirely negative (focused on attacking Biden).   By contrast, 69% of Biden’s airings have been entirely positive, with 12% solely attacking Trump.
While recent Biden ads discuss a variety of policy issues (COVID, jobs, healthcare, civil rights), Trump ads have been laser-focused on crime and the recent protests. No Trump ads aired since July 15 have mentioned the COVID-19 pandemic.

Biden is looking for a friend as VP, someone who is loyal. This is a pick to make if you're 110% sure you're going to win. Rice is a liability on the campaign trail, and excites no one (and disappoints many).
I'm calling it now, Biden is going to select Rice as the VP, and it'll be a bigger flop than Palin was in 2008. This isn't the pick needed to win. I'm as much of a yellow dog Democrat as it gets, and this pick would make me have to hold my nose to vote for Biden-- which I'd do.
Trump: Some men insulted that Biden vowed to name female VP
The pick may face racist and sexist attacks from Joe Biden. See Anita Hill.

I think Biden should pick whomever he wants. Race and gender shouldn’t be his only options. I’m all for the under dog but I think people are pushing thier own agenda on him way too much
They want a voice in the development of Biden's platform. We can't let the Bernie Bros have all of the fun.

This #Election2020 is between two camps: A BusinessMan vs a Politician. The businessman works for the economy. The Politician works for himself first. Trump vs Biden ( people that vote for Biden wouldn't care even if was Charles Manson), they are just ANTI-TRUMP

For example, I criticize Joe Biden for wanting to increase police funding, but Trump attacks Biden by lying and pretending Biden wants to defund the police.
No, he won't, because I criticize Biden from the left and Trump would see the things I criticize him for as good
Trump doesn't need "ammo" to attack Biden. He'll attack Biden regardless of what you do.

More than half a century before Sen. Kamala D. Harris was named Joe Biden’s running mate Tuesday, another Black woman from California took the stage at a Chicago convention to make a decisive declaration.
That face you make when people think Kamala was Biden’s choice instead of corporate Americans choice for him
This choice proves Joe Biden will make good decisions after pondering options carefully #refreshingconcept
Rudy Giuliani’s Daughter Publicly Announces Her Endorsement For Biden And Harris     What a disappointment to the all time crooked Lawyer,Failed Prosecutor,and loser as once Mayor'' Shalom'' and Good Riddance.
If Harris and, especially, Biden look extreme and far-left, it is only because the Republicans have moved so far to the right that anyone to the left of Attila the Hun looks like an extreme leftist.
Harris is the same woman, who said she believed the women, who accused Biden of sexual assault, and improper touching. Talk about willing to sell your soul. No integrity in that girl. #HarrisBiden2020
I've seen bigger crowds of Biden supporters looting Chicago's Best Buy.
I am elated to see that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his nominee for VP. I can’t wait to vote for Biden/Harris in November and send a message to all Americans that tough women make history.  #BidenHarris
There was a bigger crowd of Biden's supporters looting Chicago's Best Buy last night.
Exactly my point. Joe Biden is just a paper puppet. Still unfortunate that the blacks need the whites to get there though.
As much as the Kamala Harris thing is like, completely tone-deaf and insane Biden's VP choice literally doesn't matter and has absolutely no influence over the election what so ever.   He could have picked Sarah Palin and the needle wouldn't budge.
Woke up last afternoon (I'm working nights this week) to this news. I couldn't be more delighted. Kamala Harris is brilliant, eminently qualified, and, a strong advocate for equality and justice.  I'm ready to do the work to get her and Joe Biden into office. #BidenHarris2020
Try and stay out of politics on here...but seeing so many people happy with the VP pick by Biden was cool to see. Really cool to see actually.   November 3rd feels so close and so far away at the same time.   Educate yourselves and vote 👊
Pray for the safety of America if your paper puppet Joe Biden gets elected.
i’m guessing it goes to joe biden.....
Sooooo, at age 77, with mother nature taking its course, what happens if JOE BIDEN does not make it to the ELECTION, then what??
#Biden picks #VP based on gender &amp; race. That's the American way!!! #WhataJoke
Thank goodness Biden doesn’t waste his time worrying about grudges, spite, and revenge.
Stop. Biden/Harris 2020. We need to unite.
I'm so can excited and pumped. Biden/Harris my dream since February 2019.
What I would love to see is all Prez hopefuls on stage to show a united front for Biden Harris. So thrilled with this choice!
Biden is an idiot and terrible candidate, but now it comes to who is more of an idiot: trump or Biden
I'm so happy!!!  Biden/Harris my dream team.
Brazile will be sooo busy tracking down DEBATE QUESTIONS FOR BIDEN, KAMALA. MAYBE THIS TIME SOMEONE WILL CONVICT HER
My mood just got better with the text message from Joe Biden.#KamalaHarrisForVP
HAS BIDEN SNIFFED HER HAIR YET????
Joe Biden has named Kamala Harris as his running mate, making the California senator the first Black and South Asian American woman to run on a major political party's presidential ticket.
WOW!!! YOU HAVE LOST IT SUPPORTING BIDEN??? NOT ONE EXTRA VOTE WILL KAMALA GET. SHE ALREADY HAS CA VOTES AND NOTHING ELSE.  THE DANCING FOOL KAMALA MUST BE BRETS FAVORITE
A great pick!
Biden-Stark 2020.

Dazed and Confused ‘Led Zeppelin’Great Biden intro
If the Dems are so sure Trumps going to loose this election, why are the so hell bent on getting all their extreamest policies into the relief package? They can just pass all that stuff easily when Biden takes over. Right? Oh wait maybe they're not so sure as they sound ;-)
Can’t recall Trump ever making a racist comment but heard Biden make 2 in the past week
Y’all know Joe Biden is creepy/shady af and you’re still gonna vote for him for the sole reason “anyone but Trump”.......lol.....
The Obama-Biden Justice Department determined Brown's death was a good kill.  The takeaway you should be promoting is to not attempt to assault a police officer or attempt to take his gun.
Michael Brown's was a good kill, Creepy Joe. Even the Obama-Biden DoJ admitted as much.
You have to use your Biden defebalizer he is saying is your not black!!!
Can anyone show me why Biden is not a bigot ?
Nothing would stop me from voting for Biden. Also, I have never voted Republican and I never will.
Curious?Who dresses Biden?Obvious he doesn’t!
Biden is a racist
You said Biden was barely able to read a scripted statement.  My point was that you could say the same thing for either candidate.  They are both mentally depleted.
I am going to assume you’re voting for Biden. The man can’t even formulate a thought and be consistent with what he is saying.  very scary for Biden to be placed in the highest office at president. He has done nothing in his 40 years in office what policies will he really fix
I’m voting for Biden even if he picks a loaded, BM’d Depends as his running mate. GTFOH lady.
I wonder who really wrote this. Sure as heck wasn't ole creepy sleepy fumblin bumblin Joe Biden.

Nothing will stop me from casting my vote for Biden. Soon the morning will come when I awake to learn we have rid ourselves of this mad man and cancer called tRump.
#Biden2020 No matter who he pics. As long as it’s a breathing human. I will vote for Joe Biden.I agree with you. Who in their right mind would vote for Sleepy demented Joe Biden?
The Daily News. A left wing rag. She is a Green New Deal, pro illegal Alien, anti 2nd Ammendment, Biden bashing fraud.
Women enters grocery store without mask. I tell her to put one on. She says she left it in the car and just needed to run in for a minute. Doesn’t matter I say. Get your fucking mask. In the parking lot she yells I bet you’re voting for Biden, stupid.
Be crazy FOR WHAT BIDEN REPRRSENTS
Hey your boy Biden is the corrupt one. Not Trump. There were numerous contacts between Burisma and the Obama State Department. Lies galore during the impeachment trial
Biden is 3 years older than trump. Who do you think would do better in a stress test?
Biden/Harris intelligent presser is a stark contrast from the unintelligent garbled ramblings that Trump delivers.
Kamila Harris plays the straight man Bud Abbott and Joe Biden is plays Lou Costello because he is always confused and disoriented. Dementia has really taken the life out of Biden very sad.
Biden??  Who can’t put two sentences together and is as corrupt as it gets?  That’s your answer????  Boy if you think things are bad now, just wait till the communism comes under the guise of socialism.
The democrats were behind the Russia hoax, phony impeachment, the public lynching of Kavanaugh led by the nasty and mean Biden bashing Harris, and supporting a corrupt and despicable Clinton. Real fair.
How can I get a Biden/Harris years sign ??
And Biden said he didn’t want his kids to go to school in a “racial jungle” 🤦🏻‍♂️
I have come to the conclusion that you liberals are fucked in the head this Vice President pick is the same one who called Biden a raciest lol you all should be committed
Lol yeah ok then clearly you don’t see it lol Biden is what’s wrong but you gonna believe what you want all I know is trump has my vote
My Biden portfolio didn't trade so well today Surprised $MJ wasn't stronger
If he gets the attendance of Tusla all over again that hurts Trump more than Biden to shout into a half empty arena.
Who are you kidding you know Biden isn’t capable of running this country so they hand picked her it’s another Clinton nightmare
Then you living under a rock because Biden is not capable of tieing his own shoes let alone run a country open your eyes
Do your research you might be surprised at what you find Biden is the raciest here enough said
Because Biden is a raciest he has been his whole life
Wow have you been living under a rock??? Biden has serious cognitive decline everybody knows it and sees it, the Democrats only endorsed Biden because they can control ever aspect of him they know he can’t run this country on his own
Biden can’t remember where he parked his car and that Harris lol she’s a train wreck look at her record as a prosecutor my god if these two are the ones you want voted in we are doomed I’d rather have the spirit squad hell they do a better job
Well you got Biden the puppet and his side kick or Trump hmmmm it’s obvious trump sorry to say , Biden and his side kick lol oh my god hell if these are my choices my pick is Trump those other two scare the hell outta me
My name is Joe Biden and I did not write this message.
Lmao she’s dead on arrival
Aren’t you voting for Biden? So much for being against pedos
If Biden doesn’t get elected we're basically electing Donald Trump for president.
Lol yea I’m scared alright IM SCARED THAT A LOONEY TUNE ABSENT MINDED PERSON LIKE BIDEN WHO CANT REMEMBER HES EVEN RUNNING FOR OFFICE IN CHARGE AND THE CRACK HEAD POT SMOKING PERSON HE PICKED AS HIS RUNNING MATE NOT TO MENTION THIS
Screams “ wake up “ because you dreaming lol lol so joe Biden who can’t remember where he parked his car is refreshing lol lol I’m literally laughing

Biden-Harris: Continuing to bring you an Authoritarian Fascist Police State America. "Sit down, shut up, or you'll be even sorrier."

Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris To Be His VP Running Mate In Historical Moment
Biden has apparently picked his #VP — predicting Harris or Warren for the ticket. #Election2020
Market is saying absolutely nothing on Aug 11 although it is certainly not uncomfortable w/ a Biden win if the Senate doesn't flip. Comfort and prediction are not one and the same. Our Pres. election model has gotten every election right since 1956 except for 1992. Happy 2 share
your base case about the market not pricing a Biden victory is wrong. You assumed the Senate automatically flips. That's not necessarily true. Market performance in incumbent election years did not forecast beyond random until after Labor Day.
Let Biden try it first. Followed by Pelosi, Schiff, and Comey.
Should get Comey, too. And Hillary, Obama, Biden, and Rice. Not to mention Wray, Clapper, and Brennan.
Eat shit Biden’s twitter writers. A day late and a dollar short. Fauci is Mr. Wrong and a Hillary loving democrat operative.
That's exactly what they want to do! They want to come in &amp; take our firearms but it would have to be over my dead body! People better buy all the ammo you can...now!! All I can say is God forbid Biden wins SOMEHOW, it would sadly be DEATH TO AMERICA! Pray for OUR COUNTRY! 🙏🇺🇸♥️
At least he can read. Biden can’t read off a teleprompter. The Lincoln Project sucks.
And #StatusQuoJoe Biden is a lifelong Corporate-loving, Wall Street-worshipping, Billionaire Class sycophant that sure as hell won't do a damned thing for The Poor and The Working Class.
Joe Biden does.
Please watch his last twenty “appearances” on tv. Orange man bad but Biden ain’t it. And Harris, Bass, and the lying Susan Rice ain’t it either. MAGA 2020. Orang man good.
It’s pretty transparent that the payroll tax deferral is mostly to screw Biden if he wins. Everyone would owe an additional $1,200 at tax time.  If trump wins, the republicans will push to forgive it, if he loses they’ll oppose it.
Your outright lies are laughable! I don't know who is more cognitively impaired,  you or Biden.
The hidden issue is the payroll tax is going to accumulate until January, which he’s saying he’d like to void it altogether. Whoever is the President, whether Trump or Biden, hopeful they both stick to that.
I’m not just voting for Joe Biden for President - I’m voting for his character, his decency, and his leadership.   Joe Biden knows the heart and soul of America - and he’ll lead us into a…
The Dem Politicians don't care because to them this IS normal! THIS IS DISGUSTING AND  BIDEN IS A PIG! Look how uncombfortable cease young children are with him! #VoteNoToPedoJoe #Trump2020 🇺🇸
It's NOT okay to sexually assault ANYONE EVER! TELL ME WHY ARE YOU ONLY FOCUSING ON TRUMP AND NOT BIDEN?
100% correct! Biden is in front of all these cameras touching all these children smelling their hair putting his hands all over their bodies in front of everyone so if he could do that imagine this shit he does behind closed doors!!
Remarkable that Trump somehow has the credibility among his followers to criticize Biden's faith and belief in God?  Its akin to watching Stalin lecture Eisenhower about democracy.  The hubris is hard to fathom.  The enabling by his supports - impossible to swallow.
Never said he wasn’t there just said that Biden has been hiding 🤷🏻‍♂️
Bruh to be fair Biden has been hiding in his basement this whole time
Joe Biden as usual fantasy he hasn't repeated himself.A Black VP just to get a Black vote. Lol He thinks all Black people think the same. He is always about race.We are all Americans color does not matter when will they figure that out and stop catorgizing people sick of it.
If you cared about all the people that put you in office you would not be doing all you can to hurt us by going against President Trump Whom happens to be doing good for Americans Why would you  campaign to get Biden elected He is unfit and y know it.
Pelosi and Biden must have done media training together.  They just babble and make little sense.  All that plastic surgery seems to tugged too hard on her brain.
You are your own best commercial for Biden. #DumpTrump2020That's not true. while Biden's copies of his papers are at the University of Delaware, the Senate has access to it's own records. Otherwise there would be no Senate Archives. The minutes of every committee meeting, all employment and personnel records, copies of legislation etc.
You want higher taxes, more regulation and China to own us feel free to vote for Biden. 50 years in govt no accomplishments
There is no time more powerful in filtering out the adults from the children than the few months leading up to this specific election. Every single person who claims they will not vote for Biden is a petulant child who hasn't suffered enough to understand what is at stake.
What are you talking about? Trump is 74 and obese. Biden was out on his bicycle while Trump was sitting his fat ass in a golf cart.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
That is a privilege you have. The ramifications of Trump's shit "leadership" are overwhelmingly impacting POC communities. Biden/Harris are nothing but a shit stopgap. We've made big strides in down ballot races. We will NEVER get a proper progressive candidate in the President's
Was waiting for Biden supporters to try this one!! No way in h*ll are we Republicans going to let Joe out of this one!!! I CANNOT wait to see those debates!! But also the AMERICAN PEOPLE deserve to hear his plan!!! We haven’t heard ANYTHING FROM THIS MAN!
Tell Joe Biden: Make Abortion Access for All* A Top Priority
Now that6a Biden endorsement!
By no means am I saying she’s the anomaly, what I am saying is she aint lock up all them black &amp; brown people disproportionately in jail now. The mandatory minimums,etc is what I meant by her having to do her job while people like Biden wrote the laws that featured the minimums.
Better than i could have dreamed.
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
There is precisely zero chance of that. If you want to cause the demise of a right-wing party vote for Biden and the Dems. This year, if the Republican party pays a real price for Trumpism it could collapse, nothing else will have a positive effect for progressives.
See what you wrote? That's part of the noise I was referring to, no one who votes Green would choose Trump over Biden on the merits unless they were mind numbingly stupid. And how has not supporting Democrats worked out for the Green Party? How's Climate Change doing under Trump?
That's simply not true. More will get done about climate change with Biden than Trump. It's not even close, and a vote for anyone but Biden, is a vote for Trump. The big money donors have to be shown that Trumpism will cut them out of the power structure.
In the real world either Biden or Trump will win. I'm not a Democrat, I have voted third party for decades. But Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to the Republic, voting for a candidate with no chance of winning while Trump is on the ballot is no better than voting Trump
If you support Trump, and voting for anyone but Biden this year is exactly that. You are not anti war. You'll pretend, but it won't be true.
Trump is dangerous. Biden is a terrible stop gap.
Someone else explained to me about Bidens win validating running lame candidates like him and I totally get that and agree. But, at least to me, Trump is a grave and dangerous threat. While Biden is a shitty disappointment.
Thanks for this explanation. I understand what you're saying, but, to me, Trump is a grave immediate threat. But I don't disagree with what you're saying about the harm of validating candidates like Biden.
Not my party and you're full of it. In no way is Biden worse than Trump. We will have 250,000 needlessly dead citizens by election day because of Trump's incompetence and his irrational destruction of anything associated with Obama. And the environment? Biden worse? GTFOHWTS.
Biden was accused by someone who changed her story 6 times (and it's still sketchy). Trump has been credibly accused of assault over 2 dozen times, confessed to it on tape and is fighting a subpoena for his DNA that will prove his guilt. These two things are not the same.
Supporting anyone other than Biden is normalizing the brutal rape,  threatening and intimidation of 13 year old girls. There is also no getting around that fact.
During the 8 years of the Biden Vice Presidency, he expertly hid his Sharia Law obsession, only to enslave us now!
When you encounter “leftists” who claim they see no difference between Biden and Trump and refuse to vote for Biden, they are either Trump supporters, or too dumb to know the difference between life and death. Block them and move on.
This clip of Biden on a bike, you would think would not be what fox would want to put out there. Could you picture Trump on a bike. Omg i would pay.
He only got 11% of the vote here. I thought maybe he'd win because Biden people would stay home. CT did vote for McCain over Bush in 2000. The primary is always too late here to matter.
like I know Kamala is questionable at best but it’s rly infuriating to see people try to dissuade others from voting for her/Biden. Do y’all really want 4 more years of trump? Don’t do that 3rd party shit this time. Save that for 2024. We need stability now
Ryan Grim, who broke Tara Reade's story, was also the first to report on Christine Blasey Ford. There's a lot of complicated details, but here's a timeline of what happened
Even if I do vote third party... What does that accomplish? I don't understand. I'm not at all happy with Biden. Am I looking at this wrong? Misunderstanding?
You have the temerity to call Biden a racist, and then tweet about preventing “low income” (“where black people live”)housing... that takes chutzpah. 2 terms-“housewife” and “red lining”-are 50’s terms and you and your father were masters of segregating blacks away from whites.
Did you just type this up a week or two ago and drop in the name of whoever Biden picked afterwards?
Uhhhh RacistImpeachedOrangeAssClown, she is not your opponent, Joe Biden is.  Time for some more "memory" exercises.... #Resist
I have to disagree with you. Biden has locked up black people. Kamala had to do her job effectively to get to this moment. She doesn’t make the laws but it’s her job to enforce them. Biden wrote in those laws locking up black people &amp; making automatic minimums
Um, Bishop? Biden IS a Catholic. His faith is integral to his life.
Lincoln created a cabinet of rivals with the idea that they would be reluctant to disagree with him and would not hold back when they thought there was a better way to do something. Biden is just as fearless.
Why Kamala Harris was picked as Joe Biden’s running mate
Ok, if we’re being honest, why is Tulsi not the candidate?  If we’re being shady about shit, why is she not the VP pick?  The Dems shoved Bernie aside for the likes of Biden, who legit can’t remember his boss’s name, and doesn’t know what year it is or the office he’s running for

Trump, Biden top 80 percent; few glitches at polls, in flood of mailed ballots
Why Kamala Harris was picked as Joe Biden’s running mate
Some people view voting for Biden and Harris as damage control. Its more of a trolley problem. Damage will be done either way, but I don't think you have the moral luxury to not pick a side when Trump is stoking the flames of America's fascist institutions
I don't think a lot of people realize how troubling Kamala's prosecutorial record actually is– No one should be cheering her on while innocent people rot in jail. Vote against Trump and Pence, but if Biden and Harris win, don't get complacent
Warren has radical policies that don’t win elections but at least she talks like a leader and sounds like she truly believes what she’s saying. Every other candidate is corrupted. Biden and trump don’t believe half the things they say, it’s all for the sound bytes.

We came pretty close with Bernie twice. We’re stuck with Biden but we’ve come pretty far as a country in that respect.
I don’t necessarily disagree with that. Biden is way too old to run for reelection in 2024 potentially. It’s probably gonna be Harris vs AOC
Maybe. But I feel like Biden is not actively harmful to our civic institutions like Trump is, even though they’re not in their right minds.

Campaign in need of cash? You’re a stooge. Check the FEC records you lying has been. Biden is FLUSH w cash. Trump is so down in polls he’s running ads on Fox! Call the wifey home. She’s gone in 83 days.
She is right...the answer is not more police officers...and for the record Biden Harris are not saying defund the police...
He’d be so damaged after that. Heck maybe Biden will give him some ambassadorship. That might be more likely than Warren leaving the senate.
Best chance for Harris to become president is to assume it, should Biden win and not serve the full term as many pundits predict - Too much Harris-baggage otherwise !
Biden was warning about #COVID19 in January when Trump was saying we had 15 cases that would go down to zero!  Now we have over 5 million cases &amp; 168,000+ dead with no national testing strategy!  #TrumpDeathToll169k #GOPGenocide  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
We desperately need a president we can trust!  Joe Biden is that man. Joe understands our issues because he’s lived them. He earned everything he’s achieved honestly  #VoteBiden to return trust to the White House  #wtp2020   #wtp432
Somebody at the FBI definitely needs to interview her concerning this threat to Biden--what does she know and who does she think is going to harm him?
"Stop playing politics with the virus" is actually a good line. Completely disingenuous, hypocritical, and fraudulent, but actually the classic response to the DEVASTATING attack that Biden and Harris made on him yesterday. Don't "play politics" when I kill people--just mourn.
Trump's approval rating is not going hold up for long if Biden/Kamala do daily briefings

Swell to have our state mocked on Colbert ;Sen. Kamala Harris Breaks New Ground As Joe Biden's Running Mate  via
Please I know I didn’t follow this thread from jump, but we have to believe there is a new tomorrow w the Biden/Harris ticket. Look at the people on their teams on their websites they have strong roots yes she was a atty 4 da po ,but fair in life ruining bs petty crimes dismissal
I wonder how many times joe biden asked kamala harris if she owned any 7/11s when he found out she’s Indian
Okay -- except I was specifically reacting to umpteen zillion tweets, many tagging the FBI, that said PIRRO IS THREATENING BIDEN!!1! I'm perfectly fine with saying that Pirro is a doofus conspiracy theorist who operates in bad faith.
I’m just over 600. Slowed down a lot and am very happy with the progress. If anyone else wants to follow I follow back. You’ll be entertained at least once. That more than we can say for Biden or Trump at the moment
A fair point. But easily enough refuted by, well, Biden remaining on the ticket. Far zanier and more dangerous conspiracy theories are on their way.
What is it you're not sure I believe? I don't think Pirro threatened Biden in any way. And I think that Pirro says insane things all the time, so a random conjecture from her that Biden might not be on the ticket doesn't move the needle for me.
Great sporting from   #BidenHarris2020Landslide
You have used racist &amp; sexist tropes against  all week. Words like "angry mean, phoney &amp; nasty" are just energizing all of us "nasty women" to work hard to get  Biden/Harris elected!!  She is already polling ahead of you!! 👍 #MisogynistTrump #NastyWomenVote
Mr Biden,  love ya, and Kamala too  . Yesterday, I noticed that when you removed your mask that you touched your face. Please I know it’s difficult but you have to get out of the habit we can’t lose you guys please b careful
I suspect she is saying (without evidence, natch) that Biden's health will be an issue between now and November. On the Pirro Controversy Scale, that hardly even rates a mention, much less a Twitter riot.
Oh, boy, crazyloonperson Jeaninne Pirro is trending, let's see what the story is.  People are saying she *threatened* Joe Biden?? Holy crap.  {watches clip}  Uh, guys. That's not remotely a threat.
Could u please find out what  thinks will happen to Joe Biden in the next 2 months? Sounded like a threat to his life. If anyone said the same abt  u'd look into it. Pls extend the same courtesy to our former vicePOTUS &amp; current presidential candidate

I agree Bill. It’s painful, but I think Biden has to go through the gauntlet and do it. Otherwise he just looks too wimpy. He needs to endure the indignity of it. And I think his presidential-ness will blow Trump’s coarseness and sophomoric-ness away.

Your hallucinating. There’s absolutely no excitement for Biden.
I’m pretty sure it’s not in Biden’s job description to marry people! He was making a political, pandering statement. And you bought it.the baker doesn’t have to make the cake, but govnmt clerks must follow the law. If against their conscience they need a new job.
You still have not explained why you think Biden would have done a better job, considering he said publicly he wouldn’t have shut down travel from China or Europe .
This person hasn’t said one thing that Biden would have done to manage this differently. Maybe because he publicly said he would have kept allowing travel from everywhere and hundreds of thousands more people would have died
So Biden would have shut Europe down but not China? Not sure where you are going with this. Explain what Joe would have done better
Did you agree with Biden when he said Trump was xenophobic for shutting down China travel ? Explain how Biden would have done a better job.
He launches all kinds of useless "operations"....looking forward to action with Biden Harris starting with a federal response to #TrumpVirus
I never manipulate you!Joe Biden is perfect for President Of The United States!
Were you with Biden when he said he would not shut down travel from China or.. ? What has he mismanaged exactly?

Totally different as Being Jewish is not considered a grave sin in the teachings of the Catholic faith. Why do you have a problem with this? You cannot promote abortion, homosexuality and say you are a good Catholic. Biden is free to find a religion that meets his beliefs.

Yea there is. It’s all calculated risk. It’s pretty clear from the VP pick that Biden isn’t counting on the lefts vote. He must think he has enough moderate righty’s to cover

I love how predicting an outsider would beat Hilary Clinton in 2016 means you are a fortune teller of politics. I can name 9 more people who made that prediction who believe Biden will win. The polls are the polls, we will not know until Election Day.
Biden and Harris have written off the left. They aren’t planning on getting the vote and they dont care. They are trying to win with center right voters. So be it. It’s a bold strategy cotton. Let’s see if it pays off.

Tulsi Gabbard, who was still on the ballot here in CT, would have been a far better VP choice for Biden; but now, Gabbard's unravelling of Kamala Harris in the debates will be republican campaign ads.

What are gonna talk about every day on The View now that Biden has selected a Black woman as his running mate?  Hahaha
A little different this time when Biden is senile and likely to step down after a few months. The VP needs to be qualified and Harris is not. She was the first person out of the Democratic primaries. How on earth is she a good pick overall?
Maybe if you are talking about Kamala the Ugandan Giant from the WWE. But if you are talking about Kamala Harris, she’s not even close to being qualified for President, which she will be if Biden wins, bc he will be unfit for office and step down within months.

I don't often agree with you, but this headline really does come across as them just trolling you.  If, for some reason, they feel that it's important to report on how you are voting come November, they simply could have said "Meghan McCain won't commit to voting for Biden".
Good Biden doesn’t need the debates
Seriously you’d rather have me vote for Senator Biden? The much inferior candidate for sure. Especially for the poor.
Biden will be TOLD who his VP is going to be. #TrojanHorse
You do know that when you lose, “bigly” you will go to prison? YOU committed Treason, not Obama. Not Biden. YOU!
