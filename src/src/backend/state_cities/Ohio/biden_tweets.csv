"When it was pointed out that he actually can’t win in 2020—that he won’t be on enough ballots...and thus was serving as a spoiler, West replied: “I’m not going to argue with you. Jesus is King.”"
Biden is by far the worst candidate.  Dude can’t even speak correctly and is a pedo.  If you voting for him then you are voting out of pettyness
Joe Biden personally intervened to keep the word “occupation” out of the official Democratic platform, according to a new report.

U.S. intel: Russia trying to hurt Biden, but China, Iran don't want Trump
Show me the Black family that thinks Joe Biden is going to make their lives better and I'll show you a family that is already lost.
😂😂😂😂I was pulling for Biden but everyone killed him before he had a chance 😂and maaaaannnnn I been coming up on more and more black trump supporters and it’s a shame but you ain’t never lied! People don’t know
If that's what's actually happening, fine, but stop calling this "Americans united for Joe Biden" virtual campaign rally / TV special "the Democratic National Convention."  Our culture's dire sloppiness with words is a real and serious part of its dysfunction.
As most of my followers know I'm just a simple man. So I'm going to keep this real simple. It's no mystery that the Democratic party has taken advantage of the blind loyalty of Black voters for decades. The ultimate proof of that is a vote for Biden. You're making it too easy.🤔
That aside, what gets me most here is that it's one thing for Kasich to be featured in the line-up of a kind of "Americans united for Joe Biden" virtual campaign rally / TV special. I can quarrel with that but it's at least a concept that can stand up to initial examination.
Randy Quaid to Joe Biden: "In the words of my generation: Up yours!"
This has to be satire right? Comrade is how Communists call each other the #NoComradesUnder1k aimed at communist/socialist/leftist so of course, it's full of Sanders and Green Party supporters that dislike Biden.
Fortunately, Biden is ethical. He may not be right 100% of the time (who is?) but I have no doubt that he will put this country over his own financial interests.
For a man who hates and hurts God. That was said by the President.  Biden is Catholic, like most of Congress, so Catholics hates and hurts good? What test do you have to pass to please you?
Tell that to racist Biden
Biden world.
Biden should ask China to find trumps missing tax returns just to watch the GOP EXPLODE.
Did Trump just come to Cleveland and accuse Biden of being against God? Yes...he did.
early 2000s dirtbag biden is a great bit
Trump's Rant About How Joe Biden Will Kill God Was Insane But Clarifying  via
Both political parties are responsible for mass incarceration. Biden is not solely responsible.
Ofcourse the Russians dnt want Biden to win
Was there any doubt in any sane person's mind that Biden was always the front man for Obama and his crew?  himself said he was disappointed that he ran out of time to "transform" America and since the coup failed,  needed a Plan B. Joe is Plan "B"!
I’m so over the VP discourse. Biden should pick whoever he thinks would be his best governing partner.  Do I want it to be a strong progressive? Absolutely.   Will I be annoyed if he picked a moderate who shares his beliefs? Probably so.   Will it matter in the long run? No.
Trump Told Ohio Biden Will Hurt God With ‘Live Or Let Die’ As His Anthem
I don't really want joe biden to win, but I do want trump to lose, so 🤷
Can Biden ban Trump Hotels by Executive Order? Asking for private companies everywhere.
The Kasich idea is still terrible but I sympathize greatly with this person:  “We want to have as few elected officials as possible,” said one Biden adviser. “Every one of these politicians — they give them three minutes but then they take 15."
I mean obviously it’s pandering to his deeply evangelical base but are they really ~that~ far removed from reality they think biden hates god? there’s never been an anti religious president and I kinda doubt there ever will be
i’m curious where trump is getting his unhinged “biden will abolish religion and god” shit like nothing remotely about biden’s campaign is anti religious lol
Everyone on this thread: Biden can't win Ohio.  Ohio:
This is the official Biden Trump dirt bike jump song
Can they get it to Biden before the debates???
Trump made a speech not long ago &amp; does all the time really without notes or a teleprompter while interacting with others. Biden can’t get through a free sentences. People need to stop letting their hatred for Trump lead them to a tragic vote. You want Joe to have nuclear codes?
I meant Jill Biden. Either which way this is their way of getting Joes image out there while still hiding him out. Is bullshxt!
Alright everyone  is all paid up and officially a corporate sponsor of my upcoming dirt bike jump over the Biden Trump debate in Cleveland thank you for your support
Mark my words, when Joe Biden names his VP, the right will aim to make the race solely about her. Biden has proven too tough an opponent so they will go with the whole "she's only a heartbeat from the president and she is literally Fidel Castro-Hitler only worse."
I cant wait for Biden to win, then call you all out when he offers up a "thoughts and prayers aren't good enough " when god forbid something bad happens
Biden the Ultimate Risk – Are Votes Tools in the Hands of the Free, or Weapons in the Hands of Haters?
Do you realize: He has NO Faith in any religion so keeping it private is a moot point; he dragged Biden’s Faith (which he regularly displays) into a political lie; and that the point of the interview was to prove exactly how unreligious he is. Stop defending the indefensible!!!
I can vote for Biden if he chooses anyone for VP BESIDES Susan Rice or Karen Bass
#FoxNews needs to get rid of  there is no place for someone on their network that makes excuse after excuse about #JoeChina AKA  #Racist comments #Biden has a 50 year history of being a Racist. Do some homework #JessicaTarlov
What if Joe Biden doing that?!!
At least one of them told it like it is and it sure wasn't  #Biden is a racist and this lady pointed it out perfectly, what does #Tarlov do she defends him.
One of the most bias people ever to be on #FoxNews is  she knows #Biden is a giant #Racist and she still tries to defend his Racist comments. Open your eyes #Tarlov you're a closed minded moron.....
I haven’t been able to succinctly articulate my feelings on how the Dems are handling this VP pick but this article does a pretty good job...
What was hunter Biden doing in Moscow??
I'm being told Biden will announce his VP next week by my sources.
BTW... how about quoting some of the many many horrible things that your guy Trump has said. Its easy to quote the things Biden has said because there's so few. With Trump let's start with him saying about White supremacists, 'there are good people on both sides.'
There is no "incompetence" involved. The media is making it look that way with their breathless speculation but that's not on Biden. He's doing precisely what is always done.
Often true. McCain announced Palin on Labor Day weekend eve, just before the convention. Obama announced Biden on August 22, 2008; convention started on August 25. Others have been earlier. Kerry announced Edwards 4th of July weekend. It varies.
I don't agree it was "botched." Biden hasn't done anything. different from any previous candidate. It's just that the media has made this into a beauty pageant because I guess Trump's daily degradations aren't newsy enough.
im from Ohio and im ridin with biden
If someone has already decided not to vote for Trump, they would then vote for Biden, unless they had an additional choice. That's the game  and  are playing. Kanye has millions of followers and many don't understand the power votes.
Huh, I thought that social media was supposed to be biased against conservatives??? But what do we have here? It looks like Instagram is biased against Biden.   Where is the #ConservativeOutrage at political bias in social media?

Today they sent me a video about settling for Biden that was set to the tune of "Go Go Go Joseph." I've never felt more seen.
They’re not close to the same. I’m conservative so clearly Biden isn’t ideal but he’s not a narcissist + he’ll be willing to listen/act on his advisors/experts he puts in place to help him. Trump has his message if advisor disagrees he/his people undermine and attack the expert.
Foreign Press is Seriously Questioning Biden’s Cognitive Ability
You know with the other two, we arent getting anything we want. Kanye is probably crazy enough to actually rubber stamp something positive into existence. With trump amd biden, we already know what we get. A giant shit sandwich.
you keep jumping back and forth man ... this is what liberals and people without facts do . they can’t stay focused for 30 seconds .   biden probly did launder money through the ukraine man . which means HE SHOULD be investigated . which means the “favor “.... is just justice .
Biden's clean energy push resonates in Senate battlegrounds
When you hear Right wing media a swear that they make Biden seems like the Devil.
I do believe the riffles will be safe under Biden hahaha
I AM JOE BIDEN AND APPROVE THIS MESSAGE:
Regardless of what you might think, we only have two choices this Nov. Joe Biden or trump. A vote for Kanye, a write-in, or a Didn’t Vote are all helping trump. Can you justify participating in the final destruction of our democracy? If not, you Must vote for Joe.  #Biden2020
One source said  would appear on the same night as  "early in the week in a demonstration of unity. The duo would be designed to showcase a broad anti-Trump coalition that is backing Biden."
Ignorance on top of ignorance! Who in their right mind thinks, “we’ll go after all those masses of ^maybe* Biden voters by offering an insane DJT cronie? Perso, I think this potentially pulls votes from DJT. Mostly, I hope it scalds the “Kardashian” brand. Grifters en mass.
Liar! Biden doesn’t want to take our guns. He thinks we might need them for protection from your secret police force!
Joe Biden is the Democratic presidential candidate America deserves.  Note: America is consistenly on some trash as evidenced by the fact that we elected lifetime failure, reality show personality, and Oompa Loompa - Donald Trump - as POTUS
the last time this man was near a church people were gassed!  To attack Joe Biden on his religion is BEYOND THE PALE!  Can you honestly say you made the right vote on impeachment?  You both deserve to be voted out of office!
Ya joe Biden is the answer. Easy to point out people’s faults and act like you would of had a plan. Raise the F out of taxes to support more people to sit at home. Along with supporting another stimulus to encourage more to sit at home. I’ve heard from people what they make. Joke
So Meg puts out a video y’all don’t like and now y’all back to roasting her🤣🤣🤣🤣🤷🏾‍♂️I wish it could be that easy to get everybody off the Biden train like that.
But she will be judged far less harshly than a nonbinary person would be judged. Biden needs to pick a nonbinary running mate.
Joe Biden will hurt you?   How is that possible?
This is absolutely the wrong position. Either vote for Biden regardless of his VP choice, or risk four more years of the grand finale of America as the greatest nation on earth.
Compare the campaigns’ websites. Biden’s includes tons of detailed policy proposals. Trump’s doesn’t say anything in particular about what he would do with a 2nd term. There is no comparison.
Interesting. Joe Biden told me that means you aren't black
Just look back at everybody who told us to get over everything Biden says. “Shut the hell up and grow up” “He’s the only way to beat Trump” He knows he can say anything and he’ll get support from the elite corporate democrats and the easy to sway Biden Bros🤷🏾‍♂️
I see so many in the comments drinking Biden’s kool side. There’s no defense on what he said that’s why he apologized. It’s obviously how he thinks. Imagine what he says privately. And don’t come at me with Trump. His wrongs don’t make Biden right
He is you don’t see it !  Biden is the son of Lucifer which is Barry Obama  ,,
I'm not sure who needs to hear this but Bernie Sanders was much better in getting voters excited than Joe biden was.
That it’s Joe Biden and you hate Joe Biden
As Dr. King clarified for us all, an “eye for an eye” leaves everyone blind. We’ve become a nation of the blind leading the blind. Open your eyes. VOTE BIDEN. #Biden2020

Because Joe Biden is racist.
Imagine he’s in one of the talks with China or Russia or whoever and he has one of stupid outburst and starts talking off-the-wall they will laugh at us they won’t take Biden seriously how could anyone think that is the right move to make
#JoeChina AKA  "You ain't black if you vote Trump" contrasting #AfricanAmerican, Latino diversity". "You can't go to a 7-11 without an Indian accent". How #racist is this guy? #Biden is almost a #WhiteSupremacist
Why Is Joe Biden Silent on the Attacks Against Catholic Statues, Churches, and Beliefs?
Does it matter though? The DNC chose Biden as the nominee and made sure he "won", despite no organization to speak of and no tangible support. They must think the same is possible (or already assured) in November.
Not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump and four years of uncontrolled kleptocratic dictatorship. Don’t again vote for the Russia backed Jill Stein spoiler candidate.
Amazing..   I have cone to a conclusion that Biden will have to back out in a week or two... new candidates named at convention ... excitement by dems of course .. but no results on election night will be the beginnings of Nancy trying to drag Potus out of WH. Not habbening !
I don’t give a crap if Biden even forgets his own home address. We can’t have 4 more of this shitshow.
Mr. President  #JoeChina AKA  has a nearly 50-year history of being a #Racist this is his true belief. How many #AfricanAmerican were incarcerated as a direct result of his Crime bill? No Doubt about how #Biden is racist ask #LeoTerrell and #LarryElder
PLEASE don’t vote for him or write in a vote for him. He’s trying to take votes away from Biden. This is not ok
Me too, and they’re absolutely right.
if biden is corrupt ... perhaps ... he should be investigated... and ... the president is the head of the branch of govt that enforces the law bro .... 😂

No, all trump wanted to do was s speak to his vapid base of evangelicals because he thinks they need to be reminded how religious &amp; devoted this god he is in contrast to Biden bc even there his support may be a widdle shaky and he is mightily concerned abt it.
Electing Biden will cause the Dems to lose both the house and senate in 2022.
I agree he’s not going away.   His ego would never allow that.  But what is the impetus for staying with a guy who may have been repudiated by 10 points or more?  Barring a Biden melt down, I just don’t see a reason for discipline to suddenly manifest in Trump and tighten this.
Lmaoooo this was a good one. Between him and Biden I get all the comedy I need these days. Idk how I’m supposed to pick just one let’s just put both in there n see what happens. Dual presidents, double trouble
If Biden loses they'll blame the leftists, but if they win they'll ignore any idea supported by leftists.  Mark my words.

Yeah says the true blue Biden supporter. I’m sure you would give  President Trump the same benefit of the doubt right?...lol
This is crazy, I hate biden almost equally. But it's hard to imagine another 4 years of just heading toward facism at lightspeed under trump. Or it could be on a river boat casually with Joe. It's like the right only knows the 2nd amendment exists,  the rest dont matter
WHO has groveled to Xi constantly? Not Biden.
That lady would blow trump or biden out of the water in a debate. I'm sorry but like her or not, she is 10x as smart as either if those career ladder climbing ass kisses. She would tear them up with just words.
People trying to shame people for not loving Biden is dumb.
All as I heard was biden saying black people dont have culture. which is not only not true, but really stupid. How are we seriously electing old white guys,  that are so far out of touch with the world. I want someone who has a glimpse of normal life as a leader. Fucking biden.
Yeah, I think that's fair. Hadn't considered that.  Though, I hope you can admit Trump's resume in the "comments degrading/harming/marginalizing minorities/poor people" is a LOT longer/bulkier than Biden. Probably why he's held to a different standard on the topic.   Right?
Have asked that question and their answers always start with ..,but Hillary or ....but Biden. So when I ask them to sit with me with evidence all of a sudden to convo stops or changes. They are as ignorant as the useless idiot in the White House #VoteHimOut

I agree with you, but can Biden *please* stop making these types of gaffes?  The Trump campaign just eats them up.
In my never ending quest to try and understand those who think different then I........ can someone explain how Biden’s most recent comments on black people not being “diverse” isn’t racist? And then tell me how the president saying that would be received?
Maybe if Biden promises not to hurt God Kayne will back off?
Trump hadnt completed a coherent sentence in 4 years and dont get me started on the lies.. My point is that even with Biden the way he is. he is still more competent than Trump, and that truly is a sad tbing gor our country

Analysis | Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’ By Glenn Kessler
Let's make a list of trump's divisive statements and compare. I'll put my money on Biden.
One more time: "Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly diverse attitudes about different things," #Biden said
I can't stand seeing Trump signs where at one time the vote was blue collar, union worker blue, but I'm also seeing Biden signs in places I haven't expected. Exaggerating what's wrong isn't realism, it's as skewed as an overly rosy view. Effective organizing requires clarity.
If they don't like Biden, they probably weren't voting for him in the 1st place and now they're not going to vote for Trump. Mission accomplished!
YOU HAVE NO CLUE AND YOU TOTALLY DISRESPECT AND UNDERESTIMATE AFRICAN AMERICANs' INTELLIGENCE AND DEPTH.  Big surprise there, huh?   AND Mr. Biden CLARIFIED what he was stating.   YOU NEED TO STOP YOUR EVILNESS.  NOW, IS THE TIME FOR YOU TO BE BEGGING FOR GOD'S MERCY.  REPENT!
Another crazy cat lady for Biden.  Does inhaling cat crap fumes turn you into a liberal Democrat
Boaters parade Lake Erie near President Trump's Bratenahl fundraiser  .........NOT one word about this from our local tv stations this morning. They are all biden ass lickers!
This just in:  Joe Biden has tested positive for being a closet racist. So sad to hear. Probably will never make a full recovery from this. Thoughts and prayers
Biden’s comments are. Trump mispronunciations is not. True.
Democrats don't care. Biden will be their puppet and do the bidding of their radical left. That's the way it is shaking out.
how stupid do you think we are?  You are becoming an insult to the American people.  CNN avoids on-air coverage of Biden's 'Are you a junkie?' remark about taking a cognitive test  #FoxNews
If you put away your bias for a minute you can easily find the 30 years of Biden’s racist history.  It’s not hard to find.
Yeah, Biden said all that. It was demeaning. Trump didn’t. Does that clarify it for ya?

Joe Biden has a big mouth on the loose lipped you imagine someone that doesn’t know where he is doesn’t know what he still doesn’t know how he’s doing it to keep secrets for the government I just can’t see it and if American votes for him I just can’t see how they could do that
Apart from the message (which clearly also was a flub), now you see why the Dems have kept Biden hidden.  Stammering. Blinking. Seemingly forgetting where he's going. Trump is going to have a field day with this.
I saw what you were saying about President Trump saying Biden was against God of course he speaking to his base there what you’re allowed to do politics are dirty but Democrats did it to themselves did you forget about this?
Racist? Trump? Did you hear Biden’s race comments yesterday? He is the racist. Trump has done FAR more for minorities than any president in a long time. If Trump is a racist then he isnt a very good one. #Opportunities
Racist are you seriously that far out of touch Bill? No one has done more for minorities than Trump. You ever hear Biden speak? No one is a bigger racist than him.

Oh yeah, Biden and the other democrats have good reason to take black votes for granted. There is never any scrutiny of these politicians among black voters. Democrats have little reason to value the black vote because we give it to anyone with a D next to their name so easily

Woke up.  Trump still in office, smh.  Just donated to the Biden Campaign.  May not be much $, but every time I am able, I do.
I'm losing followers faster than Biden, wth? More and more each day. #IFB except brand new accounts.
I don't think you have to be a "trump lover" to see that the Biden campaign keeps him under wraps most of the time. I'm no fan of POTUS. But it's disheartening to see Biden botch the two or three interviews they let him do per month. How is this a presidential campaign?
Yeah that’s the kind of old white man crap that makes me not like him that much. That doesn’t make him a white nationalist. Again Biden was far down my list of Democrats i would’ve liked to see nominated. That still puts him lightyears beyond Trump
Told someone I wonder how long it takes for someone to accuse me of racism. Listen, do me a favor and keep your thoughts on my character to yourself. You don’t know me one bit, Sam. If you think calling out Biden’s racism is racist, idk what to tell ya.

My point is the fact regardless of what you think of Trump, the message during the campaign to drain the swamp of career politicians, appealed to a lot of people. Biden embodies the swamp.

I’m sorry but Bush era Republicans slobbering over Joe Biden makes me sick.

Instagram's algorithm blocked negative coverage of Trump, but not Biden - CNN Business
No 💙. Now please use your platform to encourage young voters to vote for Biden so we can get president orange the fuck out of office
Holy crap, this 'take your gun away' AGAIN? It was said about Johnson, Carter, Clinton and Obama but I'm still a Democratic gun owner. You think Biden can "Hurt God", but he can't cancel the 2nd Amendment. And you can't cancel the 1st Amendment.
Biden is pro-abortion...
Yeah, Kamala Harris's race had nothing to do with it. Pure political instinct on  Biden and Gabbard's part.🙄
Trump campaign ad features doctored images of Joe Biden 'in his basement, alone' - USA TODAY
I termed Biden "Laughing Zack" when watching Ryan's VP debate with him 8 yrs ago. Now I realize that was just his ploy to avoid showing up with little abilty to make sensible conversation even then.
Biden is clearly against blacks.

Biden camp taps Republican Trump foe Ana Navarro to rev up Latino voters - NBC News
Who wrote that for Biden?
Biden is without a doubt better, no acting necessary.. There is and has never been a more incompetent president/nominee than Donald Trump
Biden? We're talking about Trump.
😂😂😂 see what Biden got idiots saying...
First saying what Biden has done equals what Trump has done and continues to do is a spectacularly false equivalence. Second a true white nationalist would die before helping let alone being a major reason a black man became president so there’s that
Of who? A babbling senile Biden?
It'll turn into Trump attacking and trying to draw Biden in. Waste of time. I would say if it's done remotely. Cutting off each candidate so the other doesn't know what was said and so neither could interrupt. Then we could hear what each offers.
Asinine? Did you hear Biden’s racist statements today?
Ben Shapiro warns Biden 'falling apart' after bizarre interview, would be 'ripped up and down' if Republican

Trump will lose to Biden with this bold VP pick, say CA Dems - MSNBC
I’m from Ohio- about 30 miles south of Cleveland. 1) this is not a crowd in Cleveland, you wouldn’t get that big of a turnout in Cleveland. 2) My neighborhood- made up of mostly Biden supporters, including myself. MAGA isn’t as strong as you want it to be.
Lol Biden loses ground every time he opens his mouth. He needs to just stfu until Nov. 3rd.
Another Biden gem
Joe Biden is clearly suffering dementia so you won't actually be voting for Joe, you will basically be voting for whoever he picks as his VP.  It gets better. You won't really be voting for the VP either, you will be voting for whoever Obama and Soros choose. Maybe Pelosi!
As opposed to T rump and Pence? Anyone Biden picks will make a better ticket than T rump/Pence. C’mon now
NO and NO.  Mr. Biden is actually WORKING.... putting together &amp; PLANNING ways to dig U.S. out of the h*llhole GOP &amp; trump have put us in!!  it's *hear
Well this is not good, but it backs up my conviction that Pennsylvania is the State Biden needs to spend most of his time in.  What does  have to say?
This fucker is really testing me. I really don’t want to make calls for Joe Biden. Maybe for state legislative and the Supreme Court races.
Fuck em, vote for the Supreme Court seats. The main difference is spoiled milk Biden comes with a refrigerator stocked with healthy, edible foods. Rotten egg Trump is surrounded by more rotten eggs and an expired jar of mayo that's been there since 1985.
"Black" people come from many different parts of the world too; they're not all indigenous to Africa. Homogenizing their culture &amp; ethnicity is offensive.  Also, Biden could've easily made his point without making any reference to black people at all. His comment is bad form.
In all due respect if it’s that important then you shouldn’t vote Green this election. I get what you mean by California going to Biden but every vote for Biden is important in case Trump tries to claim some sort of conspiracy theory to negate the outcome.
Robin Williams Warned Us About Joe Biden Years Ago
I am willing to vote for Joe Biden to vote Trump out. I think that says it all.
NO victory, but the GOP is going to bring out VILE, evil LIES attacking Biden and dragging bad actors into the mix.   UGLY is an understatement.  The GOP &amp; trump &amp; putin have turned us against each other and many don't realize the manipulation.   🙏❤🇺🇸

All the far left Bernie people who dislike Biden may vote for Kanye as a big F-U to the system.
Joe Biden is Triple H
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?
Way too sensitive. Biden is such a great choice, right? Please tell me what that senile, old man has done in his 47 years in Government? Shame on his handlers and family for pushing him to do this. This is a circus!
I didn’t say anything derogatory re: Muslims I simply stated if Biden has control of the White House they would have more control. He said he wants to have Islam taught in schools. Damn right I’m a Christian! I don’t nd to know about Islam neither does most American Christians.
Joe Biden is the biggest racist that has ever run for President.
joe Biden is the biggest racist that has ever run for President.

Is there anybody that listens to Joe Biden speak and thinks nothing’s wrong?
Remember those memes where they said some dumb shit like “be scared of yellow cuz toasters are pony’s worst enemy’s and microwave are fun”  That’s literally Joe Biden. Wtf is going on?!
After watching Biden's most recent interview (cringe), Jorge Louis Borges' short story The Lottery of Babylon (proposing an arcane cult of randomness) would possibly produce better results than these two options.
Yo-sem-ite ...... Thighland......  Yea, it’s Biden’s mental acuity we need to worry about. 🙄
I will vote for Biden because he’s the way to get Trump out of office. Biden isn’t perfect, but isn’t a white nationalist and won’t condone it. He will help push the country left even if it isn’t as far as i would like. He will bring some much needed responsibility and experience
Portman supports a guy who thinks Biden can hurt God.
Imagine thinking this guy is some kind of defender of religion compared to Joe Biden, a vocal catholic  via
I see all these maps that have Biden ahead, but being a Browns fan I know a lot can go wrong between August and November.
I’ve kinda thought GOPers helping a Kanye were making a miscalculation. His “constituency” seems like it’d be white bro meme voters, who are probably more likely to support Trump than Biden anyway.
Thanks bro I’m just tired of being called racist like I literally was a liberal democrat (still pretty liberal) and a few weeks ago decided I’d rather have Trump than Biden. I wanted Bernie personally but he’s not in discussion anymore. I hate both parties now. I ❤️ populism tho
Can someone please tell people that Biden RSVP'D to the Debate Commission for 3 debates and .......well the other guy hasn't committed yet......
Biden's only chance of winning is staying in the basement and no debates. He would look like a fool against Trump.
The only reason you say that is because Trump would make Biden look so bad, he would be a laughing stock.
I respect your views, sir. You probably calling me a racist bigot behind ur screen for supporting trump &gt; Biden but I promise you I’m not. I care. I hope u can respect my views as well. Hv a good day man
Nope, don't care. Don't for Biden but don't want Trump getting away with his crimes. Biden it is.
God and Guns in the same sentence?? Yesterday  he made a video mocking  biden for praying..wonder  how he's  going to  explain that to GOD
Puh-lease. Tell me Joe Biden mispronounces a word in the next month and people aren’t going to jump all over him?
Ask Joe Biden...he’ll tell you after his hairy leg and kids story
People are fed info, some have gaffs. I'm not going to say he is a liar for it. Look at Biden's gaffs, a lot worse. If he was lying then he's biased and shouldn't be in the legislative branch, he should be in Congress.
Well ~90% released were black Americans who was out in there probably from Biden’s terrible crime bills.
President Trump claims Joe Biden opposes God during visit to Whirlpool plant in Clyde
Biden has a whole lot of what is needed to be president, and one of the most important is the intelligence and experience to fix what 45 will have left—a broken, sloppy mess in the federal government.
I agreed with a lot of the complaints against Biden but we have to acknowledge the privilege we have to choose to not vote for him. That choice was made in '16 for Hillary &amp; lead to Trump &amp; him being president is literally killing people, disproportionately black and brown people
Biden literally asked if a black reporter if he was a "junkie" after the reporter fairly asked him if he had taken a cognitive ability test
The racist who bankrupts casinos, who said he has “sex” in common with his daughter, has sex with porn stars while his wife is home with a baby &amp; who lies to get out of serving in Vietnam  maybe should try a different argument about Biden ;)
I’m willing to bet u didn’t know Joe Biden owns an island within seeing distance of EPSTEINS ISLAND..
I saw a video of Biden approaching and speaking to a homeless person, offering encouragement and some cash, filmed by a private citizen,  unbeknownst to Biden. The man has empathy and he’s a good soul, something tRump will never never never have!
Trump has gotten 160,000 of us killed through sheer stupidity, incompetence and indifference. If that doesn't hurt God, I am fucked if I know what Joe Biden could do.
Every house in Bratenahl has a Biden sign, the only house that has a Trump sign is a home with this tacky, obnoxious, oversized poster. There was a van driving through our town today with a Biden sign, me and some other real ones would honk our horn every time it passed lol.
You too miss. I’m sorry if I come across badly being agaisnt Biden but 1 day i hope you’ll see I care about issues in the black community sincerely and genuinely. I am even mulling starting an organization with a few of my black friends to discuss civil rights issues.
President Trump touts job growth and trade policies in northern Ohio visit, while wasting no time going after Fmr. VP Biden in a state that’s looking more and more like the battleground it traditionally has been.
We went up there to protest tonight. Was happy to see a lot of Biden signs.  But also encountered a lot of really scary, very angry, Trump supporters
Exactly!  It’s just denialism at this point for anyone who’s ever seen a loved one go through it and won’t see it in Biden.
👎 i listen and speak facts. Joe Biden has been terrible for black people since he got into politics
Joe Biden could have Prime Reagan as VP and be called a radical left socialist with antifa ties.
Exactly. Biden understands it's important to not travel during a pandemic.
I don't even think Biden wants to be president 🤣
Biden is a 78 year old loser who has been in politics for 40 years and now says he’ll be savior and fix all issues he helped create/exploit. I’m tired of this crap.
GOP is definitely worse. I agree. I’m not even republican idk why people attacking me so hard for calling out Biden’s racist past - and present
Don, a humans thoughts and mind aren’t determined by their skin color. Recent poll has roughly 28% black Americans identified as conservative while less i think like 26% as liberal. Black people aren’t monolithic like Biden wants to think. They just don’t hv another viable option
Biden could pick a cinderblock for his VP for all I care.
I agree! And so will anyone who sees this photo. Joe Biden is a great man and I will be proud to vote for him.
Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden
He mocked  Biden for praying.... he is DONE
Bro im getting hated on so hard for just telling them what Biden has said and done. But idc cuz I’m not here for them I’m here for people who are afraid to speak out agaisnt biden but know the harm he’s done.
Uh just cause Kamala is black doesn’t mean she’d get black vote. Again: black People think with brain not their skin color. Black People are NOT monolithic even tho biden thinks both of those things are true.
Oh ok I see what you’re saying.  But in terms of Joe Biden, I don’t like him lumping is all in a box like that.  Talking as if he has black folks all figured out, like we’re all one way.  That’s some bullshit to me
We will vote you out. We've had enough of you. Biden 2020
Joe Biden killing God was really the only way 2020 could end.
Are you manipulating people to vote for Biden? It’s someone’s right to vote whatever. And seeing that Biden is a racist and predator also, it’s very disappointing to see you endorse him like that. What do you really stand for?
WHAT THE ACTUAL PHUCKERY
Who cares my skin color, I listen to black people my age group and so many know Biden sucks. It doesn’t take lots of research to look up his record.
Those are legit facts. What did I say was false? Trump gave black Americans long-term HBCU funding lowest unemployment, wage growth first time in over decade, criminal justice reform, opportunity zones to spur growth in community. And all Biden did was say I’m a democrat I love u
So God's getting 'hurt' by Joe Biden? The more I read the first sentence, the less sense it makes.
Yessir. And I enjoy learning more from many of their different perspectives. Don’t forget: black people think with their brain, not skin color. Sadly Biden thinks black People are monolithic and owe Biden their vote.
Somebody driving through with one of those rent-a-sign trucks with Biden’s campaign logo.
So Donald Trump who is (current) president, is attacking Joe Biden as being some all powerful person who will "hurt the 2nd Amendment, hurt the Bible and hurt God." Mind you 'Uncle Joe' consequently holds no political office, so how powerful is he Mr. "President?"
Biden was terrible in polls when he ran for president but Obama knew it was smart to pick him. Biden hurt black community in crime bills and now look who’s cleaning up Biden’s mess: trump: signing criminal justice reform.
I don’t watch Fox News nor do I care about them. I speak what Biden himself said and make own conclusion. Biden only helped Obama get the white racist voters afraid of black president. Obama knee he was smart in picking him. Look at his past record on race... disturbing
Damn Joe Biden is powerful
Wait till Biden destroys him in the first debate in the same building the temp covid hospital was set up.
Didn’t you try that BS in 2016 abt the 2nd amendment? Now here we go again, Biden is not going after your guns folks. So stop trying to scare ppl to vote for you. Try being honest for a change. #TrumpIsLosing #AmericaOrTrump #WomenAgainstTrump #EndTrumpsWarOnAmerica
Did Biden write that for you? Holy nonsense word salad.
Joe Biden has hurt black Americans he whole career. From fighting against integration in schools to locking up fathers and youth. And now says they ain’t black if they don’t vote for him. He’s a joke
Where are the religious faithful of the GOP? Biden has exhibited more Christian values in one second than T rump has in his whole selfish life.
You do know Biden can’t make it through a sentence without fuckin it up right.
It will be a repeat of 2016 in Ohio. Biden will win the 7 big cities and Trump wins everywhere else.
I work in public transportation and didn't have a car when I got the job. When ppl wanna get somewhere they think is important they'll make a way trust and believe. Just remember Joe Biden wrote the crime bill there's also that
Just because you’re democrat, doesn’t mean you’re immune to being a racist.   Can we normalize that reality finally ?? Plenty of racist democrats out in America.   Biden says you “ain’t black” if u don’t vote for me and now “African American community isn’t diverse”   #RacistJoe
Assuming Biden wins and only serves 1 term, which is expected, then I believe that 2024 is primed to be an election about structural change.  This wasn’t that election.  This was the hold off fascism election. Sad.
If you don't vote for Biden you are defacto voting for Trump
Socialist how?  He stated he doesn’t support defunding the police (which doesn’t mean abolish police either).   How would the economy be worse than what Trump did? It was booming under Obama/Biden
Biden literally said if you don’t vote for me you’re not black. Reading comprehension lagging behind, eh  ??
Last time I checked Trump is president.  Not Obama. Not Biden. Not the NBA.
Yes they all suck.  But Trump is a unique authoritarian threat.  The guardrails are breaking down.  So yes, unfortunately voting for Biden is just getting us back to the same old corruption we’re more comfortable with.  From there the fight continues.
And nobody is surprised: Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden via
God (which ever version you might believe in) managed all these otherworldly feats but it’s Joe Biden that’s gonna take him down. It’s arguments like this that give me faith in humanity 😒😒😒
Biden actually goes to church and prays.
Can we get some sort of petition going to do a refresh on presidential candidates? The two options are haunting me. You’re telling me the best that this country can offer is Donald Trump and Joe Biden? Bologna
Biden now says that it is not good for democracy to be talking about prosecuting former Presidents. Here we go again, a white man protecting another white man even though he’s guilty of a crime. So who will protect black and brown men from white men? Only black and brown men. BLM
All he kept saying in Cleveland was: Biden is taking your guns and God. Your taxes are going off the charts. And China trade is going to fail. He repeated them 4-5 times.
I see way more Biden signs around here than Trump shit.  Sorry asshole.
Biden doesn’t want God to have guns?! How unChristian!
I think Im going to have to vote Biden 😔✌
You wear a shirt that says love everybody, but dick ride a president who has done harm to the LGBT community.  Disgusting.  Obama and Biden gave us human rights, Trump did all he could to take them away.
Not saying you’re wrong, but I don’t trust Biden either. We are going to need a better alternative or I can assure you he will get re-elected
😂😂 the airport security limits these gatherings.  Plus airport follows Covid.  But the racist and creepy Biden on the other hand. Yikes.
Did you completely gloss over that interview with Biden? That clown is a smug racist..
I mean of all the things he could say about Biden........ must be polling lower with evangelicals. 🤷‍♀️
Biden will be more competent is distributing the virus.
BLACK PEOPLE, DO NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN LET THESE MOTHERFUCKERS KNOW WE SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT WE WANT. #BlackLivesMatter #BlackVotesMatter

They are hoping for a gaffe. But Biden will crush Trump.
y’all supporting biden is the epitome of “he has black friends”
Either this is correct about Biden or someone told another lie. Hmmm. I wonder which. #VoteHimOut
So is Biden feeble or is he a threat to god?  Is both even possible or is someone making shit up again?  #VoteHimOut
Last I checked the border was only open to citizens and immediate family members of citizens and permanent residents.  Also Biden being a less-than-perfect Catholic is honestly points in his favo(u)r for me.
Its sad all this country has to offer us politically is Agent Orange and a pedo dementia ridden Biden. Can you imagine what it would look like if Biden wins, god forbid passes away and we are stuck with that insufferable Kamala Harris in charge?
It's hilarious that  says "if you consider voting for  then you ain't black"  and now tells a black news reporter that Biden taking a cognitive ability test is equal to the black news reporter taking a test to see if he is on cocaine.
Right, because Obama/Biden didn’t have a pandemic response plan in place
Time to crush the scum Devil out of Office and into prison. Joe Biden has the Balls and Brain to fix this shit storm .
I completely agree. With what Biden dealt with in his life it’s about as low as you can go.
This is what is so exciting about a Biden Caninet! You know many of these amazing women will find a home within his team....He’s already told us who he favors with his VP list. And the list is phenomenal!
I don’t think so. Your administration is being laughed at my around me the world. Your the worst president in history because you have left millions of people die on your watch. Obama and Biden are more in tune with the American people than you ever will be.  Resign Trump!!!
As a gun owner, and also a liberal, I would gladly give up my gun for Biden in office immediately. (and for the record I know trump is full of shit. Just making the point)

Trump said he's considering giving his acceptance speech on the grounds of the White House, a move that could violate ethics law. Biden scrapped plans to accept the Democratic nomination in Milwaukee, where the party has spent more than a year planning.
Patently false,  but there is a candidate and a Party that support AND practice lethal injection to end human life (hint: not Biden)

Joe Biden is Catholic, no?  This is getting out of control.
Hopefully Biden will pardon him.
What exactly would be Biden's motivation to debate Trump?
If you told me that Donald Trump did not know who Joe Biden was, based on that description, I would believe it.
Oh MY GOD !!!! Now he must be impeached !!! Horrible slip of the tongue......liberals are idiots. Biden just insulted the entire black community today but you point out a misspeak of a word
Not that it matters, but I believe Biden practices and goes to church and Trump doesn’t. 🤷‍♂️
So the DNC took Joe Biden off ice like the Winter Soldier for this shit? Lolz they are so fucked
I’m aware Trump says dumb things. I’m saying it’s more concerning that Biden seems to have early stages of dementia.  I’ve never seen a presidential candidate just lose his train of thought when speaking so often. Mind boggling that he is the best option for them.
I don't think there's a real cause to worry that Kanye would siphon significant votes from Biden, but I do think there's a very real reason to fear Kanye could get in the debates.
1. I speak for myself...nobody else!  2. I have many concerns about Joe Biden &amp; the Democratic Party.  3. What has Trump done correctly in 2020 in his handling of COVID (besides close the boarders) or social injustice. He can’t even utter the words Blacks Lives Matter.
They definitely both say some dumb shit, but sometimes Biden just loses track of the conversation and his own words.  Actually more often than not it seems he has no idea what the hell he is saying. It is very fucking disturbing that he has a presidential candidate.
I do genuinely believe that Joe Biden will garner quite a few votes from conservative-leaning “real” Americans. But the grift of the “Never Trumpers” in the media was so damn transparent and so damn pathetic. If you can’t vote for JOE FUCKING BIDEN, then you can’t vote for any D.
yeah though i don't think a lot of evangelicals know who Niebuhr is but they DO know that Biden prays and talked about God on Colbert? And yeah "hurt God" is a wild time!
Biden and the Democrats well this country out the first chance they get all to line their own pockets. All while claiming to be for the people. Only thing keep this county in state of decay only so that can control the narrative.! ThAts socialism at its core value!!!
I would be more worried about Biden’s mental health more than anything.  He is not all there.  Screws are loose, and it feels like he is getting dementia.  I can’t believe he is a candidate in his current state. It’s really unbelievable…
President Trumps visit to Ohio continues tonight with a campaign fundraiser at the Shoreby Club in Bratenahl — tickers start at $5,600, photos with the president start at $35,000.   Joe Biden will be in Ohio &amp; Cleveland this week too — but he’s doing all his events virtually.
So Biden is more powerful than God?
I'm in Cleveland and I've seen more Biden signs than I expected - which is to say 10 or 20. I've seen some next to blm signs, which is... odd
Ha ha, Trump and Biden both word fart. Now let's talk policy. #diversity #thighland

I don’t think god is afraid of Biden, but I think Trump might be.
Shout Back #FBR
I'm about material benefits and I've always thought the electability idea that has propelled Biden was a con and a lie. This is an anti-Trump election &amp; I need to have someone who will do something with that wave than the next to nothing the Dems will undoubtedly do

Pretty impressive that a weak old man like Joe Biden can "hurt God"
Remember that time when Biden suggested the election should be delayed or that injecting bleach could cure corona? Yeah, me neither.
I will vote for Biden if his running mate is a houseplant.
There is plenty to critique about Biden but like... hitting a practicing Catholic who talks about his faith ALL THE TIME for not liking God seems very stupid?
I’m a swing voter from the great state of Ohio. Can’t wait to vote Biden.
You missed the deranged man saying Biden was going to “hurt the Bible, and hurt God”. Rob, it is embarrassing for Ohio that you support this man. Be glad you weren’t there.
If the choice was really that simple, then Biden would win in a landslide...  But what's smart for you is not what's smart for your neighbor's.  So that's not entirely accurate.....

This is coming from someone that used a "Photo op" in front of a boarded up Washington Church, holding a Bible. The pastor never gave permission nor blessing, for a spot cleared using tear gas so the Episcopal church could be used as a prop. Any yet, "Biden will hurt the bible".
there isn’t one that’s the problem. but putting biden in office is only gonna make things worse. you aren’t voting anyway the electoral college is so it really doesn’t matter
Biden is a puppet. Becoming more and more clear who is controlling his strings.
Biden is simultaneously too weak to stand up to the squad and too authoritative with the crime bill. These polar opposite beliefs are held by the same people.
Gettysburg Address  We Choose to Go to the Moon Reagan at Brandenburg Gate We Shall Overcome Biden Hurt God
i was reading about joe biden all morning so im really ready to argue w/ anybody
But you’d rather vote for Biden who just today said that all black people are the same and that Latinos are way more diverse than African Americans. By the liberal standards you vote for Biden you are now a racist and pedo.
I didn't know God was linked to guns.  huh?  I KNOW RUSDIA IS LINKED TO NRA, though.   I also KNOW Mr. Biden doesn't hate God.  Mr. Biden doesn't HATE anyone.  He's an authentic Christian. 🙏❤🇺🇸
I wait everyday to hear who Joe Biden announces as his VP running mate! #Election2020 #TakeBackTheHouse
It’s ironic that Trump mocks Biden when Trump is a terrible public speaker.  Master of malapropism.
Experts held 'war games' on the Trump vs. Biden election. Their finding? Brace for a mess
I think Biden will do a little better in Ohio than he thinks🤣
To put this to rest, and knowing Biden is a gun owner, can we have a duel on the White House lawn between you 2, instead of a debate.
So Biden wants to hurt 'god' now? What else is he capable of? 🤣
Hurt the bible?  Did Vice President Biden,  a practicing Roman Catholic burn the bible?
Every time Biden opens his mouth. This is the Democrats 🤣🤣😂
Biden is going to win Ohio by 5-8%
Biden is Catholic.  His puppeteers are not.
Talking about being desperate😔  This guy didn't even hold the bible right 3 months ago.He's losing by 15 points in the national polls.  Instead talking about containing this virus 6 months in with still no plan. He talking about Biden.160K unnecessary deaths &amp; unemployment high
The reason for dismissing Biden at that time was that he really did not look good. That part was fair.
Joe Biden: 'Unlike the African American Community ... the Latino Community Is an Incredibly Diverse Community'
vote for biden, hurt god
Frankly no guns and and no police sounds like a great reason to vote for Biden.
Um, Biden is a lifelong Catholic who has talked movingly about the role his faith played in experiencing grief. Trump is a thrice divorced philanderer credibly accused of sexually assaulting over 20 women.  Not sure playing the God thing is gonna work out, Donny.
The people who are charged with "handling" Trump live in terror of his every utterance.   At worst, Biden might occasionally reveal that has the antiquated views of someone who is 77 years old. We already know that, and we're OK with it.
That Biden has a reputation as a gaffe machine and also is on the brink of waltzing into the White House with meager opposition might just be instructive.   Biden is Teflon because most of his worldview is just comfortably within the bounds of discourse in its broadest sense.
We knew this already.  More #trumpLIES
I think he's confusing the rapture with Joe Biden. And personally I'd like to see Trump raptured.
Sharika, do you think Biden would consider you a "notable exception"? 🤣
Larry, would Joe Biden consider you a "notable exception"?
At 1:45 p.m., President Trump addressed a crowd of supporters at Burke Lakefront Airport, describing rival candidate Joe Biden as a politician of inaction.
And Trump signs in Parma and Biden signs along the southern edge of Brecksville and North Royalton.
No wonder Joe Biden stays locked away in his basement.  Yesterday, Sleepy Joe went on LIVE TV and in a matter of MINUTES: he accused his interviewer of being a ‘junkie’ and tried (but failed) to explain why he is refusing to take a cognitive test. YIKES!!!!  #VoteRed!!
Mine comes and goes. I do the exact sam thing Biden does: brain goes faster than the mouth, stumble a few times, stop, regroup and start a thought fresh. It’s actually nice seeing him succeed while I’m afraid to talk to strangers bc of it.
Same in Ohio. “Biden will let the bogeyman into your home,” etc. 👻 🤮
More Kamala Harris talking. Less Joe Biden talking.
While I believe Biden to be quite fit, I find it hard to believe that he can “hurt God.” Nor do I believe he has the super-powers necessary to “hurt energy.” Also, I may be wrong, but I believe Biden lacks the time-traveling, editorial powers of one who could “hurt the Bible.”
Biden has eight years to do that if that was his plan. It still isn’t his plan.
Trump talking about Biden or my dad talking about me🤔
Hell yeah deicide Biden is my Biden
VP Biden is a practicing Catholic. That means he actually goes to church. He doesn’t go stand in front of one for a photo op. What church do you attend on Sundays? The golf course doesn’t count.
This is the same lie you told about Obama for 8 years. Total guns taken away: 0.   Remember, Biden understands and respects the Constitition. Trump does not.
This guy is out of control with his own mind and mouth. He is incapable of holding the office of President.  Shame on Jill Biden for selling out her own husband. What was she promised to kerp him going. He's being used and will NOT be an acting president.  So WHO really will be?
Trump is in Cleveland. Just spoke at Burke Lakefront Airport. Once again, he said Biden is against religion and the Bible. How ridiculous! The speech was filled with lies, misinformation and vague bragging.
Might be Biden’s convoy tho, because it’s very similar to what flew over on Tuesday...
You know it’s a weird election year when you see Biden signs in Rocky River and Trump signs in Fairview Park. #Ohio
I am hopeful that some of the decisions lead to real changes, but I also worry, because Biden. We need someone so very strong because he needs to be held accountable for his words and his actions toward the Black community. He is not my choice, but he will be my vote.
Joe Biden - "Geez, cmon man"

Biden plays himself every time he speaks lol what an idiot
Biden is not your guy.
Who wants to bet at this point that Joe Biden's VP pick is just some inspiring metaphorical bs like "American exceptionalism?"
Biden says Harris is 'very much in contention' to be his running mate  We all know how she got the pick! she got asked when she was on her knees. hahahahahahahahaha
did it again: upon landing at Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport he brags he is ahead in the  polls in OH when the latest polls show Biden leading him 46 to 42 points😂
😂😂😂 you really think hes going to lose to creepy Joe Biden come on man.......these debates are going to be hilarious
Also also true: future foreign policy will be a mess because Biden will look the other way on Trump-era crimes
Sadly Biden is right, and pointing that out won't change the fact its lack of diversity is a solid Dem votes. Stop pandering and go back to building a strong country which will help all AMERICANS
On September 24th we will hold a virtual fundraiser to discuss the upcoming election with:  Cuyahoga County Democratic Chairwoman Shontel Brown Parma Mayor Timothy J. DeGeeter Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley Biden Representative ( To be Determined)
It’d be really nice if it was more than 15 second clip so one could see the context of what was said. Regardless, I guarantee that Biden is no where near as racist as Trump.  He served with the only black President. He won’t tweet people saying white power or anything near that.
If Biden's VP pick determines how a person votes, that means they are placing more importance on a VP than on the racist, bigoted, corrupt, juvenile behavior of the current president. It makes no sense.
Biden isn't even president yet so idk why you even brought his name up and Obama had to clean up Bush's messes in Iraq and Afghanistan
US 20 in Clyde is chock full of Trump and Biden supporters ahead of the President’s visit to Whirlpool this afternoon.  #WEWS
If Joe Biden wasn’t the other candidate, probably.
“Clearly knows”?? How do you know how well Biden knows the bible?
I don’t think Trump or Biden are lasting all 4 years
He’s just mad Biden said he won’t pardon Trump.
But Biden only considering a black, female running mate isn’t considered racist?
I don't want Joe Biden at all, not him and not his cognitive test!!! #VoteRed!!!
Yes, but that plan is wearing thin. Biden for Basement!
And Joe Biden just lost the presidency...going after the 2nd amendment while also needing to secure rural American electoral votes. Yes we need more gun safety, but a national ban on assault rifles will only cause resistance and greater black market sales.
With Clinton last week and now Biden this week this entrenched establishment Black political class has to GO.

Michael,   They think black people will vote for him and not Joe Biden.  Signed,  Everyone
You can’t really have an “unauthorized” gathering in your home. I don’t think this makes sense. AND , people who don’t want to vote for Trump or Biden are going to see things like this and say hmmm maybe the far right are correct about some things. It’s just too far reaching
A Trump ad doctored photos of Biden to make him seem alone
Trump said Biden's going to take away religion. Why not guns? Pretty soon 45 will say Biden drinks baby blood.
Joe Biden also needs to understand the bottom name on the ticket shouldn’t be more important than the top name.

You are 100% right. He needs to get it together. As much as I'm not a fan of Biden, the alternative is much worse.
So are people really seriously considering voting for Kanye ?? Because I’m thinking it’s a joke but people saying trump is using Kanye to take votes from Biden that means they expect ppl to really vote for Kanye.... please don’t it’s not even funny.

Instagram Draws Criticism For Suggesting Negative Hashtags About Biden While Hiding Any Related To Trump
No. I’m already not voting for Trump. Don’t know that I’m convinced to vote for Biden either though.   Just two awful choices.

Joe Biden ENDS Joe Biden's CAREER! Theres NO WAY This Man Can Win After ...  via
How often do you and DADA go to Church funny how Joe Biden can read a scripture without using the Bible CAN YOU DONNY BOYS
Joe Biden needs to understand Joe Biden is running for President. Not Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Kamala Harris, Oprah Winfrey, John Lewis (RIP), etc...   Joe Biden is running for President! That is all!
I love Biden Vette content.
Valid; not doing that. The VP *is* the automatic next nominee so you have to think about that before the fact. If Biden opts out in 2024 for age reasons, there'll be 75-year-old Liz insisting she's not too old for the job. Putting the party in that position is irresponsible.
So you mean she's not Biden's choice for VP? OK, fellas, back to digging into Karen Bass's trash again!
Can’t even make fun of biden anymore cause he just comes out every few days like “listen here you think I don’t know where I am? I got perfect direction. Learned it from my pap. Damn could that man drive. Even with a few pops under his belt. Well anyway thanks for coming”
Sooo let’s review.  Biden says racist things in a Presidential race but is excused. Trump is not racist but the sheep insist he is while ignoring their candidate.. sum it up? #BidenIsARacist and creepy.

Nixon, Mondale, first Bush, Gore, Biden. If Cheney hadn't consciously emphasized his non-running bona fides that VP would have been the nominee in 2008 for sure.
Joe Biden launches new national ad aimed at Black Americans
Ur a dumbass voting for Trump or Biden.
Biden took no position on the China restrictions when they were implemented. Also, 40,000 people still travelled from China to the U.S. in the months after. He did say travel bans wouldn’t stop it and and we needed a plan to combat it —he was right, again.
In 1971 Joe Biden said “I don’t want my kids growing up in a racial jungle”, he didn’t want to deregulate schools, you think he changed because the times are new?
Waiting on  to comment on his boy Joe Biden insulting African Americans yesterday
Joe Biden Targets Black Voters To Kick Off His Massive $280 Million Ad Campaign
Lol he said unlike black community Latino community is diverse  So is black community not diverse?  Racist Biden needs to stop viewing black people as monolithic. Black people are unique, different, and NOT monolithic.   Just like when he said you ain’t black, this is dispicable.
To vote him in.  Absolutely.  Biden on record saying more racist shit today.  Compiling evidence he doesn’t care about black lives.  Meanwhile Trump lowering price of medications, creating American jobs and writing policy too help blacks and Muslims from communist China.
On my bike ride commute this am thru the neighborhood that will host Trump’s fundraiser tonight I counted 18 Biden signs and only one for the orange idiot. This is definitely the route the motorcade will take so that’s cool.
This is silly. Biden should abide and debate. It’s nothing new for candidates to lie during debates. If Biden is prepared, he can call out and discount the lies.
For what it's worth I think it's not going to work. There's a decent chance that the activist &amp; authentically problem-solving ethos of the regular Dem establishment/Biden/etc. will REALLY hit the spot early next year, and confound GOP efforts to demonize the project.
the interesting part to me is the extent to which important Republicans are already giving up on a Trump victory in November / shifting to talking points that constrain President Biden.
Two things are true.   The necessary levels of stimulus spending are genuinely concerning.   And Republicans will opportunistically leverage fake deficit hawkery to constrain/destroy a Biden administration.
Biden warned about the pandemic back in October. Then again in January and released his plan to deal with it in March. Trump still has no plan besides blaming everyone else for his failed response.
So this  is  what Chris Dodd actually said because Biden didn’t denied it. I mean it says a lot about Chris Dodd a former Senator huh? Old white man mentality, so so insulting.

Pleasantly surprised by all of the Biden support in and around the neighborhood that is hosting Trump’s private fundraiser tonight.  Thinking about setting up an Orange Crush stand on Lakeshore Boulevard to fundraise…
This just goes to show how Joe Biden is just say whatever to whoever he’s with I think deep down Giovannis prejudiced but they cover it up for me it’s just the way I see it over watching him over the years
In case you haven't noticed, except for Wall Street, and the NASDAQ in particular, the economy is already destroyed.  Trump needs to pay the bill NOW, because somebody's paying it.  Passing this to Biden if Joe wins gets Trump 2024

None of that shit will happen, joe biden is anti pot in 2020, dont worry there will be no defunding the police. For christsake, he wrote the racist ass crime bill that's still unfairly putting blacks in jail.
Your missing the damn point. Joe is promising stuff he will never do. I'm not voting for either one. Joe is trying to win over the actual left, that hates him. Him and obama did dick. Trump can be awful, and biden can too.
Reading Democratic responses is hilarious.  How, if you note that Biden is unintelligible, you are stutter shaming.  Time for me to be accused of moron shaming...
Bernie's fukin nailing it  Too bad he sabotaged Hillary, and may be sabotaging Biden
It's just a diversion 😔 He's wants peoples to forget about how bad of a job he's doing thru this pandemic. Over 160k dead bodies, Unemployment numbers are just horrible. NYC prosecutor are able to see his taxes &amp; get his bank informations. He's losing in the polls against Biden
I hate CNN and fox, they both can suck. Both can be corporate owned BS, just coming from a different angle. You probably think biden is a socialist,  meanwhile he is basically a republican by past standards. Yet you hate him, and fear hin

Hey Jain Harris poll has Biden national lead down to three points. Losing in battle ground states. Tell Joe stay in basement please.
That's why I think the race is more close than the polls show. Most show Biden hovering around 49-50%, if those voters break Trump, he would only be down 3% which would be enough for a EC win.
Are you talking about Biden?
I cannot stress enough: Joe Biden needs to be better. To be honest, I don’t know him. I know Obama, I know Trump. I don’t know Biden at all.

If I was Joe Biden I wouldn't even debate you I would just keep watching you go on TV and make a complete ass out of yourself every time you go in front of the camera
Exactly, I do not think they are swing voters. If after almost 4 years of Trump, Covid, if they are not for Biden already, they are "Shy Trump" voters.
155k dead actually with a death rate that keeps decreasing.... well short of hundreds of thousands.... and let me guess Biden would hAve prevented ALL deaths.... smh
I do not agree. I'm in Ohio. He did not do well here like in the coasts. If you dont take ohio, you lost. Ps.... Trump signs are vanishing. Conversation has turned to worry. They dont like biden, but seem very dissatisfied with trump and Mike Dewine. Even Portman as a rep.
His income depends on this narrative. That’s why after Bernie lost he started his smear campaign against Biden. Biden wins big and it hurts his bottom line. He’s a total hack.
My mom and I were asked to sign a petition to get his name on the ballot the other day. He was real quiet about his reasoning.  My mom finally got it out of him, that he was a volunteer for trump’s campaign, and they want Kanye on the ballot so it will take votes away from Biden

Do you ask this question every time we expand the Pentagon budget or stuff some new F-35's into completely unrelated bills? Or how about the fact that Biden wants to give more money to police departments? Do you ask that question then?
That's today. Tomorrow it'll be 39, the day after 40 and so on and so forth. How many days until election? Before then 139% of Voters will think Biden has dementia. And with mail in and ballot harvesting, ironically, that's the same % of democrat Voters who will cast ballots.
I more so vote for republicans traditionally, so I like that Biden is a moderate. Why I fought so hard against Bernie. I wouldn’t vote for trump with a gun to my head so it’s not a difficult choice.
Not so much using the footage but the mere fact of the briefings and people hearing about them is a net win for Biden.
Because WE know WE are voting for Mr. Biden and getting rid of you.... actually WE'RE getting rid of the GOP!

They were at least smart enough to do what the GOP failed to do with Trump. They saw that if they moved forward without consolidating support they would end up giving the nomination to Sanders. That's why all the rest of the candidates dropped out and endorsed Biden.
Just saw a tweet criticizing Biden for an ad where he drives a classic car that's worth a fortune. I mean, I think that shit is tacky, but are we supposed to pretend he's poor? He was the vice president for eight fucking years, dude

So we have 2 candidates in cognitive decline but it was an issue that Bernie was slightly older than Biden?
Would it matter this time?  Short of Biden taking his pants off during a debate and yelling about porridge, I just don’t see Trump winning.  The polls will tighten a bit as things get closer but Biden’s lead in most is, what, 2x the margin of error?

Serious questions Ken - did you watch the entire Axios interview? Not trying to get into a fight, but I legit want to know if you saw it and still think your dude has his dome on straight. I’m not a Biden guy by any means, but Trump is a moron. I’ll take my answer off the air.

Independents are infuriating. And I know a few. All men.  Rice is fierce and competent.  Harris projects softer which may be more fitting when Biden is a "yeller" Biden's best tactic in debate will be to shout down the word salad king. Let's just hope his shouting is on point

The story says Biden has $294 million while Trump has “more than $300 million.” So, how much more than $300M does Trump’s campaign have? The way this is written, Trump camp may actually have a much larger $ advantage than $6M.

So, Barr is getting ready to drop bogus info on Biden as an October surprise and oh, by the way, declaring that nothing can be done to hurt Trump without Barr's ok but sure, the Dems gotta play nice.  Nope
I like this. Said the same thing, Biden should say no. I feel hes doing well &amp; could do damage.  BUT agreeing based on taxes, that'd be worth it. Course it'll be a cold day in hell before he willingly releases anything. This man is not a President.  He's a failed US experiment.
It's pretty clear based on those two interviews that they just need to be ready to tell him he's wring and not allow misinformation to go unchecked. Oh amd be ready for his paper graphs. If I was Biden I'd push for no change.  He's doing well and only stands to hurt himself.

Biden isn’t even in executive power... easy to be on outside and criticize.   Biden playing the “I’d do such a better job” even though if he was president we wouldn’t have banned travel from China and Europe so early which saved SOOO many lives.   But hey he’d do a better job 👍🏼
So we just ignore that Biden was against a travel ban and isn’t even in executive power to make decisions to judge what he’d do?? Easy to play the “I’d do such a better job” when on the outside of one of the most unprecedented virus crisis in America.
Exactly, I'm a former Trump supporter, I've regretted it snce Feb this yr. I can tell you, I've learned a lot and, there is literally not one thing Joe Biden could say or do that would change my mind back to voting for Trump. Even if he shot someone on 5th avenue
With any luck, Biden's unmistakable energy and do-goodism will contribute to the true end of this fucked-up, nativist, obstructionist stalemate we've been trapped in since ~2006. It's not a given and we have to fight for that future to happen, but it's there for the taking. 8/8
It's impossible to imagine what will be needed in January, but it's easy to imagine the kinds of things Biden/Dems will do. Close the schools until further notice. Increase assistance to the needy. Implement serious and effective lockdown measures where necessary, etc. 4/8
For one thing, after months of having to wait before addressing the Covid problem properly, Democrats will have pent-up energy and aggressiveness in tackling problems. Biden will have a laundry list of ways to solve serious problems, and he will implement them quickly. 3/8
If Biden is able to assume power successfully in January 2021 and if the GOP insanity can be countered for a time — big ifs — don't underestimate the striking contrasts in Democratic effectiveness and approach to what came before as cementing/accentuating this process.  2/8
I know he did and I’m closely tied into a few of the art communities in Cleveland/Akron/Columbus. The majority of dipshits supporters are 40+ with the older ones starting to die off. Young people want change and equality. Not tweets and war mongering. I don’t like Biden is &lt; evil

Educated on what? What’s going on? Anything involving a conspiracy theory &amp; I’m done w/ this. I’ll agree Biden is no good. He IS the lesser. Both Clinton’s are shit bags hope they go down soon. Both Bush’s are shit bags. What does that have to do with the price of rice in China?
I actually think deleting it, is the wrong thing to do. Why not just put a badge next to it that says ‘False’ or not proven to be accurate? #facebook #twitter #news #time #trump #biden
Ugh, yup. This is what I mean. Lazy, not on topic, cartoons you stole from someone else.... sullying my topical joke. Literally 90% of your tweets are about Biden being a pedo when he’s never been accused by anyone of pedophilia, so you look like a raging trumper.
But that’s what i mean.... your joke doesn’t complement mine. Joe Biden is not attacking the old woman in the ad.... the ad is about Biden defunding the police.... which he’s not.... so the old lady doesn’t need to be scared....
Then you’re a trumper. I go through all this effort to make a hilarious tweet about that dumb trump ad and I just get a trumper spamming Biden hashtags. It’s just weak.
Wow! I wasn’t going to vote because I assumed it’d be a landslide for Biden. I’m going to go check my registration now that it’s close! Thanks, TheHill!
She definitely isnt. In america right on center controls it all. And alot of ppl like to pretend they support things they really dont. We cant evem name 10 things Biden and Trump disagree on really

In the sense that sometimes it'll be tough to respond to Trump's inanities and lies, yes, I suppose Biden might have some issues. Beyond that, he could school Donnie on any subject. Thing is, with Trump almost fully having abandoned fact, it all depends on how Biden counters him
I still can't get over POTUS thinking that Biden would somehow "hurt the bible," when Trump has nearly irreparably hurt the witness of evangelical Christians on a staggering level.

What Biden is asking for Christians. M-----m law/America. MI already seen these disgusting acts. Gov. is for the M-----s. Does nothing for/Christian faith. This is your Dem party/is out to destroy decent American people. Stupid heads in the sand. Sheep!
Considering Biden said that 35 years ago.... been in Washington still ever since
I just want to get the message out about Biden and how doomed we would ALL be sittingbin prison for jaywalking wonder wtf we didn't keep Trump.
Well, I too used to believe he was racist too. I just can't anymore. Most of it is lies. Biden however makes his own bed. Trump has already done WAY more for the black community than his predecessor ever did. That's facts.
Don't forget to watch those videos on Biden. He wants us all to unite...in prison. In thst first video he mentioned death penalty for jaywalking and SIXTY different crimes. Imagine that. Sixty crimes you can be put to death for.
I would advise highly against that. Especially after watching an ACTUAL racist here in Biden
Did you also hear him talk about how he wants people to come in? Just not criminals or sex traffickers. If they get "busted" twice? Yikes. Also. Biden is terrible and I would never in my life vote for him. Did you look up the first step act?
The first step act was prison reform. It did away with Biden's mandatory minimums that would have some people serving longer for drugs than some might for murder or rape... huge win
You are one to talk, acting like Biden is just fine
Yes, they all knew about Jeffrey but did nothing.  Money talks! You can count on if it weren't for Donald Trump getting elected for President this criminal activity would have continued through Clinton and most certain through Biden.

You realize you're doing the same thing then right? You're defending Biden right now soooo
Stop defending and deflecting from Biden
But Biden...
You do realize that the other choice is someone who proves that he needs to be treated medically time and time again? I wouldn't be opposed to a new president, but not fucking Joe Biden.
And biden did the crime bill, where he asked for 60 "crimes" to be eligible for the death penalty. Right up to jaywalking. If you seriously think he's anywhere near a good person, you have issues. Also let's not forget that he sexually assaulted Reade as well while in office
Be careful what you wish fot Bernie. Biden is WAY worse. Just wait.I don’t need the news to tell me Trump is a piece of shit, I already knew that. I’ll be voting for Biden. Thanks for your concern though.
Great comparison!!! 🇺🇸💙 Now we must give Trump the boot.  Why? Because he is weak and he is dragging the country we love down into a sewage tank.  Vote for Biden!  He has a PLAN to put us back on track!  Trump is for the rich or his friends i.e. Jerry Epstein.

Biden will not seize anyone's guns. There are plenty of Democrats who are gun owners. To believe this post would be ludicrous because not only is it unlikely, it is the nonsense spouted by hack conspiracy theorists.
I mean, I was already voting for the guy. I now realize Nietzsche was viewing the future in which Biden smote God when he proclaimed "God is dead". #Sold
Then we need to vote him out in November and be prepared to remove him from the WH.  Even if you are for Trump politically if you love this country we must vote him out.  I’d rather have four years of Biden and work on fixing our country. 😊🇺🇸💙
He is always confused.  He needs to get a handle on this virus or there is no way he will get a 2nd term.  He lacks confidence.  Go Biden!
It is genius by his campaign managers because any interview with Biden reveals his mental decline. Trump is fine. At least he has the balls to do an interview.
You can’t seriously be arguing this 😂. Biden is too afraid to even do an interview with someone who will ask tougher questions... they are trying to get the guy out of the debates because they are afraid everyone will see how bad his mental state actually is.
**once again i’m not for either candidate, j stating my mind**  i j want y’all to witness the STARK difference that will occur in the event that biden gets elected in how the media portrays him. it will be WILDLY different than we are witnessing w trump. i guarantee it.

I'm voting for Biden to get another step closer to a Pressley/Ocasio-Cortez ticket...among the obvious. But this is today's reason.
Nobody on ET thought Joe Biden was gonna win in November by 15 pts.  Plus Trump being behind by over 6 points isn't really something to be happy about
Seriously that’s not our problem at all. He’s working with trump to take votes away from Biden. He’s not a serious candidate.
With Joe Biden as President!
I don’t think joe Biden knows what joe Biden’s is thinking. I know he thinks we should vote for trump though... rather peculiar.
2 Great options. Win-win for Joe Biden tbh
Hunter Biden will take the job if he’s paid enough
Whatever joe Biden says u can believe unlike DT only tells lies 😡😡😡
Shut the hell up CNN we already know who you support #OWNEDBYDEMS whatever happened to journalistic duties like reporting unbiased to inform instead of recruit. I think it's time for Joe Biden's Alzheimer medicine again better go change his diaper too, while your at it.......
That seems more like a fluff piece; I mean it's possible to go green before 2050, biden really only plans on a deadline and initial investment, so the buck would just get passed down from there

BIG NEWS Joe Biden is a lying dog faced pony soldier!   Ok. Not really news to anyone but...
We kicked off this week's episode with a discussion of who Joe Biden might pick as his VP.  Episode 19:  #PodernFamily
Democrats are doing everything they can to put American citizens on their knees.  They have no idea of the resolve of American Patriots. The best they have to offer for a presidential candidate is Crazy Joe Biden is proof they are a dying party.
Regarding a cognitive decline test: “No, I haven't taken a test. Why the hell would I take a test?” ~Joe Biden Oh look! Joe is a lying dog dog-faced pony soldier...😁👇
Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus, party officials said Wednesday, signaling a move to a convention that essentially has become entirely virtual.
Biden is a Lying dog faced pony soldier...😎Uh I didn't say I wasn't voting. Trump and Biden are not the only option 🤦‍♀️
Hello this is scary via
You do know he left out the part of the story that says Iran and China are working on behalf of Biden, right?  You are letting propaganda influence you.  Be better.
Reagan wasn’t as bad when he ended his 2nd term as Biden is now. He was starting to forget occasionally but not near as bad as Biden is.
US officials: Russia denigrating Joe Biden ahead of election...but China doesn't want Donald Trump re-elected “We are primarily concerned about the ongoing and potential activity by China, Russia and Iran.”
Biden got Zucked.
Someone needs to create a joe Biden funhouse
That's what I thought in 2016. People hate Hillary and so many people buy the conspiracies around her, and anyone who buys the conspiracies around her is well acquainted with Rice as a super villain. And there are potential Biden voters who believe Benghazi conspiracies
Rice gives Republicans what they've desperately been clawing for a chance to link Biden to all their Clinton and Benghazi related conspiracies
Why are these the only two people that get a chance? Biden or Trump?  Can you actually answer that for me please?
Whoever he picks is going to suck so for me it doesn't matter. I expect the lies, I expect the corruption, I expect joe biden to continue to expect he can run on "donnie bad" and win. As it stands the man has 0 policy platform. Hey, we can watch him floor it in his vette tho. 🙃
US intelligence warns of election interference, says Russia is trying to denigrate Biden, China wants Trump to lose
And when Biden wins they’ll give him absolutely 0 credit
Sorry but I'm not. I don't like trump or biden and refuse to vote for either. This whole election is a shit show
US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election
The Axios interview showed us all exactly what Trump will look like in any debate with Biden. Trump isn't going to get any smarter or learn anything. It's a sure thing that Trump will find some excuse to avoid the debates.
Right:   I’m not sure the candidate you are looking for is in the bunch re: opioids (but I might be wrong). Warren’s name is there, of course, but a) I think Biden will go with someone a good deal younger than him and b) I’d put money on a woman of color.
at this point Joe Biden should go ahead and announce his VP.  You need to build some momentum as these “mistakes” are adding up.
Biden all he is doing is capitulating just like the Zionism did POTUS is the EXCVHEQUER
I’ll never say which choice(s) for VP would disappoint me but this full-frontal assault on China makes me envision President Biden handing foreign policy over to his brilliant national security expert VP Rice while he focuses on the rest of the mess.
Had all these awesome RESISTERS!!
She's not out of a job because a customer complained.  She resigned because she refused to wear non-political mask. If people started wearing Trump or Biden masks it would be the same issue.
So you support Biden?  You value a man who is creepy around children?
Russia preferring Trump and Iran preferring Biden are no surprise. But I'm pretty sure I read a few months ago that China wanted Trump because they saw the long term benefits to them outweighing the short term economic pain.
Not sure what a VP candidate thinks about health care is too important. At the very least, I think she is probably mostly in alignment with Biden, though likely slightly to the Left.
I never said that was ok either 🤦‍♀️💁‍♀️ we're talking about biden at the moment. One clown at a time
Biden can barely finish a complete sentence
Are they Democrats?  I should have added “who would otherwise vote for Biden?”
My Statement on Faith. Like so many people, my faith has been… | by Joe Biden | Aug, 2020 | Medium
2/2 I'm not judging ENTIRE swaths of people because of the way they vote. The point of the original tweet is how sad it is that these two jacka$$es are the BEST this country can do for its next "leader". If you think Biden is some great candidate then you're settling BIG time.
I know its probably hard for you to fathom that not ALL Trump "supporters" are racist bigots. Just like not all democrats or Biden supporters will defend his antics with young girls on camera or the pedophilia of Hollywood democrats. I'm a middle of the road Democrat. (Cont.)
I just pray I can leave the country before Election Day so I can be excused from voting for Biden.
To go from Pete's campaign to Biden's is really disheartening.......actually depressing.  I've really lost enthusiasm.  I'm focusing on getting people out to vote and supporting Win the Era
They don't need to paint him as racist. Biden does a good job of that on his own. 😐
😂 bro. I can say this honestly and truly man. I’m never in my life gonna vote for Biden and with the Democrats backing him even with this, probably not democrat either. We should rap on a live about it
One key reason why Sen. Kamala Harris should be Biden’s veep pick is that she was treated horribly during the primary, with any number of double standards hurting her prospects.
I hope so because I'm tired of Biden being called a communist, and Ana Navarro will shut that sh*t down.
Tell Biden to get out of my e-mails.
I certainly don't blame you, but I think Biden's willingness to shift his positions to unify the Democratic Party should at least provide some reason for optimism here.

Also, as Heer notes in the piece, it seems highly doubtful that the Biden White House is going to go out of its way to shield former Trump administration members from congressional scrutiny. I see absolutely no political upside to doing that.
I wish people would look into shit before speaking on it. Read the article. Watch the UNEDITED clip. I’m not in FULL support of Biden but they definitely cut that clip to make it sound WAY worse than what he was saying.
I need one!  You can nestle next to my “UA for Biden” sign.
I don't disagree, but I don't think it's wrong for Biden to note that the legal pursuit of former administration members isn't without some level of peril. Is it shitty that this is the case? Yeah, it's really shitty. But it's also reality.
I wish Joe Biden would shut up
Joe doesn't write his tweets, this is literally a campaign person trying to fix biden's fuck ups. Let him out of the basement for a few hours and then gotta have people working overtime to fix the dumb shit he said.   M4A now, A decent candidate now. pls.
Joe Biden personally intervened to keep the word “occupation” out of the official Democratic platform, according to a new report.
AFTER 74 YEARS OF RACIST-trump’s “EVIL, NASTY, INDECENT, IMMORAL, RAUNCHY, SLEAZY, RACIST, MORBID AND INHUMANE RHETORIC AND BEHAVIOR TOWARDS “ALL BLACK AMERICANS”; I WILL “NEVER” VOTE FOR deviltrump! I AM “RIDIN WITH BIDEN” 💯%! I AM VOTING STRAIGHT BLUE TICKET! 👍🏽💙👍🏽💙👍🏽💙👍🏽
That could end up being the case, but that doesn't change the fact that Biden shouldn't let himself be forced into a litmus test on prosecuting Trump administration crimes.
As horrible as Biden is, he would still be a better president than Trump.
YAY! He'll take votes from Biden, not trump!
Biden is correct to be circumspect on this. As a future prez (fingers crossed), he shouldn't be saying anything that could be perceived as a promise of legal retribution to a political foe. That's banana republic shit.  He said the right answer, which is "It's up to the next AG."
Biden has more racist remarks and intentions throughout his life than Trump. Again, while in office how has Trump been racist? Seems to be pretty bad at being racist just sayin 🤷‍♂️
I'm not getting on live tv asking reporters if they smoke crack. Doesn't take a degree to see that something is wrong. You people are hateful. I will never vote for Biden, didn't mean I can't feel bad for what's happening
I caught you in a lie and this is your comeback?  Weak.  Biden is senile.  Everyone knows that.  Biden is a racist, we've all know that for decades.

Trump Beats Biden in Crucial Campaign Metric  via
The smartest thing Biden can do is shut up and let Trump self destruct by talking.  The smartest thing Trump can do is shut up and let Biden self destruct by talking.   Race to the bottom with these two.
Anyone notice that in the background of Biden's basement, the books have been changing from history and law books to kids books like "Winnie the Pooh" and "Curious George"....  🤣
Trump has never said that.  He would love a debate every week with racist senile Joe Biden.  Why do liberals feel they have to lie to win?  Says a lot about your party doesn't it?
In a single word,  Biden is in all ways decent
I think I’m following everyone but let me check. 😁💙
Questions I would ask Joe Biden:  (1) What is 7 plus 5? (2) Who's buried in Grant's tomb? (3) Where is the U.S. capital? (4) When was the War of 1812? (5) How exactly is the Latino community more "diverse" than the African American community?
Biden gon help BLM protestors?
A Pew Research Center study this year found that the majority (68%) of Black Democrats described themselves as either moderate or conservative. But in 2016, for example, 89% of all Black voters supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
I would prefer a president who didn't believe in gods at all, none of them, not a single one.  Having said that, I'd vote for Biden over Trump even if he believed in all the gods.
Joe Biden could create a bill that would help bring mass incarceration on black americans and y’all would still vote for him.
Got em all
Who cares?  I surely don't.  If you want to vote for the Cheeto Chimp, please do. Biden is spoiled for VP choice, on the side of the angels, and on the right side of history.
Pedophiles support Biden and other Dems. See how comments like that just cause a round &amp; round, NEVER ENDING pointless argument? Not ALL supporters of either side are exactly alike. Each side has despicable, hateful people in it. Do not focus on them like the media wants you to.
Well according to Joe Biden  black people  must think a certain way . Or “you ain’t black”
President Donald Trump, who most Black voters see as exacerbating the nation's racial tensions, according to polls, seized on Biden’s remarks, declaring them “very insulting.”
👍  I'm headed to Sykesville. I am betting I'm going to see more Biden signs because it's so close to Baltimore?
Me too Matt!  If we had a normal Republican as President, I’m not even sure how excited I would be to vote for Biden. He certainly wasn’t my choice (Warren for me), but I am certain that he will do better than Trump. He will at least listen to experts &amp; not just appoint yes men.
You could vote Kanye 😂.  KIDDING!  I can't help myself it's Friday.   Seriously, any vote other than Biden aids trumps re-election.  This November has to be Joe, for the greater good of our country.  Hell if, Tim had a legit shot I'd vote for him.

Wearing a cloth mask, President Trump toured the Whirlpool washing machine factory in Clyde and announced a tariff on Canadian aluminum.
Joe Biden isn’t a Christian, hate to ruin your day with that info.
If it’s Biden’s degenerative neurological disorder that you are mentioning, then I’ll say this. There is a clear difference between a substitute teacher messing up roll call (Yosemite and so many other blunders) and a man who repeatedly showcases signs of Alzheimer’s and dementia
I hand delivered my application for my absentee ballot today to the Franklin County Board of Elections, in Columbus Ohio. Once I receive my ballot and vote for Joe Biden and down ballot blue, I will drop it off at a ballot drop box.
Those who vote for Kanye were never going to vote for Biden anyway......stop giving this story a platform. That’s want they want - just stop FFS!
Joe Biden is getting all my family's black vote. You will NOT GET one!
and his campaign trying to call  a racist or senile or anything else opens him up to be called exactly the same thing… there’s far more evidence historically point to #Trump. After all, he’s done so much more winning than #Biden over the years.
In a world where actual policies and track record matter, it would be  hands down. This is solely about who would bring the most to the ticket and the most to shore up where Biden is weak. Attacks from the right? She'll crush them. She always does.
when are y’all gone realize that joe biden is trying to use your emotions for votes and he’s not going to do shit for you.
Are you going to address Biden’s continued gaffes re: race, or are you gonna bury your head and pretend they didn’t happen because, well, he’s not Trump. 🧐
Cogent thread if you’re thinking of sitting this election out. This is where I am, and why I’ll be voting—much to my dismay—for Biden.   The US is already a failed state by most indicators, but it will be totally failed and likely a dictatorship with four more years of Trump.
And I can't stand joe biden. He has no policy platform and this is just a effort for him to elevate his policy profile in the midst of nra turmoil.
No real Catholic would ever support abortion as Biden does.
“You’re a lying Dog faced pony soldier” - Joe Biden
I am in Columbus Ohio. Flags, signs, bumper stickers for Trump everywhere. Seen one yard sign for Biden. The people you saw were in the Cleveland area, notoriously liberal. We are witnessing the under sea earthquake. The tidal wave arrives Nov. 3rd.period. Remember I said that!🇺🇸
"There will not be another foot of wall constructed in my administration." Joe Biden said he would stop construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall if he's elected into office.  #10TV
Stupid on so many levels? That would be you.  is speaking for a lot of black conservatives. Just because you're a liberal doesnt make what you just said right. Biden is an idiot and his dementia is getting worse. He and Pelosi are suffering greatly from it.
How many of these same people were worried Biden wasn't doing enough work with Hispanics? Bass is the worst pick for that. I really don't think who he picks matters overall, but if you were concerned about Hispanics she can't be the best choice
Cardi B just moved up to my #1 spot of who Biden should pick as VP.
Biden was nominated because he wasn’t as scary as Hilary Clinton in places like the “ Rust belt”. That’s it. That’s why the party stepped in and stopped Sanders. It’s working.
The “comeback” was due to the fact that a bunch of people at the Democratic National Committee were terrified at what would happen to their place at the power table if Bernie Sanders was the nominee.    They would rather lose with Biden than win with Bernie.
The fact y’all think Biden still ain’t “Crime Bill Joe,” is hilarious. Trump say whatever he want and y’all lose your mind, but Biden be asking for votes and throwing racist shade and it’s “BIDEN 2020!” Lmao, I can’t wait to move to Tor— nvm
I wanna know who these "notable exceptions" were Biden was talking bout LMAO. I gotta think Obama is one of them. Y'all let him get away with anything but if bad orange man said that shit it would be a problem. Had a BLK Prez for 8 yrs but a BLK female VP is gonna bring change HA
Not necessarily. If a person was going to vote for Trump and instead voted for Kanye, Biden's net would go from -1 to +/-0 and Trump's would go from +1 to +/-0.
I didn’t know Biden was a Catholic. The more you know.
Thigh-land and Yo-Semite, hamburders, and MANY others… For the “World’s smartest #President,” I’ve never seen another President mis-pronounce as many words as #Trump.  And Trump tries to hammer #Biden as being old and demented. He should pull that out of his repertoire.
This is not the future Joe Biden wants
I rather Biden just said "sorry (AGAIN) for saying something racially ignorant" than just being like, I didn't mean what I actually said. I miss having a candidate that I was actually excited to vote for.
He didnt even set foot inside the church. The fool also used doctored photos of Biden in ads, where the original pics were of Biden PRAYING.
I’m not sure how he plans on doing this since the Supreme Court has ruled. But, this is who Biden and the left are: they want to go after nuns. (Biden, the “Catholic.”)
tRump's golfing today. I'd love to see Biden's VP nom drop just as he's teeing off. "Four!"
Biden made a gaffe about the black community yesterday. For your entire life, you've treated the black community like a gaffe.
No matter how much he walks it back, Joe Biden really said that all black people think and vote alike.   I repeat, it is astonishing that these are our two choices.
Is it my imagination or does Biden's "apology" tweet sound like it was written by someone else...maybe his wife.  He hasn't spoken this eloquently in this century!!!

I’ve seen intoxicated students on a Saturday night possess better mental and cognitive abilities than Joe Biden.
“You saw and heard me say it, but it wasn’t what I meant and I actually believe this other thing” is evergreen for Team Biden. No wonder he is being stashed in the basement.
because carting around rosary beads means you’re a saint? Terrible excuse 2 say someone has strong faith. Biden can’t complete sentences and we cannot have that running the country. Deal with Trump 4 more years because you put Biden in you won’t even have a church
No matter how many Biden IN HIS OWN WORDS shows how hateful and incompetent he is, they will always refer to some CNN or MSNBC fairy tale and proclaim Orange man bad! These clowns shouldn't be allowed own scissors let alone vote!
I don't get it, is this a campaign ad? I mean, I can understand wanting to get out of working with Trump, but rest assured I'm already voting for Biden.  You can stop convincing me.
“Hahaha, Dury! 2016!”  It’s not 2016. The dynamics are completely different. Trump is no longer the outsider; he’s the incumbent; Biden is not Hillary.   The election is really a referendum on the incumbent. Biden is just ... there.
I don’t understand why some conservatives laugh off the possibility that Biden *might* win; he’s leading in all the national polls and most key states. That doesn’t mean he *will* win, but he’s leading right now.
Who are you talking too?  Biden?  I agree!
The Obama administration and Joe Biden by extension have a very troubled legacy on religious liberty. I know many Catholics and Evangelicals who voted for Trump precisely because of this. Also, Biden is also publicly at odds with Catholic teaching on abortion and marriage.
at this point I'm justifying my Biden vote with an argument I saw for Trump in 2016, which is "eh, fuck it, might as well try a new guy and see what happens"
I couldn't stand 8 hours to vote for a person I believe in, let alone joe fucking biden
2 straight days of criticizing everything Biden and Fauci says while the President lets the Country burn alive in a Pandemic, gtfoh.
Considering that you’re currently in office and already have started infringing on rights and only caring about the parts of the constitution that benefit you, my 5 yr old niece would make a better president. So bring on Biden #notworsethanyou
He doesn’t want a fourth debate with Biden. He doesn’t want ONE debate. He wants the illusion that he’s enthusiastic about it. That way, when he backs out and blames Biden, #Cult45 will believe him. He’s entirely predictable at this point.
This article is "Trump is a horrible monster, and the VP is not a real job, but Biden is old and might die so I will only vote for him if he picks the perfect VP." It's a big ball of stupid.
Have you seen any Biden signs?  I'm in "toss up" Ohio and haven't seen a single Biden sign in urban Columbus.  Trump is going to win here by more than 10, the polls are lies.  Vote for Howie if you want.
Hahahaha  Fact: Kyle is "moderating" himself more than "moderates" to vote for Joe Biden...
So agreeing with you on this!  He has said so much worse things in 60 second span than Biden. This was in The Columbus Dispatch yesterday
The rantings of a lunatic ...”he’s going to hurt the Bible”?? WTF does that mean? And Biden is “against God”?? Wouldn’t Trump’s multiple marriages, his well publicized adulterous affairs, etc. be against God?
Hysterical!!!
should be legit concerned about how confused  is.  I am not sure how anyone can vote for this guy, even if Trump is a complete tool.  #Election2020 #Biden #Trump
This months #JobsReport beat expectations by almost 400k and next months will be even more drastic with the $600 unemployment benefit ending. No one is obsessed with Biden he is just 1 of 2 people running for president and he has dementia clear as day.
Absurd you can have a choice . The Fact that Trump and Biden have trouble speaking coherent sentence ! Making the VP pick very important 🤦🏼‍♂️
I'm all for inclusivity, for equality, for fairness. But I swear, hearing Biden must "earn" the Latino vote right now on  Burns me up. I'm gay. I'm an atheist. I'm two groups. I do not insist that  "earn my vote" on either score. I just want him to win.

Breaking: According to Trump, If Biden is elected, he will literally rip the cold beer out of your hands as you are drinking it.
Biden been saying wild shit DON'T act like you missed it. He can't keep his true feelings in. See he says what TF he wants cause he knows BLKs will still vote for him disgusting how the DemoCRIPS take your vote for granted. I imagine Ye will take the 18-30 BLK vote.
I hear you but are we really gonna pin this ALL on mental health when it comes to him? Do you not think he knows how his campaign is tryna sabotage Biden's and not his racist dragon energy friend?

Something Trump doesn't understand. Biden understands Matthew 7:1-2 as he is a devout Catholic. Trump doesn't go to church and sure doesn't act as though he has any Christian values. I understand that and do try to live up to it.
They saved joe biden for sure. After South Carolina he was the nominee.
Its over bro he's getting another term especially with all these ignorant ass comments in here an what Tariq is pushing. If not biden who then cause it sounds like they're fine with the way things are
This is all well and good unless someone finds out that Biden is actually the guy who wrote the "modest company/modest goals/drain the world's oceans so we can find and kill God" tweet.
Please have Black people respond to Biden’s comments regarding Black people  I think we are better able to discuss the range of feelings in our communities. Geesh.
i think about this a lot. i have to vote biden but only to get betsy devos out of office. the dems know they're the only option so they're making sure they get away with whatever they can
If it wasn't such a tragedy it would be laughable that trump is saying that Biden hurts GOD.  Fake trump University, stealing from charity, paying hush money, caging defenseless children, blackmailing countries, and Biden is hurting GOD.

Is there something like a DIS-INFECT-ENT? Too bad leftists brains are only looking for their next weak ass story for their dumb'ed down audience. You only tell on yourselves.  Biden is as Archie Bunker as they come, but does it bother the party of the KKK? NO

You apologize when you have done something wrong. Biden has been apologizing FOR YEARS about his racial behaviors, policies and tactics against black people . Trump has been falsely accused and has nothing racially to apologize for in recent years.Biden is continuously doing this
Has been giving minorities and blacks powerful positions and jobs his whole life and FACTUALLY has improved their lifestyles as a businessman and president.Whereas Biden has been working against them his whole political career.And the media/Govern has public thinking the opposite
The thing is, this isn’t news. He’s a known racist. Anyone that’s ever known him will tell you that. He’s only liked because it was necessary for Obama to choose a white VP and it happened to be Biden. He’s been working against blacks for decades in politics.
It’s unfortunate that trump isn’t likely to continue his plans at weakening chinas sway and power here because under Biden, just like with Obama, he will hand China what they want and turn a blind eye to what is occurring, at America’s expense. The downfall of America will begin.
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?

They're not talking points, just facts.  So your argument is since nobody complained about Biden in the Obama WH then everything he did to actually hurt black people is now ok?  Trump reversed his racist bills and freed 1,000's of blacks from prison.  Aren't actions important?
Notice how I didn't insult you?  Notice how I treated you with respect and shared facts so you could make up your own mind?  Did you see his interview with Charlegmane Tha God?  He brought up those racist bills he wrote, and Biden said "if you don't vote for me you ain't black"
Fuck it ... I'm all in #Trump2020 on Twitter... Biden is a complete joke.  #BlackLivesMatter
Thank you! Still growing. I can't wait to see Trump spank Biden. I can't wait to see the debate either. lol
Joe Biden simply sucks fucking ball sacks ... You had 17 motherfuckers and y'all picked this clown ...?
Biden: "unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things."
biden is ready to be the savior of the gamers
I agree, Biden is the best of all Democrats to run for president and lead our once great nation.
I thought for a second.....lightning was going To strike Trump dead.    BBC News - US election 2020: Trump says opponent Biden will 'hurt God'
Biden hasn’t taken the test because he is NOT in need of one.
we get it 😩 trump and Biden are bad.. so what do we do about it??
I want Biden to blow
Joe Biden Says All Black People Think Alike  via
I would vote Biden even if YOU were the pick.
Biden is .5 behind in Texas. There’s a lot of folks moving to Texas who aren’t 1960s era republican chief. Houston Dallas Austin all major dem cities. Texas could easily go blue
Much like Biden, I am also against god and guns.
Since this was the La Supreme Court I assume this was a state crime and Biden, as POTUS, could not pardon.  But I'm sure Louisiana's governor John Bel Edwards can.
It just shows that Obama cared more about having someone who would overlook his corruption than someone who wasn't racist.  Tells you about his priorities.  Biden has always been known as a racist.  Gave the eulogy for KKK Robert Byrd, his good friend and mentor.
Tim Kaine. Difference is Biden isn’t physically/mentally capable of running the show so his VP choice is extremely important.
And this point, it could be a Martian and I will applaud and still vote for Biden.
Trying to keep track of all the things Joe Biden is supposed to get rid of: police, windows, suburbs, guns, Bibles, and now, apparently, God. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Wait a minute. I’m confused. Is Joe Biden weak and feeble enough to sit in his basement all day or great and powerful enough to hurt God? I’m sensing a mixed message. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
I don’t know, Why is joe Biden so racist?
No, he's not being exploited. He's all in. His "campaign" is designed to hurt Biden. The latest version of Jill Stein.   Forbes: Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden.   via
I am black, a woman and very proud. I can't wait to vote for Biden.
I’m not religious anymore, but at least you can say Biden believes in something beyond himself. Trump could never write or say something this compelling on faith.
Damn, I didn’t want to vote for either of these clowns, but if Biden is really against God and guns he may have my vote.
Looks like  is a racist too, or he's just plain stupid - too.
Yep...Joe the racist Biden... facts are facts...
Wonnder what these amateurs are thinking. 🙄  "Black Milwaukee officials in a Thursday news conference denounced West's attempts to get on the ballot in the state as a GOP ploy that assumed he would pull Black support from former Vice President Joe Biden."
But you may still contribute to his re-election if you don’t like Biden’s VP pick. 🤷‍♀️
More dirty dealings by a corrupt man. Then #InspectorGeneral investigating incident suddenly “resigns”? Guess we’ll know the truth after #Biden’s sworn in.   #Trump had US ambassador press UK for golf deal: former diplomat  via
Biden is against Blacks, that we know.
Btw...VP Biden never said defund the police. All the Republican Party has to offer are distortions and flat out lies.
Why Joe Biden may be exactly what the country needs right now  via
I’m Joe Biden’s husband, Joe Biden
Who cares? No one listens to Biden and thinks, “Gee, I had better change my vote to Trump.”  He doesn’t need to be as perfect as Jesus to beat Trump. #Biden
According to Trump, while it took God 7 days to create the world, it'll take Biden just one election to destroy God.
C'mon man.  We all know you're a lying 💩-bag, a racist, and a criminal.  Biden Corruption:
C'mon man.  We all know you're a lying 💩-bag, a racist, and a criminal.  Biden Corruption:
Yea but voting for Biden is better? Seriously?!
1) Dreaming of f*cking demons results in bad things for the demon-f*cker dreamer. 2) Biden winning the election would be a bad thing for God. 3) God was apparently dreaming about f*cking demons for this bad result to have taken place.
I had to listen to MSM go on and on today, about what a "devout Catholic"  is. Biden is pro abortion, kinda kills that whole Catholic storyline.
That’s cool. You relate better to Biden then.  Great minds think alike I guess
Seriously trump suggested injecting disinfectant into the human body. Wanted to nuke a hurricane, thinks windmills cause cancer, oh and thought Fredrick Douglas was still alive. Biden might mis quote things , trump is a moron.
Oh, hey,  I see your store catering to my Democratic thirst! And, yes, I bought it! #Biden #JoeBiden
You want to vote for Biden. The alternative is a money laundering lying tax cheating Russian asset letting a virus kill 160k Americans while Russians pay bounties to terrorists to kill US soldiers, but only if Joe picks the right VP? Get tested. You may be brain dead. #Biden2020
Because Biden hasn't had a stroke.
Wait, so if Trump's favorite doctor says unconsciously thinking about demon semen results in bad things and Trump claims Biden winning the election will hurt God, is The Donald suggesting God has been dreaming about f*cking demons? Blasphemy!
Yes I watched it.  Are you kidding me.  Yes if you were a 3rd grader u might do that.  We all know that is. Not what he meant.  Do I need to post the 100. Videos where Biden’s  not even sure what planet he is on?
The goal is for you to try and persuade Biden’s voters to vote for you so Trump wins. Fuck any Trump supporter including Ye
This is not about liberal or conservative anymore. This is about democratic republic vs fascist dictatorship. If you believe in our constitution, you must support Biden. #Biden2020
Biden is dying right in front of America and the left does not care.  This man is sick and needs to rest and retire and be with his kids but you all don’t care.  Trump must fall even if it kills Biden!
Trump: "If Biden wins the election, he'll hurt God. He won't hurt Satan, though. I never get hurt." #Snark
Ooo sweetie.  How is your boy Biden doing?  Is he still Alive Kinda like kim jong un is he alive not alive.  Maybe you all are trying to grow a smarter clone!  That is a good plan try that!!
Apparently Trump thinks the Trinity consists of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Biden.
Who is Biden gonna invade first?
Biden is both a racist and mentally incapable of doing any job, at this point.
Another sign he should probably take one of those Joe Biden tests, too....
Wait a minute ... did he say what I think he said?  Is this why the Left doesn't want Biden talking except when reading off of a teleprompter?
I am a human for Biden.
I had no idea joe biden did not believe in God.  AND yet he is also out to hurt God. Compelling thoughts for me to ponder.
Since Trump seems to believe Biden is more powerful than God and will crush him/her/it if he wins the election, I have to wonder if God will borrow a page out of Trump's pop-up book and excuse himself from a bout with Mighty Joe because of bone-spurs.
Biden will not survive his term if he wins.  His Health is sadly so bad and yet no one cares about him it just all about beating Trump.  This man needs to retire and be with his grandkids while he can.
Oo Chrissy I thought u blocked me.  Still see you are up to no good.  Buckle up for 4 more years.   You better hope I am right.  Biden might forget where the keys are for the nukes!
You are not well. Biden is ill. It is sad. You must watch CNN and MSNBC. Change your channel. The only way Biden could win, is by cheating. If it happens America will be destroy by the socialist. I do not want any child to live in a socialist country.
Joe Biden's explanation for more goofy remarks...how many more of these will he need by Nov 3?
The fact OH, TX, GA, and IA are the super competitive states we’re spending our time talking about rather than MI, PA, WI, FL, NC, and AZ tells you all you need to know about the state of the presidential race. FYI Biden doesn’t need the first set of states I listed to win.
that Joe Biden will “hurt the Bible and hurt God” if he’s elected. You sit here, say you’re a Christian, and throw kids in cages, gas Americans for practicing their first amendment right, defend the confederate flag, sexually assault women, and intimidate a news reporter who is
Sweetie you are still playing your weak ass game I see.  He might lose if he does you will just blame him for Biden failing of course.
What are your thoughts on God? Trump: "Oh, so great, loving, and powerful. He's the best. I believe, bigly." What are your thoughts on Biden? Trump: "He's so weak, he can't even tie his own shoes." If Biden wins... Trump: "Oh, no question about it - he'll destroy God." #Snark
Tbh, I thought the same with the Bernie debate. I'm not defending him or his cognitive decline, which is apparent, but whatever the hell they give trump so that he can do 45 minute pressers, they are giving it to Biden. Biden bareley gaffed in the debate, he just ruthlessly lied.
And Biden mispronounces every other word he says... so, what’s your point. Also, listen to your local news, they mispronounce words all the time.
Only if you believe yourself more powerful and not know the meaning of humble! That makes God Sad, so it hurts him/her I imagine. Biden is humble.
Election fraud maybe?
'A completely deranged Trump claims Joe Biden will "hurt God" if elected president '  see more
That's an interesting take. I saw this video and had almost the exact opposite reaction. It felt like the Biden team trying to find another attack position for pushing Green policy
No you won’t! Biden is leading you in Ohio and the people of Ohio are sick of your lies!!
I'm voting for my initial presidential picks: Harris, Warren, Castro &amp; Bernie. Voting for Biden will give me those same progressive agendas if we stick together. One goal: Defeat Orange Agent!👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽
Sounds a lot like Biden's "You're not really Black" comment.
Just get your happy ass out and vote and all of your friends.  I don’t want any crying when you lose.  If we lose so be it.  Guess we will see.  God help us all if u all win.  Biden will not survive his term if he does wins. His health is scary.
EVERYONE KNEW THIS unless you're chance the rapper, Elon musk, 2chainz, Dez Bryant, and Derelle Revis
Biden has been talking like this his entire career. I don’t get why anyone is shocked by this.
Hey, Sisters,  With all the talented women Biden has vetted over the past months it seems to me he could very easily stand up an entirely female cabinet, national security department, and foreign diplomatic corps... That would erase a century of misogyny &amp; discrimination😏🤔
whoa whoa whoa I didn't hear Biden was gonna throw down with God, he 100% has my vote now.  BIDEN 2020 | LET'S HURT GOD
So you voted for Clinton?  You follow every Trump and every Fox News personality and u have the nerve to call me a racist. 😂🤣.  Let me guess- you think Biden is declining but Trump is the perfect image of health and mental acuity?  You have misread everything I have said to you
Biden, a church-going, practicing Catholic, is nothing compared to Trump, whose favorite bible verse is “Two Corinthians”
At every official WH event media opposes Trump, backs Biden.  The media doesn’t have to be impartial, but the leader of the Republican Party does.  😂😂😂  You’re such a dope.
Do you even believe your own bullshit, Dan? You defend trump’s idiocy and attack Biden? Does Fox pay you to puke up this bile?
Trump: "It'll hurt God if Biden wins."   I like gods who don't get hurt by 77-year-old men winning elections.
I think Trump is making it easy for him. Biden really doesn’t have to open his mouth. Just sit back and let this assjack keep talking.
The claims that he does are just another lie from the pathological liar that is your President. Biden’s response, while not well worded, was NOT racism at all. If you have 2 functioning brain cells, surely you see that.
If the democrats are so worried then why are they failing so spectacularly at messaging. Dems were screaming all during the primary that blk ppl supported biden over Bernie but and now all of a sudden he has no support? Starting to think we got the weaker candidate
You still aren’t following. If I ask you- “have you stopped beating your wife”. How would you respond?    If you say no- you are saying that you still beat your wife. If you say yes, you are acknowledging that you did beat your wife. Biden doesn’t need the test.
You must mean the god that trump knows about that can be, and I quote, "hurt" by Joe Biden. Ok, you stick with spanky's god who lies, cheats and steals and I'll stick with the Divine Master of the Universe.
"I don’t need the ordinary white guys to clear out completely, but I’d sure like to see them start stepping aside for the photographs." ~   Very well written.  #Sexism #VPPick #WomenRoar #BlackWomenLead  1/3
Joe Biden is asking for children to learn about Islam in schools.
Con men always build trust that they are experts and saviors.  Criminals always point at others doing their crimes. Millions of jobs and Biden hates God.  Do your own research.
Josh- you get that asking Biden the cognitive question is similar to me asking you if you have stopped beating your wife...right? No matter how you answer it, it isn’t good. If you don’t get that, can I ask what is the highest grade you were able to complete?
The Five was a joke today!  Biden bashes African Americans and they leave you two off the show???  They don’t address it?! Ha!  Fox is becoming garbage now!
It's pretty rich for Trump to say Biden is against the Bible and if he were to win, it'd hurt God, considering it seems as though Trump's daily goal is to break each and every one of the Ten Commandments.
I guess you are exactly what I should expect from someone following every Trump and every Fox News personality. I’m sure Fox is really making hay with low iQ folks on this.
I never understood this.  Who's the Biden voter who's going to look at Kanye West and go "yeah, that's a better choice?"

Trump campaign uses altered photos of Biden in new ad
A lot of people in the replies are attacking Biden by citing his responsibility, matureness and shit Trump did. If you say you'll never vote for "Creepy Joe," you sure as Hell can't vote for the guy who watched 12 year-old girls strip at his beauty pageant.
What do you expect us to do? If it’s between trump and Biden, I’m all in. I’d vote for anyone over trump. He can’t be allowed another term.
Perino wants Biden in the Whitehouse, her Sandra and the rest of the loons on Fox are showing their true colors!
How is Biden a loser candidate?
Trump: "It'll hurt God if Biden wins."  I was just waiting for him to add a bit more, so it read, "It'll hurt God if Biden wins and then the Two Corinthians will be no more. Sad. So very sad. Bigly."
Speaking of taking Black voters for granted, please continue enabling the mentally ill rapper thinking we'll vote for him instead of Biden.  And you're still a deadbeat sperm donor.  Trump asked about Kanye presidential bid: 'I like him. I like his wife'
Trump: "It'll hurt God if Biden wins."  How much do you want to bet Trump can't even spell "God?"
It’s amazing to me how you, Sandra.....etc, have started showing your true colors.  Obviously as a person in the Bush administration you are now obviously backing Biden.  Pitiful.
Just stop. Not voting for Biden is a vote for trump. Way to stay real.
Trump: "It'll hurt God if Biden wins."  Hmm, okay, I can play this game. GOPers tend to blame all crises on abortion and LGBT issues. So you say it'll hurt God if Biden wins? Well, perhaps it hurt God so much you won, he/she/it punished us with COVID.
More? Less? What does that matter. If we don’t turn away from fascist corporatism, even assuming Biden will be some benevolent leader (no sign of that in his legislative history), staying on a fascistic path is a very bad thing.
You mean the guy who thinks so little of god that he can be hurt by Joe Biden. Got it! Carry on then dude. My God is the Master of the Universe and more powerful than all of humanity combined. Do you with spanky's god.
i fully go 2017-2018 ML twitter mode when volunteers from the joe biden campaign text me
This is the hill the campaign is gonna die, huh? You know these tests are given when cognitive problems are suspected, right? So Trump....has cognitive issues, Not Biden. But go ahead, make a stand!
🙄 Biden is only 3 years older than Dotard.
all you have to do is be humble and caring. Biden is killing himself just by speaking. All you need to do, is not say anything they can use against you.  Your campaign officer should be telling you this shit. It can’t be hard for you to act humble
They need to prove it's Hunter Biden's fault.
So basically you are voting for trump because you might not like Biden’s VP choice. Geez you are messed up.
Trump claims Biden opposes God during Ohio visit
Well, Biden is too scared to speak to a camera in Milwaukee...
Legit if Biden can hurt god then man, that’s a flex

Biden's afraid to Debate Trump 🇺🇸 ! Because he knows that if Trump gets into it with him like Hillary, it's over !

I’m not saying I’m a Biden fan. But I think he specified that the money  would be for social workers, and physcologists. But he probably does hate black people
The couch in the Oval Office will have as much say on policy as Biden does
No, we apply a very broad brush to what we call Latinos from Mexicans, Central and Southern Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans etc....  Look we know you are desperate to find something, anything on Biden but you will have to go elsewhere
So wait you’re a racist if you don’t vote for... this guy?  We need a working-class movement united across lines of race, religion, sexuality, etc to the racism, greed, &amp; corruption that capitalism has bred in our country.
Yeah, I can see why  won't let  debate   Biden is a blithering idiot.
If he screws Biden I don’t think he will even work in the entertainment industry.Hes going to get black balled.And so will his wife and family.
Watching right now and the story on the president and Joe Biden comments today was some grade A both-sides bullshit. I can count on  to air any Trump lie without context, push back or correction.
TRUMP is as sharp as a tact. Now Biden does not know who he is running against. He does not know what state he is in. It is not funny it is very sad. Stress is not good for his condition. He can only win by cheating. VOTE TRUMP so save America.
This just makes me like Joe Biden more. I hope he becomes president now so we get more folksy nonsense that is still somehow relatable
BIDEN sounds like a Norwegian death metal band. All you need is the brutal font.  could get on that and put it on a t-shirt. Aviators, black mask... hella yes.
You do know Joe Biden isn't Leticia James, right?
“Biden is not all there” Ironic.
NRA is not 2nd amendment like some of you claim? Biden is not planning to take away your guns. Many Democrats do support 2nd amendment, it’s just that there should be a meaningful gun control.
If there is any reason you won't vote for Biden then you are a Trump supporter.  At least have the courage and moral fortitude to own that.

That makes no sense, just like Biden when he opens his mouth. Go Trump. Do not let those evil democrats cheat.
The biggest threat to Joe Biden and the Democratic Party is Joe Biden and the Democratic Party

Seriously, is this so you can appear fair when disgusting joe Biden’s obvious impairment?  See what I did there?
Biden is a sick man. He can only win by cheating. The democrats have cheating in their evil DNA. Trump has been the best president in years. He loves his country. Democrats hate America. VOTE TRUMP to save America from the evil socialist.
Well president Trump is a good president but our next president will be president Biden because your better🤓
Against god, hurt god...so he’s trying to inflame the Christians by casting Biden as the devil?
Joe Biden pretty much said all black people think the same way........ but but but you’re going to vote for him because Trump is a RaCiSt 😂😂😂 #Trump2020LandslideVictory
The only way Biden could win is by cheating. That is why Dems are pushing so hard for mail-in ballots.  Biden could not run a PTA meeting, let alone our country. The socialist will control him. VOTE RED to save America.
Waste of time for VP Biden to even mess with a crime family. He doesn't need to.
Y’all haven’t seen the protests, the science marches, the womens marches &amp; Pride that go on throughout the year? I know they’re not “Biden Rallies” but they’re Dem-adjacent, as are the “Hate Has No Home Here” signs in front of tons of suburban homes.
I disagree.  I think Trump views each debate as an obvious opportunity for Biden to lose his shit in front of millions of voters.  This is going to be must-watch TV and Trump is the Jedi Master to Biden's baby Padawan brain.
Yeah... I’m gonna vote for Biden, but he absolutely getting a Deandre Jordan vs. Brandon Knight dunked on in Ohio
Elect Joe Biden, immediately invoke 25th amendment. Best case scenario. Hopefully he picks a good VP.
Really small thin crowd again.  Trump supporters are shrinking.  Ex republicans are growing by the day.  Biden will make America a whole lot better in soooooooo many ways!!
We love you here Mr President!!!  Nobody comes out for that racist fool Biden that’s for certain!
Trying to attack Biden's cognitive ability by the Trump campaign is one of their many mistakes leading into this election. It only spotlights Trump's struggles. Bad judgement by him and his advisors. What a mess. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #VoteTrumpOut2020
True, proven in 2016. But if the polls that don’t mean shit had Kanye taking votes away from Biden it would be a negative narrative towards Ye, which is what the media is always trying to do because it gets clicks
There's tht but u also have Biden &amp; the DNC saying &amp; doing things tht seem 2 only serve the purpose of destroying any progress theyve made with "outreach" to progressives. Yes his environ policy is better now but then he says increase police fund, vote down a rule 2 ban lobbyist
Somebody black says Biden is a racist and they don’t support him and y’all are quick maths with the “Trump supporter?”   I got people who will openly admit the guy they’re voting for is racist and y’all still in attack mode.
Wow, Joe Biden has the power to “hurt God”.  💪

I have a problem with the fact you have so much to say about Biden and not a single negative thing to say about trump
Dam, so Biden think there is no diversity among black folk? Well, politically he’s correct.
Aiiight man. Ima let you have it. I feel like there’s nothing Biden can do or say that will make it more clear than what he’s done and said so of that won’t convince you i won’t try
Dewine is a chicken chit and can’t deal with Trump. Now think about Biden (dementia boy) facing Trump

Dude he keeps making such good arguments for voting Biden
😂🤣... me watching Biden... you just can’t make this stuff up!! 😂
Literally !!! If Joe Biden says nothing for the rest of the campaign and let’s Trump continue to dig his grave we will get an unironic “Jeb! 538”
Joe Biden said WHAT????
Dotard Donnie making fun of Biden after he just called Thailand, thigh-land. Whatever he blames on others, is what he's actually doing. Loser.
This tells me you don't want to vote for Biden, because voting for Biden is the only way we get rid of the mob family in the White House. This is total bullshit.
So Biden's platform is "Imagine"?
No-one should come at you bc you are a Republican or if you are voting for Trump.. But id be damed that people will come after liberals for voting for biden.. It's not fair but it is what it is
Trump didn’t create a massive private prison system, Biden did.  Trump is using every tool Joe Biden put in the toolbox.
Yes. A continuation and use of every system people like Biden established over the objections of many of us on the left. Trump didn’t militarize our policing, Biden did, Trump didn’t create ICE Biden did, Trump didn’t create and expand Honeland Security, Biden did.
Joe Biden, if elected, will outlaw the color purple, pet turtles, ping pong, Frosted Flakes, and hates law abiding men who wear slacks to work!👇

This is outrageous. It's time for Ohio Republican politicians to speak out. Where is your voice  What about you  Do you agree that Biden is against God?
What if God and Joe Biden come to blows?

I'd pay to see Trump &amp; Biden duel in a decathlon after the final debate. And yes Wheelchair/Special Olympics will be in play, loser gotta wear a helmet until after the election.
Um. It’s Biden that has made America fascist then. Cause all he want to have have corporations run everything.
Will Joe Biden Be The First Presidential Nominee In 80 Years To Refuse A Debate?    YES, because he is Terrifed of the Great President Trump showing him to be a complete and Ignorant Dumbocrat/Socialist !!!

POTUS reading off teleprompter.  Talking about LG &amp; Samsung relocating to China ("Every heard of it.") Claims Obama/Biden did nothing about it.
No mention of  positive #COVID test yet. He did mention it at the airport in CLE. Now railing against Obama/Biden admin policies on foreign trade. "One globalist debacle after another."
Does Biden have the Infinity Gauntlet? Does that hurt God? Any theologians out there that can answer would be great.
Why the Left Must Reject and Elect Biden at the Same Time
Thanks, Obama!  Literally. Thank Obama for spending billions to make a website to search for shitty insurance that still costs half an arm.   Now Biden wants 775B to make a website so you can search for daycares.   The outcome for this patient is intentional. He's a slave now.
Yes, the all powerful Joe Biden will destroy god. If Joe were that powerful don't you think he would, with one wave of the hand, send trump to oblivion?
You really don't get it do you. Biden gaffes, then Trump gaffes, then MAGA Maggie reminds everyone of Bidens gaffe, you really must not have been paying attention in 2016 or anytime lately.
Ohio....I will PROUDLY be voting FOR Donald J. Trump in 2020 and R all the way..NO DEMS NONE and certainly NOT BITTER BIDEN
Trump has no class as a prez, no class as a campaigner, and has always been an embarrassment to those with class and demeanor.  This Babyman's cheap verbiage about Biden and his religious spirit says much about Babyman.
This is the most comical attempt at an attack against Biden yet.
Biden is not right. You don’t get to tell a black person what they are based on how they vote. You’re not black you don’t know our experience. Don’t do that!
OMG. Biden is a devout Catholic. Trump doesn't even know how to hold a bible.
Wish Biden was a dope as trump makes him out to be
No wonder spanky is scared, he either thinks Joe Biden is stronger than the Devine Master of the Universe or his base follows a weak littlenfrail human that can be injured by Joe Biden. Either way, he's clearly scared and just blurting crap out.
God when he sees joe Biden about to use 10^-4000th of a percent of his power
How about Hunter Biden and Pelosi’s son?
Speaking for myself..and it should have been implied in initial response..I recognize Biden is not the progressive choice..lets fight the progressive fight when Trump is out.  That's my opinion and position.  Thanks for the dialogue
How can Joe Biden be too weak to deal with China yet also strong enough to harm Yahweh? 🤔
We don't need to encourage a thing. If your moral compass is so far messed up to where after all that is said and done by him that you STILL struggle on who to vote for the problem aint Biden's likeability. This isnt even political its good vs evil. POC can't afford 4 more yrs
The man really cannot pick a recoil-free line of attack. From “mental decline,” to “hurt the Bible,” next thing you know  will be attacking Biden for being too bald to be president.
Must be nice to ignore all the racist heinous shit one has done and said and focus on whether or not Biden picks someone you like. THIS is an example of white privilege. Proving the  article correct that said 50% of whites would vote for that racist man.
Biden and Trump are exactly the same person. You’re a complete fucking idiot if you think the bipartisan system works. A libertarian said to me that he just can’t believe the entire system is broken and against minorities.... huh.. lol
I’m curious how trump thinks President Biden will “immediately” abolish all police AND take all your guns away? Who will be collecting the guns? Ordinary citizens without guns? Who’s signing up for that duty? I’ve seen those ppl! I’ll be shot in the driveway for my foreign car...
1950's greaser "Biff Biden" comes into the school and gives God a massive wedgie every time the Republican party gives him trouble.
UPDATE: The Biden campaign has begun placing this TV ad spending for the fall
would be rad as hell if Biden was against God &amp; against guns, tbh
The fact that folks keep beating their thumbs to say "Is it going to better under Biden?" We dayummmm sure no it won't be better under TRUMP.  This isn't "LESSER of two evils" anymore IT'S freaking LIFE or DEATH &amp; if folks dnt see that I wnt continue beating my thumbs PERIODT
Worse...dump thinks Biden can hurt God.. No wonder spanky is scared! He either thinks God is weak, small and human OR Joe Biden can defeat the Devine Master of the Universe. Evangelical trumpers what say you???
As awful as Trump is, this is a serious fuck-up on Biden's part and it would be ridiculous to try and deny that
Now I'm just picturing Biden stabbing God.  If that's true, he might get my vote.
I mean no wonder spanky is scared...he thinks Joe Biden can hurt God...like THE God...the Master of the Universe! Well, that or he has no clue about God or the Bible and he's deceiving and leading evangelicals away from God (since their god is so small he can be injured by Joe)
Breaking news,  if elected,  Joe Biden will hurt God.
. what’s the Biden clip you mentioned in today’s Periscope ?
Reminder that Joe Biden is Catholic.
Biden's record is uber moderate and all his perceived weaknesses mirror Trump's so this is what they campaign against him with lol
Uhhh... Joe Biden seems pretty Catholic.
*screen fades to Biden clip*
if you wrote someone in last time and say you'd do it again if Biden picks Susan Rice over Kamala Harris with literally no reason provided as to why, I think it's more accurate to say you want a reason not to vote for Biden
What are Joe Biden's God Given Rights,  To lick another man's boots the way you do?
I mean isn't this proof to the evangelicals that dump is not Christian and has no knowledge of the Bible or God? If they agree that Biden can "hurt God, hurt the Bible" they've got some reading and praying to do. The Master of the Universe isn't a man that can be hurt. Anyone???
that later data in FL doesn't seem to disagree with them on Biden vote share (where even the lower-quality stuff has him at or right next to 50) so much as it disagrees on margin, though
10TV must've missed Biden's divisive comments on race today.
yeah. i’d love to convince her to vote for a third party but we live in a swing state so that’s a “wasted vote”. Also because of Joe Biden’s blatantly-obvious memory problems
No because if Kanye is running in your state then there's three options beyond Trump and Biden, maybe you guys should put country over party and look at those three options over Tump and Biden
I plan on voting Biden and I find it *hilarious* that Trumpers are jumping all over this given . . . [waves arms wildly at every bonkers thing and lie and crime Trump says and does all the time] . . . but also his answer was not well-artful by at least the normal scale.
Biden / Another Soulless Ginger ‘20
And? What does that have to do with the condition of his bible? Just looking at the binding, you can see that it’s faded and well worn. That indicates it’s regularly used. Biden’s on the other hand, is in pristine condition. Meaning it sits on a shelf. Untouched.
She is getting as bad as Biden. Mindless babbling. Maybe it's contagious and all the Democrats will get it. Wouldn't that be fun to watch?
More from Donald Trump on Joe Biden in Cleveland stop: He's “following the radical left agenda...hurt the Bible, hurt everything. He’s against God...guns.”
“A very good friend of mine just tested positive...we want to wish him the best. He’ll be fine,” Donald Trump says about Gov Mike DeWine during remarks at Cleveland airport  About Joe Biden, Trump says, “He’s not all there”
Literally couldn't tell if you were talking about Trump or Biden until the last line
If COVID-19 infects Trump and Biden, it’s automatically the next President. That’s how this politics thing works, right? 🧐
Biden slams Trump ahead of Ohio visit: 'Ohioans see through your attempts to divide us'  #10TV
BREAKING👉CNN NEWS MEDIA  EXPOSED LAST NIGHT THAT AT LEAST                    ***** 3 *****  PICTURES OF JOE BIDEN   IN A TRUMP AD **ARE**   ***** PHOTO-SHOPPED *****  REMOVING ORIGINAL  👉BACKGROUNDS,  👉 MICROPHONES 👉 EVENT INFO   👉ATTEMPTING TO   MAKE JOE BIDEN LOOK FRAIL.
Also Biden is a joke and if that is the best they can come up with then God help them the dude is literally losing his mind if not lost it already
What Biden and Trump have most in common beyond their White male privilege is how amazing AVERAGE both of them are.  Nothing exceptional about either one of these dudes.
You are 1000% correct but do we cut off our nose to spite our face? OUR current existential threat is TRUMP.  Dogging Biden repeatedly is not how we accomplish UR goal &amp; BURN IT ALL DOWN-is ALWAYS spoken by folks who have privilege they can expend. We all don't have ur privilege
WTH??? She makes as much sense as Biden does. Definitely a drug problem with NY politicians
Biden’s economic plan will destroy American jobs and put a massive $4 trillion tax burden on hardworking Americans. Election Day is less than 3 months away, and we must continue working towards #FourMoreYears of President
If Joe Biden was a poster, he’d kick everyone else’s ass. Just at the top of his game by being demented.
Even a small donation will get you an invitation to an online event with Biden and his running mate, in HER first opportunity to speak to supporters after her selection is announced. Please pitch in !!!   TRUMP RAISED MORE MONEY THAN BIDEN LAST MONTH. 🤬
K and I bet Biden releases his
I predict it will be easier to find toilet paper than popcorn if Hiden Biden comes out for a debate...
Government issued Joe Biden
there’s nothing more dangerous than a man masquerading as a hero who knows you need to choose him in order to remove an insane dictator-like man from power.  and yes this is about Biden.
Here’s Biden’s video where he’s actually being a racist.
WATCH: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand In The Way Of A Trump Prosecution : NPR -
Plus Biden won't win because Kayne West is going to take all the black votes.
18 month investigation- has nothing to do with Biden but of course close minded trumpers will spin it anyway.
Get over yourself.  All you're doing is encouraging less people to vote for Biden which ultimately re-elects trump.  I hope you are prepared to own that.
In Twitmo but I'm out tonight 😁
I’m not trying to connect the corruption to Biden at all, I’m simply saying that some of these guys just go where the money is going.  These donors gave to Democrats also, and we are only two speakers removed from a Democrat majority having racino lobbyists write legislation here
I don't support Biden
BTW, a voter registration application is not a ballot.
I would vote for him before Biden
I don't support Biden.
Are you calling Joe Biden leftist? Lmao
I didn’t even vote for him in 2016, but there is no way I could bring myself to vote for Biden in ‘20.  I listened to this grifter “conservative” crew of Rick Wilson and company and was dumb enough to buy in on Evan McMullin.  It’s a cash grab. Don’t fall for it.
There is nothing anyone could do to damage the Biden campaign more than simply putting him in front of a camera on national TV for a half hour and letting him speak unscripted.
Joe Biden isn't for the people, he's just the safest and only other option we have.
going from Bush/Obama to Trump/Biden would probably do a lot to shake people of the notion that the president is THE person who runs the government instead of a representative of a party coalition and associated bureaucrats
Mostly, would have been accurate to say senior Team Kasich are largely the ones supporting Biden and Borges is the common thread between the two here.
Let’s face it tho.  Biden fans in areas like that won’t be putting out flags for safety reasons.
He lied about the stutter to cover up for the dementia.  You could watch videos of Biden from 10 years ago and see for yourself, but you afraid to see it?  Trump does not make the mistakes Biden makes.  Trump did an hour interview with Chris Wallace, Biden refused to do the same.
The memories of 2016 is coming back to me - HRC lost Ohio because she did not show up. Do not let Biden make the same mistake. Trump is not losing in Ohio. Biden needs to come here many times
Waiting for the eventual tweet from a conservative (probably  claiming that in “Joe Biden’s America” they’re going to take away your guns. Then everyone reminds him that this NRA news is happening today in Trump’s America and that guns are not being taken away.
How is Biden Trump-like, besides both of them being old white men (well, white-orange in Trump's case)?
In six elections, the variance between the polls and the results was HIGHER than the polling advantage that Biden enjoys now. Takeaway: VOTE! Don’t get complacent. Have conversations with your family, your friends. This thing is far from over.
To the people stealing Biden signs in our neighborhood-not only is it childish, it’s counterproductive as I’ll simply buy another one, which puts more $$ in Joe’s coffers. #ByeDon2020
But they would have been proud to have President Clinton or President Biden, right. That’s not a conservative, my dude.
If only 50% vote trump, Biden wins by six points.
It’s incredibly aggressive bribery and anyone attached to Ohio politics who claims to be surprised that this group was busted is lying.  But to say that it is the current party leadership here is wrong—that group was thrown out here in 2017 and has been supporting Biden.
Biden is empty shell, he stands for nothing
Trump is the virus and Biden is the vaccine. So yes it will be available day after Election Day.
“Prove” is doing a lot of work there. Biden’s camp says he wasn’t talking specifically about the travel ban when he said President Trump’s actions on coronavirus were “xenophobic”
"Trump outraises Biden in July, surpasses $1 billion for the cycle" -
This is not a stutter.  This is a guy who's been in politics 50 years who can't remember the first sentence of the declaration of independence.  You must be young because those of us who have seen Biden over the years know he has no stutter.
That's actually the only compelling reason I've heard to vote for Biden.
knowing you think Joe Biden is going to win so easily will make it even better when Trump wins November 3 knowing how mad that will make u
Why would you let them off the hook??  WATCH: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand In The Way Of A Trump Prosecution
Biden never had a stutter.  Go watch any video of him from 10, 20 years ago.  No stutter.  You actually let someone tell you what to think instead of using your own eyes and brain?  Wow.
You literally just described Joe Biden. 😐
That's not a stutter.  It's the brain misfiring.  Biden never had a stutter.
Cool. We're doing car commercials for Corvettes while thousands die and you think that healthcare should only be for your rich donors.  Fuck Joe Biden.
Do you really think Biden who isn't even actively campaigning is going to win?
Here is proof Biden is senile.  Let me know if you'd like more, because there's lots of these embarrassing videos:
Joe Biden could be showing visible signs of a stroke during a debate and I would still vote for him over you. That's how I can confidently vote early. You owe much more than a debate to the American people. You owe us an apology and your resignation at bare minimum.
You leftists are going insane over this test because you know Biden would fail miserably.  The WH doctor told us the results, and the doctor who created it said Trump did very well.  Just watch Biden here and you know he would fail it:
I can think of at least two:   1) Biden is a racist 2) Harris has an insatiable need for attention
Biden is right only because we apply a very broad brush as what comprises Latinos (Mexicans, central and south Americans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans etc...)
Haircut and a cocaine test if you’re gonna get that Biden interview
I am 67 years old.  My husband is a diabetic.   I would wait in line, get Covid and die to vote for Biden.   My kids and grand kids deserve better
These Army Veterans Plan to Vote for Joe Biden. Here’s Why.
#2020Election prediction: No #debates between  and  #Trump will claim that #Biden won't debate, and #Biden will claim #COVID... but neither actually wants to - which is a shame.
This is awesome. Joe Biden is tapping into one of America’s main types of guy: really into cars but doesn’t know what a radiator is. Huge voter block there.

"Biden hits back at reporter asking if he took a cognitive test: ‘Are you a junkie?’" -
Yes you're so articulate. Watching you try to speak is comedy gold and only reinforces sane Americans to vote Biden.
To be fair, Biden was against it before he was for it.
Live look at Biden sliding into second base with the granddaughter
Joe Biden campaign plans $280 million fall ad spending in 15 states, including Ohio
Look, I'm gonna support whoever Biden picks as VP. I hope it's Warren. If it's not, I hope it's someone aware of their own Hubris, and have the capability to demonstrate humility.   I think that's sorely needed to contrast the hubris of the current president.
Reality fact check bruh, Biden makes Biden look bad every day Biden is doing Biden things.  Fact check that jack.
Biden got elected!
Very smart people in 2017: We thought Hillary was going to win because we were listening to our own echo chamber. We need to do better...  Those same people in 2020: Biden is CRUSHING Trump!
I didn't vote for Trump NOR Hillary and won't be voting for Trump NOR Biden. Trump is a reality TV star lives the camera and has fired several people like it's the lost episodes of the Apprentice. You're survived much worse but Trump is gonna be the end of your people? Ok
I struggle to comprehend A lot of what Biden says in his interviews tbh, I’ll just looking out for who he’s going to surround himself with in terms of his cabinet/VP
Biden at his age and with his deteriorating mind shouldn't even be driving let alone "the free leader of the world". They couldn't get Trump outta there with impeachment it damn sure won't be with Crooked Joe. I know, I know oompa loompa orange man bad, anyone but him good.
You think so?? Biden prolly has the most experience, but in terms of the full package I’m not so sure, it’s looking like a repeat of 2016 where the party is split over the candidate, while Republicans are dedicated/unified
. Club for Growth launches anti-Biden ad blitz
Biden isn't rich.
DemoCRIPS gonna have to go back to the drawing board inside the lab and go full Socialist in 2024 with younger candidates. Bernie was moving on up and then the establishment circled the wagons and got behind Biden someone like KILLary benefiting off Obama name and won't win.
it's deeply callous to show off your dorky Jay Leno-ass cars when we've got some of the highest unemployment numbers since the depression. anyone who can't admit that because biden is in a blue jersey is a hack.
UPDATE: These are statewide buys in WI and PA. Group is also going up with anti-Biden spots in AZ
This morning Don wonders how voters can make up their minds about a second term for him without a debate with Joe Biden. Can anybody help him out?
Did anyone mention that you've been president for 3-1/2 years? It's your swamp. You're running against Joe Biden. I suggest you get briefed by your handlers on these points.
Id much rather have an incoherent Biden than an incoherent dictator
This strategy baffles me. They're setting the bar so low for Biden that anywhere near a decent debate performance will be seen as a huge win for him.
Yamiche didn't make the cut? Too many members of the business/financial press and no one from CNN, NBC, etc. This will be negotiated as the Biden camp would only accept a few of these people like Bret Baier and Hugh Hewitt perhaps but that's it! Don't see any liberal-leaners. 89.
Ridin till I diedin with Biden
A note on politics. If Kanye being in the race is so much of a threat to the DNC that people are calling him out for potentially stealing votes than the assumption that Biden had with thinking that he has the black vote automatically is true
Even if Biden were in cognitive decline, I would vote for him over the alternative.  Trump is a man in cognitive decline (and stupid), who also suffers from serious personality disorders &amp; symptoms: malignant narcissism, pathological lying, delusions of grandeur, histrionic PD.
The Republicans are using you to drive votes away from Biden.
Similar to doctoring photos in an anti-Biden ad?  Like telling 100+ significant lies in a 37 minute Axios interview?  No...nothing like that, Sherry4digits. You can go back to your little cult now. Let the grownups handle this.
You’re such a joke!!!! You must not watch/read the news . Spikes are happening everywhere, churches, schools, work etc!!!! Biden 2020
Biden should say "no I don't need any test to measure dementia!" 🤣
By voting for Biden!
Have you seen Joe Biden try to form a complete sentence lately?!  The debates are going to be a disaster for him!
It is simple Fat  Donnie you lie and Biden lies. So no one needs to here from either of you. Minds are made up and the votes will either be for you or against you. The dems could have put up a goat to run against you if they wanted to see a lively debate.
If Biden is so weak that you are upset that Kanye would even be a choice your issue isn’t with him or Trump. It’s with the Democrats for elevating yet another terrible candidate. If you think that people need less choice so they’re forced into BIDEN the he and you are the issue
Strange that I only know one person who admits to thinking tRump would be a better pres than Biden. She is an uneducated postal clerk whom I'd bet never voted in her 50+ years.
I am so pumped to hear  as she gives the keynote address at the   volunteer leadership conference, Gun Sense University, this Sunday!   Sign up to get an email reminder:   #GSU2020 #TeamJoe #WatchUsWork

I must have missed something but I am still yet to see anyone out for Biden.  Would Antifa qualify?
She needs to step if she really loves him,  cause he's for another mental break down. The Trump party is just using him to draw votes from Biden.
In what scenario would it benefit Harris to throw Biden to the wolves? It benefits her future to be a stalwart ally to Biden as President.
Trump outraises Biden in July, surpasses $1 billion for the cycle
Joe Biden literally wants “civilians” to have assualt rifles. His policies specifically exempt civilian police; you know, like the ones that murder black people all day long. Ask Joe Biden why he believes “weapons of war” should be given to racist cops.
You need to understand. Joe Biden’s alleged “gun control” exempts law enforcement. Joe Biden believes ARs are “weapons of war” but also believes the racist murderer who killed George Floyd ought to have one.   Joe Biden is a racist hypocrite.
Joe Biden wants it both ways. He specifically proposes to exempt law enforcement from gun control, meaning he will give guns to the man who murdered George Floyd while keeping them out of the hands of law abiding citizens. Joe Biden is a racist.
Reminder: Joe Biden’s gun laws specifically exempt law enforcement. In other words: Joe Biden would rather give George Floyd’s murderer a gun than trust you to choose the firearm you want.   Make your decisions accordingly.
At least someone is debating! God knows Alzheimer’s Biden isn’t.
So is Biden
I believe this so much more than I believe the polls of Biden winning by 10 points. The issue is that the White folks always show up to vote....
Do you see this shit! Yt killin' our people and hiden biden wants more cops! Blasphemy
My black/hebrew people he's letting you know your on his plantation and you ain't leavin. Let unc hiden Biden go! We have great options on the table. We could do Cube's contract, Dr. Claud Anderson's vote as a block. Both great plans. We need to pick our own leaders. Shalom
It keep telling slave minded black/hebrew folk time out for Massa Hiden Biden. Don't give the plantation/Dems ur vote. We need to look at Ice Cube's contract and if its kool meet out demands! I'm down with Dr.Claud Anderson in saying, "We need to vote as a block!" More on it l8tr
Again policy wise Joe Biden will be the most progressive president ever elected. Plain and simple. At the times they were elected they were the most progressive Obama/Kennedy/FDR

Joe Biden won't go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
If Joe Biden is a real Christian, Christianity is in trouble.
I'm supposed to vote for a guy that told me I'm not black if I don't vote for him? A guy that has been in Washington for 40+ years and is just now talking about doing something about racism? Nah, I'm good.  You may not like Trump, but don't act like Joe Biden is anything special
I thought it was Russia helping Trump win the election against a young, brilliant, patriot like Biden?
It isn't even on most people's radar that trump is trying to fast track the census so it ends a month early so that it's on his desk to sign in December instead of Biden's in January  The census is how representation in Congress is determined
Can we forget Trump and call Biden our 45th President?
No hoopla: Coronavirus upends Trump, Biden convention plans
So if you’re a patriot and you love your country, I’ll expect this same energy from you when Biden gets elected?
Biden is dropping out and he hasn’t playing up dementia to stay out of prison.  Cuomo will be on ballet.

#Senate was trying to get something against #Obama and #Biden for something for #Trump’s fictional tv ads.

Now if Trump tried to ban marriage for gays then that would be a different story. But then again, it also depends on what’s at stake. Biden, who poses a danger for us ALL,Americans as a whole then I’d still vote Trump. It’s not actually Biden but more so the radicalism behind him
I told my mom we should put up a giant Biden banner facing them. She's afraid we'll get vandalized. *sigh*
#ConsequencesForTrump. This is disgusting. This man has served 6 US presidents &amp; is doing this for his country . His family?! 🤬 These POS’s, who pretend to be “patriots,” are a disgrace to the US. These are scared/weak ppl. These cowards are 1 more reason why #Biden #Biden2020
Biden better not pardon him. Nixon should have rotted in jail.
Trump just needs to rattle him and Biden will fall apart
Until I brought it up?😂 Have  you  been  paying  attention  to  the  politics  of  2020?😂BTW,  you  did  mention  Kanye  taking  away  black  vote  from  Biden!😂Sorry  bud,  that equates  to  racial  ideology!😂😂😂🧐
Lol this nigga Biden in THAT interview w/e u wanna call it jus asked a mf if they a junkie 🤣🤣 one is jus as bad as the other if thats y u choosin
They actually think kanye can steal votes from Biden? MAGAts are his fans.
Biden pushes back on cognitive test question: ‘Why the hell would I take a test?'  via    Why doesn't this story detail the slurring and stuttering reflected in the video.  Also the fact that, if Trump said this guy was  a junkie he would be vilified.
Biden wasn't my first choice either. To be perfectly honest, he wasn't even my 10th choice. But he is the Democratic nominee, &amp; therefore the only candidate who can legitimately defeat Trump on election day. It's time we band together and get this criminal out of the White House.
"Here’s Why A Kanye West Run Might Be More Likely To Hurt Trump"  Okay, so this is kind of funny and pathetic. The GOP is attempting to use Kanye to split black votes with Biden and help Trump in the process. According to most polls, however,
“ Poor kids are just as smart and just as talented as white kids” ~Joe Biden
Get real dude. Biden just referenced crack cocaine with a black reporter asking if he was a junkie. Par for the course for this long-time racist. And you sit there like his lapdog. Shame!
There already isn't. The time has come to burn it down. Obama/Biden led to Trump. Next time (if there is one), the megalomaniac will be smarter.
One word.  Ukraine.  Trumps kids had u know a job.  How about Biden’s boy?
It’s a flu virus. You can’t control that, ever. The flu will always be a thing. And Biden can’t control what comes out of his mouth.
This is completely different lol, seriously. If only  &amp; EVERY other media outlet would post ALL of Biden's jacked up shit he says. Did you see the one where Sleepy thought he was at a senior center or where he started talking about kids rubbing the hair on his legs? 🤣
If you have Biden 2020 in your bio just stay away from #NoComradesUnder1k
Joe Biden says if elected president, he would not tear down the parts of the barrier along the U.S. border built during the Trump administration — but he would cease construction.
Let’s have Biden and Trump fight to the death, then the last one standing we kill them anyway.
We sure it's Joe Biden running for President or his wife Mrs. Jill Biden?  Have seen her get interviewed last 2 days and she handles herself extremely well with intelligence.  Should the left think about it? Joe as First Man?
Trump takes questions? Trump makes an idiot of himself every day. He &amp; his rube worshippers are the only ppl who think that's a plus for him. Errors, mistakes, lies. Biden is letting Trump bury himself. Trump is doing that very well. What an idiot.
NY Times: Trump Raises $165 Million With G.O.P. in July, Overtaking Biden
Lol, not me. I'm voting by mail. For Biden. Is Trump even going to be on the ballot? He's been looking pretty shaky lately. Didn't he look great in that Snow interview? He really had a handle on those charts, eh? Odds are Trump bails for "health" reasons.
Trump is using Kes mental illness to take the black vote away from Biden.
Uhh, do they think somehow this could pull votes from Biden? Are they truly that fking stupid?
My son and I both prefer Sanders over Biden... with NO  intention of doing a write-in or going third party. All votes must go to Biden.  But hey... fuck people like us. We're just "bitches" and a waste of time.
This is called a coup, and Obama, Biden etc should be prosecuted for treason.  Trump blows his nose and gets more negative press than the Obama/Clinton regime trying to steal an election, let that sink in
You won't see trump signs in my neighborhood. None. It's all Biden, ByeDon, BLM, In This House We Believe... I love it here.

You'll never make Biden look worse than Trump.
Most Ppl grow. No one is going to be turned off by this. 2.)  I have to assume those who say Biden’s not there, don’t follow politics except for Twitter and fb. When Trump has interviews / is not reading a script, he is legit mentally disabled. Like dumb dumb.

Every time I find myself thinking about Trump vs Biden I immediately think “man I hate trump”, followed immediately by “why the fuck are geriatrics running our country”
The fact that Kanye is now being used as a pawn in Trump’s attempt to win the election by taking Joe Biden’s votes is just so crazy. If you would’ve told me this is what 2020 would be like 10 years ago, I really would have asked if you write  Trump episodes.
I’ve been an independent for as long as I can remember but I join my band of brothers in supporting Joe Biden.
The Obama Administration gave a stand down order on Russian interference in the Election, tbh, I don't think Obama wanted Hillary to win, he called her Campaign "soulless" and I think what has happened with Trump and where Biden is was the hope all along.
Biden is not a socialist ?? Are you in denial or ignorant?Even Biden supporters know this!But don’t care... or support them themselves.Again, everything you listed all politians are guilty of. If you are searching for a quality ethical candidate who is pure and wholesome,you WONT
As dumb as anyone voting for Trump or Biden in hopes things will change for the better....
They do, and get ready, when Biden is in you'll pay more, which you can afford to do, slimeball.
True, probably.  Voting for the Democratic ticket, though, means voting for Joe freaking Biden to be "leader of the free world."  I'd like anybody whose name i've seen suggested better in the WH than Joe Biden, so pretty much any reasonable choice looks like a win to me.
Biden can’t wait to see who the deep state left has picked for his running mate. He wants that first sniff to be epic. Hope he does it on camera .

Looks about right! This is how Biden would spell without his team of social media managers.
But I saw a girl out campaigning  for Biden last week on cnn in an interview. Does jake watch his own network?
He will cripple our nation. Do not vote for Biden simply because you hate trump. That’s irresponsible and wreckless voting. Vote for who you believe can lead the country better. It isn’t about personality.I wouldn’t vote at all before voting purely on personal matters
This is so quaint. The first supporter will be texted and it will be all over Twitter in the next millisecond.   (I do support Biden! And have donated and am on his text and mailing lists. And I know not everyone is in the Twitter bubble. But.)
You know what most people think about Joe Biden? He's not Donald Trump. You could literally run any random person off the street and they would likely beat Trump. After 3.5 years of chaos and disfunction...most people have seen enough.
I think Biden should appoint an honest AG, restore professionalism to the DOJ, and let them investigate and decide on any prosecutions. The most important thing is that Biden NOT promise investigations or prosecutions. That is part of re-instituting separation of powers.
President Joe Biden

I guess it is easier for trumpers to attack Biden for this because it’s harder to talk about policy bc trump has failed to produce anything worth mentioning and has epically failed at everything he touches.
The lad is 77. We should all be able to accumulate at least SOMETHING for working that long. And with Biden endorsing the $15 minimum wage, we get closer to that!
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Believers for Biden National Call to Action w/Dr. Jill Biden! 8pm ET Thurs 8/6” – sign up now to join me!
This is the stuff I Love to see from Biden. Just a guy being a dude.   He’s adopted policies. He’s been tough. It’s good to see the man be a human! Miss that in a President.
I’m sorry for your disability but I think there are much better ways to attack Biden than calling him senile. It’s an easy shot that perpetuates ableism. I could do the same to trump for the same reasons you do it to Biden but I don’t because policy matters and is more effective
Trump’s been running photoshopped anti-Biden ads with doctored backgrounds. Some of the photoshopped pics came from the outing.   I’m just saying - ain’t no dog running up to Trump for scratches.
I will never be as cool as Joe Biden.
I wonder what an old fashioned democrat is thinking of their nomination. You know, the few that are left that are not insane. They have got to be losing their minds watching Biden
Okay. 1) You tweeted about Biden being senile bc he has a stiffer that he has always had.  2) you get called out for ableism  3) you say ur disabled, which I have no reason not to believe  3) I say it doesn’t excuse your poorly chosen words    And somehow I’m an idiot?
Me too. I firmly believe the DNC will never allow a debate. I still believe this. The first real sign is Biden not wanting to go to Wisconsin, citing the virus. This, will be the excuse. When we all have witnessed the real reason
We will when you are gone and President Biden restores sanity to the White House
Healthcare and much of our debt can be resolved by shrinking governmental aid. We already give way to much. Many jobless welfare ppl live identically to hard workers. It needs to be limited to those who truly need it. We would prob get out of debt that way. Biden would worsen it
I've never retweeted Biden or the Lincoln project and I always fight khive... does that count ?
It's cute that you think Biden will significantly back all of that. I'm sure he'll do exactly as his lobbyist tell him to do. Give the peasants a few crumbs so that they dont over throw the system

I am curious,does Biden ever tweet anything that DOESNT have Trumps name attached? Seriously?Has he campaigned at all to speak about what HE WILL DO,without using Obama and Trump?Obama as a crutch,Trump to continuously bash.If Trump is doing so poorly then WHAT are the right ways

Judge Trump - and any who would take his place - by what they do, &amp; have done, not by what they say. Anyone can talk a good story. Show me what they’ve actually done! What has Trump done in 3+ yrs? What has Biden done in 40+ yrs?  Then let real accomplishments drive ur decision
All this says to me is Biden would rather be spending the rest of his days driving this car than being president

Dogs like Joe Biden. Folks, that’s a good sign.
The propaganda is endless. Bernie is history, a footnote in the history books. Sad to see really, because even if Biden wins we are doomed to staying on the same damned path that brought us Trump.
If country is important to you, then how could you possibly see Biden as being fit for presidency? Even his supporters acknowledge he’s weak and not the better candidate but their personal hatred for trump outweighs the fact. That’s alarming! Trump is effective and they hate this
#TheFive gotta give hard to stomach Juan credit for loyalty and creativity!  He actually tried to rationalize and justify Biden's disconnected illogical reply to a reporter's question about his cognitive acuity...ending with him asking if the reporter was a junkie!!  Credibility?

It won’t be great until liberalism is defeated. It continues to infect our institutions, social values, and government all around. Instead of declining, its increasing each decade. You have helped halt the growth temporarily, but a Biden win would be disastrous for EVERY ONE!

My Chihuahua Pedro is excited to vote for Biden!
Yes.  Do you really believe every word of it, considering their entire goal was to hurt or bring down the President?  Mueller testified he had no idea who Crowdstrike was.  He's as senile as Biden is.  You actually believe Russia decided to hack because Trump told them to?  SMH

Joe Biden will be a President who truly believes in the American people, not one who belittles them.Biden could pick louis gohmert and I would still vote for him.
This pick is not about winning the election. Massive turnout of the 40% is Trump's only hope. And Biden's VP will have little effect. This pick is important because she'll likely be on the ballot in 2024. Biden will step aside, imho...
i REALLY don’t understand how we as the homies came to the conclusion that the TOP 2 people in our ENTIRE county fit to run it  is trump and biden.
Didn't Biden just put down blacks again by saying they're not as diverse as latinos?!!after he's accused them of not being black and called them roaches? Is he trying to not get elected? If dems could learn to stop using our skin colors against us and stop telling us how to ...

Joe Biden literally promoted segregation claiming "I don't want my kids living in a racial jungle" when describing his stance AGAINST school integration..  Supporting Biden and claim to be for Black Lives is like saying Hitler loved the Jews.

You are such a sheep. Name anything Biden has done to help the African American community in 50 yrs. all he’s ever done is hurt them. He’s voted against budding for them and said he didn’t want his kids growing up in a racial jungle and voted for the crime bill.

Get ya cone bread game right.  Biden rules.
Biden once again insulted the black community and has shown us that 2020 is in fact: Racist VS Racist. Yay us 🙃.
Yes, that's what I'm implying. Biden is currently the heavy favorite in betting markets, but will no longer be after the debates.
If you don't vote for Biden, you are voting for Trump. It doesn't matter who Biden's VP is. You want to be a courageous conservative? Conserve our country and vote for Biden.
Biden is incoherent
Joe Biden could select a dog turd as a VP and I would STILL vote for him. Trump is THAT bad. And voting for a third party candidate as a protest? That is essentially a vote for Trump anyway.
Thank god!
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?-These pathetic fools will stop at nothing to win,just as they did in 2016 ,the last time they had surprise on their side,this time we may have one of our own,which I will keep to myself for now
This should be a Biden ad. You are so on point!
Bill Clinton paid to keep children quiet. Im just waiting for him to wear a burger King crow at the debates. Remember bill Clinton is a pedo and a rapist. Oh and Obama went to pedo island too. And joe biden owns the island nextdoor.

That could be true. I know I shouldn't jump to conclusions, but the vast majority of people not picking religious topics like this with Biden are pro Trump. I'm personally not a Biden or Trump supporter, but I couldn't give a shit about their religion.

Lean into it. Start telling them that you were on the fence but now you’re specifically voting for Joe Biden because Trump said Biden possesses the power to harm God.

President Trump already is wasting no time attacking Biden over this gaffe:
RINO didn’t want to be confronted by Big Daddy so he is joining Hiding Biden in the basement!!!
Nah, Trump. I honestly don’t think this VP pick is going to move the needle for Biden.
If Biden says things this politically damaging to himself using prepared statements, imagine what will happen during the debates.   There will be blood.
In OH and the most signs I saw were legit when Bloomberg was running (they’re gone now).  I have seen less than 10 Biden and Trump signs. Waaaay less than previous elections.
Trump makes no sense. He lies which is his way of justifying anything he says because he actually believes it. I’ve never heard Joe Biden sound like he’s having a stroke but trump sounds like he’s on some type of medication. We will see. Anyways it will be a remote debate.
Wow — the four battleground states are amazing.    Even if it’s a split on those (Georgia and Iowa going for Trump, Ohio and Texas for Biden), it’s still an interesting mix of states.
these predictions are dangerous. even though he has biden winning, people need to vote as if we think hes gonna lose by a landslide. every voter needs to vote.

Maegan that is bull crap!  Biden has always just blown around like the wind. He has no ideas or principles of his own
Most of the Dems arguing for Biden to skip the debates are making excuses other than the virus risk, like "Trump shouldn't be given a platform to lie", or "Biden shouldn't debate Trump because he's so far ahead in the polls that there's no need for it."
So you’re fine with a man who has stage 4 dementia with zero platforms, and is nothing more than a puppet for the radical communist wing of the left? You’re not getting Joe Biden, you’re getting those who want Western civilization broken up.

Trump will never debate Biden. He knows his antics of 2016 won't play in 2020. He knows how stupid he is. He will abuse his power AGAIN and cancel at the last minute. Maybe his buddy, Kim Jong Un, will fire a missile.
I’m not a Democrat. I’m not a Republican. I’m a left leaning independent that refuses to have a political party tell me what I can and cannot do or believe. I don’t like Trump. I don’t like Biden. But I’ll be damn sure to vote the orange cretin out of office November.
Says the guy who never had it. Still better then Biden.
Biden is fighting for those folks but he has to *win* to help them.  This humanizes him and uses nostalgia to build hope for the future.  Lighten up.
Is that joe Biden?
Let's say Biden wins the election. Knowing the left controls MSM, that makes it logical that the fake polls shows dumbass Biden leading. Why? Because if the left is accused of cheating,  their answer will be that dumbass Biden lead all the polls, so he didn't cheat.
At this point I honestly can't think what Barr could accuse Biden of that would have any real impact as DJT would undoubtedly actually b guilty of the same thing, only 10X worse PLUS a hundred other things. Also Dems have learned from "HER EMAILS!!" &amp; aren't going 2 b fooled.

Heck, Biden mixed up his words a minute later...  “I’m forward looking to” the debates.
When they have the debates the 40% who vote Democratic all the time will say "Biden was so much better, Trump is completely out of it"; the 40% who vote Republican will say the exact opposite, and the rest of us will say "why do we have to pick between these 2 senile old men?"
Okay so I just went from a Biden fan (which I’ve been from the start) to being a SuperFan.    This is a kick ass, kinda funny clip.  😎🙌
It really was very disturbing to read the news concerning Bill Summers, his involvement in the fund raiser for trump and his comments towards Joe Biden. It’s a shame that you would have a man like that serving on your board! Very disappointing.

Oh really?  Is that why the post office just backed Biden?
So your only response is, "But... Biden!" Sounds a lot like the classic deflector, "But... her emails!" Sorry you didn't get enough participation trophies as a child.
In the short term does it really matter who Biden picks?? I can't see Democrats not voting for Joe. I can't see Trumpers taking a pause and thinking, "okay, that VP pick Joe made is awesome I'm going to vote for Joe..."  Just pick somebody already and let's roll.
You have that wrong. Crazy is a vote for Biden
It's pure partisan bullshit. People are afraid of how Biden is going to perform.

Venting- I would never not vote. I mentioned in this thread I just need to get over the initial shock of hearing, I’m allowed to be frustrated and express my feelings. Our state is burning and morale is pretty low. We know the consequences of a Biden win.
There’s one or two more that have yet to be written that I’m pretty excited for! But in the meantime, this one is priceless. I wish they had a gofundme or something in lieu of flowers to donate to Biden or local down ballot candidates! Pretty sure they’d make a million on Day 1!
Imagine believing this. Lol. Biden is shit and he won't even pretend to support anything remotely progressive. He sucks and so do you for voting for him.
Oh well. Biden doesnt get my vote because he hasn't earned my vote. Green it is.
COVID-19 is not a hoax at all. We need a Real president who will lead us out of this crisis And that leader needs to be biden not trump. Biden did not commit Treason Trump Did.

Reports of something happening in China last December,and Xi could have alerted the world last November when he became fully aware of the situation,but no they played politics or in Trump’s case didn’t care, so now here we are and unfortunately more to come,before Biden can take
Ummmm....why would a Biden supporter come to a Trump event? 🤔  js
Imagine believing this. Biden is beholden only to his corporate handlers. He doesn't give a hoot about working people and never has. I'll never vote for him.
Trump is a symptom of Democrats turning their backs on working people for years. Electing Biden and more failed neo liberalism ensures another Trump 4 years from now.
As much as I would love to see Biden win TX and absolutely crush Trump, I would much rather see almost all resources go to FL, WI, MI, PA, AZ, and maybe NC.

She's not out of a job because a customer complained.  She resigned because she refused to wear non-political mask. If people started wearing Trump or Biden masks it would be the same issue.
Well according to Joe Biden  black people  must think a certain way . Or “you ain’t black”
No real Catholic would ever support abortion as Biden does.
Tbh, I thought the same with the Bernie debate. I'm not defending him or his cognitive decline, which is apparent, but whatever the hell they give trump so that he can do 45 minute pressers, they are giving it to Biden. Biden bareley gaffed in the debate, he just ruthlessly lied.

"When it was pointed out that he actually can’t win in 2020—that he won’t be on enough ballots...and thus was serving as a spoiler, West replied: “I’m not going to argue with you. Jesus is King.”"
Biden is by far the worst candidate.  Dude can’t even speak correctly and is a pedo.  If you voting for him then you are voting out of pettyness
Joe Biden personally intervened to keep the word “occupation” out of the official Democratic platform, according to a new report.

Show me the Black family that thinks Joe Biden is going to make their lives better and I'll show you a family that is already lost.
If that's what's actually happening, fine, but stop calling this "Americans united for Joe Biden" virtual campaign rally / TV special "the Democratic National Convention."  Our culture's dire sloppiness with words is a real and serious part of its dysfunction.
As most of my followers know I'm just a simple man. So I'm going to keep this real simple. It's no mystery that the Democratic party has taken advantage of the blind loyalty of Black voters for decades. The ultimate proof of that is a vote for Biden. You're making it too easy.🤔
That aside, what gets me most here is that it's one thing for Kasich to be featured in the line-up of a kind of "Americans united for Joe Biden" virtual campaign rally / TV special. I can quarrel with that but it's at least a concept that can stand up to initial examination.
Randy Quaid to Joe Biden: "In the words of my generation: Up yours!"
This has to be satire right? Comrade is how Communists call each other the #NoComradesUnder1k aimed at communist/socialist/leftist so of course, it's full of Sanders and Green Party supporters that dislike Biden.
Fortunately, Biden is ethical. He may not be right 100% of the time (who is?) but I have no doubt that he will put this country over his own financial interests.
Tell that to racist Biden

Biden should ask China to find trumps missing tax returns just to watch the GOP EXPLODE.

Both political parties are responsible for mass incarceration. Biden is not solely responsible.
Ofcourse the Russians dnt want Biden to win
Was there any doubt in any sane person's mind that Biden was always the front man for Obama and his crew?  himself said he was disappointed that he ran out of time to "transform" America and since the coup failed,  needed a Plan B. Joe is Plan "B"!
Trump Told Ohio Biden Will Hurt God With ‘Live Or Let Die’ As His Anthem
I don't really want joe biden to win, but I do want trump to lose, so 🤷
Can Biden ban Trump Hotels by Executive Order? Asking for private companies everywhere.
The Kasich idea is still terrible but I sympathize greatly with this person:  “We want to have as few elected officials as possible,” said one Biden adviser. “Every one of these politicians — they give them three minutes but then they take 15."
I mean obviously it’s pandering to his deeply evangelical base but are they really ~that~ far removed from reality they think biden hates god? there’s never been an anti religious president and I kinda doubt there ever will be
i’m curious where trump is getting his unhinged “biden will abolish religion and god” shit like nothing remotely about biden’s campaign is anti religious lol
Everyone on this thread: Biden can't win Ohio.  Ohio:
This is the official Biden Trump dirt bike jump song
Can they get it to Biden before the debates???
Trump made a speech not long ago &amp; does all the time really without notes or a teleprompter while interacting with others. Biden can’t get through a free sentences. People need to stop letting their hatred for Trump lead them to a tragic vote. You want Joe to have nuclear codes?
I meant Jill Biden. Either which way this is their way of getting Joes image out there while still hiding him out. Is bullshxt!
Alright everyone  is all paid up and officially a corporate sponsor of my upcoming dirt bike jump over the Biden Trump debate in Cleveland thank you for your support
Mark my words, when Joe Biden names his VP, the right will aim to make the race solely about her. Biden has proven too tough an opponent so they will go with the whole "she's only a heartbeat from the president and she is literally Fidel Castro-Hitler only worse."
I cant wait for Biden to win, then call you all out when he offers up a "thoughts and prayers aren't good enough " when god forbid something bad happens
Biden the Ultimate Risk – Are Votes Tools in the Hands of the Free, or Weapons in the Hands of Haters?
Do you realize: He has NO Faith in any religion so keeping it private is a moot point; he dragged Biden’s Faith (which he regularly displays) into a political lie; and that the point of the interview was to prove exactly how unreligious he is. Stop defending the indefensible!!!
I can vote for Biden if he chooses anyone for VP BESIDES Susan Rice or Karen Bass
#FoxNews needs to get rid of  there is no place for someone on their network that makes excuse after excuse about #JoeChina AKA  #Racist comments #Biden has a 50 year history of being a Racist. Do some homework #JessicaTarlov
What if Joe Biden doing that?!!
At least one of them told it like it is and it sure wasn't  #Biden is a racist and this lady pointed it out perfectly, what does #Tarlov do she defends him.
One of the most bias people ever to be on #FoxNews is  she knows #Biden is a giant #Racist and she still tries to defend his Racist comments. Open your eyes #Tarlov you're a closed minded moron.....
What was hunter Biden doing in Moscow??
BTW... how about quoting some of the many many horrible things that your guy Trump has said. Its easy to quote the things Biden has said because there's so few. With Trump let's start with him saying about White supremacists, 'there are good people on both sides.'
im from Ohio and im ridin with biden
If someone has already decided not to vote for Trump, they would then vote for Biden, unless they had an additional choice. That's the game  and  are playing. Kanye has millions of followers and many don't understand the power votes.
Huh, I thought that social media was supposed to be biased against conservatives??? But what do we have here? It looks like Instagram is biased against Biden.   Where is the #ConservativeOutrage at political bias in social media?
Trump Told Ohio Biden Will Hurt God With ‘Live Or Let Die’ As His Anthem
Today they sent me a video about settling for Biden that was set to the tune of "Go Go Go Joseph." I've never felt more seen.
They’re not close to the same. I’m conservative so clearly Biden isn’t ideal but he’s not a narcissist + he’ll be willing to listen/act on his advisors/experts he puts in place to help him. Trump has his message if advisor disagrees he/his people undermine and attack the expert.
Foreign Press is Seriously Questioning Biden’s Cognitive Ability
You know with the other two, we arent getting anything we want. Kanye is probably crazy enough to actually rubber stamp something positive into existence. With trump amd biden, we already know what we get. A giant shit sandwich.
you keep jumping back and forth man ... this is what liberals and people without facts do . they can’t stay focused for 30 seconds .   biden probly did launder money through the ukraine man . which means HE SHOULD be investigated . which means the “favor “.... is just justice .

I AM JOE BIDEN AND APPROVE THIS MESSAGE:
Regardless of what you might think, we only have two choices this Nov. Joe Biden or trump. A vote for Kanye, a write-in, or a Didn’t Vote are all helping trump. Can you justify participating in the final destruction of our democracy? If not, you Must vote for Joe.  #Biden2020
One source said  would appear on the same night as  "early in the week in a demonstration of unity. The duo would be designed to showcase a broad anti-Trump coalition that is backing Biden."
Liar! Biden doesn’t want to take our guns. He thinks we might need them for protection from your secret police force!
Joe Biden is the Democratic presidential candidate America deserves.  Note: America is consistenly on some trash as evidenced by the fact that we elected lifetime failure, reality show personality, and Oompa Loompa - Donald Trump - as POTUS
the last time this man was near a church people were gassed!  To attack Joe Biden on his religion is BEYOND THE PALE!  Can you honestly say you made the right vote on impeachment?  You both deserve to be voted out of office!
Ya joe Biden is the answer. Easy to point out people’s faults and act like you would of had a plan. Raise the F out of taxes to support more people to sit at home. Along with supporting another stimulus to encourage more to sit at home. I’ve heard from people what they make. Joke
So Meg puts out a video y’all don’t like and now y’all back to roasting her🤣🤣🤣🤣🤷🏾‍♂️I wish it could be that easy to get everybody off the Biden train like that.
But she will be judged far less harshly than a nonbinary person would be judged. Biden needs to pick a nonbinary running mate.
This is absolutely the wrong position. Either vote for Biden regardless of his VP choice, or risk four more years of the grand finale of America as the greatest nation on earth.
Compare the campaigns’ websites. Biden’s includes tons of detailed policy proposals. Trump’s doesn’t say anything in particular about what he would do with a 2nd term. There is no comparison.
Interesting. Joe Biden told me that means you aren't black
Just look back at everybody who told us to get over everything Biden says. “Shut the hell up and grow up” “He’s the only way to beat Trump” He knows he can say anything and he’ll get support from the elite corporate democrats and the easy to sway Biden Bros🤷🏾‍♂️
I see so many in the comments drinking Biden’s kool side. There’s no defense on what he said that’s why he apologized. It’s obviously how he thinks. Imagine what he says privately. And don’t come at me with Trump. His wrongs don’t make Biden right
He is you don’t see it !  Biden is the son of Lucifer which is Barry Obama  ,,
That it’s Joe Biden and you hate Joe Biden
As Dr. King clarified for us all, an “eye for an eye” leaves everyone blind. We’ve become a nation of the blind leading the blind. Open your eyes. VOTE BIDEN. #Biden2020

Because Joe Biden is racist.
Imagine he’s in one of the talks with China or Russia or whoever and he has one of stupid outburst and starts talking off-the-wall they will laugh at us they won’t take Biden seriously how could anyone think that is the right move to make
#JoeChina AKA  "You ain't black if you vote Trump" contrasting #AfricanAmerican, Latino diversity". "You can't go to a 7-11 without an Indian accent". How #racist is this guy? #Biden is almost a #WhiteSupremacist
Why Is Joe Biden Silent on the Attacks Against Catholic Statues, Churches, and Beliefs?
Does it matter though? The DNC chose Biden as the nominee and made sure he "won", despite no organization to speak of and no tangible support. They must think the same is possible (or already assured) in November.
Not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump and four years of uncontrolled kleptocratic dictatorship. Don’t again vote for the Russia backed Jill Stein spoiler candidate.
Amazing..   I have cone to a conclusion that Biden will have to back out in a week or two... new candidates named at convention ... excitement by dems of course .. but no results on election night will be the beginnings of Nancy trying to drag Potus out of WH. Not habbening !
I don’t give a crap if Biden even forgets his own home address. We can’t have 4 more of this shitshow.
Mr. President  #JoeChina AKA  has a nearly 50-year history of being a #Racist this is his true belief. How many #AfricanAmerican were incarcerated as a direct result of his Crime bill? No Doubt about how #Biden is racist ask #LeoTerrell and #LarryElder
PLEASE don’t vote for him or write in a vote for him. He’s trying to take votes away from Biden. This is not ok
Me too, and they’re absolutely right.
if biden is corrupt ... perhaps ... he should be investigated... and ... the president is the head of the branch of govt that enforces the law bro .... 😂

Electing Biden will cause the Dems to lose both the house and senate in 2022.
I agree he’s not going away.   His ego would never allow that.  But what is the impetus for staying with a guy who may have been repudiated by 10 points or more?  Barring a Biden melt down, I just don’t see a reason for discipline to suddenly manifest in Trump and tighten this.
Lmaoooo this was a good one. Between him and Biden I get all the comedy I need these days. Idk how I’m supposed to pick just one let’s just put both in there n see what happens. Dual presidents, double trouble
If Biden loses they'll blame the leftists, but if they win they'll ignore any idea supported by leftists.  Mark my words.

Sounds like one of the first pardons for Biden to grant along with Reality Winner.
that’s def fair. have seen folks bitching about AOC these days (i mean look she endorsed biden, can we even trust her)
Yeah says the true blue Biden supporter. I’m sure you would give  President Trump the same benefit of the doubt right?...lol
This is crazy, I hate biden almost equally. But it's hard to imagine another 4 years of just heading toward facism at lightspeed under trump. Or it could be on a river boat casually with Joe. It's like the right only knows the 2nd amendment exists,  the rest dont matter
That lady would blow trump or biden out of the water in a debate. I'm sorry but like her or not, she is 10x as smart as either if those career ladder climbing ass kisses. She would tear them up with just words.
People trying to shame people for not loving Biden is dumb.
All as I heard was biden saying black people dont have culture. which is not only not true, but really stupid. How are we seriously electing old white guys,  that are so far out of touch with the world. I want someone who has a glimpse of normal life as a leader. Fucking biden.
Yeah, I think that's fair. Hadn't considered that.  Though, I hope you can admit Trump's resume in the "comments degrading/harming/marginalizing minorities/poor people" is a LOT longer/bulkier than Biden. Probably why he's held to a different standard on the topic.   Right?
Maybe if Biden promises not to hurt God Kayne will back off?
Trump hadnt completed a coherent sentence in 4 years and dont get me started on the lies.. My point is that even with Biden the way he is. he is still more competent than Trump, and that truly is a sad tbing gor our country
“There will not be another foot of wall construction in my administration,” Biden said. (via Fox News)
Get it right. Biden “clarified.”  He did NOT apologize.
Really?? Like what has Biden done to show he can unite America??? Name one. I’ll wait.
What faith???? Biden has none.
biden dirt ..... you mean the bidens laundering billions of tax dollars ? does biden get a pass for some reason ?
Let's make a list of trump's divisive statements and compare. I'll put my money on Biden.
One more time: "Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly diverse attitudes about different things," #Biden said
I can't stand seeing Trump signs where at one time the vote was blue collar, union worker blue, but I'm also seeing Biden signs in places I haven't expected. Exaggerating what's wrong isn't realism, it's as skewed as an overly rosy view. Effective organizing requires clarity.
If they don't like Biden, they probably weren't voting for him in the 1st place and now they're not going to vote for Trump. Mission accomplished!
YOU HAVE NO CLUE AND YOU TOTALLY DISRESPECT AND UNDERESTIMATE AFRICAN AMERICANs' INTELLIGENCE AND DEPTH.  Big surprise there, huh?   AND Mr. Biden CLARIFIED what he was stating.   YOU NEED TO STOP YOUR EVILNESS.  NOW, IS THE TIME FOR YOU TO BE BEGGING FOR GOD'S MERCY.  REPENT!
Another crazy cat lady for Biden.  Does inhaling cat crap fumes turn you into a liberal Democrat
This just in:  Joe Biden has tested positive for being a closet racist. So sad to hear. Probably will never make a full recovery from this. Thoughts and prayers
Biden’s comments are. Trump mispronunciations is not. True.
how stupid do you think we are?  You are becoming an insult to the American people.  CNN avoids on-air coverage of Biden's 'Are you a junkie?' remark about taking a cognitive test  #FoxNews
If you put away your bias for a minute you can easily find the 30 years of Biden’s racist history.  It’s not hard to find.
Yeah, Biden said all that. It was demeaning. Trump didn’t. Does that clarify it for ya?
Honest question, not snark - would she want to do this / say nice things about Biden / the party? I know it wasn’t her who had the “Hillary sucks” quote a few months back, but wasn’t sure how in lock step she was with the Squad.

Joe Biden has a big mouth on the loose lipped you imagine someone that doesn’t know where he is doesn’t know what he still doesn’t know how he’s doing it to keep secrets for the government I just can’t see it and if American votes for him I just can’t see how they could do that
Apart from the message (which clearly also was a flub), now you see why the Dems have kept Biden hidden.  Stammering. Blinking. Seemingly forgetting where he's going. Trump is going to have a field day with this.
I saw what you were saying about President Trump saying Biden was against God of course he speaking to his base there what you’re allowed to do politics are dirty but Democrats did it to themselves did you forget about this?
Racist? Trump? Did you hear Biden’s race comments yesterday? He is the racist. Trump has done FAR more for minorities than any president in a long time. If Trump is a racist then he isnt a very good one. #Opportunities
Racist are you seriously that far out of touch Bill? No one has done more for minorities than Trump. You ever hear Biden speak? No one is a bigger racist than him.

Oh yeah, Biden and the other democrats have good reason to take black votes for granted. There is never any scrutiny of these politicians among black voters. Democrats have little reason to value the black vote because we give it to anyone with a D next to their name so easily

Woke up.  Trump still in office, smh.  Just donated to the Biden Campaign.  May not be much $, but every time I am able, I do.
Yeah that’s the kind of old white man crap that makes me not like him that much. That doesn’t make him a white nationalist. Again Biden was far down my list of Democrats i would’ve liked to see nominated. That still puts him lightyears beyond Trump

Corruption at its finest. via. ⁦
Your talking Biden right? Bc at least Trump can put a sentence together, actually talk at length without forgetting, bumbling &amp;  losing his lines ..
From the left? Bullshit. We critiqued Biden harder than anybody.
My point is the fact regardless of what you think of Trump, the message during the campaign to drain the swamp of career politicians, appealed to a lot of people. Biden embodies the swamp.
The old Biden looks nothing like the new Biden. Pay attention
Does anyone have a dirt bike I can borrow to jump over the Biden Trump debate coming up in Cleveland?
I would rather have a blunt President than sneaky quiet snake Biden. Biden has been in office for over 40 years, nothing great happened in America. If you don’t agree with me, then please tell me what America has accomplished in 40 years.
Joe Biden, like Tom Ridge (a REPUBLICAN ALSO FROM PENNSYLVANIA) is a CATHOLIC.   And pro - choice as well.   And someone who struggled with a SPEECH (and hearing) problem his whole life.   Keep it up, Pence.  Even the southern Christians are going to be voting for Biden soon!!

Anyone who genuinely respects and honors God recognizes how deeply sacrilegious it is to attack another person’s relationship w God. I hope Biden will rise above this. He’s LIVED his faith through lifelong action.❤️ actions demonstrate the hypocrisy of his words
I’m sorry but Bush era Republicans slobbering over Joe Biden makes me sick.
Happens. Even if Biden was in a coma, he’d do less damage than Trump.  I’ve come to terms that one of our preferred candidates can’t win the Presidency. Just the nature of a singular executive election.  Legislatures are our best tool.
There’s only one person’s death I check for first thing every day and it ain’t Biden.
Though I've always been afraid of what happens if Biden dies after we vote early🤷‍♂️

My Statement on Faith. Like so many people, my faith has been… | by Joe Biden | Aug, 2020 | Medium
please don't tepeat trump's nasty nicknames.  Mr. Biden deserves better that that.  Words are piwerful. Thanks! ❤🇺🇸💙
No 💙. Now please use your platform to encourage young voters to vote for Biden so we can get president orange the fuck out of office
Holy crap, this 'take your gun away' AGAIN? It was said about Johnson, Carter, Clinton and Obama but I'm still a Democratic gun owner. You think Biden can "Hurt God", but he can't cancel the 2nd Amendment. And you can't cancel the 1st Amendment.
Biden is pro-abortion...
Yeah, Kamala Harris's race had nothing to do with it. Pure political instinct on  Biden and Gabbard's part.🙄
Biden is clearly against blacks.
Biden is without a doubt better, no acting necessary.. There is and has never been a more incompetent president/nominee than Donald Trump
Biden? We're talking about Trump.
😂😂😂 see what Biden got idiots saying...
First saying what Biden has done equals what Trump has done and continues to do is a spectacularly false equivalence. Second a true white nationalist would die before helping let alone being a major reason a black man became president so there’s that
Of who? A babbling senile Biden?
It'll turn into Trump attacking and trying to draw Biden in. Waste of time. I would say if it's done remotely. Cutting off each candidate so the other doesn't know what was said and so neither could interrupt. Then we could hear what each offers.
Asinine? Did you hear Biden’s racist statements today?
Joe Biden just keep dogging the shit out of black people and y'all still screaming vote for him....smh
I’m from Ohio- about 30 miles south of Cleveland. 1) this is not a crowd in Cleveland, you wouldn’t get that big of a turnout in Cleveland. 2) My neighborhood- made up of mostly Biden supporters, including myself. MAGA isn’t as strong as you want it to be.
Lol Biden loses ground every time he opens his mouth. He needs to just stfu until Nov. 3rd.
Another Biden gem
Joe Biden is clearly suffering dementia so you won't actually be voting for Joe, you will basically be voting for whoever he picks as his VP.  It gets better. You won't really be voting for the VP either, you will be voting for whoever Obama and Soros choose. Maybe Pelosi!
As opposed to T rump and Pence? Anyone Biden picks will make a better ticket than T rump/Pence. C’mon now
NO and NO.  Mr. Biden is actually WORKING.... putting together &amp; PLANNING ways to dig U.S. out of the h*llhole GOP &amp; trump have put us in!!  it's *hear
Well this is not good, but it backs up my conviction that Pennsylvania is the State Biden needs to spend most of his time in.  What does  have to say?
Fuck em, vote for the Supreme Court seats. The main difference is spoiled milk Biden comes with a refrigerator stocked with healthy, edible foods. Rotten egg Trump is surrounded by more rotten eggs and an expired jar of mayo that's been there since 1985.
"Black" people come from many different parts of the world too; they're not all indigenous to Africa. Homogenizing their culture &amp; ethnicity is offensive.  Also, Biden could've easily made his point without making any reference to black people at all. His comment is bad form.
In all due respect if it’s that important then you shouldn’t vote Green this election. I get what you mean by California going to Biden but every vote for Biden is important in case Trump tries to claim some sort of conspiracy theory to negate the outcome.
Robin Williams Warned Us About Joe Biden Years Ago
I am willing to vote for Joe Biden to vote Trump out. I think that says it all.

Is there anybody that listens to Joe Biden speak and thinks nothing’s wrong?Biden can’t even remember what he ate for breakfast yesterday wtf are u talking about??? The guy literally can’t talk for 5 or 10 minutes without losing his complete train of thought
It's no wonder Biden has such a hard time doing interviews or answering questions..... You ever try to talk with BOTH feet in your mouth??
Inaccurate.  He ASKED him if he was a junkie.That was in a dreadfully expressed comparison:asking Biden to take cognitive test presumes he may have cog.  impairment, just as asking the reporter to take a drug test presumes he may be junkie. I don’t support Biden; I support truth.
My mind is made up, and no debate will change a thing. It's Biden for me. I've had quite enough of his opponent's blathering.
This after his interview with Charlamagne tha God back in May. Smh.  Biden seeks to clarify comment that Latino community is diverse, 'unlike the African American community'  I can't wait for the debates.
He wants more debates because Biden is incoherent and bumbling. His campaign has 0 substance. He will talk him off the stage.
You said Obama was going to take everyone’s guns away. He didn’t. Now you’re saying Biden will? He won’t. Safer processes to obtain firearms doesnt equate to someone breaking down your door and taking your guns. How gullible you must be to believe this moron.

Why does everyone think Biden is announcing today?
Ya'll can't keep saying that  needs to do interviews while reporting what he said in an interview. Quit just reporting soundbites and air the entire interview. For the record Biden's supporters are thinking about this pandemic. #MSNBC #FirstLook

That’s fine, but I want to make explicit what my point was: Like many political gaffes, Biden’s statement was accurate but politically clumsy. It needlessly opened himself up to phony charges of racism, when his real failing was poorly considered speech.
We MUST learn from the failure we the people were during Obama. We pretty much sat on our ASSES and allowed GOP to freely piss on 44! Unless we STAY as active as now to support President Biden on Twitter AND in the streets, we'll be in this maga mess again. 🤷‍♂️

Biden, Other Democrats to Skip Milwaukee for Convention Over Virus Worries
I believe 45 believes Kanye will pull in the black Dems from voting for Biden. I don't think they'll vote for an unhinged moron just because he's black. He's running on Rep ticket and. ANY voter who'd vote for 45 can't recognize unhinged. He'll prob lose his own black voters.
Not because they believe in him, but because they hate Biden.
I'll take help from wherever it comes, but I'm not sure if the voice of a 91 year-old Noam Chompsky will motivate younger voters. On the bright side, by comparison, he  makes 77 year-old Joe Biden look like a kid. #VoteTrumpOut

Biden wants to put Beto Orourke in charge of gun control... the same guy who said “hell yeah we’re coming for your guns!” And Biden has also said “no one needs a gun other than a shotgun for hunting”
Most of the noise on the debate has come from some Democratic advisors to  Biden, be he's pro-debate, 3 as opposed to 4. If Trump refuses, it only weakens him(good). They're trying frame Biden as losing it mentally, why would a sitting POTUS with shaky polls not debate him? IMO

I don't think I've heard Trump mention this military training tragedy at all. He's been too busy bragging on Twitter. Biden already sounds more presidential. Rest in peace heroes, and prayers to your families.
Nothing makes me laugh more than the fact that people’s argument about not liking Biden is “he can’t fuckin talk anyways!”   Opposed to Trump who can’t form a sentence without the word great and running in circles.   Neither can talk.
ABSOLUTELY NOT! Biden is not capable of debating. DNC will make a million excuses why he can’t. Get out your popcorn. Guess what wild excuses they will come up with.

Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate
Calling Trump something, no. Nor for making funny of him. Do you know why? Because he is a bully who attacks others. Bullies only understand people treating them like they treat others. Not he same situation, Trump can stop being an asshole, Biden will always have a stutter.

If Joe Biden does this, then I wanna party with Joe Biden.   After I vote for him, of course.
Trump pisses everyone off, Biden doesn't.
I’ll literally win $10,000 if Elizabeth Warren is Biden’s running mate and I still don’t want that.
Yep. Because I am special. How about you? And for the record, I call him an Orange Monstrosity, so as not to compare him to other people or animals. As for his speech, I do not make fun of how he says things, I point it out to people who attack Biden for his speech impediment.
I thought Biden was putting on an act so when he learns he's in trouble (re: Ukraine) he can't be held accountable but now it looks like he has either actually lost it or in 2nd stage of dementia. No wonder he can't find a VP.
Who "forced them" to drop out &amp; can you provide proof of that? All you have explained is the Bernie supporter conspiracy theory. I have disputed your position based on reality, not some whiny bias. So you understand my position, Biden was not in my top 5. But he won.
What propaganda? Biden was out of money and trailing in the polls until he unexpectedly won a Primary. Then he started sweeping them. With out much money or advertising.  It sounds like you have bought the propaganda.
Obama had a pandemic response team. He never would’ve let it gone as far as it did. Fuck trump. He runs this country like a mobster. I’m November we’re all voting for joe Biden. Let a real leader come in and fix this shitty mess trump has caused.
Btw orange man. I hear that governor kasich. A republican is gonna speak for joe Biden. Our next president. At the democratic convention.

So you and Ryan are fine with losing this country to fascism to prove a point, or really to throw a tantrum because you didn't get you way. Either get on board or shut up. Bernie didn't win, Bernie has accepted and told people that Biden is the answer to an existential threat.
This would lose and it would be way easier for Trump to portray a Biden presidency as radical.
i dont feel like the majority of black ppl are political like that i think that 90 % just wanted Obama in bc he was black tbh i dont believe 90% will vote biden most things that i see black ppl hate biden
I disagree. Pence did wonders for Trump's support with the Evangelicals as well as those who thought he didn't have Government experience. Hopefully Biden picks someone who adds to the ticket.

Thank you! Still growing. I can't wait to see Trump spank Biden. I can't wait to see the debate either. lol
I agree, Biden is the best of all Democrats to run for president and lead our once great nation.
Looks like  is a racist too, or he's just plain stupid - too.
Biden is against Blacks, that we know.
Why Joe Biden may be exactly what the country needs right now  via

Yea but voting for Biden is better? Seriously?!
You want to vote for Biden. The alternative is a money laundering lying tax cheating Russian asset letting a virus kill 160k Americans while Russians pay bounties to terrorists to kill US soldiers, but only if Joe picks the right VP? Get tested. You may be brain dead. #Biden2020
This is not about liberal or conservative anymore. This is about democratic republic vs fascist dictatorship. If you believe in our constitution, you must support Biden. #Biden2020
Another sign he should probably take one of those Joe Biden tests, too....
You are not well. Biden is ill. It is sad. You must watch CNN and MSNBC. Change your channel. The only way Biden could win, is by cheating. If it happens America will be destroy by the socialist. I do not want any child to live in a socialist country.
Con men always build trust that they are experts and saviors.  Criminals always point at others doing their crimes. Millions of jobs and Biden hates God.  Do your own research.
Well, Biden is too scared to speak to a camera in Milwaukee...
Yeah, I can see why  won't let  debate   Biden is a blithering idiot.
TRUMP is as sharp as a tact. Now Biden does not know who he is running against. He does not know what state he is in. It is not funny it is very sad. Stress is not good for his condition. He can only win by cheating. VOTE TRUMP so save America.
That makes no sense, just like Biden when he opens his mouth. Go Trump. Do not let those evil democrats cheat.
Biden is a sick man. He can only win by cheating. The democrats have cheating in their evil DNA. Trump has been the best president in years. He loves his country. Democrats hate America. VOTE TRUMP to save America from the evil socialist.
The only way Biden could win is by cheating. That is why Dems are pushing so hard for mail-in ballots.  Biden could not run a PTA meeting, let alone our country. The socialist will control him. VOTE RED to save America.
Really small thin crowd again.  Trump supporters are shrinking.  Ex republicans are growing by the day.  Biden will make America a whole lot better in soooooooo many ways!!
Wow, Joe Biden has the power to “hurt God”.  💪

Dotard Donnie making fun of Biden after he just called Thailand, thigh-land. Whatever he blames on others, is what he's actually doing. Loser.
. what’s the Biden clip you mentioned in today’s Periscope ?
I plan on voting Biden and I find it *hilarious* that Trumpers are jumping all over this given . . . [waves arms wildly at every bonkers thing and lie and crime Trump says and does all the time] . . . but also his answer was not well-artful by at least the normal scale.
There is nothing anyone could do to damage the Biden campaign more than simply putting him in front of a camera on national TV for a half hour and letting him speak unscripted.
To the people stealing Biden signs in our neighborhood-not only is it childish, it’s counterproductive as I’ll simply buy another one, which puts more $$ in Joe’s coffers. #ByeDon2020
Did anyone mention that you've been president for 3-1/2 years? It's your swamp. You're running against Joe Biden. I suggest you get briefed by your handlers on these points.
Yamiche didn't make the cut? Too many members of the business/financial press and no one from CNN, NBC, etc. This will be negotiated as the Biden camp would only accept a few of these people like Bret Baier and Hugh Hewitt perhaps but that's it! Don't see any liberal-leaners. 89.
Similar to doctoring photos in an anti-Biden ad?  Like telling 100+ significant lies in a 37 minute Axios interview?  No...nothing like that, Sherry4digits. You can go back to your little cult now. Let the grownups handle this.
Biden won't go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
I will never be as cool as Joe Biden.
If everyone starting saying, Come On Man! Like Joe Biden, would you kill yourself?
Pizza Peter, are you on drugs?  Biden is horrible and going downhill fast!
Please go put out some Biden yard signs. I think old Sleepy Joe said that exact same sentence during his on-line rally this week. The one that had the 126 viewers.....

Did anyone else notice the subtle reframing by the journalist likely based on Biden team background spin that when Biden earlier said he’d taken lots of competency tests he meant he took competency tests by engaging with media &amp; such? Eliminates the show us the results problem.
Many people are saying most Task Force members and White House staff will vote by mail for Joe Biden. Yo!  Semite!
No. With Biden to give his speech from Delaware, Trump following suit and abandoning his convention too would make him lose the initiative and may portray him as cowardly.
I mean man idk what option we really have. Lol but I know what I’m getting with Trump at least. Biden could literacy be a turn for the absolute worst. Lol
Yeah but THIS is the guy you want as president over Trump? Lmao dude looks like he’s in outer space at all times. I’m not saying Trump is the best person in the world but I do not wanna see what the US would look like with Biden as pres.

BIG Problem. Would they help someone with a Biden sign on their house or car? This is BULLSHIT.
There are other US senators who would say it’s absolutely not a coup. You wouldn’t believe them, so not sure why you’re expecting me to take Sen. Murphy’s off-hand mid-thread remark as some sort of bombshell. The Senator you’re putting up on a pedestal endorsed Biden, by the way.
Biden agreed to 3 debates.
After watching this disastrous Trump interview, Trump should be the one who should be afraid of the debates; Biden is going to chew him out. #TrumpIsNotWell
If Biden picks Karen Bass as his VP, I'm throwing my hands in the air.

If Harris is chosen to be VP on Biden's ticket, she will get constantly badgered by Trump. She'll be able to chew up Pence in the VP debate and he won't know what hit him. Trump and Pence are so stupid that they deserve all the criticism they can get.
We know dip shit. 160,000 dead and GOP wants to talk 2016 election. Biden wins by 15%. Keep talking 2016 please.
You’re better than that...  he’s quoting someone obviously......
Mr. President, how do you know your numbers vs Mr. Biden’s? Massive = ?. Honestly very frustrating when people just toss out numbers.. Covid is a great example. If you can’t provide qualified numbers, how can we trust any of your numbers?
I've got a surprising number of Biden signs in my neighborhood but I honestly don't know the split in virtue signaling/actual support. A few have been up since the primary but most are recent additions.

Coronavirus Concern Among Democrats Drives Lead For Biden In Ohio
Really, you don’t think Trump is a thread to democracy? Are you living under a rock? The only reason all reasonable and principled Republicans are supporting and voting for Biden is not  because they suddenly turned into Dems but because they see the existential threat!
Biden you need to get out of your basement and start using your own words. You keep repeating others. Maybe because you are not well. Why do you want to destroy our great country. AOC will control you along with her socialist partners. Shame on you.
Perhaps the average Biden supporter thinks that standing looking like a dork, holding a stupid sign, is not a terribly useful thing to do? But whatever turns you on.
I live in Columbus Oh. There are lots of Biden signs in yards in my neighborhood 😕 we MUST get out and vote in person! Don’t assume anything!
Don't forget that we can flip Florida. Trump will need those seniors to help win; he's losing their support in that state. We need  leadership right now! Biden is the right person to lead us out of this mess that Trump made. #TrumpIsLosing
This should hang in the Biden White House as the Trump Portrait!

KAMALA HARRIS FOR VP. WINNING TICKET.
Did the same thing in the last election a cop out if he loses, I hope Biden doesn't win though like I didn't want Hilary to win
So true. AOC will control Biden.
Kristy was correct. Biden’s socialist hate America and want to destroy her. That is a true fact. AOC and her evil partners want to destroy America. That lady is EVIL.
Let’s assume you’re right and they are the lesser of two evils. Unless you like parades with goose-stepping, heil signing soldiers down Pennsylvania Ave, you better vote for Biden.
Showing Joe Biden can’t put two sentences together is enough to win, MAGA supporters warn Ohioans.
Like Hidin Biden is fit for the job!!!!  You guys make me laugh!  TRUMP 2020
I genuinely hate when politicians (and this is true of both Trump and Biden) attempt to pander to entire states by claiming some form of false heritage. I have connections to three states (OH, TN, SD) and never will I deign to appropriate ties to any other state.
Well,  1. *judgment 2. Periods go “.”, not “ .” 3. Considering Politico leaked a premature running mate bio on her and Biden’s conference notes show he means to explicitly praise her, it’s pretty obvious he (or his team) has made up their minds. It will be Harris.
Maybe you don’t know what the other 49 states feel about your governor. But that aside adding a white male after Biden said on a national debate his VP would be a woman would be a bad way to win.
It is clear that whoever his VP is, is likely to be the Dem candidate on four years time, given Biden's age. That is why the right is working so hard to get Harris passed over, since she terrifies and destroys them. That should be enough, in and of itself, for her to be the one.
Absolutely. "Debates" recently are simply posed theatre, made for TV networks dominated by their anchors. Nothing of substance comes out of them. Biden is doing fine by just letting Trump continue to make a fool of himself. Why change now?
And before you come at me with Trump is corrupt, Trump is a dictator, Trump is whatever. Save it because I didn’t vote for him four years ago and I probably won’t vote for him now. However based upon what he is currently saying, I most certainly won’t vote for Joe Biden!
You have no chance Hidin Biden...... Trump 2020.  #Landslide2020
Trump only more to lose. Biden has nothing to win.

Does it mean Joe Biden?
Told someone I wonder how long it takes for someone to accuse me of racism. Listen, do me a favor and keep your thoughts on my character to yourself. You don’t know me one bit, Sam. If you think calling out Biden’s racism is racist, idk what to tell ya.
The trumpies real made in these comments. They immediately defended themselves and attacked you over a joke. They immediately jumped to assuming ur voting for Biden (which is none of their business) and got hostile 🙄
Trump is right when he says this election is rigged and his party is trying to rig it. Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden.
Who wrote that for Biden?
Thanks bro I’m just tired of being called racist like I literally was a liberal democrat (still pretty liberal) and a few weeks ago decided I’d rather have Trump than Biden. I wanted Bernie personally but he’s not in discussion anymore. I hate both parties now. I ❤️ populism tho
I respect your views, sir. You probably calling me a racist bigot behind ur screen for supporting trump &gt; Biden but I promise you I’m not. I care. I hope u can respect my views as well. Hv a good day man
Well ~90% released were black Americans who was out in there probably from Biden’s terrible crime bills.
I’m willing to bet u didn’t know Joe Biden owns an island within seeing distance of EPSTEINS ISLAND..
You too miss. I’m sorry if I come across badly being agaisnt Biden but 1 day i hope you’ll see I care about issues in the black community sincerely and genuinely. I am even mulling starting an organization with a few of my black friends to discuss civil rights issues.
👎 i listen and speak facts. Joe Biden has been terrible for black people since he got into politics
Biden is a 78 year old loser who has been in politics for 40 years and now says he’ll be savior and fix all issues he helped create/exploit. I’m tired of this crap.
GOP is definitely worse. I agree. I’m not even republican idk why people attacking me so hard for calling out Biden’s racist past - and present
Don, a humans thoughts and mind aren’t determined by their skin color. Recent poll has roughly 28% black Americans identified as conservative while less i think like 26% as liberal. Black people aren’t monolithic like Biden wants to think. They just don’t hv another viable option
Bro im getting hated on so hard for just telling them what Biden has said and done. But idc cuz I’m not here for them I’m here for people who are afraid to speak out agaisnt biden but know the harm he’s done.
Uh just cause Kamala is black doesn’t mean she’d get black vote. Again: black People think with brain not their skin color. Black People are NOT monolithic even tho biden thinks both of those things are true.
Who cares my skin color, I listen to black people my age group and so many know Biden sucks. It doesn’t take lots of research to look up his record.
Those are legit facts. What did I say was false? Trump gave black Americans long-term HBCU funding lowest unemployment, wage growth first time in over decade, criminal justice reform, opportunity zones to spur growth in community. And all Biden did was say I’m a democrat I love u
Yessir. And I enjoy learning more from many of their different perspectives. Don’t forget: black people think with their brain, not skin color. Sadly Biden thinks black People are monolithic and owe Biden their vote.
Biden was terrible in polls when he ran for president but Obama knew it was smart to pick him. Biden hurt black community in crime bills and now look who’s cleaning up Biden’s mess: trump: signing criminal justice reform.
I don’t watch Fox News nor do I care about them. I speak what Biden himself said and make own conclusion. Biden only helped Obama get the white racist voters afraid of black president. Obama knee he was smart in picking him. Look at his past record on race... disturbing
Did Biden write that for you? Holy nonsense word salad.
Donald Trump doesn't have a religious bone in his body  Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America &amp; save America
Joe Biden has hurt black Americans he whole career. From fighting against integration in schools to locking up fathers and youth. And now says they ain’t black if they don’t vote for him. He’s a joke
Just because you’re democrat, doesn’t mean you’re immune to being a racist.   Can we normalize that reality finally ?? Plenty of racist democrats out in America.   Biden says you “ain’t black” if u don’t vote for me and now “African American community isn’t diverse”   #RacistJoe
Assuming Biden wins and only serves 1 term, which is expected, then I believe that 2024 is primed to be an election about structural change.  This wasn’t that election.  This was the hold off fascism election. Sad.
Biden literally said if you don’t vote for me you’re not black. Reading comprehension lagging behind, eh  ??
Yes they all suck.  But Trump is a unique authoritarian threat.  The guardrails are breaking down.  So yes, unfortunately voting for Biden is just getting us back to the same old corruption we’re more comfortable with.  From there the fight continues.
if Joe Biden is a Catholic then why is he PRO CHOICE?!? SHAMEFUL!?! He should be excommunicated!!! Just like  !!!!!

Lol he said unlike black community Latino community is diverse  So is black community not diverse?  Racist Biden needs to stop viewing black people as monolithic. Black people are unique, different, and NOT monolithic.   Just like when he said you ain’t black, this is dispicable.
Protesting in favor of the Black Lives Matter should never involve rioting and looting.  If you hate President Donald Trump, then vote for former Vice President Joe Biden less than 100 days frpm now in the November USA Presidential Elections.
Biden isn’t even in executive power... easy to be on outside and criticize.   Biden playing the “I’d do such a better job” even though if he was president we wouldn’t have banned travel from China and Europe so early which saved SOOO many lives.   But hey he’d do a better job 👍🏼
So we just ignore that Biden was against a travel ban and isn’t even in executive power to make decisions to judge what he’d do?? Easy to play the “I’d do such a better job” when on the outside of one of the most unprecedented virus crisis in America.
Joe Biden won’t:   ❌bring back manufacturing jobs ❌Have a strong economic recovery ❌Be tough on China ❌Try to curb illegal immigration  ❌Defend religious liberties (Supreme Court pick)
One day, Democrats are going to admit that they were lying their asses off about Biden’s  health. I guarantee you that the answer and the excuse will be: yes, it was awful, but we couldn’t tell you because it was a matter of us wanting to defeat Trump in 2020.   Fixed it for ya !

Can someone please tell him Biden is not “hiring” a Vice President but inviting her to be nominated. So the laws don’t apply. This is stupid even by his standards.
B  Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America vote blue up and down the ballot  and make sure the Federal officers are knocking on the white House door on January 20
FBI raiding a Ukranian owned Bank tied to Biden and his Son here in cleveland as we speak
Jim Jordan is a disgrace to Ohio. He is a bully and a know-nothing. There are good, solid people here. This state has been hit very hard over the years and has not recovered. But with a Biden presidency, we just might be able to find our way forward.
If Biden's people pick her,  that clip just might be a commercial for Trump  #SilentMajority
Excellent, Biden can go be President of the independent Republic of California! Glad to get that drag off our economy!
This country will collapse with another 4 years of this chaotic unstable lunatic as president. Folks Trump is not a option as president. Vote Biden and vote blue across the board. The only republican with any morals and integer is Mitt Romney. The rest are not worth a damn.
I agree with that.  But if Michelle Hussein is Biden's VP it would be just a matter of months before Michelle (Barack) becomes president
Can someone suggest to Biden to insist on behavioral requirements that they won’t accept?  Like standing in one place?
So the only sane people are putting faith into a man who mental capabilities are clearly declining and you don’t want a politician but Biden is a career politician. Ai yai yai. 🙄🤦‍♀️
Right, BIDEN really loves his base.  He just doesn't know who they are, and really doesn't care! Never has.
Also I meant non-Americans on both tracks with that trolly problem. As in, I believe the Biden option results in less pain around the board world wide.
And before you say anything about Biden's record, I'm willing to bet Trump, ESPECIALLY Trump with these neocons advising him, would have made all, if not worse foreign policy decisions in the past than Biden. All his grandstanding about these forever wars is clearly paper thin
Yeah Trump is so much better than Biden on interventionism that's why he's not fulfilled any of his foreign policy promises and has the same Bush admin people in foreign policy roles and the one time where he actually did reduce troops significantly he killed more people.
Don't be surprised when President AOC passes only slightly more left policy than Biden would but years after the fact and in a way more damaged America and planet. But I'm happy that you feel good about yourself backing Hawkins or not voting or whatever.
Biden doesn’t get to decide if he debates Trump the DNC will decide
I get that. I just think that the ultimate loss of freedom is death, so we should reduce that as much as possible, which a ban does. Anyway, my point is that Biden has big problems, but largely because he has allied with the right wing. The solution is to pull him left I'd say
I call BS. I have seen 2 Biden signs....
I agree. But the thing is, all of the big groups trying to roll back those bad policies of the 90s think that they have better chance of getting reform if they are in Biden's ear than Trump's. The only thing he's gotten done is the First Step Act which was good but nothing since
Some parts of the bill were actually not bad, I give Biden credit for the Violence Against Women Act which was in the bill, and a lot of Democrats cite that and the now expired Assault Weapons Ban (I'm sure you disagree with it, I know) as why they voted yes. But as a whole bad
This is probably the worst offending bill. When Biden says "Biden-Hatch" he refers to the Republican Orrin Hatch who also helped write the bill. *Some* Republicans actually opposed because it was "too weak"! The only people right about it were on the left
Yes, random comments thrown around without any context don't convince anyone. How about you discuss the ACTUAL racism in Biden's past, not his words, his actions, when he many times joined with Republicans to make the US the incarceration capital of the world.
I think you can disagree with Biden and point out his race problem WITHOUT mischaracterizing his record or words.
Haha yes I agree, but to be clear, he used it to point out how someone else was racist. I don't need Biden's words to know he has a race issue. Just look at his actions. Him, his centrist democrat friends like Clinton and the GOP are responsible for the terrible 90s crime bills
Right, im saying I'm not happy its biden but I will 100 percent vote for him.
Like objectively, Biden wanted to use housing policy to end segregation. His opposition to busing was bad, but that's the reality of the situation. I don't see how you can reasonably argue any other way.
I'm not doubting he said! I'm just pointing out your characterization is missing the actual context behind it. Similarly, Biden was literally quoting someone else when he said the n-word. Kinda bad but have you ever had to read a racist character's lines outloud in school?
Well I mean the circumstances now are very clearly very different now. But I mean generally yeah you're not wrong. But at least Biden is openly advocating big tax increases on the rich, unlike Obama in 08.
Yes, I know, and that's bad! But he said in that in the context of preferring using housing to end segregation rather than busing.
Can we start treating him like a ailing senior citizen? That goes for Biden too. I don't want a 78 year old president.
... interpretation of the interstate commerce clause. And even if the Supreme Court will always strike those progressive things down, they why not vote for Biden to get more moderate stuff done? Unless you're just giving up on electorialism entirely?
Know how I know Biden is gonna win? Shit like this.
To be clear, yeah I really wish Biden had something like a federal jobs guarentee (I'm assuming that's what you're implying a more left candidate would have) but it's clear that Biden is at least more willing to use the federal government for public works like the 09 stimulus.
He and Obama had two big disasters:   Going into Lybia and destroying the place creating literal slavery now in that country due to Obama/Biden invasion  Pulling troops out of Iraq on a timetable causing Caliphate to take over territory that we then had to go in to take back
Wise man, otherwise known as history, says don’t divert resources from Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to chase Texas. #TheMoreYouKnow
Biden didn’t want to restrict travel from China. Trump was in the unpopular opinion when he banned entry from China and Europe. Thanks Trump ‼️ Leadership is doing the unpopular. Biden is a joke and wouldn’t have done better
Also idk why you think assuming my circustances and thinking I personally gain from voting for Biden would change my or anyone's mind. I'd suggest you watch "I Hate Monday's" my Innuendo Studios, it is very good and touches on this stuff. Not voting Biden FEELS good, but it isn't
Biden empowered whites by fighting against busing to integrate whites and blacks together in schools. Fuck Joe Biden &amp; his fake bullshit that comes out of his mouth. He’s a fraud, lies to us all with his bs “let’s unite” when he fought for 40 years destroying black community.
What that Joe Biden has been in politics in DC for 40 years and needs to step down. I had enough of these crooks getting rich off being politicians and acting like they care about me when in fact they’ll say whatver their donors and special interests tell them to say.
Believe it or not this exists.   For people who don't believe in full police abolition (most of the country and most people who would actually get Biden in office) this seems like a reasonable way to reform (along with other criminal justice stuff)
I don't wanna pretend they appointed perfect leftists but Biden's appointees would absolutely be a huge improvement. A Democrat led NLRB is the only hope for card check in this country.
Okay the argument has moved elsewhere but I'd like to point out that Obama's NLRB and SCOTUS appointees ruled in favor of working people the vast majority of time. Biden is maybe a little right of Obama but not enough to make a difference in this context.
If we are viewing this election through a consequentalist damage reduction lense, which we should, the best option is vote Biden. And btw, "teaching the DNC a lesson" or whatever ain't gonna work either, the last times th Democrats lost elections badly all they did was move right
In addition to that, there is a real chance that a Biden presidency could get things done like a public option or carbon dividend or cuts to fossil fuel subsidies which, while certainly not perfect, are absolutely improvements over the current state of affairs
Biden will be putting people on the NLRB and SCOTUS who will rule in a much more progressive way than Trumps appointees.
Biden could and likely will (if there's a Dem Congress) set up a paid family leave program. It can be put in budget reconciliation bill only requiring 51 votes. That's only one example but absolutely an area of improvement that a Trump presidency would never ever touch
If we were dealing only with an actual debate, rhetoric, knowledge of issues, and critical thinking, Biden would tear Trump a new asshole.  But Trump lies, equivocates and basically makes shit up, and there  are people who are too stupid to realize that.
Okay so I understand being bullish on Biden but that is complete BS. If Trump supporters were lying why would the national polling average be really close in 2016? Did the Trump supporters just magically know when they were only being polled by state?
If I'm Biden, I would not debate Trump at all. Why give Trump a stage for his lies, his equivocations, and his dubious "Facts" and "hoaxes"?  Biden would be wasting his time.
I know people who truly think that Joe Biden is not mentally sound. I wanna see them debate to show that he is fine. I would also enjoy seeing Donny get trounced.
Oh? Will Biden know where to find the White House?
The progressive woman is now literally shilling for fucking Joe Biden lol
"So basically we unskew the polls, do some math, check the crucial Waukesha County, look at trends, and keep in mind Biden has to win the popular vote by 69 trillion votes in order to win the electoral college" is basically what that is
If Biden knew how to fix America, why didn’t he tell Obama?
Told ya folks. Trump isn’t losing. He is going to win because he has a proven record on building up the US economy to great and historic levels
Your campaign needs to run campaign ads on AFFH. Liberals and moderates need to know that if they vote for Joe Biden, what exactly that entails. For those who live in the suburbs, their liberty and their private property rights are heavily at stake come this election.
the scariest time for america will be nov. 4 (after biden wins) through inauguration day. thats when trump will do the most damage. he wont go quietly and he will trash the white house, the capitol, the constitution, the democracy. he will set it all on fire!
“Will take the truth”. Joe Biden has been a liar his entire career...
I’m voting for Biden no matter who the VP is, but Dems always do this. They look so petty. It’s infuriating.
You know you are going to make it easy for Trump to get reelected if you don't stop your bullshit you are all falling for Trump &amp; Russia freedom caucus propaganda stop being stupid &amp; stay United vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States up and down the ballot
KEEP THE FAITH ‼️‼️  HOLD ONTO HOPE ‼️‼️  WE WON’T ALLOW A BIDEN PRESIDENCY  Joe Biden lead in battleground states have dwindled since the past two weeks.   Trump only down +2 points in Pennsylvania ‼️‼️  #trump #biden
The right doesn’t have a monopoly on what it means to be an American.  Nor do soldiers.  Thank you for your service. It gives me the freedom to support Joe Biden and speak against systematic racism.
Romney is a joke. Typical establishment who will flip flop on issues for votes. No wonder he’ll endorse Biden who does the same.
Wow two establishment politicians who flip flop on issues for votes...    Seems reasonable that Romney would endorse Biden.
Joe Biden, brainless zombie for president.
(Two choices* ) Continued* the person who will best fit my agenda as an Americans which is to have less government, keep out socialism, protect religious liberty and not let us go into foreign wars. Trump actions trump Biden’s past record/current agenda for me on those issues
This Jo Jorgensen chick is the only sane person on the 2020 ballot lol fuck Biden and enough trump.
I know Biden is more popular than Clinton. I think Trump can win but it will take higher voter registration for him
Just because Dr Immanuel wouldn't let Biden sniff her hair
Also Trump dated a black person so he’s not? You can’t use the “I have black friends” card to prove someone ain’t racist. Biden has racist tendencies.
Biden was chosen to get the racist democrats. No way Obama wins if he picks a black VP because racists would freak out.
2021 will be our best financial year, because Joe Biden will be president
Imagine fighting agaisnt lntegration of busing. Busing affected schools you go to. Biden was afraid of his children growing in a “racial Jungle” (his words) and opposed busing. He’s a racist joke.
And Biden makes errors too. Pobody’s Nerfect!
91% freed by the First Step Act passed by Trump were black Americans. Many who were in there due to mass incarceration caused by Biden’s crime bills.
You don’t know anything about me but that I hate Biden and will rather vote for trump. Don’t speak for my character, sir.
If trump is racist then Biden is
If elected he will be a one term. Have two years to pass stuff, gop takes over Congress and then nothing gets done because Biden’s proposals are so left.   You trust Biden negotiating with countries like North Korea and traveling on plane constantly? And making speeches? LOL
I think for myself. I research. Biden is a FRAUD! Been in politcis for 40 years. He doesn’t believe half the shot he’s running on. He just needs to do it for votes! #NeverBiden my generation WILL NOT vote for him
Lol it only takes a little research to see how what my generation is fighting against is what Biden supported and helped create. fact is, he caused the mass incarceration of black people. #FuckBiden
Joe Biden has been in politics since the 70’s but HEY.. he’ll fix the issues THIS TIME!   Helped cause mass incarceration of black people  Helped kill Manufacturing sector  Voted for Iraq war and as VP, pulled troops out which caused Isis to take over territory  WHATA GENIUS ‼️‼️
That’s why I vote Trump because Biden has a failed record on foreign policy and helping strip working class of good-paying manufacturing jobs. Biden has been in politics since the 70’s (when he defended segregation). It’s time for him to step down from politics.
He actually has no bearing on us supporters of #maga - he did his 8 years. I even voted for him. Id rather vote for a pile of dog poop then biden. Your party sucks ass with all the extreme lefties and riots.
Exactly. Trump has been a disaster for America. His leadership regarding Covid has been non-existent. He is a childish habitual liar who has created division and hate at unprecedented levels in this country. Biden is not Trump. He’s a leader. That’s plenty of reason to vote Biden
...done with budget reconciliation, just really only economic and budgetary things though, not new states and regulatory reform, but really the biggest things on Biden's platform could still be done. And honestly I'd watch Manchin's floor speeches in favor of the filibuster to...
We have literally the two worst candidates for President. Trump and Biden. As worst as 2016. I'm so done with politics.
Don’t worry Joe Biden will fix everything, just ask him!
has done more in three years then Joe Biden has done in 47. #Election2020
Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United states of America &amp; Kick Donald Trump all the way to Russia
Joe Biden takes black vote for granted.   Trump has tried to earn it with ACTION.   Biden said “you ain’t black” if you vote Trump.   I say prove him wrong and vote Trump who has proven record that helped black community. He even banned chokehold and encouraged police reform.
Biden voted for Iraq war that made youth like me go over and die in a place we should never have been. Then he and Obama pulled troops out and caused Caliphate to take over land. Leading to more troops having to go over there. Trump defeated caliphate and pulled out troops.All brought to you from Biden’s Basement

The truth in this text is stunning...this election, to me, is whether you're a true American patriot (Biden) or not (Trump)... it's really that simple...
last night I dreamt Joe Biden and the Dems said fuck it and made Mayor Pete VP
said some prayers for you before going to bed last night.  Heard big bad Joe Biden was out to put a hurtin' on you and the Bible.  Hope you're okay big guy.
Stone cold truth...Biden certainly isn't my top choice, but, all things considered, he's a decent man, and he'll be a safe bridge towards the hope we can fix what Trumpism has destroyed in this country... and no mistake, there's a lot to fix...Biden will try...

Dude, Biden is right! You don’t know anything about the African American or Latino community. Your whiteness is showing. 🙄
This is nothing but wypipo trying to convince black people of something wrong. Dude, Biden’s right. When we say Af Am, we are talking about one group with very similar experiences. When we say Latino, that includes, Cubans, Mexicans, Puerto Rican’s, etc. Nothing wrong with this.
If you think these riots are about black people, you have been misinformed. This has nothing to do about racial injustice or Joe Biden would not be the Democratic Party’s nominee. Calling me childish names and hurling insults only proves you are already aware of that fact.

Biden doesn't just have to choose a vice president. He's going to have to go in with an army with a strategic plan to try to fix all that Trump has broken plus take care of the country embroiled in an epic crisis. Few have had to do what he's about to do
I see it too:  Chicken to debate Trump.  Catty when talking to Black journalists, and  An old dog who knows no new tricks  #Biden

Biden Lashes Out at African American Reporter
Hulu has been showing me anti-Biden ads. Except, they make Biden sound *so* much better than he actually is. Converted by the far left? Gonna raise taxes and expect people  to help pay to support our society?  It's easier to vote for their fiction, than Biden's reality.
Biden doesn’t need to do much since Trump is doing a great job self destructing and sabotaging his own re-election. Biden can sit back and drink a cocktail.
All Biden has to do is stay still, let his campaign team handle his Twitter, and not be a radical. For the most part, he has done this, which is why Biden is likely going to win.
Many of these possible voters are pro-police, pro-2nd Amendment. Yet one or two will vote Biden because they view Trump’s decision to rail against mail in ballots as voter suppression.
Biden just **can't** pick Susan Rice as his VP. The GOP will run ENDLESS ads with Bengazi, Bengazi, Bengazi if he does.

I *can* accept the *possibility* of a better *long term* under Trump than Biden, *however* the scenario is exceedingly unlikely, and try as you might it boils down to the sheer fact that you want to claim that an unforeseen amount of harm will suddenly occur without backing it up
Gives 2 options. 1 option is Trump wins and Democrats slow track justices through. This is unlikely, because Democrats already fast tracked prior appointments, but let's give the good old democrats the benefit of the doubt. 2 is they track Biden justices, which benefit the left
Trump is a pedophile.  So is Biden, and Clinton(s), and there is some unsettling evidence that Obama is in the club as well.
If we want to talk about long term damage, we extrapolate far beyond the presidency and congress, and into the actual policy. Trump will do more actual, long term, policy damage in 4 years than Biden will.
We are redistricting in 2021. That is, the census data that is used to rig elections comes in this year, and is utilized by the next congress to determine the next 10 years of electoralism. Long term, having Trump in that process is much worse than even an incumbent Biden.
Yeah, except my argument wasn't Trump would destroy the republic but that he would fuck trans people (and we can add DACA and immigrants)  give tax breaks and raise military spending more and congress wouldn't do dick about that. Thus, biden is prederable.
Incumbency is the only reason I have a sneaking suspicion Biden is going to fail.
Anyone can be primaried, and Biden isn't going to be alive in 2024 lmao the dude is 77 years old and has a family history of cancer, neurological trauma and was told years ago he'd die campaigning for president. He wouldn't even leave his basement before Covid.
Then it's your mistake to have. Ethnic minorities and LGBTQIA+ suffer under authoritarianism. Hence the purpose of removing a blatant authoritarian like Trump, and the Biden campaign throws a small bone to the classism fight via minimum wage. This whole argument has been me 1/2
Joe Biden's unity plan after election is going to be to refuse prosecuting Trump officials who explicitly broke the law, setting a precedent similar to when Obama let war criminals off the hook.
You tell me Biden can't change those things, I agree with you and treat you like you're stupid because of course there's no guarantee Biden does anything differently, but at least it's the offer. You then reiterate you think congress is a good check on Trump.
You bafflingly respond by saying that congress is a check on Trump and that Biden and Trump are the same; explain how they're different?  I literally point to Biden's stance on minimum wage, Trump's excessive tax cuts, and Trump's treatment of trans people.
Your response? I'm saying Biden will be something he isn't.  I say that's not a proper representation of what I'm arguing, I agree with you that Biden  sucks, but I can rationally debate people who aren't panicked about Trump.
You open: Trump winning with a Democrat senate is preferable.  I respond that the conditions for another left populist will exist under a Biden presidency, same as a right populist.

Maybe he knows the inevitable will happen. Plus when he does lose (which he will) he will probably be in the Biden administration.

I can't argue that Biden is a great choice for POTUS. But good God damn on a biscuit do I not have energy for 4 more years of GOP. I have energy to fight Democrats for days.
And the DNC pr firms (AKA the MSM) are obediently starting the push to cancel the debates. There is no way Biden is fit to debate....and thus not fit to be president either.

For a man who hates and hurts God. That was said by the President.  Biden is Catholic, like most of Congress, so Catholics hates and hurts good? What test do you have to pass to please you?
I’m so over the VP discourse. Biden should pick whoever he thinks would be his best governing partner.  Do I want it to be a strong progressive? Absolutely.   Will I be annoyed if he picked a moderate who shares his beliefs? Probably so.   Will it matter in the long run? No.
There is no "incompetence" involved. The media is making it look that way with their breathless speculation but that's not on Biden. He's doing precisely what is always done.
Often true. McCain announced Palin on Labor Day weekend eve, just before the convention. Obama announced Biden on August 22, 2008; convention started on August 25. Others have been earlier. Kerry announced Edwards 4th of July weekend. It varies.
I don't agree it was "botched." Biden hasn't done anything. different from any previous candidate. It's just that the media has made this into a beauty pageant because I guess Trump's daily degradations aren't newsy enough.

I think he's confusing the rapture with Joe Biden. And personally I'd like to see Trump raptured.
While I believe Biden to be quite fit, I find it hard to believe that he can “hurt God.” Nor do I believe he has the super-powers necessary to “hurt energy.” Also, I may be wrong, but I believe Biden lacks the time-traveling, editorial powers of one who could “hurt the Bible.”
Trump is in Cleveland. Just spoke at Burke Lakefront Airport. Once again, he said Biden is against religion and the Bible. How ridiculous! The speech was filled with lies, misinformation and vague bragging.
Ur a dumbass voting for Trump or Biden.

I think Biden’s strategy to yield the stage to Trump is brilliant. He doesn’t need to say a word. He’s letting us all sit back and watch Trump in all his maniacal glory. The truth will set us free. #ByeDon2020
Gm, your polls assume that Black folks will vote for Biden. Thats not a good assumption 🤔
I doubt that, nothing from truth comes from Biden's mouth. Another reason to put up or shut up when it comes to putting black folks in jail. But, wait america what about those murdering cops ?
President Obama deported my husband. Would a “President Biden” bring him home?
if Biden wins 🙅🏻‍♀️😆 we’re phuc’d! We need to get out &amp; vote for  This election is more important than any other b4 it! The Dems will DESTROY our country: disband police🤬, higher taxes🤬, teach Islam in schools 🤬, the list goes on! #KAG2020
And Joe Biden is your answer??????......im not a fan of either but to say Trump is losing it when Joe is OBVIOUSLY suffering from some sort of mind illness is disingenuous man.
Joe Biden leading President Trump in swing state polls:  via
We have 328,000,000 people living in the United States. How is it that Donald Trump and Joe Biden are the top two candidates available to run our country? These are the top two turds on the pile of 328,000,000 people? We're being fucked, big time!
Paging John Kasich.  John Kasich you're needed at the Ohio Democratic Party.  John. Kasich.   Former Governor of Ohio. Republican. Anti-choice. Joe Biden's BFF.  The Democrats need your help. Please report for duty.
Let's talk about your views, Trump, Biden, and getting to Utopia....
Little boys are hearing their dads say horrible things about all of these women and the effects will last a lifetime. A stronger candidate would be out in front of it (remember McCain re: attacks on Obama?). Biden is not that candidate. He'll never stand up for women.
We need to band together &amp; we need to make sure we get our butts to the polls on Election Day #VoteInPerson #AllLivesMatter A vote for Biden is a vote for communism! Higher taxes, he’ll disband the police, implement Islam education in our schools, etc. #KAG #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
Joe Biden is basically irrelevant.. which sounds insane.. but it’s still pretty much true...
Don’t let Biden have an ear piece during the debate
Everyone: Kamala Harris is too ambitious to be Vice President. She'll run for president again.  Also everyone: We need the best possible running mate for former Vice President Joe Biden!
Joe Biden doesn’t even know where joe Biden is
Talking about Biden ,Clinton,Obama and other liberrals criminals. ? Good job camrade!!!!
2\ An expert on fighting pandemics like the coronavirus who wants what Biden wants on economics, like a public option, whose a strong personality -- combative -- but also very qualified to be president would work well.  I can't come up with a name here.
1\ In a conservative woman-hater country like the US, its hard to imagine that Biden wont lose a small share of his big lead after he names his VP, regardless of how competently he chooses.  Choosing a Medicare for All democrat could be fatal, leading AT MINIMUM to a GOP Senate.
If he loses, which he won't by the way,he would at least concede the loss unlike demoncrats that can't accept the will of the people. Anyone voting for Biden clearly hates America and should get to the nearest airport and leave immediately.
1\ This is like 2008 all over again, as I constantly have to tell GOP voters  "If Biden captures 270 or more electoral votes then he's our next president."  Like in 2008 they say  "We'll see."  And like in 2008 I say  "There's no 'we'll see' about it, you fucking traitor."
If Biden doesn’t win ... maybe I will leave this country
Hi Karine. Would you please ask VP Biden to announce his choice for VP now, please? James would love it.✌🏼
I can think of 2 possibilities:  1) Its 2008 again and they're going to dig Biden the deepest hole, then obstruct obstruct obstruct while also constantly complaining about the economy they're sabotaging.  2) A November Surprise: They won't let democrats vote in swing states.
If Biden flips MI, PA and WI, it's game over. He could even afford to lose NV in that case. Everything else is gravy.
Not "concerning" at all to anyone w/ even a superficial knowledge of history. Obama announced Biden's pick in late August &amp; McCain announced Palin just before Labor Day.
Only she never "attacked" Biden. She asked a valid question, he bungled the answer &amp; the entire "protect white men" army in the media sprang into action to blame HER. Because ALWAYS blame the woman — especially the black woman. Never blame the man.
Let's talk about Biden's possible foreign policy....
Kamala has won statewide ad AG and Senate. Plus VP will be groomed for President.Biden will be 81 in 2024
Tell me Patriots 🇺🇸  Does anybody besides me   think Biden is not only hiding  himself in the basement, but  but his pick Michelle so they  don’t have to hit the   campaign trail!!!!!!
What the fuck, dude????? Biden has nothing, nada to do with this.....
"Insulting" is the exact word. As top people in the Bernie campaign said "We did our best" &amp; got behind Biden, she remained a divisive outlier &amp; butt of mockery. To propose Biden choose for his partner/teammate someone who attacked him &amp; called him "shit" is just ... nuts.
This goes beyond that though.This is insane. Biden has a long list of women who are qualified, widely respected &amp; supportive of him. He should choose a former short-term state senator who has constantly dissed him, is incredible divisive &amp; called him "shit"? Please.
She has made it clear she has nothing but contempt for Biden &amp; you have the temerity to suggest SHE should be his partner &amp; teammate? Laughable. &amp; she's not qualified, having been a state senator for a 6 yrs — period.
Excuse me, but was your Twitter hijacked? This is crazy. She's a divisive loudmouth who's probably the most disliked Bernie Bro due to her failure to accept the voter choice now in TWO elections. She has just called Biden "shit" &amp; only rejected Hillary on national TV.
This is completely laughable. She is functionally not even a Democrat anymore; she has openly called Biden "shit." &amp; he should just hand HER his presidency on a silver platter? Please. Also, she's not remotely qualified &amp; has a dubious past as a corporate GOP stooge in Cleveland.
Sorry, no. Biden is the winner. He retires no permission or buy-in from Bernie Sanders to pick his own teammate. And the "anyone but Harris movement" seems bitter and misogynist: a desperate desire to have a "lesser" woman who won't take any of the shine.
Im unenthusiastic about Joe Biden but enthused about getting rid of Trump. I would vote for a Big Mac that Trump choked on.
My biggest worry about President Joe Biden's first days is that he pulls a Gerald Ford maneuver and pardons Donald Trump like Ford did Nixon, in the interest of faux "unity."
Biden, but Kanye primaried VP Harris on a "not enough albums sold" platform and won 🤷‍♂️  2024, am I right?
Interesting perspective. “Trump is a circus clown,” &amp; Biden should not enter the ring (aka, the debate stage). What if ⁦ reframes it entirely, names it for what it is, an unethical “circus,” &amp; instead comes in w/ his own rules for the game?
Anyone who thinks Joe Biden is a Socialist is using terms he doesn't understand
I don’t care if Biden doesn’t speak another’s word. I’m all in for Biden!
trump is meaningless just like biden
I went to CVS a bit ago and I noticed that in some yards there were BLM and Biden for President signs. Don't they cancel each other out??If you honestly think Black lives Matter why would you continue to vote Democrat??
No the old white men Joe Biden who by the way I supported are trashing more of Sen. Harris. I don’t know why Chris Dodd is entrusted to do this and where’s Obama. Isn’t it true Sen. Harris is his friend also. Don’t think Obama people leaked Biden as not loyal enough right?
They missed the part where Biden sexually assaulted Tara Reade so....
Biden  CANNOT take Rice or Harris as HIS VP, they are TOO toxic and WE ARE TRYING TO RID THE POISON IN GOVERNMENT! Either Warren or maybe AOC   that would be a kicker!    Atlanta"NEEDS"to keep Keisha
New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Majority of Democrats want Biden to pick a Black woman for vice president  Wow so JOE BIDEN NEEDS to pick a woman!!  I think that would be a good thing but MY VOTE is NOT CONTINGENT on that!
WE THE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF ALL THE BS!               All these"BUSINESSMEN" S/B fired when Biden is elected in Nov! The GOP are acting EVIL!👿👎
Dems would rather elect Biden, regardless of his racist views than re-elect Trump, who’s never proven racism! Go figure.
Lots of people are speculating about Biden's VP pick. Its the hot media clickbait story of the hour. But, as many have pointed out, this take from Politico, which has been echoed by other publication and (mostly white male) pundits is deeply problematic &amp; offensive.
I disagree. ANY change on Trump's part would signal chao. Trading reliable white male Pence for brown, female, openly ambitious Haley would infuriate Trump's base, which is racist &amp; misogynist. This would nail Biden's reelection no matter who his VP is. Pure media fantasy.
And you know this how, sine Biden is playing his cards close to his chest?
No one cares about that shit. Given Biden's age, I'm more concerned with who you're setting up for the future. Politically she's not strong — she has no electoral experience &amp; we have no idea how she'd perform as a candidate.
I don't think anyone knows who Biden will pick &amp; the media is just throwing shit out to see what sticks. Rice is certainly credible &amp; given the nature of the campaign this year, she won't hurt it, but she would be a weak pick for the future.
How does she balance the ticket ideologically? She is probably a a tad more progressive than Biden, but Harris is one of the most progressive members of the Senate. And let's give the idea that Republicans will "use" these phony narratives — they'll invent something for anyone.
Ohio will be blue this year. Former (as of yesterday) Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder handed Ohio to Biden with his arrest last week for taking $61 million in bribes to ram through HB6, to bail out coal &amp; nuclear &amp; kill green energy. Everyone hated it! Now they're reminded!
Check out this 2020 election forecast via   #2020election Even with some states too close to call right now, Biden has Trump beaten....
Duckworth would mirror Biden's personal brand in that they're both people who have suffered great personal losses, but remain committed to and caring of other people.
How can Biden embrace them? He had Dementia
You didn't say it but you did imply it. You think Biden wont get it done. Well nothing is getting done with trump. He actually implied that the election should be "delayed"
also I'm ready to say, like Sherrod, that folks need to vote their conscious on Biden, and I know that a low-rent war hawk abuser is not as bad as a fascist serial rapist, but I'll be damned if folks ever gave Tara Reade a moment before running a bus over #MeToo
Biden Calls For Arrest Of Anarchists
Or more simply put - Biden is a prophet.
You wanna investigate Biden while trump over here thinking about postponing the election? What?!
I heard that, Biden has one foot in the grave and you have a younger woman who possibly could run the country ? Maybe ?
Joe Biden should let all these leakers go right now because they may well be like trump’s White House. I wonder if them leakers only voted for Biden? Biden/Harris is where we’re.
I think Warren was dropped from the list. I think Biden knows the reality: she's too old &amp; we'd lose her seat. That pretty much obliterates her qualifications.I wouldn’t trust Biden to do my laundry, let alone run the country.
Same ! I’m in northeastern Ohio, in the Youngstown-warren area . I see tons of trump signs but I’ve yet to see a Biden sign anywhere.
There are millions of reason why Ohio is pretty much a sure thing for President trump. If Biden wins he kill off millions of Ohio jobs, and leave the Ohio economy in dire straits. Plus he’s basically just a male Hillary. Pro globalism, anti worker, killer of the middle class.
Let’s go!!! Joe Biden is making Ohio competitive.
Clinton signed in Nafta. Obama’s actions in the Middle East destabilized the whole region and his Iran Nuclear deal gave weapons and funds to terrorists, which they used against us and our allies. Obama-Biden passed the ACA which stripped healthcare from millions of Americans.
No it’s called chess.  Now Biden will respond and commit to something he doesn’t believe.
This author did a textual analysis of Biden's interviews and created this wonderful gem... try it out!
Graham calls out Obama-era corruption, grades Joe Biden's campaign perfo...  via  this now people)
Sheeeeeeeeit!!!! Biden is a joke.  And democrats should be outraged that this fading shadow of a man is who they chose to represent the party.
But.......you did say that.  You backpedaling Biden.  Tsk tsk
I don’t think Biden has any say in anything. He’s just a puppet at this point. I don’t think he’d last a year as president. Sadly His cognitive decline is really ramping up. The fact that they even considered adding that to the platform speaks volumes.
Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden via
President trump forgot to mention that Biden is a pedophile.
Did Trump or Biden even MENTION Japan in their campaign speeches today?
He doesn’t have to get people to believe it, it’s true. He advocated for China publicly every chance he got, at the expense of America interests. There are so many juicy clips out there, of Biden praising nafta, The TTP, Stating that china’s steel dumping is good for the economy.
Wow, your clueless! Maybe you should spend some reading about how other countries feel about our election. Newflash .. they fear a Biden Presidency. The democrats created the Current Middle East crisis, Everything going on in India, Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, ect is all due to Obama.
All over the country, voters who are ready for a real leader are joining #TeamJoe. We’re in a battle for the soul of our nation, and we’re going to win.
Anyone who lives in the Midwest’s rust belt knows joe Biden is one of the biggest reasons we no longer have manufacturing as a country ! He spent his entire career shilling for China and the private Prison industry. Trump actually brought jobs back! And we know he will again.
He never hid his racism. He came from a different age where they kind of thing was acceptable. The average democrat had no idea what kind of person he was, they just figured Obama = good, so Biden = good. Now it’s coming back to bite em in the ass.
I travel a lot locally for work, and I still haven’t seen 1 Biden sign. However there are trump signs all over the place. Even televised Biden has very low turnout. People just aren’t interested. Trump breaks records with his television appearances.
I wouldn’t worry too much. Polling places refer to trumps base as “ the unreachables” most of us just don’t answer polls, so it throws everything off. They said Ohio was going Biden, but I don’t see it happening.
Biden was not a lifelong stutterer ! They just made that up to try and cover up his cognitive decline. Does he sound like a stutter to you here, way back in 1992?
Could you imagine Joe Biden, dealing with other foreign leaders? They would eat him alive ! Especially Xi Jinping.
By now most people with sense realize this virus has been overblown due to politics. No one is buying this bullshit anymore. Not even  people like you who spread it around. It’s about control and power. And keeping senile joe Biden hidden for as long as possible.
Jill Biden is covering up for Joe Biden in big way.
Me: Joe Biden offers no policy for the working class. None.                 You want to fucking argue with me, Bernie? My Boyz:  I don't think he wants to fucking argue with you,                  Julie.
Will Obama be accompanying him on stage? Or will Biden be expected to read the answers off the teleprompter himself?
Joe Biden’s #BuildBackBetter plan is an investment in America and our people. We can rebuild the American economy, lead the world in green infrastructure, and make real progress toward racial justice all at the same time.
#CouldBeALegitHeadline Trump sabotages his own re-election bid Biden wins..    With just weeks before the election, Trump fought hard to stop mail in ballots only to find out that more MAGA's use them then Democrats. GREAT thinking Mr. President or should I say EX- Mr. President
You’re really not selling me on Joe Biden here, Corn Pop.
Ditto for Joe Biden.
Joe Biden is also a pathological liar. Joe Biden, additionally, doesn’t even remember what he lied about yesterday.
Joe Biden clearly didn’t respect democracy when he pushed to hold primaries in person during the pandemic.
I canvassed for you. I donated to your campaign. I phonebanked for you. Because I believe in your POLICY. We need Medicare for All. Joe Biden offers the working class nothing! As a Christian, I cannot in good conscience vote for him, especially given his predilection for war.

My dad came over tonight &amp; was like, "Wasn't there supposed to be a debate in Cleveland? Oh. I guess Biden forgot." I'm ded.
And while Biden says he’ll create new jobs, he always fails to mentions that those would be out of state jobs.
Why go with Elizabeth Warren, when he could opt for Bernie Sanders? Bernie would score Biden way more votes than Elizabeth Warren or whichever black women he’s going to pick.
People will be with out food, a home and money. Children in need will cause Republicans supporters to turn Biden. Then they will vote them out of office. So sad it will take such tragedy for them to see the light. The Republicans do not care about the American People.
I’m so disappointed ☹️ I have been a fan of yours literally my entire life!! I can no longer support you because you lack patriotism and your support of Joe Biden is proof enough. #TrumpTrain2020
Same place as the suddenly silent “believe women” advocates after Biden was accused of rape apparently #onlyBernieisagoodman
After Biden wins....
Good luck.  Hope Biden remembers he’s running. #Trump2020
How is trump a racist? How is Biden not a racist?
Joe Biden will forever destroy the United States. He is a puppet ! Not even capable of completing a sentence without a teleprompter in front of him ! And even then it’s hard for him to get the lines right.
I do not care of Biden pick an African American for VP or if he pick Elizabeth Warren. I want the best person for the job. Our major concern is to get tRump out of office so we can have a Country to build back better. An African American woman would be a plus, but defeating
Trump’s presidency is a national humiliation. The damage he’s done to our democratic institutions will take a long time to fix.
Joe Biden thinks he's running against himself and Trump thinks he's running against a man who isn't even eligible to run again. FFS
I don’t get all this Russian fear when China is the true threat to America, and all other democratic nations. Biden is mentally weak, his decline is out there for everyone to see. Why would you want to elect someone who has to be controlled and  can’t do his job.
Not really, Everything the leftist media has reported on trump has been either an out and out lie or highly questionable at best. Trump put his foot down with Russia, China, and Iran ! Where as looking at Biden’s past all you see is a long history appeasement.
How will Biden save America? What policies has he past in his 43 years in office that you support? Nafta, TPP, 3 strikes your out laws, giving money to the taliban, or his all the years he spent advocating for China?
Oh and even joe Biden, who disagrees with trump on everything has banned his staff from using the app. What does that tell you?
If Biden wins America loses! You should really check out some foreign news stations and see what they are saying. N. Korea,Iran, China , and Russia are all salivating at the idea of a Biden Presidency. If Biden wins we get torn apart domestically and globally.
What do you mean? If Biden is elected this will occur? Or just in general right now?
It should be fairly obvious to everyone by now that “heels up Harris” is going to be chosen as Biden’s running-mate. None of the others can be taken seriously.
Maybe if Biden has strippers at his events more people would tune in!
I have recently taken Up food and grocery delivery as a side gig. I still haven’t seen a Biden sign anywhere in my part of Ohio, just trump signs and a few Bernie signs (I don’t think the progressives are going to vote Biden)
Not really. Biden advocated for and till this day praises nafta, advocated for steel dumping, and helped to push through The ACA which completely destroyed the job market here. China never had a greater ally.
Facts are facts. Joe Biden advocated for ever pro China trade deal, everything from nafta to the TPP. If he hadn’t been such a strong advocate for China America would be in a better place and China a weaker one. Now we are in a position where war with China is inevitable .
Joe Biden will not end cash bail.  It's bullshit. Supposedly, they ended cash bail in New York. That lasted, what, six weeks?
In the Rust belt we refer to joe Biden as China joe. He sold out the American people in favor of China. He’s one of the main reasons there is a rust belt.  Joe Biden would sell us out again, surrendering to China to enrich himself and his globalist allies.
My favorite is how Joe Biden and Tim Ryan were on a kick for a minute a few weeks ago about "healing the nation."
Trump can’t run on his record of failures, so he’s doing what he always does: lie.
What policies has Joe Biden written Or Co sponsored that you agree with? He’s been in office for over 45 years, surely you can find a couple?
The closest comparison to Biden would be Ronald Regan, who Unbeknownst to everyone suffered from Alzheimer’s when he was in office. However he Wasn’t nearly as far gone as Biden is. Binden constitutes a major security Risk and should be replaced.
I really thought Joe Biden would be dead by now.
Too much bothers me about Biden to support him. I think they left needs to be honest and ditch him for someone who isn’t in decline. Like just let Kamala or Bernie run.I can understand people wanting trump out of office. Happens every year. But... with Joe Biden? He’s terrible
Trust me, if Biden is elected,  then on Jan 20th, 2021 at 12:01p.m. the safeties come off and we start hitting the streets and hitting the halls of Congress demanding change.
What’s Biden sound like? A racist???
Although he's a nice guy, I don't love Vice President Biden, but I do hate, HATE, traitorous Trump.
Tf did Joe Biden say? 🤨🤢
I think the Democrats are hiding someone behind Biden. Have a great day and stay watchful. 🌹♥️
Biden is an embarrassement.
Mark Meadows tells  that voting is a privilege.  What a sack of crap.  To VOTE is YOUR right. Vote HOW you want.,by mail or at the polls.  I just got my application for ballot today and when my ballot comes in, I will be voting for Joe Biden BY MAIL.  OHIO FOR BIDEN
It's not hard. Given the level of deep-state / Trump-coup paranoia, if CNN etc announce Trump (or Biden) on Wednesday AM, reverse on Monday, Antifa and boogaloos will be having gunfights.
It is what it is. You Dear Leader can’t handle it when presented with facts. There is a reason Trump didn’t want to run against Biden. #ukrane, #ITISWHATITISBITCHES
If he's ignorant, then that makes Biden and HRC plain stupid. That's my opinion.
😆 Biden doesn’t have to do a damn thing. Trump hangs himself. From the looks at that intvw he doesn’t do well with someone with FACTS in hand. The debates will be epic. 😂
I'm afraid the Evangelical community has invested too much in politics and not enough in prayer.  I fear if Trump loses all bets are off; and it won't be because of Biden.
Not all Biden supporters are pedos, but all of them decided that groping kids wasnt a deal-breaker.
I sure hope all those pink hat gals from back in 2017 vote for Biden.
Biden is keeping the focus of attention on him.
Guess you didn't the trump's dumpster fire attempt at an interview with Jonathan Swan. Trump is unhinged and feeble. Biden gaffes don't come close to comparing.
Never forget, everything and I mean everything the Left has accused President Trump of, is things they actually did. Trump colluded, nope, it was Hillary and the Obama Administration. Trump blackmail Ukraine, nope, that's Joe Biden and Obama. Trump a racist, nope, that's the.....
#’s 2 &amp; 3 directly caused by Socialist/Communist China &amp; Dems. #1-so now you’re saying Biden a “do nothing Vice President”, except in corruption: like Ukraine threat to withhold US funds if prosecutors investigating his son wasn’t fired, trips to China w/millions made by Biden’s.
Honestly I dont know who I mean.  I think I lost track of the thread.  This is an example of dont take pain meds before you twitter.  I feel like Biden sounds.
My goal is to be alive when Trump leaves office.  My hope is that VP Biden wins big.  Trump &amp; Barr &amp; MAGA folks will of course contest the election.  Come January 21, the authorities move Trump's ass out of the White House and Pelosi moves in.  Later, SCOTUS installs VP Biden.
👏🏼 Not all Trump supporters use their brain, likewise with Biden supporters.
I agree. We have to get Trump out of office. Just remember everybody a vote for anybody other than Biden is a vote for Trump.
#YesWeCanAgain elect Joe Biden and restore the soul of America and save our democracy!
I thinks it’s funny you think they’ll arrest Bill. If Obama and Biden are untouchable Bill and Hill will never see custody let alone a conviction
Agree, they exploit that tragedy while ignoring the daily violence and corruption of trump inc. We have other great choices so we don't have to deal with this, IMHO. I still hope she gets a high post in the Biden administration.
Delusional Republicans are so funny. Cut to January 20, 2021, "Knock knock (Whitehouse front door) Donald...?" No answer. That's because #BlueWave2020 did make America great again and booted your ass out the door! Door opens, "Hello President Biden"
Biden's higher in the polls, but this seems like a party lines election. Both sides don't want to concede power and both sides don't like who's representing them (in general).
Biden does NOT instill that confidence
What do y’all make of Trump actively sewing doubts about the outcome of the election? Does it push you any closer to voting for Biden? 👂🏾👀👂🏾Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’
So rude!  I’m insulted and I’m not even black!!  Biden is a lost cause🤷‍♀️
You’re missing the context of this coming right off the heels of Biden working with Sanders on an unity platform only to have folks like Nina then publicly whip against its passage. I’m tired of seeing us reaching out and constantly getting spat in the eye publicly like this.
Emphasis on push, not dictate, especially when you didn’t get the votes. Making the VP a red line is an insult to all the other things Biden has already done with Sanders to bring the party together. Nina Turner is a bad spokesperson for Bass after what she said this week, too.
Trump INHERITED a strong economy from Obama/Biden, it weakened every year until he absolutely imploded it this year. You have the worst job record of any President in modern times. Record breaking drops in GDP group. This thread is absolute nonsense.
I saw a report that Kanye isn’t the one putting his name on the ballot in battleground states but rather Trump lawyers and supporters are actually doing it to draw votes away from Biden. Complete crap! 😡
“Poor kids are just as bright as white kids” - Joe Biden
Your ignorance is appalling. Biden is personally against abortion. That is well documented. As VP or POTUS he is obligated to follow US laws. Even Pope Francis recognizes this distinction and believes Biden is a good Catholic. Your “beef” is with Congress, not Biden.
How long is a day? Still 24 hours right? Joe Biden has promised to do about 25 things on day one in office. He wouldn't get into office until the afternoon. Dummy
Dear Joe Biden. I saw your racist remarks on Black Diversity. But, my question is Where in Sam Hill is Irizona?
If Biden can destroy God, then Trump should give up, unless he believes he is more powerful than God. But that would be blasphemy.
Trump says that Biden is against God because Trump thinks he is a god.
His wife did a good job with this tweet. There’s no way on God’s green earth he wrote this. Too late though. People are finally realizing how racist Biden is.
It matters. Biden isn’t evil. Vote.

Thats why he'll be locked up for tyranny, treason and violating his oath of office. No political will get away with that or not for long. Ohio will never comply with Biden and hopefully all states refuse to comply.
get off the fence, Meghan, and show some respect for your father.  Endorse Biden and help get rid of trump.
In the past 48 hours alone, we’ve seen Trump campaign misappropriate a picture of  in prayer for a sleezy attack ad and Trump question Biden’s personal religious faith. These are new lows in politics. Trump should not be lying and attacking  religious faith.
Biden is a devote Catholic and has been his whole life. He has even met with Pope Francis a number of times to discuss policy and has received Communion from Pope Francis. Who should I believe, the Pope or Trump?

Wow. The arrogance it takes to make a statement like this after the GOP has created the largest deficit in the history of the US, put the US into a deep recession, and cost the US millions of jobs. Biden rescued the US economy once before. He can do it again.

According to news reports earlier this evening he didn’t but Republican lawyers have done so on his behalf in states where the race may be close like Wisconsin to hopefully draw black voters away from Biden. Ridiculous bullshit!
You can download your own DIY window sign:
Biden has always said he is personally against abortion in interviews and his personal writings, such as his books. He is a good moral person. Pope Francis recognizes this role separation, personal versus state laws, it might be something to research. Stay safe.
You are wrong. Joe Biden is a devote Catholic. Has been his entire life. He has stated personally he does not support abortion, but also understands that is the law in the US. As VP or POTUS he must follow the law. Congress must change the law.
You are wrong. Joe Biden is a devote Catholic. Has been his entire life. He has stated personally he does not support abortion, but also understands that is the law in the US. As VP or POTUS he must follow the law. Congress must change the law.
Actually you are very wrong. Joe Biden is a devote Catholic. Has been his entire life. He has stated personally he does not support abortion, but also understands that is the law in the US. As VP or POTUS he must follow the law. It is up to Congress to change the law.
I doubt Trump knows that Joe Biden is a devote Catholic. Has been his entire life. He has stated personally he does not support abortion, but also understands that is the law in the US. As VP or POTUS he must follow the law. Congress must change the law.
They will not be "debates."  Trump will lie and Biden will correct him.  Trump screws up, MSM will ignore it.  Biden makes even a minor error, MSM will crucify Biden.  There is no upside for Biden. Let Trump rant all he wants that Biden was afraid; NO ONE WILL BELIEVE TRUMP.
Trump is going to lose because he is an asshole ASSUMING young people and minorities bother to vote.  The summer protests show those groups are passionate but in 2016 they didn’t vote due to a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton.  Old man Biden isn’t exactly Obama as far as coolness.
I hope Biden just tells them to f'off.  These "debates" will be Trump lying and Biden correcting him.  No upside for Biden.  Let Trump rant all he wants that Biden was "afraid."  No one will believe it.
This list is a joke.  Biden needs to tell Trump to go f' himself.
Biden cant even complete a thought
If Biden will not leave his basement as a Presidential contender, and will not accept his nomination in person, how could he ever lead a nation from his basement. That says a lot about him.
I’ve been saying I think the Biden campaign ads are being the Project Lincoln.  One moves the needle. The latter is a glorified psych op
Joe Biden is going to fix it
Come January Trump will be gone and we can all complain about Biden but then, like now, Jeff Bezos and the Walton family are our real enemies..
Federal officers gone equals no violence, your the worst President in the history of this nation and your the worst leader the world has ever seen, attacking United States citizens is not okay! Your outta here. President Joe Biden is coming!
It's all projection. Does anyone think that Trump will actually debate? I for one believe Biden should determine not to do a debate or debates.  All it will be is Trump lying and Biden correcting him.  Who wants to watch that?  Why would Biden waste time to do any?
Honestly should Biden even debate him at this point, he seems to be his own worse enemy and the gift that keeps on giving.
Biden should NOT give the BUFFOON a free platform to SPEW his toxic pile, constant lying rants, and abusive, bullying tactics of a MAFIA punk!
Joe Biden is the fakest tough guy ever.
Also seems to matter which polls are out. Emerson showing only +4 Biden drives the RCP down. They hadn’t polled since first week of June.
They all know that it is a felony to obtain the assistance of a foreign entity for purposes of affecting an election. Neither the Congressional immunity nor their “investigating” is a defense. The Biden DOJ will get indictments and prosecute them to the full extent of the law.
Trump didn’t build that. Obama and Biden did.
has this world gone crazy why in hell would anyone in there right mind vote for biden
What’s next - “If Biden is elected Earth will be invaded by Martians and all humans will be consumed for food, and you will lose all of your money.”
Joe Biden no longer has a mind.  It has wandered away into the land of Socialism I Don't Know What I Am Doing Anymore Pull My Strings.
If that were true you would both be in prison or just disappear. Didn’t Kampala Harris recently tell Trump supporters if Biden wins they were coming after us? Say again- who is Hitler-like???
It was President Obama and VP Biden and a Democratic Congress that fixed the economy the last time a GOP President wrecked a strong economy he inherited from his Democratic predecessor and we’re gonna do it again. You’re welcome.
The president is on his 4th press secretary, 3rd chief of staff, and a plethora of ACTING cabinet members.  Yeah, I'm worried about Biden's indecisiveness.  🙄
We have a President that is operating with ACTING cabinet members, his third chief of staff and fourth press secretary.  And you are worried about Biden’s indecisiveness‽
Dems are terrified for "Hidden Biden" doing debates. They know his mental decline will be on display. His incompetence revealed.   #nitwit #Alzheimers
So Biden shares his tax strategy with you? Or are you just making things up as usual? Actually, I believe that their administration inherited a shattered economy &amp; rebuilt it by the time you inherited it.
The lack of confidence in Biden is coming through loud and clear.
Your boy is mentally incompetent. Dumba**!
Millions of jobs have disappeared because of you. Biden is the only one who can help bring them back.
If Biden refuses to debate‽
Either that, or Biden gives short sentence answers. Let Trump do all the talking. He'll be shooting himself in the foot all night.
Biden could go to the nursing home and Obama could run the country. Problem solved. Next?
Would you vote for a Biden-Obama ticket?
The economy shrank the biggest it’s ever done in history, jobless claims continue to be on the rise, but you continue your false attacks on  and law enforcement. Here’s the truth: Trump tried to repeated cut federal funding for law enforcement. Biden would increase.

Nothing is going to keep us from casting our ballots, I'd walk across fire to get my vote in for Biden #WeWillVoteBBC News - US election 2020: Trump says Biden will 'hurt God  I'm aghast: G is unhurtable, holy DJT. U know this: Just hold the Bible in a protective upside down. G can be weak sometimes, like when the stars cheer 4 the demons.   November stars, darlings.
Trump actually is killing Biden. Biden isn't trying anything to kill back. This is an example of poor leadership from Biden.  is attacking both Trump and Biden with the facts.
Ohio is for Biden 2020!
Trump lying? Not news  Biden lying? News to everyone but neolibs.
Lol Kanye didn't even need to do this, Biden is creating more reasons not to vote for him everyday.
Biden is a pedophile.
He is better than Biden. But not a good as #JoJorgensen2020
Only one. I see more Trump signs around every block than I do Biden signs.
He literally enabled ICE to do what they do, along with Obama.   Obama didn't do shit when Ebola was rapidly spreading.   Biden said he supports how Trump is handling the protests, I mean, c'mon, stop getting on your 2 knees just so you can slob on Biden.
Well, actually  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump, when he loses, blame the Democrats for appealing to former Republicans instead of leftists.
No, the reason cheeto man won is because Democrats decide to choose dumbasses like Joe Biden. Stop being a slave to the system, if you actually cared, you'd realize that Democrats and Republicans are the same. When Joe Biden loses, blame the DNC for not choosing better.
Our main choices this November (Dario/Jesse bots, don't you even dare) 1. A Fascist, racist, corrupt Trump 2. A racist, Fascist, sexist corrupt Biden 3. A pedophile supporting Libertarian 4. The best choice of all them
We deserve better than Biden and Trump.
Dems will lose because they picked Biden.
I'm literally arguing with a Biden bot with no followers this is a waste of time.
The fact is, Cory is telling the truth. Biden created the Problems, Trump is enabling it and creating more problems.
Joe Biden doesn't deserve to even be a Democrat, he's, at best, a Libertarian. Since when did Republicans like you infiltrate the Democratic Party?
Bernie would've done far better, and nobody wanted Biden more than Bernie, Republicans and Center-Right Democrats wanted the most right leaning candidate in the party. That's why he won, and Bernie endorsing Biden was just a sign of betrayal. I'm not a Bernie Bro, I'm a Green.
Joe Biden actually said that he would veto free Medicare for All if it passed his desk, I'm not the Trump supporter, you're the one who is voting a Blue Trump in office.
When Democrats lose, blame them picking Biden over Bernie. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Biden Bros are the lying ones though, Biden has admitted himself he's a neoliberal and he's against most of Bernie's policies.

We will in November. Biden 2020!
Didn’t say I was voting for him either. However, the evangelicals are not supporting Biden, they are supporting an immoral and ungodly man. Sin is sin in Jesus’ eyes. He died for the traitor as much as he did the murderer.
What a beautiful speech you gave.  Really nice, turned a funeral into a political campaign.  You know what John Lewis (god rest his soul) and Biden have in common?
No you're thinking of Mushy Brained Biden, the guy who won't leave his basement or do any real press. The  man has dementia! And I can't wait until President Trump destroys him in the debates. TRUMP2020
I will not vote for someone who very well could be worse than Trump, after Biden said that he agrees with Trump sending the fighters or “rioters” to jail or prison is absolutely disgusting. Biden has created the system, Trump is only enabling and worsening the system.
No. Joe Biden should NEVER make any deal with Donald Trump. EVER. Trump will NEVER RELEASE HIS TAXES OK R DNA. Let the courts handle Trump.
Oh, Biden would help Woman? no, he wouldn’t. Vote for a feminist party, vote Green.
No vote is a wasted vote, that's the problem with liberals. They “believe” in democracy yet, they believe that if a leftist votes for THEIR values, then it's a wasted vote. I vote my values, I don't “SETTLE FOR LESS”. Biden will lose, that's the dems fault for not choosing better
Biden is literally a Democratic Trump.
Keeping Trump in office? If liberals are so confident he's gonna win why are they always attacking third party voters? Biden is Blue Trump. This is a Democracy right?
I'm proud to not be a slave to the Democrats or Republicans. Stop settling for less and think about our future generations. Biden is Blue Trump.
Biden listens to his corporate donors.
Not true. The markets will stabilize under Biden and Mar-A-Logo will become a mental institution with you,Pompeo, Barr and Jim Jordan as permanent guests.
I don’t know how any true American can cast a vote for Biden !!! I think who ever does need mental health!!!!
They should also stop "settling for Biden"
Donald Trump today: If you elect Joe Biden there will be no oxygen.  Ive talked to the oxygen people. They all tell me.....
The down rank Bernie diehards won't vote for Biden anyway. They will bitch and moan about anyone Biden pucks.  Stop with the purity bullshit.
You are fooling yourselfs Biden would have did no better!!! Hell he do even know where he is half the time!!!! Get real Trumps the only answer
We are. That's why we're electing Joe Biden.
Save your ad money for golf lessons. It’s Biden by a landslide this November!
The hacks led to bogus tweets being sent out July 15 from the accounts of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk
I dont honestly care. Im going to bote for Biden no matter who he picks.
You're supporting criminals in office, you're supporting this murdering snake, the right are more ignorant than Biden Bros
We love you I pray that the new president Biden has you by his side you deserve to be there
It will be a rigged election this year to favor biden
Biden is Trump 2.0
Biden sucks. The Democrats suck. Vote Green.Regardless of what the current polls are saying, I will not relax until Jan. 20th &amp; I physically see Joe Biden getting inaugurated. Until then, Trump’s capable of just about anything, including destroying our democracy to stay in power. He’s a sociopath.
Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working against Biden
If Biden wins, I'm going to quickly point point out "thoughts and prayers aren't good enough" when god forbid something happens. Cos you know, thats what every president has done since, like, forever
Do I have to bring up all Biden’s racist foopa’s?
Re: Biden tapping Ana Navarro to "rev up" Latinx people...
“Both the Trump and Biden campaigns have also traded accusations that their candidate has dementia”
I'll just say that you'd have to try extremely hard to have a less effective, coordinated, or consistent federal response to a virus than the one put forth this year.  Reagan, the Bush pair, Obama, Clinton, Carter, Ford, Nixon, or Biden would have done better.
In my never ending quest to try and understand those who think different then I........ can someone explain how Biden’s most recent comments on black people not being “diverse” isn’t racist? And then tell me how the president saying that would be received?
He can also pay the Russians for dirt on Biden and his ilk
Mark, I like to agree with you but these executive orders seem like orders of a dictator. You reap what you sow. If Biden wins and his racist VP takes over look out. Harris has a pile of executive orders ready to go. Congress be damned.
Or Hillary Clinton's 2nd account to help Biden win the election
4/..totally selfish and totally counter productive!!  Any action taken other than voting for Biden and Blue in general is a vote for Trump and is unforgivable.  Save your protest vote for 2024.  Or better yet,  run yourself and convince us we should vote for you.  You have 4 yrs
3/... and spite votes and all that garbage.  NO candidate is perfect ever.  But this isn’t just about your personally any more.  It’s about US and who pushes the agenda closest to what we want.  And right now that’s Biden just like then it was Hillary.  To do anything else is ..
Trump and Biden both suck 😂
Watching Dems defend Biden’s comments amaze after they criticize Trump all the time 😂 Holy fuck yall some hypocrites 😂
3. President today. If I’m right and the dyslexia (learning disability) and the stuttering of Biden mimics cognitive decline, neither of those issues would affect either candidates ability to do the job. Like isn’t test taking or getting the words right every time nor is there
1. As a stutterer who believed through high school that I was deficient, YouTube the last 20 or 30 years of Biden and don’t confuse the further aging ailment with cognitive decline. Same with Trump and pronouncing words
Joe Biden: Latinos are Diverse, Unlike the African Americans
Now do Biden
I cannot BELIEVE that stupid _______g Trump had the gall to call into question Joe Biden’s (a devout Catholic) relationship with God or the Bible. When’s the last time THAT hypocrite cracked open a Bible other than to gas people for a photo op?
What’s a God to a Biden?
Not that it should matter to begin with. It doesn't to me. I'm an atheist who won't be voting for Biden anyway, but still...the ridiculousness...
That isnt a competition though, Biden has a shit ton of catching up to do if thats the case
Conservatives way of dealing with elections is to launch investigations into their political rival right before the election... they did it to Hillary in 2016 and now are trying to do it to Biden in 2020...they’ll come out with all sorts of nonsense, don’t fall for it !!!!
I too am surprised that in an election year the opposing political party would observe that Biden responded to a black journalist’s question by asking if he was a “junkie” followed by further ramblings.
"Marxist"  Not one of Biden's policies is even close to Marx, sadly.  Also, Marx argued for a well armed proletariat, so all you're doing here is showing that you have no idea what the words you use mean.
"How does Biden fill the 14 points of fascism? lol"

Honestly Biden wasn't my first choice, also honestly Trump screwed things up worse than I ever imagined anybody could &amp; continues to get worse daily.
If Biden wins we are Screwed! Imagine if Trump said this, there would be a tsunami of news coverage and all of it negative!
In Joe Biden's America,
youre voting for trump.  Biden is alot closer to giving you those things.  Most of them are part of his platform NOW.  But, youre wasting a vote on something that will NEVER happen.    Vote Blue this year, then vote green when theres actually a green candidate worthy of a vote
voting for bernie would be going from one extreme to the other and would insure 2022 would be a repeat of 2010....biden is the best of both worlds and what we NEED right now.  It may not be ALL you want, but its a hell of alot closer than what we've got and trending the right way
youre not voting green, youre voting red.  ANY and ALL votes cast or not cast for Joe Biden IS a vote for Trump.  It is your right, of course, but you are bending the country over the chair in the process and if Trump wins goodbye to nature, alternative energy, and the planet
hes 100% better than Trump on every level.  NO candidate is ever perfect ! But, Biden is 1000 steps closer to where we want to be than where we are now.  And theres alot more than just Biden to worry about.  Senate and House seats.   State and local offices judges and issue. VOTE
thats true of trump, not biden.   so far, biden hasnt told us to drink bleach to cure covid.   hasnt been a blubbering fool trying to hold a daily press breifing nobody cares about
thats true of trump not Biden.  He said a long time ago he agreed to 3
The entire nation needs to rebel &amp; shout-out against attempts to sabotage the postal service in order to give Trump a leg up. Elderly Trump voters have as much right to avoid COVID as elderly  Biden voters-or any voter for that matter.
And Joe Biden is your answer??????......im not a fan of either but to say Trump is losing it when Joe is OBVIOUSLY suffering from some sort of mind illness is disingenuous man.
No.  We want to switch from crest to Biden!
This makes me feel better about Ohioans.  We need to make it a landslide victory for Biden: no questions about validity
We have 328,000,000 people living in the United States. How is it that Donald Trump and Joe Biden are the top two candidates available to run our country? These are the top two turds on the pile of 328,000,000 people? We're being fucked, big time!
except that, yes, Biden IS good.  Especially compared to Trump
You're SO right, Donald! Soon Biden will take your place. That will be SO much better!
He is because he knows everyone on Tiktok which is 100million Americans will vote for Biden
Biden will win and it's proven because the comment feed on Tiktok has over 500k comments saying voting for biden

Probably true, but on January 20th, if isn't the undisputed winner, and Biden isn't the undisputed winner, Pelosi will be president until it's sorted out.
Will this activity increase under Biden? And yes, that’s a rhetorical question.
Biden will fix it.  Lol
I’m voting in person also. Biden 2020
If Biden flips MI, PA and WI, it's game over. He could even afford to lose NV in that case. Everything else is gravy.
its a stupid question.   Its a ruse, nothing more.   We have  ALOT more important things to worry about right NOW..  Getting Biden and Dems voted in and Trump and his GOP cult voted out !!!!   THEN we can worry about if they'll abide by the results or not
I don’t like Biden but I saw some truck driving around with a Biden flag and I was so stoked cuz all I see are trump flags on most trucks
Don’t have time for trolls...  I think the vast majority know what we are dealing with Trump.  He’s got to go!!  Biden will organize a qualified cabinet and we will stop the chaos.
Nope!  2020 is the year to wipe out racism, bigotry, chaos, and having a leader who is mocked throughout the world.  Vote #Biden (and #Dudziak2020) like your life depends on it!!
This made my night! #Biden still has my vote though! No rest until November!  #BlueWaveComing
Stable?? You think Biden has any sane thoughts or educated ideas for our country. He’s a puppet.
Well you would never have to worry about that with Biden. He could not even find his phone or have a complete thought to tweet. The President keeps us informed, we can’t count on media for fair reporting. Get over it!

I really feel bad for gun owners.  Clinton took all their guns, just to buy new ones under Bush.  Then Obama took them all only to buy new ones yet again under Don.  Now Biden is going to take them all?  How many times are gun owners going to have to buy a brand new stockpile?

They ignore an entire year of Biden deteriorating before everyone's eyes, but expect us to all take a hack interview from Democrat PR outlet Axios super serious.
Biden's laying low, watching Trump destroy himself second by second. Times up, we've had enough.
Well at least this is a new tactic.  I guess the "lol, Biden has dementia" comments every time Trump's mental decline is mentioned weren't getting traction.
That's why the DNCmedia is now trying to make Trump look unfit. They very same people who ignore all of Biden's issues are going to distort and amplify every gaffe Trump makes.

That’s what I’m saying. There’s a real chance that a Dem wins and Biden isn’t inaugurated.
It’s just crazy to me because Obama was one of the biggest culprits behind Biden nomination. I would argue that he has done more to hurt the left than help it. Even still, he is lionized by so many fellow comrades. But this is coming from someone who voted for Obama... twice.
If Biden is serious about giving the nation a reset, and I think he is, he should take care to pick someone highly competent but without their own presidential ambitions.
I found some new friends. I follow back 🌊🌊

LMAOOOO sure the President’s disastrous Axios interview and rants about water pressure and “Biden hurting God” are definitely evidence of his newfound message discipline

Joe Biden, lmao you people.   The man’s getting a couple hundred live viewers, ya really gotta work hard at being this dense.  Atheist, Vegan, Tds, libtard, our true bottom of the barrel.
And Dementia Joe and his V.P. pick will carry the conservative torch? Don't be silly.  Even if you don't like Trump, Biden is a horrible alternative. 40+ years in office with little to show.
The number of drone strike casualties during Obama’s admin is estimated to be about 5,000. Trump revoked the order that let us now the true number in 2019. Regardless those strikes weren’t Biden’s call

Biden camp taps Republican Trump foe Ana Navarro to rev up Latino voters
This original video is calling out trump for his position on AOC and you’re bringing Biden into this when I didn’t mention him to begin with. So rightfully so I can assume you’re a trump supporter bc you assumed I’m a Biden supporter right? Anyways y’all fail to admit he’s racist
Yo  I have your campaign slogan... “Ridin’ With Biden” #yourwelcome
Well to be fair, he did just issue an apology this week for one of his gaffes. I’m pretty sure that Biden has more apologies this week offered than Trump in his whole life. But as you say, it’s a low bar and no one should necessarily feel proud of beating Trump at anything.

Chris, last night you said Jesus even asked for forgiveness.  Living in a glass house and throwing rocks....Perhaps Trump, Biden and yourself need a refresher course...You see I thought your statement was as idiotic as Trump’s. Stay off subjects you don’t know well.
He seems to be unaware that you only take such a test when there are issues that necessitate taking one.  There's a reason Trump has taken one &amp; a reason why Biden hasn't needed to take one.  Let's see his long-form health records.  #TrumpsNotWell
Would not put it past Biden and Hussein....
"Take away your guns, destroy your Second Amendment. No religion, no anything. Hurt the Bible, hurt God," Trump said. "He's against God, he's against guns, he's against energy, our kind of energy," the president said.
disclaimer that I'm never advocating for someone's death but wtf would happen if Trump and Biden both died in some crazy natural disaster or something at a debate man that'd be nuts
Well, Biden attends services, so there
Literally, these people are literally on here calling anyone who supports trump racist but then the same person is supporting Biden saying ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN TRUMP
I would walk over hot coals to vote for the ghost of Peter the Great, Millard Fillmore and Lucifer himself before I’d vote for Biden or another modern Dem.

Trump n his Base will Always Twist whatever Biden Says.. The Fact is Biden is fighting for the Rights of All Americans!!! Including the African American And Latino Americans.. Trump Has Said Things Much Worse and Derogatory about Both
The poll being posted was disgusting enough. But it’s just one guy who thinks he’s funny that posted it.   The fact that with 9000 votes in, 46% of people voted “yes” makes me very worried for what will happen if Biden and Dems take power.
This is 100% spot on.   Biden is Uncle Junior. Well intentioned enough but also sad, confused and lashing out.  Trump is Livia. Determined to malignantly burn everyone and everything down along with himself on the way out.
Another reason to vote for Biden. Keep em coming!

And this is EXACTLY why you do not give Kanye your vote. It has been said over and over, and now he admits to it.  Kanye's only goal is to steal your vote so Biden loses.  Nothing more, nothing less.
Absolutely, and every time trump lies, he strengthens the resolve of black voters against him and for Vice President Biden.
I don't blame anyone for whatever choice they make re Biden. I'm not voting for him but that's my personal choice.

Only RACIST comment was #5 and it was here say.  Now do Biden. Now do Hillary. Now do Obama. Wake up or shut up!
Apparently this pastor doesn't think too much of the commandment not to bear false witness. Biden is Catholic, so the claim that he "can't stand Jesus" reeks of falsehood.

Not disagreeing that Biden has some trouble speaking. That said, if you compare Trump's speech to Biden's, do you feel that the two are equally qualified to lead?
A fair take. It's that old question, is he a Racist or a Heavy Stereotyper. Either way, Biden is much of an Archie Bunker than his defenders want to acknowledge.

Maybe you should understand the racist comments Trump has made in the last 30+ years. Who says i’m a Biden supporter? I can admit when the democrat candidate is bad. Also why would I give af what a crusty white man thinks how I look? I can fuck more women than you😂
Tryin to score points by taking a statement out of context? Biden is right, maybe he could have stated it differently. The African American community has loyalty, hundreds of yrs of persicution have made them strong for each other. BLM, u racist pig.

I don't disagree that theres been some cognitive decline, I think trump and even Bernie have also had cognitive decline. Happens when ur that old. I just think a narrative has been developed around Biden that just exaggerates it into full blown dementia
I’m not sure Biden knows what ‘God’ is...lol.
That is a nice thought. But folks won't stop voting, However I think we are stuck which goobers we got. I can't stand Trump so I guess Biden will get my vote. Hopefully folks learn one day not to vote for a party but vote on their leadership &amp; compassion for folks.

See what happens when you let Grand Wizard Joe Biden out the basement 😩
Establishment dems have spent months appealing to moderate republicans and ignoring the leftists that feel less and less inclined to vote as their candidate moves farther right. Young people turnout will still be low unless Biden picks a progressive VP, which is a pipedream
NBC's maps are giving Biden too much credit, making the election seem over before it's really getting going. This could only hurt turnout and enthusiasm in Democrats. AZ, FL and NC, and ME2 can still swing the other way. Goes along with the trend of Biden/dems being too confident
So you are voting for Biden?

I don't recall Biden being endorsed by David Duke. Or being a climate denier. Or ordering the FBI director to drop an investigation.

Is it up to Biden to approve the moderators or the commission? See that's what I don't get. I assume both camps provide a list, the commission picks, and they either say OK or no. If the toadies don't get picked, Biden says yes and Trump says no. Right?
Honestly I think What they are doing to Joe Biden is low-key elder abuse
Biden is that powerful? Damn. He’s got my vote.
Maybe I'm confused about how these debates happen but how does the Trump campaign spin Trump backing out because his toadies get rejected as Biden backing out?
I don't remember Joe Biden having to shut down his fake University. Or his Charity. Or asking Russia to intervene in an election. Or refusing to release his taxes. Or being pro-concentration camps. Or encouraging cops to be more  violent. Or extorting for political dirt.

For Biden to win, he just needs to tweet and not speak publicly until November. He continues to put his foot in his mouth.
must be the same plan Biden is on -
Joe Biden sounds pretty fucking rad, TBH. Thanks, Dad.
This is still a head-scratcher. How can so many have an unfavorable view of Joe Biden?
#QAnons  they keep removing this - Biden is in a hurt of trouble MSM, twitter and FB trying to protect him:
Trump can’t wait to debate Biden and it’s going to be bad for everyone. I hate politics.
Joe Biden just has to sit there and stfu... but he’s showing us he can’t.
Don't try to find the wrong in everything Biden says.....even though Libs do it to Trump 24/7. Hilarious!
Joe Biden? Does POTUS know Ohio is full of Catholic colleges, schools ... Cincinnati is one of America’s most Catholic cities. Biden’s a practicing Catholic! Yea, good luck with this line.
Biden, I want the full line of Le Creuset enamel cast iron in Marseille blue or I don't vote for you.
BREAKING: Joe Biden actually a JRPG character.
Trump in 4 weeks at the rate he's deteriorating: "Biden, folks, him the bad. Bigly bad. [accordian hands] Do a hurt on your guns. Make angry. Take your bible and do a hurt. He bad mean. He kill your house."
Ok voting for Biden now.
Joe Biden &amp; Criminal Cohorts want to Abolish Everything That Represent Trumps Good Over Evil With The Proposed Current Efforts of ReBuilding Better Than Ever Efforts Involving The Entire United States Of America?
Look if Biden doesn't promise to forgive my student loan debt then I just can't vote for him.
Today President Trump, standing next to you, said that Joe Biden will "hurt God."  Do you believe his comment is about Joe Biden in particular, or does it apply widely to all practicing Catholics, or perhaps just to Catholics who differ from us politically?  Do you support this?
I'm hardly a Joe Biden stan but I will say he understands what's happened to the middle class over the past 70 years because that was his childhood and youth, which is much more "real world" perspective than most politicians.
So Trump said Joe Biden will hurt the Bible and hurt God. I support Joe Biden as a catholic of 54 years. Joe isn’t friends with a pedophile. Joe hasn’t paid for abortions. Joe doesn’t spit on the Ten Commandments.
. who sends well wishes to child rapists and praises murderous dictators and encourages violent police tactics and called for the execution of five innocent black men and who is greedy, corrupt and surrounded by criminals says Joe Biden will “hurt God”?Hahahahaha
Trump is the most unethical, incompetent, corrupt and stupid president in history. And Biden can barely stay ahead in the polls.   Just imagine where Biden would be if there weren't a pandemic. The Dems would actually lose to the worst president ever. They still might
If anyone had a reason to be "against God" it might be someone whose young family was taken in a car crash or whose surviving charismatic son died young from cancer. Rather, Joe Biden lives and finds comfort in his Faith. Trump's attack on him is despicable.

At this point he’s saying anything!!! Trump- Dont vote for Biden he hangs with those thugs on Sesame Street, Ernie, Big Bird none of them care for you like I do😂😂Welcome to the circus!!!!🤡 Go vote or mail in your ballots please!!!!
I guess she wasn’t there for the 2007 recession and how Biden lead the task force to fix the economy and bail out large American corporations? No? Oh ok.
At least, Biden actually did grow up middle class, and his family experienced the middle class erosion of the late 20th century much like many others did - his dad leaving behind a mgmt career to bounce around till finally settling on being a used car salesman.
They have done just that... but the Biden sock puppet will not win. 2016 repeat
But it’s not going to gain him any votes. It will motivate more of his base but it’s not going to take away any votes from Biden.
I'm not so sure. How many NRA supporters did you think were going to vote for Biden anyway?
Joe Biden. The gift that keeps giving!
I think there’s enough contempt by the public for people like Biden and Hillary to give you a decent shot. There may even be value in losing (if it came to that).  Charles Bookers failed bid for senate illuminated to many brainwashed voters just how dirty the dem party can be
i will hold my nose and vote for biden, solely bc trump is acting as an unhinged dictator currently, but i can’t vote for amy mcgrath bc of blatant voter suppression and being the most uninspiring candidate i have ever seen in any election
It's because, now more than ever, there is no third option. A vote against Biden is for Trump, it's that simple.
I’m tellin ya now. ⁦ got some mischief lurking up their skirts. No way they will let Gibberish ⁦ get elected. There’ll be a last minute “Hail Mary” (Sorry Mary) to slip in a body. The ballot boxes are already programmed for her.
Best-case scenario for the presidential election: Biden just barely beats Trump, with a massive Green/other 3rd party and write-in votes so that neither major party gets an actual majority of votes.
No he didn’t you lemming, watch the video for the all important context you preach about for Biden.  Quit lying it’s pathetic.
But the context means so much for a Biden, why not Trump?  Oh cause your still lying.

I'm sure The Dispatch Editorial Board will have a scathing rebuke of Joe Biden for his racist comments.
Biden ran for POTUS twice prior to Obama picking him as VP. It is clearly misogynistic to dismiss  for wanting to be president. If she scares you as a strong, intelligent woman of color &amp; you hide it by saying she's "too ambitious," please see yourself back to 1963.
It’s not a gaffe when you do it repeatedly!! It is the real Biden!
The basic problem is: BOTH candidates are MORONS!  Whenever you only attack one of them for being mentally deficient, you are just revealing your partisan bias. Trump is stupid! Biden is Unhinged!  ...and vice-versa...

Polls show Americans want to see Joe Biden debate. Always nice to see the leftists media carry his water
Think your political party has the solution you been waiting for?  I sure hope not  The world’s offer: Trump vs. Biden in the temporary kingdom of America  God’s offer: Jesus reigns as a perfect King in a kingdom that never ends
Biden polling at 7-8% + is better then Clinton, Obama in both 08’ and ‘12... basically every Dem candidate since Bill Clinton blew Dole out of the water.
I would walk over hot coals to vote for the ghost of Peter the Great, Millard Fillmore and Lucifer himself before I’d vote for Biden of another modern Dem.
Come and join what surely will be the largest landslide in US Presidential election History. The Lefties are shooting with Blanks. They are for sure in a “The Emperor Has No Clothes scenario for sure Biden is their Emperor. Sad. If it was a prize fight they would stop it.
Biden does not need to debate trump! Why??? Let trump defeat himself!
told you Biden was to much of a pussy to defund the police
I'll bet you Dinner at the Precinct that Trump demolishes Biden.
If not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump, and not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden, does that mean my vote counts three times?  Awesome!!
Inb4 the smart asses say “8 more years??” Yes. The Republican Party does not have anyone at all to challenge him other then trump. If Biden dies in those 8 years, his shitty vp will continue his work.
And this is why I cannot vote blue no matter who. 8 years of Biden admin vs 4 more years of trump. My brain tells me Biden but my heart and ideaology cannot let me vote for him.
Thanks Obama, Wall Street, Neoliberals, Military contractors, Corporate DNC, etc. I would walk over hot coals to vote for the ghost of Peter the Great over Biden.
We need all the votes that we can get. Think of Biden as a springboard into bringing a bunch of younger, similar thinkers as yourself into his administration.
Sure, but even say he didn’t.    What are ya gonna give Biden’s ghost power, the mans lucky if he can still eat solid foods, or say his full name?
Let me risk getting covid to vote for Biden who’s been a corporate shill for 40 years. Hard pass. Praying someone else comes back into play
Dems are PASSIVELY worried that Kanye will siphon votes from Biden and are called racist for that assumption. I get it.  Republicans are ACTIVELY trying to put Kanye on the ballot to siphon votes from Biden and we get crickets against them.  What?! Who are the real racists here?
How about Trump debating an empty chair with Biden's picture on it like Clint Eastwood did a few years ago at RNC?  TRUMP  could handle that for the 4TH DEBATE.
Of course they did! That’s what they do. The ⁦ doesn’t seem to alarmed about running Gibberish ⁦ for office cause they have a way to cheat in their back pocket.   Watch and see...

He really does not want to debate Biden.
I also feel that Black voters going for Kanye over Biden likely showcases discomfort under Biden (understandable) rather than "lol dumb Black people voting for their own" (you didn't say this but others have).
Joe Biden is fucking nuts
I still stand with that I have said about Kanye: his presidency was more likely to attract votes away from Trump than it was to attract away from Biden. Kanye's politics do not appeal to people who are considering Biden but could take disillusioned Trump voters.
Electric vehicles? American-made? Joe Biden in aviators?  This is my political ideology 😎🇺🇸

If I could vote today I’d do it. There is nothing you could say or do to change my mind that you are totally unqualified to reside in the WH. My vote is for Biden as he will restore America to the greatness we had prior to you fucking up literally everything. #WorstPresidentEver
SW Ohio here, bordering KY and IN and I haven’t seen a single one.  Occasionally I will see someone make a FB post saying they’re voting for Biden and then 4 people responding to it saying they’re voting for Trump.
Every day Biden says something almost as racist as whatever Trump spews. It's like a race to the bottom. I'm not voting for either of them.
Worried? If Biden was part of the same traitorous cabal you were part of, that attempted a coup against a duly elected President then timing of indictments or reports is irrelevant. Saving are Republic trumps timing.
Because Joe Biden could walk out for the debate eating a ham sandwich, piss himself and laugh and I would still vote for him over you.
New Biden ad focuses on Black Americans:
Bottom line: the two most recent polls have Biden up 4 pts , and 2 pts here.   And this is with far less Biden/superpac TV spending than almost any other swing state. (And a ton of Trump ads to boot)  But Ohioans can tell you why Biden’s up on Trump.   2/
Don't fall for the banana in the tailpipe. Everyone knows why he's doing this, to siphon away black votes from VP Joe Biden. I see through you Kanye. 👁 I see you for the distraction you are.
What really kills me is I am hearing criticism from 45 supporters about Biden faults, and almost every example is a milder version of 45's faults. I think they are valid crits, but seriously, he is undergrad level, and 45 is PhD in them.
It is obviously, lady. Biden says stuff that functioning adults don’t say. He talks about inappropriate things.
Biden also eulogized a Klan member.
Trump claiming that Biden is going to tear this country apart is like if you walked in on your wife cheating on you and then she tried to blame you for ruining your marriage.
This stat is what Black folks in SC knew in February and why they voted for Biden.
And other communities of color. This sort of politics is detrimental regardless of what political party it comes from. Biden is going to need to do a lot more to gain the confidence of those fearful of authoritarian police control &amp; increasing funding is NOT it

How does this make sense😑😑 I mean I can understand to Biden how this makes sense. But the rest of America I thought was smarter then that. 🤦🏽‍♀️
*shrugs* I disagree. He didn't need to win the debates and he still won. I fear the same again.   Biden will debate Trump or he won't. It's up to Biden and his team and I trust them.
Yesterday I realized that Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
Never see DJT - every morning is Biden - I have a whole list of ready to fire meme each morning :)
If Biden misspeaks, you can expect correction or clarification. With trump, he’ll deny any mistake or double down on a mistake.
Its just hard to watch anything joe biden especially with the media and the left making excuses for him. Its just ENOUGH ALREADY

We are.  I am very ashamed.  Even though I've never voted Republican, even though I'm supporting Biden, even though I hate Trump, I carry that shame.  I'm hoping, but I'm not hopeful, that we will do better come November.
Say what you will about trump, but I think it was MIGHTY NICE of Him to Film that HOUR-LONG AD on Axios for Joe Biden 🎥.  Keep talking. Your words are the best ads for future President Biden
People want change and Joe Biden really just doesn’t understand
I don't think Ohio is likely at all to be a tipping point state, and you would want polls of potential tipping point states. If Biden wins OH, he almost certainly wins WI, MI, PA.
You know this is global pandemic right. It's not gonna magically go away when trump or Biden wins.
I’m voting for Biden
People will fail you. Trump isn't the answer. Biden isn't the solution.  A higher degree won't solve your problems. More money won't complete your life.  A vaccine won't fix everything.
Joe Biden’s “come on man” sounds exactly like every white man when accused of sexism or racism, “come on man, you know i didn’t mean it like that”
Most of us don't need the debates to make a decision. The decision has already been made. Biden is the choice for Americans that don't want our democracy turned into a dictatorship. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

They're looking toward the future and a Biden win.
You mean like if Trump were to start a political spying operation into Biden’s current campaign? Or use the IRS to go after liberals? Pull your head out of your rear end. Obama is the most corrupt president this country has ever had.

TRUMP needs to challenge Joe Biden to 4th debate very soon.  If Joe refuses TRUMP DEBATES AN EMPTY CHAIR like Clint Eastwood at RNC.  Wow!  So funny?  What do you think Friends??
I trust Biden too
Don't forget that Basement Joe's moronic tweets are intended for moronic voters. In a Times op-ed, Biden saluted the senator often credited as the architect of the 1994 ban, Dianne Feinstein of California.
The reality of the photos doesn't make the point they are making any less true.  Biden disappeared for months. He is obviously showing signs deteriorating mental ability.
Is this supposedly journalism now? Imagining that people really believe the Trump team have a pic/video of Biden hiding in his basement?  DUH. It doesn't take a genius to figure out they are trying to paint a picture by editing photos. T
This absolutely sucks, Trump might quite literally be the anti-christ, and Joe Biden is a conservative in disguise.
Yeah the president could, and that President will be Biden.
Sen Portman, how did you explain your decision to sell-out Ambassador Yovonovich and Ambassador Taylor to the Lt Gen Dayton?  How long will it take you to abandon him?  Oh, and what do you think of Sen Johnson’s efforts to smear Biden using Ukraine again?
He should be ashamed of himself.  Biden is incapable of running this country.  Obama (worst President) ever.  I don't understand any of this crap thats going on.  I do know you and Trump is our only way to clean this up.  Thank you both for bring back God to our country.
Biden is too far gone. This November isn't about Biden being in office if he wins. It's about the VP becoming president. Be very worried about our Democracy if Biden is voted in and the VP takes his place.
What Biden would do is to be in charge, be responsible and br competent, accept mistakes and he will not play the blame game and be honest to the American American people.
Wow Obama cut the budget for Nasa during his tenure and wants to take credit for the Commercial Program. Such a fake shame to get Biden votes ehh buddy!🤣😆 Maybe you can admit some truth to the people and tell us about the transfer of Presidential powers to Trump.
the america joe biden wants is fixing up an old corvette with the boys while a rolling stones song plays and you all catcall women
I really think that people who vote for Kanye wouldn't have voted for Biden anyway, so no, I'm not that worried about it.
Umm... No. Trump has been detrimental to LGBTQ rights from his first day in office. Joe Biden has been a long time friend and advocate.

The veep for Biden will certainly help DJT the polls will tighten but If they win AZ and PA there fine either way.

Mr. President, I urge you to challenge Joe Biden to a 4th debate.  You need to show an EMPTY CHAIR with BIDEN on it and just do the CLINT EASTWOOD stick he did at the RNC Convention.  The setting is important.  It would be so funny and reveal the truth.
It doesn't matter, Biden is still leading.
In other words: it’s bull. Research and fact check. Do not just absorb what is reported. Indeed, I have said this NUMEROUS times. I truly loathe dissemination of untruths. Trump’s camp does it. Biden’s camp does it. It is pure bologna.
I'm convinced anyone that votes for Trump is evil Straight From Hell I mean it's obvious he's murdered thousands of Americans and continues his evil ways it's time we vote for Biden and hope that he can heal this nation so that we can heal the world oldest evilness up by the root
And all Biden said was that he'd have to look at it to be sure it didn't raise taxes on the middle class. A reasonable position, istm and one that doesn't at all lock him into a veto.
There isn't a person on either side of the aisle that actually believes Biden will live for more than a few days or weeks after he's elected *if* he won.   Everyone knows he's a figurehead.   Everyone knows the Left will do ANYTHING to win. The least of which is lie and cheat.

hes just doing it so biden loses votes and trump wins so he can keep his tax break
And Biden should just stand firm: say he'll show up to the debates as planned and hope Trump decides to get behind the other podium. If he doesn't, he doesn't. And, as you suggest,  he won't.
Biden is much more likely to make concessions — simple as that

How the hell do you guys listen to Trump answer or not answer the easiest questions and not be able to answer follow up questions and still say shit like this about Biden?
This might be a good thing. He is on the ballot to draw black voters away from Biden. Everyone knows he can’t win.
Personally I enjoy that Trump is the indignant and lashing out kind of senile and Biden is the sad and confused kind. Elderly excellence 2020.

Worst Biden Gaffe of All-time? | Top Biden Gaffes of the Week  via
I know...  This is why I have been pushing, suggesting Biden pick Condoleezza Rice.  Having a little common sense next to Joe would be a little more reassuring to me.
Witnessing Bernie’s unconditional surrender and complete consolidation of Biden/DNC w/ Lincoln Proj. style republicans in the face of COVID &amp; George Floyd’s death has been demoralizing. Tlaib and Bush’s victories are much needed signs that there is desire for something better
I agree with your points, it really is not a true democracy anymore. However, I feel Trump is much more of a threat to my rights and the rights of others than Biden. Trump needs to go and at this point I’ll do whatever I can to get him out. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Yes, our political system is screwed
1. I’m assuming you’ve seen the polls with Biden dominating, he’s a lock to win the election. 2. If they hit 5% they get federal funding for the next election. 3. If Biden is a lock to win, why would I waste my vote on someone who doesn’t represent anything that I believe in?
I'd love Mitt Romney to be the VP running mate to Biden.... It would make my voting decision so much clearer...for me.
This is not the election to champion a third party when so much is on the line. A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump. Yes, our current political system is a complete disaster, but let’s tackle that at a later time because right now it’s threatened entirely.
Trump is a threat to our rights and our democracy. No one loves Biden, but at least I can take comfort in knowing my rights won’t actively be at stake under his administration or appointment of SCOTUS justices. And I feel confident in his selection of a WOC running mate 🤞🏻
For anyone who is still not convinced to vote for Biden and would rather vote third party or not vote at all, *particularly women, LGBTQ+ and POC:   Do y’all realize what is on the line here? This isn’t just four more years. If Trump is re-elected...
people say literally the same thing about Biden. Logically no ones taking away our democracy because A it’s not truely even a democracy anymore more and is a oligarchy  that’s voted in or B in reality the USA is to decentralized and inviduialist for a authoritarian state
But apparently they voted for Biden over Bernie? Hmm.
Ole Trump says coherent things, stupid many times, but coherent...  but Biden cannot make coherent sentences right now...  Something is definitely wrong with him.
Absolutely not. A vote for a third party is a vote for Trump.  I’m all for championing a third party, but this is not the election to do so in my opinion when our democracy is on the line and so much is at stake with Trump getting re-elected. I will vote for Biden.
That’s literally not how voting works. You also assume that if there wasn’t a Green Party candidate the vote would go to Biden, that ain’t always the case bud.
1) Settling for Biden is a joke as any vote should be earned, no matter the perceived stakes.   2) Settling for Biden opens the door for the socialist wing of the Dem Party to take over. That would be disastrous, even for those who think it’s a good idea.   Thanks but no thanks.
Atp anyone who supports Joe Biden I question your mental stability. Bc how??? 🥴

Frankfort is just agonizingly swingy. Obama won it in 2012, Trump won in 2016, and about half the statewide Dems won it in 2019. I would say its inching left, just not as fast as other places, and that Biden will probably win it by a few points
Joe Biden is a racist
Only the Democratic Party has ending citizens united in their platform. Only the dems have passsed major anti corruption reform recently. Only the dems have many reps who refuse super pac money. Biden won the election in case you weren’t paying attention. Dems didn’t nominate him
What do we do if we only win 49 Senate seats but Biden still wins .... ?!?
What's interesting is that the Trump campaign is going to great lengths to make Biden look sad by manipulating photos &amp; all Biden had to do to counter it is run the real tapes of the Village Idiot talking.  LOL!!!

If Biden only loses Iowa by 3 points in Nov he is winning nationally high single digits and around 350 electoral votes. Sadly because I used to work there in 08 but IA is closer to TX than any other swing state.
Yeah because Biden will actually listen to people who are experts on this and not make it a political argument. Good insight Kevin, don’t forget to wear your mask in public

Important to call out all of these GOP operatives working on behalf of Kanye.

Of all the people in the world to go after...
The neolib centrists want our votes but not our input. I’ll vote for Biden, but that doesn’t mean I won’t challenge his pimping for banks and demand national healthcare.
Hmmm... That's worth looking into. It does kinda ruin the fun of going to the polling place in a Biden shirt...
I’m a white lady and I cannot fucking wait to check the box for Biden. I’ll do it while dancing my ass in a mask to the poll.
Not buying that. I finally decided to choose a party. Biden or Trump? Sad when Trump is better.
They are promoting anarchy. And his base is eating it up. Biden needs to use extreme sanctions on Russia when he takes office. He needs to restore trust with our allies again as well. Russia is behind tearing down all forms of democracy. He is a giant roach that needs attention.
Biden is correct about farm bankruptcies, which increased 24% for the 12 months ending September 2019, up to 580 from 468 the previous 12 months, and 20% for the 12 months ending December 2019, up nearly 100 filings

China and Iran don’t want tRump re-elected but Russia is actively working to interfere against Biden, with Republican help. I say China and Iran feel free to sabotage tRump since Republicans now seem ok with foreign interference, right?
But Biden is objectively a center-right candidate (corporate capitulation, dragging feet on climate, rejecting universal healthcare). So this doesn’t seem like a good reason to vote for Biden. Maybe there are good reasons, but this is not one of them.

Anyone who thinks Trump is in better physical or mental health than Biden is living in an alternative reality.
You are likely as racist as you think Biden is. Any white person born into a racist, white supremacist society as we have cannot help but be racist. We cannot help but to have benefitted from that system. We can do better. We can learn. Something Trump doesn’t do. Biden learns.
As soon as we have Biden in office we must begin readdressing #ClimateCrisis It belongs on the front burner (No pun intended).  We will soon be passing the point of no return if we don’t work hard and fast!  We must rejoin the rest of the world in this fight for a livable future!

I must agree with SE Cupp this morning that Kamala Harris is the obvious and best choice for a second in command, and to bring across swing voters to a Biden winning side. Kamala has always been my first choice, and I hope Mr. Biden agrees.

I find it notable that folks on the left think Biden would be more inflationary. If this is saying that more inflation would be seen as a virtue among supporters (it's a reach to conclude that), then perhaps Biden will find it easier than some think to deliver.
Naufal makes a good point that a lot hinges on Biden's appetite for fiscal spending. I am also uncertain whether he is ready to throw off old-school fiscal restraint for the brave new MMT world. Was hoping to learn about this yesterday with the poll.
Besides all the progressives we can get into office if Biden becomes president will help.
I think the Democratic party is gambling that they can entice more Trump defectors to vote Biden than they will lose by pushing the left away.  I wonder how long before they start waffling on reproductive rights?

I have a real question here. conservative Christians (not Dylan) have been consistently hammering me that Trump is ushering in the NWO. They have to know how BAD Biden &amp; company is, so my question is do they just NOT vote? Would Jesus recommend we don't vote? I don't think so.

Ever ask yourself why Hillary didn't run again? She win the popular vote and was never indicted. Why wouldn't she be running exactly? You really think Biden is their big plan to take Trump down? Really?
Totally agree. To think they are all under threat of indictments and came up with Biden as an end game to take Trump out is ridiculous. His dementia probably wasn't so bad when they hatched this plan. The pandemic sure came in handy.
Yeah and if Biden was around during FDRs era, he would have screamed and hollered over FDR’s pro-people policies. Your point?

Hope it's in favor of Biden. But, I take your point, some "undecided" whites may sneak back to Trump if they feel threatened. It's pathetic, as I said. As a never-repub liberal for the last 51 yrs, I want to be counted among the non-a-hole whites who despise Trump &amp; GOP

House needs to compel his testimony even if it comes after Trump loses the election. Regardless, Don McGahn will be a key witness in Trump's criminal trial for #ObstructionOfJustice after Bill Barr is fired by President Biden. #JusticeIsComing
Both candidates are like the elderly uncles you only see on Thanksgiving. Tr#mp is the alcoholic child molester who is the reason you're estranged from your family. Biden is the one who means well, but can't keep up with the changing world. One is evil; the other is embarrassing.
legit proof that biden's running for president has to start materializing soon
This is why I cannot stand most of our men in our state. They are a bunch of pussies like biden. Its always us women standing up for what's right. Even in our Republican elected officials sit back and watch this. Never speaking up for their constituents.
meanwhile, Richard Shelby just announced the Senate isn't going to do appropriations this year for the first time since 1985. Just going straight to the continuing resolutions so we're all set for constant shutdowns under Biden.
Biden thinks he is better then them which I think is  worse. 🇮🇱🇺🇸🚔
Our swamp leaders in the republican party here in Oregon are doing the same as biden. Solomon yue is nothing but a joke.
Again, Joe Biden is one of those racists that thinks other races are beneath him. Not necessarily out to rid the world of those races, just thinks they are lower on the totem pole that his race and class.
biden is STILL losing primary districts to bernie, 2 months after dropping out &amp; now there's a panic that Kanye is going to take votes from him.  they know he's a shit candidate w/ nothing to vote FOR, they just want him to be the sole 'anti-Trump' choice &amp; get votes by default.

I don’t disagree.
Oh wow, I totally thought so too! Good to have confirmation though. That weird attempted mimicking of black speak that Biden does is so disrespectful and condescending!

A vote for Biden is a vote for eventual communism!
Little fact you Biden has  Not had 225 people at any one of his events.
I'm surprised I haven't seen more replies like this. Because Trump spouts some garbage, we're what? Expected to come to Biden's aid, support his faith, defend religion? Who cares?
It’s because Joe Biden is that powerful

So sick of Democrats giving Biden a pass ...its ok he said he didnt mean it...
He's part of the slient majority like many so called celebrities...you would be surprised on who votes for Trump vs Biden..
I think both candidates are shit options. But Biden will buy us time to find suitable Presidents 😊

Brian Williams has a sly, well modulated sense of humor. I enjoy it.

Yeah, that's the first thing I think of about Joe Biden. Joe Biden wears his Catholicism on his sleeve. He has been very forthcoming on what his religion means to him.  Shut up you moronic demon sperm.
Because Joe Biden is"Joe Biden."
My goodness picking biden or trump is getting insane there pretty equally bad.
Since #Biden can’t/won’t be allowed to debate, why not we just have 2016 Hillary/Donald Presidential debate #reruns?  Ohhhhhh those were GLORIOUS, 100% satisfying entertainment 🤩🤩🤩.  Throw in the 2016 Al Smith Roast and it’s golden 🤩✌🏽❤️ #BidenWho? #Trump2020
Biden will make Americans suffer again.
I was kind of "whatever" about Joe Biden. He seemed like a kind and decent man (yes with FLAWS)...but now I see a man who is blossoms under the pressure. He looks more confident, he seems to thrive when all Trump does is throw chaos. Joe Biden is not perfect. He is what we need.
...It may appear that way, but we already settled for less with Biden as our nominee. Harris is a generic brand moderate Democrat while only Warren and Bass are the true progressives left standing.

RUSH LIMBAUGH -  Racist Biden: Blacks Are All the Same, Have No Diversity of Thought
Biden was evil - now he’s just useless.
Biden is your people, Mr. “Boogaloo.”
Trump and Pence operate at the amygdala and Biden is appealing to our frontal cortex and hippocampus. Which system will win out?
There's a lot of things that shouldn't be necessary. Sadly, this is where we are right now. I'm definitely not just voting for Biden because I have a choice. Trump has already demonstrated what he'll do to people like me.
You won’t win anyone over w/ Trump’s nutty rantings about how  will hurt the Bible &amp; hurt God. No one who knows 1/10th of Biden’s story can deny that he is a man of great &amp; abiding faith. These attacks hurt Trump more than Biden. Knock it off.
Joe Biden: “Donald Trump is not fit to lead and be President.”                                Donald Trump: “Joe Biden wants to punch baby Jesus in the face.”                            Mike Pence: “160,000 COVID deaths is way less than the amount of aborted babies.”
No one is honestly going to claim that Biden isn't trash. There are many better options I wish we'd gotten. At this point, I'm not expecting anything at all from Biden except for him to not be Trump, so we can actually survive to 2024 and have elections for who we really want.
If Trump gets reelected I am 10x more ready to blame the people who fell for Biden as a candidate, ignoring ALL the red flags, than the progresssives who simply don’t vote for him. This was a really easy election to pick a decent candidate...
The most comical piece to me is Eric Trump broadcasting Biden's gaffes. That is his job now. Find a Biden slip up on a daily basis. Such a Fredo task. Apparently he does not watch daddy speak
Its quite clear you have nothing better to do than to push lies instead of truth.. Trump 2020 😁🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🙏💕🌹🌼🌻🌷🌺🌸🌼🌼God Bless America. Keep America Great Again.  What kind of President do you think you would have if you voted for Biden? LOL.  Bidens hiden in the basement😂

God hasn’t lead a Biden through. God has allowed it, just as He allows us each a Free Will to choose between right and wrong. Biden chooses the wrong when he promotes the slaughter of preborn babies.
God is very much opposed to Joe Biden promoting the slaughter of preborn babies.

Just visit a few churches and carry hot sauce    I’m sure you have “those people” all figured out.
Have you listened to Biden lately?
Those aren’t Joe’s blunders and gaffes. That’s what Biden actually thinks.
Yep......so who convinced Biden to run for President again ?!?
News outlets could just post “Trump did some other vile thing today” every day, and we’d all just nod and say “I’m sure he did” without needing to know what is was.  Biden could shoot somebody on 5th Avenue and I’d be over here like “was it Trump? Shrug.I’m still voting for him.”
So Joe Biden can come right out and say all black peoples think alike and that if you don’t vote for him you ain’t black and Trumps the racist ????????
Also there was something about hurting God and Biden and I don't want to know, do I?
My Statement on Faith. Like so many people, my faith has been… | by Joe Biden | Aug, 2020 | Medium

First things first. And that’s get Trump out of there. Your vote for the GP is a vote not for Biden. That was part of the problem in 2016.
I dont think he has a chance. Hes fighting himself and losing. Biden is literally dead. Running perfect campaign. Say nothing. As noncontroversial as possible. The middle of country saw Trump as lesser of 2 evils. Now they see Biden as that. Trump cant stay out of his own way
They are also inciting preplanned violence if Biden wins. But I'm sure intel knows about those too. I hope they are uncovering the identity of Americans that are falling for this propaganda. They may have to bust down a lot of doors before November 3rd.
Joe Biden slips up so much talking about the Black community. Always an insult, followed by a hollow apoplogy and a spin. If you think at this point it’s a slip of the tongue, you’re ignoring the facts. The dude DOES NOT LIKE BLACK PEOPLE. SMH

President Donald Trump billed his trip to Ohio Thursday as a chance to promote economic recovery, but he quickly pivoted to a deeply personal attack on Joe Biden, even questioning without foundation the former vice president's faith in God.

Let's all be supportive adults for whoever he picks and support the Biden/VP election like our lives depend on it!! Avoid falling into the trumpy type criticism.  We are better than that.  Let's shine and rise above this #nightmare.
Trump said: he, Biden hurt the Bible. He hurt God. This is bat-shit crazy. He’s saying he “is” GOD! We must believe Trump knows how God feels? Trump knows the emotions of ”God”, knows what God is feeling! This is insane! Blasphemer! How dare you speak for God!!! The Antichrist!
Seriously S.E.? So disappointing to hear this from you. If Biden picks a Zebra for VP I will STILL vote for him. This election is for America’s fukking survival! We don’t have the luxury to be picky or on “on the fence”. #TrumpWillKillUsAll
Hot take:  Trump says Biden is against god and will hurt god.  But also that Biden is against guns.  Then I have no choice but to believe Biden will punch God in the face with his bare hands and after the year we've had, I wouldn't blame him.  #hurtGod #withyourfists #likeaman
Use common sense about the big picture here.I really want to give you a moment to think about it.I have a video on my wall of things Biden said when COVID was first discovered in China. Don’t think for a min. people wouldn’t have died if he was president.
So Biden is saying the only black people capable of average diverse and creative intellectual ability (equal to him) are "notable exceptions" to the (otherwise stupid and worthless) black race?  And that at least Hispanics are almost as good as white people? What an ass!
Does the Senate committee using foreign documents to investigate Biden count as working with a foreign country to influence the election?
Voting is a private experience largely.  Protesting is a group experience you can share on social. Zoomers didn't come out in the primary for Bernie, why would the general be much different with Biden? (someone they're LESS enthusiastic about)
U R crazy if U bueve Biden will bring this country together. Americans wanr a strong President who can stand up to China and North Korea. We don't  trust Biden can think on his feet. We fear Bureaucratic  government contol.
What is this nonsense? I'm voting for Biden because his policies are better than Trump's. Why are you so much more offended by people saying Trump is bad than Trump actually being bad for this country?
So basically the Gop is using him to take votes from Biden to help Trump win...And Trumps acting like he's not in on it...
I agree. Hope that by the time, you decide to vote for Biden despite your reservations and living in a safe blue state. My reason for this hope is the every vote that makes the margin bigger is an additional kill signal to trumpism.
Get ready for "The crazy liberal Joe Biden voters accidentally take drugs instead of showing up for work and go crazy in the street" rhetoric
I used to love Dr. Savage. We’ve all seen Memes for weeks with the words “Hiden Biden”.  I guess we just let him think he invented it.
Biden could pick a tree stump and I’d vote for him.
How cute. Look....you're even wearing your "I was the little girl on the bus, Joe Biden you racist" t shirt. 🥰
You all do know this is not Joe Biden's account. It's one of his handlers flying High 🚑💨
In today's moment of stupid shit biden says..
"Literal pedophile", as if Trump isn't. Biden isn't good either. But if I'm talking about the lesser of two evils, I'm taking Biden any day. Neither of them are good politicians, nor good people. But Biden has potential for good, whereas Trump has proven he doesn't.
Darrell....because what Biden said is what he believes.   I’m more disappointed in Biden’s  ANGRY  question to the black reporter “has he been tested for taking cocaine”...just wow  and Biden hasn’t had ANY probing hard interviews yet, he’s living at home, sleeping in his own bed
I live to see "K-hive is upset" stories. I'd be happy thinking they kept quiet on Rice to let K-hive immolate. Rice is so Dick Cheney evil, even for Biden. Even for Strom Thurman's best friend Biden she's bad news.
Joe Biden cannot produce an original coherent thought.  If he's in charge we will surely become a slave to the socialists.  Trump 2020.
Counterpoint: I don't want to vote for Biden. The only other option is Trump. I will vote for Biden. Because that's how our political system works.
Do you really think Joe Biden wrote that lengthy statement.......??  Biden doesn’t have the stamina to be President or he would be holding small gatherings all across the country.   Meeting with supporters &amp; staff in each state  Meeting with businesses &amp; potential voters

Oh, don’t  forget make the earth flat, he’ll do that too. No more cruises post Biden!!

Why don’t Senate Republicans put more time toward this crisis and less time and tax payer $ trying to dig up dirt so Trump can use it 4 campaign purposes! How many more times are GOP going to investigate Biden’s? Why didn’t they call witnesses during Trump’s trial to find truth?
Let me be clear when  man says he likes kids Rubbing his Hairy Legs, love sniffing Girls and can’t complete an audible sentence, he is a pedophile and that is Joe Biden.
Biden isn’t the one tweeting white power videos.
Once again trump/Republican insanity. Biden will take your guns, will ban churches. Ban Bibles! I would bet money that Biden goes to church &amp; reads the Bible more than trump. I’ve read Dems are coming for your guns for 50 YEARS, never happened. Trump lies can not be truthful.
Thanks for the arm chair quarterback from the Obama/Biden admin. 😂🤣😂🤡
No matter who it is, the Biden/? team will be leaps and bounds better than who we have now.

Come-on man!  #Biden won't debate!  He will develope laryngitis at the last moment.  Kind of like the #virus appeared at the last moment.  #Trump's the real deal--promises made--promises kept.
When people say they're not sure about voting for Biden based upon his choice of running mate, that scares me! This election is hands-down the most important election in our lives (future generations too)! It's about saving democracy (Biden) v. authoritarianism (the GOP).
So either Biden is a senile old man who can’t put his pants on without pooping, or a God-killing warrior. He can’t be both.

Biden's a mushroom. Why would anyone vote for him?
Same on the Sanders and Biden bits, but would've chosen Warren too if there was a chance. Still, fuck this whole thing.
I’m struggling to think of anyone else Biden would select for Secretary of State however. She has much better conventional experience for that - she is absolutely NOT prepared for the Presidency on Day 1.
Those he said are less diverse? I don't understand the polls or party's insistence that people whose families he imprisoned adore him. I distrust Dem primary results after 2016. Really think it's less than advertised, but mail-in voting may be his savior. May he not be Joe Biden.
Woah Andre chill out. Not all Republicans are bad people. Don't generalize a whole group. Btw I will most likely be voting for Biden in November.
Biden is a devout Catholic. Donald is a charlatan. #NeverTrump #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace

Meanwhile Biden 's response
The difference between  and  , besides Biden having actual character and dignity, is that Biden has a known stutter, while Trump simply can't say anything without trying to brag or demean. I'll vote for Joe because he actually gives a shit about people.
Don’t forget Biden is “against energy.”
What a joke!  Joe Biden has been a practicing Catholic his entire life.  Trump holds a Bible upside down for a photo op.  I think one of the debates should be on the Bible! 🤣🤣🤣
Like you really believe Biden wrote that?? If you do I have some ocean front property in Nebraska I'd like to sell you.
Well if that’s a dealbreaker, Biden is not your guy for sure! Who’s the independent? Lol

You need to pull material from Biden/Ryan 2012 VP debate. Especially the troops issue. Is an eye opener.
I know it’s not a JRPG but this tweet put the image of a God of War mod that replaces Kratos with Joe Biden in my head, so there’s that
My take: Biden is saying the Dems have given up on courting black community for  votes bec Blacks are waking up to realize all the broken promises.  Now Dems are courting Hispanics &amp; will make the same promises, but will keep them suppressed &amp; never deliver. #ItsAboutTheVote
Imagine you're a country it isn't hard to do no guns aimed at us and no tear gas too Imagine all the people living life in peace  You can say I'm a dreamer I'm not the only one I hope someday you'll join us and vote for President Joe Biden.
Stand against gods word. That's what trump meant. He runs this country and is running for re election at the same time. Hes tired. Now explain Biden to everyone. Biden has dementia and denying that is dangerous and naive.
He meant stand against God smart one. Trump is running a country and tired, Biden has no excuse for his racist, mentally declining nature or pedophilia.
1 of 32,987 desparate lies about Biden spewed by stone cold losing liar.
It’s must be nice. Biden can say what ever he wants. The leftest media will cover for him.
You knew well what he meant by hurt God. He meant he stands against gods word.   Pretty easy to understand. Biden has no reason to be tired or mentally off.
You cannot be a catholic or any Christian and be for abortion. Biden is Catholic in name only.   #Biden #Catholic #AbortionIsMurder
That's why Trump MUST go!  Mike, you promised to help.  Biden needs all the help he can get.  Please keep your promise.😇
Except for he doesn’t have dementia like Joe Biden.
"Biden has permitted his League of Mediocre White Men to run around dinging up a group of trailblazing female politicians, most of them Black, all of whom have plied paths unimaginably more challenging than any taken by these men.... "  Amen. Part of me wants them all to say no.
Biden campaign responds to Trump's 'hurt God' attack: 'Biden's faith is at the core of who he is'  Only the uneducated and uninformed would believe that Trump is more religious than Biden.  I think Trump was talking about himself.  #ONEV1 #Biden2020 Z25
The funny thing is that while T was tear gassing church members outside their own church for a photo op, Biden was meeting with leaders of a predominantly Black church in Delaware to listen to their stories of pain and oppression.   But I’m sure God is very scared of Ol’ Joe.
Like seriously, does he actually know Joe Biden?
Bill Clinton is in basement with Biden
Me too. The only people who got their guns taken under Obama/Biden were crooks.
If you support Biden you act like a perfect gentleme, lot’s of romance, long courtship, honest discussions, sensitivity to feelings, gentility, many exquisite gifts, beautiful engagement and marriagerings Persons in groups you don’t like - “Hey Sis, wann sandwich?”
Biden is less racist. Biden hates the poor less. Biden has fewer criminal friends. Biden doesn't have white supremacist supporters and donors. Biden isn't Putin's lapdog. Biden is more coherent. Biden is less of a fraud. Biden isn't my 1st choice but Trump sure as hell is my last
I assumed they meant swing states.  And even then, while Bernie was in the race, Bernie won more swing states than Joe Biden (New Hampshire is also a swing). Once he dropped out, it’s obvious he wouldn’t continue to win states.
Don't you hate how Obama and Biden took all your guns and shut all your churches down?   Banned Christmas too! Not.
But a vote for Biden is a vote for this man....   Do please explain to me how you can justify this?
If you don't vote for biden you ain't black...I stand with the "ain't blacks" who don't need to get their identity approved by rich old white guys.
Only Biden can hurt Biden. He’s in a bunker.
Biden must be a badass if he can hurt God.🤣😇
It won't be a debate. It will be just you lying and berating Biden for an hour. We get enough of that from you already.
So has Biden earned your vote yet Doc?
This guy is so senile and corrupt he just rattles off his standard bullshit, forgetting WHO he's campaigning against-a devout Catholic who never tried to take away guns or suppress religion. Unlike Trump, Biden had the power in the Senate to push things thru, &amp; do them as VP.
Trump Is Anxious That Joe Biden Is Going To Pick Kamala Harris For VP -
Don’t be willfully ignorant. Joe Biden is still being inappropriate in 2020.
I want him to run so we have another option when trump and Biden kill each other in a duel,  'cause #2020
I don't think Biden will win. Most think that his VP is the one who will take over sooner or later. He's a puppet. He also has some sort of a deal with Bernie to get the Bernie Bros on board. They are making deals, which will determine how hard Bernie &amp; AOC campaign for him.
So should Democrats get Micky Mouse to run as a Republican? Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden
PERFECT combination. A Biden/Obama ticket– a remix of the Obama/Biden ticket that got us Trump!  Absolutely brilliant. 👏
Ok, Biden ads continuously lie about Trumps plans with CV. Waiting for that to be corrected. Time to get into the courts against Biden Pacs.
Biden's Catholic?
HRC was 12 points ahead of Trump in august 2016 and Biden is only up 8 on average now. If his best strategy is to not campaign then the dems should switch him out at the convention that he's already not even going to.
Your argument could equally be applied to Biden’s sexual assault allegation(s)
We all know that daddy is Putin's Puppet Butchwax leave Biden put of it Putin has been pulling daddy's strings since 2015
so, what you are saying is that Joe Biden is such a powerful man that he can do just about anything? Sounds like the kind of man I want for my president.
Exhibit 1  Why Biden will not be attending the convention in Milwaukee.
I never considered voting for Biden until now.
If Joe Biden shuts his fucking mouth until November he will win the election.
There are some blue states that I don’t think are safe for Biden, either, this time around.  He’s really that bad of a candidate.
#plumptrump on Biden: "Take away your guns, destroy your second amendment, no religion, no anything. Hurt the bible, hurt God. He's against God, he's against guns." Seriously. How do you connect God and guns together like this? Shameful argument, poorly communicated.
we’re not gonna have any WINDOWS? Oh no, whatever will we do? Biden will hurt GOD? Hmmmm I did not think that was possible.
Biden phone banking looks like:
Biden has to review all these cases, whoever is AG. Hope it's someone like Sally Yates.  Reprehensible racism and injustice.
Regardless of who Biden chooses, Spanky is going to pitch a hissy fit
I beat cancer due to the great doctors and care I got at the Cleveland Clinic.  I think we can beat the cancer in the WH with the will of a blue wave and the care of Joe Biden to lead us through it.
Biden’s racism was on full display with his most recent comments about the differences between the black and Hispanic communities.
Joe Biden:He’s been in office for half a century but now he’s ready to get things done. 🙄 no thanks Joe. We’re done paying you for nothing.
Nevada wasn’t a state Biden needed? Interesting concept.
This is going to crash on Biden and people will be too stupid to understand.
Perhaps  is just projecting every time he says Biden is gonna be like FDR?
“He’s against energy.”— Donald J. Trump referring to Biden. Trump is delusional. He is truly a danger to America.
Can trump show me on the doll where Biden “hurt god?”
So did I. It was a completely baseless tweet based on nothing.  Side note, here’s this from Biden’s texts: sure sounds like Liz to me, Kamala’s fundraiser didn’t raise shit!
To all you dem supporters who has their heads so far up their ***** I hope you can pull back out before it's too late! I may not have much time left but most of you do have time and you think it's bad now, if Biden wins your life won't be yours anymore!
"Come on man," why the hell wouldn't he take the test?! And to be so defensive...seriously, why would anyone choose this mess for president?
It is ignorant statements like this that degrade our school system. Like you can only change the federal constitution, our next president Biden cannot take away guns
Live and let live.  Vote for Joe Biden. #JoeBiden2020.
Most dangerous?? 🤣 Receipts pls.   &amp; what happens when Biden is horrible, makes everything worse and we get a worse Trump in 24?  Than what? Keep voting blue?  You playing a rigged game dummy.
Ahh yes the three G’s that Biden is against: God, Guns and enerGy
He fixed it right away ...did he call a bacl reporter if he is a junkie? Nope that was Biden
Oh but he isnt racist.... nope.   * I've tried uploading this and Twitter literally deleted it.*   " #Biden2020 " (NOT)! #Biden #BidenIsARacist
Yet, you'd let him get re elected if Biden's running mate doesnt tickle your fancy. You're either stupid or disengenuous. Either way bye.
every Biden's "speach" is about Trump is bad...??? I bet you love Biden's rallies 🤡.
“It’s the first time I’ve ever voted for a Democrat,” he says in the video. “But if Joe Biden drops out and the DNC runs a tomato can, I will vote for the tomato can, because I believe the tomato can will do less harm than our current president.”

Actually, Antifa and people on the far left do not support either Biden or Trump. And Biden isn't even far left to begin with.   Maybe do a little factual homework so you don't sound so ignorant or get proven wrong in the future.  I know your president doesn't either. But try.
If you are in the Stock Market... understand this-  They will deliberately CRASH the market if Biden wins.  So, you might want to liquidate before the  snakes play their usual game - and PUNISH the country for electing a Democrat.
And now Biden is trying to steal President Trumps America First agenda. 🤣🤣
Yup.  Old friend is a very very devout Irish Catholic.  He likes Biden, just thinks he breaks with the church on some issues.
The article doesn't mention Biden or any affiliation to Biden or his campaign. It also doesn't actually identify if the person burning "items" (as stated in the caption) is actually a Biden supporter or a Proud Boy trying to blend in with the crowd.
Did Biden really just say "ALL BLACK PPL THINK ALIKE"  FFS...  This guy is a fucking clown.   This is the best you got democrats?  Fuck off.   #NEVERBIDEN
Biden will resign in day two if he wins.  Hillary will be President some how.  This is 2020 after all.
Why does Biden use that 70's urban street voice when speaking to black reporters?  "C'mon man" it's embarrassing.
Democrats can change the nominee if they want. They’ve argued that in court. And why you talking to me? Shouldn’t you be phone banking for Biden?
The President has every right to deliver a campaign speech!! And Biden deserves what he gets!! YOU SUCK ACOSTA!!
It's BS and this is not an actual photo of a Biden campaign event.   Actual footage of Biden campaign event
Remember when Joe Biden couldn’t pronounce “mental fitness” like a day ago? 🤣
After every mispronunciation, Trump doubles down on his attacks about Joe Biden's mental acuity. It's projection writ large!
I would vote for Biden, even if he got caught snorting coke of a dead pirates leg at Motel 6🤔🦠🦠🤔
Yesterday an angry Joe Biden called a Black CBS reporter a cocaine user and a 'junkey.'
Exactly.  Next cycle? There's room to talk and debate.  This cycle? Hell no, Trump gotta get out, only way to do that is Biden, unfortunately.
Oh my taking two different events and making up your own story.  This isn’t about Trump or Trumps age. This about Joe Biden, No one has voted yet and this is a big question mark in many minds. He should put it to rest.
Biden hit in the head and dosed with grain alcohol, Trump hit in the had and dosed with a 24 pack of original recipe Coca Cola.  Get your analogies right, ben.
Yeah, other things I didn’t even realize in this moment was how he made efforts to silence his own delegates.  And how he continues to call Biden’s policy FDR-like. It’s laughable and sad at the same time.
NY Attorney General obviously got her orders , it appears Ukraine got Joe Biden listed in a court of law for being investigated for criminal activity, No wonder NY AG is throwing out another witch hunt! It’s all to cover up Bidens mess with Ukraine !
Seriously, it's time to exercise your rights under the second amendment. If Biden wins, you will not have any protections guaranteed. Remember, the Dems do not value life and are willing to let antifa do their dirty work.
3/ He could have done all of that without jeopardizing anything. Maybe he’d lose his senate seat? Fine. It’s time to retire then. At least he could have retired knowing he did everything he possibly could.  Instead, he’s selling us Biden as if Biden’s FDR 🙄
And Joe Biden is still in the basement. America needs DEBATES.
Just out OAN just reported Ukraine listed Joe Biden as under criminal investigation! Wow it’s all coming out now!
Trump is running against a man who can hurt God? Maybe Trump should get ahold of his priorities immediately lest he and his followers enrage the Omnipotent Biden!
Now I'm racist? 😂🤣🤦🏼‍♀️ You have issues. Biden is the real racist yet, that doesnt matter because, "if you dont vote for me you ain't black." -Biden
Fox News since your Biden lovers OAN just reported Joe Biden is listed in court as being under criminal investigation! Phone calls,bribe using Gov, money being held if they didn’t fire the man whom was investigating Bursima,Hunter Biden! Pretty bad Fox News drops the ball again!
Sorry Biden says no.
And to me my biggest question was “why now” and why at the point he did.  Another part of me wants to also believe it was to protect everyone’s health since Biden was encouraging people to stand in line to vote in a pandemic, which was about the same time as his decision.
These people have let themselves be duped into thinking Harris is a true progressive. Sure she’s more progressive than Biden, but that’s not saying a lot, and he’s moved TO THE LEFT of her on certain issues with his new agreed upon, Sanders-endorsed platform
Charlotte this simply isn’t true. Using a bunch of scoring sites with bad algorithms to name Harris as a progressive is disingenuous at best and an outright lie at worst. Look at Harris’ record next to Warren’s, and then next to Biden’s, and you’ll see she’s pretty close to Biden
Big news just out Joe Biden is listed in a investigation for criminal activity in Ukraine high court the firing of the man whom was investigating Burisma an Hunter Biden ! So America has a Presidential candidate under invention for crimes while being VP! OAN just reported!
Does mean that pro Biden and all the bad shit that comes with that.
Lol you people! Biden don't leave his basement and is incapable of completing the full sentence.
Almost as if Hillary threatened Bernie with his life per her usual MO.   Just a hunch but it could also be because he came to the same conclusion as us — the Democratic Party was going to stop him at all costs — and he perceived Donald Trump to be more dangerous than Biden.
Well, Biden is Fonz well grown up.
Sorry. It’s not fake news. He said it.
You're foolish if that's your comeback. Do explain how trump is racist and how Biden isnt. Keep in mind bidens long history of racist policies and actions and people he supported (including the head of the kkk). 😉
Oh go ahead &amp; vote 4 Trump....if Biden's VP pick is the 1 thing that keeps U from voting 4 Biden just get off the fence on the right... hoping 1 of the fence boards goes up UR ass.  My latest 4  I want 2 vote 4 Biden. It will come down to his veep pick.
You know a candidate is totally desperate when he accuses his rival of being against God. I can't imagine who dafuq is so dense that they would believe that about a lifelong devoted Catholic like Joe Biden.
Does anyone think herr fuhrer will give Biden the intelligence briefing presidential nominees get? This I been on my mind a lot lately. I don't see him doing it.
Actually trumps reelection is looking good. No one really likes Biden anymore than they liked Clinton. 🤷🏼‍♀️
and yet a candid photo of Biden praying
Trumps trying to paint Biden, a devout Roman Catholic, as being anti-religion. He even had to correct himself when challenged in an interview by saying "Well a lot of people around him are."  More political theater.
Why?  trump / pence are worse than anyone Biden could pick as his VP
Never Trump is the same as vote Biden. Grow up.
Let’s be real. It’s not just Joe Biden! We would ALL hurt God if we could get away with it! But it just doesn’t work like that!
Ummm, I like to fantasize too, but  #ThatIsNonsense. You're definitely getting either Biden or Trump. Choosing not to participate is a choice, with an outcome, and that outcome will either be Trump or Biden.
Joe Biden could show up to an interview wearing a KKK uniform, carrying a can of gas and a cross and the media wouldn't say a thing.  President Trump helps minorities get jobs and prosper and the media calls him a racist.🤔

I live in a district that ridiculously stretches from Delaware to half of Zanesville, but on the NYT funding counts by ZIP, Biden’s doing better in about half of it because it is so riggingly large. Biden by no means has to win Ohio, but it would all guarantee a win if he does.

As most of my followers know I'm just a simple man. So I'm going to keep this real simple. It's no mystery that the Democratic party has taken advantage of the blind loyalty of Black voters for decades. The ultimate proof of that is a vote for Biden. You're making it too easy.🤔
That aside, what gets me most here is that it's one thing for Kasich to be featured in the line-up of a kind of "Americans united for Joe Biden" virtual campaign rally / TV special. I can quarrel with that but it's at least a concept that can stand up to initial examination.
Randy Quaid to Joe Biden: "In the words of my generation: Up yours!"
This has to be satire right? Comrade is how Communists call each other the #NoComradesUnder1k aimed at communist/socialist/leftist so of course, it's full of Sanders and Green Party supporters that dislike Biden.
Fortunately, Biden is ethical. He may not be right 100% of the time (who is?) but I have no doubt that he will put this country over his own financial interests.
Tell that to racist Biden
Biden should ask China to find trumps missing tax returns just to watch the GOP EXPLODE.
Did Trump just come to Cleveland and accuse Biden of being against God? Yes...he did.
early 2000s dirtbag biden is a great bit
Trump's Rant About How Joe Biden Will Kill God Was Insane But Clarifying  via
Both political parties are responsible for mass incarceration. Biden is not solely responsible.
Ofcourse the Russians dnt want Biden to win
Was there any doubt in any sane person's mind that Biden was always the front man for Obama and his crew?  himself said he was disappointed that he ran out of time to "transform" America and since the coup failed,  needed a Plan B. Joe is Plan "B"!
Trump Told Ohio Biden Will Hurt God With ‘Live Or Let Die’ As His Anthem
I don't really want joe biden to win, but I do want trump to lose, so 🤷
Can Biden ban Trump Hotels by Executive Order? Asking for private companies everywhere.
The Kasich idea is still terrible but I sympathize greatly with this person:  “We want to have as few elected officials as possible,” said one Biden adviser. “Every one of these politicians — they give them three minutes but then they take 15."
I mean obviously it’s pandering to his deeply evangelical base but are they really ~that~ far removed from reality they think biden hates god? there’s never been an anti religious president and I kinda doubt there ever will be
i’m curious where trump is getting his unhinged “biden will abolish religion and god” shit like nothing remotely about biden’s campaign is anti religious lol
Everyone on this thread: Biden can't win Ohio.  Ohio:
This is the official Biden Trump dirt bike jump song
Trump made a speech not long ago &amp; does all the time really without notes or a teleprompter while interacting with others. Biden can’t get through a free sentences. People need to stop letting their hatred for Trump lead them to a tragic vote. You want Joe to have nuclear codes?
I meant Jill Biden. Either which way this is their way of getting Joes image out there while still hiding him out. Is bullshxt!
Alright everyone  is all paid up and officially a corporate sponsor of my upcoming dirt bike jump over the Biden Trump debate in Cleveland thank you for your support
Mark my words, when Joe Biden names his VP, the right will aim to make the race solely about her. Biden has proven too tough an opponent so they will go with the whole "she's only a heartbeat from the president and she is literally Fidel Castro-Hitler only worse."
I cant wait for Biden to win, then call you all out when he offers up a "thoughts and prayers aren't good enough " when god forbid something bad happens
Biden the Ultimate Risk – Are Votes Tools in the Hands of the Free, or Weapons in the Hands of Haters?
Do you realize: He has NO Faith in any religion so keeping it private is a moot point; he dragged Biden’s Faith (which he regularly displays) into a political lie; and that the point of the interview was to prove exactly how unreligious he is. Stop defending the indefensible!!!
I can vote for Biden if he chooses anyone for VP BESIDES Susan Rice or Karen Bass
#FoxNews needs to get rid of  there is no place for someone on their network that makes excuse after excuse about #JoeChina AKA  #Racist comments #Biden has a 50 year history of being a Racist. Do some homework #JessicaTarlov
What if Joe Biden doing that?!!
At least one of them told it like it is and it sure wasn't  #Biden is a racist and this lady pointed it out perfectly, what does #Tarlov do she defends him.
One of the most bias people ever to be on #FoxNews is  she knows #Biden is a giant #Racist and she still tries to defend his Racist comments. Open your eyes #Tarlov you're a closed minded moron.....
What was hunter Biden doing in Moscow??
BTW... how about quoting some of the many many horrible things that your guy Trump has said. Its easy to quote the things Biden has said because there's so few. With Trump let's start with him saying about White supremacists, 'there are good people on both sides.'
im from Ohio and im ridin with biden
If someone has already decided not to vote for Trump, they would then vote for Biden, unless they had an additional choice. That's the game  and  are playing. Kanye has millions of followers and many don't understand the power votes.
Huh, I thought that social media was supposed to be biased against conservatives??? But what do we have here? It looks like Instagram is biased against Biden.   Where is the #ConservativeOutrage at political bias in social media?
Trump Told Ohio Biden Will Hurt God With ‘Live Or Let Die’ As His Anthem
Today they sent me a video about settling for Biden that was set to the tune of "Go Go Go Joseph." I've never felt more seen.
They’re not close to the same. I’m conservative so clearly Biden isn’t ideal but he’s not a narcissist + he’ll be willing to listen/act on his advisors/experts he puts in place to help him. Trump has his message if advisor disagrees he/his people undermine and attack the expert.
Foreign Press is Seriously Questioning Biden’s Cognitive Ability
You know with the other two, we arent getting anything we want. Kanye is probably crazy enough to actually rubber stamp something positive into existence. With trump amd biden, we already know what we get. A giant shit sandwich.
you keep jumping back and forth man ... this is what liberals and people without facts do . they can’t stay focused for 30 seconds .   biden probly did launder money through the ukraine man . which means HE SHOULD be investigated . which means the “favor “.... is just justice .
Biden's clean energy push resonates in Senate battlegrounds
When you hear Right wing media a swear that they make Biden seems like the Devil.
I do believe the riffles will be safe under Biden hahaha
I AM JOE BIDEN AND APPROVE THIS MESSAGE:
Regardless of what you might think, we only have two choices this Nov. Joe Biden or trump. A vote for Kanye, a write-in, or a Didn’t Vote are all helping trump. Can you justify participating in the final destruction of our democracy? If not, you Must vote for Joe.  #Biden2020
One source said  would appear on the same night as  "early in the week in a demonstration of unity. The duo would be designed to showcase a broad anti-Trump coalition that is backing Biden."
Liar! Biden doesn’t want to take our guns. He thinks we might need them for protection from your secret police force!
Joe Biden is the Democratic presidential candidate America deserves.  Note: America is consistenly on some trash as evidenced by the fact that we elected lifetime failure, reality show personality, and Oompa Loompa - Donald Trump - as POTUS
the last time this man was near a church people were gassed!  To attack Joe Biden on his religion is BEYOND THE PALE!  Can you honestly say you made the right vote on impeachment?  You both deserve to be voted out of office!
Ya joe Biden is the answer. Easy to point out people’s faults and act like you would of had a plan. Raise the F out of taxes to support more people to sit at home. Along with supporting another stimulus to encourage more to sit at home. I’ve heard from people what they make. Joke
So Meg puts out a video y’all don’t like and now y’all back to roasting her🤣🤣🤣🤣🤷🏾‍♂️I wish it could be that easy to get everybody off the Biden train like that.
But she will be judged far less harshly than a nonbinary person would be judged. Biden needs to pick a nonbinary running mate.
This is absolutely the wrong position. Either vote for Biden regardless of his VP choice, or risk four more years of the grand finale of America as the greatest nation on earth.
Compare the campaigns’ websites. Biden’s includes tons of detailed policy proposals. Trump’s doesn’t say anything in particular about what he would do with a 2nd term. There is no comparison.
Interesting. Joe Biden told me that means you aren't black
Just look back at everybody who told us to get over everything Biden says. “Shut the hell up and grow up” “He’s the only way to beat Trump” He knows he can say anything and he’ll get support from the elite corporate democrats and the easy to sway Biden Bros🤷🏾‍♂️
I see so many in the comments drinking Biden’s kool side. There’s no defense on what he said that’s why he apologized. It’s obviously how he thinks. Imagine what he says privately. And don’t come at me with Trump. His wrongs don’t make Biden right
He is you don’t see it !  Biden is the son of Lucifer which is Barry Obama  ,,
That it’s Joe Biden and you hate Joe Biden
As Dr. King clarified for us all, an “eye for an eye” leaves everyone blind. We’ve become a nation of the blind leading the blind. Open your eyes. VOTE BIDEN. #Biden2020
traveling to 2014 to tell my past self that in 2020 every home in shaker heights will have a “black lives matter” lawn sign displayed right next to a joe biden lawn sign,

Trump Told Ohio Biden Will Hurt God With ‘Live Or Let Die’ As His Anthem
"Kanye West indicates that his spoiler campaign is intended to hurt Biden"    Oh? You don't say...
Because Joe Biden is racist.
Imagine he’s in one of the talks with China or Russia or whoever and he has one of stupid outburst and starts talking off-the-wall they will laugh at us they won’t take Biden seriously how could anyone think that is the right move to make
#JoeChina AKA  "You ain't black if you vote Trump" contrasting #AfricanAmerican, Latino diversity". "You can't go to a 7-11 without an Indian accent". How #racist is this guy? #Biden is almost a #WhiteSupremacist
Why Is Joe Biden Silent on the Attacks Against Catholic Statues, Churches, and Beliefs?
Does it matter though? The DNC chose Biden as the nominee and made sure he "won", despite no organization to speak of and no tangible support. They must think the same is possible (or already assured) in November.
Not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump and four years of uncontrolled kleptocratic dictatorship. Don’t again vote for the Russia backed Jill Stein spoiler candidate.
Amazing..   I have cone to a conclusion that Biden will have to back out in a week or two... new candidates named at convention ... excitement by dems of course .. but no results on election night will be the beginnings of Nancy trying to drag Potus out of WH. Not habbening !
I don’t give a crap if Biden even forgets his own home address. We can’t have 4 more of this shitshow.
Mr. President  #JoeChina AKA  has a nearly 50-year history of being a #Racist this is his true belief. How many #AfricanAmerican were incarcerated as a direct result of his Crime bill? No Doubt about how #Biden is racist ask #LeoTerrell and #LarryElder
PLEASE don’t vote for him or write in a vote for him. He’s trying to take votes away from Biden. This is not ok
Me too, and they’re absolutely right.
if biden is corrupt ... perhaps ... he should be investigated... and ... the president is the head of the branch of govt that enforces the law bro .... 😂

Biden says he would stop border wall construction if elected president
Electing Biden will cause the Dems to lose both the house and senate in 2022.
I agree he’s not going away.   His ego would never allow that.  But what is the impetus for staying with a guy who may have been repudiated by 10 points or more?  Barring a Biden melt down, I just don’t see a reason for discipline to suddenly manifest in Trump and tighten this.
Lmaoooo this was a good one. Between him and Biden I get all the comedy I need these days. Idk how I’m supposed to pick just one let’s just put both in there n see what happens. Dual presidents, double trouble
If Biden loses they'll blame the leftists, but if they win they'll ignore any idea supported by leftists.  Mark my words.

Joe Biden is a CLOWN 🤡
Sounds like one of the first pardons for Biden to grant along with Reality Winner.
that’s def fair. have seen folks bitching about AOC these days (i mean look she endorsed biden, can we even trust her)
Yeah says the true blue Biden supporter. I’m sure you would give  President Trump the same benefit of the doubt right?...lol
This is crazy, I hate biden almost equally. But it's hard to imagine another 4 years of just heading toward facism at lightspeed under trump. Or it could be on a river boat casually with Joe. It's like the right only knows the 2nd amendment exists,  the rest dont matter
That lady would blow trump or biden out of the water in a debate. I'm sorry but like her or not, she is 10x as smart as either if those career ladder climbing ass kisses. She would tear them up with just words.
People trying to shame people for not loving Biden is dumb.
All as I heard was biden saying black people dont have culture. which is not only not true, but really stupid. How are we seriously electing old white guys,  that are so far out of touch with the world. I want someone who has a glimpse of normal life as a leader. Fucking biden.
Yeah, I think that's fair. Hadn't considered that.  Though, I hope you can admit Trump's resume in the "comments degrading/harming/marginalizing minorities/poor people" is a LOT longer/bulkier than Biden. Probably why he's held to a different standard on the topic.   Right?
Maybe if Biden promises not to hurt God Kayne will back off?
Trump hadnt completed a coherent sentence in 4 years and dont get me started on the lies.. My point is that even with Biden the way he is. he is still more competent than Trump, and that truly is a sad tbing gor our country
“There will not be another foot of wall construction in my administration,” Biden said. (via Fox News)
Get it right. Biden “clarified.”  He did NOT apologize.
biden dirt ..... you mean the bidens laundering billions of tax dollars ? does biden get a pass for some reason ?
Let's make a list of trump's divisive statements and compare. I'll put my money on Biden.
One more time: "Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly diverse attitudes about different things," #Biden said
I can't stand seeing Trump signs where at one time the vote was blue collar, union worker blue, but I'm also seeing Biden signs in places I haven't expected. Exaggerating what's wrong isn't realism, it's as skewed as an overly rosy view. Effective organizing requires clarity.
If they don't like Biden, they probably weren't voting for him in the 1st place and now they're not going to vote for Trump. Mission accomplished!
YOU HAVE NO CLUE AND YOU TOTALLY DISRESPECT AND UNDERESTIMATE AFRICAN AMERICANs' INTELLIGENCE AND DEPTH.  Big surprise there, huh?   AND Mr. Biden CLARIFIED what he was stating.   YOU NEED TO STOP YOUR EVILNESS.  NOW, IS THE TIME FOR YOU TO BE BEGGING FOR GOD'S MERCY.  REPENT!
Another crazy cat lady for Biden.  Does inhaling cat crap fumes turn you into a liberal Democrat
This just in:  Joe Biden has tested positive for being a closet racist. So sad to hear. Probably will never make a full recovery from this. Thoughts and prayers
Biden’s comments are. Trump mispronunciations is not. True.
how stupid do you think we are?  You are becoming an insult to the American people.  CNN avoids on-air coverage of Biden's 'Are you a junkie?' remark about taking a cognitive test  #FoxNews
If you put away your bias for a minute you can easily find the 30 years of Biden’s racist history.  It’s not hard to find.
Yeah, Biden said all that. It was demeaning. Trump didn’t. Does that clarify it for ya?
Honest question, not snark - would she want to do this / say nice things about Biden / the party? I know it wasn’t her who had the “Hillary sucks” quote a few months back, but wasn’t sure how in lock step she was with the Squad.

Preach brother!!! I wholeheartedly want Biden to just STOP talking without speaking, if that is the reason for these public incidents of “misspeaking”. I loved him during President Obama’s years in office. This is all so disheartening to watch. Like, why bring us up???

. Chris Wallace joins  at 8:20 on the possibility of adding another #Debate2020 #Trump vs #Biden
And there we have it: a synopsis of the entire Biden campaign.
Joe Biden has a big mouth on the loose lipped you imagine someone that doesn’t know where he is doesn’t know what he still doesn’t know how he’s doing it to keep secrets for the government I just can’t see it and if American votes for him I just can’t see how they could do that
Apart from the message (which clearly also was a flub), now you see why the Dems have kept Biden hidden.  Stammering. Blinking. Seemingly forgetting where he's going. Trump is going to have a field day with this.
I saw what you were saying about President Trump saying Biden was against God of course he speaking to his base there what you’re allowed to do politics are dirty but Democrats did it to themselves did you forget about this?
Racist? Trump? Did you hear Biden’s race comments yesterday? He is the racist. Trump has done FAR more for minorities than any president in a long time. If Trump is a racist then he isnt a very good one. #Opportunities
Racist are you seriously that far out of touch Bill? No one has done more for minorities than Trump. You ever hear Biden speak? No one is a bigger racist than him.
(2/2) goldmine of untapped voters.  Would you get the word out to employers to help their employees register to vote and then make it easy for them to vote on Nov 3?  I’m expanding my efforts outside of my workplace to help even more young people register.  #Dogs4Biden #Biden
Oh yeah, Biden and the other democrats have good reason to take black votes for granted. There is never any scrutiny of these politicians among black voters. Democrats have little reason to value the black vote because we give it to anyone with a D next to their name so easily

Me, my family and the majority of my friends will be voting for Biden in  O H I O!!! 🙌
Woke up.  Trump still in office, smh.  Just donated to the Biden Campaign.  May not be much $, but every time I am able, I do.
Yeah that’s the kind of old white man crap that makes me not like him that much. That doesn’t make him a white nationalist. Again Biden was far down my list of Democrats i would’ve liked to see nominated. That still puts him lightyears beyond Trump

I don't want Joe Biden at all, not him and not his cognitive test!!! #VoteRed!!!
I think it’s bullshxt that Fox is letting Tom Steyer &amp; Jill Stein basically campaign for Joe Biden on their show. That’s some sneaky backward shxt! Then they show Joe driving his Jag tryin to look hip &amp; relatable? Was it even him driving it? They let him drive?🙄
Joe Biden sells out to whoever will give him money whoever will promise to vote that’s his standards that’s why we must vote for Trump in the fall he’s not for sale
Corruption at its finest. via. ⁦
Your talking Biden right? Bc at least Trump can put a sentence together, actually talk at length without forgetting, bumbling &amp;  losing his lines ..
From the left? Bullshit. We critiqued Biden harder than anybody.
My point is the fact regardless of what you think of Trump, the message during the campaign to drain the swamp of career politicians, appealed to a lot of people. Biden embodies the swamp.
The old Biden looks nothing like the new Biden. Pay attention
Does anyone have a dirt bike I can borrow to jump over the Biden Trump debate coming up in Cleveland?
I would rather have a blunt President than sneaky quiet snake Biden. Biden has been in office for over 40 years, nothing great happened in America. If you don’t agree with me, then please tell me what America has accomplished in 40 years.
Joe Biden, like Tom Ridge (a REPUBLICAN ALSO FROM PENNSYLVANIA) is a CATHOLIC.   And pro - choice as well.   And someone who struggled with a SPEECH (and hearing) problem his whole life.   Keep it up, Pence.  Even the southern Christians are going to be voting for Biden soon!!

Joe Biden will never debate Trump
Anyone who genuinely respects and honors God recognizes how deeply sacrilegious it is to attack another person’s relationship w God. I hope Biden will rise above this. He’s LIVED his faith through lifelong action.❤️ actions demonstrate the hypocrisy of his words
I’m sorry but Bush era Republicans slobbering over Joe Biden makes me sick.
Happens. Even if Biden was in a coma, he’d do less damage than Trump.  I’ve come to terms that one of our preferred candidates can’t win the Presidency. Just the nature of a singular executive election.  Legislatures are our best tool.
There’s only one person’s death I check for first thing every day and it ain’t Biden.
Though I've always been afraid of what happens if Biden dies after we vote early🤷‍♂️
Every day, in every way,  proves he is unfit to lick Biden’s boots. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace

Not necessarily, everything you posted I haven't received. Plus, why would you get continuous emails to something you never signed up for or support. I didn't get emails from the campaign until I signed up for them. With Biden that was through misclicking while browsing the net.
Haven’t seen any debates yet let alone more. Biden will look the fool if they ever happen.
So “you ain’t black” was just Biden stereotyping in a “weird way”? False dude, racial identity politics is racist.

Uh... You know that I get Biden spam too, right? It ain't just Trump. This is kind of part of campaigning.
This was a crazy man speech. Instead of discussing what would help them. Trump went on and on about Biden and Obama. How they took companies from the 🇺🇸. Idiot. He has not got them back nor will he.
Joe Biden was at the Royal’s game!
I really don't get why this process was dragged out this long. We all know who it's going to be at this point. It really hasn't changed in months now. I told folks it was going to be Biden/Harris if he got the nomination...like a year and a half ago. She's not my top choice, but

Only you JOSE BIDEN!
WAY TO GO JOSE BIDEN!
While I agree this headline is terrible, your answer was odd. Everyone knows a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for trump. That means writing in a candidate, voting for a third party, or not voting at all is a vote for trump. Biden is our only ticket off this ride.
Way to go JOSE BIDEN!
She is a hard core Republican. My guess is she won't vote for Biden. Even if she did. She would not say to the last minute.
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for these corrupt assholes to be running your country
She was too busy backing Bloomberg's efforts to swarm Sanders so she could get on a short list for VP for Biden... whoops.

Weird how Joe Biden went straight for the cocaine drug test and accusing someone of being a junkie. It's like he has personal familial experience with cocaine abuse.
When are we going to find out that you're spying on the Biden campaign? You're always projecting, so we're bound to find that out sooner or later.
Get the debates moved to Biden’s basement!!
In 1977, Joe Biden warned that without “orderly integration,” his children would grow up in “racial jungle, with tensions built so high that it is going to explode at some point.”   He was against court-ordered busing to desegregate public schools.
By the time the OH primary happened, Biden was the only one left standing. I would not have voted for Warren.  I don't trust Warren's middle-age political epiphany. She changed her tune long AFTER she was wealthy. Warren blows smoke (signals) up people's asses. Can't stand her.
Yes it is. It is no way communism.
What. I truly think there is only one communism. That is not that. It far from it.
Stop spewing your crap Biden when you know it's the right thing to do! I'm surprised you even got anything out of your mouth but oh yah you typed that and it probably took you an hour too!
In Biden’s basement
Jill Biden wouldn’t go on a real show like Tucker Carlson. He always asks tough questions.
I need both of them to debate three times!!! If Biden refuses to debate, he loses by default...America needs to see these two men debate and SOON!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I see its a Biden debate chair
SO ARE FAKE PRESIDENTS.  VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN NOVEMBER 3RD.
In the minds of many, Biden is supposed to bring about change for the better. Voting for him, and then that change not happening will expose him for who he is to those people.   It's like why Pelosi won't bring M4A or a GND to a vote.   Once Biden wins, you ratchet up the protest
Trump is still better because Biden is a hollow shell who will be directly controlled by radical leftists who will run roughshod over America. Trump is probably being advised by his campaign to be careful with November not far off.
Stop with the damn testing. Do you feel sick? If the answer is no, don’t get a test. The testing is just adding to the insanity. Obama and Biden told the CDC during swine flu, which was “novel” at the time, to stop testing, because we already knew we were in the epidemic…
The multi-state "Harass Biden Campaign" stopped in Canton to dissuade Christian voters from former vice president Joe Biden. The anti-abortion activists also want a federal law outlawing abortion.
Randall Terry Terry said the goal of his campaign - other than preventing Biden from becoming president - is a federal law to outlaw abortion.
Haha! I just ran thru the same neighborhood this morning and noticed at least 3 more Biden signs. Also 1 Trump-Pence sign. Which makes it about 9-1 in a precinct that was 50-50 last time. Maybe the Trump voters are shy? 🤨 I’ll look out for those 🇺🇸 pallets next!
Biden all the way!! 💙💙
A recent statewide "Your Voice Ohio" poll indicates former vice president Joe Biden is leading President Trump in Ohio. Let's see how they stack up in Stark County:
I heard two old men talking about if Biden wins, socialism's taking over America. It's like they've never paid attention to anything he's ever said.
Why does it matter who Biden picks? He could pick the scoopings of a porta-potty and I’d still walk over broken glass in bare feet to vote for him.
Only strong black men are against Biden
So we should accept inevitable massive job losses &amp; hope that  “green jobs” you speak of come here? Wake up. A vote for Biden is a vote for China.

We need a president who doesn't grope every woman he encounters. Trump may have said, "grab em by the p#$$&lt;" but Biden is a lot too touchy to woman.
Ask your candidate to embrace policies that would help millions of people as they are evicted, jobless, without income or healthcare, rather than vote shaming those asking to earn our vote. Otherwise, Biden owns it.
Yes! I'm torn because I know our Great Republic is at stake. It's the very thing I am fighting against if my vote is obedient of loyalty, party or person, my soul screams! What are we really fighting FOR? Our Nation needs social policy. For now, I am not obliged to vote #Biden.
My guess is if people put aside the bullshit and vote for Biden regardless of who he picks. This would serve as getting Trump out. But if there going to be petty. We might as well hang it up.
Beijing Biden will sell us out!!!  #Trump2020ToSaveAmerica
Which is what I’m doing. Because even tho I differ with Biden on lots of stuff, he’s still the guy who will back and sign bills to do stuff I do support. He’s not throwing bombs on Twitter or letting someone else do his dirty work.
Someone I follow keeps going on and on about save the children and how Joe Biden is a pedo.  WTF.
Can someone please ask Trump if he was to win the election and Biden was to call in to question the election, using mail in votes as the reason... would he object ????
Again, #Biden was more "radical" and #Bernie was the moderate on this issue too. Let's talk about anti-corruption and lobbyists   #Children
I don’t think so. Resignation means Trumps free get out of jail card will expire. Trump will try and steal the election as he and the GOP did 2016! They will go down kicking and screaming when Biden wins. Conspiracy theories will abound to try and turnover the election results!
Biden has said he would be diversified in his choice of a VP. In other words she could be any race. He wants a cabinet as how America is all races. He has stated this many times. He is far from racist.
That argument would make more sense if Biden wins, because yeah, the media probably wouldn’t hype it as much with a Dem in office. But the pandemic ends when there’s a vaccine, and a majority of the population gets it. 2 years from last March by most estimates.
CNN analyst: This is the latest sign that Trump is in trouble
You should fire your campaign manager because your messaging is WEAK! The Lincoln  project and Biden are STRONG in their messaging.
Yes, things would be so much worse under Biden...🙄
If he don't. I am afraid people will take it as Biden is weak. I say this because this is how society acts these days. Yes there should be a fact checked. Trump lies to much.
Finally, one look at your profile tells anyone for whom you are voting. It’s not Biden. You want to send children back to school in the middle of an uncontrolled pandemic. Dude. No.
There’s a street in my town with several Biden and Lib signs. I’ve nicknamed it Liberal Lane.
Good grief! This is way too scary. Can't imagine if Biden gets elected. Please America, wake up and vote Red this November. 🙏 #KAG2020 #RedPill
Gotta love the double standard. Obama and Biden stopped testing for swine flu, didn’t urge a shutdown, they never got harassed by the media. Trump wants to get America moving and he’s harassed.
This idiot right here... And we still got stupid folks saying he's  better than Biden. GTFOH.
Yeah that is straight up sexism but it’s not Biden driving it. I wish he’d announced already but there’s been torrents of bad news about trump so I’m willing they’re holding back to keep the light on Trump’s failures.
I don't know, how is the Joe Biden sexual assault case going?
Wow Biden must be powerful to have made a world wide pandemic. Don't you think?
Ohio Democratic Virtual Convention (tomorrow at 4:30 pm) is being attended by Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and a few others. Special announcement by Biden will be made. Odds are, it’ll be him announcing Kamala as his VP pick.
If VP Biden picks a black woman as his VP pick and she ends up being President. She is going to catch hell from the "right" more than President Obama ever did. SMDH
Have you even listened to Biden lately? Do you find him to be well spoken? I mean now, btw. Not in 1971 when he first joined the swamp.
Trump will destroy this country with what little time he has left. Just to spite the fact that Biden is beating him. Trump can not stand to loose.
But you’re still voting for Biden, right? He can’t put a complete thought together at this point. 😂
No worries. With Biden up by 15, they’ll be calling it at 9:30 EST.
Bernie dropped out April 8th.... then endorsed Biden.
They aren’t campaigning for Biden. They’re campaigning for their agenda of which Biden is the puppet.
I’d vote for Biden no matter who the VP choice is. Just my 2 cents worth...#TrumpThreatensAmerica
We want Biden to win. He can do that with either as VP.
I bet Mr. Biden will need to change his Depends during the debate break
Particularly since he recently called out Biden for warning that Trump would do exactly this.
Agree there are many good candidates, though just like the election that put this idiot in the the white house, a vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump. We have to trust &amp; believe that since Biden has been in the front seat before he will listen &amp; hear his advisors .
Well the way I see it is we already have a racist president who is also a idiot,  so just like Trump asked us black people,  what do I have to lose voting for Biden? I'm voting in person so it doesn't matter.
In my personal opinion, (no one on any podcast I've heard has said anything like this) Joe Biden is dragging out his VP nomination in order to platform neo-liberal black women, while actual progressive black women like Nina Turner are not being platformed
Pathetic, as to be expected from Hidin BidenAnd will tell you Confidently 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂And people actually talking Kanye in 2020 for a vote is beyond me. And that’s my NIGGA through all his shits 😂😂😂like we don’t even know how to cancel peoples votes for Kanye over Biden at this point🤣😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂I was pulling for Biden but everyone killed him before he had a chance 😂and maaaaannnnn I been coming up on more and more black trump supporters and it’s a shame but you ain’t never lied! People don’t know
For a man who hates and hurts God. That was said by the President.  Biden is Catholic, like most of Congress, so Catholics hates and hurts good? What test do you have to pass to please you?
I’m so over the VP discourse. Biden should pick whoever he thinks would be his best governing partner.  Do I want it to be a strong progressive? Absolutely.   Will I be annoyed if he picked a moderate who shares his beliefs? Probably so.   Will it matter in the long run? No.
I haven’t been able to succinctly articulate my feelings on how the Dems are handling this VP pick but this article does a pretty good job...
I'm being told Biden will announce his VP next week by my sources.
There is no "incompetence" involved. The media is making it look that way with their breathless speculation but that's not on Biden. He's doing precisely what is always done.
Often true. McCain announced Palin on Labor Day weekend eve, just before the convention. Obama announced Biden on August 22, 2008; convention started on August 25. Others have been earlier. Kerry announced Edwards 4th of July weekend. It varies.
I don't agree it was "botched." Biden hasn't done anything. different from any previous candidate. It's just that the media has made this into a beauty pageant because I guess Trump's daily degradations aren't newsy enough.
I'm not sure who needs to hear this but Bernie Sanders was much better in getting voters excited than Joe biden was.
After watching the WAP video about 5 times I am again asking why the Democratic party thinks Joe Biden is our future.
No, all trump wanted to do was s speak to his vapid base of evangelicals because he thinks they need to be reminded how religious &amp; devoted this god he is in contrast to Biden bc even there his support may be a widdle shaky and he is mightily concerned abt it.
WHO has groveled to Xi constantly? Not Biden.

I'm losing followers faster than Biden, wth? More and more each day. #IFB except brand new accounts.
I don't think you have to be a "trump lover" to see that the Biden campaign keeps him under wraps most of the time. I'm no fan of POTUS. But it's disheartening to see Biden botch the two or three interviews they let him do per month. How is this a presidential campaign?
Why did the Obama/Biden administration ignore the 2012 WHO request of all non aetiology pulmonary parenchymal disease be tested for coronavirus? Why did the CDC test kit still fail several years later?

It’s ironic that Trump mocks Biden when Trump is a terrible public speaker.  Master of malapropism.
I think he's confusing the rapture with Joe Biden. And personally I'd like to see Trump raptured.
While I believe Biden to be quite fit, I find it hard to believe that he can “hurt God.” Nor do I believe he has the super-powers necessary to “hurt energy.” Also, I may be wrong, but I believe Biden lacks the time-traveling, editorial powers of one who could “hurt the Bible.”
Ur a dumbass voting for Trump or Biden.
So this  is  what Chris Dodd actually said because Biden didn’t denied it. I mean it says a lot about Chris Dodd a former Senator huh? Old white man mentality, so so insulting.

Hi Maria,  They edited the final 10 seconds of the exchange. Biden melts down into incoherence and it’s definitely pertinent to the exchange.
It looks like Biden hacked your account!
our vote is for biden
I think Biden’s strategy to yield the stage to Trump is brilliant. He doesn’t need to say a word. He’s letting us all sit back and watch Trump in all his maniacal glory. The truth will set us free. #ByeDon2020
Where do these people come up with this stuff? Brain dead Carlson. Tucker Carlson says it's 'probably illegal' for Joe Biden to pick a Black woman as vice president

Even in the face of a so called  Biden investigation, they’d need to convince people whose opinions are pretty baked in that the info they’d be bringing forward is amaze balls/game changing. Given the little credibility they have, peeps may just say 🤷‍♀️ to anything they suggest.
If he loses, which he won't by the way,he would at least concede the loss unlike demoncrats that can't accept the will of the people. Anyone voting for Biden clearly hates America and should get to the nearest airport and leave immediately.
I will call out any Democrat who doesn’t criticize Joe Biden or his VP pick.

this is gabe with biden 2020! are you ready for a president whose ‘beautiful dark twisted fantasy’ is a better world for all americans?
nowadays, you can’t even go into a bar and hang out anymore. they all have 15 tvs with sports on, there’s no time to just sit and talk with your friends. anyways, thanks to everyone and vote biden.  ^^ biden’s vp announcement
Tell me Patriots 🇺🇸  Does anybody besides me   think Biden is not only hiding  himself in the basement, but  but his pick Michelle so they  don’t have to hit the   campaign trail!!!!!!
What the fuck, dude????? Biden has nothing, nada to do with this.....
"Insulting" is the exact word. As top people in the Bernie campaign said "We did our best" &amp; got behind Biden, she remained a divisive outlier &amp; butt of mockery. To propose Biden choose for his partner/teammate someone who attacked him &amp; called him "shit" is just ... nuts.
This goes beyond that though.This is insane. Biden has a long list of women who are qualified, widely respected &amp; supportive of him. He should choose a former short-term state senator who has constantly dissed him, is incredible divisive &amp; called him "shit"? Please.
She has made it clear she has nothing but contempt for Biden &amp; you have the temerity to suggest SHE should be his partner &amp; teammate? Laughable. &amp; she's not qualified, having been a state senator for a 6 yrs — period.
Excuse me, but was your Twitter hijacked? This is crazy. She's a divisive loudmouth who's probably the most disliked Bernie Bro due to her failure to accept the voter choice now in TWO elections. She has just called Biden "shit" &amp; only rejected Hillary on national TV.
This is completely laughable. She is functionally not even a Democrat anymore; she has openly called Biden "shit." &amp; he should just hand HER his presidency on a silver platter? Please. Also, she's not remotely qualified &amp; has a dubious past as a corporate GOP stooge in Cleveland.
Sorry, no. Biden is the winner. He retires no permission or buy-in from Bernie Sanders to pick his own teammate. And the "anyone but Harris movement" seems bitter and misogynist: a desperate desire to have a "lesser" woman who won't take any of the shine.
Im unenthusiastic about Joe Biden but enthused about getting rid of Trump. I would vote for a Big Mac that Trump choked on.
My biggest worry about President Joe Biden's first days is that he pulls a Gerald Ford maneuver and pardons Donald Trump like Ford did Nixon, in the interest of faux "unity."
Biden, but Kanye primaried VP Harris on a "not enough albums sold" platform and won 🤷‍♂️  2024, am I right?
Interesting perspective. “Trump is a circus clown,” &amp; Biden should not enter the ring (aka, the debate stage). What if ⁦ reframes it entirely, names it for what it is, an unethical “circus,” &amp; instead comes in w/ his own rules for the game?
Anyone who thinks Joe Biden is a Socialist is using terms he doesn't understand
NOV 3rd 2020 Election Day in America  possible scenario  TRUMP loses 1-3 states by slim margins as the result of MAIL in BALLOTS (80% for Biden)  WHICH WOULD HAVE WON THE ELECTION   Trump addresses the Nation that the Election was Rigged ( AND IT WAS) and he won't step down
trump is meaningless just like biden
There is seriously no way to debate trump. He lies screams disrupts and is generally like a child on stage.  I don’t think VP Biden needs to debate him but if he does, wait until mid Oct after he has called you all the names he can, then kill it at one single debate. #VoteHimOut
I went to CVS a bit ago and I noticed that in some yards there were BLM and Biden for President signs. Don't they cancel each other out??If you honestly think Black lives Matter why would you continue to vote Democrat??

No the old white men Joe Biden who by the way I supported are trashing more of Sen. Harris. I don’t know why Chris Dodd is entrusted to do this and where’s Obama. Isn’t it true Sen. Harris is his friend also. Don’t think Obama people leaked Biden as not loyal enough right?
They missed the part where Biden sexually assaulted Tara Reade so....
1) January 20th, 2021 Biden sends letters to every Trump appointee in government: “You’re fired.”  2) The Democratic majority in the House begins investigation into all aspects of the Trump Administration.  3) The Democratic majority in the Senate does the same.

Dems would rather elect Biden, regardless of his racist views than re-elect Trump, who’s never proven racism! Go figure.

Lots of people are speculating about Biden's VP pick. Its the hot media clickbait story of the hour. But, as many have pointed out, this take from Politico, which has been echoed by other publication and (mostly white male) pundits is deeply problematic &amp; offensive.
I disagree. ANY change on Trump's part would signal chao. Trading reliable white male Pence for brown, female, openly ambitious Haley would infuriate Trump's base, which is racist &amp; misogynist. This would nail Biden's reelection no matter who his VP is. Pure media fantasy.
And you know this how, sine Biden is playing his cards close to his chest?
No one cares about that shit. Given Biden's age, I'm more concerned with who you're setting up for the future. Politically she's not strong — she has no electoral experience &amp; we have no idea how she'd perform as a candidate.
I don't think anyone knows who Biden will pick &amp; the media is just throwing shit out to see what sticks. Rice is certainly credible &amp; given the nature of the campaign this year, she won't hurt it, but she would be a weak pick for the future.
How does she balance the ticket ideologically? She is probably a a tad more progressive than Biden, but Harris is one of the most progressive members of the Senate. And let's give the idea that Republicans will "use" these phony narratives — they'll invent something for anyone.
Ohio will be blue this year. Former (as of yesterday) Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder handed Ohio to Biden with his arrest last week for taking $61 million in bribes to ram through HB6, to bail out coal &amp; nuclear &amp; kill green energy. Everyone hated it! Now they're reminded!
Check out this 2020 election forecast via   #2020election Even with some states too close to call right now, Biden has Trump beaten....
Biden is a chump who uses tax dollars as outsourcing bribes. When not bribing he's extorting ally nations defense funds to fire people he doesn't like.
Duckworth would mirror Biden's personal brand in that they're both people who have suffered great personal losses, but remain committed to and caring of other people.
How can Biden embrace them? He had Dementia
You didn't say it but you did imply it. You think Biden wont get it done. Well nothing is getting done with trump. He actually implied that the election should be "delayed"
Trump vs Biden is actually Democrcacy (Biden) vs Fascism (Trump)
also I'm ready to say, like Sherrod, that folks need to vote their conscious on Biden, and I know that a low-rent war hawk abuser is not as bad as a fascist serial rapist, but I'll be damned if folks ever gave Tara Reade a moment before running a bus over #MeToo
I still believe Biden has a chance here.
What is your path forward? You have yet to say anything other than vague liberal platitudes that Joe Biden has not or will ever care about.
Biden Calls For Arrest Of Anarchists'Russia wants Trump;' China wants Biden:' Impossible as Biden withdraws from contention and Hilary runs to beat Trump. She never lost, she claims; quite frankly, she thinks, she had NOT YET won in 2016.  Serious!!!
Biden could pick louis gohmert and I would still vote for him.
This pick is not about winning the election. Massive turnout of the 40% is Trump's only hope. And Biden's VP will have little effect. This pick is important because she'll likely be on the ballot in 2024. Biden will step aside, imho...
i REALLY don’t understand how we as the homies came to the conclusion that the TOP 2 people in our ENTIRE county fit to run it  is trump and biden.
Didn't Biden just put down blacks again by saying they're not as diverse as latinos?!!after he's accused them of not being black and called them roaches? Is he trying to not get elected? If dems could learn to stop using our skin colors against us and stop telling us how to ...
It’s obvious that Dewines handlers are not relaying any tweets to him. Kinda like Hidden Biden!!!!!
During President Trump's visit to Clyde's Whirlpool plant, he took a tour of the facility and unveiled six new promises he plans to keep if reelected in November’s general election against Biden.
You have to pay attention to the “excitement polls”. And you have to remember the closest trump fans that don’t admit it. Also Biden’s comment yesterday will cause major issues.

Joe Biden a Model Catholic? - Fr. Mark Goring, CC
Hot take:  Biden’s coming out Sunday night with Barack and Dubya to introduce his running mate: Michelle Obama.  #Biden2020
please!  its not even close here.  lol  Biden has zero chance for Ohio.
Glad to hear that you are healthy Governor. But I am sad that you missed the opportunity to rebuke the President in person for his shameful remarks about God and Joe Biden. Don't "stay in your lane" when it comes to faith.
It will be thee most entertaining debate of all time with both these fools talking if Biden doesn’t dodge them ...
I would crawl over a minefield covered in broken  glass and laced with coronavirus to vote for Joe Biden.

Just because I don’t want Trump as the president doesn’t mean you can call me a radical lib or anything like that, I don’t even necessarily want Joe Biden running the country, but if you can’t see the toxicity that Trump brings as the president then I can’t help you.
Joe Biden literally promoted segregation claiming "I don't want my kids living in a racial jungle" when describing his stance AGAINST school integration..  Supporting Biden and claim to be for Black Lives is like saying Hitler loved the Jews.

The ifiot doesn’t get the young people and others age groups of people who LOVE this app who will be mad enough to vote Biden! Trump is just ticked that supposedly Tic Toc users said they were coming to Tulsa rally and didn’t show up! His itty bitty feelings are hurt! #TrumpVirus
I will be so happy if Biden wins, obviously, but I'll still have a bad taste in my mouth if my state (Ohio) goes for Trump. I mean, JFC, we went for Obama TWICE.
I’m with you. I like both, a lot. I’d prefer Harris, but I am behind Joe Biden no matter what #Biden2020🇺🇸
Comments like this is why I really think Biden's best chance at victory is to shut the fuck up and just use what Trump says against him. Both are bad speakers, but Trump doesn't know how to shut up.
Sir: My at-one-time large number of Black Americans friends, gone, MISSED; If they were alive sitting TODAY with me and discussing world events, as we did, we would have one word of advice for Joe Biden: DUCK! (Not that anyone would miss him if he did not duck).
I'm still voting Biden,  That's how bad you are...

I pretended to read The Scarlet Letter in high school way better than trump or Biden pretend they care about God. And I got a D on my analysis paper
VIDEO: Joe Biden Asks Black Reporter if He's a "Junkie" - Liberty Planet
Yea let’s discuss that. How does trump have thst in his heart? Proof? He’s helped minorities in 3 yrs Biden actually in 50 yrs voted for and against things thst hurt the black community never did anything to help.
You are such a sheep. Name anything Biden has done to help the African American community in 50 yrs. all he’s ever done is hurt them. He’s voted against budding for them and said he didn’t want his kids growing up in a racial jungle and voted for the crime bill.
Which unconscionable things? The wall? Protecting our borders? Standing up to China? Standing up to Iran? Standing up to N Korea? Tax cuts? The guy is a PR nightmare I get it. I don’t like the guy but Biden? Seriously?
But never Trump means Biden? Common your genes say you have to be smarter than that.
Cardi B Reveals She's Spoken To Joe Biden, Talks VP Candidates

Biden not lying though🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Get ya cone bread game right.  Biden rules.
Biden once again insulted the black community and has shown us that 2020 is in fact: Racist VS Racist. Yay us 🙃.
Yes, that's what I'm implying. Biden is currently the heavy favorite in betting markets, but will no longer be after the debates.
If you don't vote for Biden, you are voting for Trump. It doesn't matter who Biden's VP is. You want to be a courageous conservative? Conserve our country and vote for Biden.
Biden is incoherent
Joe Biden could select a dog turd as a VP and I would STILL vote for him. Trump is THAT bad. And voting for a third party candidate as a protest? That is essentially a vote for Trump anyway.
Thank god!
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?-These pathetic fools will stop at nothing to win,just as they did in 2016 ,the last time they had surprise on their side,this time we may have one of our own,which I will keep to myself for now
This should be a Biden ad. You are so on point!
Bill Clinton paid to keep children quiet. Im just waiting for him to wear a burger King crow at the debates. Remember bill Clinton is a pedo and a rapist. Oh and Obama went to pedo island too. And joe biden owns the island nextdoor.
No cause joe biden fucks kids ya goof. You do know joe biden owns an island swimming distance from pedo Island. And the man don't know where he is lol. Put  in on the dem side You guys just put out monsters. I'll take a pig over a pedo anyday
That’s a good question and consideration. Maybe my initial thought is wrong and even partial African ancestry =AA? I do think Biden was referring to ADOS, but it just wasn’t necessary to say.

Biden is a joke on healthcare. He would never have signed the executive order Trump did lowering drug prices. Hes a shill for big pharma and the insurance industry.
Alright this is bigly lol. Trump lost Colorado by 5 in 2016.   It is a realistic possibility Kanye can siphon 5% from Biden, giving this state to Trump.
That could be true. I know I shouldn't jump to conclusions, but the vast majority of people not picking religious topics like this with Biden are pro Trump. I'm personally not a Biden or Trump supporter, but I couldn't give a shit about their religion.
That whole thing was basically a  commercial.
Dude northeast Ohio is Biden country an we don’t support the rapist in chief
Trump's "Biden wants to hurt god" comments aside, I resent that the existence of any deity is a given, a proven thing - and that such an unproven concept is used to make laws that harm people.
Does your hate for Trump mean that u would let BIDEN get elected???!   Do u NOT care about USA.   Biden’s brain is gone.   He is just a shell of himself
Biden is against God??? When did he say that?  Trump is getting more desperate by the day.
EVERYONE around Biden absolutely knows he’s losing his attachment to reality. They’re quietly praying he avoids another apocalyptic appearance before Election Day. His cognitive situation is getting worse on an exponential scale. Dont BS us we ALL know this.
does your hate for Trump override your love for USA.   Please tell me u see Biden and how unfit he is for President, but u won’t report any of it.   Can u put your hate aside and think of what’s best for USA.   It doesn’t even matter who his VP will be.  PLEASE

Hmmm please will some reporter  ask him how Biden will hurt God. Love to hear that response
You know in your heart that Biden's not all there. It's sad to see. AND just because your dad &amp;:you got your feelings hurt is not a good enough reason to vote Biden. Just stay home
Yeah, they’re both going jail for fraud money laundering and other crimes that are all starting to be public because he will be charged when he loses to Joe Biden! This is the beginning of the end! He’ll be black spot of history #IMPOTUS #TrumpVirus #HumptyTrumpty #BLM #UNMAGA
Trump vs Biden braino a braino
I know what Joe Biden meant, He definitely could have said it better.  However, the faux outrage from the people that defended this man is hilarious.
RUSH: I'm gonna play two things for you. One happened back in 1987 on Nightline, the other one yesterday with Joe Biden.
Lean into it. Start telling them that you were on the fence but now you’re specifically voting for Joe Biden because Trump said Biden possesses the power to harm God.
Will Biden punch God in the stomach? Insult God's mother and make them relive traumatic childhood memories?
Remember this the moment you find yourself buying into Trump's horseshit about Biden being "against god" #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
JOE BIDEN KICKED MY DOG
He speaking pretty crazy right now. So Biden isn’t against God or energy

President Trump already is wasting no time attacking Biden over this gaffe:
RINO didn’t want to be confronted by Big Daddy so he is joining Hiding Biden in the basement!!!
I want our generation to get out and vote 3rd party.. Biden and Trump are both garbage
And Biden is a Republican in all but what side he's running for.  He doesn't run on a platform that represents me.
Nah, Trump. I honestly don’t think this VP pick is going to move the needle for Biden.
If Biden says things this politically damaging to himself using prepared statements, imagine what will happen during the debates.   There will be blood.
In OH and the most signs I saw were legit when Bloomberg was running (they’re gone now).  I have seen less than 10 Biden and Trump signs. Waaaay less than previous elections.
Trump makes no sense. He lies which is his way of justifying anything he says because he actually believes it. I’ve never heard Joe Biden sound like he’s having a stroke but trump sounds like he’s on some type of medication. We will see. Anyways it will be a remote debate.
Biden went against the Medicare for all that other good candidates ran on! Biden says if you wanna Medicaire you can get it but you don’t have to.. you can make choise whuch one!
Wow — the four battleground states are amazing.    Even if it’s a split on those (Georgia and Iowa going for Trump, Ohio and Texas for Biden), it’s still an interesting mix of states.
these predictions are dangerous. even though he has biden winning, people need to vote as if we think hes gonna lose by a landslide. every voter needs to vote.
Biden the Plagiarizer Strikes Again — and This Time It’s Even Worse
Because as much as I don't like Trump, at least he's out and about again.  Biden at this point has been hiding the last couple of months.  Trump can finish an idiotic sentence.  Biden can't even say 4 words together.  Also they both touch children.  Biden isn't an improvement.
Look.  If Trump gets 4 more years the DNC will at the very least have a major sit down and consider actually going left.  If we get Biden, 2016 is a fluke and they keep screwing us knowing they won.  Don't be the lesser of two evils, be a better candidate.
Yes! By voting Biden in November!
Biden is gonna make u look like the moron u are, trump. U shouldn't be pushing so hard. His political, national and just general knowledge about everything, far surpasses yours. And we all know it and we love Biden for this and we cannot stand you trump
What’s really sad is you are willing to let USA go down bc of your hate for Trump.  U cover NONE of Biden’s gaffes and its so obvious that he is declining daily.    He cant even talk for 3 minutes without it sounding like a train wreck. Do u care about USA!  Trump 2020

I saw my first Biden sign in the wild yesterday. I guess they do exist...
President Trump is the luckiest president in US history to face Hillary in 2016 and Biden in 2020. Both gaffe machines with more skeletons than a graveyard.
I’d be thrilled if he’s right.  And I’d still vote for Biden eagerly.
Maegan that is bull crap!  Biden has always just blown around like the wind. He has no ideas or principles of his own
Most of the Dems arguing for Biden to skip the debates are making excuses other than the virus risk, like "Trump shouldn't be given a platform to lie", or "Biden shouldn't debate Trump because he's so far ahead in the polls that there's no need for it."
So you’re fine with a man who has stage 4 dementia with zero platforms, and is nothing more than a puppet for the radical communist wing of the left? You’re not getting Joe Biden, you’re getting those who want Western civilization broken up.
Bernie’s my guy 💯 but trump can’t successfully land a hit on Biden. Law&amp;order, socialism, cognitive decline, nobody is seriously falling for any of these

I was making fun of my mom for voting for Biden and she got mad and said I laugh like a donkey 😂
You do realize I also think Biden is an idiot. If you remember, I’m a republican who isn’t like all the maga sheep just blindly following trump
THATS who biden’s running mate is??? jk i don’t care who it is. i’m voting for him anyway.......
Trump will never debate Biden. He knows his antics of 2016 won't play in 2020. He knows how stupid he is. He will abuse his power AGAIN and cancel at the last minute. Maybe his buddy, Kim Jong Un, will fire a missile.
I’m not a Democrat. I’m not a Republican. I’m a left leaning independent that refuses to have a political party tell me what I can and cannot do or believe. I don’t like Trump. I don’t like Biden. But I’ll be damn sure to vote the orange cretin out of office November.
Says the guy who never had it. Still better then Biden.
Take 1 vote away from Jo Jorgensen. I fat fingered her name trying to hit Biden 🤦🏻‍♂️
Hannity said, “Biden looks tired, he needs a cup of cocoa and a little nappy.”  Lol
wtf is joe biden Morty now?
Biden is fighting for those folks but he has to *win* to help them.  This humanizes him and uses nostalgia to build hope for the future.  Lighten up.
Is that joe Biden?
Let's say Biden wins the election. Knowing the left controls MSM, that makes it logical that the fake polls shows dumbass Biden leading. Why? Because if the left is accused of cheating,  their answer will be that dumbass Biden lead all the polls, so he didn't cheat.
Ohio. Biden is a senile and therefore would be a puppet. Once again. I have no reasonable choice.
At this point I honestly can't think what Barr could accuse Biden of that would have any real impact as DJT would undoubtedly actually b guilty of the same thing, only 10X worse PLUS a hundred other things. Also Dems have learned from "HER EMAILS!!" &amp; aren't going 2 b fooled.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
But Joe Biden says we should choose truth over facts. I'm confused 🤣
🙌Better to be patient and smart!
Yesterday, I interviewed local business and labor leaders in Portage County about what's at stake in November. They’re ready to elect a President who prioritizes working families and supports small businesses to build our economy back better. #TeamJoe
Just wait until Biden cleans his clock in Cleveland.    He’ll be cancelling debates in no time.
Biden working overtime for the  vote
No    No Trump doesn’t want to debate Biden . Biden knowledge of Policies would just show the country what Donald Trump still doesn’t know .  But it does depend on the Moderators . What kind of Q will be ask .
Heck, Biden mixed up his words a minute later...  “I’m forward looking to” the debates.
When they have the debates the 40% who vote Democratic all the time will say "Biden was so much better, Trump is completely out of it"; the 40% who vote Republican will say the exact opposite, and the rest of us will say "why do we have to pick between these 2 senile old men?"
Okay so I just went from a Biden fan (which I’ve been from the start) to being a SuperFan.    This is a kick ass, kinda funny clip.  😎🙌
Yeah Obama and Biden .. great team and wonderful leaders!
It really was very disturbing to read the news concerning Bill Summers, his involvement in the fund raiser for trump and his comments towards Joe Biden. It’s a shame that you would have a man like that serving on your board! Very disappointing.
Biden isn't running the country
Sally Yates is a badass👠❤I hope President Biden considers her for a cabinet position
Please everyone Trump is going to try to stop a loss by using US mail! He installed an inexperienced person in the dept who only knows how Trump wants to stop the ability to process ballots! Hes got Russia on the technology and a Ukraine person trying to hurt Biden! Criminal!
Now where Trump supporters are concerned, Susan Rice is their ideal opponent but they don’t realize Biden would be better off and more successful with Rice.
Joe Biden Will Accept The Democratic Nomination In Delaware
Biden won’t travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination amid coronavirus concerns-Smart move
Biden can’t even find the time to accept the nomination the DNC rigged for him.
Trump would be "canceled" if he did that. Somehow Biden gets a free pass. It's absurd.
I find it amusing that I got blocked by a "hard core antifascist" because I'm not doing cartwheels about Biden. I think it says more about them than me.
... and we have that claim as well as any Biden-isms and stumbles along the way.
Bless your heart, you are a fear monger. Might I point out that it is every city today and it’s not Biden that is currently President. Trust me, we will be voting our hearts out so we can start to get back to a somewhat normal life.
It stirs his core. Traveling last week all I saw were Trump/Pence signs in front lawns everywhere. What are we supposed to put up, Biden and TBA 2020?!? Worst campaign and worst candidate in 30 years.
Robert Jeffress says “Christians who vote for Biden have ‘sold their souls’ to Satan”. Connecting a vote to the eternal destination of one’s soul is both ludicrous and dangerous.
I refuse to vote for Biden!!!  He can’t even answer questions or debate. HE has 0 to offer hardworking Americans except higher taxes and the 💩💩being exhibited in democratic ran cities. Universal wages, hope that wage and travel restrictions apply to YOU
Off to work time to go pay for the Biden supporters
-Trump is unworthy of debate,he’s incompetent and mentally unfit,his only purpose will be to create mayhem and downgrade Biden to fit into one of his alternate reality storylines for public consumption,not engage in meaningful dialogue on our issues
Many many many beers better
Hold on a second. We need to Vote blue. Vote Blue No Matter Who. Vote blue. #Biden2020  Biden is a real leader if he wins he'll seek to heal the racial wounds that have plagued our country for too long. Fixed for you partner
Biden needs the moderates. They have no confidence in his mental capacity. In addition, public opinion is that the democrats have swung so far left the party is on the verge of becoming socialist. Get ready for 4 more years.
I guess Biden because he is like a child
The irony is that polls show that he hurts Trump more than Biden.
A coup is defifened as a seizure of power, Democrats did try to, and successfully, impeached Trump. However it was about investigating the possible use of his office to solicit favors from a foriegn power for information on Biden. That’s not seizing power, that’s challenging him.
I'm icing  my wrist..I do take care of my neighbor 2× a day who broke her leg..✌she is a Trump supporter but leaning towards Biden The struggle is real😂😎
Geez dude. An orangutan would do a better job than Trump. I'd vote for Biden in a heartbeat
Joe Biden tweet this?
RUSH: Can Thomas Friedman name one thing Biden would do that&amp;#039;s different?
If you support Biden, any debate right now would effectively end his campaign.  They know this.
Oh really?  Is that why the post office just backed Biden?
So your only response is, "But... Biden!" Sounds a lot like the classic deflector, "But... her emails!" Sorry you didn't get enough participation trophies as a child.
In the short term does it really matter who Biden picks?? I can't see Democrats not voting for Joe. I can't see Trumpers taking a pause and thinking, "okay, that VP pick Joe made is awesome I'm going to vote for Joe..."  Just pick somebody already and let's roll.
avakian is down with biden?  hahahaha
You have that wrong. Crazy is a vote for Biden
It's pure partisan bullshit. People are afraid of how Biden is going to perform.
Leo is a thinking man. He doesn’t listen to Biden saying “if you don’t know who to vote for, then you ain’t black”
Z:  1: VPs don’t drive WH policy; they push POTUS’ policy objectives.  2. You don’t just upend institutional racism. You have to chip away at it. I’m not saying Biden has a strong record in this area, but I’m fairly certain he hasn’t done NOTHING in this area in 36 years...
I’m moving if Joe Biden becomes our president 🤮
The amount of democrats who are actually  sensible liberals vs full TDS is imo less and so could easily fall into the same 2016 issue with the amount of mainstream news saying Biden will sail through this election
I'm not a fan of Donald Trump but Biden isn't an improvement.

Joe Biden promised his running mate at the end of July, then at 1 August, then the first week of August, and now might decide in the first week of August but not reveal until the second week of August. Pretty much the same story.  WGAF??
All you liberals on here are saying the same old thing.  Trump lies and Biden is good  Biden is the one that as lied his whole career just watch the clips
Count me in! I’m Biden 2020 always.. from the beginning!! He will give America integrity and I’m proud to be able to vote for Joe!!
Whoa There! We Cannot Take 4 more years of trump. At All. We Need Biden or else Trump will destroy us all. #Biden2020 #TrumpGate  There. Fixed it for you.
Joe Biden May Skip Debates With President Trump to Avoid Scrutiny |
Venting- I would never not vote. I mentioned in this thread I just need to get over the initial shock of hearing, I’m allowed to be frustrated and express my feelings. Our state is burning and morale is pretty low. We know the consequences of a Biden win.
There’s one or two more that have yet to be written that I’m pretty excited for! But in the meantime, this one is priceless. I wish they had a gofundme or something in lieu of flowers to donate to Biden or local down ballot candidates! Pretty sure they’d make a million on Day 1!
Imagine believing this. Lol. Biden is shit and he won't even pretend to support anything remotely progressive. He sucks and so do you for voting for him.
Oh well. Biden doesnt get my vote because he hasn't earned my vote. Green it is.
COVID-19 is not a hoax at all. We need a Real president who will lead us out of this crisis And that leader needs to be biden not trump. Biden did not commit Treason Trump Did.

Vote for Biden.
Reports of something happening in China last December,and Xi could have alerted the world last November when he became fully aware of the situation,but no they played politics or in Trump’s case didn’t care, so now here we are and unfortunately more to come,before Biden can take
Ummmm....why would a Biden supporter come to a Trump event? 🤔  js
Imagine believing this. Biden is beholden only to his corporate handlers. He doesn't give a hoot about working people and never has. I'll never vote for him.
Trump is a symptom of Democrats turning their backs on working people for years. Electing Biden and more failed neo liberalism ensures another Trump 4 years from now.
As much as I would love to see Biden win TX and absolutely crush Trump, I would much rather see almost all resources go to FL, WI, MI, PA, AZ, and maybe NC.

Right, and wasn't Biden a VP before? My god. Why are we even having this conversation
A snapshot of the state less than 100 days from an election shows Joe Biden ahead of Donald Trump.
If #Biden is gonna fix America why didn't he tell #Obama how?
Biden up 4 in Ohio. Hopefully,  reads this and knows that #OperationGrant is working. cc:  &amp;
Are you fucking kidding me Biden doesn’t know where he is half the time or what year it is
Just like 16 right? The people know the VP is the actual candidate. Biden has 16 people at a rally. Trump had 98 according to ^. That is a huge difference.
If I'm a bot I'm so good I even have myself fooled.  As fo right wing, maybe go take a look at my post history?  I'm no fan of Biden but Trump has to go.  I'm the furthest left of any of my friend groups, online and in person.
Biden is going to flip Ohio.
Under Biden's administration, laws must be enacted to make sure this is never allowed to happen again. . . the mini stroked have made him even less stable!!!

i thought it was your Biden 2020 sign  😂😂😂
False. He strongly opposes M4A, and would veto it in a heartbeat. The executive action Trump signed to lower drug prices is more than Biden would ever do. The insurance industry owns Biden lock, stock and barrel.
This is such a dishonest arguement. Its far more than healthcare. Its the environment, its police reform, its student debt forgiveness. Biden answers to nobody except his corporate paymasters. How is that an improvement?
How the devil will Biden pull off doing the Debates? I feel like we will be feeling sorry for him before election day. Dementia is a horrible thing.
“With the safety concerns of voting in person due to COVID-19, a majority (58%) of voters still plan to vote in person, while 43% plan to vote by mail. Among those who plan to vote in person, Trump leads 65% to 32%; Biden leads with those who intend to vote by mail, 76% to 20%.”
Why.... what did Biden’s handlers promise ? 😂

I am so proud if my son💙forced unemployment Just donated $ 100 to our local homeless shelter,$ 100 to our local food bank $ 100 to Biden campaign #proudmama
Pure speculation but I think Trump is in serious decline.  Every day there is evidence.  I think he will get far worse in the next 3 months.  Doesn't mean the Repubs won't toss the kitchen sink at Biden but I think Trump is going to fade away.
You're not gonna be there, bitch.  Biden doesn't want your gold ass toilet &amp; chandelier.
Anyone think Biden could last 9 holes on a golf course? Probably just wander off into the woods by the 4th hole...
That's because obummer and Biden are unamerican
There is zero chance, 0, ZERO possibility that Biden will pick Sen E. Warren for VP. MA Gov. Baker (R) would replace Warren with a GOPer. Dems need to replace 4 GOP Senators to win the Senate. If Biden picked Warren, Dems would need 5.  (p.s. I like Liz - lots)
Go ahead and vote for Biden. Who's stopping you? I wont vote for him. No reason to.
I hope Biden picks Bernice Anders
I'm not a Trump supporter but his executive action to lower drug prices is something Biden never would have done. We won't be better with Bide, we may even be worse.
If Biden wants to govern well, Karen Bass is the right pick-We shall see,in ether case Rice or Bass will do well as a Vice President ,the real potential problem will be when Cuomo steps forward in 2024 to fulfill his destiny as President and end the GOP
It is sickening how the MSM and yes even  hides Biden’s illness. And how can Joe’s family allow him to go through this public embarrassment
Well I think Biden supporters are too embarrassed and ashamed to admit they are voting for him. Snakes in the grass.
‘Hating Joe Biden doesn’t juice up their base’: Key swing state slips away from Trump #SmartNews
If Biden ever came out of the basement and gave an unscripted teleprompterless speech, the election would be over. One has to wonder why the leftist elitists are afraid.
Lol Democrats coming up with all sorts of excuses for why Biden is justified in avoiding debates with Trump and making it all about Trump, hoping people are too stupid to realize Biden and his surrogates are scared to death of Biden debating Trump b/c of his dementia.
LOCK HIM UP, ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE ADMINISTRATION WH Official Stephen Miller Broke The Law By Launching Into Anti-Biden Rant On Fox &amp; Friends  via
One scenario I still see is Biden  naming Elizabeth Warren as VP and naming a Black woman to the Supreme Court. Warren did well with African American female voters and she had strong primary base of progressive voters. Joe needs to make a strategic choice not a symbolic one.
Would Karen Bass be a good VP? Sure. She has a lot experience and develop a lot of relationships on hill they can help Biden. She might not energize the progressives but she's steady. #MeetThePress
We still have plenty of Trump signs, but there quite a few Biden signs in our very red county.
Biden might want Susan Rice, but she's too Conservative to get the more progressive voters excited. I can see why Biden is delaying his VP choice. There's a lot choices, but very few who fit the bill. It still might be someone whom the media hasn't discussed lately. #ThisWeek
I disagree with Perry Bacon, i  don't think Kamala Harris makes the most sense for VP. Biden has to be cool w/ the person he's going to be working with. He's trying to find the same synergy he had with President Obama, but I don't think he &amp; Harris has that connection. #ThisWeek
"we believe truth over facts" -joe biden
The only way I don't vote for Biden is if I am dead. That is why as soon as I get my absentee ballot, I am filling that sucker out for Joe Biden and dropping it off at the board of elections.
Just remember that those rioters destroying our cities, history, landmarks, flag, anthem, Constitution, attacking law enforcement, are Biden voters fulfilling the #DNC's scorched earth policy, which they think will win the election for him. #DNCScorchedEarthPolicy
There is a difference between an attack and defending yourself from an attack. Your side is on a scorched earth policy, not only destroying landmarks, history, cities, but also people. You think that is the winning combination for Biden.
Wasn’t this what he was supposed to have done as president according to his campaign 4 years ago? Hell of a self own. Biden should just roll this out as an ad.
Biden votes against school segregation said he didn’t want his kids growing up in a jungle he said U can’t go to a 7/11 without an Indian accent said Obama was the first mainstream black man that was clean and well spoken if you didn’t vote for him u weren’t black but yea u meme
Im voting for Biden regardless for what he says or does.. I know he’s a really good man! I’ve watched for many many years and I know he will never fo anything that would America! Even if he does or says a little that don’t agree with.. it’s his overall behavior I believe in!!
Might as swale vote Joe Biden in November 3rd.
And beyond,and see to the final dismantling of the GOP by 2032,in the meantime Biden primary job will be to halt and repair the damage of the Trump presidency and restore our place as a world leader and as a aspirational ideal and hope for the world to be, a very tall order
If Biden wants to double down on a ‘third Obama term,’ he should pick Susan Rice-Rice is perfect for Biden,ready and able to complete the term if necessary,but more than likely to step aside for the Cuomo/Harris tickle in 2024,at his current age of 63
Critics slam negative chatter as Biden could pick black woman VP  via
The new anti-Biden attack, same as the old anti-Biden attack
I’m a fan of    These articles questioning her “loyalty” to Biden if she’s on the ticket are non-sense.
Oh yea. If biden shows up to the debate naked wearing a cooking pot on his head for a hat i'm still voting for him
Hear what  said at the #OHDemsConvention? He said Ohio MATTERS &amp; we CAN win &amp; flip Ohio blue. Biden told us to get to work to elect not just him but all OH Dems! Check out how you can help us. You can be the difference in this election 🌰
God bless this woman and the work she does. I pray she holds on at least until Biden takes over. Anybody but Trump!  I'll take George Bush back!! Anybody!
“Biden to raise taxes by 3 Trillion Dollars.” Actually, it will be much more than that, and much of it on nonsense. Markets and your 401k’s will CRASH. Jobs will disappear!
Of those 8, seven of them said that Biden's behavior did not amount to sexual harassment or assault. And the 8th woman named "Tara Reade" her story has been widely discredited, and has changed several times throughout the years. Her friends have even spoken out saying she's lying
You seem to forget that Trump was on Epsteins jet as well. He was also shown partying with Epstein and praising him claiming he was a "great guy" on several occasions. As for the sexual harassment allegations, 8 women have made claims against Biden for being creepy.
You need Biden 😎 You just dont know it
I really want ⁦ for VP!
Kamala Harris has my vote!
God I wish you were our leader God bless you! Americans love you! Please pray Joe Biden wins in November!
Thank you for all you’ve done! Many people don’t wanna get involved! You’re a prime example of patriotism and I thank you so much for standing up for us! You give us strength to be better and fight for our democracy! I’m hoping Biden rights the wrong when he gets into office!
#Amjoy Joe Biden choosing a Black woman is not a must. If he does, fine. If he doesn't, fine. It's all about removing 45 from office.
#Amjoy I know this is not a popular opinion but Kamala Harris is not a perfect candidate. If Biden picks her for VP fine, but there will be Republican ads targeting her record as AG.
You are talking about Biden who actually has dementia. Lol. Who’s delusional?
STOP riots; Stop discrimination of Blk. Retirees; Stop money/jobs going to Communist China; You are in position to do it NOW. I support you, will vote AGAIN for you, but a fact exists: a disaster from which no Black American can recover: Biden. See my "SEDITION."
Doing my part but I need help Biden!!
So basically he can't run against Biden cuz he hasn't made any gaff's so he picks the black guy that his base hates. It's sad and predictable but at this point sooo funny!
People just want to blame all the covid deaths on Trump because they hate him and it makes them feel righteous, but they can't tell you what a President Biden would have done differently that would've saved lives (and neither can he).
A vote for Biden is a vote for whomever he chooses as Vice President. He will be declared incomplete and either the 25th Amendment will be utilized for the first time or they will just Wag the Dog.
I don’t give a shit who #Biden picks for his VP. He could pick Michael Bay and I’m still voting for him. It’s ANYONE IN THIS FUCKING WORLD over what we currently have. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
And if you don't start campaigning instead of blaming Biden will win. You need to lay out an economic plan, a plan for next four years, a plan for virus moving forward. Then let Biden compare to it
I wouldn't forgive Harris if I were Biden.  In the very first debate, she called him a racist.
Biden should choose Susan Rice.  Not the Castro praising leftist Bass.  Demings is a good pick, too.  Harris stuck a knife in his back by calling him a racist.
Seeing the same (not to this level) everywhere.  No sanctuary to Biden.
I read all of these in Biden’s voice lol
Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It
I continue to be on the same page with  when it comes to Biden's VP choice.
Good analogy. The analogy I've been thinking of is Biden is an empty vessel for leftists to fill with their radical policy wish list. Also, your son is really smart for 11, or any age for that matter.
Can't answer for all Sanders voters, but I will not be voting forr Biden.
Same feeling among Pakistani, Somalian, Yemeni families when Obama and Biden weren't put to death for war crimes.
Lol. Didnt address my point at all. Because you can't refute the facts, I guess. Biden has been working against poor people his whole career. Not one policy he has would benefit them.
The fact that 34 percent approve is startling.
Neither of us has ANY idea what these 3 could do with exception of Clinton. Why would this effect Hillary? She’s not Bill. No, I don’t think Clinton and Biden are “buddies”. And, if Trump couldn’t bury this, HRC couldn’t. Honesty, no issue. Bill is up to his neck. With Trump.
People are talking when Biden gets in office we'll have tribunals and shit to convict this administration and it won't happen. Biden will say some shit like "more than ever the county needs to heal and come together and put the past behind us"
Yep exactly!
Yeah, because they follow Joe Biden on twitter
Omg tan suit Biden at inauguration 🤣
The ring of pedophiles around Trump are his Hollywood and government connections. Clinton, pedophile, Clinton, pedophile, Biden, pedophile, Obama, pedophile, Obama, pedophile, Hanks, pedophile, Gaga pedophile... So many to list
More “likes” than Trump has ever gotten. Biden beats Trump at Twitter even.

It’s under 8 years of Obama that race relations have deteriorated. Biden also.
So, Trump floats an asinine &amp; Illegal idea and you would like us to believe that Biden and those who found it unacceptable are being “absurd” for responding to THE EXACT WORDS the POTUS spoke. Saying NOTHING is ABSURD!  Giving THIS POTUS the benefit of the doubt, dangerous.
That was a very devisive campaign speech. Thank God you're not pres anymore &amp; if you were any kind of friend to Biden you would tell him to give it up
Joe Biden is have a live stream press conference as you read this. Look how many people have joined him
Take the L.  You earned it.  Us liberals would crawl over broken COVID-coated glass shards to end this presidency (in the Constitutionally provided means of an election).  Delay?  DELAY?  Shit, if you think Biden’s going soft you’ve missed that you’ve gone right to porridge.
I agree, and so does Joe Biden. He's already promised to serve one term. His vp pick will be groomed to run in 2024. Hopefully she's a little younger. Not that i wouldn't vote for Warren.

Days or weeks later, all the mail in ballots are counted and it’s enough to secure the win for Biden. But since it’s after the first count, Trump refuses to accept the actual results
Yes, can’t wait to hear President Biden!!
Sir, you have my full respect.  Hope to see you campaign again and/or holding a leadership role in Biden's administration.
Operative question:  is an active surrogate for Biden in the fall?
So like, who we gonna vote for president in 4 years. Geez I sure hope Biden isn't still around to run again
It's not that we want her. It's that it's where the chips would fall if election day got pushed. There would be no where near enough Democrats to back her over biden, sanders, warren, etc

It's worth noting the depth and diversity of the 105 D women v 22 R women in Congress. Speaks volumes. Biden has an amazing field of candidates which should be celebrated as a positive point of differentiation rather than an excuse to take sides.
Wow, Joe Biden was President for 8 years? When did that happen? What has Mike Pence accomplished over the last 3 years?
Excellent point. It's worth noting the depth and diversity of the 105 D women v 22 R women in Congress. Speaks volumes. Biden has an amazing field of candidates which should be celebrated as a positive point of differentiation rather than an excuse to take sides.
you do realize tho that this all happening during Trumps presidency, right? Like this isn’t what will happen if Biden becomes presidents because it’s already happening under Trump....
. doesn't seem to understand a lot of people who are voting for  don't actually like Biden, but we understand that Trump needs to be out of office.   Trust me, I would love  to be the Dem Nom, but here we are.
If I was a Biden advisor, there’s 4 names I would push as solid choices on both electoral and governing scales.   1.   2.   3.   4.    2 with significant strengths and risks: 1.   2.
She responded by focusing on specific neighborhoods and housing complexes, and during her tenure, violent crime fell by 40 percent. Val Demings Is on Biden’s V.P. List. Will Her Police Career Hurt or Help?
Biden is smart to move left. He's got to energize progressives, but I think he'd govern as a centrist.
If white people are the only racist, as the Mentally Ill (D) want you to believe) why don’t we have WET (White Entertainment Television) or a month deadicated to Joe Biden (real racist) or a college fund/colleges for only white people, tearing down statues of Martian Luther King?
Donated to Trump again.  Biden is starting to scare me policy wise.  He's going far left.  I support some type of government health care though.  Opposed to school choice.
Thanks,             LISTERS:
You missed the point completely.   The man can vote for whoever he wants.  Would you be ok with someone getting killed for wearing a Biden hat?  Turn off the MSM.  It melts brain cells.
You guys know Biden was VP, right? &amp; trying to become President? Is he "too ambitious"? 🖕
My projection of the Prez map right now.  Biden and Dems can still fuck this up but so many paths to 270 for Dems, not too many for Trump
Oh I absolutely agree with everything you said. He tries to cause division but we are united and hes divided the best people from him not from each other! We will vote for Biden!! My birth name is spelled Cathran.. it is supposed to be my Catherine.. she said she didn’t know lol

Because EVERYONE can vote.  No one needs to justify the need for absentee voting.  It will terrifically raise the numbers of voters and the number of people leaning Biden will grow further.  Or, Trump hates to lose.
She says she will not vote for Trump. I’d rather she vote for Biden, but I’ll take her not giving Trump a vote.
If the Dems work for the people why then did 8 years of Obama produce a mass exodus of manufacturing out of the United States causing the loss of millions of jobs.  was succeeding in bringing those jobs back home before the Chinese Pandemic. Biden will resurge that exodus.
If you’re “Ridin’ with Biden”, the only two places you’re likely to go are to the hospital for more diagnostic tests or back to his basement... 😂
Anyone who votes with 2A as a major concern in mind isn't voting for Biden regardless of whom his veep is.
With Joe Biden as President!
I don’t think joe Biden knows what joe Biden’s is thinking. I know he thinks we should vote for trump though... rather peculiar.
I am officially announcing that I have politely declined the nomination to be Joe Biden’s nominee for Vice President.  While I am honoured to have been in consideration for such a lofty position in this most important election, 1/2
All Biden has to do is stay still, let his campaign team handle his Twitter, and not be a radical. For the most part, he has done this, which is why Biden is likely going to win.
Many of these possible voters are pro-police, pro-2nd Amendment. Yet one or two will vote Biden because they view Trump’s decision to rail against mail in ballots as voter suppression.
The Biden family should be ashamed of themselves for letting him run
Not hiding like Biden
Mark you do realize that Biden is about as far from a socialist as you and I?
The Biden/? Admin should throw caution to the wind and spend borrowed money like there is no tomorrow, yuuge tax cuts for the middle and working class, tremendous increases in Social Security, and when the GOP scum complain - hey it was good enuff for your rich fucks
I'm afraid the Evangelical community has invested too much in politics and not enough in prayer.  I fear if Trump loses all bets are off; and it won't be because of Biden.
Is Biden gonna debate?
You have NO IDEA what Biden’s plan is. Furthermore, there have been increases in premiums and pharmaceuticals your entire term. You are a liar. #TrumpFailsAmerica
I disagree. She has since her campaign come out for rent and interest moratoriums and UBI during the Covid crisis while Biden has said little. Yes she miscalculated her campaign but she'll be sharp on debate and policy.
The Biden family should be ashamed of themselves for letting him run
A less sharp  Joe Biden is100% better than a lying corrupt trump
I was thinking the same thing. This map is probably at least a couple of election cycles away from being possible, but eventually it may be. Right now Biden winning Florida or NC means he at least still wins a few rust belt toss-ups.
Disagree... Biden will make trump look the fool he is..
With Joe Biden as President!
What is most disturbing about the upcoming election is that about half of all voters, and 100% of all fake votes, will be for Biden who is suffering from advanced Dementia.  That says far more about the low IQ left than anything else.
Tulsi deserves a spot in the Biden Administration simply for that kamikaze attack she leveled on Harris. Something with a bit of prominence, but not anything too important where she can do any serious damage. Because she's a total nut.
I agree. We have to get Trump out of office. Just remember everybody a vote for anybody other than Biden is a vote for Trump.
I hate Biden. He’s stupid, evil, and senile. But if you ban TikTok I, as well as most gen Z will vote for literally ANY breathing thing other than you. #tiktokban
So this POTUS makes time to sit down and do a interview with Chris Wallace but Joe Biden can't fit it in his schedule. Unbelievable!!!

I remember reading Republicans are giving him till labor day to turn things around vs Biden. Their best course of action would be to back impeachment and run Pence on the ticket to try and save the Senate.
Don’t stop speaking out. I spent hours yesterday being shit on by BBs. One of them said they literally wanted RBG to die. Another one said I was MAGA and against BLM because I will support Biden in Nov. They are truly nuts
Biden's higher in the polls, but this seems like a party lines election. Both sides don't want to concede power and both sides don't like who's representing them (in general).
Biden knows it isn’t safe to return our youth to school. Putting our educators and administrators at risk doesn’t help anyone and will only serve to spread this disease further. Remote learning should be the norm at least for the first semester.
Seems like that's the hill the Trump side wants to die on since they're putting all their chips on the wager that Biden will look terrible at the debates versus Trump. What happens if he's fine?
They’ll push ANY other story in their blatant attempt at keeping the corrupt Biden’s out of the news.  Biden is only running for  to keep safe from prosecution.
If you hate biden so much then close your eyes and see RBG’s name. She won’t live another 4 years. The least we can give her is someone who will replace her with a non-frat boy
Do you see what Trump is doing daily? Do you know what he did today? Stfu now with Biden. I will take ANY adult over a child at this point. I’ll take my 20th candidate over him. I’ll do what it takes to save the citizens of this country
Also, you’re just mad Bernie is out. We got what we got. It’s Biden or Trump. That’s the choice. There is no other choice. If someone offered you literal shit to eat or decent but not perfect meal, you gonna really eat shit or starve to death? Stop being a 2 year old
The Biden family should be ashamed of themselves for letting him run
You honestly think Trump doesn't exhibit more signs of early dementia than Biden? All the slurring and jerking when he speaks when his brain misfires? Or the lack of coherent trains of thought? Let alone the fact his father died of Alzheimers, and heredity is the #1 risk factor.
Those troops likely aren't going anywhere. It will take months of planning just to figure out where they're going. By the time they'd be ready to move, President Biden will cancel the order with day one executive orders.
Oh so, you are racist! Nice. Good to know. Biden has moved toward nearly everything Bernie wanted but it still isn’t good enough for you babies.
Not all of them. I don't think Cheney was looking to run after Bush. And Biden likely calls it a career and lets the next generation try to win back the White House if a "normal" Republican had won in 2016.
Lolz. Hahahahaha. You’re hilarious. I am actually voting for the guy who has the most black support of all candidates. He was my 7th pick but I care about who POC want and they want Biden.Trump is in electoral hot water. It could be even worse for him by November
Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’
So rude!  I’m insulted and I’m not even black!!  Biden is a lost cause🤷‍♀️
You’re missing the context of this coming right off the heels of Biden working with Sanders on an unity platform only to have folks like Nina then publicly whip against its passage. I’m tired of seeing us reaching out and constantly getting spat in the eye publicly like this.
Emphasis on push, not dictate, especially when you didn’t get the votes. Making the VP a red line is an insult to all the other things Biden has already done with Sanders to bring the party together. Nina Turner is a bad spokesperson for Bass after what she said this week, too.
Trump INHERITED a strong economy from Obama/Biden, it weakened every year until he absolutely imploded it this year. You have the worst job record of any President in modern times. Record breaking drops in GDP group. This thread is absolute nonsense.
I saw a report that Kanye isn’t the one putting his name on the ballot in battleground states but rather Trump lawyers and supporters are actually doing it to draw votes away from Biden. Complete crap! 😡

Dear Joe Biden. I saw your racist remarks on Black Diversity. But, my question is Where in Sam Hill is Irizona?
If Biden can destroy God, then Trump should give up, unless he believes he is more powerful than God. But that would be blasphemy.
Trump says that Biden is against God because Trump thinks he is a god.
His wife did a good job with this tweet. There’s no way on God’s green earth he wrote this. Too late though. People are finally realizing how racist Biden is.
It matters. Biden isn’t evil. Vote.

In the past 48 hours alone, we’ve seen Trump campaign misappropriate a picture of  in prayer for a sleezy attack ad and Trump question Biden’s personal religious faith. These are new lows in politics. Trump should not be lying and attacking  religious faith.
Biden is a devote Catholic and has been his whole life. He has even met with Pope Francis a number of times to discuss policy and has received Communion from Pope Francis. Who should I believe, the Pope or Trump?

Wow. The arrogance it takes to make a statement like this after the GOP has created the largest deficit in the history of the US, put the US into a deep recession, and cost the US millions of jobs. Biden rescued the US economy once before. He can do it again.
Just a friendly reminder that Trump's administration has done more to "infringe" on your second amendment rights in 3 1/2 years then the Obama/Biden administration did in 8 years.

This isn’t opinion this is fact. Republicans are so worried trump will lose the election that they are trying to steal votes away from Biden
According to news reports earlier this evening he didn’t but Republican lawyers have done so on his behalf in states where the race may be close like Wisconsin to hopefully draw black voters away from Biden. Ridiculous bullshit!
You can download your own DIY window sign:
Biden has always said he is personally against abortion in interviews and his personal writings, such as his books. He is a good moral person. Pope Francis recognizes this role separation, personal versus state laws, it might be something to research. Stay safe.
You are wrong. Joe Biden is a devote Catholic. Has been his entire life. He has stated personally he does not support abortion, but also understands that is the law in the US. As VP or POTUS he must follow the law. Congress must change the law.

I doubt Trump knows that Joe Biden is a devote Catholic. Has been his entire life. He has stated personally he does not support abortion, but also understands that is the law in the US. As VP or POTUS he must follow the law. Congress must change the law.
They will not be "debates."  Trump will lie and Biden will correct him.  Trump screws up, MSM will ignore it.  Biden makes even a minor error, MSM will crucify Biden.  There is no upside for Biden. Let Trump rant all he wants that Biden was afraid; NO ONE WILL BELIEVE TRUMP.
Trump is going to lose because he is an asshole ASSUMING young people and minorities bother to vote.  The summer protests show those groups are passionate but in 2016 they didn’t vote due to a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton.  Old man Biden isn’t exactly Obama as far as coolness.
I hope Biden just tells them to f'off.  These "debates" will be Trump lying and Biden correcting him.  No upside for Biden.  Let Trump rant all he wants that Biden was "afraid."  No one will believe it.
This list is a joke.  Biden needs to tell Trump to go f' himself.
Biden cant even complete a thought
If Biden will not leave his basement as a Presidential contender, and will not accept his nomination in person, how could he ever lead a nation from his basement. That says a lot about him.
I’ve been saying I think the Biden campaign ads are being the Project Lincoln.  One moves the needle. The latter is a glorified psych op

It's all projection. Does anyone think that Trump will actually debate? I for one believe Biden should determine not to do a debate or debates.  All it will be is Trump lying and Biden correcting him.  Who wants to watch that?  Why would Biden waste time to do any?
Honestly should Biden even debate him at this point, he seems to be his own worse enemy and the gift that keeps on giving.
Biden should NOT give the BUFFOON a free platform to SPEW his toxic pile, constant lying rants, and abusive, bullying tactics of a MAFIA punk!
Joe Biden is the fakest tough guy ever.
Also seems to matter which polls are out. Emerson showing only +4 Biden drives the RCP down. They hadn’t polled since first week of June.
They all know that it is a felony to obtain the assistance of a foreign entity for purposes of affecting an election. Neither the Congressional immunity nor their “investigating” is a defense. The Biden DOJ will get indictments and prosecute them to the full extent of the law.

The bigger point is that there is absolutely no evidence of a media conspiracy/bias to elect Biden or to prevent Bernie from winning--full stop.  Bernie supporters are second only to Trump supporters in blaming the "media" for their problems.

I heard todAy joe China is flooding twitter and Facebook trying to insure trump does not get re elected. I hope they don’t take advantage of the demoshits mail in voting. They could send in millions of fake votes for Biden. It’s clear China does not want trump around
I know you can tell how much I hate demoshits . They have been trying to destroy the country for over 3 years. I need to know how could anyone vote for Biden and Harris. I really need to know.  Help!!!

This election has absolutely nothing to do with Biden.  People are either voting #Trump or #NotTrump
And what do you want me to do about that? You better be voting for Biden/Harris regardless
Actually that would yes to a vaccine with 66 percent saying yes. Coincides with the 74 percent support for masks. That’s why Biden suggested the mandate. Not good for trump

Funny you bring that up &amp; leave out the fact Obama &amp; Biden were the ones who started the program and ripped the most imm. Families apart...do your research you sound very special 😂..short bus 🚌 special 😂
It litteraly saves 14% or 450 billion a year. So it's cheaper, but we haven't done it because insurance lobbyists own the  and they already own Biden and Hairris.
People with your outlook is why nothing gets done. Last time we had to stop bush or there woukdnt be a country. Stop accepting less to win. Joe biden is the last thing we need in a time of change. The DNC gave us the least change it could.
Nah they like Biden because he will help legalize killing babies outside of the womb and he likes sniffing babies for the hell of it.
It’s also illegal for a president to spy on the opponent party during a election. But here we are and all roads lead to Obama. Comey Blvd. , Yates Lane, Rice Circle, Biden Street, Clinton Cove, Brennen Lane and Clapper Road.

Biden/Kamala are 10 times more dangerous for African Americans than Trump/Pence.
Yeah. I keep seeing the " i haven't seen any Biden signs" comments. Unfortunately, I've seen plenty.
That's exactly what we are doing right now. we are paying attention to who we gonna put in office. And Biden ain't it.

Are you ridin' with Biden, Peter?
You stuck on silliness. And the damn Dems keep play us, Roland. Don't act like Biden didn' t just throw black women a curveball lol. In my opinion, she doesn't care about African Americans. She's only black when it's time to vote. smh, so I might take my vote somewhere else.
Harris knows Biden is going to last that why this wants to be a black woman when it's time to get the black vote is all smiles. Cornel West should no this.
Since Joe Biden can hold a press conference and answer zero questions, President Trump should start a  program at his and say he will answer 2 more questions than Joe Biden at his press conference. So yesterday Biden answered zero so Trump should only answer 2
Okay but not with Biden.

Hey  Are you gonna campaign with Biden?  Worked out well last time! 😉
I believe Warren did really well with Latino and Black voters when they last polled, pretty sure it was better than Kamala there, but I’d like to see ticket poll numbers of just Trump v Biden with new cross tab breakdowns.
Rather interesting numbers compared to when we last had polling on VP stuff. Harris boosts black women a fuck ton. Drives away white men a bit more, and overall makes more Americans likely to vote Biden than less likely.

Presumably, people who think Trump is similar to (or more liberal than) themselves are likely to vote Trump (=33%)  People who say Biden is similar/more conservative than them are likely to prefer him (=42%)  Which matches Biden's approx 8-9 point lead in the polling avg.

This is just anecdotal, conspiratorial nonsense.  The media covered Biden the most, and Bernie second, because that's where they stood in the polls from the start.  Do you think the media was biased against Klobuchar because they gave Bernie 8 times as much coverage?

Lol and you’re probably going to vote for Biden who has flip flopped his views numerous times and continues to make racist comments.
People keep talking about Elizabeth Warren as majority leader but if elected Biden will use all his pull to get Schumer chosen
Why don’t they ask joe Biden Obama and kamala the same question lol
What in the world does that have to do with anything? You're saying that because one TV network didn't carry Bernie's announcement live IN A DIFFERENT ELECTION that the public was somehow duped into electing Biden four years later?
Look at the exit polls in the primaries for one. Two, CNN, and other mainstream media did nothing but feed the narrative that bernie, whonwas smashing joe at the time, was unelectable . Meanwhile when biden finally ekked out his first win, they declared it over.
This is such an absurd premise.  Biden led in the polls from day one.  Nobody "force fed" anyone anything.  There was a primary election, which Biden won overwhelmingly, even after losing the first two states which probably gave other candidates like Bernie a big advantage.
Trump cause then after this term he is gone and not really a Biden fan.
Joe Biden advocated for segregation, called blacks a monolith compared to Latinos, and said “you ain’t black” for not supporting his old white career politician ass...Kamala put people in prison for Weed! And prosecuted parents for their kids Truency attendance from school...

There's a chicken and egg thing here about how Biden was Obama's VP pick in the first place precisely because he fit this reassuring image of a "normal old white guy politician"  And if Hillary had been VP that might not have helped her the same way it's helped him
Why.😂 What could possibly be the reason you get turned on by this. 🤢😖
I mean, by all accounts, the reasoning Biden gave to Obama and others for breaking his original promise not to run in 2016 is that he strongly believes if he'd been the nominee he'd have beaten Trump  Because of, among other things, that VP cred
The article also has a bold-faced lie as its premise. No one cares about Biden’s Catholicism. What matters is that NO ONE impose their religious views on others. That includes evangelicals, RCs or anyone else with their hands on our uteruses.
Well, it's notable when you have lots of people seeing Biden as a surrogate that he apparently tried to tell Joe not to run (as he did back in 2016)
The irony is that the reason Obama did not do this seems to be he really didn't favor Biden as the best possible candidate (he didn't want him to run in the first place) but didn't like anyone else either
George, with respect, I’m going to vote for Biden, but I’m also going to hope that one day I take a shit and when I flush it and my turd goes on a heroic journey around the world and eventually a sewer main breaks near you and you smell my doo doo

Hopefully we never find out. But if Biden somehow wins, I would expect the crash immediately after election results are known, not 2.5 months later.
Man, I wish Biden/Harris were taken over by the radical left.  That would be great for this country.
Trump’s campaign message is just to tell people that Biden will bring about the mass death, social unrest and economic suffering that has already unfolded under his incompetent watch
I was with kamala being president fr but that nigga Biden gotta go 🤣

Biden- Harris call for nationwide mask mandate. Who’s in?
The Establishment of both parties hate Trump because he shows them to be frauds. R's are no better than d's. Swamp critters on both sides. If given four more years, Trump will take it apart. After fifty years in government, Biden is King Swamp.
They couldn’t run Bernie because the right would just call him communist but that’s all they’re doing with Biden and Kamala. I don’t understand Dems
Should there be a national mask mandate as  has proposed?   Read more here:
Let me say it for ppl in the back... Noe Biden is trying to give this away

How Presidential "politricks" may impact school-police: ..issues related to law enforcement..are especially polarized. The Republican ticket is very strongly pro-police. The Biden-Harris ticket can be expected to lean more heavily to the other extreme
Hell, I can't stand Biden or Harris. They're both awful people.   They're still both better than Trump. No, this doesn't say much for them, as a literal dog turd would make a better president than the POS sitting in office.

Totally get it I’m just not surprised. It’s why there were 30 candidates. The only reason we got to Biden is because of money, influence, and the pandemic. If low propensity democratic/independent voters don’t get it and stay home bc Biden is uninspiring, then we deserve Trump

Imagine pretending to be from the “left” and thinking that supporting Trump’s opponent is “terrible politics.”  Note of course that everyone this idiot supports also supports Biden/Harris.
I’m not saying republicans aren’t using propaganda but public information shows she’s going to do what’s good for the establishment. You know black and brown cops will do whatever to cater to law enforcement so they can impress their white superiors and who did Biden pick? IJS
you're angry because not enough people voted for your candidate and AOC doesn't get to speak at an event.  we're angry because there's a fascist dictator about to be re-elected, but too many of rose twitter are too privileged to vote for Biden because they're feelings were hurt.
If Biden was 1/2 the things Trump says he is, I’d probably actually vote 4 Biden
I don't get it.  Choose between Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris.  Which ticket did you think she was going to pick?
Based on trumps little performance right there, we should just give the presidency to Biden!!!
I’d give up beef to get Biden elected, and I freakin’ LOVE cheeseburgers. It’s literally my favorite thing to eat. That’s how much I despise Trump.
Look at it this way. I’m voting. I don’t like Biden or Harris. They aren’t Orange fuck. If the last 4 years has been an indicator of anything it’s that they aren’t him.

He has said before he's voting for Biden! This is simply a rejection of the platform. Christ, what more do you people want? You want even allow progressives to be conscientious objector WHO STILL VOTE FOR BIDEN.
And when the hell did it become guilty before innocent in this country?
So Joe Biden just admitted that he will resign on inauguration day??
She's still got worked for Biden in her twitter page. I don't know about you, but I sure and the hell wouldn't have my rapists name on my twitter page.
Its easier than trying to explain why Biden disappeared.
If the claims were true, Me too would of backed her. There's a reason no major network picked it up,beyond accusations. They looked into it and her story was all over the place.
He's the one who was OK with Biden groping his daughter.
I was surprised Biden outlined a "plans" to ban the manufacturer and sale of assault rifles in the US (I Really don't think That would actually happen, hopefully some compromise in the middle)  BUT.... Considering The current political climate and, the mindset of...

Jesus. She's gonna drag this out as long as she can. Then again she'll make more money from stupid people on twitter
I consider Harris more as a simbiote, as she is keeping Biden alive in the race and likely calling the shots!
My thing is if the complaint does exist, do we really believe Republicans wouldn't of released it by now? Or leaked it. Then again she wants us to believe her and not the 70 staffers that came out in support of Biden.
But nothing about a sexual harassment complaint? If I'm not mistaken I thought she said she made a complaint.

No, not really, it's kind of the opposite  Statistically Biden's eventual victory is not a shock at all, by the numbers it was the most likely outcome, but the media deliberately obscured this because it wasn't a dramatic narrative, they *emphasized* Bernie leading the horse race

How Long Did Kamala Harris Know She’d Be Biden’s VP Pick And When Did the Democrats Tell Joe?
I.e. telling the other candidates who were obviously no-hopers (Mayor Pete and Klobuchar) to stay in and protect Bernie from elimination and try to pipeline people away from Biden toward Bernie over the next few races
I say this as someone who has basically no affection for Biden  If you took the names off the candidates and just looked at what the actions are, the stuff you'd have to do as the DNC to keep Bernie viable longer feels a lot more like manipulation than what they did do
Yeah you can say a lot of things about Biden but he absolutely was not an "undemocratic" choice, he is very clearly the choice of the D electorate
I've totally seen this no joke. People who love Biden but hate Harris because she's a "careerist" and too "ambitious". It's very weird thing to be pissed about and smells of coded racism to me. Many real things you could say about Harris, but being ambitious is like all of DC
I mean to be blunt making Sanders Biden's VP is a horrible idea for the most obvious possible reason, which is that they're both 78  Biden picked Kamala because she's in her 50s
How bout that gun control bud? Trump has allowed more gun control to pass than Obama and even passed gun control using an executive order. Biden will take the guns, Trump will take the guns. Every politician is a gun grabbing socialist tyrant except the libertarian candidate 😉

Just read the replies to ANY BIDEN TWEET. You’ll see how the country feels about him. It’s a joke that anyone thinks he stands a chance.

Why are the Dems being such cowards? They claim to have the moral high ground and right on thier side. So what's the problem? Trump will stream roll Biden, that's why. It'll be like Tyson fighting a 5 year old. Trump will absolutely eat Biden alive   #MAGA2020Landslide

All they have left to try to keep power in 2020 is stoking fear in voters who are unlikely to do research to confirm whether something is true / valid. The “Biden is a radical” line won’t work, but fewer people know Kamala, so they’re giving it a shot I guess?

Yup, just keep falling for those lesser of two evil scare tactics. Listen to what the DNC itself has said. They dont care about who we want or pick. Biden is one of the least inspiring people ever. Why you guys scared of kanye, yet cant put a decent candidate out there.
That said, he might completely change his tune on this topic. I just hope that he doesn’t. In my opinion, Biden’s instinct that it would be bad for the country is right.
I read the article. That was why I phrased my tweet the way I did. He wouldn’t be in the way, but he’s not going to encourage the DOJ to pursue charges. The DOJ can do what it likes, he won’t try to stop them, but Biden’s quotes make it clear that he doesn’t think that is best.
In a primary you have to get MORE votes than your opponent.  That is how it works!! Hence Joe Biden is the opponent of Douchebag Donny/satan. That is your choice, if you are satisfied with the Douchebag  so be it. Not or voting for some else ALSO means you are satisfiied .
Is this what the Death Star has launched? Money well spent (for Biden/Harris)

Where’d you get that statistic? 81% of Biden voters plan to vote by mail? Everyone st polls will be Teump voters? That’s nuts. Maybe 81% of people over 60....
If your state is a swing-state the day or two before you vote, it may be better to vote Biden. If your state is safely one or the other, vote Green.
Yes, it is, you’re right. You choose to interpret Biden’s remark as racist, and, yes, it was dumb. Biden apologized. But if you’re willing to disregard the interests of your community, are you truly representative of that community?
Its stupid, nobody wanted the 'top cop' type in 2020, and joe biden amd the DNC pick a Cop, and one that let people rot in jail past their sentence. Great choice. It's like they dont really care if trump wins, as long as nothing  changes.
The notion that Kanye West is only running to take votes from Biden is pretty apparent.

And Biden/Harris will kill some people too. Your argument is invalid at this point. Both candidates are gonna be the reason people die. If your only argument FOR Biden is that he's NOT Trump, I've got about 8 billion other people I could recommend 🤦
It's why I laugh at the calls to hold Biden accountable once you give him absolute power. Americans are not like other people. We just want to pat ourselves on the back and go to bed. There will be no accountability just shock when another crazy person becomes President in 2028

According  to who.. im voting for Biden and im a registered  Republican
Biden will not finish first 100 days and America does not want Kamala Harris as President so selecting her guaranteed Trump the election. Harris is far from qualified to take office. Rice was the better choice of the two. Kasich would be the best choice of anyone.
$2k a month til the end of this mess could lead to an even bigger call for a UBI. Biden and Harris have their issues but this is getting me to lean towards them a bit.
I see more vitriolic anti Kamala Harris and Joe Biden stuff on my lefty Twitter timeline than I do from my idiot Trump cousins on Facebook. I am so tired of y’all. They’re not perfect but imo in this timeline it’s pretty inexcusable to actively campaign against them.
Joe Biden sexually assaulted a woman. Her name is Tara Read. Kamala Harris said she believed her. End of story.
We’ll spot you, say 25 tRump sexual abuse victims to the ONE who claimed she was assaulted at an event it’s proven Biden didn’t attend. Why aren’t you in jail yet, Rudy?
will you be as critical on a daily basis if Biden becomes President? Will you find something, anything every day to spend your entire programs and Tweets bashing him for anything they did or didn't do? Or do you just drink the Dem biased Kool-Aid?
It seems to me that the Biden team doesn’t seem like they’re ahead they’re running awful negative stuff usually the team is behind us that just an observation from being around a while
Joe Biden gave an Eulogy for a former Grand Wizard of the KKK. I guess he thought that there were good and bad white supremacist on both sides.
So unpresidential. You should be spying on Biden's campaign, threatening ukraine prosecutor's while protecting your son's phony job and coming up with insurance policy's with crooked FBI and CIA agents in case you lose. That is presidential!
Biden is old school so I think he would encourage the DOJ not to go after Trump and I completely agree with that decision. Biden should focus on picking up the pieces and moving forward. If states or cities have a case against Trump, they can pursue him on their own.
Joe Biden can also talk, think, walk ramps, drink with one hand and he won’t kill 165,000 Americans or allow bounties on American soldiers. He also won’t kill Social Security or Medicare. #VoteHimOut
So that makes it ok for Biden then?
Just think if Joe Biden gets elected he could be spying on you next and you means anybody in this whole damn country I don’t wanna bunch of cheating even spies in the White House

Meh...people have said worse, posted horrific pics, and don't give a rats ass about pedophiles...and now are flippin over this!?!? 🙄
Reminds me of the Aesop fable about the tortise and the hare. While the Trump hare was chaotically running around, it was the methodical tortise that got the job done. Vote Biden/Harris!
No we don't! Ridin with Biden in Ohio!
I believe that's the plan but after a year.  Biden will claim some health issue and step down.  Harris would have 2-3 years as incumbent pres before facing reelection.  And God knows who she will appoint as VP. 🤯

I respectfully suggest that you write a new thread. Endorse Biden-Harris at the top. Then express your reservations and concerns. We all have them, but we must vote Trump out for our republic to survive.
This is extremely short-sighted Biden helped to create the conditions that gave us Trump and Liberals have always been fascist enablers fascists can't be simply voted out even if not in the White House Trump will just endorse and help QAnon candidates to win their elections.

Dude Trump's anti-Biden ad today is the funniest political animation I've saw in a fat minute 😂😂😂😂😂
If your a progressive and ur voting for Biden your not a progressive. Ur Just a Democrat.
I have the same feelings for Harris, Klobuchar, Biden, Schumer, Pelosi, all those accountable news to be help accountable, especially republicans,  I think you and I agree more than we don’t and got off on the wrong foot

So you don’t vote for Hillary so that leads us to having Trump. You have done nothing but complain the entire tenure of his presidency. Now, you’re not going to vote for Biden who has a legitimate chance to beat Trump. If the goal is to remove Trump, why not vote? Fix it Jesus.

Sure it is.  History matters to some people.  Matters to many people.  Doesn’t mean that you have to be in line with 100% of the values.  You apparently like Biden.  I view Biden to be a complete racist. But I’m not lumping you into being a racist. Sweeping generalizations - Bad

Biden/Harris, cause I don't like morally bankrupt sociopaths cosplaying as a head of state.  Also, the last three years have been flat brutal.

Trump makes fear-based appeal to women  via  The ‘suburban housewife’ will be voting for me,”  “They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood.”#TrumpVirus
Biden stands no chance.
I like Yang but Kasich is crucial to possibly having Ohio go for Biden. The priority is removing Trump. This is how to do it
I think Biden and Harris will win like Obama and Biden did: Americans live in a world of surface effects; race is a superficial idea; it prevents reasoning about causes; it thus breeds grave consequences; a friendly black/white image is the good face; it hides deep daggers
However. If they adjust it to have the election be tomorrow it's over 90% chance for Biden.
Word of advice to people on the left who think Biden and Harris are evil, and refuse to vote for them because voting for the lesser of two evils is a strategy they refuse to use: don't cyberbully kids/teens who are campaigning for Biden and Harris. Don't ask what inspired this.
Actually a fan of Biden’s overall but it’s REALLY concerning that our ticket has spent their entire careers giving more power to police and the prison system
Biden/Harris- Who needs progress, we arent trump,  that should be good enough.

It's so wild to me that people are denying Biden raped someone just because they don't like Trump, when all of them were all over every rape accusation against Trump. BOTH OF THEM ARE RAPISTS.

They used the Waluigi character model for Biden change my mind
I coulda gone my whole life without seeing Joe Biden titties
I traveled through Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Maryland. I only saw 2 Biden signs the rest were for the President. I know people in my neighborhood who are afraid to put up Trump signs. They are afraid their cars will get damaged. #undercoverTrumpers
I wouldn't care if Kamilla Harris was purple her and Biden got my vote, damn sure not voting for Trump

Why do you need to disqualify her? Aren’t all the polls favoring Trump? Aren’t we all winning? Aren’t all the Trump supporters way more excited then the Dems?  I MEAN YOU GUYS ARE DOING SO. FUCKING. WELL. Why on Gods green earth are you even worried about Biden/Harris???
1. Kamala Harris has never been a cop, stop spreading that lie. 2. She IS black, most Jamaicans have ancestry from Ghana &amp; Nigeria through the slave trade. 3. Stop telling Republicans to not back Biden/Harris. Instead let’s show a unified country instead of just a unified party.
So the children (Lowest risk of catching COVID) can't attend school. But the woke left (With middle age to elderly) can attend the same school to see Biden...... #ThingsThatMakeYouGoHmmmm
If Biden were to win, Kamala’s going to take your steak and burgers away.
Why do I feel they had this email ready to go regardless of who Biden picked? 😂
You know why you’re no different from a Trumpanze,Biden Bros? Because the only thing he had to do was make a black woman VP and you folded. All Trump had to do was show he was racist to republicans and they made him president. Racism will end when we realize we voted for it🤷🏾‍♂️
I have now come to believe that as part of their sentence it is the Dem party Biden/Harris to destruct themselves as well as the party. There's too much obviously wrong with this situation for it to be a legitimate Presidency run. #WWG1WGA

I was hoping Biden would pick Trump as his running mate so he could win over Trump voters.
Biden seizes on Trump's attack on Social Security and Medicare, while team Trump panics

Everyone says “you need to vote” but there’s only one person who could do a worse job then Trump and it’s Biden so who am I supposed to vote for?

Biden Harris speech was great. Full sentences. No lies, grandiose promises.   Refreshing

Kamala Harris implied that Joe Biden is a racist and further implied that he was pro-segregation.  How could she possibly want to be his running mate?

Pretty incredible how many people read this as he is trying cut minorities down in suburbs, as to what it actually reads.  Saying Biden will say it’s 35% minorities, but the number is actually closer to 30%.  Come on people be smarter and reread it a few times.
Let’s add another debate but let’s do it two on two. Biden/Harris vs. Trump/Pence. The only referee is a non-partisan fact checker. Let’s see who comes out on top!

Yup but we still roasting both Biden and Trump🤷🏾‍♂️💯💯💯
Biden and Harris won't throw an inauguration event. If Trump won (which he won't) he would. The difference is, one party understands we're in a pandemic and the other doesn't.

Biden, Harris lash out at Trump
So, Joe Biden selected his VP running mate based on race and sex.  Isn't THAT the problem with America? There are words for this.
Eh I feel Biden is more conservative than any of the other dem candidates. I’m not a fan of Biden but I love Kamala and what she stands for. Trumps just gotta go. He has maybe done 10% good but 90% bad. And now he’s cutting pay roll tax (social security) and Medicare?  No thanks
Biden has to be seen for who is if voters are going to make an informed decision in December  The debates will reveal exactly who he is, and that won't be so pretty for Joe
People said that last time and he thoroughly embarrassed queen clinton..and She's a refined liar  You can't possibly believe it would end well for Biden
Because Biden will get thrashed in a debate?  We already knew who you are, but this is still pretty revealing

And Trump told us we were going to get tired of winning.  It’s time for a reset in the country. Republicans who care about their bottom Line and that of the wealthiest Americans. Must go. It’s time for caring and empathy in politics. Joe Biden has it

Unfortunately, here in the USA as long as we have Trump and Pence we will have the virus 🦠!  We need Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the WH to begin the task to stomped it out of our dear suffering country.
Don’t give Trump any ideas.  Donald thinks the 1917 pandemic ended WW2.  And he thinks Biden has problems.  It’s just the opposite.  Biden really thought this VP choice through.
I felt ecstatic!  So happy something very positive happened in our country today.  I feel the Biden/Harris 2020 ticket is going to be great!  In the meantime, Trump said the pandemic of 1917 ended WWII.  Hmmm.  I think he is confused.🤔
Let’s say Biden wins and, before he gets sworn in, Trump directs the FBI to illegally spy on key members of Biden’s cabinet to delegitimize his Presidency. Treason or no?

She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.

I don't know many of the names on this list, it's possible that we will discover some strong unknowns. Let's be energized for Biden/Harris ticket and support them.
Don't worry. I believe we will see many of these names in Biden's administration.
Joe Biden took his time under pressure and picked a super running mate, Kamala Harris.  Their choices together will get this country back on track and clear all the bullet points Trump didn’t think important enough to read.
And this is exactly why Donald Trump could win another four years. Leftists/progressives who won't hold their nose and vote. Believe me, Harris isn't my first or second choice, but I'm still going to vote for the Biden ticket. We can't survive another 4 years of trump.
Any leftist who doesn't vote for Biden at this point will absolutely bear responsibility for Trump being handed another four years. That's why we need to vote Biden.
I'll say it louder for the people in the back:  Any leftist who doesn't vote for Biden at this point will absolutely bear responsibility for Trump being handed another four years. That's why we need to vote Biden.

I'm sure they would, Biden could be manipulated whereas President Trump can't.
Because it kind of seems like you just fly on what you think and feel to be true but never have any facts or data to back it up. It honestly frieghtons me that someone likenyou even became a congresswoman and an adviser to Joe Biden?? Nothing more scary
But the Chinese are working for Biden even though Joe never requested their help.  The Chinese are smarter, bigger and have more money than Putin.  They cannot stand Trump. 😆 This will be interesting little grasshopper.
Biden Campaign: Black Reporter ‘Deserving‘ of ‘Junkie‘ Comment  via
I don’t need the news to tell me Trump is a piece of shit, I already knew that. I’ll be voting for Biden. Thanks for your concern though.
Great comparison!!! 🇺🇸💙 Now we must give Trump the boot.  Why? Because he is weak and he is dragging the country we love down into a sewage tank.  Vote for Biden!  He has a PLAN to put us back on track!  Trump is for the rich or his friends i.e. Jerry Epstein.
Just looking at this RACIST TRASH , depresses me ! To think I voted for barrack biden ! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤯🤯🤯
1. That’s a misleading number 2. Biden for making racist comments
We see you've a moral compass, please don't let this Con man get to you. You're a good family man that believe's in God everyday, Not when it's convenient, a camera is running, &amp; you've to shoot peaceful protesters to go hold a Bible upside down.
Biden will not seize anyone's guns. There are plenty of Democrats who are gun owners. To believe this post would be ludicrous because not only is it unlikely, it is the nonsense spouted by hack conspiracy theorists.
I mean, I was already voting for the guy. I now realize Nietzsche was viewing the future in which Biden smote God when he proclaimed "God is dead". #SoldReporter: So can you explain what Obama did to bring peace between Israel and the AUE?  Biden: I know about roaches and you know he did, he did, um you know he did the thing...
Which means not for many months, unfortunately.  I think Biden will mandate masks nationally, but some people will ignore it or wear the mask pulled down under their nose.  Too many Americans aren't willing to experience a little discomfort.  #WearADamnMask
Jo (no “e”) and she can be if enough Americans want real change.  Change that’ll bring our troops home, get innocent people out of prison, balance the budget, and on and on.  Otherwise vote Biden or Trump it really doesn’t matter they’re both the same.
Which is why we’ll all be voting for Biden and while he’s cleaning up the mess left behind from Trump, you and him can enjoy endless litigation of your crimes for the rest of your miserable lives.
All these libs talking about protesting as though protests have ever done something. If you vote for Joe Biden, you're voting for whatever hideous monster comes next to make Trump look moderate.
Hillary would be the Biden administration.
#ByeHannity Joe Biden Democrats are dangerous for America.   Every American needs to see this.
#ByeHannity Joe Biden has a racism problem
Vote for Biden anyway. He's promised to undo the harm Trump has caused.
Me, too. I can’t put a Biden sign out because it will be stolen or shot. Ohio Magats abound.
Respectfully family! We aren't looking to get married to her, make her a queen or lord of the world! We're using her and Biden to get the orange garbage slime out of power!! If we are concerned about records! Let's improve ours by demanding from politicians what we need!!
A major union representing U.S. postal workers endorsed Biden for president after Trump has acknowledged starving the postal service of money in order to make it more difficult to vote by mail in November's election
Biden is a total top.
vote against Trump. for Biden
All of your arguments against Biden are based off of could be and maybes, my arguments for him are based on what IS. Trump IS more dangerous than Biden, no other president has been so dismissive of our rights and protections as citizens. We need to push if Biden wins of course
One more thing Biden will have to fix.
By the way do you think Harris was picked because she would make a good VP ? Pelosi has this all planned , because when Biden steps down because he’s an idiot , she takes over not Harris
Politico columnist:  This sudden media crush on Kamala Harris sure is something, huh?  The media's "glaring effort to rehabilitate a failed politician."  *I will not Vote For  Biden *I will not rely on USPS
You mean Joe Biden. There, I fixed it for you.
Living in a swing state, I need to make sure that my vote for the Biden/Harris ticket, Desiree Tims, and other down-ballot dems will actually count this year. 1 vote can make all the difference
Ok so long as you vote. I get why people aren’t happy. IM not happy, but Trump is dangerous, Biden is inconvenient. Not voting Biden is self indulgently stupid We gotta be good lil party boys and girls until Biden is in. Then we can give him and Kamala heartburn for four years.
If you’re calling for an armed revolution you are just as delusional as a red hat, that’d fail immediately. The fact is, and it’s proven, we can MOVE Biden, we can’t move Trump. Go for the chance greater than 0 and vote down the ballot for the progressives there. Be smart
I'm glad that Biden has your support, then.
Look, you can either vote for Biden or be stuck with Trump. Sadly, 3rd party votes aren’t going to get us out of this mess.
WATCH: President Trump speaks at the White House before leaving for New York.
No progressive is happy about the Democratic ticket, and it fucking hurts that we were all so excited for Bernie to sweep the primary. It didn’t happen, but we have gotten further than we ever have before. Don’t give up the momentum we’ve gained just to spite Biden!
Biden is a liar.
Great thread. Kamala understood the importance of #Medicare4All then. We need it now more than ever. Biden and Harris must push left and embrace #M4A in order to save the American people from the COVID-19 crisis.
Learn to prioritize. Right now our chief priority should be removing Trump, hindering that goal is destructive to all our other priorities. Once Trump is out we can focus more securely on giving Biden and Harris heartburn for not being progressives. Priorities people.
I wrote a whole Facebook thing last year but don’t want to share it on Facebook cuz I saw mean things about Biden—basically it was this: “Biden isn’t gonna energize anything. KAMALA WILL! She needs tobe our pick!” I was right. What I wasn’t expecting was her making HIM exciting!
NO thanks I will be voting for Biden
Vote Biden.  We’ve seen the mess Trump has made.  No confidence he’ll do anything different if re-elected.
But Biden isn’t bland fish. He’s half a plate of shit whereas Trump is a full plate of shit. With Biden you’re gonna eat less shit, but it’s still shit all the same.
With little time until election, emphasis must be on electing Biden-Harris.  Most effective use of time and effort.
#KamalaHarris just doing what she did in SF...#BidenHarris Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Trump and Biden trade barbs over coronavirus response, masks
Just a reminder that Joe Biden has a long track record of supporting segregation. Like 46 years long. Here’s How Deep Biden’s Busing Problem Runs  via
Calling Joe Biden and Kamala Harris pieces of shit with bits of broken glass in it is a tad generous I think.
We know China is rooting for Biden.  Hunter is gonna make a killin if daddy wins.
Mornin boys. Saw this, thought it was relevant to this thread!  ‘Hillary Clinton says she's ready to serve in Biden administration’
So Biden wants masks for the next three months. What is happening in three months? The election!  Stop making the Corona virus political.
I'm voting #kamala Biden 💣😂❤️❤️💦😎😎
They are out of cards and ironically Biden/Harris have trumped Trump lol
Biden wants us to wear masks for the next three months? No 💯
It's not about Biden or Trump, it's about America
So much misinformation in this I wouldn’t know where to start; Kamala and Biden in fact, *HAVE* done everything she listed. Anyone who is reading this just look up the Keystone Pipeline, or the history of the ICE detention camps under Obama and Kamala’s support of ICE.
That 4.7% was all that was left after all the others had run through their unemployment. The total number of people out of work because the the Obama/Biden administration was the part at a 30 year high. You need to dig deeper.
a spring. His campaign had been spied on and the biggest frame job ever perpetrated against them.  And then Obama's lieutenant Joe Biden went and picked you, an outright Socialist/Comunist. The UNITED STATES does not need you or sleepy Joe. And that is why you loose November. Bye
Luckily, Kamals will be the Vice President. I've every confidence that she will serve as an admirable right hand to Biden. She really is the complete package! I've not hear her make promises to blacks, but, she speaks about specific needs and filling those needs across groups👌
You won’t get it from Biden or Trump but you will get it from Jo Jorgensen.  #JoJorgensen2020
She thinks he is a racist and believes #TaraReade. Strong candidate against?  She knows #Biden will fall down some stairs soon after the nomination and she gets the reigns...the country will be in trouble...#MAGA2020
To be fair, Joe Biden could shoot ME and I would still vote for him over Trump.
Rumor in GOP circles: Harris cannot succeed Biden if he would not complete his term since her Mother is from India and her Father is Jamaican. Sorry R's. To be President a person has to be a "natural born citizen" of the U.S." Harris was born in Oakland, CA.#OaklandisinAmerica
Biden has a dog. Trump doesn't  Case closed!!!#RescueAmerica
Pence said if the Biden - Harris team gets elected, she will do away with MEAT! YEP, MEAT.🤡
But Joe Biden isn't Catholic. I'd say Joe is a better representation of being Catholic than the church hierarchy that swept the suffering if little children under the rug to protect the rich privileged Catholic Church and their illusion of saintly pedophiles.
Under no circumstances should Joe Biden concede to trump.
Fortunately here in Ohio the union I’m a member of seems to be tired of Democrat BS. The SS comments were made by Biden and Pelosi because Trump did the payroll tax reduction, they forgot Obama did the same thing and the felt different then.
Absolutely unbelievable!!! ⁦ should be ashamed. A 3 yr old autistic baby removed from plane for not wearing a mask. Must have had Biden/Harris working as the flight attendants ⁦ should address this
Help is coming, their names Biden/Harris
MAGAts don't read that much.  Maybe the Independents could be swayed, 60/40.  We readers are already voting for Biden/Harris.
And if Biden can remember his name
It's funny ur doing it now right before the elections that ur losing lmaoooooo to Joe Biden  but the pandemic has been since Jan and now ur lying about forcing them
You have the never to say Biden's been wrong, BIDEN IS NOT PRESIDENT, trump is and there's 4 million plus infected and 168,000 souls dead. Who's been wrong again?
True, Biden has no clue of the world around him
Biden and Pelosi believe that practicing Catholics (those few who actually follow the Catechism) are unfit to serve in our nation's courts.
Voting for Jo Jorgensen is worse than voting for Biden or Trump.
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : FOX NEWS POLL: Joe Biden is up 49-42 percent over President Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup
That part I definitely understand, and for that reason specifically I’ll never knock on anyone voting for Biden. We just need to consider that a racist abuser with a very evil prosecutor might not be great for driving racial justice forward
For sure I definitely get why people will continue to vote for Biden but he was the candidate that the left wanted the absolute least. At the end of the day I don’t think he’s any better or more fit than trump, and that’s why I think it’s important to begin change this year
Biden doesn’t support M4A, he doesn’t support free/accessible education, and he doesn’t have any policies that will enact eco friendly practices. His only finite plan is to increase police authority. I’d rather start change then elect discount trump in a blue tie
I definitely agree and it’s a weird subject because it’s important to get trump out, but in my view the final result of Biden+Harris shows that neither party will fix things. Biden won’t fix any problems that we face today so I think it’s important to begin the process of change
Well...if they let Biden become President first, it will be the Speaker.  How funny if the Republicans win back the House.
The spoiler effect, Biden would be one of the most progressive presidents in US history, and maybe say something about Bernie and AOC's endorsement?
My grandmother (WI) Trump My father (OH) Trump My mother (OH) Trump My sister (OH) Trump My brother (OH) Biden Myself (OH) Biden
Definitely gotta get 5%. Biden/Harris not only ensures a Tom Cotton presidency, it further sends us into a spiral of right authoritarian hell
If you're a so-called leftist and you plan to vote Biden/Harris, you are my enemy and the enemy of all progressives.
I mean, Biden wants to fucking go to war with Palestine.
What in the fuck would these shitstains do better? Are you forgetting that Biden lied and told his supporters that it was safe to go vote so that he could win, causing a spike in coronavirus cases? Are we forgetting that he held the health of millions of people hostage?
Biden didn't pick her his handlers did. Democrats know dementia Joe won't last 4 years
So if we dont listen to biden and not mandate mask wearing for the next 3 months and more than 40,000 loves are lost what do u think he will say then the mandate would've save those 40,000 lives and blame trump for not mandating it
Hope for Biden.
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
Joe Biden   " It is not about your rights"
One question I have is does the QAnon conspiracy get louder/stronger under a Biden presidency?  If Trump does in fact lose, they will think that the "elites" rigged it against him.
Bow down to the greatest president of all time. A BIDEN MEME?!?!??!! THIS MAN 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So your for Biden who wants to raise taxes on the working class which make up 90% of the population by 4 trillion, make the working class pay for low income housing in the suburbs like my local area (Huber Heights), who wants to have the health care paid for by the stock market.
If Biden/Harris wins, are you sure that she will not be making all of the decisions from day one?
Ask Biden what he did...oops that would require journalism
People were clear during the primary that Biden was unacceptable. If beating Trump is so important, then perhaps Democrats shouldn't have nominated him.
You mean Trump will make sure Biden and headboard Harris can’t CHEAT
Whoever it is you know they will be there for most of the Biden/Harris term.
The fact that there will be no change means that Joe Biden is just as bad as Trump. Just because they're going in two different wrong directions doesn't mean one wrong direction is good. Less bad is bad. Why would you want bad? Less evil is evil. Let's just focus on the evil.
Hell yes -- #LetBetoSpeak #LetBetoSpeakDNC Biden just tosses him after Super Tuesday endorsement, and the Whataburger photo-op?  Hell no.   If you want a lot of Texas Dems to do more than just pull the lever for Joe in November, this needs to get fixed.  Now.
And yet Obama pardoned a solider who committed espionage. Who was the VP? Biden.
Biden can’t survive any debates! You liberal cowards are scared to death of debates! Hahaha 🤪🤣😂

Joe Biden mispronounced last night, he called her Camel-a.
How much money are you donating to Biden/Harris ticket? You made a promise to use your money to keep drumpf from winning. Keep your word.
If what you say is true Manu.......then investigating Biden's campaign and its support from China is fair game
Holy cow! You have lost your marbals and need help! #UnfitForOffice You're making Biden look good. Morning Joe has a 100% approval rating amongst it's viewers. That's better than your 98% approval rating amongst Republicans. #TrumpIsNotWell #AmericaOrTrump
Don't get swept up in that this is the last election everything's on the line right now garbage. The reason why Biden was 'selected' is so that nothing will change.
Fuck no! That would mean she would have to turn on Biden!
She meant to say he inherited the slowest economic recovery in US history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden (who litteraly did nothing for the economy), then made it into the greatest economy in the world within 2 years.
And if you're a Biden voter, you don't have to worry either, as a special service will be held for him that will take place in March or October, he hasn't quite figured it out yet... Little kids are appreciated in lieu of anything else... Fuckin pedos
Let's be real, none of us on the left are thrilled to be voting for Biden. Our candidate was rallied against and shut out by a tone deaf DNC. But this is who we're stuck with. If you really aren't voting for him cause he's "just as bad," you're a product of your own privilege.
When Biden/Harris take over the secret police
A (D) poll has Biden up by 6, a (R) poll has Biden up by 12. Makes sense
well biden has been accused of both so 🤷🏻‍♀️
Why does Biden look so robotic when he walks? Why didn’t he greet Kamala properly when she came to the Podium. Weird.
Hey, Kamala....do you still believe the women who accused Joe Biden of sexual assault? Please do tell. #MeTooUnlessItsBiden
Biden and Trump both brother
when Brett Kavanaugh was accused of raping a woman, liberals heavily pushed the idea that we should always believe women who come forward. but when Joe Biden was accused of reaching up a woman's skirt and penetrating, she must have been lying.
Harris’s selection in and of itself is unlikely to change many votes, but her presence on the ticket is likely to influence voters’ opinions of Biden and whether they’re likely to vote for him, writes  &amp;   #veepstakes
Certainly is our future if Biden/Harris are elected.
I bet the Biden administration wont kill
Keep telling yourself that. This economy booming was all Trump. Nothing OBAMA/Biden related at all. The crash....i think you know why it crashed, nothing to do with Trump. It’s on the rebound already
worked so hard to divide our nation’s emotions. The man ended up dividing his own party. Republicans are now committing to voting for Biden/Harris - 2020, because they understand it is the moral conscience of humanity who sees through Trump’s lack of leadership.
So you want Biden
he "inherited the longest economic exansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden," and "Like everything else he's inherited, he ran it straight into the ground." Snap!
A few things:  1. AOC is not a comrade. The fact that she won't back Shahid Buttar says all that needs to be said.  2. Anyone that votes Biden/Harris is a class traitor.  3. People that accuse other people of being a Russian bot are diddlers, it's totally true, pass it on.
Yes I think you missed the point. I don’t  vote for a person because they are a Christian. I vote based on the polices they push toward Christians. Biden and Trump are obviously flawed like all humans BUT Trump POLICIES have been good for Christians WHILE BIDEN and dems attack us
One thing is for sure. Joe Biden doesn't have the cleanest history when it comes to race relations. Look up what he had to say about integration and then combine that with who he  idolized as a Senator, Robert Byrd from WV. This can't be misinterpreted,but will be ignored
So she is planning on assasinating Joe Biden.
God will protect Joe Biden
🤣🤣🤣hilarious coming from you, who picked a VP that rightfully obliterated you on national TV for your racism. At least you’re providing us with great entertainment Biden!
And Biden isn’t, and most of Washington, Hollywood... ?
Says Biden who supported racist policies, &amp; picked a VP who rightfully obliterated him on national TV for his racism.
Like Biden will do better
How about "Doc" Jill Biden?
Steve, this has been such fun for me. I'll let you get to finding those receipts abut Biden in the basement. Look forward to reading it. But I must wash my dishes. Goodnight!
LOL. Why do you want me to call you a racist? You didn't say anything racist (although you support one, which is quiet problematic). I'm waiting for that proof of Biden in a basement, tho.
Also saying she believes the women felt uncomfortable doesn't mean she believes he did anything inappropriate or at the very least intentionally harmful. None of those women said they felt assaulted by Biden too. So yeah, we can see hot this plays out, with FACTS.
2020 sucks, but making us cap it off with deciding between Joe Biden and Donald Trump just doesn’t seem fair man.
Technically, the first State of the Union speech by President Biden wouldn't be until Jan or Feb 2022. The first address of a newly inaugurated POTUS is just an address to a joint session of Congress, not an official SOTU. A lot can happen in a year and a half 😁😁
Yes !! Made me feel so much better the future.  Biden and Kamala as a pair seems balanced and competent and safe
❓So what does #Biden have to do with that? He doesn't support 'defunding of the #police', or violence of this sort. You should blame the #NRA if anyone. They are the reason people are carrying around #ar15 assault rifles.
President ⁦ slammed by Former Vice President and his new running mate, U.S. Sen. ⁦   (Via DaytonDaily)
Y’all talking all this shuff about #KamalaHarris but y’all act like that’s gonna stop y’all from voting for #Biden and her to win! I hope you know because of y’all mindset the elites is doing what you already accepted.
Yet another reason to vote   out of office in 2022,  I'm happy to fall in line and vote for Biden/Harris!  Anybody buy a complicit Republican.
As she hits a blunt, pushes Biden down the stairs and becomes prez....for sure...I actually like her..she believes Tara.  She put a bunch of thugs in prison and slept her way into a prominent role...perfect politician.
Second stimulus check: Where Biden, Harris stand on COVID payment proposals
Why are democrats on the top of my feed?  Biden, Schumer, Joe Walsh and Pelosi.   I do not follow them.  Disgusting.
Joe Biden didn't take it personally when, Kamala Harris attacked him during the presidential debates. He knew that that's how politics are. That's something you will never understand  . You can dish it out but you can't take it. #BabyTrump
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
No!  She can't win.  Any vote that isn't for Biden is a vote for Trump.  Do you want four more years of Trump? Hillary wouldn't even want you to do that. If you could ask her, she would say no. She would want you to vote out that piece of shit that stole the election from her.
Bruh is Biden is elected this will not be america anymore especially since Kamala gonna end up running shit she’s apart of the radical left?
I thought Joe Biden running for president dummy
You need to check your self into a mental hospital asap ,Biden was right "you ain't black and neither are the others in black skin voting ,supporting,excusing ,defending trump who works of satan as you do ! Satan is a liar! you ,trump and all aligned with trump are
Yeah, I don't generally hear people saying that either, but also I don't hear people reminding about the problems of the PATRIOT Act and the existence of DHS in the first place. And I see lots of unironic retweeting Biden and "vote blue" that seem ... uncritical.
At least two counter-protestors in the Biden crowd.
Pretty sure the lesser of 2 evils crowd knows Biden’s record sucks. But the point is A: Trump is worse and B: Biden can be pushed in a way Trump cannot.   At this point there are 2 options, and 1 is clearly worse.
The thing is she isn’t black she is Jamaican and Indian.   He didn’t even pick a black woman which is a another lie by Biden
It's not that high. 5% difference in the popular vote would be a large Biden EC win. Trump's 2% deficit last time in 2016 is probably close to the limit given how close the swing states were.
hey just a reminder that most trump supporters refuse to call out any of the chaos he’s caused over the past 4 years so it’s not their place to put you down for supporting and simultaneously criticizing biden/harris’ records either!
Biden / Harris 2020! Build Back Better! One Prison At A Time!
Biden's not in office yet, silly!
Honestly, I agree. Yeah Biden sucks but I'd rather vote for him than have Trump in office again. People are acting like there's another choice but unfortunately there's not and we need to face that reality. That doesn't mean we can't fight for change at the same time tho ✨
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
I stick to print news and transcripts just for this reason. I mean I'm gonna #votegold and vote for  anyway, but I'm trying not to attack Biden/Harris. We need to stop nominating old men who can't speak.
Remember back during the primaries when Biden supporters said that since we're not democrats, we shouldn't be allowed to have a say on who is the candidate? Isn't it interesting that we're all now democrats and expected to vote for Biden?
Trump dead ass has plants in this press corps. Some chick just asked a question saying antifa/.com takes you to Biden's site and asked if Biden/Harris should denounce Antifa as a terrorist organization (it's not). Now he's on a tangent about Portland. Totally staged.
Biden will constantly need to be reminded of who his VP is &amp; what he’s running for. Plus, I hope Kamala speak the truths she spoke on the debate stage about Biden being a racist. Will be interesting.
I’m so excited about Biden/Harris2020. I’m in Ohio(important state) My voice has NEVER BEEN HEARD! My story is UNBELIEVABLE! You 2 or u zoom me or visit me, and fight for ME! I BELIEVE in you both. Please don’t let me down!!
Funny how President Biden finished every sentence while Trump read from notes for half an hour, the same notes he read yesterday without raising his head. He is a energy on sleeping pills.
Biden/Harris2020 are going to Unite this Country!! We need to quit this racism BS! We are all one race, the Human Race❤️❤️
Can we get a split screen of Biden watching this... this... anxiety inducing auditory assault?
What did Joe Biden do in 2008 to save us from the brink of collapse?
I'm seeing a lot of anti-Biden, anti-Harris rhetoric from my left-leaning friends on social media. Can't we like... Save it? Until after we get Trump out of office?   The Republicans don't even expect their candidates to be decent... Why must we expect ours to be perfect?
Okay, watching that press conference almost turned me into the K-Hive lmao  We need the Biden/Harris ticket to win in November y'all
I've talked to lawn furniture that's smarter than Joe Biden lol. Picking you as a running mate closes the case lol.
can you stop showing the press conference from biden and kamala? Its on a damn loop and its annoying
Biden-Harris   We need more than a victory; we need a mandate!
Vote for Biden no matter what. I would vote for him if he had chosen a chunk of cheese. The world can’t take much more of this corruption and hate.
Joe Biden, a man of empathy???!! Isn’t he a rapist? Wasn’t he pro segregation??!! Didn’t he say that the African American community lacks diversity?? And he chose a cop to be his VP??!! Empathy is not in that man’s vocabulary. Go to hell
Only two people in the US died from Ebola. President Obama and Vice President Biden did their job.
This is such a good speech. Hitting on every point possible. Also, she's gonna make Biden sob.
Biden introducing Kamala Harris as his vice president... Bet she'll be introduced as the 47th president too. 😎
Reelect Trump and Pence administration!!!! Why start completely over on a random unknown program with Biden when we are established with trump? Not worth the "shot in the dark"
“OMG #Biden picked someone he disagreed with in the primaries!”  Good.   I don’t want a VP that’s just gonna follow him around like a conditioned puppy dog.
Biden had a lot of slip ups in the Primary debates but he's really pulled it together and is giving a hell of a speech here. Gotta give him credit.
Maybe cancel him for stealing donations that he claimed were for the mothers of those killed by police. Maybe cancel him for totally reversing his opinion on Biden/Harris for a check. Maybe cancel him for being a white man pretending to be black.
Watch Live: The Biden/Harris ticket to debut first remarks as running mates.
If I hate white supremacy, why would I vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, two people that have done more to harm black folk in this country than possibly anyone alive.
People with any sense of morality don't vote for scum like Biden and Harris.
Wait so you think joe biden is a better option? you’re lyin
For those curious about the spiritual background of Kamala Harris, here is an article that shares a bit. What I find delightful is the broad exposure she has had to many different traditions while also embodying and claiming for herself w/in a tradition
How much are you in love with Biden?Biden HAS to blow Trump out of the water on election night, otherwise we could be facing a Constitutional crisis like we've never seen
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won’t rule out serving in presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe
This is the same pollster that had Joe Biden winning Missouri by 2. Like lmaoooooooo how are you even off that bad? That's like 15 points off, AT LEAST
It probably won't happen, but it'd be quite the bit of poetic justice if Biden won, Hillary became AG, and she locked them up.
You can vote for Biden and not support his platform. Most ppl complaining seem to think that his voting against Biden and the platform here actually means something. It doesnt since Biden has more delegates
I only say that he'll pull out bc I think his mental health is in serious decline &amp; his enablers may be able by then to convince him that he's ahead and doesn't need the debates. IDK, whatever happens, Biden will be waiting to make him look foolish.
The Biden campaign keeps getting the good stuff written by itself
I wonder what would happen if Biden got the Corvid...
VOTE BY MAIL! VOTE EARLY! VOTE BLUE   #voteblue2020 down ballot  #covid19leadership #joebiden #kamalaharris #corononavirus #covid19response #courageousleadership #votebymail #voteearly #votingmatters #democracy
Biden is not sharp compared to when he was VP. He’s getting worse and to deny it is dangerous. He’s going to limp into the WH. And if he was able to actively campaign like normal he wouldn’t be able to hide it. Why can’t we all admit both candidates suck. Biden sucks less
If Biden was in now and got on TV and said “Hey, we’re working on a solution and all Americans will receive the help they need!” them everybody took a hiatus until Labor Day and nothing was passed / the bill passed was inadequate, would you still have the same rage? Doubt it.
My last tweet also ties into this whole voting shit and I saw a tweet earlier that was spot on. Y’all want to rally black people to vote Trump our cause it’s an issue for everyone. However, Biden / Harris is a large issue for black people, so our struggle is fine, just not yours?
If they endorsed Biden you wouldnt have a damn thing to say.
I’m not acting like Biden-Harris is a great ticket lol all I said was trump didn’t say what you tried to say he meant. He said “I wish her well” and you said he meant “I hope she doesn’t get killed”. Trump supporters do this all the time. They say he didn’t say what he said.
I just ordered a Biden/Harris sign. I live on a culdasec so it’s not gonna get much views but I just felt like I needed to have more representation in my conservative town.
Ignoring it gives it less power.
Yes, definitely. I don’t know how I’m going to feel after Election Day. Even if Biden wins, I’m nervous about what the response to that’ll be from people in the US.
So sad that he is so jealous of Mr. Biden.
Joe Biden now leads Donald Trump 53% to 42% among U.S. voters, up from an 8-point advantage at the end of June.
No Big Ten football, the NHL draft lottery is fixed, and we now know the identity of the president approximately two months after the Biden inauguration.
Here are my favorites even though there are too many to choose from; Glenn Kirschner, grandpa snarky, steelerschic, LeonaLioness, aunt crabby, eric swalwell and Dan Rather.
Thanks.

Now provide excuses for avoiding any remotely respected reporter. And don’t site Trump. He’s another issue all together. Biden is mentally not able to handle the media and his people don’t want us to see it.
dude... Joe biden... brought us... trump. is that slow enough for you?
Vote for Biden like your life depends on it! Your local  know best. #VoteBidenHarris2020 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I've said from the start... Biden will be 47.
Trump is scared and putting our democracy on the line to remain President.  It’s up to us to vote in Joe Biden.

Grew up in VA7, family knew Robinson and Slaughter. Cantor was a symptom, setting the table for Trump. Right thinking moderates must bury this cabal of know-nothings, and begin to rebuild the Republic.  I'm in Ohio, and it's no better ($60m GOP bribery scandal).  Voting Biden.
it's so the mic is closer to the laptop speakers, he's clearly got a speakerphone call going.  Are you this dense, social media lackey? Or do you just think your readers are that dense that they'll buy your inference?
I’m about facts and truth.Don’t feed me bullshit as an argument.Don’t feed me conspiracies as reason.Fact Biden says racist crap every time he talks off script.He has written &amp; voted for racist bills.What has Trump said or done himself that is racist? And not an employee of his.
Obama and Biden rebuilt in America after 2008. Biden and Harris will do it again.
Another hole in your sinking ship.
Mines an American Tactical. Its not a bad gun. Not great tho. Those Springfield are sharp tho. I'll get another one of those if Biden lets us keep them lol
Biden and Obama like Clinton before them created no opportunity for the group of voters they purported to represent and they did it with purpose and intention - they need to keep them dependent - under the belief they ‘need’ them.
When they're freaking out and just throwing all the racist stuff they can at the wall waiting for it to stick. You know for sure Biden made the right choice.
Yet hundreds of famous people are not incognito on Twitter.
Even  chose to ignore it. What about unifying to #VoteOutTheGOP and #VoteOutTrump?  We need to win the election.

LOL Biden &amp; Harris ... the radical Left. Hahaha
It seems people are confusing wants and needs right now and I’m baffled. You can question their (Biden/Harris) past and vote out hate at the same time. I WANT better Democratic Candidates for President and I NEED Trump out of the White House IMMEDIATELY.

Wow! What a response! Many thanks bro! 🙏🏼
Together we will beat Trump and elect Joe Biden.
Agreed!!!  #trump2020  WE DO NOT WANT YOU OR BIDEN RUNNING THIS COUNTRY INTO THE GROUND!!  We will succeed with President
It’s an allegation but using that slur is a form of cyberbullying &amp; you are proving her article right.
It’s 45 years now for Biden.  You going to ask him too?  Both candidates are absolute shit.
Something tells me he's a high school drop out. I'm not taking political advice from somebody that doesn't know the 3 branches of government. Kamala tried to end your life, by using Joe Biden policies STFU

I expect Biden and Harris to make a big early voting push soon.

Biden has suffered huge personal losses in his lifetime. repeating the third grade is a very insignificant setback to Biden.
Every time a Trump supporter flips me off for my Biden bumpersticker, an angel gets its wings.
Your bad faith response to me saying she supports policy over identity is to call her an oreo when shes clearly black. If anything u fall under the same insult bc you back Biden
If they did a survey right now on what Obama did for BLKS or why Trump is racist the answer would be the same. "I don't know it's what CNN and MSNBC shove down my throat everyday" Biden and the Clinton's are worse than Trump check their records. Forgot White Supremacy begin 2016
He wouldn’t even endorse Biden - but their corrupt administration is going to be exposed - evil
Agree. Vote for Biden/ Harris
A major union representing U.S. postal workers has endorsed Biden for president, a move that comes as President Trump has acknowledged starving the postal service of money in order to make it more difficult to vote by mail in November's election.
No buden wants to implement a public option. Which would be fine since it works in europe but the difference is the massive regulation imposed on private healthcare. Nothing Biden has done or said in the last 15years imply he or any dem save for a select few would do that

His desk. As for the party they voted down every policy offered by Bernie delegates. Couldnt even say no to corporate lobbyist in the party structure. And the DNC platform is even more useless the and "promises" biden makes now. The party couldn't even offer basic lip service
Literally everything dont by the party and Biden since winning has shown little to no compromise. Yes biden improved his abysmal climate policy, but having a robust policy shouldnt be something he's forced to do. He cant even be bothered to say he would consider M4A if it came to
There are ZERO Biden signs north of the 45th parallel in Michigan.

I don’t know anybody that lost their houses. Or have been evicted. But I know a lot of people that lost their homes during Obama Biden years.
You dont have to agree with a platform to support. Also california vote for Bernie so he is following the will of his state. Also his vote doenst matter in the long run since Biden has more delegates the  Bernie
It’s quite obvious Biden can only win via voter fraud.
3 things are guaranteed. If Trump loses, he will blame the media, etc. If Biden loses, we will see hysterical “disenfranchised” voters paraded all over cable news. If Biden wins, all will be well.
CJ, I'm going to be nice about this bc u clearly dont show an understanding of how this process works. The delegates every1 has been collecting from primaries individually vote for the nominee, bernie doesnt have enough delegates to beat Biden's.... calm the fuck down
Mispronounces is what your going with? Biden is brain dead. Trump gives 2 hour rally speeches and answers questions from the press constantly. Biden can't speak for more than 15 mins and can't answer questions. It's all scripted with Biden.
Only 40,000,000 people who have lost their jobs and may not get them back before Biden/Harris takeover.
The Biden-Harris ticket will be cemented next week at the Democratic National Convention, where former Ohio Gov. John Kasich is slated to speak.
Sorry, it was $165million. Crushing Biden who is still playing catch up using large donations from billionaires and celebrities while Trump's is small donors. Plus they just lost an extra million to pay back Kamala's campaign debt. 🤣
Biden 2020 a bad lip reading
But what's great, Joe knows exactly what some Republicans and Trump are willing to do in order to suppress voters. That's why it's kind good to have someone that has been in the same room, who has personally witnessed this happening before. Joe's ready👇🏾
Biden doesn’t even know what day it is lol !! Have you heard him speak !!
Biden and Harris have to make an early voting push.
No one says Trump has dementia 🤣😂🤣, they just hate him.  Biden truly has rapid cognitive decline and has made many extremely racist comments and was behind the 1994 crime bill.  Harris should be at the top of the ticket but Dems are too racist to have a female POC lead.
I don't know......... "We're not going to let Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris cut America's meat!" sounds like a winning campaign slogan to me - there's just more insanity every single day
Biden nor Harris will answer any reporters questions. What makes you think they want to help you? They don’t.
Did you learn anything from 2016? Biden has dementia, no one is voting for him. Get it through your head. They should have put Harris at the top of the ticket but the dem party is too racist to let a female POC lead.

The BLK entertainers push that liberal BS cause it's safe, pays more won't lose that many fans rather than calling out both sides on their BS. Biden could go on TV right now day we gon lock up and kill all you niggas and they'd still vote 4 em. "TRUMP is racist" 😂😂😂
We are much safer advocating our position under Biden than under Trump and would be no less effective at doing so.
Yep....trump keeps saying if Biden wins the stock market will crash. And it will because Feds and Minunchin will stop feeding the stock market and then everyone will blame Biden.
No, but I am willing to bet the future of the left that Biden is not capable of getting away with as vicious a retaliation as what Trump would be.
This is why Joe Biden is known as a “ Pathological Liar” Pres Trump does absentee Mail voting like so many us do which require verification of who u r and your address. Mass mailing that Joe wants there is zero verification ! Joe is a Liar 🤥!!
In that instance we can use the ridiculous mentality of the "ultra-patriot" to ensure that a dem can't just McCarthy all of us, because they won't let Biden get away with it like they will Trump.
Tough question no one can answer. Name one policy Biden would implement that would make America better???
It's not about Biden and Harris not capitulating to us, it's about the fact that they won't do what Trump is willing to do to violently suppress social progress. Them saying "We hear you, we see you" and doing effectively nothing is better than Trump saying "Fuck you" with feds.
and that’s on what? joe biden.
Biden calling Trump the first racist Prez is funny especially coming from him. I guess BLKs and other non whites had it great before Trump. FOH. Shoot the ballot box, no voter card they all are frauds. This is a blood related gang they're homies/family not opps, smoke n mirrors
It is a blatant lie to try and say that anyone voting Democrat has been sequestered like Biden in their houses for the last 4 months and will be until November 3rd.  They can leave to riot without masks but not to vote?????
Obama is still worthless.  How can it be against one party if Trump is pushing against 100% mail in voting for BOTH PARTIES????  Could it be because Biden/Harris supporters wouldn't walk across the street to vote for them...
And now, Biden corruption:
I hope Biden/Harris crushes Trump on election day.
This tweet goin off thanks everyone. Never forget: all black lives matter, men are the root of all evil, vote for Biden, and wash your masks 😌✨
Because your logic is so flawed it makes you a perfect example of why swing voters need to run away from Biden &amp; Harris, who are extremely corrupt.  All we need to ask is, "Do you really want to hang out with this twit?"  Ladies (corrupt) first:    (more)

On a serious note, the potential of having a neoliberal (🤢) as opposed to a conservative (🤮) SCJ replace RBG, as well as the issues with the post office, are the only legitimate reasons I see right now to vote for Biden. And that's only if you believe electoral politics work.
If he won't leave office peacefully that's a problem on its own completely independent of who wins the 2020 election (which I hope is Biden)

While there is a lot of discourse over Biden's "racial jungle" comments regarding bus desegregation, the commonly spread quote is false. Somehow his defense is even worse. Sorry guys, turns out he might call you the n-word after all.
Biden voted for the Iraq war and is, like every US president in history, an imperialist. BUT, he would never call middle eastern civilians the n-word while drone striking them.
The "kids in cages" thing, exacerbated by Trump, started under Obama/Biden. BUT, Biden never (on record) called the kids the n-word.
Like Trump, Biden supports the privacy invasions of the PATRIOT Act (which he wrote.) BUT, he won't call you the n-word while he takes away your rights
Like Trump, he opposes gay marriage and has a history of homophobia. BUT, he won't call you the n-word while he takes away your rights

Want to bet?  How about $1,000?  50% of Democrats say they are afraid to reveal their political leanings.  Now why would a Democrat be afraid to say they are voting Biden?  They wouldn't.  Everybody I meet is voting Trump.  Get out more, talk to real people and you will see.

When Biden and Kamala come out at the DNC the entrance music should be the Bad Boys theme or Akon/Styles P "Locked up" theme. Two mass incarcerating fools a match made in Hell.
Also - this virus has claimed less lives than the FLU, alcoholism and smoking. How were you convinced that number compared to the number of survivors is worth holding? Biden is clearly a pedofile but that’s to be ignored because he has proven himself when and how?

I don’t like Biden/Harris but at this point it’s like having multiple surgeries to get a tumor removed.
At least you acknowledge Biden is senile and unable to answer questions.  The question I have is why anyone would vote for a guy who can't remember what office he's running for.    The good thing is we won't have a president with dementia.  Trump landslide.
Is there a third outcome I'm not aware of?  Besides us doing an ineffective boycott (Biden winning comfortably without us, but us still getting to hold onto high ground?). Also: The Dems having power is a consistent if definitively embarrassing component of the broader struggle.
Get used to it.  Biden is losing his cognitive ability more and more each day.  He hasn't taken unscripted questions for many months.  There is a reason why.
This is the bed that the  has made for the country, having encouraged and cultivated a growing slice of the electorate that is fed on a toxic blend of conspiracy theories and YouTube rabbit holes.
Do you think Trump would care or say anything if one of Biden's (Or Harris, Pelosi, etc) brothers were ill?
What people must realize is that Joe Biden has not yet been nominated  for President of the United States by the Democrat party. All of this might be for not? There are questions if Kamala Harris is even eligible to be his V.P. pick? Does the DNC have a surprise in the works?
Trump answer questions all the time.  Biden hasn't answered unscripted questions for many months.  Trump will win in a landslide.  Nobody sane will vote for a senile racist.  Prepare yourself.
Trump just brokered a peace deal that may just lead to a cascade of Arab states recognizing Israel. Friedman's big winner? Joe "Iranian Centrifuges" Biden.
On of my friends tried to discredit Biden because he and Harris don't always align on policy. Why do we live in a world where augmenting your team with someone with differing views (but a common purpose) is seen as a detriment instead of a strength?
My biggest complaint of Biden's campaign is he doesn't seem to have any specific policy agendas he's running on, unlike Bernie and Warren, for instance...I'd like to get some kind of idea of what he's planning to do with his 4 years in the WH before election day
Oh, yes, it will be a great concern for Right-Wing so-called Christians. They will not have power over the Biden White House. Biden won't make a mockery of Christianity by showing photos of fakers laying hands on him while speaking mambo jumbo.
Have any of the Obama people ever reckoned with the horrendous mistake he made by backing HRC over Biden? Not only was it a dick move on a personal level, but he should have known how unpopular she was outside the DNC.

“Not only would a Biden-Harris ticket prioritize addressing climate change, but it would focus on ensuring communities already burdened by pollution would benefit from a transition to clean energy.”
I mean, Warren has wholeheartedly endorsed Biden and Harris. She's going to campaign and fundraise for them because that's the right thing to do. It's what we should all do. Her campaign was supposed to be about policy, pushing for it and influencing it. It still should be.

Biden/Harris should run on the idea that, "We don't care for whom you vote - we just want you to be able to vote safely." Trump/GOP loses in a fair election.
I was all in for boobs for Biden. Who ruined it for everyone?
Well, if if looks like Biden could win or if he does win, it's going to get even crazier. Democrats are America's #1 gun salesmen.
Read Atlas Shrugged 2x yesterday, then Farenheit 51 &amp; 1984 told me what Biden's Woke life would be like.  Where would Kamala have me to put the telescreen in my bedroom?
The system is fundamentally flawed. Biden wants to build on a fundamentally flawed system. That means it will remain fundamentally flawed and people will needlessly suffer in health and financial well being.
I was a teenager right in the middle of it in Hollywood,CA.. We had few months 'epidemic' of copicat killing for Starter Jackets,fewer for Jordan's...which okay, it was a problem, but JUST LIKE NOW, Biden and DNC use dragnet judges &amp; media for POWER TRIPS!
"Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point. We have got to make some move on this."

Good question, When they showed us this new Jake, I remember thinking "when did this guy become Jake, I've never seen him before"  I thought maybe I had lost my mind!  Or maybe got Joe Biden disease!  LOL

Biden isn’t going to put out the fire. He has spent his career lighting or throwing gasoline on the fire. Trump is bad, but he is a symptom of the problem. Folks like Biden and republicans too, are the cause. There is no Trump without the failed policy of the last 4 decades

I wrote this exactly 1 month before Biden, a person directly responsible for laws that disproportionately affect black people, chose Harris, who is as guilty as Biden, as his running mate.  Remember those who shout BLM while also supporting these people for office.
i mean it’s not impossible if biden stays in the basement
he’s definitely better than biden...
trump has his bushisms but he’s definitely better than biden in that regard

4 years of Biden won’t either. That’s the entire point. He campaigned against changing anything about the system itself.
Y’all who can’t swallow your pride and vote for Biden/Harris are the reason Trump will be our president for 4 more years

Let’s talk about Biden’s son Hunter’s flaws now. 👍
Idek if you read my tweet but I said Trump would WIN, and Biden would win POPULAR VOTE. Anyways, just because you said that here is a link to a database with every single recent poll run in existence from every source possible:
Biden choosing her with her gender and race as prerequisites does the same. It’s amazing that the left in many cases does what they say they are against to show as a token that they are against exactly what they are doing...🤷‍♂️ The selective application of principle is disgusting.
This is the worst pick Biden (DNC could have picked . . Kamala is about to get destroyed. Too much ammo .
I don't know... he has a cool corvette?   If we settle for Biden, they'll start making '65 corvettes again. Mcga.
Reporter asks Harris and Biden a question. Handler: time to go
I’m telling you... we’re gonna see more of this... they desperately want to make him lash out as much as possible from now to election. They know with suburban middle America, if they can show him that way and Biden as “nice uncle Joe”,  it will go a long way.
Got all and retweeted. 💙🌊
I believe history will show Trump to rank among our worst presidents, if not the worst. Biden, along with Obama, pulled us out of the *last* Republican recession. As for "hate," it's true I've had no use for Trump for 35 years or so. "Hate" might be strong. Did you like Obama?
Late on this but, Biden should have leaked Melania Trump as a running mate.
You realize biden started his career as the senator from MBNA which was a major bank. Also remember Wallstreet stocked the Obama cabinat and then the headline that wallstreet breathes a sigh of relief when harris is picked as VP
If he’s a clown Biden is a puppet.
Make it so!!   Lots of people don’t remember their Biden
So where's Hunter Biden?  Family affair you said.....  you guys suck!

Didn’t work. 🤔let’s try campaigning for a return to decency with Biden/Harris!
I believe you see Biden honor many of the candidates who also ran for president
Agreed. Enforcing mask wearing gives Biden and his goons more push for mail-in ballots.
And what about all the comments made by Biden through out his 48 years in office how can you stand by and support him
You really wanna take that road when the dem nominee is Joe Biden? 💀
NY Times: Biden, Seizing on Masks as a Campaign Issue, Calls for a Mandate
lmao 0% chance Biden wins Ohio
Biden/Harris get my vote.
Not a biden guy but he does seem to be working harder than trump ever did
A vote for Joe is a vote for the future of our planet. The Biden-Harris ticket will take the most aggressive approach to climate change we've ever seen.  It's not just a want to have net zero emissions by 2050. It's a need.
Full disclosure: Biden wasn’t my first choice. Or my second. Or even my 3rd or 4th and I even almost worked for multiple rival candidates. But ultimately, he won the Primary, meaning he’s all we’ve got. All I ask people is to think, can this country take another 4 years of this?
On my way home I have to drive through an upscale neighborhood to get to my apartment.  Today I notice in that neighborhood several Biden yard signs and Zero Chump signs. He messed with their money.
NY Times: Biden, Seizing on Masks as a Campaign Issue, Calls for a Mandate
We’ve already seen what economic recovery looked like under Obama/Biden verses Trump... Trump’s was measurably better for every demographic. And it was Biden who criticized Trumps attempts to control the virus early on, then changed his mind. Weak flip flopping is not leadership.
What I don’t “get” is the 3 months. :) I mean, if the incubation period is 10-14 days, you would only need that much to mandate. Add 2 weeks as ‘insurance’ and it would be a month, not 3. 3 months covers Election Day which means Biden’s idea is bunk.

She would debate Trump MUCH better than Biden.  He’s weak and feeble
The whole Trump campaign strategy of painting Biden as mentally incompetent looks even more ridiculous when you see a clip like this, where he is 100x more eloquent than Trump sounds on the regular
Not Surprised 🤯
Joe Biden didn't write that.  He has no idea how to use Twitter.  The tweet is a lie as well.  What is wrong with you?
I don't think they've ever had Biden at a net negative favorability in the race even when most other polls had him at around -5. So they've always been a little high on Joe
No the JD didnt say tht, no we didnt "embrace" Joe rogan, it was more he look we convienced a normal dude who isnt into politics tht our policies werent crazy as every1 else said. Do u think after stonewalling Biden during obama yrs they'll magically want to work with biden again
Pro-equality?  Harris called Biden a racist &amp; sided with the women who accused him of sexual deviance.  Not to mention Harris is the only member of the Senate whose family were literally slave traders.  #FakeNews is #EnemyOfThePeople!  #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
How many Democrats do you know voting for Trump/Pence? Now, how many Republicans do you know voting for Biden/Harris? How many Democrats are making videos against their party? Yeah I don’t know any either.

Since even all dems hate Biden why aren’t dems more focused on Senate seats? Even if Trump wins, he couldn’t do anything (including Supreme Court) if Dems won the Senate... but that wouldn’t be as fun as screaming at Bernie voters on the internet I guess

With Biden-Harris? I'm ready to go to work!  Let's get this misogynistic loser out of the White House!
My great hope is that Biden has already begun to think along these lines (not to mention that sharing such plans with the public will go a fair way toward his election #BidenHarris2020
I don’t agree. She bowed out b/f a single vote was cast. She’s now on the ticket only b/c Biden choose  her. Being on top of the ticket is earned. Kamala Harris didn’t earn it

Idgaf what the beef is with Kamala y’all better vote Biden purrr.
Biden you're 80 and probably don't exercise nor go outside of your basement  Read the fine print or have one of your handlers read it for you. All of the mask say they do not prevent the spread of viruses  Sorry but I'm not gonna wear a mask while running

This nigga Biden slapped a women minority for his shit and it’s sad honestly
Just hunch that it wasn’t Trump getting play by play updates of applicants at his buildings around the world and denying or approving them.   Whereas we have racist statements from Biden own mouth about once a week...  What’s dumb arguement...
Well I just made a Sieg Heil reference to Biden calling for mask mandates. So I'm sure be Aryan Ken anytime now;) lol.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews   Wasn't it just a few short months ago the Dems said Trump had no authority to mandate anything on a nationwide level???  Now that Biden wants to they say it's a great idea.  HYPOCRISY
Biden will go as far as wallstreet and the donors allow him to go. Remeber when they crashed the economy? Do you want those ppl dictating how far Biden can go?
Google and Twitter are scrubbing right now trying to delete her ever saying anything negative about Biden!!!
By not supporting anyone that built that system, as Biden did. We had multiple options in this race to pick someone else, even if you despise Bernie, most the rest of the field were knew enough to federal office not to have been involved in creating this situation.
We should have people ask Biden about it live, rather than get a statement from his staff. Let's hear his exact words about the details of the situation.
I haven't - that's why I just doubled down on my vote for Biden's ticket!
Sieg Heil! Mein Fuhrer.  Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews
The Democrats are going crazy because Herman Cain's twitter account posted a tweet today condemning Biden and Harris.... Imagine how the Republicans feel knowing that there have been a lot of Democrats voting by mail after being dead years!!!
That's all democrats do...Clinton cleaned up old man Bush 1 term President's mess then Obama saved country from another depression after Bush son's Presidency and now Biden will have the biggest cleanup - great job by people like you
I think she should've ended to but something that needs to be talked about is that a twelve year old is canvassing for Joe Biden and everyone's acting like that's completely fine
Executives at the nation's two largest private prison companies have been donating large sums to Pres. Trump and Republican candidates.
Once again..fact checks on Republicans but I have not seen one fact check on any speech from Harris or Biden...THEY MUST BE PERFECT.  ITS NOT CALLED JOURNALISM ANYMORE....IF CNN REPORTS-IT SHOULD BE CALLED URINALISM.
Biden would make masks mandatory nationwide!!!!  I guess he enjoys riots. He doesn't get that you can't mandate masks but also support letting looters and rioters go after they get arrested. THIS GUY IS AN IDIOT WHO DOESN'T GET IT!!!

I honestly think both parties are fucking ridiculous choices... This election is gonna be something else. Trump wins- Riots and Chaos, more stupid Twitter. Biden wins- PC/Apology culture is gonna run wild, even more divided. It's really the worst both parties could forward.

Wait until Biden is in office. Then charge #IMPOTUS45. This prevents anyone from pardoning him
Biden is continuing the work of overhauling our healthcare system (not to the degree we’d like).   He’s committed to creating hundreds of thousands of jobs by investing in green energy.  And he’ll put in Supreme Court justices that will uphold Roe v. Wade
Is this the lady that’s running with Joe Biden ?
Never really thought of that..lol Just figured it was some bullshit grab for more attn to sell clothes or more shitty music. But that does make sense, if he even gets 20% of the minority vote that was going towards Biden, it would be a HUGE win for Trump. This 2020 world man
What happened to all that money he was supposed to spend on Biden ads?
Just takr a big shit on stage and yell "fuck the DNC"  But really, push for policy. Blast the DNC and Biden for not following the will of the voters.
To call Trump a warmonger and not Joe Biden is just crazy. It’s weird to be out in a position to support the loser scumbag Trump but here we are.
Yeah, sure. I've never heard Joe Biden advocate for poverty, a weak military, over-regulation. . .well, nothing in that list. It's lies. And your list for Trump isn't much better.

Joe Biden has advocated for and or voted in favor of every war and military action we have undertaken since he started his federal political career. I mean I already stated this fact but was not clear enough apparently.
Biden &amp; Harris are both RADICAL LEFTISTS...  no where near moderate, let alone conservative.
It's more than what Trump says. I guess you didn't listen to Biden's latest speech. Trump literally looks down and reads what people write for him because they know he's a moron. Trump says things like, "America is very huge. Bigly. We have very nice things. Very, very nice. Uhhh
So is biden gonna transition out to make kamala pres. then nominate you?
Harris also gets more likes on her tweets than even Joe Biden does.
Here is where people get this wrong . they are not so-called Trump supporters.they are conservatives.Why would a conservative vote for Joe Biden? His party is against everything conservatives believe in. Second amendment. Pro life. Small Government.
I know there are plenty of people donating to Biden and that’s great. We also can’t overlook local elections especially in a census year when districts are drawn for the next 10 years. That’s what has hurt Dems in the past.

No factual basis for this. Look at the plans being proposed by Biden. Do some homework. There has never been a credible charge against Biden.
Do you think Bernie would have dropped out if there were no pandemic? Without the pandemic hit on the economy, bad as it was, terrible as the system remains, Trump would likely have cruised to a win. Biden/Harris are HRC 2.0

It's got to be the most insane position among Democratic elites. 88% of Dem voters and 60% independents support Medicare For All. Adding Medicare For All to the platform would energize so many voters and beat Trump in a landslide, but Biden refuses to offend his donors.

I mean MSNBC and CNN ran James Cluburn endorsement in full like 8 times that day, they aired Joe Biden’s entire event, including fluffer speeches. They never even did that for Trump. They called Bernies win in Nevada like Hitler and the Nazis storming France.
Biden is afraid to denounce ANTIFA or they would they won’t! They won’t denounce violent protest! They will continue to encourage protesters which makes the violent ones bolder and more violent with political backing!
Hillary Clinton is possibly involved with child sex trafficking and changes her views constantly ..Biden is a pervert that has shown to say things a tad bit racist and Trump is Trump .... you can’t get mad when people don’t vote when the people who run don’t deserve the vote
wow, Wow, WOW!  Powerful, eloquent, compassionate speech and definitely poised, has the confidence to become President in 4 years!  NEVER doubt... A woman can definitely expound in leadership and get things accomplished FOR THE PEOPLE!
It’s called the China virus. Brought to you by Obama and Biden. Cause they gave the funding to the Chinese to study the animals and virus’s. Trump pulled the funding. Study your facts before you speak

Yes, it does. I know, the plebes don’t really matter. Harris touted the strength of the Obama Biden economy a feature of which was most people without degrees were still making less in 2016 than they were in 2007. Democrats seem to think that is a strong economy.
New this AM: Joe Biden proposed net-zero emissions by 2050 and it was not the record-scratch moment it would have been before. Yup, net-zero has reached the mainstream, and I look at why in the new Inside Clean Energy.  #EnergyTransition

This would require pretending: a) Barack Obama was not a progressive b) Joe Biden is not a progressive c) Kamala Harris is not a progressive  Fantasy x 3.
Black people never satisfied. They won’t vote for Biden Harris but complain about Trump smh. Slave mentality!
Markets today say Biden wins but betting markets aren't as confident...
Progressives would rather have Trump reelected than forgive past sins of Biden and Harris. As if that makes any kind of sense in this world 🤦‍♀️
Who the hell ever voted for Biden, campaigning on returning to what we were doing that caused the rise of Trump in the first place is responsible for this. No one else.
Don’t look at a vote for Biden, a vote for Biden. Look at it as a vote AGAINST DT...and that’s where we are this election.
It is the time to transform this country, and Biden has run about returning to the past and his ideology created the environment where the catastrophe we are all struggling through could even happen. Let’s make that guy president. Awful choice. So is the other.

And painted big letters on the wall to decorate his basement??  Biden prepared much more than Mr. Yo Semite, "fatellities" &amp; "Thigh land".
Isn't this the same woman that pretty much said Biden was a sexual predator a few months back????  Not one of the words in his commentary has he said about ANY Republican!!  Love the unbiased liberal media...if there was a one.
I concur totally. If her position isn't in line with OUR black agenda I see major problems. If she doesn't like Cube's contract how are we going to vote for them. Along with Hiden Biden talks about increasing funds for the popo.
If you seriously think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris gone do something for us you bout dumb as hell
Facts so we just going to have to see what they bring to the table but idk since Biden said we ain’t black if we don’t vote for him 🥴

Lol! Biden &amp; the Dems don’t care about your veteran. They care about using the virus shutdowns for politics, hence why simultaneously they don’t care if 100,000 people congregate in an intersection for a BLM event. Try thinking.
Y’all saying people can change, Kamla’s and Biden’s past is just that. So if a man let’s say uncle went to prison for fucking with kids, does his time and gets out, would you let that same man babysit you kids? Ppl change right, ain’t that what y’all said?
For some stupid reason I remember when Berry Goldwater won  just six states in the presidential election against Johnson.   Let’s do that again!   Trump 6 states.   Biden the rest

I heard Trump read from a written speech right after the Biden/Harris announcement. He slurred. He said "fatilities" for "fatalities." Twice. He looked high AF, and spoke in a monotone. Yeah, I can't wait either.
I keep saying the media will never say anything bad or fact check a Democrat. Here is another article with the proof.   EVERY article about Trump or a Republican has a fact check on it. THERE ISN'T ONE ON THIS ARTICLE FROM THEIR "WONDER WOMAN"!!!
California's doing 👍 great 😆! Yeah go with that one. Oh and the fact that Kamala 🔐 up more Blacks than any other prosecutor ? &amp; Joe Biden said you ain't Black if U don't vote for me. While in Congress he called em Savages &amp; said we need to do something soon? 🐑❄ Trump 2020 🇺🇸
Same can be said for Biden.
It’s against the Catholic religion to even get your tubes tied. They aren’t real Catholics. Also Biden is a puppet. He will never make any decisions for himself. You’re blind in your can’t see that.

Every suburban housewife I’m in touch with, hundreds, are excited at the prospect of voting blue.  We know that DJT is calling on every Karen in suburbia to wipe out the enthusiasm for Kamala.  Epic fail, Trumpity!  #BIDEN/HARRIS
I’m not sure what point you’re trying to make with that article. Yes, I know Biden has wealthy donors. I never said otherwise. That doesn’t mean the majority of the money being donated online after the Harris announcement is from billionaires.
With the job I have, I drive all over rural Ohio. Outside of the big cities, all I see is Trump Trump Trump. If these areas are representative of the rest of rural America, Biden has not shot of winning EC.
And tying healthcare to your employer is a big problem also. It’s done with intention, to keep you beholden your them or your family will suffer. It’s why Biden will not entertain the notion of delinking employment from healthcare, his donors would lose leverage over employees.

The fact that you guys already have anti-Harris adds literally 2 days after they anounced her as Biden’s running mate shows me that Harris has Trump and Pence shaking in their boots 😂
Remember, if you vote for Trump, you're a fascist.  If you vote for Biden, you're a communist.  If you vote third party, you're an idiot.  If you don't vote at all, you're unAmerican.  Good luck!

nah biden's tits aren't that small
This is the culmination of a long term trend that's been decades in the making. Trump is a symptom, not in any way a root cause. Biden winning, while certainly preferable, is not a make or break thing.  We're in very bad shape either way

There is no doubt in my mind Kamala Harris will embarrass Mike Pence in a debate. I do question if Joe Biden can handle Donald Trump though. #Election2020
Biden and Harris appear together for first time as running mates
Harris prosecuted blacks for simple pot possession, while refusing to prosecute catholic priests for child rape.  She threw single mothers in jail if they couldn't pay truancy fines.    The law you are talking about is the drug abuse law co-sponsored by Joe Biden in 1986.
Preaching to the choir. I truly believe Biden will endeavor towards good tho. Not to the extent of a Bernie or Liz, but in the direction. Still, I have zero clear idea how to fix trumpists (and shitty people trying to raise shitty kids) beyond education and generation die off.
This should help. Obviously, he needs to implement this platform, but he seems very open to do so.
Will you publicly endorse Biden-Harris?
Biden sure likes to exercise... Trump is kinda lazy.

My mom has devolved into a Trump lover terrified that Biden will bring socialism.  So, count your blessings.
This black woman is voting for Biden/Harrison. That's it.
Right? Also, it makes Biden seem incredibly strong. Also it evokes American folk songs/tales (see John Henry) of the ‘common man’ fighting the industrial capitalists for his livelihood and dignity and casts Biden as the hero. So not only is it bad, but it’s also BAD.
Nah Biden is funnier because he rambles on in word salad.

I was asked today, “What will Biden/Harris do for you?” I was thinking, they won’t do a lot *directly* for me. I can’t really recall any president who has. But they will give me peace of mind and will support science, education, the environment, and won’t incite war. That matters

Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, etc etc. If you think they are Marxist you don't understand Marxism
this is—in my opinion—the biggest reason we need to vote Biden/Harris. if Trump is re-elected, he will have the ability to appoint 2 judges to the SCOTUS. if he appoints 2 conservatives (he will), the SCOTUS will swing right for the majority of our lives. this scares me.

Been thinking this for a while, and especially now with Harris on the ticket. Also, look for the far right to have its day in the sun under Biden/Harris just as antifa has under Trump. This paradoxical effect always happens. Radical liberals have thrived under Trump.

I think billionaires have better ways of funding campaigns if they want to do that. These headlines are completely meaningless to them.   You don’t think that people in the bottom 95% of the income bracket could be donating to Biden and excited about the first black female VP?

Donnie sounds and acts like a visit to Walter Reed may be in his near future. Listening to Biden and Harris was the silk purse, #45 is not the sow's ear, it's the sow's rear.

O boy.  Do you find it kinda strange that she said she beloved the women that accused Biden and. Ow she stands by his side?  O well all is fair in war I guess
Biden and Harris should schedule daily press briefings right across Trump’s time every day, and take open questions. The media will soon figure out which is worthwhile and which is a train wreck.
We have to tackle an issue at a time brother. The most important issue right now is that we need a candidate that will at least hear the black agenda and be pursuaded to adopt it. Biden/Harris are without doubt that pair. Unless we differ in opinion here, but I know we don’t.
Are you having a Teams meeting with Joe Biden?
BLKs didn't put Trump in there so it's not BLKs responsibility to get him out. Those debates Trump will make Biden look crazy like he shouldn't even be driving let alone running for Prez. No winners here but truth be told I think the Liberals are actually worse.

Joe Biden says work hard and you’ll be fine.  But seriously, I hope a resolution to your troubles can be found.

The other poll earlier today from Reuters/Ipsos had Biden up by 16 points. The range between all the polling is too wide to really know what's going on.

I’m a suburban wife, mom and professional and I am proud to be voting for Biden and Harris in 2020I'm  curious to see what happens when ...biden wins and the riots don't stop. Will they "realize" that they are also apart of the problem.
Trump to Biden??
quick question what do you think will happen if biden gets elected ?
News Flash!  Joe Biden avoids all questions about anything.  Film of him in his basement bunker at 11.
Buried THIRTEEN MINUTES into tonight's  we're told a lawyer in OBAMA's/BIDEN's  will plead GUILTY to falsifying a  email that was used to ILLEGALLY get a FISA warrant to SPY on the Trump Campaign prior to the 2016 Election.

Chris is a 🤡🤡🤡....he knows Biden is Fack’d
Let the campaign of deception begin. Biden and Harris are the most radical leftists to ever run for Pres and VP in US history.
Remember...if you don't vote for Biden, "you ain't black!" And if it's because you don't like Harris, it's because you're racist.
Johnson's spurious "investigation" is obviously an abusive attempt to use his power to damage Biden by "allegation" - a longtime Republican tactic. It stinks to high heaven &amp; it will fail coz there's no there there, BUT it illustrates the depths of Johnson's corruption.

If one more person who supports Trump calls Biden creepy I may lose my shit.
If you're pro-life, pro-liberty, pro-science, and pro-sanity, you can't vote for Joe Biden. The choice couldn't be clearer.  This election isn't about political preferences like usual, it's a national decision about whether truth and liberty matter anymore.
IMO if Biden wins, the panic will be reduced, but the control over citizens will remain the same as if the panic was ongoing, because Dems like Biden have been conditioning people to accept more govt control over their lives (new normal). That's what Biden's mask mandate is about
This virtue signalling to the far-left isn't going to go well for Biden-Harris on election day. I'd be very interested to see swing state polls on this proposed mandate.
Correct...but even with this, how does ANYONE take serious what Biden says?  I'll be doggone if I ever listen to the words of a puppet.
How are both of my parents gonna quietly out-praxis me and still voted for biden in the primaries like that.

5 Takeaways From Kamala Harris’s First Full Day on the Biden Ticket
Shut up trump. It certainly didn’t collapse when Biden was Vice President did it? You’re the problem right now. You act like a baby
Swore in as Indian American now running for VP as African American... Kamala Harris is the Trojen horse for Joe Biden to hide his racism even she exposed earlier.
Joe Biden played his hand and lost. Hypocrite Kamala Harris (who openly labeled him a racist) will not pull him through. Trump for 4 more years. #MAGA2020
My opinion, for the little that its worth, is to elect Biden/Harris and STILL show up in the streets regularly to demand the action and policies we want. The people have been awoken and it is up to everyone one of us to keep them awake.
You finding something hard to believe is a failure on your part. I truly have no preference between Trump and Biden. They are both trash. Our system is stronger than either of them.
I don't owe my vote to anyone. Don't bring that "throwing away your vote" bullshit my way. Both Biden and Trump are trash and I don't want either of them in office.
At this point, that is more than enough. I'd love to see a progressive revolution, but I don't think its going to happen this year. Instead, we will elect Biden/Harris and then harness our passion for progress to hold them accountable at every turn. If they fail, they go home.
OMFG!! What a mess this fall is gonna be...stay tuned. Lock her up!!  Threats against former VP Biden...

I'm not sure you've seen the state of politics in this country lately. We don't have a ton of great options laid before us here. Realistically, Biden and Trump are our options and while I strongly dislike Biden I despise Trump and everything he stands for. It's a no brainer.
Ok I guess  is in the business of getting Biden elected president.  They spent The Whole day covering him and Nasty 🤢 Kamala Harris at nauseium   And then wouldn’t even cover Trump’s press conference
Billy want no debates between Trump &amp; Biden bc Trump will trumped Joe every time! Pence will have to be aggressive more than Harris bc she will be president if they win!
Agree, but Dems don't live in reality. To answer your question - Beijing Biden.
Kamala wasn't chosen to be VP nominee b/c she'll win over new voters for Biden, although she may win some minorities who vote based solely on identity politics.  She was chosen to be Biden's attack dog, to make the election a referendum on Trump &amp; scare ppl away from voting Trump
You know she's going to claim the election was illegitimate when Biden loses. Maybe Russia hoax 2.0.

Trump literally promised to defund SS over the weekend. Biden wants to keep payroll tax and expand it to income of 400k+ with no cap, which will in fact expand social security so that argument is moot. Plus Kamala left that position nearly a decade ago
Thought the same thing when I heard him pronounce her name.  Even though he ran in primaries with her &amp; Bo Biden and her were such good friends... Hmmm

These comments by Kamala back in October make more sense now in light of Biden's team choosing her as VP nominee. She played the long game.
trump is gonna end up being president again just because y’all think not voting for Biden is gonna prove something 🤦🏾‍♀️

I'm seeing a lot of people saying that we should vote for Biden because he's not Trump and I don't think anyone remembered what happened when we said that last time unfortunately.
Biden's running mate running the show would be true no matter who he chose though, whether it was Kamala or someone else. So your reply doesn't address Kurt's question.
Kamala was chosen because she's as shameless a liar as you'll find, &amp; will be Biden's attack dog, while the MSM writes puff pieces about her unique heritage, as they've already begun doing.  Dual goals: make election referendum on DJT while hyping potential of 1st black woman VP.
Just so we can catch our breath for a minute and get the Rona under control. I haven't craved stability like this since I was 8...Biden flawed as hell, but like...lol
Elizabeth, I’m responding to the constant attacks on Joe Biden that he is in decline and hiding in his basement. You think those attacks are okay?
She can't even pretend to be an advocate of law &amp; order, b/c the Dem base is openly calling to defund police in cities across the US.  Kamala is just Biden's attack dog who will constantly attack Trump &amp; try to make the election a referendum on him as Biden has been trying to do.
please explain how Kamala is bad for trump  lol  I mean Biden picking a cop is one thing in this day and age, but a CROOKED  one?!?  PLEASE! lol  Tulsi Gabbard had no shot at the nomination and crushed Kamala in the debates.

Wouldn’t you love to see Trump ride a bike or try jogging. He couldn’t last 30 seconds with Joe Biden.
I hope Biden/Harris is the worst ticket I ever have to consider voting for. Trump/Pence is obviously excluded because if I didn’t vote for him the first time how could I now
Cis folx, I’m going to need you to talk w/ yr friends. Come fall, the Trump plans to put trans youth in the crosshairs. Why? He’s hoping to appeal to cis women leaning Biden who are under-educated on trans issues &amp; susceptibile to scare tactics. Be prepared to defend trans kids.
You think they're the same? I am not asking this to be funny, I'm legit curious. Biden was not what I wanted, but I understand why he absolutely needs to win in November.

#nastywoman dude  is in full dbag mode:  "President Trump responds to Kamala Harris’ selection as Biden’s VP and political analysts look at how it might impact the race"
I’m a trans person who believes in abolition. My excitement over Harris is excitement over strategy: it was the smartest choice Biden could have made &amp; it’ll help them win. These candidates aren’t my ideal choice, but they’ll ensure the ouster of a transphobic white supremacist.
Omg!! He most certainly should. I want him arrested on the steps of the Capitol after President Biden has been sworn in. Pompeo and Barr should go down with him for being his accomplices. The most corrupt administration EVER!!
Da fuq are you babbling about? We stopped listening to Bernie when he endorsed Biden. We don't give a shit about him anymore.
Do you really think anybody gives a shit about a debate between Pence and Harris? everybody wants to see the annihilation that Trump will put on Biden in their debate. Sleepy Joe is going to look really stupid!
Biden/Harris: Liberty &amp; Justice for All Biden/Harris: Better Together, Better for All Biden/Harris: Together We Can
With that logic, They might as well just flip the ticket then since Biden is just going to step aside anyways.
What voters are Biden's strategists expecting to win over by choosing Kamala? I don't see her moving the needle with any group of voters.
Hell No.  no desire to be run By a socialist communist ticket of Biden/Harris
Your statement isn’t diverse enough. According to Joe Biden that’s because you’re a member of the African American community. I will absolutely not be voting for Joe Biden. Having you in office would be even worse.
Did you know that the best way to defund the police is having a former cop as Vice President? It’s like Biden saw everything that was going on and said “I don’t care about this”. Can we have a new election where we don’t have selfish idiots running for President.
Did you know joe biden has an island swiming distance from. Pedo island  with a submarine port on it. Have you seen biden sniff girls on live TV. How about kamala falsely imprisoned blacks and POC's when a prosecutor, then joked about getting high on radio.It’s quite obvious Biden can only win via voter fraud.
This is the worst pick Biden (DNC could have picked . . Kamala is about to get destroyed. Too much ammo .

I am not sure why Bishop Tobin makes this distinction for 2020 as the Democrats have been awfully pro-choice going back a long long time. Biden is no less Catholic today than he was in 2008. He should have been formally excommunicated a long time ago.
Don't believe for one minute. Awful funny others were ahead and she pulls it out, just like Biden on SC. IT'S CALLED BALLOT HARVESTING/STUFFING AND GEORGE SORO'S!!!

U are a far, far cry from a conservative, u are a RINO.  You fooled us all but never again. U choose Biden u choose the radical left.  Have fun with that!!

Biden smears himself every time the mic is in front him .
Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out as they say. Good luck with loosing everything you've EVER worked for, should Biden win. But it won't EVER HAPPEN.
Obviously Biden doesn't have any balls to stand up for himself. And its disgraceful to be picked only because you're a Black woman, not because of your qualifications.
I just wanna watch the Biden vs Trump debate .
There is no way on earth Biden would last 4 years . I’ll bet anything he steps down after 2years at the most and hands it over to who the real DNC candidate is . Listen to joe just 4 years ago compared to today . He’s got some serious cognitive issues.
It’s because Biden is the alternative. No thanks
If Joe Biden comes out of his hole and sees his shadow, its 4 more years of Donald J. Trump. #Trump2020
If you vote Biden, you need to take a break from the news. If you vote trump, ur suddenly a racist? This country is a joke. Again, like in 2016, i will not be apart of this artificial mess. Presidents are puppets of the pharmaceutical and military industial complex. Role playing

Uh I didn't say I wasn't voting. Trump and Biden are not the only option 🤦‍♀️
She's not out of a job because a customer complained.  She resigned because she refused to wear non-political mask. If people started wearing Trump or Biden masks it would be the same issue.
Well according to Joe Biden  black people  must think a certain way . Or “you ain’t black”
No real Catholic would ever support abortion as Biden does.
Tbh, I thought the same with the Bernie debate. I'm not defending him or his cognitive decline, which is apparent, but whatever the hell they give trump so that he can do 45 minute pressers, they are giving it to Biden. Biden bareley gaffed in the debate, he just ruthlessly lied.

Your state can now penalize electoral college members who don’t vote the way the state votes  if we have enough votes to Biden (like 80-100 mill) and Trump wins the electoral vote (with say 62 mill), it’ll give credence to those fighting against it
Imagine making fun of a picture of someone when they’re 4 years old. You and Biden would get along well.   Btw I have plenty of pics. Sorry y’all don’t know how to work Twitter. 😎 glad I muted this conversation, I got 55 and older twitter triggered 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Insane to me how people have forgotten how much he's fucked up the EPA, department of education, and now post office and yet so many are still saying that Biden is just as bad
That’s what I’m primarily focused on too.  It’s more a question of if I can vote for Biden based on personal morality than anything strategic.  Strategy is pro-Biden, sadly.
The probability distribution given here (27% Trump wins narrowly, 40% Biden wins narrowly or convincingly, 33% Biden wins in a once-per-century landslide) seems pretty realistic to me at the gut level ... though I'm a bit surprised by that 33%.
Biden is widely known to be a gun owner

So, what action are you taking to secure the Postal Service and the General election?  I have asked similar questions of several Representatives and Senators as well as Senator Harris and Vice President Biden.  So far no replies.
It is worth us over 60 year olds drinking a vat of COVID on the way into the polling location just to relish the vote for Joseph Biden and Kamala Harris. Anything to get trump* out
I have heard Biden talk he doesn't sound like someone with Alzheimer. Now if you was talking about trump he does and it's getting worse
If twitter discourse was as powerful as some people claim, all the #insertnameisover people would have no jobs, and Joe Biden and about 17 other candidates would have never even been taken seriously. Yet here we are demanding that people with Squidward avatars be quiet

No. He didn't give the outgoing admin. Information. That's not being untruthful. Even Strok said there was nothing. Everyone in the meeting on January 5th with Obama and Biden there said there was nothing.

For the 1st and hopefully last time I'll be voting for leadership over policy. This country needs it badly. Then hopefully Biden we'll step aside after 4 years for a fresh election.
I get all of that. And I have plenty of criticisms of Biden. I just kind of felt bad for him after reading it. They just seemed totally dismissive of him and openly mock him behind his back.
I thought Joe Biden follows science 😃🤷🏻‍♂️
Biden signs are all over Cuyahoga country (Cleveland) Ohio. So depressing. I can’t even convince close friends to come to their senses. 😞
That Politico article actually makes Biden sympathetic and makes me dislike Obama and his staffers even more.
Did I see the first bumper sticker for the Dem VP today on the East Side of Cleveland? "Biden/Harris 2020 Because I am not an Idiot!"
Mueller, like Biden, doesn’t seem to know what day it is. They are just props for the leftists. It’s actually kind of sad to watch.

So how did RINO John Kasich get to the point where he is endorsing Joe Biden and speaking for him at the DNC this year? .... His CONSCIENCE of course! 😂😂
I am from northern Ohio. “Blue Territory”. For every 1 Biden sign there are 20 Trump signs. Cuyahoga county is a Dem county historically but Trump did extremely well here in ‘16 and no reason to believe he won’t again.  These “polls” must not be actually polling anyone.
At least we don’t get a constant stream of lies from Biden
We don’t need your vote, coward. If you understand anything about politics then you’ll understand that twitter comments don’t drive policy and that Joe Biden, if elected, will act as a moderate democrat. He’s already doing so.
‘The influence that Russia, China or Iran could exert over public opinion in the United States is a tiny fraction of that which is exerted by the unaccountable U.S. billionaire media...’
For people curious why people say this. It's because the problems are deeper than Trump. They are systemic problems. And people are afraid Biden will wallpaper over them and people will pretend everything is alright. Many people want real change. Not just a good feeling.
A vote for Biden is a vote for socialism sorry I live in a democracy I don’t need freebies I need to have jobs a good economy the ability to protect myself I was a democrat my entire life but no more they lost their way and just want power and money educate yourselves
Nahhhh. I'll celebrate by voting for Biden/Harris.  Kisses!

This is really messed up. Anyone wanting Biden to win should simply be clearly telling voters they need to get their ballot requests in now (or soon) and return their ballots, correctly, as soon as they get them. There won't be a problem then.

Do we really want Biden to be POTUS as we remember the 20th anniversary of 9/11?
We should be pissed off. We arent a joe Biden victory away from change.if we want it, were going to need to take it
There is very little difference between trump &amp; Biden.
The fact is, voters have never had access to more information/media in the history of the country. Bernie had no trouble getting his message out. There were like 20 debates, all broadcast live! Biden won because a lot more voters preferred him as a candidate. That's it.
Jenny: Were you excited by the VP pick? Me: It didn't make me any more or less excited to vote for Joe Biden. J: But, did it give you hope? M: I don't have any more or less hope than before the VP pick.  BUT I AM STILL GOING TO VOTE!
The bigger point is that there is absolutely no evidence of a media conspiracy/bias to elect Biden or to prevent Bernie from winning--full stop.  Bernie supporters are second only to Trump supporters in blaming the "media" for their problems.

This election has absolutely nothing to do with Biden.  People are either voting #Trump or #NotTrump
And what do you want me to do about that? You better be voting for Biden/Harris regardless
Actually that would yes to a vaccine with 66 percent saying yes. Coincides with the 74 percent support for masks. That’s why Biden suggested the mandate. Not good for trump
Her record as DA/AG &amp; abhorrent behavior in regards to how she treated Cavanaugh must be called out.  Her inconsistent statements &amp; lying need to be called out.  She potentially could be a heartbeat away from the presidency.  Trump &amp; Pence need to go after her AS HARD as Biden.

Again, this is all just anecdotal, most of which were jokes or gaffes and received much more backlash than the comments themselves.  The only attempt I've seen to quantify something like this had Biden's negative coverage higher overall:

That's exactly what we are doing right now. we are paying attention to who we gonna put in office. And Biden ain't it.
If this "general strike" is separate from electoral politics, why are you striking for the democratic platform, namely Biden's platform?
Vote for Biden. He’s a decent human being. Otherwise it’s a vote for Trump
Are you asking Biden why he's so racist? Same pointless question
I'm not sure what a "moderate" Democrat is. Is it one who: Is pro-life?  Or Supports Police? Favors American workers over illegal immigrants? Or Is pro Israel? Which of these do Biden/Harris support?

Harris knows Biden is going to last that why this wants to be a black woman when it's time to get the black vote is all smiles. Cornel West should no this.
Okay but not with Biden.

This is just anecdotal, conspiratorial nonsense.  The media covered Biden the most, and Bernie second, because that's where they stood in the polls from the start.  Do you think the media was biased against Klobuchar because they gave Bernie 8 times as much coverage?

People keep talking about Elizabeth Warren as majority leader but if elected Biden will use all his pull to get Schumer chosen
Why don’t they ask joe Biden Obama and kamala the same question lol
What in the world does that have to do with anything? You're saying that because one TV network didn't carry Bernie's announcement live IN A DIFFERENT ELECTION that the public was somehow duped into electing Biden four years later?
Look at the exit polls in the primaries for one. Two, CNN, and other mainstream media did nothing but feed the narrative that bernie, whonwas smashing joe at the time, was unelectable . Meanwhile when biden finally ekked out his first win, they declared it over.
This is such an absurd premise.  Biden led in the polls from day one.  Nobody "force fed" anyone anything.  There was a primary election, which Biden won overwhelmingly, even after losing the first two states which probably gave other candidates like Bernie a big advantage.
Trump cause then after this term he is gone and not really a Biden fan.

It’s really simple the US has a two party system. This is a fact. The are no members of Congress who represents a membership in minority party.  Any vote or non vote is always a plus for a incumbent.  If you don’t want trump your choice is the opposition that’s Biden.  That’s it.

Before you go getting ahead of yourself, remember Joe Biden beat Kamala Harris in the primary.
You can cherry pick any "study" you want, but dead people have been voting for years. Fraud is the only way someone like Biden can beat Trump.
And yet Biden mask mandate got more airtime ...if ever a boycott was appropriate I'm all in for media boycott
So 3 days after Biden's Inauguration??
I saw 1 Biden sign today. I travel between Ohio and Pennsylvania every week. Trump stuff everywhere. 1 Biden sign. Got a Trump car flag, sub slogan "No More Bullshit"
You transposed Biden’s name for the totally incompetent tRump! #VoteBlueImpeachTheTraitors
So know we know who the real candidate is Jill Biden
got some news for you, biden and obama started that. it won’t change, you just won’t hear about it anymore.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the most radical Democrats in the country? Lmaooooo
This. As a socialist, I have major policy disagreements with Biden and Harris. But I’d much rather have them in office than a fascist asshole like Trump.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
“No questions Biden and his nurse?”
Private prison industry backs Trump, prepares if Biden wins
Maybe that's why Biden's Attorney General Barr had #JefferyEpstein murdered to cover up... OH WAIT, that was the TRUMP toady doing the #coverup!
I would like to go to the North Pole and spend the next 2 1/2 months with Santa and not hear. see or feel what's going on here until 11/3/2020. I can't stand Biden or Harris.
Joe Biden will never be president!!
My favorite part! “Just when you think darkness’s is descending,Joe Biden shows up!” 🤣 Thanks Joe!
Biden raises $26M in 24 hours after Harris VP announcement
I asked for no more scam calls and the first thing I get his news from CNN Joe Biden and Kamala Harris supporting the new green deal shut down the steel mills close the coal mines they're all in buy China the US will never be the same shove it
Biden’s Ultra Ego Joe/Jim/Crow 👱🏿‍♂️
Luckily Biden has a big family or that crowd would’ve been cut in half.
Although she got an Indian lineage but she is an anti- India and her agenda is similar to George Soros. It is just an attempt from Biden to curtain and to gain sympathy as their BLM and the foreign policies were exposed.
I agree. I don’t support a lot of decisions she’s made in the past but she’s still stronger than Biden in my opinion. He needs someone sharper than he is by his side. Warren would have put me at ease for sure though.

Biden reportedly mocked for using script to tap Kamala Harris as his running mate  via
From the president to Biden and Harris to the Gov of my state, all the way down to my local representatives...I feel COMPLETELY unrepresented on every level. No one worth a shit as a human being is even able to get on a ballot to vote for to make any good changes cuz the system
Great endorsement for Biden
I don’t think the polls will affect Trump voters at all as there does seem to be an undercount of Trump support as there was in 2016, but as Biden begins to lose his lead the left will be having deja vu all over again.
Yeah, that’s exactly why you shouldn’t vote for sniffin’ sleepy joe Biden
Hey pst I’m not voting for Kamala or Biden k thanks.
‘She’s up to the task’: Democrats excited about Kamala Harris joining Joe Biden on 2020 ticket
I know Biden got in trouble for saying it...but to paraphrase him, it they don't vote this time "they ain't black".
With you all the way Dr. Biden. #BidenHarris2020
I can guarantee we'll be seeing some mainstream media outlets coming out with stories on why Biden and Harris don't actually fit together or something dumb like that.
Walking my dog listening to Joe Biden, I laughed out loud when he called Trump "whiny". Preach Uncle Joe, preach!
It is weird. I expected her to be Biden's VP for months. I am excited the announcement is made, but my enthusiasm didn't change. So I get the excitement everyone has, but I just am not overly pumped up. I wish I was. But I got my expectation. And I like all the choices.
Fuck Biden and Trump, the only one who can save us is Adam Sandler
Ask Pope Francis about  being a Catholic - read your Bible and DO NOT JUDGE.  VP Biden is a much better man than you, there will be enough bishops like you in hell to hold a Bible conference!

FUNNY THAT BIDEN AND HARRIS WILL APPEAR IN A GYMNASIUM WITH ONLY A HANDFUL OF MEDIA PEOPLE AND NO REAL AUDIENCE.   GYMANASIUM???  COULD TRUMP BE WAITING BEHIND IT FOR JOE???    😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
They are literally wacko... And you don’t hear a damn word against these so called Antifa PEACEFUL PROTESTER’S from the fake media or anyone from the left including sleepy in the basement Joe Biden. They are nothing but a big joke.God help our country if he ever gets voted in.
Waiting to see Biden/Harris   4pm now I guess. Dinner prep can wait.
Voting for Biden/Harris
You have been calling Biden a slam dunk for weeks now. Have you changed your mind?
Look, I'm a Liberal myself and understand the problems w/Biden. But our election system isn't built to support idealism. You gotta take progress anyway you can even if that means voting for less regression. You're not just voting for Biden, your voting for Democratic control.
you really don’t want me to vote for biden do you?

You see her that way, and I understand. I look at Her in terms of “she’s a moderate that pairs well with Biden, who we are stuck with, and may swing moderate Republicans his way.” Change doesn’t occur overnight, and the first step toward improving our country is to eradicate DT.
Sure she can. If she supports Biden the stupidity knows no bounds
Biden harris has my vote november 3rd
Why didn’t Biden just tap Officer C. Balls for the VP?
There’s nobody that DOESN’T see that the Dems stepped in and gave Biden - after he clearly couldn’t stop himself from making racist statements - the most “but some of my best friends are black” VP candidate, right?
This “suburban housewife” can decide for herself as to who she’ll for, thank you. I am an educated woman of the 21st century. I am deeply offended by Trump’s comments. Even in the 1950’s that comment would have been derogatory. Biden/Harris have my vote, as well as my family’s.
. Breakfast Club Reacts To Joe Biden Picking Kamala Harris As Running Mate
wait... kamala harris is biden’s vp? i thought we were joking....
The most frightening part is when the Dems decide Biden is not up to the task and Kamala becomes president.   Travesty of immeasurable  proportion.
It’s not going to be Biden/Harris that dimantles the NRA, it’s going to be your crooked officers.
Fucking Biden prolly didnt even know... or he forgot
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
I guess they figure since xenophobia worked so well against Obama, it's worth a shot versus Biden. Sad.
Yesterday Gad said Kamala called Biden ”racist”, she didn't. He got some push back. He pivots to ”satire”. This is Gad’s crutch.
That was a sweet memory lane of Joe Biden, Mika. Should have remembered your friend when you did that gotcha interview. But we learn from our mistakes eventually. #MorningJoe
I can’t wait for the Biden/Harris ticket to win in a landslide and shut these loons up
You got me a bit with a dab line too 😂 I’ll do the rare twitter admission that I was a pretty big dick and I apologize for that. But I still want you to vote Biden 😁
I’m not saying Biden is perfect but he’s a better man than trump in every way imaginable. I’ll give trump the edge in a hotdog contest but that’s it
Well I make under 250k a year so trump couldn’t give two fucks about me. Maybe your rich if so I get why your republican. I do believe Biden has the better interest of the entire country and I don’t think it’s laughable. This country is a shitshow under trump
I don’t even like Biden that much. I liked Cory Booker by the was one of the first ones out. But come on dude you smile dabs your not an anti mask ass you should be in our side
Guilting me that’s low. I’ll not lie I do hate him more than pretty much anyone alive but I’m asking seriously how can you think Biden is a rapist and trump isn’t? He basically said it himself with the pussy grabbing. And Biden had what one accuser trump had like 20
It doesn’t matter who Biden picked for his VP, leftists are determined to hate anyone who gets nominated and walk Trump into a second term lmao
Biden won for sure, that's why such drastic destruction, so the rich can hurry and buy shit up
Biden-Harris It took me three google searches to confirm it wasn’t satire, and that indeed, these are the picks.   How does this happen?
If Joe Biden wants to be President he needs to up his nickname game. Slow Joe and Phony Kamala. (I prefer Joe Kamalface 2020) Slow Joe is pretty good. How about  Small hands McGillicuddy Orangutan boobs Hire me #BidenHarris2020 I will create a name calling committee.
biden jus made a terrible move 🤦🏼‍♀️
Congratulations Senator. I look forward to casting that vote in November for Biden/Harris.
LMFAO ok so Biden touching woman on the shoulders is her calling him a rapist. Cuz I’m not seeing it in that little pic you put there

We’re still voting Biden, but the DNC trying to do everything in their power not to get us to vote for him huh
This will make strategy meetings a bit uncomfortable
Politics is all dirty.Biden has been in office over 40 years, if pple wasn't fed up with our Government, we wouldn't elect Donald. I'm not for open boarders, I'm against socialism..No one should get to live off of others hard work unless they are disable  Helping to a degree ok.

She wasn’t my number 1 choice (Tammy Duckworth, FTR), but he could’ve picked a rock out of his backyard and I would still voted for Biden/Backyard Rock over even considering a trump vote.
It’s official! Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate
Getting on the record Biden's choice has GOTTA be Harris for VP! America's Black community has purchased this honor in spilled blood and lost treasured sons and daughters. #BidenHarris202 🤞🙏🥳🎉♥️👍
BREAKING: NBC News reports Sen. Kamala Harris has been chosen as Biden's running mate

The way I won't be making donations to the Biden campaign any longer if he picks Rice.
I have two neighbors with Biden signs in their yard.  Both are friendless.
While you idiots are worried about Mr. Biden you should be worried what is happening in the sports world.  Revenue is being lost and the economy is not as great as you feel.  No College No NFL = Economical decline.
Says the people who have ripped Biden for any word jumble for the last 20 years.
But he says Biden is goofy...?
Well Biden prefers his to be minors...so there’s that
Me after receiving a text from Biden saying that he chose Susan Rice
Holy shit, I seriously hope the Pete Buttigeig rumor is true. Biden picking him as his VP would be hilarious. Not because Buttigeig is good. He’s not. He’s an awful VP pick. But because I want to see the centrist “vote blue no matter who™️” Dems lose their fucking minds.
I don't want hear any more about Biden's mental state, look who he's up against. #HistoricalFiction
Joe Biden changed his name to Joe Lying #JoeLying

I'll most likely vote for Biden no matter who he chooses for VP but if he picks someone that doesn't generate enthusiasm and loses, that's on Biden. He's known for months that he has an enthusiasm gap and hasn't done anything about it.

Tell me again how Biden is too old for office?
Everyday even without a venue. He'd debate anything Biden says, even if he agrees with him. Then later lie and deny. But not in a formal setting. He knows he can't answer the questions!
Nice. I personally like this approach. Earlier Biden ads were a little bland IMO. Joe as the adult in the room...because he is. #Biden2020

Biden doesn't get to pick his VP, Obama does and he's good at insulting.
IMO, Biden is behaving the way he's told to behave by the Kenyan whose sharpest weapon was racism.  I can't imagine anyone voting for Biden except to be against Trump.  In my lifetime, there's never been more pathetic democratic candidates for POTUS as 2020.
Just watched an interview with Jill Biden on CBS,  now that is what a First Lady should be.  Can't wait until November.
I didnt get my fucking choice either. But so the fuck what? I am a fucking adult and can evaluate my fucking choices...which is binary. You get Biden or Trump. Choose fucking wisely while you are whining in your toddler tantrum.
I wouldn’t debate the motherfucker unless he addressed his opponent as Vice President Biden. He earned it.
Please clarify. Are you saying that Biden did this?
I met him once, just a regular Joe, so to speak. Trump, by comparison, made creepy remarks about his own daughter, Miss USA contestants and hung out with Epstein. Is there a tape of Biden talking about grabbing women by their, well, you know?
He'll flame out. He lost a lot of black folks when put on the MAGA hat. Not to mention, he's mentally ill. Pretty sad that some Republicans are so nervous about Biden that they're sending this kook donations.
No, it's fair game, Trump and his ilk will continue to question Biden's fitness, mentally and physically...just returning the favor.
Meghan McCain really isn't voting for Biden?
I feel like this VP choice is completely different though. Biden’s not running for re-election.
Girl, I'm already seeing leftists talk about how he's going to beat Biden because of this.
Unfortunately yes. I work with people who will vote for Biden simply because the union tells them to. But not this guy. Trump 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
ISN'T EVERYTHING HE SAYS??😂🤣  Biden quips to Fox News he decided on VP, campaign says it's a joke
So don’t vote for Trump because Congress is screwing you over ? That is exactly what they want . That’s why he said he would take executive action. How about don’t vote for Biden because dog turds are nasty tasting! 🤔🤔🤔

Who will Biden pick? Democratic lawmakers weigh in on possible VP picks
Imagine how people would react if that was Biden's or Obama's head!
I predict that within 30 minutes of the first debate Biden will lose the support of 15-20% of his support. Look what happened to Ford in 76.
Do the Dems not realize that on day one of a Biden presidency the Repubs will push for the 25th amendment to remove Biden?  If not they are truly delusional.
Biden can’t even remember what he ate for breakfast yesterday wtf are u talking about??? The guy literally can’t talk for 5 or 10 minutes without losing his complete train of thought
It's no wonder Biden has such a hard time doing interviews or answering questions..... You ever try to talk with BOTH feet in your mouth??
Inaccurate.  He ASKED him if he was a junkie.That was in a dreadfully expressed comparison:asking Biden to take cognitive test presumes he may have cog.  impairment, just as asking the reporter to take a drug test presumes he may be junkie. I don’t support Biden; I support truth.
My mind is made up, and no debate will change a thing. It's Biden for me. I've had quite enough of his opponent's blathering.
This after his interview with Charlamagne tha God back in May. Smh.  Biden seeks to clarify comment that Latino community is diverse, 'unlike the African American community'  I can't wait for the debates.
He wants more debates because Biden is incoherent and bumbling. His campaign has 0 substance. He will talk him off the stage.
You said Obama was going to take everyone’s guns away. He didn’t. Now you’re saying Biden will? He won’t. Safer processes to obtain firearms doesnt equate to someone breaking down your door and taking your guns. How gullible you must be to believe this moron.

Sorry, that's the Orange guy's boyfriend. And Biden is picking a woman.Now that’s really funny. Obama and Biden had worst recovery in the history of America and they want to claim some sort of success? Amazing how well they lie and just don’t care. Too bad more Americans can’t see through it and sad journalist don’t call them out.
Only cheaters Nancy are you and the rest of the liberals in in Washington.  I can see it now, Biden’s losing and guess what we just found a 10 truckloads of votes and they are all for Biden. So sad you can’t win on merits and have to cheat.

It isn't about Biden...it's about power and control. Pelosi can't wait to take control over this country. Term Limits. We must get her out of the Whitehouse.
And you had the same thoughts about Palin? I think she was female. Too bad Biden thought it more important to choose a black woman then someone competent .
Like they did for Palin? Funny how you think this woman should be protected. If she can’t handle it she should step down. Too bad Biden thought a black woman was more important and someone competent .
Well Biden didn’t have much of a choice did he. Too bad he decided a black woman was more important then someone competent. Sorry but Harris way to far left we can let her win.
It shows their priorities when Biden &amp; Pelosi, who have been lauded by msm for being devout Catholics, support a woman that once said that being a member of the K of C should disqualify a person from being elected PUTUS.
Isn't the USPS endorsing Biden a conflict of interest ? I'm not even voting for Trump but can definitely see corruption happening with it. What's wrong with voting in person with an ID ?
The USPS endorsed Biden. A clear conflict of interest. It's not hard to figure out why he wouldn't want it. What's wrong with voting in person with an ID
Don't you think it's a conflict of interest the USPS endorsed Biden ?
What she does is like every liberals she just says what she thinks people want to hear. She has no real values. Will bring in no votes for Biden. Middle American to smart and would like so law and order restored.
Hell Biden can’t even pronounce it right. Who the hell cares. And we wonder why no one watches CNN.
That is a huge crowd for biden they must have came from all over the country
If biden is good for America why didnt he do anything good for America while he was obamas vise president? He had 8 years and done nothing but make his son rich and family rich
She should be in prison along with Biden he was saved by announcing or he would have been indicted with his son for money laundering!!
This is some funny BS rite here. Biden has no chance of beating Trump.  h
There goes that "nasty" line he uses against any woman who stands against him. When Biden kicks his butt during the election, Kamala can tell him to get his nasty ass out of the white house and never come back.

Everyone saying Trump can’t ride a bike. The man owns several gulf courses and is able to do 18 holes with no problem.  He also remembers where he is at unlike Biden.
If Biden was President and did same thing. You would be praising him as a great president. So Frank just shut up!
Yes the liberal way,  even if they are a jackass we will build them up. Problem for Biden is he has no one to pick that doesn’t come with a lot of baggage. That’s what you get when you limit yourself to black women. Maybe he should pick a qualified person.
she won't be. she's a small fish. optics. it will be a woman of color from the Obama administration. my money is on Susan Rice. that gets hildabeast back in the door. declare biden incompetent, take the lead, pick VP. the trick will be to win. and they won't.
I wear my Trump gear to work.. I'm fotunate to have a boss who supports Tump.. A very nice man walked into the bar (saw my T-shirt ) and proceeded to tell me why he hated Tump.. I politely listened, then asked him if he was voting for Biden and he said HELL NO! 😊
Maybe Biden will nominate Obama for his vp...that makes more sense than anyone else people have been talking about.
Off with him...my turn... This should shake up the few brain cells covid didn't kill. Since I know you loved him so much...this is Biden as well.👇
I have not seen any Biden flags, yard signs, bumper stickers, none at all. I see lots of Trump supporters almost everyone I know is voting for Trump. He will win Ohio

Biden is going to lose and lose big. People are seeing he is not physically and mentally ready to be president!

Joe Biden insults black Americans AGAIN, says 'Latino community' has more ‘diverse’ views and attitudesBiden is not sharp compared to when he was VP. He’s getting worse and to deny it is dangerous. He’s going to limp into the WH. And if he was able to actively campaign like normal he wouldn’t be able to hide it. Why can’t we all admit both candidates suck. Biden sucks less
Now provide excuses for avoiding any remotely respected reporter. And don’t site Trump. He’s another issue all together. Biden is mentally not able to handle the media and his people don’t want us to see it.

Their convention isn’t long enough to talk about all their lies, corruption, and inappropriate actions with others. Questions:Biden,exaggerates, makes stuff up, forgets &amp; Kamala just can’t answer a question if not scripted and shoots from hip!
Biden just copies everything President Trump does and calls it his and Obama’s.
Scary to think if Biden/Harris win and Joe is deemed unable to serve as President that We will have a President and Vice President no one voted for.

What I don’t “get” is the 3 months. :) I mean, if the incubation period is 10-14 days, you would only need that much to mandate. Add 2 weeks as ‘insurance’ and it would be a month, not 3. 3 months covers Election Day which means Biden’s idea is bunk.
Not Surprised 🤯
✊🏾✊🏾 Voting Biden/Harris this November!!!
T RUMP WHO HATES PEOPLE OF COLOR IS USING A BLACK MAN WEST TO TAKE VOTES AWAY FROM BIDEN.  IT'S GONNA BACKFIRE ON THE REPUBLICANS.  THEY ARE THE ONES WHO WILL LOOSE VOTES.  DEMOCRATS ALREADY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT AND NOTHING WILL STOP THEM.

I’m not sure if I’ll watch any of it, honestly. My mind is made up and I don’t need anyone to convince me to vote for Biden. Such an easy decision given the competition.

Sweet simple Biden is a old man with mental problems and Harris is a racist, phony, liar, flip flops on many items, does unspeakable things to get promotions, hates America. Today she told so many lies. She is evil.
Biden and Harris should schedule daily press briefings right across Trump’s time every day, and take open questions. The media will soon figure out which is worthwhile and which is a train wreck.
Joe Biden wants you to pay your child support.
Still surprising that you don’t support the man AND the policies, given the door-knocking. Anyway, Bernie will still be a power broker if Biden wins. It’s in the best interest of expanding healthcare + many other policies that Biden wins. That’s why Bernie endorsed.

Probably every single person that voted no donates to Joe Biden’s campaign
The fact that most voters aren’t afraid of Joe Biden is a positive if you actually want to win the election. He’s also an acceptable choice by the progressive wing, who have endorsed him and are agreeing to speak at his nominating convention.
Biden is considerably more popular than Hillary Clinton. Biden will definitely do better than Clinton. And given that Clinton won the popular vote last year (even though she’s cRoOked), Biden will most likely do the same. Last year wasn’t mail in either.
Hahahahahahahahaha! It’s gonna be an uphill battle trying to convince people that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are super lefty libs. This is hilarious.

Something Trump doesn't understand. Biden understands Matthew 7:1-2 as he is a devout Catholic. Trump doesn't go to church and sure doesn't act as though he has any Christian values. I understand that and do try to live up to it.
Thank you! Still growing. I can't wait to see Trump spank Biden. I can't wait to see the debate either. lol

If one of you run into a burning house &amp; save some puppies then they might change their minds, but you don't like dogs, so there's that.I’m not liberal, I just hate the direction this country is going, and I fear for our country if we have 4 more years of this. Not sure if Biden is the answer, I’m just very afraid.
By the way, I never said I was a Biden/Harris supporter. I’m not registered as Republican or Democrat as I believe in voting for the most qualified person. I cannot stand the partisan politics in this country. You can have the biggest fuck in the world and people vote party line
I'm open to anything. One of my best friends is a Democrat and I keep begging him to give me a candidate to vote for. Hillary and Biden??
Yes. It’s name is Biden.
It is. I am a Republican, but find it hard these days. I'm not a fan of Biden at all. I wanted Yang.

Come on  . Take your Dem biased glasses off. You should be asking Biden why in his search he never spoke to one male black candidate? Talk about discrimination. For the next decade everyone will be ruling out hiring males  crucified for female/black discrimination
hey  - ask Biden this - so he discriminated in his VP search by not talking to one male black candidate who was qualified? He only spoke to females that were black - playing up to the gender/race card?
One particular thing Biden said and kept saying that I loved was "Biden and Harris administration"! Never have I heard Trump say Trump and Pence administration.
When Biden wins you watch how fast the hysteria of Covid disappears.
I hope President Biden doesn’t wimp out on us and fail to prosecute all the crimes now being committed.
Oh also I totally missed but that "across the board" thing is also just not true. He doesn't want to get rid of the middle class Trump tax cuts. This is easy stuff. You know you can disagree with Biden while also still be educated about the reality of policy, right?
Yeah Welsey Ross is right. Also, in addition to clearly misunderstanding Biden's proposal, you also really shouldn't be adding knock on effects to your argument like higher utility prices. If Biden passed a carbon tax it'll probably have a rebate or dividend for that anyway!
It’s like he’s a walking ad for Biden!!
If you’re interested in some fun, check out the range of possibilities in their scenarios. Biden could win with 450 or more votes. Or lose with fewer than 200.   Add in what we know on polling since 2016 - which 538 desperately tries to debunk - and November is up for grabs.
She stands for dramatically scaling back the role of the gov, so if you'd like to actually end the past 40 years of neoliberal slide, them she certainly ain't your gal. If you are in a solid state, then Hawkins is good. But voting Biden is swing states is best in the long run IMO
Not aggressive enough =/ no plan at all that can't be expanded upon in future adminstrations  Groups like the Sunrise Org critisize Biden because they think we'd be safer with bolder climate policy, but they also would much rather implement Biden's plan NOW than wait around
Vice President Candidate Sarah Palin went up against Joe Biden when he was Barack Obama's Vice President Candidate in 2008.
Geraldine Ferraro (Working for Walter Mondale), Sarah Palin (Working for John McCain) and Carly Fiorina (Working for Ted Cruz for only one week) were also women Vice President Candidates before Kamala Harris (Working for Joe Biden).
I can’t wait for Biden to get elected and all of this nonsense goes away.
Mitch McConnell must go for his inexcusable/unjustifiable obstruction of our  republic he is a Traitor to our country and the American  blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States vote up and down the ballot and save America &amp;Americans lives
Is Biden also color blind  ???
Biden will blow it for himself.  Lol
Vice President Kamala Harris will be a great addition to the President Joe Biden Administration.
Glad and Joe Biden should never be in the same tweet. Not to mention he fondles women all the time...of course he wants to give them something...but it's not a voice.

I'm not even trying to argue that you need to vote Biden or whatever, I just genuinely don't think you know how entirely pointless that reply was, aside from the point of making people mad and making this hellsite worse.
Okay, let me put this into perspctive, that literally provides nothing to the conversation. The post you're replying to already accepts the premise that Biden won't go for M4A, but a more moderate reform. You understand all you did was say something everyone knows and ad hominem?
Harris and Biden need to use tomorrow as an opportunity to address their mistakes and commit to doing better. We obviously value progress over perfection but we also need accountability to develop trust and really rally behind the #BidenHarris ticket
Hope to see you campaigning for the Biden/Harris campaign!  We need your voice to get rid of 🤡!
Glad Biden didn't care about qualifications
Vote for Joe Biden for President of the United States of America and vote for Kamala Harris for Vice President of the United States of America.  This is going to be epic!!!!!!!!!!!  #BidenHarris2020
Kamala Harris will be the next Vice President of the United States of America in the upcoming President Joe Biden Administration.
Missing my point bud. Even if Biden wanted to get M4A done, he probably couldn't do it. Bernie's healthcare reform would be better, but most likely not single payer.
I'm saying that both Bernie and Biden wouldn't have been able to get M4A through congress. Biden may get a public option through, and Bernie probably would have pushed harder and gotten a *better* public option, but there's really no path for full M4A in the short term
joe biden’s running mate is meg the stallion: confirmed
what voters? She was only elected as a Senator in CA - with a 75% Dem population. Biden is choosing her to gain advantage with female and black voters. She is a pawn. She has less knowledge on how to run programs than ex-VP Dan Quayle.
That's why Biden chose her - to play up to those voters. It wasn't about how knowledgeable she is or capable of running a large business - the USA.
I just got a text from the Biden camp that confirms Harris as VP pick.
Joe Biden can’t put a sentence together. And in the past when he did he said something someone else said. Joe Biden is a old fool
Go vote for Biden LOL. He seems all there SMH
Y’all really be freaking out over Biden not revealing the VP pick yet when it’s usually not announced until like 2 days before the convention lol plz chill (also y’all must have not listened to That’s The Ticket with  and
I’m voting for Biden, but half the people on that list shouldn’t be.
AOC has no business being on this list.   She and Bernie are only there to try to bring the far left into the fold for Biden.
I’m voting Biden, but I can’t stand quite a few people on this list.
I’m voting for Biden, but I can’t stand at least half these speakers.
I’m voting for Biden, but I can’t stand at least half these speakers.
If Biden wins, then he will become ruler of the Westeros Wing.
I don't know what's worse.  The fact that someone tries to pull this off running for office or the fact that the "Never Trump" people are going to try to pull this off as just normal Biden.
We can't allow President Trump to be reelected to a second term in office.  Vote for Joe Biden for President instead.
Seriously, even if I hated Trump, (which I don’t) there is no other way around voting for him. A vote for Biden is a vote for lawlessness.  Look around and tell me differently!
One could wonder if Biden graduated 🎓 at all?
Normally doesn’t matter.  But Biden will step down and you are voting for VP.   Michelle accepts only with understanding she walks into presidency.
But it will get Joe Biden more Votes   Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America vote save America save social security &amp; Medicare  unemployment benefits , more testing  Vote up and down the ballot
Your embrace of a pollster with a clearly terrible track record that gives you numbers that make you feel good being critisized does not mean that I do the same thing. Quin does way better than Ras usually, but also it's not like I really think Biden was up 15
Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America vote up and down the ballot vote America and save lives
Vote blue for Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America vote up and down the ballot and save America &amp; Americans lives

Joe Biden looks pretty healthy  Donald Trump looks old &amp; very frail and unhealthy
Your waiting for your sign still? I have seen thousand of Trump Pence signs in yards! The only Biden sign that I have seen were defaced by UNION construction workers. “Your Base” is gone!
You think senile sell out China Biden is going to do anything good for our country.   Welcome to the United States of Chinexico!
Cover them in gorilla glue. Whoever steals it will have to walk around with a Biden sign stuck to their hand.
Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America
Joe Biden would destroy Donald Trump in adebate
And come Monday you will be ignoring Joe Biden  &amp; setting on Donald Trump's door step
It's a about time but for how long you guys need to spend more time covering Joe Biden
Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America
I am sorry for the American that voted for Ron DeSantis  Because he works to service  Donald Trump  not the American that voted for him  Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America &amp; save your family &amp; friends Neighbors lives
Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America
Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America
Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America
The world needs to let America pick its leader with no interference. It’s not the worlds leader it’s our leader and we can pick whomever we want. If we want Trump we’ll vote him in again. If Biden is who we want then we’ll vote him.
I agree with you, but can Biden *please* stop making these types of gaffes?  The Trump campaign just eats them up.
Does it mean Joe Biden?
Told someone I wonder how long it takes for someone to accuse me of racism. Listen, do me a favor and keep your thoughts on my character to yourself. You don’t know me one bit, Sam. If you think calling out Biden’s racism is racist, idk what to tell ya.
The trumpies real made in these comments. They immediately defended themselves and attacked you over a joke. They immediately jumped to assuming ur voting for Biden (which is none of their business) and got hostile 🙄
Trump is right when he says this election is rigged and his party is trying to rig it. Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden.
Who wrote that for Biden?
Thanks bro I’m just tired of being called racist like I literally was a liberal democrat (still pretty liberal) and a few weeks ago decided I’d rather have Trump than Biden. I wanted Bernie personally but he’s not in discussion anymore. I hate both parties now. I ❤️ populism tho
I respect your views, sir. You probably calling me a racist bigot behind ur screen for supporting trump &gt; Biden but I promise you I’m not. I care. I hope u can respect my views as well. Hv a good day man
Well ~90% released were black Americans who was out in there probably from Biden’s terrible crime bills.
I’m willing to bet u didn’t know Joe Biden owns an island within seeing distance of EPSTEINS ISLAND..
You too miss. I’m sorry if I come across badly being agaisnt Biden but 1 day i hope you’ll see I care about issues in the black community sincerely and genuinely. I am even mulling starting an organization with a few of my black friends to discuss civil rights issues.
👎 i listen and speak facts. Joe Biden has been terrible for black people since he got into politics
Biden is a 78 year old loser who has been in politics for 40 years and now says he’ll be savior and fix all issues he helped create/exploit. I’m tired of this crap.
GOP is definitely worse. I agree. I’m not even republican idk why people attacking me so hard for calling out Biden’s racist past - and present
Don, a humans thoughts and mind aren’t determined by their skin color. Recent poll has roughly 28% black Americans identified as conservative while less i think like 26% as liberal. Black people aren’t monolithic like Biden wants to think. They just don’t hv another viable option
Bro im getting hated on so hard for just telling them what Biden has said and done. But idc cuz I’m not here for them I’m here for people who are afraid to speak out agaisnt biden but know the harm he’s done.
Uh just cause Kamala is black doesn’t mean she’d get black vote. Again: black People think with brain not their skin color. Black People are NOT monolithic even tho biden thinks both of those things are true.
Who cares my skin color, I listen to black people my age group and so many know Biden sucks. It doesn’t take lots of research to look up his record.
Those are legit facts. What did I say was false? Trump gave black Americans long-term HBCU funding lowest unemployment, wage growth first time in over decade, criminal justice reform, opportunity zones to spur growth in community. And all Biden did was say I’m a democrat I love u
Yessir. And I enjoy learning more from many of their different perspectives. Don’t forget: black people think with their brain, not skin color. Sadly Biden thinks black People are monolithic and owe Biden their vote.
Biden was terrible in polls when he ran for president but Obama knew it was smart to pick him. Biden hurt black community in crime bills and now look who’s cleaning up Biden’s mess: trump: signing criminal justice reform.
I don’t watch Fox News nor do I care about them. I speak what Biden himself said and make own conclusion. Biden only helped Obama get the white racist voters afraid of black president. Obama knee he was smart in picking him. Look at his past record on race... disturbing
Did Biden write that for you? Holy nonsense word salad.
Donald Trump doesn't have a religious bone in his body  Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America &amp; save America
Joe Biden has hurt black Americans he whole career. From fighting against integration in schools to locking up fathers and youth. And now says they ain’t black if they don’t vote for him. He’s a joke
Just because you’re democrat, doesn’t mean you’re immune to being a racist.   Can we normalize that reality finally ?? Plenty of racist democrats out in America.   Biden says you “ain’t black” if u don’t vote for me and now “African American community isn’t diverse”   #RacistJoe
Assuming Biden wins and only serves 1 term, which is expected, then I believe that 2024 is primed to be an election about structural change.  This wasn’t that election.  This was the hold off fascism election. Sad.
Biden literally said if you don’t vote for me you’re not black. Reading comprehension lagging behind, eh  ??
Yes they all suck.  But Trump is a unique authoritarian threat.  The guardrails are breaking down.  So yes, unfortunately voting for Biden is just getting us back to the same old corruption we’re more comfortable with.  From there the fight continues.
if Joe Biden is a Catholic then why is he PRO CHOICE?!? SHAMEFUL!?! He should be excommunicated!!! Just like  !!!!!
I’m a swing voter from the great state of Ohio. Can’t wait to vote Biden.No, because ALL AMERICANS need to know what Obama and Biden did to spy on the Trump campaign and to try to end his Presidency illegally! The truth hurts, but the truth shall set you free!
Reporter: So can you explain what Obama did to bring peace between Israel and the AUE?  Biden: I know about roaches and you know he did, he did, um you know he did the thing...
Which means not for many months, unfortunately.  I think Biden will mandate masks nationally, but some people will ignore it or wear the mask pulled down under their nose.  Too many Americans aren't willing to experience a little discomfort.  #WearADamnMask
Jo (no “e”) and she can be if enough Americans want real change.  Change that’ll bring our troops home, get innocent people out of prison, balance the budget, and on and on.  Otherwise vote Biden or Trump it really doesn’t matter they’re both the same.
Which is why we’ll all be voting for Biden and while he’s cleaning up the mess left behind from Trump, you and him can enjoy endless litigation of your crimes for the rest of your miserable lives.
All these libs talking about protesting as though protests have ever done something. If you vote for Joe Biden, you're voting for whatever hideous monster comes next to make Trump look moderate.
Hillary would be the Biden administration.
#ByeHannity Joe Biden Democrats are dangerous for America.   Every American needs to see this.
#ByeHannity Joe Biden has a racism problem
Vote for Biden anyway. He's promised to undo the harm Trump has caused.
Me, too. I can’t put a Biden sign out because it will be stolen or shot. Ohio Magats abound.
Respectfully family! We aren't looking to get married to her, make her a queen or lord of the world! We're using her and Biden to get the orange garbage slime out of power!! If we are concerned about records! Let's improve ours by demanding from politicians what we need!!
A major union representing U.S. postal workers endorsed Biden for president after Trump has acknowledged starving the postal service of money in order to make it more difficult to vote by mail in November's election
. drones on about her superlatives and firsts in a way that reminds me of high school. Is it going to be about Joe Biden vs. Trump or is it going to be the Kamala wants to be President campaign?  #whitesuburbanwomen
Joe Biden is fashionably liberal
Biden is a total top.
vote against Trump. for Biden
All of your arguments against Biden are based off of could be and maybes, my arguments for him are based on what IS. Trump IS more dangerous than Biden, no other president has been so dismissive of our rights and protections as citizens. We need to push if Biden wins of course
I don’t imagine  amyklobuchar speaking anything in terms of Biden and herself. I’m already tired of Harris’s self indulgences. Talk about TRUMP. TALK ABOUT JOE  gah. #The19th has 20 tweets this hour,
One more thing Biden will have to fix.
By the way do you think Harris was picked because she would make a good VP ? Pelosi has this all planned , because when Biden steps down because he’s an idiot , she takes over not Harris
Politico columnist:  This sudden media crush on Kamala Harris sure is something, huh?  The media's "glaring effort to rehabilitate a failed politician."  *I will not Vote For  Biden *I will not rely on USPS
Living in a swing state, I need to make sure that my vote for the Biden/Harris ticket, Desiree Tims, and other down-ballot dems will actually count this year. 1 vote can make all the difference
Ok so long as you vote. I get why people aren’t happy. IM not happy, but Trump is dangerous, Biden is inconvenient. Not voting Biden is self indulgently stupid We gotta be good lil party boys and girls until Biden is in. Then we can give him and Kamala heartburn for four years.
If you’re calling for an armed revolution you are just as delusional as a red hat, that’d fail immediately. The fact is, and it’s proven, we can MOVE Biden, we can’t move Trump. Go for the chance greater than 0 and vote down the ballot for the progressives there. Be smart
I'm glad that Biden has your support, then.
Look, you can either vote for Biden or be stuck with Trump. Sadly, 3rd party votes aren’t going to get us out of this mess.
WATCH: President Trump speaks at the White House before leaving for New York.
No progressive is happy about the Democratic ticket, and it fucking hurts that we were all so excited for Bernie to sweep the primary. It didn’t happen, but we have gotten further than we ever have before. Don’t give up the momentum we’ve gained just to spite Biden!
Biden is a liar.
Great thread. Kamala understood the importance of #Medicare4All then. We need it now more than ever. Biden and Harris must push left and embrace #M4A in order to save the American people from the COVID-19 crisis.
Learn to prioritize. Right now our chief priority should be removing Trump, hindering that goal is destructive to all our other priorities. Once Trump is out we can focus more securely on giving Biden and Harris heartburn for not being progressives. Priorities people.
I wrote a whole Facebook thing last year but don’t want to share it on Facebook cuz I saw mean things about Biden—basically it was this: “Biden isn’t gonna energize anything. KAMALA WILL! She needs tobe our pick!” I was right. What I wasn’t expecting was her making HIM exciting!
NO thanks I will be voting for Biden
Vote Biden.  We’ve seen the mess Trump has made.  No confidence he’ll do anything different if re-elected.
But Biden isn’t bland fish. He’s half a plate of shit whereas Trump is a full plate of shit. With Biden you’re gonna eat less shit, but it’s still shit all the same.
With little time until election, emphasis must be on electing Biden-Harris.  Most effective use of time and effort.
#KamalaHarris just doing what she did in SF...#BidenHarris Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Trump and Biden trade barbs over coronavirus response, masks
Biden better clap back
Just a reminder that Joe Biden has a long track record of supporting segregation. Like 46 years long. Here’s How Deep Biden’s Busing Problem Runs  via
Calling Joe Biden and Kamala Harris pieces of shit with bits of broken glass in it is a tad generous I think.
We know China is rooting for Biden.  Hunter is gonna make a killin if daddy wins.
Mornin boys. Saw this, thought it was relevant to this thread!  ‘Hillary Clinton says she's ready to serve in Biden administration’
So Biden wants masks for the next three months. What is happening in three months? The election!  Stop making the Corona virus political.
I'm voting #kamala Biden 💣😂❤️❤️💦😎😎
They are out of cards and ironically Biden/Harris have trumped Trump lol
Biden wants us to wear masks for the next three months? No 💯
It's not about Biden or Trump, it's about America
So much misinformation in this I wouldn’t know where to start; Kamala and Biden in fact, *HAVE* done everything she listed. Anyone who is reading this just look up the Keystone Pipeline, or the history of the ICE detention camps under Obama and Kamala’s support of ICE.
That 4.7% was all that was left after all the others had run through their unemployment. The total number of people out of work because the the Obama/Biden administration was the part at a 30 year high. You need to dig deeper.
a spring. His campaign had been spied on and the biggest frame job ever perpetrated against them.  And then Obama's lieutenant Joe Biden went and picked you, an outright Socialist/Comunist. The UNITED STATES does not need you or sleepy Joe. And that is why you loose November. Bye
Luckily, Kamals will be the Vice President. I've every confidence that she will serve as an admirable right hand to Biden. She really is the complete package! I've not hear her make promises to blacks, but, she speaks about specific needs and filling those needs across groups👌
Joe Biden needs to have his own briefings with higher level experts as often as necessary. Show leadership and real scientific example.
If America has had “systemic racism” from the beginning, how come you Obama and Biden did nothing about it during your 8 years? You Obama stoked the fires of racial hatred and racism during your 8 years! Your unhelpful comments on Trayvon Martin &amp; Mike Brown before all .../2...
This USPS issue is important enough for Biden and Kamala Harris to take on and apply pressure from their point of view.
You won’t get it from Biden or Trump but you will get it from Jo Jorgensen.  #JoJorgensen2020
She thinks he is a racist and believes #TaraReade. Strong candidate against?  She knows #Biden will fall down some stairs soon after the nomination and she gets the reigns...the country will be in trouble...#MAGA2020
To be fair, Joe Biden could shoot ME and I would still vote for him over Trump.
Rumor in GOP circles: Harris cannot succeed Biden if he would not complete his term since her Mother is from India and her Father is Jamaican. Sorry R's. To be President a person has to be a "natural born citizen" of the U.S." Harris was born in Oakland, CA.#OaklandisinAmerica
Biden has a dog. Trump doesn't  Case closed!!!#RescueAmerica
Pence said if the Biden - Harris team gets elected, she will do away with MEAT! YEP, MEAT.🤡
Tell it to Biden.
But Joe Biden isn't Catholic. I'd say Joe is a better representation of being Catholic than the church hierarchy that swept the suffering if little children under the rug to protect the rich privileged Catholic Church and their illusion of saintly pedophiles.
Under no circumstances should Joe Biden concede to trump.
Get over it, ok?  I trust Kamala and Joe Biden!
Fortunately here in Ohio the union I’m a member of seems to be tired of Democrat BS. The SS comments were made by Biden and Pelosi because Trump did the payroll tax reduction, they forgot Obama did the same thing and the felt different then.
Absolutely unbelievable!!! ⁦ should be ashamed. A 3 yr old autistic baby removed from plane for not wearing a mask. Must have had Biden/Harris working as the flight attendants ⁦ should address this
MAGAts don't read that much.  Maybe the Independents could be swayed, 60/40.  We readers are already voting for Biden/Harris.
And if Biden can remember his name
It's funny ur doing it now right before the elections that ur losing lmaoooooo to Joe Biden  but the pandemic has been since Jan and now ur lying about forcing them
You have the never to say Biden's been wrong, BIDEN IS NOT PRESIDENT, trump is and there's 4 million plus infected and 168,000 souls dead. Who's been wrong again?
True, Biden has no clue of the world around him
Biden and Pelosi believe that practicing Catholics (those few who actually follow the Catechism) are unfit to serve in our nation's courts.
Voting for Jo Jorgensen is worse than voting for Biden or Trump.
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : FOX NEWS POLL: Joe Biden is up 49-42 percent over President Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup
That part I definitely understand, and for that reason specifically I’ll never knock on anyone voting for Biden. We just need to consider that a racist abuser with a very evil prosecutor might not be great for driving racial justice forward
For sure I definitely get why people will continue to vote for Biden but he was the candidate that the left wanted the absolute least. At the end of the day I don’t think he’s any better or more fit than trump, and that’s why I think it’s important to begin change this year
Biden doesn’t support M4A, he doesn’t support free/accessible education, and he doesn’t have any policies that will enact eco friendly practices. His only finite plan is to increase police authority. I’d rather start change then elect discount trump in a blue tie
I definitely agree and it’s a weird subject because it’s important to get trump out, but in my view the final result of Biden+Harris shows that neither party will fix things. Biden won’t fix any problems that we face today so I think it’s important to begin the process of change
Well...if they let Biden become President first, it will be the Speaker.  How funny if the Republicans win back the House.
The spoiler effect, Biden would be one of the most progressive presidents in US history, and maybe say something about Bernie and AOC's endorsement?
My grandmother (WI) Trump My father (OH) Trump My mother (OH) Trump My sister (OH) Trump My brother (OH) Biden Myself (OH) Biden
Definitely gotta get 5%. Biden/Harris not only ensures a Tom Cotton presidency, it further sends us into a spiral of right authoritarian hell
If you're a so-called leftist and you plan to vote Biden/Harris, you are my enemy and the enemy of all progressives.
I mean, Biden wants to fucking go to war with Palestine.
Call me cynical, but I don’t believe this will remain a mere suggestion to governors if Biden wins.
What in the fuck would these shitstains do better? Are you forgetting that Biden lied and told his supporters that it was safe to go vote so that he could win, causing a spike in coronavirus cases? Are we forgetting that he held the health of millions of people hostage?
So if we dont listen to biden and not mandate mask wearing for the next 3 months and more than 40,000 loves are lost what do u think he will say then the mandate would've save those 40,000 lives and blame trump for not mandating it
Spotted a Biden porch flag and a shirt at the grocery in less than 24 hours. These people actually exist which is weird to me.
Hope for Biden.
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
Joe Biden   " It is not about your rights"
Federalism is on life support now.  It will be dead within one year if Biden wins with both Houses of Congress.
One question I have is does the QAnon conspiracy get louder/stronger under a Biden presidency?  If Trump does in fact lose, they will think that the "elites" rigged it against him.
Bow down to the greatest president of all time. A BIDEN MEME?!?!??!! THIS MAN 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So your for Biden who wants to raise taxes on the working class which make up 90% of the population by 4 trillion, make the working class pay for low income housing in the suburbs like my local area (Huber Heights), who wants to have the health care paid for by the stock market.
If Biden/Harris wins, are you sure that she will not be making all of the decisions from day one?
Ask Biden what he did...oops that would require journalism
People were clear during the primary that Biden was unacceptable. If beating Trump is so important, then perhaps Democrats shouldn't have nominated him.
You mean Trump will make sure Biden and headboard Harris can’t CHEAT
Whoever it is you know they will be there for most of the Biden/Harris term.
The fact that there will be no change means that Joe Biden is just as bad as Trump. Just because they're going in two different wrong directions doesn't mean one wrong direction is good. Less bad is bad. Why would you want bad? Less evil is evil. Let's just focus on the evil.
Hell yes -- #LetBetoSpeak #LetBetoSpeakDNC Biden just tosses him after Super Tuesday endorsement, and the Whataburger photo-op?  Hell no.   If you want a lot of Texas Dems to do more than just pull the lever for Joe in November, this needs to get fixed.  Now.
Biden can’t survive any debates! You liberal cowards are scared to death of debates! Hahaha 🤪🤣😂

How much money are you donating to Biden/Harris ticket? You made a promise to use your money to keep drumpf from winning. Keep your word.
If what you say is true Manu.......then investigating Biden's campaign and its support from China is fair game
Holy cow! You have lost your marbals and need help! #UnfitForOffice You're making Biden look good. Morning Joe has a 100% approval rating amongst it's viewers. That's better than your 98% approval rating amongst Republicans. #TrumpIsNotWell #AmericaOrTrump
Don't get swept up in that this is the last election everything's on the line right now garbage. The reason why Biden was 'selected' is so that nothing will change.
Fuck no! That would mean she would have to turn on Biden!
She meant to say he inherited the slowest economic recovery in US history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden (who litteraly did nothing for the economy), then made it into the greatest economy in the world within 2 years.
And if you're a Biden voter, you don't have to worry either, as a special service will be held for him that will take place in March or October, he hasn't quite figured it out yet... Little kids are appreciated in lieu of anything else... Fuckin pedos
Let's be real, none of us on the left are thrilled to be voting for Biden. Our candidate was rallied against and shut out by a tone deaf DNC. But this is who we're stuck with. If you really aren't voting for him cause he's "just as bad," you're a product of your own privilege.
When Biden/Harris take over the secret police
A (D) poll has Biden up by 6, a (R) poll has Biden up by 12. Makes sense
well biden has been accused of both so 🤷🏻‍♀️
Why does Biden look so robotic when he walks? Why didn’t he greet Kamala properly when she came to the Podium. Weird.
Biden and Trump both brother
when Brett Kavanaugh was accused of raping a woman, liberals heavily pushed the idea that we should always believe women who come forward. but when Joe Biden was accused of reaching up a woman's skirt and penetrating, she must have been lying.
Harris’s selection in and of itself is unlikely to change many votes, but her presence on the ticket is likely to influence voters’ opinions of Biden and whether they’re likely to vote for him, writes  &amp;   #veepstakes
Certainly is our future if Biden/Harris are elected.
I bet the Biden administration wont kill
bro he been lighting biden ass up he 2 tweets away from dropping a diss track
Keep telling yourself that. This economy booming was all Trump. Nothing OBAMA/Biden related at all. The crash....i think you know why it crashed, nothing to do with Trump. It’s on the rebound already
So you want Biden
he "inherited the longest economic exansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden," and "Like everything else he's inherited, he ran it straight into the ground." Snap!
A few things:  1. AOC is not a comrade. The fact that she won't back Shahid Buttar says all that needs to be said.  2. Anyone that votes Biden/Harris is a class traitor.  3. People that accuse other people of being a Russian bot are diddlers, it's totally true, pass it on.
Yes I think you missed the point. I don’t  vote for a person because they are a Christian. I vote based on the polices they push toward Christians. Biden and Trump are obviously flawed like all humans BUT Trump POLICIES have been good for Christians WHILE BIDEN and dems attack us
One thing is for sure. Joe Biden doesn't have the cleanest history when it comes to race relations. Look up what he had to say about integration and then combine that with who he  idolized as a Senator, Robert Byrd from WV. This can't be misinterpreted,but will be ignored
So she is planning on assasinating Joe Biden.
God will protect Joe Biden
🤣🤣🤣hilarious coming from you, who picked a VP that rightfully obliterated you on national TV for your racism. At least you’re providing us with great entertainment Biden!
And Biden isn’t, and most of Washington, Hollywood... ?
Says Biden who supported racist policies, &amp; picked a VP who rightfully obliterated him on national TV for his racism.
Like Biden will do better
I forgot that Biden and Harris can start getting briefings now. That may change the game.
How about "Doc" Jill Biden?
Steve, this has been such fun for me. I'll let you get to finding those receipts abut Biden in the basement. Look forward to reading it. But I must wash my dishes. Goodnight!
LOL. Why do you want me to call you a racist? You didn't say anything racist (although you support one, which is quiet problematic). I'm waiting for that proof of Biden in a basement, tho.
Also saying she believes the women felt uncomfortable doesn't mean she believes he did anything inappropriate or at the very least intentionally harmful. None of those women said they felt assaulted by Biden too. So yeah, we can see hot this plays out, with FACTS.
2020 sucks, but making us cap it off with deciding between Joe Biden and Donald Trump just doesn’t seem fair man.
Technically, the first State of the Union speech by President Biden wouldn't be until Jan or Feb 2022. The first address of a newly inaugurated POTUS is just an address to a joint session of Congress, not an official SOTU. A lot can happen in a year and a half 😁😁
Yes !! Made me feel so much better the future.  Biden and Kamala as a pair seems balanced and competent and safe
❓So what does #Biden have to do with that? He doesn't support 'defunding of the #police', or violence of this sort. You should blame the #NRA if anyone. They are the reason people are carrying around #ar15 assault rifles.
President ⁦ slammed by Former Vice President and his new running mate, U.S. Sen. ⁦   (Via DaytonDaily)
Y’all talking all this shuff about #KamalaHarris but y’all act like that’s gonna stop y’all from voting for #Biden and her to win! I hope you know because of y’all mindset the elites is doing what you already accepted.
Yet another reason to vote   out of office in 2022,  I'm happy to fall in line and vote for Biden/Harris!  Anybody buy a complicit Republican.
As she hits a blunt, pushes Biden down the stairs and becomes prez....for sure...I actually like her..she believes Tara.  She put a bunch of thugs in prison and slept her way into a prominent role...perfect politician.
Second stimulus check: Where Biden, Harris stand on COVID payment proposals
Why are democrats on the top of my feed?  Biden, Schumer, Joe Walsh and Pelosi.   I do not follow them.  Disgusting.
Joe Biden didn't take it personally when, Kamala Harris attacked him during the presidential debates. He knew that that's how politics are. That's something you will never understand  . You can dish it out but you can't take it. #BabyTrump
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
No!  She can't win.  Any vote that isn't for Biden is a vote for Trump.  Do you want four more years of Trump? Hillary wouldn't even want you to do that. If you could ask her, she would say no. She would want you to vote out that piece of shit that stole the election from her.
I thought Joe Biden running for president dummy
You need to check your self into a mental hospital asap ,Biden was right "you ain't black and neither are the others in black skin voting ,supporting,excusing ,defending trump who works of satan as you do ! Satan is a liar! you ,trump and all aligned with trump are
Yeah, I don't generally hear people saying that either, but also I don't hear people reminding about the problems of the PATRIOT Act and the existence of DHS in the first place. And I see lots of unironic retweeting Biden and "vote blue" that seem ... uncritical.
At least two counter-protestors in the Biden crowd.
Pretty sure the lesser of 2 evils crowd knows Biden’s record sucks. But the point is A: Trump is worse and B: Biden can be pushed in a way Trump cannot.   At this point there are 2 options, and 1 is clearly worse.
The thing is she isn’t black she is Jamaican and Indian.   He didn’t even pick a black woman which is a another lie by Biden
It's not that high. 5% difference in the popular vote would be a large Biden EC win. Trump's 2% deficit last time in 2016 is probably close to the limit given how close the swing states were.
hey just a reminder that most trump supporters refuse to call out any of the chaos he’s caused over the past 4 years so it’s not their place to put you down for supporting and simultaneously criticizing biden/harris’ records either!
Biden / Harris 2020! Build Back Better! One Prison At A Time!
Biden's not in office yet, silly!
Honestly, I agree. Yeah Biden sucks but I'd rather vote for him than have Trump in office again. People are acting like there's another choice but unfortunately there's not and we need to face that reality. That doesn't mean we can't fight for change at the same time tho ✨
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
I stick to print news and transcripts just for this reason. I mean I'm gonna #votegold and vote for  anyway, but I'm trying not to attack Biden/Harris. We need to stop nominating old men who can't speak.
Remember back during the primaries when Biden supporters said that since we're not democrats, we shouldn't be allowed to have a say on who is the candidate? Isn't it interesting that we're all now democrats and expected to vote for Biden?
Trump dead ass has plants in this press corps. Some chick just asked a question saying antifa/.com takes you to Biden's site and asked if Biden/Harris should denounce Antifa as a terrorist organization (it's not). Now he's on a tangent about Portland. Totally staged.
Biden will constantly need to be reminded of who his VP is &amp; what he’s running for. Plus, I hope Kamala speak the truths she spoke on the debate stage about Biden being a racist. Will be interesting.
I’m so excited about Biden/Harris2020. I’m in Ohio(important state) My voice has NEVER BEEN HEARD! My story is UNBELIEVABLE! You 2 or u zoom me or visit me, and fight for ME! I BELIEVE in you both. Please don’t let me down!!
Funny how President Biden finished every sentence while Trump read from notes for half an hour, the same notes he read yesterday without raising his head. He is a energy on sleeping pills.
Biden/Harris2020 are going to Unite this Country!! We need to quit this racism BS! We are all one race, the Human Race❤️❤️
Can we get a split screen of Biden watching this... this... anxiety inducing auditory assault?
OMG.., reminds me of Obama &amp; Biden 😥🙌😃😃💞💞
What did Joe Biden do in 2008 to save us from the brink of collapse?
I'm seeing a lot of anti-Biden, anti-Harris rhetoric from my left-leaning friends on social media. Can't we like... Save it? Until after we get Trump out of office?   The Republicans don't even expect their candidates to be decent... Why must we expect ours to be perfect?
Okay, watching that press conference almost turned me into the K-Hive lmao  We need the Biden/Harris ticket to win in November y'all
I've talked to lawn furniture that's smarter than Joe Biden lol. Picking you as a running mate closes the case lol.
can you stop showing the press conference from biden and kamala? Its on a damn loop and its annoying
Biden-Harris   We need more than a victory; we need a mandate!
Joe Biden, a man of empathy???!! Isn’t he a rapist? Wasn’t he pro segregation??!! Didn’t he say that the African American community lacks diversity?? And he chose a cop to be his VP??!! Empathy is not in that man’s vocabulary. Go to hell
Only two people in the US died from Ebola. President Obama and Vice President Biden did their job.
This is such a good speech. Hitting on every point possible. Also, she's gonna make Biden sob.
Biden introducing Kamala Harris as his vice president... Bet she'll be introduced as the 47th president too. 😎
Reelect Trump and Pence administration!!!! Why start completely over on a random unknown program with Biden when we are established with trump? Not worth the "shot in the dark"
“OMG #Biden picked someone he disagreed with in the primaries!”  Good.   I don’t want a VP that’s just gonna follow him around like a conditioned puppy dog.
Biden had a lot of slip ups in the Primary debates but he's really pulled it together and is giving a hell of a speech here. Gotta give him credit.
Maybe cancel him for stealing donations that he claimed were for the mothers of those killed by police. Maybe cancel him for totally reversing his opinion on Biden/Harris for a check. Maybe cancel him for being a white man pretending to be black.
Watch Live: The Biden/Harris ticket to debut first remarks as running mates.
If I hate white supremacy, why would I vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, two people that have done more to harm black folk in this country than possibly anyone alive.
People with any sense of morality don't vote for scum like Biden and Harris.
Wait so you think joe biden is a better option? you’re lyin
For those curious about the spiritual background of Kamala Harris, here is an article that shares a bit. What I find delightful is the broad exposure she has had to many different traditions while also embodying and claiming for herself w/in a tradition
How much are you in love with Biden?
When McKinley was assassinated Teddy became President, the same thing could happen if Biden becomes incapacitated for mental health issues. The only difference is McKinley and Teddy were republicans.
If I don't vote for Trump I'm helping Biden win. Your argument is stupid. I don't care if he wins or not, I'm not some privileged liberal shitstain that wants to beat Trump so I can go back to living in ignorance.
I'm going to help Howie Hawkins win 5%, I don't give a fuck what you do. However, l'll put it this way, with as disgusting as you people are acting, a vote for a third party is a vote for Biden since we're not voting for Trump to spite you.
It won't, but neither will Biden, that's why I'm not supporting either one. I'm voting for Howie Hawkins to hit 5% of the vote so that we can get federal funding and recognition. The green party is far from perfect, but infinitely better than the DNC.
Thank you and I’m not convinced that Joe Biden is any better just because his name isn’t Donald Trump. Like I said I’d rather focus on where the real issues lie which is congress. They don’t have to leave &amp; we just let em sit which means the government is hardly changing truly.
You should be asking yourself that question. We're not willing to budge or work with you because We. Don't. Need. You. We don't need Biden in office because it doesn't help us. We have nothing to lose. You need our vote to win, so now you need to start courting us.
She had my support... and still does!  Along with Biden!  You’re going home dude.. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
I don't care about beating Trump, I care about saving lives and ensuring freedoms. I care about platform and issues. What's happening in this country isn't a trump problem, it's an America problem, and voting Biden will only make it worse in the long run.
Like I said, Biden could’ve chosen Keith Sweat as his VP and I’d still be voting for Biden over Trump!
The stuff you're talking about is going on now. Do you know who the  president is  now, it's not Joe Biden
They'll try. There is just literally no chance that Biden voters and left leaning moderates will possibly care. The GOP is also going to paint Kamala as anti black for locking up so many people while portraying Trump and a true friend of blacks for letting them out of prison lol
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
This is where I'm at. I live in Ohio a swing state. I'm sick and tired. I have said on numerous occasions I will not vote for Biden, but honestly I'm scared. Am I making a huge mistake? Uuuggghhhhhh
After analyzing the political history of Joe Biden I believe him to be no better &amp; maybe a little worse than Trump. I would instead look at the Congress members &amp; vote there as that’s where real change needs to happen. A president won’t do much. Congress is where the issues lie
'One of our own.' Indians cheer Biden's pick of Kamala Harris as White House running mate  via
Meh, anyone who actually votes for Kanye probably wasn't gonna vote for Biden anyways
#Squad ...Hey Biden Dems when you take a shot you better not miss.
Sen. Mommie Dearest? Biden would never do that to his staff.
Biden harris is nowhere near the life or death situation that trump/barr are.
Maybe you should have listened during the primary instead of rallying around Biden in order to prevent people from getting health care.
So going to college to get a degree for a high paying job is a bad decision too? Wow she’s going to bring the Biden campaign down to its knees.
I don't think Biden is president right now when all these things are happening I do believe it's president Trump
But Biden and Kamala has been complicit in legislations that directly caused pain &amp; suffering to so many black families! Why is that part being ignored?? Why is that part being swept under the rug
Nice try Bill.  Busy trying to hide Biden’s dementia much?
Biden openly admits he will not be leading the country if he wins the election. #NeverBiden #MAGA #KAG
Why do you state “she’s ready to lead on day one,” yet not state you are ready? Who would be running the country under a Biden administration?
Don’t forget that Biden will not save America, he will destroy it.
Joe Biden said "Come on guys. It’s me.” his entire campaign and y’all bought it.
Than why are you down 23% to Biden in that category?
And the dramatic part being what...could it be that Biden isn't supporting are brothers in the FOP. Or that he isn't condemning the riots that have hurt brother firefighters. Or what good is collective bargaining when a city is broke🤔
"People are dying. The earth is dying."  Sounds like an argument to support Hawkins over Biden.
That is a straight lie. Biden and his running mate are poised to divide this country even further and run it into the ground purposefully. Really who choses an ex-cop for a VP during THIS TIME. They are playing with our morals. 😒😒😒
Can’t tell if my favorite authors are woefully ignorant about Biden’s record, or they’re being willfully obtuse. #TeamDemocrat #RahRahRah
Is it just me or is Biden a better representation of the Catholic faith than the church hierarchy that sweeps the abuse of children under the rug, then hypocritically call out others?
The Biden-Sanders platform won’t even legalize marijuana, and the only concession Biden made on Medicare was to lower the age from 65 to *60*. Stop pretending it’s a progressive campaign.
And every Biden supporter I’ve talked to on here says his victory is in the bag because he’s high in the polls now ...see a pattern here?
There’s nothing more to say. Besides, it was Biden people who spent the last primary season invalidating Jewishness as if there wasn’t a genocide less than a century ago. If that’s the precedent you guys set don’t be surprised when other people gatekeep as well.
Could've picked a  brick and I'd still gladly vote Biden
There is no change with Biden lol. 😂😂😂 he’s Neoliberal like all the rest, he won’t even budge on legalizing marijuana.
Yikes dude. Why can’t we have any good options??? Morally, voting for either Trump or Biden just does not sit well with me. I can’t stand this.
Kanye is on the ballot in a few states including Colorado and Ohio. Also, I don’t care whether or not Biden loses because it’s inconsequential, returning to the conditions before Trump will probably lead us to another Trump.
Good enough that Democrats cry we make them lose elections, hell, Biden supporters are afraid *Kanye* is gonna make them lose. 😂
Voting is a choice, plain and simple, and there are always more than two options. Convincing people to vote for you is the entire point of campaigning, and Biden can't win unless he convinces more people. But if you'd rather condescend rather than convince, I wish you luck.
You probably don’t have much place accusing people of wanting white saviors when you’re voting for whitebread Joe Biden lol. It’s also a lie to say she shifted her policy, she laughed at the prospect of opening more schools instead of more prisons.
I'm truly glad that it's an easy decision for you, but I hope there are some in the Biden camp who feel that it's important to convince people, because that's the entire point of campaigning. Those at the center and far left need to be convinced. Biden can't with without them.
The fact that you think Joe Biden wouldnt choose conservative SC justices shows that you know nothing about Joe Biden. Lol
Joe Biden is a much better representation of his faith than a member of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that have swept the abuse of children under the rug, dont ya think Bishop?
The plan is to get Biden elected then remove him for his incompetence and let Kamala become president.
Who has made the claim that this selection was based on skin color and gender?  This article is about Biden's process and what he communicated in that process, as well as Kamala Harris' accomplishments and how they complement Biden's approach.
Seems like an idea from someone who knows Joe Biden is incapable of speaking in public without making another racist gaff on national television. We want to hear from the potential leaders of the country, not the second in line that “do nothing” as Joe claims.
Progressives! Biden/Harris isn't a defeat. The VP slot was never going to be a progressive. Now we know who we are working with. Now begins the work. Step 1: Defeat Trump. This is the baseline. Step 2: Contine to fight for progressive values. It's that simple.
Yeah! Biden/Harris 2020!

So, if Biden/ Harris wins, she can be the President of Vice.
If Trump does lose badly (knock on wood), I think they'll change, but a narrow Biden win or even a Trump win, it'll only get worse imo
I agree Trump is the easy choice Biden has been in office for over 40 years and Trump has done more and bigger better things in 4 years then hidden Biden has done his whole career

Even if there were no clip; like Joe Biden wasn't there?
You want Biden to win, but are you going to go vote ? Just checkin because people want things but don’t go get it or take action on it.
You've failed to explain how. He did what Biden would do.
The odds were that this was gonna play out like this, but you SCREAMED the other way and riled up a real lot of people. People that are refusing to vote for Biden/Harris and writing someone in or sitting it out. Just don’t anymore.
Where is it? In what was is Biden better than Trump?
Hopefully the Biden/Harris administration will honor him by finally fighting climate change.

Political purity does not exist. No. But politicians exist to represent the people. Not corporations, not donors, not political party - the people. The Biden-Harris ticket is the best ticket of the two, but we have to keep the pressure. Winning is just the beginning.

As I said. I didn’t forget. He’s not on that list.  I confused and need an answer.  Why in the holy hell vote for Biden.  We wants to enormously raise our taxes.  Give amnesty to illegal immigrants who cares if they jumped in front of immigrants trying to get in the country legit
No, Biden is not a white supremacist, but trump is and so are his supporters. Trump is also a criminal. Guess you're ok with that...

I think in this very difficult case ahead of us, voting vs not voting 1stly involves: the pro voter argues Trump is absolute hell 4 us, voting him out is necessary good; the anti-voter says my vote gives Biden a mandate to export our hell like Bush etc did, but to Russian sphere

You realize there are two options on the ballot, right? not voting won't collapse the system.  If you don't vote for Biden, Trump will win. You can pick the candidate who might be willing to listen, or you can jack off to your tweets about this shit.   I'm going w harm reduction.

I liked Joe Biden when he didn’t talk so much as VP. 😂
In a primary you have to get MORE votes than your opponent.  That is how it works!! Hence Joe Biden is the opponent of Douchebag Donny/satan. That is your choice, if you are satisfied with the Douchebag  so be it. Not or voting for some else ALSO means you are satisfiied .
Meh...people have said worse, posted horrific pics, and don't give a rats ass about pedophiles...and now are flippin over this!?!? 🙄
C'mon Candace you got better information than that, how true is it that she lock up 1500 black men but no conviction, unlike Biden. Tell the truth, that's all I'm asking.
Biden/Harris, cause I don't like morally bankrupt sociopaths cosplaying as a head of state.  Also, the last three years have been flat brutal.
I think Biden and Harris will win like Obama and Biden did: Americans live in a world of surface effects; race is a superficial idea; it prevents reasoning about causes; it thus breeds grave consequences; a friendly black/white image is the good face; it hides deep daggers
And you want Joe Biden to be elected so he can defund the police so this doesn’t happen??? And his VP takes all our guns away?
"You can't hold Democrats accountable if they know you'll vote for them no matter what."  Excuse me but did you even see Biden's 180° on Hyde?   Watch abortion orgs for a while. You might learn something.
Its either Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris.. all that other sh*t is irrelevant distractions........ oh and I almost forgot F*CK kanye!
Among the 368 people who ran for President in the Democratic Primary, Kamala Harris was my first choice. So I am very happy with the choice for Veep from Biden.
sank his own battleship? Bro, Biden could have picked a ham sandwich and we'd still vote for him. TRUMP HAS GOT TO GO!
I know you're not implying that Biden has dementia, when trump is unable to 1. stop lying and 2. speak in a coherent manner.
joe fuckin biden , he ran wit obama . putting ye in office is putting trump back in office
Politics &amp; Religion is not a debate we should ever have on twitter. Y’all think because we black we should all agree &amp; that’s the dumbest sh*t in the world to me but I ain’t gone hold y’all f*ck Trump &amp; Biden but ima still vote
Good Morning Old Complaining Ass Coffee what the hell is wrong with black people why are we mad that Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris? Here is a list of Negro complains I have heard in 24 hours, she’s not black enough,…
Something about “settle for” Infront of Biden makes me chuckle
Meanwhile this fool running AAPI for Joe Biden literally had Narendra Modi over for chai and sweets in their BJP-RSS home.
I don’t want neither in office but I’m forsure voting for Biden stankin self
Yeah if  You’re voting  For Biden/Harris  Move around With all That BLM Shit.
I don't care if Biden picked a can of beans as his running mate, WE VOTIN FOR JOE!
Y’all bouta vote for Biden ima dm y’all bm then
People dumb af you can not like Biden n still vote trump out
All you "I'm not voting for Biden because Kamala's a cop" people better not be registering your cars or putting money in your parking meters.   Where do you think that money goes? You know what they do with it?  You can engage in harm reduction and fight back simultaneously.
Great piece on why Kamala Harris is the right pick for VP
No she won’t. Bernard, you and Biden are both out of your minds
I’m Team Warren myself, but you won’t see me do anything but vote for Biden/Harris without hesitation.
No, I think you were right on target, when Wall Street loves your democratic VP candidate ...
People who won’t vote because they think Biden is sh*t annoy me so much, like Biden might not be great, but he is miles better than Trump.
It’s not just gonna be Biden, he will have progressives in his cabinet and will sign progressive laws .
LOL. One thing I don't want to see is Biden dancing. White guys cannot dance.
I get it. Voted for Bernie this time and in ‘16. I’m disappointed, but I MUST vote against Trump. I’m worried about the environment and while I don’t think Biden is great on it, I think he’ll listen more than Trump will. Health care and police reform will also fare better
I don't think Biden will win. I think people will vote angry about the riots (since no one can bully them in the voting place) and they hate the virus, the WHO, the doctors and the lockdown. It's 2016 all over again.
I'm not acknowledging Biden from now on btw. Only Harris.
Biden did succeed in destroying all chances of shifting the conditions of a ruling coalition toward leftist interests. The billionaires and trillionaires are not going to feel any bit of our pain and dread for a very long time. No. We will be cutting things off we love. Not them
Yep yep yep. Enthusiastically. Voting Biden/Harris.
I still plan to vote for Biden/Harris.
I to don't trust her politics, as a VP and president if Biden falls to sleep while on duty. We are going to be in trouble, just beware of her politics america this woman has to many emotional battles with herself,
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 Bumper sticker: BIDEN in '20-HARRIS in '21
I swear people will complain about everything.. no matter who Joe Biden would've picked, people would have complained, If God came down and ran with Joe Biden..people would've found a reason to complain smh... i have zero issues w/ K.Harris. ..they have my vote right now.
See, I'll try to bring some actual facts to it.  The platform committee, of the Biden and Sanders campaigns, came up with the most progressive platform in American history.  Setting a clear path to M4A, moving the country forward in multiple ways.
Congratulations Senator Kamala Harris for joining Joe Biden as his VP :D &lt;3
Like she wanted to be VP to Biden???? That people are still so desperate to dunk on her like this is so pathetic honestly
Trump and Pence a lot of racist shit gone keep happening  Biden and Harris a lot of niggas going to prison
I just saw my very first Joe Biden ad😂😂I love how it's him surrounded  misinformed black folks especially after all he's said.
This shit childish af “But not Joe Biden, he’s not that smart”
Biden could have picked a malaria carrying mosquito.....and I still would vote for him to get the #TrumpCrimeFamily out of office. #BidenHarris2020  #BidenHarris2020
A Biden/Harris ticket being a puppet of ANTIFA is a pretty hard sell.    Hell, the Trumps even donated to her campaigns.   But good work on your pre-made videos.  Outside being useless and looking poor, they're great.
IMO I believe by Joe Biden picking Kamela Harris he will now lose the election to Donald Trump. I like Senator Harris but what is she going to bring to the table, Biden was going to win California and get most of the African American vote anyhow. Harris might be better than Biden
Aw hell naw. Biden Benson even do I don’t want to
You meant to say "Biden" &amp; made a typo, I'm sure.
Biden selects Kamalla Harris as VP running mate. Failure at its best.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden’s running mate By Amanda Erickson
I believe that this is good. #BidenHarris2020
I absolutely, positively, without reservation adore Kamala Harris and nothing Joe Biden has or will do can change that.   This was the right choice.
I honestly don't think Biden is that stupid and tone-deaf especially after saying it WOULD be a woman.
Bout to be salty asf when Biden picks a black woman vp and the world says he just picked her because she was black
Man if Biden pick Kamala as his VP, I’m moving💀
Biden should pick a damn can of soup as his running mate for all I care
Wrong again. I'm a black SJW and like I said, we're on twitter!  I don't have to cue up ANYTHING! Go look at trumps tweets and then decide if attacking Biden is worth it....
Your right on Biden is very racist. If you take a little time and check his time in Congress you would be appalled. He honestly does not like black Americans.  He likes Latinos but not blacks.  Check it out for yourself. Demoshits  no conscience.  No shame.   No honor they suck
Like causing direct harm to Ohio voters, Ohio candidates, and Biden himself by doing even more to depress the votes he thinks he can count on.   Where's Cardi B? Where's LeBron James? Where's anyone on that stage speaking to the Black community? Kanye is.
Biden is 78 yrs old. What u mean he don't know enough about himself?
Not true. Demings and Bass are also not listed as speakers. I think people are making too much of this. Biden is not signaling his pick through the speaker list — that would be stupid.
I imagine you must hate yourself then. Seems to me you are the epitome of stupidity and ignorance. But you vote Biden. After all he did say you aren't black if you don't.
FYI When Biden makes his VP pick I’m logging off Twitter for a month.
I’m for Biden/Harry
No, he can't run against Biden unless he switches parties. He's too far right for Democrats and too far left for today's GOP, which won't shift in his lifetime.
so neither biden nor trump
So what? Even Bideb knows 2 white men on a ticket at this time would be a disaster. And Pete is more unprepared to assume the job than ANY woman who has been mentioned. Biden's not that stupid, I hope.
He sounds like he's making a desperate last-ditch plea to Biden who has probably ruled out Warren. She'd be good, but she's not the be-all &amp; end-all &amp; with her age &amp; loss her seat, she's very unlikely to be his choice.
Next time someone comments on a Biden gaffe, show this video.

Wait a minute! You aren’t reeeeeeeally black, unless you vote for Biden! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♀️😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm not a Biden fan. I am a fan of getting the Trump crime family out of the White House. Donald Trump is by far the most incompetent,  corrupt president in my lifetime.....
I feel the democratic response has been weak.. more willing to complain about Trump then use whatever powers they have to fight back.. I could be wrong ... discussing Biden’s “bike prowess” disgusts me when T is dismantling the post office..
So Biden wears a mask on a bike ride ... and no helmet? ... Boy is he stupid
A. Ww want him around when Biden kicks his ass!
Ohio here.....im seeing more and more Biden yard signs in Eastern rural Ohio....and we don't often vote for losers...not since 1960 and 1884 before that
joe biden is shite, but 100% better than duffer trump

Joe Biden, SIR,your plate is full. YOU MUST look to the future to see who"CAN AND WILL"continue to make AMERICA the GREATEST place to live
Biden  should NOT MAKE his choice BASED on color! If YOU think so than"YOU ARE"more THE PROBLEM THAN ANYONE! I like Gov Whitmer  and I feel that STACEY ABRAMS  is ALSO a good pick. I JUMPED SHIP &amp;am voting by MORAL COMPASS, something MUST CHANGE!

You think it "looks like it" when Biden has said nothing (maybe he met with her about something else) but the media just needs a new toy to play with? I don't. It looks like nothing. No one knows at this point .
I think Joe Biden runs the Anonymous account just my theory
Yeah Biden can't even make a coherent sentence. Get used to crying for 4 more years cupcake.

😂😂😂😂I was pulling for Biden but everyone killed him before he had a chance 😂and maaaaannnnn I been coming up on more and more black trump supporters and it’s a shame but you ain’t never lied! People don’t know
For a man who hates and hurts God. That was said by the President.  Biden is Catholic, like most of Congress, so Catholics hates and hurts good? What test do you have to pass to please you?
There is no "incompetence" involved. The media is making it look that way with their breathless speculation but that's not on Biden. He's doing precisely what is always done.
Often true. McCain announced Palin on Labor Day weekend eve, just before the convention. Obama announced Biden on August 22, 2008; convention started on August 25. Others have been earlier. Kerry announced Edwards 4th of July weekend. It varies.
I don't agree it was "botched." Biden hasn't done anything. different from any previous candidate. It's just that the media has made this into a beauty pageant because I guess Trump's daily degradations aren't newsy enough.

Way too sensitive. Biden is such a great choice, right? Please tell me what that senile, old man has done in his 47 years in Government? Shame on his handlers and family for pushing him to do this. This is a circus!
I didn’t say anything derogatory re: Muslims I simply stated if Biden has control of the White House they would have more control. He said he wants to have Islam taught in schools. Damn right I’m a Christian! I don’t nd to know about Islam neither does most American Christians.
Biden actually goes to church and prays.
All he kept saying in Cleveland was: Biden is taking your guns and God. Your taxes are going off the charts. And China trade is going to fail. He repeated them 4-5 times.

YOU JUST THREATENED JOE BIDEN
Remember that time when Biden suggested the election should be delayed or that injecting bleach could cure corona? Yeah, me neither.
I think he's confusing the rapture with Joe Biden. And personally I'd like to see Trump raptured.Translation: To hell with #OH13, campaigning for Biden will help my political career.
You feel like you've been dealt a bad hand. Get the fuck over it and vote for Joe Biden. I did.
Biden and Harris are going to alienate enough of the democrat leaning population of the country to lose themselves an election. I've seen several very vocal social media political experts my age say they're sitting out this election after saying for 3 years that they'd vote for
I’m honored and excited to join Ohio Veterans and Military Families and  for a conversation about Joe Biden’s plan to restore American leadership and take care of our heroes. Join us this Saturday!
Yes!!! Ohioans have had enough of Trump’s failed leadership. We need real investment in working people!! #TeamJoe
Because Sherrod and Timmah are impotent? I thought we had 3 branches of govt. Oh, Benghazi and IRSgate were on Biden's watch
Screw Biden!

Oh hello millennial more from the peanut gallery. Kamala is a bigger joke than Biden. No way in HELL will the Dems win come Nov. us patriots are sick up to our ears w ur BS! We love our history good and bad we love our flag we love our president we love our constitution! #Trump
Mask? I don't need no mask! I'm Joe Freakin Biden! What are you? A junkie?
FRIEND 1: Biden should have chosen Tulsi Gabbard ....  FRIEND 2: I know, i get a boner thinking about that.   FRIEND 1:  Problem is, Biden likely would also, but for different reasons.
So pumped for Biden/Harris 2020.  is the perfect pick. And 2024, she will be getting my vote for Prez.
The irony of life is that Biden will be winning and and the Trump takes lead on November 3rd.  Then before mail ins can be accounted for Biden will die of Corona and Trump will get 4 more years.  Get ready for House Speaker to go rogue.

How much has Biden made for himself and his family, by abusing his power as Vice President ?
2019: Spent the year campaigning for president.  2020: Spending year campaigning for Biden for president. When does the "working for the people" part start and are our wasted tax dollars refundable?

Biden says Trump executive order is 'a reckless war on Social Security'
If they understood foreign policy they wouldn’t be voting Democrat ! Obama-Biden spent 8 years appeasing Iran and China which is why the Middle East is in shambles and America can’t even make PPE when we needed it most.
Trump saying that Biden will destroy America as we know it to scare his supporters is another example of Republican Golden rule.  Trump has already destroyed America as we knew it, he's even destroying the post office.

Imagine watching something Happen with your own eyes and not believing it. at least be honest to yourself and everyone else about why your supporting Biden. It’s not because Biden is a great guy or particularly accomplished, Everyone knows he’s not. Why are you supporting him?
Your definition of decent is very different then mine! Biden sexually propositioned a 13 year old girl. Wrote and passed the crime bill that included the 3 strikes your out law. And sold out America to China!

Same ! I’m in northeastern Ohio, in the Youngstown-warren area . I see tons of trump signs but I’ve yet to see a Biden sign anywhere.
There are millions of reason why Ohio is pretty much a sure thing for President trump. If Biden wins he kill off millions of Ohio jobs, and leave the Ohio economy in dire straits. Plus he’s basically just a male Hillary. Pro globalism, anti worker, killer of the middle class.
Let’s go!!! Joe Biden is making Ohio competitive.
Clinton signed in Nafta. Obama’s actions in the Middle East destabilized the whole region and his Iran Nuclear deal gave weapons and funds to terrorists, which they used against us and our allies. Obama-Biden passed the ACA which stripped healthcare from millions of Americans.
No it’s called chess.  Now Biden will respond and commit to something he doesn’t believe.

Wow, your clueless! Maybe you should spend some reading about how other countries feel about our election. Newflash .. they fear a Biden Presidency. The democrats created the Current Middle East crisis, Everything going on in India, Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, ect is all due to Obama.Joe Biden is fashionably liberal
Biden better clap back
It's a tribal marker though. One of Biden's assets is that there a lot more voters in the "middling academic record at State U" group than in the "meritocratic super-elite" group.
Joe Biden needs to have his own briefings with higher level experts as often as necessary. Show leadership and real scientific example.
Tell it to Biden.
Coach was funny, Biden’s an idiot.
Seriously, what are we going to do after the Left steals the Election? Will we have a second Revolutionary War? Will we allow Joe Biden to be sworn in as President? Will we allow our Nation to become a Socialist, Fascist, Nazi Nation? Will the Police and Military support us?
Hold on. Trump in Biden skin possibly
Still think Biden is a RAPIST and a RACIST?
bro he been lighting biden ass up he 2 tweets away from dropping a diss track
half of y’all talking abt how biden picked kamala are the same ones that say “at least Biden isn’t Trump” when they’re the same person. y’all don’t get an opinion.
And the division between minorities and white people hasn’t been lessened, not when I still see y’all on this Trump or Biden train, openly. The legality of racist actions are being condemned more, that’s it.
OMG.., reminds me of Obama &amp; Biden 😥🙌😃😃💞💞
They always say pick someone worse than you to be Vice-President, that way people won't want to assassinate you. Well, Joe Biden picked somebody worse than himself, who actually makes him look competent, which is amazing. Harris is so bad that Biden look like a Smart choice. Wow.
..but we know have the #BuffoonBitch2020 ticket, with Biden being even more of a criminal than Hillary (he actually did what Trump was accused of and impeached for) and Harris was a corrupt attorney general. It's literally Law &amp; Order (Trump/Pence) vs Lawlessness (Biden/Harris)..
They're not airing The Five for this crap of Biden introducing the bitch, Harris, WTF? At least Fox News could keep interrupting it like the 'Fake News' does and fact-check every lie spoken by both. I thought that Hillary and whoever she ran with was the worst ticket in history..
damn Biden, I thought you had more common sense than that.  You picked the one that slammed you the most in the primary.  I guess being a senile fool has its rewards.  If you get elected, I bet you won’t make the 1st 100 days before they 25th amendment you, the puppet.
If you've follow me on the political side, then you know I wanted a Bernie Sanders Presidential run against Trump, not Biden.  That said. The Tumor needs to be removed from our nation! Biden/Harris is the ticket. Support it.  But come 12:01 p.m. on January 20th, my voice rises.

Democrats trying to vote for Joe Biden
That was fast: thoughts about what Kamala Harris brings to the Dem ticket.
After what Biden said about black people, any black taking the job is in it for themselves, not the country. This “selection” is a joke.
Sure, Biden picked a woman, but that doesn’t change the fact that his VP is an authoritarian abuser of power, and “hoping” that she would use her power for good in the office of VP is a pipe dream. This is such a desperate grab for the youth vote it’s pathetic. #votegold
I am hyped and excited to be voting for Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ticket!!!!
So, 4 more years of basically the same no matter who you pick except this time you really think there's a difference because Biden has been pulling a Sony at 2013's E3
I'll say it right now, I was wrong, I really thought that Biden would pick Bernie Sanders as his VP, which would make sense to get all the Bernie Bros. Now it's the #BuffoonBitch2020 ticket. We'll see how the next few months go.
That's not the only thing to drop, as I can say that she the one who dropped down for Biden (take that however you want).
It'll be great as people start showing all the clips of Kamala Harris calling Joe Biden a racist and a rapist, then now telling everyone how great he is. Hypocritical hilarious. #BuffoonBitch2020
We already know the Vice-President Debate will be ridiculous, as Bitch Harris will claim racism or sexism against everything Pence says. Can't wait until Trump/Pence destroys Biden/Harris.
Can't be the only one who finds it funny that Joe Biden is being forced to select a Black Female Vice-President. The Party of Slavery is demanding their old White leader select a Black lady as his play thing. Obama was forced to pick Biden, now it's reversed. Just sorta funny.
Biden and son are liers.
Yes and no.  I'll vote for Biden regardless, but I'd love to see Tammy Duckworth get it.
I am ready in Ohio.., voting for Joe Biden and all blue in down ballot

I think the Democrats are hiding someone behind Biden. Have a great day and stay watchful. 🌹♥️Rashida Talib already said that Biden is “moveable”.
Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, your daughter just announced her support for Biden/Harris!😂😂
Hmmm, Biden never apologize for his stunning praise filled eulogy for KKK Robert Byrd who by the way never apologized for his past KKK proud participation. But I guess as long as he is a Democrat he gets a pass
let’s see, Biden supports un restricted abortion. He supports Christians being forced to pay for abortions. He supports the abolition of private health insurance. Biden is a China syncophant. The Chinese government is aggressively eliminateting all religion including Christianity
Exactly what I’m saying!!!! Use your vote for where it counts!! On Biden! Maybe one day the United States will be more than just a two party system and parties such as the Green Party will finally have a chance on the national stage but that day is not today. Vote blue.
Further Trump is a champion for the unborn. while abortion is rampant in this country there can be no real “social justice”. He is also a champion for religious liberty. You’ve got your priorities screwed up buddy.There is a reason Biden’s bishop refused him communion
I already wear a mask willingly. My state requires it in public places. But, why wear one out mowing my lawn. If mandated to that extent I would flat refuse to wear one. KMA Baby Biden. Girly Guy.

Hey Buck, Biden told us he doesn’t care about our rights when he made this proclamation so why would he care about the constitution?
Biden is out foxing Trump into taking his bait and favoring ridiculous position opposed by most Americans. Brilliant.
We will in a few months when the headlines read: Biden/Harris carry Ohio; Trump defeated”
Hard left will do anything to get rid of our real leader. They fear this red repeat map more than God. God will decide leadership over Biden/Kamala anti God  stance.

Biden and Harris proved it doesn’t take a rally to deliver a big message
I’m sorry but we need to be realistic. I support what they stand for but the Green Party will never get close to the number of votes it needs to matter. What they will do is take away votes we may need for Biden/Harris. They may not be the one’s we want, but they’re what we need.
Is it true your daughter endorsed Biden/Harris, rudy?
Vote trump or you’ll get Kamala Harris! If creepy Biden gets in, he’ll last about a year before he resigns
Talked to a old friend today. He's s independent. Said he most likely will vote Biden. Says he doesn't mind information tweets but hates the negative attack tweets. i knew that was a problem.
I can't wait to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
I get it. She’s not perfect and she made mistakes but if she and Biden win she can do some serious good in this country to make up for them
Just a reminder to everyone that a vote for anyone but Biden and Kamala is a vote for Trump and his campaign of hate
I preferred Harris to Biden for president and I think it’s possible Joe is pulling a Weekend At Bernies so I’ll end up getting my wish..
Get her and Biden tf outta here
VOTE FOR BIDEN/HARRIS HIGHER TAXES OPEN BORDERS NO MORE PRVT HEALTH INS GUN CONFISCATION DEFUNDED POLICE CHINA CONTROL OF AMERICA FREE HEALTH CARE 4 ILLEGALS ABORTION - ANY TIME INCLUDING INFANTICIDE
“Vote Biden-Harris:”open boarders, defunding police, elimination of prv. health ins., needless wars, unrestricted abortions anytime anywhere any reason, taxpayer funded healthcare for illegal aliens, confiscation of legal firearms, Capitulation to China, higher taxes.
I pray not it will take biden 4 years or more to clean up trump mess he made of the us
You really need to get glasses biden is way ahead of you clown
Is he confusing Biden for McCain even though that was 2012...no wait that was 2008!
He might want to check first with Pope Francis who has served Joe Biden Communion and believes Joe is a good Catholic. Pope Francis understands the distinction between your faith as a Catholic and your duty to uphold the laws of the US.
Might want to check in with Pope Francis who not only believes Joe Biden is a good Catholic, but has also served him Communion.
So, no, M4A isn’t the most popular health reform plan out there. The one Biden is running on and put in the platform is.
Um, no, it was also this which unlike the Hill Poll tested both proposals and (like Silver noted in 2019) found Biden’s approach more popular than M4A. Read what people cite then comment next time:
Except you weren’t. I’m sorry, but what you just said isn’t factually accurate. Biden’s “Medicare for the those who want/public option” polled better then M4A, every time.  That’s why he won.
I’m elated to see a Biden/Harris ticket!  Great choice Joe!
Biden is a Catholic.
Yeahhhhhhhh, Biden Harris 2020
You are right. That was misleading. I agree with what you tweeted. He is a Putin apologist. I didn't clarify that. I just made point that he is the type that make up lies about Biden. Sorry about that. At least that was my intent. I rather botched it up however.
Just want to advertise her that way.  Same as labeling Biden liberal leftist, which would be news to me.
Men have never been as genuinely gracious and publicly supportive of a former rival as every other woman Biden considered has already been to Harris.
picks  "Lipstick.on a pig"!....  "A step backwards for Women"...Joe Biden
If he were to win, Biden would be wise to populate his cabinet and advisors with many progressive-minded individuals, and I think he will. But the whole "Kamala is a cop!" thing is literally only an issue on red rose twitter. For the average American, she's a solid pick.
Tulsi Gabbard was a non factor. Her poll numbers went down because Biden and others went up. Gabbard has nothing to do with it.
You’ve been trying that all summer on Biden, too. It doesn’t work. The GOP is going to lose and it richly deserves to.
Because they want to attract more GOP members to vote for Biden. Seriously, you can’t figure that out?
So, the opposite of Biden.
Kamala Harris scheduled to speak right before the Biden family and Joe Biden.....
If this were the current Trump campaign, not only would we know the pick. But we’d know who in the inner cycle was for it and who advised against and the shameless act of pandering the nominee did to flatter Trump.  Team Biden? Nothing.
It’s pretty incredible where a two-point change that still shows a double digit lead is presented as “tightening” of race. Trump’s biggest advantage is media will handicap Biden now to try to bring it back into a horse race.
You’re ignoring that polling shows Biden’s plan is even more popular when polled against M4A. People have only been pointing that out for over a year.
Trump doesn’t have senior moments. Biden has senior eternities!
I’m always going to hope, but I feel as if it’s a bit on the edge of pandering.  I don’t want to think it but I have that feeling in my stomach , that woman’s intuition thing, gnawing at me that nothing will happen before the election.Then, what if Biden wins?  Bad news for us☹️
Biden/Beatty has a nice rhythm to it.  has the Congresswoman been to DE recently?
So Biden will be in attendance. Great news. Doubt he will invite Putin.
NY Times reports that  is likely to announcing his running mate pick as early as tomorrow to Wednesday:
Some of y’all really sick in the head to think that 1. Kanye would make a good president. And 2. That Kanye even intends on becoming president. He is doing this to pull votes away from Biden!!! He has no intention of winning. He is in league with Trump.
show this to CNN reports in a president and ask if they covered this.
What fake CNN won't report.
Some folks claim that Harris was too aggressive in the debate with Biden. But think of a debate between her &amp; Pence. She will demolish his sanctimonious butt.

Don’t be surprised if Bernie ends up being the veep pick.  Biden is changing his language about that lately 🤷‍♀️
Joe Biden has Michael Scott disease🤷‍♀️
I’ve been getting tons of mail from the Trump campaign while you led it. I am a Democratic County Party Chair and Biden delegate,
Why are you using Russian propaganda to attack Joe Biden!
Yet another example of why  owes  a public apology for criticizing Biden for saying Trump night try to steal the election:
Today: - Did call time in the morning to fund GOTV - Manned the office this afternoon to start handing out Biden yards signs (got unsolicited $ from that)  - Communicated with campaigns on updates on GOTV plan. - Did some emergency light plumbing in HQ. (No really.)
Biden trolls Fox News on running mate pick while biking. I’m here for all this.

If you want to vote for an established racist (Biden) that’s your choice. Just like it’s my choice not to.

Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’
So rude!  I’m insulted and I’m not even black!!  Biden is a lost cause🤷‍♀️
You’re missing the context of this coming right off the heels of Biden working with Sanders on an unity platform only to have folks like Nina then publicly whip against its passage. I’m tired of seeing us reaching out and constantly getting spat in the eye publicly like this.
Emphasis on push, not dictate, especially when you didn’t get the votes. Making the VP a red line is an insult to all the other things Biden has already done with Sanders to bring the party together. Nina Turner is a bad spokesperson for Bass after what she said this week, too.
Trump INHERITED a strong economy from Obama/Biden, it weakened every year until he absolutely imploded it this year. You have the worst job record of any President in modern times. Record breaking drops in GDP group. This thread is absolute nonsense.
I saw a report that Kanye isn’t the one putting his name on the ballot in battleground states but rather Trump lawyers and supporters are actually doing it to draw votes away from Biden. Complete crap! 😡
Your ignorance is appalling. Biden is personally against abortion. That is well documented. As VP or POTUS he is obligated to follow US laws. Even Pope Francis recognizes this distinction and believes Biden is a good Catholic. Your “beef” is with Congress, not Biden.
How long is a day? Still 24 hours right? Joe Biden has promised to do about 25 things on day one in office. He wouldn't get into office until the afternoon. Dummy
Dear Joe Biden. I saw your racist remarks on Black Diversity. But, my question is Where in Sam Hill is Irizona?
If Biden can destroy God, then Trump should give up, unless he believes he is more powerful than God. But that would be blasphemy.
Trump says that Biden is against God because Trump thinks he is a god.
His wife did a good job with this tweet. There’s no way on God’s green earth he wrote this. Too late though. People are finally realizing how racist Biden is.
It matters. Biden isn’t evil. Vote.
Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden via

get off the fence, Meghan, and show some respect for your father.  Endorse Biden and help get rid of trump.
In the past 48 hours alone, we’ve seen Trump campaign misappropriate a picture of  in prayer for a sleezy attack ad and Trump question Biden’s personal religious faith. These are new lows in politics. Trump should not be lying and attacking  religious faith.
Biden is a devote Catholic and has been his whole life. He has even met with Pope Francis a number of times to discuss policy and has received Communion from Pope Francis. Who should I believe, the Pope or Trump?

Wow. The arrogance it takes to make a statement like this after the GOP has created the largest deficit in the history of the US, put the US into a deep recession, and cost the US millions of jobs. Biden rescued the US economy once before. He can do it again.
Just a friendly reminder that Trump's administration has done more to "infringe" on your second amendment rights in 3 1/2 years then the Obama/Biden administration did in 8 years.

Lmao okay when Trump or Biden becomes a dictator who would stop them if the government took our shit away!
Oh why? So when Trump or Biden inevitably becomes a dictator we can't overthrow the government?
Biden AND Trump are both right wing losers.
There should be protests against Trump and Biden.
I don’t know one person who is voting for Bernie Biden

Y'all are thinking of the "revolutionary Communist Party of the United States" they endorsed Biden and they supress the left CPUS and RCPUS are totally different.
Earned everything huh?  Does Joe Biden not know how she got into “public service”.  For that matter, he went out of his way to announce that he wasn’t worried about the person’s qualifications but instead he picked her solely based on her being a woman of color.  #lies #Marxists
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
Too early to tell. Based on her primary though, I liked her better than Biden. Ask in October assuming we can actually vote.
Nope, we've had enough of conservatives like Biden and Trump
If Biden wins we riot and overthrow the government. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Oh yes, because Obama, a man who bombed 7 countries and killed innocents, created ISIS to help escalate the oil war, and marched with BLM but ignored their demands is definitely a great guy like senile rapist racist Biden.
Because Joe Biden is Trump 2.0
Yeah if only Biden didn't support half of Trumps values.
If Biden or Trump wins, should we just overthrow the government?
Y'all really think that Biden / Harris is a communist? That's hilarious, they listen only to their corporate donors just like Republicans do.
He doesn't need to do this, Joe Biden loses voters everyday by being Joe Biden
Really Biden, really? You picked a woman with a record of throwing people in cages for non-violent crimes? Way to go.

He is better than Biden. But not a good as #JoJorgensen2020
Only one. I see more Trump signs around every block than I do Biden signs.
He literally enabled ICE to do what they do, along with Obama.   Obama didn't do shit when Ebola was rapidly spreading.   Biden said he supports how Trump is handling the protests, I mean, c'mon, stop getting on your 2 knees just so you can slob on Biden.
Well, actually  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump, when he loses, blame the Democrats for appealing to former Republicans instead of leftists.
No, the reason cheeto man won is because Democrats decide to choose dumbasses like Joe Biden. Stop being a slave to the system, if you actually cared, you'd realize that Democrats and Republicans are the same. When Joe Biden loses, blame the DNC for not choosing better.
Our main choices this November (Dario/Jesse bots, don't you even dare) 1. A Fascist, racist, corrupt Trump 2. A racist, Fascist, sexist corrupt Biden 3. A pedophile supporting Libertarian 4. The best choice of all them
We deserve better than Biden and Trump.Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Texas, do not forget this! Biden is against fracking, the steel industry, and everything else that your states stand for, remember that in November and vote RED #Trump2020

Comm on man.  Wake up Biden and Harris will bankrupt the country and turn us into a fourth rate country   You should be afraid of these aholes
I heard todAy joe China is flooding twitter and Facebook trying to insure trump does not get re elected. I hope they don’t take advantage of the demoshits mail in voting. They could send in millions of fake votes for Biden. It’s clear China does not want trump around
I know you can tell how much I hate demoshits . They have been trying to destroy the country for over 3 years. I need to know how could anyone vote for Biden and Harris. I really need to know.  Help!!!
As I said. I didn’t forget. He’s not on that list.  I confused and need an answer.  Why in the holy hell vote for Biden.  We wants to enormously raise our taxes.  Give amnesty to illegal immigrants who cares if they jumped in front of immigrants trying to get in the country legit
I sure hope President Biden investigate Trump and all the other corrupt White House and cabinet officials. There must be consequences for their actions.

The Trump and Biden campaigns are like competing airlines, both with just one flight to the same destination.  Biden's planes are just a little slower, and the attendants quietly spit in your drinks instead of directly in your mouth.

Biden and Harris will destroy the USA!!!
My outlook on Biden's odds before he slapped more than two consecutive months of demonstration in the face was grim to begin with.  Predicting a landslide in his favor after he went with the "top cop" candidate seems completely delusional to me.
I thought he was running against Biden😂😂
If, by the grace of God, Joe Biden manages to remove Trump from office, he 100% needs to be primaried in 2024 if his cognition lasts that long.
Name a single voter who wasn’t backing Biden that was been persuaded by the announcement of Kamala. I dare you.  Conservative Dems are how Biden won the primary so they were already on board. This choice shows he doesn’t give two shits about progressives.

If it’s really true...then Kamala Harris is not African-American??? Why in the hell did Joe Biden choose her.  I thought some of my black friends wanted a black woman who is qualified to be VP???
She criticized Biden, then Tulsi and Biden ripped her over her track record as AG. Then she dropped out of the race. Then she endorses Biden, and 6 months later he “chooses” her. Interesting way of doing things. Everyone seemed to be more happy for Maya Rudolph than Harris.
The economy and taxes.  Read the Biden plan.  Would kill small business and middle class.

guess what diehard female dems will not vote for Biden because of you. You’re racist hate white peopke  their 60 percent of population . Latinos are 30 percent and won’t vote fir you.
Are republicans,  I do have hardened democratic. Female friends who after Harris pick will not vote fir Biden . Your guests said otherwise  without evidence. Harris is the worst pick because of racism, hatred of people and no one I know trusts her. Start with facts not opinions
That’s exactly why I’m voting Biden/Harris.👍🏼
Biden is trash and only dolts who are too ignorant to see how bad the Democrat party is would support him.
Biden, in my view, is the WRONG choice. So is Trump. I'm sorry to say it, but just like the last election, the only winning move Is to not play
I refuse to vote for Harris or Biden. I also refuse to vote for Trump. Compromising my ideals to vote for a "Lesser evil" is tantamount to cowardice.

I voted for Harris, Biden was my least favorite, so today's news looks pretty good to me.  Also, I'm pretty sure Warren will get a real good cabinet post.

I, for one, am glad Senator Warren will be able to champion her policies and pass them with Joe Biden as President. Imagine how effective she can be with a Dem controlled Senate. Strategically, she’ll be able to accomplish more.
Wasn't my first choice.  Liked Harris for AG.  Still voting Biden, and can't wait to watch Harris eat Pence alive
Given  temperament, should Biden/Harris win will her instinct be to lead, follow or get out of the way? The next few months should be telling.....  #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
Not at all - I see Biden as a chance to get things back to normal, and then take a big step forward in 2024... hopefully. We need candidates that people actually like, can get behind, and believe in. Hopefully they are under 50 with good, new ideas and policies that might help.
Any of Biden’s potential choices is better than Pence. Let’s compare apples to apples, here.
Why is everything that Biden says and does under strict scrutiny but Trump gets away with murder?

If you elect Biden he won’t know it.
Biden loses both ways. There are plenty of racist Democrats who won’t vote for Biden if he has a black running mate of either sex.
Probably No. But he tried his best to undercut Trump with a lot of lies and help from his inner circle. I think Trump, if he loses the election, should do the same to Biden. Trump should invoke China as working to boost Biden.
He probably says this because they have Biden running against him. How dare they!

I saw the part where Iran and China want Biden to win.  Weird how countries who hate the U.S. and want to hurt us would prefer Democrats be in power.
Okay, there is no ambiguity,  has stated his position. Biden wants to Defund the Police and take away the Law Abiding Citizens means of protecting themselves.  I know the  track record is not 100%, but I think the choice is clear.  #Trump2020  #2A
He said more than that. Basically, he’s saying “they all look alike.” Biden hassa prejudice against blacks. He has shown it many times over the years, even with a Obama.
Because Biden isn’t really going to be president.  His running mate will lead the way. I still have a gut feeling that Hillary is waiting in the wings.
China and Iran are U.S. enemies and want Biden to win.  Russia is not a U.S. enemy and wants Biden to lose.  Yeah, I'm siding with Russia on this one.  Biden and the Dems can go to hell.
Trumpsters aren't going to vote for Biden anyway. Calm down.
I'm getting them from his nice evangelicals today on how Joe Biden hates God. Trumps talking points yesterday and their of. The three "G's" set them off...God, guns and gays.

I really feel bad for gun owners.  Clinton took all their guns, just to buy new ones under Bush.  Then Obama took them all only to buy new ones yet again under Don.  Now Biden is going to take them all?  How many times are gun owners going to have to buy a brand new stockpile?

I don’t like Biden and I think it’s bad, but it’s probably worth looking at the whole interview
Anyone working for the trump campaign is evil. This wasn’t a smear attack against Biden which means nothing coming from the sources. This lying to parents to send their children into danger. Where is the land in sand for their supporters to be held accountable.
He spends so much time talking about Biden and Obama. I don’t recall any foreign leaders laughing at Obama or Biden. Trump is pathetic.
I gotta say if Biden has the kinda power to hurt God himself .... i think you gotta vote for him outta fear for what happens it you dont right ??
You can't teach an old Dem not to be passively "racist"...No matter what you republicans TRY to pin on Biden I will Vote for him.  Trump is the biggest criminal and liar that ever walked on this earth.
I really do feel bad for you, Jeff. Your blind faith towards this President that makes him immune to criticism in your eyes would make our founding fathers weep. Trump has sold out American workers and Biden’s union backing is clear of that.

Powerful question. Why are Harris and Biden running, almost literally, away from any media questions ? Why are they frightened? Will they finally agree to take questions from the media if they can get the questions in advance? If they can have time to prepare the answers for Joe?

The Democrats have to resort to mail-in ballots that can be forged by a number people all over the country to get Biden elected. If everything is on the up and up, Biden knows he will lose. Be an American and vote in person if possible.
As a retired carrier, I ask ALL postal employees to support and vote for Joe Biden. Joe has always supported the postal employees. Joe has ALWAYS had the support of the Firefighters Union. He is one of us. Can you HONESTLY say that about Trump???????????? No you can't!!
At least Biden can use one hand to drink a cup of water.
I’m actually sorry man, I saw her face and it doesn’t look good. I’m just so used to blatant political posts and took it as one. My bad, just skimming at it.both parties have garbage candidates. Biden is just as corrupt
No, what I’m saying is that with a 7-2 far right Supreme Court, $15 minimum wage is impossible for a generation.  Even if Biden doesn’t get it done, you can primary him from the left in 2024 and get it done then.

it’s defund the police not elect the police
if so, then your incrementalist approach is pre-k level. tweaks around the edges and leaving people in desperation while acting like the mission was accomplished is what led to the rise of trump, and if biden wins and passes no progressive reform, will give us someone worse

That’s a funny/good analogy because Biden looks like a bad version of Bobby barker.
Biden has literally been moved left since the primaries ended. Which never happens, nominees usually tack to the center after they get the nomination. Joe asked Bernie to help him set up working groups to draft new plans, which include the $2 trillion climate one.

If Biden is elected with KH (or anyone else) on the ticket, he will soon after, resign giving that person a backdoor to the presidency and culminating to a disaster for this country.
One Biden sign on Matt’s street and he went crazy... small towns man😂 thanks  for the vid

Well the thing to do is for everyone to vote Biden/Harris so that he is humiliated into concession. Which is what he deserves.
Lean into?  The extent of Biden's understanding is sparce.  He leaned on "his faith" in times of crisis and asserts de fide for all else.  No perceivable difference between Biden and Harris re theology.
Biden calls for mask mandates in all 50 states: 'It's about saving Americans' lives'  via  👏Yes!!!
Auditioning for a Biden White House?   fawns for ‘how they would lead’ in the pandemic
con't. Now that Biden has a mouth. He's "speaking", or his co-hort is speaking-which-ever.  I'm not impressed. And to add to that-no poll taker has every called me. I would not answer. And so be it.
Not a single one of these applies to Biden/Harris. Try again.
And im an independent, I vote the way I see fit and shes unfit. Biden should have went with Tulsi and their would be more enthusiasm. Sorry but Biden loses this year simply because of his VP choice
SeTtLE fOR BidEn
So it's ok for Biden to talk poorly about the President but should not be done visa-versa. Interesting. Biden has been in his bunker for months, and makes statements. Being a Monday morning  quarter back The Presidents has been out there doing his job. con't

As you know, Biden has a framed copy on his desk of a "Hagar the Horrible" comic strip. And he picked "Horrible Harris" for his VP. Coincidence?
Three months? More like three years if Biden is elected. We will live in a country where everyone will be told what to do, when to do it, and where. Give me liverty or give me death! 2021 will be very ugly.
The GOP of Hamilton County Ohio responded to Biden with "Resist!"  #GOPFail #Shame
Of course they answer yes, especially today when contrary opinion gets you assaulted. Now ask them if they favor a national mask mandate that results in fines as Biden will direct. Big difference.
Getting desperate for money? When you have a Biden ad I change the channel. You know that what he did on video is an actual crime? Extortion maybe?  You all have lost the confidence of lots of patriots. Ever since you put Paul Ryan on the board, you suck
Just saw a Biden commercial talking w a lady who lost her Mom to Covid and blamed  . Of course it is sad and every life is precious, BUT to politicize a death due to what China did and blame ANY American is gross, disrespectful, and disgusting.
Why is Joe Biden smelling this women’s hair?
Biden/Harris will strengthen int'l terror groups w/ same Obama cash on a pallet approach. That $$$ funded Hezbollah. Hezbollah likes to fire missiles to US bases in Iraq. Trump got their General (Soleimani). We can't throw money at terror groups.
This movie is basically what it will look like if biden takes over. God help us.
No thanks. Convenient timing for the Democrats. Those three months are up right after the election? Joe Biden might be disconnected from reality but the majority of us see right through this.

What if Joe Biden just released a somber and reverential speech beginning with, “We all know this has been a hard Shark Week for everyone.”
Holding Biden/Harris accountable for their past policies and acknowledging they're flawed candidates, but still voting for them is an ideal space to be in. Pretending they're perfect is misguided, not voting at all means you're complicit in Trump's potential reelection.
Vote for Biden
You must be new here. See any of biden's videos lately?
A Democrat’s, Democrat! Wow, this one is really bad.  Biden/Harris 2020- We know... no shame
HOW many of you think Biden will; get injured, heart attack, virus, SOMETHING B4 Nov? Be pushed aside. And Voila-Big Mike appears as THE Candidate??? I still do. #DeviousDems
Idea....Re-enact the escalator with "Sliden Biden" coming down a set a stairs in one of those electric stair chairs. Slap some Aviators on him and have Kamala walking behind him like Melania. Do it in a "Simpsons" cartoon format/setting
Clearly Biden and Harris are far left.  Their statements and voting records confirm.  Cobb has to support them, if not, she's not black.  if not, she's not a woman.  If not, she's not a democrat.  paraphrasing Joe Biden's own words here.
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
Ah, don’t be.  No way he wins unless it’s by fraud, the guy hasn’t managed more than a few hundred live viewers in person or online.  Sure you’ll have a villiage idiot, have for generations, but media is still lying.   Biden/Harris live vs Trump live
AOC liked her tweet. I’m a Dem, but have concerns about the future of the party as it relates to Israel. I feel pretty good about Biden, though.

Since you posted the video of Joe Biden saying racist things, I'm surprised you don't support him. He also doesn't believe black lives matter so it seems like you would be a fan of his. Am I missing something?
The twist, Kamala transitioned and actually was Cornpop until the 80s. Coming to exact his/her revenge for gettin tossed from the pool.  Genius since we all know Biden never sees 2021 if “elected”.
I think all USPS workers and their union should know for certain who is committed to destroy their work place. Vote Biden, save your jobs. Pass it on to friends and familIt’s.
Lol, Biden not gonna win. So it doesn't really matter either way.
I heard Biden picked Kamala bc she is more Indian than Pocahontas
I am all for the President being re-elected. As for the people, they need to question themselves, is their hate for the President enough to put this country down in the toilet by electing Biden. This country will crash if Biden is elected.
yeah, i don't get it.   i can not comprehend how they have the time and energy to complain about biden/harris when the alternative is trump/pence.
Also, right now we really need you leading white Jesus-following women in voting for Biden Harris. Let’s do it!
Now that the Democratic President-Vice President ticket is set, and Vice President Biden with Senator Harris are going to be the Democratic ticket on the November ballot, I figured now is a good time to remind everyone that, you might not have gotten your way or your choice …
All the candidates who dropped out before super Tuesday are "owed" gifts by Biden too. Likely cabinet positions.
My cousin is somehow trying to make a point that me being upset about mark kozelek being a rapist is hypocritical of me being mad that joe biden is a rapist
Well Trump thinks pedophiles should get the death penalty, so that means he feels the same way about Biden and many of the Democrats...and some Republicans, celebrities, and aliens.
Obviously I'm voting for Biden but that doesn't stop this from making me laugh out loud by myself on the couch
I can’t believe we have to choose between Cheeto man or Snake Biden &amp; Lady Mass Incarceration 🥴🥴
My cousin-in-law's parents hate Trump but won't vote for Biden because they draw a hard line with their 'pro-life' stance. This is selfishness and an inability to understand context at it's peak, IMO. Writing in a third-party vote ensures we live in this hell another 4 years.
I would personally love to see Hillary have a place in the Biden administration.
Try real news. I know since Catherine Herridge left you don't have any real investigative journalists, but talking about polls is useless since they've been so wrong. How about fact-checking what Biden and Harris say? They're lying on a daily basis.🤦
Buck, 3 months at least is what he said.  What else is in about 3 months.  Just a ploy to use in his campaign.   He will continue to say Trump does not care.  JoKe Biden is at it again!
I wonder if Democrats realize, if Biden wins, the surge to remove him will begin almost from the day he takes office, and it will come from within his own party. BLM and Progressives are not going to let a dottering old white guy stand between Harris and history.
i understand that and i respect that, but i’m not sure bieden will actually end fascist policies created under trump. children are literally still in cages yet i don’t think biden will change that practice. wealth is accumulated through exploitation.

Biden is right on this

Biden and Gabbard.  Even though Biden hadn't formally announced his campaign, it was so obvious that he was gonna run and win the primary. And I vowed to not vote for him.

This is how totalitarianism is coming to the United States. Comply or else be jailed and fined.
Biden mispronounces Kamala’s name the same as Tucker. Nothing to see here.
So that they can dutifully parrot in the media every word Biden and Harris speak.
Why Biden though? It’s strange that in a time where we need police reform the only candidate the left has is a guy who wants to increase police budgets, has a cop as his VP and was a life long republican until he joined the Obama campaign.
And why Kushner?  Because Kushner believes to his core that a Black billionaire will steal the Black vote fron Biden, because everyone admires billionaires. No one ever questions Kushner’s judgement, even though Kushner has only succeeded in being a son-in-law.
Biden’s controllers won’t even let him do interviews or talk to national media unless it’s all scripted. It’s going to be a #TrumpLandslideVictory2020
Meh...I don't know. If she'll support a terrorist group and vote for Biden she's obviously not too big on standards.

Counterintuitively, Biden agreeing with his political rival on something publicly is extraordinarily refreshing, even if it is Trump who’s trying to take the credit.

Exactly. You’re spot on. I worry about how his supporters might take it if he claims voter fraud.   In the end, I guess, he won’t be president anymore and therefore will have zero power. If he tries to stay, Biden can call the army to get him out. It’s still almost frightening.

My bank account says your assessment is incorrect. The difference between the Biden obama economy and President Trump's is as different as black and white. Trump's economy was thriving while bidens was snail pace.
Granted, under a Biden Administration I don’t see our country caging children at the border, and I’m sure a Biden Administration wouldn’t have bungled COVID the way trump has. But that’s almost the bare minimum. Let’s not celebrate the bare minimum, let’s ask for a little more?

Honestly, Joe Biden would love to be the person who “saves” the post office by selling off significant chunks of it.
People say this shit like they actually know what the hell theyre talking about. The reality is a Biden Administration is similarly corrupt to Trump, and in many ways more effective at deploying their corruption. All under the guise of ”the people’s party”.
The problem with the right and left, is they don’t question authority. They don’t fact check. They say “this sounds good, must be true” or “Trump/Biden said it, it’s true” etc

Congress adjourns without negotiating a stimulus bill and Biden is making headlines calling for a national mask mandate that should have been instated in at least early March. Despicable

Am I correct in understanding that you believe that voting for Biden will "move us to the right", as opposed to letting Trump have another 4 years?  Bernie has as much chance of getting the blue endorsement as my socks do. You've every right to be mad, but rational is good too.
kamala sucks. trump sucks. biden sucks. what are we suppose to do? voting third party is an option, but also not the best choice to get trump out of office. 🥵
The chance that Trump gets prosecuted for anything he's done as POTUS is negligible. Best we'll get is a toothless report about his violations in 2-3 years, then the Biden/Harris admin. will decline to prosecute "in the interest of moving forward together as a nation". Bet on it.
People seriously think that Kagan and Sotomayer are the same type of SCOTUS judge as Kavanaugh and Gorsuch and Biden would really not appoint anyone better. I don’t like Biden that much but sometimes I wonder what worlds these people live in.

No, I misunderstood and was reading news about Dump. I tend to agree with you. I think Biden should push for a national holiday. Yes, not easy, but it’s the fight that counts.
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide protective mask mandate, citing health experts’ predictions that it could save 40,000 lives from coronavirus over the next three months.
Yes it did go to china. And Trump brought manufacturing back . obammy amd biden asked trump what are you going to do wave a magic wand.
Fuck Ryan! He trashed Liz the moment she endorsed Biden he can kick rocks
I have nothing but disgust for the contingent that seems to want Biden/Harris to lose in order to prove that the electorate chose the wrong people.
We are definitely in a battle for our souls. Joe Biden wants to sell our souls to the evil demons that want to harvest our life force energy. It's all part of their New World Order plan. This is all a Spiritual Warfare, one in which we will win by aligning with the Divine Source
This person assumes there will be any papers to place somewhere. I suspect during the time of the Election until Joe Biden enters office, they'll be busy shredding everything, laws be damned.
This is why I don't believe many Rs will switch  over this election and vote Biden. They stick together like flies on you know what. It isn't in their DNA to vote Dem.
1. Noone is impeaching Trump or attempting to and you know it. 2. Trump wouldn’t be trying to literally defund the post office if he didn’t think the votes would be for Biden.

I have. Had one tell me to write Biden a letter about my concerns about him (lol) but to not talk about it publicly.
Biden/Harris of course because I love the United States of America.
In summation, stop shilling for Biden, if he’s a good candidate he can win on his own without you forcing your politics down other people’s throat and shaming people for holding firm to their values because your’s are surface level and based in group think.
Yep! Believe that and you believe that Biden isn't a racist because he's always talking about his one black friend!
But if Trump wins we’re 30 years away from any progressive legislation that’s signed into law being affirmed by the Supreme Court  Which means we go from Biden’s $2 trillion climate plan mostly written by  to no climate legislation until 2050 even if AOC is president
Is it suppression? Or is it the fact that young Black voters aren't enthusiastic about the candidates?   #ADOS
So what? Biden isn't owed our votes.
When are people going to realize that you don’t owe Joe Biden your support. Yes, Trump bad, I know. But that doesn’t mean you have to shill for his campaign and shame people into voting for him. The fact is it’s incumbent on Biden to win over voters with his platform and policy.
This is why I’m voting for Biden. I’m not saying he’s perfect. But damn he’s better than Trump and unfortunately we don’t have any other viable options. But our country needs help out of this pandemic.
Yes, I registered green after voting for Hillary in the last presidential election left me feeling bad about my decision and will likely vote green this time around. Definitely not voting for Biden or trump.
VOTE:   Who would you vote for if the election was today? 1. Trump/Pence 2. Biden/Harris

Still time to change their minds.  How anyone can think Biden is competent to be President is beyond me!  Just listen to his interviews this year, especially recent ones!
I totally forgot about that... I might... just... be okay with Biden/Harris (1  term)  and then a Harris/Yang and then... (little finger near mouth) a Yang/_____ ? 🤔🤪

Are you kidding me?  Biden makes racist comments all the time. Biden spoke at a kkk funeral.  He called a CNN host a junkie.   He changes the way he speaks when he talks to person’s of color.
Selecting Kamala "Top Cop" Harris after months of nationwide protests is merely the latest in a clear trend of Biden's decisions. It is a clear message to young people like me who find the status quo intolerable.  That message is "I neither need nor want your vote."
Well...looks like Biden has a lock on Rhode Island.   Update your electoral maps accordingly.
Finally we can look forward to Science Based Info on where we are at....#Biden_Harris2020 go Joe
Looking at how Biden has underperformed with younger voters both white &amp; POC as compared to that group’s disapproval of Trump picking Harris might help consolidate those voters
Food for thought:  Year after next Joe Biden will be 80.  His female running mate is first generation US citizen.  Dangerous deficiency in this choice.  "Jumping on the bandwagon" is not always wise for the bigger picture.  Please think of the next generation Americans &amp; past one
Not Joe Biden 🤣
Biden's staff REALLY doesn't want him to be potus if they approved THIS tweet....HOLY CRAP what a PERVERT! Should have Harris send this one out.
It's amazing that the simple act of being human is all you need to throw contrast between Biden/Harris and Trump/Pence. Policy,leadership and integrity are important, but I now realize how much I crave real people back in the WH, not the narcissistic megalomanic currently there.
What is a "pool spray"? Will you be in a Biden/Harris splash zone? Personally, I wouldn't want them spraying me with anything, regardless of the COVID situation
Biden will fund the post office at least, which is a Constitutionally guaranteed right.  I doubt you have enough brain cells to comprehend that though, just believe what Fox News tells you and continue sucking the boot of a corrupt businessman who doesn't give a shi% about you.
Just now watching the Harris speech. One of the things that really struck me was her talking about how she relates to/interacts with others. Her kids, God children, her husband, Beau Biden. All we've gotten for the last 3.5 years is Trump talking only about himself.
Tears of sorrow, Trump is already doing those things, if Biden makes it into the WH are economy is doomed, stock market will crash, jobs loss, zombie apocalypse
Out of the 4 Biden Pence Trump Harris .... Harris seems like the most joyful
I thought Joe Biden was a racist?
The celebration has just begun, BIDEN/HARRIS
Naaah! You’re like the little boy who cried wolf and all the while you were the wolf! You are so afraid of Biden-Harris you need more drugs and a diaper change. #TrumpKillsUSPS #AmericaOrTrump #Bunkerbaby
Of course not. Yesterday  linked to the Biden site.
Pure politics: Once upon a time, “Biden de­fended the Obama-era pay­roll-tax cut in a 2011 opin­ion arti­cle saying that the cut wouldn’t af­fect So­cial Secu­rity be­cause funds would be trans­ferred from the federal gov­ern­ment’s gen­eral fund.”
It will be a monumental task but hold on America, Biden/Harris &amp; team are up to it. Restore America Again will begin on Day 1.
Actually according to YOUR logic, not supporting or voting for Trump is a vote for Biden.  Btw fear mongering is sooooooo yesteryear.  Maybe try something other than shame. We gotta actually give AF about your patriarchal conditioned reaction in order for it to work. 🙄
Maya Rudolph reacts to Kamala Harris as Biden's VP pick, her SNL return
man if y’all don’t shut the fuck up &amp; vote for biden instead of being cry babies. if you don’t vote, trump gon win again. then what? you’ll cry for another 4 years.
I'm pretty sure a Biden administration will work to undo a lot of Trump's damage, but also pardon him, in the unlikely event that he's actually charged with anything.  No US president has ever been punished for their crimes, and Biden isn't going to buck that tradition.
Potus is on a roll!!!  I want to see how Biden attacks Potus's foreign policy in the next few months - sadly expect some FF to interfere - they will not work
Biden-Harris are FOR this
Biden Obama could not and DID NOT do anything
Harris has said that she would rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, an agreement that sends aid to Iran, a regime that routinely calls for Israel’s destruction. This keeps her aligned with Biden, who was part of the Obama administration that brokered  the 2015  handout agreement.
Point the obvious.  Wag that dog. Joe Biden is being forced by the machine - sad. A follower 77 years of his life.  Leading is just not in his nature.  He won't last the first term.  Ppl (blinded by the media) is supplanting system with Kamala as president (not Joe).
Nothing new,  just like Obama, you CAN'T SAY..ABOUT insert name,  they're....(insert racial makeup) even if it's not so 1st BLACK PRESIDENT(mixed) Harris is not Black she's Indian and Jamaican (Whatever) so racist, pick brown and woman that will show you,don't remember Biden KKK
I’m not a fan of Biden either. He will either die or be exposed soon imo. I think we need to be wary of them both honestly.
After much consideration Joe Biden has decided Kamala Harris smells like the right choice.  Ha ha
One Tough Question For DOJ If Biden Is Elected: Whether To Prosecute Trump
Like what Joe socialism Medicare for all take away our guns open borders and the list goes on and on no thanks Joe and Kamala Harris I will stick with Trump he's making America great unlike Biden and Obama who was destroying our country depleting our military losing Manufacturing
Who is "we" lol. I mean Biden told me to fuck off
Americans are waking up to the reality that the battle for souls IS actually what is happening. “One nation under God” and our Constitution vs the anti-God Marxist/socialist/communist doctrine the Biden/Harris ticket has been manipulated into espousing. #WakeUpAmerica #MAGA2020
Wait, wait: how is voting for Biden "aiding and abetting pedophilia and human trafficking"? I am not a particular fan of Biden, but US presidential elections (or selections) are often about holding one's nose and voting for the lesser of 2 evils. Is Trump divisiveness the choice?
😂😂😂Trump brought it to new heights that Obama and Biden’s “progressive” strangle hold couldn’t and then the “virus” came during an election year......how convenient
A lot of stories today, How can Biden forgive the evil things Headboard Harris said about him during the primaries?  Truth is Sniffin Joe doesn't remember the primaries.
Unfortunately it’s gonna take Biden &amp; Harris 4 years to clean up the shit show Trump &amp; the GOP have created. You need to do some serious soul searching (if you still have one) about your priorities. Corporations didn’t need a bailout. The American people did. You fucked up!!
If anyone can manage to lose despite having victory handed to him on a silver platter, it's Joe Biden.
He really doesn’t know how to respond to the Biden-Harris  he goes after Morning Joe and CNN?What a loser 😄  #bidenharris2020 #dumptrump
Those are not false claims against Biden.
Please stop using my religion, and the POPE, to push your partisan agenda. Biden is a disgrace as a Catholic.
Biden told people to vote for Trump. That should have been disqualifying. "Vote for someone else if you don't like it" is exactly what I intend to do.
It has been so nice getting to know more about Joe Biden than just as Robin to Obama’s Batman. Hearing of his faith as a Catholic, his life tragedy as a young father and watching him pick his fiercest critic as a running mate has moved me fully into a supporter. #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden yesterday, “I've asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room... always tell me the truth... challenge my assumptions if she disagrees. Ask the tough questions. Because that's the way we make the best decisions for the American people."
#FireJeaninePirro just when you think #FoxNews can’t get any worse, their host threatens #Biden.
Wow the first day Joe and Kamala speak together Biden butchers her name. Must have been all about disrespect
Wouldn’t Joe Biden make more sense... oh wait, ya better let Kamala lol
Lets see. Joe Biden has Kamala Harris and you have Mike "ass kisser" Pence. No brainer Diaper Don.
Biden and Harris ticket is what traditional America is going to look from now till the end of time. You better be on board or you will be left out. America future is one people with different colors living together as one family. Unity is strength.
This is all quite fascinating, but the simple fact is that when you wake up the morning after...or the week after...or the month after the election either Biden or Trump will be president. Can you seriously tell me you'd prefer it be Trump? All the rest is just window dressing.
“Democrats are counting on the cult of non-personality to end the flamboyant Trump era.”
These people are fucking nuts, I'm done with this reach. They have no examples to back this and they all  are repeating it. Imagine if Warren or Sanders was the nominee. Biden &amp; Harris are  moderate. I cant wait until the GOP dies and then they'll see what liberal really means.
It will make you dizzy!!! Here we go with the fake Russia crap again, it’s exhausting!
please for the love of god vote biden. he’s a horrible choice, but your third party vote will not win, i can promise you that. vote so that people like this are not in the majority
Biden’s right arm is jacked. Sure sign of some neurological disorder.
If biden gets in this country will be so broke with new green deal , free everything for anyone that steps across our border with job losses galore. Just like with obammy. And higher taxes to pay for all the poor peoples problems
Ahh but She and Biden can cure what is wrong with your ticket.  Cannot wait until Propaganda Kellyanne is silenced.  Tokyo Rose had nothing on you!
Oh please!  Have you not seen the video of Joe Biden pressing his penis against a young child’s back!  That is sick, disgusting and down right nasty!  Oh yeah, Joe also like it when young kids jump on his lap!  Stop slandering the wrong man!
Joe Biden is a racist. Trump is not
That’s weird cuz Biden said black people aren’t black if they don’t vote for him, he said black people all think the exact same way, compared black kids to cock roaches, said u have to have an Indian accent to go into DD or 7-11. Even his own VP pick called him racist
Trump inherited the longest expansion of economic recovery from President Obama and Vice president Biden in  the history of this country, just like any other thing he inherited, he ran it straight to the ground.
FFS, how can his supporters hear this 💩 and not realize he has lost it? 🤪 he really is certifiably crazy!  "He also said the party's "Green New Deal" calls for "no cows," before making his claim that all Democrats want to abolish all animals."
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
Stand up for the woman RAPED by Joe Biden!!! Make yourself useful like!!!
Kinda sounds like  I’m in 🤷‍♀️💁‍♀️❤️
I don’t think it really matters. Joe Biden was a safe puppet pick anyway. It’s the people behind the curtain who have been calling the shots the last 3 decades anyway.
'Months to prepare': Trump’s ‘disarray’ after Kamala Harris joins Biden mocked on Morning Joe
He wishes his wife looked as hot as Biden’s “Aunt jemima” Fucking racist.
The point is, anybody with any common sense can tell that Biden is one and Trump isn’t.
Do we really need ANOTHER person with mental illness running for President? Don't we have enough already? #KanyeWest #trump #biden #maga
Holy shit! You weren’t kidding. Attacking Biden from beyond the grave IS pretty nuts!
I live in OH and I can assure you all neighborhoods throughout our state, urban and suburban, are starting to get filled with Biden signs, bumper stickers, window decals, t-shirts and etc. Ohio will not be Trump’s state this time around!
Obviously it's completely fucked to say whether kamala or any person "is" black or not but also joe biden literally fucking did that like a month ago
Trump campaign tweets mugshots of alleged criminals, all of them Black, to claim Biden is pro-crime  via
But you must admit Biden/Kamala has a great campaign ad.
They want to destroy our nation Obama and Biden almost destroyed it in they're eight years! Depleted our military, lost thousands manufacturing jobs, 8 million more on food stamps, put regulations on our businesses so they couldn't grow, gave Iran billions of dollars
Don’t you mean Biden?  HE’S THE NOMINEE!😂😂
I must admit this Biden/Kamala ad is the real deal.
Kamala Harris first words as vp for biden was "obama only let 2 people die from his pandemic. Remember Ebola? Yea me either cuz Barack saved us! Shes immediately using the pandemic as a political weapon. Matter fact trump is doing a pretty damn good job. Smh.
So  decided to hope and pray none of the democratic voters look into Harris’ political career and the fact that she on all honesty might be more republican that Trump. The  didnt want to win when Joe was nominated. They are outright throwing with Biden-Harris
Not Biden?
What Are They Afraid Of? Biden and Harris Take No Questions From Reporters After First Appearance Together
When will the Presidential candidates debate? Biden should NOT get any preferential treatment! If the Dems think he is a viable candidate, then he needs to step up &amp; act like one! If he gets exposed for the dementia he has, then so be it! America cannot have a president like that
You know Biden pronounced it wrong right in front of her yesterday, right?
Joe Biden is racially insensitive? Look at this insulting photo that is your background.  Not only is it offensive to black people but to Ronald Reagan, one of our best presidents. Wow
I bet pres biden will never tweet about tv shows.
This thread is so eye opening! Thank you for the awesome question and the clear boundaries. This thread inspired me to write to Biden/Harris and ask them to address their “tough on crime” past for those whose communities were destroyed b/c of it.

If you're referring to her saying that about Biden you're incorrect. If you are saying she said it about #45 I seriously doubt she would take that back cause it's true. Just my thoughts
Ridin’ with Biden!
Biden and Harris proved it doesn’t take a rally to deliver a big message
There's not enough time. Biden wins and everything disappears...
Lol . Biden mispronounced her  name the very next day ! So Joe disrespected his running mate on Day 1?
And it ain’t like there’s been any president that’s been good anyway 🤷🏿‍♂️ a vote for Biden is a vote for pedophilia
Biden is not fit to debate, he's not fit to be POTUS.   Kamala harris is a communist, paid for by Soros. I have no interest in hearing anything she says.
I dont need a boost but fuck Joe biden
Russia was a 4 year lie and that has been proven. Hilary obammy and biden all tried to spy on trump campaign. Cant wait for durham report but you keep drinking your kool-aid.  Also dems have used the black vote for years, rejected removing slavery, came up with jim crow laws.
Well then biden would be grandpa
I said that last night.  Exactly Biden is not there.
You can spout all the wonderful things you want but the country isn't buying it. Basically you'd be voting for kamala or trump. Biden is not home
1. Yes I think Biden can be president. That’s why I support him. 2. Yes she is a natural born citizen. She was born in the United States. End of conversation. But her parents were citizens at the time of her birth. Not that it is relevant. Read the 14th amendment.
it’s crazy I had Trump tweeting a sims level animation video of Biden pump-trolleying down a railway on my 2020 bingo card
yet Biden wants open borders
Two clowns running against each other. Trump throwing the first pie. Awaiting Biden’s video.
I don't believe that the Democrats or Republicans that run our country really care about us as citizens but Trump has to go and Biden is the only way for that to happen unfortunately
Biden will not be elected. So there.
Total BS. Biden wasn’t even in my top 5, but there’s no need to lie about him cheating. Bernie’s appeal was flat this time around and he underperformed in states he did well in back in 2016. The “rigged election” meme is a total lie. Move on.
"TRUMP INHERITED THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, JUST LIKE ANYTHING HE INHERITED, HE RAN IT STRAIGHT INTO THE GROUND "
Y’all really just going to settle for Biden? Like he ain’t the same as trump but okay lol
Kamala Harris is a historical vice-presidential candidate. #kamalaharris
Just got off the phone with Biden and Harris, we had a long discussion over my proposed policy advocating for state mandated Chrome Hearts trucker hats. They told me they’re heavily considering adding it to their platform.
My brother in law (executor of the estate) was informed that my father in law whom passed in December; received a letter from the democratic party thanking my father in law for voting for Joe Biden.... So what's your point. A two party system is the most corrupt system
Hope their Birthing strike is still goin strong.    Natural selection will take care of the rest in good time.  If your voting Biden, your prolly not looking both ways before crossing, and a helmet only goes so far.
If Biden wanted young people to get excited about his ticket, he should have asked    She would have said no, of course.
He should do a skit on Biden's mental decline. Now that's comedy!!!!
Let me shout this LOUD so you all can hear me clearly.  I fully support the Biden-Harris ticket.  Though I thought the pick was going to be Elizabeth Warren or Susan Rice... Mrs. Kampala Harris has the FIRE and…
Jeffress digs dudes that grab pussies.
Antifa dot com = Biden/Harris
This aged well with Biden’s pronunciation today. Please address.
I agree. But Biden is funfamentally a kind and decent man, and the Trump people regard that as a disgusting weakness.
I didn’t expect to be this excited, but I am loving the Kamala pick!  She is so comfortable with it all...and she is going to be the bulldog that Biden isn’t meant to be.  He’ll transition us from Trump, and help us heal as a country, but she is going to lead us into the future!

ewwwww my dad said he looks like joe biden there
I laughed so out loud when I heard Biden mispronounce her name🤣🤣🤣. #PhonyKamala #Trump2020Landslide #bidenlosingit
Nixon-Kennedy, 1960. Radio listeners said Nixon won. TV viewers said Kennedy.   Reagan probably won by debating. But I don’t see many other elections shifted by debates, other than perhaps the absolute destuction of Sarah Palin by Joe Biden.
Try actually to appear like journalists and tell the Obama Biden spying on the Trump Campaign story, the Crossfire Hurricane story, Schiff lying to the American people, the lying to the FISA court, and the lying under oath to Congress by the senior FBI under Obama
Barb.  I understand why people do not like Trump. I am going to do my best to understand that people are voting against him in many cases, and I support the idea of opposing Trump. I just wish it would be easy for me, Biden, Kamala, Obama, Hillary, Pelosi, they all make me sick.
I guess Biden did say he would do what Trump did.  Bring manufacturing back, and keep Fauci.  He’s pretty good at plagiarizing.
“Kamala never aChtuallY said Biden was a racist!”...are the same people that say “Trump called they Charlottesville people verY FiNe PeoPLE”. They hear what they want and repeat lies until people believe it.
Fear-mongering by claiming that Biden will put the only other African-American Dem Senator, Cory Booker, in charge of a fictitious program he says will "invade suburbia" with "low income housing" is white supremacy &amp; well beneath the office of president. #Racism #VOTE
Spying on a campaign isn't a big deal?  Cool, so Trump can spy on Biden and Harris and lie to the media about how they're Ukraine stooges.  Cool.  Moron.
Seriously? You're whining about CNN covering the first Biden-Harris event?
Good job Joe  Biden Harris 2020 clean out the current swamp
It’ll be great watching Trump lose his presidential seat. But I hope Biden doesn’t think it’s going to be all praise and glory if he wins. I’m cooking him and Kamala regularly.
Seems like if you read it I am still contemplating. At the moment I’m leaning toward Jo Jorgensen because Trump is really not acceptable... it still makes me vomit when people are enthusiastic about Biden or any of the corporate Dems.
Yes. He has a living son, and Trump will spend most of his time discussing Hunter Biden’s qualifications for the Presidency. I’m sure he’ll find something revolting to say about Beau, because cruelty is the point.
I mean where are they on this USPS stuff? Did they talk about anything other than Biden and Harris at Trump's press conference today? Media doing the same thing they did 4 years ago. Mind blowing
tRump continues to instill FEAR, as BIDEN/HARRIS offer HOPE😊
Ah, Biden. I was screen flipping between Trump news and Biden news. I should not read this late!
Hot take: If the Senate in 2020 is 50-50 with President Biden, Joe Manchin will be more liberal than you might initially expect. Because he'll realize he's probably gone in 2024 and want to retire then anyway
Report  for continually lying about this. He’s seen this video 100% proving  condemned them.   and  censor Biden’s political misinformation
Thing is, do you remember the 2016 debate when Trump walked the stage stalking Clinton, looming over her, inches away? Misogyny was celebrated. Trump has some ploy to exploit Biden’s humanity and dignity, and whatever it is, it will be ugly beyond belief.
#harris is what’s wrong with California if you elect Biden and her  your electing a record homeless rate before COVID record unemployment and cost of living through roof because she wants to give your money away to useless projects instead of investing in her state will never win
Biden is a gun owner.
I'm supporting Biden/Harris &amp; every Dem 100%. No distractions. No apologies. I dont care if Joe takes a shit on the stage &amp; Kamala dances in it, I'll cheer. They are perfect. They are golden. I urge every Democrat to make the same commitment. One united message or STFU.
as they should!
Shaun,  People just want you to stick to your convictions. You can vote for Biden, fine, just don't pretend he's good enough and act like we should be satisfied.
Did you hear Biden today Kamila! So disrespectful of  to disrespect her that way. He did it on purpose. See how that works?
Will only be referring to Joe and Jill as “Joe and Dr. Biden” from here on out
Blue no matter who people aren't seeing clearly. Anyone enthusiastic about Kamala isn't seeing her corruption, they need to have their eyes opened.  Biden and Kamala winning will give validation to them in the eyes of these voters, I don't want that to happen.
I love Jo Jorgensen but voting for her right now is just counter productive in my opinion. Trump has to go and unfortunately, Biden is our only real choice.
No I've been resigned to vote for biden for some time now as it is the only option for a sane person
Seems more like he is just telling the truth. Harris did attack Biden in race and you guys all called her a star.
Susan rice said she gonna take it in whatever position black vote Biden wants her to take it.
This came from a Google Search today. If you clicked on it, it took you to a fund raising page for Biden and Harris. It has since been taken down.🙄😂
Obviously Charlie Kirk is an idiot but I think your man bun might be to tight if you think Biden didn’t declare this to the world months ago.

That's a lie and you know it Mr. Biden or maybe a don't know it is you forgot!
That’s a lie. You have taken a quote out of context and twisted it for your use.   Here is a quote that is not out of context: “If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.“ -Joe Biden
Maybe you can teach Joe Biden how to pronounce her name correctly.
Charles Baydelaire, in the depths of absinthe poisoning, could bot write a more horrthing sentence than this headline:
If the only reason to vote Biden is so that Trump doesn’t win, is not good enough for me. I’m tired of giving in to the establishment and corrupt politicians. That’s why this country gets nowhere. Prove to me that Biden is the right choice w/o mentioning Trump.
Kamella is as white or whiter then Biden or the president . That is scary as fuck.  Ok Putin ,!

And some of you think Biden could handle this virus better than Trump. Well look how he handled it back in 2009 with Obama
It’s going to be tough undoing all these stupid and cynical decisions. But I’m certain that somewhere in the Biden camp a Josh or Toby is keeping careful track.
Kamella don’t even got a slang. Joe Biden sounds more black then her . No joke.
Where is Biden’s conference?
Whoever is writing these tweets for creepy Joe Biden needs to STOP LYING you know this is not true LIAR
Joe Biden seems way more Catholic than you are.
Can't wait to hear Biden tell trump 'tear down that wall!'
Why are you supporting a man you accused of being basically a rapist?
That it guarantees victory for Trump. Pence will destroy her in a debate like Trump will destroy Biden.
So is that the hand joe biden illegally finger blasted his staffers with? Just can't help myself...
Anyone tell the Amish who Biden picked?
Um hm  Biden and Harris remember Beau Biden in their first remarks together as running mates
You forgot to add: "Paid for by the Biden-Harris Campaign"
Her script is "I know I'm leftist queen AOC but that doesn't mean I'm not part of Mamala and Daddy Biden's team go blue!!!" then they cut the feed never to mention her againSo does this fall under the domain of the FEC that can't produce a quorum or the DOJ that works for Trump?  This is starting to feel like a bad movie and we're watching it in slow motion. It seems nobody can help us before Jan. 2021 - assuming Biden wins in November.
Kamala blew (no pun intended) a great opportunity here to spin a political yarn about why she and Biden are getting along like champs, by repeatedly bludgeoning Colbert in front of his followers with the word “debate.” Even my most far-left Oregon acquaintances can’t stand her.
Check out Oregon.. they do vote by mail and we have idiots like Biden letting antifa burn the city every night for 80 nights... this is what you get for vote by mail.. it’s true... I live here.. it’s true.
I do this time if I want to avoid a fascist. If you really think Biden is a fascist, you don't know what it is. Read the Anatomy of Fascism. Describes Trump to a tee. Bidens not perfect but he's not a literal fascist. I'm still identifying as a socialist.
Oh yeah. Never heard a peep about how much the republicans disapproved of Obama. Totally silent. 🙄  Also yes if he does win please get him out of office, I hate Biden too
The past? Hasn't Bernie gotten cosessions for the left from Biden now? Not everything, but he has made headway. The left and socialism in general is the most popular it's ever been in this country because people like Bernie and AOC have participated in the system.
Riding the blue tsunami with  Biden
Yeah we do. But your missing the forest for the trees. This is not the election to die on the hill of principles. There is way to much at stake. I wouldn't be voting for Biden if I didn't think our county depended on it.
#Biden needs to stop taking credit for the #PeaceDeal!!!!!

And that's why he's saying this shit. He wants Americans to think he's the one that gave us money. He thinks it will get him votes. He will say, "trump gave you a second check. Biden will turn suburbia into a ghetto" or some equivalent of that. In essence, trying to buy votes.
Biden is an idiot... we all know that.. yet Democrats want to push him in America... another Democrat trick...
So, the National Association of Letter Carriers union endorses Joe Biden.  Watch  and the  will try to break that union.  Mark my words.
Trump is trying to take social security away from Americans. VP Biden will protect Social Security and he will protect us from trump too!! #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
...I thought the manipulation of the media was straightforward. It is using Hannity's words against Trump instead of Biden. Did people think this was actually Sean Hannity criticizing his cash cow?
I'm all for being critical of the candidate. I just don't think not voting for them does what you think it does. Politicians and their party's don't cater to people who don't vote. The only response to a Biden loss would be the DNC going farther right because those people vote.
Pepsi soda company mocked Fox News personality Tucker Carlson on Friday evening.  Carlson is a Prick!  Did I pronounce that right?  Carlson flipped out after a guest attempted 2 teach him how 2 pronounce. Kamala Harris's name, who's running 4 VP on Biden’s ticket.
Liberals, as you can see here and in actual polls across the country, have decided, because it's Biden and Kamala, that they're either voting 3rd Party or straight up for Trump. So....yup. Four more years of Trump. Which sucks but reality sometimes sucks. Or always does.
don’t let the people that have supported you down.  There is so much corruption and I wouldn’t leave my kids alone with Biden.  Please be the change!
Thought the document leak said it was only 2 trips? Either way, fuck Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Trump, Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, McConnell, etc.
You must be falling down drunk. That would describe Trump not Biden. Biden listens to science. Trump listens to that tumor he calls a gut.

Because it takes money to do things? The fuck are you talking about. There's no way you could say that Trump will be better for climate change than Biden. Those are our only two choices.
If Trump is against it Biden will love it.  Trump really needs to hammer away on child porn, trafficking, voter fraud, stomping on kittens, police corruption and brutality and education and employment for blacks.  How could Biden-Harris oppose any of that?
Honestly fuck Kamala Harris for her transphobia and for being a cop but I’ll vote for her and Biden bc it’s way better than 4 more years of Trump
But you are empowered in this democracy. We will demand the new Biden administration take this issue on.
I take Joe Biden's advice about as seriously as a Gas-X commercial.
There are legitimate differences. But people seem to think that Kennedy is some sort of neolib shill that is an enemy to all of our policy priorities. He's not! he's a consponsor of the GND (whilst Markey authored it) and also supports M4A.   literally left of Biden/Harris
*whispers* Kennedy is to the left of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
so you want to nickname Biden - I have so many for you #DonnieDumbass  #MAGAMoron #Spanky #Dotard #Fatass #DontheCon and what your dad called you #Loser
Biden has been against every piece of progressive legislation including Roe v Wade.
I personally could not be more thrilled to have Biden/Harris leading the way out of this horrific morass of Covid/Trump, both of which are destroying our very future.  Hopeful for a more just society with integrated neighborhoods and equal opportunity for all!
So America is really just going to give  and  a pass on their blatant threat against  Saying that "Something is going to happen to Biden within two months and he won't even be on the ballot"? Not even a blip on the radar?
It's not about Biden now. It's about changing the current administration.
Right. Problem is you have had 4 years and you haven’t done shit. So I don’t think you got in you. We are looking for real leadership and Biden/Harris is the ticket!!!!!
As I voted Hillary when I was fairly certain she'd win (after voting for Bernie in the primaries), and it seems foolish to vote for anyone but Biden this year
Man I struggle to heck with this. I really don't like Biden and voting for Hawkins seems like an acceptable alternative, esp in a "blue state", but with them actively trying to suppress the vote &amp; going all in against Oregon it makes me greatly reconsider that, esp after Hillary
I'd sit through a Don Trump Jr book reading to vote for Biden
God forbid, if Trump looses. I believe Biden will not finish his first term and Kamala Harris will be President. It won’t be Camelot! It will be Kamaless!
That's something to add to the mix. Will his COVID-19 malice kill sufficient numbers of minorities &amp; will he do sufficient damage to the postal service between now and November to make up for a flood of unexpected Biden votes from USPS &amp; associated families?
I believe Biden will not finish his first term and Kamala Harris will be President.  It won’t be Camelot! It will be Kamaless!
Biden wins. America is done.
Will it be retroactive to Obama and Biden's terms? There are some Ukrainian prosecutors that want to ask some questions.
NALC National Postal Union, endorses Joe Biden for President.  #GoJoe.  #NALCNational.
Wouldn't it make #Biden an accessor to criminal #Obama and his espionage, trying to frame a #USA  Did Biden know about this. That man is scarred after being associated with a criminal administration YUK VOTE  #USA #AmericaFirst Ethics Transparency  #GOP 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️
You are very mixed up then.  If Biden were elected Kamala will be president and "dear dictator".
Kushner has done great job being interviewed. No way Biden could be the lead. If he is people are really not very smart.
That's why I'm glad Biden didn't pick Rice.  It would've been a disaster. Whew!
A clue? Other than ‘pray the gay away’ Pence is basically a bobbing head. Harris gonna spank that ass just like Biden is going to spank trumps ass.
in the democrat's attempts to be more appealing to righties and moderates theyve become republicans. we can vote republican or right wing. i was truly like "srsly yall we gotta vote biden just so trump stops being actively destructive" but now i see it. fuck everything
The only reason Democrat’s are pushing so hard for mail in voting is because you can’t win without cheating.Everyone knows you Democrat’s are planning on  will be a loser again Hidin’Biden.
8 years of Obama/Biden and 4 years spent impeaching Trump set this up! Oh, and the Wuhan Virus!
2 things:  1) Nancy needs to stop virtue signaling about her religion.  2) She needs to stop using Joe Biden's speech writers.
Absolutely!
Biden Reaffirms His Hatred Of Medicare For All  via
Watching seabuscuit now....  come on Biden / Harris!!  We can do this!
How about calling him, Joe Biden, his given name, like an adult, rather than using a childish nickname at all? Oh...nevermind...we're talking Trump here...childish nickname it is then 😂
Curious. Who was your first choice as a candidate?  (Assume it’s not Biden)
Yep... vote by mail is a Democrat trick... just look at Portland Oregon where they rigged the election for years with mail in  voting and now we have idiots just like Biden making bad decisions for us.
Don't bother watching this with the sound on...I'll quickly recap it for you...Rudy: Biden blah, blah, blah, blah...I married my cousin. Now just watch it, but look at Trump's face instead...😂😂😂😂 it's hilarious!!
Biden Harris 2020-just sit back and take it, America
Was it a comeback, or had the media and body politic been severely underestimating Biden and his campaign strategy from the get-go?
All these crimes are still chargeable when Biden takes office.
Like Joe biden being sane?
Yay!  Another union getting behind President Not Donald Trump!!!  Wahoo!  #SettleForBiden
Please, educate me on the other option we have. I wish Biden wasn't that nom but that's how it turned out. Are you really going to say "yeah this was because of Biden" when Trump's gestapo is beating you up?
Yeah, here's my theory:  Biden is a clone, and his thoughts are disorganized memories and suggestions, which make his life, waking or asleep, equally similar to a constant chaotic dream. He is basically talking in his sleep.  (Love you James)
I think Joe couldn’t care less. He knows that Biden/Kameltoe are just placeholders.
Trump doesn't want vote by mail. Why do you think he would use that to his advantage? Y'all got it twisted.   And why didn't Obama-Biden fix the USPS problems during their 8 years? They had plenty of time.
Some landmark legislation here!
No one is saying any of that. None of this stuff plus the things you said in your other tweet will improve under Trump though. Fuck maybe some of them wont under Biden but they have a better chance. Point is we are falling towards fascism and voting Biden is currently the way out
Just one of many and they will all lead back to Obama and Biden for treason!!!  A win for America
Biden is not competent to be president.
When Biden get elected? NEVER 🤣
actually the big difference is that Biden wouldn't be the first female so he won't be a good excuse to say all women presidents to be bad because she was dumb.
If you think Biden and Harris are far left than you don’t know what “left” is.
So good to see you again! 💙💙💙
Trump’s War On Mail Backfires As Postal Workers Union Endorses Biden -
I can't get over how angry with injustice I have felt for so long over the racist, misogynistic false propaganda campaign against Kamala Harris, and how Joe Biden said, "Fuck that," and chose her as his VP anyway. The man is going to have an amazing legacy.
Hi Deeber! I’ve missed you! 💕💕💕😘
Please follow  💙🤍❤️.  She’s a great follow!
Biden is taking positions on what he sees as binary issues - one way or another... he isn’t creating policies or innovating   No one could be more uninspiring
Can we talk about Bernie’s hypocrisy?  He literally keeps hounding VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN, the architect of mass incarceration whom picked a jailer as his running mate.  The hypocrisy on the left knows no bounds.
My brain could not compute that first line lol Biden Widens Biden Widens, say that 10 times fast
A major US Postal Union supports Biden
Enjoy it while you can. Animals will be banned if Biden gets his way.
And? ...  Never as good as they make us think it will be. I'm waiting for a Clinton, Biden or Obama to be handcuffed and forced to do the walk of shame.
Yeah, get all of the 1% to vote against Biden. LWGAF. We outnumber them 99-to-1
Good for you, Troy!  See you soon! 💕💕💕😘
Get this... Trump said Harris was "disrespectful" to Biden in the debates - even more disrespectful than "Pocahontas".  I don't remember Kamala Harris using insults like "Pocahontas" toward anyone.  Trump's blatant hypocrisy is almost evil genius.
He's like an incompetent, walking, talking, slurring campaign ad FOR Biden/Harris.
I didn't vote for him the first time either genius. No it's not shaming people to point out the reality that it's either Biden or Trump. Conservatives what nothing more than for you to not vote or vote third party.
Donald needs to fire the postmaster general he appointed and told to slow the mail. Donald says he is confident he will beat Biden. Why make it so people can’t vote??
The largest impact will be voting Biden/Harris. Everyone uniting on that one will get Trump out of office and give you 4 years to look at third party or 4-8 years to repair the GOP from Trumpism.
Let's talk about ENTHUSIASM. Kamala Harris has helped Joe Biden and the Dems raise $46,000,000 in donations in less than 72 hours. THAT'S REAL ENTHUSIASM!
The National Association of Letter Carriers, which represents 300,000 current and retired workers, said that Trump has long been hostile to the Post Office.
"When I argued we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well! I meant Medicare &amp; Medicaid, I meant veterans’ benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government!" -Joe Biden
"Back in change" Biden
Corgis would never support Joe Biden. They are devout believers of survivors.
I am voting for Biden- Harris because I want our President and his/her Administration to have integrity and to be honest. I want our Nation to work with world partners on global issues instead of against them. I want a team that works for all citizens instead of their base.
Robert, a U.S. Navy veteran, is voting for Biden because he feels Trump ...  via
I live in Liberalville Eugene, OR and I've not seen one Biden sign. But, then again I've seen no Trump signs either. This state needs to go RED!
Corrupt poll meant to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Biden hasn't done anything to earn those numbers.  Voters are slaves to the 2-party system.
Haha who is this "Mao would have endorsed Biden - if you disagree you must not have read enough Marx." Didn't Mao straight up kill the bourgeoisie? Seems a far cry from Biden
"I love having little kids on my lap." Joe Biden 2019
Exactly. We love Joe Biden Republicans!
I may not like your behavior much but I can’t stand Biden and his running mate has different ideals than I and I feel like they are using BLM  and promise of big stimulus $’s to get votes I my vote can’t be bought Trump is getting my vote!  Yes Go Trump!
Hallelujah, a person with enough self esteem to put his foot down.   #ifeelsafe
Trump thought Biden would pick Karen Bass for the most Trumpian of reasons. Per  he thought Biden would prefer someone with a "low national profile and one who wouldn’t outshine him."  Wonder how Pence feels about that.
Awe!  Thanks, Rod!  Now I feel better!
There’s the Jenn I know and love! 🤣🤣🤣
Vote for Biden, anyway! You'll like yourself better on January 20 if you do! #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Hahahaha Biden CANNOT AND DOES NOT SPEAK IN COMPLETE SENTENCES! Only a Progressive Liberal DemocRAT could believe this LIE!
if you vote for Biden you are a pedophile.  Yes I said it. LOL
Whoops!  Maybe I just should have said, thanks for the shout out.... 🤷🏻‍♀️
July 8 (he said this five times that day) - “It is a disgrace that nothing happens. Obama and Biden spied on my campaign, AND GOT CAUGHT...BUT NOTHING!”  Just no. Ever. Nothing about that is true.
What the heck?!  No hearts for me??!!!  Where’s my love, Rod?!  🤣🤣🤣💙🤍❤️
Lifelong Republican: I'm voting Biden because I'm disgusted. Welcome!  The water is warm!
Oh, but we still can't go to work or church and our kids can't go to school in Sept. Wait for it-THEN he'll say only Registered Democrat voting for Biden Harris can physically go to polling places...🙄
Yep, and they support Clown Biden...
That’s so ironic you would say that! Trump is waaaaaayyy right of Bush, Bush, &amp; Reagan! Biden is a moderate, no hard left turn at all! Besides, Trump is incredibly corrupt.
No, it isn't, because no one willing to vote third party in a swing state is gonna vote for a Democrat like Gore, Clinton, or Biden.  If no third party candidate ran, people just wouldn't vote.  The problem is Democrats nominate terrible candidates, not that a third party exists.
Fair criticism.  Biden has plenty of blood on his hands.  I despise the DNC.  But you get more flies with honey than vinegar.  Work to educate instead of alienate.  Not everyone has moved as far left as some of us yet, but they’ll get there!
"They (Obama &amp; Biden) were illegally spying on my campaign. And it's a very grave crime. It's the biggest political crime in the history of our country.”  Yup. This again. He's said it a lot. And it's false. Categorically false.
Where is the outcry by Republican leaders? I thought they promoted democracy - doesn't that mean people have to vote?
As POTUS biden will not be allowed to hide in a Delaware basement for 4 years. He will resign before 6 months into his term ... Making Harris POTUS
Smartly using dispicable laws by those in washingtondc (like biden and harris) that created laws that allow companies to file bankruptcy.
Oh she is one thousandth in support of Joe Biden? 🤮🤮🤮

#donottrustpolls I'm white; no college; Biden is fine with me
Vote Biden anyway!!! If you care about this Country!!!
Not an insult, genuinely, if you want Biden to win you should phonebank for him. Few are volunteering for him so he needs your help I guess. Trying to vote shame communists is a waste of time, but you might convince people that love the police state and war.
What is “scary” is his excuse that it was ok when Obama/Biden  did it for  a recession.🤔🤯
Well! they are really good at framing and threatening people. They don’t mind breaking the law if it gets them what they want. 30330 Build Back Better Biden/Harris/Democrats/Rino’s Global NWO puppets only accomplishment is brainwashing.
True enough. If T&amp;P are reelected the America that we all knew will be gone. It will most likely take the entirety of the next 4 years (or more) for Biden and Harris to repair the damage done.  Vote T&amp;P OUT OF OFFICE!
I’m waiting for AG Barr’s “developments”. Something tells me Biden will be our and the democratic ticket will implode
Trump is a teetotaler &amp; has been for decades. Joe Biden was dubbed Jekyll &amp; Hyde by Secret Service agents because after drinking, he couldn't be within a few feet of children.
Yes, and how would Biden handle this crisis? There would have been 3x as many deaths!
Kamala is lying. If you thought to research everything Biden and Kamala are claiming, you will see a basket full of lies.
Just a WILD guess here...from a BIDEN voter.........
If “Biden” is gung-ho about mandating masks, you can be sure he will mandate the vaccine as well. You know....the super rushed - no safety studies - BS placebo - aborted fetal cell containing one.
I don't want another 4 years of Trump. So I'm voting for Biden. I'm not going to shame people for not voting for him. But those who say they can't have to also acknowledge that they are only helping reelect Trump. That's only going to push our country farther right

Just like you did with Biden's victims, Just like you did with Bill Clinton's victims right?
Biden isnt mentally competent to sign his own name, agree to medical procedures etc.,  let alone sue someone.
How much did unexciting Biden raise in the 24 hours after he announced his VP? I’m sorry that you’ve learned that ugly, bitter white men are not the base of the party.
Vote for biden... our country is literally under attack by Trump..
I'm a left leaning floating voter. I'm not going to vote for Biden. He's too useless.
Ask ourselves: “what can I do?” Don’t wait for someone to save us. Call and write your representatives, get on the Biden/Harris phone banks. Send Vote postcards to swing states, be an influencer, talk solutions to friends and neighbors.Donate if you can.
Waiting for the AR’s for Biden Masks exchanges.  The destruction of the 1st amendment will happen first. Its already happening.
Thanks, Baby G! 💕💕💕😘
If the onion regrets past coverage making Biden seem like a harmless kooky character, I wonder if they’ll have occasion to regret downplaying this.
In a sign of raw feelings, Biden’s aides said they were happy to have him on board in 2020.  Did you proofread this before hitting publish? Or does “happy to have him” mean hurt feelings in your part of the world?
I guess we agree that he is not Joe Biden, lol. We can all come together on some things!
How do spell phony? Biden!!!
You're right.  Why are the words "RAPIST" and "SEXUAL PREDATOR" not in every tweet and every broadcast?  If it was Biden - you KNOW what the GOP would do....
This is how Biden could win
I think only a very small % of lifelong and blindly loyal democrats are "enthusiastic" about Biden.  The enthusiasm is entirely Anti-Trump.  Biden is Vanilla yogurt.
If you think Biden and Harris have a chance you don’t realize why Trump was elected first time around

This really is making Biden not look good. It's almost like proving he really is mentally deteriorating. If for some reason debates dont take place with him being the one on the stage... then we need to really step up questioning his mental capacity to actually be president.

Vote for Biden/Harris is a vote to usher in socialism! America will soon be unrecognizable! They will shredd our constitution! The President did a great job handling covid Built ventilators  Built fab hospital  Task force  Best scientific medical team in the world Stopped travel

I would much rather be slightly disappointed in Biden’s leadship than feel the daily anger and disgust I currently experience daily.  Vote for Biden.
why are liberals so personally aggrieved with socialists that won't vote biden. like, if he needed my vote, he could campaign for it. Why don't they go yell at republicans for their vote, that's his target demo
are you phonebanking for biden yet
He didn't "support" it. He WROTE it. And he says a lot of shit he doesn't mean. His "regret" is meaningless. Biden has stood against every piece of progressive legislation in his entire career from bussing to Roe v Wade to gay marriage and now universal healthcare.
Joe Biden has always been racist.
Then start telling people to hand deliver those ballots to an election office.  Once Biden becomes president the USPS will get the help it needs. And your post master may go to jail for interfering with a federal election.  Truth Matters

WOW. You give me a whole lot of power that I wish I had something to do with. A vote for the Green Party is a vote AGAINST TRUMP AND AGAINST BIDEN. You like the way things are? "Nothing will fundamentally change" (Biden, J., 2020). My vote, my right and my power.

The Harris-Biden ticket doesn’t seem to know that the Iran deal was no such thing as a “deal.”    It was a giant giveaway disguised as a “deal.” Obama/Kerry ingratiating themselves to the hostile state of Iran.  Now they want to go back to it as if it had any U.S. value at all.
remember, you aint black if you dont vote for joe biden....remember, black ppl arent as smart as latinos(according to joe)..
if your candidate's only strong point is that they aren't Trump, you aren't going to win over people who never liked biden and worry he could actually be worse. you should be phone banking and calling republicans.

Could be funny but if one percent of the blacks vote for him And cost Biden the election I may never smile again.
so, trump's using biden as literally that vice president so dumb, to elect him is literally suicide by comparison to another for years of economic growth. the fear of biden has led to world peace, that's fine. zombie joe's a hero.
Biden practices Catholicism as a path for his faith and relationship with God. Barr has practiced extremist Catholicism as a form of power and control. Pompeo is an evangelical “Christian” with rigid views that his beliefs should be everyone’s beliefs. I relate to Biden.
Biden and Lamaze are the problems of America they gotta go
Since Biden said, he was going to bring Fauci back if he wins....then Biden should have no problem with voting in person, now that Fauci has deemed it safe.

It may be a cheap ploy to get Biden to focus on NY and not the swing states.
Projection projection, that's your dejection. Biden is not president. This failure, is all on tRump and entire GOP!
Go for my guns biden youll never fuckin find.america is still the wild west and you fuckin idiots DONT LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD.get that you are not only stupid but again the BAD GUYS GET THE ADVANTAGE ON COPS AND INNOCENT FAMILYS AND THEY WILL GET GUNS FUCK YOU JOE
Obama and Biden couldn't run a successful lemonade stand. Very small bratty boys indeed.
when Biden and Kamala lose they are gonna blame Bernie just like Hillary did, and it'll probably work
I mean I’m not even thrilled with Biden but... yeah
51 years of lies, doing nothing, creepibg sniffing habits and he loves little girls. True story. Believe it or not, but a vote for Biden, is a vote for PEDOPHILA. Figure it out
Honestly I see it as a virtue signal pick but I’m just more concerned about not letting trump completely sell out and destroy our country. Biden could’ve picked anyone and I’m still voting Blue because what other choice is there?
Biden-Harris need mask mandate to hide there lying face
well, that's fitting considering this is a simulacra of the gipper &amp; hw. she's their george hw bush, there to create a 30+ year dynasty of government control on the oldman's back. biden's said this.
The America as I knew it disappeared January 20, 2016.  We will get it back if we are Riden with Biden.
Fauci says there’s no reason you can’t vote in person! It can be done safely! So that leaves only one reason for the left insisting on mail in ballots! It’s to allow fraudulent votes to be counted! Trump supporters will demand a recount a investigation if Biden wins !
I’m not a fan of Biden/Harris but I think it’s unwise to block someone for liking a tweet from someone else who you don’t agree with.  Soon you find yourself on an island all alone.  We need to build a left coalition not tear it down.  Just my opinion.  FYI I voted green in 2016
Add Biden and Harris to your list
I have a friend who wasn't sure if she was voting for Biden. She says she will now because of his VP pick. Its truly upsetting how much people hate Trump. Think for yourselves people.
Not only are states setting nursing home standards...Democrats mocked Trump's early safety measures.... Biden Campaign Releases Gross Ad Blaming Trump for Death of 90-Year-Old Woman Who Caught COVID-19 in Nursing Home  via
This is exactly it, Noel. I can't stand either, but I also refuse to put my "both sides-ism" over the "we have an obvious, treasonous traitor in the white house, and all the other checks and balances have failed."  Trump has to go...the ONLY way that happens this year is Biden.
The question is  ....why do Democrats break norms with impunity? After Obama/Biden committed treason weaponizing agencies to spy on his campaign you look the other way. This is nothing in comparison.
A must read from the Toledo Blade on why Kamala Harris is an underwhelming VP pick: Why Biden blew it  via The Blade #KAG2020 #BuckeyeBattalion
Didn’t they just nominate Kamal Harris for VP.  Thought that was that was the tipping point and the election was in the bag.  Maybe she is really not happy with Biden’s National mask mandate.
Biden/Harris fail to realizes they have no authority to implement a nation wide implementation of masks.
No. Joe Biden is quite a conservative Democrat and Kamala Harris is a former prosecutor who has worked with law enforcement. It will be a pleasant change after living with the Hitler wannabe in the WH for 4 years.
Does this sound like somebody who is confident that Biden is going to win the election?
If by chance Biden wins, how soon will #KamalaMalaDingDong be President? #VoteRed #Vote #4MoreYears #Trump2020 #Heelsup #JBBJ2020
Delusional Trump Says He Will Beat Joe Biden In New York -
Marxist’s and Anarchists overwhelmingly do not support Biden/Harris or the Democratic Party.  That’s Fox News propaganda.  A small minority do, mainly due to their dislike ofTrump, but most don’t.
Is she laughing about Biden’s sexual abuse or his horrible voting record in Congress ? Maybe his examination of Anita Hill? Maybe he smelled her hair, and she thought it was funny.
You realize all the polls I am telling them I am voting for Biden.   Works both ways John
Harris is a 'moderate,' Trump praised neo-Nazis, and other untruths.  #Kamala #JoeBiden #DonaldTrump
Hiden Biden and Heels Up Harris... What a pair to draw to... Ask yourself... is this really the type of people you want you children and grandchildren looking up to???...I think NOT...
NPR: Poll: Biden Expands Lead, A Third Of Country Says It Won't Get Vaccinated.   via
Trump, corrupt Tin Pot Despot coming from the party of extremists, failed Covid response, plunged us into economic disaster, killed 165k Americans, ruined the mail to try to keep Americans from voting, and his mind is practically gone. He's the best ad FOR voting Biden/Harris!
You should quit now Kamala. You are an embarrassment and a sellout just like Biden
Ronald Reagan warned us against Biden
The debate over masks has moved to the presidential race.
All those accounts are FAKE, using bots to appear as if fans are pissed, blame  for liberal resistance/corruption, then directs them to vote Biden/Harris. 😂They’re not even sports fans. ALSO EVERYONE knows Ohio was infiltrated by commies! #EpsteinOhio #CommieOhio
Well, this is BETTER anyway! I’m not one of the bed-wetters but there WAS a slew of new polls that were like Biden +8. Which is too close!
Kamala Harris was selected by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to serve as his running mate.
- 🤮🤮 disgusting
Hell kamala used racism as a weapon against biden in the nominee debates. Now she says "oh that was just politics" .... calling someone racist isnt just politics. They smear trump constantly calling him a racist even though he hasnt done anything racist in gact the opposite.
We are long overdue for a woman in the White House. The fact that Kamala is a Black woman is just icing on the cake! America is ready! "I'm ridin' with Biden!"
Funny you mention deflection but also won’t give an honest answer to my simple question.  Has and do some Biden’s/Harris’ past actions have racist implications. Yes. Have they done anything racist publicly in the last 48hrs? NO. Can’t say that for Trump and his Birtherism 2.0
There's a small visual bug on the forecast comparisons. In cartogram mode, for all forecasts other than JHK, 538, CNalysis, Lean Tossup, &amp; Plural Vote, the mouseover popup on states always shows Biden's portrait regardless of the projection
Is anyone else out there SICK &amp; TIRED of the Dems being polite or "taking the high road"?Anyone else WANT to see the gloves come off &amp; Biden/reporter/etc get just as nasty &amp; mean (or meaner) w/Trump? I honestly think we the people are so fucking fed up,that we CRAVE retribution.
Unfortunate. But one step at a time, for now. First, let's get rid of Trump &amp; his cabal, a clear and present danger to our country. Biden/Harris is a step in the right direction. Actually, more like stomping on the brakes at cliff's edge. Much work to do ahead.
Let's talk about Putin paying bounty's for US Soldier kills GONald Jr!  Biden's concern was for the US soldiers safety! You see, tough guy, unlike the drugged lions you shoot, Osama bin Laden's guards had guns.
I'm not entirely crazy about Biden, either (Bernie guy here and I detest Trump) but I'll vote for him if it means Trump and his cabal will be ejected. Biden's a least a step toward the right direction. More like stopping at the edge of the cliff, really.
What would be higher, taxes under Biden or the national debt under trump? You already know the answer. You've blown the debt through the roof. You're a failure.
She passed the Biden sniff test! What else is there to know?
Either third party candidate is better than Joe Biden.
Do you guys really think Biden even stands a chance? If you’re going to vote for a losing party might as well vote for a non-pedo🤷🏻‍♂️
CNN and MSNBC are already messaging to their viewers. But they won’t be able to keep up with other Countries and blue check marks from the left saying this is good. Even Biden is trying to take credit for it, which tells you it’s a great deal.
Nah. This was likely mostly leftists. People don't like Biden, and they apparently FUCKING HATE Harris. It's the world we live in. And well, we survived four years of Trump. Why not four more?
The market is being falsely propped up by sub zero interest rates &amp; corporate hand outs! I fear Trump and his cronies will short the market then help it crash after Biden wins! They get one more big cash haul &amp; make the start of the Biden era look bad to boot. To rich to pass up!
Love you Jill and Joe Biden! I love Kamala and we are going to kick trump's ass out! Please do extensive fumigation before you move in 🤔  I'm so excited, can we just fast forward to November 3rd?  🇺🇲🇺🇲❤❤🇺🇲🇺🇲 SOS
Biden lies so much his real name is Carl. So does his EVIL running mate. She lies constantly. But go ahead &amp; watch the news repeater. Not reporter no typo, repeater. MSM doesn't report the news, they repeat whatever their LEFTIST masters say.
if you want Biden to win, call republicans.
ok scara. Biden put a medal on GWB and Cheney is saying nice things about him. It will be cold comfort when a competent administration can more effectively get boots on the ground in VZ and I can say I told you so. But at least it won't be a republican doing it.
I literally can not stand white liberals who tell me to turn a blind eye to Biden/Harris I'm gonna critique them equally &amp; still vote for them
Biden has his plan. he's going to get wallstreet to buy the election for him and nothing will change. The DNC is actively courting conservatives not entirely owned by Fox News, and even discouraging the left and the PNAC/B team people will have a new shot at Iran.
I truly believe that Republicans got sucked into the vortex of the Trump Tyranny. Do what’s right in the privacy of the voting booth. Vote for Biden to  bring about the change we need. Then work together to rebuild the Republican Party and restore your dignity.
I agree with other Trump policies &amp; believe everyone lies, including Biden  So I will proudly vote for the guy who thinks China is America’s biggest threat. China is extremely dangerous, militarily &amp; obviously to the actual health of our people &amp; economy
I’m guessing Biden will step down before then and there will be overwhelming pressure by the DNC to run Harris as the candidate unopposed. Unity to stop the Carlson/Cheney ticket.
Always know a fraud when they have to bring in their dead son to get people to like her. Dems are good about injecting things that you can’t argue. But there, I said it. Anything for a win. 🤦‍♀️ #Biden
Does Biden have dementia? Hell yes we're ready!
Trump putting minorities into prison camps: I sleep Joe Biden wanting people to wear masks: GUYZ ITS JUST LIKE THE HOLOCAUST!!!
I believe the backlash is deserved, I know you don’t but I do. But when u have  on Fox News saying I believe something bad is going to happen to Biden to make it so he won’t be on the ballot and   racism about a month ago Fox News lost a ton of respect
I dont want to see Biden - Trump debate. I want to see Harris - Trump debate... and Trump crying before a STRONG woman
Jill Biden’s Ex-Husband Exposes Joe’s Adulterous Affair, Lies, And Campaign Bribery

😅😂🤣 Biden train to nowhere! Gotta get him out of the basement first! Does he even know he has a train? Does he know where it's headed? I do! Back to the basement, round trip!
Well, liberals.....this sucks. Thought we were better than that. Black lives apparently don't matter, and the lives of those who depend on healthcare, like this show's co-host Susan, who has diabetes, are apparently also expendable because you just can't with Biden.
82% of Rudy W. Ghouliani would see his chances of jail time go up under the Joe Biden admin.
Be happy to vote for Biden on November 3rd, then be pissed from January 2021-2024
You can’t be fucking serious right now. I mean your heads have to be so far up your asses to post bullshit like this. Are you just going to start parroting Biden? Is that your strategy? You gonna day that he’s golfed over 365 ducking times while in office?
Democrats have said, as clearly as they possibly can, that they don't respect the left,   they don't need the left and they don't want the left. Great, message received. Go make calls, raise money, push Biden/Harris around. It's not our problem any more.
Biden just announced he wants a national mask mandate.... who is the first leftist to call him a fascist dictator? No no one? Hmm doesn’t get more dictator then that....
Bet you won’t see anything like this for Biden .
Joe Biden  would answer that probably like this come on man I can run it from the bunker at the white house like I do my campaign from my basement.   Lol.  I know that the left will probably pull this but that is how I feel he would answer
Hey, I'm a Boomer too and could not be more furious and disgusted with the GOP. I'd stand in line for days to vote for Biden, but I live in Oregon where we all vote by mail all the time, so I don't have to. Also, this is not a Boomer issue. Plenty of younger folks voting GOP.
He's 78 years old. He doesn't have much of a career left. Tops, maybe 10 years.  1. He signed a thing saying he would support the winner. 2. Donald Trump is way worse than Biden. Biden, while stupid and somewhat racist, isn't going to destroy America like Donald Trump wants to.
To all the progressives who say they won't vote for a Biden Harris ticket, you must. We can't lose another election to Donald Trump. There will be no progress in this country  with another 4 years of Trump. Fucking #VOTE
She endorsed Biden along with her family the first week he got in. She endorsed him every single day on the View to sway viewers once he got in and trashed Biden’s competition. She has more than influenced Dem Primary. I had to stop watching her for a year.
Your President still has kids in cages on the border, is destroying the USPS, and was the 1st President impeached in his 1st term.   But please do go on about how extreme Biden is.
As he should have. How disgusting that you won’t even call out how disrespectful this is. But I’m sure you will be reporting on how disgusted you are if anyone dares to require Biden and Harris to even answer 1 question from the press.
Who knows maybe theirs won’t be counted or even delivered! It would be much safer during the pandemic to vote in person! Maybe they will be fraudulent, the First Lady might take trumps ballot and vote for Biden!
Poverty increased by 18% under Obama/Biden, food stamps by 36%, and millions left the labor force unable to find work. In less than 3 years Trump turned all that around. You don’t seem to care about average Americans! Typical Democrat!
She’s calling him president Biden already this don’t look right at all
...but some of us are on the same page and know exactly  what you mean!  A Biden win in Nov ratchets that grifting psycho to dangerous levels through January. Our neutered Senate clearly won't do a thing , either.
You really think Biden will still be alive in 2024 to try to be president after he loses this year?
Lol no she can't.   Biden is going to lose
I got called by a pollster and they didn’t care about my opinion on Joe Biden since I’m not in a swing state BUT they did ask me about defunding the police 😏
Joe Biden just can't remember.  Would someone please tell Joe Biden? Be sure and write it down for him so he can read it out loud next speach.
Just more proof that Joe Biden isn't thinking clearly. Does he think the 100s of thousands of NEW gun buyers bought them to return to the government after he's elected? They're buying them to protect themselves in case he IS elected.
Bet she votes for Biden
Well, that says a lot.  Trump's crap, MADE IN China, Biden's crap MADE In USA.  I chose made in America.
Ok, say Democrat’s do admit racist policies from Biden and Harris because there is a lot to claim that off of a true with both of them. Can you not admit Trump  has said &amp; done racist things as well??????
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
and THIS is why i won't be anything but enthusiastic voting for Biden/Harris!  Y'all acting like if it's not bernie/aoc you can't vote for Dems &amp; it's trash ass attitudes like that that will fuck a supreme court for generations  Grow the fuck up😤

Hey, gop account. I think you have been hacked cause this tweet has Biden’s name where tRumps should be. You do know that Biden has ant the president, right?? This tweet is blaming Biden for what tRump has screwed up. Weird.
Your argument is invalid.  Trump and his NeoRepublican enablers step of the constitution, time and time again.  Trump has the intelligence of misbehaving toddler, while Biden is a million times more adult intelligence.
NOT forcing mt own personal diet down anyone's throat and not saying Biden and Harris are going to ACTUALLY reduce the amount of meat people can get.... but....  Would NOT hoovering down four pounds of meat a week be so bad?
How is it even possible to be this removed from reality  These people are worse than useless. This kind of "leftist" is a useful idiot who enables authoritarians like Trump by attacking Biden. They hate liberals more than fascists, and all because of pointless petty grievances.
It's not the truth. No way Biden can be ahead unless they only asked democrats to take the poll.
The White House conspiring and colluding with a mentally I'll man to rig the election in an attempt to draw voters away from Biden.
I'm buying some income property tomorrow. I am depending on you to make sure  is our next president. Please. I need to retire someday. Biden will just put me in the poor house.
I'm here for b(o)(o)bs out for Biden, what time is the Presser?  😉  You go girl, some people are just jelly.
Joe Biden wants us to wear masks till after the election 😂😂😂. Democrats are so predictable. #ElectionInfection
More Middle East wars if Biden is elected.
the bare naked face of Communism. credit score within the first six months of biden/obama regime.
But you can't admit Biden is better, or it would go against your bogus narrative and hurt your fee fees. So you fight a petty, pointless battle that only helps people who literally want you dead.
I think Trump is literally trying to rig an election by sabotaging the post office and mail in voting during a pandemic that he caused, and leftists who insist Biden is just as bad are enabling a president who's rapidly plunging the country into authoritarianism
As weird as i think it is that the Bernie cult has rallied around a guy with a virtually identical voting record as Joe Biden, it’s pretty fucking weird that there are other folks rallying behind the weirdly conservative on strange issues Kennedy child with few accomplishments.
Never, but no one actually expects leadership from Biden during a Biden presidency let alone cognizance from the man. CNN has already let on to what we all suspect which the expectation of him stepping down to allow the VP to take the reigns. The Democratic ticket is Harris/Biden
So happy to learn that you joined the Biden Harris campaign.  I enjoy watching you on the PBS Newshour giving us your thoughtful explanations.
So obnoxious. I was listening to a politics podcast “Hacks on Tap” and they discussed how Biden couldn’t pick a mayor as VP because people need to feel the person can step in as POTUS day 1. Made me think about Pete - why was taken seriously for POTUS is beyond me
Hey man.  You should ask Biden and Harris is they are planning to prosecute Trump if they win the election.
Re: Biden ad asking Kamala. Jilly?Dougy? I threw up in my mouth.
He should You and democrats had absolutely NOTHING to do with it.. Obama &amp; Biden need to stop SIDLING up to attempt to take credit for EVERYTHING President Trump accomplishes...SICK OF IT.
I agree the travel ban was the right move. I think he’s turned away some of the more educated republicans though by trashing on fauci and the cdc so much. I honestly couldn’t guess who will win, I’m not confident for Biden though.
Off the top of  my head Bernie voted for the crime bill that Bernie supporters call Biden a racist for supporting, and he was more than happy to support military funding as long as some of the money went to local businesses.
If you have a Veteran in the family or among friends, the more allies of 'BoneSpur' tRump kept out of Congress, the sooner a new Biden Administration can work with Congress to pass medically sound actions to save American lives, including Veterans, especially older Veterans.
Didn't Joe Biden rape women, and didn't Kamala Harris believe them?
What hogwash. Joe Biden is a practicing Roman Catholic. Trump has violated at least 5 of the Ten Commandments: adultery, bearing false witness, coveting, stealing (from his own charity), taking the Lord’s name in vain.
and trump made no money? Biden is rich? are you nuts?
So on Monday, I noticed the James “Kamala” Harris wrestler died, out of the blue, on Monday August 10.  Every blue check account was mockingbird-tweeting the  announcement.  Next day, Tuesday Aug 11, Kamala Harris is announced as Biden’s VP running mate. Not a coincidence...
America did just fine before tRump (it actually did much, much better), America will survive the "CARNAGE" that is tRump &amp; his disastrous administration, and America will regain some self-respect, as well as the world's, under a Biden/Harris presidency. VOTE &amp; REPLACE THE CLOWN!
Joe Biden - "Don't sniff her hair, don't sniff her hair, don't sniff her hair ..."  Kamala - "he's gonna sniff my fucking hair isn't he ..."
Dammit! I was going to write in her brother-in-law (Tony West) for precinct committeeman.  That’s now out the window!  Thank God Biden didn’t select HIM as his VP.
Harris-Biden 2020 all the way!!! #HarrisBiden2020

Biden will be creamed. That's why.
Honestly, I feel like I’m going to get dragged for this, but I voted for Hillary in 2016 and I’m (probably) going to write in Mark Charles this time. I live in Oregon so I feel like I can get away with this. But as a survivor of child sexual abuse I can. not. vote for Biden.
You really have no place to say black lives matter to you if you're supporting Biden, one of the main authors of the crime bill that set up everything we are protesting against.
Stepping stones further right. Biden has stood against every piece of progressive legislation in his entire career from bussing to Roe v Wade to gay marriage and now universal healthcare. He is a a main author of the crime bill that set up everything we are protesting against...
Biden won't have the support of 90+% of Bernie supporters like the Hildabeast did though.
'I'm disgusted with Trump': Arizona Republican explains why he's voting for Biden

What a joke. Lyin Biden with his mofo ho.
She is a socialist that will work for her own devices, and this is the best that Biden (does he know how to spell his name?  Or know where he is?) Could do... if Dems win I'll give it 2 months till they take him out for not being able to handle it, if they win which is unlikely..
There’s hope for Biden yet!
If Biden can do his in his own backyard.....so can a Trump.🙌🏼🙌🏼. Save $$
I say fuk you Biden. Never going to happen.
“Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum — every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing.”
Any questions for Biden today? I’m curious about the Biden/Harris Campaign - who’s going to debate, Joe or Kamala?
Not gonna let Joe Biden and KaMAHla Harris take you meat.
Let’s be honest here, Biden gets most things backwards &amp; just plain wrong.
Mandating the country is a joke. State rights only, don’t let feds cover for states who are political about it. I’m sitting in my smaller community with no CV. And Biden Harris want me to wear a mask. 🤬
Well, at least it's not like Joe Biden ignored warnings about COVID and went to a rally maskless or anything. Because that would be very, very stupid and fatal.
Your family need not worry about Biden. Their immediate concern should be about you and how you blatantly lie for Trump. THAT is their biggest threat.
This is my crazy conspiracy theory but ....  I think media companies (like Newsweek) really like Trump, his craziness keeps them in the red  So, Im wary of stories media companies push to discredit Biden/Harris to pave the way for a horrible second term of Trump
Is this real?! Seriously, what is wrong with you if you vote for this guy along with the Orange weirdo? Do people that eat red meat think it’s being threatened by Biden/Harris? Is this the new, “Obama’s gonna take your guns”?
Wonder what Biden's answer to that question would've been.  Better yet:  "Mr. Biden, have you stopped inappropriately touching children?"  The President was smart not to answer the loaded question--either way it's an admission.  Nice try lefty reporter.

I hate that aspect to politics. I fully support Biden/Harris but the way AK was thrown under the bus and not defended by Joe or KH has not gone unnoticed. Not to mention the spreading of misinfo by some progressive “activists” have left a bad taste for me.
You’re damn right we do; especially my 98 year old mom who will be voting for Biden/Harris!
We should elect a politician to the job. Someone like Joe Biden who has been in politics 50 years now. Name one positive accomplishment. Trump was elected because of Barry and Joe. Their incompetence led to Trump’s election. That and Hillary, worst candidate EVER.

Already a dictator. A very stupid idea to wear a mask alone walking down the street. Biden, think before you demand ridiculous commands.
I think “Hidin Biden” is a great name for President Trump to use... And maybe “Heals Up Harris” for Kamala... Anyone agree???..,

Ya know one thing you can say for Biden, and it hurts to say anything for the guy, but at least he puts out real campaign ads and doesn’t act like a child
Oregon votes by Mail only.    But we have drop off locations.  Removing mail boxes would make no difference to Donald. No DIFFERENCE.   Biden will still when the state with ease.

As far as I'm concerned, if political strategies were paintings. Biden's would be a van Gogh and Trump's would be a Jackson Pollock.
Ya'll realize Trump is Walder Frey right? Not Biden?   Biden is like, idk, Robb Stark? I have no idea
Trump Just Fell Straight Into Joe Biden’s Trap On Masks -
This is for those who insist Trump was close friends with Epstein. Trump has been a teetotaler for decades. Epstein had drinking problems. Biden &amp; his brother have property on Water Island which is close to Epstein island. "Watch the water"
The Biden campayne must make a deal with these carriers.  Flat rate for ballots where legal $5.  Some states you MUST mail them.  No drop offs etc.
One key difference is that if the Republicans ran such an ad highlighting Sen. Harris as "one heartbeat away" it would solidify Biden's lead.
I’ve been consistently wearing a mask...but Today, after seeing VP Biden speak, a joyous Message/PHRASE ran thru my head as I crossed the parking lot outside of the BiMart store in LaPine Oregon. The message was “I’m a Patriot”!!   THANK YOU JOE BIDEN! #BidenHarris2020. #MAGA
Nah this about tapioca brained biden and his inability to be cognitive nor realize he's off his rocker.
Actually let them destroy it. It will hurt all the rural voting areas. We already know cities will come out in full force.. but that aging rural base will not come out because of Covid, they rely on mail. He’s shooting himself in the foot! Than reastablish mail after Biden’s in😁
Oddly enough, so will President Biden and Vice President Harris, who will also stand with protestors, and victims of brutality, and the mentally ill, and the domestically abused, and the homeless, and the poor.  See, we’re not selective except for fascists, fascists, sexists...
Neither am I, just spamming like you have been doing. I’m voting for Biden but that doesn’t mean I have to like Cuomo.
I agree... and they've added "slow Joe"... But, in any contest of the mind... Biden beats Tramp every time.

You just said if everyone votes for Biden he will still lose. It shows you have zero understanding of the electoral college
Trump had this country boomin. Did things biden talkn bout. Why Obama and biden ain't do nothing for 8 years when they had the chance? Typical liberal. Talk smack, call names, no facts. Lol. Byron lol

"But we like THOSE Republicans" "If only you whiny leftists would start donating to and making calls for Biden/Harris you'd be too busy to argue with us" Lefties "We will NEVER be too busy to argue with you, make your own damn calls"
If Biden loses, there will be a lot of vulnerable and marginalized people justifiably terrified for there lives and livelihoods in the face of four more years of Trump.  Consider them before you start laughing.
Did you listen? Even media said the same.  Biden responded after receiving a briefing on COVID...and said the same things as a Trump has already done....🙄
If Biden is elected POTUS ... We might as well roll up the carpet and close the doors! America is over!

And the media would definitely be more gentle with Biden than they are with  Truth is that Biden just CAN’T go off script... he’s not capable.
WHY is this the headline, when it is NOT what Biden said?
I guess Biden is a “nonessential” worker.

Maybe it is a plot to make Harris president and Biden is just doing his part to make sure that happens. I would not put anything past Dems.

Well since I am a women and I find her treatment Biden, Kavanaugh, and Catholics in general quite nasty,  bitchy &amp;snarky I guess we have to agree to disagree.  When Trump says something about her that is truly sexist i will be first in line to call him out, but this isn’t it.
The world is already laughing because you are a joke.  Biden has to fix everything you screwed up. You can’t run a business and have failed at that. You have proved you can’t run a country.  Stop saying stupid things

Not that many are on the fence, but EVERYONE’s parents needs to know this distinction between Trump &amp; the GOP vs Biden &amp; the Dems.  False attack ads on Biden cutting SS benefits (not true) are targeted at senior citizens.  With a HUGE deficit, SS benefits are in the crosshairs.
Probably not. If Biden gets elected they’ll be the next president.
A leading spokesperson for the opposition party. No wonder Biden can’t find a qualified running mate. 🥴
The greatest myth of this election cycle is the false equivalency that China is rooting for Biden. It’s head fake. Why would Xi walk away from the most stupid, ignorant, useless president that is handing 21st century glory to them on a platter. Don’t make sense.

Since immunity only appears to last for 3mths max, you never actually stop it. Then it is endemic.  That appears to be the Trumpublican plan.  Biden will stop it.

The never-Trump Ohio GOP was all put in place by Kasich. They will do everything they can to deliver the election to Biden.   We’ve got to primary them ALL!
This is exactly why we can't get comfortable with or arrogant about Biden winning. It is still a very real possibility that Trump could take this election.
Mark you 'read' like a scorned Republican who's regretting that he put Trump in office.  If you're looking to argue against Biden... You're on the wrong side of the aisle.  There's no guarantee that any president is going to live through a four-year term. That's irrelevant.
Let's start here and not waste Biden's time.
Then what? Are you serious?  You think that Biden being put office is going to make no difference other than getting Trump out?
I don't give a fuck if Biden is wearing a bib and drooling. He's getting my vote.
Nervous about Biden? I don’t blame you a bit. Trump will bury him.
Michael Brown’s DNA was found inside a police car because he was trying to take an officer’s weapon.  I can’t believe Biden doesn’t have the brains to know the difference between a criminal and systemic racism.
I’m thinking that Biden will pick Maxine Waters for the win. 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Imagine, Dementia Joe and Mad Maxine as the ticket.
Ofcourse Biden/Obama wanted to remove social security. It is a joke of a system that the old are trying to hold onto cause “they paid they’re dues”. But YOU don’t pay any of your own SS, you pay the SS for 7 people. Used to be 5 people paid for 1. System is broke needs scrapped
Definitely. The rest of the government is taking for granted that Biden is going to win, so instead of holding him accountable, they're just letting the clock run. Under these circumstances, even a numpty like him would have no trouble stealing an election.

Insane to me how people have forgotten how much he's fucked up the EPA, department of education, and now post office and yet so many are still saying that Biden is just as bad
That’s what I’m primarily focused on too.  It’s more a question of if I can vote for Biden based on personal morality than anything strategic.  Strategy is pro-Biden, sadly.
The probability distribution given here (27% Trump wins narrowly, 40% Biden wins narrowly or convincingly, 33% Biden wins in a once-per-century landslide) seems pretty realistic to me at the gut level ... though I'm a bit surprised by that 33%.

I am from northern Ohio. “Blue Territory”. For every 1 Biden sign there are 20 Trump signs. Cuyahoga county is a Dem county historically but Trump did extremely well here in ‘16 and no reason to believe he won’t again.  These “polls” must not be actually polling anyone.
At least we don’t get a constant stream of lies from Biden
We don’t need your vote, coward. If you understand anything about politics then you’ll understand that twitter comments don’t drive policy and that Joe Biden, if elected, will act as a moderate democrat. He’s already doing so.
‘The influence that Russia, China or Iran could exert over public opinion in the United States is a tiny fraction of that which is exerted by the unaccountable U.S. billionaire media...’
For people curious why people say this. It's because the problems are deeper than Trump. They are systemic problems. And people are afraid Biden will wallpaper over them and people will pretend everything is alright. Many people want real change. Not just a good feeling.

There is very little difference between trump &amp; Biden.
The fact is, voters have never had access to more information/media in the history of the country. Bernie had no trouble getting his message out. There were like 20 debates, all broadcast live! Biden won because a lot more voters preferred him as a candidate. That's it.
Jenny: Were you excited by the VP pick? Me: It didn't make me any more or less excited to vote for Joe Biden. J: But, did it give you hope? M: I don't have any more or less hope than before the VP pick.  BUT I AM STILL GOING TO VOTE!
The bigger point is that there is absolutely no evidence of a media conspiracy/bias to elect Biden or to prevent Bernie from winning--full stop.  Bernie supporters are second only to Trump supporters in blaming the "media" for their problems.

Actually that would yes to a vaccine with 66 percent saying yes. Coincides with the 74 percent support for masks. That’s why Biden suggested the mandate. Not good for trump

If this "general strike" is separate from electoral politics, why are you striking for the democratic platform, namely Biden's platform?
Vote for Biden. He’s a decent human being. Otherwise it’s a vote for Trump
Are you asking Biden why he's so racist? Same pointless question
I'm not sure what a "moderate" Democrat is. Is it one who: Is pro-life?  Or Supports Police? Favors American workers over illegal immigrants? Or Is pro Israel? Which of these do Biden/Harris support?

Neither...Biden is corrupt senile thief, and double-minded Trump betrayed us all by codifying DACA and agreeing to vote for traitor Mike Lee'd Indian giveaway that ruins the chances for native born American to get work.
Biden is doing hard work...  By that I mean, little to the point the media has to speak for him. How can you unequivocally choose to be highly selective in politics? I get it you hate Trump, that's something you are free to do. But this tweet is rather disingenuous is it not?
So big Biden/Harris announcement this week. Can't wait for the conservative boomers to start parroting fox news at me about all the terrible things she has done in her career and how she will tank the country.  What's that? Already happening?  Oh right. Yeah already happening.
The only difference between Biden and Trump is Trump is a known racist and Biden is in the closet
People actually talking about backing Biden and Harris. They just don't know how to say no. It's a sad affair queen
Biden’s speech was scathing, too. He all but called Trump racist. He drew a line between Charlottesville and Nazi Germany. It actually kinda surprised me by being so direct.
i do not know why but PLEASE PLEASE WE NEED EVERY VOTE TO GO TO BIDEN/HARRIS IF WE WANT THAT CHEETOH PUFF OUT OF THE OFFICE. EVERY VOTE COUNTS.
Of course Trump and the GOP I trying to help Kanye West siphon off votes from Joe Biden. Republicans can't win without cheating.

Do you think Biden and Harris are delaying so #TheFive will be interrupted?
Do you get a good cut at Teespring? I only ask bc I have a shop and am seeing a demand for some shirts.
We can certainly HOPE so. Perhaps having this vile individual on Biden's ticket will be the kiss of death for his campaign.
How people excited about Harris being Biden's VP pick don't realize that she's a token choice and not one best suited to do the job is hilarious to me.
Joe Biden would be the most pro-abortion president in history. Although he was once a moderate, the Catholic former vice president now describes abortion as “essential health care,” caved in to the abortion industry on taxpayer funding, and has been proudly endorsed by
Team Biden’s opposition research was calling Kamala Harris’ nearest Bennigan’s restaurant location.
What do you think about Biden’s vp pick?
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., made history when it was confirmed that she would be former Vice President Joe Biden's running mate in his 2020 presidential bid. The announcement Tuesday makes her the first Black woman and the first Asian-American...
Boy everyday I keep checking how many followers you have and they're dropping like flies! LOL it's because you're a big whining baby who didn't get his way. So now you all you do is Bash Biden and the Democratic Party. The way you speak you want Trump to win to spite Biden. Ass!
Wall Street executives are happy about the Kamala Harris VP selection. (As are all the moderate Dbags on my timeline)
I keep seeing you post about Trump but nothing sbout Biden and the other pedophiles? I question your true morals, not that It matters.
I agree. That is all it is. Put an does not want Biden in. Trump as dumb as he is. Don't realise Putan is using him.
So what you're proposing is that a potential Biden/Harris administration is going to be weak after 4 years of CNN and MSNBC propaganda licks their assholes and tells every boomer in the country how good it tastes?

I'm honestly not fond of her, she's basically the perfect pair with Biden for there to be another absolutely disastrous crime bill. It's cool to see an African American woman in that position, but the fact it's her is concerning.
She is the Soros/Clinton Donors pick. There's only one problem: As Joe Biden would say, SHE AIN'T BLACK.
Fred, you seem to be miserable no matter what. I’m for Biden, not sure you are based on your vacillating positions.
Biden has already set the stage with his own law and order language. He has called them rioters and called for prosecution of anyone disturbing property. As if Wall St hasn't been disturbing our property for ages.
People who don't want Trump in again, but don't feel comfortable voting for Biden:  Don't think of it as voting for Biden, think of it as voting for the next Supreme Court appointee to be someone we can stomach for another quarter century.  Ginsburg may not last another term.
So, Biden choose his VP, to NOT be. However, with such an odd choice, could this be yet another attempt of a smoke screen to hide something else that "they" may be divising...?
So Joe Biden isn’t in your parish? I’m confused...
So how is #ACAB Twitter handling  selection?   Everybody doing ok?  Still voting for Biden or.....?
Has anybody confirmed yet whether Biden knows he picked Harris to be his VP?
Congratulations!! Can’t wait to cast my vote for Biden/Harris.
Kamala Harris is officially black now after being selected Biden's VP.
Curious about something.  With Biden selecting Harris for his VP candidate, does that mean he's qualified her as being black?
It's absolutely hilarious to me that so many people are clamoring for their perceived outcome of a Pence/Harris debate, but just yesterday they were all saying a Trump/Biden debate wasn't necessary.
Are you the one who wrote the script Trump was reading when he said: ‘Yo! Semite’? For every cognitive shot at Biden, I can find 10 from President Fuzz Nuts. Try another approach, like running on your record. Oh, shit, I forgot, that won’t work.
No one cares. Biden chose his VP. There is LITERALLY nothing you're gonna say that you haven't already said. So. No. No one cares. You go on hannity all the time.
Joe Biden picked his former 2020 rival Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate today. Discuss, vote in tonight's poll:
On Tuesday, Joe Biden picked Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate for the presidency.
Biden is a symptom of our garbage political system, so to give this rant a point, dont buy into the idea you need to vote for Biden to get rid of Trump. Vote for someone who actually represents you, even if it's third party and "just a vote for Trump"
the liberal idea of adhering to bipartisan electoral politics is trash, voting for someone just because they're not Trump is not a good enough reason to vote for someone tbh. that's why we got fucked by Democrat defeatism and were left with Biden
Yes he will . Trump is having a press confer ance now. Whining about Biden and Harris. Lol
I’m fine with Harris although Biden could’ve picked a can of spheggitios and he’d still get my vote.

Good luck throwing your vote away. You're just helping elect Trump! At least with Biden/Harris, you have a chance of getting what you want. With Trump you get absolutely nothing of what you want. Think about that? You and Ryan can go pout together that Bernie isn't the nominee.
I would add that it shows that Biden is also smart enough to pick by far the best person to be VP of all the folks out there including men, women, etc...

Dr Biden only does legitimate news shows. Faux is far from that as their own lawyers have argued in court. They lie so they can't be held libel for their lies. The judge agreed, so liars are going to lie. No journalism on that network. A liars reality show &amp; Trump is the star!
That is another man's own personal belief.  It's honoring his wife, but also honoring the reporter, and respecting her.  But let's also say Dr. Jill Biden did say Joe will be at the debates, so did she sign the permission slip?

Biden’s VP pick
The remarks were only President Donald Trump's latest rhetorical foray into Joe Biden's VP selection, which is expected any day.
Can’t wait to find out who Joe Biden picks to be the next president.
The other staff picks are just former Biden staffers, so it doesn't say a whole lot about who he may pick. However, this pick makes me think he's definitely going to choose a WoC and more than likely, it's going to be Senator Harris. I'd prefer Demings or Duckworth, but none of
I would hate to see people do this. I truly don't care who Biden picks. He has work with them for 4 years. We don't. I will still vote for Biden.
It's going to be very interesting to see the reaction of the #KHive if Biden chooses anyone other than Senator Harris, especially if it's Rep. Demings, Rep. Bass, or Senator Duckworth.
This is why I get annoyed when people go after Biden for not being mentally there. Yet this fool keeps getting passes for this mess. If you still don't think Biden will be a better President than this guy then you are a lost individual.

Trump misspeaks, slurs, slips his dentures, and frankly, mispronounces basic American names, like  YO-SEM-ITE for Yosemite National Park, so often that Joe Biden's occasional gaffes gloss over me like water off a duck's back.  Go give Kimmie a botox injection, Donnie J.
If you’re voting for Biden, you’re a fool. 🤷‍♂️ #Facts
There are soooo many more reasons to vote for our President Trump, and soooo many more reasons not to vote for Biden....smh
5.) Overall a great read that is worth your time. Who can best implement some of these needed policy changes? I have zero faith in a career politician like Biden &amp; unfortunately even tho Trump has been good on criminal justice reform I can’t see him changing the drug laws.
No because I'm woke now.  To be honest a scary thought is that if Trump wouldn't have come along and made me curious to see what really is going on I would have followed the crowd with Hillary or Biden. Thank you Potus for not waiting to run any longer than you did. #WalkAway
If Trump loses, he’ll resign before 1/20. Pence, as President, will then pardon him before Biden’s sworn in.
hillary more cringe. biden jus absolutely fucking bizarre
Obviously, the mainstream media isn't helping; it is too focused on the follies of Trump vs. Biden.  So many people I've talked to have never heard of Jo Jorgensen and her campaign.  Imagine what could happen if she were on the debate stage!  #LetHerSpeak

Not necessarily, everything you posted I haven't received. Plus, why would you get continuous emails to something you never signed up for or support. I didn't get emails from the campaign until I signed up for them. With Biden that was through misclicking while browsing the net.
Haven’t seen any debates yet let alone more. Biden will look the fool if they ever happen.

Rather interesting numbers compared to when we last had polling on VP stuff. Harris boosts black women a fuck ton. Drives away white men a bit more, and overall makes more Americans likely to vote Biden than less likely.
I think in this very difficult case ahead of us, voting vs not voting 1stly involves: the pro voter argues Trump is absolute hell 4 us, voting him out is necessary good; the anti-voter says my vote gives Biden a mandate to export our hell like Bush etc did, but to Russian sphere

All you "I'm not voting for Biden because Kamala's a cop" people better not be registering your cars or putting money in your parking meters.   Where do you think that money goes? You know what they do with it?  You can engage in harm reduction and fight back simultaneously.
Great piece on why Kamala Harris is the right pick for VP
If something happens to Biden...does anyone really want her to be President??  NO WAY!  The Democrats only picked her for her physical identity not for her skills to lead this country!!
No she won’t. Bernard, you and Biden are both out of your minds
I’m Team Warren myself, but you won’t see me do anything but vote for Biden/Harris without hesitation.
No, I think you were right on target, when Wall Street loves your democratic VP candidate ...
People who won’t vote because they think Biden is sh*t annoy me so much, like Biden might not be great, but he is miles better than Trump.
It’s not just gonna be Biden, he will have progressives in his cabinet and will sign progressive laws .
LOL. One thing I don't want to see is Biden dancing. White guys cannot dance.
I get it. Voted for Bernie this time and in ‘16. I’m disappointed, but I MUST vote against Trump. I’m worried about the environment and while I don’t think Biden is great on it, I think he’ll listen more than Trump will. Health care and police reform will also fare better
I don't think Biden will win. I think people will vote angry about the riots (since no one can bully them in the voting place) and they hate the virus, the WHO, the doctors and the lockdown. It's 2016 all over again.
I'm not acknowledging Biden from now on btw. Only Harris.
Today I learned Joe Biden was the first black woman vice president
Biden did succeed in destroying all chances of shifting the conditions of a ruling coalition toward leftist interests. The billionaires and trillionaires are not going to feel any bit of our pain and dread for a very long time. No. We will be cutting things off we love. Not them
Yep yep yep. Enthusiastically. Voting Biden/Harris.
I still plan to vote for Biden/Harris.
I to don't trust her politics, as a VP and president if Biden falls to sleep while on duty. We are going to be in trouble, just beware of her politics america this woman has to many emotional battles with herself,
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris As Vice Presidential Running mate   #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
Oh Yeah Well🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽 and Biden/harris2020 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 Bumper sticker: BIDEN in '20-HARRIS in '21
Time get this show going!!
Okay said it and NOW  selected Biden/harris2020✌🏾✌🏾✌🏾✌🏾✌🏾
For The People By the People   Biden/Harris2020
Biden himself uttered pretty much those words.
I swear people will complain about everything.. no matter who Joe Biden would've picked, people would have complained, If God came down and ran with Joe Biden..people would've found a reason to complain smh... i have zero issues w/ K.Harris. ..they have my vote right now.
See, I'll try to bring some actual facts to it.  The platform committee, of the Biden and Sanders campaigns, came up with the most progressive platform in American history.  Setting a clear path to M4A, moving the country forward in multiple ways.
Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. Here’s what you need to know. - Apple News Spotlight
Like she wanted to be VP to Biden???? That people are still so desperate to dunk on her like this is so pathetic honestly
Trump and Pence a lot of racist shit gone keep happening  Biden and Harris a lot of niggas going to prison
I just saw my very first Joe Biden ad😂😂I love how it's him surrounded  misinformed black folks especially after all he's said.
This shit childish af “But not Joe Biden, he’s not that smart”
A Biden/Harris ticket being a puppet of ANTIFA is a pretty hard sell.    Hell, the Trumps even donated to her campaigns.   But good work on your pre-made videos.  Outside being useless and looking poor, they're great.
And Biden/Harris is the best the Dems could come up with?
IMO I believe by Joe Biden picking Kamela Harris he will now lose the election to Donald Trump. I like Senator Harris but what is she going to bring to the table, Biden was going to win California and get most of the African American vote anyhow. Harris might be better than Biden
Aw hell naw. Biden Benson even do I don’t want to
Harris is to Bush and Reagan is to Biden 🥴
You meant to say "Biden" &amp; made a typo, I'm sure.
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris as his Running Mate.
Biden selects Kamalla Harris as VP running mate. Failure at its best.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden’s running mate By Amanda Erickson
I believe that this is good. #BidenHarris2020
yeah,,,I’m not gonna make calls for Joe Biden.
I absolutely, positively, without reservation adore Kamala Harris and nothing Joe Biden has or will do can change that.   This was the right choice.
Biden &amp; Kamala! We knew that.
trump wont due it biden definatley will. i fell safe with joe
I honestly don't think Biden is that stupid and tone-deaf especially after saying it WOULD be a woman.
Bout to be salty asf when Biden picks a black woman vp and the world says he just picked her because she was black
One can be both anti Biden and anti Trump. DC has shown who they work for and it's not the citizens.
Man if Biden pick Kamala as his VP, I’m moving💀
Biden should pick a damn can of soup as his running mate for all I care
Wrong again. I'm a black SJW and like I said, we're on twitter!  I don't have to cue up ANYTHING! Go look at trumps tweets and then decide if attacking Biden is worth it....
Like causing direct harm to Ohio voters, Ohio candidates, and Biden himself by doing even more to depress the votes he thinks he can count on.   Where's Cardi B? Where's LeBron James? Where's anyone on that stage speaking to the Black community? Kanye is.
Trump: Biden Is Insulting Men Everywhere by Picking Woman as Running Mate - The Daily Beast
In-Person drop off is how I’ve  voted for decades.  It feels good to know that my vote is going directly from my hands into the County Voter’s Bureau’s  on-site drop box.  VOTE JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT   VOTE DEMOCRATS FOR SENATE   DONALD J TRUMP FOR PRISON
Raise your hand if you think Joe Biden is better looking than trump.
Biden is 78 yrs old. What u mean he don't know enough about himself?
Not true. Demings and Bass are also not listed as speakers. I think people are making too much of this. Biden is not signaling his pick through the speaker list — that would be stupid.
I imagine you must hate yourself then. Seems to me you are the epitome of stupidity and ignorance. But you vote Biden. After all he did say you aren't black if you don't.
FYI When Biden makes his VP pick I’m logging off Twitter for a month.
In past years you would be 100% correct regarding the VP position. However in these times considering Biden’s age and the shear volume of America’s reconstruction needs the VP spot carries a bigger challenge then usual. Just make sure the cabinet is filled with the best talent.
Really  you are saying that my job (business) that was lost (closed) due to trumps inaction is coming back and I will get my money back that trump gave away to his rich buddies only to lose it again to President Biden. Sounds ridiculous. Trump has taken it all already
This reads like she’s making a plea to KHive to still vote for Biden. The “we”, the tone, it doesn’t feel like she got the spot.
I’m for Biden/Harry
No, he can't run against Biden unless he switches parties. He's too far right for Democrats and too far left for today's GOP, which won't shift in his lifetime.
so neither biden nor trump
Joe Biden, a true ally to the LGBTQ community.
No, no, no. That'd just be anti-Biden ammo for the GOP!
Tucker rips lack of coverage of DC mass shooting, claims media silent to help Biden campaign
So what? Even Bideb knows 2 white men on a ticket at this time would be a disaster. And Pete is more unprepared to assume the job than ANY woman who has been mentioned. Biden's not that stupid, I hope.
Biden will *lick* Rudy
He sounds like he's making a desperate last-ditch plea to Biden who has probably ruled out Warren. She'd be good, but she's not the be-all &amp; end-all &amp; with her age &amp; loss her seat, she's very unlikely to be his choice.
Why do I need to vote for Biden when the Democratic Party has made clear their ideal voter is a Reagan Republican. Just because Trump says the quiet part out loud on the Internet doesn't mean he's any worse than the abysmal leadership this country has had for decades.

Biden gives no reason he just picks Pete.
the surprise is that Joe Biden is picking himself
What does that mean? He's only "unfit and heinous" in your mind. You can't possibly defend your position. Anyone who sees Trump in action knows that he's fit for the job. It's a fantasy to think Biden is competent. It's unfair to him and to the nation to put him in that position.
Honestly that’s just weird. It’s better than being a prosecutor and if you are getting leftists to say they’d vote for Biden because of it, it’s an interesting path to take.
Biden bamboozled us all on the women thing
Donate to Biden and other Dems.   Sign up to work the polls so others who may not feel comfortable being there can stay   Offer rides to the BOE for early voting.   Continue contacting my reps through  and let them know a blue tsunami is coming!
As I thought..you can't so it. In Biden's case, it is imperative that we address this. He is a mere shell of the man he was a decade ago. He is unfit to lead. Forget about your hatred of Trump, Biden has advanced dementia, and his supporters know that. Trump does not.
Biden is a well-known misogynist and proven racist. And all Presidential candidates and Presidents are narcissists. We need additional debates to differentiate between them.
The people who do wait are the ones voting for people like Biden, because they refuse to engage with his larger terrible history.  And it isn’t logical to keep supporting a party that every election says, “look we know we’re awful but have you seen the other guy?!”
I'm Joe biden. And I'm running for the queen of England   #Trump #election #BidenVP
I'm Joe biden. And I'm running for the queen of England
that wont happen i hope biden can pull this off
As will I. All the best and brightest that America has to offer is available. There will be plenty of qualified and talented people (Female,Male, all colors and philosophies) in the Biden administration.They will fit together and work together for America not for a lying coward.
Polls showing  up make me SO nervous. If you are #RidinWithBiden, do NOT get complacent. Please! No poll predicted a Trump victory in 2016, and we should not "expect" a Biden one without kicking, screaming, crying, and fighting for it.
How about one debate.Biden has not debated Trump at all. It's time for the people to hear them and  and learn what they stand for.That is the way democracy works. Stand up and be heard.
Biden has no ideas. He won’t even take questions. trump rebuilt the military that Obama tore down. trump puts America first not criminals.I didn’t reply to him for a reason lol he obviously isn’t informed on biden and kamals history
I'm  curious to see what happens when ...biden wins and the riots don't stop. Will they "realize" that they are also apart of the problem.
Trump to Biden??
quick question what do you think will happen if biden gets elected ?

To our fat slob Cheater-in-Chief  making it impossible for us to vote by mail WON'T STOP US. I will risk exposure to COVID and crawl over broken glass to wherever you try to hide voting facilities to cast my ballot for Biden/Harris. You WON'T stop me so GFY!!!
Even if i have to wait in line in the snow for two weeks and it costs me my job and my home. I'll die before i fail to cast my vote for Joe Biden.
PENCE: The selection of California liberal Senator Kamala Harris as Joe Biden&amp;#039;s running mate simply confirms everything President Trump and I have been saying about Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.
The last time he voted on a bill was 2009. He then spent 8 years in the White House. If you want to criticize Biden’s actual record, you could probably make some valid points. However, blurting out this nonsense, without researching, makes you look uninformed.
Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake
You're not wrong but having a president that is a different party can/will expose the R's and D's hypocrisy. Also, 4 years of nothing getting done would be better than 4 years of Trump or Biden lol. But I honestly think she could get a lot done.
I completely and fully agree! I never thought he did anything improper! He never touched her, she was asleep and it was a joke, he’s a comedian!! It’s disgusting that a pervert is in OUR White House.. and Al Frakeen was removed from office!! He’s a pedophile! #TrumpVirus #Biden

got head from joe biden call that sloppy joe 💯💯😛
No. Biden sucks ass and you shouldn't vote for him. Your a Republican if you support him. Because he is.

Let the campaign of deception begin. Biden and Harris are the most radical leftists to ever run for Pres and VP in US history.
Remember...if you don't vote for Biden, "you ain't black!" And if it's because you don't like Harris, it's because you're racist.
Johnson's spurious "investigation" is obviously an abusive attempt to use his power to damage Biden by "allegation" - a longtime Republican tactic. It stinks to high heaven &amp; it will fail coz there's no there there, BUT it illustrates the depths of Johnson's corruption.

Since you erroneously state he has done nothing, I assume that you haven’t actually researched his record. Almost 300 bills sponsored by Biden in the past 2 decades, 8 years as Vice President, served and chaired the US Senate Committee on the judiciary. What did Trump do?

You’re an FNG idiot Mr Biden. You graduated at the bottom of your class at Syracuse University, you plagiarized your senior thesis, you’re on record using the N word, you’re a racist POS. And I hope most people are smart enough to not vote for you. There I said it!
If by the grace of Satan Biden gets elected and we don"t have a civil war, I think we should treat him and Harris like they treated Trump. Starting with impeachment on day one.

Mighty Joe Biden vs The New Jersey General 🦊📺
IMO if Biden wins, the panic will be reduced, but the control over citizens will remain the same as if the panic was ongoing, because Dems like Biden have been conditioning people to accept more govt control over their lives (new normal). That's what Biden's mask mandate is about
This virtue signalling to the far-left isn't going to go well for Biden-Harris on election day. I'd be very interested to see swing state polls on this proposed mandate.
Correct...but even with this, how does ANYONE take serious what Biden says?  I'll be doggone if I ever listen to the words of a puppet.

5 Takeaways From Kamala Harris’s First Full Day on the Biden Ticket
Who da greatest team ever.....Team Biden Harris
Make no mistake cerything coming out if your mouth is pure propaganda. Anyone who's paying attention knows that both Biden and Harris are tough in crime center-right leaning politicians. Since the gop has moved extreme right-fascist. dems now have to be both parties
There is no way Pence can debate Harris with any success.   Trump and Biden? Well that’s gonna be a lot of yelling and weird shit going on.
Shut up trump. It certainly didn’t collapse when Biden was Vice President did it? You’re the problem right now. You act like a baby
Yup. It will likely go Trump unless there is some dramatic shift. I can’t see the red going blue by anything Biden is saying, it will be a matter of Trump tripping up or losing them over something.
HOPE in what?   That Biden/Harris won’t discuss USA?!!!   TRUMP 2020
Kamala Harris's presidential campaign received contributions from a law firm used by Jeffrey Epstein.  Biden-Harris is the choice for pedophiles.
There is one shot to beat Trump. It’s Biden/Harris. That’s it. I’m gonna take a chance on them.
Swore in as Indian American now running for VP as African American... Kamala Harris is the Trojen horse for Joe Biden to hide his racism even she exposed earlier.
Joe Biden played his hand and lost. Hypocrite Kamala Harris (who openly labeled him a racist) will not pull him through. Trump for 4 more years. #MAGA2020
My opinion, for the little that its worth, is to elect Biden/Harris and STILL show up in the streets regularly to demand the action and policies we want. The people have been awoken and it is up to everyone one of us to keep them awake.
You finding something hard to believe is a failure on your part. I truly have no preference between Trump and Biden. They are both trash. Our system is stronger than either of them.
I don't owe my vote to anyone. Don't bring that "throwing away your vote" bullshit my way. Both Biden and Trump are trash and I don't want either of them in office.
This WH has thrown in the towel and admitted defeat against COVID-19 - they just can't handle the truth.  Bring in Biden/Harris #864511032020
At this point, that is more than enough. I'd love to see a progressive revolution, but I don't think its going to happen this year. Instead, we will elect Biden/Harris and then harness our passion for progress to hold them accountable at every turn. If they fail, they go home.
OMFG!! What a mess this fall is gonna be...stay tuned. Lock her up!!  Threats against former VP Biden...
If I had said this about Biden, I would be called to my boss's office by 9 AM. He says it, and he'll get another new show where he eats elephant perineum.

Umbrellas = antifa, right? Or it’s just Delaware being Delaware. Biden-Harris, the coastal elite ticket!
Here's my bottom line.  Trump is destroying the environment and Biden wants to do nothing about it until 2050 which is "passing the buck."  If we're not carbon neutral by 2030 we're living on a runaway Greenhouse planet.  Biden losing could mean a real progressive in 2024.
I know this isn’t coming from Biden. So who ever you are you’re histerical.  😂😂😂
That’s because you know Biden will not do well at the debates!!
While I agree in theory, when it comes down to more Trump or Biden I have to choose Biden. The two party system sucks but that isnt changing by November. Third parties, currently, are a waste of a vote politically. This needs to change but that isn't happening anytime soon.

Biden certainly does have experience....fleecing taxpayers and pushing racist policies for almost 50 years.  The guy is as corrupt as they get.  And he fondles little girls and sexually assaults women.   But don’t let that get in the way.
Mmmm ... I suggest  Joe Biden-Kamala Harris:  Putting DCency back in DC
It’s the same person who writes Biden’s tweets.
Photo caption:  Biden asks Harris “Again, why are we here?”
“Biden is a rapist” and Trump is accused of raping CHILDREN. “Harris is transphobic” But pence wants to perform electroshock therapy on ALL LGBTQ.  you’re an adult you don’t get what you want when it comes to the best canadate so you don’t vote?  GROW UP.
Here’s the Joe Friday/Joe Biden mashup edition...  Just the facts mannnnnnnnnn!  “A Georgia Republican... has won her primary runoff and is all but certain to win a seat in the House of Representatives in November.”
Y’all act like we want to vote for fucking Biden &amp; Harris.  As if we have a choice but Trump is literally the Devil and becoming a dictator so sorry but i don’t give a fuck. Especially if you’re white!! You don’t have to live with the shit POC have to when it comes to his status
i’m sorry...if you don’t fuck with Biden and Harris WHATEVER but anything is better than 4 more years of the racist torture black people live in with trump as president. shut the fuck up. if you’re not gonna vote then DONT but stop posting about it on social media shut up
2020 Presidential election: 2 candidates who won the first and only presidential election they competed in vs 2 candidates who've lost every election or nomination for president they've competed in, except for Biden winning the 2020 nomination.  Advantage: winners.
Yeah, and Biden is leading in the polls.
OH YA  RIGHT. SHE IS SO FUCKING SMART, IT HURTS. WE ARE IN AMAZINGLY COMPETENT HANDS AND SHE WILL DO JUST FINE ON ECONOMIC ISSUES. NOT TO MENTION, ALL ELSE. WE ARE TRULY BLESSED WITH THIS PICK. BIDEN MADE A GENIUS MOVE WITH HER
She’s backing a racist in joe Biden and a race baiter in KAAAMMAALLLAAA
Biden, Harris rake in millions overnight after running mate announcement  #FoxNews
I'm Voting for Joe Biden And Kamala Harris. Because Trump and pence has Committed Treason, Crimes Against Humanity And Genocide. And Trump Committed And trying to commit Election Fraud.
Sounds like an endorsement for Biden!!!
I'm not sure you've seen the state of politics in this country lately. We don't have a ton of great options laid before us here. Realistically, Biden and Trump are our options and while I strongly dislike Biden I despise Trump and everything he stands for. It's a no brainer.
Ok I guess  is in the business of getting Biden elected president.  They spent The Whole day covering him and Nasty 🤢 Kamala Harris at nauseium   And then wouldn’t even cover Trump’s press conference
Billy want no debates between Trump &amp; Biden bc Trump will trumped Joe every time! Pence will have to be aggressive more than Harris bc she will be president if they win!
I’ll take the adults. Biden/Harris.
A landslide is usually a disaster.  Maybe someone should've told them that.  Biden can't finish a sentence and Kamala is a dirty cop who put record number of African American males behind bars for petty crimes.  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Agree, but Dems don't live in reality. To answer your question - Beijing Biden.
Kamala wasn't chosen to be VP nominee b/c she'll win over new voters for Biden, although she may win some minorities who vote based solely on identity politics.  She was chosen to be Biden's attack dog, to make the election a referendum on Trump &amp; scare ppl away from voting Trump
After being off of twitter for a whole day, I am finally speaking out: Biden/Harris 2020 y’all let’s GOOOOO
You know she's going to claim the election was illegitimate when Biden loses. Maybe Russia hoax 2.0.
'Open and shut': Kamala Harris argues case is clear against Trump in introduction as Biden's running mate
Put  in a google search - Joe Biden campaign website comes up
Did any one notice that Biden said that Kamala  knows about being both African american and Indian American ?    How many can you be?
So...  antifa . com takes to to Biden/Harris web page!  Lol...
Trump literally promised to defund SS over the weekend. Biden wants to keep payroll tax and expand it to income of 400k+ with no cap, which will in fact expand social security so that argument is moot. Plus Kamala left that position nearly a decade ago
Thought the same thing when I heard him pronounce her name.  Even though he ran in primaries with her &amp; Bo Biden and her were such good friends... Hmmm
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event
Ha, I completely didn't realize what this tweet was saying when I liked it. I barely see Trump and Biden as on "different sides" so I didn't even realize that's what was being talked about.
hey Joe Biden who was your best friend back here in the Senate I think he was from West Virginia his name was KKK bird remember him the head of the KKK the grand Pooh Bah of the clue cluck clan. You are disgraceful
Joe Biden you are be ashamed of yourself talking about what happened in Charlotte and you know damn well Donald Trump put down the KKK and the leader of the KKK he was talking about the average citizen that was on both sides about tearing down the statues
Make no mistake about it, if elected, this weak Democratic duo will aid and abet the radical socialists and anarchists at every turn. Americans must reject Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and their dangerous ideology.
Happily contributing to #BidenHarris2020 and can't wait to #VoteBidenHarris2020 in November!  Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
stop faking radicalism to keep your fragile idea of democracy in place. biden is an out of date racist and Kamala is a cop who’s been an active part of mass incarceration in the US. do your research and understand who youre voting for b4 its “blue no matter who”
Joe Biden made the right choice, unlike Trump.
The Republican plan and the Biden plan are the same. Die, preferably as quickly and cheaply as possible.
Y'all hate Biden but might vote for Kanye............

Biden Harris 2020.  Make America China.
As a 26 y/o African American she is nasty liar who still has hundreds sitting in jail over weed and because of that Biden has lost my vote #JoJorgensen2020 #Yang2024
pete release the high hopes dance for Biden/Kamala or else
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is set to formally introduce Kamala Harris as his running mate in the next hour.  Watch it here  or listen to  coverage on 89.7FM #Election2020
Just the fact that they called Biden a liberal I just? He’s literally almost bad and the orange man himself😫I just hate it here
Yes, keep beating the “Slow Joe” drum because we see how effective that is when we compare Biden to Trump.
These comments by Kamala back in October make more sense now in light of Biden's team choosing her as VP nominee. She played the long game.
Biden understands loss and grief and unless you’ve gone through all that, you can’t understand his strong compassion #BidenHarris2020 #TrumpVirus #protectUSPS #BLM #boycottKardashians #InteruptTrump #TrumpKillsUSTroops #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor #personwomanmancameratv #UNMAGA
It’s not that simple, just because tRump is so bad doesn’t make Biden/Kopmala good.  Both suck, again, it’s just the lesser of two evils.  #DemExit
trump is gonna end up being president again just because y’all think not voting for Biden is gonna prove something 🤦🏾‍♀️
Please copy-paste and distribute widely:  Senators Ron Johnson, Lindsey Graham, and Chuck Grassley are all working actively to spread Russian propaganda through the Senate against Joe Biden.  They should ALL resign NOW.  PASS IT ON.
I don’t know what that is but I am voting for Biden/Harris.
What does the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party David Pepper think about Joe Biden selecting Kamala Harris as his running mate? Take a listen:
Let me be clear...THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING THAT WILL KEEP ME FROM VOTING AND VOTING BIDEN/HARRIS...
Let's talk about the Biden Harris campaign and what it means for us....  via
I'm seeing a lot of people saying that we should vote for Biden because he's not Trump and I don't think anyone remembered what happened when we said that last time unfortunately.
Biden's running mate running the show would be true no matter who he chose though, whether it was Kamala or someone else. So your reply doesn't address Kurt's question.
It seems to comes down to greater uncertainty about this Fall compared to 2016 (COVID/Economy) but these are still large discrepancies given the Biden's greater polling advantage and the relative stability of his lead compared to Clinton's.
Kamala was chosen because she's as shameless a liar as you'll find, &amp; will be Biden's attack dog, while the MSM writes puff pieces about her unique heritage, as they've already begun doing.  Dual goals: make election referendum on DJT while hyping potential of 1st black woman VP.
Just so we can catch our breath for a minute and get the Rona under control. I haven't craved stability like this since I was 8...Biden flawed as hell, but like...lol
But you had Clinton at about an 85% probability to win at this point in 2016 and, as 538 has pointed, Biden's polls are much better than Clinton's were at their peak.  Why the difference?
Elizabeth, I’m responding to the constant attacks on Joe Biden that he is in decline and hiding in his basement. You think those attacks are okay?
She can't even pretend to be an advocate of law &amp; order, b/c the Dem base is openly calling to defund police in cities across the US.  Kamala is just Biden's attack dog who will constantly attack Trump &amp; try to make the election a referendum on him as Biden has been trying to do.
please explain how Kamala is bad for trump  lol  I mean Biden picking a cop is one thing in this day and age, but a CROOKED  one?!?  PLEASE! lol  Tulsi Gabbard had no shot at the nomination and crushed Kamala in the debates.
Biden at 71% is like saying The Ohio State Buckeyes have a 71% chance of beating ❌ichigan this college football season.    Side Note: Big10 season has been cancelled!
Wouldn’t you love to see Trump ride a bike or try jogging. He couldn’t last 30 seconds with Joe Biden.
I hope Biden/Harris is the worst ticket I ever have to consider voting for. Trump/Pence is obviously excluded because if I didn’t vote for him the first time how could I now
Cis folx, I’m going to need you to talk w/ yr friends. Come fall, the Trump plans to put trans youth in the crosshairs. Why? He’s hoping to appeal to cis women leaning Biden who are under-educated on trans issues &amp; susceptibile to scare tactics. Be prepared to defend trans kids.
Harris is such an aggressive personality  that she will quickly join Pelosi and Schumer in dominating Biden. As Biden grows weaker and weaker the election will focus on Harris’ radical left positions and her ruthless use of government power to impose radical values.

You think they're the same? I am not asking this to be funny, I'm legit curious. Biden was not what I wanted, but I understand why he absolutely needs to win in November.
Fox News's Cavuto fact-checks Trump campaign claim that Harris called Biden a racist: 'She never did'  via
I really wonder if Biden took so long to pick Harris because of all the other quality candidates werent a good fit or said no? Was Harris the pick all along but strategy was why they waited? It just seems like when Biden first said he would pick a woman of color,
Any black person tweeting negatives about Kamala Harris is self sabotaging! Your are directly putting a negative impact on her and Biden’s potential election and ion like that!
Not gone lie I probably won’t vote at all this year. Biden and Trump can both go to hell!
Every time I see Joe Biden, I automatically smell an egg salad sandwich. Weird.
was really hoping for a Joe Biden/Tiffany Pollard ticket
JOE BIDEN...LIKE ...KING ME....SIR YES SIR
Biden is Box office
Notice that after the "big" announcement, Biden/Harris isn't even trending on Twitter in under 20 hours. What does THAT tell you?
Biden...Mount Rushmore
Joe Biden belong on Mount Rushmore 🇺🇸
I’m not a fan of the whole Biden/Harris thing, but I would rather they be in the White House than Trump/Pence again...  But I would seriously much rather have #JoJorgensen2020 in office over everyone else
She did this AND Biden wrote the 1994 Crime Bill ... but somehow I’m expected to believe that voting for them is a vote for change?!
I can’t wait to vote, Biden/Harris! 🇺🇸
Vice President Biden, I believe you, sir. Please, please listen to your advisors. You have a challenging election ahead of you so please be open to advice. I want you to win so badly. I will help your campaign in NE Ohio. I promise.
You mean Biden would do the right thing? You underestimate the intelligence of the suburban women, as you underestimate everybody’s intelligence but your own. They see through your unfounded scare tactics.
We gotta vote Biden or Trump ...like when is we gone wake up dawg. Why I gotta choose to die by gun or rocket launcher🥴🥴🥴🥴
I'm watching Biden/Harris today!
It is interesting to imagine if:  a)SarsCov2 most strongly impacted predominantly conservative locations in the US instead of NY/NJ.  or  b)Obama/Hillary/Biden was POTUS instead of Trump in 2020.  Would the MSM's coverage have been significantly different than it has been so far?
To everyone on here with an opinion about not wanting to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala harris Angela davis had an interesting stance during an interview a few months ago that would be beneficial to everyone I feel
Inside Biden’s unusual VP pick process: Tough questions, 11 finalists and many lawyers
you say that now, but come November, you know you are voting biden/harris   lol
But hey let’s not choose someone because of their history/experience/policies. Let’s choose Kamala because Joe Biden is seen as an old racist white man and Kamala will help get the black/female/Indian vote. And that one lady on SNL looks like her and is funny so thats cool too
I want my Biden/Harris sign!
Sooo, I’m not happy about Kamala Harris, definitely not happy about Biden, but still gonna suck up my feelings and vote this idiot out of office
Is this an ad for or against Biden and Kamala?
Fuck Biden. Fuck Trump too.  #JoJorgensen2020
THANK YOU JOE BIDEN!!!! Kamala Harris is the one candidate who can really get in the orange ones head. I can finally stop buying Alka Seltzer and Bourbon by the case, and maybe sleep for more than three hours at a time.
I don’t hope anything bad on anyone but bc Biden is old af there is a real possibility she could be the first woman president
Yeah, I hope she stays healthy.  Happily voting for Biden/Harris myself.  Be well.
I know Joe Biden is cuckoo but why would he choose soon deceased wrestler Kamala Harris to be his running mate?🤣
"If and when biden decides to step aside"  WHAT DOES THIS ACTUALLY MEAN?!?!?!?!
Look who is in the background of this poster. Biden had to photo bomb to be in the picture. Very telling.
Fuck man. Joe Biden really had to go an pick the only Democrat worse than him as his VP.   Didn't wanna vote 3rd party, but Howie or Jo, here I come.
Did she have to sleep with Biden to get the job like her other ones?
Good morning America it's Wednesday. How we know who running for president Trump or Joe Biden it's your choice it's American dream at stake
His facts don't fit your narrative. Tough shit. She's terrible but so is Biden so she's probably perfect for him.
So let me get this straight Biden is a known racist and trump is the one struggling? You really are twisted
#nastywoman dude  is in full dbag mode:  "President Trump responds to Kamala Harris’ selection as Biden’s VP and political analysts look at how it might impact the race"
I’m a trans person who believes in abolition. My excitement over Harris is excitement over strategy: it was the smartest choice Biden could have made &amp; it’ll help them win. These candidates aren’t my ideal choice, but they’ll ensure the ouster of a transphobic white supremacist.
Put Joe Biden on mount Rushmore
Omg!! He most certainly should. I want him arrested on the steps of the Capitol after President Biden has been sworn in. Pompeo and Barr should go down with him for being his accomplices. The most corrupt administration EVER!!
Da fuq are you babbling about? We stopped listening to Bernie when he endorsed Biden. We don't give a shit about him anymore.
Joe Biden ending slavery
It’s a civil war....when trump lose....white racist trailor trash goin riot...loot stores...MR Joe Biden...I guess people change...thanks jb
Den Doctor Jill and Joe Biden made history yesterday...Kamala Harris light skin..she don’t  play yo...I’m in tears yo...I’m from racist ohio..I’m used to white racism...but..in ohio u ball out at a white racist high school Dey treat u like royalty ...i
I hate Trump. I hate Biden. I hate political parties
Oh the irony, "She was probably nastier than even Pocahontas to Joe Biden," Trump said of the Harris and Biden clash, referring to his nickname for Elizabeth Warren. "She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. And it's hard to pick somebody that's that disrespectful."
Do you really think anybody gives a shit about a debate between Pence and Harris? everybody wants to see the annihilation that Trump will put on Biden in their debate. Sleepy Joe is going to look really stupid!
Possibly, but we have 2 choices. Biden who has one complaint in a stellar career or Trump who brags about assaulting women. I will take Biden/Harris.
Biden/Harris: Liberty &amp; Justice for All Biden/Harris: Better Together, Better for All Biden/Harris: Together We Can
With that logic, They might as well just flip the ticket then since Biden is just going to step aside anyways.
What voters are Biden's strategists expecting to win over by choosing Kamala? I don't see her moving the needle with any group of voters.
Hell No.  no desire to be run By a socialist communist ticket of Biden/Harris
Your statement isn’t diverse enough. According to Joe Biden that’s because you’re a member of the African American community. I will absolutely not be voting for Joe Biden. Having you in office would be even worse.
Did you know that the best way to defund the police is having a former cop as Vice President? It’s like Biden saw everything that was going on and said “I don’t care about this”. Can we have a new election where we don’t have selfish idiots running for President.
Did you know joe biden has an island swiming distance from. Pedo island  with a submarine port on it. Have you seen biden sniff girls on live TV. How about kamala falsely imprisoned blacks and POC's when a prosecutor, then joked about getting high on radio.
Oh, I’m so happy! History was made tonight! Good trouble will win John Lewis! Elijah Cummings!! We will make the America return that you fought for..we’ll pick up where you left off! So yeah Biden Harris. It’s time. Let’s go. #TrumpVirus #ProtectUSPS #BidenHarris2020 #BLM #UNMAGA
You actually think the Democrats think what you have to say will change their minds about how much of a shit hole you really are about everyone including your own Administration and you want to talk like this about Biden
Not popular at all but not alone like you 😅😅😅. If I keep serving lefties with big servings of truth with a dash of salt ill get there. #Trump2020 this gonna be easy biden don't know where he's even at 😅😅😅😅😅😅
I completely agree! I worked for my Social Security.. It’s money I earned! They can’t take our only income source! Pelosi Schumer will protect and Biden Harris will take away Trumps kingdom and we’ll be alright! #TrumpVirus #ProtectUSPS #BLM #BidenHarris2020 #boycottKardashians
I Would Get Way More Happy About Biden/Harris If They Actually Had A Chance At Winning. Trump Really Done Tricked These Black People 😭😭
Here's my bottom line.  Biden wants carbon neutral by 2050.  Science says 2030.  Privileged or not, healthcare or not, this world is about to become a runaway Greenhouse planet.  Then we can all equally cook to death.  Biden losing can mean a real progressive in 2024.
Because Kamala Harris was on SNL. It’s easy to ignore indigenous communities being trampled and exploited when Biden gives his ice cream cone to a kid at a fair. “Back to normal” means you don’t have to act like you care anymore.
Forget Biden/Harris 2020  Wet Ass P-Word 2020
At this point does the DNC even anticipate Biden serving more than half his term if he wins?
Yes but Beau Biden was a phenomenal man. He died of the same thing my brother did.
She literally backpedaled every single “progressive cause” she backed so she could get the VP spot. FYI, Biden/Harris are against a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and legalizing marijuana. Not very progressive.
I'll  miss S. Cooper after we #864511032020, but not so much to change my vote from a Biden Harris win!

Harris wasnt my top choice for veep, but a Biden Harris ticket is good for me! Screw Loose Dons  reign of fear is over
Ngl Biden lowkey made the right VP pick fr I know people who’re actually informed don’t fw Kamala that much but y’all giving some people too much credit large majority of niggas gone look &amp; say “My nigga Biden was with Obama &amp; he running with a black lady oh yeah he got my vote”
reminder that not voting for biden means you’re voting for trump to replace two supreme court justices which puts lgbtq+ and reproductive rights at serious risk. #SettleForBiden
Voting for Biden and Harris is not ideal, but is absolutely necessary in this election. However, a vote for Biden and Harris does not mean they shouldn’t be criticized. Hold them accountable and pressure them into making progressive change.
Well, I believe Biden is Catholic, so you're wrong.  Anyhow, religion doesn't belong in politics. I long for the day when the Prez. AND VP are both secular. Unfortunately, it probably won't happen during my lifetime.
Nothing compared to the perfect storm coming your way Fat Ass.. Biden/Harris2020
We had a black president and shit still aint change lol dunno what people are gonna expect with BIDEN and KAMELA HARRIS who is a literal op
I have no clue what you are trying to say mate... are you delivering me a message from Joe Finger bang biden?... bang bang? Yes dems are a circus. You know your party started the kkk right. Jim Crowe was a Democrat. And you side is the only1s who claim black lives dont matter
Do you hear it?? Those cracks in the glass ceiling are getting bigger and louder Biden/Harris2020💙🌊👠
Was Harris lying then or now about Biden? Or do you just not care?
What do you guys think of Biden's VP pick?
I know Biden did not pick Kamala Harris as his running mate.... 🥴
Ok so Biden and Harris weren’t our top picks for sure, but now we band together, whoop trumps ass, then spend every day telling them what we want, protest, and Smash that vote button every two years and primary Congress people and senators who don’t hear us.
As is your Biden. Even smart people vote dumb.
I know I'm happy too. No way biden gets elected with kamala sleep your way to the top Harris. This message has been paid for and brought to you by yo momma beeeee
Weird.  I remember you saying you believed Joe Biden’s sexual assault accuser.  Now you’re his running mate?  You may literally be the biggest hypocrite politician ever.  Congrats.
Joe Biden coulda made a chicken as his VP and he’d still get my vote. I’ll do anything to get that pumpkin out of office
#DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #DemocratsHateAmerica #DemocratsAreMarxistsDestroyingAmerica #DemocratsAreDomesticTerrorists #DemocratsAreEvil #DemocratsAreTheVirus #DemocratsAreADisgrace #KamalaHarris #KamalaVP #JoeBidenKamalaHarris  An ACTUAL ad from the Biden campaign!
FUCK Kamala Harris. FUCK Joe Biden. FUCK Donald Trump. FUCK Nancy Pelosi. FUCK Mitch McConnell. Our nation is run by the ruling class under the guise of “democracy”. I’m sorry but democracy isn’t choosing between fascist and fascist. Fuck the election. Let’s bring a revolution.
One sign of Biden was spotted!
This. Theyll absolutely see Biden's election as a validation of his shitty policy and not a repudiation of Trumpism. We are screwed either way.
I mean that is probably for the best. Joe Biden's success is dependent on him shutting up.
Biden could’ve run with the groundhog that just devastated my cucumber patch and I’d still vote for him (I can take care of the groundhog post-inauguration).
I wonder what D.Miller would suggest for Biden?
No need to look it up non Trumpers are not blind to his agregious acts. You can bring up a thing or 2 about Biden whom I don’t like I could  name 10 examples from last few days with orange baby. Love ya Coop but moral compass will point Norrh on 11/3/20 . Trump ship sinking fast
Don’t invalidate people’s frustrations over Biden/Kamala👏🏼 People are allowed to commit to voting for them AND air their grievances
Don't worry those same people will be crushed by a Biden presidency as well. He'll just do it more politely.
me put my ballot with Biden’s name checked off in the mail
Don't worry, I wont complain a bit. Trump, Biden 2 sides of the same shitty coin. Your meltdown, however, will be glorious.
Why should we work to defeat Trump. To elect Biden? Lololol. Hes the same cruel policies with a kinder, gentler packaging.
Politics way better den running gassers and going to practice....I love Politics...thanks to Mr Joe Biden...Im a Mrs universe and celebrity apprentice fan and I was a new jersey generals fan usfl...dat was Donald john trump shit...Trump got white folks back...im kool wit dat
Did you know that the pandemic of 1917 ended WW2?  Did you know Thailand is actually thigh-land? Trump is a racist, rapist, pedophile,bigot, homophobe, xenophobe, religious bigot, bold face liar. Jo Jorgensen is actually my candidate of choice however going with Biden
You should definitely vote for Biden/Harris but if you're actively excited for Biden/Harris let me know so I can come shove you into a locker
I've only been voting since '08, but Biden/Harris is the most distasteful ticket the Dems have put forth in that short time. I've made my choice, I'm going to vote for them because of the extraordinary circumstances, but I don't begrudge anyone who won't. They're both terrible.
I can't wait until Biden/Harris win so we can drop to the floor in relief and happiness and then get back to protesting the normal bad things WH leaders do instead of these horrible, crazy, "upside down" Twilight Zone awful things the current WH leaders have been doing.
That is exactly how I feel because Biden will not make it to 6 months. And the Democrats and she can have their way! But we all know that's not going to happen Trump for four more!
Thank you Mr Joe Biden....🇺🇸
Joe Biden... ..u da man dog...lol
Kamala goin run dis shit....Joe biden a trip...something fishy going on
#BidenHarrisALLIN2020 Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
The reason I ask for sources from others instead of myself is because I want to see sources that Biden supporters trust.  I want to see the data that they choose.
Called it. I was never convinced Rice was a contender. Both Rice &amp; Kamala are comfortable liars, but Biden needed someone so shameless they'd be willing to defend Biden's myriad flip-flops and dementia, &amp; Kamala fit the bill better than Rice.
Harris and Biden... how embarrassing
Whoever is against Biden/Harris has serious issues mentally. Trump must of grabbed yall by yall privates and yall liked it!🤷🏾‍♀️
Yeah .... uh, about that.
Hell, I’m insulted Trump is even president.
“Phony Kamala” trending out of all the shit trump do and say to contradict himself😂😂😂 yup Biden in 4
Tulsi Should have been Joe Biden’s VP pick
Why do you keep calling bill gates a killer? What makes you think he's a killer? And Coronavirus is not a hoax At All. And Stop with the conspiracy theories. We Actually Need a Real president Like Joe Biden. Not Putin's Puppet Like Trump.
I thought being Black had to do with the pigment in your skin, not who you voted for
Not thrilled about Harris but Biden is not exactly the progressive candidate. So okay, let’s move on and get to voting out Trump.
Kanye may hurt his vote....splitting it.  Giving Biden a small window.  Kanye needs to exit and prepare for the next election
She can help feed Biden when he is too feeble to feed himself.
I just made a Freudian slip and Tweeted out Biden/Warren! lol
I can’t believe Biden made us wait to see who his running mate would be, and it’s Kamala Harris. Establishment dems will be the death of America, tbh.
Literally everyone has thicker skin that trump.  Doubt it was hard at all Biden to pick the best person .  your criticism of her tonite make you weak and smaller than usual.
“Ridin’ with Biden” is a very poor choice of words imo
Joe Biden has thick skin and is not afraid of his primary competition.  Also not intimidated by strong women like trump
Dear President Elect Joe Biden...thank u big dog
Joe Biden just selected a VP who quit before the first primary because no one likes her.  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Joe Biden just selected a VP who quit before the first primary because no one likes her.  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wat a brotha goin do....trump sold out to racist police...and buying a new FBI building and people sick and quarantined....say what u want about Biden but he made history dog...
But anyway Biden/Harris 2020!
Trump: “Harris was nastier to Joe Biden than Pocahontas.” I AM SO DONE WITH PUERILE NAME-CALLING. NOVEMBER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“That little girl was me” #Kamala —Well this aged awkwardly.
Trump: “Harris was nastier to Joe Biden than Pocahontas.” I AM SO DONE WITH PUERILE NAME-CALLING. NOVEMBER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Biden picks a woman that hates white people, accuses him of being racist, never condemned her friend Jussie Smollett for trying to start a race war, bankrupted her campaign to be VP of the United States. God help us if these 2 morons get elected.  Great pick dummy
Thank you, Joe Biden for nominating one of the most unpopular, callous, Marxists in the country. Trump's chances just improved dramatically!
Thank you, Joe Biden for nominating one of the most unpopular, callous, Marxists in the country. Trump's chances just improved dramatically!
Kamala Harris’ extreme positions, from raising taxes to abolishing private health insurance to comparing law enforcement officials to the KKK, show that the left-wing mob is controlling Joe Biden’s candidacy, just like they would control him as president.
If Joe Biden was really running for the blue he wouldn’t have picked Kamala for his VP...
Joe Biden actually finds a running mate who's done more damage to minorities than himself...
Joe Biden actually finds a running mate who's done more damage to minorities than himself...
Gee, calling Biden a racist could draw a lot of Trump voters to vote for Biden
I don't like the orange man at all, the Biden VP pick was always about strategy. Electoral college is still an issue and I don't know if Kamala Harris is going to bring enough voters to help flip some states.
fuk That! I guess the 1% once all of us poor people to fight each other because that bitch should not be vice president. They will kill Biden and she will become president. Democrats have four years to give us good representation. They failed
My wife just said: "I feel the exact opposite of the way I felt when Clinton announced Kaine as her running mate in 2016." Hard same. This, in contrast, was a smart choice. Kamala will ensure Biden's victory. I am manifesting it.
Biden ain't lasting 8 years...  Trump could still win tho.
Outflanking Biden?  Trump's Executive Orders for Evictions &amp; Student Debt!  via  more deception from Trump.
I’ve been the most apathetic to politics than I ever have in my entire life when I should be caring the most.   I’m not for Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris, and absolutely against Trump.  Might as well do this:
When will Biden/Harris yard signs be available?!?
So proud to hear of the Biden/Harris announcement today. It’s a great step for all of us  #BidenHarris2020
I said to Court on Sunday that Joe Biden was gonna pick Kamala because he’s a cop.
You're being a real pill today.  Four more years of this admin will bury us all. If you can't objectively see that a Biden/Harris admin will be better for this country there's not much hope for your intellect. This ticket is far from ideal, but it's infinitely better than Trump.
yeah I’m voting Biden/Harris calm down, I’ll be curious to see if any of you screaming vote blue no matter who (and blocking people with cristicm) put in the work w/ phone calls &amp; such - &amp; if none of you hold these same people accountable if they’re elected it’s fuckin useless
Joe Biden is selecting California Senator Kamala Harris to be his running mate.
This really hurts the “we just need to pressure Biden when he’s in office” narrative. Time and time again he’s proven he doesn’t care and will only listen to his billionaire donors when it comes to policy decisions.
During the one biggest civil rights movements in history (specifically calling to “defund the police”) Biden and the DNC choose Kamala Harris as VP. They heard us. And are telling us they don’t care and will actively do the opposite of what we’re fighting for?
I try to use this sparingly but...  Fuck.   Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Over the moon for Biden Harris! Thank you Mr President for all you do💙
Please don’t fumble the bag with Biden and Kamila when its time to vote. I’m sick of cheeto man.
Kamala Harris the First Black Major Party VP running mate. Joe Biden Kamala Harris 2020. History in the making!  . . . #blackwomen #blackpeople #black #america #change #history #people…
Happy with Kamala, but I’m not sure the Biden/Harris ticket will be centrist enough to pull over displaced republicans
Brooooo Joe Biden finna won the whole election based solely off the fact that a black woman will be his Vice President..
You know, I sound like a broken record but Black men has been drastically undervalued as a voting block. This might be an issue, if the Dems don't start discussing how a Biden/Harris ticket will be beneficial for African American men in November.
Congratulations ! We are in your corner all the way! So happy with Biden’s pick. Best of luck!
Biden wants that black vote lol.
Bold strategy highlighting Kamala Harris as #47 after Biden. Using her attacks against Biden was obvious and takes no skill, but a hell of a blunder telling undecided and battleground voters to view her as presidential material when they think of this ticket so thank you.
so Kamala Harris is Biden’s VP pick. What are the chances of this being a winning ticket?
Biden has picked Kamala Harris to run as his VP  Harris abused her power as CA Attorney General to raid the home of  She prosecuted pro-life journalists when they dared investigate  selling of baby parts. She supports killing babies up until birth.
Biden has picked Harris to run as his VP  Harris abused her power as CA Attorney General to raid the home of  She prosecuted pro-life journalists when they dared investigate  selling of baby parts. She supports killing babies up until birth.A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for CCP
Had Joe Biden never entered into the world of politics and political shakedowns, what do you suppose his net worth be today?
#trumpspying I am willing to bet large sums of money, that this SCANDAL GOES ALL THE WAY UP TO OBAMA, BIDEN, RICE, HILLARY, and the WHOLE OBAMA CABINET...THEY SHOULD ALL BE PROSECUTED, CONVICTED AND PAY THE MAXIMUM PENALTY!!
NBA says photographer who posted offensive Kamala Harris meme is no longer in bubble  via  Glad they fired his ass
Serve? More like get more richer under Biden’s nose.
There’s no crack there, so he’s not there.  Plus Hunter likes the stripper looks, and we all know Camela, as Biden would say, is not.
Do not vote Biden!!! Jsut don’t mf vote this year on god 🤦🏽‍♂️
Not to worry, Biden will just issue an Executive Order
Of course they REFUSED to take questions. One of them can’t remember his own name &amp; one of them has said the most egregious things about Trump supporters, that they have no defense,&amp; don’t WANT to explain Biden’s memory loss or Harris’wanting to HUNT down TRUMP SUPPORTERS. F
if you voting for joe biden like this tweet so i can unfollow you
Y’all a fool if y’all think Biden not racist, especially after what he said.
I'm not voting for #Biden cause RobinWillams opinion that's supposed to be a joke But in our country. we use every little word every action To attack anyone
To all you PRs. Vote for BIDEN
When corrected, did Biden break out into a whiny bitch fest?
Never! You're an inspiration! But true to form for a Democrat candidate for president, Biden went straight to the old "us against them" section of the playbook!People  don't respon well, to Doom and gloom,or having thier country berated, by the class of people who did the damage.
But. You’re racist Mr. Biden
Liberals are just as racist as conservatives but liberals lie to your face about it you prolly still don’t think that Biden is a racist lol
Unfortunately that’s not your choice. Don’t vote for Biden and re-elect Trump
Both Trump &amp; AG Barr knows their days are numbered, with Biden picking Harris, it’s just a matter of time before we hear the “Lock him up!” chants. #BidenHarris2020 #AGBarr #DonaldTrump #JoeBiden #KamalaHarrisForVP #Trump #LockHimUp
I really want us to climb the ladder as a country. I really do. I think Biden is seriously the only real choice that we have moving forward. I’m sure he’s going to do a lot of good, and take us up the ladder, but we need to get him there.  Just please vote well. Thanks all :)
One election will not solve the past 4 years. But we can climb the rung that’s first on the path to the top. It’s going to be a while until things get to a good place. But if we don’t keep climbing we won’t get there.  Just consider that when you’re upset about Biden’s choice.
I already see people complaining about Biden’s choice for VP because Harris was “a cop”. She was an attorney. People saying that Biden deserves to lose for his choice of VP.  That’s the kind of mentality that is going to put trump in the White House for another 4 years...
If people got paid to bitch and whine about #Biden and #Harris, there'd be a lot more millionaires on the left.
Short memory , you know I believe “ Dr Ford”, and Biden’s accuser,Yada. Yada
I need better Biden/Harris shirt design options!
Didnt she call Biden a racist on national television?
makes me 110% more excited about voting for Biden. Can’t wait to flush the turd. #FlushTheTurdNov3rd #BidenHarris2020
Who Is Kamala Harris? Senator From California Is Biden's VP Pick    Not sure what’s so historic?We’ve already had a Black president.
I hope nobody leaks the VP pick. I want to hear it from Biden himself.
Haha! What a joke Biden is ! 3 degrees ..... REALLY?
Biden should stop doing it then we’ll stop posting it
Joe Biden and Jill Biden please listen!  We need to have sll the votes counted!  They can’t just get the rural precincts majority vote to send the delegates they want to the Electoral College!  Then the 3 million more votes for Hillary were not counted!  70,000 in Detroit alone!
No one invested that much Fredo
No one-and let me emphasize, no one-thinks Trump is religious and Biden is  not. Except of course for the cult and it’s enablers
I’d be pissed because it’s not Kamala but I wouldn’t have any *other* objections to Biden choosing her.
That’s where Biden’s mind is at, last century.
Biden is openly racist and idiotic. He doesn’t need help to lose.
A cat understood what Biden was talking about the diversity of Hispanics. It was not dog to the black community what so ever.
Ohio Where trump declared insanely that Biden would hurt God and the Bible.  #voteblueohio
Biden dont shitted on the African American community twice this year...and y’all wonder why I rock with Trump tho
Biden is a disgrace!!  He’s a communist.
Also, Biden isn’t Clinton
Yep! Wake up America!! Biden is making his mentor Senator Byrd smile up at him from hell right now!
Lol I am now convinced Biden is a puppet to get trump back in office another 4 years
If Biden can hurt God then I'm definitely voting for him!
#DonaldJTrump #Ohio Oh I forgot how #GOD Is on the side of #Pussygrabbers That have sex with #pornstars while they are married Oh yea and #Biden is destroying religion Now #Trump thinks he can trick and play GOD You are headed for a huge fall O #sinnerboy
YOU LITERALLY SAID THAT BIDEN IS AGAINST GOD.  WTF?  HE'S A DEVOUT, PRACTICING CATHOLIC AND YOU DON'T GO TO CHURCH OR KNOW THE BIBLE AT ALL.  YOU ARE SATANNo, because ALL AMERICANS need to know what Obama and Biden did to spy on the Trump campaign and to try to end his Presidency illegally! The truth hurts, but the truth shall set you free!
All of your arguments against Biden are based off of could be and maybes, my arguments for him are based on what IS. Trump IS more dangerous than Biden, no other president has been so dismissive of our rights and protections as citizens. We need to push if Biden wins of course
One more thing Biden will have to fix.
Ok so long as you vote. I get why people aren’t happy. IM not happy, but Trump is dangerous, Biden is inconvenient. Not voting Biden is self indulgently stupid We gotta be good lil party boys and girls until Biden is in. Then we can give him and Kamala heartburn for four years.
If you’re calling for an armed revolution you are just as delusional as a red hat, that’d fail immediately. The fact is, and it’s proven, we can MOVE Biden, we can’t move Trump. Go for the chance greater than 0 and vote down the ballot for the progressives there. Be smart
No progressive is happy about the Democratic ticket, and it fucking hurts that we were all so excited for Bernie to sweep the primary. It didn’t happen, but we have gotten further than we ever have before. Don’t give up the momentum we’ve gained just to spite Biden!
Learn to prioritize. Right now our chief priority should be removing Trump, hindering that goal is destructive to all our other priorities. Once Trump is out we can focus more securely on giving Biden and Harris heartburn for not being progressives. Priorities people.
I wrote a whole Facebook thing last year but don’t want to share it on Facebook cuz I saw mean things about Biden—basically it was this: “Biden isn’t gonna energize anything. KAMALA WILL! She needs tobe our pick!” I was right. What I wasn’t expecting was her making HIM exciting!
We know China is rooting for Biden.  Hunter is gonna make a killin if daddy wins.
So Biden wants masks for the next three months. What is happening in three months? The election!  Stop making the Corona virus political.
They are out of cards and ironically Biden/Harris have trumped Trump lol
That 4.7% was all that was left after all the others had run through their unemployment. The total number of people out of work because the the Obama/Biden administration was the part at a 30 year high. You need to dig deeper.
a spring. His campaign had been spied on and the biggest frame job ever perpetrated against them.  And then Obama's lieutenant Joe Biden went and picked you, an outright Socialist/Comunist. The UNITED STATES does not need you or sleepy Joe. And that is why you loose November. Bye
If America has had “systemic racism” from the beginning, how come you Obama and Biden did nothing about it during your 8 years? You Obama stoked the fires of racial hatred and racism during your 8 years! Your unhelpful comments on Trayvon Martin &amp; Mike Brown before all .../2...
This USPS issue is important enough for Biden and Kamala Harris to take on and apply pressure from their point of view.
Biden didn't pick her his handlers did. Democrats know dementia Joe won't last 4 years
And if you're a Biden voter, you don't have to worry either, as a special service will be held for him that will take place in March or October, he hasn't quite figured it out yet... Little kids are appreciated in lieu of anything else... Fuckin pedos
A (D) poll has Biden up by 6, a (R) poll has Biden up by 12. Makes sense
I bet the Biden administration wont kill
Keep telling yourself that. This economy booming was all Trump. Nothing OBAMA/Biden related at all. The crash....i think you know why it crashed, nothing to do with Trump. It’s on the rebound already
worked so hard to divide our nation’s emotions. The man ended up dividing his own party. Republicans are now committing to voting for Biden/Harris - 2020, because they understand it is the moral conscience of humanity who sees through Trump’s lack of leadership.
And Biden isn’t, and most of Washington, Hollywood... ?
I forgot that Biden and Harris can start getting briefings now. That may change the game.
2020 sucks, but making us cap it off with deciding between Joe Biden and Donald Trump just doesn’t seem fair man.
Technically, the first State of the Union speech by President Biden wouldn't be until Jan or Feb 2022. The first address of a newly inaugurated POTUS is just an address to a joint session of Congress, not an official SOTU. A lot can happen in a year and a half 😁😁
Yes !! Made me feel so much better the future.  Biden and Kamala as a pair seems balanced and competent and safe
It's not that high. 5% difference in the popular vote would be a large Biden EC win. Trump's 2% deficit last time in 2016 is probably close to the limit given how close the swing states were.
Biden's not in office yet, silly!
Honestly, I agree. Yeah Biden sucks but I'd rather vote for him than have Trump in office again. People are acting like there's another choice but unfortunately there's not and we need to face that reality. That doesn't mean we can't fight for change at the same time tho ✨
I’m so excited about Biden/Harris2020. I’m in Ohio(important state) My voice has NEVER BEEN HEARD! My story is UNBELIEVABLE! You 2 or u zoom me or visit me, and fight for ME! I BELIEVE in you both. Please don’t let me down!!
Funny how President Biden finished every sentence while Trump read from notes for half an hour, the same notes he read yesterday without raising his head. He is a energy on sleeping pills.
Biden/Harris2020 are going to Unite this Country!! We need to quit this racism BS! We are all one race, the Human Race❤️❤️
Wait so you think joe biden is a better option? you’re lyin
When McKinley was assassinated Teddy became President, the same thing could happen if Biden becomes incapacitated for mental health issues. The only difference is McKinley and Teddy were republicans.
She had my support... and still does!  Along with Biden!  You’re going home dude.. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Nice try Bill.  Busy trying to hide Biden’s dementia much?
That is a straight lie. Biden and his running mate are poised to divide this country even further and run it into the ground purposefully. Really who choses an ex-cop for a VP during THIS TIME. They are playing with our morals. 😒😒😒
Yeah! Biden/Harris 2020!
CPH congratulates Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. sister Kamala Harris on her selection as the VP running mate for Joe Biden! We know our NPHC sisters must be so proud. 💗💚
Hopefully the Biden/Harris administration will honor him by finally fighting climate change.
Hey I did sign it but I was duped, shucks the signature gatherer said it was a petition for Minnie to be Biden’s running mate
It's going to be irritating to listen to these talking heads criticize Biden and Harris when they have Satan and Casper Milktoast that have killed 162,000 of our people due to their arrogance and ignorance.
Biden’s connection is that he ain’t trying to kill us!! Trump’s podium hugging propaganda rallies have opened a greater divide in this country.

Biden/Harris is the BEST TICKET since Obama/Biden! I Love her❤️❤️👍🏼👍🏼! It’s time to make the world take the USA seriously again. Biden/Harris have the Class,Experience,and PROFESSIONALISM 2 make that happen🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Best ticket since Obama/Biden!!
This is CNN reporting from the latest Joe Biden for President rally outside his home.  Hundreds of thousands are here in his garage. There is also maybe two dozen people attending.   Biden calls the rats on the floor as his pets and declares they will run his campaign for 2020.
The silent majority better SCREAM in November.  We do not need biden harris anywhere near the white house. #trump2020
. needs to spotlight Nasty Woman perfume oil again. This time have the proceeds go to the Biden campaign 😂😂😂😂
Wow! Joe Biden goes against the grain. When the majority of Dems are against heavy handed policing, he goes and picks a heavy handed cop as a running mate.  I guess he's hoping to pick up more law &amp; order Rs than the base he's alienating.
Biden/Harris 2020!! YES! YES! YES! YES!
I hope you and all your followers will join us older Americans in voting for this great ticket; BIDEN-HARRIS!!!   Just think what they can get done in Biden’s 8 years then her 8 years!!!
Yes!!!!! Joe Biden Names Kamala Harris as VP Pick - WSJ
If Trump is having a press conference Biden should wait until then and upstage him.
Nice. When you google “joe Biden vp pick”, a Tr*mp ad is the first thing to show up...
Can Joe Biden talk for more than 2 minutes before saying something wrong or saying something he has to try to walk back or saying something that makes no sense? Only one person was perfect - Jesus Christ. So, what’s your excuse? You are NOT perfect! Shame on you for criticizing!

Have you heard something about her  unfollowing Biden’s campaign? It’s probably just bitchy gossip
That's for a male born today. Life expectancy for a man already 77 like Biden is would be about 86 or 87. The commonly quoted life expectancy number is always for someone born today, with that number being an average that gets lowered by the effect of some children dying.
Few really care who he chooses as VP because it's all about Biden is sane and Trump isn't.
So Biden ”better” chose a black woman? I'm not opposed to the choice, but if you alienate one gender, and alienate other ethnic groups, then are you really getting the best person for the job of VP?  #politicallyhomeless
DEMAND THE DEBATE COMMISSION to move the first Presidential debate to the FIRST week of Sept. Why are they covering for Joe Biden?? Pre Trump wants your input. #LeadRight
I was just ear raped by Biden.😣
Makes no difference....Biden!!!
I take it seriously.   Under President Kamala, Brown would be seen as the Wise Old Man,  a national figure of a sort. He's signalling to old man Biden not to trust his protege. That says something.
Sort of like Woodrow Wilson. Crash, bash and burn Biden.
The Debate Commission is co-conspiring with the radical Dems to keep Joe Biden hidden in his basement until 09/29. GET HIM OUT &amp; onto the debate stage NOW. Sign the petition. #LeadRight
This is reason enough NOT to vote for Biden.
California is still gonna vote Biden by 25+ points
You’re right...Trump could very well lose the election.  Depends on the get out the vote efforts by the Republicans.  If Biden wins though, I’d have to question the cheating efforts by the Dems.  Most Secretaries of State are Dems thanks to Soros campaign backing.
If your platform was fully embraceable Bernie would be the nominee, as it is they are supposedly working together and Biden’s positions have shifted to the left
If Kanye is on the Wisconsin ballot and gets 20k votes and Biden loses the state by less than 20k and the EC to Trump - I will punch every third party voter in the throat until I’m pushing up daisies
Trump is being used to get us to accept a pos like Biden, won't happen. Policy or not getting my vote PERIOD.
Joe Biden is a creep!
Biden couldn't win a boobie prize.
Today is my birthday. Wish me a happy birthday by saying you will vote for Joe Biden on Nov 3rd.
These are the kinds of people Democrats praise and won’t criticize? Is this what America would be like under Joe Biden? Why doesn’t Biden condemn these anarchists and bullies, and support the police in locking them up?
Because Biden is a yes man to the corporate powers. Bernie was not. Smear the good (for the people/planet) prop up the bad (for the corporations at the expense of the people/planet) in our system.
ABC NBC CBS - Tell the truth! STOP EDITING JOE BIDEN’s real ugly comments about Black Americans! Black Americans need to know what he said about them!
Take a trip to Venezuela please, then you'll see what Joe Biden wants for America
I’m supposed to get a text once Biden announces his VP pick so I should stop clutching the phone and put it down because Murphy’s law and I should get a life. #Biden #BidenVP I’m ready!
Biden needs to announce his VP pick already. It’s gonna be Kamala Harris, everyone knows it, just make it official already.

Joe Biden knows when his Bible is right side up.Rashida Talib already said that Biden is “moveable”.
Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, your daughter just announced her support for Biden/Harris!😂😂
Hmmm, Biden never apologize for his stunning praise filled eulogy for KKK Robert Byrd who by the way never apologized for his past KKK proud participation. But I guess as long as he is a Democrat he gets a pass
let’s see, Biden supports un restricted abortion. He supports Christians being forced to pay for abortions. He supports the abolition of private health insurance. Biden is a China syncophant. The Chinese government is aggressively eliminateting all religion including Christianity
At least Biden can use one hand to drink a cup of water.
Exactly what I’m saying!!!! Use your vote for where it counts!! On Biden! Maybe one day the United States will be more than just a two party system and parties such as the Green Party will finally have a chance on the national stage but that day is not today. Vote blue.
Further Trump is a champion for the unborn. while abortion is rampant in this country there can be no real “social justice”. He is also a champion for religious liberty. You’ve got your priorities screwed up buddy.There is a reason Biden’s bishop refused him communion
I already wear a mask willingly. My state requires it in public places. But, why wear one out mowing my lawn. If mandated to that extent I would flat refuse to wear one. KMA Baby Biden. Girly Guy.
Keep working towards the top...McCabe, Comey, Biden, &amp; Obama!
Soon as Biden named Kamala Harris as VP, a whole bunch of fake woke niggas got exposed.
Hey Buck, Biden told us he doesn’t care about our rights when he made this proclamation so why would he care about the constitution?
Biden is out foxing Trump into taking his bait and favoring ridiculous position opposed by most Americans. Brilliant.

Hard left will do anything to get rid of our real leader. They fear this red repeat map more than God. God will decide leadership over Biden/Kamala anti God  stance.
Talking about Pelosi and Biden again?
Biden and Harris proved it doesn’t take a rally to deliver a big message
I’m sorry but we need to be realistic. I support what they stand for but the Green Party will never get close to the number of votes it needs to matter. What they will do is take away votes we may need for Biden/Harris. They may not be the one’s we want, but they’re what we need.
Is it true your daughter endorsed Biden/Harris, rudy?
Vote trump or you’ll get Kamala Harris! If creepy Biden gets in, he’ll last about a year before he resigns
Talked to a old friend today. He's s independent. Said he most likely will vote Biden. Says he doesn't mind information tweets but hates the negative attack tweets. i knew that was a problem.
I get it. She’s not perfect and she made mistakes but if she and Biden win she can do some serious good in this country to make up for them
Just a reminder to everyone that a vote for anyone but Biden and Kamala is a vote for Trump and his campaign of hate
I preferred Harris to Biden for president and I think it’s possible Joe is pulling a Weekend At Bernies so I’ll end up getting my wish..
Ok your point is taken. And his criminal bill went too far. However you didn't live on Inglewood Ca when the bloods and crops started. Why? No jobs, Reagan. Bad schools Clinton and rampant murder. Biden at least tried to stop the carnage. Misguided yes. But no racial division.
I think you and I will strongly disagree on the goals/aims of the liberal establishment and who Biden would surround himself with were he elected, as well as what's needed re: police reform, but I can agree that we would be better off with less identity politics of all varieties.
..."conservatives and libertarians who don't identify as Republicans," because Biden has been courting his ideological foes and working with them for as long as he's been in politics. He's the poster child for moderate, establishment liberalism, not the old man version of AOC.
Even a Bernie nomination wouldn't have appeased the loudest progressives haha. But saying Biden/Harris has only pandered to the far left is categorically false, and this is coming from a moderate liberal haha. I think you're conflating "moderates" with...
Get her and Biden tf outta here

You really need to get glasses biden is way ahead of you clown
Is he confusing Biden for McCain even though that was 2012...no wait that was 2008!
He might want to check first with Pope Francis who has served Joe Biden Communion and believes Joe is a good Catholic. Pope Francis understands the distinction between your faith as a Catholic and your duty to uphold the laws of the US.
Nail that exam!! #Biden - Harris!!!
Might want to check in with Pope Francis who not only believes Joe Biden is a good Catholic, but has also served him Communion.
So, no, M4A isn’t the most popular health reform plan out there. The one Biden is running on and put in the platform is.
Um, no, it was also this which unlike the Hill Poll tested both proposals and (like Silver noted in 2019) found Biden’s approach more popular than M4A. Read what people cite then comment next time:
Except you weren’t. I’m sorry, but what you just said isn’t factually accurate. Biden’s “Medicare for the those who want/public option” polled better then M4A, every time.  That’s why he won.
I’m elated to see a Biden/Harris ticket!  Great choice Joe!
Biden is a Catholic.
Yeahhhhhhhh, Biden Harris 2020
You are right. That was misleading. I agree with what you tweeted. He is a Putin apologist. I didn't clarify that. I just made point that he is the type that make up lies about Biden. Sorry about that. At least that was my intent. I rather botched it up however.
Just want to advertise her that way.  Same as labeling Biden liberal leftist, which would be news to me.
Men have never been as genuinely gracious and publicly supportive of a former rival as every other woman Biden considered has already been to Harris.
Congratulations Senator Harris... If there were ever a time where your country needs you and VP Biden, that time is now!!! #BidenHarris2020
Madam Ambassador,  we still you in the Biden/Harris cabinet.  You are too valuable to not be used in a very important capacity.. #NoVoteNoVoice
picks  "Lipstick.on a pig"!....  "A step backwards for Women"...Joe Biden
If he were to win, Biden would be wise to populate his cabinet and advisors with many progressive-minded individuals, and I think he will. But the whole "Kamala is a cop!" thing is literally only an issue on red rose twitter. For the average American, she's a solid pick.
Tulsi Gabbard was a non factor. Her poll numbers went down because Biden and others went up. Gabbard has nothing to do with it.
You’ve been trying that all summer on Biden, too. It doesn’t work. The GOP is going to lose and it richly deserves to.
Because they want to attract more GOP members to vote for Biden. Seriously, you can’t figure that out?
So, the opposite of Biden.
Kamala Harris scheduled to speak right before the Biden family and Joe Biden.....
If this were the current Trump campaign, not only would we know the pick. But we’d know who in the inner cycle was for it and who advised against and the shameless act of pandering the nominee did to flatter Trump.  Team Biden? Nothing.
It’s pretty incredible where a two-point change that still shows a double digit lead is presented as “tightening” of race. Trump’s biggest advantage is media will handicap Biden now to try to bring it back into a horse race.
You’re ignoring that polling shows Biden’s plan is even more popular when polled against M4A. People have only been pointing that out for over a year.
Trump doesn’t have senior moments. Biden has senior eternities!
I’m always going to hope, but I feel as if it’s a bit on the edge of pandering.  I don’t want to think it but I have that feeling in my stomach , that woman’s intuition thing, gnawing at me that nothing will happen before the election.Then, what if Biden wins?  Bad news for us☹️
Biden/Beatty has a nice rhythm to it.  has the Congresswoman been to DE recently?
So Biden will be in attendance. Great news. Doubt he will invite Putin.
NY Times reports that  is likely to announcing his running mate pick as early as tomorrow to Wednesday:
Some of y’all really sick in the head to think that 1. Kanye would make a good president. And 2. That Kanye even intends on becoming president. He is doing this to pull votes away from Biden!!! He has no intention of winning. He is in league with Trump.
show this to CNN reports in a president and ask if they covered this.
What fake CNN won't report.
Some folks claim that Harris was too aggressive in the debate with Biden. But think of a debate between her &amp; Pence. She will demolish his sanctimonious butt.

Yet another example of why  owes  a public apology for criticizing Biden for saying Trump night try to steal the election:
Today: - Did call time in the morning to fund GOTV - Manned the office this afternoon to start handing out Biden yards signs (got unsolicited $ from that)  - Communicated with campaigns on updates on GOTV plan. - Did some emergency light plumbing in HQ. (No really.)

Whitmer is a popular governor in a state that voted for trump last time.  Ohio and Wisconsin are near bye.  Biden will win California no matter what happens.
Trump on preexisting conditions EO: “It’s never been done before....” Except as statutory law by Obama/Biden that Trump has sued to invalidate... repeatedly.
If you want to vote for an established racist (Biden) that’s your choice. Just like it’s my choice not to.
I'm still voting for Biden lol I didn't even think it was bad
Trump is in electoral hot water. It could be even worse for him by November
Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’
So rude!  I’m insulted and I’m not even black!!  Biden is a lost cause🤷‍♀️
You’re missing the context of this coming right off the heels of Biden working with Sanders on an unity platform only to have folks like Nina then publicly whip against its passage. I’m tired of seeing us reaching out and constantly getting spat in the eye publicly like this.
Emphasis on push, not dictate, especially when you didn’t get the votes. Making the VP a red line is an insult to all the other things Biden has already done with Sanders to bring the party together. Nina Turner is a bad spokesperson for Bass after what she said this week, too.
Trump INHERITED a strong economy from Obama/Biden, it weakened every year until he absolutely imploded it this year. You have the worst job record of any President in modern times. Record breaking drops in GDP group. This thread is absolute nonsense.
I saw a report that Kanye isn’t the one putting his name on the ballot in battleground states but rather Trump lawyers and supporters are actually doing it to draw votes away from Biden. Complete crap! 😡
'Blatant disrespect of Black women': Women leaders criticize treatment of Black women being considered as Biden VP pick  via
Your ignorance is appalling. Biden is personally against abortion. That is well documented. As VP or POTUS he is obligated to follow US laws. Even Pope Francis recognizes this distinction and believes Biden is a good Catholic. Your “beef” is with Congress, not Biden.
How long is a day? Still 24 hours right? Joe Biden has promised to do about 25 things on day one in office. He wouldn't get into office until the afternoon. Dummy
Dear Joe Biden. I saw your racist remarks on Black Diversity. But, my question is Where in Sam Hill is Irizona?
If Biden can destroy God, then Trump should give up, unless he believes he is more powerful than God. But that would be blasphemy.
Trump says that Biden is against God because Trump thinks he is a god.
His wife did a good job with this tweet. There’s no way on God’s green earth he wrote this. Too late though. People are finally realizing how racist Biden is.
It matters. Biden isn’t evil. Vote.
Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden via
Thats why he'll be locked up for tyranny, treason and violating his oath of office. No political will get away with that or not for long. Ohio will never comply with Biden and hopefully all states refuse to comply.
get off the fence, Meghan, and show some respect for your father.  Endorse Biden and help get rid of trump.
In the past 48 hours alone, we’ve seen Trump campaign misappropriate a picture of  in prayer for a sleezy attack ad and Trump question Biden’s personal religious faith. These are new lows in politics. Trump should not be lying and attacking  religious faith.
Biden is a devote Catholic and has been his whole life. He has even met with Pope Francis a number of times to discuss policy and has received Communion from Pope Francis. Who should I believe, the Pope or Trump?

Wow. The arrogance it takes to make a statement like this after the GOP has created the largest deficit in the history of the US, put the US into a deep recession, and cost the US millions of jobs. Biden rescued the US economy once before. He can do it again.
Just a friendly reminder that Trump's administration has done more to "infringe" on your second amendment rights in 3 1/2 years then the Obama/Biden administration did in 8 years.
