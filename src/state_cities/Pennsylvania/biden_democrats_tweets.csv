Someone said other VP candidates were dropping oppo on Bass.  But I'm convinced team Biden is doing it after building her up so that it looks like they have no choice but to make "safe" pick in Harris.
You did not beat Obama, you didn't even beat Biden. Obama would have cleaned your clock far worse than Biden will. Resign already!
Biden’s are made up Bunker boy’s are legit. Sorry booboo
There is absolutely no evidence that Joe Biden wants to pursue a radical extremist agenda or would rubber-stamp it if Congress decided to. This argument just doesn't hold up to scrutiny.
Kamala’s intellect and “rubbing people the wrong way” is exactly why she should be VP. She’ll mop the floor with Pence during the VP debate. She fills in the gaps of Biden’s weaknesses with her strengths. They’d be a formidable force.
The left is threatening to continue burning down our cities if we dont elect Biden.  If that doesnt get your goat you will LOVE living in a Communist country
#FiredUpReadyForJoe  To Make His VP Announcement
MORE LIES FROM TRUMP. Joe Biden never said he wanted to defund the police. BTW YOUR CAMPAIGN ADS ARE STUPID. All you do is lie and everyone knows it. JOE BIDEN HAS GREAT ADS! Do you know why they’re great? Because what he says is true! HE’S JUST A GREAT GUY AND YOU ARE A FAKE.
Biden Campaign Whittles VP Shortlist Down To Either Woman Or Man With Long Hair  via
Trump is setting up his exit left announcement. He’s already canceled advertising. And now he’s doubling down saying mail voting won’t be safe and true. So he’s gonna let Biden win and run again in 2024. You were right Cenk
Hey, FDL.... we believe biden has potential !🤣🤣🤣
Biden Goes Into Blank Stare After Forgetting Where He Is, Tries and Fails To Pass It Off as Joke
Only deficits under Democratic administrations are bad.  The GOP deficits are patriotic.  Need to get rid of the filibuster because the GOP will use deficits as an excuse to block any Biden initiative that requires investment.
It's a good thing Joe Biden isn't ambitious.
Because he's doing it again with Biden.
Obama isn't running for president. After a two term, 8 years, Scandal Feee, time in the White House, he's backing Joe Biden, and warning, as are literally thousands of people, many of who were part of Trump's Administration, in strongest words, about the Danger Trump poses to USA
I’ve donated, attended online events and celebrated a few of his policies, but if Biden continues this he will get no more help from me outside of my vote. The welcoming of Kasich and the comments of Dodd shows they are not understanding this moment - at all.
I am so so riled up about this. The fact that Biden has these assholes in his inner circle making decisions about the campaign is absolutely disgusting. And the fact that it has ended up in multiple news outlets makes it worse.
Has Biden gone blind?
Serious question. What happens when Biden drops out after accepting the party nomination? Does the party get to name another candidate, like say Cuomo or does it fall back to who held the second most delegates being Sanders?
I can’t take much more of his BS. We have suffered from day one from his whining, me me me, everyone else is crap pretense of a POTUS. He needs to shut up. I’m saying if Biden doesn’t win then  WE need to protest the election. No way that many people want 4 more years of this
You know what?  Americans have suffered from day one of his ridiculous pretense of playing POTUS. We have suffered ENOUGH. Too much. So he can forget this BS. If Biden doesn’t win WE WILL PROTEST THE OUTCOME. Because we can’t take any more of him. He needs to shut up &amp; go away.
It's just the same old Conspiracy Theory crap!  Gotta scare (fear monger) the Trump base to get votes.  PS. Joe Biden does *not* want to defund the police and has never said a single thing in support of it.
BIDEN WILL LOSE#EvictTrump
Yes, it’s going to take years to unfuck everything. But Biden alone doesn’t matter. Getting both the House and Senate majority matters, saving SCOTUS matters, and they’ll pull him leftward. Warren has already been doing it.
With luck (and all hands on deck in November) 2022 should be Biden's America, not Trump's.
Are you going to be this boisterous when Biden is President?
You nailed it. Looks like dems are trying to get ahead of the Biden Ukraine crap so he may need a different October surprise.
maybe, but I'd bet less than you think. I think its a real short list of folks who are on the fence with Biden but would be swayed by VP. Most folks on the left at this point know either they won't be feeding the machine or they can't sit by with Trump as the opponent.
It will be such a landslide for Biden that you will absolutely know on election night.
Yeah, man, why didn't Joe Biden send in the National Guard?  He really fell asleep at the Not His Job Right Now.
lol 17...7302020...  ...Donald J Trump - He Doesn't Give A Fuck About You!...  ...Don't Be Fooled...Trump Will Try Everything He Can To Discredit This Election...We Will Make Him Leave...  ...VOTE BIDEN VOTE BLUE!...    #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath  #FuckingMoron
Obama and the Dems seem to be running scared. He had eight years to do any of this but didn’t even try. Now he’s says this is what needs to get done as if Biden will ever get it done.
It’s a Biden campaign ad.
I am using Biden so that I can understand why there is seemingly a disconnect here.
B/c Biden will be at a mass gathering where there essentially is no social distancing.  Yet, Mr. Biden is staying in his basement because of social distancing.  But the protesters do not socially distance and you claim there's no spike.  Do you understand the conflict now?
Assuming you statement is accurate, then it can only logically (and scientifically) assumed that there now exists no material impediment for Mr. Biden to be physically present at his political rallies and speeches.  If not, why not (i.e.please distinguish).
Ass Cavuto  pandering  to Biden and Obama
Was this a eulogy???? Or a commercial for Biden?
Jill Biden told Pittsburgh-area educators Tuesday that if her husband were already president, he would have had a plan to safely reopen schools. Teachers told her in a virtual call that they don’t feel safe going back to classrooms.

he is desperate and he is now trying to make it crash and burn and this will enrage him more and and people are and more will see how crazy he is.  now he is seeing that biden is thinking about harris a non appointee.  he is scared as a little child!
As of today, we now know trump is desperate and salty due to biden winnng the polls and his polling averages were oversampled/overpolled and didnt actual real primary elections his actual vote count was worse than any poll.
This is mainly who I am taking about. He is on the selection committee. He has been named in most of the leaks. So yes, surrogates. Donors going to donor, but to say they don’t have some control over this is false.

Well soon be reliving 1968 all over again - riots at Democrat convention. Biden will Be remembered &amp; set history as the man who lost by more votes than George McGovern 1972.
Still believe that Biden will not 'physically' attend &amp; will accept the nomination 'virtually' or some such shit.
all these dems/commies &amp; media clowns/experts saying President Trump is in a fight w/ Biden for Texas are fucking clueless.
Why did number 4 bring Biden’s second VP choice, her mother-in-law and her nail stylist to the polling station?
Great question! And why are #democrats so angry about Trump enforcing laws that Obama/Biden made happen? #VoteGold #JoJorgensen2020 #JoJo2020 #JoNotJoe #NeverBiden
A day after BlabberBuzz exclusively reported on a comprehensive online poll that showed Trump securely ahead of Biden for the Nomination, the  #RonaMcDaniel cited some of the same findings and agreed that ‘enthusiasm for Trump, is greater than for Biden.’
No way  can you choose who you want to ..Don't you know that by now.. You would have forgotten who you chose anyway.
I wonder if this is why there’s suddenly been so much chatter about Susan Rice lately. Maybe  ’s moving steadily closer to choosing Harris and people around him are frantically searching for a “break glass in case of emergency” option to derail it

In November I may not be outside in bare feet and shorts, but I will be doing this exact dance if Joe Biden is declared the winner. Shortly after polls close, BTW, in a landslide.
I don’t know who will be selected as the Democrat VP pick, but I’m certain of one thing. Joe Biden won’t be making that choice. He’s owned by the radical Left.
Exactly what this country would have back again, dimwitted schmuck biden, couldn't lead flies to a hog lot. the 8 years of these 2 douche-nozzles couldn't end quick enough.

Trying to sell Biden as a left-wing nut is nuts.
believe the last time Texas voted blue in a GE, was for Carter in '76, the State remedied that idiotic mistake, by helping Reagan win by a landslide in '80. Only an imbecile and/or dem/commie (I repeat myself) would believe Biden has a shot at taking #RedStateTexas
Biden slams Trump for promoting false COVID-19 claims from 'crazy woman'
Hmmm....Someone that said “racial jungle” is gonna do all of that?  Who ever is writing these needs to have a Joe Biden history lesson. Don’t worry, WE REMEMBER what he said and REALLY meant.
Biden- Rioters, protestors, anarchists, antifa, BLM, socialism   Trump- Police, military, Patriots, law and order, constitution and capitalism   Easy choice!!
Biden has already proven that he won’t be able to keep us safe without copying ideas from someone else (COVID-19 ring a bell?) What’s gonna happen when he has to come up with his OWN ideas for what we need for today’s market?  No thanks.
Absolutely! Mail in voting is exactly what the Deamoncrats want. Allowing them to change the vast majority of the votes over to the deamoncratic candidates. Once Biden is replaced as their candidate, odds are they will replace him with one of the hateful 4 unAmerican scam squad.

See, they are able to continue this cultist belief system because they know Biden will win in November, and then, when he does, they can say "Trump didn't get to finish his plan before he was forced to leave office by The Cabal".  It's a perfect plan.
Thoughts and prayers.
Don't hold back, tell us what you really think about Biden.
The Biden q&amp;a was orchestrated and leads one to believe he is incapable of handling unscripted questions.
Burn to the ground and Biden becomes President. That in not acceptable.
Biden is a seriously ill brain dead puppet. This can be said of all elected Democrats. They vote in lockstep. The only ideas they have  party gives to them.
I’m convinced Biden was selected knowing he’s brain dead. The plan is to replace him at the convention. Wait for it...
That's why I am not voting for Joe Biden!
Joe Biden is not!
Good thing Biden is making the choice and not "fans."
Yeah cause you won't get a coherent sentence with Biden
This is Nate's I need to cover my ass tweet in case things dramatically change in the race (which it will). We all know that by end of September the polls will narrow again as right leaning INs come home. Making it a 3-5 point Biden lead, making pop vote (solid D) and EC (lean D)

Right there with you exactly! I thought, yes, either Harris or Warren. However now, there are some other really amazing women who have "shown up'; in the candidate group. Any choice he makes will be great by me! One thing about Joe Biden; he knows how to Govern!#StrongerTogether
Bs. I’m a Warren democrat and I’m voting for Joe Biden no matter who he chooses. This is pure silliness.
Sir, the momentum is starting, but time is short. Might I suggest slogans.   "America, I'm Here For It!"   Or   "Biden - My Time!"   Something of that nature. Snappy.

Not a lie but a vision.of life under the leftists world of Biden wins.
Biden Won't Pardon Trump and His Corrupt Loyalists   Justice is coming for them   I can't wait until we never see a MAGA hat again.
Wait.  will replace Biden at the convention. News ALERT! Biden ill!  Who will replace him?
I personally would love to see them arrested, handcuffed, and thrown into small cells right now, however, it's just as you said, and said so well. Biden can "walk and chew gum" (walk down ramps and drink with 1 hand too). But, yeah, enough sickness, death and F'n idiocy!  TY🙏👏
But, you're right. It is pathetic. All I can recommend is Vote Blue everywhere, Biden of course! and down ballot all the way. Biden Administration won't pardon after the Investigations (and those won't be based on debunked Conspiracy Theories like the F'n GOPs!)  Justice delayed
and no Joe Biden isn't cutting it ha ha
Biden will since you wrecked it.
IMO I think Biden is waiting until John Lewis is laid to rest.

Biden cody's everything Trump did with the coronavirus. He says he'd  do the same thing, listen to him.
But just saw you are in NY, so it really doesnt matter..  Biden has already won NY so you can excercise your voting rights guilt free as it wont change election.
I can understand not liking Biden and not voting for him, but are you voting Trump?
Ha, no, they have been given the best hand ever. I think people in Biden's campaign are waking up to the fact that by the end of September many right leaning independents will go back to Trump regardless of Covid. So the Doc is right, they have to be clever to keep the senor vote

Lmao...no it is not. How many Biden signs have uou seen... zilch. Look at viter registrations across the country, they show you are very wrong.
Do I think Biden’s the answer? Hell no. But I know for a fact that 4 more years of a president that’s a sociopath with the temperament of a 12yr old, isn’t made for this. Tax cuts for the rich while we need extra to survive because billionaires need more. Right.
Biden isn't worthy of being on the same stage as President Trump  before there's a "debate" why not get the two together onstage together &amp; do an hour long "cognitive" test, giving each the same questions.
Grow up. He is the DEM candidate. It’s Biden or Trump. Let’s not have a rerun of 2016.

Biden said about Obama in 2007! Do you want anything more racist than this? "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who isarticulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." In other words, " You're not dirty, dumb, ugly!"

Didn’t trump just get an award for criminal justice reform while Biden put thousands in jail with his crime bill
You have a valid point, I am not sure this election will end on Election Day...possibly not even on the Inauguration of hoping Joe Biden. Trump has a lot to lose and he doesn’t care how he stays in the game.
When Biden said this about Obama in 2007 : ' I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man.' He said, in order words, that Blacks were dirty, ugly, dumb...Wow! Not racist?

Everyone knows about the old crime bill he supported. Things change and in hindsight the bill was wrong. Biden learns from his mistakes unlike the orange clown who will continue to fail.
Problem is that Trump has lowered the expectations for Biden so much that all Biden needs to do in the 1st debate is show up and not drool to win.
There's alot who follow Trump just to harass him, so that 82 million is not necessarily his supporters. Democrats don't like Biden but you can bet they'd go out and vote for a dog with rabies in November just to get Trump out.
Waiting for next year so Biden can clean it up.
On January 20th he would be escorted from the White House by the military. That's what Biden has said.

Fairly certain that  and  are running the Biden campaign at this point.
i just saw someone post on facebook talking about how hes voting for kanye because he has 21 Grammys and neither trump nor biden have ever talked shit about a Kardashian... i actually felt my brain cells burn off just by reading that 🥴
Dude said God will protect America like we aren’t sinning at 100 mph! God ain’t heard a word he said! He dang sure don’t care about the left, right, trump or Biden! American is a melting pot for sin and will be destroyed  without repentance! I see he didn’t mention that though!
Mr. Biden claims support of “human rights”, to free a Muslim Botherhood terrorist, being held for punishment for his evil acts, while encouraging the new “Caliphate” to spread chaos in the Middle East, following the same Obama’s miserable and evil policy. 2/3
I never mentioned a word about Biden.  The concern and focus should remain on our president.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden is going to crash soon! Trump is going to win be "default!"
There won’t be a plan. We have to save ourselves by voting. Joe Biden will have to do it.
But not voting for Biden so we get 4 more years of Trump- will fix which one of those issues? Asking for a friend.
Your images here are Trumps America not Biden’s so this is Trump’s lack of leadership that is causing the current mess...Trumps mess.
Oh- so you think Bernie wants Trump to win?  Because, not supporting Biden- will make it more likely we will have real Social Change?  I was standing next to Bernie the day he decided to run in 2015 with 30 people in the room.  I bet Bernie will vote for Biden- you wanna bet $25?
The only think Biden has in common with millenials is they both live in the basement

If Trump is a noted rapist then the same is true for Biden, because accusations mean guilt right? And where did I ever defend Trump, for the umpteenth time, you keep interjecting your boogeyman.

Wow- Trump's America-  Vote for Biden- get rid of the Lying Fascist
Uh, you support Biden who is accused of the sexual assault including penetrating and he refuses to allow anyone to access his files in the library of Delaware. Plus there are myriad images and videos and accusations against him for improper touching...of children!
please dont kneecap biden who at least marketed his campaign better than you
Biden vs trump
The Nov vote is simply a referendum on trump. Are you better off than 4 years ago? Do the actions of the current WH agree with your vision of American and family values? Let's be clear, this is binary. Trump if yes, Biden if no. Anything else is trump vote in our electoral system
Cool  tool enables you to look up Biden v Trump donors in your ZIP code. Keep double tapping on the map to bring up your area.
America's greatest mistake would be electing Joe Biden or any other politician who puts other countries first, instead of the US and supports attacks on law enforcement!
they are patriots and they also discussed their plans after biden is elected, they are going to continue to fight disinfo and help us heal
Lol Bunker Biden...The deflection is so hard with people like you.
China IS responsible for infecting the ENTIRE world with the virus and you want to blame Trump??!! The economy was NEVER better before the virus hit and ONLY President Trump can bring it back. Name ONE thing Biden did to help Americans in his 50 yrs. Good luck with that.
On the other hand, Biden was good friends with Robert Byrd, a leader of the KKK. Don't be fooled by the MSM. Trump is NOT a racist.
He wrote and passed the "First Step Act" that helped many Blacks get released from prison. President Trump felt they were unfairly sentenced because they were unable to hire big name attorneys. Biden or Obama NEVER did any of this.
Biden IS a whiny bitch and his horndog son who impregnates women and then denies it should be castrated as well as any man who votes for this doddering old fool..#INSTABLOCKED
Mr. President, if Joe Biden becomes President in November, we will have to change the National Anthem to "Taps", not only for the death of the many lives being lost in Democratic-run cities, but also for the death of our Nation.

The NBA Commissioner knows that if Biden wins they can continue being supported by China. It’s horrific that neither the owners, coaches or players will comment about China and the slaughter of their own Citizens. Money has no conscience.

I agree 100%. Hardly any Biden signs in PA.
questions from reporters, as documented by Breitbart News.
some people are suggesting that Biden’s team is doing all they can to block him from having unfiltered interactions with the media.  Events from earlier this week seem to confirm these suggestions. On Tuesday, the 2020 Democrat nominee outrightly refused to answerAnd why hasn’t he and hillary been arrested?  We’ve had 2 do-nothing AGs. What a shame.   We have a President that want to drain the swamp but it runs too deep!  If Biden wins, there is no help for this once great sovereign republic.
Andy may have been Romney-Trump-Biden.  Was willing to support Trump in 2016 as a fellow Ivy grad (do you know Andy went to Cornell?), but is returning to the hometown kid now.
Writing Joe Biden speeches.
I think Biden picking someone that says they wont seek a presidential term is terrible. If Biden resigns/dies before 2024, the Dems are going to be fine with a lame duck president? And who would want to be that person's VP?
I think Phyllis and Kevin would change from Trump-Biden (Kevin only after Oscar spends months guilting him). Angela, Dwight and Ryan staying with Trump. Everyone else voted Hillary-Biden or didn’t vote.
yes i saw another biden ad on espn
joe biden is a rabid dog, he should be beaten to death with a stick
To be clear I'm not telling you that you have to vote Biden but I'm not going to trash people on the left who think having Biden in office would be less awful the having a fascist Trump administration that is still botching this pandemic responee.
Voting for Biden isn't an unreasonable position and I think he's fucking awful. If you think that somehow the DNC will all of the sudden betray their donors and support M4A to avoid losing the support of some on the left you're being naive. Not voting for them doesn't scare them.
Also, my sense is that the leaks about Kamala are from pro-Kamala people trying to embarrass Biden into picking her.
Michael is an Obama-Trump-Biden voter. He votes for Biden because he’s friends with Obama.
People shouldn’t be in the position of  choosing between the lesser of the evils. I hate Trump as much the next person, but I haven’t lost my objectivity as to what an awful person Biden is as well. Vote blue no matter who is the worst slogan ever.
Your non-vote will also make a difference.  And that difference could be between Trump winning or Biden winning.  Think about the impact of your non-vote.
You ran against Hillary Clinton! This time it's Joe Biden! You're Sundowning! Go to bed.
Well we now know where Hunter Biden is, just follow her.
Duuuude, ur crazy and that’s so freakin funny!  But wait, don’t worry, Antifa won’t attack the burbs until Biden/obama grabs vacant land and puts up free minority housing!    Get out the vote....TRUMP 2020!
This is how the VP process works. They always announce right before the convention. Like HRC, Biden is running a very traditional campaign.
Ryan tells people he's voting for Biden, tells himself he's going to vote for Howie Hawkins, but then forgets to vote.

Wait for investigative committees that will dig into this Presidency spring time of next year when Biden is elected. Then come back, tweet at me. Until then instead of calling me Dumb &amp; arguing w me, put ur money on Trump  he’s going off at +140. Have a nice evening.
Why in the world would Joe Biden pick Karen Bass? 90% of the country has no clue who she is &amp; Bass in her mid 60s. If I were him, and the Democrats, I would think about setting up the next candidate, because I doubt Biden will run for a 2nd term. Karen Bass won't be POTUS in 2024
Thanks for the tag Andy. Followed all. Keep up the good work. #FBR #StrongerTogether
She could sacrifice a lamb on an altar and I'd still vote Biden if she's VP.
Biden sincerely cares about ALL of America.  He is compassionate and believes in the Constitution.
Do your research. Obama and Biden had a 69 page pandemic plan that tRump threw out, along with firing the pandemic team. He has done nothing to help this country stop the spread of the virus and is a global embarassment.

Joe Biden's search for a running mate enters final stretch
Harris allies granted call with Biden campaign after Dodd blowup
Sir, I just can’t help but think these comments towards Harris by Biden’s ppl is more of indication he’s not going to put up with Harris’s online cult group and it’s shows she can’t control them at all. It’s like Bernie Bros and that’s what did Sanders with them.
Are you kidding me? Dont embarrass or insult the intelligence of Baron. I'm sure he is an amazing, smart, with-it kid.. there is no comparison.  Biden is definitely cognitively impaired.  Looks and sounds like some form of dementia
Did you see the spread between Bernie's general election Florida numbers and Biden's?
Given your political Inclinations that would make sense if Sanders were the nominee, but it’s Biden. We are not going to become Cuba. Not even close. A Republican Senate will try to do to Biden what they did to Obama. They will have learned absolutely nothing.

Joe Biden's doing so well at testing the resolve of any leftist even somewhat willing to vote for him that his camp threw a potential Scientologist VP pick into the mix just to blow up the experiment and end the suffering.

Defund means taking away funding they need to cover costs, and that is not what Biden or most Americans want. If your redirecting calls relating to nonviolent issues to a different force separate from the police, you can REDIRECT funding to support that.
Well, you may feel that way, but I have older family members who always vote and usually Republican.  They feel "safe" with Joe Biden.  They can't wait to vote for him so they feel better.  Can't he be a stepping stone to youth?  I think he can.

Obama's grandfather's record:   Joe's sons Beau &amp; Hunter both served (NG/Navy).   Took 2 minutes to fact check your dumb post. If you had spent 2 minutes, you'd have GOOD DIRT on Biden's son's military history, but 2 minutes is too much work for shitposting
Swerve everybody and get one with old biden instead
Biden IS the other choice.  You are right.
Yup.  Then a “bustling, heroic save of the economy by Biden” with +.1% SPX days, 1.50 rates, stagnating GDP and declining dollar
Mark this: the craziest part of Biden’s win in November won’t be the fact he won but the fact he will do virtually everything trump was already doing and regarded as a hero for it
With all respect, in 95 days we will have a chance to save our nation.  After that, you and Potus Biden will begin to heal this country.
Joe Biden doesn't want to defund the police. More GOP lies.
You are co-signing on all the people that will suffer under a Biden presidency. I'm not voting for either authoritarian corporatist because both of them are shitty people and as a non shitty person I have no interest in helping them do so.
Biden has dementia &amp; you’re backing him! Enough said.
I'm not voting for Biden because he's Biden not because he isn't Bernie, and no refusing to vote for corporate authoritarians does not make me a bad person. Your plain as day voter harassment however does make you a shitty person.
Karen Bass is a double whammy. She is a Castro-sympathizer and a Scientology supporter! Hell no! Joe Biden needs to pick Kamala or Susan Rice and stop with the reality TV antics!
But think about it. Why? Why them? They want to save the gop, they know if they can purge the trumpists they can “return to normal” (loud parts quiet again) and saddle joe biden with the burden of cleaning up this mess. The party would collapse under a second trump term (1/2)
So you don't care about the people that will suffer under a Biden regime?
Thank you sir! Let's hope Biden can build on this in 2021! United we stand!
Have you forgotten the Joe Biden/Tara Reid situation already?
. Biden Rule: "No Men Need Apply!"
I mean she didn't get any traction in her home state and she didn't even make it to Iowa... seems like a perfect pick for a candidate like Biden.
Joe Biden has always said he’s announce his VP pick early August. He’s never said otherwise, just because people insist on speculation, that’s not his problem.
Is this Trump being prepped for his lobotomy?  That’s the only thing that might save our nation until Joe Biden is elected.
I listed the three primary factors depressing turnout as Biden, his party, and Democratic voters like him. I never said no one is going to be voting for Biden I explained specifically why I believe the people who won't be voting for him aren't.

We are so blessed as a nation to have President Trump at the helm.   In these challenging times we can count on the proven leadership of President Trump!  Let's face it! Biden is a nightmare!  He's being exploited by the Democrats.  How shameful!
Facts don't care about your feelings. Have fun voting for Weekend at Biden's. He's a puppet for your communist party.
You lier the trump administration wants to give businesses millions and the people  1200 dollars come on can’t wait until november Biden all the way
Biden is within the margin of error in several swing states, no guarantee he wins.
I'm in the same boat. I think Dems win Loeffer and Ernst's seat. I just look forward to Nov 6 when McConnell asks why 'President Biden has let so many people die of Covid19 as president the American people expect more' and I turn into a nuclear blast from rage

Bombed Libya to point it turned into a failed state &amp; its citizens were sold into slavery. Armed terrorists to topple Assad in Syria, facilitated coup in Honduras. Among other BS, Biden has done almost nothing positive in 44 consecutive years in government.
Karen Bass will be 70 after Biden’s first term. That would put her at 78 if she wins and completes the next two terms as president. I want someone younger.
If you hate Trump- OK.. voting for Biden out of pure bias and no logic is a despicable act.
Educate yourself on Biden's 44 year record.
My god, Biden promised to pick a black woman as VP and people are STILL saying it needs to be Warren.
I hope this flies too. What I like here,  Trump's latest attacks on Biden are also the old ones that didn't work.

Here’s the thing. It’s not up to anyone but Joe Biden who he picks.
I’ve met Ed Rendell a few times. There are things I like about him. That being said, his opinion on Biden’s VP could not be much lower on the list of relevant viewpoints.
the Biden veepstakes are pretty telling I reckon. the guy is lazy and indecisive, his administration is liable to be a mess. good thing he doesn't have to deal with any big problems
I guess that means you are not Biden’s VP pick 😂😂😂😂

There have been several high profile dems that have said kamala is “too ambitious” amongst other things &amp; imho is getting treated unfairly by dems and press (like Hillary). Biden pushed back his vp announcement &amp; I hope he’s not taking this “too ambitious” nonsense into account.
Who should Biden pick for VP?
...Karen Bass (who they're really pushing in the trial balloons) or Susan Rice, who are both excellent but also I could see them drawing primary challenges from the Bernie/AOC left in 2024 (or '28 if Biden is feeling it). The Dems are still not "an organized political party"
I think Biden really thought he was picking Klob before the George Floyd protests blew up. Harris is the obvious choice except all the old men he listens to (and maybe his wife) think she's too "pushy." So now he's going to pick someone he's "comfortable" with, probably...
I’m an old white woman, who’s getting sick and tired of pundits denigrating old white men. I don’t like Harris, because of the stunt she pulled at the debate, With T-shirts waiting in the wings. I like Rice, but it’s Biden’s choice.

I respect Ed Rendell however I 100 percent disagree with him regarding Kamala Harris. I think she would be an excellent choice for VP. Anyone who Biden picks is a better option than Mike Pence. #KamalaHarrisForVP
If that was trump and not bill it would be on every channel. Even Cartoon Network would be talking about it. Since the girl said Trump never partaked though... they don’t care. Wait til Biden shows up in the papers.
It is a really bad look to lobby against Kamala Harris because she’s “too ambitious”. I’ve been donating regularly to the Biden campaign. Only good reason to oppose a pick is if it hurts the ticket.

Biden, who was elected to 7 terms (served 36 yrs. total) as a U.S. Senator, was in his 1st term in 1976.

Can't speak for  but I'm certainly hoping that, w/ or w/o a pre-election pledge to be 1-term, Biden realizes that he's not in shape to be president from age 78-82, and so 82-86 is out of the question. Need a VP who'll be ready to run w/ minimal primary oppo in '24
Ed Rendel going to the press smells of "If Biden won't listen to me, let's see if I can make some bad press to change his mind"

Democrat policies have destroyed cities around the nation!  Joe Biden's agenda would be highly destructive to our great nation!
I'm not saying I don't agree. I'm also in favor of a government public option like Biden wants. Trump doesn't want a public option and wants to take health insurance away from 20 million and remove protections for those with preexisting conditions. Biden is a much better choice

It would be cool to see Biden do a unity ticket and pick a moderate republican to be his VP. I know this is unlikely; it would bring the centrist moderates on both sides together (the majority imo), and broaden his base bc he’s already gaurenteed anyone on the left. #Biden2020

Joe Biden has many strong, intelligent and capable women from whom to choose for VP. I personally hope he selects a woman of color, but I will fully support whomever he picks. We must all pull together. We need to get this monster and his GOP minions out of power.

Speaking only for myself:  The populist, identity politics of Kamala have always given me the opinion that she's the "Trump of the Left" (far more intelligent, though).  I'd want nothing to do with that, so much so that a likely vote from me for Biden would go out the window.

I don't think they understand that anyone is better than trump. We just need biden to get in so we hopefully vote in a better person after biden thats not trump
yeah but ... if they're even voting for Biden.. does it matter who VP is really?
To me this suggests she's essentially already the pick and these are last gasp efforts to force Biden's hand.
BBBBBBOOM ! AND JOE BIDEN IS DOWN HE'S DOWN THAT HIT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN HIM OUT 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great case for a woman who: has said repeatedly she has no interest in running for president; is the most admired woman in the world; has a strong trusted relationship with Biden; is intellectually and emotionally capable for the job; and would motivate record turnout.
Biden didn't crack 15% in Iowa. Others had to bail-out, Yang included.  DNC didn't want to risk a 1st timer losing to an incumbent, it would cripple them politically.  Mayor Pete's next primary opponent, would only need the easy line of "This guy couldn't even beat Trump".
Stop and think for a second. We are entering a national election in less than 100 days. No debates? No rally’s!  seems hunter Biden scandal is gone along with the flu. Fight for mail in voting. Where are the studies HCQ works for covid 19. Americans are being played.
I agree he was a great man who has passed,but to turn a eulogy into a political campaign is wrong,its similar to what Biden and other public officials did at George Floyd's funeral,now in no way am I comparing the life of Floyd to Lewis,as far as i'm concerned there isn't any
I just think not acknowledging she is being overly criticized is dishonest...even that Ari Melber thing...He created a whole “series” just to dig at her...he said they’d be discussing ALL contenders, Biden may be announcing tomorrow...and that’s how this whole primary has been
Why...because deciding between Yang, Biden and Trump needs 95 days of pondering?
Sean, can you guys kindly consider a return to your previous format for election comparison? This is really tough on the eyes.
Obama Biden. Hillary. Gym Jordon. Orange Dumpling.
Biden should pick someone who can be a true partner as his VP, as he was. There are a number of great candidates. That said, I think the people in his circle criticizing Harris as “too ambitious” are underestimating his personal appeal and ability to lead, and Harris’ character.

No credible people would  talk like this. Biden would  not talk like this or think like this. Whoever was interviewed for this, lacks discipline, maturity &amp; should be mum about it. Power attracts some of the worst people. This sloppy interview proves it.
Thanks in part to Joe Biden.
Sure Biden is the one with dementia. Trump is asked why not spent more energy providing states with resources for mail-in elections. And Trump thinks the reporter is accusing him of having low energy or something.
Dude “never trump Republicans” are like three percent of 30% of the voters.   They’re wildly over represented in media but they make up a vanishingly small percentage of the electorate.   And the Biden strategy is to go all in on them.   Come on.
that's one of the reasons I think so too lol. but for niggas to make it seem like black people didnt have a say in the creation of the bill is disingenuous. the people who live through the crack epidemic played a very big role in its creation. blaming biden alone is wrong
I can confirm that Biden is pro-pasta and other delicious carbs.
it's all shit under the fascist capitalism of the USA but at least Biden isnt so far up his own ass that he cant be pressured by the public into changing it

I really hope Biden is secretly in touch with his contacts who are high up in the military. This could get very ugly if Trump loses.
Trump, Fox News, or his dopey kids will definitely float that Russia wanted Biden to win because he’s been so tough on Russia. Take that to the bank.
If in the hypothetical Trump shot Biden on the debate stage I do believe local authorities would arrest him. They would have to, as an imminent threat. if they didn't what would stop him from shooting 12 other people? Admittedly this is a ridiculous hypothetical, but with Trump??
I thought it already did when Biden was accused
Joe Biden &amp; Nancy Pelosi did not do well in the most recent edition of the national paper, "The Catholic Register" They did so poorly, I was surprised. The article praised President Trump for all his good works in supporting the issues the other two were expected to support.
Biden said he will make the decision next week.
Looking forward to a Biden-Harris ticket 2020!
Yes, President Biden WILL definitely have a Covid Plan.  And will put us on a path to not flatten, but C-R-U-S-H the curve!
So he's a liar, not a dictator.  Trump proved his swamp is just as dangerous as any other's, I just put more stock into actions than words.  I also don't feel Biden is any better, and for that reason, I'm out.
understand where you are coming from Biden &amp; Pelosi are worse. My book 2 wks, "Demons &amp; Politicians" drives into who they really are. They are not what they claim and you are their servant. This is a different fact filled book than any I've seen.

I’m making peace with Kamala Harris. If that’s the top 3, I want Harris. She was originally my 3rd choice for presidential nomination. I think she is being unfairly targeted at this point. Her fans, while being a little nuts, all stepped up and immediately went to Biden.

AG Barr was not allowed to answer questions from you Democrats, This hearing was a farce from the beginning and this crap about reclaim my time is nothing but a sad attempt to censor Mr Barr and prevent him from  investigating the corrupt Obama and Biden investigations.
You should be concerned about it! Plenty of progressives I’ve seen who are planning on not voting for Biden. So.
((looks like the progressives are already voting for Biden at least as high as 2016 levels for Clinton, from polling, so not too concerned about that))  But I would announce her as Treasury at the same time as VP pick
But her and her husband back Biden who has longed backed them since the early 90s remember senator Biden created the 3 strike law which mainly effected minorities Biden is just another cog of the Clinton war machine
(She’s the only option who can pull the progressive vote to Biden tho, so....)
I think Yang would steal more votes from Trump than he would Biden.
They can do it via zoom... as Biden's campaign has been lol
failing to acknowledge the immeasurable harm Joe Biden has caused throughout his entire career is also disgustingly privileged
And Biden may not want to appear as though he is annointing the next candidate. Bass is 66.
I will crawl over ground glass and barbed wire in my cargo shorts to vote for Joe #Biden this fall.
Biden would be stealing votes from Yang.
KA playing the game.  We're trained on the 2 party system with your response being the fear that prevents a 3rd.  Why wouldn't votes for Biden be taking votes away from Yang?  The best candidate should win, and people stress change within the party system, but do nothing.
I’m tired of old people running our country.   Pelosi: 80 Bernie: 78 Biden: 77 Trump: 74  They can barely even speak 🤣
Where is it written that a candidate has to be exciting. The only requirement should be can the candidate get the job done.  Joe Biden will be the leader we need.
i honestly wonder if the reason Biden is taking so long to pick someone is because he never wanted to have to pick a black woman.
I'm not going to pretend there is some strategy to not voting Trump out!! Just because I'm not affected in a real way..not an immigrant, not dead from covid, does not mean I will not act  Biden gives me some political say next 4 year's.......

Yes, many voted for Biden. Is that not a fact in your world? Bernie and Yang both ran and lost. Both were great candidates who had their chance and didn't win. They are now supporting Biden.
I think leading the Black Caucus is a huge plus. I think Biden is looking for someone who won’t take the spotlight based on some of the reporting, and also someone who is perhaps a little more loyal than Harris is perceived as because of the primary attacks.
That's a brutal tweet...but thank you...and this is what you will see from those folks who refuse to vote for Biden and Trump is elected as a  will see the #neverbiden jump on the Hitler tweet  just called them out and I fing love it

Have you seen the # of Unions who endorsed Biden?
The fact is they simply do not have a deep bench when it comes to women of color with the qualifications to be President, Harris has the best credentials. However, even she has a pretty shallow resume more similar to Obama or Cruz than a steady hand like Pence/Cheney/Biden.
They know with 100% certainty that Biden will not survive a debate.

If Trump is re-elected, 6-7 years. If Biden is elected, 1-2 years. I know which scenario I choose.
The US government has been literally torn apart by Trump. It has its faults, but what is being done climate-wise with the destruction of the EPA, for example, is far far worse than anything Biden would do. I'm not a Biden fan, but the threats are not equal.
John - we'll never see those stories in the MSM unless Biden's elected. Then the entire narrative will shift fo getting the economy back-on-track since we can't contain the virus...look at Sweden!

So you think Joe Biden is the answer to Trump? Not. Your arguments are cloaked in a false spiritual narrative.
Just a reminder; Trump’s campaign ads showing looting &amp; burning, etc. and claiming that would be Biden’s America, is actually Trump’s America. Additionally, Miller is the most stiff of the stiffest bunch of fascists I’ve ever witnessed in the WH.

You’re damn right!  I live in New Jersey.  This is mainly red, southern areas of NJ who are strong Trump voters.

She was full of shit which is why this went no where.  We now know the FBI had been involved from the get go - if you think Comey or Mueller wouldn’t have brought this up in the past 4 years If they had something you’ve been dropped on your head too much
“We’ll be back on the air shortly, even more forcefully exposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left wing.” - maybe the constant focus on burying his opponent over having any type of platform/policy whatsoever is exactly the issue🤔
One potential rationale for the difference is that Trump had the benefit in 2016 of being seen by voters as more moderate than Clinton. Now voters view Biden as more moderate.
Healthier me, Biden is President and Trump is in jail.   Also, COVID-19 is gone forever.

They don't have a problem with what Trump does but that he says the quite part out loud too much for their taste. Some will go back to the party if it goes about it's corruption in a "civil and decent" manner AND some will stay with Biden as he smiles and screws the little guy.
This what Trump and his campaign team should be doing if they are serious about winning the election, instead of falsely attacking Former Vice President Joe Biden and the peaceful protests, focus more on combating the Coronavirus and the COVID 19 disease with actual facts.
Did you forget Biden has been in office during a couple pandemics, he has more experience
GO BACK TO BED HIDEN BIDEN
They’re terrified Biden will pick Kamala or another WOC for VP, and they’ll win in a landslide: further disproving everything they’ve been ranting about for the last several years, and rendering them even more irrelevant.  Most of all they fear and resent the ascendency of WOC.
Biden shit his pants

Well look who is trying to be relevant! You’re not! Apparently more voted for Trump than Kolkata! And more will be voting for him than Hiden Biden!   You are all full of done much hate and BLINDED that you don’t care who is president as long as it’s not Trump.  You are all sick!
Biden Will need to have strings attached to his hands #PUPPET
Not in this climate. The democrats have drawn battle lines and never compromised. You either have to choose one or the other. I just had this debate with a libertarian. He posted abolish abortion yet posted pro Biden. That’s insane. You have to pick a side. It’s one or the other
I can see us faring very well under Biden, even during this pandemic and financial crisis: He was part of the administration that brought us back from the financial abyss, and also set up a pandemic task force.

Biden needs to keep doing what he’s doing. Continue to allow Trump to drive the train off the rails and every couple of days, pop up to remind the voters that he’s not *that fucking guy*.  Also, expect to see more of Obama beating Trump around the head and neck.
I would think that Biden will pick his running mate as someone that he can connect with, I could see Susan Rice as  a pick because she's been there and she's familiar with how Biden interacts and has been exposed to world leaders as well.  Would love to see Kamala as AG .

Where Does Joe Biden Go to Get His Apology?
I don't think its been said loud enough by the DNC or Biden campaign that  handling of the pandemic is directly tied 2 unemployment rate &amp; the economy. His lack of response 2 the virus has caused 155K deaths, millions of unemployed &amp; the recession we are now in.
Biden called it correctly!!!

The Democrats’ answer to this is to nominate Biden &amp; reject all of the proposals of the “left” of the party, including those of Bernie Sanders’ representatives in the DNC.
Also Biden will not put a far right conservative on the Supreme Court like Trump will if reelected.
Trump is a threat to our democracy and is becoming more authoritarian by the day. This country will not survive another 4 years of Trump.  I prefer Biden's policies and like that he is working with Bernie on a tax plan. This is what I like about Biden:
I’m resigning from twitter as soon as we have a sane President. Biden will do. For now.
I can't emphasize enough how completely disconnected from reality the #votebluenomatterwho logic is. Trump is absolutely an insane, narcissistic, misogynist, bloated cheese curl of a human, but Biden is a flaccid, passive, corporate loser who will do near-nothing to fix the

I actually like my insurance.  My parents love the insurance they have.  They have union insurance and that's one of the major reasons they're supporting Biden.
Biden sure wasn't my first choice but I will vote for his ass even with my dying breath to get rid of the current disgrace of a president ✌️
It’s not going to b safe for a long time. He better give it up  BIDEN 2020. The election is the first week of November. I’ll mail in my vote as soon as I get it I. The mail
I finally figured you out. You want Trump to win because if Biden wins then his VP has a leg up on 2024. If Trump wins then  has a better shot. How selfish to not care about the Americans suffering immensely under the idiot in chief. Stop being so naïve.
Have you read about Biden's policy proposals or how he's working with Bernie on a tax plan? These are views and policies I support:
Biden's handlers should be ashamed of themselves!

Ted we know your under pressure from China to do everything to help steal this election but mail in voting is not the same as absentee voting.  There have been numerous reports on just how fraudulent mail in voting is.  I'm sorry if you have no confidence in Biden winning fairly.
I’m voting because theres too much at risk with Trump. I will STILL challenge Biden heavily because he is not very progressive.  I’m not going to shame other Black people into voting. Because yes our system is shit no matter who runs it and we all challenge it in different ways.
For the next debate? How about asking questions from a HS history book to discuss Government and American History. Biden would ace that.
I’m a Mom for Biden. Who are you, again? Actually, I don’t care. My point is: you are very, very wrong.
When Biden takes power is time to split the party. It’s the best time, no point waiting until 2028 or 2032 to “reform the Democrats”
Great question, Stephen. Most of us Biden voters are just hoping to salvage whatever's left of the country that Trump and his enabling cult members haven't destroyed and don't have the luxury for subtle nuance of rhetorical political nonsense from the right. Hope that helps.
Joe Biden &amp; Wall Street Pete beg to differ.

It’s so crazy you put this up  What you are calling “Biden’s America” is actually tRUMPS AMERICA NOW!!! Wake tf up !! And put a DAMN MASK ON
Let the Democrats and their media pals enjoy themselves with their phony polls!  The full court press on Joe Biden is going to be awesome!
It’ll be warp speed if Biden wins.
I hope this flies too. What i like ehre, and Biden is trying to stop, Trump's threat to the US.
FLASHBACK: Conservatives attacked Joe Biden for predicting Trump would try to delay the 2020 election #SmartNews
I hoep this flies, with typos fixed. What I like here, and Biden is working on, a way to stop Trump.
.... is  Joe Biden going to sign that payroll check ?? Has "Uncle Joe" EVER signed a payroll check ??🤔🤔
Vote for Joe Biden. Restore the soul of this country and return to civility and the rule of law.
Really impressed by  I’ve been critical of the Biden campaign for over a year (mostly because they wouldn’t hire me), but hiring her was one of their best moves.
Devin Nunes and other Trump Loyalists received intelligence packets from Ukraine that probably contain allegations of Biden wrong-doing. The FBI is informed of this illegal action and are doing nothing.  Maybe we should ask   ?
Did I say Biden was perfect? Also Trump was friends with Epstein and wished Ghislane Maxwell well in her trial if you want to go there.
Will you finish the Great Wall of tRUmp before President Biden knocks it down?
I hope this flies. What I like here, and Biden knows, Obama trolls Trump in every way.
OK--I understand, but tactically it's not at all clear that Dems don't do better for the country and themselves by seizing the day. Yes. I agree we risk yo-yo governance. OTOH there are enormous risks in continuing to be held hostage saboteurs.  A failed Biden term leads to what?
And just to remind folks who Biden is working for &amp; why he won't endorse #M4All
propaganda machine pence. How can you a religious godly man lie so egregiously?! While Biden was VP for8 years America prospered safely, much more so than under u and trump.! Defund the police is not an insult to police and does not mean eradicate police; anything but! Resign
Fuk breaks. I’m not taking a break because that shithead is making us miserable.   He’s done. Let’s move this along already. I don’t GAF if I have to stand in line for three days.   I’m going to drag a Republican by the leg and make them vote for Biden, too.
Biden is great. “Settle” denotes he’s not First Choice.

Not that I say that's a concrete thing, Biden calling upon Bernie.  But it's a high likelihood.  The reason I want Biden is not because I hate Trump (I do), but because I know Biden will surround himself with people RIGHT for the job, unlike what Trump did.
Well, I can't disagree with you there.  Bernie was the guy that America needed, and unfortunately he was shafted yet again.  The good thing though is that Bernie and Biden are VERY close, and Biden winning almost certainly means Bernie will be heavily involved during his term.
Like, if Trump attempted to do a coup, the coup would straight up consist of him tweeting a thing, and then every Republican in Congress pretending they hadn't read it, the whole federal government not doing anything, and then Biden becomes president.
Trump is talking about rigging elections he had it rigged in 2016 he scared because he knows he’s gonna lose to Biden so now he wants to stop vote by mail all of a sudden it’s a scam he’s so damn scared because he knows he’s going to lose this election to Biden
Biden? yes
dirt on Biden. My take people will go as far as you let them.
I hope Biden wins and we get better options in 4 years.
You are a ignorant piece of shit but I forgive you because I realized that you like Joe Biden have Dementia and are not responsible for your stupidity  and obnoxious behavior. Your blob like mouth oozes with bullshit so why don't you resign and spare us your crap
i have no idea.... i don't want Biden or any dem.
Ngl it’s funny seeing people now saying this is bullshit. Like, yeah, that’s how it’s been for years. And sure that’s no reason to endorse the corrupt system, but right now abiding by it is the best option. Biden isn’t the best option, but he’s the best option we’ve got.
My dude, you think people who had Biden as their # 2 really would have flipped to Bernie with the wave of that Warren wand? These people don't even want her as VP now. I get the disappointment but please, get real.
We will have enough info by 11 pm Eastern Standard Time that Joe Biden won in a landslide!
I hope it does, because it will Insure a Biden win!
You really disapprove of Biden THAT much?
This is not true, and we have all been through this argument 1000 times. Warren's support was 50/50 between Biden and Bernie. She was not going to change the game. Please, knock this shit off.
So Biden is an idiot?
Can't wait to see the military drag him out the White House kicking and screaming. Obama will have to swear Biden into office. LOL
Because Biden will be the end of America.
He's capable of anything, but not sure here. I feel certain he enjoys the attention, provoking "the libs", taking attention away from Lewis/Obama, stuff like that. He &amp; GOP may be content with wrecking the country for Biden and the Dems, then sitting back to plot the next step.
To your first point, yes, we should be talking about how dems are not necessarily the ‘good guys’ and are guilty of the same corruption that Warren is fighting against— including Biden— hence the tepid response.
Not everyone on the left is "far left"... which is why Biden won (he's not far left). It's a big tent. And it mostly still believes in voting and democracy, which is a plus.
You're right on the issue but not sure why you have to be racist. Black people have no clue either how much this has ripped apart their communities, they think it's cops doing it to them. They're so dumb they voted for Joe Biden, who spent most of his career ass-fucking them.
Done
Did PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN approve this....he will be the sitting PRESIDENT AS OF JANUARY
Joe Biden-s Racial Economic Equity Plan Would Invest $150 Billion in Minority Businesses -
Decriminalization is bullshit. Legalize it or no vote. The fact that he can't even commit to legalizing weed when that's such a basic request is why we don't care about Biden. He's offering literally nothing.
You know what's a great priority? M4A, UBI, a GND. You know who doesn't give a fuck? Biden.
You might enjoy enough privilege to survive Biden but countless people don't.
No it does not imply any such thing the only people professing that they don't care about millions suffering are the people voting for Biden and acting like everything will be okay again.
96 days to the election and I’m voting for Biden because he understands the gravity of this pandemic and is encouraging vote by mail as a way to safely vote on November 3rd! But thanks Trump for trying to stall the election...good try
Letting Biden win is not a good strategy.
Biden is not center left. Bernie is center left. Biden is far right.
You are the only one bending reality. There is absolutely no chance we're getting any progressive policies out of Biden.
His work as VP was horrendous. If you want to sell us on the idea of Biden maybe don't invoke his record as it pretty much all sucks.
Biden is a real and present danger. There's no chance in hell we're going to vote for him.
Trump is clearly delusional. He needs a competency evaluation asap. #TrumpFailedAmerica #COVID19 #WorstPresidentEver #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
So is Joe Biden.
Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden
yeah no question. Biden is way more culpable, she served in a prison state that he helped build. only thing grinding my gears is this trying to erase her hardassed prosecutor history
We don't have a Democracy. We haven't had one in decades. Voting Biden isn't going to bring it back.
When Biden is Inaugurated I hope the MSM does us all a  favor and not report on anything Trump unless he or his family is charged with a crime and arrested. We've #HADENOUGH!

Federal Marshals may be needed to evict Donald Trumpf from the WH in Jan. 2021. I don’t think he accepts defeat &amp; willingly turn over to Biden after the elections. Fasten your seatbelts.
Politico publishes piece claiming Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick — quickly scrubs it
You'll know that night when you lose by a landslide.  Biden is ahead of you in my state of Pennsylvania!  Buh bye!  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K #DyingForTrump #TraitorTrump
But isn't that how it usually works? Biden will gladly take from a smart woman without giving her the due credit.
"Shit, I'm going to lose to Joe fucking Biden...I'll move the elections because that will work in my favor...somehow!"Hey joe Biden stop fucking around and select  as next on line.
Short of endorsing Biden it's #toolittetoolate
I feel like political ads for instance are like...soooo slanderous in their own nature. Why do I keep seeing these YouTube ads of clearly chopped up audio of Biden saying “Yes, absolutely yes” about defunding the police and some little kid saying “mommy I’m scared”
Im so glad we have Biden. Can't The wait for the debates. Biden will definately overwhelm Trump with his quick wit and his command of the facts.
No one should have to call him out. It's appalling that Biden hasn't put a stop to it and there's nothing wrong with expecting our candidate to step up against misogyny. I don't think anyone has campaigned harder for Joe than Kamala. She deserves better from him.
Ed Rendell's take on Biden's VP choice is about as useful and relevant as Rick Santorum's take on the same.
I saw a Biden ad on MSNBC last night and in a brief second they show Biden jogging down a ramp.  I literally LOL'ed.  So subtle but effective.

“We’ll be back on the air shortly, even more forcefully exposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left wing.”  This is a campaign strategy that has already gone over like a lead balloon.
Hey, he's the one that will be running this country if Biden wins.   #ObamaGateIsReal
Thats a good question. Maybe team Biden couldn't prep his lookalike in time? Or maybe they didn't want him to have to answer any questions?  #WheresHunter
The questions now  is what we will do once Trumpism is rejected in the Tsunami that will hit the GOP in November.  How will we use the four years of a Biden Presidency to rebuild our party into something better?  We’ve lost our way.   We let the ugliest among  us,  define  us.
I guess one of the big questions is after Trumpism is rejected in a humiliating Tsunami in November, how will we use the next four years of a Biden Presidency to rebuild the GOP back into something Abe Lincoln would be proud of?  We let the ugly among us define us.  What now?
Yes we are gonna wing BIG!! What are u gonna be doing when Biden takes over?
Hillary was awful at getting the people on the fence to vote for her.  I'm not saying Biden is good, but Trump is awful too.
Had a Trumper try to convince me not to voter for Biden.  Told him I was a 1 issue voter, I want Trump out of office.  Biden too old? Don't care.  Biden sniffs girls hair? Don't care. Biden son and Burisma? Don't care.  They really get frustrated when you tell them you don't care
I do not like Biden... I will vote for him as a default, but I just hate Trump. Your typical democrat insults don’t work on me... I don’t care...in fact you got nothing so you are making this is fun..enjoy the knowledge I am dropping on you. You argued with the wrong Republican..
Regan’s ghost hates trump too..no respect from my Republican Party?!!! I heard Bush is gonna vote Biden too... beautiful thing.. not because I like Biden, but because I hate a trump
Joe Biden says Trump's failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump

Under Obama and Biden, the immune system was a complete disaster.  We built the strongest immune system in history. But I don't get credit.  Must be my personality.
He knows that when Joe Biden takes office, one of the first agenda items will be to investigate the last 4 years of the Trump presidency, his family, his associates... everything.  For all that we know now, just wait until we discover what we don't.
All Democrats, including Biden, are against the murder of trump supporters. There isn’t a need for murder since they will take care of it themselves.
I find it funny in these trump commercials of “Joe Biden’s America” that they’re showing literal footage of Trumps America...
Wonder if Biden will just ask Obama to be his VP
DEFINITELY! Watching the F&amp;M polls this morning, 50% of people said if the election was today, they’d vote for Biden. Only 41% Trump and the rest undecided or neither. 🤞🏻
I just don’t understand how they can be so stupid? “This will be Biden’s America.” K well it is the current America which is under trump sooo 🤔🤨
When trump’s ads show videos of chaos and says that this will be Biden’s America...do you morons not realize that that is trump’s current America? 🤨
Spanky is going out of his way to make sure that Putin gets whatever he wants. Biden should have him thoroughly investigated when he wins the election in November.
Joshua: A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.
It is so obvious that Biden is just a pawn! WAKE UP AMERICA!
They should be. She'd be a disaster.
Ohhhhh &amp; all of the shitbag protesters &amp; rioters COMPLETELY understand the entire point of BLM?  I don’t expect you to understand, but if Biden wins YOU my friend will then understand BLM= Democrat ploy!!
GET YOUR FEDERAL TROOPS OUT OF PORTLAND NOW!!!! YOU ARE NOT A PRESIDENT BUT A DICTATOR!!!!! WE WILL NOT HAVE THAT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!!! BIDEN HAS A HELLA MESS TO CLEAN UP CUZ OF YOU DAMMIT!!!! FUCK YOU TRUMP AND THE HORSE YOU RODE IN ON!!!
Sure, but we wouldn’t even be having the conversation about Medicare for all without the Affordable Care Act and Biden *does* want to expand it. Is it enough? No. But it’s clearly a step in the right direction and we should keep pushing for more.
Remember when Obama picked Biden who never ran for President and clearly had no presidential ambitions whatsoever!? 😂
Biden is a conduit for the DNC to install their VP pick as #POTUS.
how is this account even real? who thought "settle for Biden" was a winner? 🤦🏾‍♀️

Saw my first Biden yard sign this morning close to the LGH health campus. #necivgov
That sounds like people who have not heard Biden speak without notes. Clueless!
Once again...  I don’t believe in the two party system. So I will not be voting for Biden either. He is just as trashy as Trump. I HIGHLY recommend getting to know your independent candidates👍🏾
Sowing the seeds of doubt about the legitimacy of the result. That way, he wins either way. Either they litigate his way to a second term, or he makes a fortune in right-wing media telling his faithful that he was robbed and Biden is failing at everything.
Most of us are not comfortable with bumbling Biden the Creepy Sleepy Uncle Joe. &amp; whoever he ;picks they will make a diabolical duo! MAGA KAG 2020 &amp; May GOD be with us!
If he were right, Biden would be polling by a landslide. Unfortunately, he continues his pattern of an exaggerated distortion of facts in a pathetic attempt to manipulate his followers into coming to his defense out of pity.
Biden's notes suggest Kamala Harris may be his chosen running mate: reports  #FoxNews Dear GOD the worst 2 anyone could ask for! MAGA KAG 2020 or we are DOOMED!
Biden is what we need now, as he is the only sane choice.  Two choices on November 3rd....choose wisely.
And Biden looked great today. How about trump promoting a witch doctor today?  Sad. Talk about madness!  trump is a failure.
And that is just what our Nation needs now. Certainly won’t be progressive enough, but Biden will create stability through leadership. The trump tweets this morning, followed by the press conference later, was a prime example of why we need change! 🇺🇸

Do you think Biden would have been out of his dungeon if he was doing as good in the "polls" as they said he was?
This is what Donnie wants. Then he has another thing to blame Obama-Biden.
Biden vows to fight racial inequalities with economic agenda
In case anyone wondered why Bernie ran for Prez and why I ran as a delegate of his.  We both support these things, meaning we are both more popular than the Dems and Joe Biden rn.  When all you are is blue no one will vote for you.
Cmon man I know the answer you expect but here’s one....there is a nationwide SILVER alert posted for Joe Biden today, he escaped frI’m his basement unattended, whereabouts unknown!
Its the defund police cause. And Biden backs it.
No one should be bashing Biden. He needs all of our support. #VoteTrumpOut  #JoeBiden2020
You need to shut the fuck up about this because we will find EVERYTHING BAD to say about you just so your supporters see who you really are!!!! YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER 150,000 AMERICANS DEAD!!!! YOU WILL BE PUNISHED FOR THIS!!! BIDEN WILL WIN THE ELECTION MARK MY WORDS!!!!
Biden would be the closest thing
Dom, My idea for the cardboard cutouts at the ballpark is Karl Marx flanked by Biden and Sanders.
Click-bait headline. Biden won't pick Susan Rice.
I mean practically all the white politicians voted for the crime bill and many to this day have denounced it. We know what a Trump America looks like. People that would prefer Biden are not saying so because they are thrilled with him. We just don't need a leader like Trump.
And consequently make up a larger portion of student debt as the Biden camp so ingenuously points out.
Next Biden will “end violence against women” and don’t worry ladies he’s going to “protect and empower woman around the world”
This is the most male centric m. Mansplanning womensnagenda I’ve ever seen, don’t worry ladies Biden will, “Help women navigate work and families.” Because clearly you need his advice on how to do both.
Since the majority of this nation’s discontent centers around Donald Trump‘s incompetence, devisive  rhetoric, and bungling of the coronavirus response, his removal would bring about civil rest.   Joe Biden, ultimately, is the “law and order” candidate.
No surprise here....the tide is turning as my Dem friends are going to Trump because of their anti crime and anti anarchy feelings.  Can you say your strategy and weak candidate, corrupt Joey Biden is failing !!!  Thanks for running this rat.
Joe Biden plans to restore federal funding for Planned Parenthood

Yup. Jesse Should be so proud of himself for completely ignoring someone calling in and threatening bloodshed against conservatives. What an embarrassment. I am sure Jesse would have been silent if someone threatened Biden supporters. Uh huh.

We are. We are voting for Biden.
Nothing will silence #ResistersUnite you MAGATS ARE DONE FOR IN NOVEMBER WHEN BIDEN GETS ELECTED IN A LANDSLIDE THAT WILL BE FOREVER BURNED INTO MEMORY
Are there really "hidden" Trump voters?  Don't you think in red states that there might be a ton of "hidden" Biden voters?  And after all of this, how is there any "undecided" voters.
Loving this Biden smear campaign where the videos have the text "Defund the police?" and then play a clip of Biden saying "Yes!"
Leave it alone. You will be gone soon.  Let Flotus Dr. Jill Biden handle it.
The polls look good for Biden, and I would never suggest anyone not vote for Biden at this point. But relying on one election to stop a facist movement that has shown how easily they can attack us citizens without consequence is irresponsible.
You wont get answers till Biden is elected, so VOTE BLUE
AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
These “in Joe Biden’s America ads” are really just...awful. Family calling 911 and no one is there to answer. Like you think “defund the police” means “fire dispatchers?”. Y’all had your brains shopvacced out of your ear at a young age.
Biden and Trump are not the same. Dems and Reps are not the same. It does matter who you vote for in November. Voting third party is your right but clearly you haven’t been paying attention. We’re 99 days out from Election Day, emerse yourself on the issues and vote.
If you vote for Biden, taxes will increase, government will waste more money, strategic power with Russia and China will worsen, and Ukraine will get less help from us.
BIDEN IS A NATIVE PENNSYLVANIAN OF COURSE WE WANT HIM AS PRESIDENT!!!!
PA is turning blue, lol Biden is winning here by 15 points or more.

My Timehop 4 years ago is just RTs about how much everyone loved Joe Biden...
At first, I thought this was a national poll and went “uh-oh.” Then I realized it was North Carolina. Biden up by 7%. Wow.
I keep reminding everyone I know that complacency has no place in this election. Everyone must vote. Complacency/not voting=a vote for Trump. Writing in anyone who is not Joe Biden=a vote for Trump.
Well you're right about one thing. We do want Joe Biden to win in November. Our country cannot take another 4 years of Trumpism.

Probably not, I didn’t see first part of this thread .  Modern makes me picture the protestor type woman who will vote for Biden.
Thought I would check on R*an K*ight to see how he was doing and he's calling Biden a center-right corporate extremist.   Yikes.
Funny how trump uses clips of his doing to show how it will be if My man Biden gets in office. How stupid is his base that they can't figure that out. I mean Holy Christ. God must make mistakes.

(Cont’d) everything else in between.  Plus, with Medicare for all, many people with disabilities, like me, will have better insurance to cover all their medical and medicinal needs, thus insuring our lives are in good hands.  Both Biden and Trump are in favor of none of (3/?)
Okay, but let’s take a look at the five current candidates from a more logical angle.  Okay?  Compared to Trump and Biden, Bernie has more interests in improving our country than “the lesser of two evils,” or as I like to call them, “Giant Douche and Turd Sandwich”.  (1/2)
Bullshit. This has nothing to do with suppressing vote, and has everything to do with millennial staff not getting enough attention...and maybe a trophy. Someone on the Biden staff please starting giving out appreciation certificates!
Your monetary system means nothing to me, you are also an absolute idiot to think Kayne West will be president. Also the things you said about Biden, all lies. Have already been proven false. whether you like it or not Biden is going to be America's 46th president

Ha you keep telling yourself that, I hope you are right,I see it, it’s not gd. I’ve watched every town in U.S. turn into rust buckets in the last 30 yrs.Start was NAFTA/Clinton, final nail was Biden/China.Textile Steel Furniture  Auto Pharm etc gone Millions of jobs, it’s bad now
America?  Or Trump.  You are going to have to choose.  The Democrats gave you Joe Biden, who you know and can easily vote for.  The other choice has been a miserable failure, and has hurt our country.  Choose wisely.
America, or Trump.  The Democrats gave you someone entirely plausible to vote for; you know Joe Biden.  Are you a patriot?  Or are you one of few left who thinks Trump is fit for the job.
Im also hearing the GOP said Biden could actually win Texas this year
Biden also won PA and thats HUGE

I don’t Oppose Biden taking it if requested. Apparently his Dr did not request it. I guess, and I can only hypothesize that his DR didn’t require it. However, it was administered to Trump. And let’s be real. He bragged about it twice now. It’s embarrassing....
I don’t think you are getting that I am not democrat or really like Biden. I really just oppose Trump, Barr, Mitch, and Lindsey
I feel like with everything else he does he projects. He’s a big time liar. He’s been caught so many times. Also, I don’t even really like a Biden. I just cannot get behind the weird ideology. Why put a crown on a Trump pic or make his head on Rocky’s body. It’s weird.
Biden or no one. I think Biden is a terrible candidate and I really don't like him, but he is light years ahead of Trump. I understand not voting in 2020 but I really can't respect unabashed Christian support of Trump.
If Biden wins MI, WI, and PA, he’s the next prez.
I watched the Biden-Obama video just released and wanted to cry listening to Obama. We had a highly intelligent, relatable &amp; responsible prez. Now we have crazy 3rd grader. 😫
Many Trump fans in my hometown - letter to editor today said that Trump was born again &amp; God's appointed pick for our leader. Said on Judgement Day, Trump will fare better than Biden. I must be practicing a different form of Christianity than the writer of that letter.
No thanks to you.  We‘d  be done with this and back to work already if ”Republicans” like you didn’t call it a “hoax” and sneer at masks.  Now you’re cutting benefits to people out of a job because of what you did, saying they are ”lazy.”  Done.      I’m voting for Biden.
Idk, the funny thing is is that these people have built it up in their minds that Biden is going to be worse than Trump with acuity that they have actually created this level of expectations that I think is going to massively backfire on them
Right!!! Lincoln was NOT AND NEVER WOULD BE A TRUMP SUPPORTER. He would support Joe Biden and in 2016 Hillary I'm sure.
Nice that Trump is pushing this.  The "end of the suburbs" to Trump is affordable housing.  This is not a dog-whistle; this is a bullhorn.  "Vote for me or Biden will let brown people live near you."

I'm not sure why a Biden Admin should allow FoxNews access to the White House. It sacrificed what little credibility it had for Trump (like the GOP), and is nothing more than propaganda for right-wing authoritarian whackos. It does immense damage and deserves no legitimacy.
Biden has proven racist acts in his past, Trump does not, it’s only Democrats and Democrat propaganda media who say it.  Beyond that, Biden’s mind is shot, and he can barely speak coherently for 3 minutes, that’s why he basically in hiding, and others  speak for him.
Don’t you love how all the monday morning quarterbacks like CNN and Biden, tell you they could have done better.  But they don’t say how, just bash others.  Again, CNN is not news, is Democrat propaganda, and it’s embarrassing.When Biden is president you will not see this
I don't give a shit what people have you work for it and earn it then all is good as long as it is legal. If I hate a person it will be for their attitude not their skin color, skin color hate is what racism is. And that is not me and I support Trump. But on COVID-19 I go Biden.
Biden should challenge Trump to a debate regarding corona virus policies. That way both candidates can explain their policies in detail.
Is Trump threatening America with war if Joe Biden wins?
It's not an opinion. Biden and the Democrap party do not stand for the issues that I feel strongly about. Why would I continue to vote for one? It's asinine to continue to vote for status quo.
Not supporting Biden is not supporting Biden.
Sorry, no. That not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump bullshit is just that, bullshit. A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump. I'll be voting Green again this year. So my vote for the Green party candidate is a vote for the Green party candidate.
There are enough people on the left who will vote for the letter in ( ) after a name regardless of who that is. Also, I have no doubt some registered Republicans will be voting for Biden. Middle of the road liberals aren't going to be an issue.
Joe Biden is a Trojan horse full stop. #MAGA

If they can manage to get enough votes to pass both chambers and land on President Biden's desk he could sign the bill making the popular vote the law of the land. If they can pull this off the country is lost. Then only New York, California, Texas &amp; Florida votes will count.
He was living his life as a free American, making his own decisions and deciding what personal risks to take. He was not hiding in his basement like Biden. People get the virus every day. If I am one of them, I want to get it at a Trump rally—not at a Satancratic riot.
He had a delicious Joe Biden at the Kingswood Community Center. That's a joke, I don't know where I am.
Based on polls, Biden is 95 days away from humiliating Trump and his followers and they're going to impeach him again now?
Devin Nunes declines to say whether he received foreign information meant to damage Biden
What did Biden do to you? Here I'm clueless?
Biden! Because I'm saying I'm voting for Biden to avoid scrutiny while actually voting Trump.
FIRST: Trump and the entire GOP began to tank in the polls. Here in PA, Trump is trailing Biden by 7 points and I’m within single digits of Mike Kelly.  (THREAD)
You mean the Biden that people are saying that he's going senile Biden? GTFO with your conspiracy theory!
I hope it is only real Americans are true Blue Republicans! And Everything but COVID-19 Trump got right. But for my health I must vote Biden but if Trump wins I'm content. I just don't want to pull a suicide lever. COVID-19  is my true enemy! 😔😔😔
Do you ever do real work? Or do you just tweet your life away while Americans are dying because you dont know how to lead?  Joe Biden knows so much more than you. He knows how to serve his county, no bonespurs for him! He also loves America. You only love you.
I thought picking between Trump and Hillary was rough, but Biden and Trump might be worse. How is Biden the best the democratic party has to offer? Out political system is a joke.
NO CHANCE!! Biden 2020 🇺🇸
President Biden will change that
We will have one in January President Biden
You're quote tweeting James Woods mocking Biden...  God you aren't bright.   PS I thought the virus was less deadly than the flu or pneumonia, pops.
Biden = White Supremacist P.O.S.   It will always stand that way and never change. Biden is the pure definition of "WHITE TRASH"
what if Joe Biden wins?
Just another stab at Trump. Democrats are so full of Hatred they are backing a White Supremacist for the Presidency in Joe Biden.   I will go and vote Joe Biden on November 3, 2020 over COVID-19. But I do not like Biden, I never will and if he wins I will cry.
It’s not Trump’s America you dunce. It’s Democrat run cities, so you have proven our point that you are evil. Able to watch your own cities burn for political gain because Biden is a terrible candidate... shame on you.
Yet on Biden's record you should look it up. If you claim Black Lives Matter than you would not be voting for Biden because his whole career has been set against people of color. His 1994 Crime Bill with the well known Racist Strom Thurmond proves that.
Haha, you're so scared to lose to Biden
Biden is a racist, you cannot see that. He is spinning blacks like a top. Selecting a woman of color to be his running mate is manipulating the black voter despite all his past racist statements, gestures and gaffes.
I’m one of your biggest fans would love a response and your opinion on if you think the Democrats will actually somehow let Joe Biden slide and get out of debating? I’d love to see it because there’s no way Trump would not just destroy him
Bad mistake on his part this virus is an Aerosolized pathogen which makes it highly contagious, is why the spikes in cases are so high. Wear the mask it's better than nothing. Also we must Vote Biden because Trump is not approaching this Virus seriously.
So go to the polls and vote and when you do and Die not my problem. I will vote for Joe Biden over COVID-19 if I can vote by mail if not I vote for no one. It's not worth my life.
it seems like the only commercials I can't skip on Youtube are ones trashing Joe Biden and trying to install fear into people. That's annoying, guess I'll just stop watching YouTube for awhile.
I heard that too and I hope to God that happens because they could be a smaller version of what happens to America if Joe Biden gets elected. We can’t let the left take the Senate and the White House.
How long are we gonna do this song and dance? This does not prove he is racist what this is is a block on the planned attack on the suburbs from Joe Biden. I’m sorry but who thinks low income housing in the middle of the suburban neighborhoods is a good idea
Thank you for not allowing Biden’s terrible attack on the suburbs to go through
This also shows they are not confident that Biden can win without special help so no one should pay attention to the polls saying he’s ahead. Why suggest the need to change the voting method to a method that could lead to more fraud unless you weren’t confident in your candidate.
Is there a particular reason we do not hear anything regarding Biden sexually assaulting the staff worker or how he had the prosecutor fired in the Ukraine or he was going to withhold money. Thought maybe I was dreaming and this was unreal
You are is delusional and the rest laughed what they did to borrow yesterday was ridiculous especially when he has for a bathroom break you people are so delusional no one in their right mind would ever elect Joe Biden let alone his running mate Kamala Harris let’s face it
Enjoy it now because it’ll never last Biden doesn’t have a brain let alone any running mate that’s were talking about and if it’s Kamala Harris the hate towards her is worse than the hate towards Trump can’t wait for you people when Trump wins reelection what are you gonna do joy
Trump is a great President just not on COVID-19 but everything else he is spot on. With Joe Biden you will put a racist in office. "I do not want my kids growing up in a jungle, a racial Jungle." 1977 Joe Biden on Desegregation debate.
So true Biden made that claim but hell they ignore all his racist gaffes anyhow!
Yep welcome to the New CCP. Once Biden wins freedom of speech is dead in America, quite possibly worse. Look for a Coup to overthrow our Government system.
Honestly not sure who to vote for. I vote for county more then party.   I am not a huge Trump fan but Joe Biden literally did not know what city he was in today or what year it was.   Just can’t believe these two are the best we have.   #usa #maybethingsgetbetterin2024
A strong Vice President. If Trump is re-elected the next four years will be hell and anything he does could effect us (particularly young people) for years to come. Please, just consider voting for Biden. Thanks for taking the time to read this.
I'm gonna vote like biden Is 50 points behind
The next president will be choosing her replacement. The court is already stacked with conservative justices. That replacement and the make-up of the court will effect you and all young people for decades. Also, unlike Trump, Biden will surround himself with strong people. And
I have sons in their early 20s. I absolutely understand what you’re saying. Many conversations with them about this exact issue. And yeah, I’m not thrilled with Biden either. That being said, please look at the bigger picture. RBG isn’t going to be able to work for much longer.
wait, isn't that kinda what most VP's do, even Biden?
Enjoy President Biden
Yes Biden has become delusional
Regardless of the whole Demon Sperm thing...it’s funny how Joe Biden (a white man) isn’t being raked over the coals for calling a black female doctor “a crazy woman...she’s a disgrace”. Remember when DJT called Hillary “crazy” and all you woke white broads lost your mind?
I'm not an expert, but my gut says that a vote for nihilism is probably not necessarily a vote for Biden, so I'm with it.
Why would Congressman Clayburn support him?Why are so many African Americans supporting Biden. Research what Trump did pertaining to Obama and BLM
Trump 2020 for real Biden 2020 for COVID-19   You vote Biden you give power to Marxist Terror groups BLM &amp; Antifa so yes choose wisely. Biden is really tied to Russia &amp; China!
Well, with Rachel coming down to tell us what he *actually* meant, why do we need Biden to speak?
Trump deserves his protection he earned it and if Joe Biden wins then we are in real serious trouble.
Did Biden form a complete sentence or did Jeff Dunham have his arm rammed up his ass working him like a puppet?
You still can’t give me any actual proof, when there are tons of gaffes about Biden. I rest my case
While I think she's a bad choice for VP because Berners and the center right don't like her, this is a dumb reason.   I think she should be AG should Biden win.
Interestingly enough Erie was in this, and it went 7-2 Biden including 4 Obama-Trump voters.  You would think that would be noteworthy that a usually blue county that flipped in a usually blue state had this kind of change, but that doesn't get rage clicks lol.
Also my town was in this, 7-2 Biden.  Which is interesting for a PA county Trump narrowly won in '16
Trump has lost his economic edge over Biden
I’d be a hypocrite if I denied a trump gaffe but I haven’t seen any. Plus I have seen the interview you’re referring to. There is no mistake at least none like Biden. In fact trump is pushing for school choice which will help the less fortunate including blacks.
So you get mad about baffling Biden &amp; attack trump because you can’t believe Biden isn’t lucid? Not our fault or trumps. If you can show me a verbal mishap of trump I’ll be happy to acknowledge it. But you people get pisssed &amp; can’t acknowledge Biden’s failing mental state
If Biden has it what do you call the Quisling Trump?  Notice most of the Congressional black caucus are Democrats.
Whatever there’s no point in talking about mental states because all you fucking Dems for whatever reason still believe Biden is all there when it is factually evident he’s not by audio and video you can look it up there are tons of gaffes on YouTube
Oh but you can find Biden introducing himself as Joe Biden’s husband
Biden is on his road to dementia and AOC is as dense as a rock. She doesn’t know what she’s talking about she thinks that a policeless world is the suburbs. She is one of the dumbest people in politics I’m sorry if that offends you but it’s just true
I'm not going to try to help you, because I'm going to vote for Joe Biden. I hope when you lower people's prescription prices that it's not just like 50 or 60 cents. That's a joke. Also, people are mad because you have not been a president for everyone, just your chosen few.
DUMBEST POTUS EVER!!! Biden 2020🇺🇸
...if they will find a way to "Blow" this one.   All Biden surrogates should "STOP" right on the "spot," if they feel that an Action could draw further Attention to Biden's forgetfulness.
Brenan's mind must be 'Shot' if he can't even remember the major milestones of his career. Sometimes you look at the Biden Campaign and just wonder...  "Ex-CIA director Brennan writes in upcoming memoir that Trump blocked access to records and notes."
I kept telling everyone when I was in Cleveland this weekend to vote by mail because he doesn't want us to.  Everyone at my nephews party live in Ohio and all said they are voting for Biden. Hopefully they will by mail
I’m in no way shape or from a Biden supporter. I just need that fugly oompa loompa out of office. Even if that means replacing him with someone slightly less awful as him 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
I’m well aware of how creepy and disgusting Biden is, but I’m sorry I only have two choices what do you expect me to do? Vote for someone who has absolutely no chance at winning? That’s a vote for trump in my eyes. That a vote wasted in my eyes
I'm seeing Biden signs in a lot of blue collar suburbs.  The GE plant neighborhoods here.  Zito / Arande territory.
I agree, Biden should flip enough of the suburbs, although given covid in Florida I could see Biden's lead being bigger there than PA.
Waffling on fracking/coal will hurt Biden in PA too, although I think he'll flip the suburbs enough to win it.
By God, this beats everything, absolutely every crazy thing Trump has ever tweeted does not compare with this one. And to think that people have any worries about Joe Biden. Oh my, this is a first.
I'm not sure people really associate this with Biden.  These are scenes from Trump's America.
Also, given the disastrous COVID response, I could absolutely see Biden polling better in Florida than PA.  The cult is strong here.
I mean Biden has *gained* two points in NC.  But I still don't think the protests are making anything better at this point.
I think it’s mind-boggling that Joe Biden is the culmination of everything wrong with our political system, but Trump has still somehow found a way to be worse.
I think you're talking about the Democratic Party. It runs the gamut from radical left, liberal, progressive, moderate, and conservative. Democrats are much more than one man or party, and Biden is a decent man.
Joe Biden making jokes about his diminished mental capacity = 4D chess
We will have to shut down again and the people spreading these conspiracies about #TrumpVirus not being serious and fake cures are responsible for this lasting into the Biden administration.
Biden photographed with Kamala Harris talking points as running mate speculation grows
Shouldn’t you be hiding in the basement with Biden?
Have there been any boat parades for Biden?
Biden says he will choose his running mate next week
63 Days until the world sees Joe Biden live on TV with no where to hide himself
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden said Tuesday he will choose his vice presidential running mate next week. Biden has said he will choose a female running mate, and has faced pressure within the party to choose a woman of color.
This isn’t FUCKING FUNNY! Democrat mayors are watching their cities burn &amp; they don’t care because the worse the economy looks the better the chance Joe Biden’s Husband has
I don’t know which world you live in but the world respects trump. Biden is losing his mind
Joe Biden can't find the little boys room to go pee pee cause he doesn't remember where it is.. He is too busy sniffing little girls hair, like the pedophile he is... Not to mention he is a true RACIST.. Do your research.
52 USC 30121 Contributions and donations by foreign nationals  it doesn't have to be money but anything of value, Biden is of value. Trump asked China and Ukraine
The WSJ is suggesting that business and corporate Interests will Punish Biden if he doesn't come out AGAINST Portland Leninists, but in doing so Biden will jeopardize his standing with the base.   It won't. Everybody knows it is Barack in Power at the TOP.
Barack O'Biden built the Movement. To be fair, they built the peaceful protesting, but they used the worst of Identity Politics to do it. As an Outcome, we have Leninist Socialism taking place in Portland.
Lol.  No one has ever called Joe Biden a radical.
Right coming from the guy with Joe Biden as his icon🤣😆. #4MoreYears#TrumpPence#WeWillWin
Biden’s campaign is trying to limit his speaking time...Trump won’t shut up and is great at making himself look like a dolt, especially right now. They’re hoping Lee’s is more with crazy uncle joe. Whoever his vp is will pickup a lot of mic time.
People in most states saw it. We knew. I asked our governor to consider holding back on reopening, because it was apparent that it was too soon. The president jumped the gun and kicked our science team to the curb. There are no more congratulations on mitigating, that's for sure.
Have a very hard time believing Biden is +7 in AZ and up in Texas and Georgia but only +3 in Minnesota
Which completely ignores my point about South Korea getting under control but good talk.    Trump was golfing and saying it would miraculously disappear when Biden wrote an article warning about it
In many ways I will cry. Because Joe Biden in the end (is) an extreme racist, he has a laundry list of extreme racist friends. He will be 10 times worse than Trump could ever be. So I will be very sad and heartbroken to see the road we will go down. 😔😔😔
98 days until the election, and Joe Biden still hasn't announced who the democrat nominee is going to be.
Seriously!!!  Sounds like something a Biden backer would say. Biden basically said same thing. If you don’t vote for me you ain’t black
"Trump is weak": Lincoln Project video shows conservative veteran making case for Biden
Indeed. That’s why we gotta get out and vote in numbers that absolutely cannot be mistaken to mean the country wants him out. Even if it is close with a Biden win, I think there are people whose job will be to force him out. 😁
Understandable. Even if it’s just long enough to help Biden get into office in November, we’ll take every single electoral vote we can get.
So what about all of your unfair name calling of Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and now,Paul Ryan, who handed you your famous #TaxScam. You called John McCain every name in the book, and he was responsible for the pay raise and new equipment for vets, not you. You're never fair.
Get ready for 4 more years my 1 vote for Biden will not help
Biden will
They don't realize Dems essentially rejected the Left by nominating Biden
Pretty soon you will be called President Biden
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 which ones. I'm a Republican only turned Democrat to support Bernie Sanders. Even donated $50 towards his campaign, will vote Biden Nov. 3 but I am still a Republican so do your best. 😁 I love a challenge
Also to note there are Republicans who don't like his policies, especially me over COVID-19. There he is a screw up and on his wall blowing down that was a laugh cheap contractor's cutting corners! 🤣 Yet I will vote Biden, then go back to my Party and stay. Trump made me mad.
A 4 point Biden win should absolutely make up the 40k votes in PA, MI and WI  Always good to be vigilant tho
Why did you find Trump not guilty pertaining to the impeachment?  52 U.S. Code § 30121.Contributions and donations by foreign nationals. It doesn't have  to be money but anything of value, Biden is of value. Trump asked China and Ukraine
It was clear cut, Trump broke the law 52 UCS 30121 Contributions and donations by foreign nationals  It doesn't have to be money but anything of value, Biden is of value. Trump asked China and Ukraine.
Pennsylvania for Biden landowners are getting ripped off by gas companies anyways taking away royalties most people are not happy with energy companies here BIDEN 2020 our wells are already fracked so ban it now
Trump election has what I’m calling the socialism put. He has a certain percentage of voters that will not vote for Biden on principle of socialism vs our political system.
So to be clear you wouldn't know who I was if I showed up at your front door but you've already decided I'm a racist? That says it all about the left in 2020. And if Biden wins I won't protest, riot, or throw a hissy fit. I'll just get up and go to work like every other day.
I have lived in Pennsylvania my entire life. We are a proud people. You may have conned the people once but not again. Pa. Is voting for Joe Biden.
A GREAT lesson for would-be capitalist politicians AND Moderate DEM candidates RN. Biden isn't going to save you. He is just a temporary 'stop-gap' to what the future DEM Party holds, social welfare programs, identity-based social programming, and free health care.
Can you say President Biden. Sounds great. How about  a Commander in Chief forum where vets and active duty ask the questions and Paul Reichkoff is the moderator
Joe is everything Trump is not. Joe at his worse is better than Trump at his best. I can not wait until I can say President Biden
If you think I’m not voting for my fellow Pennsylvanian, King , Joseph Biden that knows more about the state than you’d do than you’re out of your damn mind
Get you nose out of Pennsylvania. You are ruining enough things. Fracking and rogue oil wells have ruined the drinking water sources for many rural Pennsylvanians. #Biden will fix that. You have destroyed the necessary protections to our environment. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I’m from Pennsylvania. I will vote for Biden. You, mr. trump, are a fake, nasty, person undeserving my vote.
This is honestly the strongest argument in favor of voting for Biden I’ve read.
From Donald Trump to Ted Yoho, Republicans are losing with women voters
Biden is suppressing Hispanic voters???
Literally every single person I know in PA including myself are voting for Biden... Sorry  Not sorry
He lacked Biden's raw sex appeal
Questions that will shape last 100 days of Biden vs. Trump campaign - Business Insider  Let me editorialize a list of questions about the election..
Actually,  this is exactly the year to do that. You vote for Trump or Biden and they win, you're culpable for what they do.  Own that.
My loyalties lie with truth. You should never convict by word of mouth but with proof. I am voting Biden over COVID-19 but does not mean I have to like him.
Worth noting as well Biden only needs to outperform Hillary by like 1% and he wins it.
Sadly, I’ve seen 3 Biden signs but never have seen a Bigfoot. Rather think Bigfoot would be a better dem candidate than Biden; more honest anyway.
I feel this is more accurate than Biden +10 in PA.  The cult is strong here.
I just saw that Biden's America ad.   First, it idiotic as he's not president.   Second, it's a poorly done ad altogether.
It is his records that is the thing if Trump decides to start slinging mud Biden is in deep trouble. He can expose all of his sayings on the floor in the Senate, his once aired comments which are circulating now among Republicans and if this all comes out he is in for it.
Biden is the racist
It is ridiculous. How anyone can seriously think Bernie in Biden mask will heal this country is beyond me. I don't think they even think that, they just hate Trump.
I agree we need enforcement reform and major law reform. I don't think Biden is the guy for that. His answers usually include massive government expansion, where I think Trump represents at least the intention to shrink government.
Rizzo and Wrigley are campaigning for Joe Biden!
My Pennsylvania for Biden sign went up last week. My neighbor commented that this country can not survive 4 more years of Trump.
I’m a Biden fan. Also, Trumpers lost the credibility to call out anyone’s character when they backed a carnival barking scumbag because he “says what everyone is thinking.”
Same guy that says they don’t do politics, has made bloggers at his company take down political blogs and who’s company’s top podcast turned down a Biden interview recently because they were told the company doesn’t do politics.
On November 3, 2020 Joe Biden will win! This will be the date that will be Celebrated in Russia &amp; China! It will be America's turn to Extreme Leftist Fascist Dictatorship not unlike Hugo Chavez or Manuel Noriega the Panamanian Dictator. Freedom in America will die!
Sadly yes over COVID-19! I think Biden is a racist! He's a dirtbag and a crook, is being led on a leash by Ultra Left Wing thugs in Antifa &amp; BLM. But I have no choice but to vote Biden to give my life a chance to go on. Voting Biden is the most selfish thing I will ever do!
If you want to elect Joe Biden, we will go back rather than moving forward. Biden wants socialism, to continue this covid-19, allow more foreigners to arrive( us tax payers are paying them to be here), our freedom is gone!! It's your choice.
I can’t think of one bad thing about Biden.  Is he far enough left for me?  Probably not, but as a person he couldn’t be more decent.  And the other candidate has arrest warrants out for him and court cases and is a narcissist.  What is the comparison??
Trump has done well in every area but COVID-19 response, and to be fair to Trump slightly everyone got it wrong, Trump still does get it wrong! He lost my vote in 2020 over COVID-19, my health concerns, may God be my judge when I vote Biden for President,  I pray God has mercy!
The only office Biden will be in is the doctor's office getting treatment for his dementia.
It’s obvious that Drumpf only is “worried”about high crime in democratically run cities. He hasn’t sent his goons to Jacksonville, FL, where crime is also rampant. It’s all about politics. He just wants to intimidate Biden voters.
Only problem is when you do you must accept that you will be voting for Joe Biden a well known Racist. "I do not want my kids to grow up in a jungle, a racial jungle." 1977 Biden on Desegregation Debate on U.S. Senate Floor.
Great, can you say President Biden sounds great
52 USC 30121 Contributions and donations by foreign nationals  it doesn't have to be money but anything of value, Biden is of value.  Trump asked China and Ukraine. It is on YouTube
Good choice for Vice President or Governor, since Biden is the nominee
Biden already said on tv he will raise taxes by getting rid of trump’s tax cuts. I hope you can at least be against that Chris
Biden and the Democrap party are not interested in healthcare, workers rights, or the environment.
Wow this one is just a little better then your last one. You ready Eric. Biden is not your ignorant father and does not need to lie to get votes. Biden is note controlled by anyone or anything. Like the astounding stupidity your father has exhibited everyday since your father
I can not wait until I can call you  President Biden
Notice that is an Army hat. Great taste President Biden I am a vet 11b2p 82nd airborne
That's not what they are doing.  What are Trumps Chumps going to do when President Biden sends in federal troops to quell armed insurrection by gun nuts who gather all over the country?
your lies on there backs without being called out as insane for backing trump. I wake up every day and wonder is this my last day on earth. If I will be alive long enough to vote that piece of shit out of office. I hope that you are not pardoned by President Biden.
It's not an ideal situation, but Biden saying he is a transitional candidate puts a great deal of pressure on this selection. It's a remarkable time of history. Hope I am able to convey that to my students.
Pretty sure those folks arent going to vote for Biden anyways. Certainly more experienced.
I find it hard to believe that Biden would be able to do that when you have done Nothing on covid virus. Who the hell is going to be alive to do that if we are all dead from your lack of humanity. Why would Biden do what you are already doing. The last ditch effort of a desperate
O'Bama, he's listening to O'Bama exclusively. That's it.   Not all uncommon in Presidential "Affairs" for partnerships like this to Flourish.   "The Battle for Joe Biden."
Biden isn’t making gaffes. He’s speaking his true beliefs. They are just really flawed beliefs.
In VP search, Biden has a known quantity in Susan Rice
52 USC 30121 Contributions and donations by foreign nationals.    it doesn't have to be money but anything of value, Biden is of value.  Trump asked China and Ukraine.
You are probably the biggest failure next to Biden.
Yesssss!! Trump for Biden!! Indeed!!
Biden ain't far left
#BidensAmerica Portland, Seattle, Chicago, etc this is a preview of what this country will look like under Biden and democrats.
me put it this way a lot of nothing is nothing and no hero worship is going to change that no matter how much you want. I will take my chances with Biden then the devil. If  that is a source of tension or discomfort for you to bad get over it. I am sick of this bigots hate.
Thank you 🙏🏼 Colin Kaepernick you deserve the Presidental Medal of Freedom “meritorious contribution..national interests of the United States” President Biden will be doing the honors🤞🏻🤞🏼🤞🏽🤞🏾🤞🏿#VoteThemAllOut2020
Under Biden gas prices will soar for sure
To touch on it, I don't have an opinion on it lol. I stated I'm not a trump supporter did I not?  I am stating that it's moronic for anyone to think Biden is any better. Hate a guy so much, you believe anyone else would be better.  America = bunch of sheep.  That's the issue ✌🏻
What a cesspool twitter is. These same people trashing Mariano are the idiots that will be voting for Biden to be the President. A man that doesn't even know what year it is or what his name is.
Oh no, MURDER believes Biden would be any better?! 🤣
Seconded. Add in Northampton too. Biden should win the two PA counties back by at least high single digits to low double digits, but Trumbull will be a bit tighter imo.
Why aren’t you all followers of Biden? Go now and follow him
Of course and my favorite Vice President is Joseph Biden
I can not wait until  I can  say  President Biden
I can not  wait until I can say President Biden
Even if it's off my that margin (and let's be honest, it's wrong) Biden wins by 5 or 6.
Biden specifically asked Obama not to endorse him until primaries were over, you dildo!
An interesting thing about those spry polls, if you take them at face, Biden still wins 277-261 (assuming NE and ME 2 go red and he wins all of Hillary's states)
Personally I think Biden is easier to vote for than Hillary, but yes same logic applies lol
Looking forward to saying President Biden. If you like President Obama you will love President Biden
My favorite Vice President. Can not wait until I can say President Biden
President Obama saved me and my wife about 12,000 in one year for our health care. Thanks President Obama. My My wife and I voted for you 2 times. Joe Biden is my favorite Vice President.  My wife and I can not wait until we can say President Biden.
Seriously?  If you are one of the 19 people with a Biden sign in your yard, please review your choice.
Someone has to say it - if you honestly believe Joe Biden would be any better than Trump for this country, you're a fucking moron.   (I'm not a trump supporter - just letting you know you're a moron of you truly believe Biden is any better)
Which of Biden's policies is your favorite?
Okay great, but you’re okay with Biden‘s dementia? Other countries with laugh at us and electing him is an embarrassment
Biden will not stop that! Your plan is to destroy America. Truthfully you try that and see how fast the Patriots in America start fighting back. You will get a Civil War! I make no mistake about that and The Republican base is full of preppers and Militiamen vigilant for freedom!
They are right. This is how America will look under Biden. There was a time when the Democratic Party was actually okay. I didn't like their ideas but some were not bad but now the Democratic party is really scary like Joseph Stalin/Adolf Hitler scary.
“ you ain’t black if you vote for Trump” 🤔 -Joe Biden
I hope when this is over Biden gets what he deserves. Some nice applesauce and an extra hour added to his daily nap time.Biden makes Mondale out to be positively RUGGED 😂😂😂
The House Foreign Affairs Committee has subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents he turned over to a Senate panel that is investigating Hunter Biden.
I do believe that Barack Hussein Obama &amp; his comrades have more control of the Democrat Party than the Clinton’s. If the Clinton’s were in control than Hillary Clinton would be Biden’s running mate, instead of Kamala Harris. Hillary is still obsessed with being the President.
I’m going to make a prediction regarding Vladimir Putin’s response if God forbid Segregation Joe Biden wins. Dictator Putin will go on a rampage trying to reassemble the former Soviet Union as he has zero respect for Democrats &amp; he must be stewing how they constantly impugn him.
If Attorney General Bill Barr doesn’t finally do his job with regard to securing indictments against the Obama-Biden regime after the way he was treated then it will never happen. This isn’t political &amp; America isn’t a blasted Banana Republic.
Democrats never let a crisis go to waste &amp; none of these extended closures of businesses &amp; now schools would have happened if the Marxists like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama were in the White House. Bozo Biden’s handling of the Coronavirus resulted in 60 million infected Americans
Biden + 3 on 11/3. What do you think?
Fuck Biden

Campaign hard for Biden during normal working hours.
Scott Dworkin:  Trump has done business for decades in China; I don't know if Biden has done business outside the U.S. except on behalf of the U.S. gov't. Our allies, I'm guessing, would be vying for Biden.
Scott Dworkin: The worst is yet to come, but I'm not sure if it comes from Trump or if it's just reality. I watched Biden talk for about half an hour, &amp; it was so strange to watch someone with feelings, who cared.I don't know if I can handle that any more
If GOP &amp; Trump truly have as much faith in a robust V-shaped recovery as they say they do, this should be an easy sell.  We’ll be down to $0 in no time!  If that doesn’t work out, these triggers would ensure McConnell can’t filibuster future reauthorizations during Biden Admin.
This is crazy and Biden is accepting this because he doesn't respond to tell these destructive people to stop the torture and killing innocent lives.  Biden reminds me of the next (BTK).  Biden, Torture and kill them!  He doesn't care.

Laws being the key word - Obama Biden AFHA rile was never approved by Congress but an executive order which is why Trump could reverse it.
This is really difficult-Sure AF won’t be Biden or Trump/I’d love to say I’m “sure”, but I’m kinda waiting to see what happens. In 2016, I wrote Bernie in + the day he announced again, I told myself I’d do the same. Problem is, he’s been hurting my heart. A lot of ppl feel lost
I thought it was strange last week there was no pushback on Biden for calling Trump a racist, then this happened. I guess he already had this tweet cued up.
Harris turned out to be a mediocre - at best - candidate. Her only star turn was excoriating Biden in a debate late last year. She's from CA, which Dems will win easily. Her experience as CA AG would just refocus her and Biden's issues with law enforcement/CJR issues.
It’s an epic idea to use a tongue-twister for Biden’s slogan, considering he’s such a skilled speaker to begin with.  #BuildBackBetter

I'm seeing less ads in Harrisburg market.  The ones still running are the squirrelly fear mongering ads but they're not running every five minutes like before.  They seemed to have backed off since Biden finally started running ads.
He’s a grifter who moved to Bernie when Warren was no longer viable; I suspect if he would have moved over to Biden if he could have leveraged enough followers and monetized that move, but as he can’t this is where he’s at now. Sad.

"Look, there are some places where when the curve is going down, you can begin to loosen things, but we should have a mask mandate until we get this under control," Biden said.
Biden has said he would choose a female running mate and has faced pressure from the Democratic Party to choose a woman of color.
I hope that the Democrats savaging Attorney General at yesterday’s hearings will tick him off enough that they will finally do the right thing &amp; finally indict the Obama-Biden criminals involved in the coup.

But what gives most hope is that every time one of these articles comes out about Biden essentially adopting the worldview of Warren/Sanders economically, the obvious conclusion is this
They’re working with Bernie’s campaign setting up task forces for every domestic issue, due to the warm relationship between the two. Bernie wouldn’t go scorched earth at Biden at the end of his campaign bc he’s loyal and Biden respected him as a fellow Senator when few else did
“Clinton and Obama were operating under the shadows of the Reagan ‘government-is-the-problem’. I think Biden is the end of [that] and the beginning of something new, a touchstone of a view where the government was an affirmative force and public service was a noble profession.”
Great job by Maria to absolutely destroy Valerie on this obvious election collusion by   and  - why does it matter?  Because Biden who was deeply involved 4 years ago in trying to rig an election is running for the highest office in the land.

Failed? joe biden has failed but voted in favor for every socialist agenda since...... well 40 years ago? . A man who can even remember what day sate or state he's in. Or even debate because his mind is rapidly faded into dementia? That's who you want in office?
Propane Jane:  I think there's an acknowledgement that Biden needs to choose someone who will challenge him to move to the future; he will need to pass on institutional knowledge.
Propane Jane:  Biden knew out of the gate that he wanted to pick a woman. He knows he's a place-holder candidate who may only hold one term, who is to get Trump out of office.
Propane Jane:  The reasoning behind Biden's having to pick who he needs to pick is distracting from the fact that Biden is the guy who's going up against Trump.
Propane Jane:  I don't know who Biden will pick for VP; I still believe Kamala Harris would be a great choice for him. I see them as yin and yang, a great complement to each other.
Honestly if there was any other viable option for president besides Biden I wouldn't hesitate to vote green, yellow, purple, what fucking ever.   I can't wait until we destroy the Democratic Party, too.
Biden can be made to look very very bad by not debating.  I hope he tries that political strategy.

You sir are the ignorant one. If you say Biden is guilty, then you have to agree that trump is too. Both can be swung into a Quid Pro Quo story. The fact is trump did it as president and sought dirt on a rival, it was a deal to benefit himself.
Biden did it under the direction of Obama. He wasn’t going rogue or seeking investigations into his political opponents. Trump withheld aid to attempt to make a deal: aid for dirt. If you can’t see who is more at fault here... you’ve drank the trump jizz

Just wait!  Now this will set a precedent and allow Biden to send DEA officers into every city across the nation to confiscate automatic rifles from citizens.
Watch out!  Once you compromise  the federalist premise and move into absolute executive power, Biden will be able to deploy DOJ guards across the nation and confiscate automatic rifles from citizens.
The problem is this precedent means Biden will be able to send DOJ agents across the nation to confiscate automatic rifles from people.

The  of #PA today shows  holding a +23%  lead over  in the #NEPA region. Biden: 59% Trump: 36%  &amp; 2% undecided. Good news for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area Biden boosters. Only caution: region polled includes Lehigh &amp; Northampton counties.
A #PA pollster confirms what many national polling firms have found in the state: ⁦ is gonna lose. Trump’s total incompetence in dealing with #COVID19 scares voters. Lotta time left, but ⁦ has no plan to beat virus.
All they have left is Biden, and it looks like he is going to pick Heels up Harris to be his running mate.  If those were your options, would you be happy or mad?  Lol
Harris would be great as AG and Warren in the fed. VP I couldn't careless what race or gender they are, my only wish would be that they were progressive. In fact Biden will have my vote 💯 if he chooses any progressive as a running mate.
Me - Democrats pander for women and minority votes. KHive- You're a racist and misogynist. Biden- If you don't vote for me you ain't black KHive - #BidenHarris2020

Politico accidentally reports Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate
If Biden had any PR sense at all, he'd pick one of the other popular candidates, such as Sanders, Gabbard or Yang... but we know he's not going to.  He'll go with some party insider that nobody cares about.
I answered your question. I'm not giving Trump anything. There is no benefit if he wins. There is also no benefit in Biden's current policies. Only he can hand this election to Trump, by not attempting to bring more people on board.
Whose "letting" Trump win? The only person who will be responsible for a Trump victory is Biden by not bringing more voters to his side.
I've done that non-stop for 4 1/2 years. In the final 98 days you think we can concentrate on electing Joe Biden? Do you know what Biden put out today? I do
The Scotus is already right leaning. The time to have acted was 4 years ago, when we all filed behind HRC. Did you are commenting on a thread saying they aren't voting for Biden..  maybe you should go be useless elsewhere 😂😂😂
So Biden is taking questions from reporters.  How come they aren't shouting over one another to be heard like in any other presser? Why does Joe have to look down to announce the name of the reporter that gets to ask the next question?  #BidensFakePresser
Biden is taking totally "unscripted"  questions from the press.

I'm not confused about anything.  Bernie's "movement" is hurting the Dems, not helping them.  I've engaged enough Bernie supporters to know that to them, Biden is just as much the enemy as Trump is.
Why don't you just say you're MAGA already, because opposing Joe Biden and the Democrats is supporting Donald Trump.  Maybe you should just show up at the other convention instead.

And let me lay it out for you. Biden won because of black voters. That’s it. They literally saved his campaign.
MAYBE  read what you wrote. As if a few months of negative coverage is worse than the 30+ years Hillary endured. Biden didn’t do something right, he ran an awful campaign this cycle, but the base of this party said enough and picked who they picked.
Let’s just be honest though. Biden winning the nomination isn’t because he was some strategic campaigner. Hillary ran a far superior nomination campaign and was never not the frontrunner. 2020 had 6-7 different front runners until South Carolina.

I think she is great.  It was great that she actually pushed back at Biden in the debates.  But he should respect that.
How do I be the first one to vote for Biden
To me, it would be the ultimate show of loyalty if she was ambitious. She wants to be President, and her best path to that is to get the blessing of Obama and Biden.   I like Bass, Rice, &amp; Demings. They're great. But Harris is ready to be President RIGHT NOW. She adds enthusiasm.
The worst part is that there will be NO accountability whatsoever for these GHOULS. If we ever have elections again, the Biden administration won’t even push for hearings

At this point I think we need to ask ourselves who benefits from Dem voters being mad at Biden, from turnout being suppressed. These opinion pieces seem too well crafted specifically to anger people and we need to stop getting suckered.
Were you there when Biden was credibly accused? Did you see how the Democrats responded to that? Democrats will fall on their own swords to protect the Clintons.

Biden is proposing forgiving private HBCU debt as part of his racial equity plan, but it's odd to me to narrow relief that way.   POC go to non-HBCU private schools too. If you're forgiving public debt and private HBCU debt...why not just do it all??
Aside from the fact that Sanders appealed to independents more than Biden ever did (and that the "nonmember outside" *won* because lots of people despite both parties), I don't buy the idea that it was about strategy and not about what Sanders wanted to do for a second.

When I was 17 I helped my Mom who worked for Jesse Jackson’s campaign, We beat Biden back then only to lose to Dukakis. Jessie’s campaign was awesome and had so much energy I was stunned by the loss!!  It was a tough pill to swallow back then but yet here we are again!!

And then they will blame us Democrats as we clean up their mess. Just like they did after 2008. They will hold one of their Nazi rallies and decry socialism, Biden, healthcare, JFK, the Clintons, the New England Patriots, Pope John Paul II, the Emancipation Proclamation.....
What actually happened was Obama pressured all the moderate candidates except Biden into dropping out at the most strategic possible moment. Plus using the pandemic as an excuse to shut down polling stations, especially on college campuses, where Sanders voters were likely to go
If Biden is listening to a piece of shit like rendell, we’re all in trouble.  I think he’s done a disservice to all the VP candidates especially Senator Harris by dragging this out so long.  It’s ridiculous
He really wants Biden to win even if it's fraudulent.
Well said. As the father of three grown brilliant young ladies, said instinct has been absorbed internally more often than not.
The latent racism aside, isn’t this particular VP pick one that biden would want to be outspoken, ambitious, etc?
You seem to think "Sleepy" is a derogatory name for Joe Biden.  America has a massive case of Trump Fatigue.   A "sleepy" President who doesn't keep us up at night is exactly what most of us want.  It's why you're going to lose.
Rendell is a crook and a career corporate mob blowhard. I had the displeasure of working for the PA Democrats while he was governor. If he says not to pick Harris, then Biden should pick her immediately.
What is the purpose of having Symone Sanders and Karine Jean-Pierre as part of the Biden team if they won’t or can’t stop this mess?
Why is Nina Turner at any table?  She’s always abrasive and combative...she should not represent Biden or Kamala in any capacity. The Bernies are still bitter and vindictive...they’re more committed to vengeance than beating trump.
A. Sometimes people *need* to be rubbed the wrong way so they stop behaving like misogynistic pricks. B. See point A. #KamalaHarrisForVP #p2 #Biden #EdRendell #VoteBlue2020
Maddy is a beautiful young lady with much more going for her than the little punk who posted the picture. Plus points for Dad for not giving in to the instinct to kick the kid's ass.
I dont like Clinton, Trump or Biden. I voted for Clinton anyway. Biden is a worse candidate but Hillary was more disliked. Trump only won because there were many people who thought he had no chance and just didnt think they had to. These two elections are awful.
Not sure that’s going to happen!!  I truly believe he only won cause a woman was running and because it was Hilary(emails and Benghazi). Biden is just senile. But Trump is a moron. Senile trumps moron. 👍
still thinking about that time joe biden owned mike bloomberg and also himself by claiming that he, a republican, does not endorse republicans.
Good lord. Biden is basically a Republican. You have no other talking points?
Chris Wallace talks Biden VP pick, 'embarrassing' Barr hearing and Trump 'stoking a brush fire'
He didn’t address the notion of any adult taking advantage of minors at all, let alone address any scenario where the offender is above the age of 19. He still says rape is rape. The average rapist age is 31. A high school couple is entirely different from an adult to minor.
I like beer.😂 I ❤Glenn. I'm voting for Biden. I wanna come too!
There should not be any more doubt after the disgusting political motivated eulogy Obama spit out yesterday. Filibuster??? At a funeral??? This POS was the harbinger for the extreme Left's anti- American stance. Obama started ALL of this. And Biden was right along side of him
Sorry gang I just made a donation to the Dementia Society of America® in honor of Joe Biden .
A lot of Trump's 2016 appeal came from a mysterious factor about him. Now that we know what he's really about, that vote is gone. And there is less hate for Biden than there was Hillary. The math doesn't add up for Trump to win 2020
I certainly have my preference but I'm kinda ova it, whomever it is I'll vote for the Biden ticket up and down ballot.
The sad part is that Biden doesn't need to do interviews or campaign for that matter. He's still up huge in the polls because Trump keeps shooting himself in the foot
None of us on twitter are a part of Biden’s team, so making these assumptions is stupid.
I really don’t care who Biden picks, but please don’t let it be Bass. There’s so many things that could go wrong.
I PRAYED he picks her. Trump pulled troops out of Germany as he left other soldiers to die because Putin’s bounties. We NEED the 2 most qualified people and that’s Biden &amp; Rice. NO MORE “ cult of personality “ people PLEASE. This country needs to heal. BOTH READY ON DAY ONE 🇺🇸
Yeah, Biden can maybe stay in his basement.
He said words...Biden sniffed kids #CreepyJoeBiden
I agree. It’s childish to refuse to work with people because they don’t 100% adhere to my opinions. That’s why I plan to vote for Joe Biden. But that won’t stop me from criticizing a lame duck fringe candidate who couldn’t even get 1% of the vote.
It didn’t happen while Barack Obama was President and it won’t happen when Joe Biden is President.
A new poll states most Trump supporters won't accept the results if Joe Biden WINS ! Aww isn't that just tough shit . We had to live with the fucking POS 💩 you voted for , for 4 years and he didn't WIN the Electoral College handed it to him . 😠😡
Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden – Raw Story
was praising China the other day. Some people are asking why? Her husband has business dealings with the Chinese government, that’s why. And if Biden wins, they’ll cuddle up to China. Just like before. #CorruptDemocrats  #DoNothingDemocrats  #Oligarchy
And then people won’t vote for you and then we have to your kvetching about Joe Biden.
Yeah man, No idea why he singled me out on the lame Jesse Ventura post and retweeted at me his stupid Biden BS! But then again he already has everything like health care so why does he give a fuck!
Literally lacking any shred of self awareness. “See this stuff happening right now while I’m in office? This it totally what would happen under Biden!!!” #Biden2020
I can assure I have never fucking looked at a kid and said that or thought it. That's fucking disgusting. Why are you symping for pedophiles? Do you not hear how fucked up what you are saying is?
Don’t confuse my intense dislike for Donald Trump as an endorsement for Joe Biden.
No,  there had it the first time. Biden stands for all the things that gave us Trump in the first place. Fascism will just grow stronger under Biden. “The fire” is rising fascism, not just having Republicans in office.
I think so  I find it very entertaining  Good luck voting for Biden  Let me know on November 4th how you feel  Don't do anything crazy

Pretty much, the Vote Blue No Matter Who people who ride with Biden.
And this is how you start a civil war. The racists against the non racists  New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots
It also takes away from the incredible accomplishments of the other women on his list who, in their own right should Biden pick them, have every reason to be Veep. It would not be because “Kamala Harris has career goals”
"The revolution will come but the first step of the plan is to elect Joe Biden" lmaoooo 🤡🤡
if y’all don’t vote for biden you are condemning the country to a racist judicial court for YEARS. two supreme court justices are leaving during the next four years so whoever is president will appoint the new ones. please think about our future and our children’s futures
rendell is NOT a member of that committee. but wtf was he was asked his opinion for this article?
Were you in a coma during the Obama-Biden presidency? Maybe you can find a chart showing jobs growth during their time in office. Oh look, here's one:
That's likely. In the scenario where he wins all of those states, he's likely hanging onto GA and TX as well. But I've said it from the word "go", it's coming down to PA, WI, and MI. If Biden takes those 3, trump has essentially no path to 270.
He was not eulogized.  He was used by the Democrats to grandstand  the Democrats narrative.  It was a political rally to help Joe Biden who will not come out of the basement.  Very little of the man was spoken of - would like to know the minutes breakdown on event.
Black Lives Matter. So why do Vice President Biden, the Democratic Party, and teachers’ unions oppose the most successful means for African Americans to achieve the American Dream?
Defend your orange hero at any cost.  Biden predicted back in April that Trumpy will try to delay the election
Exactly what I said months ago!! Spot on!!! Pence will have to do it and I hope Biden makes a REALLY good dig at him for it, too!!
How many Biden flags have you seen flying in front of people's homes  Just because MSM Carry water for the liberal cause  It does not mean that I am on the wrong side of history You will see in less than a hundred days
Communist China has developed a very aggressive stance regarding contiguous nations  They are donating to the Biden campaign  They are waiting for a week president so they can take Taiwan
*Shows images of protesters*  "THIS IS JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA"  Literally in Trump's America.
Yeah, Pelosi is a very savvy politician, but she should stay out of the veepstakes.   After reading that Atlantic article on Bass’s Cuba ties, I’m convinced she’d be a disaster. Biden is already soft with Hispanics, and he doesn’t need any more liabilities on that front.
I’d say about a week post Biden’s victory in November we will get “I survived the Trump Presidency” shirts and bumper stickers and then like 6 months later US military will be bombing Iran
Doesn't matter trump doesn't pay his bills. Vote Biden 2020.
I think a lot of people on the left don’t know what “victory” is. The goal was to get Bernie Sanders elected, not to get Joe Biden to half-heartedly think about possibly giving us part of a GND. We lost. Claiming otherwise is moving the goalposts!
I pray No one shows up at your fathers funeral and delivers a campaign speech on behalf of Joe Biden. May the Perpetual Light shine upon your father and, through the Mercy of God, May he Rest In Peace.
Joe Biden: I will beat Donald Reagan in December (stolen)
That’s very unlikely for multiple reasons. The biggest reason is that would be giving up a senate seat to a Republican Governor who names the replacement. Also, Biden and the DNC only care about identity politics, so they’ll pick a WOC who is a corporate puppet just like Biden.
Hi Denise, that's too bad because once Biden gets in he'll do it.
Biden ain’t the president. Why are you like this.
I feel like Democrats are not playing up the USPS story enough. I'm not super enthusiastic about voting for Biden but I'll sure as hell show up to make the post office a better service.
Honestly, I have been conditioned to expect Biden gaffes. But he is doing a great job at the podium. Clear answers, coherent policies. He was my favorite going in, but he is doing a lot better than I would have expected.   And his opponent is a gibbering lunatic.
Typical deflection lmao 🤣
True, that does seem to be his strategy (see QT). But it’d be nice to see some more forthright moral leadership.   Not saying I expect much from Biden at this point. But Bush used 9/11 to reshape US politics. Dems should be doing the same with COVID, imo.
It’s crazy out there.  In my recent travels, for every anti trump vocal social media poster, I saw 2 or 3 Trump signs or banners in rural areas and not a single Biden sign. This election is going to be fascinating.  My biggest fears are either Biden winning or Trump winning.
As much as I think it's not on Biden to chase down every jagoff with a shitty opinion about a VP possibility, this is dragging out way too long. The convention is late this year, dragging it out until right before is too much. Put an end to the speculation and posturing.
Imagine being so scared of losing the Joe Biden that you want to postpone the election. Lmmfao if you’re scared say you’re scared ya big orange fascist
Omg me and my mom are putting together a drinking game for the debate w Dump &amp; Biden!!!
Either you need medicated or you are on too much already. President with the Best Economy, Lowest unemployment rate, Brought more jobs back to USA (which btw Biden &amp; Obama said could not be done)had the MOST support for our men &amp; women in uniform.  TRUMP 2020 ALL THE WAY!
When Biden wins and the virus doesn't go away, I'll check back and see what you say about it.
Lol did you think this was clever Ronna? You better learn to love President Biden if this is the weak stuff you're gonna trot out
What was unemployment when Obama and Biden took over in 2009 and what it was January 2017? Google it IDIOT
The article was about ventilators, not PPE. And if you want to talk about that, talk about how the Obama-Biden administration didn’t replace the N95 masks used from the stockpile and how China purchased all of the surplus PPE on the market before anyone knew details on the virus.
LOL And all the liberal polls show Biden up by like 9 points. I don't think so
Hang onto this one for the next time  or anyone else says "No one could see this coming!" This "administration" is tragically stupid, inept and a complete and total failure. We can and we WILL do better. Remember in November. #VoteBlue #TrumpIsAFailure #Biden #p2
Will you return to your pre-trump tea party attitude if Biden wins and make absurd accusations like you did with Obama?
Where’s it say he’s taking about protestors when he said “shoot center mass.” Looks like he’s referring to suggestions, made by people like Joe Biden, that a violent person should be stopped by shooting them in the leg. He’s right about shooting center mass. That’s firearms 101.
Joe Biden Campaign Demands Staffers Delete TikTok From Their Personal, Professional Devices - Tubefilter
Bush was in office during the housing crash. Obama/Biden came in and fixed it. After 8 years, our economy was on track to continue to improve. Then trump comes in and it all goes to hell again! We have been cleaning up the Republicans mess for years! #VoteOutCorruptGOP
Trump is trying to bring back manufacturing to the US, at least he is making an effort to create jobs. If Obama(Biden) gets in, there will be poverty levels never seen by anyone alive today.
I am listening to you lie. President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden handed trump a playbook for handling epidemics. Trump threw it out!!! He knew about the virus in DECEMBER and did NOTHING !!! It’s trump’s fault that over 152,000 are DEAD because of him !!!
There are only trump supporters and former Bernie supporters who keep having the establishment cram their shitty candidates down their throat. No “Biden supporters”
Huh? Warren is looking more and more like the pick. Just cause the news no-one watches doesn't mention her doesn't mean she's out. Hardly. Every plan biden releases is one of hers or uses the same language. They are holding a fundraiser together tonight ect ect ect.
Warren for Senate Majority Leader, at this point.  Betting markets have it as Harris, but Ms. Clymer is right: only Biden's inner circle truly knows.
No. No we don't.  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #Biden #Biden2020
President Trump refused to back down on Thursday afternoon from his suggestion earlier in the day that the election be delayed, something he has no authority to order and that top Republicans quickly rejected.
Look at this troll... hilarious. He starts with “In all fairness to” and then proceeds to trash Biden. 🙄🤣🙄 I’m sure idiots (MAGA) might fall for that. You do understand, komrade troll, that Trump IS the ultimate puppet? And of your leader Putin, at that? There’s no hiding it.
Joe Biden could NEVER keep a schedule like this.
My parents didn't vote for either of them in 2016 and are firmly Biden this time
Hopefully the media doesn’t call him dovish. He has escalated conflict with Iran and emboldened their hardliners there whereas Biden, genuinely dovish voice in the Obama adm, would get us back in the Iran Deal and understands how to approach Iran:
Of course that will happen and if Biden wins too.
Biden is smart enough to know the base of the party wants substantive, progressive reforms and he is willing to listen.  That's a good start.
Oh I know the piece was different from the tweet. I also can’t help but laugh at when it’s GOP members it’s “plans” when it’s someone like Bernie, Biden, Obama, Pelosi, AOC, etc...it’s a “manifesto.”
Joe Biden shoot fire these guys on day 1
I don’t like either Biden or Trump but I don’t think any organization should choose a side. Everyone has the right to choose who they want. I would never donate money to a politician in any scenario.
Come on! Let’s tell the truth! Obama /Biden were busy trying to save the economy from the housing crash you Republicans let happen! Now the U.S GOP shrinks by 32.9% in Q2! Really? Lowest numbers in history!  As always Dems will have to save the economy again!
Mark my words, Sarah Jessica Parker will be Biden's VP pick.
I cringe when Joe sounds overly confident about Biden winning the election.  There are still a lot of Trump voters out there.  Don’t get a false sense of security.  #Vote 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 #MorningJoe
I'm a little west of Pittsburgh and I've not seen one for Biden.  Tons for Trump.
How can you put out these lies!  Read Biden’s proposal!  It says nothing of defunding and he actually wants more funding for police training.  His Trump’s lying stndrome contagious??
Hunter is living his life he's not worried about you or you're corrupt family, and you really need to chill on that because there are so so many skeletons that Biden could unearth on all you Trump's and it ain't pretty, btw you're not working on any Charities are you, you thief..
I worry about this as much as I worry about a second tRump term.  ~40% of registered voters are going to be going around angrily denying the legitimacy of Biden's election, claiming massive voter fraud and deep state conspiracy.
I can't remember seeing a Biden sign yet.
You are one of a kind , a small business owner voting for Biden ?

Girl bye, and you think trump is good for woman, and you who committed adultery with his son should be ashamed of yourself. Joe Biden doesn't rape women, but we know who does..
Joe Biden: “My biggest fear is that Trump will steal the election.” As dangerous as I thought Trump would be, I didn’t expect this back in 2016.
Without Biden
Fair hit, but I think Biden's implication is that he won't even use Twitter as president. I'm sure he doesn't LIKE being on this hellscape of a platform.
Biden daddy long hugs lol
You liberals were defending joe Biden months ago. Fvck off.
You’re only attacking trump supporters of doing the same thing you do for biden. Remember when he was accused of sexual misconduct and possibly rape. And thousands of you used whataboutism.
Weren’t you liberals defending joe Biden sexual misconduct a months ago? So weird. Well I guess you must have forgot.
Mr Biden’s team is going slow in the left lane. What’s Ms Harris supposed to do?
Trump seeks truth and is exposing corruption. Biden doesnt give a shit and only cares about himself and filling dirty politician pockets.
I pray so hard that Biden wants you by his side. God please!!!!
You said you’d rather have Donald Trump. Trump is a helluva lot closer to Caligula than Biden is.
Nah it’ll be Ted Cruz in 2024. He’s already working on it. He’s been on a few pod casts saying both parties are corrupt. He’s going play the populist. Biden has to deliver on everything or he’s done.
pls god don’t tell me things biden has done in comparison to trump when arguing politically. no one genuinely wants to vote for biden, we just have to lol
Biden and Trump are both abhorrent
Hillary lost northeastern Pennsylvania by 13 points, and that Franklin &amp; Marshall poll has Biden winning the region by 23.
Why so they can take votes from biden we know what your doing
If you prefer Trump to Biden, you weren’t gonna vote for Biden anyway. The goal isn’t to get yinz to switch your vote. It’s to get yinz to stop lying.
Well...... funny thing is..... you’re using all this footage about “what America will look like under Biden” with footage of what TRUMP’s CURRENT America  looks like.... you’re blinded by ignorance.
Listen to your supporters, you screwed them once again. You abandoned this army of followers, that you promised, you promised you would change things. And now you want me to follow Biden? Fvck that. I will not stop until the Democratic Party is destroyed. #CorruptDemocrats
Actually this started with voter shaming over Biden, something I think all independents have grown very tired of!!!
And you appear to be an anti-democracy supporter of fascist rule. You have no significance. ❤️KathyGriffin, BIDEN 2020!
When were you brainwashed? You used to be smart. Now you are a shill for the corrupt trump syndicate. WTF happened to you? BIDEN 2020. Prison for trump 2021!
You must have meant the SEC after Biden takes the oath of office. Don't be surprised if this Admin literally burns the books on the way out.
That is to say that leaving the presidency open, will have lasting effects. Because the president has a lot of power over other political realms. I'm voting for Biden not because I want to but because Trump's already appointed so many judges and his cabinet is trash
your more worried about your own election then endorsing biden because your constitutes will ask alot of question is being a scared sellout. undercover republican🤫. So are you voting for trump or are you not going to vote and be a hypocrite.
Lol my mom’s republican cousin blocked me and my little sister on Facebook for disagreeing with her comments on my sister’s posts about BLM. In her comments she defended f*x news, got the meaning of “defund the police” wrong, and compared Biden to her mother, who has dementia.
I'm not voting for Biden but this is just dumb.
Entire bags of mailed ballots have gone missing, not to mention bags that have been swapped.  The U.S. Postal Service has indicated they are supporting Biden.  How easy for them to swap out bags of ballots to favor Biden.
"I wasn't sold on the idea of voting for Joe Biden but then I saw Briahna Joy Gray criticize Donald Trump. Now I'm with Joe all the way!" Said no one ever, idiot.
They only use a fraction of the polls that 538, JHK, et al use. They list non-partisan polls as "democratic polls", affecting their weight. They also removed election odds from their homepage once they began favoring Biden.
NOT A CHANCE! #Biden #Biden2020 #TrumpVirus #TrumpMeltdown
So this is why you should still hold your nose and vote for Joe Biden.
Think about this for a second, your options are Donald trump, joe Biden,  jo Jorgensen, and Kanye west.
It is literally Donald Trump's America.  Joe Biden isn't President yet.  You are describing something that is happening on TRUMP'S watch.
If I may politely amend your post - President and Dr. Biden.
Joe Biden is a corpse... however I don't feel threatened by him so he has my vote. Look, I'm doing my part!
Because you're presenting a scenario in which Biden doesn't win at least one out of AZ, NC, GA, TX, OH, IA... That's certainly possible, but not especially likely at the moment.
Imagine being so scared of loosing to Joe fucking Biden that you suggest postponing the election?? If you’re scared say you’re scared you big orange coward. LMMFAO
For Biden, the best thing would be to have all of us citizens locked up, unemployed, hungry to create a far-left dictatorship, it's pathetic.
Biden is doing good. He just needs to do the typing and not talking and use Obama for votes
I mean as this would be reason enough to vote for Biden 🤷🏽‍♀️
Can't be afraid to make decisions. Thank god he's president and not Biden. Biden has to think where he's at.
His only accomplishment was “making healthcare affordable”?  It was, to quote Joe Biden, “A big fucking deal”. They have been trying for 50 years to get something done to help out average Americans. All you have to say is “Thank You”.  #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything

And settling for Biden is why we are here. Why America has constantly been declining for decades. When people settle and don’t fight back. This is what happens.

Still better than Biden
Like this is even Biden using Twitter. 😂  We know he’s home in the basement listening to his record player.  Have some Jello and take a nap, Grandpa. Nighty-night.
And how many lawsuits have been brought against Biden for being a pedophile? None. Trump? 4.
Harris was such a malicious prosecutor.  Fits right in with Biden's crime bill.

This mom is voting for Biden.
To the people who say “Joe Biden isn’t interesting enough,” yeah we know! That’s the damn point
One of the most creative approaches to business ever done.  A company steeped in chemicals, a facility open for business, and a workforce starved for employment. Could an idiot like Obama or Biden do this. Hell No!!!!!
Aren’t you the guy that couldn’t even beat Joe Biden in a primary ?
All I look at in these polls is Biden’s share and he keeps getting 50+  A lot of these “D +11!” polls are just DJT only getting his basement 40. He’ll get more than that, but that’s not “tightening” really.
The "In Joe Biden's defund the police America, you die if a criminal breaks in because nobody answers 911" commercials are so comically bad I won't be surprised the WWE produced them.

For sure no! Biden is a statesman. He wasn’t my first choice, but I’d vote for my 4 year old nephew b4 voting for trump, so, there’s that! Biden will allow the nation to take a breath and nerves to settle a moment while we think as a nation about real changes we need to make.

I have to say....it really deeply upsets me that absolutely no one in Hollywood has spoken up about the sexual assault allegation against Joe Biden. As a survivor of sexual assault myself, it just hurts. Terribly. My heart is with you,  xoxo ❤️💕
My father in law has dementia and I'm his caretaker. When he talks, he doesnt even say words, its just mumble jumble or if he gets word out it has nothing to do with anytging.  I really don't see Biden having demetia, but I respect your  opinion on it as well.
I don’t even think Biden knows George Wallace from George Washington. Although I think he probably used to play sports with both in his early years 😂
I can’t wait to be a slave under daddy Biden.
They said that when it was Hillary and RBG lived. Plus by the time a Biden presidency would end, two more justices will be in there 80s and you’ll be telling me to vote for another neoliberal for the same reason. I’m not willing to wait 20 years for change.
Charles what do you think about Joe Biden's opinion of this African American Doctor who went to school in Nigeria?
Clinton had a net favorability of −12.6. Biden has a net favorability of −1.6.
She’s a Biden supporter. So yes.’
Polling gave Clinton a 3-point lead in Michigan, 2 points in Pennsylvania and showed Trump narrowly winning Florida. Only Wisconsin was wildly off at 6½ points.  Biden has an 8-point lead in MI, 7 in FL, and 6 in PA. Trump has no room to maneuver.
If you question Biden.. The best music meme vid.. Enjoy..
I so excited keep up the good work my son is a Trump vote my Union Dem husband Trump vote my 25 yr old daughter mad at me but definitely Trump my youngest 20 year old daughter not Biden for sure just need to move her a little bit more
anyway it’s only gonna get bigger this year bc there’s nothing to get excited abt either of them. voter turnout for obama was big bc ppl were excited. instead of trying to bully ppl try to idk make biden more appealing lol
I usually rant at 1am but I’m doing it now. the “if you don’t vote for biden ur selfish/demonize nonvoters” motto is really fucked. here’s why: this idea u have cooked up in your head about rich white leftists not voting bc “i dont wanna😤” a TINY part of the non voter percentage
I’m not sure what’s funnier in the replies: Pence having a better chance against Biden or the 25th. Did you see Pompeo’s shit eating smirk at the beginning of the Senate Judiciary Hearing? The cabinet is wall to wall boot lickers.

The racial wealth gap expanded in Joe Biden's forty years of service as a Senator and Vice President.  Why do you expect him to fix it in four years?
Biden is dying to debate. It will be very socially distanced, though. No audience. That plan is already in the works.
A major part (perhaps the key part) of running a presidential campaign against an incumbent is framing current social problems as results of the incumbent’s political agenda. Ideally such framing would invoke the incumbent party’s name as well. When in 2020 has Biden done either?
China supports your efforts.
You are confusing Biden landslide with trump poopslide
Voting for Biden instead of the man with 24 sexual assault cases against him. The man who said he was more sexually attracted to his (then) 13yo daughter than his wife. The man who has over 2,000 active lawsuits against him.  It’s a no brainer.
He is campaigning     Since Biden is mostly stuck in the basement
Joe Biden is exactly what you need now to heal the country... 🤧
. The only reason they are saying Biden is picking a black woman ,is because they want the black, and the woman vote. Do they care about back and woman, hell no, only on election day. Wake up already.
No! Just stop! Biden was right &amp; every American should be concerned for our democracy. There is no both sides to this!
I am unsure how Biden got a reputation as a more decent person than Trump: there's sniffing, mass plagiarism, segregation/Confederate support, and name calling supporters. He's quoted Mao + Muhammads call to Jihad.   There's the Tara Reade issue as well. Just vote policy, lol.
Absolutely voting for Biden.  Your little tweet that just parrots what Donny screams in his rallies is a complete joke.
Just breath it will only bring you down to their level.  I often wonder and now will do,  put a Biden flag in a military community.  Lets see if I get the same respect...
A white moderate voting for Biden told you this. Didn’t they?
Settle for Biden? LOL
Vote BIDEN on NOVEMBER 3RD and end this ridiculousness
Nope. Neoliberal politicians like Harris and republicans like Biden turn off voters.
When Biden was VP, he and Obama did nothing for people getting evicted in 2009. They oversaw the largest annual evictions history.
Biden played a big role in creating the conditions that created Trump, I don’t understand how repeating that mistake will get us a different result.
With any luck Biden’s lead on election night will be impossible for you to overcome.
Trump's packed the Courts and since they have no further use for him and can see that he's going to lose. they want Pence to run against Biden.
Joe Biden filibustered segregation and called it a racial jungle but that’s your candidate 🙊

#WeWillVote   Voting in person...nothing like pulling that lever for Biden!!
That’s a no for me. I don’t feel Biden and Warren would make a good team, plus two 70+ year olds on a ticket is a bad move. I think the best choice is Kamala Harris.
Poll shows rising voter anger toward China as Trump and Biden try to seize the issue  #MTPDaily #CHINA #CNN

They link their sources... And I don't like Clinton Obama or Biden so....
Imagine being told 10 yeats ago Joe Biden would appear in a presidential poll with Donald Trump...and Kanye West
I am a Pennsylvania Republican who was happy with Bill Scranton and his fellows. I respect your choices and  your honesty but I see the company Mr. Biden keeps and am very concerned that a vote for Biden is a vote for AOC, Omar, Pressley and chaos. I will be voting for Trump.
You thought Joe Biden should apologize for suggesting Trump would delay .

Do you think that Nikki Haley is unaware that Biden was 1/2 of the dynamic duo that handed off the economy to Trump?? Trump barely moved the needle, compared to what Obama/Biden accomplished...
The total dunce to Biden has already won. Get used to it
It crossed my mind that the House might even be able to elect Biden Speaker (doesn't need to be a House member) in the first weeks of the session. Not sure if that creates different problems.
The Democrats won’t make the same mistake again. The election is over. Biden is your next president. Get used to socialism
I just don't get how a famous person with tons of fans like Tommy Chong has no problem laying them out to roast by retweeting BS at them! it's absurd! Fuck Trump, Biden and Tommy Chong!
#we will vote for Biden
That would waste a lot of political capital. This is a chance to choose someone to do political dirty work and set up a legitimate election. That person will bear the brunt of calls of illegitimacy for Biden, IMO. They’d either make Biden PPT or set up an election for him IMO.

Elect Biden. Then we nominate Obama to the next vacant Supreme Court vacancy.
I'm on board! Nurses--sign up, get active. A vote for Biden is a vote for better health care, a real covid response, and respect for all of us.
Am I wrong or didn't Congress under Obama and Biden pass an additional $25 per week???? And you're complaining about $200???
Trump putting the idea out is good strategy.  gop voters/leadership will support the idea 100% . Floating a delay keeps feckless Dems on defensive and enough potential Biden voters who feel beleaguered could tap out.
At least Biden won't shit all over the Constitution.

I don’t support Biden, Trump asked black people “what do they have to lose” by voting for him, your point? Also neither of those things matter in terms of cheating elections genius
The fantasy Rush is reading about Trump not running to keep from losing is exactly why Michelle Obama won't run against Trump. She doesn't want to be the Obama that lost. Biden is about to join Hillary as a three time loser. Mooch will go run in 2024.
Tommy Chong voter shaming for Biden!!! He will pit his 400k plus subs against you so you can get called a trump fan!!!
Masks are intended to prevent an infected person from spreading covid.  I wouldn't expect a Biden supporter to understand that, of course.  Or 4th grade arithmetic.

"Mark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held," Joe Biden, April 24, 2020
In a speech to this Cops for Trump rally in Greensburg, VP Mike Pence accused Joe Biden of “coddling the radical left.” More
Huan - The 2000 election proved otherwise. Also, Biden has painted himself into a corner because he believes in the system. And if you believe there are no flaws in the system, then you can not dispute it if you lose.
So that's what our country has gone down to huh  Nazis for Trump  And socialists for Biden  What happened to this regular American people
I feel like Pence just lost a voter. Dump truck drivers for Biden 2020
or it was clearly a dark skinned Biden supporter who poisoned him.
Obama won here by 11 points. Casey beat Santorum by 17 in 2006. My guess is that Biden will land somewhere in between that.
Why would Mashed Potatoe Head trump want to remoldel the White House for President Biden?

Voting by mail in Pittsburgh, Pa for Joe Biden.
What's in it for Tommy Chong? He literally went to federal prison for weed because of people like Joe Biden but yet will polish his noob any day of the week know!!??
Either way there's no way to delay this election and I cannot stand the fact that Trump smells blood and knows that the more he discredits this election, the more his supporters will spew conspiracy theories and hatred and madness when Biden wins.
If Joe Biden becomes president you better keep him away from this little girl  You know how his hands like to wander
Granted I would be like, ok Biden, show me some proof of these alien deities. Maybe the aliens are real. Maybe I would still vote for him on day two. Who knows really.
I guess one reason this wouldn't work though after further thought is the risk that something happens in between the two days. Maybe after the A-L people vote, Biden tweets out some nonsense about worshipping aliens from Planet X. Then the M-Z voters have new information.
I like the sound of “Biden Bottoms” though

In April you said Biden “should know better” about saying Trump might try to delay the election. What are your thoughts now that Trump suggested delaying the election? #Election2020
VP Biden has never once called the police the enemy! Not once! Show the video or audio to us. It's a lie, just like every other lie in the Trump campaign. Remember the Covid-19 Hoax? As Herman Cain is it was a hoax now. Do you notice the VP wearing a mask? Why, if it is a hoax?
Lots of emphasis from Pence on restoring safety and security, and that Biden would be the antithesis of that promise. Pence says they need 4 more years to do that.
Biden is originally from NEPA which has famously great pizza
Pence: “The truth is you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”
Pence attacks Joe Biden saying he’d bury the country under a pile of red tape, adding Biden would target fossil fuels and fracking in Pennsylvania.
Pence: Even Joe Biden said not long ago that well-armed police become the enemy when confronting lawlessness in the streets.   Law enforcement isn’t the problem, law enforcement is the solution.
The initial point was about internal discord within the Biden camp not being reflected in mainstream optimism about Trump's defeat. YOU were the one who pivoted to Trump's shortcomings, which no one here would dispute. You're basically a trained seal with a one-track mind.
Or not. He might not mind being voted out. Then he can golf all day and tweet about Biden's dementia.
I read that Barr and Durham were not looking at Obama or Biden. Sad. I think they may skate.

My district will probably be Trump +15-20... but my town, interestingly, could go to Biden as it is trending Democrat fast.
President Pelosi is an even more frightening thought than President Biden.  Stark reminder that the Democrats don't have any capable leaders.
No one is. But Trump has made him. Biden is vanilla ice cream. Few love it but no one hates it. If someone says all we have is vanilla no one says “yuck!”  It’s “eh, fine. I’ll have some”.
Thats why I dont classify myself a republican.... i wouldn't vote for a Bush or a Clinton or a biden.... i vote TRUMP

I guarantee you no Dem sees Biden as anything more than he is.  Old time pol. But that’s ok compared  to Trump. Most dislike Trump but Trump worked very hard to alienate them from day 1 It’s seems most Trump supporters refuse to acknowledge even his most blatant bald faced lies.
All dang.... Pinocchio is at it again... quit lying to the American people.. it was ALL GOOD when you did it.. bye liar... Hello President BIDEN
Where are you to defend this? Is Biden still a liar?  Is Trump still God?  Are you an idiot?  The answer to one of these questions is yes.
Project Lincoln is ran by republicans.  Joe Biden is a good enough republican for them and many others that chose your dadbover Hillary. People hate Hillary just like your dad, but Joe is liked. He can walk down the street without security. Your dad hides in bunkers.
You should consider changing your handle. Biden 2020 makes Yang 2024 impossible. If Biden is only in office for 4 years then that means his VP will take over or a republican, there's no room for Yang in 2024 with a Biden Presidency in 2020.
Great choice in phones! I'm currently rocking a 6t. But don't you see that a Biden presidency will all but squash all of Sanders/Yang's momentum? The current Democrats aren't even very left.
I want Biden to destroy him but also not looking forward to the inevitable stand off where he refuses to leave office because it is rigged 🙄
Biden winning in some deep red states such as Texas, Georgia, The Carolinas, etc. will make it so all but the most hardcore of Trump loyalists need to move on. At the very least he must win by big margins in PA, WI, FL, and MI to ensure no unrest over the clear results.
Trump is terrified he’s going to lose to Biden in November. Simple as that.
Biden has agreed to 3 debates with Trump.  Why lie when the truth is easily verifiable?
Maybe. I could see him loving retired life. Golfing every day, and tweeting every time President Biden screws up again. Or touches a child inappropriately.
media don’t show you too much Joe Biden because it’s absolutely embarrassing 😂 dude doesn’t even know where he is half the time
scenario I thought of earlier today: trump contests election results until he makes backroom deal with incoming biden admin for immunity for crimes his administration committed. biden camp takes it without hesitation
Actually, pretty lame. You think someone who bungles what he’s saying as much as Trump does is going to outwit Biden this way? #sadTrump
The campaign of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said the last thing Pennsylvanians need is an unnecessary “photo-op” from a Trump administration official while the region continues to struggle with COVID-19.
Joe Biden on The Joe Rogan Show.  Show 'em what you're made of, Joe!  #RedPillBill 👉🐿️⛰️❤️ #TheJoker
People will stop being put in cages if Biden wins. We will have leadership during the pandemic if Biden wins, resulting in less death. Trump = death. Period.
Only fear I have is that mail-in voting will be regionally targeted well enough to swing a few key states, but I expect that Biden should win by enough to outperform it
His new tactic is the fear/racist one like in 2016. He signed a bill to stop low income housing in suburbs, sent armed DHS troops to create violence against BLM protesters, &amp; claims in ads that Biden wants to defund the police &amp; we’ll all die. Most have black men breaking in.
He cannot delay it.  What he can do is resign before getting destroyed by Biden, and get Pence to pardon him, which may not work either.  So, what's the over/under on him fleeing to Russia at some point between now and November 4th? 🤣
As a lifelong Pennsylvania Republican who proudly supported Bill Scranton and Dick Thornburgh I am so disappointed in people who bear the label of Republican but who live in some sort of romantic fantasy land where Mr. Biden, AOC, Ilhan Omar and Nancy Pelosi
Joe Biden has been running for President since 1980.
With all of that said above, I truly appreciate the efforts of any current and former GOP who are putting country over party and helping to elect Biden. We will be counting on you folks to start a brand new center-right party to replace what was once the Republican party.
So big Pharma is responsible for everything....don’t you see it’s all about screwing Trump?  Big Pharma doesn’t want to screw Trump.....they are more concerned with Biden winning....but hey you think Pharma is the problem....agree to disagree

Total bullshit. If Biden wins one of the first things that needs done is replace the post master general.
According to latest  Biden leads Trump 50% to 41% among registered PA voters.
Kamala Harris!!!!!   If something happened to Biden, she would be the best equipped to lead our nation.
A second opinion on Biden: He planned the Kingswood Community Center reference before taking the stage. It's in Wilmington, DE and he has some sort of history there. He was expecting people to laugh, thus the pause. It was like Jeb's "please clap" moment.
WELL THEN. It’s true, I am surely The Laziest when it comes to politics! Also definitely a Republican. This was a white Boomer’s response to me not voting for Biden. 🙃🙃🙃
Well, if you are truly concerned,  perhaps you could just concede to future President Joe Biden. Your terrible lack of leadership, as a national leader, has cost American lives, monies, and hope. You have stimulated national  paranoia, so there's that.
First compelling argument for a Biden vote I've heard so far
Biden Holds Large Lead Over Trump In PA, New Poll Shows
The poll indicates Trump might have difficultly duplicating his narrow 2016 win in Pennsylvania.
He's nearly as far gone as Biden. Have another drink George.
I was just up MI saw mor trump signs. Didn’t see 1 Biden sign. This was at the dunes at silver lake.

BREAKING: the biden campaign has announced they plan to outlaw illegalism
“How will Biden carry New York (population 19.7 million) without Boro Park (population 100,000)?”
Odd, here in PA we had a pretty good mail in vote in the primary. You are trying to keep the people from voting. You know you’re getting crushed and that states that shouldn’t be in play, are. Texas has Biden up by 2. Are you going to brag about the GDP release today?
Is this tweet about Biden or Clinton? I’m confused.
Biden’s list of crime chores is going to be so, so long.
Hoe do you account for Biden being so consistently ahead in these Florida polls then?
Surprised we haven't seen anything about biden having acquiesced to the highly ambitious Clinton already
Joe Biden should go on Joe Rogan's Show.  Why not?  #RedPillBill 👉🐿️⛰️❤️ #TheJoker
Once Biden is sworn in, not a lot trump can to, he will not be recognized as president any longer, period. Vote for Biden, let’s make it a landslide victory!
As much as I don't like Biden, this is actually sad to see.
A vote cast for a Democrat is a reward for violence, lies, deceit and destruction.  Voting for Biden to hope this goes away is like paying a ransom to kidnappers.
Exactly.  Florida is icing on the cake.  If Biden wins there Trump's done and it'll be close if he does.  He has to have PA which is looking good.
So to support Biden I have to pretend that he is not one of the oldest presidential candidates in history?  That is foolish.
The replies are just a brilliant collection of reasons why Biden and the democratic party sucks. People's brains are so poisoned on "Russiagate" that they want Biden to promise new endless wars
Biden most irrelevant presidential nominee in history. If the media didn’t care his water/message daily you’d never even know he was running.
Why are Democrats held to a much higher standard by our media? It was always an annoyance of mine - until Republicans started killing us. Based on how Biden and Harris have been treated so far, this shows no signs of letting up any time soon.
If you’re a liberal &amp; are still thinking about voting for someone who isn’t Biden...I hate you.
Hillary Clinton got 88% of the black vote. Joe Biden will at least get that.
your commercials are full of lies. No where did Joe Biden say he agreed with defunding the police. You can't even tell the truth even in a commercial.   Stop doing the devils work
Have you looked at Biden's site at all? Heard him (attempt) to speak recently?
Preempting VP Pence's visit to Greensburg today, the Biden campaign says the last thing Pennsylvanians need is a “photo-op” from a Trump administration official as the state struggles with a pandemic.
Joe Biden wrote the "crime bill" that decimated black families/communities by ripping parents out of the home for NON-VIOLENT drug crimes by mass incarceration of mostly black men/fathers.  Tell me again how Trump and his supporters are racist
LOL 😂 You keep trying to sell that  "Registration shifts across the state show Republicans are gaining voters at five times the rate of Democrats."
If at all possible if Biden wins on Nov 3 can trump be removed at that time before he starts a nuclear war!!
Was Biden not a VP who eventually went on to focus on becoming the President? Let a woman live.
I know a couple of Biden supporters that are white males over 50 that never went to college.
Wait. You mean we actually have to fight conservatives who think that Biden, Pelosi and Schumer are far left? No. I’m shocked. 🙄
Donald Trump Vs. Joe Biden 2020 Quiz: Who Said That Quote?
Biden is great choice for racist voters of demokkkrats
We’re rooting for America. A vote for Biden is a vote for communist China.
There are correct and valid reasons to not like Kamala Harris as a potential VP. Concern that she might be ambitious and want the Presidency isn't one of them. I would be extremely surprised if any Biden VP wouldn't be seeking the presidency considering he is 79
I voted for Sanders (mainly because of health care), and Biden does nothing for me. I'll still vote for him, but it would be nice not to be hectored about how I'm not sufficiently happy about it. I don't have to be happy. I'm voting to get the orange bastard out.
I live in Pennsylvania. Donald Trump won PA in 2016. The only way to make sure he doesn’t win it again is to vote for Joe Biden.
Easy for you to say in a solidly blue state like Vermont. But for someone like me, who lives in Pennsylvania, it’s mandatory to vote for Joe Biden.
I grew up in Butler County, Pennsylvania (very rural part of Western PA), and whenever I see old high school friends of mine on Facebook, they aren’t the least bit shy. They usually tend to show GIFs of Trump tying Biden, Pelosi, AOC, etc. to train tracks and running them over.
I wish I had a way to save all these "Biden will never win!" tweets. I feel like I should be checking back in on their mental health when he does win.  Good luck bud, you'll need it.
Love of the USA, which the Democrats hate.  But thank you for nominating a senile candidate.  China's candidate.
Biden said he wants to make steel here, at home, without buying foreign steel.  Will someone ask him how we will make that steel with no coal or no natural gas.  Where is he getting all that electicity to build all those power stations to plug those electric cars in?   Just ask.
Or Biden crushing Trump in PA.
Biden isnt pragmatic, its disappointing. Replacing Trump with corporatist Dems isnt a solution. It's a recipe for disaster. Who do you think destroyed the economy? Newsflash, not Trump. It was Rs and Ds over the last 20yrs who sold us down the river for corporate profits and GDP
Biden’s an old white guy who sometimes says dumb shit. He’s not running a campaign based on hate, division and fear of the other.
I mean, you're literally arguing we should vote establishment again, which is what gave us Trump and you're calling us insane for wanting to try something different. Do you not see how you've mixed it up? I say this as someone who will vote Biden. Dont expect me to like it.
So does that make Congress Nazi's since they make the federal laws? Politicians that have been in office for decades like Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden.
You are savage and so very intelligent don't ever forget it! Biden can't answer the questions hence why he doesn't get asked #Trump2020 #MAGA2020
If you listened to the mainstream fake news media, shouldnt we all be dead by now? I mean Biden claims half the country has been wiped out.
Biden stinks.
As a radical leftist I can tell you joe Biden is not giving me shit that I want
lol Biden is gonna govern like a Republican because he is a Republican. When voters realize he doesn't give a shit about them they'll stay home in 2024 and the right will benefit.
LIVE!!!  WE ARE NOT FOOLED BY BIDEN
I would vote ✅ for Biden even if he was Orange 🍊
Yeah too bad you had to go back 30 years to find something derogatory on Biden! 45 showed his racism today!
Substitute Joe Biden for Donald Trump and this makes perfect sense.
Or perhaps it’s working exactly as intended? 🤔 Biden has an HD pic of his notes taken with Kamala listed on top and now a Biden ally “leaks” an obviously sexist talking point that’ll boost Kamala’s profile even higher a week before Biden makes his VP pick. Timely coincidence? 🤷🏿‍♂️
Um, I'm not being emotionally manipulated by today's political agendas and I'm very aware of how unfair health care accessibility and costs are. The bottom line is: a vote for Trump is a vote for cruelty and incompetence. Up against that, voting for Biden feels like hope.
It really makes me feel some type of way the commercial about “joe Biden’s America” but the images they are using are literally from trumps America
It wasn’t immediately clear what segment upset the president during his flight, though he often criticizes Fox’s polling, which has consistently showed him trailing Joe Biden in the November election.
Who cares what Biden or anyone said? They weren't in the chair. A president is there to make the tough decisions, especially when they aren't popular.  Fauci and other experts were saying travel bans give folks a false sense of security, and the focus should be on mitigation (1)
Here’s a question: why is it “the perfect example of what will happen if Joe Biden becomes president” when you don’t seem to care that it is happening when trump is president?
Yeah. I’m assuming the Biden “recovery” will be very similar to the Obama “recovery” in 2009
and the media would rather shit on trump again bc as long as they can drill into your head the idea that joe biden is a better option for president thats all that matters 🤷🏽‍♂️
Joe Biden’s America.
Spoiler alert? Kamala Harris outed as Biden's VP pick -- maybe
If you replaced Muslims with Christians in this message would you be concerned?  They are misunderstood and marginalized so much.  I thought this was a nice message from Biden.

Trump shutdown travel while Pelosi was calling it a hoax and encouraging everyone to get together in mass gatherings.  This wasn't Obama/Biden's brutal mishandling of the swine flu, but it is definitely a much more contagious disease.
They don’t report it because you’ve made the whole thing up.  Mail in voting is absentee voting.  You &amp; Pence voted that way this year. Polls in minority districts closed &amp; stopping mail in voting means less democrat votes. You have to cheat to beat Biden. #VoteTrumpOut
All of you laughing at poor Joe Biden... Wait until they stop denying the obvious - they will pivot and call you ableist for noticing his condition.
This is why you must go to the polls to vote with ID. Post office, backing biden, will be a major cause of lost ballots and voter fraud. #VoterFraud  #VoterID
He said it himself. A Biden presidency will put everyone back to sleep! It’s easier to fight an evil system when it has an ugly face on it.
Love it. Ive seen about 10 biden yard signs and about 5000 Trump 2020 signs.
I like it! But they may like it too, considering all the shit coming out of the mouths of Biden, congressional Dems, governors, and mayors.
Nope. Kamala does not want to be AG and Rice has way too much baggage. I can’t deal with months of Benghazi again. Biden/Harris2020
What happened to #metoo guess it doesn't apply to Democrats. Tara Reade is very credible, and all I hear is crickets. Shows ya how crooked this party is. Joe Biden is an accused sex offender and all the so called activist and leftist media are nowhere.Just another example
As an addendum to your great VP selection series, please comment on the press reports of certain donors trying to undermine Kamala Harris as a VP option. What level of influence, if any, will this have on Biden’s decision.
Biden 2020 - He ain’t afraid of no ramp!
What do you mean I thought our stock was already worth $0, that’s what some of these Trumpster JPS are already saying. So, since I’ve already lost everything, no sense in that lunatic cont to run the Country like he runs his business. Hope Biden beats his ass. $fnma #fanniegate
Who would entertain the the thought of #HeelsUpHarris as VP?!  She wasnt even popular as a candidate! Why would that help Biden? Did she sleep with George Soros?
Their absurd, irrational attempts to unseat Trump have been comical. If Biden gets to 270 it’s either because they cheated or the real pandemic is stupidity.

Despair trolls out everywhere. Hit pieces by the media on popular democrats. Attacks by the GOP on the FBI. Bizarre distractions all over the place..  Yeah, someone is losing badly right now, and that person is NOT named Joe Biden.
I hate the fact that Biden and Trump are the only legitimate candidates. Two racist old white men. One will say it to your face with a gun in his hand and the other will say it behind your back with a gun to you
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
Why are these extremely elderly people still in political office!  RBG, PELOSI, BIDEN, etcetera and so on. Retire already.
Team Biden has been really savvy. He's had a few minor gaffes but that's it. He has hired great people.   Let some old washed up guys take some shit while you float trial balloons to the media. Biden can brush it off and no one will remember
Umm. That’s Biden’s handwriting.
As is typical, presidential candidates are worried about being overshadowed.   Considering Biden walks like a dotard on his last legs he better pick someone ambitious.
Covid-Don Trump is the worst president in the history of the United States of America.  VOTE BIDEN
We just want Biden people to help push him left. But instead y’all like.. sorry this is the best we got.
Well, Susan, u know ur way around dishonesty and distractions. But HRC spilled the beans. U were set up to spread lies to distract from the truth of Benghazi. Unless u knew the truth, in which case u lied to the American people. VP choice? I hope so. U would be Biden’s millstone
Did you see the Republicans questioning Google etc about showing favoritism to Biden? That will be their next excuse and if course all the fake news that 90 percent report on the same way. If it even comes from his mouth and he doesn't like it..that is fake too!

Never trump. Never Biden...hmm Putin , yeh that’s where your going. A vote that’s not Biden , is a vote for trump and there you go, a vote for Putin...
Luzerne County hasn’t voted Republican since Bush 41 in ‘88 and has voted for the presidential candidate who won PA since ‘32.   Trump won Luzerne by 26,237 votes and had the biggest margin of victory there—19 points—since Richard Nixon in ‘72.
In fact just yesterday he tweeted Make America Great Again! So he agrees Biden should and will get the job.
He literally does and you know it for a fact. Stop being ignorant. You’re only voting for him because you don’t wanna see President Trump in office again. Of course you don’t give a fuck about Biden..it’s all about “Trump bad! Orange man racist!🤬”
Oh hey look black people getting hurt again. Glad biden and Obama did nothing to stop this. Totally just not gonna vote. Both candidates clearly equally bad.  You fucking idiots.
We really gotta choose between this guy and biden oml im ganna cry
You bring up an important issue. But a vote for Biden raises the possibility of working on the inequities in the system. Trump seems to only want to make inequities worse, to the point that nurses (and doctors) and other Americans die from COVID.
I mean, Joe Biden is our nominee, but go off, I guess.
Sure. Because Democrats win by electing non-ambitious weaklings who never throw a verbal punch. That'll beat Trump. (Eyeroll).  This has to be bullshit.
I thought it was kinda obvious that whoever is Biden’s VP is they’d be the favorite in 24.
I agree the Democrats are running the same campaign as Hillary in 2016. A puppet candidate that will not be running the country. Others will call the shots.  Not
Def. Look at how many tweets Kamala has about Biden and compare that with other VP potential candidates.
You can block me but doesn't stop the fact  will be re-elected come Nov. Also, tell me what Biden plans to do as president because I cant make out anything he says or what his plans are? I've been trying to figure that one out for a while.
Seriously 😳 she must be confused like her buddy Biden.
Aren’t you liberals praising bush another white supremacists? Aren’t you liberals praising and propping up the Lincoln project. Run by white supremacists? Aren’t the same white supremacists voting for Biden. Weird huh.
Watch the other clips, or watch the Breakfast Club's video in its entirety, idc.   This is like saying that Biden's "you ain't black" was out of context. 🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️
I refuse to believe this picture isn't a wax statue of Biden
Thanks for the food for thought. The things I most want as a nurse: eliminate profiteering in health care, have universal coverage. Biden has a sense of why those matter, while Trump sees any kind of profit-making as good. He also doesn't care if nurses/docs are killed by COVID
It makes no sense since Biden also said he may only serve one term. There was talk of grooming beto like a year ago.
Kamala has done more for the campaign than literally anyone. Event after event. If Biden falls for this, he’ll lose a lot of respect in my book.
Really? Pizzagate? That pizza parlor has no basement. Podesta's pizza references are all in relation to late night pizza orders for campaign staff. Why are right-wingers so susceptible to far out conspiracies? Oh BTW...Water Island? Debunked
Dana perino: “Joe Biden is in a pickle” 🤣🤣🤣🤷🏿‍♂️👇🏿👇🏿
Bernie Sanders may have performed well in the rust belt states required to win the presidency, in some hypothetical scenarios better than Biden, but he was a particularly poor fit for the sunbelt states that matter the most for taking the Senate: GA, NC, AZ
Joe Biden said to shoot people in the leg, not the heart.
Yeah, who wants a ready-made Pres candidate when Biden bows out after 1 term.......Biden will be the problem for normal people? Not the fascist wannabe dictator in the White House now? I was under the impression that Trump letting his white supremacist friends run amok that that would be the problem for normal people. Thank you for clearing that up for me. 🤨
Keep America great!  Oh wait. Yeah, very bad unemployment #s, and pandemic is killing a thousand people a day again because he wanted all the states opened!  Lies about Biden is definitely the next play.
If you fly our great flag,please don’t disrespect it by putting a Biden sign on the property. It is like oil and water.
What is least worse option for Trumps ego?  1.  Gets HUMILIATED by a Biden in the popular &amp; electoral vote &amp; cries rigged  2. He wins &amp; gets removed from office by Dem controlled House &amp; Senate.   3. He bows out now saying its unfair?
Good, wish we had on here, Scranton , pa not the home of joe Biden that’s somewhere in Delaware
Joe Biden on 4 Nov 20
See that’s what a leader does not come up with fake tears like Obama and Biden did neorealism than once.
E. The media.  Trump has not been good for America's health, but I think the media gave us Trump.  Left and right media gave us Trump.   Clinton was fine.  Biden hasn't done anything.  We survived Obama.  Trump &amp; Trumpishness is toxic beyond policy.
Joe Biden’s America is Trumps America already buddy
That's why I am endorsing  for President.
I had the honor of serving in the Obama-Biden administration.  knows we need more family-sustaining wages, more affordable childcare, and a bridge between education today and the economy of the future. He has first-hand knowledge of our problems and of our opportunities.

I guess trying to portray Joe “I wrote the Crime Bill” Biden as a Marxist Trojan horse isn’t working
From a man who mocks Joe Biden on a daily basis. Very few people in this country do more to fracture the Body of Christ than Raymond Arroyo.
Former President Obama With much do respect sir you used your speech today to do a political campaign. Script reading, that’s not like you or are you available for hire now?   You still have been asked why didn’t you endorse Biden from the start??? Do tell sir.
😂 Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if they tried to go with more of a Twitter thing and say”Like” for Biden and “Retweet” for Trump.
Just more work for Biden to re-instate them in January.  No worries.
Voting for Biden!
Interesting ... Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
I'm in #PA07.  My guess is Biden +2.  That would be about a 3-point swing from 2016.
Biden just has to sit in the basement and let the Orange Man keep digging his own grave, which he's doing with alarming speed.  He's embraced white flight, sex with demons, and proposed moving an election that he has no Constitutional authority to do.   And its only Thursday.

Have you gals/guys considered that Biden will have a young-but-growing caucus pressuing him to move left?   Unless you think the  are completely incompetent, an  nagging the fuck outta biden or even in his ear means more equitable 4 years than these past
The 1% and baby boomers in particular, have been killing all who follow on purpose for personal gain for 40 years. This is far from new. They are inferior. They know it. Have to be removed by force. Biden's presence proves that yet again. Cancer doesn't cure cancer.
Don't you know everything is only happening this way because it's an election year. Biden did it. Don't worry about the last 3 1/2 years. They don't count! #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Trump's anti-Biden commercials say that if Biden wins there won't be any police and no one will be safe. Meanwhile in Trump's world now, the police that currently exist aren't being fair and equal to anyone.
Yes we can vote blue and for joe Biden in Pennsylvania. You did not do shit for my state. Where’s the clean coal?
By the way folks,  Joe Biden does NOT want to defund the police.  stop playing those ads. Fake potus.
This is one of the most #racust tweets I have ever seen against Joe Biden and Democrats from a Republican lawmaker’s Twitter account! Hopefully, the innocent person from the UK that is tagged in the lawmaker’s files a lawsuit against the lawmaker!
I just read that Google is continuing 'work from home' until JULY 2021!!!!  They seem to know more than we do.  When Biden is inaugurated, the mess he is inheriting.  And he'll get blamed for not ending it overnight, like a magic wand....
tRump out of the whitehouse I can get behind. But Joe Biden, really? Don’t get me too excited now..
And this is with Biden underperforming with Latino and black voters. He’s going to have to improve his outreach to them but if he can, he definitely has a shot at Texas
I’ve been saying this for years &amp; reporters 🙄!  “Many residents I spoke with, including die-hard Democrats, pointed out that the former vice president moved away from their city as a child, scoffing at the notion of Scranton being Biden’s “hometown.”
How the fuck does 40% of ANYTHING still think this coward traitor is doing a good job?!?!? Holy shit for the love of all that is Holy I hope Biden invests HEAVILY in education 🤦🏻‍♂️
Idk man, Pete dropped out extremely early, and was very quick to endorse Biden.  Biden had to have given him SOMETHING good, and it's clearly not VP.
Biden's gonna make Pete either an ambassador of some sort, or Secretary of State I feel.
I agree, but keep in mind that Karen could also help with progressives.   However, most progressives are going to be voting with Biden regardless, so it wouldn't make as much as an impact as someone like Duckworth, who isn't only an army veteran, but as you said, a midwesterner.
Kamala Harris, Karen Bass, or Tammy Duckworth.  Also, typically it's announced at the convention, so it's not really like Biden's putting it off on purpose, the convention is just later than usual (August 17th).  Regardless, I think he'll announce in a week or two.
That award went to Biden for his support of Robert Exalted Cyclops Byrd's racist, segregationist legislation.
He wouldn't have a problem if the trending tweets were all negative Biden tweets. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
I’m sure the Biden’s will appreciate it.

Trump will never see the similarities no matter how much they mirror each other. It's all a scheme by the Democrats to win the election - sneaky Biden convinced China to shut down the world just to oust him. But shhhh... It's supposed to be a secret. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
He can scratch PA OFF his worry list.  This is BIDEN country.  He can try to spin it anyway he wants, but on election night...he'll understand.
Joe Biden is not defunding the police
Civil servants. Are you serious? They are owned by the 1% who is making a fortune. That's what citizens United is for. Biden isn't legit. Clinton wasn't legit. The GOP hasnt been legit in 3/4 of the country for 20 years. Spare me the bullshit that this country is legitimate.

How is biden a radical? Radical to what who Biden was in the beginning?
While I had hoped Bernie Sanders got the nomination, I’m voting for Joe Biden, because anything is better than you!
Dems are the party of the KKK. Exalted Cyclops Byrd died in office only 10 years ago. Biden supported his racist, segregationist legislation.
Pennsylvania is NOT Biden country !! TRUMP 2020 🇺🇲
You won PA on a fluke...will be blue this time around...we will support Biden...Pa born..Scranton born
Should be Biden’s mantra. Do you agree? Help me hit 100. Per favore and FUCK TRUMP. 1st time I’ve written his name since 2017. Any media.
So, you're saying Republicans were wrong to not riot and destroy stuff when Obama was POTUS?  Thanks for the heads up on what we need to do IF Biden somehow wins...  If these are the rules the Left wants to play by, we should, too!
Too Too,Too BAD, find another sucker country that will pay your bills for you then you could slap them in the face. The only idiots who would put up with that are people who don’t care about the country, you know Pelosi, Schumer, biden, Clinton and of course the worst B.H.O

I’m a fan of your work and your podcast, but no. If you can point to one person who was set to vote for Biden but will now be writing in a mentally disturbed Kanye, then I will concede that you’re correct
I live outside Scranton. I'm hearing that a lot of Trump supporters are telling pollsters they're voting for Biden to skew poll numbers. Trump may actually be ahead here. I'm legit worried.

You say you’re not political but half of your twitter and podcast is political. Saying you want Biden in there and let him just sleep in the chair I think is irresponsible to keep pushing but you’re entitled to your opinion. I know you are more fair than some
Went to HS in Bethlehem. He’s the Biden of Scranton baseball players!
I have seen two of them. But, if i recall, say what ypu want about Hillary at least she had proud supporters and many of them. Biden has Nada.....
Trump would not have been up on Biden by 10, because of Trump’s racism, etc. and gaffes.
Northampton could be an Obama &gt; Trump &gt; Biden county.  The only question with Lackawanna is, "How much will Biden win by?"
Honestly. Good for Trump to just go ahead and say it. He isn’t looking for everyone’s vote. He wants white suburban women to be afraid if they don’t vote for him, Joe Biden will treat Black and Brown people like PEOPLE. MY GAWD THE HORROR.

It's a good thing Joe Biden isn't ambitious.
I’ve donated, attended online events and celebrated a few of his policies, but if Biden continues this he will get no more help from me outside of my vote. The welcoming of Kasich and the comments of Dodd shows they are not understanding this moment - at all.
I am so so riled up about this. The fact that Biden has these assholes in his inner circle making decisions about the campaign is absolutely disgusting. And the fact that it has ended up in multiple news outlets makes it worse.
BIDEN WILL LOSE#EvictTrump
maybe, but I'd bet less than you think. I think its a real short list of folks who are on the fence with Biden but would be swayed by VP. Most folks on the left at this point know either they won't be feeding the machine or they can't sit by with Trump as the opponent.
It will be such a landslide for Biden that you will absolutely know on election night.

It’s a Biden campaign ad.
I am using Biden so that I can understand why there is seemingly a disconnect here.
B/c Biden will be at a mass gathering where there essentially is no social distancing.  Yet, Mr. Biden is staying in his basement because of social distancing.  But the protesters do not socially distance and you claim there's no spike.  Do you understand the conflict now?
Assuming you statement is accurate, then it can only logically (and scientifically) assumed that there now exists no material impediment for Mr. Biden to be physically present at his political rallies and speeches.  If not, why not (i.e.please distinguish).
Was this a eulogy???? Or a commercial for Biden?
Jill Biden told Pittsburgh-area educators Tuesday that if her husband were already president, he would have had a plan to safely reopen schools. Teachers told her in a virtual call that they don’t feel safe going back to classrooms.

As of today, we now know trump is desperate and salty due to biden winnng the polls and his polling averages were oversampled/overpolled and didnt actual real primary elections his actual vote count was worse than any poll.
This is mainly who I am taking about. He is on the selection committee. He has been named in most of the leaks. So yes, surrogates. Donors going to donor, but to say they don’t have some control over this is false.

Biden slams Trump for promoting false COVID-19 claims from 'crazy woman'
Hmmm....Someone that said “racial jungle” is gonna do all of that?  Who ever is writing these needs to have a Joe Biden history lesson. Don’t worry, WE REMEMBER what he said and REALLY meant.
Biden- Rioters, protestors, anarchists, antifa, BLM, socialism   Trump- Police, military, Patriots, law and order, constitution and capitalism   Easy choice!!
Biden has already proven that he won’t be able to keep us safe without copying ideas from someone else (COVID-19 ring a bell?) What’s gonna happen when he has to come up with his OWN ideas for what we need for today’s market?  No thanks.
Absolutely! Mail in voting is exactly what the Deamoncrats want. Allowing them to change the vast majority of the votes over to the deamoncratic candidates. Once Biden is replaced as their candidate, odds are they will replace him with one of the hateful 4 unAmerican scam squad.
No! I think Joe Biden has cognitive decline! He could.become anyone's puppet!
"I'm Joe Biden, and I'm gonna catch a Joe Biden today!"
See, they are able to continue this cultist belief system because they know Biden will win in November, and then, when he does, they can say "Trump didn't get to finish his plan before he was forced to leave office by The Cabal".  It's a perfect plan.
The Biden q&amp;a was orchestrated and leads one to believe he is incapable of handling unscripted questions.
Burn to the ground and Biden becomes President. That in not acceptable.
That's why I am not voting for Joe Biden!
Joe Biden is not!
This is Nate's I need to cover my ass tweet in case things dramatically change in the race (which it will). We all know that by end of September the polls will narrow again as right leaning INs come home. Making it a 3-5 point Biden lead, making pop vote (solid D) and EC (lean D)

I can understand not liking Biden and not voting for him, but are you voting Trump?
Ha, no, they have been given the best hand ever. I think people in Biden's campaign are waking up to the fact that by the end of September many right leaning independents will go back to Trump regardless of Covid. So the Doc is right, they have to be clever to keep the senor vote
My sister, who dislikes Trump very much, said that Joe Biden looked like he is falling apart and Trump still looked strong!  My sister's unbiased opinion should make Democrats aware that that is what unbiased people opine about Joe Biden compared to Donald Trump -no debates yet!
What about Joe Biden who loved kids jumping on his lap; minority kids playing with his hairy legs; kissing, touching women;  sniffing little girls' and women's hair and enjoying every minute of it? Oh, and he was accused of rape too! Is that all right because he is Biden? Hello?
What about Joe Biden saying that he loved kids jumping on his lap and allowed minority kids to play with his hairy legs? Do you think he would have allowed White kids to play with his hairy legs since White mothers would have been offended by it?  What about his sniffing hair?
There isnt one. I am one of those trump to biden flippers, as is about 15 family members, all in PA.  I even talked to a friend, blind trumper, who is not voting.
Do I think Biden’s the answer? Hell no. But I know for a fact that 4 more years of a president that’s a sociopath with the temperament of a 12yr old, isn’t made for this. Tax cuts for the rich while we need extra to survive because billionaires need more. Right.
Grow up. He is the DEM candidate. It’s Biden or Trump. Let’s not have a rerun of 2016.

There is a plan. Pelosi will put a sack of hamberders on the end of a fishing pole and she will play Donald like a fat marlin and once he is out of the White House Biden will change the locks.
Its hilarious that trump is saying that biden is gonna cheat through main in votes but yet he's already trying to cheat by stopping people in Florida if they have a past felony and fines to pay..... 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ so now are we doing pay to vote scheme... smh fucking ridiculous
Someone with class and a sense of history. Thank you, Joe and Jill Biden.
The real Joe &amp; Jill Biden. Compassion, respect for this hero.
Yes, there's not anywhere near the amount of contempt for Biden right now as there was for Hillary in 2016.
now in the waning days of trump's first time, i feel biden and obama are soothing voices.  I am not scared, we will beat this attack on our nation
AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
wow you all follow my favorite peeps! including biden and obama!
Biden will courageously nominate Harris, the best of an outstanding field. Some Democratic bigfeet still oppose a woman AND black understudy. Biden sees a bigger panorama.  BTW Dodd is right about the movie and other big California media industries liking trump. No matter.
I’ll take Trumps troops over Biden’s bitches any day of the week.  If he pulls the trigger he’ll be thinning the herd... literally.
Try this:. Why did Biden call Trump a xenophobe when stopping flights from China and Europe?  Why did Pelosi stroll down Chinatown in San Fran in March claiming it was "safe"?  Why are the mobs not wearing masks and/or social distancing (and why the covid spike since the mobs)?
Biden is a sissy.
Biden hides from press, protesters and the general public.  "Hidin' Biden" is a very apt nickname.
You mean the video clip on Fox where your daddy plagiarizes Dora The Explorer ?   Biden does not di pathetic TV 📺.  That is what your daddy did ..😉
Biden will be the one to mandate the vaccine
And being a brain-dead moron who thinks Biden is great and votes Dem no matter what. I grew up liberal in NJ and quickly saw it for being the cult of hate that it is and you clearly show with support for D'OH BIDEN! #INSTABLOCKED
: "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who isarticulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." No, but they are going to vote for Biden that called them "dirty, dumb, ugly, inarticulate," while "praising" Obama!
Biden said about Obama in 2007! Do you want anything more racist than this? "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who isarticulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." In other words, " You're not dirty, dumb, ugly!"
Pennsylvania will go for the President. Republicans and Democrats are tired of the overreaching from our Governor and have clearly seen the economic difference between the Obama-Biden administration and our President’s. #TeamPA will #LeadRight
You have a valid point, I am not sure this election will end on Election Day...possibly not even on the Inauguration of hoping Joe Biden. Trump has a lot to lose and he doesn’t care how he stays in the game.
When Biden said this about Obama in 2007 : ' I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man.' He said, in order words, that Blacks were dirty, ugly, dumb...Wow! Not racist?
How is it Joe Biden’s protest? This is Trumps America- he’s the president, this is happening on his watch. Blood on his hands. Joe Biden will come in and clean it up. 🙄
Real women don’t want weak men.  That’s a very weak man.  Biden is a racist... when he can remember how he feels about things.
Don’t write in unless you want Trump to win because all you are doing is taking a vote away from Biden. You might as well just vote for Trump.
Much much different.  Clinton is in the lower 40s.  Biden is above 50% in some states.  Trump is now incumbent.  Biden much less hated than Clinton.  I wouldn’t bet my house, but Biden is in much stronger position now compared to Clinton in ‘16.
Everyone knows about the old crime bill he supported. Things change and in hindsight the bill was wrong. Biden learns from his mistakes unlike the orange clown who will continue to fail.
Problem is that Trump has lowered the expectations for Biden so much that all Biden needs to do in the 1st debate is show up and not drool to win.
There's alot who follow Trump just to harass him, so that 82 million is not necessarily his supporters. Democrats don't like Biden but you can bet they'd go out and vote for a dog with rabies in November just to get Trump out.
On January 20th he would be escorted from the White House by the military. That's what Biden has said.
You might win pa especially if Joe Biden is talking about getting rid of mfg jobs and higher taxes.
“I wrote the bill” Biden is not going end the war on drugs. Trump won’t either. But #JoJorgensen2020 and #SpikeCohen will. And they’ll pardon non violent offenders. #ShesWithUs #VoteGold #JoJo2020 #LegalizeEverything #100DaysToGo
I'm a proud Pennsylvanian and you'd better believe I'm voting for Joe Biden. And all my friends are voting for Biden—even the registered Republicans. You and your filthy criming family and toadies are done.
We will never vote ourselves out of this corruption. Biden is more of the same.
If you're Riden with Biden...if you value your life ..Don't let Biden drive !#TRUMP2020
Biden's announcing his pick August 1. trump can't even get news coverage when he's on tv. Also, forewarned is forearmed.
A conservative Democrat ( in other words, a Republican). The _only_ demographic Biden is losing.
What do you mean "no free pass?" Are you suggesting that "pogroms" should be started against Trump supporters if Joe Biden wins? What you just suggested is so dangerous and divisive and you have the nerve to criticize Donald Trump!
The Republicans who vote for Joe Biden will be voting for a Communist regime!
I’m a Democrat and there’s no way in hell I can vote for Biden.  No way.
Do not vote for Joe Biden he will defund the police just vote nobody
I have rhe electoral college score right now at 233-,133 providing biden wins all that Hillary one.  Trump has made major states swing states, so. Iden only needs one swing state and florida to win, but i want this to be a massacre.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN
Also.investigate Joe Biden and Burisma, the Steel dossier, the ones who have committed crimes while "protesting," etc.
insane how you think black americans are so slow that they would blindly vote for kanye west, besides the fact that joe biden is a complete idiot, your rhetoric is nothing short of extremely passive aggressive and ignorant
CNN Polls: Biden leads in three key states Trump won in 2016
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Fairly certain that  and  are running the Biden campaign at this point.
i just saw someone post on facebook talking about how hes voting for kanye because he has 21 Grammys and neither trump nor biden have ever talked shit about a Kardashian... i actually felt my brain cells burn off just by reading that 🥴
I never mentioned a word about Biden.  The concern and focus should remain on our president.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden is going to crash soon! Trump is going to win be "default!"
Your images here are Trumps America not Biden’s so this is Trump’s lack of leadership that is causing the current mess...Trumps mess.
I am not voting Biden or Trump.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden Get real. The Obama Administration spied on Trump. Before he became president. Duhh!!  Basement Biden. You can't even finish your sentences. No socialism. Never. Freedom all the wayyyy🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍💋💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You and Biden were horrible for 8 years🤮🤮🤮💩💩 Our country is Freedom. Trump 2020.  Basement Biden. You are Bidens puppet. Joe is dementia

Yes. So which party is that again?? I know Trump must go. The question is where after Biden’s 4 years?  Need a blue wave to reset though.
Biden will not destroy our neighborhoods.U already did yahoo cut off comments
Start crying in November again. Biden . The Dementia.  Basement Man
If Trump is a noted rapist then the same is true for Biden, because accusations mean guilt right? And where did I ever defend Trump, for the umpteenth time, you keep interjecting your boogeyman.
There clearly is a lot more to the story than you want to let on.
Uh, you support Biden who is accused of the sexual assault including penetrating and he refuses to allow anyone to access his files in the library of Delaware. Plus there are myriad images and videos and accusations against him for improper touching...of children!
please dont kneecap biden who at least marketed his campaign better than you
Biden vs trump
The Nov vote is simply a referendum on trump. Are you better off than 4 years ago? Do the actions of the current WH agree with your vision of American and family values? Let's be clear, this is binary. Trump if yes, Biden if no. Anything else is trump vote in our electoral system
Cool  tool enables you to look up Biden v Trump donors in your ZIP code. Keep double tapping on the map to bring up your area.
America's greatest mistake would be electing Joe Biden or any other politician who puts other countries first, instead of the US and supports attacks on law enforcement!
they are patriots and they also discussed their plans after biden is elected, they are going to continue to fight disinfo and help us heal
Lol Bunker Biden...The deflection is so hard with people like you.
Biden IS a whiny bitch and his horndog son who impregnates women and then denies it should be castrated as well as any man who votes for this doddering old fool..#INSTABLOCKED
Actually,  I think Joe Biden should add one more word, e.g. dog. It will drive Trump nuts that Biden had 6 words, not 5.
Joe Biden’s “You ain’t black” comment may have been ignored by the Democrat media propagandists, but it wasn’t ignored by  It’s what pushed him to   camp. #Hannity
You got it right  . Joy won the week. Great guests and driving the news cycle with the Biden interview. See you in the morning. 📺#CrossTalk
I agree 100%. Hardly any Biden signs in PA.
Wait. Biden is a murderer because he didn’t single-handedly change the employer-based healthcare system we all inherited and has existed for nearly a century? Or guarantee 60 Senate votes and 218 House votes?
Oh, so you don't care about Joe Biden's racism, but you care about Trump's? So, in conclusion, you don't care about racism at all!
I can’t seem to recall Obama or Biden taking action to prevent the public from being gouged on high prescription costs. Oh wait, that’s
Oh, so it is going to be a vice-President for the Black community only! What about all the other ethnic groups in the US? I am Hispanic! In my particular case, I don't care for a Joe Biden or a Black woman vice-President!  I care about certain issues that they do not represent!
Watch the news. Obama, Biden, Hillary, Clapper,Rice,Swortz and his lover Page, BRENNON, Comey. They will go to jail. Soon. Bunch of corruppted crooks. Stay Turned. Shocking. True Story💯💯💯😄😄😄🤗🤣🤣🤣🤪😜🙄🙄🙄🙄
...Vote Biden! Vote Blue November 3rd 2020!...
No way biden wins Allentown pa
If your proposing that she is your choice for Biden’s running mate, I read they do not have a relationship. I think it may be Kamala Harris or Val Demmings.
Weve heard the tapes chris, Biden is on tape pressuring Ukraine for political gain... that's called corruption.  Your journalism is called propaganda
Oh, ok! You're talking about the team that is "feeding" Joe Biden's brain!
Joe Biden might elect a Black woman because Democrats need the Black vote! Otherwise, he wouldn't even consider it! You just have acknowledged that Democrats are also racists, just less than Trump. You finally told the truth: White Democrats are also racists! Congratulations!
What was 40 years ago, Biden referring to Blacks as dirty, ugly, dumb and inarticulate?  He said that in 2007! Also, he said that when he worked in minority communities, he learned about roaches. Roaches are associated with dirty.Racially, Democrats are the biggest hypocrites!
Biden does not appear to be presidential material...LOL...and that's an understatemen!#TRUMP2020
Remember when everyone,  including Democrats, made fun of how inept Biden was with Obama?
Just your daily reminder that neither #Trump or “I wrote the bill” #Biden care about the failed drug war.  and  care. #ShesWithUs #VoteGold #WaronDrugs #Liberty #freedom
How can Joe Biden be a better leader when he seems to have Alzheimer? If he does, he can be no leader at all. Second, what team are you talking about?
I think Biden is going to bomb during the debates!
Well we'll. What Obama, Biden, Comey, McCabe, Hillary plus other are in bigggg trouble. With the Fake Russia.  Jail them all. That ashame what they did to President Trump. Before the Election Truth on Fox Tonight. Wow!!Biggg news tonight💯😀
Chop off the Florida Panhandle at the Apalachicola River and give the “West Florida” element to Alabama, and this poll would still be too friendly to Biden.
Biden’s more raciest than anyone else before him, but most people are too young (or stupid) to remember that.
I’m not saying this isn’t true, I’m sure Trump is losing support but so far I know 10 people that have told pollsters that they are voting for Biden just to mess with the percentages.
Sounds like Biden is plagiarizing what Trump is already doing to try and win the election. He knows he’s losing! #Trump2020 #Trump2024
s anyone know what the heck Biden is rambling about?
This weekend marks 100 days until Election Day—and we need all hands on deck! Join a virtual grassroots event in your community to take action and support Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ballot:  #TurnPABlue #JoeBiden #PADemocrats #DumpTrump2020
Some Republicans are probably coming back to the GOP.  I’ve always felt the race will tighten the closer we get to Election Day.  But 7-8 points at this stage of the race is no joke.  I’d much rather be in Biden’s shoes than Trump.
You seem nice. Tune into the debates and see for yourself. For the record, Joe Biden is an excellent debater.
Base ment Biden can't even finish his sentences.  What a laugh. Trump 2020
OH!! BASEMENT BIDEN. YOUR EATING YOUR OWN WORDS . RENEMBER. YOUR SOII RACIST. YOU SAID. YA AINT BLACK UF YA DINT VOTE FOR FOR ME. LIERRR!!!  YOUR NOT FIT TO BE PRESIDENT.🤡🤡🤡👎👎💩💩.  Trump 2020💯🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🤣🤣🤣🤗🤣🤣🤣
BASEMENT BIDEN. SHUTUP. YOUR A BIGGER RACIST!! YOU FUC????   YOU KISS THE CHINAS ASS.. YOU  GOT LOTS IF MONEY FROM THEM, CHINA!!💩💩.   You suck bigg time Sleepy Biden. You and Hunter took China's Money!!  YOUR A RACIST YEARS AGO. PLUS KNOW. YOU STUPID DEMENTIA BASTARD
*Biden enters room and introduces himself to Obama. Biden: hi, I'm Joe Biden Obama: I know who you are Joe...
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Yup and a common Pennsylvania joke is there is a church or a bar on every corner. In my small town the joke was get smashed on Saturday night and crawl to church on Sunday. This Biden joke struck me as totally normal. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Biden has major brain issues
Come out of your basement and have a interview,that is not rehearsed and not reading off a teleprompter, Basement Boy Biden #TrumpPence2020 #bidensucks
Latest poll of Florida: Joe Biden 50%, Donald Trump 44%
WTF is Biden talking about this guy is out of his fucking mind
every president has been immoral in some completely unignorable reputation-shattering fashion  but of course biden was a vp and IS an aspiring president of course HE'D be in denial, or at least denyING this for the sake of the DNC's publicity 🙄😒
If you think that Biden’s plan is to parrot what trump says, I don’t know where the f*ck you’ve been getting your info from. OAN maybe? Info wars? Other news hacks?Lobbying Intensifies Among V.P. Candidates as Biden’s Search Nears an End
Mark my words.  #Hydroxychloroquineworks and works well.  I’m not a Dr or epidemiologist but I’m happy to go on the record and n say this works n the only reason it isn’t being used widespread is 2 suppress the economy in order for #biden to have a chance. #sick #corrupt #demonic
Joe Biden will fight for equality.  #Biden2020
I never heard of Karen Bass until now. I’m sure she’d make a wonderful president when Biden looses it for good. I will not say what I think of someone who would vote for Biden let alone Bass or Harris as running mates.
Here’s what bothers me. If the roles were reversed. Biden President, R legislature, they would be doing everything in their power to make Biden look bad...including not giving a dime to anyone. That day will come again soon
Yes, with Biden as POTUS and your ass in jail or a nursing home! Probably the latter!
Yessir. Can’t win the election without blaming something ungoldly on trump. That’s their whole scheme. Not to make Biden look good, that’s impossible. It’s to make trump look bad. CCP is to blame.
Had a friend already told today on the FB that Obama stopped so low to a campaign speech for Biden. Meanwhile, they love when DJT holds rallies during addresses of the American people during a pandemic.
It still will be big numbers for Biden, sorry and good bye.  You had your chance and failed, you only like those who like you and stupid you tweeted and lied yourself to the bottom.
I plan to vote for Biden.
200% voting for Joe Biden
Millions of cases, hundreds of thousands of deaths: it’s a hoax, don’t wear a mask, it’ll be fine in a month  Biden up in the polls 3 months before Election Day: cancel the election this is serious people!!!

Is this an admission that you are going to  support and vote for BIDEN?
In Texas Biden 47% and Trump 41% even losing in that state. Hahaha on Trump!!
Really?  We have the turmoil now. It will take President Biden his first term just to restore dignity to the office.
Susan Rice? Really? So when Biden doesn't run in 2024 she can run a contested set of primaries? Tough enough for Gore. She's going to get the vote of all 5% of the electorate that really are into foreign policy. Really?
The people of this country messed up! You are the one that should be thinking about a VP, not Tweedledumb, aka Biden.
I will. Vote Biden. Vote blue. Fix the pumpkin.

Biden is just a walking carcass
Your example is from a primary, where voters may choose someone other than their local for many reasons-- starting with they wanted to keep  him as senator. Name recognition,ability to pull votes,matters more than foreign policy expertise--Biden if elected could make her secstate

Biden campaign declines?? Nah! The machine behind Biden declines!
I almost want to vote for Biden just to make the Fox News sycophants’ heads explode. I won’t, but if I did, that might be why.
But also Biden is trash. Not praising trump but we are fucked either way.
biden sucks yawn
I’m enthusiastic too.  I can’t wait to vote for Joe Biden.   #Biden2020
A lot of bernie supporters would still get out to vote for biden if warren is on the ticket. Despite everything she has done, she is still way more progressive than most politicians and vice president is a stepping stone to being president in the future
The choice is clear, BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT! Nov 3  DUMP TRUMP!
Living in PA, I can verify that Biden has no chance.  Only people that want mail in voting in PA....Dems....don’t let it happen
Wait till November 3 AND WATCH US!  Lots of Biden signs on lawns in Barks County
I’m concerned Biden doesn’t have a biker club 🙄
Trump is already a disaster. Biden can’t be any worse
Biden is ahead of where Hillary was, but let's not forget people thought Hillary also had it on lock. Biden's campaign and everyone who wants him to win should act as if he's not polling well, this is a very important election and he can't go on cruise control like Hillary did.
This man makes 7 mistakes worse than this before lunch each day, and I’m supposed to be worried about Biden when he simply misspeaks? What planet does this man and his followers live on? Seriously.

Looking for Trouble: Trump to Send Federal "Police" to Milwaukee during Democratic Convention  Trump is causing his own problems with this phony incidents!! And it`s getting worse and it is failing in his attempt to blame Biden for Trump`s creation!!
From Black lives to 'white spectacle,' Portland protests have lost focus, civil rights leaders say  via  Trump`s false and phony message about Biden and it is NOT Law &amp; Order it is Trump CORRUPTION!!
I’m shocked, shocked Ted Cruz isn’t supporting Biden after the way the impeached president went after your wife and father. Loyalty sometimes makes strange bedfellows
Sorry it was obama and Biden and right on down the line. The evidence is undeniable. Crooked Obama administration will pay for it.
Where is the media on Biden. Oh wait he doesn’t do interviews and if he does. He gets softball question all the time. Time for Biden to come out of the basement and really allow the media to have at him!!
Defound?  Did you ever attend school?  Do you understand how to spell and construct a proper sentence?  Do you know how many years Biden has been in office?  He never accomplished anything in all of those years.
I sifted through a number of polls. 96% of Republicans support the President.  Only 70% of Democrats support Biden. Black support for the President, depending on the polls is anywhere from 20% to 40%. How can Biden possibly be ahead.
First high-profile Republican defection to Biden comes from swing-state Ohio

I think Biden should try saying “Pokémon go to the polls” it didn’t work for Hillary and Pokémon Go has been unpopular for several years now but hey
Exactly, they plan on massive mail-in voter fraud. Americans who are not caught up in Twitter world know something is wrong with Biden, Dems don't care , if they successfully steal the election, The VP will take over before the inauguration
There is no way Americans will vote for Biden, everyone knows this, The plan is to steal the election, notice how mail-in voting has just gone quiet. There was a bunch of stories...nothing. Dems are going to try and make the VP the President Watch and see WHO
Yes. All Democrats aren't radicals. Millions are hard-working American's with families to support, and protect. They see the lawlessness in the streets, and they see what will happen if Biden is elected.
ME: Biden. Vote. January. Trump. Prison.
