As a veteran of special operations community I can tell you ST6 toots their own horn more than any politician, they would have outed themselves if Biden didn‚Äôt. Look at the dude that made the Coup de Gras shot, he wrote a book about it, so pick a better example.
Not to be confused with Biden‚Äôs show, GAFFEcast
Biden has nothing. His plan is only one subject - no Trump.  TDS in full swing.  Take a bitter pill on November 4 and try to recover from your disorder
For 47 years Biden has been a racist and all the sudden we want us to think that he has become a person that's not
All Biden tickets are losers
Thank you for the clarification Crime bill Joe Biden. if u wanna reverse that legacy then do things like M4All, or ending the drug war starting with legalizing marijuana that disproportionately targets African Americans and other minorities
The only case for Biden is he‚Äôs not Trump. Good luck with that
#Virginia #democrats A Virginia Night for Joe Biden Tickets, Tue, Aug 11, 2020 at 5:00 PM | Eventbrite
Does he do that on purpose? Pretend not to get it? Doesn‚Äôt see getting Biden out of the basement would be a good thing?
Oh man Biden better choose carefully. He‚Äôs gonna need as many New York City Republicans as possible to vote for him if he wants to carry NY state üôÑ
I know someone who is 105 and makes Biden look like he‚Äôs 150
You obviously haven't listened to Joe Biden. I bet you haven't seen any of his recent speeches. You'll hear a man who speaks in complete sentences. Uses grown-up words. Speaks in complexities instead of childlike syntax. Has actual facts instead of pulling numbers out of his ass.
Been watching Biden for 40 years. 'stuttering' has never come up as an excuse for his many gaffs and incoherence. Don't really believe that's the problem today. He's probably disabled, but not in that way. Actually sad to watch.
I think Biden wins by around 8-10% I can't see much higher but I'd be glad to be wrong
I‚Äôm not a fan of Trump but watching that exchange with Biden about his cognition test is concerning. No good options once again it seems #WeAreFucked
No, they will stay far away from each other. Because Biden is careful and Trump is terrible
#biden hides again.
#biden stays in hiding. More Dems I know are saying they can‚Äôt stand Biden but are voting for his VP. They are 100% sure Biden would step down within 1 year after election. The most important VP selection ever. PRESS ALL THE REPUBLICANS YOU KNOW TO GET OUT THE VOTE FOR TRUMP!
Republicants pull that move all the time, up and down the ballot, so I‚Äôm all for Biden not giving Trump any oxygen by gracing the same stage.
America is Great!!! Mr. President you need to get Biden onto the debate stage before states start doing mail in voting, Americans need to see he‚Äôs not fit to lead
Tell me more about Biden's cognitive decline.
Which could actually be good for Biden - the lower the debate bar is set, the better he looks.
What your fail to grasp is the respect Biden is showing for others in that photo.
We cannot let the same thing that happened to Clinton in 2016 happen to Biden.  This is not an ‚Äúelection between two [equally] bad candidates.‚Äù One is clearly far worse than the other.  If you don‚Äôt believe that and refuse to vote for Biden, you‚Äôre part of the problem.
If he wins what are they going to do?  Weekend at Biden's for 4 years?
Disarray? Biden said three months ago announcement would be made in early August. When last I checked, it was still early August, no story.
You were never going to vote for Biden ANYWAY. You were never going to vote for any non-conservative candidate. You are a typical privileged male: too much governmental interference except when it comes to women‚Äôs bodies. Spare us.
OK, asshole. Read this and tell me tRump has his shit together vs. Biden. This is a transcript from Faux News, unfiltered. #dementiadonnie
And that‚Äôs why Biden people won‚Äôt choose her...
I mean I don't see a world where any US president WOULDN'T ban Tik Tok. I'm sure that Biden would do it too. US administration want to spy on their own citizens, not letting China first.
I don't want to read about a Biden landslide. We shouldn't even pronounce those words, much less tweet them. I want everybody to be concerned, not complacent. We haven't won till Trump is effectively out!
Miss you Shin!  Biden 2020
Carolyn, you want to read this. It is a transcript from Faux News. Hannity and tRump. Now tell me that tRump I‚Äôd more mentally fit than Biden.
Buy some unbelievable horrific Cosmic storm allows Joe Biden become president I would like to have 15 days in the pool before they have benched him. I'm good for the money just make sure my name's got the 15 days
Sure. In 2035, Biden will be (if he‚Äôs still around) will be 93. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that 100% is a moronic goal. It seems to me it‚Äôs meant to blame the other side if it‚Äôs not achieved (or objected to), not to take responsibility for its implementation.
Hey dummy.  It appears your blind loyalty to that orangutan in the WH caused you to write a stupid opinion piece trashing Biden.  "Crossed a line"  Well, tRump crossed that line himself today.  Will look for your redaction ASAP.  kthnx
Biden called and said he doesn‚Äôt need that cash money - so you can take that right the fuck outta there.Bernie is Bernie, Biden is more like "weekend at Bernie's"
President Pelosi. President Biden.   Any one of these is a lot better than the wannabe-Hitler in the White House.   #ProtectOurVotes #LetUsVote #ONEV1
Can anyone who plans on voting for Biden explain why, but without mentioning Trump?
To everyone whitesplaining Biden's comments (to Black folks no less), can you just full-on stop?  Ok. Thanks.  African Americans Black Americans
You literally wrote "four years of Trump‚Äôs chaos, incompetence, corruption, narcissism, nepotism, racism, authoritarianism and nihilism..."  And that's not enough to vote for Biden?
"The Justice Department is not the president's private law firm. The attorney general is not the president's private lawyer. I will not interfere with the Justice Department's judgment..." - Joe Biden. Such a radically liberal position!
What I‚Äôm so curious about is Biden‚Äôs offhand remark in 2015 or so that if he were going to run again, he‚Äôd pick Warren. I think a big part of what‚Äôs causing the slow pick is Biden and his advisors being at odds over the pick and why Rice ultimately benefits from the disagreement
This is why I think it‚Äôs going to be her. Obama pushing her almost certainly matters a lot to Biden, as well. She won‚Äôt distract from biden in the way the others will and I think that‚Äôs another big motivator for him
Maybe she‚Äôd run but I think she‚Äôs the least likely to actually express it (unlike warren and Harris who both clearly will), which is what biden has said he wants. And I agree, absolutely great political reason to reject her as she‚Äôs conservative when compared to the other choices
Ummm , have a call in vote .. push 1 for  Trump / push 2 for Biden / push 3 for niether ...
if joe biden doesnt pick a women vp.........
I don‚Äôt even like Biden and think he‚Äôs massively flawed but it‚Äôs going to be incredibly satisfying when he crushes Trump in the debates and all of these takes are revealed as the utter nonsense they are
But they say Biden is the one with declining mental function‚Ä¶
Probably not, but either way Biden will bring in and appoint qualified people to run the government, not lobbyists and big donors who look out for their own interests.
Biden sucks.
Who was the first? (And I guess we should note Syracuse was not ACC when Biden graduated.)
Tom Cotton - Idiot extraordinaire.
Biden is scared, that's for sure. There's no way they let him on the stage, because it would pull back the curtain on the enormous joke that is DC politics. Prove me wrong.
Biden in Virginia, but Warren was my first choice if she had still been viable
#RobotAndrew: Just saw a Biden supporter on this dumb $1000 phone.
You can't be Never #TRE45ON and not vote for Biden.  Maybe you are a Not-With-#TRE45ON-Most-Of-The-Time type of guy.
Biden won't defund the police defending him, just the police defending you.
He's Fuhrer Midas of S**T.   Everything he touches turns to s**t.   Biden is pure gold.  Trump is üêé s**t.
Imagine my surprise while manically reading the 1977 Spinster at 1:30 AM to see that somebody dedicated a full yearbook page spread about Joe Biden visiting Hollins without any further context
Here is your Biden, take him, he is all yours.
That's the most critical flaw for Trump actually  Presidents aren't Kings. Biden will (actually) surround himself with experienced, great people. Maybe we'll listen to scientists, economists, military leaders, epidemiologists...
Yes, yes you are.  Joe Biden just won the Primary. Not Bernie, Not Elizabeth Warren... The most conservative guy running. Progressive? Yes. Radical Socialist? Google him, that's ridiculous
Either President Pelosi or President Biden is an absolute must for our country.   NO MORE FUHRER TRUMP!!!   #Resist #VoteBlue en masse in numbers #TooBigToRig either #VoteByMail or at the polls on 3 November  #RememberComeNovember
You should actually read this platform. It‚Äôs far better than you realize. And anyway, congress decides what will pass, not Biden. (So probably Bennet‚Äôs Real Deal agenda). Biden‚Äôs going to be a rubber stampWont matter soon biden and most of the rest are going to jail
as a ‚Äútransition candidate," acting as a bridge to a younger generation of leadership.  This topic clearly has been debated internally reviewed amongst the Biden group.  The timeline is interesting, December leaked to Politico..
Did biden write that post for you because your english is choppy
Biden has been racist all of his life!
What‚Äôs the strategy here, don‚Äôt support either and have no influence on the election at all. One of the two is going to win. I haven‚Äôt heard reason more compelling than what I tweeted you on not vote for Biden. Care to elaborate?
It‚Äôs simple unintended pregnancies account for 90% of all abortions which of the two candidates is going to do the most to reduce unintended pregnancy. It‚Äôs wild that never Biden was all you had to say to my last tweet to. You didn‚Äôt even give a reason...
He has my vote, I‚Äôm already confident we have 100% chance to have less abortions under Biden than Trump. Biden will implement the preventative things to eliminate the causes of abortion. GOP‚Äôs answer is outlaw, which won‚Äôt work.
Make no mistake about it, if Dems don't nominate an actual progressive in 2024 I won't be voting.  I have a strong dislike for #45 so it's very easy to vote for Biden, even though I dislike Biden as well
Biden can't apologize in person because he isn't capable! He had to have someone tweet his attempt at an apology on his behalf!
Your handle is a lie in itself. There is no such thing as a Republican for Biden. Secondly, we had the all-time best economy IN HISTORY before we were attacked by the liberal Scamdemic.  The economy - and employment -  continue to grow by leaps and bounds, thanks to Trump
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
I mean, are we talking Joe Biden or Chuck Norris here?
We have seen nothing wrong with Biden's mental ability! trump on the other hand.......
Leslie Knope would vote for Biden and I think that‚Äôs enough reason for you to.
Biden VS God 2020
That‚Äôs hilarious! Thanks for the share. I‚Äôd rather him say this then have his racist views come out like Biden. By the way, I‚Äôve been looking on CNN for info on what Biden said but can‚Äôt find it anywhere... hmm.. covering that up just like covering up the terrible job Cuomo did!
Can‚Äôt wait for Biden to pull out his Marty Huggins playbook and ask him to recite the Lord‚Äôs Prayer.
Trump Says Biden Is ‚ÄòAgainst the Bible‚Äô. Dumb fucker
I wish I could actually vote for the candidate that Donald Trump claims Joe Biden is
Rashida Tlaib has refused to endorse our  nominee Joe Biden.  Donate to her opponent Brenda Jones here --  Please Retweet!
Not like we have someone now with cognitive ability üò¨ Biden is better than what‚Äôs there now. So no, Im not uncomfortable
Wow I mean how powerful must Joe Biden be if he can hurt God? Personally I think God can take care of his own self just fine.
Trump is trying to dupe, you again, he uses same old tactics on Biden that he did on Hillary, has anybody taken your guns yet( been waiting almost four years) someone that knows nothing about religion has the nerve to talk about someone else, wonder what god he worships
Kind of makes Biden sound bad-ass, though. I mean, if he can hurt God...

Biden is going to pick Demings.  üòâ-Watch.
What do you like about Biden‚Äôs platform this year that you excited for him to be your candidate?
if Biden is hiding now what will he be doing when the enemies of America are wide awake and spreading their evil agenda around the world with no one to step up to the plate the only thing between Russia and North Korea and Iran and China is president Trump do you sleepy joe no
DEMS SUPPORT VIOLENCE FROM ANTIFA, HAS JOE BIDEN LOST IT?  via
Everyone should be angry at Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Both of these people are unfit for the Presidency. Fuck both of them.
That's what we plan to do when we elect Joe Biden on Nov.3 and kick your ass out of the WH.
President Trump took in $165 million for his reelection effort in the month of July.
Nah... Biden doesn‚Äôt know enough to be terrified. The ship has sailed
We are talking bout Biden...nice try tho

Understand I want Biden to win...  But the man cant put sentences together.  He used to be able too so its not about his childhood stutter.  He no longer possesses the skill to speak clearly.  It makes him seem like he's in cognitive decline.  Not good
The presidential nominee says it's out of caution due to the pandemic
Telling that they have to keep using shorter and shorter clips to make Biden look bad ‚Äî this one is down to 7 seconds. While you could take any three-minute chunk out of the Axios interview at random, and Trump still looks like a raving, ignorant lunatic.
I‚Äôm so tired of hearing this. Biden has been running for President for like 45 years and no one mentioned this one time before 2019
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs like saying ‚Ä¶ before you got on this program, you‚Äôre taking a test whether you‚Äôre taking cocaine or not. What do you think? Huh? Are you a junkie?‚Äù
EXACTLY!!  sources saying Biden is worse than we know! He is noticibly worse day-to-day and cannot make it till Nov, so logic tells me someone has to replace him. Prob why he hasn‚Äôt picked a VP yet too? DNC is in full panic mode!!
I'm definitely voting for Trump over Biden. I can't stand Trump BUT I can't vote for someone that can't even form sentences, stops themselves from saying "something I shouldn't say," etc., etc. I strongly encourage Biden supporters to watch this:
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
You know Biden is gonna pick a VP based on white suburban "I was a Trump voter til last week" mom appeal, right?
He's going to need them. Locally, I have yet to see a Biden sticker, yard placard, flag... and yet I see Trump stuff all over the place.
That's twice the amount that the Trump campaign has reserved
Keep fighting for the most progressive platform, but that 12 percent should definitely not be stupid and vote for Biden.
Honestly all I want to hear is we will vote for Biden in Nov.  Not cause he's a great candidate, but because the alternative is far worse.  Does that work for the crazy Berners &amp; crazy KHivers?  Can you all shut the fuck up now?
Go ahead and vote against everything that‚Äôs being protested Biden is the only racist running for president. Do you really want to be woke?#bidenisaracist#TRUMP2020
Biden is going to look really stupid if he does! üíØ
Because Biden has gotten so bad he can not be the nominee. A replacement for him is coming, no use in picking a VP now.  confirmed today from a source he trusts 1000% that Joe is in a steep decline now, worse every day! Noticeable from one day to the next decline! ü§îü§î
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.
You‚Äôre not wrong, but Biden won‚Äôt be any better..
And you really think Joe Biden has the mental capacity to run a government much less a shopping cart? üòÇ
Biden WILL NOT BE THE DEMOCRAT NOMINEE!!!  He‚Äôs getting more senile by the day, literally!! (Says  That being the case, they will have to replace him on the ticket I believe. So who then?? M. Obama jumps in? Or Bernie? ü§îüò≤ü§Æ
Because Biden has gotten so bad he can not be the nominee. A replacement for him is coming, so no use in picking a VP now
I have a new favorite trolling activity at work.  It‚Äôs pretty common for us to use the NATO phonetic alphabet to give information.  I‚Äôve started sprinkling in names of well known democrats when giving information to my conservative coworkers.  ‚ÄúThe VIN is Biden 5 Northam 4590‚Äù
Biden worse than we knew even!!  sources say he‚Äôs declining sharply on a daily basis now! If true he‚Äôll literally have to be replaced on the ticket. Who ya got? My prediction: Sanders / Harris or M. Obama / Sanders
My current prediction (and I reserve the right to alter it several times a day ü§£)    Biden, per very reliable sources, is worse even than we thought! Steadily getting worse on a daily basis, so with that scenario he literally has to be replaced on the ticket. Sanders / Harris ü§Æ
The vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that's more attuned to gender and racial biases.
Biden is also a known plagiarist, and has misrepresented his educational credentials.
I hope you are Biden's choice for VP!!
Because you are thinking Biden will look like an orator  in a debate. He won't.
Would Biden have bragged about getting the man fired in public if he had done it with corrupt intent? Biden was working the interests of the U.S. and doing the will of the Obama administration. Those are simple, undeniable facts.
There is a reason you aren't seeing more of Biden. Its because you might not like what you see.
That isn't what happened. Biden got a CORRUPT prosecutor fired ‚Äî one who WASN'T investigating the company Hunter worked for, or anyone else. Biden was serving the interests of the U.S. ‚Äî something Trump can't even begin to claim.
Biden the pervert
Podesta, the Dems, and RINOs staging war games to plan their moves if Biden doesn‚Äôt win and/or Trump won‚Äôt concede immediately...these people are dangerous and nuts!! üòß‚òπÔ∏èü§î
Some say it's just more evidence of why Biden needs a woman on his ticket.
The only way biden will win is if you cheat!
The only way biden will win is if you cheat!
Its gonna be funny watching Trump pivot and actually force Biden to the left.
It‚Äôs never going to happen. Biden‚Äôs team will back out.
I don't care what Barr or what any other of the crooked Trump cronies say. They are a bunch of liars and I don't believe anything they have to say about Biden or anyone else for that matter.
Honest question you truly believe that if Biden chooses whoever that it will make people choose to vote for  over  hasn‚Äôt made up their minds at this point...150k people are dead...
Vlad the Rescuer: There likely will be a COVID vaccine in the United States announced in October, safe or not. Also, Hunter Biden likely will be indicted in October with an inference Joe Biden is being "investigated," true or not. #2020Election

Remember when your professor said go with your first answer? Yeah. Biden isn‚Äôt doing that. This is going to be a stinker. I can feel it. Still getting my vote
This is the President of Mexico, not Biden...
Getting primed to blame Joe Biden for the money-grubbing recklessness of Trump and his enablers. Same story every time:  Step one, get rich wrecking the economy.  Step two, blame the Democrats.
A lot of people are saying that they haven‚Äôt heard anything from Joe Biden. Well, here‚Äôs something he had to say on the anniversary of the El Paso massacre.  It‚Äôs about 3 and a half minutes long. Give it a listen and you‚Äôll see that he is much more than just ‚Äúnot-Trump.‚Äù
With 92 days until Election Day, here's what we're watching heading into a new week in the 2020 campaign:
Russia owns you. The economy has cratered. Millions are out of work. Nearly 160,000 Americans are dead because of your incompetence. Biden would bring dignity, compassion, competence and respect back to the White House.
And he is a pastor!! It‚Äôs so ridiculous the Christians or the so called Christians are today. Locking up children on the boarder, conspiracy theories, believing in a president who has lawsuits for sexual crimes. But will call out Bill Clinton and joe Biden. Hypocrites. Hmm
Right... because Biden is a genius.   Let's just hope these actually happen because when Joe loses track of where he is and what year it is, maybe it will finally expose what's happening.  It's almost a full Weekend at Bernie's situation right now.
There better be debates, because I want to see Biden up close and personal. I don't think it will be as flattering as people think.
Biden isn't going to debate Trump because he doesn't have the mental capacity to do so.  It would fully expose his dementia.
There is a deeper plot here that goes beyond Biden, he he is simply a tool being used for a grander purpose.
No. A neighbor has a Trump flag in his yard and people throw trash in it. I don‚Äôt want to see what people do if I put up a Biden flag.
That is 100% false. There hasn‚Äôt even been a case yet. Trump has been cleared of nothing. Wow I‚Äôm done with you. You‚Äôre obviously a deranged Trump addict, just slightly worse than a Biden Bro ‚úåüèº
PSA: Instead of harassing me over not being thrilled with Biden, invite your moderate Republican friends to brunch. Trust me, they'll love his policies.
Let‚Äôs see Joe Biden‚Äôs tax returns!
Why Allie the debate? Biden is doing nothing an rising in the polls lol Trump is beating himself up every day.
Biden appointing her as a Justice would be history gold!
You can‚Äôt debate a man like Trump because he never tells the truth and only insults, belittles and disrespects anyone that is not Trump. It‚Äôs better to stay away from any debates. So, yes, I would still vote for Biden!
If Biden wins we will get More failure plus dementia and a pedophilia
I feel like Biden-Trump debates are not going to be a good thing for Biden. I hope I'm wrong.
Make America Great Again  means a vote for Joe Biden in November
A vote for Biden will actually BE WORSE than the current state we are in. Crazy but true unfortunately.
Just thought about it. Susan Rice for VP?! Absolutely ‚ù§Ô∏è   She has every positive trait Kamala has, without the sneakiness &amp; double standards. Rice is Obama 2020 and if she were to inherit the presidency from Bidenüò±?   Y'all... I think I'm feeling..hopeü•∫
Biden bows out, Hillary steps in his place!!
I don't know why anyone is really thinking Biden will pick a progressive VP as they float various names
We could know Joe Biden's running mate very soon.
The left is not killing 9 month babies. Biden has been VERY specific about not defunding the police.
While I agree that Dems ignore Obama/Biden‚Äôs role in the ‚Äúcages‚Äù being built the only thing Trump idiots got is ‚Äúwell so and so did it too!‚Äù like a bunch of middle schoolers. This whole political system is fucked
Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate

The president and Joe Biden both promise sweeping progress -- but through very different paths
People applaud Joe Biden when he talks about raising our taxes. Crazy huh?
Now I want this to happen just so I can get the headline that says "Joe Biden beaten to death by Kamala Harris."Election. I promise, if Biden wins, it will all stop.

Yeah, it is pretty terrifying. Thank God Biden is-  Uh oh.

VP Biden, I have no issues with your statement about the Latino community versus the black community, and intelligent analysis. The Nothern born African-Americans have different politics and racial views than a southern-born African-American who was raised under segregationüëçüèæ‚úåüèæ.
Welcome to the state of US politics, where we're stuck with Joe Biden over Bernie, and the important things like health care and policing will not fundamentally change. Getting trump out is absolutely important, but so is universal healthcare and stopping police from murdering

You don't gef tired of having to explain what Biden really meant? You have to do this like every 3 days. At something you're going to have to accept Joe Biden is the racist I've been telling you he is
We do not, but we also know that Biden isn't going to change anything, and honestly could open the door for Republican resurgence. Some of us are looking past the next four years. But we also know that the US can't survive another four years of trump. So, handwringing.
Ana Navarro is a big get for Team Biden  There, I fixed it for you. A respected journalist like yourself shouldn't leave such an incorrect message up. Please delete and correct.
We should keep acting like Biden is gonna lose until the results are certified. Can‚Äôt get complacent.
But I didn‚Äôt find Biden‚Äôs comments racist.... so ... I think this is a distraction
I don‚Äôt know why but I feel that Biden was put in place to insure trumps victory.. otherwise why have him there at all. There were a few far better Candidates to choose from that could go toe to toe with trump.

The thing about Biden that people don't understand is he is of the old school of prejudice against blacks.  It is so deeply ingrained in him that it's not gaffe's he keeps making - he truly doesn't get what's wrong with what he says.

What is racism explained. After #Biden asked the black guy today if he was tested for cocaine or if he is a junkie.
Imagine if Trump had asked a black, male interviewer, "Are you on cocaine? Are you a junkie?" as Biden did?  OMG what a difference it would have made in the news.
So basically Biden thinks the black community IS a monolith, no wonder he gets offended whenever a black person questions him, he thinks we're all supposed to be like Simone Sanders

No one cares.  Get back to contrasting Trump vs Biden on taxes and law and order.   Otherwise Biden wins.
But Joe Biden is against God! Man this guy is truly insane!!
And you cannot think of anything intelligent to say so you resort to insults. Trump has been running the country just fine, just because we like him or vote for him does not mean we are stupid. It's not Biden we gotta worry about he don't want to be Pres. he'll hand it to VP

Biden has SUPERNATURAL POWERS and will hurt the almighty
And the leader of the GOP just called Biden the enemy of God.  It looks like there's no lower depth the GOP could stoop to in the presidential campaign, but there are *glances at calendar* about 90 lower depths waiting for us
Now that your leader has declared Joe Biden the enemy of God himself, are you taking up the sword of the crusader? And if not, why do you choose to facilitate the Antichrist as your leader has declared
Of course they don't and Biden shouldn't suggest otherwise. But most black neighborhoods vote 90+% D.  That may be the case in a few Latino neighborhoods but it isn't as widespread and it varies a lot by national origin.
I have an idea...in the Biden/Trump debate every time Trump says ‚Äúfake News‚Äù the audience yells ‚Äúthe truth‚Äù and takes a drink!
One reason Biden may be having trouble finding a running mate that can help him win: Out of black women in Congress, only 2 (Lucy McBath &amp; Lauren Underwood) come from competitive districts, and both were first elected just in 2018.
Exactly... which is why you calling Biden one is laughable. You aren't supposed to respond until you have that LeBron accountability quote. Still waiting.

You mean like Obama did. Pretty sure Biden stated he wants to take what Barry did and go even farther....
Some of us don‚Äôt need to a debate. We aren‚Äôt swayed by the empty words and divisive rhetoric that dominates these spectacles. We know what you both offer. You offer nothing. Biden offers normalcy. Easy choice.

For democracy's sake there needs to be debates, but Biden can run victory formation 3 times, take a knee and run out the clock. Donny T will self implode with or without debates...
Those of us who know why Biden responded that way will probably vote for Biden. However a President needs to speak clearly and avoid snark and sarcasm. He asked a black reporter if they took a drug test. If that was Trump asking what would you think?  is better than that
Biden ahead by any amount will benefit down ballot democrats.
Suggestions that he skip the debates are coming from pundits outside the campaign.  Biden has never wavered in his commitment to three televised debates.

Pour a glass of the good stuff, sit back in your most comfortable chair, and enjoy the ride.
And my point is, the Democrats/those on the Left still want to hold Trump accountable for his past/current words/deeds, but want to give Biden a pass for his past/current words/deeds. That's blatant hypocrisy! Trump has been working with the black community, what has Biden done?
Running mates will be super important in 2020.
Joe Biden does not want to debate Trump at all, but surely not until many or most people have voted by mail so they can't change their vote when they realize he is experiencing serious cognitive decline.

One thing you have right NO he did nothing and where were you for those 8 years there was plunity going on the he decided to not act on how about Maryland how about Benghazi Obama and Biden did nothing for the American public but raise taxs and healthcare that sucked

I've said it before and I'll say it again. There's very few who are willing to admit that there's still going to be people suffering in Joe Biden's administration. It's now only a matter of how many will suffer is what drives their decision. Why does it always lead to suffering?

I'm going to hold Joe Biden's feet to the fire and demand better from him, because I don't care if he thinks healthcare is only a privilege, it's a human right. I'm not going to simply bow my head and accept bread crumbs. We demand better policies from him. What about you?
Given the fact he has said he has no empathy for the younger generation and that nothing will fundamentally change, of fucking course I'm going to demand better from Joe Biden. I need to know what he's going to do if he become president. Is that too much to ask?
By the way, just so we're clear, because a lot of you believe I find the alternative better, I don't want Trump to win. Period. End of story. I just want Biden to do better and not leave us behind and neglect us. We deserve healthcare even if we have no job. We're in a pandemic.
I'm worried about Joe Biden vetoing Medicare For All like he said he would, and any compromise on a healthcare system will still leave millions like me without health insurance even in a pandemic. I'm demanding better for Joe Biden, and here I am being reprimanded for it.
I agree. Compared to Trump, it's a slight shift to the left. I just find it frustrating that we're going to have to beg for Joe Biden to move slightly more to the left on healthcare since he doesn't believe in a single payer system when every other nation has it.
Went through it with my father in law. Biden does not have dementia. He had slowed down but I‚Äôm confident he will hire good people which is more than I can say for Trump: family members and donors
Because you have some one (biden) that will not be able to answer the questions.

You didn't even vote for him. When you grow up you can vote like an adult. Yeah, make your 1st vote for Biden. Kill some more babies!

I mean, what's the point.  Its not like your dad has nothing important to say.  He never does.  Besides, after his creeping around in the background behind Clinton, we just assume your dad is gonna keep trying to cough on Biden and we love Joe too much to subject him to that.
I didn‚Äôt think simply asking for Biden‚Äôs plan would generate such anger and frustration. Forgive me for asking and not simply being quiet and do as I‚Äôm told. I‚Äôm just asking for guidance in this dark time.
I think asking for Biden‚Äôs plans after he wins is not so much to ask for, but apparently it‚Äôs taboo for some. I‚Äôm just worried Biden won‚Äôt do anything in terms of healthcare even in a pandemic. He still thinks healthcare should be tied to employment.
I have been living, thankfully. Despite my depression for all these last 4 years I‚Äôm still living. Bernie gave me hope, but Biden won and doesn‚Äôt believe in the things Bernie fought for like a single payer system. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll still struggle to have healthcare under Biden.
I didn‚Äôt think asking for Biden‚Äôs plan after we defeat Trump was too much to ask for, but I guess it is for some. I‚Äôm just worried about it having healthcare for 4 more years under Biden. I didn‚Äôt think asking what he would do would generate anger by some.
So hope and pray he nudges a inch to the left on healthcare and has a conscience and doesn‚Äôt veto single payer legislation. Seems like a valid plan. I just hate seeing people suffer while we try to force Biden to do what‚Äôs right in a pandemic.
I didn‚Äôt say I wanted Trump. All I‚Äôm asking is Biden‚Äôs plan for helping us who are struggling and at best all I‚Äôve gotten was ‚Äúadd to the ACA‚Äù. So not changing much. So it‚Äôs back to still be worried about getting sick. I didn‚Äôt think asking for his plan would be so divisive.
Asking what would happen next after Trump is defeated and Biden is elected was rather eye opening. I was mostly scorn by centrists for being worried I would still be without healthcare for 4 more years. It‚Äôs almost like asking what plan Biden has is taboo for his supporters.
OH HEEEELL NO!! üëéüèæ
Trump likes women, no doubt. There is absolutely nothing to make anyone think he is a pedeophile. Biden's videos of touching and sniffing little girls are everywhere. That is not normal with perfect strangers.
"We're lower than the world" - well it's impossible for them to be higher! Jesus christ. And his supporters have the gall to call Biden senile.
all Biden has to do is say his name and speak in complete sentences to win the debate and it will be the Trump's campaign's fault that they set the expectations so low for him.
I don't know what will happen if Biden wins other than "not being in a dictatorship" from what moderates have told me in the past few hours. I fear nothing will change with Biden, and things will worsen with Trump. I hate this nightmare and I want it to end.
So, yes, I'm fully aware of what's happening. I lose sleep over the possibility of getting sick and not having health insurance. I'm worried Biden's healthcare plan will still leave millions like me without healthcare even in the middle of a deadly pandemic.
Agreed to all of those. I'm worried Biden won't do much to help us in this pandemic. I'm w/o a job and have no insurance. It's hard to find a job that doesn't put my loved ones at risk with underlining health problems. He still believes healthcare should be tied to employment.
I'm muting this thread. I appreciate those who gave their reasons, reached out and explained it to me. I do hope things will be better soon. I just want people to have healthcare because I believe healthcare is a human right, even if Biden doesn't believe it.
That's what drew me to Bernie. He knew those lobbyists have shaped the political system into what it is, but sadly we're still stuck in it with either Trump or Biden. It's only a matter of damage reduction, which is another argument I hear being made for the case for Biden.
I'm well aware of that and others have said the same. Part of what drew me to Bernie was he knew drastic changes were needed in this chaotic and ever changing time. I worry Biden won't do anything to meet those challenges head on, but sadly that's the only choice I'm left with.
True. Which is why I'm worried Biden won't do much to help us weather this storm that is COVID since he's merely "adding" to the current system we have, which will not help those struggling to find a job and have insurance. But you're right, it's better than the alternative.
I understand that. I only wish his healthcare proposal was more adequate to meet the needs of those suffering in this pandemic, because who knows how long this will last even after Biden wins. Better that than the "alternative". Thanks for your input.
Thank you for those who answered me in earnest. I have some sense of what's to come after Biden is elected. It's just a shame people will continue to die by the time Biden is pushed just a little further to the left on issues like healthcare.
Well, I do appreciate your bluntness &amp; honesty. Not a lot are willing to admit people will still suffer under a Biden administration, but that is still worth removing Trump just so we can make incremental steps during a deadly and ever changing pandemic. Thank you
It would be. I'd also rest easy knowing I'd have a president who believes we deserve to have healthcare that isn't tied to our employment even in the middle of a deadly pandemic. That's something I hope for in Biden, but sadly he's hostile to that idea.
I want to put the fire out, and I also want to know how we're going to rebuild once we put it out. I believe it's a reasonable thing to ask for since Biden has once said "Nothing will fundamentally change". I want to avoid those beginnings so we won't meet those ends.
My worry is even if Biden wins and he's able to make these small incremental changes, I'm afraid people will still suffer because they're unable to have health coverage b/c they can't afford it. Trust me, I want to defeat Trump. I want to know where we go from there afterwards.
I'm not interested in what-ifs because Biden is the nominee.
Okay, so we remove Trump. And then what? What is Joe Biden going to do after he becomes president? What is he going to do to help us not have to lose sleep over getting sick and become financially ruined because we don't have health insurance?
I'm without a job and I can't work outside from home because I'm living with loved ones who have underlining health conditions. It's extremely difficult to find remote work and have employer based health insurance. What is Biden going to do to address that?
I'm not. I'm simply asking what else are Joe Biden's plans besides removing Trump? What are his plans to help families struggling to pay for healthcare because they can't work or find work because we're in a deadly pandemic?
So, a list of things Biden won't do, but there's not much of anything Biden WILL do if he becomes president? Nothing on helping our families and the most vulnerable? No  changes to help us in this pandemic?
I don't know... I think this tweet is more anti-Trump than it has anything to do with Biden.
Gotta love Biden Bros telling undecided voters they're stupid and they don't care. Hey  will you denounce your toxic supporters?
For someone telling me to "adult now", you're very childish for not doing something as simple as telling one plan Joe Biden has.
Is it too much to ask a single plan in Joe Biden's first 100 days as president? It should be simple enough.
What is Joe Biden going to do after he becomes president. Just name me one fucking thing.
Oh. And you‚Äôre not black if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden.
I just wish a single Biden supporter would tell me what his plans are after he becomes president. So far, it's only "defeating Trump" and that's it. No plans. No fundamental changes. Nothing for 4 more years.
I've yet to hear from a single Joe Biden supporter about his plans after defeating Trump. What comes after Biden is inaugurated? What are Biden's goals in his first 100 days? The only thing I know from his own mouth is no fundamental changes.
Let‚Äôs Scrap the Presidential Debates
All these plans you claim Joe Biden has, yet you can't name a single one. If you struggle to give me an elevator pitch on Joe Biden other than defeating Trump, then just admit that he has no plan.
Biden would not be able to debate The President.
dont snifff panties wait wait wait i thought i was Joe Biden for a second there
COVID= economy-destroying attempt to influence the election. Your kids can't go to school so you have maximum difficulty working IF your company is allowed to be open.  No Trump rallies to show support is huge, Biden won't have to travel or debate and  a mail-in rigged election.
It is really a matter of lesser evils. I know what Trump is like and don't want another 4 years. I am willing to give Biden his chance. Would I prefer a better option? Yes I would.
What?! I didn‚Äôt say that. Biden has the most experience of anyone! Trump is an unqualified, unfit baffling. I said that his VP needs to be experienced enough to take over if required.
What happens after we defeat Trump? What's Biden going to do? Is he going to do what's right and champion your causes? Or is he going to hoodwink us like Obama did before him and nothing happens for 4 more years?
Okay. We defeat Trump. Then what? What is Biden going to do afterwards?
Joe Biden is bad choice for the Democratic Party. Just my opinion.
I'm still donations I been with Joe Biden From Day one,People Stop being Selfish.
Hey didn't mean you I was referring to the person I originally started posting to cause of his stupid post about Biden. So sorry you misunderstood me.
Biden is suffering from dementia and the Demonrats know it. He seems to be declining rapidly. He is incapable of completing a sntence while reading a teleprompter let alone debate
He started at 70. Biden will start at 78. That‚Äôs a pretty big difference.
Biden ain‚Äôt going to make it to November as a candidate.
Except that gray will lead to millions of people still uninsured and without access to healthcare. That gray will lead to endless suffering unless Biden does the right thing and supports a single payer system.
That‚Äôs because Biden is being used by the radical left to gain power but President Trump is gonna win in a Landslide !!!!
Poor Joe Biden, can‚Äôt think, can‚Äôt make sense when he speaks, definitely can‚Äôt handle press conference questions, why would you ever want him to attend a debate let alone participate in one? Joe is toast and you know it! Lol
Satire from the New Yorker. Voters who prefer being alive favor Joe Biden.
Well don't forget, "If you have a problem figuring out whether you‚Äôre for me or Trump, then you ain‚Äôt black". Cause Mr. Biden said so.
Joe Lockhart Lies To Cover For Biden Not Debating Trump. Trump 2020 campaign manager Bill Stepien: 'We want more debates' against Biden and 'sooner'

You MF low life ! You only scare women when we are being raped !! You don‚Äôt scare women but we scare YOU!! We will vote you out !!  Biden 2020
Keep exposing Biden's lies and plans to make our nation a Communist nation. No real American wants that. Keep America Free, Vote Trump2020üá∫üá∏
We had Beto Orourke, Andrew Yang, and Bernie Sanders and we have to choose between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. I hope America gets worse.
Kinda like you're not black if you dont vote for Biden? What childish nonsense.
AG Bill "Business as Usual" Barr said there is no room for politics in his DOJ...then immediately announced there would be no investigation of either Obama nor Biden.
‚ÄòNot a joke‚Äô: Insiders tell Bongino Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline rapidly worsening, getting harder to mask
The problem with Biden's skipping the debates is that it tends to reinforce the common conception of him as frail. Still, showing up would be very risky.
Why would Biden supporters come out to see you and the half dozen fawning people on the roadside?
So Biden was accused 1 time and story was changed and she refused to go record about it. At worst Biden has a problem with people's personal space. Trump has been accused 16 TIMES of sexual misconduct. Hmmmm!!!!!!
Facts First: Biden officially committed to participating in the three scheduled presidential debates -- and Biden has repeatedly said he is eager to debate Trump even if the pandemic forces them to hold the event online rather than in person.
Biden will be viewed as a coward if he does not debate President Trump!!! President Trump should show up to debate and show an empty Biden podium!!!üôèüòÇüòÇüòÅ
So a young man, working for his father in the 1970's, gets sued for policies his father sets &amp; you want to call him a racist? That is what you want to stand on? Yet everyone wants to give Biden a pass for his past and present racism.
I'm just fearful of what won't happen under a Biden administration. I feel like people will suffer regardless of who wins. Damage reduction is the only valid argument centrists and moderates are making. Covid has been one hell of a wildcard.
But, again, I don't underestimate the desperation of the American people. So much lives have been taken away needlessly and families are struggling. I don't begrudge them to do what it takes to vote for Biden no questions asked. This is no ordinary election year.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt risk my children‚Äôs future with Joe Biden‚Äù  Cards
Just today, I learned that a loved one of mine passed away because of Covid. They didn't wear a mask and that was because they listened to him. I've been on the fence, but now it's really hit far too close to home. And I've gotten flack for even thinking of choosing Biden.
If true, I don‚Äôt see how this can succeed.  ‚ÄúDemocrats Urging Biden Not to Debate Trump‚Äù
Joe Biden presidency would be a disaster for our schools. He sent his own children to an elite school, and parades as the #BLM candidate, yet his policies are openly hostile to the educational choices that offer the best chance for minority advancement.
I would like to know but it's likely smarter for Biden campaign to wait as long as possible to keep Trump campaign from social media attacks on the VP choice.
What If Trump Refuses to Accept a Biden Victory? A Look at How Electoral...  via
This has convinced me to vote for Biden

I go to sleep counting the electoral votes if the Gods gave us Biden/Obama :)
Trump will win again in November. Joe Biden has Dementia lol
Biden who?
so why is it you and faux don‚Äôt show the Rasmussen polls where 45 is killing Biden. Why? Because you all are frauds with an agenda. Have a great day
No matter who Biden's VP pick is going to be, it won't favor progressives. They'll never reach out to us and we'll be left out yet again. Don't be shocked when it happens.
I want a do over please vote biden 2020
Wow! This is a dangerous man! Our Americans must get back our respect‚Äô we as Americans deserves a leadership!! Vote biden  2020
Exactly. He thinks if we hide the virus it'll go away and not spread to an infantessimal degree. Its baffling. With biden being biden he could have slept his way through November if he just shut the fuck up
I dont speak on politics often but however you feel about trump, he could have easily won in November with the independent vote if he simply shut the fuck up and didnt act like a belligerent baby on a regular basis. Itll cost him in November. Biden is still another dumpster fire.
Sir, the people I‚Äôm talking to here in Chicago are not concerned about the virus.  The people are not even being clean here.   They are talking about Biden being a joke and asking who the REAL CANDIDATE is.  Chicago Loves Trump. I see no Biden signs.
Biden needs to debate Trump period. If he doesn't then he is not serving the people!
Joe Biden is a WEIRDO.
Don‚Äôt be a Dementiaphobe! Vote Biden.
125 years, that the combined time Chucky Nancy and comotose Joe Biden have been in politics and DC. What the hell have they done for anyone???? But get rich!!!
So excited to see you on the ticket! Great news congrats Biden-harris 2020
6. What Biden means for tech  #axiosam
Remember folks #tiktokban keep this trending, Trump is ACTUALLY more afraid of kids rallying against him than Joe Biden, don‚Äôt let him censor you.üëçüèæ It‚Äôs your first Amendment right!
Good morning to everyone. Comotose Joe Biden will destroy this great country. That is all....
If Biden is elected in 93 days, we will continue what he has accomplished in his 8 years as VP and 30+ years as a politician.... NOTHING!
I know some people will disagree, and I understand, but Jo Jorgensen is not part of the national conversation with regard to the election. A vote against Biden is a vote for Trump.
Yes. I have seen both debate biden vs palin trump vs clinton. So it isnt necessary
It‚Äôs real simple.... if you want to keep more of your money... you vote for Trump... if you want to give more of your money away to all these government assistant programs.... then you vote for Biden...ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
This slow-motion Biden vp reveal is so characteristically dorky and anti-climactic üôÑ I almost feel bad for whoever it ends up being
WHY after dems shoved Biden down our throats would they choose a Californian congresswoman (any of them) for VP?? Just solidifies the coastal liberal elite trope. The mid-west and Mid-Atlantic are up for grabs and the left is ignoring them AGAIN
I don't really care about polls. Most of them are a bunch of lies. you tell me 46% of this country is going to vote for Joe Biden. I got some oceanfront property up here in Nebraska for you. It's prime real estate.
I honestly would vote for anyone else. Not a big fan of Biden. But I am fighting a repeat of 2016. That's just honesty. I won't vote for trump. Period. We have bad politicians, and good politicians. Then we have trump. And he's not my guy.
I don't have to like Biden. And my party isn't going say that I'm not a real Democrat (which I'm not, actually) because I preferred someone else. Do you know why? Because this loyalty to ONE man is what they do in dictatorships and monarchies. NOT democracies.
This country has some serious issues. I'm not sure if anyone can deter the present course of insanity, including Biden.
I am confident she is the best VP Biden could choose.
Then what do you really think if Joe Biden wins he will be able to find his way to the White House
Just got done blocking TWO pedo‚Äôs who‚Äôll call out Joe Biden for his ‚Äúdisturbing‚Äù interaction with women but won‚Äôt hold Trump accountable for his fair share of trifling behavior surrounding his own daughter. WHY does Trump get a pass?
Whoop! Whoop! Biden 2020  thank you all!!
This is why we must vote for Biden 2020 because of this cramp you put out!! Disgusting ! November 3 will stay‚úùÔ∏èüôèüèæ
I know I've shared this countless times, but I'm going to keep sharing it because I haven't gotten over this and I still won't get over this. I can never get over Joe Biden turning his backs on immigrants who are fearful that they'll be deported under his administration.
Obama picked Biden on August 23rd 2008 without a pandemic making it harder to vet people. Was he indecisive? Seemed to have worked well for him.
To be honest, I don't know. My home state of Virginia has always had relatively close margins. Biden had no ground game here during the primary. I'm disgusted with the "choice" I'm left with. I'm at a loss and I feel like I'm stuck in a corner with nowhere to go.
Let's be real, would any of you be surprised if George W Bush spoke at the DNC this year for Joe Biden?
Biden don't have the charisma to have outshine President Obama.
Karen Bass is very impressive but that Scientology speech is a bridge to far.Susan Rice would be a better VP of the 3 but she has a lot of baggage.Kamala Harris is the safer pick in my opinion so I think Biden should choose her as his VP.
We are on a cross country trip right now.  I have not seen a single Biden sign.  I have seen many Trump signs.  Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and South Dakota so far.
I think Biden in on this list bc I've written on his posts saying he needs to do better to give a shit about us and not abandon us, even if it's a fruitless effort. But this is a pretty accurate list of folks I interact with here on Twitter. Give them a follow! Except for Biden.
To do that, vote for Biden
told people they won't black enough if they didn't vote for biden, and this goofy wanna be woke mf is still on his radio, but they canceled  what kinda fuck shit is that, i grew up on nick cannon, ill be the first to say, you can slide bro..
One Biden sign in my largely liberal neighborhood. Two Trump signs (soon to be 3 when mine comes in), several American flags, and 3 Thin Blue Line American flags.
But you are asking women to do that by pushing for Joe Biden for president or did you forget about Anita Hill?
Joe Biden just seems to get worse and worse as the race goes on and nobody even notices cuz he's barely on air
The spin continues.  The Dems are terrified of trump because he doesn't play their political shell game with the public. They fully know that Biden is toast if he even attemps to go head to head with President Trump.
Biden abt to throw us a curve ball,I believe he's having second thoughts on picking Kamala Harris.I wouldn't be surprised if he selects  longer this drags out it won't be good news for Kamala and the #KHive
Well you have 2 choices Joe Biden or our President.  Sorry but majority of conservatives feel he has done a great job.  End of discussion for me, duty calls
the same video with joe biden why would somebody think the perfect time to molest someone is in the middle of a picture/video LMFAO are yall fucking stupid.
Trump's support by blacks up from 8% to 24% has Dems worried.  He doesn't take any group of people for granted. Dems care once every 4 years.
The hell Obama didn't control the FBI.  What planet are you living on? Jan. 5, 2017 meeting.  Biden, Comey, Obama same room together in WH on how they were going to take down the Trump presidency. Please pay attention.
He could also be saying that Biden‚Äôs cognitive issues will force his VP to do a lot of work.
I think everything comes down to how we vote. If mail in is allowed Biden wins unless massive fraud is found and Trump challenges the outcome. If in-person is utilized Trump wins.
It shows Biden has a six point advantage.
Let's keep our eye on the ball...the ball is    and the rest of  Getting Fake Package For UK, On Joe Biden They Talking About A Video Donald Trump Already Been Implemented Behind This Same Shit. Devin Nunes, and Ron Johnson.
What are you going to do for America in 2020, at least Obama and Hillary and Biden, aren't hiding there tax returns
The black lives most at risk are inner-city school children. A Biden presidency won‚Äôt help them, writes
Can we get a double debate between Trump/Biden and Pence/Bass? It would be a blood bath
You really think the handlers are going to let Biden face Trump in a live debate? That's a debate in itself.
Normally you would, but Biden isn't the one making the decision on his VP pick. "Come on, Man!"
Good point.  Scientology by most people here in the states is looked on like a cult.  I don't think that info about Bass would be helpful to Biden at all.  Bring her on!!  All his options for VP have bad faults.
anybody that votes for Joe Biden has brain damage  naturally the same is true for those that vote for Trump
I see TWO ways of Trump losing in November, obviously the first way is a Biden victory, but the other is a bit complicated as it heavily depends on who controls the Senate. Should Trump win re-election but lose the Senate to the Democrats, they could impeach AND remove him.
He will serve again under Biden administration.
Can't believe that the people want Biden, he  will destroy this country. Is this want everyone wants?
Kamala #Harris is half Indian (India). Couldn't Biden find someone "more black" whose family background doesn't include owning slaves on their Jamaican plantation? Seems like a conflict of interests.
Just name Kamala Harris as VP and get this over with. We're fucked anyways. It's not like anyone else Biden picks will be anywhere remotely better. They'll ignore and abandon progressives all the same.
#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica üò©üò© He needs to go. I can deal with Biden for four years if it means getting him out for good! üòÖ
I'll leave this out there for all the Joe Biden is for black women crowd...
Damn right !! But joe biden  will!!
Biden is looking forward to the debates. If anyone were to drop out, it would be Trump.
He probably will. Never underestimate the desperation of the American people. It happened in 2016 and it favored Trump. It could very well flip over to Biden this time around considering everything going on. I could be wrong though.
do you guys realize we don‚Äôt even like Biden either. We hate Trump and Biden is not even our top 10 choices. But he is what we are left with.
The concern to the Biden campaign may be what that NDA entails.
I've not gone into depth on any of them. I have faith in biden picking a good running mate.   My preference is Duckworth, but I'm open for any of them.
We shall see,but if Biden doesn't pick a black woman I wouldn't blame them for staying home when it was black women who resurrected his campaign.And there all  qualify in my opinion.
The VP pick has been delayed until August 10th because of the new revelation about Kamala Harris NDA settlement and Karen Bass  Scientology speech.This is Biden's campaign letting you all know that a black woman won't be chosen.Where is  ?
It has to be satire. I couldn't believe it at first, but then again I've seen some stoop this low just for the sake of electing Biden.
Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate
I've wanted Tammy to be president since I saw her speech at the DNC.  I think a single term as VP would be a great springboard to POTUS, we all know Biden serves one term to get us past Trump and to something more progressive.
I agree Mr Wright.  Trump SHOULD resign.   However he better run to Russia before the state of New York indicts him for tax crimes and the upcoming Biden DoJ uncovers the true depth of his crimes.
I don't think it's going to be a black woman at all.Biden has delayed his pick until August 10th because of the late breaking news abt Kamala's NDA settlement 10 years ago.
You act like Biden is President Obama or President Bill Clinton this campaign needs energy behind it.
Your analysis makes no sense,I voting for Biden because Trump is unfit but I'm not overly excited about him just being honest.
Don't believe the polls,this election will come down to 6 or 7 states.And it will be close.Biden is not what I would call inspiring.He needs to galvanized the most loyal part of the democratic base and that would be black women.
Or how about when Nancy Pelosi, Biden, and numerous media outlets called his travel restrictions xenophobic when he implemented them back in JANUARY.
The Bernie crew see this as their last chance to push their agenda even though Biden adopted some of their proposals. No sense of compromise. So glad the Dems aren‚Äôt having a large in-person convention. You know they would have acted up worst than they did  the 2016 convention.
Dont forget what Joe Biden said... ‚Äú we have a crimate clisis.‚Äù
You are not helping the country by constantly showing your hate &amp; resentment to Trump who you served &amp; shouldshow some allegiance. I thought you were against putting out books against a sitting president, treasonous act. Biden for president, really?
But yeah let's investigate Hunter Biden lol
Once the White House  is fumigated Biden will move in. So get ready to bail pops out.
Kamala Harris is known for her many convictions of black people as AJ of CA. She's also known for her "on the knees" job skills to get ahead.  As a Trump supporter I couldn't be happier if she is Biden's pick.   #Trump2020Victory
Trump was also talking about the fact Obama gave what sounded to be a campaign speech at John Lewis' funeral. It was disgusting.  He is working hard for Biden now as he did for Hillary in 2016. Obvious Trump was not confused in what he said.
I agree.  Anyone who thinks Biden is fit to be president shouldn't be allowed to vote.  LMAO
Don't you understand only the black women are being attacked because one of them will be Biden's choice?  He said so.  It's not a racial thing at all.  I don't like any of his choices, black or white.
Biden is leading in the polls he doesn't need to make a risky pick by choosing Karen Bass.And eventhough I feel like Susan Rice would be the better VP pick she has baggage also.Kamala is the safer pick,my gut tells me Biden should pick her as his VP.
She's to risky I saw her this morning on the  and even though she was very knowledgeable and came across as very genuine,Biden should go with the safer pick and in my opinion that's Kamala Harris.
‚ÄúWe have a crimate clisis‚Äù- Joe Biden
Hunter Biden made millions from Chinese coal while his dad helped decimate coal in the USA... shh, don‚Äôt tell anyone
Great activist? Maybe. But he let the district he ran go to hell, didn‚Äôt do much for the people who lived there. Took huge donations even when he ran unopposed and supported people like Biden when he railed against desegregation and busing .
I‚Äôm confused. I thought liberals LOVED taxing the rich. Biden said his economic plan would be paid for in part by taxing the WEALTHY.
I Been With Joe Biden From Day 1,üíô
Who every Joe Biden pick as V,P they have to be vetted they back ground has to be good No Dirty that will hurt the election.
Uncontrolled pandemic, rogue Federal agents, unemployment and no health insurance , violence by white supremacists.. In Biden's America the main cause of all of this will be in prison.
Let's Not Forget Rep John Lewis Said Keep Your Eyes On The Ball!! Republicans party  and  have received FAKE Documents from UK. The Trump Campaign and Gop what's to Smear Joe Biden.  Keep your Eyes On The Ball. #TrumpResignNow
I've seen alot of videos of people who voted for him in 16 who will be voting for Biden now. People with intelligence who admit they made a mistake. But the far right, kool aid drinking, mask throwing racist mfers won't leave his side.
I've been going back and forth these last few days between Kamala and Susan Rice,although I believe Rice would be a better fit For Biden.She has a lot of baggage and her pick would be going back in the past.Kamala is the safer pick.
Choosing only from candidates of one gender is #sexist. Joe Biden has a long history of supporting America‚Äôs #fascist policies &amp; is no friend of the left. He supports the wanton slaughter of #black children through his steadfast support of the racist Planned Parenthood org.
If Biden don't pick Kamala Harris now the backlash will be brutal.I've been following politics for 40 years and I have never seen a potential VP pick being torn apart by there on party like this.
Biden has accomplished basically zip in his four plus decades as a politician. Really don‚Äôt want a guy as POTUS who can barely speak coherently at times.
"The survey, it‚Äôs worth noting, was conducted July 28 to 30, mostly before Trump‚Äôs tweet about delaying the election. If anything, these gaps will likely widen in the wake of his incendiary suggestion." Which is EXACTLY why he made it.
Actually, it was Biden who suggested using the military in such an event.
Let's keep our eye on the ball Trump and Republicans party trying to do play book 2016 watch Ron Johnson and Lindsey Graham. They trying to smear Joe Biden.
botted tweets really expose the fact that there are idiotically defensive assholes supporting both sides üòÇ ever Trump tweet that gets oWo-ed triggers a bunch of Trumpers and every Biden tweet that gets oWo-ed triggers a bunch of Dems üòÇüòÇ
who else will they vote for that actually has a chance though? then we‚Äôre stuck with donald for 4 more years because we‚Äôre divided on our vote while he has a solid base. I don‚Äôt see how it does any good to not vote biden. Trust me, I don‚Äôt like Joe but we need donald out
You evidently know nothing about Biden. Just listening to him speak is proof he has a cognitive issue. Do a little research before calling just one of them terrible.
This is the unfortunate truth Biden folks, #resistance folks, #KHive trolls, blue wavers will not understand. Even if Trump loses, people will suffer and we'll still face the constant fear of getting sick and having no medical insurance because Joe will not enact #MedicareForAll
The only thing Republican lite Democrats care about is taking control for 4 more years to replace RBG and stopping SCOTUS turn even more far to the right. By that time, people will die needlessly and families will face financial ruin as Joe Biden does little to help us.
What's depressing is conservative Democrats are not fighting to make this country a better place to live for those of us struggling in this crisis. Biden has made no promises to uplift and help us as we're facing an eviction crisis and a healthcare crisis. Nothing will change.
It goes to show you how weak Joe Biden is that his minions on Twitter have to comes to his defense because he's such a terrible candidate. Do you think Trump will be as kind as Biden's critics on the left? They're already calling him a socialist, which is laughable.
It's bad enough to having to choose between the two despite the outcome being the same: death by a lack of healthcare access. What's insulting is when Republicans disguised as Democrats tell me I can't tell the truth about Joe Biden because it'll help Trump.
The cold hard truth conservative Democrats are refusing to admit is even if Biden wins there's still going to be suffering under his administration. All they have is "damage reduction", but what they don't say is hundreds and thousands more will die all in order replace RBG.
Show me a tweet about Biden that I originated?
I'm absolutely terrified they will especially if Biden's VP pic isn't to the liking of everyone. I have my VP preferences but whoever he pics I'll still be voting for him. No matter what Trump is exponentially worse than anyone Biden can pic.
I am new to the KHive, so please excuse me if I ask a stupid question. Why do they continue disruptive behavior if we are supposed to be on the same side? After these last 3 1/2 years, you'd think they would work w/the best team to win (Biden/Harris).
This is why I am VOTING for you VP Biden‚úùÔ∏èüôèüèæ

You know, it's sad: that sentence right there might have been enough to convince me to vote for Biden, were I a citizen. That's how low his opponent has set the bar.
'the polls were off In 2016.' yeah no, michigan and pennsylvania were both within the margin of error. Wisconsin was the only state off. Biden now doubles Hillary's lead compared to this time 2016, ESP in the rust belt, and Biden leads in almost every swing and even TEXAS
And as far as I'm concerned, the American people will suffer no matter who wins, and there's no amount of shamming coming from you that will change that unfortunate reality. Biden or Trump, people will die from a lack of healthcare access.
Biden said he would veto Medicare For All and the DNC has voted down any measures of enacting a single payer healthcare systems, along with many other progressive and popular ideas that were rejected. That's not the fault of someone critiquing that insanity. That's on Biden.
Oh, so it's her fault that Biden is looking less electable because of his inadequate policy proposals and not Biden himself? It's because of her criticism and not because Biden has said time and time again he doesn't care about our needs in this crisis we're in right now?
This is the same face we're all making knowing Joe Biden will never fight for #MedicareForAll.
Then why are you on her case when she says Joe Biden will increase our premiums? She's not helping Trump when she points out Joe Biden doesn't plan on doing anything about our healthcare system even in the middle of a pandemic.
That's not her job to make Joe Biden less shitty. It's on Joe Biden himself.
We're not allowed to say Joe Biden's healthcare policy, or lack of, is not sustainable given that we're in a pandemic? Are we not allowed to demand better from the presumptive nominee?
This is who Joe Biden and Kamala Harris attracts. I'll be damned if this is who we have to unite with in order to defeat Trump. A bunch of bitter, hateful, self-absorbed trolls that don't think we're actual people. We don't matter to them. They sound just like Republicans.
Will Biden even make it until then?  His feebleness and addled demeanor is clearly quickly increasing.  The question is, who would really be president IF he is elected?Biden‚Äôs been a public figure for 48 years. I don‚Äôt think anyone needs to be ‚Äúintroduced‚Äù to him.
Why  via  I just want to know when heads of the people will roll at this treasonous WH meeting on Jan. 5, 2017 against Pres. Trump even before the inauguration. Biden, Obama, Yates, Comey, Rice are political criminals.

Essential. Pennsylvania has 20 EVs, Michigan has 16 and Wisconsin has 10. Plus, if Biden can't win Pennsylvania, he's probably done since he was known as the state's "third senator."
WASHINGTON ( ‚Äî US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
In that scenario, Biden would still win the White House if he lost all the tossups, yes.
NC has 15 EVs and Florida has 29. So that would be 290-169 Biden with 79 EVs undecided. Arizona has 11 EVs.

America wont be America anymore if Biden gets the reins. I'm just glad it isnt Bernie cuz then we would really be fucked
We do not, but we also know that Biden isn't going to change anything, and honestly could open the door for Republican resurgence. Some of us are looking past the next four years. But we also know that the US can't survive another four years of trump. So, handwringing.

I don‚Äôt know why but I feel that Biden was put in place to insure trumps victory.. otherwise why have him there at all. There were a few far better Candidates to choose from that could go toe to toe with trump.

The thing about Biden that people don't understand is he is of the old school of prejudice against blacks.  It is so deeply ingrained in him that it's not gaffe's he keeps making - he truly doesn't get what's wrong with what he says.

No one cares.  Get back to contrasting Trump vs Biden on taxes and law and order.   Otherwise Biden wins.

And you cannot think of anything intelligent to say so you resort to insults. Trump has been running the country just fine, just because we like him or vote for him does not mean we are stupid. It's not Biden we gotta worry about he don't want to be Pres. he'll hand it to VP

I have an idea...in the Biden/Trump debate every time Trump says ‚Äúfake News‚Äù the audience yells ‚Äúthe truth‚Äù and takes a drink!
One reason Biden may be having trouble finding a running mate that can help him win: Out of black women in Congress, only 2 (Lucy McBath &amp; Lauren Underwood) come from competitive districts, and both were first elected just in 2018.

Hello I'm comotose Joe Biden, and I just won the Senate seat
That‚Äôs my point. A lot of us have trust issues. Joe Biden having a black women beside him is kind of like reassurance.
Biden should just be ignored when he asks a black man if he‚Äôs a junkie... Imagine if Trump had said this
Hillary will not be in the Biden Administration

Agree!  No tax returns from Trump = no debate with Biden!

. once said about Donald Trump "We're gonna impeach the mother fucker".  To all you #Resistance #KHive #BlueWave folks who were hoping she would lose her seat last night because you were bitter about her not endorsing Joe Biden: she's here to stay, so deal with it.
I am so fucking sick of all the tweets and polls about who you think would be the best and/or will be Biden's VP pick!! What a fucking waste of time! He could choose an empty Nickelback cd case and still be orders of magnitude better than Blotus and Co. #fucktrump #biden2020
Joe Biden‚Äôs family isn‚Äôt running. Try harder.
Well, you have obviously not paid any attention to the morons who inhabit Trump world. It will end up on Facebook, be shared a billion times and used as proof that ‚ÄúJoe Biden is near death, here look‚Äù by the dimwitted denizens of MAGA.
Comotose Joe Biden, wake up time for your pill. Then will work on that enema.
Sorry folks, if comotose if comotose Joe Biden and the DNC steal this election, you better go buy guns and prepare for the end of this beautiful country. Please pray to God this does not happen.

"Sources closest to Biden's campaign has confirmed that the reason for Biden's absence is due to the presumptive nominee not knowing where Milwaukee is at".  Kidding, but be funny if true.
Does Joe Biden even know where Milwaukee is?
Biden is a racist.   It is sort of baked into  now.
For democracy's sake there needs to be debates, but Biden can run victory formation 3 times, take a knee and run out the clock. Donny T will self implode with or without debates...
The chances of Biden sweeping ALL FOUR of those state is not statistically great, if I were a gambler.
With MI it really depends if Dems come out in droves for Biden in the Detroit area (and Trump's surging favor. w/ blacks) - I don't know that that occurs.  I ALSO think there are many, many Rs who are furious with the MI Governor, of which this could be a referendum on her.
Read the article again - Biden counters by saying they are making many phone calls, but how many ppl are actually listening on the other end; I don't think that is as effective as face to face conversations.  My .02.
One million doors in a week - that's insane.  ZERO from Biden - I think that is a mistake.  He's getting little following on his Zoom calls.
what do you think about all the doors RNC is knocking down....!?  No door knocking for Biden?  No rallies, pressers?  Just TV ads!?
40% OF Americans believe Joe Biden cognitive ability is worrisome.
Those of us who know why Biden responded that way will probably vote for Biden. However a President needs to speak clearly and avoid snark and sarcasm. He asked a black reporter if they took a drug test. If that was Trump asking what would you think?  is better than that
Biden ahead by any amount will benefit down ballot democrats.
Suggestions that he skip the debates are coming from pundits outside the campaign.  Biden has never wavered in his commitment to three televised debates.
If Trump loses, a resignation would be no value. Pence‚Äîif sworn in for 3 months could NOT pardon State crimes! And, he‚Äôd only be POTUS until Biden is sworn in. üë†
People who take cognitive tests don't brag about it because if you take a cognitive test it means you're cognitive abilities are in question. Biden clearly felt like his cognitive abilities were in question and instead of responding gracefully...
In 48 years of public life Joe Biden has never been credibly accused of corruption.

Joe Biden won't go to Milwaukee for acceptance speech
Bernie would have been a better candidate. Hell...Bernie, Warren, Yang, anyone.  This whole election is horrible from every angle. I will vote for Biden because We can't do 4 more with Trump but it's ridiculous that once again these are our choices
I have not heard much of anything about the dumpster fire trump interview from Krystal Ball and Shaun King but retweets. As soon as Biden makes a gaff, it's the biggest thing since sliced bread and they get all critical mass about it. Jackasses.
WASHINGTON ( ‚Äî AP source: Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic presidential nomination.
Pour a glass of the good stuff, sit back in your most comfortable chair, and enjoy the ride.
And my point is, the Democrats/those on the Left still want to hold Trump accountable for his past/current words/deeds, but want to give Biden a pass for his past/current words/deeds. That's blatant hypocrisy! Trump has been working with the black community, what has Biden done?
‚ÄúJoe Biden thinks he has Black vote sewn up but I beg to differ. There was poll that said Biden has only 78 percent of the Black vote.‚Äù
Running mates will be super important in 2020.
Joe Biden does not want to debate Trump at all, but surely not until many or most people have voted by mail so they can't change their vote when they realize he is experiencing serious cognitive decline.
I have ask if Biden is high?   Many people actually do routinely get tested for cocaine (and other substances) before they go to work.   #GreenNuclearDeal

There's a better chance of seeing a woodbooger than a Biden Trump debate.

Jill Biden on Dana Perino's show today: Joe will participate in all 3 debates.   Umm...Unless he is the doorman, I think I will believe that when I see it.  #Biden2020Loser
It‚Äôs done. He‚Äôs through. Joe Biden will become President and we will spend the next 2 decades rebuilding what he burned to the ground and beg forgiveness from our allies.
Trump on Lou Dobbs today, calling Biden "a puppet for the radical left" &amp; saying of their platform, "When you think about it, they're against oil &amp; gas, they're against guns &amp; I guess they're against God, okay? But they're against religion. They're against the Bible, certainly."
Who's doing this for you ,Dr. Jill Biden, why not she did a interview for you today.

I love that a bunch of conservative commentators are saying Joe Biden is afraid to debate Donald Trump.  They're creating so much to throw in Donald's face when he refuses to debate.  He knows it's going to be a shitshow after his recent interviews üòÜ #TrumpMustDebateBidenLIVE
Wait, what? Do you know how many times that statement by Trump has been brought up over the last 4 yrs? Constantly, so yea, Biden's is relevant. Lest you forget his more recent statement, "If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black".
Drove all through his state and didn‚Äôt see a Biden sign in Delaware or Maryland, pedo joe is in deep shit just like Killary and billy boy.
Lol. Well there‚Äôs Biden.
I've noticed very few liberals are willing to admit that people will suffer even under a Biden administration. A lot of them sugar coat it, but if you dare say it then they lose their minds.
Biden is a centrist, respected on both sides of the aisle.
Yeah well guess what he sucked and Biden will too
One thing you have right NO he did nothing and where were you for those 8 years there was plunity going on the he decided to not act on how about Maryland how about Benghazi Obama and Biden did nothing for the American public but raise taxs and healthcare that sucked
Look at a 1st day of school in Georgia, it's obvious this opening school early will be a failure. Than again that's trump moto. Obama/Biden left trumpba growing economy with a pandemic taskforce and trump messed all that up. Talking about M.A.G.A when he the one mess America up
Simply do not understand why Trump, his falsehoods &amp; ugliness are covered daily in prime time? He ruins space for normal good programming.  If he ever says anything important, the networks can excerpt that portion &amp; show later. Why does Trump get this time when Biden doesn‚Äôt? üë†
Jill Biden promises her husband will debate Trump this fall, is 'close' to choosing running mate  #FoxNews
Ah, I see you're planning on blaming Biden's loss on powerless people who just want a better world instead of, you know, the giant corporations that rig every election. Maybe punch UP, David? I'm no comedian, but I hear it's more funny that way.
My vote goes to Biden.
That‚Äôs one of the top reasons Biden has to win!!!
#SettleWithBiden is such an apt description that perfectly sums up people's callous behavior about this fucking situation we're in: "There's still going to be suffering and death, but we'll settle for less of that with Biden". I long for a system that helps everyone. Full Stop.
I wish you hadn‚Äôt suggested Biden skip the debates. They‚Äôre making a huge deal about it on Fox. It fits in with their ‚Äúhiding in the basement‚Äù schtick. Don‚Äôt feed the beast.
I've said it before and I'll say it again. There's very few who are willing to admit that there's still going to be people suffering in Joe Biden's administration. It's now only a matter of how many will suffer is what drives their decision. Why does it always lead to suffering?
You have that right!  That's why we cannot elect Biden.  #Trump2020Landslide
Surely biden will keep HIS billionaire friends in check, right Bernie?
Biden is gonna be president anyway. Trump is not much of a globalist anyway. COVID 19 would go away. Everything would be normal but with a twist: It's deceptive

I'm going to hold Joe Biden's feet to the fire and demand better from him, because I don't care if he thinks healthcare is only a privilege, it's a human right. I'm not going to simply bow my head and accept bread crumbs. We demand better policies from him. What about you?
Given the fact he has said he has no empathy for the younger generation and that nothing will fundamentally change, of fucking course I'm going to demand better from Joe Biden. I need to know what he's going to do if he become president. Is that too much to ask?
By the way, just so we're clear, because a lot of you believe I find the alternative better, I don't want Trump to win. Period. End of story. I just want Biden to do better and not leave us behind and neglect us. We deserve healthcare even if we have no job. We're in a pandemic.
I'm worried about Joe Biden vetoing Medicare For All like he said he would, and any compromise on a healthcare system will still leave millions like me without health insurance even in a pandemic. I'm demanding better for Joe Biden, and here I am being reprimanded for it.
I agree. Compared to Trump, it's a slight shift to the left. I just find it frustrating that we're going to have to beg for Joe Biden to move slightly more to the left on healthcare since he doesn't believe in a single payer system when every other nation has it.
It is sad that as of today the only path to removing Trump is Joe Biden.  America could have done so much better.  Biden is so clueless about healthcare and so many other issues.  He only looks good when compared to Trump.
Went through it with my father in law. Biden does not have dementia. He had slowed down but I‚Äôm confident he will hire good people which is more than I can say for Trump: family members and donors
Because you have some one (biden) that will not be able to answer the questions.
Trump appears to blame Obama for lack of coronavirus tests and says US deaths 'lower than the world' - follow live
If anyone can say Biden has a cognitive decline and look at this Trump Axios video and see this crazy guy talk and support him it's on you this guy is living in another world
You didn't even vote for him. When you grow up you can vote like an adult. Yeah, make your 1st vote for Biden. Kill some more babies!
Without Biden, I don't know that Pres. Obama successfully gets rid of DADT, honestly. Pretty important to me, even as a straight guy, that my brothers and sisters in arms are able to proudly be who they are and not worry about someone finding out. üëè
Trump says the death of my Americans quote‚Äù IT IS WHAT IT IS!! This MF!! Vote biden 2020!!  Listen to the scientific experts asshole!
This gives me some hope that there will be at least someone in Congress who will stand up against a Joe Biden administration.  is one of those few I trust these days.
Something else, which not many people will tell you on this hellscape but polling indicates, Joe Biden is actually a pretty good candidate.  He's relatable and well liked, for reasons I don't fully understand,  but it's not just disdain for Trump.
It is close, Biden has been just ahead the past few weeks.
If I'm in the Biden campaign I'm considering Texas a "must" win in this environment. Make the win so big and so decisive that failures with mail in voting doesn't matter.
You may want to broaden your information diet.  "Shy voters" are a thing, especially in 2020.
You want to help American's save our Constitutional Republic help spread the word in Virginia the we exist.  One cannot support Donald Trump &amp; the Constitution of the United States anymore that supporting Joe Biden will save us from Donald Trump &amp; Democratic or National Socailsm

Me: Hey, I'm worried about Joe Biden's plan, or lack of, aside from defeating Trump in November. Where do we go from there?  Centrists: How dare you ask questions. Are you serious? Are you stupid? Have you been living under a rock? Just be silent and bow your head. You lost.  üôÑ
I mean, what's the point.  Its not like your dad has nothing important to say.  He never does.  Besides, after his creeping around in the background behind Clinton, we just assume your dad is gonna keep trying to cough on Biden and we love Joe too much to subject him to that.
I didn‚Äôt think simply asking for Biden‚Äôs plan would generate such anger and frustration. Forgive me for asking and not simply being quiet and do as I‚Äôm told. I‚Äôm just asking for guidance in this dark time.
I think asking for Biden‚Äôs plans after he wins is not so much to ask for, but apparently it‚Äôs taboo for some. I‚Äôm just worried Biden won‚Äôt do anything in terms of healthcare even in a pandemic. He still thinks healthcare should be tied to employment.
I have been living, thankfully. Despite my depression for all these last 4 years I‚Äôm still living. Bernie gave me hope, but Biden won and doesn‚Äôt believe in the things Bernie fought for like a single payer system. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll still struggle to have healthcare under Biden.
I didn‚Äôt think asking for Biden‚Äôs plan after we defeat Trump was too much to ask for, but I guess it is for some. I‚Äôm just worried about it having healthcare for 4 more years under Biden. I didn‚Äôt think asking what he would do would generate anger by some.
So hope and pray he nudges a inch to the left on healthcare and has a conscience and doesn‚Äôt veto single payer legislation. Seems like a valid plan. I just hate seeing people suffer while we try to force Biden to do what‚Äôs right in a pandemic.
I didn‚Äôt say I wanted Trump. All I‚Äôm asking is Biden‚Äôs plan for helping us who are struggling and at best all I‚Äôve gotten was ‚Äúadd to the ACA‚Äù. So not changing much. So it‚Äôs back to still be worried about getting sick. I didn‚Äôt think asking for his plan would be so divisive.
Asking what would happen next after Trump is defeated and Biden is elected was rather eye opening. I was mostly scorn by centrists for being worried I would still be without healthcare for 4 more years. It‚Äôs almost like asking what plan Biden has is taboo for his supporters.
OH HEEEELL NO!! üëéüèæ
Trump likes women, no doubt. There is absolutely nothing to make anyone think he is a pedeophile. Biden's videos of touching and sniffing little girls are everywhere. That is not normal with perfect strangers.
"We're lower than the world" - well it's impossible for them to be higher! Jesus christ. And his supporters have the gall to call Biden senile.
What I actually meant to say, is that those members of they yang gang that chose to support Biden are being chastise heavily, from top to bottom, while those that do not or vote for trump are almost praised by some
all Biden has to do is say his name and speak in complete sentences to win the debate and it will be the Trump's campaign's fault that they set the expectations so low for him.
I don't know what will happen if Biden wins other than "not being in a dictatorship" from what moderates have told me in the past few hours. I fear nothing will change with Biden, and things will worsen with Trump. I hate this nightmare and I want it to end.
So, yes, I'm fully aware of what's happening. I lose sleep over the possibility of getting sick and not having health insurance. I'm worried Biden's healthcare plan will still leave millions like me without healthcare even in the middle of a deadly pandemic.
Agreed to all of those. I'm worried Biden won't do much to help us in this pandemic. I'm w/o a job and have no insurance. It's hard to find a job that doesn't put my loved ones at risk with underlining health problems. He still believes healthcare should be tied to employment.
I'm muting this thread. I appreciate those who gave their reasons, reached out and explained it to me. I do hope things will be better soon. I just want people to have healthcare because I believe healthcare is a human right, even if Biden doesn't believe it.
That's what drew me to Bernie. He knew those lobbyists have shaped the political system into what it is, but sadly we're still stuck in it with either Trump or Biden. It's only a matter of damage reduction, which is another argument I hear being made for the case for Biden.
I'm well aware of that and others have said the same. Part of what drew me to Bernie was he knew drastic changes were needed in this chaotic and ever changing time. I worry Biden won't do anything to meet those challenges head on, but sadly that's the only choice I'm left with.
True. Which is why I'm worried Biden won't do much to help us weather this storm that is COVID since he's merely "adding" to the current system we have, which will not help those struggling to find a job and have insurance. But you're right, it's better than the alternative.
I understand that. I only wish his healthcare proposal was more adequate to meet the needs of those suffering in this pandemic, because who knows how long this will last even after Biden wins. Better that than the "alternative". Thanks for your input.
Thank you for those who answered me in earnest. I have some sense of what's to come after Biden is elected. It's just a shame people will continue to die by the time Biden is pushed just a little further to the left on issues like healthcare.
Well, I do appreciate your bluntness &amp; honesty. Not a lot are willing to admit people will still suffer under a Biden administration, but that is still worth removing Trump just so we can make incremental steps during a deadly and ever changing pandemic. Thank you
It would be. I'd also rest easy knowing I'd have a president who believes we deserve to have healthcare that isn't tied to our employment even in the middle of a deadly pandemic. That's something I hope for in Biden, but sadly he's hostile to that idea.
I want to put the fire out, and I also want to know how we're going to rebuild once we put it out. I believe it's a reasonable thing to ask for since Biden has once said "Nothing will fundamentally change". I want to avoid those beginnings so we won't meet those ends.
My worry is even if Biden wins and he's able to make these small incremental changes, I'm afraid people will still suffer because they're unable to have health coverage b/c they can't afford it. Trust me, I want to defeat Trump. I want to know where we go from there afterwards.
I'm not interested in what-ifs because Biden is the nominee.
Okay, so we remove Trump. And then what? What is Joe Biden going to do after he becomes president? What is he going to do to help us not have to lose sleep over getting sick and become financially ruined because we don't have health insurance?
I'm without a job and I can't work outside from home because I'm living with loved ones who have underlining health conditions. It's extremely difficult to find remote work and have employer based health insurance. What is Biden going to do to address that?
Plagiarism has always been his thing!
I'm not. I'm simply asking what else are Joe Biden's plans besides removing Trump? What are his plans to help families struggling to pay for healthcare because they can't work or find work because we're in a deadly pandemic?
So, a list of things Biden won't do, but there's not much of anything Biden WILL do if he becomes president? Nothing on helping our families and the most vulnerable? No  changes to help us in this pandemic?
I don't know... I think this tweet is more anti-Trump than it has anything to do with Biden.
Those Biden-Trump debates will be something...
Gotta love Biden Bros telling undecided voters they're stupid and they don't care. Hey  will you denounce your toxic supporters?
It's to late for the white house to say anything concerning health knowing we've lost more Americans lives in 3 1/2 years under this administration than  we've lost under any president in history. Pack your bags, leave early so Biden can change this death pool back to America
For someone telling me to "adult now", you're very childish for not doing something as simple as telling one plan Joe Biden has.
Is it too much to ask a single plan in Joe Biden's first 100 days as president? It should be simple enough.
What is Joe Biden going to do after he becomes president. Just name me one fucking thing.
Joe Biden is Racist and Sexist only looking at African Females....WTF??
Oh. And you‚Äôre not black if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden.
I just wish a single Biden supporter would tell me what his plans are after he becomes president. So far, it's only "defeating Trump" and that's it. No plans. No fundamental changes. Nothing for 4 more years.
I've yet to hear from a single Joe Biden supporter about his plans after defeating Trump. What comes after Biden is inaugurated? What are Biden's goals in his first 100 days? The only thing I know from his own mouth is no fundamental changes.
"But Joe Biden is senile, at least it seems that way when he talks" Actual comment i just heard today from a Trump voter, shortly after a discussion about how no one should travel by air until covid is more controlled. Compelling argument.
Let‚Äôs Scrap the Presidential Debates
All these plans you claim Joe Biden has, yet you can't name a single one. If you struggle to give me an elevator pitch on Joe Biden other than defeating Trump, then just admit that he has no plan.
Alright,   Influencers, Anti-influencers Trump simps Biden simps  We're all taking a 1 hour cease fire to watch our ray of sunshine do her thing
Biden would not be able to debate The President.
dont snifff panties wait wait wait i thought i was Joe Biden for a second there
COVID= economy-destroying attempt to influence the election. Your kids can't go to school so you have maximum difficulty working IF your company is allowed to be open.  No Trump rallies to show support is huge, Biden won't have to travel or debate and  a mail-in rigged election.
It is really a matter of lesser evils. I know what Trump is like and don't want another 4 years. I am willing to give Biden his chance. Would I prefer a better option? Yes I would.
What?! I didn‚Äôt say that. Biden has the most experience of anyone! Trump is an unqualified, unfit baffling. I said that his VP needs to be experienced enough to take over if required.
What happens after we defeat Trump? What's Biden going to do? Is he going to do what's right and champion your causes? Or is he going to hoodwink us like Obama did before him and nothing happens for 4 more years?
Okay. We defeat Trump. Then what? What is Biden going to do afterwards?
Joe Biden is bad choice for the Democratic Party. Just my opinion.
I'm still donations I been with Joe Biden From Day one,People Stop being Selfish.
Hey didn't mean you I was referring to the person I originally started posting to cause of his stupid post about Biden. So sorry you misunderstood me.
Biden is suffering from dementia and the Demonrats know it. He seems to be declining rapidly. He is incapable of completing a sntence while reading a teleprompter let alone debate
He started at 70. Biden will start at 78. That‚Äôs a pretty big difference.
Biden ain‚Äôt going to make it to November as a candidate.
Except that gray will lead to millions of people still uninsured and without access to healthcare. That gray will lead to endless suffering unless Biden does the right thing and supports a single payer system.
That‚Äôs because Biden is being used by the radical left to gain power but President Trump is gonna win in a Landslide !!!!
Poor Joe Biden, can‚Äôt think, can‚Äôt make sense when he speaks, definitely can‚Äôt handle press conference questions, why would you ever want him to attend a debate let alone participate in one? Joe is toast and you know it! Lol
They didn't convince me to vote for Hillary in 2016 and they won't convince me to vote for Biden in 2020. I have zero regrets.
Satire from the New Yorker. Voters who prefer being alive favor Joe Biden.
Biden's VP pick only matters because people know Joe isn't going to be making any important decisions if he wins the election.
Well don't forget, "If you have a problem figuring out whether you‚Äôre for me or Trump, then you ain‚Äôt black". Cause Mr. Biden said so.

‚ÄòNot a joke‚Äô: Insiders tell Bongino Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline rapidly worsening, getting harder to mask
The problem with Biden's skipping the debates is that it tends to reinforce the common conception of him as frail. Still, showing up would be very risky.
Why would Biden supporters come out to see you and the half dozen fawning people on the roadside?
No to either!! Dems must run another candidate than Biden.
So Biden was accused 1 time and story was changed and she refused to go record about it. At worst Biden has a problem with people's personal space. Trump has been accused 16 TIMES of sexual misconduct. Hmmmm!!!!!!
Facts First: Biden officially committed to participating in the three scheduled presidential debates -- and Biden has repeatedly said he is eager to debate Trump even if the pandemic forces them to hold the event online rather than in person.
Biden will be viewed as a coward if he does not debate President Trump!!! President Trump should show up to debate and show an empty Biden podium!!!üôèüòÇüòÇüòÅ
So a young man, working for his father in the 1970's, gets sued for policies his father sets &amp; you want to call him a racist? That is what you want to stand on? Yet everyone wants to give Biden a pass for his past and present racism.
Only if he'll release tax returns / make a plan for COVID.  Biden does not owe a back and forth full of deadly lies with a wannabe dictator.
I'm just fearful of what won't happen under a Biden administration. I feel like people will suffer regardless of who wins. Damage reduction is the only valid argument centrists and moderates are making. Covid has been one hell of a wildcard.
But, again, I don't underestimate the desperation of the American people. So much lives have been taken away needlessly and families are struggling. I don't begrudge them to do what it takes to vote for Biden no questions asked. This is no ordinary election year.
Biden went on Joy Reid's new show and discussed the #VPPick and did not sound like a candidate unsure of themselves.

Joe Biden presidency would be a disaster for our schools. He sent his own children to an elite school, and parades as the #BLM candidate, yet his policies are openly hostile to the educational choices that offer the best chance for minority advancement.
I would like to know but it's likely smarter for Biden campaign to wait as long as possible to keep Trump campaign from social media attacks on the VP choice.
What If Trump Refuses to Accept a Biden Victory? A Look at How Electoral...  via
This has convinced me to vote for Biden
Biden stepping in it and falling!
I go to sleep counting the electoral votes if the Gods gave us Biden/Obama :)
Trump will win again in November. Joe Biden has Dementia lol
Biden who?
so why is it you and faux don‚Äôt show the Rasmussen polls where 45 is killing Biden. Why? Because you all are frauds with an agenda. Have a great day
No matter who Biden's VP pick is going to be, it won't favor progressives. They'll never reach out to us and we'll be left out yet again. Don't be shocked when it happens.
I want a do over please vote biden 2020
Wow! This is a dangerous man! Our Americans must get back our respect‚Äô we as Americans deserves a leadership!! Vote biden  2020
Exactly. He thinks if we hide the virus it'll go away and not spread to an infantessimal degree. Its baffling. With biden being biden he could have slept his way through November if he just shut the fuck up
I dont speak on politics often but however you feel about trump, he could have easily won in November with the independent vote if he simply shut the fuck up and didnt act like a belligerent baby on a regular basis. Itll cost him in November. Biden is still another dumpster fire.
Sir, the people I‚Äôm talking to here in Chicago are not concerned about the virus.  The people are not even being clean here.   They are talking about Biden being a joke and asking who the REAL CANDIDATE is.  Chicago Loves Trump. I see no Biden signs.
Biden needs to debate Trump period. If he doesn't then he is not serving the people!
You don‚Äôt have to settle for Biden when there is a much better candidate running in Jo Jorgensen.  #LetHerSpeak #ShesWithUs #ImWithHer
Joe Biden is a WEIRDO.
Don‚Äôt be a Dementiaphobe! Vote Biden.
125 years, that the combined time Chucky Nancy and comotose Joe Biden have been in politics and DC. What the hell have they done for anyone???? But get rich!!!
So excited to see you on the ticket! Great news congrats Biden-harris 2020
6. What Biden means for tech  #axiosam
Remember folks #tiktokban keep this trending, Trump is ACTUALLY more afraid of kids rallying against him than Joe Biden, don‚Äôt let him censor you.üëçüèæ It‚Äôs your first Amendment right!
Good morning to everyone. Comotose Joe Biden will destroy this great country. That is all....
. nears final decision on running mate
If Biden is elected in 93 days, we will continue what he has accomplished in his 8 years as VP and 30+ years as a politician.... NOTHING!
I know some people will disagree, and I understand, but Jo Jorgensen is not part of the national conversation with regard to the election. A vote against Biden is a vote for Trump.
No I‚Äôm not voting for   and  Nina Turner: Voting For Biden Like Eating "Half A Bowl Of Sh*t"  via
Biden had 50 years in Congress and as VP...if he was going to do something to help, WHY HASN'T HE DONE IT!!!??
Yes. I have seen both debate biden vs palin trump vs clinton. So it isnt necessary
It‚Äôs real simple.... if you want to keep more of your money... you vote for Trump... if you want to give more of your money away to all these government assistant programs.... then you vote for Biden...ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
This slow-motion Biden vp reveal is so characteristically dorky and anti-climactic üôÑ I almost feel bad for whoever it ends up being
WHY after dems shoved Biden down our throats would they choose a Californian congresswoman (any of them) for VP?? Just solidifies the coastal liberal elite trope. The mid-west and Mid-Atlantic are up for grabs and the left is ignoring them AGAIN
Because Kamala had/has a very insincere, unappealing vibe. She had no message. And who was her base?  Biden would be foolish to pick her.  He needs to pick someone very likeable, smart, &amp; reasonably well-known (this kinda rules out any politician).
I don't really care about polls. Most of them are a bunch of lies. you tell me 46% of this country is going to vote for Joe Biden. I got some oceanfront property up here in Nebraska for you. It's prime real estate.
I do wonder if Harris helps Biden in FL or is it a negligible effect
I honestly would vote for anyone else. Not a big fan of Biden. But I am fighting a repeat of 2016. That's just honesty. I won't vote for trump. Period. We have bad politicians, and good politicians. Then we have trump. And he's not my guy.
I don't have to like Biden. And my party isn't going say that I'm not a real Democrat (which I'm not, actually) because I preferred someone else. Do you know why? Because this loyalty to ONE man is what they do in dictatorships and monarchies. NOT democracies.
Here's a list of facts about Biden. Be sure to read number 35 which Trump ALSO fixed with his First Step Act.
This country has some serious issues. I'm not sure if anyone can deter the present course of insanity, including Biden.
So you think ME2 for Biden
I am confident she is the best VP Biden could choose.
Then what do you really think if Joe Biden wins he will be able to find his way to the White House
I think Kerry was the only one who went early and it didn't help him.  Also, Biden put off announcing his own campaign for months, so clearly he moves on his own timeline.
Just got done blocking TWO pedo‚Äôs who‚Äôll call out Joe Biden for his ‚Äúdisturbing‚Äù interaction with women but won‚Äôt hold Trump accountable for his fair share of trifling behavior surrounding his own daughter. WHY does Trump get a pass?
Whoop! Whoop! Biden 2020  thank you all!!
This is why we must vote for Biden 2020 because of this cramp you put out!! Disgusting ! November 3 will stay‚úùÔ∏èüôèüèæ
I know I've shared this countless times, but I'm going to keep sharing it because I haven't gotten over this and I still won't get over this. I can never get over Joe Biden turning his backs on immigrants who are fearful that they'll be deported under his administration.
Obama picked Biden on August 23rd 2008 without a pandemic making it harder to vet people. Was he indecisive? Seemed to have worked well for him.
To be honest, I don't know. My home state of Virginia has always had relatively close margins. Biden had no ground game here during the primary. I'm disgusted with the "choice" I'm left with. I'm at a loss and I feel like I'm stuck in a corner with nowhere to go.
Let's be real, would any of you be surprised if George W Bush spoke at the DNC this year for Joe Biden?
Biden don't have the charisma to have outshine President Obama.
Karen Bass is very impressive but that Scientology speech is a bridge to far.Susan Rice would be a better VP of the 3 but she has a lot of baggage.Kamala Harris is the safer pick in my opinion so I think Biden should choose her as his VP.
We are on a cross country trip right now.  I have not seen a single Biden sign.  I have seen many Trump signs.  Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and South Dakota so far.
Then imagine that candidate was Joe Biden, who was running on the most progressive platform in modern presidential election history.
I think Biden in on this list bc I've written on his posts saying he needs to do better to give a shit about us and not abandon us, even if it's a fruitless effort. But this is a pretty accurate list of folks I interact with here on Twitter. Give them a follow! Except for Biden.
This is who I think "Biden will pick" ... like he has any say in it....These truly are the "dark days"...
To do that, vote for Biden
told people they won't black enough if they didn't vote for biden, and this goofy wanna be woke mf is still on his radio, but they canceled  what kinda fuck shit is that, i grew up on nick cannon, ill be the first to say, you can slide bro..
U already crashed the economy bud: Trump Warns That 'Jobs Will Disappear' If Biden Is Elected. Jaws Drop.
This country has never seen so much turmoil! People from United States to South Africa will celebrate in the streets when Biden wipe his shoes with the old orange guy. Ain't no Americans walking around this day in age that complexion, ugh just looking at him! Get him out of here
The debate strategy of Biden should set conditions for any debate.  First, that Trump should respond to the 10 biggest lies he has told (tax returns, health care, covid 19, etc). Once  vetted and fact checked I will debate so long as there is real-time fact checking of the debate
To pull a page from the Trump playbook - I'm hearing that Trump is suffering from an advanced case of syphilis he got from Putin during one of their love fests. May not be true but Lindsey Graham should investigate, because it has as much credibility as the case against Biden
One Biden sign in my largely liberal neighborhood. Two Trump signs (soon to be 3 when mine comes in), several American flags, and 3 Thin Blue Line American flags.
But you are asking women to do that by pushing for Joe Biden for president or did you forget about Anita Hill?
Joe Biden just seems to get worse and worse as the race goes on and nobody even notices cuz he's barely on air
The spin continues.  The Dems are terrified of trump because he doesn't play their political shell game with the public. They fully know that Biden is toast if he even attemps to go head to head with President Trump.
Hilarious watching Chuck Todd on Meet the Press say that Maricopa Cty in AZ is 60/30 Biden
Now I did.  "Crucially, President Trump has a lead of 48 percent to 43 percent in the swing states Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin......"
I think (and know) there are many middle-aged (30s-40s), educated whites who voted for Trump in 2016 who absolutely detest the guy now and will very likely vote Biden (with 95% certainty).
When drug companies start taking ads out against you that informs Americans just how dangerous it is having trump in charge. They know he's destroying our country, Biden would never play golf while Americans suffer. Only traitors do stuff like that
Biden abt to throw us a curve ball,I believe he's having second thoughts on picking Kamala Harris.I wouldn't be surprised if he selects  longer this drags out it won't be good news for Kamala and the #KHiveWhy am I voting for Biden and not agent orange!

Do you really think those those NRA members we're going to vote for Biden in the first place.
Must vote for Joe Biden, he‚Äôs the one running against the #TrumpVirus
Trump has written so many of Biden's attack ads, how nice of Joe to return the favor.
If he wins, Biden and Congress will have a few short years to turn the economy around &amp; deliver substantive material benefits to the working people of this country, and to avert climate catastrophe. People are pissed off &amp; ready to twist arms. The clock is ticking. #VoteTrumpOut
I'm voting for Biden to #VoteTrumpOut of office. I have no delusions about who Biden is. He is yesterday's man. He is also the best chance we have to remove the biggest (not the only) impediment to progress in my lifetime.
Wait, you are black??? WTF man... You gotta let us Wal-Mart shopping conservative white people know this....CNN says we can't be friends....and Joe Biden says you ain't black if you are not voting for him! ;)

Read the initial tweet. And the article. What I was referring to. Biden has OR/WA in the bag. Fortunately.
#JoeBiden has announced his Vice President pick!  It is--  you ready for this?--  Mrs. Mike Pence.  #Biden said it came to him in a dream. He awoke at once screaming, "why not?" What better than that way to unite the country!  #BetsyDeVos applied for SecState. VP #Pence befuddled
Exactly, be behind Joe Biden, he‚Äôll pick what‚Äôs best for him, and in turn for us, keep the big picture in mind.
#TeamTrump has already begun demands of #TeamBiden for cyber #Debates. #TeamTrump requires cardboard cutouts for #Biden's audience while #Trump to have fully automated mannequins, MadisonAve Best. Also, social distance for #TrumpMannequins 6 inches, Biden paper audience 15 feet.
Exactly. People don‚Äôt make this a thing, that‚Äôs what Trump wants. Stay on track, Joe Biden will choose the best VP for himself and us.
No! Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt need to get in the dirt with #LoserTrump
I'm curious as to why Biden wasn't at the star studded John Lewis funeral.
Me too, Joe Biden will pick the best VP for him and America, really people look what you have now! Trust Joe Biden, please!
I think any VP pick is going to get all of the vitriol they haven't been able to stick to Biden. Primarily because it will be a woman, but for multiple reasons.
We just had a 33% economic contraction, can‚Äôt travel to other countries, can‚Äôt safely see our parents, massive unemployment,&amp; bc of gross incompetence no end in sight to the virus with over 150k dead and 4 million cases. What could Biden possibly do to be worse?
I hope Biden knows where his birth certificate is
No worries the WH permanent staff will boost his butt out the door. But I‚Äôll bet real üíµ he leaves country before Biden Inauguration to avoid prison. He‚Äôs useless to Putin now. No country for old tyrants.

Right. There are plenty of legitimate criticisms of Biden almost all of the supposed criticisms from the Trump camp are just watered down projections of the problems with Trump.
US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election #SmartNews
The Lincoln Project  &amp; Republicans against trump Will help Biden get over the finish line.  It's impossible for trump to get to 270 electoral votes with Biden winning majority of those states. They'll be quite a few Republicans in the senate vote for Biden. They tired of trump
Essential. Pennsylvania has 20 EVs, Michigan has 16 and Wisconsin has 10. Plus, if Biden can't win Pennsylvania, he's probably done since he was known as the state's "third senator."
WASHINGTON ( ‚Äî US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
In that scenario, Biden would still win the White House if he lost all the tossups, yes.
NC has 15 EVs and Florida has 29. So that would be 290-169 Biden with 79 EVs undecided. Arizona has 11 EVs.
Trump supporters are making Joe Biden sound cool af! Wow!
Shitttttt!    Black voters not voting for trump, matter of fact we coming out for Joe Biden like we did in 2012 for Obama especially after the Obama's come out campaigning with Joe. Watch how anxious black Americans get know they'll see Obama's on the w.h lawn instead of russians
If trump think these great job numbers he must of thought Obama/Biden job numbers we're remarkable. 4 years ago everything was better now people can't even have gatherings, send kids to school safely and we have the worst covid-19 cases in the world only change was the president
America wont be America anymore if Biden gets the reins. I'm just glad it isnt Bernie cuz then we would really be fucked
No he dropped out people writing him in will only split the vote from Biden and make it easier for trump to win. The better a third party does the worse the candidate closest to them will do its called the spoiler effects
I've seen the polling but still struggle to believe Florida and North Carolina go for Biden. Big grey Texas is wild to see.
Then DON'T vote for Biden!
Joe Biden apologizes for comments on diversity among Black people
Worst economy this country has ever seen, Obama/Biden just saved us from a recession just for captain dumb ass to put us right back in a recession
Trump need to look at all the mismanagement of government funds, damn near everybody in his administration is guilty of using tax payers dollars illegally, his kids as well. Biden and his A G will make sure the American people find out before he have them all prosecuted
Whose going after the "Black Vote"? Not Biden. The numbers are better in the Hispanic middle majority. They know Biden will open the gates to the world, and leave that "Black Vote" behind for someone else to pick up the scrapings. He don't need it, he's got millions of illegals!

So your argument is that Biden is more racist than Trump?  The Alt-Right love retweeting you and they would say "You one of the good ones"  Walk tall.
Then you shouldn't be excusing Joe Biden's racist behavior.
I'm not sure their ads are working though. They get a lot of likes and retweets, but that's because they're satisfying to people who are already voting against Trump anyways.  I doubt they're convincing many people to either vote for Biden or simply not to vote for Trump.

Yea the most y‚Äôall are gonna get out of me for the next 90 days is to just go vote. Write in Kanye, idgaf anymore. I wasn‚Äôt faking before about liking Biden and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt.
Kanye West‚Äôs unlikely White House bid is getting help qualifying for presidential ballots in key states from Republicans around the country, fueling suspicions he‚Äôs being pushed to run by allies of President Trump hoping to siphon support from Joe Biden.
Everyday i‚Äôm sitting in disbelief that democrats chose joe biden...like yall are some actually idiots.
I'm not Catholic, but I do know that poisoning and  dismembering ANY life, born or unborn, is murder, and Catholics can't support that. Neither you, Biden, nor ANYONE can justify that with your faith. Don't strut your faith or Biden's when you both support outright infanticide.
Hear me out. Joe Biden was not my first choice, or my second. I wanted Kamala Harris. More than anything, I wanted to be campaigning to re-elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine. That being said, there is one thing I am sure of: Joe Biden is a good man who is guided by his faith.
Id trust Biden‚Äôs caretakers more at this point..

I didnt vote for Biden to be the nominee because of this smdh. The GOP knew it!!
Ignored the  the obvious and placed all their support and money on Joe Biden. All him and Hillary had to do was literally take a nap in between debates until November. Smdh
Kampala Harris or Susan Rice? I hope Biden picks Anne Rice.   She can write several of her vampire books to fund the campaign.
this just makes me want to vote for Biden even more üòà
Biden says something racist. Trump says something blasphemous. Kanye really trying to stop Biden. We're all fucked this Election.
I think he considers himself god. And is afraid Biden will destroy him.
I support  as #VPPick too, but this is a self-serving, ultra privileged, take.  If you believe the fate of the Nation is on the line, there is literally no other choice than Joe Biden.  A throwaway 'write in" vote is the territory of a spoiled child taking ball home.
We need to cleanse the entire GOP when Biden wins. If there‚Äôs not a law to do this then use an EO, that‚Äôs what Trump does!
What happened to Joe Biden?  Barack Obama, that's what happened to Joe Biden.
Perfect! People will be safe to attend the Biden Inauguration in January.
Exactly. Here‚Äôs an even worse thought. IF Biden gets POTUS, he‚Äôs put out to pasture by the Dems on a ‚Äúmedical issue‚Äù or he suddenly dies; then his VP becomes President, and SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE (Pelosi) becomes VP. üò≥

It is sad that as of today the only path to removing Trump is Joe Biden.  America could have done so much better.  Biden is so clueless about healthcare and so many other issues.  He only looks good when compared to Trump.
Something else, which not many people will tell you on this hellscape but polling indicates, Joe Biden is actually a pretty good candidate.  He's relatable and well liked, for reasons I don't fully understand,  but it's not just disdain for Trump.
It is close, Biden has been just ahead the past few weeks.
If I'm in the Biden campaign I'm considering Texas a "must" win in this environment. Make the win so big and so decisive that failures with mail in voting doesn't matter.
You want to help American's save our Constitutional Republic help spread the word in Virginia the we exist.  One cannot support Donald Trump &amp; the Constitution of the United States anymore that supporting Joe Biden will save us from Donald Trump &amp; Democratic or National Socailsm
Voting for Joe Biden!!!
What I actually meant to say, is that those members of they yang gang that chose to support Biden are being chastise heavily, from top to bottom, while those that do not or vote for trump are almost praised by some
I talk all uppity and anti-Biden because I have the privilege of living an extremely safe blue state and my vote will go to him no matter how I vote in November. But, unfortunately,  if I lived in a swing state or even a ‚ÄúLean Blue‚Äù state I would be voting blue - I‚Äôd have to.
Why? trump is a full of shit conspiracy theory nut. He's not fit to be on the same stage with Biden. Maybe he should debate that talking dog. Triumph the insult comic dog. That's more on the level of trump. Sorry Triumph hasn't even been asked and I meant no insult to Triumph.
And we will see you in either federal or state prison, no Biden pardon, next year. Maybe a HUGE TAX penalty? I don‚Äôt know, u tell us, why don‚Äôt you show us your taxes?  No golf courses in prison, nor makeup, nor special 2 hour having your hair glue back for a comb over, Oh Myyy.
Plagiarism has always been his thing!
Those Biden-Trump debates will be something...
It's to late for the white house to say anything concerning health knowing we've lost more Americans lives in 3 1/2 years under this administration than  we've lost under any president in history. Pack your bags, leave early so Biden can change this death pool back to America
Joe Biden is Racist and Sexist only looking at African Females....WTF??
"But Joe Biden is senile, at least it seems that way when he talks" Actual comment i just heard today from a Trump voter, shortly after a discussion about how no one should travel by air until covid is more controlled. Compelling argument.
Alright,   Influencers, Anti-influencers Trump simps Biden simps  We're all taking a 1 hour cease fire to watch our ray of sunshine do her thing
Who would be surprised by that?! Trump will use emergency powers to remain in the White House if he loses election, warns House majority whip
His Humanity l would put that 1st Followed by other reasons to numerous to list or count Joe Biden loves our country &amp; her people That's who he is We would never have the death toll if he had been in charge from the beginning He wouldn't send mixed messages or lie to save himself
They didn't convince me to vote for Hillary in 2016 and they won't convince me to vote for Biden in 2020. I have zero regrets.
Biden's VP pick only matters because people know Joe isn't going to be making any important decisions if he wins the election.

Lol Joe Biden wanted Warren? OBAMA wanted him to pick Warren? Are people this enamored by their own political love affairs that they become blind to literal reality? People (including me) who like Elizabeth Warren have developed an aversion to her because of stupidity like this
No to either!! Dems must run another candidate than Biden.
Only if he'll release tax returns / make a plan for COVID.  Biden does not owe a back and forth full of deadly lies with a wannabe dictator.
Biden went on Joy Reid's new show and discussed the #VPPick and did not sound like a candidate unsure of themselves.

Listen stupid.  We don't need crowds during a pandemic. Biden supporters seem to understand that.
You don‚Äôt have to settle for Biden when there is a much better candidate running in Jo Jorgensen.  #LetHerSpeak #ShesWithUs #ImWithHer
Three more months of Biden hiding in the basement. Poll takers ate the same ones in 2016 lol
Anarchy isn‚Äôt legal protests or assembly under the constitution.  We see loud and clear the Democrats support the violent protests against the government That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt want Biden to be heard because he is not fit to be president.

How long before Biden bows out, citing health concerns?
Because Kamala had/has a very insincere, unappealing vibe. She had no message. And who was her base?  Biden would be foolish to pick her.  He needs to pick someone very likeable, smart, &amp; reasonably well-known (this kinda rules out any politician).
What if Biden promised up a black vo and then doesn't pick one?  Are we mad?
I do wonder if Harris helps Biden in FL or is it a negligible effect
Here's a list of facts about Biden. Be sure to read number 35 which Trump ALSO fixed with his First Step Act.
So you think ME2 for Biden
It will  If and when Biden wins this (and that‚Äôs a big if), the media will drop everything about COVID and say we did it, we stopped it.
I think Kerry was the only one who went early and it didn't help him.  Also, Biden put off announcing his own campaign for months, so clearly he moves on his own timeline.
Get 100 million of us wearing those, they might change their minds about it! The Biden would copy.
Then imagine that candidate was Joe Biden, who was running on the most progressive platform in modern presidential election history.
This is who I think "Biden will pick" ... like he has any say in it....These truly are the "dark days"...
U already crashed the economy bud: Trump Warns That 'Jobs Will Disappear' If Biden Is Elected. Jaws Drop.
This country has never seen so much turmoil! People from United States to South Africa will celebrate in the streets when Biden wipe his shoes with the old orange guy. Ain't no Americans walking around this day in age that complexion, ugh just looking at him! Get him out of here
The debate strategy of Biden should set conditions for any debate.  First, that Trump should respond to the 10 biggest lies he has told (tax returns, health care, covid 19, etc). Once  vetted and fact checked I will debate so long as there is real-time fact checking of the debate
To pull a page from the Trump playbook - I'm hearing that Trump is suffering from an advanced case of syphilis he got from Putin during one of their love fests. May not be true but Lindsey Graham should investigate, because it has as much credibility as the case against Biden

Wake up honey. Find me the white supremacist who supports Biden. Because they all seem to support 45. Maybe the ‚Äúrace card‚Äù should really be called the ‚Äúequity card‚Äù. If you‚Äôre white and a Trump supporter, racism clearly isn‚Äôt a deal breaker for you.
I think (and know) there are many middle-aged (30s-40s), educated whites who voted for Trump in 2016 who absolutely detest the guy now and will very likely vote Biden (with 95% certainty).
Ok fine. Now help me find the white supremicist who is a Biden supporter...
When drug companies start taking ads out against you that informs Americans just how dangerous it is having trump in charge. They know he's destroying our country, Biden would never play golf while Americans suffer. Only traitors do stuff like that
Biden will fit right in with Nancy.  What a disgrace!
Thank you for doing this in support of Joe Biden. trump has torn us apart, he is the scourge on our nation, our democracy. So many are suffering due to his lack of humanity. l stand with you. Sending positive thoughts &amp; blessings

They just have to worry about their health in general...  Biden is *NOT* for #MedicareForAll during a pandemic that is causing millions of people to loose their jobs and healthcare!
Don't ever let someone convince you to do anything against your will. Vote for Trump because you KNOW he's the one for the job. Biden himself should be reason enough to not vote for him.
It says a lot about our political climate that this "Settle for Biden" shit is a legitimate movement going on. We shouldn't have to settle on who the leader of our country is.
It is interesting that Donald Trump could keep Joe Biden from being in the White House by just fouling up the election process. The unfortunate result for him would be that his worst nightmare would be in the White House.
Anyway, Joe Biden might be our second sock puppet president since the year 2000.  That's not good.
Thank you üíô Followed back! #Resist #FBR
Please don‚Äôt infight. No matter what we have to vote for  as long as his pick isn‚Äôt a republican, he‚Äôs got my vote. Politics is unfortunately about baby steps and compromise. priority 1:drumpf out. Only Biden has a chance. We‚Äôre electing a team.
The leading contenders include California Sen. Kamala Harris, California Rep. Karen Bass, and Obama national security adviser Susan Rice.
Honestly, the best Biden VP candidate is Michelle Obama - followed by Senator Bullock from MT.  An outside the box choice would be Mitt Romney to try and unify against Trump, but the last two I don't think would energize the Bernie base.
If anything, Trump will refuse to debate Biden and in fact has already said he won‚Äôt debate anyone.
Now do Joe Biden and the 2nd Amendment!
Major 2020 election news will likely take place next week with Joe Biden set to reveal his pick for vice president.  #News3Politics

#ADOS Who do you think Joe Biden should select as VP???
It's a curious / interesting decision that Biden has, b/c each VP contender will face a mountain of R critiquing as you've noted.  I honestly don't know who he should pick.  Hard to pick Harris after the nasty debate exchange; yet the others also have numerous, similar issues.
Deer Vice President Biden. People need a road map on how to vote they need something in front of them it doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican but in order that people know how to fill these things out they must see it.
Trump didn't speak on election results until he saw it was impossible for him to beat Biden. We didn't hear nothing while he was campaigning for others. The man scared and his presidential powers can't do nothing to stop November 3 butt kicking

Really, been wondering about that myself. He's so wreckless not wearing a mask I thought surely he would catch it. The way things are maybe some are immune. Wouldn't that be a kick in the ass if he is. I sure hope Biden stays safe.
he's not going to be president IF they win.  minutes or no more than a day or two he will resign due to health and the vp will be president.  any one who votes for biden is voting for his vp  not him

Biden is not even going to get 80 percent of the black vote. And that's just because he's not for Reparations for Black Americans whose lineage goes back to slavery and only them

Mail in ballots less stressful than running across a bunch of poll locations that's closed down or the voting machines not working so pick you poison all votes will count and the margin of difference in votes between Biden and trump will be self explanatory
Also it's basically 50 state elections. Even if some shit tier states like Mississippi or Oklahoma decide to go ahead with it, Biden probably gets enough electoral votes anyways.
I, for one, am happy to welcome anyone who has had a genuine change of heart into the fold.  I sincerely hope all the anecdotal evidence of "Former GOP"/"2016 Trump, 2020 Biden" voters is true.  If it is, and they vote as stated, there's a Dem Landslide coming.
No we mustn‚Äôt. For me, the dems could run a cardboard cut out of Biden and I‚Äôd vote for it. I‚Äôm not a Biden fan - he was not my top choice - but we need to get 45 out ASAP please and thank you.  Again, just my opinion
i hear you but voting for Biden is not possible.
It is very disappointing that Biden won't advocate for #MedicareForAll or do much about many important issues. However, it is very good to know that Biden won't use the Attorney General as his personal attorney, or award the Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh, or commit treason.
Biden would be the downfall of the United States. He is senile and can't hold a coherent conversation, talks shit to his voters and acts better than everyone else. Joe is worse than Trump cuz at least Trump has balls

Essential. Pennsylvania has 20 EVs, Michigan has 16 and Wisconsin has 10. Plus, if Biden can't win Pennsylvania, he's probably done since he was known as the state's "third senator."
WASHINGTON ( ‚Äî US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
In that scenario, Biden would still win the White House if he lost all the tossups, yes.
NC has 15 EVs and Florida has 29. So that would be 290-169 Biden with 79 EVs undecided. Arizona has 11 EVs.

Then you shouldn't be excusing Joe Biden's racist behavior.
I'm not sure their ads are working though. They get a lot of likes and retweets, but that's because they're satisfying to people who are already voting against Trump anyways.  I doubt they're convincing many people to either vote for Biden or simply not to vote for Trump.

Hear me out. Joe Biden was not my first choice, or my second. I wanted Kamala Harris. More than anything, I wanted to be campaigning to re-elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine. That being said, there is one thing I am sure of: Joe Biden is a good man who is guided by his faith.

The chances of Biden sweeping ALL FOUR of those state is not statistically great, if I were a gambler.
With MI it really depends if Dems come out in droves for Biden in the Detroit area (and Trump's surging favor. w/ blacks) - I don't know that that occurs.  I ALSO think there are many, many Rs who are furious with the MI Governor, of which this could be a referendum on her.
Read the article again - Biden counters by saying they are making many phone calls, but how many ppl are actually listening on the other end; I don't think that is as effective as face to face conversations.  My .02.
Joe Biden is a idiot, don‚Äôt even know what he‚Äôs talking about half the time or even where he is at! Lame!
One million doors in a week - that's insane.  ZERO from Biden - I think that is a mistake.  He's getting little following on his Zoom calls.
what do you think about all the doors RNC is knocking down....!?  No door knocking for Biden?  No rallies, pressers?  Just TV ads!?
40% OF Americans believe Joe Biden cognitive ability is worrisome.

Ah, I see you're planning on blaming Biden's loss on powerless people who just want a better world instead of, you know, the giant corporations that rig every election. Maybe punch UP, David? I'm no comedian, but I hear it's more funny that way.
Biden is gonna be president anyway. Trump is not much of a globalist anyway. COVID 19 would go away. Everything would be normal but with a twist: It's deceptive
If you can watch this and vote for Trump, I don‚Äôt know what to say to you. This looks like something off of Veep it‚Äôs fucking pathetic. Is this who we want leading us through a pandemic? I‚Äôm voting for Biden! #Biden2020 #Trumpisajoke #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
or as Joe Biden might ask before leaving the pool, where's Corn Pop?
It is sad that as of today the only path to removing Trump is Joe Biden.  America could have done so much better.  Biden is so clueless about healthcare and so many other issues.  He only looks good when compared to Trump.
Something else, which not many people will tell you on this hellscape but polling indicates, Joe Biden is actually a pretty good candidate.  He's relatable and well liked, for reasons I don't fully understand,  but it's not just disdain for Trump.
It is close, Biden has been just ahead the past few weeks.
If I'm in the Biden campaign I'm considering Texas a "must" win in this environment. Make the win so big and so decisive that failures with mail in voting doesn't matter.

What I actually meant to say, is that those members of they yang gang that chose to support Biden are being chastise heavily, from top to bottom, while those that do not or vote for trump are almost praised by some
Why? trump is a full of shit conspiracy theory nut. He's not fit to be on the same stage with Biden. Maybe he should debate that talking dog. Triumph the insult comic dog. That's more on the level of trump. Sorry Triumph hasn't even been asked and I meant no insult to Triumph.
And we will see you in either federal or state prison, no Biden pardon, next year. Maybe a HUGE TAX penalty? I don‚Äôt know, u tell us, why don‚Äôt you show us your taxes?  No golf courses in prison, nor makeup, nor special 2 hour having your hair glue back for a comb over, Oh Myyy.
Plagiarism has always been his thing!
I don't know... I think this tweet is more anti-Trump than it has anything to do with Biden.
Those Biden-Trump debates will be something...
It's to late for the white house to say anything concerning health knowing we've lost more Americans lives in 3 1/2 years under this administration than  we've lost under any president in history. Pack your bags, leave early so Biden can change this death pool back to America
Joe Biden is Racist and Sexist only looking at African Females....WTF??
"But Joe Biden is senile, at least it seems that way when he talks" Actual comment i just heard today from a Trump voter, shortly after a discussion about how no one should travel by air until covid is more controlled. Compelling argument.
Alright,   Influencers, Anti-influencers Trump simps Biden simps  We're all taking a 1 hour cease fire to watch our ray of sunshine do her thing
Who would be surprised by that?! Trump will use emergency powers to remain in the White House if he loses election, warns House majority whip
His Humanity l would put that 1st Followed by other reasons to numerous to list or count Joe Biden loves our country &amp; her people That's who he is We would never have the death toll if he had been in charge from the beginning He wouldn't send mixed messages or lie to save himself
They didn't convince me to vote for Hillary in 2016 and they won't convince me to vote for Biden in 2020. I have zero regrets.

Why would Biden supporters come out to see you and the half dozen fawning people on the roadside?
No to either!! Dems must run another candidate than Biden.
Only if he'll release tax returns / make a plan for COVID.  Biden does not owe a back and forth full of deadly lies with a wannabe dictator.
Biden went on Joy Reid's new show and discussed the #VPPick and did not sound like a candidate unsure of themselves.

Listen stupid.  We don't need crowds during a pandemic. Biden supporters seem to understand that.
Sir, the people I‚Äôm talking to here in Chicago are not concerned about the virus.  The people are not even being clean here.   They are talking about Biden being a joke and asking who the REAL CANDIDATE is.  Chicago Loves Trump. I see no Biden signs.

How long before Biden bows out, citing health concerns?
Because Kamala had/has a very insincere, unappealing vibe. She had no message. And who was her base?  Biden would be foolish to pick her.  He needs to pick someone very likeable, smart, &amp; reasonably well-known (this kinda rules out any politician).
What if Biden promised up a black vo and then doesn't pick one?  Are we mad?
I do wonder if Harris helps Biden in FL or is it a negligible effect
Here's a list of facts about Biden. Be sure to read number 35 which Trump ALSO fixed with his First Step Act.
So you think ME2 for Biden
It will  If and when Biden wins this (and that‚Äôs a big if), the media will drop everything about COVID and say we did it, we stopped it.
I think Kerry was the only one who went early and it didn't help him.  Also, Biden put off announcing his own campaign for months, so clearly he moves on his own timeline.
Get 100 million of us wearing those, they might change their minds about it! The Biden would copy.
Then imagine that candidate was Joe Biden, who was running on the most progressive platform in modern presidential election history.
This is who I think "Biden will pick" ... like he has any say in it....These truly are the "dark days"...
U already crashed the economy bud: Trump Warns That 'Jobs Will Disappear' If Biden Is Elected. Jaws Drop.
This country has never seen so much turmoil! People from United States to South Africa will celebrate in the streets when Biden wipe his shoes with the old orange guy. Ain't no Americans walking around this day in age that complexion, ugh just looking at him! Get him out of here
The debate strategy of Biden should set conditions for any debate.  First, that Trump should respond to the 10 biggest lies he has told (tax returns, health care, covid 19, etc). Once  vetted and fact checked I will debate so long as there is real-time fact checking of the debate
To pull a page from the Trump playbook - I'm hearing that Trump is suffering from an advanced case of syphilis he got from Putin during one of their love fests. May not be true but Lindsey Graham should investigate, because it has as much credibility as the case against Biden

Wake up honey. Find me the white supremacist who supports Biden. Because they all seem to support 45. Maybe the ‚Äúrace card‚Äù should really be called the ‚Äúequity card‚Äù. If you‚Äôre white and a Trump supporter, racism clearly isn‚Äôt a deal breaker for you.
I think (and know) there are many middle-aged (30s-40s), educated whites who voted for Trump in 2016 who absolutely detest the guy now and will very likely vote Biden (with 95% certainty).
Ok fine. Now help me find the white supremicist who is a Biden supporter...
When drug companies start taking ads out against you that informs Americans just how dangerous it is having trump in charge. They know he's destroying our country, Biden would never play golf while Americans suffer. Only traitors do stuff like that

They just have to worry about their health in general...  Biden is *NOT* for #MedicareForAll during a pandemic that is causing millions of people to loose their jobs and healthcare!
Don't ever let someone convince you to do anything against your will. Vote for Trump because you KNOW he's the one for the job. Biden himself should be reason enough to not vote for him.
It says a lot about our political climate that this "Settle for Biden" shit is a legitimate movement going on. We shouldn't have to settle on who the leader of our country is.
It is interesting that Donald Trump could keep Joe Biden from being in the White House by just fouling up the election process. The unfortunate result for him would be that his worst nightmare would be in the White House.
Anyway, Joe Biden might be our second sock puppet president since the year 2000.  That's not good.
Thank you üíô Followed back! #Resist #FBR
Please don‚Äôt infight. No matter what we have to vote for  as long as his pick isn‚Äôt a republican, he‚Äôs got my vote. Politics is unfortunately about baby steps and compromise. priority 1:drumpf out. Only Biden has a chance. We‚Äôre electing a team.
The leading contenders include California Sen. Kamala Harris, California Rep. Karen Bass, and Obama national security adviser Susan Rice.
Honestly, the best Biden VP candidate is Michelle Obama - followed by Senator Bullock from MT.  An outside the box choice would be Mitt Romney to try and unify against Trump, but the last two I don't think would energize the Bernie base.
If anything, Trump will refuse to debate Biden and in fact has already said he won‚Äôt debate anyone.
Now do Joe Biden and the 2nd Amendment!
Major 2020 election news will likely take place next week with Joe Biden set to reveal his pick for vice president.  #News3Politics

It's a curious / interesting decision that Biden has, b/c each VP contender will face a mountain of R critiquing as you've noted.  I honestly don't know who he should pick.  Hard to pick Harris after the nasty debate exchange; yet the others also have numerous, similar issues.
Deer Vice President Biden. People need a road map on how to vote they need something in front of them it doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican but in order that people know how to fill these things out they must see it.

Mail in ballots less stressful than running across a bunch of poll locations that's closed down or the voting machines not working so pick you poison all votes will count and the margin of difference in votes between Biden and trump will be self explanatory
Also it's basically 50 state elections. Even if some shit tier states like Mississippi or Oklahoma decide to go ahead with it, Biden probably gets enough electoral votes anyways.
I, for one, am happy to welcome anyone who has had a genuine change of heart into the fold.  I sincerely hope all the anecdotal evidence of "Former GOP"/"2016 Trump, 2020 Biden" voters is true.  If it is, and they vote as stated, there's a Dem Landslide coming.

i hear you but voting for Biden is not possible.
It is very disappointing that Biden won't advocate for #MedicareForAll or do much about many important issues. However, it is very good to know that Biden won't use the Attorney General as his personal attorney, or award the Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh, or commit treason.
Biden would be the downfall of the United States. He is senile and can't hold a coherent conversation, talks shit to his voters and acts better than everyone else. Joe is worse than Trump cuz at least Trump has balls

More than happy!! while at first I was disappointed that we didn‚Äôt nominate a more progressive candidate, I now realize I was wrong,  Biden is exactly who we need right now to lead us into a better, more hopeful future.
Digital age may also play a role in what Presidents want from their VP. Thus, a shift toward the Cheney/Biden role of Deputy President.

Democrats just cheating as usual because they know Biden isn‚Äôt even fit for debate with President Trump! #BidensDementia  #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica  üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Umm... just remember when you vote Biden, you‚Äôre really voting for #deepstate #obamagate #QANONWORLDWIDE #WWG1WGAWORLDWIDE because, sadly, he isn‚Äôt competent to run our great nation. He‚Äôs a front for #ClintonCrimeFamily #EpsteinCoverup #AntifaBLMDomesticTerrorists
They're not voting for Biden, they're voting against Trump.  And they don't care if it means putting America's leadership in the hands of a doddering fool.
Joe Biden out here sounding real Trumpish
Here's where it originated, and definitely NOT by Biden:
Decarbonize the US by 2035 &amp; keep what we have for less expense? Possible, but would take a serious commitment to bldg the necessary machines &amp; creating a regulatory/policy environmnt supporting their rapid deployment. BIDEN will take the wheel.
The past two weeks of #Biden and the #DNC trashing good policy condemning ppl to death for their corruption &amp; talking shit at a funeral w/ pedophile  y‚Äôall wanna play the victim? Lmao
See people fighting, apply your metric (trump/biden). Could have been in agreement if you spoke about the topic from a different basis I bet
But yes it does not make sense from a reality standpoint that someone with unorthodox mostly far right wing views like Ye would take votes from Biden but that doesn't stop the talking heads and the media
Whether Trump believes that Biden hates God is irrelevant, that is a typical right wing talking point voiced in an inarticulate way. He's not generalizing and alienating his own voters, one is trending right now, the other is just a media Trump nothing burger
Maybe not but just like anything else, the party leader typically represents the party he leads. I think it's pretty clear how the DNC and Joe Biden view black people, problem is Joe can't seem to keep it to himself, this is twice now.
the so-called ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù-theory is they foiled polls in 2016 because they couldn‚Äôt admit they were voting for Trump. Why narrative trying to paint Biden as racist can have effect even though they already know trump is.Helps them rationalize reverting to what they know
The only ones panicking are Democrats who know that Biden on the debate stage will be a catastrophe.
Do you mean why am I presuming to be offended on behalf of African-Americans? Didn‚Äôt mean to give that impression. I‚Äôm not offended &amp; don‚Äôt know how others will react ‚Äìsure there‚Äôs a diversity of opinion :) I do know lots of people watch Fox News Who may decide to vote for Biden
Since  is so eager to make  faith as a Christian an issue in this election, I hope any debate will ask both candidates for the last time they attended a church service and then follow up by asking the last time they played golf.
In terms of winning the election, I don‚Äôt think it matters who Biden picks as VP. Which is why I hope he picks the most progressive candidate under consideration. That would be Elizabeth Warren, and then Karen Bass. Anyone else would be disappointing.
A Biden win is already baked into the market.
Also not worried about probably anyone on this chat not voting for Biden. (Myself in particular!) I am worried about a wanna-be autocrat, enabled by great majority of GOP, with a 24 hour PR station, assisted by the most corrupt, intelligent, and successful autocrats of our time
It's fairly obvious that if you semi follow politics that Democrats view black ppl as a monolith who all think the same, act the same, vote the same.  Apparently no one has told Joe Biden yet that you can't say these things out loud.  "You ain't black if you don't vote for Joe"
Just to clarify: I didn‚Äôt mean not concerned what prominent African Americans think in general ‚ÄîI mean the impact of such a statement on their view of Biden‚Äîfrom my view most highly educated leaders in the public eye, regardless of ethnicity, seem to have picked a lane already
From his comments the other day Biden believes the same thing
The mob agrees with Biden's assertions yesterday--  that blacks don't have diverse enough thought, meaning strong enough intellect  and that it's understandable to assume one of them might be a junkie
Joe Biden Targets Black Voters To Kick Off His Massive $280 Million Ad Campaign
So far, just to to be clear, Biden has said about black people:  1. They do not have diverse enough thought (meaning strong intellect)  2. It's understandable to assume one of them might be a junkie  3. If they don't vote Democrat, they are not really black.  HOW IS THIS EXCUSED?
A 2020 Imperative: Why the Left Must Reject and Elect Biden at the Same Time -
It‚Äôs obvious they haven‚Äôt learned the simple fact that patronizing &amp; shaming ppl w/ a thick layer of condescension for a status quo jackass like #Biden just makes ppl hate em more.. I still can‚Äôt figure out who TF  thought she was coming for
She called Biden an overt racist. Given the last few months of Biden, she hasn't been wrong.  Now, if you want to say she's on the same page as Biden, that's on you.
Obama and Hillary didn't even come close to this.  Kamala grandstanded on national TV and straight up said Biden was the most evil thing a Democrat can be, a racist.  She CAN'T walk this back and be on the same ticket. She burnt the VP bridge with that performance.
Even Biden doesn‚Äôt know who he‚Äôs picked
really excited for President Biden to have these new powers Republicans are about to endorse...
Yup and they‚Äôre still calling #Biden of all ppl a socialist &amp; radical left sympathizer which we told the dumb Dems they‚Äôll say regardless lol
Agreed, this is a searing piece by  ‚ÄîWe must boot Trump, but  Biden needs a wake-up call. ‚ÄúWhile he‚Äôs eager to leverage a woman to benefit him, neither he nor his team has given any rigorous thought to issues of gender &amp; race in advance of having nominated that woman.‚Äù

Do Biden next...
Cue executive order barring Biden from attacking our beautiful lord
Lol I love it!
Joe Biden to jail also for his Ukraine scandal to cover his son. He did say you don‚Äôt get the one billion dollars until you fire the prosecutor investigating his son. He bragged about it on video and audio, public record. The Clinton Foundation also needs a little follow-up.
Is it just me? The Biden campaign seems like another hurdle...attempt, by the left and deep state to conspire and take out President Trump. It is not a true campaign, but an orchestrated attempt to push an agenda and cover up crimes.
He‚Äôs also not sad about Biden saying that his community is not diverse ü•¥
I'm going to be voting for the best man for the job this November. Who is going to get this country back on track and help control this pandemic so we can return to living the lives that we are used to. Our new President Joe Biden.
And just for the record I think even though I haven‚Äôt met him my sense is that Joe Biden is a good guy and a genuinely compassionate person who does his best to live up to his values and has come along way in his views
Fascinating to watch Fox news trash Biden being racist‚Äî then blame him for not standing up against anti-Catholism because Trump accused him of hating God. even got bishop of New York to implicitly back them up, illustrated w/ shots of BLM graffiti on Saint Patrick‚Äôs cathedral.
I feel you 100%! The way I see it is Biden has a lot of great people standing behind him.
We gotta hurry up and get biden/kamilla in office so we can restock our prisons and get that slave labor rolling again
But we‚Äôre not supposed to hold Biden accountable  ... you can‚Äôt do this. I thought you were BLACK!
Let's be really clear here - Biden's son is in business with a Chinese firm, Biden has stated he will end US tariffs on Chinese made products and he will return to the one China policy.  I for one don't think that bodes well for Hong Kong or Taiwan.
Biden speaks, embarrasses himself, then his handlers craft a carefully worded "clarification" and send it out under his Twitter handle. Are you buying this?   Hannity hammers Biden after 'weird, strange, embarrassing public breakdown': 'What's going on?"
You know other blacks dont even ALLOW blacks to be diverse  . They want us all to be the exact same. If you speak a certain way, dress a certain way, WRITE a certain way, are a Democrat, anything out of the norm... ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù. Ironically Biden‚Äôs words as well
95% chance Biden has called Obama "one of the good ones" to his face
"Black people are all the same"  - Joe Biden  "We'll donate money, campaign, and vote for Joe Biden"  - Black People  "There is a sucker born every minute"  - PT Barnum  #fridaymorning  #BLM #Biden
Coming from the man who has broke almost all commandments... put himself before god, adulterer, steals, lies, cheats... ya but let‚Äôs talk about Biden being ungodly... trump would probably turn to fire if he ever step foot in a church...
156,000 Dead already,   You want some of that blood on your hands?   If Biden picks LUCIFER HIMSELF or even Bloomberg, I will still vote for him
Have you heard Trump talk? I mean, even today, he referred to "Thighland" - never mind his outright lies, such as kids are immune from COVID. Trump brags about passing a basic cognitive exam. People act as if Trump isn't a God-damn moron and Biden somehow is.....
Maybe #Pelosi &amp; centrists should stop giving him more &amp; more power &amp; more in defense spending than even asked for. #Biden HAS started wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria  I mean #Obama made 2 wars 7 so both parties are warmongers w/ recent votes.
Anyone making excuses for #Biden‚Äôs overt racism &amp; explaining it away rather than holding him accountable is doin a disservice. It blurs any contrast w/ #Trump. If #Bernie said this bullshit bias ass  would crucify him but of course he‚Äôd never say some dumb shit like this
What an idiot.. how many times is he gonna have to ‚Äòclarify‚Äô his racism so it doesn‚Äôt seem as racist?? The contrast is #Biden hasn‚Äôt done shit to reach Latinos that overwhelmingly backed #Bernie &amp; he takes the black vote for granted as a given.
Agreed. I‚Äôve lost a lot of respect for  There are certain things more important than your short term policy preferences that a Biden-____ Administration might oppose.
Yeah, I heard God was scared of Joe Biden üôÑ
I‚Äôm calling it now: Fox News rants about how ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù and ‚ÄúJoe Biden voters‚Äù are trying to prevent your kids from Trick-or-Treating on Halloween.
Wikipedia had reported that Susan Rice is the VP for 2020. But they now have changed it. Is Rice Biden's running mate?
Biden 381 Trump 157. Will it hold? #ElectoralCollege  #BlueWave
Trump's narrowed Biden's lead a bit recently, but not so much in a lot of key states where things have remained stable.
bad in all races and ethnicities. Biden should stay off certain topics because he comes out looking like a terrible person.
I fear both #Biden AND #Trump bein President. They‚Äôre both senile imbeciles who exist to be good little soldiers for Wall Street. I fear for our troops deployed &amp; civilians overseas w/ 2 warhawks who sacrifice em to feel tough.
Your point? When did I say I supported Biden?
What's weird is at no time did I say I agreed with what he said. As soon as I said I saw another video, people started assuming that I supported him or thought what he said was ok. If they would've just asked, they would've found out I wasnt a Biden supporter. Oh well ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Gives Biden super super super powers. Damn.
Obviously being a Bernie supporter I favor M4A &amp; find all who oppose it to be dingbats. That has nothing to do with choosing to oppose Biden or abstain from this election. Either of those choices would be childish &amp; masochistic.
It makes sense to be an independent cuz the Dem establishment IS trash &amp; hands out symbolic gestures while they rob u &amp; I‚Äôm not voting for #Biden either &amp; DEF not #Trump cuz Repubs are even worse. I don‚Äôt support the dem party atm but there are decent leftist gains goin on too
No one:  Biden: I have hairy legs.
Yes she will. Biden and his VP will be thick as thieves.
When was the last time Biden apologized for anything?  Hillary Clinton?  Has Bill Clinton apologized for diddling underage girls on Lolita island?  Has GW Bush apologized for invading Iraq in false pretenses?  Have you apologized for being a douche?
Joe Biden has been a stutterer all of his life. Takes someone like you and your family to make fun of people.... a typical behavior. Thank God you all got plastic surgery, cause honey that mug of yours sure was ugly!!!!
Weird. No, you're just being an ass because of my opinion on that video. You probably assumed I was a Biden supporter so you decided to troll. Troll away because it just makes you look silly and childish.
Biden truly needs to not talk until election day

The odds are in your favor. Biden stepped in it today. Take advantage of the situation! What Biden said today is WHAT DEMOCRAT THINK TANKS ACTUALLY THINK. Strike while the iron is hot sir.
Today marks a Red Letter Day for the Democrat Party. Biden is quoting someone else when he says this. He is taking talking points from the chief strategists of the Democrat Party.  now is the time.
Report: Campaign surrogates doing the heavy lifting as Biden stays hidden | Conservative Institute
Biden is useless, he stands for nothing, he leans whichever way his handlers tell him to lean.  I can't believe anyone would vote for him.
I though Obama was going to take all the guns, maybe his 8 years was warm up for Biden to take the guns.
Biden and Trump are trying to out-lose each other.ü§£
It‚Äôs priceless that you think Biden‚Äôs rambling is bad. Have you listened to trump?  Really listen?  Off script he always sounds like a word salad.
Not sure what you mean by fall in line. Count me among the Bernie supporters who think Biden is an absolutely awful choice, but who won‚Äôt hesitate for a second to vote for him. We can continue to push for change while still making the only responsible choice.
&amp; he‚Äôll be ignoring u like he is now. #Biden can go to hell right w/ #Trump denying ppl healthcare cuz he takes so much $ from the healthcare industry, saying ‚Äòfuck u‚Äô to crim justice reform refusing to legalize marijuana, &amp; telling Corp America he won‚Äôt rein em in w/ legislation
Biden is the enemy of god?
When did he vote against Medicare for all. I‚Äôm beginning to think u are a trump follower.All your tweets is bashing Biden.

As far as I‚Äôm concerned I‚Äôll vote for Biden just to get rid of trumpkin. I don‚Äôt care if he picks Mickey Mouse as his VP he still got my vote.
Former Vice President Biden - what happened to our US Civil Liberties in NYC? Do you support DeBlasio &amp; Cuomo?
With Trump there's actual evidence of actual crimes. With Biden there is no evidence and the articles you gave me didn't even allege that Biden has committed a crime.
Hasn't resonated in three years. Haven't done anything about it for three years.  Its moot. Trump will lose if he's fighting Obama and not Biden.
Yeah, I should have said ‚Äúwhat KIND of young man/woman will aspire...‚Äù.  Attracts the scum, detracts good citizens.  Although I think Biden has been a rat politician since you and I were kids.
Check this here: I'm ok with whoever Joe Biden picks as his VP, although my #1 pick is Kamala Harris. ALL of us can rest assured that whoever he picks is going to be TONS better than Sarah Palin.
#Bernie isn‚Äôt a racist, corrupt, misogynistic dementia addled rapist like #Biden lol. If divisive candidates never win you‚Äôd never have another centrist Dem win ever lmao thats all they kno. #Biden isn‚Äôt viable w/o #Trump &amp; #Bernie woulda won in ‚Äò16 in a general.
According to Biden y‚Äôall will ‚Äúwith a few exceptions‚Äù
If Biden refuses to debate Trump should go bold and say ‚Äúfine we‚Äôll do it without you‚Äù and invite Howie Hawkins from the Green Party, Jo Jorgensen and Kanye West to debate on a YouTube livestream. #MAGA

when are you going to get your man out of office?  Now if Biden will be elected he‚Äôll turn people away from god. Are you people crazy? You will lose so badly that you will not win an election for the next 20 yrs. You are old &amp; not up with thinking of today‚Äôs populace. Resign
Nancy was dancing in China town saying stopping people coming in was a bad idea !! Biden said trump was a racist for the same thing.. image the carnage if those idiots were in charge üëå
This thread doesn't "help Trump." I don't want either of them elected. It comes down to abolishing the oppressive systems that got Trump elected, and Joe Biden will maintain that.   Wanting Black liberation &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using Black people to "save" the country from Trump.
Ok when did Joe Biden tell Black Americans these horrible words. (Monolithic Lemmings) Oh please let me know why DEADLY Donald Trump stopped all low income housing Black &amp; White &amp; Asian &amp; Mexican American &amp; sorry if I miss someon. He said Whites in the suburbs are same on TV.
Then let the illegals pay taxes and enter the country legally. Biden is a panderer and a liar!
Honestly, Biden is like a lot of old people that start saying what they really feel at their old age...So I just laugh it at, but know that‚Äôs his true feeling
Damn I didn‚Äôt realize Biden was going to hurt god he has my full support now
On the other hand, Vice President Biden's opponent has sworn affidavits alleging child abuse, over 20 credible allegations of sexual assault, multiple accusations of fraud, several emoluments violations, and multiple counts of obstruction.
Nah.  I'm more concerned about Crimate Clisis.  And Corn Pop and roaches and kids rubbing Biden's golden leg hairs in the swimming pool.
So is Biden sleepy &amp; weak &amp; demented &amp; old &amp; feeble?  Or is he an omnipotent being who can hurt God?    #TrumpIsNotWell
If this is what religion looks like today, then yeah, that's not Joe Biden. That's more Donald Trump.  Except, he couldn't do that with his current gut.
its either trump or biden... y‚Äôall pick üòÇ.
Yeah softball lefty interviews for softhead libs . Hiden Biden‚Äôs afraid to go on fox ü¶ä! Libs reclaim their time to avoid answers . Come to think of it with Biden lying about his arrests and that jerk lying about getting shot at perhaps they both could interview each other‚Äôs lies
I do not understand how Biden keeps getting away with the racist things he says.... Iif Trump said this, the. Liberal media vultures would be picking his bones dry!!!! LIBERAL HYPOCRISY!!!
Repeat after me: Black people are not a monolith. It disgusts me how apathetic people are to Joe Biden's anti-Blackness.
If Michigan went sideways on COVID between now and Election Day it would be a big problem. Unnecessary risk for Biden.
in suburban white neighborhood, because that was really good people there. He did this because everything Obama &amp; Biden did in eight you.
Joe Biden could pick 5/100 things that voters are actually asking for and more people would gladly vote for him. The fact that he just won‚Äôt do that is unforgivable. It‚Äôs 2020 and everything sucks means even more to me that we should not having to be begging for scraps
Supreme Court would be great, AG would be great. I just hope people remember that IF she isn‚Äôt selected as VP, there are many other opportunities for her - and Biden will utilize her somewhere.
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
Biden‚Äôs needs to pardon. #freewinner
When did trump start campaigning for Biden?? We dont need any more good reasons to vote Biden, but thanks for another anyway. :)
There's nothing in full context that could clean up that mess.  Biden's dementia has destroyed any natural filters and his REAL opinion of black Americans is coming out.
The Trumpvangelicals, in their plague packed pews, will bow down to their üçä god and cry üôè amen lord! We don't need no stinking masks! Biden is a religious heathen, and heretic!  #TrumpIsALaughingStock  #VoteJoe
I bet she tells Joe Biden to not veto M4A. Wait, we're not in Candy Land?  Nevermind, she definitely won't.
Read very slowly...  1) If Biden is elected President, he will assign Beto to lead gun control.   2) Beto wants to forcibly seize AR15s, a 2nd Amendment violation.  3) Beto not running for POTUS makes NO DIFFERENCE in the ultimate plan.  Did that help you understand, Cupcake?
Every time I‚Äôm like ‚Äú...and where the hell is JOE BIDEN???‚Äù, he comes out of the woodwork to say something extremely dumb/out of touch/racist during an interview and I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúwhy won‚Äôt JOE BIDEN go AWAY???‚Äù so I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that there is no winning, here.

What you just said is denigrating to  African Americans, just as Biden's comments were..  How do you not see that?
Also, Biden talks like afro-latine ppl don't exist üôÑ
That‚Äôs simply untrue.   I didn‚Äôt vote LP in 2016.  I voted CP.  so neither trump or Biden is losing my vote.  Polling is pretty much even on who jo takes votes from.   Polling shows johnson taking slightly more from Hillary voters than trump voters in 2016 but it was close also.
I believe that I was responding to an attack on Mr. Biden.

Yes and the neolibs flatter themselves into thinking that voting for Biden is somehow not supporting fascism.
This is why I make tweets like the one you‚Äôre posting in. To debunk the leftist talking point that he is a good person. When Obama said he is confident in his heart. He‚Äôs saying to the AA community that Biden‚Äôs heart is in the right place. These statements he made today conflict
Just as I won‚Äôt let the idiotic beliefs of trump influence my religion, I will stand strong in the faith that God is omnipotent and will support and vote for Biden, not because of what he will or won‚Äôt do for the church but because he is not a hate-mongering racist.
Starting to think this whole ‚ÄúBiden makes gaffes‚Äù thing may not exactly create the necessary contrast between the candidates folks...

Taking a clause out of context won't distract from Biden saying that - unlike the Latino community - the Black community lacks diversity, and the NY AG calling for the dissolution of the NRA.  Nice try.

I hope Biden‚Äôs team tells him to sling mud. Hillary tried to ignore his attacks and his base got riled up, while she looked weak. He‚Äôs lowered the bar enough. Time to kick him in the balls
Ur reply makes no sense.. just like biden
Maybe the Biden team should just go back to the strategy of keeping him in the basement and let us all just vaguely remember the trustworthy looking guy standing behind Obama when we head to the ballot box (mail it in?)

Joe Biden Targets Black Voters To Kick Off His Massive $280 Million Ad Campaign
I will continue to say attempting to put Black people in a monolithic voting block makes young Black voters like me, apathetic to this election. What this said to me is that Biden does not have to do work for Black votes because we're all gonna vote Democratic anyways.
"I understand the point about not getting too overhyped about polling, but think about this for a second: Let's say Trump was LEADING in the polls and Biden's numbers were terrible. The talking points would be VERY different right about now."
Everybody knew once Biden entered the presidential race he was the sure win for the democrats. And the democrats so dumb that they thought oh yea we got Biden after all the good candidates that were brought out. Now they trying to implement the other candidates policies.
If Biden carries Florida, which counts its mail-ins quickly and could be called on election night, it‚Äôs functionally over, no?   To be 100% we‚Äôll have to see some from the Midwest but I think Biden is &gt;99% at that point.

#Biden just openly stating that black people lack diversity and think alike.  #Charlotte  #Atlanta #Biden2020
Biden brags about his progressive record, but I don‚Äôt care about what he did in the Senate. Some of the things he‚Äôs campaigning on are not from the center at all. He‚Äôs cozying up to folks like Sanders and Warren. He‚Äôs not a centrist.
Ima need Joe Biden to just shut the hell up for 3 months until the election
I‚Äôm fairly moderate. Obama was certainly a staunch liberal. Biden would be as well. He won‚Äôt govern from the center and has never even suggested that he will. He has even touted his progressive record. There are no politicians alive who would govern from the ‚Äúcenter.‚Äù
Agree with your suggestion that Trump is no conservative and I won‚Äôt vote for him, but there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that Biden will govern from the middle. He will at the very least be as left as Obama, probably even further should the Dems capture the Senate.
If people are really going to vote for Kanye West over Biden, our democracy is lot.
I think the difference between Biden and Trump (well, one of the differences) is that Biden is a good dude that wants to help people, but he is prone to have a verbal gaffe. Trump is an evil motherfucker with hatred in his heart and only cares about himself and his ‚Äúallies.‚Äù
Trump outraises Biden in July, breaking opponent‚Äôs short streak  via
Where's the "you about to lose your job" lady?
This is what I see,  This is what I believe the future looks like and how to avoid Dystopian Hell.  This means that Biden is not radical enough for me, but he is a step in the right direction.    So there,  Call me a Liberal,  even a Democratic Socialist, I'll run with it.
Additionally, Biden has shown himself willing to move left. Would Trump? WOuLd KAnYeeE!!??
And my hope is, moving forward, we‚Äôll start to get younger and much more progressive candidates that reflect what America really is and what it really looks like as a whole. But for this November, Trump absolutely has to go. And if Biden sucks, then in 4 years we vote him out too
It pisses me off too. I think I do get what he‚Äôs trying to say, but I‚Äôm not about to sit here and feel like I have the authority to tell you what to think - because I definitely do not. Joe Biden on his worst day, is still a much better option than Donald Trump.
I think that ‚ÄúMAGA blue‚Äù is prob a false narrative kid. Comparing Biden to Trump is like comparing apples to garage doors, there just isn‚Äôt any comparison where the two men are alike. That being said, I do get what you are saying and why this pissed you off.
Seriously, black people are working hard to get this guy elected.  But hey - Since Biden says all blacks think alike, it must be true because he's a Democrat.  #BLM #BlackLivesMatter  #BlackIsKing  #BLEXIT  #walkaway
I think the best response is what has been happening‚Äî ie make sure people are informed about who is behind it &amp; that it‚Äôs a ploy to pull African Americans‚Äô votes from Biden.
‚ÄúUnlike the African-American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community" - Joe Biden
Biden is a confirmed idiot. Even before his dementia. Hope he picks a good VP, but not likely.
Y'all realize any candidate running against Biden would be helping the GOP, right? That isn't exclusive to Kanye. Since Biden won South Carolina, the media has told us that every other candidate is essentially helping Trump by not leaving the race. Media made Biden the chosen 1
Another day, another nuclear Biden gaffe.
So Latinos think freely and African Americans don‚Äôt according to Biden.
Whatever.  The fact is any debate between Biden and Trump under any circumstances will be disastrous for the Democrats.   You know that.
You shouldn't sleep after listening to  Biden just INSULT the entire Black community.  üò≥
I feel like this every time Biden speaks.
Listen to what Biden is saying.  üò≥
How is playing actual video of Biden dissing the Black community in comparison to the Latino community Flat out Lying?  I mean, LISTEN to what he said.
Serious question....... Have you seen the interviews and speeches with Biden? This man is not well, he clearly has dementia and in NO way fit to be president. He cannot put coherent sentences together. It‚Äôs sad that the pure HATE for Trump would cause people to vote for Biden
You're not just voting for Biden. You're rejecting 1% rulers.
And a disastrous Biden debate performance would very likely change their minds -- ESPECIALLY the critical Independent voters.  That is why Democrats are terrified to put Biden on the debate stage.
So watch some of Biden's interviews in the last couple of months all the way through. He is fine. Social media takes little snips and uses  them to fearmonger.  Compare a full Biden interview  to a  full Trump interview.
Biden should agree to no debates unless Trump releases his taxes from 2016 through 2018. No one would vote Biden for this and the American people want to see his taxes.
#Biden   Biden Says He Will End Trump‚Äôs Tariffs On Chinese-Made Goods  And the WalMart board members stand up to applaud - opening their Chinese money filled wallets for Biden
Trump needs to run on his record + the fact that Biden isn‚Äôt a ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô.  Voters can SEE his dementia &amp; need no reminders. Trump‚Äôs real record (not press‚Äô version) is astounding and benefits our citizenry of all races. Tout it!
Joe Biden launches new national ad aimed at Black Americans
If you actually think Trump is refusing to debate with Biden you got to be missing brains cells. Trump will laugh at the debate while Biden annihilate himself...
How is THIS okay?? You tell people who are vulnerable to stay at home, and then you send virus spreaders to their house? If they hit my house I hope they can make it to the fence before my dogs do ü§®
Biden stans are failing in the marketplace of ideas. Clearly Biden himself cannot beat drumpf.   But there‚Äôs a secret üëÄüëÄ law that would allow a certain someone üò©üò©üò©üò≥ to secure the nomination still!  Here‚Äôs how Bernie can still win:   1/???

Fire him, but then again, he represents his community, we suffer our leaders' &amp; gods' fates and personalities, as humans always have a social media post by Mayor Barry Presgraves who wrote: ‚ÄúJoe Biden has just announced Aunt Jemima as his VP pick‚Äù
God I still miss this man so much! Even Robin Williams understood #biden #laughter #comedy #robinwilliams
I will vote for Biden no matter what. That said, I think trump will tear him apart in the debates.
I would like the VP nominee to be ambitious and be working toward a possible president run in their future. Joe Biden is late 70s and possibly a one-term. Let‚Äôs think of the future!
Nothing Biden does bothers me because he‚Äôs not going to win.
As a Speech-Language Pathologist, I urge you to cease w/ this harmful line of criticism.  By all means critique Biden's policy proposals.  Stuttering is a fluency disorder and is not indicative of cognitive decline.   &amp;  are good places to educate yourself.
Would be a good way for Biden to avoid the debate without losing face
Could this be a peek into the future? üó≥
It‚Äôs going to be a repeat of Reagan/Mondale.   Absolute crushing of Biden.
Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report
We fucking hate #JoeBiden, deal w/ it. Yea, that‚Äôs not accurate at all lmfao and #Bernie never came in 4th &amp; 5th. #Biden was a huge loser before #Obama cleared the field. Ur the only ones excited abt him cuz ur dumb &amp; think he‚Äôll save u. 13% my ass.
I've heard the unsubstantiated allegations, but no one has pointed to any clear evidence that VP Joe Biden has committed any crimes.
All of this seems to be allegations about Hunter Biden without any clear connection to Joe Biden, the man you are accusing of crimes here. Are you referring to the fact that VP Biden got asking price on his house?
Yes,  is more than equipped to get our country back united, fix foreign relationships and bring some integrity back to government &amp; this country. Biden has a stutter, all his life, he is actually a very wise person and we need him now more than ever!!!!
2/ If she lines up completely w/ #Biden‚Äôs politics hopefully she gets primaried first before becoming Prez. I DGAF about the 1st woman if it‚Äôs someone that‚Äôll just be another good little soldier for Wall Street then identity means nothing. Lives are stake &amp; policy matters
U clearly are; any #Biden supporter has to be high if they‚Äôre happy voting for him lmfao. He‚Äôs a disaster &amp; should just stop talking cuz he‚Äôs a clown. Only way he was electable was #Trump failing on #COVID19. Centrist Dems &amp; Repubs just wait for each other to fail, ppl be damned
BBC News - US election: Biden to accept nomination remotely as virus worsens
TF ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ‚Äúare u a junkie?‚Äù ...I mean rly?!? That‚Äôs the first thing he thought of as a response? #Biden is a ü§° and this is racist
Because he won't solve and he already said he will veto M4A.  Dude, what's up with the lack of understanding for the topics you're talking about? I'm asking generally and genuinely. Do you actually think Biden and the ACA will help solve the price of drugs in the US?
This cinches it cause tRump always accuses other of what he is guilty of. tRumps dr states that Biden has suffered from ‚Äúsilent strokes‚Äù so now we know for sure
WOW. You spoke against Trump. You are reporting facts. Now tell everyone you are voting for Biden. Trump needs to be out of the WH. He‚Äôs a traitor. You know that. Be courageous. Endorse Biden. Save our Republic. DJT likes Putin. OMG. Trump is selling America out each &amp; every day.

Biden to Black Journalist: ‚ÄòAre You a Junkie?‚Äô  #BLM
If you vote for this senile idiot,  you should probably give yourself a lobotomy.  #thursdaymorning  #PhillyPower  #biden
Tell me why Biden‚Äôs VP choice should not be a White female?        Percentage of Total Women in US Population (2018) White (not Hispanic or Latina) 60.3% Hispanic or Latina 17.8% Black or African American 13.7% Asian
the problem is people who watch Fox News believe every single word they say. And then believe every single word Trump says. That‚Äôs 41% of the nation. Don‚Äôt fool yourself into thinking Biden has anything in the bag. Trump needs to flip 9.0001% and he wins.
Hunter Biden bombed Beirut.
Pretty fucking clear, peel off 1 to 2% of the black vote from biden
But, I don't know. I'm a dad trying to make the right decision for my children while sorting through Facebook and Twitter posts, and all people do is insult one another and cite this other post they read. It's genuinely confusing as hell.
Republicans are hoping that if West is on the ballot he could siphon off votes from Biden, especially from Black voters.  #DonsNextCon #BlackLivesMatter
I wonder the same thing. The science seems to suggest it isn't statistically likely to make them seriously ill, not that they can't get it.  And if they get it, don't tend to get severe (or any) symptoms absent co-morbidities, and don't really spread it, should we panic?
The US visitors Taiwan most needs right now would be from Biden‚Äôs foreign policy advisors, including his future picks for State, DOD &amp; Conmerce posts.
Is the strategy based on research? While a much larger % of African Americans are planning to vote for Biden, far fewer Biden than Trump supporters are likely to switch to Kanye. The strategy seems to be based on simplistic, stereotypical assumptions re  African American voters.
Biden's on track to do slightly better than Northam in Virginia this November. So the question is...can he carry Caroline and Nelson Counties, which are likely to also be voting for Warner in November? Northam barely lost each in 2017.
This didn‚Äôt happen, Sally. BIDEN was caught, on video doing EXACTLY this very thing. The #1 contributor to the CGI was Ukraine, Sally.
isn‚Äôt doing our side much good by making fun of Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline.   That‚Äôs small, Sean.   Biden‚Äôs condition should be pointed out loudly and constantly, but don‚Äôt make fun of the decline of another human being. Makes you a dick and makes people pity Joe.
The question for Virginia is not whether Biden will win it or not. He will. It's a matter of whether he's winning by double digits or not.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Where #JoeBiden stands on #BuildTheWall
If Biden wins Wisconsin he will win the election, so it could do a lot.
You mean Trump and Biden. Both racist. And I never professed to be nice. I said the original post isn‚Äôt accurate
Even the best edited takes of Biden talking seem off
The Dem plan has been FUBAR'd by the fact that Biden is unexpectedly disintegrating at an alarming rate. Surely they thought he'd be jauntily hopping around from one campaign stop to the next, while these fake polls were dutifully being barfed up by the obedient press.
Timing?? U just made her sound even worse putting off justice for political gain.   are just as much fake news as  so üòí. #Biden won‚Äôt care abt cracking down on the powerful lmao he never has. Y‚Äôall are foolish. He just demonized protesters parroting #Trump
Kamala goes well with Biden
The choice between President  and  is clear. The Trump Administration is working to undo the decades of damage caused by policies Joe Biden favored. #LeadRight
I doubt #Mcconnell or #Pelosi EVER bring such a bill to a vote &amp; both #PelosiMustGo #McconnellMustGo (thanks to centrists for fucking up #DitchMitch tho) #WealthTax is another thing most Americans want but currently Congress/Senate/WH won‚Äôt deliver. Too bad we‚Äôre stuck w/ #Biden
‚ÄúIts condemnations of Trump don‚Äôt acknowledge the GOP‚Äôs culpability for creating the conditions for his rise. Allowing the group influence over a Joe Biden presidency will cripple his ability to rescue the country.‚Äù
Putin doesn‚Äôt need to spread Neo-Nazism cuz it already existed in our country unless ppl forgot about the KKK or the 90‚Äôs rise, Jim Crow, segregation (#Biden prolonged) the Russia hysteria needs to stop. The  just struck down our policies so try again cuz no centrists DGAF
If #Biden/centrists wanted votes from the left they should prolly adopt some of our policies and stop fucking spitting in our faces. They‚Äôre no allies and the sooner leftists &amp; progressives realize these ppl call for unity while shanking us the better. No one cares abt Putin jfc
#Biden is neoliberal trash as corrupt as they come who helped get my brother killed in his for profit wars. He wants to deny ppl healthcare in a pandemic cuz he receives the most $$ from health insurers &amp; Big Pharma. It‚Äôs not divisive, it‚Äôs realizing ur one sided unity is BS
Joe Biden probably can't spell "Gun Ban"
Joe Biden is the don‚Äôt ask, don‚Äôt tell of actual governance
Warren left her seat open this year to run for State Senate, and won easily against Skubal. This district is more left than her State House seat though, and it's going to vote for Biden this year given the trends, just a matter of how well he does in the seat.  (5/6)
Alas - reason is the last thing on Democrat minds at the moment - with brain dead Biden, loving the Antifa riots, crippling the economy in order to seek power and selling out to Communist China.
Let them think they have the upper hand on this. But the rest of us who will vote Biden have ways around this.üòä
You‚Äôll have to paint the Biden Shepherds. Champ and Major?
The former vice president, who is 77, also tried to turn the matter back around on the 74-year-old president in the latest jousting over the two men's fitness for office.
I unironically think Biden should do vintage car reviews to win over like 5 disgruntled conservatives
Could there be two worse picks for VP?
What Joe Biden thinks we want: Him in a Corvette taking a cognitive test  What we want from Joe Biden: Him with a rare brain disease that makes him support Medicare For All and shut down private prisons
Right. Yang has a platform of 150 policies I agree with, but my racism makes me loathe Biden's current short list. Don't forget sexism while you're at it.
No offense whatsoever, but If you're not an American then please do not tried to discredit Joe Biden  Trump is single-handedly tearing our country apart. People are getting murdered in the streets and our democracy is crumbling.  This man has to go NOW!!
Sure it does, at least one isn't a racist misogynistic psychopath.  On top of that, Biden would actually listen to his advisors and not act like a baby every time he doesn't get his way.
Dreamt the Biden did something terrible and Trump is re-elected. But Ds win massive majorities in both houses. Impeachment proceedings start first week of January. Trump resigns. Pence pardons, names Ivanka VP. Pence resigns. She names Jared VP, citing House of Cards precedent.
He can release his taxes and then Biden will consider his request.
Debates - waste of time. If you‚Äôre not convinced to vote for Biden by now you‚Äôre hopeless
This is a great ad imo. Biden showing something he cares about and makes him seem like a regular guy. Good work from the campaign staff.
Only 4 years of Biden tho
My only hesitation is trump. I‚Äôd be more comfortable if it‚Äôs a Biden admin at that point.
it just doesnt sound like its going to take votes from Biden, if anything it its more likely that it will take Trump voters
Been away from the news all day, has Joe Biden fingered his VP yet?
So Joe Biden will continue to hide in his basement and will not be going to Milwaukee.  How can anyone who is afraid of a virus with a survival rate of greater than 99% ever run this country?
The final 2? Biden confidants see VP choices narrowing to Kamala Harris and Susan Rice
I loathe Trump--but only Democrats would think that there is something wrong with measures to keep people from entering the country illegally. I'm voting for Biden--but there will be a million people at the border--all with sad stories--on inauguration day if he wins.
And Kamala is being considered for VP?  Really?  Not a good sign for the DNC/Biden.
Biden no longer coming to Milwaukee to accept presidential nomination  #politics #2020Election #Election2020
Biden returning to his honey comb hideout...
Joe Biden is going downhill faster than an Olympic skier
The people in the stands are as creepy as Biden is. Ew.
Hence Biden will be a no show at the debates.
#Biden can articulate a thought.
Biden doesnt know what day it is and he touches kids and has allegations of rape and mis dealings with ukraine and china ..
one thing is certain... It ain't Joe Biden
The problem with that narrative, other than it's a false narrative, is that it ignores Biden's stutter. Watch Biden demolish Trump. That's one of the reasons Trump is advancing the bullshit argument that mail-in voting will increase voter fraud.
Biden hahaha .. guy doesn't know what plannet he is on..
Nobody that‚Äôs going to vote for Kanye was ever planning to vote for Joe Biden
The "Biden is losing it" argument is weak. It's just as weak when they tried that crap with HRC. They are still trying to advance that crap narrative in the face of Trump bragging about passing a basic cognitive test. Come on man. Sell that load somewhere else.
You want to know the Kanye voter? It's these:  - the young person who feels disillusioned by American politics and wasn't going to vote for Trump or Biden anyways - the young white frat bro who doesn't know the 3 branches of government and was going to vote for Trump
They're delusional. Also, Kanye takes votes away from Trump, not Biden. Republican operatives are daft.
This is the difference between  and Donald Trump. Joe cares about the safety of the public while Trump only cares about himself. #Biden2020   Biden will no longer travel to Milwaukee for DNC amid coronavirus concerns - ABC News -  via
It‚Äôs 3PM in Beijing - 3AM in Washington DC and Biden‚Äôs phone in the White House rings.. it‚Äôs the CIA ‚ÄúSir, two Chinese carrier groups just sailed from China and are headed to Taiwan - what should we do ?‚Äù .. expect this answer folks ..!
Biden won as a supposed moderate ... classic bait and switch.
In other words, an empty suit deeply entrenched in the establishment, that won't rock the boat. A female Biden, basically.
You left out telling a factory worker he was full of sh*t.
Breaking news!  Biden discovered hiding in Iraqi rat hole used by Saddam Hussein.  Former VP says DNC told him to keep quiet.
Breaking News!  Biden discovered in Iraqi rat hole used by Saddam Hussein - Former VP says DNC told him to stay there and be quiet.
makes him more progressive than he was. Links attached are worth a read.  In the end, we have to hold him to task the same we would any other prez. Keep pushing left.
I do that often -Joe Biden sponsored legislation to put a mandatory back door chip in every phone and computer in the USA.    S.266, was pushed by the then chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Joe Biden   De-cipher that one.
Trump would probably keep accidentally talking and somehow blame someone else for coloring outside the lines. On the other hand, Biden would forget what he was doing about five minutes in and then say something racist.
Not Biden.
Not only was Joe Biden not "alone" and "hiding." He had given up his seat to someone else.  Donald Trump won't even share his umbrella with his wife when it's raining.
Breaking NEWS!  Biden discovered in Iraqi rat hole used by Saddam Hussein.  Former VP says DNC put him there for his own good.
tRump will never debate Biden. He will come up with some bullshit it‚Äôs not fair excuse. Because tRump is no longer capable. These recent interviews prove that. Biden should continue to abide by the debate commission schedule, tRump will never show
The black men and women I know that voted for him either ran their own business or are into their church big time. Churches pushed their own agenda...abortion. Business owners thought they'd come into money. I'm thankful they will vote for Biden this fall.
Biden announces 280M ad buy.   I work in insurance with savvy marketing guys.   Don't underestimate quarantine impact on TV. People (elderly, home schoolers,.. ) are watching TV. We moved our ad budget.   #TeamTrump

Report and Block him
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
Amazing.  Finland, Prime minister and three of her cabinet members, all 32-35 years old.  In US, we have Trump and Biden 70 - 80 years old.  I think both US and Finland are too much extreme here for old / young leaders.  50 years- 60 years age are ideal.
IMHO... They can‚Äôt be serious about Biden.  They just can‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs gotta be a narrative for moderate Dems to follow, then they‚Äôll switch him out at the last minute.
Trump took a cognitive test and then didn‚Äôt say anything about it until the news leaked out. It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúto show the left he was competent‚Äù. It was because his own administration thought he was losing it. Biden doesn‚Äôt have that problem.
No!  I am 79, get a physical yearly and have never had a cognitive test. One should be applied if there is an indication you need one. Dr. Fauci is two years older than Biden. Does it appear he needs one?
No, I‚Äôve had just as many or more tell me that a vote for Jorgensen is a vote for Trump as those that have told me that a vote for Jorgensen is a vote for Biden.  When my vote for Jorgensen will... shocker... be a vote for.... wait for it...
Remember, you are not black if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden. His words, not mine.
Strange and somewhat sad exchange.  Obviously Joe Biden needs help.  The DNC needs to conduct an intervention to end this charade.
Strange exchange.  It's pretty obvious Joe Biden is no longer physically/mentally qualified to be the nominee. What will the DNC do now?  One huge problem!
This is just another Benghazi-style dog-and-pony show presided over by  to create a pretext to attack Joe Biden for the political benefit of
He is a joke. Just looking for publicity and to try and take bites away from Biden
Right, he says he just joined in March.  Smells bad.
If you honestly support Biden why are you trying to start a fight with other Biden supporters?
"I understand the point about not getting too overhyped about polling, but think about this for a second: Let's say Trump was LEADING in the polls and Biden's numbers were terrible. The talking points would be VERY different right about now."
Yet Trump is soooooo bad, we can accept these issues with Biden, just to get rid of Trump.
This is why you can‚Äôt trust headlines sometimes. Biden then asks a black interviewer if he‚Äôd been tested for cocaine and if he was a junkie. Then he claims he‚Äôs ‚Äúforward looking‚Äù to debating Trump.
I think it's a joke about RCP and CPUSA. The Revolutionary Communist Party leader (RCP) supports Biden, CPUSA does not
No. He should debate Trump. Not doing so would make him look Trumpian. Trump doesn't want to debate Biden either. Know that.
it‚Äôs always amazing to me how many ‚Äúreal people‚Äù never watch  or  when  talks and starts spewing lies in real time and can easily be fact checked.  Here is some homework.
Unfortunately Joe Biden's dementia is causing him to be crazy as a bat. This of course is what happens when one has this mental condition.
Somebody could write a book about Trump and defensive projection.  Nancy Pelosi is ‚Äúnervous‚Äù Joe Biden is ‚Äúlosing it‚Äù Obama is ‚Äúout of control‚Äù  Ok, pal...
Oh, wow. At first I thought you were a real doctor with some scruples.  Turns out you're just another rando political activist. You don't give a crap about children, you'll put them in danger just to get the Biden elected.  Gross.
Biden is mass transit, not a private car.   He takes us in the right direction but not all the way.

I see lots of posts where several folks are going to ‚Äúsettle for Biden, even though he is not the best pick‚Äù.   That is just like eating a huge turd üí© because you don‚Äôt like broccoli.  ü•¶
Yeah VP pick is just signalling. Well. I don't know about Biden actually, I'm not sure he could last 8 years.
Question - Have you taken a Covid test?  BIDEN: "No, I haven't taken a test. Why the hell would I take a test? C'mon man. That's like saying you, before you got in this program, if you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not, what do you think huh? Are you a junkie?"
Let me help you  This is Beau Biden. He joined the National Guard and did a year long tour in Iraq before dying of brain cancer in 2015. He served the nation with honor. Not a single person named Trump has ever worn the uniform. Not one. You have no honor either.
I‚Äôve been told by most that it‚Äôs a vote for trump and I can‚Äôt let trump win so I need to vote Biden.  So I guess my vote is magically worth three votes.  #endtheduopoly #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Isnt #Biden a worldwide product - based on $ parts from #Ukraine #China #Russia and .....
I think it's clear Joe Biden will not be the dem's candidate.
I suspect polling is showing a slight swing away from the Dems along the Fredericksburg to Chesterfield to Chesapeake corridor. Biden‚Äôs wise to shore this up, though I‚Äôd agree Virginia overall feels safe.Biden‚Äôs been a public figure for 48 years. I don‚Äôt think anyone needs to be ‚Äúintroduced‚Äù to him.
Why  via  I just want to know when heads of the people will roll at this treasonous WH meeting on Jan. 5, 2017 against Pres. Trump even before the inauguration. Biden, Obama, Yates, Comey, Rice are political criminals.
Biden said "Blacks have no diversity of opinion among themselves. Unlike Latinos who do.. And IF You Vote Red You Ain't Black.. Well, As a Diverse Black Man.. I say GFYS BIDEN! " We're Voting TRUMP!
I as an individual believes Joe. What he says is what he believes. I pity the fool who votes for Biden.
Who going VOTE for this mental ill. I been with Joe Biden From Day one.
Biden is an old washed up man no were Joe
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, letting yourself be used to spread Russian propaganda to taint our election. I used to have a modicum of respect for you. But you‚Äôve sold out like the rest if them. Your party is a pack of traitors.
Lol only thing working against biden is his dementia, child sniffing and racism towards blacks lmao
The only possible way to insure that Joe Biden is debating with no assistance is to have him appear live on the same debate stage as the President.
Don‚Äôt buy into the made for tv narrative that China wants Biden. You‚Äôre playing right into trumps hands. You‚Äôre better than that.
Is it worth it voting for Biden? Trump gone is a huge plus, the biggest issue I see is that the DNC will take it as a greenlight, now they know they have support even with the worst candidates.

I'll worry about China and Iran trying to influence the election when they send representatives to Biden Tower with dirt on Trump....  Or when Biden says "China if you are out there...."  Or when a close ally of Biden interacts with the Chinese Guccifer 2.0...

Biden is a devout Catholic and a gun owner
Ukraine is looking for Biden Pelosi Romney

Lol. Are you fuckjng kidding me. I'm suffering from low-grade Depression beacuse of Joe Biden running.
And yet, Biden's the "creepy" one.
I agree. Also, I think Biden should come out with his entire cabinet. Pete for sec of state, Kamala=DOJ
I agree Trump has done a good job at filtering his language in the last five years but has said and done enough in the last four to show he is racist.   And yes, Biden is also racist.   Two sides of the same coin.
If HRC could win VA in 2016, I can see NC swinging for Biden this time around.
This is key, there have been republicans who talk the talk, but either voted for Toupee Fiasco or didn‚Äôt vote at all. She actually voted FOR Hillary and is saying vote FOR Biden, not just AGAINST TF.  There‚Äôs a difference.

My kids are a millennial &amp;a zoomer;they cringe at Biden‚Äôs old school Come on man and malarkey schitck. Like  when he has cringe dialogue from the 50s like kiddo,zippidy doo,Daddy-O. No way Biden is getting that vote bc they think he is an old sinile grandpa

Interesting that Trump accuses Biden of being against god when his own mere existence and constant fuckery is evidence that he was not born of a woman, but from Satan's asshole itself.
Why does Joe Biden talk like this kid?
Ooo i love this new Biden ad.
I think we likely won‚Äôt agree, but I think Trump, like any good salesman, knows how to play to the crowd. His crowd at least. Racist? I‚Äôm not sure.  Biden is no saint or savior for anyone, and time will show he‚Äôs not mentally fit for the Oval Office. Racist? Similarly unsure.
No one cares.  Get back to contrasting Trump vs Biden on taxes and law and order.   Otherwise Biden wins.

Biden is weak, old, senile, scared, ineffectual yet he can do actual harm to a god.  Madness.
He really said "hurt the Bible".  What the hell does he think the Bible is, Tom Riddle's fucking diary? Is Biden gonna pull out a basilisk fang and jam it into a Bible, and it's gonna bleed ink everywhere? Is that what he's suggesting?  I'd like to see that.  What an IDIOT.

Stretching thin now aren't you? this whole thing started with comments from Biden who is running for president of America. And need I remind you it was 13 seconds of comments probably taken way out of context. Even so any kind of thought renders them innocuous.
That would make Biden incredibly powerful.  Interesting that Trump gives him so much credit.
All Biden has to do until November is let him talk...
Yeah, his thought process is that all he has to do is say something and his base will believe it, and if they think Biden is against religion they'll never vote for him. And notice he doesn't specify which religion, because Christianity is the only one in his world.

My point wasn't about slavery globally or throughout history just relative to America. Since Biden is not running for president of the universe, let's focus on America with regards to this conversation.
please explain, in excruciating detail, how Biden would assemble a constitutional convention, and strike the 2nd amendment.  We will wait
Don't count on that...the GOP is sponsoring him...they would not do that if they did not expect him to take voters from Biden.  When Kanye first announced, his feed lit up with people expressing support for him.
Yup!  It‚Äôs interesting to me how many people feel it will be great and things will be so much different than today if Biden wins.  I don‚Äôt have confidence in either party to ever put the people they represent first.
Biden has SUPERNATURAL POWERS and will hurt the almighty
And the leader of the GOP just called Biden the enemy of God.  It looks like there's no lower depth the GOP could stoop to in the presidential campaign, but there are *glances at calendar* about 90 lower depths waiting for us
Is Biden running for president of those countries?
Now that your leader has declared Joe Biden the enemy of God himself, are you taking up the sword of the crusader? And if not, why do you choose to facilitate the Antichrist as your leader has declared
Of course they don't and Biden shouldn't suggest otherwise. But most black neighborhoods vote 90+% D.  That may be the case in a few Latino neighborhoods but it isn't as widespread and it varies a lot by national origin.
I have an idea...in the Biden/Trump debate every time Trump says ‚Äúfake News‚Äù the audience yells ‚Äúthe truth‚Äù and takes a drink!
One reason Biden may be having trouble finding a running mate that can help him win: Out of black women in Congress, only 2 (Lucy McBath &amp; Lauren Underwood) come from competitive districts, and both were first elected just in 2018.
Exactly... which is why you calling Biden one is laughable. You aren't supposed to respond until you have that LeBron accountability quote. Still waiting.

Hillary will not be in the Biden Administration
Dude, I have no clue who wins it at this point. Trump has looked awful but Biden can‚Äôt form a coherent sentence.
joe biden trying to prove he‚Äôs not an old man by showing off his old man car that he can only legally operate on private property
WOW! Sean Hannity acknowledges that Sally Yates testimony today WAS CREDIBLE. That's great, because she also said...  ‚ñ™Obama, Biden &amp; Rice "did NOT in any way attempt to direct or influence any kind of investigation [into Flynn]"  ‚ñ™Russia helped Trump in 2016  ‚ñ™AND...üëáüëáüëá
Agree!  No tax returns from Trump = no debate with Biden!
I said Biden's handlers.  Biden at this stage is an empty shell you can pretty much fill with anything.  It won't be far left enough to the useful idiots burning their cities down. But you gotta boil the frogs at the right pace.  It's just a guess.
Ah yes, it‚Äôs about racism &amp; not a long history of policy/actions that has some people objecting to potential biden VPs.
. once said about Donald Trump "We're gonna impeach the mother fucker".  To all you #Resistance #KHive #BlueWave folks who were hoping she would lose her seat last night because you were bitter about her not endorsing Joe Biden: she's here to stay, so deal with it.
Joe Biden‚Äôs family isn‚Äôt running. Try harder.
Comotose Joe Biden, wake up time for your pill. Then will work on that enema.
Sorry folks, if comotose if comotose Joe Biden and the DNC steal this election, you better go buy guns and prepare for the end of this beautiful country. Please pray to God this does not happen.
Amazing that trump, Biden and Kanye are running and Biden is the one being asked about cognitive abilities
Can someone tell comotose Joe Biden that his term as senator is over and he can go home now.
Look at the POLITICAL SLAVES IN THE COMMENTS! Don't talk about MASSAH OR TRUMP WILL WIN..... FAR AS I'M CONCERN, 2020 CAN HAVE TRUMP &amp; BIDEN! That's what you all get for advancing the Lesser of 2 Evils theory instead of getting better choices
"Sources closest to Biden's campaign has confirmed that the reason for Biden's absence is due to the presumptive nominee not knowing where Milwaukee is at".  Kidding, but be funny if true.
He said ‚ÄúBarack Obama won‚Äôt be able to campaign for Joe Biden because he will be in prison.‚Äù
I got news for people, stuttering means you have a difficult time sometimes getting out a word, or phrase. Stutterers still make coherent statements. Please stop insulting stutterers by claiming that‚Äôs what Joe Biden‚Äôs problem is.
Does Joe Biden even know where Milwaukee is?
Good lord, stop the madness... please. Let's please not put this huge responsibility on this guy who is trying so hard. It just won't work... time to face reality. Against any other opponent or in a normal campaign, Biden would be out of the race long ago.
Biden is a racist.   It is sort of baked into  now.
For democracy's sake there needs to be debates, but Biden can run victory formation 3 times, take a knee and run out the clock. Donny T will self implode with or without debates...
May have to lay it out one of these days and see. I hope Biden wins, at the same time I hope Americans see him for who he is, and vote with that reality in mind.
Trust me.  There is only one person "left" in this exchange.  I would wager that you and I disagree on more than we agree on most issues, especially if you think Biden is strong on...anything progressive. He is a moderate republican, at best.
There are a lot of people who honestly believe all of the most powerful and well resourced/connected organizations in the world are involved in a pitched battle with trump and that Joe Biden is the best the could do to run against him
It may blow your mind, but the scenario where "we are fucked" could apply to both outcomes.  As you show the image of George Floyd, remember that Biden made it his political life's mission to lock up black kids, embolden violent cops, and keep black families out of the suburbs.
Those of us who know why Biden responded that way will probably vote for Biden. However a President needs to speak clearly and avoid snark and sarcasm. He asked a black reporter if they took a drug test. If that was Trump asking what would you think?  is better than that
Joe Rogan says Biden appears 'mentally compromised,' making voters 'uncomfortable'  #FoxNews
Biden ahead by any amount will benefit down ballot democrats.
Suggestions that he skip the debates are coming from pundits outside the campaign.  Biden has never wavered in his commitment to three televised debates.
If Trump loses, a resignation would be no value. Pence‚Äîif sworn in for 3 months could NOT pardon State crimes! And, he‚Äôd only be POTUS until Biden is sworn in. üë†
If Biden runs on his record he loses, so he runs on made up sh*t.
I hate guns and I‚Äôm voting for Biden.
People who take cognitive tests don't brag about it because if you take a cognitive test it means you're cognitive abilities are in question. Biden clearly felt like his cognitive abilities were in question and instead of responding gracefully...
Serious question for  supporters... why is it OK for Biden‚Äôs team interview on his behalf? You can‚Äôt say Covid, and cite the need for safety, but let Jill do an interview. It makes no sense. I would seriously like someone to try to explain it to me.
‚ÄòSign of desperation‚Äô: Trump slammed for ‚Äòanti-religious bigotry‚Äô over new attack ad on Joe Biden
In 48 years of public life Joe Biden has never been credibly accused of corruption.

Racist Virginia Mayor Compares Joe Biden‚Äôs Potential VP Pick To Aunt Jemima
Tucker Carlson says it's 'probably illegal' for Joe Biden to pick a Black woman as vice president
Tomorrow's corporate media talking points: - Cognitive tests are ageist.  - Biden critics are Russian bots sowing intergenerational division to divide American society.
Biden can't remember what state he's in have the time, can't wait for the debates, if Biden comes out of his basement.
Seriously?!? I'm not a Trump supporter but there is no response he could have made to save the economy. This is a insane argument and not a reason to support you Mr. Biden.
I can't pull the lever for neoliberalism again.  Joe Biden has been in the same place for 42 years.
Biden won‚Äôt travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination amid coronavirus concerns
If Biden wins, his unelected cabinet/handlers will be the primary decision makers.  And they will likely pursue a far left agenda. Just my sense of the situation.
The curve goes away when Biden gets inaugurated.
Watch  broadcast: "President Trump VS Joe Biden, Walls Closing in and Special Musical Guest Miguelifornja!" w/ Author Brenden Dilley #TheDilleyShow
Biden is using Covid as an excuse to hide. The Left is using Covid as a battering ram to hammer the Administration for a multitude of disastrous situations that they themselves caused.
Joe Biden won't go to Milwaukee for acceptance speech
I have not heard much of anything about the dumpster fire trump interview from Krystal Ball and Shaun King but retweets. As soon as Biden makes a gaff, it's the biggest thing since sliced bread and they get all critical mass about it. Jackasses.
I will be voting for Biden, and hope the wait will be shorter for you.
Joe Biden is a simple kind of stupid...
Pour a glass of the good stuff, sit back in your most comfortable chair, and enjoy the ride.
Just more proof that Biden is NOT WELL...
And my point is, the Democrats/those on the Left still want to hold Trump accountable for his past/current words/deeds, but want to give Biden a pass for his past/current words/deeds. That's blatant hypocrisy! Trump has been working with the black community, what has Biden done?
To be honest DJT shut the country down while nasty Nancy was in China Town looking foolish-DJT is damned if he does and damned if he doesn‚Äôt! I have seen so many pedo rings going down yet the media doesn‚Äôt care! Ukraine is looking for joe Biden zero from the MSM
Running mates will be super important in 2020.
Joe Biden does not want to debate Trump at all, but surely not until many or most people have voted by mail so they can't change their vote when they realize he is experiencing serious cognitive decline.
Democrats have no earthly idea how racist it is to insist that Joe Biden choose a running mate based upon Race. "We're not racist, we demand that all other races be *excluded* from consideration!" üôÑ
The final 2? Biden confidants see VP choices narrowing to Kamala Harris and Susan Rice
I get it, he didn‚Äôt bring his A game. The interviewer has apologized for an incorrect statement he made during the interview, so he didn‚Äôt bring his A game either. But have you seen the Biden interviews?

Nothing would show the Democratic commitment to minority empowerment better than Biden selecting Warren as a running mate. The first 1/1024th Native American to ever seek the office of Vice President. Soooo inspiring üòâ
Has the Biden team vetted Corn Pop? His being on the ticket as VP would send a strong message of diversity &amp; inclusion.  üòâ
Bahahaha are you on drugs?! Biden can‚Äôt even say a complete sentence without stumbling
The 'decline' of Joe Biden is overblown, he's never been remotely competent in his entire career.
It‚Äôs further proof that someone less informed than the (below) average person on the street is the U.S. President. It‚Äôs also relevant b/c the Trump campaign strategy is to attack Biden‚Äôs gaffes. This was worse than a gaffe. He had never seen or heard the word Yosemite before.
I can‚Äôt believe  is airing Biden commercials bashing  RIGHT BEFORE HE‚ÄôS ONE THE SHOW!! #really

Good lord, you are the worst of the cysts that popped off of Kelly Anne‚Äôs back. Let‚Äôs just assume the worst for your camp, Biden is carefully considering his VP pick, before you ding dongs get swept up. Leaving the WH fortress via helicopter does not equal bravery.

I told y‚Äôall that The whole purpose of Kanye was to take away Black Men from Biden.  They gave up on getting Black Women. And Toupee Fiasco wasn‚Äôt going to get votes as easy as he did from Black Men in 2016.  Kanye‚Äôs in hip hop &amp; Black Men will rally around him to give Biden 64%
There's a better chance of seeing a woodbooger than a Biden Trump debate.
Biden is not well...
Jill Biden on Dana Perino's show today: Joe will participate in all 3 debates.   Umm...Unless he is the doorman, I think I will believe that when I see it.  #Biden2020Loser
It‚Äôs done. He‚Äôs through. Joe Biden will become President and we will spend the next 2 decades rebuilding what he burned to the ground and beg forgiveness from our allies.
Trump on Lou Dobbs today, calling Biden "a puppet for the radical left" &amp; saying of their platform, "When you think about it, they're against oil &amp; gas, they're against guns &amp; I guess they're against God, okay? But they're against religion. They're against the Bible, certainly."
Who's doing this for you ,Dr. Jill Biden, why not she did a interview for you today.
If the Leftists and the Nevertrumper pseudo Conservatives don't want a Trump vs. Biden debate it's clear - they don't want you to know how incredibly incapable Feeble Joe is. They don't want you to see that Biden is unable, physically &amp; mentally, to be President. Biden is a fail.
We will need an executive order from Biden to do the census in 2021 ! No one will trust this Government with our information ! Are you kidding me Already? It won't happen !
If you're wondering how racist and desperate the GOP actually is, they believe a stunt like this is enough to split the vote of Black Americans away from Biden.
I love that a bunch of conservative commentators are saying Joe Biden is afraid to debate Donald Trump.  They're creating so much to throw in Donald's face when he refuses to debate.  He knows it's going to be a shitshow after his recent interviews üòÜ #TrumpMustDebateBidenLIVE
Drove all through his state and didn‚Äôt see a Biden sign in Delaware or Maryland, pedo joe is in deep shit just like Killary and billy boy.
Lol. Well there‚Äôs Biden.
I've noticed very few liberals are willing to admit that people will suffer even under a Biden administration. A lot of them sugar coat it, but if you dare say it then they lose their minds.
Biden is a centrist, respected on both sides of the aisle.
I agree that Bernie is a decent person . I like Bernie. Biden is also a decent person. I'm voting for him. Trump has got to go. Our very survival depends on it. You do what you feel. I'm not policing my tone to plead for your vote.
I trust the word of most every other world leader over the word of Biden's Opponent.
Yeah well guess what he sucked and Biden will too
One thing you have right NO he did nothing and where were you for those 8 years there was plunity going on the he decided to not act on how about Maryland how about Benghazi Obama and Biden did nothing for the American public but raise taxs and healthcare that sucked
Biden is plenty corporate friendly and always has been. And at the end of the day, the stock market ultimately doesn't care who the president is, anyways. It really doesn't matter, especially if you're a long term investor.
They got mad at Jamal for endorsing Biden AND being excited about Obama‚Äôs endorsement lol
Well it was a "winning" coalition. If anyone utterly failed it was Bernie. He had the money and the time. He hired an incompetent team and again failed to make his case to the Democratic base. Go be mad at him. I was not a Biden person, I wanted Warren. but she lost. I moved on.
Kamala Harris has put away so many black and brown people behind bars for many years and she Biden‚Äôs vp idk shit bout politics but ok...
Especially this time with Biden's advanced age
Simply do not understand why Trump, his falsehoods &amp; ugliness are covered daily in prime time? He ruins space for normal good programming.  If he ever says anything important, the networks can excerpt that portion &amp; show later. Why does Trump get this time when Biden doesn‚Äôt? üë†
Facebook removes pro-Trump ad aimed at Joe Biden, claiming false information  #FoxNews They'll take down a pro-Trump add but let all else false run thru.
My vote goes to Biden.
That‚Äôs one of the top reasons Biden has to win!!!
#SettleWithBiden is such an apt description that perfectly sums up people's callous behavior about this fucking situation we're in: "There's still going to be suffering and death, but we'll settle for less of that with Biden". I long for a system that helps everyone. Full Stop.
I wish you hadn‚Äôt suggested Biden skip the debates. They‚Äôre making a huge deal about it on Fox. It fits in with their ‚Äúhiding in the basement‚Äù schtick. Don‚Äôt feed the beast.
I've said it before and I'll say it again. There's very few who are willing to admit that there's still going to be people suffering in Joe Biden's administration. It's now only a matter of how many will suffer is what drives their decision. Why does it always lead to suffering?
You have that right!  That's why we cannot elect Biden.  #Trump2020Landslide
Criticize my politics all you want. (You don't really know them, but go nuts)  Why should you vote for Biden? We need a massive Federal response to Covid to save lives and save the country. There is an answer.
I didn't blame you when Trump beat Hillary. So fuck right off with that.   I didn't pick Biden, but Biden is who we got. Because I'm a fucking grown up, I'm doing what I can to see Trump beaten. Sit out. I don't care. It does not surprise me.
Surely biden will keep HIS billionaire friends in check, right Bernie?
Starting in on the Joe Biden/Barack Obama mystery novel reading on  If  needs more awful political fiction, can I recommend Liberality For All? It's somewhat dated, but it stars Sean Hannity as an underground resistance cyborg, so...

tRump can‚Äôt hold a press conference without slurring his words or mispronouncing words. He has a limited vocabulary. I‚Äôll take Vice President Biden all day every day even if he stutters.
There is nothing "bi-partisan" or "non-partisan" about supporting the notion of Joe Biden refusing to debate the President. It's merely Leftists and others with #TDS who are afraid to have the American people see who is running in this election. They're afraid.
I'm going to hold Joe Biden's feet to the fire and demand better from him, because I don't care if he thinks healthcare is only a privilege, it's a human right. I'm not going to simply bow my head and accept bread crumbs. We demand better policies from him. What about you?
Given the fact he has said he has no empathy for the younger generation and that nothing will fundamentally change, of fucking course I'm going to demand better from Joe Biden. I need to know what he's going to do if he become president. Is that too much to ask?
By the way, just so we're clear, because a lot of you believe I find the alternative better, I don't want Trump to win. Period. End of story. I just want Biden to do better and not leave us behind and neglect us. We deserve healthcare even if we have no job. We're in a pandemic.
I'm worried about Joe Biden vetoing Medicare For All like he said he would, and any compromise on a healthcare system will still leave millions like me without health insurance even in a pandemic. I'm demanding better for Joe Biden, and here I am being reprimanded for it.
I agree. Compared to Trump, it's a slight shift to the left. I just find it frustrating that we're going to have to beg for Joe Biden to move slightly more to the left on healthcare since he doesn't believe in a single payer system when every other nation has it.
There‚Äôs better videos where you can actually see the fireworks going off after the first explosion before the second.
It‚Äôs all the same place. A fireworks warehouse caught fire, then move to a nitrate warehouse next to it. That was the second large blast. Not bombings.
Went through it with my father in law. Biden does not have dementia. He had slowed down but I‚Äôm confident he will hire good people which is more than I can say for Trump: family members and donors
Read a nitrate warehouse was next to fireworks warehouse. That was the second blast.
Reading it move from fireworks warehouse to nitrate warehouse. That was the second blast.
Because you have some one (biden) that will not be able to answer the questions.
Obama and Biden aren‚Äôt the ones saying they‚Äôve done more for Black Americans than anyone else.
Trump appears to blame Obama for lack of coronavirus tests and says US deaths 'lower than the world' - follow live
If anyone can say Biden has a cognitive decline and look at this Trump Axios video and see this crazy guy talk and support him it's on you this guy is living in another world
You didn't even vote for him. When you grow up you can vote like an adult. Yeah, make your 1st vote for Biden. Kill some more babies!
Tells us all we need to know. Biden is not mentally fit and the Dems know it.
Well, that‚Äôs what plagiarists do, you know it and I know it. I don‚Äôt understand why people just don‚Äôt vote for Trump, Biden‚Äôs running on his platform.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  #MAGA2020

This gives me some hope that there will be at least someone in Congress who will stand up against a Joe Biden administration.  is one of those few I trust these days.
Okay so, Barack is driving the Escalade, which means Biden is shotgun. They establish earlier that the bad knee is Biden's left. So for Barack to pat "the good one" he would have had to reach all the way across Biden's lap, while driving an Escalade.

Be patient with Joe Biden while he makes his VP pick. That's 8 different heads to sniff, which is difficult with social distancing protocols.
I'm not Joe Biden's Doctor, so I don't know *what* his diagnosis is. But, I have two eyes and two ears and many years of experience in observing the human condition. Something is *wrong*.
If Biden doesn't win, a Million Americans will die of Covid and the economy will collapse. Sooooo Ill take my chances with Biden.
DNC? You mean Black people? The Black people that voted for Biden and not Bernie?
You may want to broaden your information diet.  "Shy voters" are a thing, especially in 2020.
Nobody is debating the pros &amp; cons of Biden's Policy Platform because nobody knows he even has one. Everyone sees this election as President Trump vs. Leftists in The House &amp; Senate and Biden is just a useful idiot.
Biden has no legitimate reason to not debate President Trump. He can't claim "safety" - he can stay in his basement. He can't claim "health", that's an admission that he's weak. He can't claim that the President doesn't merit a debate, Trump is The President! Of course he does.
Biden approved!
What has Donald tRump done to warrant sharing a debate stage with Joe Biden?
Grasping at straws!  If Donald Trump is lying, and if Joe Biden is presidential, he should be able to confront him.  Isn't that what debates are?
We talk about Beyonce's stunning visual album Black is King, The NBA, Biden's Angels and what can Black children grow up to be....
Me: Hey, I'm worried about Joe Biden's plan, or lack of, aside from defeating Trump in November. Where do we go from there?  Centrists: How dare you ask questions. Are you serious? Are you stupid? Have you been living under a rock? Just be silent and bow your head. You lost.  üôÑ
I mean, what's the point.  Its not like your dad has nothing important to say.  He never does.  Besides, after his creeping around in the background behind Clinton, we just assume your dad is gonna keep trying to cough on Biden and we love Joe too much to subject him to that.
I didn‚Äôt think simply asking for Biden‚Äôs plan would generate such anger and frustration. Forgive me for asking and not simply being quiet and do as I‚Äôm told. I‚Äôm just asking for guidance in this dark time.
I think asking for Biden‚Äôs plans after he wins is not so much to ask for, but apparently it‚Äôs taboo for some. I‚Äôm just worried Biden won‚Äôt do anything in terms of healthcare even in a pandemic. He still thinks healthcare should be tied to employment.
I have been living, thankfully. Despite my depression for all these last 4 years I‚Äôm still living. Bernie gave me hope, but Biden won and doesn‚Äôt believe in the things Bernie fought for like a single payer system. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll still struggle to have healthcare under Biden.
I didn‚Äôt think asking for Biden‚Äôs plan after we defeat Trump was too much to ask for, but I guess it is for some. I‚Äôm just worried about it having healthcare for 4 more years under Biden. I didn‚Äôt think asking what he would do would generate anger by some.
So hope and pray he nudges a inch to the left on healthcare and has a conscience and doesn‚Äôt veto single payer legislation. Seems like a valid plan. I just hate seeing people suffer while we try to force Biden to do what‚Äôs right in a pandemic.
I didn‚Äôt say I wanted Trump. All I‚Äôm asking is Biden‚Äôs plan for helping us who are struggling and at best all I‚Äôve gotten was ‚Äúadd to the ACA‚Äù. So not changing much. So it‚Äôs back to still be worried about getting sick. I didn‚Äôt think asking for his plan would be so divisive.
Biden and Hunter are going to jail. That‚Äôs why.
Asking what would happen next after Trump is defeated and Biden is elected was rather eye opening. I was mostly scorn by centrists for being worried I would still be without healthcare for 4 more years. It‚Äôs almost like asking what plan Biden has is taboo for his supporters.
Yes President Biden put out a lovely statement. The orange one went golfing. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Oh good.....someone who SOUNDS like a president. Thank you President Biden!!!!!!
This is effectively a 37 minute ad for Biden 2020.   I got to wonder how inept Trump's handlers are that they even went ahead with it
OH HEEEELL NO!! üëéüèæ
Trump likes women, no doubt. There is absolutely nothing to make anyone think he is a pedeophile. Biden's videos of touching and sniffing little girls are everywhere. That is not normal with perfect strangers.
"We're lower than the world" - well it's impossible for them to be higher! Jesus christ. And his supporters have the gall to call Biden senile.
#Metoo #Ellen #CancelEllen NO WAY NO PLAY! #epstein #Biden #PedoIsland
all Biden has to do is say his name and speak in complete sentences to win the debate and it will be the Trump's campaign's fault that they set the expectations so low for him.
I don't know what will happen if Biden wins other than "not being in a dictatorship" from what moderates have told me in the past few hours. I fear nothing will change with Biden, and things will worsen with Trump. I hate this nightmare and I want it to end.
So, yes, I'm fully aware of what's happening. I lose sleep over the possibility of getting sick and not having health insurance. I'm worried Biden's healthcare plan will still leave millions like me without healthcare even in the middle of a deadly pandemic.
Agreed to all of those. I'm worried Biden won't do much to help us in this pandemic. I'm w/o a job and have no insurance. It's hard to find a job that doesn't put my loved ones at risk with underlining health problems. He still believes healthcare should be tied to employment.
46 Minutes Of Joe Biden Talking Nonsense  via  Best video ever.             please  retweet
I'm muting this thread. I appreciate those who gave their reasons, reached out and explained it to me. I do hope things will be better soon. I just want people to have healthcare because I believe healthcare is a human right, even if Biden doesn't believe it.
That's what drew me to Bernie. He knew those lobbyists have shaped the political system into what it is, but sadly we're still stuck in it with either Trump or Biden. It's only a matter of damage reduction, which is another argument I hear being made for the case for Biden.
I'm well aware of that and others have said the same. Part of what drew me to Bernie was he knew drastic changes were needed in this chaotic and ever changing time. I worry Biden won't do anything to meet those challenges head on, but sadly that's the only choice I'm left with.
True. Which is why I'm worried Biden won't do much to help us weather this storm that is COVID since he's merely "adding" to the current system we have, which will not help those struggling to find a job and have insurance. But you're right, it's better than the alternative.
I understand that. I only wish his healthcare proposal was more adequate to meet the needs of those suffering in this pandemic, because who knows how long this will last even after Biden wins. Better that than the "alternative". Thanks for your input.
Thank you for those who answered me in earnest. I have some sense of what's to come after Biden is elected. It's just a shame people will continue to die by the time Biden is pushed just a little further to the left on issues like healthcare.
Well, I do appreciate your bluntness &amp; honesty. Not a lot are willing to admit people will still suffer under a Biden administration, but that is still worth removing Trump just so we can make incremental steps during a deadly and ever changing pandemic. Thank you
It would be. I'd also rest easy knowing I'd have a president who believes we deserve to have healthcare that isn't tied to our employment even in the middle of a deadly pandemic. That's something I hope for in Biden, but sadly he's hostile to that idea.
I want to put the fire out, and I also want to know how we're going to rebuild once we put it out. I believe it's a reasonable thing to ask for since Biden has once said "Nothing will fundamentally change". I want to avoid those beginnings so we won't meet those ends.
My worry is even if Biden wins and he's able to make these small incremental changes, I'm afraid people will still suffer because they're unable to have health coverage b/c they can't afford it. Trust me, I want to defeat Trump. I want to know where we go from there afterwards.
I'm not interested in what-ifs because Biden is the nominee.
Tucker: ‚ÄòProbably Illegal‚Äô for Biden to Only Consider a Black Woman VP  via
Okay, so we remove Trump. And then what? What is Joe Biden going to do after he becomes president? What is he going to do to help us not have to lose sleep over getting sick and become financially ruined because we don't have health insurance?
I'm without a job and I can't work outside from home because I'm living with loved ones who have underlining health conditions. It's extremely difficult to find remote work and have employer based health insurance. What is Biden going to do to address that?
I'm not. I'm simply asking what else are Joe Biden's plans besides removing Trump? What are his plans to help families struggling to pay for healthcare because they can't work or find work because we're in a deadly pandemic?
So, a list of things Biden won't do, but there's not much of anything Biden WILL do if he becomes president? Nothing on helping our families and the most vulnerable? No  changes to help us in this pandemic?
I don't know... I think this tweet is more anti-Trump than it has anything to do with Biden.
Hooboy. Let me get this straight:  Biden, a neoliberal, died-in-the-wool CENTRIST, CORPORATE DEMOCRAT, borderline conservative political candidate who says he would defund the police, is running as the most extreme left-wing candidate in history?  LOL ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Totally agree if Biden wins that he doesn‚Äôt finish his term.
Gotta love Biden Bros telling undecided voters they're stupid and they don't care. Hey  will you denounce your toxic supporters?
It's another round of Right failing the basic expectation setting game. They are erecting a strawman when Biden already agreed to the usual 3 round debate.
For someone telling me to "adult now", you're very childish for not doing something as simple as telling one plan Joe Biden has.
Is it too much to ask a single plan in Joe Biden's first 100 days as president? It should be simple enough.
What is Joe Biden going to do after he becomes president. Just name me one fucking thing.
I am not a doctor, BUT, it is absolutely crystal clear that all is not well with Joe Biden... üòê
Oh. And you‚Äôre not black if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden.
I just wish a single Biden supporter would tell me what his plans are after he becomes president. So far, it's only "defeating Trump" and that's it. No plans. No fundamental changes. Nothing for 4 more years.
I've yet to hear from a single Joe Biden supporter about his plans after defeating Trump. What comes after Biden is inaugurated? What are Biden's goals in his first 100 days? The only thing I know from his own mouth is no fundamental changes.
Let‚Äôs Scrap the Presidential Debates
All these plans you claim Joe Biden has, yet you can't name a single one. If you struggle to give me an elevator pitch on Joe Biden other than defeating Trump, then just admit that he has no plan.
Biden would not be able to debate The President.
dont snifff panties wait wait wait i thought i was Joe Biden for a second there
COVID= economy-destroying attempt to influence the election. Your kids can't go to school so you have maximum difficulty working IF your company is allowed to be open.  No Trump rallies to show support is huge, Biden won't have to travel or debate and  a mail-in rigged election.
It is really a matter of lesser evils. I know what Trump is like and don't want another 4 years. I am willing to give Biden his chance. Would I prefer a better option? Yes I would.
What?! I didn‚Äôt say that. Biden has the most experience of anyone! Trump is an unqualified, unfit baffling. I said that his VP needs to be experienced enough to take over if required.
What happens after we defeat Trump? What's Biden going to do? Is he going to do what's right and champion your causes? Or is he going to hoodwink us like Obama did before him and nothing happens for 4 more years?
Okay. We defeat Trump. Then what? What is Biden going to do afterwards?
Joe Biden is bad choice for the Democratic Party. Just my opinion.
I'm still donations I been with Joe Biden From Day one,People Stop being Selfish.
Biden doesn‚Äôt know who they are
Hey didn't mean you I was referring to the person I originally started posting to cause of his stupid post about Biden. So sorry you misunderstood me.
Biden is suffering from dementia and the Demonrats know it. He seems to be declining rapidly. He is incapable of completing a sntence while reading a teleprompter let alone debate
He started at 70. Biden will start at 78. That‚Äôs a pretty big difference.
Biden ain‚Äôt going to make it to November as a candidate.
Except that gray will lead to millions of people still uninsured and without access to healthcare. That gray will lead to endless suffering unless Biden does the right thing and supports a single payer system.
Poor Joe Biden, can‚Äôt think, can‚Äôt make sense when he speaks, definitely can‚Äôt handle press conference questions, why would you ever want him to attend a debate let alone participate in one? Joe is toast and you know it! Lol
Naturally...
Biden campaign says it has agreed to debates already, but Trump camp has not  #FoxNews What with his build, back better comment?  He's copying Trump (MAGA).  Same thing!

I think Kampala Harris May be too strong of a vp for Biden. I see her running things instead of him.
The problem with Biden's skipping the debates is that it tends to reinforce the common conception of him as frail. Still, showing up would be very risky.
Why would Biden supporters come out to see you and the half dozen fawning people on the roadside?
So Biden was accused 1 time and story was changed and she refused to go record about it. At worst Biden has a problem with people's personal space. Trump has been accused 16 TIMES of sexual misconduct. Hmmmm!!!!!!
Facts First: Biden officially committed to participating in the three scheduled presidential debates -- and Biden has repeatedly said he is eager to debate Trump even if the pandemic forces them to hold the event online rather than in person.
Biden will be viewed as a coward if he does not debate President Trump!!! President Trump should show up to debate and show an empty Biden podium!!!üôèüòÇüòÇüòÅ
If you don't believe the Polls that have Biden winning, you shouldn't believe the Polls that show Biden losing. How do you know which Poll is the "accurate" one? You don't. Polls are meaningless. The Polls had Hillary winning, even on the day of the election. Remember? ü§î
Close, but the last one should read ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs shut down until Biden wins.‚Äù
It was a US POLICY at that time &amp; Biden was following policy. Trump went against Congress‚Äô by withholding $ for Ukraine. There was no policy in place to do that - he did it arbitrarily for personal gain.
So a young man, working for his father in the 1970's, gets sued for policies his father sets &amp; you want to call him a racist? That is what you want to stand on? Yet everyone wants to give Biden a pass for his past and present racism.
Let‚Äôs Scrap the Presidential Debates
At this point, Joe Biden doesn't know what he wants.  Maybe he never really did.
Pardon my saying so, but right now any Democratic Party threat to retaliate is toothless. All the fight have been able to muster is a few growls and snarls from Nancy Pelosi and the microphone-mad Chuck Schumer. Even Biden is mumbling about "across the aisle" cooperation. Hot air

But, again, I don't underestimate the desperation of the American people. So much lives have been taken away needlessly and families are struggling. I don't begrudge them to do what it takes to vote for Biden no questions asked. This is no ordinary election year.

No matter who Biden's VP pick is going to be, it won't favor progressives. They'll never reach out to us and we'll be left out yet again. Don't be shocked when it happens.
Word has it because Joe Biden did such a great job as Obama's VP ... Joe Biden is going to pick Joe Biden to be his running mate. #StupidIsAsStupidDoes
I want a do over please vote biden 2020
It'll stick, because that won't be the narrative pushed by Fox and others. They will continue their asinine campaign strategy of painting Biden as an "extreme leftist socialist", that lands with nobody outside of his psychotic base.
I can hear it now ... "You know, Joe Biden did a heck of a job under Obama. With that said, I'm picking Joe Biden as my running mate and together, we will win in January." #StupidIsAsStupidDoes
Wow! This is a dangerous man! Our Americans must get back our respect‚Äô we as Americans deserves a leadership!! Vote biden  2020
Joe Biden may as well select the Tooth Fairy as a running mate. If more Democrat controlled States allow mail-in cheating, he'll be elected regardless. Guaranteed.
Exactly. He thinks if we hide the virus it'll go away and not spread to an infantessimal degree. Its baffling. With biden being biden he could have slept his way through November if he just shut the fuck up
I dont speak on politics often but however you feel about trump, he could have easily won in November with the independent vote if he simply shut the fuck up and didnt act like a belligerent baby on a regular basis. Itll cost him in November. Biden is still another dumpster fire.
Sir, the people I‚Äôm talking to here in Chicago are not concerned about the virus.  The people are not even being clean here.   They are talking about Biden being a joke and asking who the REAL CANDIDATE is.  Chicago Loves Trump. I see no Biden signs.

I know some people will disagree, and I understand, but Jo Jorgensen is not part of the national conversation with regard to the election. A vote against Biden is a vote for Trump.
so is TRUMP and BIDEN. why aren't they part of that hashtag too ?
umm so is Trump and Biden. your point ?

when asked what him and Ivanka have in common he replied sex and in another interview he said he'd date her. if that doesn't scream id bang my own daughter. man.... stop trying to save him. he is a sexual predator admitted out of his own mouth. so is Biden

Biden with the football?
You are really right. Biden and Hunter sold their souls to Ukraine
Agreed, but still. Biden with the football?
Of course, I thought Obama should have lost (both times), but I understood why he didn't. Having said that, I cannot believe that a majority of our Nation wants to elect Biden. Yes, many hate Trump. Yes, many are committed Democrats. But, Biden? Really? I don't see it. I don't.üòê
I honestly would vote for anyone else. Not a big fan of Biden. But I am fighting a repeat of 2016. That's just honesty. I won't vote for trump. Period. We have bad politicians, and good politicians. Then we have trump. And he's not my guy.
I don't have to like Biden. And my party isn't going say that I'm not a real Democrat (which I'm not, actually) because I preferred someone else. Do you know why? Because this loyalty to ONE man is what they do in dictatorships and monarchies. NOT democracies.
This country has some serious issues. I'm not sure if anyone can deter the present course of insanity, including Biden.

Yeah, the people saying that to the DNC that are zealots, ignorant, and too far gone.  I'm voting for Biden - that much is clear. Not because I want to, but because I feel obligated to (and the previously mentioned reason as well).  We need new leadership.
Like if you‚Äôre voting for Biden. Comment if you‚Äôre voting for Trump. #RepublicansForBiden
Of course not, but it did play a factor in it. Bernie's campaign wasn't as aggressive as it could have been. They were far too nice towards Biden as well.   People just weren't ready for what Sanders proposed. He was ahead of his time.
The only reason why I'm voting for Biden is in the hopes he fixes the immigration policies so my gf can have an easier time getting back here at a later date.  Biden can suck a dick for all I care. At least he's playing it smart and staying in his basement while Trump flounders.

This is why we must vote for Biden 2020 because of this cramp you put out!! Disgusting ! November 3 will stay‚úùÔ∏èüôèüèæ
This is true and I'm a being a butt-hurt crybaby about it;however, you're right in that it wasn't cheating - it's politics. That *was* the smart thing to do and Biden benefited from it.  Biden is a shitty candidate and I'll always criticize/scrutinize him for it, too.
As much as I fucking hate it, Bernie lost. He only lost because Biden and the other corporate democrats voltron'd into a big ass centrist conglomerate with MSNBC and CNN behind them.   Bernie was ahead of his time, unfortunately.
I know I've shared this countless times, but I'm going to keep sharing it because I haven't gotten over this and I still won't get over this. I can never get over Joe Biden turning his backs on immigrants who are fearful that they'll be deported under his administration.
It must be galling that the only way Biden can lose the election for sure is picking  as VP.
Obama picked Biden on August 23rd 2008 without a pandemic making it harder to vet people. Was he indecisive? Seemed to have worked well for him.
There were no curveballs. I bet the interview with Biden would be the same way!
To be honest, I don't know. My home state of Virginia has always had relatively close margins. Biden had no ground game here during the primary. I'm disgusted with the "choice" I'm left with. I'm at a loss and I feel like I'm stuck in a corner with nowhere to go.
Let's be real, would any of you be surprised if George W Bush spoke at the DNC this year for Joe Biden?
Biden don't have the charisma to have outshine President Obama.
Karen Bass is very impressive but that Scientology speech is a bridge to far.Susan Rice would be a better VP of the 3 but she has a lot of baggage.Kamala Harris is the safer pick in my opinion so I think Biden should choose her as his VP.
We are on a cross country trip right now.  I have not seen a single Biden sign.  I have seen many Trump signs.  Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and South Dakota so far.
I think Biden in on this list bc I've written on his posts saying he needs to do better to give a shit about us and not abandon us, even if it's a fruitless effort. But this is a pretty accurate list of folks I interact with here on Twitter. Give them a follow! Except for Biden.

Biden can choose a leaky fireplug for all I care. He still has my vote just so we can be rid of Donald Trump and his mob of murderers and thieves.
I am confident Biden will consider all angles and prayerfully select the individual our nation needs. She will be tasked to serve ALL the people.

One Biden sign in my largely liberal neighborhood. Two Trump signs (soon to be 3 when mine comes in), several American flags, and 3 Thin Blue Line American flags.
I'm going to go on record right now that mainstream media will declare Biden the winner by 4pm that day.
Biden can ‚Äúdebate‚Äù Trump w/out appearing with him on a stage.  Trump has provided plenty of ammunition throughout his lifetime to confront Trump with w/out his attempts to manipulate the discussion on live tv.

Joe Biden just seems to get worse and worse as the race goes on and nobody even notices cuz he's barely on air
The spin continues.  The Dems are terrified of trump because he doesn't play their political shell game with the public. They fully know that Biden is toast if he even attemps to go head to head with President Trump.
OMG!  And Biden thinks he can run the country even though he can‚Äôt even make a sensible statement!!
Biden abt to throw us a curve ball,I believe he's having second thoughts on picking Kamala Harris.I wouldn't be surprised if he selects  longer this drags out it won't be good news for Kamala and the #KHive

I think everything comes down to how we vote. If mail in is allowed Biden wins unless massive fraud is found and Trump challenges the outcome. If in-person is utilized Trump wins.

Good point.  Scientology by most people here in the states is looked on like a cult.  I don't think that info about Bass would be helpful to Biden at all.  Bring her on!!  All his options for VP have bad faults.

anybody that votes for Joe Biden has brain damage  naturally the same is true for those that vote for Trump
Republicans are planning a mass attack against Biden using information from pro-Russian agents
I see TWO ways of Trump losing in November, obviously the first way is a Biden victory, but the other is a bit complicated as it heavily depends on who controls the Senate. Should Trump win re-election but lose the Senate to the Democrats, they could impeach AND remove him.
I‚Äôm sure she does, and with Joe Biden‚Äòs current state of mind, he probably doesn‚Äôt even know he should be afraid of being Arkansidedü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Kamala #Harris is half Indian (India). Couldn't Biden find someone "more black" whose family background doesn't include owning slaves on their Jamaican plantation? Seems like a conflict of interests.
Just name Kamala Harris as VP and get this over with. We're fucked anyways. It's not like anyone else Biden picks will be anywhere remotely better. They'll ignore and abandon progressives all the same.

Biden is looking forward to the debates. If anyone were to drop out, it would be Trump.
He probably will. Never underestimate the desperation of the American people. It happened in 2016 and it favored Trump. It could very well flip over to Biden this time around considering everything going on. I could be wrong though.
do you guys realize we don‚Äôt even like Biden either. We hate Trump and Biden is not even our top 10 choices. But he is what we are left with.

I've not gone into depth on any of them. I have faith in biden picking a good running mate.   My preference is Duckworth, but I'm open for any of them.
We shall see,but if Biden doesn't pick a black woman I wouldn't blame them for staying home when it was black women who resurrected his campaign.And there all  qualify in my opinion.
The VP pick has been delayed until August 10th because of the new revelation about Kamala Harris NDA settlement and Karen Bass  Scientology speech.This is Biden's campaign letting you all know that a black woman won't be chosen.Where is  ?

Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate
1. Vindman is a butthurt bureaucrat.  2. There will never be a Biden administration.
I've wanted Tammy to be president since I saw her speech at the DNC.  I think a single term as VP would be a great springboard to POTUS, we all know Biden serves one term to get us past Trump and to something more progressive.
I agree Mr Wright.  Trump SHOULD resign.   However he better run to Russia before the state of New York indicts him for tax crimes and the upcoming Biden DoJ uncovers the true depth of his crimes.
I don't think it's going to be a black woman at all.Biden has delayed his pick until August 10th because of the late breaking news abt Kamala's NDA settlement 10 years ago.
You act like Biden is President Obama or President Bill Clinton this campaign needs energy behind it.
Your analysis makes no sense,I voting for Biden because Trump is unfit but I'm not overly excited about him just being honest.
I will not follow anyone who pledges to vote for Biden
Don't believe the polls,this election will come down to 6 or 7 states.And it will be close.Biden is not what I would call inspiring.He needs to galvanized the most loyal part of the democratic base and that would be black women.
Or how about when Nancy Pelosi, Biden, and numerous media outlets called his travel restrictions xenophobic when he implemented them back in JANUARY.
The Bernie crew see this as their last chance to push their agenda even though Biden adopted some of their proposals. No sense of compromise. So glad the Dems aren‚Äôt having a large in-person convention. You know they would have acted up worst than they did  the 2016 convention.
Dont forget what Joe Biden said... ‚Äú we have a crimate clisis.‚Äù
You are not helping the country by constantly showing your hate &amp; resentment to Trump who you served &amp; shouldshow some allegiance. I thought you were against putting out books against a sitting president, treasonous act. Biden for president, really?
I have to laugh  at all the ink wasted on discussing which of Biden‚Äôs VP candidates is well-qualified when the Republican standard-bearer was the virtually unknown Governor of Alaska whose only foreign policy experience was that she could ‚Äúsee‚Äù Russia from her back yard.
But yeah let's investigate Hunter Biden lol
Yup because Obama is a man. Country isn‚Äôt ready for a women to be president sadly. That‚Äôs why Biden is doing so well
Once the White House  is fumigated Biden will move in. So get ready to bail pops out.
Please make your voice heard! I don‚Äôt have that kind of voice to let the Biden staff know that Kamala has our support. Please speak for us! Thank you! #Resist #Biden2020
I was looking for something else, and somehow came across this. Yikes, this didn‚Äôt age well. I‚Äôm not a Biden fan AT ALL. Dude is a senile zombie, but he‚Äôs gonna win. That is, of course IF we even have an election. Probably we will. Hopefully
People forget how completely disastrous an "Obama Endorsement" can be. Democrats got CRUSHED during his 8 years. He can't deliver a pizza. Nobody will be voting Biden because of Obama. They have other reasons - Pelosi &amp; Schumer.
Kamala Harris is known for her many convictions of black people as AJ of CA. She's also known for her "on the knees" job skills to get ahead.  As a Trump supporter I couldn't be happier if she is Biden's pick.   #Trump2020Victory
No guys, I'm not dead. I'm just not happy about 2020. By the time December 31st rolls along, I need a HUGE reset, so I can start 2021 on a good note.  I literally want Joe Biden to annihilate Trump by November 3rd, so us Americans can go back to normal. I want the RONA vaccine.
Voting third party helps trump. Every vote counts this election voting third party instead of Biden is not the way the way to go. I'm voting Biden to get trump out.
Trump was also talking about the fact Obama gave what sounded to be a campaign speech at John Lewis' funeral. It was disgusting.  He is working hard for Biden now as he did for Hillary in 2016. Obvious Trump was not confused in what he said.
I agree.  Anyone who thinks Biden is fit to be president shouldn't be allowed to vote.  LMAO
Don't you understand only the black women are being attacked because one of them will be Biden's choice?  He said so.  It's not a racial thing at all.  I don't like any of his choices, black or white.
Biden is leading in the polls he doesn't need to make a risky pick by choosing Karen Bass.And eventhough I feel like Susan Rice would be the better VP pick she has baggage also.Kamala is the safer pick,my gut tells me Biden should pick her as his VP.
She's to risky I saw her this morning on the  and even though she was very knowledgeable and came across as very genuine,Biden should go with the safer pick and in my opinion that's Kamala Harris.
I just donated to Joe Biden's campaign üòù
If JFK can pick LBJ who was far more abrasive to JFK in the primaries than Harris ever was to Biden, Harris should be the pick. Eff Dodd and Eff Rendell. They are playing by 1970s rules.

Hunter Biden made millions from Chinese coal while his dad helped decimate coal in the USA... shh, don‚Äôt tell anyone
Great activist? Maybe. But he let the district he ran go to hell, didn‚Äôt do much for the people who lived there. Took huge donations even when he ran unopposed and supported people like Biden when he railed against desegregation and busing .
I‚Äôm confused. I thought liberals LOVED taxing the rich. Biden said his economic plan would be paid for in part by taxing the WEALTHY.

Uncontrolled pandemic, rogue Federal agents, unemployment and no health insurance , violence by white supremacists.. In Biden's America the main cause of all of this will be in prison.Biden‚Äôs been a public figure for 48 years. I don‚Äôt think anyone needs to be ‚Äúintroduced‚Äù to him.
Why  via  I just want to know when heads of the people will roll at this treasonous WH meeting on Jan. 5, 2017 against Pres. Trump even before the inauguration. Biden, Obama, Yates, Comey, Rice are political criminals.
I as an individual believes Joe. What he says is what he believes. I pity the fool who votes for Biden.
Who going VOTE for this mental ill. I been with Joe Biden From Day one.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, letting yourself be used to spread Russian propaganda to taint our election. I used to have a modicum of respect for you. But you‚Äôve sold out like the rest if them. Your party is a pack of traitors.
Don‚Äôt buy into the made for tv narrative that China wants Biden. You‚Äôre playing right into trumps hands. You‚Äôre better than that.

I'll worry about China and Iran trying to influence the election when they send representatives to Biden Tower with dirt on Trump....  Or when Biden says "China if you are out there...."  Or when a close ally of Biden interacts with the Chinese Guccifer 2.0...
VP Biden, I have no issues with your statement about the Latino community versus the black community, and intelligent analysis. The Nothern born African-Americans have different politics and racial views than a southern-born African-American who was raised under segregationüëçüèæ‚úåüèæ.

You don't gef tired of having to explain what Biden really meant? You have to do this like every 3 days. At something you're going to have to accept Joe Biden is the racist I've been telling you he is
We do not, but we also know that Biden isn't going to change anything, and honestly could open the door for Republican resurgence. Some of us are looking past the next four years. But we also know that the US can't survive another four years of trump. So, handwringing.
Ana Navarro is a big get for Team Biden  There, I fixed it for you. A respected journalist like yourself shouldn't leave such an incorrect message up. Please delete and correct.
We should keep acting like Biden is gonna lose until the results are certified. Can‚Äôt get complacent.
But I didn‚Äôt find Biden‚Äôs comments racist.... so ... I think this is a distraction
I don‚Äôt know why but I feel that Biden was put in place to insure trumps victory.. otherwise why have him there at all. There were a few far better Candidates to choose from that could go toe to toe with trump.

The thing about Biden that people don't understand is he is of the old school of prejudice against blacks.  It is so deeply ingrained in him that it's not gaffe's he keeps making - he truly doesn't get what's wrong with what he says.

What is racism explained. After #Biden asked the black guy today if he was tested for cocaine or if he is a junkie.
Imagine if Trump had asked a black, male interviewer, "Are you on cocaine? Are you a junkie?" as Biden did?  OMG what a difference it would have made in the news.
So basically Biden thinks the black community IS a monolith, no wonder he gets offended whenever a black person questions him, he thinks we're all supposed to be like Simone Sanders

No one cares.  Get back to contrasting Trump vs Biden on taxes and law and order.   Otherwise Biden wins.
But Joe Biden is against God! Man this guy is truly insane!!
And you cannot think of anything intelligent to say so you resort to insults. Trump has been running the country just fine, just because we like him or vote for him does not mean we are stupid. It's not Biden we gotta worry about he don't want to be Pres. he'll hand it to VP

Biden has SUPERNATURAL POWERS and will hurt the almighty
And the leader of the GOP just called Biden the enemy of God.  It looks like there's no lower depth the GOP could stoop to in the presidential campaign, but there are *glances at calendar* about 90 lower depths waiting for us
Now that your leader has declared Joe Biden the enemy of God himself, are you taking up the sword of the crusader? And if not, why do you choose to facilitate the Antichrist as your leader has declared
Of course they don't and Biden shouldn't suggest otherwise. But most black neighborhoods vote 90+% D.  That may be the case in a few Latino neighborhoods but it isn't as widespread and it varies a lot by national origin.
I have an idea...in the Biden/Trump debate every time Trump says ‚Äúfake News‚Äù the audience yells ‚Äúthe truth‚Äù and takes a drink!
One reason Biden may be having trouble finding a running mate that can help him win: Out of black women in Congress, only 2 (Lucy McBath &amp; Lauren Underwood) come from competitive districts, and both were first elected just in 2018.
Exactly... which is why you calling Biden one is laughable. You aren't supposed to respond until you have that LeBron accountability quote. Still waiting.

You mean like Obama did. Pretty sure Biden stated he wants to take what Barry did and go even farther....
Some of us don‚Äôt need to a debate. We aren‚Äôt swayed by the empty words and divisive rhetoric that dominates these spectacles. We know what you both offer. You offer nothing. Biden offers normalcy. Easy choice.

For democracy's sake there needs to be debates, but Biden can run victory formation 3 times, take a knee and run out the clock. Donny T will self implode with or without debates...
Those of us who know why Biden responded that way will probably vote for Biden. However a President needs to speak clearly and avoid snark and sarcasm. He asked a black reporter if they took a drug test. If that was Trump asking what would you think?  is better than that
Biden ahead by any amount will benefit down ballot democrats.
Suggestions that he skip the debates are coming from pundits outside the campaign.  Biden has never wavered in his commitment to three televised debates.

Pour a glass of the good stuff, sit back in your most comfortable chair, and enjoy the ride.
And my point is, the Democrats/those on the Left still want to hold Trump accountable for his past/current words/deeds, but want to give Biden a pass for his past/current words/deeds. That's blatant hypocrisy! Trump has been working with the black community, what has Biden done?
Joe Biden does not want to debate Trump at all, but surely not until many or most people have voted by mail so they can't change their vote when they realize he is experiencing serious cognitive decline.

I've said it before and I'll say it again. There's very few who are willing to admit that there's still going to be people suffering in Joe Biden's administration. It's now only a matter of how many will suffer is what drives their decision. Why does it always lead to suffering?

I'm going to hold Joe Biden's feet to the fire and demand better from him, because I don't care if he thinks healthcare is only a privilege, it's a human right. I'm not going to simply bow my head and accept bread crumbs. We demand better policies from him. What about you?
Given the fact he has said he has no empathy for the younger generation and that nothing will fundamentally change, of fucking course I'm going to demand better from Joe Biden. I need to know what he's going to do if he become president. Is that too much to ask?
By the way, just so we're clear, because a lot of you believe I find the alternative better, I don't want Trump to win. Period. End of story. I just want Biden to do better and not leave us behind and neglect us. We deserve healthcare even if we have no job. We're in a pandemic.
I'm worried about Joe Biden vetoing Medicare For All like he said he would, and any compromise on a healthcare system will still leave millions like me without health insurance even in a pandemic. I'm demanding better for Joe Biden, and here I am being reprimanded for it.
I agree. Compared to Trump, it's a slight shift to the left. I just find it frustrating that we're going to have to beg for Joe Biden to move slightly more to the left on healthcare since he doesn't believe in a single payer system when every other nation has it.
Went through it with my father in law. Biden does not have dementia. He had slowed down but I‚Äôm confident he will hire good people which is more than I can say for Trump: family members and donors
Because you have some one (biden) that will not be able to answer the questions.
Trump appears to blame Obama for lack of coronavirus tests and says US deaths 'lower than the world' - follow live
If anyone can say Biden has a cognitive decline and look at this Trump Axios video and see this crazy guy talk and support him it's on you this guy is living in another world
You didn't even vote for him. When you grow up you can vote like an adult. Yeah, make your 1st vote for Biden. Kill some more babies!
Without Biden, I don't know that Pres. Obama successfully gets rid of DADT, honestly. Pretty important to me, even as a straight guy, that my brothers and sisters in arms are able to proudly be who they are and not worry about someone finding out. üëè
Trump says the death of my Americans quote‚Äù IT IS WHAT IT IS!! This MF!! Vote biden 2020!!  Listen to the scientific experts asshole!
This gives me some hope that there will be at least someone in Congress who will stand up against a Joe Biden administration.  is one of those few I trust these days.
You may want to broaden your information diet.  "Shy voters" are a thing, especially in 2020.
What has Donald tRump done to warrant sharing a debate stage with Joe Biden?
We talk about Beyonce's stunning visual album Black is King, The NBA, Biden's Angels and what can Black children grow up to be....
Me: Hey, I'm worried about Joe Biden's plan, or lack of, aside from defeating Trump in November. Where do we go from there?  Centrists: How dare you ask questions. Are you serious? Are you stupid? Have you been living under a rock? Just be silent and bow your head. You lost.  üôÑ
I mean, what's the point.  Its not like your dad has nothing important to say.  He never does.  Besides, after his creeping around in the background behind Clinton, we just assume your dad is gonna keep trying to cough on Biden and we love Joe too much to subject him to that.
I didn‚Äôt think simply asking for Biden‚Äôs plan would generate such anger and frustration. Forgive me for asking and not simply being quiet and do as I‚Äôm told. I‚Äôm just asking for guidance in this dark time.
I think asking for Biden‚Äôs plans after he wins is not so much to ask for, but apparently it‚Äôs taboo for some. I‚Äôm just worried Biden won‚Äôt do anything in terms of healthcare even in a pandemic. He still thinks healthcare should be tied to employment.
I have been living, thankfully. Despite my depression for all these last 4 years I‚Äôm still living. Bernie gave me hope, but Biden won and doesn‚Äôt believe in the things Bernie fought for like a single payer system. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll still struggle to have healthcare under Biden.
I didn‚Äôt think asking for Biden‚Äôs plan after we defeat Trump was too much to ask for, but I guess it is for some. I‚Äôm just worried about it having healthcare for 4 more years under Biden. I didn‚Äôt think asking what he would do would generate anger by some.
So hope and pray he nudges a inch to the left on healthcare and has a conscience and doesn‚Äôt veto single payer legislation. Seems like a valid plan. I just hate seeing people suffer while we try to force Biden to do what‚Äôs right in a pandemic.
I didn‚Äôt say I wanted Trump. All I‚Äôm asking is Biden‚Äôs plan for helping us who are struggling and at best all I‚Äôve gotten was ‚Äúadd to the ACA‚Äù. So not changing much. So it‚Äôs back to still be worried about getting sick. I didn‚Äôt think asking for his plan would be so divisive.
Asking what would happen next after Trump is defeated and Biden is elected was rather eye opening. I was mostly scorn by centrists for being worried I would still be without healthcare for 4 more years. It‚Äôs almost like asking what plan Biden has is taboo for his supporters.
OH HEEEELL NO!! üëéüèæ
Trump likes women, no doubt. There is absolutely nothing to make anyone think he is a pedeophile. Biden's videos of touching and sniffing little girls are everywhere. That is not normal with perfect strangers.
"We're lower than the world" - well it's impossible for them to be higher! Jesus christ. And his supporters have the gall to call Biden senile.
all Biden has to do is say his name and speak in complete sentences to win the debate and it will be the Trump's campaign's fault that they set the expectations so low for him.
I don't know what will happen if Biden wins other than "not being in a dictatorship" from what moderates have told me in the past few hours. I fear nothing will change with Biden, and things will worsen with Trump. I hate this nightmare and I want it to end.
So, yes, I'm fully aware of what's happening. I lose sleep over the possibility of getting sick and not having health insurance. I'm worried Biden's healthcare plan will still leave millions like me without healthcare even in the middle of a deadly pandemic.
Agreed to all of those. I'm worried Biden won't do much to help us in this pandemic. I'm w/o a job and have no insurance. It's hard to find a job that doesn't put my loved ones at risk with underlining health problems. He still believes healthcare should be tied to employment.
I'm muting this thread. I appreciate those who gave their reasons, reached out and explained it to me. I do hope things will be better soon. I just want people to have healthcare because I believe healthcare is a human right, even if Biden doesn't believe it.
That's what drew me to Bernie. He knew those lobbyists have shaped the political system into what it is, but sadly we're still stuck in it with either Trump or Biden. It's only a matter of damage reduction, which is another argument I hear being made for the case for Biden.
I'm well aware of that and others have said the same. Part of what drew me to Bernie was he knew drastic changes were needed in this chaotic and ever changing time. I worry Biden won't do anything to meet those challenges head on, but sadly that's the only choice I'm left with.
True. Which is why I'm worried Biden won't do much to help us weather this storm that is COVID since he's merely "adding" to the current system we have, which will not help those struggling to find a job and have insurance. But you're right, it's better than the alternative.
I understand that. I only wish his healthcare proposal was more adequate to meet the needs of those suffering in this pandemic, because who knows how long this will last even after Biden wins. Better that than the "alternative". Thanks for your input.
Thank you for those who answered me in earnest. I have some sense of what's to come after Biden is elected. It's just a shame people will continue to die by the time Biden is pushed just a little further to the left on issues like healthcare.
Well, I do appreciate your bluntness &amp; honesty. Not a lot are willing to admit people will still suffer under a Biden administration, but that is still worth removing Trump just so we can make incremental steps during a deadly and ever changing pandemic. Thank you
It would be. I'd also rest easy knowing I'd have a president who believes we deserve to have healthcare that isn't tied to our employment even in the middle of a deadly pandemic. That's something I hope for in Biden, but sadly he's hostile to that idea.
I want to put the fire out, and I also want to know how we're going to rebuild once we put it out. I believe it's a reasonable thing to ask for since Biden has once said "Nothing will fundamentally change". I want to avoid those beginnings so we won't meet those ends.
My worry is even if Biden wins and he's able to make these small incremental changes, I'm afraid people will still suffer because they're unable to have health coverage b/c they can't afford it. Trust me, I want to defeat Trump. I want to know where we go from there afterwards.
I'm not interested in what-ifs because Biden is the nominee.
Okay, so we remove Trump. And then what? What is Joe Biden going to do after he becomes president? What is he going to do to help us not have to lose sleep over getting sick and become financially ruined because we don't have health insurance?
I'm without a job and I can't work outside from home because I'm living with loved ones who have underlining health conditions. It's extremely difficult to find remote work and have employer based health insurance. What is Biden going to do to address that?
I'm not. I'm simply asking what else are Joe Biden's plans besides removing Trump? What are his plans to help families struggling to pay for healthcare because they can't work or find work because we're in a deadly pandemic?
So, a list of things Biden won't do, but there's not much of anything Biden WILL do if he becomes president? Nothing on helping our families and the most vulnerable? No  changes to help us in this pandemic?
I don't know... I think this tweet is more anti-Trump than it has anything to do with Biden.
Gotta love Biden Bros telling undecided voters they're stupid and they don't care. Hey  will you denounce your toxic supporters?
For someone telling me to "adult now", you're very childish for not doing something as simple as telling one plan Joe Biden has.Biden and Harris complement each other pretty perfectly.  I can‚Äôt find a single valid reason for her NOT to be the pick.
and this is the reason I don‚Äôt understand how Biden got the Nomination
No, but it means if you're dedicated to getting trump out you NEED to vote for Biden.
A vote for Biden would be a vote for criminals and enemies. Treasonous gangs who committed #ObamaGate and pedophiles want Biden's win. China, Iran and globalists like Soros hope Biden's win.   Vote for Trump to #KAG.
Biden: "My son's death lead me to believe deeply that no one should have to suffer from not having quality health care."  You idiots: "Biden said we don't deserve health care!"  Like, WTF?
Where the hell did you read that Biden wants to imprison Communists? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
And against the candidate who was leading in the primaries nearly the entire time. It's not like Biden was some dark horse candidate.
Never did I see a map in 2016 with Mississippi as a toss-up. Making shit up doesn't help your case.  "Sure, Biden is ahead in the polls now but in 2016 everyone said Clinton would win all 50 states."

No. As much as I admire Biden and hate Trump, freedom &amp; equality shouldn't be bought with obscene sums of money that would be better spent on doing real good to people's lives. There must be a cap to funding so equality and representation is within reach of all, poor included.
No one I know wants Biden to win! Get your facts straight!
Let's be reality? Interesting that you don't think Biden wrote it. Have you any evidence why?
has LBC played the Biden "children stroking my hairy legs" video or any of the dozens of clips of Biden's ongoing dementia problems.
If anyone is hiding in a bunker it is Biden, they are keeping him there because he is a joke and a liability, he would just be a puppet for the deep state and the cult to manipulate if he got into power
Good.
I didn't realise Biden was such a hard case...
For every "funding the military is a war crime" vote Biden loses he gains 10 votes from swing voters in the suburbs. üôÑ
Biden delays in picking a VP just means the media can keep talking &amp; speculating on that &amp; perhaps stay busy. Kind of smart isn't it?
WTF?  Again: we're talking about BIDEN.  I disagree that anything Obama did was a "war crime", but Biden wasn't even in the chain of command. He's launched exactly zero drone strikes or whatever you think Obama did that was supposedly criminal.
We actually know of many foreign policy decisions where he specifically didn't go with Biden's position, but do go on (Biden was against intervention in Libya, for instance).
Um. What?  The existence of terrorism proves that Biden is a war criminal? WTF?  How do you define a war crime? Is any military action a "war crime" in your worm-infested mind?
Biden did? How? The Vice President isn't even in the chain of command, you lunatics.
Marxism? You think Joe Biden is a Communist? üôÑ  You idiots are so far beyond parody at this point.
Jesus tapdancing Christ.  You know what, y'all? Joe Biden could pick Tinky Winky the purple Teletubby as his running mate and I would stand in line all day to vote for them.  #VoteBlueIDGAFWho
"War criminal" is one of those phrases dumbass tankies use to mean whatever they want it to mean.  I mean, Biden never served in the military and has never ordered any military action (let alone a criminal one), but he's somehow a "war criminal." üôÑ
Biden is an absolute clown-how any normal US citizens could even consider voting for a man who wants to destroy the economy,ban religion, ban school choice,increase taxes etc is ridiculous.
If Biden can hurt Trump's God, does that make Trump's God the devil?
Just what I thought. Biden is more powerful than God? Wow, vote him in, he'll perform miracles!
Biden is more powerful than God? Wow, vote him in, he'll perform miracles! Win win!
Biden is more powerful than God? Wow, vote him in, he'll perform miracles!
Trump will decide that the best arbiter would be Barr and claim he's non-partisan. He would ensure that any money "he" lost would come out of the treasury or other people's pockets, not his. Biden would lose. Terrible idea!

Vote forTucker Carlson, the stupidest human on eart, and listen to what he is saying now:  it's 'probably illegal' for Joe Biden to pick a Black woman as vice president
These are people who think Biden is literally Hitler because he understands that you can't pass a healthcare mandate until after the SCOTUS flips. They seem to barely know what the Supreme Court is.
I had a kidney transplant, so I'm immunosuppressed. That means there's no way my special needs kids get the in-person school support and therapy they need until President Biden has months to get a handle on the pandemic.  But these fucking monsters are helping Trump.
They never seem to think that maybe there's a reason older African-Americans support Biden. A lot of these folks can remember the crack epidemic and how they were just begging for something to be done in black communities.
....and of course the fact they will take over from Biden after a month or so when he becomes 'ill'
Biden is desperate.....he has no intention of MAGA-he is concerned for himself. The US is heading in a great direction under POTUS Trump yet the left would rather cut their own nose off to spite their face.
Will Presidential debates happen?  Questions is: Will Dems change the rules and hold debates in a way that allows Biden to read answers to questions he has been given ahead of time off a monitor?
how can voters be sending in ballots starting, in some cases, one month before t'first presidential debate. move t'ruddy first debate oop. a debate, t'me, is a public service. joe biden and i owe it t'american folk! #MakeYorkshireGreatAgain #YorkshireDT
Yes. In the publicity pics, I thought the Sturgeon, Lammy, Forensic, Corbyn, Abbott, and Biden puppets were really good.  Oh, wait. I must have imagined seeing them.  Tried Britbox. Up to now it's been a re-serving of stuff I've already paid for.  No thanks.
So many posts about Biden, I'm beginning to think you work for him.
Republicans.  Trump and McConnell are ok with you getting evicted, they are ok if you go hungry and are homeless.  They don't care.. They've never cared about you, yet you keep voting for them.  If trump gets his way, his next thing is to take away your healthcare.  VOTE BIDEN.
Really good Trump tops Biden as both tout large July fundraising hauls
I mean, I spent the early primary talking about what a bad idea Biden was, but I was wrong. Apparently the guy is Teflon and is exactly what swing voters want.
Also like how the same idiots who spent the primary talking about how Biden would get creamed by Trump are just pretending he isn't threatening to beat Trump in goddamn Texas and is actually doing badly. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"What did you do during the struggle to remove Trump and save the republic, grandpa?"  "Well, I posted a bunch of memes about how Biden likes to sniff kid's hair and that the guy who served as Obama's Veep is a committed segregationist. Then I didn't vote again."
It's bizarre what a mirror they are of Trumpers.  Trumpers ridiculously pretend Biden is a radical Marxist. They pretend he's some hard-right fascist. Both are so in their bubble and up their asses that they don't see what caricatures they are.
He is losing. The polls have Biden in double figures, Hillary was never that far ahead. The US Covid crisis will be largely over by Nov, but I still think that will be downfall due to his constant flip-flopping. It all depends on whether they forgive him or not.
First, good?  Will make more people vote for Biden.  Second - you claimed COVID would be GONE by Labor Day.  You have the blood of 150,000 dead Americans on your hands.   You aren't pro-life.
It will be mostly virtual; that was decided some time ago. Milwaukee is serving as the official physical location. Even with Biden there, attendance would (rightly) have been limited.
Just a sneaky way of taking votes away from Biden. He's openly colluding with Trump's gang. Nuts.
Who would be on the ballot?  Neither Trump nor Biden are officially their party's candidates yet.
everything the gop does is to harm biden to get the deer leeder re-elected.
Joe Biden, the best Democrats have to offer. What a joke.
If Steve meant the Biden comment it was simply because he'd said the US would join CPTPP. Trump already said they won't. Odd reason to block me. Perhaps his confidence that CPTPP is our salvation is misplaced.
Which is fair enough but isn't current trade with the CPTPP only worth ¬£100bn? We'd have to push that up 4 or 5 fold to make this a game changer. UK has published the economic impact assessment yet so it all looks a bit vague to me. Like your confidence in Biden winning üòÅ

Or it's a sign that Biden has been pretty sure about one candidate for months now and just wants everyone else to feel they were given a fair shake.  The entire thing could be theater.

Special guest appearance at the inauguration ceremony of President Biden?
No debate, period.  You‚Äôre either voting for the lying psychopath, or not.  Biden needs to just speak online directly to progressives and non-voters.  Trumpets are a lost cause.
If the democrats don't make his campaign slogan "Biden: His Time" they are missing a trick.
They will invoke the 25th amendment within the first year if Biden wins. Just after Biden nominations Barack Odumbo as Ginsburg‚Äôs replacement on the SCOTUS.

Against any rational candidate Biden would lose. But Americans who are not totally tribal, like my wife, will vote for him to end the Trump madness.  We just pray he doesn't start another war, which ironically he is more likely to do than Trump.
I too don‚Äôt understand why   could not be THE candidate. Is he going to be his VP if Biden gets the top job?
Nobody knows who those 3% are. They may simply be folks who refuse to join the public option, since (for now) the SCOTUS has blocked a mandate.  Biden has been clear that the goal has always been universal healthcare.
Joe Biden's running mate - none will satisfy all sections of the party
This is ridiculous!! Biden folks get your act together.
Joe Biden says if he gets elected and gets done what he is promising he will be the most "progressive President in history."  Gee, didn't  token Republican  call Joe Biden a centrist?So what? Biden's an easy target. If it bothers you so much, don't cover it, you big crybaby.
He's not Joe Biden and doesn't think like the radical Dem lefties.
It amazes me that team Biden would even consider Rice as a VP contender, what with all the baggage she brings.
üö®The rap superstar indicated, in an interview by text today, that he was in fact running to siphon votes from the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.
Maybe the fact just today Biden said The Latino community is more diverse  unlike the black community, but let‚Äôs ignore that right ?
One can believe Rice would be a mistaken choice and also support Biden even if he makes that error. That‚Äôs where I am. I wish  was there, too.
To the extent anyone cares, this is my ranked preferences for Biden‚Äôs VP pick: 1) Val Demings 2) Tammy Duckworth 3) Kamala Harris  Anyone else, imho, would be a mistake.
Elizabeth Warren was the closest to getting the presidential nomination of all the women. She is the strongest support for Biden should be the VP pick.
Biden's "gaffe's" are just examples of a human being existing as a normal human being. Hence, they are not gaffes.   That is journalistic speak, and its kind of insulting. It wags a finger, quietly stating that you yourself are always perfect, never making mistakes.*
Biden won‚Äôt do that, he has class
So can we anticipate that in the remote chance Biden is elected as President, that he won‚Äôt be emerging out of his basement to actually run the country until after COVID is annihilated?

If we are neither militarily, economically or politically useful, and our global credibility is in the gutter, what use are we to USA? WW2 is a long time ago, and increasingly looking like an epoch long gone. If anything, we'll just be the Trumpy cousins Biden will want to ignore
I have voted Republican in the past and will again but not for  if the GOP nominates anyone to run against Biden that is not full of Trumpism they are going to win.
takes advantage of Biden's delay to address one of her big weaknesses. The effectiveness of this I leave for others to determine. I'm just saying that I think it's a very smart play.
Mr. Trump can cognitively string together words to make a coherent sentence. He repeatedly, and successfully, demonstrates this talent on an hourly basis.  Mr. Biden is, to be blunt, an intellectual dumpster fire. It's a wonder he doesn't have people reminding him to breathe.
Biden could then be elected pro tem. He's not senior over Leahy anymore now that he's been out of the Senate for 12 years (he had Leahy by two years when they were serving together), but again, that's just a tradition, not a rule, and certainly not a constitutional requirement.
Yeah, it's possible, but with the different implications given in the Senate rules, I think choosing a non-Senator would require a rule change (or significant clarification). HOWEVER, Delaware has a Senate seat up this year. Biden could be appointed to fill that vacancy.
You got a lot of calling out to do. The smart republicans/ conservatives don‚Äôt want that nasty child groped. And we like your no good sorry ass . You might be ok with Biden groping your children but thank goodness not everyone is as sickening and disgusting as you Democrat‚Äôs are.
Hey, Donald, guess what. Some of us know you‚Äôre using the fed to artificially prop up the stock market. WHEN you lose your job to Biden, the market will go back to what it really is. Fear tactics don‚Äôt work with those of us with brains

I agree Joe Biden and Obama has the best job creation record of any president in history Trump has one of the worse.  He took a booming economy and road it into the ground. Now it's there are over 50M Americans out of work.

Was Biden describing you? Well I have to say he's spot on.
Yes &amp; remember, while Biden has condemned interference by foreigners in our elections, Trump has asked Russia, begged China &amp; extorted Ukraine for help. The Republicans even went so far as to remove language requiring campaigns to report foreign election aid to FBI from a bill

Biden is hardly "just stuttering". There is a reason there won't be any debates. That's because he can't string together three sentences without losing his train of thought or saying something stupid. They're hiding him. Trump, however, would love to engage in debate.

With 92 days until Election Day, here's what we're watching heading into a new week in the 2020 campaign:
I'm behind Biden 100%! I don't care who he picks. I trust his judgment!
No. But if a vote for a 3rd candidate is a defacto vote for Joe Biden, a man who calls abortion "healthcare", then you might as well vote Democrat. Yes, referring to abortion as "healthcare" is worse than anything Trump has done. It's a declaration that abortion is "good".
Yep... you‚Äôve already won... no need to work on anything... don‚Äôt worry Biden‚Äôs got it locked upüòÇ
Why Biden‚Äôs VP pick will matter so much -  -
If Joe Biden wins the White House in November, America will likely see significant changes in foreign policy as Biden reverses, dismantles or severely curtails many of President Donald Trump‚Äôs most significant and boldest actions.  LEARN MORE:
When you can start dealing with the problems America has right now, I‚Äôll consider being more concerned about Biden‚Äôs intents for America because right now, quite honestly, a bag of Cheetos could do better than you.
1st: Nina compared Biden to a bowl of shit. I doubt she wants to join his ticket.  2nd: Nina's last elected position was as a state senator six years ago. That's a pretty bare CV for a potential VP.  Stop trying to make Vice President Nina Turner happen. It isn't gonna happen.
First: Nina compared Biden to a bowl of shit. I really doubt she wants to join his ticket.  Second: Nina's last elected position was a statewide office six years ago. That's a pretty bare resume for a potential VP.  Nina as VP isn't gonna happen. Stop trying to make it happen.
Giving the WH to Biden will empower these maniacs!
I don't believe it because the evidence isn't there and the people pushing the story (not just the accuser but the anti-Biden media people she spoke to) all have serious credibility problems.
Biden isn't a rapist. The case against him was flimsy to begin with and quickly fell apart.
Doesn't really change the information in the article, now does it?  And by your logic, didn't Bernie sell out the moment he withdrew from the race and immediately endorsed Biden?
Second: I have already established that the rape claims against Biden are false.  Third: There were other reasons the crime bill was passed besides the War on Drugs. Violent crime in black communities *was* a serious problem in 1994. That's why the CBC supported it.
IOW, you can't name a major Bernie-sponsored civil rights law because he was mostly AWOL during his Senate career.  Also, I know you're not voting for Biden. I don't expect to you  to vote for Biden. But I can mock you for behaving selfishly while the country is on fire.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Ummm... we aren't loyal to Biden. We criticize him sometimes, believe it or not. We just don't hold the country hostage when other lefties/liberals/Dems don't nominate him.
Not as cult like as me pointing out Bernie taking a similar position to Biden on the crime bill and you blithely dismissing it.
The articles spell out why Biden most likely didn't rape her. Read them for yourself. I'm not your first grade English teacher.
That's horrific, but that doesn't change the fact that the crime bill had broad support at the time (from both black and white communities) and that Biden didn't draft it for racist reasons -- no matter how hard you want to convince yourself that he did.
And I'm pointing out to you that BIDEN wasn't the only person behind the crime bill. It also wasn't BIDEN's intent for disproportionate mass incarceration to happen (the CBC wouldn't have backed the bill if it was). '94 was a different time that you don't seem to understand.
I'm pointing out that the CBC supported the crime bill along with Joe Biden while üåπ Twitter tried to depict Biden as an enemy of the black community.  You know... context.  Which you don't seem to grasp.
I'd be willing to put money on it! He's just like my poor Mom was at one time before she got worse and worse üò¢‚òπÔ∏è til she didn't even know me. Now she doesn't know Daddy, her husband of almost 73 years! How very sad. BIDEN definitely has it!!! He needs to be in a nursing home.
Didn‚Äôt Biden was eloquent about working closely with Storm Thurmond?
Patriots lined up for VP Pence...Cops for Trump event! Sleepy Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt fill a phone booth! Vote #Trump2020 Election Day #KAG #TheFive #WeWillVote
Postponing the election would not postpone the date of the transition of administrations if Biden were to win. I see no problem with it.
Woah, looks like I was right.
Ridin with Biden is cool
So what is wrong with a woman wanting to be president? We know Biden wanted to president when was VP. Why is an ambitious woman considered a threat?  knows her worth and every other woman should too.
Unreal. Biden sells America out to Ukraine, and Trump is the one impeached for holding him to the same standards as everyone else.
So, how come Biden's bailing them out?But Biden will drug us and use astroglide.
Who actually believes that bullshit? I mean seriously; the fact that it perfectly lines up with Trump's claims the China supports Biden is just too much for me. I believe they are interfering but not for Biden, for Trump. I'm ready for TRUTH no more lies!
Plus, Biden never forgets to bring a towel.
Women are absolutely the key to a Biden victory.
The youth of TikTok hurt Trump's Tulsa rally, that makes them bad. Russia is helping Trump get reelected by maligning Biden &amp; sowing discord in the United States, that makes them good. For Trump what's a few American lives lost, if it helps him to be reelected. It is what it is.
Agree.  Joe Biden is probably not a racist.
I have no doubt they will.  My concern is what impact they'll have in the 2022 cycle or 2024 cycle if Biden's elected. Whose side are they going to be on?
If Kanye Somehow Stays in the Presidential Race, It'll Hurt Trump, Not Biden  via   Some thoughts here.
Absolutely! In their attempt to attack Trump or Biden, they're doing Russia's and China's work for them. Regardless of who wins the election, if Americans lose faith in their systems and institutions, we've ultimately given China and Russia exactly what they want.
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
Part of this is in the spirit of "fair fight." Trump doesn't pay me for my advice, I offer it freely. Biden has likely NEVER heard of me. So, I offer that advice in this honest spirit. I want honest Democrats to take my poll. I must give them honest response.
‚ÄúWe know Biden isn‚Äôt the best, but you can‚Äôt say anything bad about him because it helps trump. Just stay silent until he‚Äôs in office‚Äù - my mom
Can someone, anyone just get me in touch with VP Biden I feel he is stuck at 40K feet and his advisors might be too. I can help counterpunch a criminal minded POTUS and get ya back to 12ft! PLEASE give me a shot DM.
joe biden is finished
Likeability again: The kind of powerful woman who can be easily liked and admired by colleagues is the kind of woman who is willing to step out of the frame, to disappear herself and her presence from any public record of political achievement.‚Äù
24) You all know where I stand. Now, let me turn to how I would advise the Biden team. First, I'd tell them, DO NOT BUY THE POLLS. Take precisely ZERO comfort from them. Focus on your man, himself. He has assets, we must use them. He has liabilities, we must address them.
18) If I am right, the only thing the Democrat powers have are lies. The most important of their lies are polls. Polling says Biden is winning! As I look, that's all I see. And that brings us back, once again, to the difference between Democrat leadership and Patriotic Democrats.
6) For what it's worth, until either the Dornsife poll, or my own, gives me the credible data to make a credible call, I won't. But I say again, from what I see, this is no ride in the park for you Democrats. To my subjective eye alone, Biden is a worse candidate than was HRC.
4) Besides that, once my data rises to a sufficient number and proper model for credibility, I may well join their ranks and predict Biden's victory, and the retaking of the Senate, etc. But, there absolutely is another. Hand, and I urge my Democrat friends to contemplate it.
3) If the polls are right. If Biden sweeps into an easy victory, the House is held, and the Senate retaken by the Democrats, as pretty much the entire polling industry (exception so far is Rasmussen) seems to be calling for, then I will be the guy saying they were right.
2) I could not have dreamed of a candidate who literally bunkers through his campaign before. I could not have dreamed of a Media who bases its entire call for Biden based upon polls. I've talked about this before, but it's really important to address again.
Agree entirely. Every time Biden opens his mouth, I brace myself for the worse, and it comes inevitably. Yes, the alt is far worse, but I am frankly exhausted by the fact that we are constantly confronted with the ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù in these presidential races.
Oh, good. Glad to see this Trump slip getting coverage while Biden's TWO BOMBSHELLS: "are you a junkie?" to a Black reporter, and "unlike the African American community" are basically being ignored....
Remember when Ovana called Biden clean?
Joe Biden doesn't have to carry a bible to events to prove his faith, he lives by it therefore people can see it. With Trump it's all word, no action, from corruptness of his spirit to his dirty penis in anything that will move whether the person says no or not. #VoteBiden2020
If Biden wins the presidency, the over/under on number of apologies issued for saying something dumb during his first term is set at 212.5.
"I haven't taken a [cognitive] test. Why the hell would I?" Biden to CBS reporter, who is Black. "Come on, man. That's like saying you, before you got on this program, you take a test where you're taking cocaine. What do you think? Huh? Are you a junkie?"
From my morning reading, I've learned that Biden said Latinos are more diverse than African-Americans, whatever that means, and Trump says Biden will "hurt God" if he's elected. It's Moron 1 vs. Moron 2 for the soul of the free world, everybody
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
WOW. ‚ÄúCompetence, reliability and dialogue may not be a high bar to set a presidency, but simple normality would amount to a revival of the idea of the west, such has been the chaos of the past four years.‚Äù
I can‚Äôt believe we have to vote for Joe Fucking Biden.* What an absolute joke.**  *we do HAVE to vote for Joe Biden tho  **Joe Biden‚Äôs going to lose :(
Interesting giving that I have seen pictures Joe Biden in a church and praying. I have seen him talk about scripture. The closest I‚Äôve seen President Trump to a church was the upside down Bible in front of one.
Yes.  Joe Biden helped George W. Bush push a war based on lies.  Biden held a sham hearing without calling former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter who would have debunked Bush‚Äôs WMD claims with hard evidence.  Biden helped kill half a million people.
Biden personally helped Bush execute the invasion of Iraq by withholding key witnesses from his Senate hearing in Iraqi WMDs.  Testimony by weapons inspector Scott Ritter would have debunked Bush‚Äôs WMD claims.  Biden enabled a genocidal war based on lies.
You say ‚Äúboth evils and take the lesser‚Äù and you‚Äôre still advocating for Trump?   Do you for a second think that Trump would get a spot in heaven before Joe Biden?
trump is angling for the anti-gamer vote and it's going to win him re-election unless biden comes out Strongly pro-gamer
By saying fuck Trump and Biden. I am leaving the top of the ballot blank. I am not the one for the bullshit. You won‚Äôt shame me, bully me,or harass me into voting for these clowns. Whoever wins, it is what it is. PERIOD.   Good try tho.
If Susan Rice gets tapped as Biden's VP, it's going to be fun listening to how her contacts with a genocidal Rwandan dictator are better than Manafort's dealings w/ Yanukovich.
Still haven't seen a biden poster Without the internet there is no proof that man exists after the 2012 election
Biden can hurt God? Wow!  That's pretty powerful. I'm definitely voting Democrat this year.
Opinion | If Biden wins, the post-Trump corruption purge will have to be epic - The Washington Post -
As long as he's in the G section, I am dying to hear Trump explain how Biden is also against gnomes and gnostics. You just know he would pronounce the "G".
Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden via
I'm excited to learn that Joe Biden is apparently part of the Leftist movement to attack and dethrone God.
If Biden gets elected, ah, there will be no toilet paper holders, and people won't use their turn signals, and, ah, your shoes will be taken away, without notice!
It‚Äôs so saaad that you have to talk about Biden because you can‚Äôt talk about the disastrous current situation consequence of your incompetence.
Biden actually attends church.   Trump can't even find Two Corinthians.
Why does Trump keep making Biden sound cooler than he is?
One advantage to Trump is he catalyzes reaction. One disadvantage to Biden is he's a quaalude.  Biden puts us to sleep.
Seems like Drumpf managed to get rid of a lot who were in place in 2017. Biden ought to be able to do likewise.
Biden as a representative of the neoliberal compromise and neoliberal swindle and  deception is what GAVE us Trump.  If we continue to accept Bidens we'll have Trumps from here to eternity.
The media in the US is wildly biased, sure, but it‚Äôs a different thing than state-owned, state-controlled media that puts out stories on government command.
Their definition includes as state media only those where the state excercises editorial control. So not the BBC either.
As Oscar Wilde said, "Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth."  (He didn't say it in his own voice, but that's another matter.)  That said, Biden has committed the unpardonable sin of being right.
When you're Joe Biden every day is Christmas.  Or Easter.  Or some holiday like that.  I forget.
Joe Biden Makes Astonishing Announcement About Black And Latino Communities: ‚ÄòUnlike the African American Community ‚Ä¶ the Latino Community Is an Incredibly Diverse Community‚Äô
Ffs, ‚Å¶ just say it: HE LIED
I think Biden's comment about diversity in Latino communities is spot-on: A community cannot be truly diverse if nearly all its members believe the same things or vote in the same way.  By that light, most cities in America are not as diverse as small towns.
They should probably wait before packing their bags. If Biden's elected, this isn't happening.   With that in mind though, we should still forward deploy more forces to Poland though. USAREUR could use more forces.
To be fair, the instant Biden is sworn in, Trump‚Äôs god becomes indictable, and boy has he committed crimes!
The one in Two Corinthians. Where, verily, Biden hateth the Lord. üòÇ
Joe Biden wouldn't kill God because he'd say there isn't enough paper work to do so but that maybe we can try in two thousands years.
knows where of he speaks. Biden is directly mentioned in Two Corinthians üòÇüòÇüòÇ
we've been trying to attack &amp; dethrone god for months and now joe biden is trying to jump on the bandwagon right before the election? SUSPICIOUS.
‚Äúelect Biden and we shall experience the plot of Neon Genesis Evangelion‚Äù sounds pretty cool actually
Quinnipiac finds Biden up 52%-37% in Maine, though ME-2 is still very close:  ME-1: Biden 61%, Trump 30% (was Clinton +15%) ME-2: Trump 45%, Biden 44% (was Trump +11%)
honestly will vote biden unless his VP pick is Putin, that's the only disqualifying choice for me, even then i'd have to think about it because then at least we'd know more of what putin's doing
Is that exactly who it‚Äôs for? Older white men for Biden for whom car memories are real and relatable? It does very little for me.
Biden's mouth is not quite big enough for his shoe but he keeps trying.  Trying to light our darkness  with him is like trying to defeat night with a Christmas tree bulb.  For anyone who believes we can do that I got news.  Crisis requires more wattage.
for my new lefty followers i‚Äôm not going tell u to vote biden. #NoComradesUnder1k
Something tells me she might be Biden‚Äôs pick for Vice President or a cabinet position.
This is the right framing. It‚Äôs not for Biden to say that that he would prosecute Trump. Biden should have nothing to do with that.
exactly, the biden campaign was smart and knew if they used like a hot rod that would‚Äôve been a problem, so now only the unhinged side of twitter has a problem which would‚Äôve happened no matter what lol
the biden car ad was good and anyone saying he‚Äôs part of the ruling class for that or whatever just doesn‚Äôt understand the voters he‚Äôs trying to get or just wants something to complain about
the pelosi thing failed to be relatable because everyone was like okay we‚Äôre all unemployed but i‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve got an ice cream freezer i guess, the biden ad about restoring the car? fucking genius and anyone who says otherwise just wants to call him unrelatable lol
I would rather see Dems in office but at the very least these two have foreign policy experience, which is generally what I vote on. It doesn't "appeal" to me but it also doesn't repulse me like Trump does. My ideal 2024 ticket would be Biden's VP and Pete Buttigieg.
Campaign Cash-On-Hand to date Trump: $300,000,000 Biden:  $294,000,000  This is obscene on both their parts, and it has to be changed.
i‚Äôm telling myself i‚Äôm going to vote for biden for harm mitigation but right now i have no idea if i‚Äôll actually be able to cast the vote when i look at that fucking ballot. especially as a survivor :(
The personal critiques against Kamala Harris as a potential VP candidate are SO sexist &amp; invalid. Like her ambition to be president is somehow a bad thing for a VP?? Biden was a VP.. &amp; is now running for presidentüôÑAmbition isn't a bad trait all of a sudden just bc you're a woman
I say it‚Äôs spinach, and I say the hell with it. I hate Trump and I hate Biden. I will be voting for Calvin Coolidge, thank you. Grrrrr.
The truly indelible moment of this campaign will come during the first debate, when Biden strolls out from behind his lectern, grabs Trump's shoulders and sniffs his hair
TRUMP2020 and the sheople and LWNJS can have Biden. Voting Democrat will get you communism.
Someone just DM‚Äôd asking for context for my tirade. I was listening to the 10 o‚Äôclock segment of MSNBC featuring Ari Nelbrr this evening. A guest on the show used ‚Äúqueen‚Äù to refer to the long-awaited black woman VP at the top of the Biden ticket. That‚Äôs it. Good night.
They legitimately think that between Biden and a vaccine, things are going to turn around.
A black woman as ‚Äúqueen‚Äù at the top of the Biden ticket? Oh how I wish we would just retire all this talk of black kings and kings, especially in the realm of electoral politics. I‚Äôm still processing‚Äîyes, still‚Äîthat Biden is the Dem nominee. Alas, this dreadful duopoly.
I support whomever Biden picks.  She will be better than "Mother Approved " Pence!
The problem from my perspective is that a vote for Biden is in some sense of vote for Trump because accepting the neoliberal compromise is what gave us Trump in the first place.  My guess is you don't follow that.  I'll only vote for Biden if he convinces me that he's moved left.
I can't image those are the type of Dems winning in FL, WI, AZ, and NC, all of which have Senate races that year. Biden overwhelmingly won in those states in the primary, AZ will like have incumbent Mark Kelly, and NC and WI will be open seats in states Biden's likely to win.
Biden just riffing on trans ams from now until November... sign me up
Do the politics to make it happen. Don‚Äôt be silly about what you think Biden wants.
The very first bill in the next Congress, which needs to be signed by Pres. Biden immediately after he takes the oath of office - carry the damn thing out to him at the podium from the Capitol Rotunda on Jan 20 - is a Democracy Agenda bill restoring voting rights etc.
He's really killed almost all satire. I can't even watch the Simpsons episode where Homer runs for sanitation commissioner anymore. And Idiocracy feels like a long Biden campaign ad.
leaning in to the onion's joe biden might actually be a smart move?
if only there was something coming up to put joe biden in a position of power where he could save people being evicted.
noted current president with executive power Joe Biden
DOG?! That thing looks about the size of a bear. Granted a cute, friendly bear, but that thing is huge. But it did recognize Biden as a good person, put him/her in ads.
"No debates for you." Biden should say: don't tell a lie for a week and I'll debate you every day until Election Day.
And again, this is going to be the primary fracture line under the Biden administration.  And it could get pretty damn ugly.
have a feeling they‚Äôre just requesting more debates so they can gotcha joe biden if he says no
This is also Gary Gasparov's opinion.  (Remember how shaky Biden seemed, his campaign kind of rudderless.) Another candidate who fleshed out his candidacy as it unfolded, Abraham Lincoln. Read about his Cooper Union speech.)
The Biden of Trumps.  Good luck, buddy. ü§£
I like Rice a lot, but in addition to what you said, I'm not sure if we want to go down the Benghazi rabbit hole again. I'm not saying she did anything wrong, but that doesn't mean she isn't gonna be asked about it 500 times and the right won't try to use it against Biden.
i mean, i'm definitely not worth the time, but if i'm reading this correctly you think it's obvious that Donald Trump is in better mental health than Joe Biden? and it's not even close? that's certainly a take...
There's a reason the Democratic Party keeps Joe Biden in his basement.
Biden hid the truth.  ‚ÄúBiden convened his hearing, which sought the testimony of witnesses hand-picked to sustain the desired conclusion that Iraq was a threat worthy of war. He then went on to vote in support of the use of military force against Iraq‚Äù
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : Biden scraps plans to travel to Milwaukee for nomination acceptance, citing coronavirus concerns
no c‚Äômon biden cares about us. he wants the police to only shoot us in the leg! just the leg meat! no problem.
‚Äúc‚Äômon man, geez!‚Äù - joe biden, i think
I think he should encourage the Democratic Congress to follow the money and let them do their work. HE should not open any investigations but should choose an AG who will support Congressional investigations. Biden cannot be partisan.
the election is in 90 days and my reaction every time i see anything about joe biden is ‚Äúhuh, yeah i forgot about that guy.‚Äù
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
&gt; ‚Äúintentionally gaslighting the whole country allowing thousands of Americans to die‚Äù  Biden has already done that.  Plus hundreds of thousands of Iraqis.
This is not a "Democrats in disarray" take. The party is remarkably unified *at the moment.*  But it's pretty easy to forsee future fault lines, particularly depending on what the Biden administration *knock on wood* does or does not do in 2021.
Digital Offensives are good but they're no substitute for a strong field program.   via
Biden tied in FL, +1 in PA, but +4 in NC and +2 in OH? I don't even know how to respond to that.
All I know is Biden sucks and the neoliberal compromise has failed and that's one  Trump cause.   The notion that what we need at a time of crisis is mediocrity  is beyond me. We don't need status quo Joe. We need someone to address big problems--yesternow.
Until January 2021, when Biden puts  in charge of a national strategy for stopping the spread of the virus.
Tucker Carlson=Racism=Fox News   ‚Å¶ #FireTuckerCarlson
I think Hilary has lost it! We can lump her and Joe Biden together as the ‚ÄúDementia Liberals‚Äù!
Seriously, in an ideal world Biden wouldn't be the nominee in the first place, but can we at least have "the VP pick must piss off the Never Trumpers"?  *Please*?
Biden Agenda for the Latino Community   &gt; three in five Latino families live with limited access to child care-caregivers &amp; early childhood educators disproportionately Latino women &amp; other WOC have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long.
I think you‚Äôve discovered the Biden campaign‚Äôs actual platform on this one.
Biden helped kill half a million people in Iraq.
I know 6 Democratic voters, not counting myself, who liked Elizabeth Warren most, but like Biden, she is East Coast liberal; they overlap each other quite a bit. Its time for a woman and a black woman.
We need to petition Biden.   We're definitely going to need a Commission to Reinstate Irony by January.   Or maybe resuscitate.
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.

When trump loses, AMERICA WINS
Thank you, President Biden.
Trump writes Biden's campaign ads for him
The Clan of the Stable Genius, who keep showing pictures of protests happening NOW, in Trump's America, and trying to blame Biden.   The same fine people who will, be remembered for alternative facting. (Remember your tax scam?)  Y'all really must be campaigning for Joe!
Will they be on video or in the same room? I have a delightful visual of Trump trying to stalk Biden like he did HRC. It ends with a bloody nose.
Unlike POTUS, Biden has been busy making a decision that will be in the best interest of U.S. citizens.
Cue several rounds of, "well, at least the rubes will believe the lies against Joe Biden less."

Donna | Joe Biden For President 2020  #VoteBiden2020 Joe Biden Will Get It Done!
Yeah cause you know Biden is Toast.
The vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that's more attuned to gender and racial biases.
Karen and Kevin have it all figured out! Joe Biden is incoherent and is on the verge of being disqualified! Quack, quack,quack....
Who knows? But I can promise Joe Biden would have no problem whatsoever showing genuine empathy for the 150,000+ who have died from COVID-19.  Trump can't even muster up fake concern.
Trump pardoned a war criminal, vetoed a resolution to end US support for the genocide in Yemen. etc  Biden‚Äôs record is terrible.  Iraq war.  Patriot Act.  Crime bill.  Deregulated Wall St.  No M4A. No GND.  We get more of what we condone &amp; align with.  We should choose carefully.
It wasn‚Äôt a mistake in that Biden deceived the public willfully.    Biden used his Senate committee powers to shut down testimony that would have debunked Bush‚Äôs WMD casus belli.  Hundreds of thousands of people died.  I simply cannot vote for him in good conscience.  Nor Trump.
Someone who feels all forms of authority need be justified, except Joe Biden.
If he wants to just appeal to his base, cool. I just think he should focus on winning if he wants to KAG. He should be killing Biden.
It's like they're campaigning for Biden üòÇ
Can't decide if this is a parody account or if you're actively campaigning for Biden üòÇ
Bernie lost a lot of clout with many of us when he capitulated to a corrupt, racist warmonger.  As he did in 2016.  We weren‚Äôt following Bernie, we were following policies such as M4A &amp; ending the wars.  Here‚Äôs Biden helping Bush invade Iraq.  Dealbreaker.
Trump is the perfect example of that. As soon as he was the nom they all snapped into place. Biden wasn‚Äôt my 1st,2nd,3rd,4th or even 5th choice. He‚Äôs the nom and I will support him on 11/3.
Yet, Biden's actual campaign agreed to the dates. Trump's team did not because of televised football.
Biden's dog could beat Trump in a debate.   Fox would still praise Trump for...speaking?...not tipping over?...showing up?
It would be amusing if Biden decided to head-fake everyone and picked, like, Steny Hoyer for veep
Right, which is why while the Biden campaign is publicly running on Obama nostalgia, internally it's all 1990s nostalgia.  Which is not going to set them up to rise to the challenge of the 2020s.
It's also fuzzy because unlike Barack Obama, Joe Biden was a national political figure in the 1990s.
The one thing I will say‚Äîand it‚Äôs admittedly cold comfort at the moment‚Äîis that this is not a *stable* political dynamic.  The whole premise of the Biden administration is 1990s restorationism, but for a variety of reasons‚Äîabove all economic‚Äîthat‚Äôs impossible.
34) So, if I'm a Democrat, I'm NOT TAKING ANYTHING for granted in Pennsylvania from this poll. NOT ONE THING. And then, what if Pennsylvanian Independents are A) a bit greater than 11%, and B) break for Trump, not Biden?  Warning Will Robinson. Danger. Danger.
33) I'm on the limb here, my Democrat friends. I don't think you have quite that large an edge in Pennsylvania. But, if you only focus on party identification, I can run with it. What I can't do, is give Biden the enthusiasm edge. I don't see it.
3) Before diving in, look at this quote:  "Joe Biden has an overall early lead in the state of 6 percentage points, according to RealClearPolitics‚Äô polling average, and has led Trump in all 12 public polls released since the beginning of June."
2) And would you look at this headline and sub-headline!  ‚ÄòHating Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt juice up their base‚Äô: Key swing state slips away from Trump  Trump has trailed in every public poll in Pennsylvania since June.
Biden's dog would wipe the floor with Trump. üôÑ
Clyburn endorsing Biden reminded me of when John Lewis spoke about civil rights and said he'd never seen Bernie at civil rights events.  John Lewis was to Hillary Clinton what Jim Clyburn was to Joe Biden.

Imagine. A leader, responsible enough to curtail large events during a global pandemic.   A leader, who has well thought out plans of action, which he shares with the voters.   All of this, and more, can be ours with Biden.   No more intentional, malevolent chaos.   I can't wait!

Report: Biden Will Roll Back Israel to Pre-Trump Days
It's definitely going to be more hawkish than the Obama Presidency. Obama inherited the mess in Iraq and was hesitant to have his FP legacy defined as the POTUS that started the Cold War with China. We're well past that point now so Biden's advisors are free to be more hawkish.
I do. Not voting for Biden is a vote for the complete destruction of our country.

538 poll selections have shown Arizona, N. Carolina, and Wisconsin trending into Biden majority.
Ask Biden a question. Oh, that‚Äôs right
Know how wearing a mask reduces the spread of COVID-19, but doesn‚Äôt completely eliminate it? We wear them anyway because of all the lives we could save.  Voting Biden/Harris is not much different. We will still have to protest on January 20th, but it‚Äôll be better than not voting.
If you are on fb, join us in Suburban Housewives for Biden/Harris. New group that began yesterday.
I created a FB group - Suburban Housewives for Biden/Harris yesterday. We are ~1900+ mbrs + 900 pdg. We would like to attend
Wow, you had the question for 5 years? did you mean to ask it to Obama/Biden back then?... You should have...we would have respected you for it, but not now. By the way, Biden is available for you to ask him that.
Biden is just noisy chatter if he refuses to answer questions and defend his positions. Hard to take him seriously until he does.
Cast your vote for Donald Trump . Interesting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are advocating where are your mask until after the election
Kamala Harris or Joe Biden has anything to do with it. They will probably start to dismantle any possible piece in the Middle East first they will start with their destruction of Israel and then they will move troops back into the Middle East
Peace deal between Israel &amp; UAE.  #PresidentTrump bravo to you &amp;  #Netanyahu &amp; #MohamedBinZayed  We must win election  #Trump2020 Biden &amp; comrades here &amp; workdwide. We must keep our promises to Israel. Biden would destroy agreement &amp; bow to Israel‚Äôs enemy, Iran.
Looks like there might be a Confederate flag behind Biden
Just a little looking forward should if and I certainly hope not. Federal troops will be roaming the streets on the first day that Biden or Harris have the authority to put them there they are using these people and then they will crush them it's happened before and now again
Reason number 16,720 why voting for Biden/Harris is a must. If you don‚Äôt vote for them this cycle, I hope this weighs on your conscience.  They are not my ideal ticket. I voted Bernie, but we failed. Trump/Pence is much, much worse than Biden/Harris. Keep protesting. Keep voting.
It‚Äôs impressive, isn‚Äôt it? Biden was elected 7 times by Delaware voters to represent them in the Senate. We‚Äôre lucky to have such a knowledgable &amp; experienced candidate running for POTUS in 2020, particularly given the situation our country is in.  BTW - you misspelled Forty.
The speeches yesterday at Biden/Harris event - or are you joking or being sarcastic and i'm missing it?
Let me ask you a very simple question...do you think Jim Clyburn, John Lewis and other black civil rights leaders in this country are stupid? Why do you think Biden has such strong support from that community? Because he‚Äôs a fascist who wants to crack their heads?
So that was all Biden‚Äôs doing? Biden is acknowledging mistakes and the need for police reforms. Trump wants the most vicious cops to be thugs, stay on the beat and kill people. I‚Äôll take Biden over that and Trump‚Äôs white nationalist militias any day.
No it isn‚Äôt. It shows how easily defeated you are. Like it or not, Biden is the only defense against an even more brutal fascist crackdown if Trump is re-elected. What do you think is going to happen to immigrants, elderly &amp; working poor in a 2nd Trump term? Do you like cruelty?
Biden made comments to donors in early 2019 that he wasn‚Äôt going to turn the socio-economic order upside down. You equate that to meaning there will be no progressive reforms or major policy initiatives in a Biden Admin. Ask progressive legislators you trust what they think.
Watch my WGN News interview about Biden + Harris
Yep, Russian trolls are out on social media peddling lies about Harris‚Äô record as a prosecutor to split the black vote. They are going to interfere in the election however they can because Putin wants Trump in office, not Biden. America is a socialist country now if you‚Äôre rich.
IT‚ÄôS MY BIRTHDAY!!!  Remember this election isn‚Äôt just Biden vs Trump! It‚Äôs Good vs Evil! It‚Äôs America vs Trump! Science vs Ignorance! Inclusion vs Hate!!!! #AmericaOrTrump #AmericaOrTrump #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #VoteBidenHarris2020 üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
So excited Biden/Harris 2020 üíôüíôüëèüèæüëèüèæ
A system steeped in slavery and segregation can only be changed by activists working inside the political system to change it. Biden will support progressive reforms, he‚Äôs not going to overturn the socio-economic order. But that‚Äôs better than the psychopaths we have in the WH now
I feel ya. But I‚Äôm still voting Biden/Harris. I see it as a gateway
She is going to be an awesome VP running mate for Biden. Tough, smart, warm, great personal story, and the ability to articulate a strong vision for progressive change.
No, I‚Äôm sure you had plenty of company. Kamala Harris is a great Vice Presidential running mate for Biden.
She is going to be a great running mate for Biden. She will prosecute Trump‚Äôs failed record and also lay out a progressive vision for social, economic and political change.
I think some may miss the dual point of this story - that Biden is a father who gives a shit about his children and your children. Both speeches are very strategic and I‚Äôm here for it.
Not sure why people thought Rice was going to get it. She is entangled with the FISA abuse in Obamagate. Biden has enough legal issues to worry about. Harris is still an awful pick
There will be children born whose names are going to be Biden Harris.
surrogates still traipsing out this ‚ÄúBiden is in the basement‚Äù line when we have more evidence of Biden interactions w/voters and making relevant speeches while 45 plays golf and bumbles thru interviews &amp; wanders off topic. üòè#PersonWomanManCameraTV
While you actively support Biden. Remember Biden said you ain‚Äôt black unless you vote him. Or what about his remark that black lack diversity? Lets not forget Biden‚Äôs role in the mass incarceration of Black men. You are such an expert on looking the other way at overt racism.
Kamala is just Biden's caretaker? ü§î
Congratulations Senator Harris. And, Vice President Biden. You form a great Democratic ticket!
Biden was comparing the circumstances of today to those of the 1960s &amp; his underlying message was to not sit on the sidelines &amp; complain but take action. It‚Äôs a mischaracterization to say he doesn‚Äôt care about the problems today‚Äôs youth face. He‚Äôll address climate &amp; student debt.
Both for paid leave. Biden for 12 weeks of family and medical leave, does not state how much of wage. Kamala is for up to 6 months of family and medical leave covering up to $75,000 of full wage replacement.
There are those of us who have embedded in local Dem committees and have already spoken to down ballot reps as well as gotten a UBI resolution voted through to be sent to VA state reps by the Biden delegates. When you participate you get access to direct access
Both ran on decriminalizing marijuana and expunging records. Biden's website lacks marijuana policy but his previous on record policies have been to decriminalize, expunge, and look at the science to let the states decide.  Kamala states full legalization.
Keeping notes for myself and whoever else wants to see the Biden and Kamala policy agreements from their individual campaigns, and their current policies on their duo campaign.
The Trump Campaign in 2020 is truly one of the worst campaigns of all time when the ball was always in their court.  In no way does the average voter believe Kamala Nor Biden are part of the "far left" (I wish they were).  He continues to pander to his 30-40% of idiot voters.
Left wing lolol the ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù are freaking out and screaming and crying about not only Biden but this pick. Meanwhile those of us who vote are pretty cool cool with this tickets. Let‚Äôs go!
Bad pick Biden lol!!!
Bad pick Biden, my moderate Democrat GF won‚Äôt vote for you now because you picked a bad VP canadate, anyone else but Harris lol!!!!üòÇ I suspect a lot of moderate Dems feel the same!!!!
I gave you a twitter list of progressive issues that contrast Biden from Trump. Sanders &amp; Biden had a joint task force which moved Biden in 6 policy areas &amp; AOC was named to co-chair Biden‚Äôs climate task force. Biden is listening &amp; there will be more progress when he is POTUS.
biden said here üòå this is what u wanted right? üòå
Great choice Biden-Harris sounds great! On to victory in November
Who are you trying to fool?? Joe Biden is such a racist!!
Love Biden‚Äôs VP pick. Go Kamala Harris and the Biden campaign
this PROVES biden isn't sexist and/or racist! his running mate is female and black! hell yeah go politics
College football 2020 is dying, Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick, and I went inside a grocery store for the first time since February. Most eventful day of the summer!
Dave, I don‚Äôt think you appreciate how far the Democratic Party has moved in the past 4 years &amp; the importance of staying in the game even when your candidate loses. 4 years ago Bernie Sanders, AOC &amp; other Social Dems did not have the influence they have today. Biden is listening
Never done this before.  I‚Äôm a registered Republican.  But I‚Äôm going to #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt  Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Joe Biden‚Äôs advisors told him he has selected a running mate
The ‚Äútake away close‚Äù vote in mass to give Biden landslide. Show the power block of 18-29, then you have leverage when you say you will take that away. No other action gives something valuable, then can take away later. This is how you show them.
Biden acknowledges past mistakes and attempts to atone for them. I‚Äôll take Obama and leaders of the Congressional black caucus and civil rights movement as character references for him. What do you have for Trump?
This election is basically do you want to stall US disintegration with Biden until we get a progressive President or do you increase US destruction with Trump. Very interesting dynamic.
Vice President doesn't matter for Biden. Those who say they won't for Biden because of "X VP Pick" just wanted another excuse to not vote Biden when they already had many by looking at his record.
Besides the 30-40% of far rights who will never abandon Trump, the Republican party still has a base who aren't too fond of Trump. They see Kasich and other non-Trump Republicans unite with Biden and it will away a small but noticeable voter block.
Putting aside Biden = Republican Light  and All current Republicans = Bad, Kasich realized that being on the side of Trump is on the wrong side of history. He's smart to realize this and the democratic party centrists will be welcoming him with open arms
Character counts. Biden has it, Trump doesn‚Äôt. Biden is learning &amp; reaching out, he‚Äôs not senile &amp; demented. Democratic socialists who equate Biden to Trump are not serious about electoral politics &amp; will sit on the sidelines &amp; merely judge &amp; complain about the world around them.
Biden is said he will undo Trump‚Äôs tax giveaway to the rich. If that‚Äôs your beef that Biden won‚Äôt go after plutocrats money hard enough then you are missing a lot of issues that matter.
Who did he say that to and when? The differences between Biden and Trump on a wide range of issues are huge and there is no comparison who is the more progressive candidate. Never Biden is being pro-Trump. It‚Äôs a binary choice between the two who will be elected POTUS in November
Mayor Pete is another centrist that won't advance the country forward like Biden and the rest of his cabinet. However I will always take them over the alternative fascists in red.  Once (if) they are in the office they must be bullied on the daily.
I hope you‚Äôll reconsider. Biden will move our country in a progressive direction at a time it is desperately needed. He will advance climate, health care, social/environmental justice, gun laws, election reform, tax fairness, judiciary appts, DC statehood, immigration reform, etc
Biden lol
Biden is fine. Even if he was in decline, he isn‚Äôt dangerous and unstable like Trump. Trump does not care at all about what damage he could do to the country.
Weird flex, dude. They prefer Biden bc they know he isn‚Äôt a tantrum throwing weirdo...
Just a reminder: the Revolutionary Communist Party endorsed Joe Biden last week.
The ads for the Democrats and Biden write themselves with this.
Last night‚Äôs whitmer meet was to change the narrative for the day from attention to Biden‚Äôs not great week.
We MUST deliver the West for VP Biden!! Let‚Äôs go!!
Blacks are not your puppets and Biden is as racist as every other democrat!
I think a Biden Presidency would be funnier than a Trump one. With Trump its the same old lying, pivoting, and self gloating but with EVERY Biden speech there's gonna be something new due to cognitive decline.  We could literally hear an N word bomb cause he forgot he cant say it
True, but Never Trump means you‚Äôre for Biden or it doesn‚Äôt mean a thing.
No one is going to hurt God. Not Biden, not left wing crazies bent on destroying America with their bleeding hearts. Not so long as the Christian soldiers have anything to say about it. Now if they could just be taught not to use the Bible for target practice...
You celebrate Confederate Generals who committed treason to preserve the evil institution of slavery and advocate for racist policies. We know what is in Biden‚Äôs heart and what is in your heart. Biden is a good man. You have a dark and evil soul.
As a veteran of special operations community I can tell you ST6 toots their own horn more than any politician, they would have outed themselves if Biden didn‚Äôt. Look at the dude that made the Coup de Gras shot, he wrote a book about it, so pick a better example.
We‚Äôll see. Biden will expose Trump‚Äôs lies, corruptions, incompetency, and leadership failures. Trump has no record of success to fall back on, just BS.
Biden has nothing. His plan is only one subject - no Trump.  TDS in full swing.  Take a bitter pill on November 4 and try to recover from your disorder
For 47 years Biden has been a racist and all the sudden we want us to think that he has become a person that's not
All Biden tickets are losers
Thank you for the clarification Crime bill Joe Biden. if u wanna reverse that legacy then do things like M4All, or ending the drug war starting with legalizing marijuana that disproportionately targets African Americans and other minorities
Mass extinction is underway and the planet is heating up but it‚Äôs not even a major topic at this time. I hope, and expect, Biden will get our country re-engaged and also listen to the far reaching proposals contained in the Green New Deal. Otherwise we‚Äôre speeding to disaster.
The only case for Biden is he‚Äôs not Trump. Good luck with that
#Virginia #democrats A Virginia Night for Joe Biden Tickets, Tue, Aug 11, 2020 at 5:00 PM | Eventbrite
Does he do that on purpose? Pretend not to get it? Doesn‚Äôt see getting Biden out of the basement would be a good thing?
Oh man Biden better choose carefully. He‚Äôs gonna need as many New York City Republicans as possible to vote for him if he wants to carry NY state üôÑ
I know someone who is 105 and makes Biden look like he‚Äôs 150The frustrating thing is that is seems exaggerated and ridiculous when you read it in the emails but I know people whose facebook posts read exactly like this. Like how do you even respond to someone who honestly believes Joe Biden is a socialist??
That‚Äôs right Paris. The rioters are actually funded by the DNC. What I find amazing is the you believe that Joe Biden has the power to stop all this. An excellent reason to vote for him in November!  Thanks for the endorsement
This was an eloquent, and thereby joyous description of why Biden's choice of Kamala Harris was, perfect. When logic and instinct are realized, when mind and heart say the same thing, there is joy.
Biden is the new FDR and we have all coming down with a case of being Japanese-American
Just printed Biden's climate action plan to read. Pretty bulky, 25 pages. Thought, wonder what Trump has put out. Why would I even wonder that? It's a paragraph. Three sentences. And it denies climate change's existence. Please vote against this man.
How much are you donating to the Biden/Harris campaign?  You have been stumping for Kamala for 2 days now. Keep up the good work.
I am voting for Biden.
Joe Biden's silence on this issue is deafening.
I noticed neither Biden nor Harris mentioned mass shootings as one of the big problems we face.
Here‚Äôs to hoping they get to debate, while also praying that VP Biden &amp; Trump never EVER, under any cirmcustance share a debate stage
Joe Biden has a framed Hagar the Horrible strip in his office
#LetYangSpeakDNC The DNC doesn't want the: asian, nerd, progressive, logical, intelligent vote. Just like 2016 they know what their doing. Biden is a sure thing....
Good thing Biden and Harris are experienced with how govt should run. Biden should have staff prepared for this. His cabinet picks should be able to work on Day One. I‚Äôm sure they know this will probably happen and will plan for it. We need a fully staffed and functioning govt.
#LetYangSpeakDNC biden doesn't want to be outshined so if  speaks He'll have to go first (while the cameras are setting up, or in the parking lot to the #yanggang who only showed up for the prize fighter.)
We don‚Äôt need to pretend like Biden is going to be president for any reason other than being associated with Obama
Are you serious? Biden is a catholic! Do your homework
Cornyn is effing terrified. Down ballot voting will be his demise. Vote Biden/ Harris and  in November.
Okay, it‚Äôs Harris. Live with it and VOTE BIDEN you people!
Lay off the communion wine, Bishop; Biden is Catholic.
Namaste, Kamala.üôèThe deepest respect, and so too to Joe Biden. No matter the outcome, the intent is compassionate effort to promote the virtues of honesty, decency  and loving kindness, and those are worth fighting for.
Policing is a major issue coming up today with Kamala being chosen. A Biden DOJ can enforce force decrees in problematic police departments, a small start. Vote local for bigger reforms on these issues: prosecutors and sheriffs are a lot more powerful than the VP on this
Yeah. The fact that it's come down to these two shows how rotten this country's social fabric has become. Imagine having someone like Warren or Bernie but voting for the old neo-liberal war hawks in big 2020. In any other developed country, Biden would be considered Right Wing
Yep. Fwiw, I don't think Biden is that much better than trump. The only reason any true progressive should vote for Biden is to deny the conservatives to take over the Supreme Court and destroy this country. Also, climate change. Otherwise they're the same on every other issue
When is Trump going to announce his VP pick?
Willie Brown's girlfriend passed the sniff test Kamala to Biden: I don't think you are a racist but...
*satirical story time with uncle sam*  K: ‚Äújoe biden is a racist‚Äù J: ‚Äúwanna bet?‚Äù  *announces vp decision* K: ‚Äújoe will be the savior of the free world and is only racist towards oompa loompas!‚Äù
I am so happy about your pick as Biden‚Äôs running mate.
The complete lack of ticket splitting that now occurs means that Biden might end up winning a few states (GA, NC, IA, MT, AZ) because the senate candidate (and governor in the case of NC) is running ahead of him
(Stifling a mirthful laugh every time I see another "Biden's V.P. is named Imminent" Twitter joke.)
I do feel we need to see Biden make sound choices. The VP will be the first. I think all on the list would be great so I‚Äôm not worried. We need logic and common sense back in our govt. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Biden's America of the future: Everyone to be tagged and traced during relocation to your nearest declining major city.
Valid point but Biden is a straight up pedophile it‚Äôs a lose lose type of election ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I call it Good Master Syndrome. Biden feels his racism is OK because he's keeping Blacks from being sold to the bad master. It explains all the violence and racism against African Americans by white AntiFa. Their racism is a virtue in their eyes.
Bernie is Bernie, Biden is more like "weekend at Bernie's"
President Pelosi. President Biden.   Any one of these is a lot better than the wannabe-Hitler in the White House.   #ProtectOurVotes #LetUsVote #ONEV1
Can anyone who plans on voting for Biden explain why, but without mentioning Trump?
To everyone whitesplaining Biden's comments (to Black folks no less), can you just full-on stop?  Ok. Thanks.  African Americans Black Americans
You literally wrote "four years of Trump‚Äôs chaos, incompetence, corruption, narcissism, nepotism, racism, authoritarianism and nihilism..."  And that's not enough to vote for Biden?
"The Justice Department is not the president's private law firm. The attorney general is not the president's private lawyer. I will not interfere with the Justice Department's judgment..." - Joe Biden. Such a radically liberal position!Oh, and by the way what about Hillary Clinton's character? Joe Biden character?
Opening salvo by  about national mask mandate was a mistake. Should have been healthcare, COVID recovery, or even save the Post Office. Biden should clarify he will not muzzle the people through the use of EOs and rule by fiat like Trump. #BidenHarris2020 #Election2020
made a mistake with an opening salvo implying a national mask mandate. Should have been healthcare, COVID relief, or even "we will save the Post Office." Biden needs to clarify he does not plan to muzzle the people through rule by fiat &amp; EO like Trump. #BidenHarris2020
Every liberal talking point about Biden, Trump, and the 2020 election is predicated on a frightening ignorance of US history.
The nightmare would be if you and Biden Are elective. We would be the communist country of the United States.
‚ÄúThe country‚Äôs most outspoken critic of voting by mail has requested his vote-by-mail ballot.‚Äù
I mean Biden said himself ‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change‚Äù. We have a party on the right and then one in the center that has more and more people pulling away every day. A 3rd party is needed now more than ever.
The great Salena Zito has seen some Biden signs in her travels, but they're outnumbered several times over by Trump signs.
Wtf #ComradesAssemble we never approved #khive fuck Biden. We ain't falling in line. Force DNC to lose 2020 so the people can take 2022. Let's see your strategy in VA 5th. The left falling in line more like waiting for #octoberuprising is going to show you who the Republicans are

"We all agree on the need to reopen the economy and allow some semblance of normalcy as soon as possible."  -Joe Biden  That doesn't seem substantially different to me.
I'm glad someone is writing everything down. Fuck Biden by the way. I had to say it. Now I feel better
This woman is an ambitious nightmare. I'm praying and working hard for a 2020 Trump re-election but if Biden wins and Kamala ends up taking over his job, the DNC and Congress will wish they never picked her for his running mate!!! She's a BITCH
‚ÄúThis is America. Be a patriot. Protect your fellow citizens. Step up, do the right thing.‚Äù said Biden.
Gonna need some [citation] on those Biden claims
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Virginia educators celebrate Joe Biden‚Äôs school reopening plan
I will be proudly voting for Biden/Harris!
Biden and Harris go on about how Trump is doing during the virus. Dems did NOTHING! They were involed with impeachment! Period. THEY wrote off the virus. They are full of shhhtuff. Trump started attacking it in Jan. Pelosi laughed it off! #WalkAway #KAG2020 #TheFive #Tucker
In a statement, Biden's campaign said the president is "sabotaging a basic service that hundreds of millions of people rely upon."
I don‚Äôt know where they are but I sure wish they‚Äôd start doing SOMETHING to help Biden/Harris!
That Jackass Biden said he's happy about the peace deal between Israel and UAE. That it was because of work he did with Obama. They actively interfered with Isreal elections! They did nothing. Dems accuse you for evil they do and take credit for good you do. #WalkAway #KAG2020

So QAnon Greene is going to win congressional seat in Georgia.  abandons left to get Republicans against Trump. First question I'm going to ask Biden's VP Take a look at VA 5th tell me what Republicans are going against Trump. Ask  about radicals #ComradeCollab
But we are putting an end to this nonsense that's why were kicking Trump to the curb and electing Biden/Harris 2020. Trump's done enough damage to the country.
I have to say I'm in for Biden-Harris.
Biden don't and she is going to work for her "clients" not people #noterfvp

I was for Amy. Biden chose Harris. I‚Äôm all in for Biden/Harris. I trust Joe. The alternative is 7 kinds of crazy. Biden/Harris!!!!
This was an entire article about two people who said completely rational things. All while sending a message of unity and hope to the country in a time of crisis.  Who ever thought this would be some sort of treasured novelty?
Fox News Insists That Joe Biden Didn‚Äôt Really Pick Kamala Harris. WTF?!!
YES! Except for the part when I sat in the oncology waiting room and the MAGA folks were talking about how the country was going to ruin if Biden was elected, because he was bringing in the new world order. How misinformed can people be? I asked them to please not talk politics.
Kamala Harris is expected to play a prominent role in fundraising for the campaign.
So is Joe Biden disrespectful because he pronounced it the same way?
#KamalaChameleon was in 5th place in her own state! Why would anyone think that would get Biden over the top?!  #WalkAway #KAG2020 #Tucker
So is Joe Biden a racist?
remember when everyone made fun of trump cause he only half filled a huge arena during covid. Biden and comma got a nice little church crowd though
So is it the same when Biden mispronounces the name of Chameleon Kamala the EXACT same way #Tucker did?!!  Or is it he's a dem so the same rules don't apply?! Basic journalism is anything but CNN.  #WalkAway #KAG2020
Don‚Äôt pretend to be taking some kind of nuanced high road here. Four of your seven criticisms of Biden are of his appearance. You should be ashamed of yourself. #FakePriest
I read something about this in 2015 or 16. It was about how Bernie and Hillary had intentionally cultivated first-name brands (I don‚Äôt recall the rationale). Regardless, Harris and Biden haven‚Äôt done that.
The whole thing is really odd. Like: most of these insults are more fitted to Trump. I would never describe Biden as ‚Äútan.‚Äù
"He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
Biden/Harris all the way!  Excited
why even give Biden Harris coverage when middle class America is in a financial stranglehold by the idiots on the hill? Because the FBI, Green New Deal and convention lineup  are wwaayy more important..
WHAT???    Goes straight to Biden and Harris. Truly....Who are these two people?
True, learning from media is not better like learning by direct contact.  My twin sister was in hospital for surgery, in case if you wonder where I am.  You should strict of defend and attack only the Biden, and let Vice President does it with Harris.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
Hear from Joe Biden and his pick for VP, Kamala Harris ‚¨áÔ∏è
WATCH: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris appear together one day after Harris becomes Biden's running mate for the 2020 Presidental Election.
Biden is just the Forgetful Pedophile.. but Democrats seem to think that is "ok"..üôÑ Pathetic!
Or even Biden as VP with Obama..
He was way ahead until the MSM and the DNC rallied around Biden, with the help of other candidates strategically dropping out and endorsing Biden before Super Tuesday. He was robbed.
Trump and Biden have enough coverage to show how bad they are so why not looking for a 3rd option? Settling for the less corrupt is just wrong. It can be a vote for trump but if all the anti trump people voted for a third party instead of a lightweight trump it wouldnt be wasted
Kamala Harris is the perfect VP for Biden. When either one of them opens their mouths, you know they're going to blow it
This is about making sure the Supreme Court and the justice system isn‚Äôt turned into an extreme conservative activist organization, about healthcare, about closing the gap. Biden/Harris won‚Äôt achieve everything but they won‚Äôt be actively working against these things like Trump.
And fwiw...Biden nor Harris were not even in my top 3. There are serious and valid concerns with both of them. But goddamn if I‚Äôm not #BidenHarris2020 full throttle up in this piece.
She was picked to replace Joe Biden
There‚Äôs a difference between trump messing up timelines once in a while vs Biden who every single time he speaks it sounds like mindless rambling and making no sense and forgetting things like the Declaration of Independence
The woman who called him racist and believes his sexual assault accusers is now his #1 fan huh. Biden probably already forgot who she is honestly
#SorosAP confirms Heels Up Harris will replace Biden either on the ticket or on Inauguration Day -- IF they won
Suburban housewife for BIDEN/HARRIS!!
I'm not at all interested in vote shaming anyone supporting this ticket, but if we have a Biden/Harris term(s), we cannot then just forget about their records, get complacent, and turn them into heroes for saving us from Trump as liberals did and still do with Obama.

Joe Biden told America that his running mate was Kamla harris great that all we need cry baby and Kamla harris. is the next Michael Obama watch out world
Not only is Biden a pedophile but he is a liar!
Here‚Äôs how prominent Virginians reacted to Joe Biden‚Äôs choice of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as his vice presidential running mate.
I agree with the ‚Äòagenda‚Äô. But one thing I asked myself in earnest after Biden named his VP pick is why she would join him after she stated her distaste for Hume early in the primary. ü§î
He always mad bout something. üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ  "President Trump responds to Kamala Harris‚Äô selection as Biden‚Äôs VP and political analysts look at how it might impact the race"
I agree with Stephen Colbert. ‚ÄúThank god it‚Äôs Kamala. I was worried Biden was going to pick someone else who would have made me absolutely still vote for him no matter what‚Äù.
The stock market this morning tells you all you need to know about Biden/Harris
I'm sure there is plenty of room for distancing, it'll just be her, Biden, Obama, an oversized poster of himself, a set of golf clubs, a klan hood, copies of Mein Kampf, and Gaslighting for Dummies (A Dummies Guide to Gaslighting Dummies), and a semi-nude photo of Sean Hannity.
Biden/Harris says "We like Trump's policies, we just wouldn't like to go to brunch with him"
I won't breathe a sigh of relief until Trump is on the Marine helicopter after Biden has been sworn in.
IMO the genuine beliefs Biden seem to be relatively conservative; Kerry is a mixed bag. Edwards and Harris seem to hold few genuine beliefs and how right/left they are is probably entirely due to what resonates in the era they‚Äôre running in
They're just in the honeymoon period right now. Not a lot about the Biden campaign to get excited about, this gives them SOMEthing, so they'll play it up as much as they can. The news content beast requires constant feeding; they'll latch on to anything new.
Strategically, keeping Warren in the Senate makes more sense. She will have a major influence on the Biden administration, though, without any doubt.

Reaction pours in for Harris as Biden‚Äôs historic VP pick
k I‚Äôm gonna need y‚Äôall to stop equating Biden/Harris with Trump/Pence as if everything‚Äôs been GREAT these past 4 years..üòí  Everything aside, as hard as it may seemü•¥ this really shouldn‚Äôt be a difficult decision.
people: abolish the fucking police biden: we hear you, here‚Äôs Kamala :)
Almost entirely out of coincidence, joe Biden and Kamala Harris were the first blue candidates I ever donated money to (first Harris, then Biden) and we‚Äôre the first politicians I signed up for newsletters from
He better have these advisors debate for him because a senile Biden can‚Äôt even remember what he‚Äôs running for or where he is half the time basically, he will create a million gaffes during them if he even will go through with it. Dems needed a stronger candidate
Kamala is a good pick because Biden‚Äôs other options were a cartoon assault rifle or a sentient pair of handcuffs
Bring it on, she‚Äôs to dishonest to handle Trump. Plus, isn‚Äôt it Biden who should be debating?  Hmmmmm
Yeah. We all know why he hosted beauty pageants. Pretty sure nobody in the U.S. thinks Trump isn't dirty in multiple senses of the term. But the Dems decided to pick a candidate who doesn't pose the best contrast on that issue, and a VP who said she believes Biden's accusers.
Trump. Biden and Harris are both empty vessels being manipulated by others. I'd rather pick randomly from a phone book. And I don't know which outcome is likely to lead to the least violence after the election, I fear we're in for more widespread rioting either way.
I‚Äôm joe Biden and I forgot this uhh don‚Äôt you know, you know the thing..
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris, the Most Sensible VP Choice
Biden/Harris will be very easy to vote for.
Virginia, Biden is ahead by 10 points rn
WATCH: Pres. Trump says Sen. Kamala Harris was his, "number one pick" for Biden's VP running mate. (Source: POOL)
Ok Biden fans, why should I vote for the old rich man and the cop? They‚Äôre not gonna change anything, why should I vote for Republicans with a D next to their names instead of the Green Party candidate who was endorsed by the DSA?
Lmao if you think Biden and Kamala are the radical left, you need to study up on the political compass..
"This is history. Kamala is a trailblazer who will serve this country well as the first Black and Asian American woman on a major party's ticket."
Exactly where Biden has been hiding for 6 months.
A few of my followers are upset that Biden picked Kamala to be his running mate. These same people also claim to hate Trump, so here‚Äôs my question, what‚Äôre y‚Äôall gonna do come November?
bro i'm ALL for Warren, I love any true progressive.    Does Warren have to give up her seat?  I remember Biden keeping his Senator role and even breaking "ties" on the floor.... if we keep her presence in the senate i'd love it.  but i doubt we do
how do I vote for biden Harris ticket? Has the Khive pushed Harris "progressive left" enough? I need more than just "defeat trump". I'm going to be a climate refugee in 10 years.
Trump is trash, Biden is trash, the american political system is all trash. Burn it all down tbh
WATCH: Pres. Trump says he was, "more surprised than anything else" by Biden's VP pick because, "she did so poorly in the primaries." (Source: POOL)
Until we do away with our stupid two party system it's always going to come down to that, unfortunately. I'm voting for #BidenHarris2020, not because I love Joe Biden, but because he's the best chance to kick that nasty POS out of office.

Biden, you're a moron. Nice way to show the people you're listening, dumbass
Agreed,I've never been more disgusted by the Democratic Party than I am right now, there isn't a possible way they could have put up a worse ticket.That being said I will still vote and vote Democratic.I can't say it, I can't say "I will vote Biden/Harris". I will but can'tsay it

Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Biden selects Kamala Harris as running mate
That‚Äôs exactly what I think. Trump‚Äôs been harping on Biden wanting to defund the police. She will be all over that
BREAKING: Joe Biden has selected Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP running mate
#BREAKING Joe Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his running mate.
BREAKING: Joe Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP running mate
The Associated Press reports an announcement is imminent. We are standing by.
Biden selects running mate, expected to be revealed as early as today, reports say
And if there are no debates it‚Äôs because Biden will refuse to do them, trump whether hated or not it‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôs excited to debate Biden. I‚Äôm sure he will be called a ‚Äúlying dog faced pony solider‚Äù a few times lol
Trump is far from perfect but if the best the Dems got is Biden then all Dems should not feel to confident about that. And come on man it‚Äôs clear Biden has some degree of dementia. He can‚Äôt even remember where he is, he can‚Äôt remember the Declaration of Independence etc etc
Trump is skeevy, too. Hell, he used to hang out with Bill Clinton. I'd much rather have a random person out of a phone book than either of these old grifters. But saying Joe Biden is a "seize the moment" candidate is ridiculous.
I thought maybe he would not give notice of the announcement so Trumpty Dumpty can‚Äôt try to call a presser to take away the attention from Biden.
Reminder that if Hillary had won, 0 sports would not have been cancelled. Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania all have teams that play in the Big Ten. Because of 45 there will be no fall college sports. Vote Biden.
This movement is growing and fast. So many people feel like they can not relate to either party‚Äôs towed line anymore. If a Dem speaks out against Biden then they get attacked, if a Repub speaks out against Trump they are attacked. Its so exhausting for a growing number of people
Theory: Trump continues to announce/do ridiculous things to get headlines and blunt Biden's VP announcement. Biden recognizes this strategy - he is trying to maneuver to capitalize on the least crazy to get his own headlines with his VP announcement #Election2020 #Veepstakes
Biden is mentally incapable, forget political agendas the man is just too old, he probably won‚Äôt debate because he will ramble incoherently, he can rarely remember where he is. He tells people they aren‚Äôt black if they don‚Äôt vote for him. Oh and let‚Äôs not forget dementia
I'm baffled by it. He's the reason TX is a possibility for Biden, I certainly wouldn't snub him on this.  Indeed, #LetBetoSpeak!
I bet Joe Biden knows the 1918 pandemic didn't end World War II.
...investagations than Hillary Clinton ever did. And finally, how many charges of Biden harassing women or children as compared to Trumps 40+ accusations? One of which was the rape of a 13 year old girl.
Green is good but not this time. Please don't throw away your vote. We need it. It is wasteful. Vote for Biden and your vote will be repurposed, not floating in the ocean like plastic.
He lost because every person between him in first place and Biden in last place dropped out at basically the same time. Let‚Äôs not forget that DNC rally the troops bullshit now.
40 years of  in DC says he's not the person you're looking for. But I don't blame you for saying this. You can almost smell that VP nomination, like Biden smelling a young woman's hair.
That will still be owed when tax time comes around. I dislike both Biden and Trump but these executive orders were nothing more than a smoke show to create more hysteria amongst people who support either side blindly.
Yea every person who dropped out was ahead of Biden and behind Bernie. Think about that for a minute. Why would everyone drop out except the person who was losing the most?
Flabbergasted! Twilight Zone!  is lying ‚ÄúBAHAHAHA‚Äù BUT the BIGGER news here isn‚Äôt Biden lying; we are use to that; it‚Äôs the Media!!!! This is HOW it‚Äôs supposed to be you know them telling the truth NOT covering it up! Oh the good old days when the Media was informative!
Yes, because you said the only difference between Biden and Trump is that Biden will have more support when doing fascism and genocide and that is absurd
This is insane. I spent dozens of hours texting and calling and campaigning for Bernie. And I hate Biden on a real level. But if you think Biden will be more authoritarian than Trump (since even the protofascist hasn't illegalized having opinions and being poor) you're just wrong
The Senate is America‚Äôs Most Structurally Racist Institution
When Biden occasionally misspeaks, I remind myself that he knows the real answer, and truly just misspoke. When Trump misspeaks, I remind myself that he also knows the real.....er, that he knows WWII ended 27 yrs after...um, that....oh, hell, never mind.
I will crawl through broken glass to vote for Biden and his running mate.
He is such an ignorant man. The 1918 pandemic (NOT 1917) was over before World War II even began. And he wants to try to paint Biden as cognitively impaired. I don't think that will go well.
Not sure who appears more indecisive right now: Joe Biden on his VP pick, or the NCAA on the fate of college football this fall. #CollegeFootball #Election2020
SMH ... this is a lie; just more BS to try to make people dislike him more than they already do; you are the Media stop being the Lefts puppet and report real news &amp; maybe instead of this report how lies are spreading more than Biden being confused or sex trafficking! REAL NEWS!
Sorry but we are already in a Nazi Germany with trump in office!! Are you kidding me!!!? Where do u people get this shit? He's ignored constitution and done what he's wanted. No checks on him! We are in hell right now! Biden will save us and most Americans believe this!!!

Did biden write that post for you because your english is choppy
Biden has been racist all of his life!
What‚Äôs the strategy here, don‚Äôt support either and have no influence on the election at all. One of the two is going to win. I haven‚Äôt heard reason more compelling than what I tweeted you on not vote for Biden. Care to elaborate?
It‚Äôs simple unintended pregnancies account for 90% of all abortions which of the two candidates is going to do the most to reduce unintended pregnancy. It‚Äôs wild that never Biden was all you had to say to my last tweet to. You didn‚Äôt even give a reason...
He has my vote, I‚Äôm already confident we have 100% chance to have less abortions under Biden than Trump. Biden will implement the preventative things to eliminate the causes of abortion. GOP‚Äôs answer is outlaw, which won‚Äôt work.
Make no mistake about it, if Dems don't nominate an actual progressive in 2024 I won't be voting.  I have a strong dislike for #45 so it's very easy to vote for Biden, even though I dislike Biden as well
Biden can't apologize in person because he isn't capable! He had to have someone tweet his attempt at an apology on his behalf!
Your handle is a lie in itself. There is no such thing as a Republican for Biden. Secondly, we had the all-time best economy IN HISTORY before we were attacked by the liberal Scamdemic.  The economy - and employment -  continue to grow by leaps and bounds, thanks to Trump

Wow I mean how powerful must Joe Biden be if he can hurt God? Personally I think God can take care of his own self just fine.
Trump is trying to dupe, you again, he uses same old tactics on Biden that he did on Hillary, has anybody taken your guns yet( been waiting almost four years) someone that knows nothing about religion has the nerve to talk about someone else, wonder what god he worships
Kind of makes Biden sound bad-ass, though. I mean, if he can hurt God...
You need to wake up and smell the obvious, sweetie! If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden and vote for third or fourth parties, then you‚Äôre helping Trump win four more years as POTUS!Can you share what it is that you think Biden is going to do other than not being Trump and getting more favorable media coverage? Honest question, because I don't see any positive change or outcome with Biden.
Didn't assume you were. I'm registered independent personally. I see what's going on, but there is an insidious Marxism movement that's capitalizing on the shit show that is Trump, and Biden has never been more than a grifter for sale to the highest bidder. I don't trust him.

Republicrat clones all say the same thing, in mirror form. A vote for [insert name] is either actually a vote for Trump or for Biden, depending on which side is telling the lie. A vote I can stand behind without shame is the only vote I will cast.
The problem with that is neither Trump nor Biden can consistently form cohesive thoughts without a prompter, and possibly a cattle prod to keep them on script lol. Neither side wants her on that stage.
There's plenty of desire to change the two party system. They've simply insulated themselves and protected their position by controlling things like poll inclusion and debate access. Putting Biden the Braindead in place of Trump the Orange gets us nowhere. When do we say NO MORE?
Wow. Really? Bye, Felicia. You must have the same mental conditions as Trump and Biden...

A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump!  A vote for Biden is a vote for Biden!  A vote for a third party candidate is *drumrolls* ..... A vote for a third party candidate.    Y‚Äôall killing me with this whole a vote for one candidate is really a vote for another nonsense. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Trust me, there's nothing about those proceedings that I'm going to forget anytime soon. And none of it in any way changes my vote for Kamala Harris and/or Joe Biden.

Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
You're pardoned.  My opinion is that I don't reward the Democratic party because they were good enough to cheat in a primary.  Biden has done zero to earn my vote.  Trump could never get my vote.  Biden but has to ask...
Your party is going up in flames because your only enthused voters want to defund cops, so you pick the two people most responsible for jailing black men.  You're going to be a breeze to beat.  Clearly, no good candidates wanted to run with Biden because your party went nuts.
This is going to be easy to beat:

You mean Biden, the guy who called Harris President and said it was 2021...and told black people they ain‚Äôt black if they don‚Äôt vote for him... and said Latinos were more diverse than blacks... should I go on???

Why are you saying anything if I was you I would not commit on anything and stay hidden cause I think they are coming for you Obama and Biden so look out
Are you really going to say things about this lady she claimed that Biden was a sex a fender and didn't let a man out of jail when he was innocent liars ate what you stand for shame on you and all the Dems. I think that there are things that will come out soon about you &amp; the Dem
It just shows that Biden is working harder than you trump
Telling us we do have to vote for Biden in a safe blue state just feels like ‚Äúget in line because we say so‚Äù, and that‚Äôs not how you get none voters to vote. If you want votes, you have to earn them, by pushing what people want, not just shouting against what they don‚Äôt want
But for the love of god, don‚Äôt tell people who don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden because of his very real political flaws that they MUST vote for him in a state he‚Äôs going to win anyway, NYs electoral votes aren‚Äôt on the line here, everyone knows this. We don‚Äôt have to vote for him
Patronizingly telling ‚ÄúBernie Bros‚Äù they need to vote for Biden isn‚Äôt going to get you that surge, it‚Äôs just turning those people off to voting at all. Tell them about the down ballot races with candidates they can get excited about.

Then you know how disheartening it is to fight for things you truly believe in, have the people who could help implement them spit in your face, and then be told you need to vote for them anyway. Votes are earned. We live in NY, it‚Äôs not like Biden isn‚Äôt gonna win this state

Hundreds of thousands of black people went to and still sit in jail because of Biden. How many of them died in prison because they couldn't get good medical care, all because a racist like joe biden was given the ability to write laws

Lets say you are right. Why is it a bad thing to avoid mail in ballots? There is fraud, interference and lost ballots. Why risk an entire election when we can do it the way it‚Äôs always worked. People act so confident in Biden‚Äôs ability to win yet want to open us up to that.

You could have made that argument for any previous presidential race. So why didn't you? Everyone knows the real answer and the real reason why you don't want Biden debating Trump.
Every time you talk about skipping presidential debates your lame excuses don't hold water. You simply realize that Biden is mentally incapable of debating not only Trump but just about anybody. Truly sad.

Congratulations! It‚Äôs Official! On the Ticket with ‚ÄúTransitional‚Äù Joe Biden. Your Faith ‚Äúblack Baptist.‚Äù Is that Faith  transitional as well?
I dislike Biden and Harris. I just dislike Trump and Pence way more lol
So this clown rails against Biden in 2019, says she believes women who accused him of inappropriate actions towards them, calls him a racist but now wants to be his VP... go figure.
I'm sure the Biden/Harris campaign appreciates your endorsement.
Y‚Äôall literally out here shittin on Biden and Harris like y‚Äôall got another option.  Go head and get your MAGA hats out if y‚Äôall don‚Äôt vote for them..  clowns. ü§° #BidenHarris2020
Biden was rejected by Democratic primary voters and what do you know President Obama picked him as his VP.Another form of misogyny from a white male
And continuing my 3am rant: No, Biden/Harris doesn't get me energized.  (It'll be fun to watch Harris eat Pence alive.) However, my other choices are the Angry Orange/beige Ford Taurus OR the bi-polar guy who doesn't make sense on his "up" days. I'll take Biden/Harris +8
How about you save your contempt until we get the current idiot out of office. No matter what your views on Biden/Harris, they can't be nowhere near as bad as the 4 years we have been going through! #WearADamnMask #Vote #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor
So nobody realized Biden got a black running mate to get the black vote?
The black woman Biden picked for vp running mate.  With her husband.  She is proud of sending black men to prison.  Her family background owned a plantation and slaves in Jamaica. You just can't make this stuff up.
Prove  right    Step aside for    #election2020
I won‚Äôt go as far to say that I‚Äôd block anyone but I agree that they‚Äôre not in the same playing field. Nobody said you had to love him, but if you really want Trump out then Biden is your only option. It‚Äôs up to you who you vote for, I know who I am voting for #BidenHarris2020
I guarantee, if Biden wins (and that's a big if) Bernie will be the first to call him out on every horrible stance and policy. But for 3+ years they vilified progressives bc they hated him for daring to oppose "Her," and it cost progressive candidates. So he's playing along.
How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: Inside the history-making VP pick
Bad take. Bernie knows Biden/Harris aren't the answer, but he also knows Dems spent 3+ years scapegoating progressives bc they were pissed at him. So he's not giving them that chance this time. We got the squad in south of their scapegoating. Imagine how many we can elect now.

So I personally see why Biden picked up they both feel the same about "blacks" Lock they asses up &amp; never free em Never change Jim Crow/slave codes of 1706 (cuz none of the 13 colonies got rid of them just change the name &amp; date) hence why we feel like we goin backwards to 1960
Pence will make her explain how she can be on the ticket with Biden after saying this:
The funniest iteration of the "I don't care if X, I'm still voting for Biden!" has been the dude who said that he'd vote for a Biden/Hitler ticket
Essentially she's the democratic candidate for president as Biden likely won't last a full term.   And no way, she's as sleazy as they come. Look up her connection with Steve Mnuchin. It's disgusting. She's a republican pretending to be a democrat.

All those things will be lost if Biden is elected
Joe Biden is an idiot with a brain the size of a grain of sand
At the start of the democratic primary, I donated to Biden &amp; Harris...     So, I just doubled my normal weekly donation to the Biden/Harris campaign.
I wonder how history will look at Joe Biden if elected president,because he will be part of the two most historic presidential tickets ever.Will he be known for the 94 crime bill more or making history twice.
I can‚Äôt wait for the KHive to use all your powers to focus on getting President Biden &amp; Madam VP Harris elected in November.
Technically that‚Äôs not true, her mother is Indian ( from India) and her father is Jamaican ( from Jamaica). Considering the Jamaicans I know don‚Äôt consider themselves as Black, she isn‚Äôt Black either. So in reality Biden‚Äôs running mate is passing for Black.
I‚Äôm gonna vote for Biden/Harris so fucking hard omg
Actual footage of me realizing Biden was going to be the nominee.
Yes we do. That‚Äôs why Biden picked her. She‚Äôs intelligent and she is a beast when it comes to debates. She will drag your ass and do what‚Äôs necessary to win. üòé
Joe Biden should NOT opt for a black female as his pick for VP. Blacks make up 13% of the US population &amp; the growth rate plummeting , Hispanics make up 19% of the population &amp; the growth rate is skyrocketing. Hispanics, NOT blacks, are the future of America. #Election2020
She's blown a lot of things, but Biden's chances weren't one of them, they were blown a long time ago
Damn not even waiting for Joe Biden to be elected to pretend to start caring about the debt and deficits.

Not sure which was a bigger overreaction to Cardi and Megan: Ben Shapiro coming out about his inability to arouse a woman or Joe Biden picking a Whole Ass Prosecutor to be his VP
You should vote. I won't say vote Biden. I loathe Biden myself. But I will also admit to planning to vote for him. Trump is a threat, has been a threat. We are swiftly hitting *open* fascism. He has to go. I'll take that bullet to the knee instead of the chest.
Madame VP let‚Äôs do this y‚Äôall. Get out there and VOTE!!! GO Biden power moveüëèüèΩ
Biden picking Kamala pretty much sealed the election.
They don't think Biden will last a term. And Bernie doesn't actually think Biden can win; he'd have turned down the offer to stay in the Senate rather than be on a losing ticket.
I genuinely respect you and your opinions generally line up with my own, but look at bit more into her. She's more or less another DINO like Biden. We need some real, leftist changes to happen. Though at least she'll probably get Biden a few more votes
Focusing on the forest, would be flipping the Senate. But putting Biden up against Trump - 2 dementia patients with sexual assault allegations who don't give a damn about PoC - and making his running mate one of the worst AGs CA ever had, that's just fueling the forest fire.
Biden was not my 1st choice for president &amp; Kamala not my 1st for VP. That said they‚Äôll be exponentially better than the dangerous psychopath in office now. I‚Äôll be more than happy to vote for them deal with any shortcomings later.
You have to remember, Joe Biden was nothing more than an olive branch to people who may have needed to be a little more palatable to vote for a black man for president. He was a conservative Democrat. I wouldn't go calling him a progressive hero out loud
Kamala Harris 'honored' to be Joe Biden's VP pick
I don't know if I've ever been more hopeful for my people than seeing the dedication from ADOS standing on not voting for Biden without tangibles....
Can't believe Joe Biden picked Maya Rudolph for VP!
Polls MAY say and show Biden is leading but remember there are hundreds or maybe thousands of people who sat out last time, those non voters WILL make the difference, spread the word towards anyone who is still considering not voting.
All women should be outraged at Trump‚Äôs response to Biden‚Äôs pick of a woman. Come to think about it, all men should be outraged at Trump‚Äôs response.
Meanwhile, Democratic politicians- Such as Sen.  and Rep.  - have shared congratulatory messages over Biden‚Äôs pick.
HISTORIC VP CHOICE: Joe Biden has picked Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate. She is the first woman of color ever on a major party's presidential ticket. Harris has represented California in the U.S. Senate since 2017, after serving as AG of California and DA of San Francisco

Wondering why people are tweeting about Biden making such a great choice of #KamalaHarris for VP. Do they really think #Biden had anything to do with it? They hate each other. Progressive left won, she was their choice. Bye, bye Democratic party.
it was hard enough voting for biden but now they're just being cruel
i'd be more worried about Biden &amp; the Ukraine
True all true, and this move might have just lost the election for Biden. Trump is enough of an asshole to call Kamala Harris a sellout and he will be right, Obama ruined that "I'm voting for the black person because they're black" energy
Best choice Biden Harris
Okay, let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs true. At this point it‚Äôs too late, but continuing to bring this up reduces Biden‚Äôs chance by pushing people away from him as a candidate.
Biden Harris yes they have my vote
So let me get this straight, in the debates Kamala Harris basically called Joe Biden a segregationist but now you accept being his VP, you can't make this up if you tried

Harris wasn‚Äôt my first pick but it is an excellent choice. She will energize women &amp; minorities to rally around the ticket, Biden‚Äôs age will be less of a liability with a much younger VP, and her vacated seat in the Senate will easily be filled by a Democrat. #BidenHarris2020

I'm not watching nor am I voting for Biden/Kamala. I'll leave that spot blank as I vote down ballot.   You can't snub your voter base and expect them to turn out for you. Democrats are never going to learn if we keep voting for them.
I thought his mask mandate did involve governors making the decision. ‚ÄúEvery governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing. The estimates by the experts are that it will save over 40,000 lives in the next three months. Forty thousand lives, if people act responsibly.‚Äù -Joe Biden
BIDEN RELEASED 21 YEARS OF HIS TAX RETURNS, TRUMP IS HOLDING UP WOUNDED WARRIORS,  SENIOR CITIZENS,  Veterans,  DIABETES SUPPLIES,  DIAPERS AND MEDICINE AND CHECKS THEY GET IN THE MAIL
RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS BEFORE THE DEBATE, IF YOU DONT,  YOU WILL NOT WIN, BECAUSE BIDEN HAS RELEASED 21 YEARS OF HIS TAX RETURNS,  SLOWING DOWN VETERANS AND SENIOR CITIZENS DIABETES SUPPLIES AND MEDICINE IN THE MAIL, YOUR BASE GET MEDICINE TO, IN THE MAIL, CHECKS, DIAPERS,
TRUMP RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS,  BIDEN HAS RELEASED 21 YEARS OF HIS TAX RETURNS,  74 % OF AMERICANS WANT TO SEE YOURS, YOU CANNOT WIN UNLESS YOU RELEASE THEM. BECAUSE YOU MAY HAVE TIDES TO RUSSIA,
Trump can't debate Biden, unless he releases his tax returns,
Have y‚Äôall ever considered running random horseshit about Biden‚Äôs old age and incompetence? Or how there are numerous clips of him making kids feel uncomfortable with his touchy feely liver spotted hands and awkward hair sniffing?
I don‚Äôt know man. All I know is that Democrats are trying everything in their power to make him win. I‚Äôll never vote for Biden and Harris. Not gonna happen.  I don‚Äôt like Trump but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt vote for either party.
Biden-harris kt's about 2 happen Jan 21 ...oh yeah!!!
Why would we look at biden to see how much of his mind is left ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Yeah because Joe Biden knows how to save us all!  It‚Äôs wearing a mask alone in my yard!  For the next 3 months only tho, because after the election - that will no longer be needed.
A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump!  A vote for Biden is a vote for Biden!  A vote for a third party candidate is *drumrolls* ..... A vote for a third party candidate.    Y‚Äôall killing me with this whole a vote for one candidate is really a vote for another nonsense. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

On Thursday, after Harris was selected by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to serve as his running mate, President Donald Trump elevated the conspiracy while speaking to reporters from the White House podium.
If the country hasn't yet collapsed under Trump (and, yes, I realize there's still time), I'm not even *remotely* concerned about it happening under Biden.

I passionately hate trump but I really don't trust biden neither. Someone like Bernie could've easily dominated the elections against the cheeto. I don't wanna get all conspiracy theories rn but I feel like people in higher power didn't want Sanders to run

#FailedPresident took a thriving economy (thank you President Obama and VP Biden) and drove it into the ground. We now have the #TrumpDepression along with the #TrumpVirus. 5.2 million Americans infected and +167,000 Americans dead since February.
Trust me, there's nothing about those proceedings that I'm going to forget anytime soon. And none of it in any way changes my vote for Kamala Harris and/or Joe Biden.
Fox News is Wilson over Kamala Harris being Biden‚Äôs VP candidate.
The Obama Administration put these protections in place nationwide &amp; Betsy tore them up. Biden will put them back in January.
You got that right! Now they are saying Kamala Harris isnt African American... THEY ARE THROWING EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK AT BIDEN/HARRIS! #PanicInDC

Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
You're pardoned.  My opinion is that I don't reward the Democratic party because they were good enough to cheat in a primary.  Biden has done zero to earn my vote.  Trump could never get my vote.  Biden but has to ask...
Your party is going up in flames because your only enthused voters want to defund cops, so you pick the two people most responsible for jailing black men.  You're going to be a breeze to beat.  Clearly, no good candidates wanted to run with Biden because your party went nuts.
This is going to be easy to beat:
Biden can't fight the swamp, he represents it.  This is the woman who said she believed his victims, nice pick:

Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
LOL... Biden better hire a food taster pronto. They need to check every can of Ensure and cup of apple sauce he gets.
Maybe it makes a lot of sense.  It might (just a guess) "help" some of the more rational republicans help to vote for Biden
She should probably be kept away from biden
Jill Biden looks like she would be so much fun to hang out with...
You mean Biden, the guy who called Harris President and said it was 2021...and told black people they ain‚Äôt black if they don‚Äôt vote for him... and said Latinos were more diverse than blacks... should I go on???
Unless you got a candidate in all 50 you don't have a shot. Im no fan of biden by a stretch but if it beats trump...

She threatened Biden.
The fact that he‚Äôs still calling Biden and Harris ‚Äúradical left‚Äù makes me wonder what are Marxists and communists?
I hope it's to be proven that Obama Biden Hillary was the most corrupt group in history.
Why are you saying anything if I was you I would not commit on anything and stay hidden cause I think they are coming for you Obama and Biden so look out
Are you really going to say things about this lady she claimed that Biden was a sex a fender and didn't let a man out of jail when he was innocent liars ate what you stand for shame on you and all the Dems. I think that there are things that will come out soon about you &amp; the Dem
It just shows that Biden is working harder than you trump
Telling us we do have to vote for Biden in a safe blue state just feels like ‚Äúget in line because we say so‚Äù, and that‚Äôs not how you get none voters to vote. If you want votes, you have to earn them, by pushing what people want, not just shouting against what they don‚Äôt want
But for the love of god, don‚Äôt tell people who don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden because of his very real political flaws that they MUST vote for him in a state he‚Äôs going to win anyway, NYs electoral votes aren‚Äôt on the line here, everyone knows this. We don‚Äôt have to vote for him
Patronizingly telling ‚ÄúBernie Bros‚Äù they need to vote for Biden isn‚Äôt going to get you that surge, it‚Äôs just turning those people off to voting at all. Tell them about the down ballot races with candidates they can get excited about.

Instead of trying to convince ‚ÄúBernie Bros‚Äù to vote for Biden in a state that is a lock to vote for Biden, maybe try to convince them to turn out for down ballet raises for candidates that actually listen to their constituents instead of belittling them for having principles.
Then you know how disheartening it is to fight for things you truly believe in, have the people who could help implement them spit in your face, and then be told you need to vote for them anyway. Votes are earned. We live in NY, it‚Äôs not like Biden isn‚Äôt gonna win this state

Joe Biden gonna drink a sip of water at the DNC and the crowd will go wild
Hundreds of thousands of black people went to and still sit in jail because of Biden. How many of them died in prison because they couldn't get good medical care, all because a racist like joe biden was given the ability to write laws
I‚Äôm not a political person at all but from my understanding you and so many others are going to split the vote not voting for Biden and choosing Bernie or othe me candidtates with low chances of winning And it could result in Trump winning ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Well I AM black...  But I am deeply disappointed in anyone who took part in the Monday Night Massacre that happened in March.  You know, the one where "someone" convinced everyone to drop out of the race and consolidate behind Biden?...
Lets say you are right. Why is it a bad thing to avoid mail in ballots? There is fraud, interference and lost ballots. Why risk an entire election when we can do it the way it‚Äôs always worked. People act so confident in Biden‚Äôs ability to win yet want to open us up to that.

Dr. Biden, absolutely!!  The Biden and Harris team is  Win-Win team!
Seriously tho. Some can't vote for the lesser of two evils. Most don't even know the policies these people have or their history, yet they're expected to vote?  I mean, im voting but I understand why other niggas won't vote. What Biden gonna do for the hood? PUT MORE BLACKS AWAY?
No they're only options. And only a house nigga would even contemplate voting for a racist like Biden.

You could have made that argument for any previous presidential race. So why didn't you? Everyone knows the real answer and the real reason why you don't want Biden debating Trump.
Every time you talk about skipping presidential debates your lame excuses don't hold water. You simply realize that Biden is mentally incapable of debating not only Trump but just about anybody. Truly sad.

Strong words from Harris: "He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden; And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
You are correct, Biden isn‚Äôt an ally.  That‚Äôs really not my point.  I think the economic harm that Trump has created will exacerbate existing problems inside communities of color.  It‚Äôs like smoking, every minute trump is in office shifts the 2053 problem closer to 2020.

It is possible to be happy about a Biden/Harris ticket and still recognize that their track record on criminal justice policy and reform is less than stellar. The reality of the moment is that the alternative to them is... what we have now.

Kamala for sure would have been on Biden's short list regardless of committing to pick a woman and regardless of BLM protests. So I'm not saying she was picked because of tokenism, I'm just saying I don't believe she's the candidate most black people feel "represents" them.
thank you for your comments on MSNBC, very well spoken. Such encouragement that things will and can get better with a Biden/Harris ticket.
Your Wednesday funny. Including this: "Climb upon Geraldine Ferraro's and my shoulders, and from the most amazing view in your life consider lessons we learned."   Bahahahahaha. I picture Team Biden/Harris getting a good chuckle out of this one.

If you vote Joe Biden you pretty much support a Pedo.
It's a weird situation because because Kamala would have been on Biden's short list even before committing to pick a woman and  before George Floyd, and those same headlines would show up.  But it just feels like so much more cynical now.

Not sure what that fake headline has to do with Biden, but we know the answer to the question is NO. Trump and you worthless-stains-on-humanity trumpists have shown that intelligence and "brains" aren't a prerequisite.
That, plus on Tucker right after the announcement a Dem strategist (can't remember the name) rolled out the women who want to take Trump to court for harassment/assault. Harris and that will be the attempt to draw women back to the Biden ticket. Transparent, but the same playbook

I guarantee, if Biden wins (and that's a big if) Bernie will be the first to call him out on every horrible stance and policy. But for 3+ years they vilified progressives bc they hated him for daring to oppose "Her," and it cost progressive candidates. So he's playing along.
How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: Inside the history-making VP pick
Bad take. Bernie knows Biden/Harris aren't the answer, but he also knows Dems spent 3+ years scapegoating progressives bc they were pissed at him. So he's not giving them that chance this time. We got the squad in south of their scapegoating. Imagine how many we can elect now.

Do you honestly believe that we live in a democracy? Or that any of this will change under Biden? A corporate duopoly controls our representation at almost every level of government. You're acquiescing to one wing of it, hoping it'll eventually be what you idealize it to be.
Biden could‚Äôve picked anyone LITERALLY anyone
So I personally see why Biden picked up they both feel the same about "blacks" Lock they asses up &amp; never free em Never change Jim Crow/slave codes of 1706 (cuz none of the 13 colonies got rid of them just change the name &amp; date) hence why we feel like we goin backwards to 1960

Does it even matter who Biden chose? Short of ALL OUT CHEATING,  will WIN BIG!
The SCOTUS argument is a common one, but not compelling. (Re: anita hill) Biden's probably even likely to nominate a moderate/conservative, IMO.
Okay I can say it, I'll be voting for  Her disgust for Biden's history of racism is what was the deciding factor to come out behind her

No disrespect at all. I think it's gonna take a fellow Bernie Bro turned Biden voter to convince me to vote Biden. Just haven't heard anything but "he's not Trump" yet, despite him being terrifyingly ideologically adjacent to Trump from my POV. How do you rationalize it?
All those things will be lost if Biden is elected

I can‚Äôt wait for the KHive to use all your powers to focus on getting President Biden &amp; Madam VP Harris elected in November.
To President candidate Joe Biden congratulations on picking Kamala Harris as your VP we got your back. We are not listening to trump he is too ignorant
Def let people be excited but also let people be leery too, it‚Äôs deserved. I wish Kamala all the best, but just like Biden needs his feet held to the fire so will she.  That‚Äôs what we need the leery people for.
Technically that‚Äôs not true, her mother is Indian ( from India) and her father is Jamaican ( from Jamaica). Considering the Jamaicans I know don‚Äôt consider themselves as Black, she isn‚Äôt Black either. So in reality Biden‚Äôs running mate is passing for Black.
Kamala and Biden are more Republican than Trump
I‚Äôm gonna vote for Biden/Harris so fucking hard omg
Less than two weeks ago Biden made a second disparaging comment about Black people. They‚Äôre not wrong.

I get it. He isn't an ideal candidate like Hillary. He's establishment. We hate establishment, but unfortunately it's the only way to get rid of Trump.  Biden will get my vote....but it hurts
You couldn't be more right. As a hardcore Bernie supporter/progressive I protest voted 3rd party in the election that got us where we are now. I'm terrified others will do the same this Nov. More than half the progressives I know are refusing to vote for Biden. I don't blame them
Yes we do. That‚Äôs why Biden picked her. She‚Äôs intelligent and she is a beast when it comes to debates. She will drag your ass and do what‚Äôs necessary to win. üòé
Like Hillary lost by a football stadium of voters in 2016.. Biden and Kamala shouldn‚Äôt have a problem with Trump.
Joe Biden should NOT opt for a black female as his pick for VP. Blacks make up 13% of the US population &amp; the growth rate plummeting , Hispanics make up 19% of the population &amp; the growth rate is skyrocketing. Hispanics, NOT blacks, are the future of America. #Election2020

Biden picking Kamala pretty much sealed the election.
They don't think Biden will last a term. And Bernie doesn't actually think Biden can win; he'd have turned down the offer to stay in the Senate rather than be on a losing ticket.
I genuinely respect you and your opinions generally line up with my own, but look at bit more into her. She's more or less another DINO like Biden. We need some real, leftist changes to happen. Though at least she'll probably get Biden a few more votes
The same planet where someone thinks Joe Biden would make a good president.
#biden picks #harris  Pretty strong argument can be made that he didnt pick a black woman to garner favor with black people, but to virtue signal to white suburban PMC women. (He already has strong black support). Her value added is if shes good at fundraising.
Focusing on the forest, would be flipping the Senate. But putting Biden up against Trump - 2 dementia patients with sexual assault allegations who don't give a damn about PoC - and making his running mate one of the worst AGs CA ever had, that's just fueling the forest fire.
This ain‚Äôt nothing, but a cover-up so #Biden don‚Äôt look #racist. So, now we got to choose between the ‚Äúin your face‚Äù racist or the ‚Äúcloseted‚Äù racist.  #BidenHarris2020 #thiselectionisamess

Interesting that Biden doesn't count but Kerry, Kaine, and, uh, Biden do.
Don't nobody care to look at trump,   Show Kamala Harris being escorted around by her new secret service team. Looks like we're well on our way to have tge 1st black woman president in a few years.    I'm so damn proud of Joe Biden for picking someone he's guaranteed to win with
You have to remember, Joe Biden was nothing more than an olive branch to people who may have needed to be a little more palatable to vote for a black man for president. He was a conservative Democrat. I wouldn't go calling him a progressive hero out loud

Polls MAY say and show Biden is leading but remember there are hundreds or maybe thousands of people who sat out last time, those non voters WILL make the difference, spread the word towards anyone who is still considering not voting.

HISTORIC VP CHOICE: Joe Biden has picked Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate. She is the first woman of color ever on a major party's presidential ticket. Harris has represented California in the U.S. Senate since 2017, after serving as AG of California and DA of San Francisco
With Kamala Harris comes a lot of controversy, did Joe Biden make the correct decision? Pass it on.
Y‚Äôall can be mad, just vote for Biden. Thanks.
I can call someone all types of stuff but if they still want to give me a million dollars Ima take it lol. Biden should be the one asking himself why he picked her. Probably picked her because she‚Äôs not afraid to hold back her toungue. She‚Äôll be tough.
Voting Trump out and voting for Biden are 2 totally different things...

Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusersThis is the thing, right? She's been terrible on a few issues, and Biden's had some problems too, but this is how it shook out. I guess on our end, we need to be sure that even if they win, we keep the pressure on to adopt some true progressive stances.
The Biden campaign could get in trouble if they don't start reporting the value of NPR news coverage as an in-kind campaign contribution.

Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris As His Running Mate
It is factual and true, sure, but it is also factual that more turnout typically leads to Democrat wins. Not voting means you can‚Äôt criticize the winner - if Trump wins, not voting helped gived him that win if you would have voted Blue given Biden wasn‚Äôt the candidate. u rite tho
Biden doesn‚Äôt hold grudges.
Here's the deal with Joe Biden. This was a bad pick. But it could have been much worse.  As someone who hoped for Bernie, settled for Warren VP, and is now stuck with Biden/Harris, I'm trying to find optimism. A black female VP is a step in the right direction.
Ladies of #Theview! Liberty has become privilege. And privilege? It is characterized by #DonaldTrump. But also ladies by #BarackObama who has been rewarded for appeasing the HeritageSociety, the Pentagon and the Intelligence "Community." Now we have Zero NationalHealthCare #Biden
I don't think it is at all helpful but then it don't think of Mr Biden as a religious person.

Conservatives are already getting racist over Harris like they did over Obama. It's been one hour since the announcement.... #KamalaHarrisForVP #Kamala #politics #Biden #Biden2020 #DumpTrump2020 #Trump
Kinda odd that the same day Bernie's delegates voted no to the DNC's platform Biden announced his VP. Probably just a coincidence
Kamala Harris calling Biden and a racist a few months before becoming his running mate is the best way I can describe American politics
If this is the best they've got "Slow Joe and Phony Kamala", then we're already ahead.   She's going to devastate them.   Joe Biden needed her. Good to see he's not BS-ing around!
Joe Biden is a republican. I said what I said.
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris As His Running Mate
Lmao Biden and Kamala is literally the worst ballot I could even imagine I'm honestly impressed
BREAKING: Biden has announced Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Good job Joe Biden.
I think the correct guess is that Biden didn't choose anybody. He was told.
Trump has no agenda; never has except Not Obama. Biden should present a forward thinking plan for all of the US. He should roll out a cabinet nominee every few days, ending with the VP. Each member should stand for and talk about a policy direction.
I think Biden should roll out a cabinet nominee every few days and then blitz the country after the convention with those nominees
Hillary Looks Great Next To Biden! That Is Why They Have Him There!
#TheRingOfFire Splendid opportunity for the #DemocraticParty to pass #HealthCareForAll, #LegalizedMarijuana, both favored by abt 70% of AmericanPeople, and the party elite (Including #Biden) are afraid to act.
someone put this on my moms biden sign and it‚Äôs a little funny
That‚Äôs what happen in 2016 and look what‚Äôs happiness now, you have to vote for Joe Biden, if you ever want out of this mess, don‚Äôt be part of the problem.

I should have warned you in advance, my bad. Don't ever come at me with bullshit memes. I'll always push back with facts.
#FoxNewsSunday. #Biden or #Trump? Yep. You're exactly right. They both suck. But Biden elected at least will wash #StephenMiller #JaredKushner &amp; #MikePompeo out of there. Drain the whole of the #TrumpSwamp. #BetsyDeVos whooshed out on her dismal ass. &amp; Take down #MitchMcConnell.
This is not an election you can just opt out of or vote for someone else. That‚Äôs unacceptable. If you care about literally anyone other than yourself, you will bite your tongue/ be really excited and vote for Biden. This election is about more than just you.
If anyone is thinking of voting for #JoJorgensen please for the love of whatever you believe in, don‚Äôt. Third party voters and non voters ruined it in 2016 and if we want to get the psychopathic orange baby out of the white house in November, Biden is the only option.
I‚Äôm totally with you, don‚Äôt make the same mistake you made in 2016 , vote for Joe Biden.
There‚Äôs another issue, too. Biden actually takes care of himself. Trump eats buckets of KFC and chugs Coke.
I agree.  Sadly, Biden co-wrote the Patriot act and it was renewed under Obama ...not that I expect republicans to stop it either.
Joe Biden tells us how important his faith is to him -- so important that he lives in a way that is the total opposite of the faith he professes. Come on, Joe. Hypocrisy is ugly! If your faith is the "bedrock" of your life prove it by your actions. Repudiate abortion and sodomy.
Thank you for caring for the United States of America. I will vote for Joe Biden.. Trump must go!!
This should be Biden's acceptance speech:
Why am I voting for Biden and not agent orange!
Biden got a free pass from everybody on the left...shame on them
Making a guess that Biden chose Harris as his VP
Biden doing everything in his power to lose in November. ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Just got a text from  asking if I think they should endorse Biden. I‚Äôm still super pissed at y‚Äôall for not endorsing Bernie when he clearly won the vote &amp; your board didn‚Äôt listen to the members &amp; did what they wanted. Now look where we‚Äôre at.ü§¨
Virtual rally in progress. Irish American for Biden! This is brilliant! So much fun. Feeling my roots!
I have the nagging feeling that Joe Biden won‚Äôt be on the ballot on November 3rd. Idk why, it‚Äôs just a gut feeling, but I feel certain that the next 3 months are going to be unbelievable. Buckle up kiddos.
I‚Äôm no democrat, Biden is a Catholic. Can anyone tell me what Trump‚Äôs religion is, besides Trumpism.
Do you really think those those NRA members we're going to vote for Biden in the first place.It's not really a fair discussion. If you don't fall in line with Biden, you get the "progressives don't vote so why should we cater to you." And if you do fall in line with Biden, they know they never have to do shit to get your vote for free. Don't fight impossible battles.
Professor Allan Lichtman has predicted every election since 1984, using a model he developed alongside Soviet Union scientists. This year, he's predicting  will be victorious.  #News3Politics
False narrative. We don't get along with MAGA neo-fascism. But Biden's record is unbearably adjacent to it. Almost seems like the centrists and the right team up against the left every cycle.
Christians rigging the election, there is nothing they will not do, nothing.
Hell no. Voting for Biden just because he isn't Trump is not logical either.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt underestimate Joe‚Äôs ability to f--k things up,‚Äù  #FoxNews

Didn't Joe Biden tried to defund SS at one time??
Is this the same Joe Biden who tried to defund SS??
This video is more proof that the fact checkers at Twitter need to take down. Its all lies. Msnbc has twisted what President Trump said. Biden and Obama where the ones that put children in cages at the border. I bet Twitter wo t fact check and remove this video
Obama = Lying sack of Sh!t  He and Socialist Progressives passed "legislation" to fund Postal Workers Retirement Fund 100% ...  WITHOUT INCREASING POSTAL RATES! Taking money from its operation ... to the Detriment of ALL Americans!  UNION supports BIDEN??
Earlier this week I forgot my mic was on after a breakout group session in a RECORDED BB Collaborate training and said ‚Äùoh shit‚Äù when I saw Biden had chosen a running mate *sigh*
Biden deserves the credit. If Onama-Biden hadn't pandered to Iran, the rest of the Middle East may not be so quick to normalize relations with Israel. So, thanks Joe.
Well said Eileen, the more trump complains about someone the more fears them. Biden/Harris has him terrified so he does the only thing he can to try &amp; put someone down. That fool doesn't understand this won't work this time. Over the last 4 years he has proven his incompetence..
Its not about biden tho we talkn bout trump
We riding with Kamala no matter what We protecting Kamala by all means necessary  We voting for the Biden/Harris ticket like we did in 2012 We tired of the white house smelling like Smithfield packing everytime it rain outside,
Never Trumpers like myself, need not vote for Biden to stop Trump, just read the Constitution and block both Biden and Trump from achieving 270 Electoral votes and there could be a Biden-Pence admi nistration!
There were no stronger '16 Dem candidates than Hillary just like there are no stronger '20 Dem candidates today (outside of Michelle Obama) than Biden.  And Trump won one, and could likely win the subsequent election.  So I don't think that is quite good enough.
Hogan better pray Kamala and the NY D.A don't come together under Biden's A G and make public any and everything illegal this administration done. Keep in mind trump's already looked at for crimes with Micheal Cohen as well as misuse of nonprofit funds with his kid Open&amp;shut case
None of this matters until we replace King Trump with President Biden.  King Trump does not obey United States laws.
You can be as loud and as opposed to the things you want after Biden wins. Push them. Call them out. All of that is righteous.  Standing by and letting Trump become the next permanent president is way more immoral than compromising now to fight later.
There is no evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. There is no basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election.
Make a list of the ‚Äúway worse‚Äù things Biden has done over Trump! I want to see this shit! üòÇü§£
l'm happy to see you agree Stephen. Joe Biden will bring us together &amp; work towards healing the country
Independents are especially unimpressed with Kamala Harris.

Nader didn't put a gun to Al Gore's head and make him blow it, nor did he design the Florida butterfly ballot, nor did he give SCOTUS room to just shrug at the whole situation.  The Pied Pipers are the ones who said "the era of big government is over" and are forcing Biden on us.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Every single criticism of Biden and Harris represents an action I expect you to take daily after the election. #vote
I thought his mask mandate did involve governors making the decision. ‚ÄúEvery governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing. The estimates by the experts are that it will save over 40,000 lives in the next three months. Forty thousand lives, if people act responsibly.‚Äù -Joe Biden

Biden &amp; Harris need to host daily demonstrations at the Washington Monument or on the Mall in DC EVERY DAY until the USPS is funded and protected by #Congress, and the postmaster general fraudster is impeached. Voting rights are the whole campaign!
You got that right! Now they are saying Kamala Harris isnt African American... THEY ARE THROWING EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK AT BIDEN/HARRIS! #PanicInDC
This is great! Biden supporters can‚Äôt handle the truth! Instead, they try to get me banned! Proud to be 100% problematic for Democrats!! I‚Äôm just getting started!

Im waiting on yalls alternative since ya dont wanna vote but you hate Trump but you‚Äôll go to the ends to explain why Biden/Harris dont need to be elected. just get Trump out, can we start there ?
She responded to my tweet, I asked the person who tweeted the original one she responded to ‚Äúso it‚Äôs gonna lay on the shoulders of all women? No way‚Äù i deleted my tweet because I didn‚Äôt feel like dealing with the guy who said what he said about ALL women voting for Biden.

We do not have to vote for Joe Biden to stop Donald Trump.
I doubt he treats trump supporters like they have no brain. That would be Biden supporters. It really doesn‚Äôt take rocket science.
I have come to the conclusion that there is no help for Biden, his administration, or his followers! They say the most ignorant stuff and want to vote for someone who has NO policies! SMH.
Also.. A LOT has been thrown at this man &amp; he has diligently given above &amp; beyond to every single hurdle &amp; STILL has numerous record breaking economic positive values. He‚Äôs made 1000 moves before Biden can get his sentence out. Like him or not, he runs the hell out of The USA.
Biden had asthma from childhood. Trumps daddy paid for a fake diagnosis of bone spurs. And you respect trump?
You can‚Äôt comprehend what you read. ‚Äú China prefers President Trump losing the election, because Beijing considers him "unpredictable," while Russia is working to undermine Democrat Joe Biden.
Biden had asthma from childhood
But they want to talk about how Biden speaks. And Trump shouldn‚Äôt have been in speech therapy class? Look at the fleas on fluffy if you didn‚Äôt get that it‚Äôs like the pot calling the kettle black.ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èijs

You can throw memes all day but I can promise Biden‚Äôs are funnier!
He has a page   please send there. So he can find them himself. Many thanks to all of you my dear friends. l feel real peace tonight now that we have the  Biden/Harris ticket. lts as if a calm has  washed over me as if to say "We will do this, together we will"
Here's the plan: post-election, invoke 25th Amendment as needed. Biden "retires" after 2 years. Then, constitutionally, the Tamil-Jamaican descendent of slaveholders can serve for up to 10 years as President.
Didn‚Äôt she have some of the lowest points of all candidates during the debates where she called out Biden as basically being racist?
Why do believe Christine and not Tara? Why do you believe a guy like Joe Biden who fondles little girls? Why do you believe Joe Biden who touches women inappropriately? Why do you believe Joe Biden when he brags about little kids touching his hairy legs?
Saw the clip where Sen Klobuchar withdrew from the race and endorsed VP Biden.  He appeared in the screen, hugged her, and you could see such emotion on his face.  An "I do want to win, but I didn't want you to lose."  Empathy...a good Dude.  We do indeed need this.
The only thing  has done for me is to have shown me how ignorant and stupid he is and how many people are just as toxic as he is. Even if you don‚Äôt like Biden/Harris how could you EVER think Trump is better?#whathasTrumpdone4ulately #TrumpKillsUSPS

It‚Äôs not the black vote that‚Äôs going to get Biden/Harris in office. It‚Äôs the Bernie/Warren stans...if they mobilize and vote. Take a play from the Republicans.
trump wants that label not us, don't give him the satisfaction. Mighty  NOT nasty. Let's try that one instead. Biden/Harris is a great ticket we can be proud of. They need our 100 % support. Sending you positive thoughts &amp; blessings to you &amp; yours. Stay safe my friend
Facts! However... they keep bringing up stuff trump supposedly did over 30 years ago so why can‚Äôt they say he has evolved?! Yet Biden does it daily and because he admits them it‚Äôs ok. Yet he has no policies that help the communities. He has NO policies. Hypocrisy!
Biden won me over from jump. He said Get Behind Ms Harris. I like that!!  They are going to have different views on the same issues and agrees to disagree right up front. I like him. He understands. #BidenHarris2020

Agree! Before the bromance- chose  to balance the ticket. And now we know that Biden's selection of  , his own balanced ticket approach, has been a smashing success- just as  &amp; I predicted
I keep mispronouncing her name and it is accidental. I have been practicing because I will be saying it every day as I work for the Biden/Harris ticket. But when someone says something really STUPID I pronounce EVERYTHING WRONG.
Interns. Can‚Äôt you tell they sound intelligent. Can you imagine an actual Biden tweet. He would run out of letters before anything was coherent

Trump with more socialist spending.  Trump - Socialism Biden - Extreme Socialism Jorgensen - Free Market Capitalism #Jorgensen2020
This might be an outlier since so many people do not have confidence Biden will finish the full term.
Beaugh Biden
If you believe black lives matter then Jorgensen-Cohen is your ticket, not Biden-Harris.
Here‚Äôs a thought Biden has been in office for decades. The issue today have been the same for decades.  So if  hasn‚Äôt been able fix them in decades how will he fix them in 4 years? Try giving  an honest chance.  Work with him not against him.
Her and Biden are moderates, just call them that or don‚Äôt bring it up lol. It‚Äôs moving the goalpost on what is considered progressive. We can aim higher

Kamala for sure would have been on Biden's short list regardless of committing to pick a woman and regardless of BLM protests. So I'm not saying she was picked because of tokenism, I'm just saying I don't believe she's the candidate most black people feel "represents" them.
Biden-Harris first joint presser at 3:50pm this afternoon.
If you vote Joe Biden you pretty much support a Pedo.
It's a weird situation because because Kamala would have been on Biden's short list even before committing to pick a woman and  before George Floyd, and those same headlines would show up.  But it just feels like so much more cynical now.
It's not Omar, nor is it Biden; it's the people that are behind them that is the threat to American's way of life.
Kamala &amp; Biden are not ideal, no. but yall would rather vote Trump again? lol ok....

I don't support either lol nor have I ever voted. However its many more tangibles Biden/Harris have done to the detriment of the Black community than Trump
If you think black lives matter and want true criminal justice reform, vote Jorgensen/Cohen, not Biden/Harris. #Jorgensen2020 #LetHerSpeak #ShesWithUs #VoteGold

How very post-modern and relativistic....
It is kind of creepy but look at Biden and look at Trump
Biden shoulda picked my baby Tulsi as his running mate smh
538 reports that Biden has 71% chance of winning. Pretty good odds.    I want it to be 100% certain that we‚Äôre getting rid of Trump. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Biden and Kamala are wack but they‚Äôre safe enough bets to convince people in the middle to vote blue. Trash but could be worse
i missed the part where she said Joe Biden kept her from going to good schools...  can someone point me to the part of the video where that happens?
Really?  You think Sen. Harris has that much positive influence to solidly swing PA to Biden?
I had to send this out to my friends ‚ô•Ô∏è in a tweeterville. The pompas ass, need I say more, has opened his pie hole again to attack the dynamic duo. Saying Kamala Harris was a nasty so and so who wanted to kick Joe Biden's teeth in. And he didn't know what sleepy Joe was thinking

Why does everyone call Biden a pedo when trump allegedly raped a 13 year old girl who was tied up?  Are there any alleged stories of Biden raping a kid? Let me do some research and I will get back to you
Even "Trump Haters" don't want Joe!!!!! Why I Want Biden to Lose More than I Want Trump to Win
Kamala Harris, singlehandedly, is responsible for thousands of POC being wrongfully incarcerated all over the US for nonviolent crimes (majority marijuana). If you are planning on voting Biden, how do you feel about this? Isn‚Äôt this what we‚Äôre fighting against the most?
I 100% agree. Four more years of "dictator trump" &amp; we will have a country thats unrecognizable with a democracy thats lost. Biden/Harris ticket is our chance to secure a future for our children. Restore civility when we remove the blight from  OUR W.H.  We can, we will do this!
seriously what's wrong with all the people who are like "at least BIDEN won't be doing all that TWEETING"
Biden/Harris are NOT progressive at all
Excited to hear  acceptance speech for the VP pick on the Biden ticket! #NeverGiveUp
Morning friends, we have the team that will take back the country &amp;  save our democracy Biden/Harris! We must do everything in our power to make sure they win on Nov 3rd Call your local chapter 1st time voter needs to be registered, volunteer,  help anyway you can. We can do this
Some Biden allies wage campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president  Typical debate bull crap!
I know i liked her too but they threw her out like trash and she still endorsed Biden. That tells me alot about her too. :(
Me realizing that the only way to get trump out of office is voting for Biden and Kamala üôÉ
Congratulations I‚Äôm excited to support my AKA Soror for the Vice Presidential running mate ofJoe Biden!!!üíïüíïüíï
Lol. Please show me where Biden has control over anything?!
Haha... Biden needs to get one first because Kamala doesn‚Äôt fit the agenda.
Local politicians react to #KamalaHarris as Biden's pick for running mate
I‚Äôve done my research, but thank you. Not guilty and had many black tenants. People get accused all the time, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs so. That‚Äôs called pulling the race card. Biden says black people aren‚Äôt diverse in fact.. they aren‚Äôt black, but here we are. #üöÇüöÇ
Funny thing is.... no one has said a damn thing Biden has done! In this whole comment section! Hahaha. SMH
Idt anybody is saying they want trump in office they jus talking about biden an harris aint about to be any better lol
Id still vote for biden but congress is about to run slam over biden an harris watch. They honestly not about shit. We all knew how trump was about to be in office an he showed us exactly that. Biden aint really no better tbh he jus not bigoted he still wild tho
How  kept his VP pick a secret
Biden was a known and established name and groundwork was already laid for him in the South. All it took was one massive win in SC for the other candidates to realize that. Pandemic didn't help much either
You know that Biden is a pedophile right?
The absolute meltdown going on in the American political right pretty much verifies that Biden made the right choice. The louder the GOPers freak out, the better something is for the rest of us. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
Harris was downright nasty towards Biden during the debates. She also says that she believes Biden's accusers. Everything says that this isn't a good match. I refuse to support Harris. The one who gets hurt is Biden because he lost my vote because he picked Harris.
...its not going to take 4 years of Biden being president for me to see if he's a good person, I'm already kinda iffy bout Joe. every 4 years we have the right to choose between the lesser of 2 evils... that has never sat right with me. yeah our people died for these rights but..
I think Biden's VP choice is really going to help him lock up that California vote.
Do you honestly believe that we live in a democracy? Or that any of this will change under Biden? A corporate duopoly controls our representation at almost every level of government. You're acquiescing to one wing of it, hoping it'll eventually be what you idealize it to be.
Is anyone really surprised he chose Kamala? We‚Äôre literally back where we started, the lesser of 2 evils. Granted, yes, Biden and Kamala are leagues better than Trump and Pence, HOWEVER both have shown to be underhanded, shady, and untrustworthy. But this is America so.
Biden could‚Äôve picked anyone LITERALLY anyone
Trump was relatively unknown and Clinton was known for decades.  Biden has been known for decades, and in 4 years Trump has literally nearly destroyed America.  No wonder it doesn't work this time around.
People,  we have two choices:  Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris. If you don't vote, you don't get to bitch for the next 4 years.Remember, it isn't just POTUS &amp; VPOTUS. There will be at least 2~ 3 SCOTUS  nominations &amp; a butt ton of federal judges to be appointed.
#BidenHarris Here's what Kamala Harris brings to Joe Biden's campaign for president
we know you don‚Äôt want to support the Biden/Harris ticket. We know you want to send the troops home and reform the VA. We know you want criminal justice reform. We know you want end the war on drugs. We know you want Jorgensen/Cohen 2020. #Jorgensen2020
Who cares!  Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate so who cares about what anybody in the trump family trying to talk about,  bad enough the trump virus killed more Americans than the country the virus originated from. Biden would've never let this happen, trump sorry ass
Does it even matter who Biden chose? Short of ALL OUT CHEATING,  will WIN BIG!
The SCOTUS argument is a common one, but not compelling. (Re: anita hill) Biden's probably even likely to nominate a moderate/conservative, IMO.
A real VP don't kiss a president ass like trump picked,  *scared to stand up for himself  *neither trump/pense wives known for being intelligent like Dr.Biden or Kamala  *one wife known for getting butt naked and pense wife constantly made fun of on cartoon president  üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
No disrespect at all. I think it's gonna take a fellow Bernie Bro turned Biden voter to convince me to vote Biden. Just haven't heard anything but "he's not Trump" yet, despite him being terrifyingly ideologically adjacent to Trump from my POV. How do you rationalize it?
She calls Biden EXACTLY what he is. "A Lying, Racist White man."
Not for nothing, but I'm glad Joe Biden didn't listen to whoever was going on about how Kamala was "too ambitious." Because what a crock of shit THAT was. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
To President candidate Joe Biden congratulations on picking Kamala Harris as your VP we got your back. We are not listening to trump he is too ignorant
Def let people be excited but also let people be leery too, it‚Äôs deserved. I wish Kamala all the best, but just like Biden needs his feet held to the fire so will she.  That‚Äôs what we need the leery people for.
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate in historic first for a woman of color
Kamala and Biden are more Republican than Trump
Less than two weeks ago Biden made a second disparaging comment about Black people. They‚Äôre not wrong.
I get it. He isn't an ideal candidate like Hillary. He's establishment. We hate establishment, but unfortunately it's the only way to get rid of Trump.  Biden will get my vote....but it hurts
You couldn't be more right. As a hardcore Bernie supporter/progressive I protest voted 3rd party in the election that got us where we are now. I'm terrified others will do the same this Nov. More than half the progressives I know are refusing to vote for Biden. I don't blame them
Like Hillary lost by a football stadium of voters in 2016.. Biden and Kamala shouldn‚Äôt have a problem with Trump.
I‚Äôm thinking about the Dem primary.. them old folks came out for Biden and they‚Äôre really reliable
But I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden has this election in the bag
The difference between trump and Joe, *Trump scared of women that speak up and know who they are *Biden admire women that standing up for themselves and that's one of the differences.  So all HBCU's So all sororities  So all fraternities  Let's get ready, trump gotta go 1/21
I dont want to vote for Biden but I‚Äôm tired of trump
Just a female of color. A ticket balancer. Mostly,  not a double white moderate ticket like the 2016 ticket
The same planet where someone thinks Joe Biden would make a good president.
#biden picks #harris  Pretty strong argument can be made that he didnt pick a black woman to garner favor with black people, but to virtue signal to white suburban PMC women. (He already has strong black support). Her value added is if shes good at fundraising.
This ain‚Äôt nothing, but a cover-up so #Biden don‚Äôt look #racist. So, now we got to choose between the ‚Äúin your face‚Äù racist or the ‚Äúcloseted‚Äù racist.  #BidenHarris2020 #thiselectionisamess
Interesting that Biden doesn't count but Kerry, Kaine, and, uh, Biden do.
Don't nobody care to look at trump,   Show Kamala Harris being escorted around by her new secret service team. Looks like we're well on our way to have tge 1st black woman president in a few years.    I'm so damn proud of Joe Biden for picking someone he's guaranteed to win with
Yall say joe biden not capable ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£Trump says Spanish Flu of 1918 ended WWII - a conflict that didn't start until two decades later
I can call someone all types of stuff but if they still want to give me a million dollars Ima take it lol. Biden should be the one asking himself why he picked her. Probably picked her because she‚Äôs not afraid to hold back her toungue. She‚Äôll be tough.
Why there's never any people of color in none of trump's old photos or videos? Biden out did trump with just his VP pick. Can't wait to see his diverse administration, not many people of color now and we tired of the white house smelling like chittlings whenever it rain outside
I just dont see biden an harris gettin elected. Like wtf are they gona do to get them votes lmao yall better get ready for trump for next 4
Kamala Harris still not a good choice as Biden's VP
Yang: BIDEN WILL PASS UBI IN THE FIRST TERM   Biden:
There are literally two candidates for VP that Biden could've picked where I might have voted for him. Those are Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard. Since he didn't, Biden can suck it.  Okay, who am I kidding? I wouldn't have voted for Biden, anyway.
Now it's our job to get behind them both. Kamala Harris will support Joe Biden just as Joe did with Pres Obama. She is highly qualified. This will be a great WINNING TICKET.
Lol  anyone who thought Biden wouldn't pick Kamala as his running mate. It's pure theater, lol.
Live now: President Donald Trump his holding a press conference, where he is expected to react to Kamala Harris being selected as Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate.  #News3Politics
Congratulations to Kamala Harris. An intersting choice but I think I would have chosen Sen. Tammy Duckworth.
Trump let‚Äôs have a bicycle race between you and Biden. Is it true you have to ride a golf cart to the crapper?
No matter who was chosen there was always going to be 3 outcomes for people: 1. I was voting for Trump regardless idc who he Biden picks. 2. I‚Äôm voting Biden cause I just want Trump out of office. 3. I‚Äôm not voting in this election I‚Äôm staying home.
Kamala supported legalization but not M4A... but other than that she‚Äôs pretty progressive on issues. Lets see what Biden will agree to..
Nothing much to say about this. Saw this coming the moment Biden and Dems took out Bernie. At the end of the day it‚Äôs Trump vs Biden so the VPs will have no real impact.
Zero chance Biden finishes a full term
Let the ball busting begin: It's Kamala Harris: Joe Biden announces vice presidential pick
Hopefully Kamala gets Biden old self to agree to some progressive ideas
Can‚Äôt wait to vote for you and VP Biden, ma‚Äôam.
I muted the words Trump, Biden, Kamala, and Harris like 10 months ago.
I don‚Äôt give a shit if Bubbles was Biden‚Äôs VP pick...im still voting 45‚Äôs ass out on November 3rd
Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP choice was my top pick, too. Let‚Äôs go!üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ

Guessing this pushes Biden over the margin of error in polls
Hell Yes!!!#KHive
Hear me out, Joe Biden is the SPAC sponsor and is going to make Kamala Harris the President in the de-SPAC
BREAKING: Kamala Harris selected by Joe Biden as vice-presidential running mate
So Joe Biden picked the woman who as a front runner in the primary took a couple shots from Tulsi Gabbard (who never managed to really gain more than 2% or so in primary voting), and was never able to recover from the sudden spiral of her campaign. #CmonMan
Biden picks Harris.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris coming together to arrest as many Black men as possible (if selected)
Biden could‚Äôve spared all the dramatics, just picked Kamala months ago and stfu about Black people. Lol she would‚Äôve took it from there.

BREAKING: WASHINGTON ( ‚Äî Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP, making her the first Black woman on major party presidential ticket.
#BREAKING: Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday.
I think soon to be president elect Biden‚Äôs VP choice will be Senator Warren. Whatchall think?
. Biden is expected to announce his pick for vice president, as early as today, CNN is reporting.   Who do you think he has chosen?    #elections2020 #Decision2020
Sony's gonna announce price and Biden's gonna announce VP and the NCAA are gonna throw in the towel all on the same day. Tomorrow.
Two days ago, I tweeted Biden will announce his VP pick on Wednesday. Looks like that could turn out to be correct
Isnt proclaiming you're voting Biden because Trump is bad the very definition of tribalism?  What got us Trump (1reason) was him insulting  then insulting  for being corrupt &amp; screwing us over.  Turns out, people were willing to vote him bec of that one truth.
Step back and realize, this should be a slam dunk election.  The pleas to vote Biden &amp; whoever he picks as his woke female VP only highlights how unhelpful  are. Shouldnt even be a contest.   "Trump will kill us all" was tried in 2016. It didnt win.
Men are fucking idiots, and I am sorry.  I'm a Biden man, and fuck the Cultists who aren't.
Joe Biden is probably picking Kamala.. most obvious for the Dem party to push her to run for pres after Biden
why are you so focused on a Black woman being VP for Joe Biden??? That's not what Black people whose lineage leads to slavery need??? They need Reparations and Reparations only for Black people whose lineage to slavery #ADOS #ADOSPolitics
everyone is allowed just one crack at the "Biden has selected his VP, it's [hilariously bad choice]" joke. this, obviously, includes Biden, who will be posting the last one.
When/if Biden wins he'll be out on his ass. Impeachment of cronies is too much a distraction while the Abomination that makes Desolation sits at the Resolute Desk.
BREAKING: Former Vice President Joe Biden announces CJ Cregg as Vice President. Allison Janney has agreed to stay in-character for the duration of his term.
Any chance you can get a third parties perspective on Trump and Biden, Trump represents National Socialism, Joe Bide, I voted for in the Democrat Primary to prevent the race being a choice between a NARCISIST (Trump) vs Communist (Sanders)?
What does this have to do with Reparations again?
Really hoping the #VPPick is Kamala Harris even more now just to piss off all the immature RWNJ's bleating about which one of her accounts still follows Joe Biden on twitter.
Like I say in an upcoming pod there is no charge Rs can level against Biden that Trump doesn't have 1000% worse.  Case in point: gaffes. Biden says 1 dumb thing.  Everything Trump says is dumb. He's literally an idiot.
Hopefully Trump gets voted out in November but the scary part is what he‚Äôll do to finish out his term between Election Day and the Inauguration... also it would be wild if more people show up for Kanye‚Äôs... I mean Biden‚Äôs inauguration during a pandemic than they did for Trumps üò≠
He says if Biden wins 180m people will lose their health care. As he goes to court trying to end people's health care.

So if all 14.4% broke for Biden, there's a 0.001 chance he wins Utah too?  My rudimentary statistics is likely wildly off but it does not seem coincidental that outstanding undecideds appear to be larger than the lead of the leader...  Legit believe they are soul-searching in UT
Ain't no way Biden writing or formulating his thoughts well enough to tell somebody to write his tweets. #Biden2020
For Biden VP?
Joe Biden had the cognitive ability to ride a bike and crack wise at State TV.  Your father can't pronounce basic words correctly.  Shut the fuck up, Jr.
This just in, God... ‚Äú Myyy Me, I thought TV money hungry Evangelistic were bad, what the hell did I do to deserve this guy, Trump, I‚Äôm voting for Biden‚Äù.
Yea I guess....... Seems unlikely, but again who knows.  Credit to the Biden camp for keeping a tight lid.  There is NO way he gets out of the African American Female selection IMO.
Hahahaha, Biden much like Trump has ZERO business in government. But it shows that the 2 parties will put just anything with barely a heartbeat and the sheeple will vote for it!!!
Couple that with MI being 16 EVs, maybe the Biden camp feels MI is a must-win.  IDK, but it sure seems odd that she enters this race at the 9th hour as a contender.
I would never doubt Joe Biden's faith, but I also have significant anxiety at the idea of him going to a worship service during a pandemic when those activities have shown to be highly efficient for spreading the virus.
Boomers.  My mom's friend seriously believes Joe Biden is a Commie who's controlled by the Bernie wing of the party.  So do all of her friend's friends.  Anecdotal, but I do know a good amount of Republicans and so-called independents that lap this stuff up.
Or, Biden understands MI is a "must-win" b/c he realizes that FL, NC, GA, OH, IA, and TX - no matter the Dem polling enthusiasm - are not winnable in the end.  He sees that AZ likely goes GOP.  Thus he knows that MI, WI, MN are must wins with PA being true tossup.  Just spitballn
I wonder who Biden's running mate is going to be.  It's between Harris and Bass I think.  #JoeBiden2020
Trump can't even drain the virus, his administration proved their the swamp, how many members of trump team got caught misusing government funds compared to Obama/Biden team. I'll tell you this, trump administration will go down in history for their swamp tactics
REPORT: Michigan Gov. Whitmer met with #Biden as he nears VP decision
Black Americans running to the poles for Biden and his 1st blk female running mate. Black and brown people pushing for the prosecution of trump and his family. Stealing American taxpayers dollars and nonprofit to pay back that 2 billion he old Deutsche bank, lock his ass up
Ya you do ... you get people like Trump and Biden!!!  But hey garbage candidates by the two parties that morons rush to put in office.. so ya thanks for the garbage !!!
Blah,blah,blah... the one on the moral high ground is you. And what‚Äôs funny no matter what the Democrats or Republicans put up simpletons like you on both side rush to put them in office even if they have no business in office ( Trump and Biden).
Seriously? Trump is literally moments away from shitting himself on stage &amp; making a Hitler mustache out of it, which people like you would cheer as a work of art. Yes, Joe Biden will be able to do a much better and be more competent job on day 1 than Trump after almost 4 years.
Really have to wonder why Whitmer is on the short list - is Biden down in MI?
It bothers me that Biden in picking a VP candidate at all!
Biden said, He ain't black.
The surprise Biden pick going right for the evangelical vote!
...Not saying Biden will unveil an MFA bill on Day 1, he won't. But voters need to keep electing more liberal congresspersons and push those people to pass such bills.  I firmly believe if Biden were given a Dem-Passed MFA bill, he would sign it.
Biden stated agenda might be exactly same as some more left voters would like, but Biden is much closer to them than anyone in Trumpistan...plus, new wave of more liberal Congresspeople (prior and upcoming cycle) (1/2)
Dear Meghan McCain, I'm Voting for Biden every time I go to #starbucks Coffee and get myself a Cup (Of Joe).

Biden's #1 excuse for perpetual inaction is going to be that he doesn't have 60 Senators.
Don‚Äôt waste your vote on Biden. You are only taking away votes from Jorgensen.
Biden says he would not add to the border wall if elected
If Biden has been lying so he can keep it all white it‚Äôs not going to work so let‚Äôs be clear she better have a brown skin
If Biden pick Governor Whitmer for VP he can forget black votes may as well pick West. He will loose the black vote so he better be careful when he chooses
No, no, no, no, no damn bike race.  Should be a Festivus Contest, where Biden gets to pin Trump after the Biden "Airing of Grievances" in a "Feats of Strength" contest
It is a dumb thing to say because there's diversity in all cultures, races, and ethnicities. Biden should know this. Biden needs to re-educate himself and stop thinking like a racist
SC was actually favorable for Biden in a lot of polls, tbf.
he is also who  wanted to pick as his VP. said TK was his heart pick but Joe Biden was his head pick, and that sometimes he makes decisions with his heart, sometimes his head. for this, he felt he had to go with his head. love TK.
I‚Äôm not necessarily a Libertarian but if one had an actual chance of winning, I‚Äôd easily vote for them over Trump or Biden.
Fuck Joe Biden
yall were real quiet about what biden said
No serious commentator really thinks we can move Biden left. lol
I mean, it sure seems that way.  I will concede that Biden probably won, but I don't think the margin was really that big.
Who Crime Bill Joe Biden selects as VP is not as important as a Black Agenda that includes Reparations for #ADOS
Sigh.  Career politician promises this time it'll be different.  "Economy that works for everyone"  But doesnt include UBI, M4A, breaking up tech, breaking up lobbying/cronyism, term limits...  Biden's main policy is "trump is a bad person"  #Unity2020
Trump jr better pray Biden don't win, better believe his A.G diving into everything the last administration did illegal, and between the A.G and NY prosecutor this family days are numbered. Greed go be their downfall and the joy in 72% of Americans heart will be priceless
CNN is not even confident Biden can win
It's interesting how CNN is calling this presidential election by saying Biden can still lose
This is the interview where Joe Biden showed his true colors.Can imagine if Trump said that, they would crucified him on the left.
Yes indeed!!! Biden, the DNC, the Democratic Party in general are going to be in for a big surprise
Yeah, completely agree. Bernie has crossover appeal, Biden is just Biden. If its comes down to it I'm voting Trump or 3rd Party. I have no interest in Biden winning just to step down for his VP to take over.
Nothing. It‚Äôs one of a great many reasons I didn‚Äôt vote for him in 2016 and will be voting for Biden this year. #FakeChristianTrump #VoteBlue2020
Biden is being told by certain Democratic insiders not to debate Trump. Whether he debates Trump does not matter. Biden's lack of a Black Agenda via Reparations is why he's going to lose #ADOS #ADOSPolitics

WHAAAT?!?!?!
#Democrats be looking stupid doing stuff like this. His comments on Latinos being more diverse than us is extremely ignorant at best. Biden just keep saying dumb ishhh as time passes closer to the election. And the sad part is, some of our people tolerate this. WTF???

I see you on here Sister. How have you been doing??? Haven't been on here this week but what I'm seeing and hearing out of Biden is beyond pathetic
Kamala and Biden go together like peanut butter and jelly when it comes to being tough on crime
I sometimes wonder if the Democrats are really trying to throw the election.  Joe Biden is a walking gaffe.  He puts his foot in his mouth more than I do, and that's VERY hard.
I‚Äôm just blown away at Biden‚Äôs lack of awareness
I don't know - I guess I can't be "sure."  It's just that I don't believe Biden will excite enough voters from those traditional R states to come out overwhelming to win them.
Trump's strategy with the press conferences has been a complete 180 - in a good way.  He keeps doing what he is doing and let Biden gaffe away.
This is a "Current" picture of Joe Biden  ... look close at "divet / hole in his right forehead and receding hairline!  I've been bombarded by a multiple Ads ... where Biden looks like he is a 50 year old!  But "DemoRats" won't Let Him DEBATE!  I AM A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT !

US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election #SmartNews
The Lincoln Project  &amp; Republicans against trump Will help Biden get over the finish line.  It's impossible for trump to get to 270 electoral votes with Biden winning majority of those states. They'll be quite a few Republicans in the senate vote for Biden. They tired of trump
Essential. Pennsylvania has 20 EVs, Michigan has 16 and Wisconsin has 10. Plus, if Biden can't win Pennsylvania, he's probably done since he was known as the state's "third senator."
WASHINGTON ( ‚Äî US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
In that scenario, Biden would still win the White House if he lost all the tossups, yes.
NC has 15 EVs and Florida has 29. So that would be 290-169 Biden with 79 EVs undecided. Arizona has 11 EVs.
Trump supporters are making Joe Biden sound cool af! Wow!
Shitttttt!    Black voters not voting for trump, matter of fact we coming out for Joe Biden like we did in 2012 for Obama especially after the Obama's come out campaigning with Joe. Watch how anxious black Americans get know they'll see Obama's on the w.h lawn instead of russians
If trump think these great job numbers he must of thought Obama/Biden job numbers we're remarkable. 4 years ago everything was better now people can't even have gatherings, send kids to school safely and we have the worst covid-19 cases in the world only change was the president
America wont be America anymore if Biden gets the reins. I'm just glad it isnt Bernie cuz then we would really be fucked
No he dropped out people writing him in will only split the vote from Biden and make it easier for trump to win. The better a third party does the worse the candidate closest to them will do its called the spoiler effects
I've seen the polling but still struggle to believe Florida and North Carolina go for Biden. Big grey Texas is wild to see.
Then DON'T vote for Biden!
Joe Biden apologizes for comments on diversity among Black people
Worst economy this country has ever seen, Obama/Biden just saved us from a recession just for captain dumb ass to put us right back in a recession
Trump need to look at all the mismanagement of government funds, damn near everybody in his administration is guilty of using tax payers dollars illegally, his kids as well. Biden and his A G will make sure the American people find out before he have them all prosecuted
Whose going after the "Black Vote"? Not Biden. The numbers are better in the Hispanic middle majority. They know Biden will open the gates to the world, and leave that "Black Vote" behind for someone else to pick up the scrapings. He don't need it, he's got millions of illegals!

So your argument is that Biden is more racist than Trump?  The Alt-Right love retweeting you and they would say "You one of the good ones"  Walk tall.
Then you shouldn't be excusing Joe Biden's racist behavior.
I'm not sure their ads are working though. They get a lot of likes and retweets, but that's because they're satisfying to people who are already voting against Trump anyways.  I doubt they're convincing many people to either vote for Biden or simply not to vote for Trump.

I'm not Catholic, but I do know that poisoning and  dismembering ANY life, born or unborn, is murder, and Catholics can't support that. Neither you, Biden, nor ANYONE can justify that with your faith. Don't strut your faith or Biden's when you both support outright infanticide.It's not really a fair discussion. If you don't fall in line with Biden, you get the "progressives don't vote so why should we cater to you." And if you do fall in line with Biden, they know they never have to do shit to get your vote for free. Don't fight impossible battles.
Professor Allan Lichtman has predicted every election since 1984, using a model he developed alongside Soviet Union scientists. This year, he's predicting  will be victorious.  #News3Politics
False narrative. We don't get along with MAGA neo-fascism. But Biden's record is unbearably adjacent to it. Almost seems like the centrists and the right team up against the left every cycle.
Christians rigging the election, there is nothing they will not do, nothing.
Hell no. Voting for Biden just because he isn't Trump is not logical either.

Biden deserves the credit. If Onama-Biden hadn't pandered to Iran, the rest of the Middle East may not be so quick to normalize relations with Israel. So, thanks Joe.
Well said Eileen, the more trump complains about someone the more fears them. Biden/Harris has him terrified so he does the only thing he can to try &amp; put someone down. That fool doesn't understand this won't work this time. Over the last 4 years he has proven his incompetence..
Its not about biden tho we talkn bout trump
We riding with Kamala no matter what We protecting Kamala by all means necessary  We voting for the Biden/Harris ticket like we did in 2012 We tired of the white house smelling like Smithfield packing everytime it rain outside,
Never Trumpers like myself, need not vote for Biden to stop Trump, just read the Constitution and block both Biden and Trump from achieving 270 Electoral votes and there could be a Biden-Pence admi nistration!
There were no stronger '16 Dem candidates than Hillary just like there are no stronger '20 Dem candidates today (outside of Michelle Obama) than Biden.  And Trump won one, and could likely win the subsequent election.  So I don't think that is quite good enough.
Hogan better pray Kamala and the NY D.A don't come together under Biden's A G and make public any and everything illegal this administration done. Keep in mind trump's already looked at for crimes with Micheal Cohen as well as misuse of nonprofit funds with his kid Open&amp;shut case
None of this matters until we replace King Trump with President Biden.  King Trump does not obey United States laws.
You can be as loud and as opposed to the things you want after Biden wins. Push them. Call them out. All of that is righteous.  Standing by and letting Trump become the next permanent president is way more immoral than compromising now to fight later.
There is no evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. There is no basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election.
Make a list of the ‚Äúway worse‚Äù things Biden has done over Trump! I want to see this shit! üòÇü§£
l'm happy to see you agree Stephen. Joe Biden will bring us together &amp; work towards healing the country
Independents are especially unimpressed with Kamala Harris.

And we all wonder- why post something obviously racist, if it doesn‚Äôt reflect ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs in your heart‚Äù?  Just admit you‚Äôre an old racist white man‚Äî we all know your truth now! Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'
Nader didn't put a gun to Al Gore's head and make him blow it, nor did he design the Florida butterfly ballot, nor did he give SCOTUS room to just shrug at the whole situation.  The Pied Pipers are the ones who said "the era of big government is over" and are forcing Biden on us.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Every single criticism of Biden and Harris represents an action I expect you to take daily after the election. #vote
I thought his mask mandate did involve governors making the decision. ‚ÄúEvery governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing. The estimates by the experts are that it will save over 40,000 lives in the next three months. Forty thousand lives, if people act responsibly.‚Äù -Joe Biden

On Thursday, after Harris was selected by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to serve as his running mate, President Donald Trump elevated the conspiracy while speaking to reporters from the White House podium.
If Biden wins, mark my words, they WILL be coming for them. #VoteRed
Would the Biden campaign have been so sloppy? We leave that to the Trump people.
#FailedPresident took a thriving economy (thank you President Obama and VP Biden) and drove it into the ground. We now have the #TrumpDepression along with the #TrumpVirus. 5.2 million Americans infected and +167,000 Americans dead since February.

Biden &amp; Harris need to host daily demonstrations at the Washington Monument or on the Mall in DC EVERY DAY until the USPS is funded and protected by #Congress, and the postmaster general fraudster is impeached. Voting rights are the whole campaign!
You got that right! Now they are saying Kamala Harris isnt African American... THEY ARE THROWING EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK AT BIDEN/HARRIS! #PanicInDC
This is great! Biden supporters can‚Äôt handle the truth! Instead, they try to get me banned! Proud to be 100% problematic for Democrats!! I‚Äôm just getting started!

LOL... Biden better hire a food taster pronto. They need to check every can of Ensure and cup of apple sauce he gets.
I‚Äôm sure I could find a hat for Biden made in China. China is eating this stuff up. I purchase all of my material from  Everything is made in the USA. I as well as millions choose to purchase made in America. One thing we can all agree on.
I use these quotes every time someone in a red hat posts something about Biden‚Äôs mental acuity.

Please, please, please do it already. Confront the lying idiot. He won‚Äôt evict you because he doesn‚Äôt want Biden to get more press than he does. Now is the time.

Tbh I don't plan on shaming any trump voters into voting for Biden  Running a campaign on not being trump is fucking stupid, they did that already and it failed  It's pretty clear the  doesn't wanna move us forward  If  wants to win he needs to earn it
Im waiting on yalls alternative since ya dont wanna vote but you hate Trump but you‚Äôll go to the ends to explain why Biden/Harris dont need to be elected. just get Trump out, can we start there ?
She responded to my tweet, I asked the person who tweeted the original one she responded to ‚Äúso it‚Äôs gonna lay on the shoulders of all women? No way‚Äù i deleted my tweet because I didn‚Äôt feel like dealing with the guy who said what he said about ALL women voting for Biden.
Focus on what #45 should be talking about to attack this country‚Äôs problems, NOT on why #45 attacks on Senator Harris are not sticking...why major in the minor, his attacks on the Biden/Harris team, won‚Äôt solve our problems..MAKE him address the issues!

"If you're  You aint black." Joe Biden, August 2020.
We do not have to vote for Joe Biden to stop Donald Trump.
I doubt he treats trump supporters like they have no brain. That would be Biden supporters. It really doesn‚Äôt take rocket science.
I have come to the conclusion that there is no help for Biden, his administration, or his followers! They say the most ignorant stuff and want to vote for someone who has NO policies! SMH.
Also.. A LOT has been thrown at this man &amp; he has diligently given above &amp; beyond to every single hurdle &amp; STILL has numerous record breaking economic positive values. He‚Äôs made 1000 moves before Biden can get his sentence out. Like him or not, he runs the hell out of The USA.
Biden had asthma from childhood. Trumps daddy paid for a fake diagnosis of bone spurs. And you respect trump?
You can‚Äôt comprehend what you read. ‚Äú China prefers President Trump losing the election, because Beijing considers him "unpredictable," while Russia is working to undermine Democrat Joe Biden.
Biden had asthma from childhood
But they want to talk about how Biden speaks. And Trump shouldn‚Äôt have been in speech therapy class? Look at the fleas on fluffy if you didn‚Äôt get that it‚Äôs like the pot calling the kettle black.ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èijs

Literally lmao today everything the administration is putting out is backfiring &amp; making the Biden/Harris campaign rational &amp; people are willing to back? They keep throwing jabs &amp; the Twitter fam keeps saying NOPE try again! Keep up the good worküëç best day ever!
Maybe, like real journalists  do, you should have looked at her info or asked her or asked Biden team before starting your racist rant
Biden once had the same friends he just can‚Äôt remember.
You can throw memes all day but I can promise Biden‚Äôs are funnier!
He has a page   please send there. So he can find them himself. Many thanks to all of you my dear friends. l feel real peace tonight now that we have the  Biden/Harris ticket. lts as if a calm has  washed over me as if to say "We will do this, together we will"
Here's the plan: post-election, invoke 25th Amendment as needed. Biden "retires" after 2 years. Then, constitutionally, the Tamil-Jamaican descendent of slaveholders can serve for up to 10 years as President.
Didn‚Äôt she have some of the lowest points of all candidates during the debates where she called out Biden as basically being racist?
Why do believe Christine and not Tara? Why do you believe a guy like Joe Biden who fondles little girls? Why do you believe Joe Biden who touches women inappropriately? Why do you believe Joe Biden when he brags about little kids touching his hairy legs?
Saw the clip where Sen Klobuchar withdrew from the race and endorsed VP Biden.  He appeared in the screen, hugged her, and you could see such emotion on his face.  An "I do want to win, but I didn't want you to lose."  Empathy...a good Dude.  We do indeed need this.
The only thing  has done for me is to have shown me how ignorant and stupid he is and how many people are just as toxic as he is. Even if you don‚Äôt like Biden/Harris how could you EVER think Trump is better?#whathasTrumpdone4ulately #TrumpKillsUSPS

It‚Äôs not the black vote that‚Äôs going to get Biden/Harris in office. It‚Äôs the Bernie/Warren stans...if they mobilize and vote. Take a play from the Republicans.
trump wants that label not us, don't give him the satisfaction. Mighty  NOT nasty. Let's try that one instead. Biden/Harris is a great ticket we can be proud of. They need our 100 % support. Sending you positive thoughts &amp; blessings to you &amp; yours. Stay safe my friend
Facts! However... they keep bringing up stuff trump supposedly did over 30 years ago so why can‚Äôt they say he has evolved?! Yet Biden does it daily and because he admits them it‚Äôs ok. Yet he has no policies that help the communities. He has NO policies. Hypocrisy!
Biden won me over from jump. He said Get Behind Ms Harris. I like that!!  They are going to have different views on the same issues and agrees to disagree right up front. I like him. He understands. #BidenHarris2020
Appointment would be made by the Democratic governor if Biden/Harris win in November. Here's a decent rundown of the possible replacements.

Agree! Before the bromance- chose  to balance the ticket. And now we know that Biden's selection of  , his own balanced ticket approach, has been a smashing success- just as  &amp; I predicted
I keep mispronouncing her name and it is accidental. I have been practicing because I will be saying it every day as I work for the Biden/Harris ticket. But when someone says something really STUPID I pronounce EVERYTHING WRONG.
Interns. Can‚Äôt you tell they sound intelligent. Can you imagine an actual Biden tweet. He would run out of letters before anything was coherent
Let‚Äôs go Team Biden/Harris....
Y‚Äôall watchin biden wit that lil smirk on his face right now lol
Watch Live: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make first appearance as running mates
Watch Live: Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era.
That‚Äôs the best reason to elect Biden. Besides the fact that he‚Äôs not morally bankrupt like Trump is.
I hope Biden finds a spot for Khizr Khan in his cabinet.  This man is a true patriot and as a lot to offer this country.
Trump with more socialist spending.  Trump - Socialism Biden - Extreme Socialism Jorgensen - Free Market Capitalism #Jorgensen2020
This might be an outlier since so many people do not have confidence Biden will finish the full term.
Beaugh Biden
If you believe black lives matter then Jorgensen-Cohen is your ticket, not Biden-Harris.
Joe Biden did another goofy move by picking her he wants black votes so bad it‚Äôs pathetic.. I‚Äôm not a Trump supporter either but he did way more than a lot of mfs..  Yet all these politicians are FU and corrupted ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Here‚Äôs a thought Biden has been in office for decades. The issue today have been the same for decades.  So if  hasn‚Äôt been able fix them in decades how will he fix them in 4 years? Try giving  an honest chance.  Work with him not against him.
Video shows  asking  to be vice presidential running mate
Want to join me for this Joe Biden for President event?
I can see mothers and their children being released from cages with a Biden/Harris administration. That mother's instinct won't stand by and watch it happen    I can see police prosecuted for killing unarmed black/brown people cause a mom always saying what if that was my child
The Final Lap: DID THE OBAMA- BIDEN - KERRY-  CLINTON IRAN DEAL S...
538 gives Biden 71% chance of winning. I want 100%. I don‚Äôt want Trump.
Kamala for sure would have been on Biden's short list regardless of committing to pick a woman and regardless of BLM protests. So I'm not saying she was picked because of tokenism, I'm just saying I don't believe she's the candidate most black people feel "represents" them.
Biden-Harris first joint presser at 3:50pm this afternoon.
If you vote Joe Biden you pretty much support a Pedo.
It's a weird situation because because Kamala would have been on Biden's short list even before committing to pick a woman and  before George Floyd, and those same headlines would show up.  But it just feels like so much more cynical now.
It's not Omar, nor is it Biden; it's the people that are behind them that is the threat to American's way of life.
Kamala &amp; Biden are not ideal, no. but yall would rather vote Trump again? lol ok....
The Final Lap: WHO LOVES JOE BIDEN ?
TFW you're on the Biden ticket

Trump says 'suburban housewife' will vote for him over Biden, cites low-income housing policies  #FoxNews
Awww.. is someone vexed?! I don‚Äôt claim to be Native American although I do carry a good amount. From more than 1 tribe. Sooo if your dad raped your mom.. does that make you less black? Shoot only Biden can say that right?! U are the racist one here. Seems ur a little angry.
I don't support either lol nor have I ever voted. However its many more tangibles Biden/Harris have done to the detriment of the Black community than Trump
If you think black lives matter and want true criminal justice reform, vote Jorgensen/Cohen, not Biden/Harris. #Jorgensen2020 #LetHerSpeak #ShesWithUs #VoteGold
‚ÄúWhite women‚Äù will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where minorities would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with *insert random black politician* in charge!

Yes but that's misleading. Every President has signed a law funding HBCUs. Biden's plan  increases funding from $400 million to $70 billion.......
Keen observers point out unusual elements of Biden‚Äôs Instagram post with Harris  #FoxNews
Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals  #FoxNews
Lmao imagine thinking Biden will do anything but nominate a conservative.
Biden says he will get rid of COVID19....simply stop reporting it and release all the restraints! BOMB! NO MORE COVID19.
How very post-modern and relativistic....
It is kind of creepy but look at Biden and look at Trump
Biden shoulda picked my baby Tulsi as his running mate smh
538 reports that Biden has 71% chance of winning. Pretty good odds.    I want it to be 100% certain that we‚Äôre getting rid of Trump. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Biden and Kamala are wack but they‚Äôre safe enough bets to convince people in the middle to vote blue. Trash but could be worse
i missed the part where she said Joe Biden kept her from going to good schools...  can someone point me to the part of the video where that happens?
Really?  You think Sen. Harris has that much positive influence to solidly swing PA to Biden?
I had to send this out to my friends ‚ô•Ô∏è in a tweeterville. The pompas ass, need I say more, has opened his pie hole again to attack the dynamic duo. Saying Kamala Harris was a nasty so and so who wanted to kick Joe Biden's teeth in. And he didn't know what sleepy Joe was thinking
How about What Joe Biden did to Tara Reade.
How about What Joe Biden did to Tara Reade.
Why does everyone call Biden a pedo when trump allegedly raped a 13 year old girl who was tied up?  Are there any alleged stories of Biden raping a kid? Let me do some research and I will get back to you
Even "Trump Haters" don't want Joe!!!!! Why I Want Biden to Lose More than I Want Trump to Win
Kamala Harris, singlehandedly, is responsible for thousands of POC being wrongfully incarcerated all over the US for nonviolent crimes (majority marijuana). If you are planning on voting Biden, how do you feel about this? Isn‚Äôt this what we‚Äôre fighting against the most?
I 100% agree. Four more years of "dictator trump" &amp; we will have a country thats unrecognizable with a democracy thats lost. Biden/Harris ticket is our chance to secure a future for our children. Restore civility when we remove the blight from  OUR W.H.  We can, we will do this!
seriously what's wrong with all the people who are like "at least BIDEN won't be doing all that TWEETING"
Biden/Harris are NOT progressive at all
Excited to hear  acceptance speech for the VP pick on the Biden ticket! #NeverGiveUp
Morning friends, we have the team that will take back the country &amp;  save our democracy Biden/Harris! We must do everything in our power to make sure they win on Nov 3rd Call your local chapter 1st time voter needs to be registered, volunteer,  help anyway you can. We can do this
I know i liked her too but they threw her out like trash and she still endorsed Biden. That tells me alot about her too. :(
Me realizing that the only way to get trump out of office is voting for Biden and Kamala üôÉ
Congratulations I‚Äôm excited to support my AKA Soror for the Vice Presidential running mate ofJoe Biden!!!üíïüíïüíï
Lol. Please show me where Biden has control over anything?!
Haha... Biden needs to get one first because Kamala doesn‚Äôt fit the agenda.
Local politicians react to #KamalaHarris as Biden's pick for running mate
I‚Äôve done my research, but thank you. Not guilty and had many black tenants. People get accused all the time, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs so. That‚Äôs called pulling the race card. Biden says black people aren‚Äôt diverse in fact.. they aren‚Äôt black, but here we are. #üöÇüöÇ
Funny thing is.... no one has said a damn thing Biden has done! In this whole comment section! Hahaha. SMH
Idt anybody is saying they want trump in office they jus talking about biden an harris aint about to be any better lol
Id still vote for biden but congress is about to run slam over biden an harris watch. They honestly not about shit. We all knew how trump was about to be in office an he showed us exactly that. Biden aint really no better tbh he jus not bigoted he still wild tho
How  kept his VP pick a secret
Biden was a known and established name and groundwork was already laid for him in the South. All it took was one massive win in SC for the other candidates to realize that. Pandemic didn't help much either
You know that Biden is a pedophile right?
The absolute meltdown going on in the American political right pretty much verifies that Biden made the right choice. The louder the GOPers freak out, the better something is for the rest of us. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
Harris was downright nasty towards Biden during the debates. She also says that she believes Biden's accusers. Everything says that this isn't a good match. I refuse to support Harris. The one who gets hurt is Biden because he lost my vote because he picked Harris.
...its not going to take 4 years of Biden being president for me to see if he's a good person, I'm already kinda iffy bout Joe. every 4 years we have the right to choose between the lesser of 2 evils... that has never sat right with me. yeah our people died for these rights but..
I think Biden's VP choice is really going to help him lock up that California vote.
Do you honestly believe that we live in a democracy? Or that any of this will change under Biden? A corporate duopoly controls our representation at almost every level of government. You're acquiescing to one wing of it, hoping it'll eventually be what you idealize it to be.
Is anyone really surprised he chose Kamala? We‚Äôre literally back where we started, the lesser of 2 evils. Granted, yes, Biden and Kamala are leagues better than Trump and Pence, HOWEVER both have shown to be underhanded, shady, and untrustworthy. But this is America so.
Biden could‚Äôve picked anyone LITERALLY anyone
Trump was relatively unknown and Clinton was known for decades.  Biden has been known for decades, and in 4 years Trump has literally nearly destroyed America.  No wonder it doesn't work this time around.
People,  we have two choices:  Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris. If you don't vote, you don't get to bitch for the next 4 years.Remember, it isn't just POTUS &amp; VPOTUS. There will be at least 2~ 3 SCOTUS  nominations &amp; a butt ton of federal judges to be appointed.
#BidenHarris Here's what Kamala Harris brings to Joe Biden's campaign for president
we know you don‚Äôt want to support the Biden/Harris ticket. We know you want to send the troops home and reform the VA. We know you want criminal justice reform. We know you want end the war on drugs. We know you want Jorgensen/Cohen 2020. #Jorgensen2020
Who cares!  Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate so who cares about what anybody in the trump family trying to talk about,  bad enough the trump virus killed more Americans than the country the virus originated from. Biden would've never let this happen, trump sorry ass
Does it even matter who Biden chose? Short of ALL OUT CHEATING,  will WIN BIG!
The SCOTUS argument is a common one, but not compelling. (Re: anita hill) Biden's probably even likely to nominate a moderate/conservative, IMO.
A real VP don't kiss a president ass like trump picked,  *scared to stand up for himself  *neither trump/pense wives known for being intelligent like Dr.Biden or Kamala  *one wife known for getting butt naked and pense wife constantly made fun of on cartoon president  üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
No disrespect at all. I think it's gonna take a fellow Bernie Bro turned Biden voter to convince me to vote Biden. Just haven't heard anything but "he's not Trump" yet, despite him being terrifyingly ideologically adjacent to Trump from my POV. How do you rationalize it?
She calls Biden EXACTLY what he is. "A Lying, Racist White man."
Not for nothing, but I'm glad Joe Biden didn't listen to whoever was going on about how Kamala was "too ambitious." Because what a crock of shit THAT was. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
To President candidate Joe Biden congratulations on picking Kamala Harris as your VP we got your back. We are not listening to trump he is too ignorant
Def let people be excited but also let people be leery too, it‚Äôs deserved. I wish Kamala all the best, but just like Biden needs his feet held to the fire so will she.  That‚Äôs what we need the leery people for.
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate in historic first for a woman of color
Kamala and Biden are more Republican than Trump
Less than two weeks ago Biden made a second disparaging comment about Black people. They‚Äôre not wrong.
I get it. He isn't an ideal candidate like Hillary. He's establishment. We hate establishment, but unfortunately it's the only way to get rid of Trump.  Biden will get my vote....but it hurts
You couldn't be more right. As a hardcore Bernie supporter/progressive I protest voted 3rd party in the election that got us where we are now. I'm terrified others will do the same this Nov. More than half the progressives I know are refusing to vote for Biden. I don't blame them
Like Hillary lost by a football stadium of voters in 2016.. Biden and Kamala shouldn‚Äôt have a problem with Trump.
I‚Äôm thinking about the Dem primary.. them old folks came out for Biden and they‚Äôre really reliable
But I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden has this election in the bag
The difference between trump and Joe, *Trump scared of women that speak up and know who they are *Biden admire women that standing up for themselves and that's one of the differences.  So all HBCU's So all sororities  So all fraternities  Let's get ready, trump gotta go 1/21
I dont want to vote for Biden but I‚Äôm tired of trump
Just a female of color. A ticket balancer. Mostly,  not a double white moderate ticket like the 2016 ticket
The same planet where someone thinks Joe Biden would make a good president.
#biden picks #harris  Pretty strong argument can be made that he didnt pick a black woman to garner favor with black people, but to virtue signal to white suburban PMC women. (He already has strong black support). Her value added is if shes good at fundraising.
This ain‚Äôt nothing, but a cover-up so #Biden don‚Äôt look #racist. So, now we got to choose between the ‚Äúin your face‚Äù racist or the ‚Äúcloseted‚Äù racist.  #BidenHarris2020 #thiselectionisamess
Interesting that Biden doesn't count but Kerry, Kaine, and, uh, Biden do.
Don't nobody care to look at trump,   Show Kamala Harris being escorted around by her new secret service team. Looks like we're well on our way to have tge 1st black woman president in a few years.    I'm so damn proud of Joe Biden for picking someone he's guaranteed to win with
Yall say joe biden not capable ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£Trump says Spanish Flu of 1918 ended WWII - a conflict that didn't start until two decades later
I can call someone all types of stuff but if they still want to give me a million dollars Ima take it lol. Biden should be the one asking himself why he picked her. Probably picked her because she‚Äôs not afraid to hold back her toungue. She‚Äôll be tough.
Why there's never any people of color in none of trump's old photos or videos? Biden out did trump with just his VP pick. Can't wait to see his diverse administration, not many people of color now and we tired of the white house smelling like chittlings whenever it rain outside
I just dont see biden an harris gettin elected. Like wtf are they gona do to get them votes lmao yall better get ready for trump for next 4
Kamala Harris still not a good choice as Biden's VP
Yang: BIDEN WILL PASS UBI IN THE FIRST TERM   Biden:
There are literally two candidates for VP that Biden could've picked where I might have voted for him. Those are Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard. Since he didn't, Biden can suck it.  Okay, who am I kidding? I wouldn't have voted for Biden, anyway.
Now it's our job to get behind them both. Kamala Harris will support Joe Biden just as Joe did with Pres Obama. She is highly qualified. This will be a great WINNING TICKET.
Lol  anyone who thought Biden wouldn't pick Kamala as his running mate. It's pure theater, lol.
Live now: President Donald Trump his holding a press conference, where he is expected to react to Kamala Harris being selected as Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate.  #News3Politics
Congratulations to Kamala Harris. An intersting choice but I think I would have chosen Sen. Tammy Duckworth.
Trump let‚Äôs have a bicycle race between you and Biden. Is it true you have to ride a golf cart to the crapper?
No matter who was chosen there was always going to be 3 outcomes for people: 1. I was voting for Trump regardless idc who he Biden picks. 2. I‚Äôm voting Biden cause I just want Trump out of office. 3. I‚Äôm not voting in this election I‚Äôm staying home.
Kamala supported legalization but not M4A... but other than that she‚Äôs pretty progressive on issues. Lets see what Biden will agree to..
Nothing much to say about this. Saw this coming the moment Biden and Dems took out Bernie. At the end of the day it‚Äôs Trump vs Biden so the VPs will have no real impact.
Zero chance Biden finishes a full term
Let the ball busting begin: It's Kamala Harris: Joe Biden announces vice presidential pick
Hopefully Kamala gets Biden old self to agree to some progressive ideas
#2020Elections I‚Äôm so excited that Biden chose Harris! I‚Äôll pay money to see her debate Pence! Even if I watch in my own living room. She‚Äôll decimate him in 25 words or less.
Can‚Äôt wait to vote for you and VP Biden, ma‚Äôam.
I muted the words Trump, Biden, Kamala, and Harris like 10 months ago.
I don‚Äôt give a shit if Bubbles was Biden‚Äôs VP pick...im still voting 45‚Äôs ass out on November 3rd

Hear me out, Joe Biden is the SPAC sponsor and is going to make Kamala Harris the President in the de-SPAC
BREAKING: Kamala Harris selected by Joe Biden as vice-presidential running mate
So Joe Biden picked the woman who as a front runner in the primary took a couple shots from Tulsi Gabbard (who never managed to really gain more than 2% or so in primary voting), and was never able to recover from the sudden spiral of her campaign. #CmonMan
Biden picks Harris.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris coming together to arrest as many Black men as possible (if selected)
Biden could‚Äôve spared all the dramatics, just picked Kamala months ago and stfu about Black people. Lol she would‚Äôve took it from there.
Biden‚Äôs VP pick is in!  It‚Äôs
#BREAKING: Sen.  of #California will be  running mate in the 2020 presidential election. The presumptive Democratic nominee announced Tuesday that Harris is his pick for vice president.  #News3Politics
It‚Äôs Official‚ÄîJoe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate.    #BidenVP
BREAKING: WASHINGTON ( ‚Äî Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP, making her the first Black woman on major party presidential ticket.
#BREAKING: Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday.
I think soon to be president elect Biden‚Äôs VP choice will be Senator Warren. Whatchall think?
. Biden is expected to announce his pick for vice president, as early as today, CNN is reporting.   Who do you think he has chosen?    #elections2020 #Decision2020
Sony's gonna announce price and Biden's gonna announce VP and the NCAA are gonna throw in the towel all on the same day. Tomorrow.
Two days ago, I tweeted Biden will announce his VP pick on Wednesday. Looks like that could turn out to be correct
Isnt proclaiming you're voting Biden because Trump is bad the very definition of tribalism?  What got us Trump (1reason) was him insulting  then insulting  for being corrupt &amp; screwing us over.  Turns out, people were willing to vote him bec of that one truth.
Step back and realize, this should be a slam dunk election.  The pleas to vote Biden &amp; whoever he picks as his woke female VP only highlights how unhelpful  are. Shouldnt even be a contest.   "Trump will kill us all" was tried in 2016. It didnt win.
Men are fucking idiots, and I am sorry.  I'm a Biden man, and fuck the Cultists who aren't.
Joe Biden is probably picking Kamala.. most obvious for the Dem party to push her to run for pres after Biden
why are you so focused on a Black woman being VP for Joe Biden??? That's not what Black people whose lineage leads to slavery need??? They need Reparations and Reparations only for Black people whose lineage to slavery #ADOS #ADOSPolitics
everyone is allowed just one crack at the "Biden has selected his VP, it's [hilariously bad choice]" joke. this, obviously, includes Biden, who will be posting the last one.
When/if Biden wins he'll be out on his ass. Impeachment of cronies is too much a distraction while the Abomination that makes Desolation sits at the Resolute Desk.
Joe Biden sure loves Cheetos
BREAKING: Former Vice President Joe Biden announces CJ Cregg as Vice President. Allison Janney has agreed to stay in-character for the duration of his term.
Any chance you can get a third parties perspective on Trump and Biden, Trump represents National Socialism, Joe Bide, I voted for in the Democrat Primary to prevent the race being a choice between a NARCISIST (Trump) vs Communist (Sanders)?
What does this have to do with Reparations again?
Really hoping the #VPPick is Kamala Harris even more now just to piss off all the immature RWNJ's bleating about which one of her accounts still follows Joe Biden on twitter.
Like I say in an upcoming pod there is no charge Rs can level against Biden that Trump doesn't have 1000% worse.  Case in point: gaffes. Biden says 1 dumb thing.  Everything Trump says is dumb. He's literally an idiot.
Hopefully Trump gets voted out in November but the scary part is what he‚Äôll do to finish out his term between Election Day and the Inauguration... also it would be wild if more people show up for Kanye‚Äôs... I mean Biden‚Äôs inauguration during a pandemic than they did for Trumps üò≠
He says if Biden wins 180m people will lose their health care. As he goes to court trying to end people's health care.

So if all 14.4% broke for Biden, there's a 0.001 chance he wins Utah too?  My rudimentary statistics is likely wildly off but it does not seem coincidental that outstanding undecideds appear to be larger than the lead of the leader...  Legit believe they are soul-searching in UT

Trump has 36% Approval Among Black Voters - Hey Biden, Hows That For Bei...  via #LiveCHAT #LiveNEWS #Trump2020
This just in, God... ‚Äú Myyy Me, I thought TV money hungry Evangelistic were bad, what the hell did I do to deserve this guy, Trump, I‚Äôm voting for Biden‚Äù.
Yea I guess....... Seems unlikely, but again who knows.  Credit to the Biden camp for keeping a tight lid.  There is NO way he gets out of the African American Female selection IMO.
Hahahaha, Biden much like Trump has ZERO business in government. But it shows that the 2 parties will put just anything with barely a heartbeat and the sheeple will vote for it!!!
Couple that with MI being 16 EVs, maybe the Biden camp feels MI is a must-win.  IDK, but it sure seems odd that she enters this race at the 9th hour as a contender.
I would never doubt Joe Biden's faith, but I also have significant anxiety at the idea of him going to a worship service during a pandemic when those activities have shown to be highly efficient for spreading the virus.
Boomers.  My mom's friend seriously believes Joe Biden is a Commie who's controlled by the Bernie wing of the party.  So do all of her friend's friends.  Anecdotal, but I do know a good amount of Republicans and so-called independents that lap this stuff up.
Or, Biden understands MI is a "must-win" b/c he realizes that FL, NC, GA, OH, IA, and TX - no matter the Dem polling enthusiasm - are not winnable in the end.  He sees that AZ likely goes GOP.  Thus he knows that MI, WI, MN are must wins with PA being true tossup.  Just spitballn
I wonder who Biden's running mate is going to be.  It's between Harris and Bass I think.  #JoeBiden2020
Trump can't even drain the virus, his administration proved their the swamp, how many members of trump team got caught misusing government funds compared to Obama/Biden team. I'll tell you this, trump administration will go down in history for their swamp tactics
REPORT: Michigan Gov. Whitmer met with #Biden as he nears VP decision
Black Americans running to the poles for Biden and his 1st blk female running mate. Black and brown people pushing for the prosecution of trump and his family. Stealing American taxpayers dollars and nonprofit to pay back that 2 billion he old Deutsche bank, lock his ass up
Ya you do ... you get people like Trump and Biden!!!  But hey garbage candidates by the two parties that morons rush to put in office.. so ya thanks for the garbage !!!
Blah,blah,blah... the one on the moral high ground is you. And what‚Äôs funny no matter what the Democrats or Republicans put up simpletons like you on both side rush to put them in office even if they have no business in office ( Trump and Biden).
Seriously? Trump is literally moments away from shitting himself on stage &amp; making a Hitler mustache out of it, which people like you would cheer as a work of art. Yes, Joe Biden will be able to do a much better and be more competent job on day 1 than Trump after almost 4 years.
Really have to wonder why Whitmer is on the short list - is Biden down in MI?
It bothers me that Biden in picking a VP candidate at all!
Biden said, He ain't black.
The surprise Biden pick going right for the evangelical vote!
...Not saying Biden will unveil an MFA bill on Day 1, he won't. But voters need to keep electing more liberal congresspersons and push those people to pass such bills.  I firmly believe if Biden were given a Dem-Passed MFA bill, he would sign it.
Biden stated agenda might be exactly same as some more left voters would like, but Biden is much closer to them than anyone in Trumpistan...plus, new wave of more liberal Congresspeople (prior and upcoming cycle) (1/2)
Dear Meghan McCain, I'm Voting for Biden every time I go to #starbucks Coffee and get myself a Cup (Of Joe).
Okay see. For all the bullshit people give Biden, does this seem like a man who can't handle the job?  I think not!
Encourage everyone to sign up and leave comments on survey urging VP Biden to support big bold progressive reform as soon as elected.  We need to grease those wheels as often as possible, now
Biden's #1 excuse for perpetual inaction is going to be that he doesn't have 60 Senators.
Don‚Äôt waste your vote on Biden. You are only taking away votes from Jorgensen.
Biden says he would not add to the border wall if elected
If Biden has been lying so he can keep it all white it‚Äôs not going to work so let‚Äôs be clear she better have a brown skin
If Biden pick Governor Whitmer for VP he can forget black votes may as well pick West. He will loose the black vote so he better be careful when he chooses
No, no, no, no, no damn bike race.  Should be a Festivus Contest, where Biden gets to pin Trump after the Biden "Airing of Grievances" in a "Feats of Strength" contest
It is a dumb thing to say because there's diversity in all cultures, races, and ethnicities. Biden should know this. Biden needs to re-educate himself and stop thinking like a racist
SC was actually favorable for Biden in a lot of polls, tbf.Kanye never sent anyone to jail. Id vote kanye over biden ANY day
You are an indicted felon. You &amp; the GOP are messed up. What does Putin have on you that you would sell your country out? It must be humongous. I can‚Äôt believe a Moscow Trump Hotel is worth treason- not even laundered Russian money. Russia or jail? Biden won‚Äôt pardon you. Resign.
I think my other tweet didn‚Äôt go through. I mentioned Hebnifer Hudson. After her family was killed he offered for her and her surviving family to stay in the Trump tower until the guy was caught. But he and Biden the same really
I mean, 79 though? One thing stands out was the support he gave to Jennifer Hudson when her family was murdered, he took her and the surviving family in at his hotel for safety. At the end though he and Biden, no difference. Zero
You've ruined everything. You'll go down in history as worse than Hoover. Can't wait for BIDEN &amp; HARRIS to get in and LEAD - you don't know how to LEAD!
And let‚Äôs not forget to shit on the Trump and Biden are the same crowd too
#HillaryForPrison will not testify in court about her #Benghazi activities nor her private emails to #Obama &amp; #WeinersLaptop  but she would serve #Biden and continue doing what she did before?
Smart of her it should keep moving north with Biden in office.
You lie. She said she's pleased to be a part of Biden's campaign. Prove I'm wrong.
Kamala Harris is 50% Indian, 25% White (her white grandfather‚Äôs ancestor was Hamilton Brown, infamous slave owner), and 25% Jamaican.  She ran for Senate as Indian American, and she's now African American after being selected as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate.
Like how Biden says ‚Äúcamel-a‚Äù? Micro aggression? Please.
If you didn't know anything else about Trump the hypocrite, this should be all you need to know to vote for Joe Biden.
I wasn't happy about Joe Biden and I'm flummoxed why Kamala Harris was even in contention. I'll vote for them but shit has got to change because these two are not progressive. They will change NOTHING for the maj of people and keep the status quo for the wealthy. #progressive
Yeah I don't mean to beat him up. I just get really frustrated when someone tries to draw an equivalency between Biden's rhetoric &amp; Trump's. It suggests that the intents are equivalent, which is hilarious. One is trying to protect people, while the other is only out for himself.
Exactly. The goal is to get rid of Trump. Period. If you sit it out because you're not sure Biden is the perfect solution you're giving Trump half a vote. What would have been a full vote for Biden is now no vote for Biden. Trump gains.
Joe Biden is on record multiple times for being against defunding the police.
Just read that Biden and Trump are tied among white voters. Not surprised, just disappointed.
I think the central question is are dems going to win PA, Michigan, et all via turnout or Obama ‚Äî&gt; Trump ‚Äî&gt; Biden voters.  Harris may be the center of the party, but is she a pick that‚Äôs going to appeal to the Scranton demo.
No surprise. Biden is not capable to answer questions. I can‚Äôt wait for the Trump Biden debates. More entertaining than the NFL!
Finally, this is what he would be CALLING for. The President doesn't have the authority to mandate this, and Biden had said as much in the past. He has said it's about leading by example.  So, again, this is a false equivalency.
GOP &amp; NRA accepted Russian money. Laundered? Johnson (WI) took Russian money for his campaign. Why these supposedly bright men would fall for Russian $ will be the unanswered question. These men were very foolish &amp; now will pay the price. Biden needs to reform our gov‚Äôt-for all.
This is Biden's quote:  "I would insist that everybody out in public be wearing that mask. Anyone to reopen would have to make sure that they walked into a business that had masks."
Probably Barr will indict Hunter Biden, and launch an investigation into Harris's citizenship.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are running on increasing taxes, defunding the police and taking away your guns.
Are you really serious here??  Biden is the biggest creep ever. There is videos proof of this pervert.   Please disappear and make everyone happy!!!
MSNBC:. You should be ashamed of  your coverage   If you want to talk about lies start with Biden and especially Kamala Harris. I hope all can see you are not a news agency and are only trying to dememograte our President. Shame on you.
Biden Discourse is BACK and let‚Äôs try and give some meaningful takes.   Let‚Äôs discuss the need for Leftist infrastructure, class consciousness, and the lack of leftist political power in the US.    (Please retweet+like to support!)
Hmm .... Biden wants to mandate an executive order FORCING masks outside for every American for at least 3 months.  You might want to look up the definitions of AUTOCRACY and DEMOCRACY again, to re-educate yourself.
While Trump casts his own ballot by mail, the post office has increasingly been in his cross-hairs as Democrats advocate voting by mail.
I get why people are going to vote Biden/Harris. I really do. I'm not, but I understand why others will. But please, please don't hold them up as wonderful people deserving of support. Be honest about it. You're reaching for a leaking lifeboat as the Titanic is going down.
The last time a VP was this critical to a campaign was 1944 when Truman ran along side a very ill FDR. Biden isn‚Äôt nearly as frail as FDR was but he‚Äôd be the oldest elected first term president. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how the anti-police crowd receives Biden &amp; Harris.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll sort mail in order to vote for Joe Biden‚Äù is the new ‚ÄúI‚Äôll crawl over broken glass to vote for Joe Biden.‚Äù
They've been promised more of our tax payer money all they need and more once Biden/Harris are in the White House.  We the people are what everyone needs to fund everything.    If you are wondering why all of the in debt fed funded agencies aren't worried, we are their cash cows.
He is definitely enabling them no doubt. But if Biden was president those same GOP mayor's and governors would be do the same actions if for no other reason than to defy Biden
No Ignoramus, you're confused with HUNTER BIDEN who screwed his dead brother's widow, while his Dad was busy looking for little girls' chests to grope.
There was no historical precedent literally whatsoever for how fast of a turnaround it was. No campaign ever had such a quick and remarkable comeback as Biden‚Äôs. History was against him, so his campaign wrote a new chapter in history for electoral politics.

The Kamala Harris Effect: Biden Campaign Fundraising Sets New Record Since VP Pick
Trump/Biden = two cheeks from the same arse!
That's OK, I'm sure Biden will commute the sentence just like Trump did for Stone, so whoopee dippee.
the most reality show headline I've ever seen and then they wonder why ppl think elections are a joke
There were no penalties to any states for their response. There is no garuntee that if Biden or anyone else was president there would have been less deaths than 16700. It's a pandemic. And most of the reason our response was so terrible here is because Americans don't listen
My concern is that Biden Harris will do centrist things and they'll get labeled as progressive. Anything further left will be radical. If we're honest that they are both mainly centrist, then we can actually pressure them from the progressive left (not the unhinged radical left).
BBC News - US 2020: Biden campaign says Trump 'abhorrent' for fuelling Harris conspiracy  Trump is quick to label people as 'immigrants' No mention of his plastic wife though. He's the ultimate hypocrite. Melania? Sounds like a skin disease.
Biden's debate performance will be disastrous without at least some practice taking unscripted questions.

puzzle black support of Biden. The VP sidelined for 8 years, basement Joe. Blacks associate him with Obama!  They never liked Kamala or Cory.
Everyone really talking shit about how Biden wouldnt make a good president either but what fucking choice do we have? Kanye? I think the fuck not
Joe the wind bag Biden. You just hide your lies better. Be careful USA.
Wait until you debate Biden. He has had 38 yrs experience in our government. You won‚Äôt have any honest, reasonable comments to make at the debate worthwhile. You‚Äôll lie about the numbers. You‚Äôll lie about your accomplishments. At least you can‚Äôt sexually troll Hillary on stage.

Well they look segregated, probably how Biden wanted it.üôÑ
Biden has always been a stutterer. I am too. Sometimes, the words just get stuck. That doesn't take away from my inate ability to learn, and communicate. That is exactly how Biden is.
It is easier to imagine a general strike than a decent healthcare law from Biden administration in 2020 !
at least 3 anti Trump tweets just today.  Way to do your part for Biden.
who is currently making this defense? Seriously. not wanting to vote Biden is not the same as BoB.

those who are critical of folks not voting for biden love to tell us that we‚Äôre ‚Äúvoting for fascism‚Äù because of the possibility of a trump re-election. what they fail to realize is that the election of biden doesn‚Äôt remove a fascist from office, but just replaces one for another.
We should all want more; so I'll offer a few reasons to vote for Biden/Harris.  They have experience in governing (which is what we're hiring them to do).  Biden offers sensible leadership in the face of this national pandemic.  Are there refinements to be made?  Absolutely.
But that would be major. If a lot of black people vote for a 3rd party or stay home, Biden will lose. Then the next logical step would be for the DNC to say "what do we have to do to get black people to vote for us". That in itself is a win. Cuz now show up and get nothing
I would be open to listening to a fact-based policy comparison to tell me why Trump/Pence would be better than Biden/Harris... must be based on facts and policy... I would be willing to including character but I feel like that‚Äôs not necessary

Actually more jobs have been created during Trump‚Äôs three and one-half years than all of Obama/Biden‚Äôs eight years.
This made me lol, and cringe that the bar is literally that low. (Not a comment on Biden/Harris, but against trump)
Drill down even further.  Big voter turnout in Milwaukee, Detroit and Philly will wrap it for Biden.
I don‚Äôt see a single lie in your response. I‚Äôm not particularly happy about Biden, but I support him because the alternative is a no for me.
sell your soul to team Biden, otherwise is literally 1984.
Listen, yes, Biden could have chosen a better VP pick with a less problematic political past. However, that does not mean we need to be racist and sexist towards Harris just because we don‚Äôt agree with her career thus far. Don‚Äôt be gross.
What a ridiculous question.  It‚Äôs Trump or it‚Äôs America.  Vote for Biden!!
Biden-Harris is a hot ticket. Trump-Pence are old white misogynists &amp; LIARS. The GOP is complicit b/c it allowed Trump to rise to the top &amp; win. The other 2016 presidential GOP candidates are all cowards just like the GOP. Where was the GOP during the last 3.5 yrs?  Russian $!
That‚Äôs a cute analogy but we have no idea what Biden may do or not good or bad but we have proof of how horrible trump has been not only to our ppl but everyone but y‚Äôall do as y‚Äôall please no judgement I was already hip to you TJ just go convo for our folks that mayb following

the ‚Äòleft-wing‚Äô of the Democratic Party is in an even worse position to negotiate this time around compared to 2016, Biden is somehow to the right of Clinton even, and they tell immigration activists and environmental activists and BLM to ‚Äúgo vote for someone else‚Äù.
it‚Äôs funny as shit that people believe ‚Äúwe can push Biden &amp; Harris to the left and hold them accountable!!‚Äù when just about everything they‚Äôre doing at this point is just out of spite against the ‚Äòleft-wing‚Äô of the party lol

But, I have to vote for Trump because the Democrats pre-selected Biden and told the rest of the candidates to drop out, disregard voting, and skip the convention,  completely undemocratic.
wow, sounds like a competent politician then.  Do you know why Biden opposed bussing?
And to top it off out of all the women Biden was considering, Kamala was the top black woman in that list &amp; I‚Äôm thinking maybe all that extra demand made him lean more to her? Instead of others he was considering if there had been the same push for someone more progressive
WE are fighting for our lives, which is why WE are supporting Biden.  I can't wait to see the bitter outrage and despair you fake, when Trump loses, even if your acting is still as bad as ever.
This Republican is stating this:  Your goals are laudable, &amp; now is the time to fight. But sabotaging Biden's election is not the way to win. The Justice Dems are doing it by primary wins over establishment candidates. Give the centrists their President, you take the Congress.

Me either! This way, I know my vote was correct Biden &amp; Harris.
This is why Biden announced Harris on a Tuesday. His team knew there'd be at least 72 hours of Shitshow Funtime coming after their one news cycle. What do you think,
Things some can afford to be blind to and ignore are what some cannot escape, cannot afford to ignore no matter how painful the past...so stop saying get over it..is it really in the past.üò•
Who are you kidding. You lied to the American people. You called the COVID-19 a Democratic Hoax. You wasted valuable time in which you could have lessened the deaths &amp; misery of thousands of Americans. Biden-Harris ticket is strong. You &amp; Pence are weak &amp; selfish and Liars.
Biden Gets Endorsed By Communist Leader  via  Patriot News
Nope. Im guessin u think it was an accident when Biden did it? I was genuinely askin. But evidently u aint got no answer. It‚Äôs all good tho; i got no dog in the fight- I just think its funny u called him out when her running mate did the exact same thing. That is all. Carry on.
Dr. Biden will direct the decorations. In between teaching as a college professor.
Kanye is running against Trump as an independent. Is Jared going to have a "general discussion" about policy with Biden? If you have that discussion with one opponent, why not with all of them?
You said pence was intentional. So I very simply asked you if Biden‚Äôs was intentional. Ain‚Äôt no bad faith to it. You are assuming that. Why y‚Äôall get so bent outta shape when anybody asks literally anything that doesn‚Äôt directly fit or fall in line into this liberal narrative?
The optimism of a Biden/Harris administration will be rekindle the American entrepreneurial spirit and new businesses will be born. Optimism is best for markets, not the doom and gloom of Trump‚Äôs corrupt authoritarian regime.
It sounds as though Trump is admitting that he was mean and condescending towards Joe Biden. I wonder what prompted this rare instance of honesty? It was probably a slip of the tongue or the Twitter finger.
President Biden. Sounds better and better every day, especially now with Vice President, Kamala Harris. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Nicer words with Biden? Unlikely. You‚Äôll probably get... words. Not in any particular order.
so we just toss pot shots in our own given echo chambers? I don‚Äôt disagree that people ‚Äúdunking‚Äù on bernie and just unnecessarily shitting on Biden are problematic.  I‚Äôm just not sure the rhetoric here is convincing for anyone not already in agreement with Vaush.
They would swoon for whomever Biden chose. They're shameless partisans, in case you haven't noticed.
In 2017 Virginia set the tone for 2020, in 2018 the rest of the country followed. In 2020 Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have set the tone for the next 4 years. We are all ready to elect #BidenHarris
Serious question: Was it intentional when Biden just did it?
Biden didn‚Äôt even say it right announcing her ! ü§£
What dies that even mean? Lol who gives AF about his followers, Biden did the same shit! ü§£ üíÄ
Uhhh  ....you do know I that your boy Biden pronounced it the same exact way just the other day right? Lol cant make this stuff up.
I like how if you ask someone why they vote for Biden they can‚Äôt answer without saying ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù
Joe...Biden...Is... Catholic. Full Stop!!
I agree Miles, he is funny to watch on TV. But nobody wants him in charge of their freedom or bank accounts or jobs! Let alone Kamala who will be President within 6 months after Biden takes office. Thank God that will never happen! #TRUMP2020ToSaveAmerica
Of course. She‚Äôs a Marxist.  If you like Marxism then vote for Biden. What‚Äôs news here?
Look at the coverage of Belarus right now. Show everyone you know who isn't enthusiastic about Biden/Harris. This is what we are heading toward, at lightening speed. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
Weekend at Biden‚Äôs
ü§îü§îü§î Dr. Fauci(the medical expert) that the left thinks walks on water says you can vote in person(if you stay 6 feet apart) #election2020 #biden #trump #vote #vote2020 #voteinperson #nov3
Maybe the winning team of Biden-Harris didn‚Äôt want to show up Trump any further right now. Trump is a cheater. Trump is a liar. The GOP &amp;  Trump deserve to go down in history as the most corrupt &amp; traitorous administration in the last 100 years. Just like the Trump Virus. Shame!
I wish no ill will.  May she Rest In Peace.  Your political record is a disaster though and Biden is a 40yr career loser in politics.  Democrats always pander for votes and never have to answer questions on their voting record. Biden is a joke, made millions on tax payers
Do you agree üëç or disagree üëé?
'It's a risky bargain': Columnist says Joe Biden took a gamble by tapping Kamala Harris for VP | Conservative Institute
I don‚Äôt think Joe Biden needs help losing this election. He‚Äôs doing a great job of that on his own
Sure, it‚Äôs easy to say it doesn‚Äôt keep Biden from being elected. But it maintains the degradation of our norms and corrupts our media, making it easier for the next ‚ÄúTrump Republican‚Äù to wage similar attacks on future candidacies not as strong as Biden/Harris
Flaws can be as minor as a big ego. That's all I was saying. I recognize he's not a perfect person. He's still a person I can vote for &amp; sleep at night. Unlike a racist, bigoted, lying, sick perv like Biden. And now you can add senile to that list.
These are the return of the jobs created under Obama-Biden and lost under Trump-Pence due to these failure to protect us from the #TrumpVirus
Heard a Trump supporter say that if Biden wins in November that he will move to Canada, and that is the energy we all need during this time
For the sake of Asian representation and he endorsed Biden.
They‚Äôve moved from thinking Obama or Hillary is the President to blame things on, and on to Joe Biden. I‚Äôm pretty sure Trump is the President you dumbasses.
Much of your list of opinions, unproven accusations, and made up stories. Plz. The most for Joe Biden and Kamala would go on for days and days.  I'm trying to be civil and you're just throwing out lists made up by fear mongers and spreaders on the left. Nice "research" job.
I have a bet going that Biden dies before the election and she becomes the nominee
Biden won‚Äôt even remember what happened üòÇ üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
That's been proven to be one of Trump's lies. Try to keep up. Trump was the one trying to bribe the Ukraine into lying about Biden's involvement. That's a F A C T.
if Hillary Clinton couldn‚Äôt beat Trump (not that she was a perfect candidate, but she pretty much only lost because of ‚ÄútHe eMaiLS‚Äù and the fucked up electoral college) y‚Äôall really expect Joe Biden to be able to beat him???
JOE BIDEN ain‚Äôt going NOWHERE with MY MEAT!!!!!!!!  You have to put an END to this!!!
"We're not going to let Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris cut America's meat!"    --VP Mike Pence  #heisdumb #meatgate2020 #BidenHarris2020
Your scare tactics are not going to work.  Joe Biden has said no such thing.  He does want to get the virus under control, get all Americans tested, which will be the way we can move forward without massive loss of life. Vote and Donate
Once again we got trash choices for presidents ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è honestly tho bruh trump might be the slightly better choice.

Biden will enforce wearing masks OUTSIDE.   #Wisconsin  #Iowa #Ohio #Minnesota
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
He's already calling for mandates. Imagine when he's not asking for your vote. #Election2020   Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
Fuck Kamala, fuck Biden and WAP is big mid
Biden‚Äôs REAL agenda.
maybe I'm a weirdo but I love telling people why I won't vote for Joe Biden‚Ä¶ hone your pitches people
They‚Äôll probably give the Nobel Peace Prize to Biden.
LoL at Democrats claiming reparations for Trumps economy.  These losers will do whatever it takes.  Obama was a catastrophe, along with sleepy Joe.  Biden is 10times worse, he is a career politician of utter failure
Biden must be in really bad shape.  It's a Democrat disaster.
Bloomberg could, too. Remember when he pledged to put everything behind Joe Biden?  Now is the time.
What's absolutely killing me is seeing folks on this hellscape - Biden voters, advocating for actual incremental change...unironically, at that.  This year needs to be launched into the sun alongside the shitlibs.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
Who yal voting for ? Yal all seem to hate Biden &amp; Kamala so much .
In his defense, Biden probably has no idea what Trump actually said.
So Biden and Kamala Harris‚Äô big announcement and contribution is to peddle a face mask mandate, while our President just did a little thing like brokering a deal for actual Peace in the Middle East,  I  CAN‚ÄôT!! üòÇ God Bless our President!üôèüèª
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  #daretospeak
How ironic.  Biden announces he would force every American to wear a mask outside, yet it's Trump who is called a fascist, a dictator, a Nazi and even Hitler.
But loved Biden when he was with Obama .. lol
Not a single person who will vote for Biden/Harris and you out of office gives one sh*t what you think
I‚Äôm starting to think Cornyn is campaigning for Biden/Harris.
Biden will send his federal storm troopers out to enforce masks
So my coworker started on his Kamala Harris rant and how it‚Äôs ‚Äúkinda racist‚Äù that Joe Biden committed to picking a female woman of color (he only committed to choosing a woman). Then my boss says (FINALLY), well I‚Äôm on an ‚Äúanybody but Trump‚Äù train myself. Conversation ended.
Good. Glad she was the ring leader. She‚Äôs smart. She‚Äôs brave, she‚Äôll tell Biden when he‚Äôs missed the mark or wrong. Pence is a Trump sycophant who follows whatever the traitor tells him too. Pence is a Christian and he obeys Trump. WWJD?  ETTD. Pence = hypocrite &amp; Trump = liar.
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. ‚ÄúHey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúReady to work! Let‚Äôs go (Dr. Jill Biden)!‚Äù he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
Uhhh.... maybe if you want to project how much better you're doing than Biden you should share a video with CG from this century. That looks like someone made it in high school in 1997.
I'll take Biden any day over that idiot you support. We'll see about this peace deal. It's another phony ploy to make him look like a decent human being. Won't work

And the DNC succumbed to Yang only after a deluge of Yang Gang activism. They gave him the opening slot on night 1.   The deep corruption and dishonesty in the DNC represents the entire party. Biden and Harris are entrenched and complicit. Don't kid yourselves.
Flip the vote.     This could become a daily thing.   It looks like these morons are going to keep posting these polls until they can get Biden a win.
Oh FFS ... stop pretending Biden actually wrote this.
And I know you don't need someone ELSE telling you to vote, but  brought up a good point that Trump's less likely to fight election results if Biden is an OVERWHELMING winner off-the-bat. So please, vote for Biden, and get your absentee ballot in as early as you can.
Spelling Correction:  it's Tara Reade.  "Harris, who had by that point dropped out of the presidential race, said that Reade ‚Äúhas a right to tell her story.‚Äù
Trustworthy?  The most corrupt lawless traitorous lying president in the history of America?  Surly you can't mean that. Biden is 1000 times more trustworthy than Trump could ever hope to be even if he tried, which he doesn't.
You keep using the word ‚Äúaccusers.‚Äù  Where did Kamala use that word when talking about the women who said Biden‚Äôs lack of awareness of their personal space made them uncomfortable?
My concern is Trump is willing to do anything to retain control, just like Putin. I hope that Biden and Kamala both have heavily armed security. I don‚Äôt know if i even trust secret service at this point.
Imma get Biden‚Äôs face on one boob and Kamala Harris on the other one. Who‚Äôs with me?
If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to tell it that it still has to vote for Biden,
Yes, I am too! Nasty woman 100% behind Biden/Harris2020
And the DNC succumbed to Yang only after a deluge of Yang Gang activism. They gave him the opening slot on night one.   The deep corruption and dishonesty in the DNC represents the entire party. Biden and Harris are entrenched and complicit. Don't kid yourselves.
And I‚Äôm still voting Biden because it‚Äôs more important to get trump out of office.   But in 4/8 years the democratic national party HAS to do better and HAS to start listening to us.

Please don‚Äôt let these people try to deter you from voting for Biden with these think pieces. Do JB and KH have some questionable pasts? Yes but anything is better than 45. Our country can‚Äôt afford another 4 years of him. Get out and VOTE!
The world is already laughing at you so as you said, ‚ÄúWhat do we have to lose?‚Äù With Biden.
I find the best way to engage is to assume that even if the person is coming at Biden from the left that they will still vote for him. Some leftist people might be passionate about Bernie or disliking biden but a lot of us see the writing on the wall and Will do what's necessary
Facebook is literally all politics now. I‚Äôm over it. No one cares why you support Trump. No one cares why you support Biden. They are both shitty human beings. I‚Äôll just keep to myself and continue living this life, day by day.

A Biden/Harris ticket? America is yawning.
She‚Äôs way smarter than Trump, Pence, or Biden. I think it‚Äôs broken brain stuff to go on this racist/sexist argument
There is nobody meaner or more condescending than you. You set the standard for that. Zero in the polls?  In your dreams. Biden and Harris are going to crush you and Pence in November. Can't wait.
I watched that end to end last night. Joe Biden's next words after your video cuts out is correcting himself and saying her name correctly. There is plenty to be critical of Uncle Joe without resorting to dishonesty.
...I think all the people who think that Biden has lost it and not Trump never really listen to either of them in full.  They just form their impressions from select, edited playbacks on Conservative media
#guncontrol as a policy is deeply racist . If you think different you might want to research your history  and stop listening to the people making money off of mass incarceration *coughmala harris*   *coke biden* my bad these allergies . All this crap in the air .Woo #2A
Voting for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and saying you're with the #BLM movement (not the organization) is highly oxymoronic . They both are part of the reason you have to say #BlackLivesMatter and keep having to say it .
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
Relief and hope. Biden relief - Harris - hope.
I'm not a Trump supporter so you can spare me the religious guilt trip. funny tho that a Biden supporter could preach on morals.  A pedo/woman assaulter who picked his running mate whos done her part to imprison more African Americans then the Amistad. But you'll answer as well.
How is Trump responsible for every Covid death in the country? Did Trump make people go out to the Miami beaches? Does Trump make people not wear a mask? And i guess if Biden was President, everybody would've put a mask on and nobody would have died? smfh
It's not a threat.... Joe biden has some form of dementia or a relative illness and that will be on display in the debates
I‚Äôve seen a lot of that too. Whiny, sore losers. Even Bernie is on board but his ‚Äúpeople‚Äù can‚Äôt let it go. Screw them.  Up turnout in Philly, Detroit and Milwaukee and Biden wins without them.

Yeah, you‚Äôre definitely not talking about Biden. You have explicit anti-leftist bias regularly. As someone who left conservative evangelicalism to become a polyamorous bisexual I find it bizarre to watch liberals police consensual sex. Alex Morse is no different from Katie Hill.
tRumpsters grasping at straws. Lol Biden/Harris 2020
I'm going to vote for biden while shitting on him the entire time
Biden/Harris 2020! I will be there in person as well!
seems okay electorally for Biden and Trump and those allegations weren‚Äôt even consensual, or part of a proven, actual plot with email proof to take someone down
What idiot thought a tweet from Biden - which included the words LITTLE GIRLS - was a good idea?
You big mad or little mad? Lol Biden/Harris2020!!!
Despite a global pandemic, the party has made zero moves to provide meaningful help, and Biden has been openly dismissive and disdainful of the idea of giving poor people healthcare
Does anybody actually believe that Biden can be "pushed" left at this point? We're in the middle of the longest period of sustained civil unrest since the 1960's, and his biggest challenger in his party primary was a democratic socialist, and what did he and the party do?

Rasmussen +12? Is this a farce to get people to think Trump has no chance so Biden voters will end up staying home
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt paint his face with an airbrush.   I like Presients like that.
It‚Äôs really nasty to prop up this charade on USA that a man with dementia should run the free world. Joe Biden isn‚Äôt fit to serve.
You seem to make the argument that a Trump white house would keep more people upset and aware enough of the mechanics of systemic oppression to keep people engaged.  That a Biden white house would partly lull our neighbors into a false sense of security. Is that an accurate read?
At least he acknowledges it, and will likely surround himself with people who understand it better than he does. Someone like AOC will have some influence on a Biden administration. Trump will continue to turn back the clock on what little progress we've made.
If you honestly believe that you have every right to vote for whomever you want. I told myself the same thing in 2004 and 2008. If they truly are the same then you should have no problem with me saying that your decision is more likely to help Trump than Biden.
This video really makes it seem like Joe Biden is the hardworking underdog? Is that the message?
Trump‚Äôs press conference, following  the outstanding speeches from Biden and Harris, was like a sad, wet blanket. The delivery of the stuff on his cue cards was pathetic.
Not only  needs secret service to pay her a visit for those evil comments with malice intent. It's a signal for potential harm coming Biden's way soon. There's no bottom with these REAL human scums on FOX.
I don't see "walk through broken glass barefoot to vote for Biden" anywhere on that card, sir.
How to tell a young family member who your really close to that Biden is not a fucking option and he won't be much better than Trump really
You explicitly stated voting for Biden was "somehow worse," so...
I said explicitly for a reason. Regardless, what's your alternative? Vote for Trump? Don't vote? You have to work with the tools you're given. If voting for Biden saves one more life, then yeah it's a better option. We should push for better, but doing nothing isn't better.
Biden is almost certainly gonna be nothing more than a mouthpiece for the Democrats given his mental health. Dems are still oligarchic capitalists, but at least they don't explicitly hate people and seek to remove them.
And yet there he is, the Democrats candidate for President of the United States. And the floozy he picked as a running mate, whose strongest qualification is her ability to sleep her way to the top? Pandering, thy name is Biden... Pathetic.
6ix9ine hurt himself? Boosie IG got deleted? I got banned from IG for 1 week? Biden got a black VP? What‚Äôs next?

I totally get where you're coming from, but as fucked up as it is, I'd rather perpetuate a broken system then break it further. It's very likely Biden will kill less people than Trump. He'll still kill people, just not as many. Ugh. Fuck liberals.

you are a full blown prick you just dont want Biden to debate Trump because you know it will show the world he is a fraud and has not accomplished anything in 43 years in office
I know we gotta vote for biden and kamalaüôÑ, but I‚Äôm not about to hype them up like I like them.
I acknowledge what you are saying. Unless they find some dead bodies buried in her back yard, I am voting for Biden. And it still depends on how many dead bodies?
That only makes sense if republicans base is willing to vote only for republicans, essentially making the voting base puppets. If don‚Äôt agree with Biden polices but are voting out of the fear trump, then the party is taking u for granted and u are making yourself a puppet
That's right.   Seeing progressives like Cori Bush unseat incumbents gives me hope too. The squad is growing, progressives are gaining ground. Supporting the Biden/Harris ticket and down ballot progressives is what we can do to get closer to progressive policies.
As I‚Äôve said before, Kanye takes more votes away from potential Trump-leaning voters than Biden voters, the data we‚Äôve seen shows it. The Republicans trying to get him on the ballot to help Trump are shooting themselves in the foot.
I just don‚Äôt want to settle on someone who deserve to be in office. If the argument is if I don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden, that‚Äôs a vote for trump. Then if I don‚Äôt vote for Trump, that‚Äôs vote for Biden.
TBH I do worry about Biden's debate performance. I didn't find him very inspiring in the primary debates. Of course, his best one was the one on one debate with Bernie. Hopefully that Joe Biden will show up for the trump debates.
It‚Äôs the excuse people give me for voting for biden. I know trump is terrible human being but give me something other than ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù so I can be motivated to vote him. I want positive change not just a sit in president. I really hope that our generation doesn‚Äôt settle
Honest question, if Biden tweeted a good meme tomorrow do you think it would be received well? I honestly don‚Äôt think it could work at this point.
The anger needs to be directed at the people managing his digital media. Not Biden personally, that‚Äôs just my opinion. I have Alzheimer‚Äôs and demented folks in my family. It‚Äôs not fair and I take personal offense to this tweet

How is it the lesser of two evils when Biden is responsible for the '94 crime bill, and Harris is locking people up, kept innocent ppl locked up, and is 'proud of her record?" Historically, we've always been voting for the 'lesser' of 2 evils
She fits perfectly with Biden who has previously been endorsed by Strom Thurmond.   We are stuck with people who "accidentally" support bigots but swear they've learned better. Why did they need to learn better in their 40s or 60s? Probably best not to ask that.
Alright! Just know that your apparent policies don‚Äôt line up with the words you‚Äôre saying. But have a good day! Vote Biden/Harris 2020! üòÇ
To be fair, anyone with two eyes and a grasp on reality has predicted this. If Biden is aware that it is happening, he thinks he is doing the nation a great service. And if he isn‚Äôt, the DNC assumes the voters will go for a regency presidency because Reagan was a long time ago.
I also never said that you ‚Äúlove Biden‚Äù lmao. I understand your point. Just stop beating people up for understandably being hesistant or upset about having to vote for Biden.
I aint mad at Kamala im just trying to figure out how we got stuck with Trump or Biden. Tf is going on.
If she wasn't chosen for VP, she's not going anywhere.   Biden is a centrist, not a lefty.   Anyone who can support employer based healthcare in the midst of historic job losses during a pandemic is not someone who is looking for actual change.
What merits does he have that give him this savior status other than him being given the DNC nomination? Please fucking tell me what makes Joe Biden, himself, such a viable candidate?
With Joe Biden selecting Kamala Harris, the senator from California becomes the third woman selected as the vice president on a major party ticket.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
Lmao bc we aren‚Äôt. People will claim that we have the representation we‚Äôve been asking for. People will say ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre progressive!‚Äù when they‚Äôre far more centrist than that. It‚Äôs a delusion to believe that we‚Äôre ‚Äúbetter off‚Äù just because of Joe fucking Biden.
My point is that you can‚Äôt claim ‚Äúharm reduction‚Äù or that this saves people, when it very realistically will still be harming and killing a lot of people. Biden is still harmful. His rhetoric is still harmful. Harris is harmful. They can be necessary and still extremely harmful.
I don‚Äôt have a chance of survival if Trump wins. I know that. But people are being willfully dense to the issues that present themselves with someone like Biden. You can acknowledge that he‚Äôs necessary and also heavily criticize him because he‚Äôs a horrible person?
We know. Trump is the devil. But you‚Äôre gonna keep getting shitty and shallow policy from people like Biden if you don‚Äôt aggressively question their positions. Those positions that cause the systemic issues that we‚Äôre trying to fix.
And I personally would not choose Biden or Harris, having my way. And I get the tension from folks wanting to celebrate the representational, symbolic bone on the one hand and those wanting to point out how this is also another fail if this is the best electoral politics has...
But also note that it‚Äôs extremely privileged of you to say that ‚Äúone side hates us more than the other!‚Äù when I‚Äôm a person, like many others, who exist within the intersectionality of these two parties hatred. Biden does not give one fuck about a Black trans person like me.
and not joe biden  huh, not inspiring confidence?

It actually is political, Zaed. Trump wants football and Biden doesn‚Äôt. Liberals hate sports. Don‚Äôt get it twisted.
If he was a genius he'd have run on the same populist messaging that he ran on in 2016. It's like both sides are completely jaded about how hilariously unfit both incumbents and candidates are.   Biden's trash and so is Trump.
FUCK THE POLICE. All the bitches out there that care more about broken windows than human lives, safety, and housing need to sit the fuck down and learn about past civil unrest. We CANNOT stop fighting once Biden gets elected
My guess is that Biden's doing too well in Montana for a Democrat. Not well enough to win, but definitely well enough to pull the Senate candidate past the finish line. Getting Kanye on the ballot might pull enough votes away from the D ticket to keep Bullock out of the Senate.
I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre the mayor of Richmond. You sided with the chaos and now you‚Äôre talking about locking them up. Now you‚Äôre calling Biden smart for picking Harris? Lol this is too easy for Trump...
How can *anyone* support Joe Biden?
Idek no more man biden and harris in the same office is gon be reagan on steroids
Because they‚Äôre blinded by Trump Derangement Syndrome. Biden‚Äôs just the Trojan horse to get her into the White House.
The black vote is currently being split because some of us won‚Äôt vote because we don‚Äôt want Biden. Some of us will vote for Kanye (unfortunately) and some doesn‚Äôt what Kamala Harris because of her reputation at the AG of California.
Harris has long sought changes to federal laws that disproportionately put black people in jail... and she has helped push Biden into supporting reforms.

‚Äú Wall Street Backs Biden Pick As Dem VP.‚Äù WTF!  votes with  most of the time.
I‚Äôm thinking her name recognition helped and Biden really wants someone to be friends with
Honest question for everyone bummed about Biden picking Harris: who did you think he was gonna pick? Not who you want but who thought he would pick?
So it would go to pelosi when Biden steps down.
Also I‚Äôm very tired of libs comparing trump to an abusive ex boyfriend and not calling him what he is a fascist war criminal, but I suppose then that makes him too similar to Biden.
I understand that the Philadelphia DA chose not to persecute marijuana convictions and released people in jail with those crimes but sure absolve Harris from blame there. Idk, at least she doesn‚Äôt have a rape allegation against her unlike Biden.
I don‚Äôt like Joe Biden at all. I think his folksy ‚Äúcharm‚Äù‚Äôis disingenuous and I hate how he was friends with segregationists (who should have been shunned). However, I will be voting for him because the alternative is the destruction of our country with  Trump‚Äôs re-election.
#Biden That look on your face when you realize you've been talking to Microsoft Cortana for a hour when you thought it was Kamala Harris
2. Since when did we care this much about the vice president? No one gave joe biden the time of day until obama brought him on.
Biden will do much better than Trump in a debate. The knowledge he possess will enhance his ability to answer questions off the cuff if need be. Trump is messy. He‚Äôll lie, he‚Äôll get angry, he‚Äôll get more racist, etc. Trump will blow his debate and Harris will kick Pence‚Äôs butt.
Go Biden/Harris. I swear, all these great videos are bringing me to tears!
Ok, trump and Biden are the same. That‚Äôs officially where I get off. So now guess what I get to call you? Fascist. For not voting out the fascist. Hopefully you open your eyes to the hard truth before November
Biden-Harris ticket is like the Battle of Saratoga. Democracy is not finished in America. The people will speak on Nov 3. I‚Äôm so excited. I can‚Äôt wait to hear who your cabinet will be. This is your time Joe. I‚Äôm so proud of the man you have become. You aged well with the times!
No I‚Äôm not reading the 20 articles you‚Äôve sent me right now cuz we‚Äôre getting off topic. Biden: bad. Trump: worse. That‚Äôs it.
Voting for Biden will help. It will get rid of the fascist. You keep trying to complicate this, but it‚Äôs very very simple.
The prison system is horrible and should be abolished. Are we more likely to move the needle under trump or Biden? Get real. Seriously
This lifelong Republican is very excited to be voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on November 3rd!
I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Vote for Biden and not the fascist. Then we can tackle these other issues.
It is amazing how one name changes the perception of the US abroad. Currently, the US is commonly viewed as a crazy, dumb, unreliable, and self-isolating fat idiot. With her nomination every civilized country is giddy to welcome the US back to civilization
My guy I understand you are super liberal and I understand your stance but nobody is voting for her. They are voting for Biden or voting because they do not like trump. VP picks rarely help nor hurt a presidential candidate
You‚Äôre being as divisive as you‚Äôre claiming others are. People have legitimate questions and concerns and to write everything off as ‚Äúhave fun with trump then,‚Äù is silencing to the very real concerns. Also most people are still voting for Biden, so you‚Äôre just being a turd lmao.

If it makes you feel better I think the VP position has about as much power and importance as one of my farts and I hate Biden more.
2. So what if he has a script? I often write out notes before getting on WAY less important calls. Also: Biden has been open about stuttering. This is a a guess, but perhaps having notes or a script helps him with that.
A few things about that photo of Biden holding the photo ‚Äúupside down.‚Äù  1. He was likely pointing the mic at the laptop so someone on the line could hear his conversation with Harris.

Look at Barack &amp; Joe already working to attack COVID-19 this is why I‚Äôm voting for a BIDEN/HARRIS ticket, working for the people!!
You‚Äôve misread his tweet. And mine. Read more carefully. He says nothing of property values, nor did I say that everything is racist or say you were. He used the term ‚Äúinvade.‚Äù He imagined Corey booker as Biden‚Äôs hud sec. to hammer point.  You seem desperate to believe otherwise.

I don‚Äôt expect anyone else to do anything they don‚Äôt want to do, therefore I won‚Äôt be behaving how anyone else wants me to either. Biden/Harris is a crap ticket, but one I will vote for anyway. Yippee
Not talking about that at all, I‚Äôm talking about you saying you love her because she went after someone accused of sexual assault. She said she believed Blasey Ford and she said she believed Biden‚Äôs accuser, but yet she only goes after one person. Hypocrisy and you only liking it
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
When she said she believed Blasey Ford, which was the basis of your tweet and why she went after Kavanaugh. But now it‚Äôs not an issue that she said she believed Biden‚Äôs accuser until she walked it back so she can try for the WH. Your hypocrisy is showing.
Is that so? You think my life is a ‚Äúcliche?‚Äù I‚Äôll be voting for Biden/Harris. I cannot wait to see the back of you for the last  time! Even my 85 yr, Republican, mother is voting Biden/Harris.
Now do Biden!
Thank goodness that President Trump reversed hundreds of Obama era regulations that hampered small businesses and instituted major TAX CUTS.  Biden has promised to RAISE taxes.
Joe Biden would‚Äôve had an automatic win if he ran for president in 2016. How different things would‚Äôve been
Remember that the VP really has no power except to break Congressional ties and Harris has historically voted with progressives (like Bernie Sanders 93% of the time). She‚Äôs not perfect, but a third party vote is a vote for Trump, so support Biden/Harris.
#Biden just committed suicide with he picked #Harris as his VP. She was not good enough to be president, why pick her as nice president. Smh.
With her new face will Biden even recognize her?  Hell ... will America?  We find out this afternoon.

I would think that even Joe Biden couldn't be crazy enough to let Hillary get her foot back in the door.
That could be cultural because a Black man and a woman (HRC) that don‚Äôt bow down to white men. Whereas Biden had been in the Senate for 30+ years and was a white dude.  I‚Äôm not sure why they think this is a bombshell.
I‚Äôd love to talk to the people in charge of Biden‚Äôs Twitter...or the guy who controls his eyes.
Biden announced MONTHS ago his pick would be a woman of color. Because the Dems pander for the minority vote. She was not picked for her qualifications, experience, or accomplishments. She was chosen because of gender and color. btw, look up the definition of racism and misogyny.
Aw, shucks, folks. The Democrats could have Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd as featured speakers at their convention. I won't be watching anyway. My vote for Biden is already secured as the current best means of ridding ourselves of Donald Trump and his criminal regime
Whether Biden wins or not (and I hope he doesn't), somebody needs to put an end to the Clintons being near the White House.

Trump knows a depression's coming‚Äîhe caused it. He just doesn't know when we'll feel it. But, he's covered..  If he loses in Nov, he'll say Biden's policies caused the depression.  If he wins (God forbid), he'll say fear of Biden winning crashed the Markets, causing a depression.

Biden is not a Doctor. He's also not currently working in our Government. He should go take a nap.
Where does it say the #Trump campaign put this out?  This is just the media playing offense for the Biden campaign.  You ask a question and a campaign person responds.  Why ask stupid questions????  #FakeNews
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
You're pardoned.  My opinion is that I don't reward the Democratic party because they were good enough to cheat in a primary.  Biden has done zero to earn my vote.  Trump could never get my vote.  Biden but has to ask...
Your party is going up in flames because your only enthused voters want to defund cops, so you pick the two people most responsible for jailing black men.  You're going to be a breeze to beat.  Clearly, no good candidates wanted to run with Biden because your party went nuts.
This is going to be easy to beat:
Biden can't fight the swamp, he represents it.  This is the woman who said she believed his victims, nice pick:
I am all about Biden-Harris 2020üåäüåäüåäüåäüåäüåäüåä
EXACTLY! Biden probably referred to the Governors three times in his speech regarding the mask issue. trump is a LIAR!
And biden will do any better?
Good luck Iowans in getting help with the Dems. don't hold your breath I don't see why Biden hasn't said a word about virus help from his fellow Dems.
People who have been bothered by whataboutism the last several years are suddenly super comfortable employing it when valid criticism of Biden comes up...
Not happening. We will not comply f comotose Joe Biden
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
Maybe it makes a lot of sense.  It might (just a guess) "help" some of the more rational republicans help to vote for Biden
She should probably be kept away from biden
Jill Biden looks like she would be so much fun to hang out with...
You mean Biden, the guy who called Harris President and said it was 2021...and told black people they ain‚Äôt black if they don‚Äôt vote for him... and said Latinos were more diverse than blacks... should I go on???
Unless you got a candidate in all 50 you don't have a shot. Im no fan of biden by a stretch but if it beats trump...

Someone tell Biden that every single Covid model has been WRONG so far. A national mask mandate? Leave it up to the governors. As for wearing mask outdoors, many of us will not comply. It‚Äôs nuts. #maskholes
Nice try! Harris is a disaster and will cost #Biden the rust belt.  Remember Sarah Palin? Yeah we kind of have that dynamic going on here.
It just shows that Biden is working harder than you trump
Telling us we do have to vote for Biden in a safe blue state just feels like ‚Äúget in line because we say so‚Äù, and that‚Äôs not how you get none voters to vote. If you want votes, you have to earn them, by pushing what people want, not just shouting against what they don‚Äôt want
But for the love of god, don‚Äôt tell people who don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden because of his very real political flaws that they MUST vote for him in a state he‚Äôs going to win anyway, NYs electoral votes aren‚Äôt on the line here, everyone knows this. We don‚Äôt have to vote for him
Patronizingly telling ‚ÄúBernie Bros‚Äù they need to vote for Biden isn‚Äôt going to get you that surge, it‚Äôs just turning those people off to voting at all. Tell them about the down ballot races with candidates they can get excited about.

Another reason I closed FB, suppression of free speech. FB has become a Socialist platform. God help us if Kamala becomes prez because if elected, DNC will invoke 25th Amendment before Biden's first 100 days. Kamala is probably giddy.

You are so full of shit about President Trump. He cares more about Americans than you or Biden. You are a hypocrite by locking up people who smoke weed, yet use it yourself. America is not fooled by you. Then you called Biden a racist, yet you accept his VP pick.

Dr. Biden, absolutely!!  The Biden and Harris team is  Win-Win team!
1point I'm unclear on is, IF Biden is elected and heaven forbid something happen where he can't fulfill his duties, is she qualified to step up and be president? If not, it would fall to Speaker of the House (Pelosi). IF that's the case, shouldn't he have chosen some1 who could
Seriously tho. Some can't vote for the lesser of two evils. Most don't even know the policies these people have or their history, yet they're expected to vote?  I mean, im voting but I understand why other niggas won't vote. What Biden gonna do for the hood? PUT MORE BLACKS AWAY?
So, a media pundit said if Biden wins, Kamala should help eradicate the Trump appointees like Saddam Hussein did with the Ba‚Äôath party in Iraq?  Yet, they complained about Trump removing prosecutorial hacks like Preet Bhara?  Trump should‚Äôve cleaned house

You could have made that argument for any previous presidential race. So why didn't you? Everyone knows the real answer and the real reason why you don't want Biden debating Trump.
Every time you talk about skipping presidential debates your lame excuses don't hold water. You simply realize that Biden is mentally incapable of debating not only Trump but just about anybody. Truly sad.

Don‚Äôt judge another person‚Äôs religious beliefs! Biden-Harris promote infanticide,anti religious legislation,same sex marriage, anti Israel, socialist agenda and open borders !
It's hilarious listening to all the things that Joe Biden says he will do as president when he did nothing worthwhile in 8 years as vice president, nor for the many other years that he's been in public service ( = living off the taxpayers).
Strong words from Harris: "He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden; And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."

You are correct, Biden isn‚Äôt an ally.  That‚Äôs really not my point.  I think the economic harm that Trump has created will exacerbate existing problems inside communities of color.  It‚Äôs like smoking, every minute trump is in office shifts the 2053 problem closer to 2020.

I'm surprised Susan Rice wasn't chosen.   We got it in the bag!!! Trump 2020!!! Kamala Harris was chosen was Biden's VP!!!
That‚Äôs the best reason to elect Biden. Besides the fact that he‚Äôs not morally bankrupt like Trump is.
If you were in the "Reagan has Alzheimer's" camp or  If you were in the "Bush wasn't smart enough" camp,  You can't be in the "Biden is perfectly fit" camp.

Remember this America: Biden and Harris have NOTHING TO LOSE and EVERYTHING TO GAIN - SO - they will promise ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO VOTERS in the runup to November 3rd. America is in real danger because of The Democrat Party aided and abetted by the media.
Look for Biden and Harris to announce the following soon: If elected, on Day 1 of our administration, marijuana will be legalized nationwide, all college student loan debt will be forgiven, and we will give amnesty to all immigrants in America along with Medicare for all...
Your Wednesday funny. Including this: "Climb upon Geraldine Ferraro's and my shoulders, and from the most amazing view in your life consider lessons we learned."   Bahahahahaha. I picture Team Biden/Harris getting a good chuckle out of this one.
She does have the full support of the marijuana lobby and there is every certainty that if Biden and her are elected, marijuana will be legalized nationwide. Look for Biden and her to also promise college loan debt amnesty and immigration amnesty nationwide on Day 1.

When Biden announced that his veep would have ovaries we knew he was fishing in a very small pond. So he hooked, Harris.  Quite a catch.

It‚Äôs a tough call. The carnival barker is barely coherent at this stage, so there‚Äôs that spectacle to highlight. Biden should say he‚Äôll only debate if the sociopath releases his tax returns.
We were told that in 2016 with HRC, and it's unspoken this year, with the  platform that disregards any of the things that progressives considered important. Biden hasn't budged on his stance on healthcare or policing. Biden bros are in everybody's posts saying it.

I guarantee, if Biden wins (and that's a big if) Bernie will be the first to call him out on every horrible stance and policy. But for 3+ years they vilified progressives bc they hated him for daring to oppose "Her," and it cost progressive candidates. So he's playing along.

My Yahweh Bless President Biden and Vic President  Harris.
Bummed she wasn‚Äôt your pick. I was in for Bernie also. We still vote for Biden right?
Focusing on the forest, would be flipping the Senate. But putting Biden up against Trump - 2 dementia patients with sexual assault allegations who don't give a damn about PoC - and making his running mate one of the worst AGs CA ever had, that's just fueling the forest fire.
Biden was not my 1st choice for president &amp; Kamala not my 1st for VP. That said they‚Äôll be exponentially better than the dangerous psychopath in office now. I‚Äôll be more than happy to vote for them deal with any shortcomings later.
To all of the wonderful women that Joe Biden could have picked black or white you all would have brought as much joy and comfort to our lives right now. You are all great women and true patriots. Thank you
Today‚Äôs announcement of Senator Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP was historic. So let‚Äôs get to work. Rid this country of those who would replace our natural diversity with homogeneity. Put a pandemic plan into place. Feed all children. Ensure that black lives matter. #DumpTrump2020
You have to remember, Joe Biden was nothing more than an olive branch to people who may have needed to be a little more palatable to vote for a black man for president. He was a conservative Democrat. I wouldn't go calling him a progressive hero out loud
Kamala Harris 'honored' to be Joe Biden's VP pick
Well if that's the case it would appear Biden has as many credible sexual assault allegations as Kavanaugh
How could Biden pick the Democrat with the worst record for CJR?
Let's go Biden/Harris! #BidenHarris2020 #SaveDemocracy
I'm rly off private twitter bc I do not know what to do abt this election. Can yall tell me who you're voting for and why? I don't wanna vote for Biden but like in a 2 party system do I have another option?? I can't just NOT voteüò© helpüò≠
Can't believe Joe Biden picked Maya Rudolph for VP!
Polls MAY say and show Biden is leading but remember there are hundreds or maybe thousands of people who sat out last time, those non voters WILL make the difference, spread the word towards anyone who is still considering not voting.
All women should be outraged at Trump‚Äôs response to Biden‚Äôs pick of a woman. Come to think about it, all men should be outraged at Trump‚Äôs response.
Donald Trump is terrible for America.  Joe Biden isn't much better. But when you're at the bottom (which America is, don't fucking kid yourself), you have to start the climb somewhere.

HISTORIC VP CHOICE: Joe Biden has picked Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate. She is the first woman of color ever on a major party's presidential ticket. Harris has represented California in the U.S. Senate since 2017, after serving as AG of California and DA of San Francisco
wow biden chose kamala harris yal are screwed
With Kamala Harris comes a lot of controversy, did Joe Biden make the correct decision? Pass it on.
Y‚Äôall can be mad, just vote for Biden. Thanks.
I just spent almost $100 on Biden-Harris merch

#Presidential hopeful  has announced his running mate ‚Äî Sen.  .
Joe Biden could've picked a pineapple with Mr. Potato head face pieces as his running mate, and I still would vote for him over Trump.  If that bothers you, fuck yourself.
What happens when biden gets covid and you know , then what
We gotta get him out. I‚Äôm not happy with the choices but Trump has to go. There needs to be someone who is less divisive and try to bring people together. They can say what they want about Biden, but don‚Äôt act like our current president doesn‚Äôt lie every day.
Warren was my VP Candidate. I wonder if she would actually choose to surrender her Senate seat to be just another member of Biden's cabinet. Time will tell.

Just caught "President" Trump's remarks and an advisor must've told him Biden-Harris would be a much tougher opponent than Clinton-Kaine (to whom he lost the popular vote).  He was throwing all his bullshit tropes at the wall and not one stuck. He knows he's screwed.
Biden been da deal breaker but they gon let him slide cuz he vp to obama
Republican Party of Virginia weighs in on Joe Biden's pick for V.P. Chairman Jack Wilson says, "Kamala Harris exemplifies the worst parts of the Democratic Party: petty fighting, grandstanding, putting Party before People, and flip-flopping on almost every issue." #13NewsNow
Harris is too moderate &amp; has no advantage with geography or demographics. Biden should‚Äôve picked Whitmer, Duckworth, Rice, Warren, Tlaib, or Ocasi√≥-Cortez.
Under any under circumstances a Biden/Harris ticket would have a 0% chance to win the White House, but it's Trump so anything goes.  Stay home, don't vote.

Wondering why people are tweeting about Biden making such a great choice of #KamalaHarris for VP. Do they really think #Biden had anything to do with it? They hate each other. Progressive left won, she was their choice. Bye, bye Democratic party.
The question begs if Biden is a racist why would she want to be his partner and running mate.
I‚Äôm all in... love her  with that being said I would still vote Biden if he chose a goldfish cracker
it was hard enough voting for biden but now they're just being cruel
Well, I was wrong. Biden picked Dog Faced Pony Soldier instead of Rice. I predicted incorrectly. You all get a refund for every penny you paid me. üòâ
i'd be more worried about Biden &amp; the Ukraine
Best choice Biden Harris
Okay, let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs true. At this point it‚Äôs too late, but continuing to bring this up reduces Biden‚Äôs chance by pushing people away from him as a candidate.

Leave it to Biden to pick the worse possible choice for his running mate.
I have been waiting for anyone to provide real proof of this trump talking point and so far no one has. Makes a person think it‚Äôs faked for the purpose of pulling votes away from Biden.
I'll concede that. But at the same time, there are a lot of people with liberal sensibilities who were looking for a reason to vote for Biden. I can't imagine the hypocrite who laughed about smoking pot after locking up drug offenders for years will help persuade them.
#2020Elections I‚Äôm so excited that Biden chose Harris! I‚Äôll pay money to see her debate Pence! Even if I watch in my own living room. She‚Äôll decimate him in 25 words or less.
She's not my first choice but I am willing to bet that Biden and his team know what will be the most likely ticket to win back the White House. And I am all for that!

Harris wasn‚Äôt my first pick but it is an excellent choice. She will energize women &amp; minorities to rally around the ticket, Biden‚Äôs age will be less of a liability with a much younger VP, and her vacated seat in the Senate will easily be filled by a Democrat. #BidenHarris2020

you going to ask Biden about lying all the time or nah?
I‚Äôd love to talk to the people in charge of Biden‚Äôs Twitter...or the guy who controls his eyes.
Biden announced MONTHS ago his pick would be a woman of color. Because the Dems pander for the minority vote. She was not picked for her qualifications, experience, or accomplishments. She was chosen because of gender and color. btw, look up the definition of racism and misogyny.

Your party is going up in flames because your only enthused voters want to defund cops, so you pick the two people most responsible for jailing black men.  You're going to be a breeze to beat.  Clearly, no good candidates wanted to run with Biden because your party went nuts.

It just shows that Biden is working harder than you trump
Telling us we do have to vote for Biden in a safe blue state just feels like ‚Äúget in line because we say so‚Äù, and that‚Äôs not how you get none voters to vote. If you want votes, you have to earn them, by pushing what people want, not just shouting against what they don‚Äôt want
But for the love of god, don‚Äôt tell people who don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden because of his very real political flaws that they MUST vote for him in a state he‚Äôs going to win anyway, NYs electoral votes aren‚Äôt on the line here, everyone knows this. We don‚Äôt have to vote for him
Patronizingly telling ‚ÄúBernie Bros‚Äù they need to vote for Biden isn‚Äôt going to get you that surge, it‚Äôs just turning those people off to voting at all. Tell them about the down ballot races with candidates they can get excited about.

Seriously tho. Some can't vote for the lesser of two evils. Most don't even know the policies these people have or their history, yet they're expected to vote?  I mean, im voting but I understand why other niggas won't vote. What Biden gonna do for the hood? PUT MORE BLACKS AWAY?
No they're only options. And only a house nigga would even contemplate voting for a racist like Biden.

You could have made that argument for any previous presidential race. So why didn't you? Everyone knows the real answer and the real reason why you don't want Biden debating Trump.
Every time you talk about skipping presidential debates your lame excuses don't hold water. You simply realize that Biden is mentally incapable of debating not only Trump but just about anybody. Truly sad.

You are being lied to. Look up all of the things that Trump has done to elevate the black community in just the last 3 years. Then look up all the racist anti-segregation stances Biden has stood for and voted for over the last 40 years. Don‚Äôt let them tell you how to think.

A great choice for basement Biden. He can't come out of the closet &amp; she loves coming out in every gay-pride parade. She's right up there with Maxine Waters, AOC, Ilhan Omar, &amp; Nancy Pelosi.ü§¢ Trump should start planning his inauguration now.üá∫üá≤TRUMP2020üá∫üá∏
Except for during the debates, Biden shouldn't mention Trump at all. He should just start acting like he's already the president.   There is nothing Trump hates more than being ignored.
Trump and Biden is like picking between getting hit by a FedEx truck or ups truck

Anyone Biden picks is a concern. I'm just surprised it wasn't one of the Marxist BLM leaders. I guess they're too busy working for Obama &amp; Soros. Kind of like Satan's ground soldiers.
CNN needs to go after Biden in the same shameful way they went after Tucker!

At least that Japanese performed Seppuku after they were captured, but during the battle, it‚Äôs a different strategy. Biden is dumb, Harris is smug, but a death cult might be a bit worse. The choice is yours, but when I was homeless and starving I didn‚Äôt holdout for filet and lobs

Strong words from Harris: "He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden; And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
You are correct, Biden isn‚Äôt an ally.  That‚Äôs really not my point.  I think the economic harm that Trump has created will exacerbate existing problems inside communities of color.  It‚Äôs like smoking, every minute trump is in office shifts the 2053 problem closer to 2020.

hey Steve can you please speak to these black folk about dragging  Kamala Harris, we need to rally together and support the Biden/Harris ticket. Please!
That‚Äôs the best reason to elect Biden. Besides the fact that he‚Äôs not morally bankrupt like Trump is.

Not sure what that fake headline has to do with Biden, but we know the answer to the question is NO. Trump and you worthless-stains-on-humanity trumpists have shown that intelligence and "brains" aren't a prerequisite.
That, plus on Tucker right after the announcement a Dem strategist (can't remember the name) rolled out the women who want to take Trump to court for harassment/assault. Harris and that will be the attempt to draw women back to the Biden ticket. Transparent, but the same playbookThe Biden-Harris ticket isn't perfect. No ticket ever was and no ticket ever will be. Perhaps, for whatever reason, Vice President Biden and/or Senator Harris don't pass your purity test. Just know this, they will be much better than four more years of Trump.
I know we can't all agree on everything. Now, this is a two candidate race Biden or Trump. Those are our only choices. One of them will be our President as a result of this election.
Now that the Democratic President-Vice President ticket is set, and Vice President Biden with Senator Harris are going to be the Democratic ticket on the November ballot, I figured now is a good time to remind everyone that:
They don't want Biden to do any interviews but they will want the Pence-Harris debate. Trouble is one presidential debate is scheduled--9/29--before the VP debate on October 7. What will they do? Will Biden debate on 9/29?
His first shot is 2024 and if the Dems lose this year he'll be in a better position than she will. So, will the California governor be rooting for Biden-Harris this year?
It‚Äôs called progressing.  Generally a hallmark of a non Conservative viewpoint. Biden‚Äôs views have also moved further left than previously.
Nothing like that was in the cards 4 years ago. There's a decent chance that if Biden has a good night he wins Texas. As a Democrat.
She wasn‚Äôt rejected.  She wasn‚Äôt the 1st choice for President.  However, due to the support of black women in electing Biden, Kamala makes the perfect compliment for Dem representation.  Plus she‚Äôs the most effective in pinning down GOP liars.

Have to say that I am VERY surprised that they're this off message and upprepared.  Just another sign that Trump is incompetent.
It‚Äôs not just the shade of skin or country of origin. Biden summed up many ‚Äòliberals‚Äô attitudes to people of colour when he said a black Trump supporter ‚Äúain‚Äôt black‚Äù. You see the same in the ‚Äòuncle Tom‚Äô narrative from the left in the UK towards anyone of colour who is a Tory.

I‚Äôm considering it an awesome Biden/Harris song. Gonna go listen now!  #ElectricAvenue  üíôüíôüíô
Its the smile - she is so intelligent and confident. Wonderful for the people of the USA if Biden wins.
"This openness has also extended to the policy process that has been undertaken in the wake of the fight for the nomination. Since May, Biden‚Äôs team has been working in six policy task forces on the economy, healthcare, immigration, criminal justice, climate and education."
"Once again, the pragmatist (Biden) has revealed an openness to new ways that some might have thought beyond him."
Trump will take this election to a new low.
"‚ÄúThis morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up, especially little black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued. Today, just maybe, they‚Äôre seeing themselves for the first time in a new way,‚Äù Biden said."
Given the fact its not Democratic voters and resisters you need to win over but no voters or "swing" voters. She was great talking about Biden's character though. The emotion in her voice when she spoke of Beau Biden and how he'd told stories of his father was audible + authentic
So you're saying Biden's willing to do hard work for the US?  Really put his back into it?  As opposed to....you
Thank you so much for not being hostile with your reply. I do understand the situation of Biden supporters. I do. I admit: he is SIGNIFICANTLY better than what we have now and I‚Äôm not saying DONT vote for him. At this point, I‚Äôm saying please understand ME.
So why did Joe Biden mangle her name today when he was introducing her?  To disrespect her?
On top of that just like with clinton, when it seems like a lesser of 2 evil candidates is going to win from polls then voter turnout will be low. People aren‚Äôt enthusiastic about voting biden, so they aren‚Äôt going to vote if they feel like the lesser evil already has it.
If you‚Äôre going to vote for biden keep your lips sealed. Don‚Äôt vote for him in polls. Make the dem party scared they‚Äôre going to lose. That is the ONLY way we MIGHT get progressive concessions. Idc if you‚Äôre vote blue no matter who, at least make it seem like you aren‚Äôt.
Americans can be so fucking weird. Imagine giving so much of a fuck about whether or not Joe Biden really is a Catholic?
I must apologize.   I went out and told a bunch of people that Harris was a crooked cop. That is not true. I was wrong and I apologize.   Biden‚Äôs choice of VP was not a cop. Just a bootlicker.
According to Biden a massive crowd    means more than he can count with his hands. He was so impressed to see more than several people waiting for him and Kamala.

Biden/Harris, then? OK. Can't say I'm happy with either's track record. They're conservative enough to appeal to some Republican demographics. BUT they're not Trump, and might play by the rules.  I'm not American, but they or Trump will have their hands on our leash soon enough.
Love that Biden chose Harris:  She's smart, tough, has experience in an executive branch (Atty Gen'l of CA), and the legislative branch (Senator) which ideally suits her for VP.  She's a killer debater as well.  I'm excited about this ticket!!
Trump supporters using morality, cognitive degeneration, questionable sexual behaviours to attack Biden is a bizarre self-own that they still don't get.

But also the issue for her was profile... this is how to get her profile and credentials up. Did Biden pick her OR did the Democratic leadership? If the latter then you can see they are looking to secure their future.
Oh my. Another "nasty woman."  And look at Biden choosing her because he's not afraid of a woman who stands up for herself. He chose a woman who is strong, independent, who will call him out if he deserves it and who is not afraid of a fight.  Because Biden isn't a pussy.
To be fair  I don‚Äôt know a great deal about her so will research but Biden is dreadful
Would be better if she was running for president it would be brilliant and Biden as vice ü§î
Here comes hope!  "Biden‚Äôs VP pick ‚Äòmakes America look more like America‚Äô ‚Äì and now Harris is better placed than anyone to be the first female president"
She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Joe Biden picks his VP no she was picked for him - A friend of mine who has lived in the USA for many years only said yesterday BEFORE the announcement it would be a black female with Biden stepping down in around 18mth and her not only 1st female but 1st black female president
‚ÄúHer own life story is one that I and so many others can see in ourselves,‚Äù Obama said in a statement on Tuesday. ‚ÄúA story that says that no matter where you come from, what you look like, how you worship, or who you love, there‚Äôs a place for you here.‚Äù
In choosing Kamala Harris, Biden may have found the anti-Trump
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate in historic first for a woman of color
BIden has a set of viewpoints.  He‚Äôs pragmatic.  He wants good outcomes.  He‚Äôs not a revolutionary.  He‚Äôs he can be moved left.
If I was Biden, I'd want the furniture in there disinfected before sitting down. Trumpelstiltzkin probably farts and dumps himself all the time. His baby diaper is overflowing with contempt.
I KNOW KAMALA AND BIDEN ARE TRASH BUT THEY ARE BETTER THAN TRUMP, STOP TELLING PEOPLE NOT TO VOTE FOR THEM, IF YALL WANT SOME SORT OF CHANGE AND THINGS TO GET BETTER, VOTE BLUE
I'm not on Team Biden, but I'll vote for him, because I totally understand the ramifications of not.
You think this is gonna get Republicans on the fence to vote for Biden?
I keep seeing people go "Well, I'm definitely NOT voting Biden NOW!" Yeah, so you're totally fine if Trump wins losing RBG's seat on the Supreme Court and stacking it towards the right's favor? Because that's the risk more than any one person.
Dear ‚Å¶ the heck are you trying to say with this headline? Seriously? ü§¨ #CasualRacism  Biden's VP pick: Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots
Checked the thread. Egregiously so. I was just feeling the vibe of Biden's announcement.
It's just an example. I don't know what you want from this election. All's I'm saying is that Biden is the best chance we have to throw 45 out of the white house and into a jail cell.
What do you expect Biden to do? Build you a freaking mansion? I got news for you, honey. He's not going to be able to do that.
Let's go! #BidenHarris2020
Reminder, because I know a lot of y'all are all torn up about the Biden/Harris ticket -- if you stop pushing, you start getting pushed. There is ONLY forward. Keep your head, eyes, and fist UP.
Biden is a devot Catholic
Warren as Senate Majority leader. We could make this happen without electing Biden.
She is a senator from a dependably Democratic state. She has strong law and order bona fides. And she is capable of verbally eviscerating her opponents. The VP debates cannot come soon enough. Harris can be the attack dog while Biden stays the nice guy.
I can‚Äôt believe that of all the eligible Democrats in this country, the best the party could do was Biden/Harris.  Will I vote for them? Yeah, because Trump needs to go. But I‚Äôm not gonna be happy about it. I‚Äôm not gonna feel good about it in any way, really.
He‚Äôs deranged, it‚Äôs been quite obvious for years. He‚Äôs not normal, it‚Äôs plain to see. But what‚Äôs almost as sad, is you‚Äôve got Biden as the alternative. US politics is becoming an anecdote. #borisisalazybastard and #trump is a loon
It is called a press conference, something Biden doesn't do, and Trump responded to a question.
go home Mr Biden
She's a good choice. I like the sound of Biden-Harris.
Lol! She‚Äôs locked up so many black people. Biden didn‚Äôt do his HW. He just saw color
Being at one time on the receiving end of Harris' attacks, I think Biden wants to release that rage on Trump and Pence both. He can remain the good guy.
Joe Biden isn't his own man. Has NO CHOICE but to pick a black female Democrat because 100 black male Democrat ORDERED Biden to do so or risk black flight from Democrat party.
Keep your ears tuned. Biden &amp; Harris: the Gaffe Gurus!
And yes, I just ordered a yard sign and contributed to the Biden/Harris campaign.
Over-under on the number of months before Biden resigns over health issues.
I do think it's lose/lose but change my mind bro. Biden been in that bitch 50 years.
Biden confirmed it just now.
Yes!!!!! Excellent news! üåüüåüüåü Well done    BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
To the Biden campaign.  Text 30330 was late sending messages.
This is actually brilliant.  And driving Trump absolutely NUTS.  He wants to have this kind of rapt attention and Biden is just letting it hang...
Biden only has 7 million.
Biden knows. üôÇ  Even if he didn‚Äôt realize this on his own, he has some savvy advisers!
Right now, in this post George Floyd era, he MUST pick a black woman.  I really love Gretchen Witmer and feel she'd be fantastic as VP, but so was Amy K who withdrew with a mandate that Biden pick a black woman.  Trumpers wouldn't vote for Biden if he was anointed Pope. #Itstime
Well, whoever it is WILL be taking over before Biden has any chance at all of finishing his first and only term.
Should we compare current 1st lady naked and next 1st lady never naked?  Should we compare lying current 1st lady's 'einstein visa' with next 1st lady's medical degree? Should we compare current 1st lady's "BE Best" or plagiarism claims and Dr. Jill Biden's decades of healing.
I want to believe that there's a speaking slot for any and all pets of the Biden family
Absolute loony tune! The sooner Biden gets in the better!
People getting angry about this are just bored.  Just because this is an atypical election doesn't mean Biden should forgo the time he has to vet. Picking a Veep early doesn't make the election come sooner or benefit the campaign in any way.
You‚Äôre going to vote Democrat no matter who Biden chooses.
And he says Joe Biden has dementia.
Biden is ALSO a fascist.  Being a petite fascist is still being a fascist.
I'm catching up with you. You've been backed my L.Graham, ur good with 2A, farming, life - all great stuff, even the dirty shirt, and you're focusing the blame for the virus on China, just like Trump, so please don't do anything that threaten us into a Biden "leadership." ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è
The USA rank #10 in COVID death globally per million and we talk as if we are the worst country in the world even though we have the most obese people in the world   Remove 1/2 the BS deaths from NY and NJ then miraculously we look real good  Facts are skewed to give Biden the WH
Under control. Who makes him take his meds? Who critiques his performance?  A lot of MAGAs will tell you Biden is on his way out mentally too but even if he was, the people around him work for the Greater Good, not the glorification of their master  Face on Mount Rushmore indeed
I don't give a fuck if Kamala Harris unfollowed or didn't unfollow Biden, nor do I give a fuck who Bidens VP pick is. I'm tired #WAP #derecho #coronavirus #IRS #garybusey
My guess is that it's all made up to bring attention back to him and stir up support. He'll claim it was a Biden supporter and all the people on the fence will vote for Trump out of shock and sympathy.
Can we compare the stuff that happened under Obama and what happened under Trump?    Of course the last question was a totally rigged question for him to claim treason on Obama and Biden.  It's not going to work donny.
That should be his campaign slogan. Biden: Come on, man!
I feel that too. Trump and Johnson are the bottom corner blocks in a jenga tower. Take one out and it becomes unstable, both out and it falls. Here's hoping Biden will take the first block out.
You said Biden is corrupt. We want data. Sources. Citations.  Ranting doesn‚Äôt count.  Show us something worth paying attention to and we‚Äôll pay attention.   Sorry if that sounds quirky to you, but that‚Äôs how we  roll.
Watching 'Iraq' documentary shows just how weak and dangerous Obama was...Biden would be even worse......Trump has to be re-elected otherwise theres more trouble ahead.
I hope we have defunded violent police and are exploring other options by then. But yes, I will be voting Biden.
If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden.  You won‚Äôt have to worry about making a choice next time.
He‚Äôs exactly the same is he‚Äôs always been.  He‚Äôs a little goofy but still serious when he needs to be.  And better than the current criminal in chief by miles.  If you don‚Äôt want Trump forever, you best vote Biden
US passes 5m Covid-19 cases as Joe Biden says pandemic 'breaks heart'
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Joe Biden in his own words: "If you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut."
I‚Äôm a Centrist that‚Äôs been force to watch the worst of both Biden and Trump ads. Biden isn‚Äôt mentally capable of taking office. If you‚Äôve been around people with dementia it‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôs in the early stages. Trump, Trump is just an ass. A well meaning one, but still an ass.
Russia &amp; Trump/Kanye West, the latter having publicly admitted to voter fraud by saying he's only doing it to take votes away from Biden to help Trump. You've got to put a spending cap on political funding of hundreds of thousands, not billions, not millions, to include the poor.
So that Biden is left with the headache and gets the blame.
Biden can't remember where he put the signs
Yes, but... As a Brit foreign policy pro: Biden's a foreign policy fool. Never met an issue he didn't mis-analogise or misunderstand.   Although... Rice is just wrong-headed.  So... Pick Kamala. And let the foreign policy process push back when Biden's wrong. He'll listen.
Just curious, how many times did donny trump go to church in his entire, pathetic life that he didn't HAVE to go?    Joe Biden went to church almost every Sunday if he could.  Yet trump claims Joe hates God?  What kind of sick piece of crap attacks another mans faith?  Sickening.
donny has a serious set of problems.. Funny he's got so many cognitive issues and trump says Biden does.. Projection..
YES! LMFAO  ! EVERYONE HATES BIDEN!!!
Trump's ranting about his wall and Biden wanting to remove it so "ILLEGALS" can breeze right in.  Everything trump lies about is what he is doing himself.  Maybe a few new miles of wall, but mostly just renovations.  LIE LIE LIE.. when trump is burning in hell, his tombstone: LIE
They watched last minute reopening of HRC emails tank her numbers. He's planning to spew last minute Ukraine BS as NEW INFORMATION to tank Biden's numbers hoping there won't be time to effectively refute it before election. Hopefully last minute lawsuit results will tank Trump.
Trump is saying exactly what he himself is going to do.  Crying Chuck Schumer.  He's really the most vile piece of crap ever.  He's lying about 276 miles of walls.  He's done nearly ZERO new miles.  Biden is going to tear the walls down..  How is it he's allowed to lie so much?
Joe has no idea what he's doing-he's desperate. The US deep down knows you're the man to MAGA. The left try hard but hopefully when the time comes the US electorate will see Biden is a fake-determined to ruin the economy for the sake of it.

gym jordan would be calling for biden's impeachment.
And the Palin example is different, as that was a matter of actual campaign policy. Biden certainly hasn't established an official policy of shitting on Democratic women. It's not like Symone Sanders is giving press conferences attacking any of these candidates.
Because the Veep is being chosen at the same time as normal, right before the convention? Seriously?  "I was gonna help save the republic from fascism, but Biden didn't give me a Veep months before he was nominated."
We don't know when Biden picked his running mate, either.
What did Biden say? Was it a coded statement? Apparently I am not intelligent enough to decode it even if I have a PhD degree.
Biden's promises are worth even less than his policies  Gonna be hard to yank the rug out from under us if we refuse to stand on it
It‚Äôs astounding that saying ‚ÄúJesus is King‚Äù apparently equals ‚Äúsiphoning votes from Biden.‚Äù I wonder what Biden would make of that interpretation... üßê
The end of covi-19 is not timed. Neither vaccine or medication will bring it end.The election is not an occasion to fight or celebrate.Trump winning will take the nation to nowhere except worse,Biden winning will need four+ years to clean up and turn the arrow up if he could.
I mean, I get that a lot of us are stuck at home and eager to get this over with so Biden can work to curtail the pandemic, but announcing the Veep early doesn't actually make the election come any sooner.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that it's a bad idea to put someone in charge of your campaign's Latino outreach who can't stop bragging about her connections to Contra death squads.
You *can‚Äôt* play with my heart like that! I literally ‚Äî *Biden voice* literally ‚Äî have Disc 2 of ‚ÄúThe Living Infinite‚Äù in my car CD player right now.
its the want Biden to win for me
Biden and Harris complement each other pretty perfectly.  I can‚Äôt find a single valid reason for her NOT to be the pick.
and this is the reason I don‚Äôt understand how Biden got the Nomination
No, but it means if you're dedicated to getting trump out you NEED to vote for Biden.
A vote for Biden would be a vote for criminals and enemies. Treasonous gangs who committed #ObamaGate and pedophiles want Biden's win. China, Iran and globalists like Soros hope Biden's win.   Vote for Trump to #KAG.
Biden: "My son's death lead me to believe deeply that no one should have to suffer from not having quality health care."  You idiots: "Biden said we don't deserve health care!"  Like, WTF?
Where the hell did you read that Biden wants to imprison Communists? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
And against the candidate who was leading in the primaries nearly the entire time. It's not like Biden was some dark horse candidate.
Never did I see a map in 2016 with Mississippi as a toss-up. Making shit up doesn't help your case.  "Sure, Biden is ahead in the polls now but in 2016 everyone said Clinton would win all 50 states."

Should‚Äôve been Bernie/Tulsi but now I gotta watch Joe Biden get utterly obliterated on the debate floorüíÄ
Thank you for that. Sorry. Very passionate about this.... The votes of black folks are always good enough to bail out the democratic party when they're in a jam, but then we're rewarded with Whitmer pics? Really?  Joe Biden said "Thank You" , to US, tonight.*  Very emotional. üá∫üá∏
For the record, the choice was clear (to some of us) while ya'll were out here posting pictures of Gretchen Whitner and Biden, thinking that was cute.*   But nevertheless, we digress. Our point has been proven. Better late than never. Your welcome  Onward to victory
I‚Äôm gonna vote for Biden/Harris so fucking hard omg
Aren't most of those people spending far more of their time criticizing Biden?
Congrats to "scrappy Kam"  Harris on being selected as Biden's VP. Get your fighting stance on girl! I am so proud of you because you look like me !
Trump claims he would have beaten George Washington in election while bragging about non-existent poll numbers  #news #feedly
I remember you saying she seemed a good candidate , your beautiful country deserves so much better than the liar you have at the moment and I will be wishing the Biden Harris ticket all the luck in the world in November.
That being said Biden still the best and ONLY choice but ion feel good about this shit at all
I wouldn't care if he picks Mitt Romney. I'm still voting for Biden!!
Because Trump hid in the WH ‚Äúsafe room‚Äù in the basement and got made fun of so he is trying to turn his ridicule on to Biden. It‚Äôs not working
To be sure. In fact, should Biden win, you'll see the number go to zero.
(Not that you'll respond but...)  A friendly reminder that without the black electorate, of which black women are the absolute bedrock, and comprise the loyal base of the dem party, you (as in Chris) would not have Biden to brag about at this moment.  Hence, the pick will Harris.
With mail-in voting, everybody in that shot is going to somehow cast their vote for Biden.
(Someone's scared of Biden.... guess being sleepy ain't so bad after all, huh? üòÇüòÇ)
Biden's gaffs &amp; ineptitude.
Do you guys not realize that this is not cute?  This is Iowa / NH redux. White folks, for whatever the reason, do not understand the needs of the black electorate, and in particular black women, who are the base of the dem party. WE haulted Bernie in SC, GIVING YOU BIDEN.*
Seeing as how Biden has promised to shutdown coal &amp; steel in PA anyone who votes for him in PA is a fool.
Franklin said that those who would sacrifice liberty for freedom deserve neither. Biden voters are willing to surrender both &amp; liberty &amp; safety are insane.
So what? Biden's an easy target. If it bothers you so much, don't cover it, you big crybaby.
He's not Joe Biden and doesn't think like the radical Dem lefties.
It amazes me that team Biden would even consider Rice as a VP contender, what with all the baggage she brings.
Maybe the fact just today Biden said The Latino community is more diverse  unlike the black community, but let‚Äôs ignore that right ?
One can believe Rice would be a mistaken choice and also support Biden even if he makes that error. That‚Äôs where I am. I wish  was there, too.
To the extent anyone cares, this is my ranked preferences for Biden‚Äôs VP pick: 1) Val Demings 2) Tammy Duckworth 3) Kamala Harris  Anyone else, imho, would be a mistake.
Elizabeth Warren was the closest to getting the presidential nomination of all the women. She is the strongest support for Biden should be the VP pick.
Biden's "gaffe's" are just examples of a human being existing as a normal human being. Hence, they are not gaffes.   That is journalistic speak, and its kind of insulting. It wags a finger, quietly stating that you yourself are always perfect, never making mistakes.*If Biden wins and gives a lawful order to have a stubborn Trump removed from the West Wing, the military will obey. But it is not up to Milley or any other general to decide, or to act as arbiter in any political, even constitutional, crisis.

Trump is racist, cartoonishly corrupt, and destroying our standing in the world. So it ain't Trump is a pretty compelling reason.  Biden is a center left technocrat, he'll be great. Prior to running most republicans also thought he was a great person.

Biden wasn‚Äôt my choice either. But I will happily cast my vote for him and then for Kamala in 2024. And your money, your choice. I think all tactics should be employed, the stakes are too high to be prudish at this point.
You argued that Biden has moved left. I responded with the FACT that Biden has advocated for conservative policies in the past, and that where Biden claims to have moved left, there is no indication that he was being sincere (I/E, Wall St. Donors) so your argument is invalid.
So Democrats want us to put the fate of the election in the hands of people who believe Biden is their only hope for survival. What could go wrong?
Biden expands lead over Trump to double digits: poll
To keep up the illusion that Obama/Biden are "progressive." In reality both are neoliberal right-wing corporatist warmongers. The entire reason Democrats can't afford a progressive takeover, is because everyone would quickly realize how the Democratic party is awful/corrupt/evil.

Look who is speaking right before Joe Biden!
I think the craziest thing is that reporters &amp; pundits didn't understand that Biden's "soul of the nation" resonated with people. This election isn't about a bunch of policies; it is about how we want to define ourselves as a people. That may seem old-fashioned, but it's true.

lol all these people worrying about the USPS. The election is already over. It doesn‚Äôt matter who actually wins. Biden will have all the harvested ballots he will need. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs done.
I don't understand why Twitter tagged this as manipulated media.  It's not, it's clips of Hannity talking about Biden's supposed "decline" while showing pictures of Trump. This is a context shift for criticism, not manipulation.
our realities we experienced in the decades Biden has been in DC has been worse than Trump. some people will see the nuances, but many wont care to. Biden did them dirtier than Trump has. some will vote for Trump. Democrats already decided thats a chance they are willing to take.

the point is we are long past that era, and Biden still holds the same positions that Republicans from that period held. Obama picked Biden as VP to appeal to white conservatives. Obama and Biden are not synonymous. not everyone believes Biden is "obviously" better than Trump.
Now  thinks presidential debates are a waste of time.  How convenient for a candidate like Joe Biden

If Biden wins and gives a lawful order to have a stubborn Trump removed from the West Wing, the military will obey. But it is not up to Milley or any other general to decide, or to act as arbiter in any political, even constitutional, crisis.

Joe the Biden
The most left-wing candidate in the Democratic primaries was Bernie Sanders. Next to the left was Elizabeth Warren. Biden &amp; Harris in fact are moderate Democrats. Since there are no moderate Republicans anymore, most moderate Americans will vote Democratic in November.

Thank u.. I'm all in to fight after we get trash45 out. Right now these so called progressive ppl saying Biden=45 is the biggest white privilege I've seen. Anybody that thinks keeping 45 in and not cone together to get him out doesn't GAF about Black folx. I'm pissed!
The dancing Elephant in the room is when if ever will reporters find some ethics and responsibility and start asking Biden and Harris some hard questions.  Not gotcha questions but ones that any "honest" 6th grader would ask - like how the hell are you going to pay for all this?
I keep hearing so much emphasis on MSNBC about women&amp; black ppl who are so thrilled with the Harris pick, but my husband &amp; I aren't either. We're both--wait for it-- White Men--Ew! But we just donated to Biden/Harris, so it's not just women &amp; blacks. White Gays Love Kamala too!üôè

Read the transcript.  Biden is lying.
Also even if the progressives fully stand behind Biden in the same way they did in 2016 with Hillary (myself included) guess what? The establishment is STILL going to blame us if they lose. It‚Äôs a lose-lose situation for progressives as long as we play by their rules.
WHAT DO YOU THINK? Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide mask mandate.  READ MORE:
Biden's staff. Hollywood. Soros.  Just a few examples of potential suspects.
Biden is backwards
We can't change none of these candidates that are running in the presidential election. I wasn't a fan of Joe Biden but the time to show concern was during the primary elections.  #democrats #republican #VOTE #bidenharris2020  #cvsthoughts
So who is the chode that bailed him out? One of Biden's staff? Another woketurd Hollywood riffraff.
Both the Communist Party of America and Communist China have thrown their support behind Biden.  "Muh Putin" is no longer an argument.
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
lol I probably would‚Äôve said the same thing tbh not because I‚Äôm a Trump supporter but bc I hate Biden
Biden gonna get us to vote for a cop the same way Ross got us cheering for a C.O.
Joe Biden is trying to take credit
The lack of chemistry between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is apparent and concerning
Playing the long game sometimes means *not* striking first.   I am unconvinced that Pelosi could do something better than what the Biden campaign has done so far with getting the message out.
Drumming up anti-Trump publicity and rallying the American people IS WHAT BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN IS FOR.   Pelosi isn't going to distract from that with an impeachment proceeding that's only going to divert resources away from Biden's efforts. Nor should she.
Really? Just impeach him and broadcast the hearings again? With the Senate unwilling to convict? That's like rebuilding the Death Star and *hoping* the Rebels won't just blow it up again.  Also, the Biden campaign has enough money and resources to cut ads with elderly and vets.
That‚Äôs the current position specifically for Biden. That was not the presidential position in ‚Äò08 or ‚Äò12 and is not the position in many of the congressional or state races. Wouldn‚Äôt exactly call that ‚Äúclassical‚Äù so much as ‚Äúnecessary for this moment‚Äú

And how many people voted in the primary? Also, Biden has been terrible to the black community, even if we have supported him. He got the vote because of Obama.
I will unfollow any supposed resistor who says they won't support a Biden/Harris ticket

It will be come November. Even if there‚Äôs no crossover already, the people saying the top line will vote Biden and people who aren‚Äôt saying the top line will be endorsing it by voting for the left.  I say this as somebody who isn‚Äôt a Trump supporter this time or last time.

Yes, they have. Tara Reade changed her story five times and pro-Bernie journalists admitted to coaching her corroborating witnesses.   As for O'Connell's niece, it was documented that Biden was not even at the event where the assault allegedly happened.  They were debunked.
Your ilk literally tried to exploit Biden's speech impediment in order to falsely suggest he was senile as part of a harebrained ploy to overturn the will of the party's primary voters.  You have quite a nerve to lecture us on coming in "good faith".
He isn't a creep -- pics of him "sniffing" kids were taken out of context. A few of those kids (now grown) say they took no issue with him.  Your one and only issue with Biden is that he isn't a member of your socialist tribe and that he beat Bernie.
Biden has advocated for trimming SS and Medicaid in the past, not with doing away with them entirely like Trump is proposing.
You literally got caught writing policy for the Trump White House which you touted on CNN without disclosing your involvement.  Why the hell would Biden take your advice on anything? Why hasn't CNN fired you?
Actually, both of her accounts are still following Biden.
It doesn't irritate me at all. I supported Kamala before I supported Biden.  What irritates me is people who insist on dividing the left for petty reasons, whether they identify as üåπ Twitter or KHive.
By virtue of the fact that he wouldn't allow 160,000 people to die because unlike Trump he understands masks and testing, yes, Biden winning would be a win.
Even though Dems liked some of his ideas, Sanders and his top people spent the past five years antagonizing and alienating both the party AND the voters. The other candidates didn't need Obama's permission to turn to Biden to block Sanders -- they were fine doing it by themselves
Biden would be in the basement
Your VP of choice was my POTUS of choice, but even though she lost I took a *week off of work* before the SC primary to travel out of state go to door-to-door for Biden. Because the situation facing the country demanded it.  That's what it's about -- the country. Not me. Not you.
Headline: "Black male leaders warn Biden ‚Äòwill lose‚Äô election if he doesn't name Black female running mate" So where were we exactlty in our conversation about institutionalized RACISM????

Don't get arrested hon. It's not worth it. Just put up a huge Biden sign!
Did Biden actually say this, or did it come from Biden's staff?
I also think it would be important if Biden chose a black woman.  But I also know what whoever Biden picks is not people's highest priority now. The pandemic is.
The Biden campaign has made it perfectly clear that it is ignoring the conventional wisdom on Twitter, because Twitter is not real life.  As the primary should have demonstrated to you, the priorities of ppl on Twitter are not the same as the priorities of ppl in the real world.
How have you been continually ignored? Of the eight female candidates Biden has been considering, five of them were black. That's not being ignored.  Also, the people who badmouthed Kamala to the press only constituted a fraction of the people advising Biden on his campaign.
Bernie Sanders has committed to Joe Biden that if Biden becomes POTUS he will supply him with an endless number of black children to rub the hair on his legs and watch it pop back up.

You said if Biden wins the narrative will suddenly change...trump has handled this shit as bad as possible...however the numbers are (not sure how u know they're inflated) he hasn't helped things at all. He's called it bullshit from the jump
Suggestion: there has to be a more central element of the Democratic Party. The only way to take your Party back is vote against Biden, (Trump maybe?) then when Republicans gain more control, do what you have to do to claim your integrity back! One step back B4 U step forward...
This cake is baked. Those of us who support Biden need to vote like our lives depend on it! Those that still support Trump either think they will get more money or power or don't believe anything anyone says against Trump because they are just stupid!
Former Vice President  says he would stop construction of the border wall between Mexico and the U.S. when he's president.
1. The gentleman is clearly referring to racial attitudes within his community, not to his civil rights being stagnated because of Democrats.  2. Later in the report he explains why he votes for Biden and is skeptical of Bernie.
Biden was actually consistently far ahead in the polls until Iowa and New Hampshire. The other candidates dropped out and backed Biden b/c 1: Bernie was unelectable, esp. after the comments about Castro, and 2: Bernie and his people have spent 5 years antagonizing the party.
Southern black voters like Biden because he was open-minded enough to serve as Obama's vice president for eight years without ever trying to undermine him. They like Biden because they are *grateful* to him and find him trustworthy, not because of learned helplessness.
I actually took a week off of work to go door-to-door for Biden in Greenville, SC, and talked to dozens of black voters for over 7 days leading up to the primary. That was more informative for me than a single TV segment. They were nowhere near as jaded or cynical as you imply.
The voters in the South who went for Biden were *black voters*, and like it or not they are the most powerful bloc in the party's base. Are you sure you want to go down the road saying their votes shouldn't count?
Since 2016, TYT and the narrow faction of the left it represents have treated Dems like the enemy instead of the GOP. When they lose, they spread lies about "centrist" Dems, such as Joe Biden being senile (which 45 picked up).  Why DO they deserve press credentials for the DNC?

Funny how that is, I know teachers voting for Biden
So All Trump supporters are racist, but Biden says that all black people are the same, and that‚Äôs not racist.
And yet Biden beat Bernie in the last primary debates despite being "not all there mentally".

President Trump tells crowd on tarmac that Joe Biden wants to "take away your guns, destroy your Second Amendment, no religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God, he's against God, he's against guns."
Joe Biden referred to abortion as "healthcare". That is despicable. As bad as anything Trump has done. The Democrats stand for, not just tolerance of LGBTQ (sexual perversion), but the celebration of it. I'm all for tolerance of sinners, but make no mistake LGBTQ behavior is...
For the love of God. Biden makes a silly remark while Trump is out and out racist! He's a white supremist and has done everything possible to deny black voters rights. He disrespected John Lewis and you don't know who to vote for? Please!!!!!

there's no revolution and there's no other candidate that can defeat trump. we're lucky at this point if the people who can't decide between biden or trump are going to vote for biden because of how much he's been dragged through the mud.
okay okay question time for y'all: what do you want us to do? obviously biden and harris suck but like,,, what else? we know voting third party isn't gonna work. we know that there people are ~slightly~ better than trump. so what are y'all planning on doing? (1/2)

Any of my civic-minded tech friends know how to get Google's attention on something like this? It pains me that there are people out there searching for "reasons to vote for Biden" &amp; getting Trump Campaign results        ?
In other words, testing is a failure and it won't be fixed until Joe Biden becomes President.
have you tried the website page specifically filled with biden policies
Biden has humility. What a refreshing characteristic!
"Biden is 77, not 87 or 97," said Sabato. "To suggest that a man who is in reasonably good shape, eats well, exercises, has a stimulating job and a mission in life is on his deathbed is outrageous."
and also, realistically, green party won't win, so I'm genuinely curious: why just not vote biden, because historically more people vote for one of the two major parties, thus guaranteeing trump's removal? again this is all out of curiosity
Honestly... is she wrong? Harris is awful, but IMO Biden is worse, so technically she does make the ticket more palatable. Also, this article kinda cherry picks what she said. Read this one too:
Y'all called it correctly.  I'm a proud Obama/Clinton/Biden Neoliberal.
Put her in an oversight position in the Biden cabinet!!
Yes, but I‚Äôm not sure Biden knows the difference anymore. #DementiaJoe
Vote for Biden. Then perhaps there will be a better R candidate for you to vote for in 2024.
If Biden wins Texas, it will get much more difficult for them.
QAnon will be GOP orthodoxy in at least four years, two years if Biden wins and takes office.
Biden's the dude who's passing out crab cakes as the Titanic speeds toward the iceberg. Only this time the iceberg's gone cuz it melted.   Centrists want to treat our problems like they're a nick we got shaving, but they're spurting arterial wounds.  So no.   Just no.
That's why I call Biden a quaalude.  The goal of centrists is to mollify progressives and put them to sleep.  Not on my watch.
I‚Äôve only seen a couple, and they were generic Democrat candidate list signs. Haven‚Äôt seen a single actual Biden sign yet driving all over Virginia, even in blue spots. Have seen a bunch of Trump signs in the red counties though.

Why are you guys so intent on campaigning for Biden üòÇ
I remember my mom being worried about that one, I think she said biden really had to save him with the VP debate after that
If you wouldn‚Äôt run this about Biden, Pence, Trump, then don‚Äôt run it for Harris,
voting for Biden/Harris does NOT mean you shouldn't criticize them. I'm voting for them but I'm not happy about it, and I will absolutely hold them accountable for past actions and push them to do better.
Your argument is absolutely valid. I myself am voting Biden for the same reason. But again it's a moral argument that we have time and time again. In my lifetime every vote has been the lesser of two evils. The Democrats have just as much of a hand in how far right we've shifted.
‚ÄúDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden recently proposed a climate &amp; clean energy plan that aims to get the country to net-zero emissions by 2050.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs get real: 2050 is a very weak target.  Earth and her people deserve better.  #GeneralStrike #ClimateStrike #GreenNewDeal
26) Last let's consider the single non-poll based, strategic case offered. Note, it is NOT FOR Harris, it is rather AGAINST Trump. That counts. The case is, Trump will play right into women's vaunted hatred of him, by being mean to Harris. This is Biden's real trap for Trump.
I hope that Elizabeth Warren wins the Speaker position in the new administration of Biden/Harris. She will rock!
I get that everyone needs a bogeyman and that people like having a saviour to protect them from it, but that people on here are so emotionally invested in Trump or Biden is hard for me to grasp.   "This is the most important election in our lifetime"-kinda people are weird.
19) Her glib fluidity of speaking provides a stark contrast to Biden's stumbling, bumbling, mind-wandering, blithering idiocy. So, who will vote for their ticket that might not have otherwise? Those who want Harris for President. And, we've already tested that. She bombed.
9) I think HRC was incompetent as a leader. But that stemmed from her gross corruption far more than from personal, demonstrable incapacity. If she finds her way there, Harris' corruption will do the same. But she is not grossly incompetent as is Biden.
8) The one advantage I give Biden is that he is not HRC. He does not stir up the same visceral hatred among Republicans that she did. He is more likeable than she was. His campaign is arguably worse than hers was. Sure, there's COVID. And that gets you the big job?

14 August 2020 #MAGAanalysis   Is Kamala Harris a Trap Laid by Biden?  I don't know this author, Paul Brandus's work. But, this is not a bad article. As you'll see I disagree. But taking in what we disagree with is important.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
New NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll shows Biden‚Äôs lead expanding from +8% at end of June to +11% now. Biden 53% to Trump 42%. Biden is currently at Obama 2008 level. But can it hold? After ‚Äúconventions‚Äù, around Labor Day, let‚Äôs see.
By bringing U.S. Senator Kamala Harris onto the ticket, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has signaled support for the enforcement of U.S. anti-pollution laws and for suing companies that pollute, environmental groups said.
In 2016, it was all about micro-targeting. Maybe the plan niw is to fuck it up in places where they know they need to blunt Biden's edge(?) Guessing.
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide protective mask mandate over the next three months.
I‚Äôm bullish on Biden absent massive election rigging.  This is massive election rigging.
To be fair, most of their attempts so far have made them sound like they're actively campaigning for Biden -Harris üòÇ
Trump vs. Biden: ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòGood‚Äô Esau fighting Satan in End of Days‚Äù
So tell me what he said that was racist?   And if you believe what he said was racist I‚Äôm guessing you shouldn‚Äôt cover Biden either. After all, he‚Äôs saying racist things too.
To be fair, everytime  has tried something new, it sounds like they're actively campaigning for Biden- Harris
Poor ole Herman who died to attend  a Trump Rally has a daughter who apparently didn‚Äôt mind since she is using her departed father‚Äôs twitter account to continue to support Trump... wow!
I'm not trying to start anything, I'm just genuinely curious: to people who don't like biden (I don't either) and don't want people to vote for him, are y'all voting third party? because to me that just feels like taking the vote away from biden. idk this election just sucks
No one is pure. Let me ask this, how many Nazis &amp; those wanting to kill Blacks and Jews has Biden called ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù? His many has Trump?                      You obviously love and support Trump. I do not and cannot wait until he is gone. We probably should leave it there
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : FOX NEWS POLL: Joe Biden is up 49-42 percent over President Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup
Except, to evangelicals, Biden goes to the "wrong" church.   I had an evangelical grandma. I told her I was marrying a Catholic. Her only response was "You're consigning your children to the fires of hell"  They were never going to vote for Biden.
This is unbelievable. Seriously, California and yet he makes the exact same accusation that he made against Obama. I now believe he is afraid of this power duo of Biden &amp; Kamala. They are going to eat him up and spit him out! #BidenHarris2020
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
In Trump's thinking this animated short is good for him. What I see is a diesel powered train adding CO2 to the air, contributing to climate change. While Joe Biden has the fitness to run a hand lever rail trolley. Maybe Biden &amp; Trump can race bikes, I think I know who would win.
Biden will lose.
Hopefully Republican's can now see Trump will throw anyone under-the-bus, if he feels it will aid him in being re-elected. Governor Ron DeSantis, you marched lock-step to Trump's piping to the cliff, this is your reward for your efforts. Vote the Biden/Harris ticket for change!

Breaking #FoxNews Alert : Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
They want to enter into coalition with the center-right. This was the whole point of Biden‚Äôs campaign.
big tiddy joe biden is a crime
You do realize that Biden has a lifelong stutter and has worked hard to overcome it? Oh wait, I forgot how much Trump likes to mock disabilities, didn't realize his supporters were similarly that cruel though.
Democratic Virginia Senator Mark Warner says he is excited for the Biden-Harris ticket, as he is also up for reelection in November.

Here's a heads up in advance for tomorrow's thread. I'll analyze the pros and cons of Kamala Harris, by responding to the points in this article:
Here's a head's up on my coming thread, tomorrow. I'll analyze the case for and against Harris, by responding to the points in this article:
"Biden‚Äôs lead in the RealClearPolitics.....As of yesterday, it was 6.9 points."   It's now 7.5 points. Tell me again  how the race is "tightening".
Surley, Charlie, you know that's the opposite of the truth.  Centrist Democrats like Biden and Harris are just the left wing of the Republican Party. There's virtually 100% consensus except on little stuff.  You get that, right? Maybe it's time we abandon these Fox News fictions.
Omg quit bitching. We‚Äôre stuck w/Biden who is demonstrably not a progressive. We desperately need the moderates and as many Repubs as possible. So recognize the effort to defeat Trump. Get on board or move out of the way. You can pick this back up on Nov 4th.
We get it.   You love her.   So do we!   You should stop actively campaigning for Biden, or the Great Naked Emperor will shoot you a mean tweet.
Trump: Make America Great........but long as doesn't cut into profits! Biden: America was great! Vote Biden to clean up trump's mess!
Oh, Lord, we‚Äôre gonna wind up with President Biden in Exile.
When Biden made this announcement, I felt the burden lift‚Äîat least for awhile. Then, what‚Äôs his name forced his ugliness back into my consciousness. But I had a taste of the sweet honey that will be when our national nightmare ends. Biden/Harris/Recovery 2020
To quote  "duh."
What could a Biden presidency mean for climate change investing?
Maybe the car is Trump, the small boy is people who vote for him, and the good boy is Biden/Harris. But really I just love this video.
The point has been made that a President Biden, as Commander in Chief, can issue orders to remove that person. Once Joe's POTUS, The Codes and all authority to command armed services vanishes from Trump's grasp.
It's sweet of you to actively campaign for Biden/Harris, but aren't you afraid the Great Naked Emperor is going to send a mean tweet?
biden and harris need to talk more about how trump is purposely wrecking the USPS to delegitimize an election becuase not enough people are aware that that is happening
I nominate  as Biden‚Äôs and Harris‚Äô Secretary of Kindness and Decency.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
rural virginia republicans confuse me so much  ‚Äúwhat do you think of joe biden‚Äôs pick?‚Äù  ‚Äúif they win, this country is gone‚Äù  ‚Äúthis country‚Äôs already gone!!‚Äù  ???
A far-left radical in America is a moderate in any other developed nation. A far-left radical in America also wants what 70% of the population wants, which means that a far-left radical in America is an a real American centrist, but centrists like Biden are conservatives .
1. Start calling Kamala K Harris 2. Use that ambiguity to swap her w/ Kalia before the election 3. Kalia becomes VP 4. Biden has an accident, Kalia becomes pres. 5. She destroys the US gov. from the inside 6. ??? 7. Profit (but not really, cause capitalism needs to die w/ the US)
While prosecution sets a bad precedent, I absolutely want President Biden to make public the documents that prove President Trump's crimes and the crimes of his cabinet and staff. Let's see the verbatim records of those phone calls. Let's see the guilty emails and texts.
He promoted the falsehood in a recent speech announcing his choice of Harris for VP.
Fox's Main Female Clown Jeanine is now a soothsayer.. or perhaps she &amp; Fox have hired an assassin .. ??
I‚Äôm confused. So Republicans with the ‚ÄúLaw and Order President‚Äù are now upset with Joe Biden‚Äôs VP Pick because she is too harsh on . . . criminals??? #RepublicanHypocricy
Why are the media showing Trump‚Äôs press conferences live? It is free tv for his campaign. Record the event, show only what is true, what is newsworthy, what is non-political! No free TV without equal time to Biden-Harris. No amplifying of Trump BS and lies.
i hate that people are already dying due to catastrophic failure of planet. i hate that people are dying because they don‚Äôt have healthcare. the worst case scenario is 4 more years of Trump but i also don‚Äôt want Joe Biden who changes nothing but liberals still think they fixed it
Biden was pulling this stunt as Obama's VP, before anyone considered Donald Trump a political figure.
You got that same energy for Joe Biden? Cause he fucked it all the way up today.
I mean also it seems to me to be positive for Biden...Biden can power a moving vehicle with his own strength. He‚Äôs in good shape. Trump had to buy a train and hire people to run it. So basically a perfect representation - Biden can hard work himself, Trump can‚Äôt do squat.
You are just mad that your own daughter doesn't believe your stupid crap and is voting for Biden and Harris.
Biden and Kamala were fantastic in the debut presser tonight.
Added to the total and just picked up a Biden Harris face mask to wear all over my red county in Virginia. üíô
I hope I‚Äôm wrong but I think Trump is going to have Biden under indictment.  We have to prepare for Trump‚Äôs worst since he knows his freedom hangs on this election.
Is today the day I block Joe Biden? Maybe...
Sen. #KamalaHarris' VP selection could heighten the ticket's focus on environmental justice while prompting fresh #Trump campaign political attacks on Democrats' energy plans.
Sen. Harris gives first speech as Biden's running mate: 'I am ready to work'
The slight makes sense when you remember that Biden knows he will win without the support of the left.
To be 100% honest, I‚Äôm still sorting out my opinions on presidential elections &amp; the specific role they play in our govt. I‚Äôm also not a fan of Biden-Harris &amp; think they‚Äôre both corrupt. But the ppl who think either of those are enough to not vote against T*ump are fucking wrong
As it says NOTHING has CHANGED still the same racist! But on Nov 3rd we can change this!! BIDEN/HARRIS2020
Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball had Kamala Harris as the number one prediction for the vice presidential pick for Joe Biden for months.
Every time they mention that ‚ÄúCharlottesville‚Äù inspired Biden to run, the campaign needs to donate $1,000 to survivors and/or community healing
A cool challenge for the Biden/Harris campaign would be to stop using the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville 3 yrs ago today as a cute and fun talking point to represent the fact that white supremacy is alive and well in America and then quickly moving on
Yep, I'm guessing Biden has about 18/24 months of being President in him.
I know that this makes a moderate but I‚Äôm watching the Biden / Harris press conference and I feel so hopeful ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Vice President Biden today on August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville: "Remember how it felt to see a violent clash ensue between those celebrating hate and those standing against it? It was a wake-up call for all of us as a country. For me, it was a call to action"
The NY Times and the WaPo seem to think there might be a problem, hence the sudden volte-face in their coverage of Harris.  Given his age &amp; debility, Biden is considered unlikely to finish his first term. Voters will need to take a serious look at his VP.
#Biden/Harris2020.  This team is so awesome and both are saying the things to bring this country together!  #BlueWave2020
Biden/Obama founded ISIS. Donald Trump bombed them.
WATCH LIVE: Biden and Harris make 1st appearance as running mates in Delaware
We're definitely going to be doing that if Biden wins. I'm still a bit skeptical of any NATO-style alliance in the Pacific though. Back when we were the hegemon during the Cold War, SEATO still fell apart. My best hope is for more bilateral alliances, I'll take that at least.
Joe Biden invokes Unite the Right anniversary in his speech introducing Kamala as VP; he once again suggests Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù comments after August 12 2017 was the moment he decided to run for President
Mysogeny. Biden has done worse but Kamala gets the flack. This oppression and patriarchy within our community needs to be cleansed.
"Whining is what Donald Trump does best, better than any president in American history." -Biden
liking biden‚Äôs pocket square to be honest lmao
Ranked voting would be great and yes it would open things up.  Candidates like Biden won't get us there.  Biden is a quaalude. His purpose is to put us to sleep.  Fvck that. I'm wide awake and  mad.
I will absolutely vote for Biden. This vote is tactical; not a love letter. Yes, I‚Äôll vote against 45. But damn it I *hate* the shaming of people for not making the same choice. Biden has my vote, ok? He is 100% still shite. Garbage candidate. Stop shaming people for this view.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
I disagree about "locked up," at any point. After this summer of lawlessness, however, I do not think Biden has a chance. In my other life, though, I hope to get the data to be confident in my call in either direction.
Biden Internet VP Post: A Couple of Odd Things
The GOP is awful. But what's worse in my opinion is the degree to which the Democratic Party--a republican institution run by elites--colludes in absolutely everything.  Did u see Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi marching In the Streets?  It's all lives matter not black lives matter. üôÑ
Divisiveness is worse. But that's really just a continuation of the escalation of inequality which the Democratic party has colluded in equally.  Climate is worse. But Biden is very weak on that.  Judicial picks are bad, but when the Democratic party is back in charge
Undecided! What's left to decide? Where the stock market is on election day?  If she's still for Trump then she should say so. And if not, do the right thing by your family. By your country. Vote Biden/Harris and return the country to some sort of normality
You have to admit, it is nice to see so many Republicons actively campaigning for Biden/Harris!  Weird, but nice üòÇ
Bless your heart, no one expects you to give her a chance.   Your party has been absorbed by the Q nuts and grifters.   We, in the other hand, are looking forward to rational gun control, access to healthcare, and a functional government.   Why are y'all campaigning for Biden?
To be honest, most of their "attacks" have come off as actively campaigning for Biden/Harris.   "She'll undo Trump's tax breaks!" "She'll push for healthcare!" "Take away your God given right not to mask!"  Cool. Thanks, guys.
I‚Äôve been think about this as of late. After some conversations with  yesterday I‚Äôm even more convinced of my opinion. Biden is playing centrists to win. He is a centrist we have history no denying it. Like Obama‚Äôs *evolving*on marriage equality, he can move left.
I'm going to (angrily) vote for Biden but then we can all rally to try and get them to further protections for sex workers, trans women, etc
Sorry I don‚Äôt think I get what you‚Äôre saying. I understand you‚Äôre not voting for Biden/Harris. But are you saying something else?
5) But on only our 3rd day in execution, our team's new outreach strategy is succeeding! How so? Over the 3 days over this week so far, our numbers have actually inverted. We are now getting more Biden supporters than Trump supporters voting. I am THRILLED!
Military General throws his support behind Biden-Harris ticket  via   This man (General McCaffrey) is the real deal. I suspect we will continue to hear from him, and others.
Biden has done things that harmed the black community, and everyone is ready to forgive him because "he has learned his lesson." Kamala has did some things as a prosecutors (well intentioned) and has learned from it - but all the heat is for Kamala &amp; unc Joe is forgiven. Mysogeny
Biden/Harris ‚Äò20, Harris/Abrams ‚Äò24?
I get that Twitter isn‚Äôt the best place for nuanced discourse and I truly understand &amp; respect the numerous &amp; valuable critiques of Biden &amp; Harris. But to not pick even the slightly better option seems like leaning into nihilism. And is fundamentally a callous move, I think
Obviously everything is so fucked up in a myriad of ways but I still think politics is about harm reduction. All politicians lie and compromise etc. but I remain unconvinced that a Biden/Harris ticket would bring about the same chaos &amp; cruelty &amp; pure stupidity of the last 4 years
Right right. I‚Äôm just curious what not voting for Biden does. Like, do you see Trump as president and Biden as president as equal outcomes for poor people, uninsured people, etc. n
You either gonna vote for Trump, being a niggga and all or you‚Äôre gonna vote for Biden/Harris, being a nigga and all; you got your pick. Heavy on the being a nigga and all üòÇ. Just shut up and VOTE!!
Yeah, particularly when the whole political purchase of the Biden campaign is Obama restorationism.  If that fails, there's really nothing left.  (I don't think it will fail, but if it does...)
i will not be voting for joe biden
Kamala Harris is a literal fascist. Joe Biden has facilitated fascism and masqueraded it as bipartisanship. But sure, that‚Äôs just the silly stuff that makes them imperfect.
What happens if Trump ‚Äúwins‚Äù in November?  Pretty much everyone‚Äîincluding myself‚Äîis assuming a Biden victory, but it‚Äôs worth thinking through the absolute worst-case scenario.
Biden surged after Jim Clyburn endorsed him. I remember that because it's why I voted for him. I have no issue with Bernie or his supporters and was going to vote for him until that endorsement.
CNN Is Already Suggesting That Biden Could 'Step Aside' For Kamala Harris
I mean the primary where Joe Biden beat Bernie Sanders.  Did that not happen?
Awesome!   Not sure why you're actively campaigning for Biden/Harris.
Can't figure out why  keeps campaigning for Biden. It's sweet of them, but shouldn't they be trying to find a Republicon candidate?
Oh, Petal, stop campaigning for Biden/Harris!  Really, it's too much. You should concentrate on keeping the Great Naked Emperor out if jail.   Bless. Your. Heart.
Sorry, I must have missed the primary season where Biden won the most votes.
It's another to think that Joe Biden just isn't "inspiring" enough -- or whatever -- to win elections when there's a pretty clear track record of him being able to do that in the past six months.
It's one thing to think (correctly) that massive electoral chicanery could propel Trump to victory, and that the Biden campaign is not really prepared for that.  I think that's an eminently possible outcome.
I'm genuinely puzzled by the people who think that Biden and Harris are going to lose in November.
if you try to derail the conversation with ‚Äúbut trump is worse‚Äù on the subject of voting for joe Biden and cringemala Harris not even kidding it‚Äôs actually on sight like I will fucking beat the absolute shit out of you in the car park
Your two Democratic candidates have made their careers putting African American men in prison. So guess a vote for Biden and Harris is a vote for continued imprisonment of the black population. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Oh, Petal, bless your heart.   We've all seen Trump try to read.   The cool thing is that Biden can use his phone for more than tweets.   He even, zut alors, knows how the microphone works.   What will we ever do?
the NSGOP *likes* Kamala's transphobic drug-warrior record almost as much as they loved Biden's crime bill. why would they criticize policies they favor?
