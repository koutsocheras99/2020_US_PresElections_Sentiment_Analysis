Because I‚Äôm not willing to risk another four years of trump for a political statement. At this moment in time a third party bid is simply unfeasible. No matter who wins, the democrats will lose voters en masse after this election. They need to pay for their transgressions
Thanks to Trump's blind, ignorant leadership.
üòÇü§£ Joe Biden and the Democrats have never cared about building in America and buying American. I guess President Trump showed you the error of your China ways. Joe just wants to raise or taxes and ban guns. No thanks! #TrumpPence2020
A huge issue that deserves more media attention. Repetitive news coverage about covid, BLM, Trump, major league baseball, etc really getting on my nerves.
There are few decent Repubs but not many. GOP Senate owns Trump's destruction of the country - covid, Justice Dept, stoking racial hate, financial corruption, foreign policy disasters, humiliation/embarrassment of our country. What did I miss?
If people think Trump didn‚Äôt this üò°
The amount of outright horseshittery bubbling up from the far left,lately,is starting to out stink that of the far right's. Covid19 isnt kicking OUR asses. Nor is TRUMP,or any other obstacle out there. The biggest ENEMIES to the #UnitedStates right now,are the 2 political sides.
Why do Americans have to remind the world why Trump was elected

Trump is a stupid man's idea of a smart man, a provincial's idea of a cosmopolitan, a poor man's idea of a rich man, the idiot who looks but never sees, who is given information but can't synthesize, attracting gullible bootlickers of the world. #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpFailedAmerica

Christians,esp those who lean to the right,would do well to refamiliarize themselves with the sin of "PRIDE". You can not use the teachings of Jesus,to defend ppl like Donald Trump or Jerry Fallwell. It's a fool's errand,trying to,and only reveals a person who is confused,at best

Trump Interior Dept is dead set to make private profits via unsustainable plundering of Earth, our public lands. When  shits on  it is TrumpSwamp shitting on us all.
Poor Uncle Joe is just too old and is showing signs of dementia.  I hope the democrats will change directions and run a fiscally conservative democrat for president. This candidate would crush trump.
Yangs not wrong but this point exactly. Yang sold out too. Trump has destroyed what little idea was left of our country being a democracy. After 2020, I don‚Äôt see myself voting for the democrats again unless there is radical change within the party. Never republican again, either
IMHO, any Christian who believes solely on faith what Trump said about Biden and God today is violating at least two of the ten commandments and is tacitly accepting a false idol in place of God. The Word is clear that pretenders will come to fool the faithful for his own gain.
Did TicTok kill 158,000+ Americans in 5 months? I thought it was COVID.  Only a vain malignant narcissist who is afraid of what people online say about him would do what Trump did today when there are so many more-obvious dangers to American lives right now.

This is fine, but it's not that b/c Trump people won't get to see their grandkids for a few months - it's that, so far, 160k people will never see their grandkids again, ever (or their siblings, parents, or children)  And if Trump is reelected, that number will be larger.

He's talking about trump, right?
So let‚Äôs summarize this absurd argument using the facts. Virus spawns from Wuhan, China. Spreads to the rest of the globe with devastation causing a global pandemic and detriment to mankind. Your conclusion: TRUMP!! (Orange man bad). Yeah that ain‚Äôt gonna hold come November lol.
Neither. No one is happy about Trump officials using personal email. Some of us strongly support IGs, OGE, and external watchdogs like  who investigate and take action on these matters, and speak out ourselves.  Being anti-HRC doesn't mean someone is pro-Trump.
His war will never end. It will continue, unabated, forever.  Look to Joe Arpaio as an example of what Trump will do after he leaves office.
This is President Donald Trump‚Äôs Corona Virus plan.  Seriously.  This is his plan.
Honestly fuck the Democratic and Republican party‚Äôs that gave us a choice between Clinton and Trump.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
damn bro trump really out here killing mexicans
Trump touts fudged numbers as a success. It illustrates his failure.  The sooner the public withdraws their support, the sooner Congress can bypass him  But Republicans are cowards and would rather risk your life than admit they were wrong.  Fuck them. Protect yourself. #VoteBlue
Trump likes to talk about this pandemic in militaristic terms: He even said today that doctors and nurses were like soldiers running into battle.  I‚Äôll bite: that means they are ‚Äúprovid[ing] for the common defense.‚Äù
Many people predicted America under a Trump presidency would amplify authoritarian voices. Voices like the one Tom Cotton used in the NYT op-ed.  But it isn‚Äôt new. The assault has been in progress for decades. Reversal of American progress was already in motion when Trump came.
*and in a spectacular example of pure journalistic excellence, he brought items to the interview to debunk many of the expected talking points Trump uses, and they came in handy. Journalism textbooks should talk about this interview for generations.
Post-pandemic 2021 fantasies:  After Trump is indicted and convicted on money laundering and fraud charges, all of his hotels should be seized by state authorities and turned into public housing.
Remember: Trump is less popular now than he was on November 8th, 2016, and on that date it took a mere 70,000 people in three states to swing the electoral college his way. Don‚Äôt let your guard down, continue to resist, keep your efforts up, and we will defeat him.
Pro tip: When Trump says ‚ÄúMany people are saying‚Ä¶‚Äù but does not get specific about which people, he is about to lie to you. 100% of the time, what follows next from his lips will be a bald-faced lie.  proved that basic follow-up questions easily dismantle the lies.
The Trump administration is complicit in an attack on our election infrastructure and discourse because they know it is happening to help him win. Nevermind that this will irreparably damage American democracy and erode election confidence for a generation. Crickets from the GOP.

Trump should throw a party for everyone he retweets. It would be hysterical to see him trapped in a room with all these low-life people he would never associate with in his personal life.
No it‚Äôs not. We are PROUD of our President, or at least we should be. We needed someone like President Trump to finally put a foot down and take control of the corrupt deep state.

Next she'll blame her lack of sex with Barack on Trump when the truth is she is just to manly for his taste anymore.....!!
Stevens has not followed by anyone I‚Äôm following so I don‚Äôt see him as a conservative. That would explain his selection. No Mike Pence would not make a good president either we need a roaring lion like trump someone who will reach across the aisle and bitch slap a democrat.
trump only cares about the military when he can use them as a prop in his bid for more power. Individual soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines? He has no use for them.
And a man calling a woman a "nasty" name is very uncool. Actually, it is uncool for anyone to do it to anyone.  But let me guess, you are a Trump supporter, Am I close?

TDS is rather like telling an abused woman it's HER problem, not the guy smacking the crap out of her. Trump shows us exactly who he is, you are like those who imagine the emperor is wearing beautiful clothes. As for Jesus, he and I are on good terms, thank you.
And about Joe, you guys are the sick ones in your interpretations. Unlike Trump, it is not all about sex. He has a long history of compassion and caring, what this country needs right now.
But thank you for showing me how the Trump Christians were spinning his comments about the woman. That is a good one, he was just extending his Jesus like good will to all sinners. Yeah, right.
Oh plezzzz that is straight from the GOP playbook.  And Trump is a Christian? Really?  A man who has publicly claimed he does NOT believe in asking for forgiveness and won't.  He says ugly things about strong women all the time, but the woman who is a sex trafficker?

And I will add, YOUR president publicly gave good wishes to a woman who is at the center of a child sex ring. A woman who groomed children for sex. A woman who Trump partied with. So please, spare me your faux outrage.

First, Biden has been dealing with stuttering his entire life. Second, Trump supporters look utterly ridiculous and clueless when they post these types of Biden posts.
You people are ridiculous. Trump has broken several laws and nothing from the GOP. Barr is as corrupt as they come and nothing from the GOP. Yet you insist on beating a dead horse when it comes to anything Comey. Your priorities are totally screwed up!
Good observation, and it only took 20 years. Imagine how terrifying the next 20 years will be if we don‚Äôt keep Trump types in office.

This is disgraceful. It makes me ashamed to live in a State that would even consider voting for this racist criminal. Between Trump and Arpaio it's hard to tell which is the biggest racist üêñ! Unbelievable! What has become of America? Hatred &amp; racism has taken over.
Contrary to their claim,  clearly explains why Trump is correct in predicting voting by mail would be a train wreck.
(2) whenever asked what can be done by Congress to stop them there is NEVER an answer! I have 1 thing that might give them reason to pause. Defund the DOJ, and any project Trump wants money for. Congress controls the purse strings. Start holding back $$$.

I'm a contractor. Us contractors have always known Trump screws people over. Trump won the election on one thing.. "you're not voting for me, you're voting against her". He's doing it again
I‚Äôll say this. I‚Äôm a contractor. Us contractors have know about Trump screwing over contractors since 80‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt trust the guy. Only way he got votes to win is cause he gave people a choice that was deceiving. ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not voting for me, you‚Äôre voting against her‚Äù.. chew on that
Only part about Trump that‚Äôs not the same rules as any other President is that he called out on national tv for America‚Äôs long lived enemy, Russia, to find dirt on his opponent. That‚Äôs crossing the line! That‚Äôs practically asking an enemy nation to get involved in our election..

My only concern is a trump victory and a Republican Senate majority for four more years. In that time, he could destroy the Republic. Between now and January? You‚Äôre right, the odds are so small as to be unworthy of attention. Eye on the prize. Vote for Biden.
Just a spam of these accusations now. Too bad a Trump nomination had to be the popular event for this evil.   Had it been someone else perhaps good takes could have been had before solidifying some kind of listen and take as fact attitude.   How long until the humans shed this?

Trump is egotistical and should stay quiet much of the time, but his policies are on point to get people to work, can think freely and is a patriotic President, unlike the 8 years prior. I don‚Äôt care for Trump the person but I like his platform.

I called that as soon as the debates were scheduled. Biden can‚Äôt free think any longer. He‚Äôs a full blown dementia patient and his VP pick is who the Dems want as President. Biden would be a drooling idiot on any debate stage. He will NEVER debate, let alone debate Trump.

Should have used Trump‚Äôs line, ‚ÄúI take no responsibility.‚Äù In the ad. He takes no responsibility, becuz he shovels everything off to Jared to take the blame. Not just becuz he f*ks everything up.
Trump is no longer ‚Äòloved nor feared‚Äô ‚Äî he‚Äôs just become a ‚Äòjoke‚Äô: conservative -
WATCH: Trump‚Äôs repeated claims about ‚Äòhoaxes‚Äô thrown back in his face in new ad -  This is why he's horrible. If it's a hoax, he doesn't make anything better! Vote him out!
Kanye is a shill and diversion and being abused by tRump. Pathetic. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
As a Catholic supporter of President Trump I agree with him that Biden does not defend his faith by his actions He supports abortion euthanasia and Planned Parenthood against his faith
This article distresses me deeply Our bishops are appointed by the Vatican to teach us about our faith NOT to be shills for the Democratic party!
Does anyone remember Bishop Stowe reprimanding Obama for separating children from their parents at the American border? I don't either. The basis for him calling #Trump anti-pro-life
Who could possibly believe that Joe Biden doesn't believe in God or that Donald Trump does!
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez vs. St. Damien: The Deeper Issue -    How many American Catholic Democrat Bishops would have written this article?  Instead they promote pro-abortion Catholic Democrats and vilify Trump
Bishop Stowe accuses Trump of being "anti-pro-life" but says nothing at all about Biden being pro-abortion that is even more anti-pro-life Democrat bias?
Another failed rally sponsored by Trump
When it comes to military options, I'm VERY glad Trump is not predictable. Our President is not a "yes" man!
tRump is desperate. #LiarInChief  #GoJoe #VoteTrumpOut
Let's see what a Democrat psychologist ER doctor says about Trump's well-being!
It's another narcissistic injury, stuck in his craw.  He also has more posturing to do before November. And so it is, and so America just... blows my mind.   Trump Targets WeChat and TikTok, in Sharp Escalation With China
McConnell you old man...the dems are holding firm to give actual help to americans. But yeah...sit back in your mansion with a fridge full of food and tell us more how you know about struggle. You are a lier and suck up to trump.
WTF? Trump says, and so it is?  Trump signs executive order to ban TikTok, WeChat
You are so obsessed with Obama it's ridiculous! I believe it's also rude for you to say got Obama doesn't care about black lives. If your family loves you they will take you in for a full mental health evaluation. You are unwell Trump mentally unwell.
Trump, are you the false prophet

Never did like Trump.  But, that statement just killed any chance of a vote from me. Oh, waitaminnit, I wasn't gonna vote for him anyway! üòÑ
Untrue statement!  They Never had it snatched by Joe Biden, Trump already did this with his Ridiculous talk of "My Black Person'!
He doesn't want to win, he wants to help Trump win!
Ummm Alamo? Thighland yo semits....trump needs to go back to elementary school.
trump puts hiself and Russia fist. Biden puts America first. GOP have sold their souls to trump. Sad.
LoL! Trump can sure twist your nipples. He spins you off in every direction, out of control. Fun to watch you spin...
are they trying to get Trump 100% of the votes.
... going .... going ... GONE !     Trump says Biden disparaged, insulted Black community in latest interview |
I agree, responding to Trump is like fodder to him. If Biden wants to speak about his faith, it should be on his terms.
Trump is a Disgraceful and dishonest President and man.  Need i say more?
Such an Untrue statement!  Disgraceful that  would allow Trump to put this out!  They are just as Devious it seems!
I hope you are not going to make the decision to support Donald Trump. He will not get reelected because he's failed at being the President. Be smart and stay away from him. He will go to jail.
A Ridiculous untrue statement by Trump!
She was placed into her position By  .  She was in politics before this, but has always Voted with the Republican Party and Trump.
Between their Lies and their actions I'm dismayed.  Trump &amp; the Entire Republican Party need to be dismissed for the good of the country.  After they're gone they should start a better Part that actually has Morals and ethics.
Yes, Trump is dumping Our money into the Stock Market and the only problem is Not all of us have Stock!  The Rich get Richer!

Ouch. It is what it is. Trump is a psychopath. By his own mouth he has no compassion for people.In other news, trump will be issuing an EO ordering that it shall be light outside during daytime hours, and dark at night. Another EO coming down the pipeline, ice shall be, as the president called it, "cold".
And indictment, and conviction, and of course a trump pardon.

Being born into money doesn't make one cosmopolitan either. You are a racist too . Everytime Trump has said something racist you've retweeted or emphatically agreed with it.  And that's on the side of you actually hating minorities as well. Go back to jail.
Did you miss it when I said I'm not in line to vote for Biden or Trump?
And you tell me what point would it serve to write a book about Trump being a racist when he wasn't running for president in 1989?
You asked me to list the things he's said that was racist. In essence , you are no different than he is. So tired of this shit.
I'm not planning to vote for Biden but maybe you can tell me since you are a die hard Trump supporter why aftr I mailed off my daughters' and my mail in applications I started getting a mails from the Trump Administration offering me free accomodations to his rally for donations
What you need to do is wake up and understand that Trump isn't someone who loves minorities. He never has. You've even ignored the fact that he kept blacks from renting from him in 72. He has told people he'd never trust a black to count his money.
You probably don't think they're racist because you think the same way. Trump has called for 4 women of color to go back to their countries. 3 are from America and one came here as a child refugee from Somalia. That's racist.   In 72 he was sued for housing discrimination.
Exactly. At least we call him out. Trump says something racist and  turns his nose up like he didn't hear it I doesn't care.
If you had read the article instead of just the damned title ...  Also...I take issue with Biden saying "if you don't vote for me you ain't black" ... But you sit there talking about how Trump isn't a racist and people are making accusations against him up. Trump hates minorites
Trump has been racist and open about it for the past 50 years and you're acting as though he was just born and is perfect . You have issues . Your biases speak volumes.
Yep Biden said that bullshit and Trump around the same time was in deep shit for discrimination against black renters.  He told someone that he'd never let a black count his money.  But you keep telling uneven stories.
Ive already been banned! I made the same comment as someone else. Wanna know the difference? I support Trump and them Biden!
1.8millions jobs created DURING a pandemic, 9 million in a total of 3 months! someone tell me again how POTUS is ruining our economy? all i read are good things even during a pandemic! Trump did that! #trump2020

I CANNOT GET THE CRIES OF THAT CHILD SCREAMING FOR HER MOM OUT OF MY HEAD AND HEART...... there were 3 humans and a WOMAN (officers) who couldn‚Äôt help that poor baby??? Did Trump shrivel our hearts so much that we don‚Äôt have one anymore? Vampires is what we have become
Do you really think anyone but MAGA believe you? 160,000 dead. You should have removed Trump. Instead you enable him &amp; endanger our democracy. But then that's what you, the Koch's &amp; your Russian handlers have wanted all along. You truly are the Grim Reaper of  death &amp; sorrow.
This guy will soon be a high ranking official, either in the WH or the trump campaign. Replacing whoever quits/gets fired next.
The Marxist socialist Democrats I pulled out all the stops because they do not want President Trump elected for a second term the Deep State know there will be in deep trouble all the crooked cops in the FBI and politicians will be exposed that's why they're fighting so hard
He just didn‚Äôt want to meet up with Trump!
In 2016 NRA contributed $30M to Trump's campaign. They were a major player in his election. They &amp; Trump will visciously attack AG NY over civil suit to dissolve them. I suspect Trump will again incite violence claiming it's a move by Dems to strip 2A rights. Wish they'd waited.
That you're a troll. Trump is an immoral huckster who will say anything to be reelected. He'd never been in a church until he needed the Evangelical &amp; fundamentalist Christian vote. Just another smoke &amp; mirrors con. Ex: Didn't know books of bible &amp; photo op w bible inverted.

She‚Äôll complain about trump but it‚Äôs only because of how he treated her father, not his politics.   I think her mother has come out for Biden.
The ads are already on my nerves and  it‚Äôs only going to get worse. The trump ad with someone breaking into a house &amp; police message saying they aren‚Äôt coming is particularly offensive.  Biden has never called for defunding the police.
His comments convert the cost of the entire trip to taxpayer. He's saying it's part of presidential duties rather than campaign funded.  The level of Trump presidency corruption is unprecedented. #TrumpCrimeSyndicate
You so full of it you think trump even like him pr the republicans  there just using him you think they would even let it go as far as you people think it would  HES BEING USED I  to like him and Kim and her family but this is just bull they lost a fan and I will spread it
They won't care. Trump will tell MAGA it does.

156,000 deaths. More than Korea, Vietnam &amp; all middle east wars combined. And how much tax money did Trump spend on ineffective Hydroxychloroquine? So much that he 'donated' 2 million doses of useless COVID-19 drug to Brazil.
Like Trump hospitalizations &amp; deaths need to be evaluated on a per capita basis. What's not understood are long term costs of disease. But to me - I don't value life the way for profit insurers, providers &amp; government do. every one is precious.
Now would be the time for feds to step in. But they won't. Trump &amp; GOP want the virus to spread &amp; kill as only top 5% could possibly afford. The vaccination should be free to Americans just like polio 50+ years ago.

Of course, Zuckerberg's FaceBook is a Trump propaganda media outlet. They refuse to mark or delete Trump lies.
All reasons  shouldn't stoop to Trump's level. No need for debates. The debates lend credibility to him.
They know nothing that President Trump did wrong it was trying to find something they wasted three years millions of dollars and found nothing and then all the information right in front of them about the Obama Administration and all the dirty cops and did nothing
Exactly and President Trump's approval rating would be through the roof but that's if we had reporters that reported the news and not propaganda
We're all in for President Trump
Yeah we developed with our tax dollars they sell to other countries for a dollar a pill and make our pay $50 a pill stop all that and president Donald Trump will do it

In a few weeks look for a steep rise in cases, hospitalizations &amp; deaths. GOP governors don't care. They've adopted Trump's "It is what it is."
Trump who held the Bible upside down for a photo-op during a Trump induced violent attack on peaceful protestors is considered religious by Evangelicals. Christians waited 2,000 yrs for the second coming and then voted for the Anti-Christ.
they are silent because there is nothing to say! he was never there no proof. Trump actually kicked Epstein out and cut ties a while ago BEFORE Elsteins first conviction. all trhese other asshats WHO CONTROL MSM coverage have been seen there.
Philosophically, I would be open to a viable 3rd party candidate. Realistically, a trump win could mean the end of everything you've been talking about. Biden wasn't my first choice, nor 2nd or 3rd. But if he loses, trump wins. That's reality.
That's what she's depressed about Law &amp; Order is uncovering all the illegal thing still Obama administration have been doing they are so corrupt the Deep state is trying to cover for them when President Trump wins re-election it will all come out
If you see a moral equivalence between voting for trump and voting for Biden, then there's no point in any further discussion. If trump wins, it'll be because of people that think like you. And then it won't matter. Have a good day

This tells you how ignorant and incompetent Trump is, or pleading ü•∫ being a dummy..
How bout this? We're stuck with an asshole that has filled his admin with people dedicated to destroying the dept's they run Biden, if he is declining (he isn't), will be surrounded by people who know what they're doing A vote for anyone but Biden, or no vote, is a vote for trump
That's where the focus of the grand jury's and investigation should be on re President Trump alone he hasn't done anything wrong he's been fighting for America
Stein had policies but no integrity. She was applaided by Putin. So tear him apart. But  shouldn't give him credibility with  debates. But then Joe shouldn't debate the sociopath Trump either.
Discrediting Kanye as a Trump Trojan horse is worth exposing. The last thing we need is an inexperienced egotistical tv reality "star". This isn't The Apprentice.
Trump's Republican party sucks. Disliking Trump yet doing nothing to clean the entire GOP is cowardly.
I follow only to hear more spiteful dangerous lies &amp; the latest Trump apologist propaganda. #TrumpHasNoCredibility
Uses Trump excuse pattern as his not responding to Putin's bounty on American soldiers in Afghanistan.  He still hasn't acted. Cruelty and denial are the point.
Don't drop to Trump's level. Don't debate. There's no gain.  MAGA will never be converted despite Trump's obvious immoral character flaws, racism, bigotry, hate cult, purposeful cruelty, sociopathy &amp; incompetence. Listing &amp; showing Trump's faults are too long.
Absolutely. I've already tweeted as much tagging  Trump will lie &amp; bully as he did Hillary. Joe has more to lose than gain when debating a lying sociopath whose only skill is self promotion. Not a single Republican or MAGA Cult will be converted. #NoDebates #DontDoItJoe
There were hundreds more TRUMP flotilla boats on parade last weekend!
Good job Martha!  Keep up the good work!  If we can get back the house and keep Pres Trump maybe we can MAGA!  Trump just about had it done before the virus but he can do it again if we can give him enough good help (like you)!
I‚Äôve been here since 1999 and I‚Äôve seen more racism from that sherif and the former governor Brewer. Trump pardoned him. He‚Äôs a really bad guy. He‚Äôs also a criminal.  He‚Äôs got a base here because of his hate.
Who paid for those millions of doses? If so, did the purchase go through required purchasing process? Does Trump have a personal financial interest in the manufacturer? Who else does?
Trump 2020!
No need to apologize, Trump made 1,000 mistakes
They do not want to save lives that's why they're against it if President Trump had to mention that they would love that drug because you messed it there never trumper's they rather see Americans died and give President Trump a win
Which Trump, of course, repeated during presser. They want war. It's an effective Trump distraction from his  election fraud &amp; fits Putin narrative.
Trying to watch today's presser by Trump. It's sickening. One example: sales of used cars are up increasing their price is good for motor city. But hey, corona virus cases have stabilized in Miami. Ugh. I just can't. I'll wait for   &amp;  commentary.
The destruction of our country has always been the go of Trump &amp; GOP.
When are we going to storm WH? Trump's walling in the People's House needs to be challenged. And the Capitol GOP leadership offices as well.
Trump &amp; GOP are Fascists. We must overwhelm &amp; destroy them at the polls. Else our elections are now only for show.
need to put out ads of Trump efforts to gut Social Security &amp; Medicare. Ending these taxes will lead to shorterm funding shortfalls. GOP will steal our Earned Benefits many seniors rely upon. Appeal to financial insecurity.
No. It's a common 'notion' among Republican politicians who don't care about  devastation &amp; deaths. They should to look to the resurgence of Covid hotspots in other countries that opened schools too early. An example even Trump &amp; Kushner might believe is Israel's experience.
Yeah they've tried every other way so they had to go this route so sad that they would ruin the country just to try to ruin President Trump's chances of re-election
Trump is an embarrassment to this country
Sometimes I really think I am in an echo chamber, filling my social media feeds with like minded people. Then I read comments from Trump supporters and realize, I can't handle that much stupid in my life right now.
McConnell Barr and Trump in that order. Horrible human beings.
Exactly President Trump isn't a politician but he tells you how much he loves America all these politicians make excuses for America for what reason I do not know except to appease the dictators
Creepy Joe will never debate President Trump they won't let him
They will do every day make him not that have creepy Jo debate President Trump you'll see creepy Joe for what he is and they don't want that to happen go to get the Coronavirus stop it
OK - US has 4% of world's population and 25% of world's deaths - got it tRump?
Someone actually just replied to a comment I made and they said asymptomatic people cannot infect other people and that I should "stop spreading lies!" Lol!! For reference, their handle had Trump 2020.  Yep, that explains A LOT! üòÇ #Stupidity #Idiots #IgnoreScience
You are on fire! You are right on the money with Trump. Please continue to urge your younger followers to vote Biden.
You need to step up the pace if for some reason President Trump does not directed all this will be buried never see the light of day so everybody will got away with the all the dirty dealings of being a bad cop that lying to the fisa court
They don't care about that they want an election that's disruptive because they know President Trump is going to win by a landslide I may want a reason to cry foul
In President Trump second term I hope he has a spot for you to help drain the swamp
The never trumper's hate President Trump so bad they would rather have Americans die than get medicine
Yes indeed it's been safe for over 60 years show called medical professionals don't want you to take it and these so-called doctors of the fake news media because if it works it makes President Trump look good they don't want that they don't want you to get healthy
Let Trump, his entire family, cabinet, WH staff &amp; GOP lawmakers take it first. Better yet, add them to Stage 2 trials. Then infect them &amp; see what happens.
Counter Trump's lies by appealing to Americans' emotions We're all frightened of being sick &amp; poor with no income. Pivot to his plans to unilaterally gut (even eliminate) Soc Sec. &amp; Medicare. It will leave those 65+ destitute after paying in for their entire working lives.
Trump plans to use pandemic to unilaterally gut Soc Sec &amp; Medicare. GOP support him. 10s of millions rely on it for our retirement after paying into it for a lifetime.
This needs to be blasted across every network. Want Americans to reject Trump &amp; the entire GOP?  I've paid into Social Security &amp; Medicare my whole life. I need it. All older Americans do too.
While they're at it, how many GOP will be caught in the web.  I still wish NY hadn't given the Trump's a pass on their despicable Foundation fraud.  Shouldn't that also have been campaign financing fraud?
I think we should do the same thing to Trump supporters that Nazis did to Jews.
That‚Äôs a pathological liar for you. Trump falsifying data for his supporters..majority of us are well educated enough not to believe his BS..

That's why I don't find a reason not to debate President Trump
Yeah they talk like that to get elected and then they changed everything they do not hold their word President Trump when he says something he doesn't the Democrats give you lip service
And sadly so is Donald J Trump...some of us know who he really is Most don't
Trump doesn't want you to see his white hood.
Loved the TRUMP boat that passed in front of the SpaceX capsule splashdown!
That's why the Deep state is trying to check President Trump down he is for America and the American people not for the ruling class
There shouldn't be debates with Trump. He will lie, bully &amp; rely on blatantly racist remarks. There is no upside for Biden.
And look at the people Obama pardoned murderers pedophiles real criminals President Trump pardoned a couple people because the justice department treated them wrong with dirty cops and the doj set them up
The Marxist socialist Democrats want this to continue until the election they take it benefits them they don't care about the American public they would rather have our streets burn that have President Trump re-elected they are so sad Trump derangement syndrome
The Socialist Democrats all they want to do is penalized the American public make us hurt that you will turn on President Trump but we will not turn on our president he's trying to help us the Marxist socialist Democrats are trying to destroy America
Trump knows the higher the turnout, the worse he will lose. Simple as that. He's setting things up to say the election wasn't legit so he can refuse to leave. Fortunately, squatter's rights won't extend past 1/20/21.
Her choice. At any time she could &amp; should have spoken out. She never publicly intervened. Why did none of our taxpayer funded scientific &amp; medical experts speak out about crimes? Why not CDC or NIH? Instead they caved to Trump &amp; WH. What did McConnell &amp; GOP leadership know?
In a previous deposition, that young woman had stated she had seen trump at epstein's NY apartment, and that trump had flirted with her. She changed her story in the second deposition. She also stated that she was scared because there were a lot of powerful people invloved.
Since Trump wasn‚Äôt in politics back when he wouldn‚Äôt rent to black or brown people we have no quotes but plenty of litigation against him.
That‚Äôs what Trump is going to throw at people affected by the hurricane instead of paper towels.... cans of Goya beans
still not a word about these accusations on Bill Clinton. if it were Trump its all that would be trending!! your silence is deafening!!!!! #BillClintonIsAPedo  keep this tag trending! The Clintons are also HEAVILY involved with fucking Bidens campaign, contd
Ok bud when Trump is literally exposing everything. Y‚Äôall make no sense. Trump is the one stoping them.
Agreed. I'm not defending anyone that has done any of that kind of thing. He kept mentioning epstein, leaving trump out, and rolling clinton into that mess. Other than having spent time with epstein, no one has accused clinton. Victims have named epstein, maxwell, trump, etc
can't come even close to Trump's dark charisma and will get absolutely smashed in the suburbs, and the rust belt in general...hope he's the nomineeI can‚Äôt believe a man with no postal service is running the USPS and fired his experienced top people. Welcome to Donald Trump‚Äôs America- where anyone with bucks who can kiss Trump‚Äôs butt can do anything they‚Äôre not remotely qualified to do!
Clearly a Trump supporter.
Had a conversation with an obvious Trump supporter. She complained that people have to get back to work that the U.S. is not a socialist country. She then complained about the lack of affordable housing for low income/homeless people.
Fewer Trump voters come election time!!!
You are a disgrace to America, your family, the entertainment industry, and your race. There is enough unrest in our country without you pulling this crap. You deserve to be completely blackballed!
Hell yeah we are voting trump we need border wall in Arizona and deport all illegals!!
The real problem with Trump taking over the post office isn't their being able to deliver the ballots to the ballot box. It's whether they be delivered to the voters in the first place. Their goal is to keep ballots out of voters hands in the first place.
I‚Äôve never understood opposition to the wall. I get hating Trump. I get hating Republicans. But hating the wall is literally just embracing chaos and lawlessness.
I think he meant to say "supporters" of tRump...
And you have been waging an anti-Trump campaign for 4 years.
This thread is about the comparison of the Millions more in taxpayer money spent at Trump properties versus the amount he allegedly donates.   You keep bringing up stuff that has nothing to do with this thread, that's highjacking.

Voting For Trump Is Going To FEEL GOOD, 2020 Might Surprise EVERYONE  via
Boy! These people are so corrupt. Comey was right when he compared Trump to a Mafia don.
The Steele dossier and Mueller Report contain strong evidence of Trumps crimes. Trump is not innocent, he‚Äôs not vindicated, not exonerated. The case against Trump is not closed. Trump will be prosecuted for his crimes.
Yeah your typical western evangelicals are on some cult level shit when it comes to Trump. They defend all of his trangressions and still believe he was called by god to make America great.....for......them.
Only the Lord knows for sure but I have a strong hunch Trump will emerge victorious.
Bob Mueller did a great job investigating Trumps crimes and publishing his report. Trumps people secretly met with Russians 100 times and lied about it to the FBI and to Congress. Trump will be prosecuted for his criminal activity with the Russians.
Neither Biden or Trump. I vote on myself. I won‚Äôt rely on a white Supremacist to do a darn thing for me or my people.
The last thing we need is another politician ignoring a pandemic bc you‚Äôre excited that Trump paid attention to you. I lost my dad today bc you are weak and care more about yourself than our community. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre termed out. But that won‚Äôt bring my dad back.
witness tampering and other charges.  Trump will imprisoned for years and years for his crimes.
Sadly yes and the reasoning was it‚Äôs a better choice then Trump I asked in what ways.... cricket cricket ü§Ø
Trump has been money laundering for the Russians for years. Trump will face multiple counts of money laundering, racketeering, bank fraud, fraud, attempted fraud, tax fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to commit fraud, jury tampering ...

You people are so wierd they already are. And Trump loves communists leaders. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it. Trump loves commies but they are bad so let‚Äôs look away while he kisses their butt.
Trump used Rudy &amp; . Lev Parnas to do his dirty work in Ukraine. That‚Äôs racketeering. He twisted the Ukraine president‚Äôs arm to interfere in our election. That‚Äôs election fraud. He‚Äôll be prosecuted for multiple counts of racketeering and election fraud. He be imprisoned for years
These are the people Trump hangs with who give him advice &amp; seek favors. Biden hangs out with Americans who are actually struggling: workers, teachers, nurses, small business owners, factory workers, farmers, postal workers, vets.
Trump really is just killing democracy faster than an foreign enemy.
Trump should know this.  Is he suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment?
Please pray for the millions of Americans who had their unemployment cut by 70% because  didn‚Äôt do her job. Very soon we won‚Äôt be able to feed our children, pay our bills, and keep our houses. Meanwhile Trump is golfing
I agree!   I  was invited to a Christmas party at the White House and  took a rain check for 7 years until some other President was there. The night President Trump was ellected, I called my daughter to clame my rain check.  and I had the best time in my life.
Trump teases order requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions - He must be suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment.
While we clutch our pearls, trump continues doing what he does best. ‚ÄúMerchandising ‚Äú( must be said with Mel Brooks voice).  And cheating. There is NO substance, anywhere.  Ever.   (But substance is apparently irrelevant in a post-truth world.)
The Dems siding with Trump again!
That's a lot of taxpayer money being spent at Trump properties, that he profits from.   Trump takes lots of breaks and lots of vacations, the point of the entire thread was that he is making more than he is donating.

You sure point fingers at Trump but I'm still waiting to see what you will promise to do if elected for the next 4 years??? You have already had 36 years in politics and 8 years as VP. So if you didn't do much so those years, why would I elect you to do nothing next 4?
Nah. Leadership was President Obama doing it TEN YEARS ago. The opposite of leadership is Trump suing in court to eliminate the pre-existing conditions clause in Obamacare.
They know trump supporters are that stupid. That‚Äôs who this is directed at, which is kinda silly since trump already has their votes. Maybe they‚Äôll capture a few more dummy‚Äôs though.

Right on. It's about time Trump is held accountable.
They know. They're counting on tRump supporters to be their usual idiotic selves and believe the bs.

What Country would want to make a deal when Trump has proven he‚Äôll reneg on a deal in a heartbeat?
As trump stated in a press conference the will be tax cuts, continued eviction ban, unemployment enhancement and the second round 1200 stimulus checks.
Another update in political news: NO deal was made by today (the dead line) between the democratics and republicans and now Trump is issuing an executive order for the stimulus packages.

They're both right.  Republicans who still hold onto the possibility of unrigged elections are worried.  Republicans who are comforted by knowing that every stop is being pulled to ensure a Trump victory (or continuation of power) aren't worried.
The Trump family are corrupt, unfeeling &amp; care nothing about the USA, our planet, or animals.  His two sons have killed tons of them. Not in the wild though. They paid BIG MONEY to kill them in a fenced in "hunting preserve" where they had no chance.
I would get in line right now and wait in line until November 3rd to vote against Trump.
I just love this country. Trump has actively tried to get rid of Obamacare... Which requires insurances cover people with preexisting conditions. Now he is taking credit for something aleady happening, that's he's trying to get rid of.

Yes, it is ordained.  predicted way before he announce he was running that Trump would win two terms. Kim Clement is the real deal.
Thank you  .  Trump will shutdown the USPS or slow delivery to a crawl in October to frustrate mail ballots.  Or the ballots will simply "disappear."
# 1 President Trump has cut 8 and a half regulations for every new rule. Regulatory costs have been slashed by nearly $50 billion &amp; have saved taxpayers $220 billion once actions are implemented. The deregulation efforts will save American households an estimated $3,100 per year.

Lol ikr, but I was never a fan of the Patriot Act.  Btw, where is this coming from that a company run by the Trump campaign used PII to influence the election? This is proved?   shouldn't that tweet be removed as misinformation according to your own policies?
Trump still has his witts about him. They‚Äôre gonna have to give Biden the debate questions in advance like they did Hillary.
It wasn't China who ignored a pandemic, lied about it, called it a hoax, and did nothing about it for political reasons. It wasn't China who won't help the people with an adequate stimulus plan. It isn't China who won't do a rent and eviction freeze.  This is all on Trump.
Daniel, I love your reports on Trump, but can you PLEASE emphasize that he can't legislate by Executive Order? This stuff is Dead on Arrival if challenges are filed in court because the EO usurps the legislative function. Trump is using EOs as a dictator.

Biden has committed to selecting a woman as his rm. Looks to be between Kamala and Susan Rice. Either of them against Trump would be a massive improvement for Dems, particularly considering the current social climate.
I will not (and did not) vote for Trump. Biden, however, is not fit to lead. His recent racist gaffe and every other senseless, incoherent thing he says is evidence. He's 77. How can we possibly take his candidacy seriously?  Then a thought occurred to me.
Informed Christians will vote for Trump. We don't want a theocracy. We just want our freedoms and Trump's policies are doing just that.

You're assuming, again, that Trump gets removed from office.  That's a *very* big assumption to make.
He taught his kids the same criminal activity his father taught him. They've gotten away with it because no one has ever looked into it.  If Trump under valued property to pay less taxes, they did as well. If he overvalued to get loans, so did they.  It's a family crime syndicate
No.... Trump fucked kids with Epstein closer to home.  In Palm Beach and NYC.  Why would I care if Dems are guilty, too?  They should all swing, along with Trump.

My former state, Illinois, has been in thrall to the Union-pension trap; Trump taking away their ability to have all of us pay (due to former deductibility of state/local taxes) exposed this. No reg politician could get that done. Bravo.
Would Democrats sue the President in order to reverse an executive order to extend  unemployment benefits in the middle of a pandemic?
Do you really think that'll be prevented by Trump having a second term, though?

Fine, but if your other response you were referring to actually answered my question in that tweet, I didn't see it.  I didn't "diagnose" Biden, while you DID post a diagnosis of psychiatric and other mental disorders Trump supposedly has.  The thread MUST be about Trump-bashing.

No wonder he was never upset about Trump!
We are giving China a slow death by thousand cuts. Excellent strategy that can minimize our cost of war against the evil! Trump is our modern time dragon slayer!

Agreed he‚Äôs just as bad as Trump, besties with the Russians. #MitchMustGo
Because BLM had nothing to do with the number of tests available, the length of time we are still waiting for results or the fact that masks weren‚Äôt mandatory from the beginning. Many in BLM wore mask - not so at Trump‚Äôs rally.
You're illustrating my point with that question.  YOU brought up Mary Trump in response to something irrelevant, then ducked my question about why you brought her up. You strawman every comment about Biden into a Trump endorsement, and try to re-frame the thread for your benefit.
I don‚Äôt disagree. I think part of what endears Trump to his supporters is his casual, politically incorrect nature. My point is simply that there‚Äôs a huge difference between misspeaking &amp; being deceitful. But regardless of what the standard is it has to be applied evenly.
Trump is responsible for the death of 160,000 Americans. Trump should be prosecuted for murder.
The advice to Trump on how to fix it plus the words of praise for Haley and Pence definitely led me to think this was an effort to help him. Yes.

I have a Parler account Sharon but to me it's dead over there ... and it's like preaching to the choir. Independents I'm trying to sway to Trump here...a Lib likely won't ever happen.
Actually I don't like Trump either lol try again
Yeah cause Trump made it better. You‚Äôre party is trying to destroy all of that.
Like everything else I guess  Trump turned opening schools political. But of course it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs about safety and nothing more. I can‚Äôt imagine after is political. They are kids and teachers and staff and when we know it is safe they go back. Why is that an issue
Again, you keep talking about diagnoses and disqualifications, which is all strawmanning. The "whataboutism" is on YOUR side, trying to exempt Biden from any scrutiny because he deserves coronation simply for Not Being Trump.  Millions won't ignore the elephant in the room, dude.
It is possible, Trump and family, and cronies are making money off of all of the hospitalizations occurring from the COVID-19 pandemic. In my opinion, that could be one reason why Trump and the Republicans have not come up with a national strategy to stop the pandemic. Money.
Imagine being so ignorant, and stupid that you think this is about Trump. It's about my country, Trump is just the person in charge right now.
He is as heartless as Trump
Please Read:
Gov. Cuomo, come fix Arizona.  Trump lies. Arizona is a hot spot. Our governor fought mayors over masks. He did not want masks.
What does that even mean?  You left the vast majority of your Twitter 280 unused in the process of posting a three-word tweet that is ambiguous at best.  Can you do ANYTHING besides bitch about Trump?
plus all preexisting conditions covered, which was dems central talking point for 3 years.
Says the Trump lackey who made Arizona a top pandemic spectacle from his lack of leadership when it counted. Come on Ducey, get out of the 8th floor and smell the wilting roses of our discontent.

I don't know why I'm playing dumb here. Donald Trump could roll out a verbatim copy of the Affordable Care Act and most of his supporters would gobble it up. A damned conservative think tank came up with the broad strokes of the thing.

KEEP TRUMP OUT
Trump loves Thigh land
I am convinced that the #Democrats plan has always been to inflict as much death, economic pain and chaos as is humanly possible, all in a singular attempt to defeat #Trump.
Yeah #Obama did that. First thing Obama did that #trump didn‚Äôt kill. Oh wait. He has been in court for 3+ years to kill #ACA which protects pre-existing conditions. #idiots.  I await your scathing response with baited breath üòÄ
Yep, and Trump is going to weaponize that report that came out tonight: ‚ÄúChina wants Biden, China wants Biden!‚Äù.
Definitely not, it's actually far worse. Start with over 160,000 dead due to Trump's inaction. Huge Federal debt, escalating crime against racial minorities, massive unemployment and reduced living conditions are just part of Trump's legacy
Is she Trump's personal physician, or even a physician at all?  What's your point in bringing her up, apart from a "sling all the mud you can at the wall, and hope some of it sticks" tactic as part of trying to divert every discussion into a referendum on Trump personally?
I wish people would stop telling me to vote for Biden just because they don't want Trump to win, that's not going to make me want to vote for the 1st time. I get it but Biden really ain't shit either
so wait Trump's press conference was to announce that he's signing an executive order to guarantee something that the affordable care act already guarantees? what?
Anyone who claims they are against the Left and doesn't vote for Trump, they themselves are on the left.
No vaccine with my name on it. Trusting God's plan.

(2) And it's absolutely arbitrary and self-serving to re-write rules of medical ethics about long-distance diagnoses of non-patients based only on media observations because "Trump has enablers" (as if Biden DOESN'T! üôÑ).  That doctor -- if indeed he is one -- should know better.

do some FAIR reporting and see what happens. All you so called journalists do is ask gotcha questions. Haven‚Äôt you guys learned by now President Trump is just way to smart for all that bullshit?
If President Trump leaves Twitter so do I.
Again, you keep saying "diagnosis" when I offered none, but YOU offered an irrelevant one on Trump from someone who never personally examined him as a patient.  My point was that Biden concluded his remarks, evidently satisfied with a statement even you admit was incoherent.
Sinema &amp; Stanton are Repub lite &amp; McSally is a Trump ass kisser. And all 3 love the Military Industrial Complex! It's big $ over here in AZ.
I didn't hate Obama. I strongly disagreed with everything he stands for.  The Left? They HATE Trump. They Hate him.   Trump was elected by a little more than a quarter of eligible voters.  Assuming half eligible voters are Republican WE NEED TO DO A LOT BETTER in November.
cant help his Sheriff buddy  .. loses re-election bid .. Trump is on a losing streak
He just had his head inflated by the trump admin. Don‚Äôt you know he‚Äôs a model governor now?! Lmaoooo üòÇ

You work for this guy?
Looks like we have Kanye Trump or maybe Donald West (aka  ) oooh, I like donald west, running for prez in wisconsin! What a bunch of crap.
Exactly. Cooper feigns concern and like you said, is trying to pin it on Trump.
Should he hold campaign events that get people killed instead like Trump does? Herman Cain is dead. Don't know if you heard that, John.
You're obviously a Romanian troll for Trump so this conversation is over. Again, have a lovely evening.
You wanted the states to handle it so they did. Don‚Äôt blame trump for 160k dead
So many of you hate Trump because you say he is racist but this clown gets a pass? If we are being honest I have seen far more racist words and actions from Joe. C'mon man Biden
Trump says he may take executive action on evictions, student loans, payroll taxes if no aid agreement reached
I accidentally bought one that said something about Trump on it but I can't find the packaging right now
Legal challenges to come.... But Trump doesn't care since it's just a campaign thing

‚Äúare poorer, less educated, and many have not left their home states‚Äù is a spot on description of Trump supporters.
Trump is simply simple and pathetic.
LOL The Affordable Care Act already requires insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration is currently arguing in a case before the Supreme Court to strike down that very law ‚Äî including its pre-existing condition protections.
How does everybody not see that Trump wants to ban tick-tock because he can now use China as a scapegoat when he loses the election and blames the election interference on China. It's all smoke and mirrors and a big game to him
Really? How so. Trump is the President for 3.5 years and the debt exploded, unemployment doubled, 160k people died from a pandemic, the most deaths in the world by far. He's a con.  #Biden2020  #CountryOverParty
Yeah, I wouldn't believe Trump even if he told me it was raining while he was standing outside in a hurricane!
Exactly Trump is a disgusting person.
Trump is corrupt. Calling his event at his Bedminster Golf Club a ‚ÄòPress Conference‚Äô so the event would be paid by the American taxpayer when he knew it was a campaign rally. #DonTheCon
I think you missed a trump rally.Had a conversation with an obvious Trump supporter. She complained that people have to get back to work that the U.S. is not a socialist country. She then complained about the lack of affordable housing for low income/homeless people.
And you have been waging an anti-Trump campaign for 4 years.
The Steele dossier and Mueller Report contain strong evidence of Trumps crimes. Trump is not innocent, he‚Äôs not vindicated, not exonerated. The case against Trump is not closed. Trump will be prosecuted for his crimes.
Bob Mueller did a great job investigating Trumps crimes and publishing his report. Trumps people secretly met with Russians 100 times and lied about it to the FBI and to Congress. Trump will be prosecuted for his criminal activity with the Russians.
witness tampering and other charges.  Trump will imprisoned for years and years for his crimes.
Trump has been money laundering for the Russians for years. Trump will face multiple counts of money laundering, racketeering, bank fraud, fraud, attempted fraud, tax fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to commit fraud, jury tampering ...
Trump used Rudy &amp; . Lev Parnas to do his dirty work in Ukraine. That‚Äôs racketeering. He twisted the Ukraine president‚Äôs arm to interfere in our election. That‚Äôs election fraud. He‚Äôll be prosecuted for multiple counts of racketeering and election fraud. He be imprisoned for years
The Dems siding with Trump again!
Yes. Fact is, the constituency that elected Trump is still behind him, and it has grown. The media polls are designed to discourage that constituency, but we‚Äôre still fired up.
Trump failure. Repubs fail to agree on a plan. Americans are dying and out of work. The DEMS HAVE A PLAN. The Dems have unified bill and aporoach to help people. The Repubs REFUSE the bill.  The US is approaching 5 million coronavirus cases
The Repubs in the Senate are a mess. The Dems have a strong plan and a bill to help Americans. The Repubs refuse to help people. Period.Trump copies Obama.Repub party has disappeared.   Trump lays out planned executive orders after stimulus talks fail
Amazon has nothing to do with it, Trump is jealous of Bazos end of story. Why he put one of his people in I‚Äôm not sure but I bet we‚Äôll find out.
So this may be where we all ask, is it actually Microsoft that‚Äôs the driving force behind the ban and possible subsequent forced sale of #TikTok, and trump is the enabler/puppet?
You sure point fingers at Trump but I'm still waiting to see what you will promise to do if elected for the next 4 years??? You have already had 36 years in politics and 8 years as VP. So if you didn't do much so those years, why would I elect you to do nothing next 4?
I heard Thighland was against Trump winning the election.
üåçüåçTrump is one TOUGH ....? ! He has proved his grit and not wavered.  Politics is almost impossible not to get sucked into,...Trump has proven, he is the real deal when he speaks
I‚Äôm sorry but you chose to lose your freedom when you voted for #Trump. #PutinOwnsTrump
And btw, I have a student loan and got the notification when he suspended it earlier... payments and interest accrual are paused. Schumer was full of sh*t when he said we‚Äôd all end up owing more. It‚Äôs literally paused. Trump will extend that pause.
i would call myself a republican, and i used to not like you because you were a democrat, but the more i saw the way trump acts, and the more i heard you talk, i became more of a fan, make no mistake, i cant agree with you on stuff, but i hope you can get us out of this mess
So true David. And now they have the Tea Party guy Mark Meadows and Munichin doing the negotiating? The Repub Senators are in disarray.  They have no plan they can agree on. They are handing this to  trump.
Omg. Now trump suggests ideas that already exist in the Affordable Care Act and acts like these are new ideas????  "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wait. You guys dragged Obama for this when the ACA was passed. Now you‚Äôre praising Trump for it after it‚Äôs already law? WTAF?! Is the right going to Trump too now that he ‚Äúsupports‚Äù this? Doubt that
i don‚Äôt care if trump is a dickhead there are literal CHILDREN being SACRIFICED I WOULD RATHER HAVE A DICKHEAD FOR PRESIDENT THAN A RAPIST SATANIC PEDOPHILE
Do you really think that Americans are that naive and gullible to accept all the lies that team Trump spin? It seems to get worse and more outrageous as the election looms closer. All Americans must stand together and end this nightmare.
how is it that People hate Trump so bad that they are blinded by it, that they don't see Biden can't even breath a fully coherent sentence. This makes Biden more dangerous. Either way, if he wins or not won't change anything, it won't make bad people good again or stop violence
Are you serious? We have had protections for pre existing conditions since Obama. Trump is currently in court trying to strip them away.
Can we allow this?
Trump administration crooked without a conscience!!! They lie and break the laws in plain view!!!
Will the payroll tax cuts and trump‚Äôs executive orders move the needle at all in the polls and more importantly with helping workers and consumers?
Oh you fixed it so Trump can‚Äôt win! You are a genius...
Look at the date!! Again Trump shows his stupidity!!!
Alexa, define the Trump administration in 22 words.
If he was doing it the right way, he'd request legislation through Congress, instead of acting like a dictator and issuing an Executive Order. By the way, we already have this, it's called ACA and Trump hates it.

We work on Sundays now because of Amazon, why do you think trump wants to charge them more.
I mean trump barely does any of those, so it won't change much, but hope he'll bring back journalists and press-briefings to the WH if he wins
Trump loves using his position to punish Democrat cities and states. He only cares about himself and people who kiss his ass.

I‚Äôm a Latino from Arizona. What Biden meant is that Latinos need to get their shit together and vote their self interest like 90% of black people do! Way too many Latinos vote Republican even though Trump and most of the GOP see us as lesser people.
Lady G. never fails to suck up to a moron. Trump must have a lot of dirt on Lady G. Lady G. sold her soul. John McCain would slap the shit out of you.

You're assuming, again, that Trump gets removed from office.  That's a *very* big assumption to make.

Get your head out of the sand! YOU did nothing but leave decisions about mask use and social distancing guidelines to the city mayors and school districts. YOU deflected. YOU are unfit to lead &amp; the fact Trump praised YOUR efforts, frankly, is laughable!
Lady G. better hope that trump will hire you as a caddy next year. In November you are going down but I guess that you‚Äôre used to that.
Trump is just crazy!!
No preference but I love the new Sam Elliot adds for Trump.
Just more tiresome insanity from the Trump GOP!
‚ÄúDonald Trump Says ‚ÄòA Lot Of People‚Äô Have Thanked Him For Fixing Their Showers‚Äù - WTF? üôÑ

‚ÄúYou cannot do evil that good may come‚Äú is the first rule of morality. Voting for Trump is evil. Consider his personal vices, criminality , racism, cruelty and penchant for dictators. He is a demagogue. Biden is patriotic family man who obeys laws.
Nope I‚Äôm not. I will pray for our victims. Obama said he would change America. But Clinton got to the ball rolling. I‚Äôm not sure that GW or Trump are paying members to the club. I need proof.

I know this is beyond your comprehension Doug. Trump flu doesnt care if people cheer it on or not. What an idiot. There is no requirements about a Governor having any intelligence just any moron like Ducey will do?
Trump did no such thing. He inherited a strong economy from Obama.   Suspension of the payroll tax will not boost the economy. Over 60% of benefit goes to top 20% of wage earners. It does NOTHING for those w/o jobs, and it causes revenue shortfall for Social Security &amp; Medicare.

1. You are a bad person 2. Despite the decisions they made, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre justified.   You‚Äôre doing the same crap Trump does: justifying your terrible actions by pointing out the terrible actions of others.   Your days of comfort with 0 accountability are over.
Certainly  and  have the right to criticize  but shouldn‚Äôt they show this presser with trump talking about cutting payroll taxes, extending unemployment benefits, eviction protections and student loan deferments. Shouldn‚Äôt they show some of it?
Yes. I understand. My best background is documentaries.  Friday's are popular for Trump to dump major things to try to control the weekend narrative.  Turns out, seems he just wanted to flex and get some attention.
So DINO who's running against Mitch McConnell is using Trump talking pts! Dems are totally Repubs now!

I watched a  coronavirus commercial on Wednesday with my brother, and you know what? They said to social distance and stay away from crowds and wash your hands, but what was missing? NO PLEA TO WEAR MASKS. This is what Donald Trump has done.
You actually have absolutely no way of knowing this.  But we do know how disastrous Trump has been.
Listen, I know you‚Äôve got a huge lady boner because trump liked one of your tweets or something but your tweets are incongruous with the degree you say you have.

trump is more corrupt and more desperate each day. Twisted man knows he can't win in a fair election so he's trying dirty deals with foreign powers. It's time to get this garbage out of the WH.
Bunch of lies from Trump a pathological liar
Trump is the only president that has ever divided this country as much as he has   He is a president that doesn‚Äôt represent all the people just his chosen republicans and the rest of can just suffer. He has to go now. Worst president ever worst human being ever

Trump is not going down alone. He will take you down with him.

I am a former police officer and believe this is a dangerous, partisan move to line up behind the discord that trump is stirring around the election. This is a DANGEROUS and terrible idea.
Trump failed to protect Americans from COVID.  Trump is responsible for 150,000 + deaths. He should be prosecuted. You share in the blame for supporting his bad policy. There will be a reckoning during the Biden administration. Trump, you, and others will be held accountable.
Team Biden, the cheating and corruption is starting from  trump &amp; co. We need to be strong, unified and focused. They will NOT take this election by cheating. Guiliani has an evil streak in him. We will hold our ground. This is still OUR democracy.
And Trump told Pompeo: ‚ÄúI had a long and very good conversation with President Putin of Russia and he strongly denied he had any Bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

Trump has never been able to understand that the buck stops on his desk. No amount of pointing fingers or deflection can change that fact. He will go down in history as the halfassed President that lead with half measures
Was thinking about hitting the post office today.  Then I thought, Oh no, maybe I shouldn't on Friday.  What if my stuff sits all weekend somewhere? Wait until Monday?  Then I was sad.  With Trump's  destroyer in place,  I'm losing trust in something I have always trusted.
And then count the times tRump has acknowledged and learned from his "missteps."
No one should be surprised that a package of executives orders are waiting for signature. Meadows job assignment was to stall the negotiations, so Trump could pass his orders that have been the making several weeks. Underhanded GOP political trick to benefit Trumps election.
What‚Äôs amazing to me is that shit is so open now that Kanye can admit supporting tRump openly just to draw votes away from Biden.

Ok, if you look at what Biden is saying what he would do for the pandemic It aligns very close to what Trump is doing or has done. So why is Biden loved for his ideas and Trump is torn down for the same ideas?

STOP with the partisan politics Mr Ducey. 4000+ new cases in Arizona in the last 5 days. It's time to start caring more about the people you represent and less time caring about pleasing Trump or attacking Biden.
This makes a lot of sense! Psychologist John Gartner: Trump is a "sexual sadist" who is "actively engaging in sabotage" |
No mainly because of the person he was before his decline. He has been a dispictable person who has never cared for anyone except Trump. I do have empathy for our country having to deal with it now.

Get your nose out of Trump's ass, Doug:  The majority of these "accomplishments" were primarily thanks to local leadership response to your bumbling efforts, ranging from "spineless and ineffectual" to "didn't accomplish jack shit" and "actively dangerous to the general public."
He‚Äôs just gonna make this easier for Trump by the day with comments like that.
I'm getting a lot of patriot notices that they are cautioned and not to follow I noticed are all Trump followers to don't understand it twatter is ran by Nazi communist people wanting to control a freedom of speech.
And enough worshiping at Trump‚Äôs feet. He‚Äôs made a mess of this, and so have you, because you caved as soon as he came to town and threw out the ‚Äúmeasured reopening‚Äù plan. Numbers of tests going DOWN. Schools still not safe. Now what?
The one true thing Donald Trump ever said: if he shot a random passerby on 5th Ave, tools like Biggs would bend over backward to blame the victim. Science &amp; evidence mean nothing to this idiot. #AZ05 deserves a rep with a brain &amp; a heart. #HireJoan
You just have to love AG Barr !! he is knowledgeable, long suffering, intelligent, genuine, and President Trump seems to like him. KAG TRUMP 2020
This tactic wont work.  Biden is clearly demented.  Trump is a lot of things, but there's not much of a comparison.
Unless the commentators actually ask policy questions. Trump has never had policies and has no clue of any that are planned. Biden has many and knows every detail. But if commentators encourage a shot show, Trump always delivers.
Remember kids when Biden (or any Democrat) ‚Äúslips up‚Äù like this it is an ‚Äúhonest mistake‚Äù. Trump does it: ‚Äúevil‚Äù, ‚Äúracist‚Äù, ‚Äúhateful‚Äù ‚ÄúHitler‚Äù, ‚Äúeveryone must Vote Blue in November...‚Äù
Do you have a point? If not go back to drinking the Koolaide that Trump says will cure Covid.
Did you tell the President we were doing good until you rushed our opening so he would come visit? That YOU made it political. That all the deaths since could have been avoided with a slower opening. Everything in Arizona lies at the feet of you and Trump.
This assessment is incredible. It literally lacks credibility. Any claim that undermining the US=opposing Trump is a heavily political statement (which also ignores reality).

Yes, the same Democrats who had a bill ready to be approved by the Republican Senate months ago, a bill that McConnell allowed to just sit there while everyone took vacations, and then just expire. Same bill that trump wanted to contain money for WH improvements. Those Democrats.

S. Rice bad pick and T. Kane all over again.  Does not really help Biden and certainly not with progressives.  Son big Trump supporter.  Connections with Clintons hurts. Biden is connection with Obamas. Fine choice for Sec. of State, not VP.
Unfortunately I'm sure the Trump Org and other real estate emprires will figure out a way to benefit from that idea (which has merit) in a HUGE way.
The article states that the funds given to the national stockpile were used on life saving drugs instead of N-95 masks because masks are usually more readily available. It also says the Trump administration received requests also, in the 3 years before the covid outbreak.

You‚Äôre delusional. Since 2016 there is *no way* Trump has gained voters and he lost the popular to Hilary then already.  Any real conservative would be looking at the polls and very scared of Trump as a candidate if you don‚Äôt want the Dems to take 2020.

Another lying fool. Doug and cara watched thousands die. Finally mayors have helped save us. Meanwhile. I used to respect republicans. Now you are the model. Lying sociopathic fool. Trump Ducey Abbot DeSantis. Lying murdering incompetent scum.
It appears to be just like that.        I hope Trump wins by chasing the snakes away

Could you provide examples of how/when Trump has shown himself to be a Christian? And I don't mean him pandering to Christians like you, but ACTUALLY acting like one...
Holding a bible upside down. He was asked, ‚ÄúIs that your Bible?‚Äù Trump said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bible.‚Äù  Trump bible Version 666.  Once he was asked, ‚ÄúAre you a fan of the Old Testament or New Testament,‚Äù He said, ‚Äúprobably  equal. I think it‚Äôs incredible, the whole Bible is incredible.‚Äù

The economy that Trump built is suffering from an all out attack by democrats who are willing to trash the country in a last ditch effort to change the trajectory of the 2020 election. This too will fail.
The jobs lost were due to a Democrat overreaction to an illness with a lower mortality rate than the seasonal flu.  The jobs they lost were the ones you sent overseas, Obama said were never coming back and Trump incentivized to return so stop lying.
New York, with nearly 3 times the population, is under 1000 cases per day and a positivity rate of 1%. That's what happens when you don't endanger your citizens for political expediency to satisfy Trump. BTW, you're not getting a cabinet appointment.

LOL. NO. Not true.
When Joe Biden often makes gaffes, he at least has the audacity to apologize. For that reason, I let them slide. When does Donald Trump ever apologize for his gaffes, frequently insensitive (to put it nicely) remarks, unprofessional statements, etc.?
Pres. Trump has been very philanthropic in his life and his wife encourages him to be better every day. She is the reason for his current stance of helping others and prolife. Best look at the whole picture. Biden is not know for his philanthropy just his time in politics.

Oh now he speaks out because he‚Äôs going to try and help Trump the liar win an election??  I mean we all knew this is what was important to you Doug but you‚Äôve let thousands of people die so he would allow you in. You should be ashamed of yourself, Doug! #DonsNextCon

Not really. In Trump's version the coverage may be guaranteed, but there's no limit on how much they can charge the patient for the services. Under the ACA, someone with a preexisting condition has to be charged the same for insurance and services as someone without a PEC.
Trump is a walking punchline.

Nobody is rooting for the virus! You and Trump seem to be doing the best you can to get us killed.

You mean the Trump Flu, right?
Uh, trump?
Actually, since Trump has committed bank robbery and would like to continuously commit bank robbery without penalty, he'd more likely remove it from being a crime at all.
Wrong, us mere humans cannot control virus. What could be done is let the people have access to hydroxychloroquine, and for that I do blame Trump for not standing  up to big pharma.
Damn right. And we would take a Kasich-Sanders ticket over Trump every time.  No rational, intelligent person could possibly still support Trump.
Nah, ACA already does that as trump's team is in court trying to dismantle it. So what's the replacement?
Good, let the people see first hand the great things Trump is doing. The fake news surely isn't covering it honestly.
He did influence it, and he pays fair wages to legal citizens.   Must suck to be you burning up with hate and envy over  a decent President  Like Donald Trump.

Hey hater, you don't need to follow Trump, but he is your leader, so I understand.   Trumps taxes  are not required for him to hold the position, but Obamas birth certificate was and that has never been produced.
If ACA is unconstitutional &amp; about to be struck down, why is he signing an EO that does exactly what it already does? Once again Trump intentionally lights a building on fire, puts the fire out &amp; takes credit for saving the building - despite being the one who caused the damage.

It's been reported that many Trump voters based their decision bc of a perceived business acumen. It turns out that his so-called acumen has been tied to a $400m inheiritance from his father &amp; several shady, corrupt business dealings with equally corrupt &amp; nefarious characters./2
A "cosmoploitan" person does not speak in such a crude and inarticulate manner. Trump's knowledge of basic history and geography are severely lacking, not to mention his enormous deficiencies in foreign policy, where he runs the gamut from dangerous to laughingstock./1

No one is rooting for the virus except trump. You need to stop parading around like you did something when the only reason things have gotten better is because we have competent mayors who did more than you. And since we still have a test backlog you're riding false #'s anyway.

COVID testing has been slowed by Trump. He actually wants to drive down new case numbers and his move to manipulate the numbers by moving the data to HHS from CDC.  Americans are dying every 60 seconds.  His meeting with Republican Governor‚Äôs was to slow down the testing!

Shut up you opened AZ as soon as your master Trump said to and we won't forget what happened

Twitterer: Basic reading comprehension review: You asked what "action" Trump took. Said you'd wait. Here's the action. When it takes effect is irrelevant to the question you asked, and the answer you waited for. A 'what' question is not going to generate a 'when' answer.
Twitterer: Your wait is over.  I'm sure somehow you'll claim this isn't good or it was Obama's idea, it's racist, or Russia Russia Russia!  Me: Basic civics question: once issued, when do executive orders take effect?  What is today's date?

Biden truly is racist. Remember the "you ain't black" (if you prefer Trump)? Then: "unlike the black community", where he describes blacks as all being alike. He believes (with notable exceptions) black people are identical. He is telling you he is racist. Take him at his word.
Or because God isn't omnipotent? Sounds like Trump doesn't have much faith in God.
Well deserved criticism. Doug Ducey's whole M.O. is playing up to Trump and trying to get McSally elected. He's betting on the wrong horse, as they say.
You are right, we need each other, we need to take steps forward no matter how frightening it is. For me, one of the most frightening aspects of this time in our lives is how ignorant and hateful so many people are. I never realized the power of ignorance that is in trump's base.

I can't watch MSNBC anymore, they are a propaganda mouthpiece for both corporate war parties. They, like mainstream Dem's, PRETEND to "resist" Trump, but they also champion never ending wars, 3/4 trillion military budget, etc.  But to answer you're question, I would guess ZERO.
So based on your response of ‚ÄúSo do you and so does CNN‚Äù you believe is ok that Trump lies because other people do? Once again a Trump supporter defends their ‚Äúgod‚Äù by deflecting and blaming others, and saying ‚Äúyeah but you do it too‚Äù. No accountability. None whatsoever.

I know, it's still incomprehensible bc Trump is far, far worse than Carter (41%) &amp; Hoover (39.7%). But these are the numbers and they do not lie. It's a presidential phenomenom for those who lose. I'm hoping we can change it and vote Trump out in the low 30s. So, #VOTE!
Fun history stats on elections from  Both Hoover (Great Depression) &amp; Jimmy Carter (gas shortages +Iran hostages) lost elections at bottom of their likability &amp; still rcv'd. approx.40% of the vote when they lost. As bad as Trump is, he's in the same losing ballpark.

DAH Of course He Needs all the Illegal's votes! If this Bozo gets elected u can kiss this country GOODBYE. Everything that's going on this BLM BS Unstoppable RIOTS, And chaos is ALL being orchestrated By Dem's TO PROTECT THE SWAMP. They know If Trump WINS PEOPLE WILL GO TO JAIL.
Chuck get a clue.  Trump bungled the response to COVID-19, resulting in the death of 185,000 Americans on his watch.  More cases and more deaths than any other country in the World. We have 30 million unemployed.  Economy in ruins.  Defend someone who is defensible.
Arizona had 13,500 cases on May 15, 2020, today it has 185,000.  Why?  Because you prohibited local jurisdictions from requiring masks.  Numbers came down only after you relented.  You, Senator McSally and Rep. Lesko greeted Trump without wearing masks setting a bad example.
That's PEANUTS THEY ALL STEAL a HELL OF A LOT MORE TAHN THAT! AND WHY NO CHEERS ABOUT TRUMP AND CRUZ PUSHINGTERM LIMITS? LOOK AT WHAT PRICE WE ARE PAYING FOR THE CROOKS MILKING THE SYSTEM IN CONGRESS NOW!
WORTHY? Implies HE EARNED IT BEFORE! There are NUMEROUS Video's of HIS RASCISM HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THEM? I don't know how Saint Hussein could pick him as VP! Trump has done more for blacks than THEIR HERO St. Hussein! He helped Muslims more than blacks.
If by cosmopolitan Dinesh means someone who "travels the world without prejudice and with an open mind," then no, trump is not cosmopolitan. Far from it, at any time in his life.
Like most other things he knows nothing about, trump wouldn't even have known Tik Tok exists if the kids hadn't used it to prank him. He's that ignorant and vindictive.
If trump said it, we know it's a lie. We are a laughingstock, a pitied once-great nation brought to its knees by an incompetent, corrupt president, his sycophants and a cult following. #AmericaOrTrump #AmericasGreatestMistake
If anyone is going to Jail it‚Äôs Biden for spying on Trump, Biden for Ukraine scandal with his son .... Obama for spearheading the most corrupt sting in American history ..... Muller came up empty ... fact ..... high officials confirm that under oath .... sit down Holly
Boom! Awesome. We need more n more Republicans with sound mind and kind hearts to see the light and turn away from this evil pos.
While  administration keeps pushing for schools to reopen.
Flip-Flopping Miss  once called  a ‚Äúrace-baiting xenophobic bigot,‚Äù but then he changed his mind and called Trump a ‚Äúdamn good president.‚Äù Our minds are made up -- it‚Äôs time to END Lindsey Graham‚Äôs career and ELECT Democrat Jaime Harrison.
How about moving the election up so we can be done with him.  is a threat to our lives!!
THIS BLM movement is a organized attempt to create chaos and intimidate voters in election! Marxist Founders, Funding arming, and supported. PERIOD Should be if anything ALL LIVES MATTER! Not a peep about the 60yr old black TRUMP supporter THEY KILLED He didn't matter? Total BS.
Trump ordered his cult to blame China and they obliged.
Good to be out of prison and off probation isn‚Äôt it.  A typical Trump toady/criminal.
AND NO TRUMP
Wrong and why did trump correct himself to tie-land upon repeating the word? Like a fellow twitterer said  "the last time trump went to 'thighland' it cost him 130,000 dollars."
You and Jared politicized COVID, publicized and globalized your own failures, and  weaponized/genocidized the trump virus aka coviDONALD-45 killing 160,000+ ppl in the US thinking it was only going to attack democrats.
Yes, trump is a sad, useless excuse for a human. But the really sad part of this is that there are people who will believe this garbage and live by it and vote by it!
If  loses and is indicted after leaving office, he apparently shouldn't call Joe Biden looking for a favor. Biden's new comments probably weren't what Trump wanted to hear.
Upside: he didn‚Äôt have to meet with Trump or listen to his insane incoherent rant.
Did he test ‚Äúpositive‚Äù just so he didn‚Äôt have to meet with Trump? That would be hilarious.
Well Trump folks administered it, but who knows?
Appropriate that trump's standing in front of washers since he knows all about money laundering.
"Harmful COVID misinformation" .... from the president of the United States.  Watch:
Just listen, please... I just listened to trump speech. All he did was feed fear, and dis Biden. He hasn't told you what he CAN do for you, at all! He promises and doesn't follow through. Doesn't that make you think about your choices? you can do better!
How many Chinese trademarks does ivanka have. Where does trump have all his MAGAt propaganda and other garbage made? CHINA.
stated she is depressed because Trump has racially divided this country. How was her depression when Biden stated blacks don't have any diversity, unlike Latinos. Or, maybe, how she feels about Biden stating in the 70's that integration would cause a racial jungle.
Do you really think tRump really cares about you, or veterans or Christians?
So just the usual bat sh#t crazy rant from trump, the guy who spends his Sundays on the golf course instead of church.
More fake news from ‚Å¶  This is garbage. Try reporting real news for a change. Can‚Äôt even post the facts...
like I want to reclaim my time 20+ times to Barr. not letting him answer just taking 5 mins to chastise Trump! you like all Democrats are hypocrites!
Or der goin back to Trump team illegally surveiled by Obama Administration. Rep Senate tried their best to get Sally Yates to say it happened yesterday in hearing. They chose the wrong witness.
The Mistake by the Lake. Both Trump and the Town...
Not according to the polls. It's Trump who's losing the Black Voters.
Trump is so stupid, he's played by Putin, Erdogan, Kim Jong Un, Xi Jinping and other world leaders. He thinks they're his friends, but they think he's the world's biggest idiot. Add Macron, Merkel, Johnson, and the rest of the EU. They're all laughing at his stupidity.
And that‚Äôs why this morning‚Äôs ridiculous spin by Azar regarding AZ‚Äôs situation was so blatantly political. Ducey is Trump‚Äôs bestie.
Well and what we are told by Trump folks isn‚Äôt true. I‚Äôm sitting here listening to Alex Azar lie his ass off. Praising AZ for controlling spike w/o closing businesses. Say what??? We shut down bars, gyms and indoor dining. Almost all businesses require masks to enter.  Soo huh??
Yeah kinda like the FDA co-signed hydroxychloraquine? Trump has compromised all govt agencies. I won‚Äôt be convinced until British Oxford epidemiologists and Fauci say it‚Äôs reliable.  Our govt isn‚Äôt trustworthy.
Same and I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs all bad. I wish to know WHO is benefiting financially. I don‚Äôt like the fact that CEO made humongous stock buy the day before Trump announces he‚Äôs using DPA to make loan. Huh?  Why can‚Äôt we use DPA to invest in Abbott tests.  Point of care testing?
In case there is any doubt, in Old English, the name Donald Trump literally means ‚ÄúGreat Deceiver. ‚Äú Look it up. What will he (20K+ lies) and coconspirator Billy Barr concoct before the election? We shall see. You know it‚Äôs coming. #ChristiansAgainstTrump #TheTruth
THIS IS WHY 'THEY' MUST WIN TRUMP WILL DESTROY THE SWAMP AND THIER DYNASTY! PEOPLE WILL GET INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED IF TRUMP WINS AND THEY WILL DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO WIN.
THEY have an ACE up THIER sleeve, THEY know Biden cant debate Trump. THEY know BIDEN has DIMENTIA they have a PLAN IN PLACE. THEY ARE INSANE BUT NOT STUPID! We better be ready to FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY!
Trump/kushner/GOP &gt; genocide &gt; The Hague
They like mentally ill. Case and point - trump. Easier to manipulate.
It's if cute you think trump wouldn't if you were. He would say he didn't know you. FORE.
Exactly! I have an absentee ballot for the Rep party here in Lake Cnty FL. On the OUTSIDE of the envelope where postal workers can see it, it clearly shows REP..what's to prevent them fr holding back any ballot marked REP and a vote probably for Trump?  Nothing.
its almost like even HE doesn't believe he will win in November.....so, WHY put forth the effort.....which, frankly, has been his approach since his inauguration,
Shut him down! Twitter is not the primary way the President should communicate to the citizens of this country.
Facebook removed a post from   ‚Äôs account for spreading misinformation on Covid-19, the first time the social media giant has done so related to the coronavirus pandemic.
It's baffling why the GOP is pushing so hard to get Kanye on every state ballot in the hopes he'll take the black vote away from Joe, giving Trump a win for a 2nd term. They know Trump is obviously a racist, yet they'll use race to win.
The GOP is pushing him on the ballots in as many states as they can so he'll (hopefully) siphon off Black voters who would have voted for Biden. The Republicans are scared to death and trying every trick in the book to push Trump to victory.
You could apply your first sentence to Trump as well.  Fair is fair.
This time during Obama's first term (5 Aug 2012), Obama's approval rating was 46%, Trump is at 48%. Don't believe the fake news polls that American's don't support Trump. Rasmussen has Biden at 48% and Trump at 45%, well within the 3% margin of error #RasmussenReports #Rasmussen
Yates herself went rogue by not immediately resigning from DOJ after Trump won! Conducting Pelosi resistance at once... treason!
Also I don‚Äôt watch cable news. I watch congressional hearings, read Trump‚Äôs ridiculous twitter feed and I READ. The man contradicts himself daily and is basically, incompetent.  But hey, that ‚Äúyour favorite news source‚Äù comment was a typical nonsequitur.
I didn‚Äôt say I did know. But I do know what Trump is doing &amp; this Rep has had enough. He lies incessantly, undermines experts &amp; NO, his testing strategy is piecemeal-patchwork. It‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt get our arms around this virus. Look at the other industrialized countries. Shameful
Did I say it was ALL on him? No!  I said the Fed Govt has 3 responsibilities in a pandemic.  1. Messaging 2. Procurement and distribution  3. Nationalize Testing  Trump has failed miserably at his only real job. Keeping Americans safe. You asked why Biden? Cuz folks want to live.
Please stop being Trump‚Äôs stooge!
Nah, you support Trump, you a racist. Don't gotta call a person a wetback or the n word. The mild support for that man, is your support of racism. End of discussion.
Let‚Äôs call it what it is... the trump virus. Make him own it.
Let‚Äôs call it what it is... the trump virus. Make him own it.
Time to call it what it is... the trump virus. Make him own it.
Let‚Äôs call it what it is... the trump virus. Make him own it.
From now on may it be known as the trump virus
Trump destroyed America. Now, it's run by a bunch of corrupt swamp minions and idiot grifters who violate every law they can, use mob tactics to run the government (Flynn, Cohen, Barr to name 3) and have managed to make the world hate us. The government is a cesspool.
That is complete crap.  Why are you spewing it.  Trump and some Republicans are attacking the integrity of elections.  No one else.
Agree.  Nothing to be gained listening to Trump‚Äôs lies.  Refuse to debate unless Trump releases all of his tax returns.
Who is supposed understand this? What is it saying? The way I see it. If we are intelligent enough to elect Trump in 2020 the Enormous Good that will transpire as a result Will Insure DEMOCRACY for EVER!
As Always the Clinton's and MOST other Demoncrats have Immunity for our Mortal Laws. That's what this election is REALLY ALL ABOUT Protecting the "SWAMP" The hate TRUMP because THEY CANT control him HE WILL PROSECUTE THEM and THEY KNOW IT! If he gets elected THEY LOOSE!
That would have been enlightening, but not in a good way for Trump.
Lying Trump mouthpiece, one of the most useless people who ever lived, chimes in.
Trump:  ‚ÄúSome were doing very well, and we thought they may be gone, and they flare up, and we're putting out the fires. But other places were long before us, and they're now‚Äîit's got a life, and we're putting out that life, because that's a bad life that we‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù
Trump could go on these shows and present his agenda for his second term instead of airing his grievances and hate ranting. Oh? He has no agenda? All he has is grievances, self pity, hate and boasting about things he didn't actually do. Sad little man. #AmericaOrTrump
Spicer lied because he was forced to and didn't seem to like it. Sanders was a natural liar. Scaramucci wanted the notoriety.  McEnany is a practiced with no conscience. Trump always replaces people with worse people.
BLM is not a group. It's a belief that embraces acceptance and inclusion, a movement that rejects racism, mistreatment and oppression of people of color. It's supported by decent people of all colors across this country. It's one of many reasons Trump will lose. #AmericaOrTrump
INDICT TRUMP ORG
Attila the Hun and Ghengis Kahn. But I doubt Trump knows who they are has he's extremely history challenged. If it's no on Fox or OAN, he has no clue...
No Trump will win because like AZ, the rest of the country is tired of letting the lunarics run the asylum! Trump 2020. Why can‚Äôt y‚Äôall figure out that we don‚Äôt want America run the democrat way?
This too funny Trump talking üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©ü§£üòÖü§£üòÖü§£üòÖ
Feeling your anger. Trump makes me mad to my American limits, which are far more profane and not nearly as polite as your Canada limits.
Apparently FL contacted WH and pressed Trump to support mail-in voting in FL, as his messaging is suppressing senior voters. Most of whom, are HIS supporters.  Oooopsie
On Manhattan‚Äôs district attorney seeking Pres. Trump‚Äôs tax returns, fmr. Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal says, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason why Trump is pushing back on it so much and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because the documents show that he‚Äôs innocent.‚Äù
Duck you trump
What an embarrassment to the USA.  The man cannot pronounce Yosemite.  This is why  has so many cult members. They love that he is the same level as they are; stupid.ignorant.
Well, we can understand why trump wasn't invited to speak at the services. He would have made it all about his grievances and how he's done more for Blacks than anybody. What a pathetic little man.
Should Joe Biden participate in a debate with  He‚Äôs willing to. But why would you give one more platform to a lying, insecure loser like Trump?
The president is trying to discredit Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci for telling us the truth about the spread of COVID-19.   Please vote Trump out in November. We need someone that will listen to doctors.
We thought New York prosecutors were pursuing Donald Trump's financial records as part of a hush-money investigation.  The scope of the probe now appears broader - and more significant.
I would point out that but for Comey‚Äôs violation of FBI policy in announcing just before the 2016 election that the FBI was investigating the email messages found on Anthony Weiner‚Äôs computer Trump likely wouldn‚Äôt have been elected.  By the way cover-up any sex abuse lately?
And there is some problem with that? In my education in a Military School similar to President Trump, I was taught "If you cannot say something nice it is better to say nothing at all" We are NOT required to LIKE EVERYONE Nor ARE we required to Agree with there ideas or Ideals.
If you think she despises the orange carnival barker her dad is on another level beyond the clouds. imagine dinner time at their house!
I think Americans should get on to the trump campaign for terrorism because they TERRORISTS families into thinking help might not come if you dial 911
We need to deal with the trump virus!!!!!
Huge problem here with the Trump virus!
#ImpoutusAmericanas ‚Å¶ is gonna give the matter some thought on a golf course soon. Just hang in there... #8645ElevenThree20 #VoteForMyAmerica #VoteForOurLives   Trump Says He May Act to Stop Evictions Amid Virus-Aid Talks #SmartNews
Ohhh he‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs favorite bad guy. Kissing Cousins
Trump doin another hostage presser. He‚Äôs back to happy talk and rainbows regarding Covid. He should just stop talking.
They WILL BE if Trump GETS RE-ELECTED THATS WHY "THEY ARE IN PANIC MODE" They MUST win OR the "SWAMP" Gets EXPOSED and we GET TERM LIMITS THEY LOOSE THEIR Dynasty!
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! Eulogy MY AZZ that was a POLITICAL SPEECH From The Democratic Pres, that DID the LEAST of any of the LAST 5 for BLACKS. He DID most FOR THE MUSLIMS! He knows if TRUMP GETS ELECTED "HE" Gets INVESTIGATED HE is TRYING TO SAVE HIS AZZ. HE IS CAMPAIGNING!
But the 60 year old black man Trump supporter "THEY" SHOT in the head DIDNT MATTER? Should be ALM All Lives Matter! On the Jumbotrons THEY should Run Videos Of Arlington Cemetery, and Vietnam memorial wall With the words ALL LIVES MATTER. SHOW what THEY ARE DISREPECTING!
This is why he's so desperate to win re-election. By 2024, he thinks the statute of limitations will have run out and he'll be in the clear to built Trump Tower Moscow, and Pyongyang and Manilla and Ankara...
I watched my aunt descend into dementia. She saw shadowy figures everywhere. Strangers called her day and night. They took things from her. She warned her neighbors. They called the police. Paranoia. Fear of losing control. Hallucinations. Trump is losing it.
Of course THEY dont want Debates They know Trump will Destroy Biden. Biden's dementia is getting worse! They keep him HIDDEN while they try to find a Drug to get him through personal appearances! He is a Trojan Horse there is NO WAY IN HELL he can handle being president.
If Biden isn't capable to face Trump, how can he possibly face ruthless leaders of countries like North Korea, Turkey, Iran, etc?
when the Dems lose in Nov they will say it‚Äôs because of Covid that there voters didn‚Äôt go out to vote Then Adam SHIT will try to impeach Trump again for Voter suppression and unfair election It will never end  when Trump wins re-election 4 more yrs MAGA2020
Bullshit  He's a criminal and cheated his way in to being president! You are a criminal for allowing it to happen! You are a disgrace to the American people by allowing trump to get away with all of his criminal activities!
own son attends a school that will not fully reopen for in person class, because of safety concerns about the coronavirus.
CDC says tRump tested positive today. However he did pick the elephant picture correctly.
Spewing nonsense and lies as usual. You have no decency.  Nevada is trying to keep voters safe in the pandemic Trump caused wth his nonsense and lies.  Washington. Oregon and Arizona all use mail-in voting with virtually no fraud.  You should be ashamed of yourself.
really wants to become a dictator.

No and in fact it seems as though in the age of Trump, we‚Äôve taken steps backward. This saddens me. For many reasons.
Notice he only got violent with the woman.  Yeah real manly
Oh sorry! This guy. Stephen Miller, Trump adviser. Possibly the most horrendously callus anti immigration czar on Trump‚Äôs team. The man is a damn reptile. If we are equating receding hairline with underdeveloped brain?  He Wins!
Promises made seem a lot easier than promises kept.If you're not sure exactly what a conman is then watch this video.üßê Trump provides a textbook example.
I love the Lincoln Project!! Keep up the excellent work!!üëèüëè
How the hell did these "morons" get in there? This is 45's followers new mentality. They are above the law and follow no rules. Just do whatever the hell they want. I hope there was a consequence for that stupid action.
Why bother campaigning?  You and your family better get use to the idea of being passed around in prison.
If it doesn‚Äôt directly benefit me? Screw it.  Let ‚Äúthe peasants‚Äù flounder. Cuz hey! That‚Äôs the Trump way!  #WorstPresidentEver
Nothing, Nada, Zip, Zilch!  There never was a healthcare plan, there is not now a healthcare plan,  and Trump will never give us a healthcare plan.  #TrumpLies #WorstPresidentEver
HEADLINE READERS PROPAGANDA! What Trump said WAS Tongue in Cheek, and look at the RESPONCE! The DEMONRATS say EVERY VOTE COUNTS, TRUMP says EVERY LEGAL VOTE COUNTS DO YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE? ALL LATIN AM POOR Countries HAVE NATIONAL IDS AT 18! But NOT POSSIBLE HERE? WHY IS THAT?
They are getting what they Voted for! It will only get worse. If Trump gets RE-ELECTED "THEY WILL BANCKRUPT" If Not "They will jus PRINT MORE MONEY" Until ALL money is USELESS and HYPERINFLATION KICKS IN. Followed by Socialism followed by Communism!
I can't help thinking it was trumps plan when he put an idiot at the top position in the postal service. Now that man is suggesting holding back 1st class mail. Which will wreak havoc on mail in ballots.  Trump always has an illegal plan.

Trump and his followers are Pathetic! Pathetic! Pathetic!
Nope and rushing it for political expediency is not a good look. I‚Äôm not all that confident in the independence of the FDA under Trump.
I think in Trump world, money &amp; power speak volumes. If he‚Äôs gone? If basic tenants of govt can be restored in a reasonable amount of time? Well then I revise my prediction to essential and health workers first (which is fine), but I stand by mid 2021 before this reaches masses.
157,727 deaths from COVID-19, all on Trump‚Äôs watch and all his responsibility,  30,000,000 unemployed.  Steepest drop in GDP in 145 years.  No plan to do anything about it.  Now that is a record to be proud of.  There is plenty of enthusiasm in Joe‚Äôs campaign.  November 3, 2020.
I do think it's a good idea that if you support trump, you should stay home AND DON'T VOTE,
Because he is Clinton! Saint Hussein is getting the SAME PROTECTION from HIS CORRUPT ADMINISTARTION ACTIONS! This Election is 1776 IF Trump doesn't WIN Kiss Democracy and Rule of LAW Goodbye! "THEY KNOW IT" Best outcome is 25 states secede and make a NEW LAW ABIDEING Country!
who didn‚Äôt honor his oath, keep the House, take the Senate and dump trump.  We deserve better!
I think their boat has sailed.  Do not trust our lives and Democracy to the republicans and trump.  Vote Blue in every election.  Not voting or voting independent is a vote for republicans and trump.  Let‚Äôs vote out every republican Senator and Representative
Never let polls make you think we don't need every vote. Never assume Biden doesn't need your vote, because he will have enough. We need to defeat Trump by a land slide, to let the world know.
Ali Velshi discusses how  has favored states that voted for him, often at the expense of states that voted against him, and how that may have affected the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The vicious and secret attacks on President Trump are heinous crimes and unprecedented!
My granddaughters (all college age) were ready to re-elect Trump (following their parents lead~~they live in Mississippi) until he threatened to take away their Tik-Tok. Now they're incensed he's crushing their freedom of speech. Maybe this will wake up the young voters?
#Christian misleaders, as God continues to divulge Trump‚Äôs over 20K evil lies, it is not and will not be acceptable for you to say, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù You knew! Your hardened hearts just refused to see. ‚ÄúTo whom much is given, much is expected.‚Äù #TheTruth #ChristiansAgainstTrump

‚ÄúThis is not complicated, Republicans,‚Äù Joe Scarborough says.  ‚ÄúYou have a president that‚Äôs on the wrong side of every issue on the coronavirus ‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve got a president who is on the wrong side of race.‚Äù
Pompeo, and Barr, are speaking to Trump supporters, who don't know or care that he has no authority to change the election date. He will try anyway and throw it to the courts to sort out, making it look like they are being unfair to him. Just more Trump distraction and confusion.
NOTHING HAPPENS if TRUMP LOOSES THATS WHAT ALL THIS ONGOING BS is ABOUT! They are in PANIC MODE "THEY KNOW" if TRUMP WINS THE "SWAMP DIES" Trump/Cruz are SPONCERING "TERM LIMITS"! AND you can BET SAINT HUSSEIN and HIS CRONIES WILL GET PROSECUTED! GOD BLESS AMERICA! VOTE 4 TRUMP!

How's that booming Trump economy working for Trump supporters now? Enjoying unemployment, self isolation under a bridge after eviction, and going to bed hungry? Maybe make a better choice November 3. #AmericaOrTrump
I hope TRUMP does not have to comply! I would think that the Constitution has something to SAY about Criminals Illegality in the country being counted as Citizens and being given Rights of citizens! God I hope so.
By the way where is that very inclusive health plan that you were going to offer in two weeks?   That was more than two weeks ago.  Just another Trump lie.  I printed them out and them all in a box.  The box is so heavy I need a fork lift to pick it up.
You are the living reason why we need an intelligence test for voting.  You and Trump would both fail.

Donald Trump recently boasted, "We are in the process of developing a [coronavirus] strategy that's going to be very, very powerful." He was finally asked where this strategy is. His answer was ridiculous.I can‚Äôt believe a man with no postal service is running the USPS and fired his experienced top people. Welcome to Donald Trump‚Äôs America- where anyone with bucks who can kiss Trump‚Äôs butt can do anything they‚Äôre not remotely qualified to do!
Clearly a Trump supporter.
Had a conversation with an obvious Trump supporter. She complained that people have to get back to work that the U.S. is not a socialist country. She then complained about the lack of affordable housing for low income/homeless people.
Sadly I do know a few. But I‚Äôm working hard to change their minds. But honestly, it‚Äôs President Trump that is getting their attention. Most of them like what he‚Äôs been doing / saying the past month.
Fewer Trump voters come election time!!!
You are a disgrace to America, your family, the entertainment industry, and your race. There is enough unrest in our country without you pulling this crap. You deserve to be completely blackballed!
Hell yeah we are voting trump we need border wall in Arizona and deport all illegals!!
The real problem with Trump taking over the post office isn't their being able to deliver the ballots to the ballot box. It's whether they be delivered to the voters in the first place. Their goal is to keep ballots out of voters hands in the first place.
I‚Äôve never understood opposition to the wall. I get hating Trump. I get hating Republicans. But hating the wall is literally just embracing chaos and lawlessness.
I think he meant to say "supporters" of tRump...
And you have been waging an anti-Trump campaign for 4 years.
This thread is about the comparison of the Millions more in taxpayer money spent at Trump properties versus the amount he allegedly donates.   You keep bringing up stuff that has nothing to do with this thread, that's highjacking.
It looks like the big Bernie flips didn‚Äôt get what they thought Trump promised and are done with him.
Voting For Trump Is Going To FEEL GOOD, 2020 Might Surprise EVERYONE  via
Boy! These people are so corrupt. Comey was right when he compared Trump to a Mafia don.
The Steele dossier and Mueller Report contain strong evidence of Trumps crimes. Trump is not innocent, he‚Äôs not vindicated, not exonerated. The case against Trump is not closed. Trump will be prosecuted for his crimes.
Yeah your typical western evangelicals are on some cult level shit when it comes to Trump. They defend all of his trangressions and still believe he was called by god to make America great.....for......them.
Only the Lord knows for sure but I have a strong hunch Trump will emerge victorious.
Bob Mueller did a great job investigating Trumps crimes and publishing his report. Trumps people secretly met with Russians 100 times and lied about it to the FBI and to Congress. Trump will be prosecuted for his criminal activity with the Russians.
Neither Biden or Trump. I vote on myself. I won‚Äôt rely on a white Supremacist to do a darn thing for me or my people.
The last thing we need is another politician ignoring a pandemic bc you‚Äôre excited that Trump paid attention to you. I lost my dad today bc you are weak and care more about yourself than our community. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre termed out. But that won‚Äôt bring my dad back.
witness tampering and other charges.  Trump will imprisoned for years and years for his crimes.
Sadly yes and the reasoning was it‚Äôs a better choice then Trump I asked in what ways.... cricket cricket ü§Ø
Trump has been money laundering for the Russians for years. Trump will face multiple counts of money laundering, racketeering, bank fraud, fraud, attempted fraud, tax fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to commit fraud, jury tampering ...
I met some1 tonight at our weekly ‚ÄúTrump Friday‚Äù social that showed me all the key damage, dents from pellet gun and more damage because his license plate says TRUMPUS
this ice documentary has me so fucked up right now but it lit a fire in me to know what goes on every day while were at home watching tv not worried ... i would kill before they took my child from me ‚Äúimmigration nation‚Äù FUCK DONALD TRUMP
You people are so wierd they already are. And Trump loves communists leaders. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it. Trump loves commies but they are bad so let‚Äôs look away while he kisses their butt.
Trump used Rudy &amp; . Lev Parnas to do his dirty work in Ukraine. That‚Äôs racketeering. He twisted the Ukraine president‚Äôs arm to interfere in our election. That‚Äôs election fraud. He‚Äôll be prosecuted for multiple counts of racketeering and election fraud. He be imprisoned for years
These are the people Trump hangs with who give him advice &amp; seek favors. Biden hangs out with Americans who are actually struggling: workers, teachers, nurses, small business owners, factory workers, farmers, postal workers, vets.
Trump really is just killing democracy faster than an foreign enemy.
Trump should know this.  Is he suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment?
Please pray for the millions of Americans who had their unemployment cut by 70% because  didn‚Äôt do her job. Very soon we won‚Äôt be able to feed our children, pay our bills, and keep our houses. Meanwhile Trump is golfing
I agree!   I  was invited to a Christmas party at the White House and  took a rain check for 7 years until some other President was there. The night President Trump was ellected, I called my daughter to clame my rain check.  and I had the best time in my life.
Trump teases order requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions - He must be suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment.
This a Trump trash type statement that is beneath the office he was elected to by the people of ARIZONA.   Shameful display of pettiness and gaslighting.
While we clutch our pearls, trump continues doing what he does best. ‚ÄúMerchandising ‚Äú( must be said with Mel Brooks voice).  And cheating. There is NO substance, anywhere.  Ever.   (But substance is apparently irrelevant in a post-truth world.)
The Dems siding with Trump again!
That's a lot of taxpayer money being spent at Trump properties, that he profits from.   Trump takes lots of breaks and lots of vacations, the point of the entire thread was that he is making more than he is donating.

Yes. Fact is, the constituency that elected Trump is still behind him, and it has grown. The media polls are designed to discourage that constituency, but we‚Äôre still fired up.
So much for the added value of a Trump pardon ü§≠
Trump failure. Repubs fail to agree on a plan. Americans are dying and out of work. The DEMS HAVE A PLAN. The Dems have unified bill and aporoach to help people. The Repubs REFUSE the bill.  The US is approaching 5 million coronavirus cases
This pretty much sums up the Trump Administration.
well it would be funny to have adult businesses only open in republican states just to show the divide between the two logic....and somehow they would blame trump..to funny
Trump campaign has two candidates. An INVALID ONE, and a FAKE POTUS
Attacked relentlessly for corruption and avoiding accountability for his actions..... kind of an important piece they left out because he‚Äôs fighting for himself, against these investigations into his conduct as POTUS.... NOT fighting for America  Donald Trump ‚â† America
Donald Trump is already doing that......... next, ho
The Repubs in the Senate are a mess. The Dems have a strong plan and a bill to help Americans. The Repubs refuse to help people. Period.Trump copies Obama.Repub party has disappeared.   Trump lays out planned executive orders after stimulus talks fail
Joe, please explain to us how you get credit for the growing economy, but not the blame for turning Libya into a bombed-out slave-market shithole.  If all you can do is have people script stuff for you linking you to Obama and bashing Trump, you're going to lose, and deserve to.
Amazon has nothing to do with it, Trump is jealous of Bazos end of story. Why he put one of his people in I‚Äôm not sure but I bet we‚Äôll find out.
I dont pay to much attention untill one month before the race . I can hear everything they say and have said then.
Shocker. Most trump fans on Twitter are bots
The next 3 months Trump, with enormous help from Russia, FOX, &amp; OANN will try &amp; demonize Biden &amp; his VP pick. They'll try &amp; get us to stay home. We need to remember that our whole democracy is at stake &amp; come out &amp; vote Blue down the ticket - Biden &amp; every Senate race!
The weren‚Äôt added they were closed for the virus and reopened  not added . Trump is just Stupid
So this may be where we all ask, is it actually Microsoft that‚Äôs the driving force behind the ban and possible subsequent forced sale of #TikTok, and trump is the enabler/puppet?
You sure point fingers at Trump but I'm still waiting to see what you will promise to do if elected for the next 4 years??? You have already had 36 years in politics and 8 years as VP. So if you didn't do much so those years, why would I elect you to do nothing next 4?
Nah. Leadership was President Obama doing it TEN YEARS ago. The opposite of leadership is Trump suing in court to eliminate the pre-existing conditions clause in Obamacare.
They know trump supporters are that stupid. That‚Äôs who this is directed at, which is kinda silly since trump already has their votes. Maybe they‚Äôll capture a few more dummy‚Äôs though.
Yo Donny guess what? By Election Day your support won‚Äôt top 28% &amp; your sorry pathetic ass sinks. So don‚Äôt say you never heard that, OK? By March, all the remaining GOP in Congress will continuously repeat 2 words ‚ÄúTrump who?‚Äù
Agree. This is a tough one . I live in #MaricopaCounty and spent 2018-door knocking for #Dems . The Latino community has PTSD from horrible #Arpio and #Trump is worse. They are scared. Difficult to engage.

Trump explained it was a peaceful protest to the Press at this PRESS CONFERENCE  Guess You Didn't Know That, Hilltards LOL
And btw, I have a student loan and got the notification when he suspended it earlier... payments and interest accrual are paused. Schumer was full of sh*t when he said we‚Äôd all end up owing more. It‚Äôs literally paused. Trump will extend that pause.
i would call myself a republican, and i used to not like you because you were a democrat, but the more i saw the way trump acts, and the more i heard you talk, i became more of a fan, make no mistake, i cant agree with you on stuff, but i hope you can get us out of this mess
So true David. And now they have the Tea Party guy Mark Meadows and Munichin doing the negotiating? The Repub Senators are in disarray.  They have no plan they can agree on. They are handing this to  trump.
Republican would like to See the postal service close down on Trump word becasue he want to cheat the election. And we all know there is NO mAil-in ballot fraud! And you can‚Äôt provide any proof
You tweet more than Trump
Absolutely. They are project Lincoln, not #VoteBlueNoMatterWho bcuz they hope to revive their party. They aren‚Äôt supporting our ideals. They are trying to get rid of Trump. Working w/ Reps to promote our ideals or win is different than giving money. Give to  #AZ08
Yes, something is very wrong. He has had his nose too far up Trump's ass. It's making him delirious.
Omg. Now trump suggests ideas that already exist in the Affordable Care Act and acts like these are new ideas????  "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
I've already said that she does not represent me.  She reeks of Donald Trump.    I want you to represent #Arizona, you up for that challenge?
Wait. You guys dragged Obama for this when the ACA was passed. Now you‚Äôre praising Trump for it after it‚Äôs already law? WTAF?! Is the right going to Trump too now that he ‚Äúsupports‚Äù this? Doubt that

Do you really think that Americans are that naive and gullible to accept all the lies that team Trump spin? It seems to get worse and more outrageous as the election looms closer. All Americans must stand together and end this nightmare.
Right on. It's about time Trump is held accountable.
how is it that People hate Trump so bad that they are blinded by it, that they don't see Biden can't even breath a fully coherent sentence. This makes Biden more dangerous. Either way, if he wins or not won't change anything, it won't make bad people good again or stop violence
They know. They're counting on tRump supporters to be their usual idiotic selves and believe the bs.
Are you serious? We have had protections for pre existing conditions since Obama. Trump is currently in court trying to strip them away.
Can we allow this?
I believe this is happening due to rumors that the Trump Administration was going to allow insurance companies to impose pre existing conditions in their coverage again if Trump is elected.
Trump and the GOP truly believe the most dangerous threat we face is Tik-Tok...  Let that sink in  #TikTok
Trump is a big time Dick.
Trump really called Covid-19 ‚ÄúKung-Flu‚Äù üíÄ

If he was doing it the right way, he'd request legislation through Congress, instead of acting like a dictator and issuing an Executive Order. By the way, we already have this, it's called ACA and Trump hates it.

But the ballots will still be mailed and filled out and returned against him. What it shows most clearly is Trump‚Äôs utter desperation. He knows he‚Äôs going to lose and so has nothing to lose. But it‚Äôs only cementing the result.

They're both right.  Republicans who still hold onto the possibility of unrigged elections are worried.  Republicans who are comforted by knowing that every stop is being pulled to ensure a Trump victory (or continuation of power) aren't worried.
The Trump family are corrupt, unfeeling &amp; care nothing about the USA, our planet, or animals.  His two sons have killed tons of them. Not in the wild though. They paid BIG MONEY to kill them in a fenced in "hunting preserve" where they had no chance.
I would get in line right now and wait in line until November 3rd to vote against Trump.
I just love this country. Trump has actively tried to get rid of Obamacare... Which requires insurances cover people with preexisting conditions. Now he is taking credit for something aleady happening, that's he's trying to get rid of.

It wasn't China who ignored a pandemic, lied about it, called it a hoax, and did nothing about it for political reasons. It wasn't China who won't help the people with an adequate stimulus plan. It isn't China who won't do a rent and eviction freeze.  This is all on Trump.

Biden has committed to selecting a woman as his rm. Looks to be between Kamala and Susan Rice. Either of them against Trump would be a massive improvement for Dems, particularly considering the current social climate.
I will not (and did not) vote for Trump. Biden, however, is not fit to lead. His recent racist gaffe and every other senseless, incoherent thing he says is evidence. He's 77. How can we possibly take his candidacy seriously?  Then a thought occurred to me.

You're illustrating my point with that question.  YOU brought up Mary Trump in response to something irrelevant, then ducked my question about why you brought her up. You strawman every comment about Biden into a Trump endorsement, and try to re-frame the thread for your benefit.
I don‚Äôt disagree. I think part of what endears Trump to his supporters is his casual, politically incorrect nature. My point is simply that there‚Äôs a huge difference between misspeaking &amp; being deceitful. But regardless of what the standard is it has to be applied evenly.
Trump is responsible for the death of 160,000 Americans. Trump should be prosecuted for murder.
The advice to Trump on how to fix it plus the words of praise for Haley and Pence definitely led me to think this was an effort to help him. Yes.

It is possible, Trump and family, and cronies are making money off of all of the hospitalizations occurring from the COVID-19 pandemic. In my opinion, that could be one reason why Trump and the Republicans have not come up with a national strategy to stop the pandemic. Money.

do some FAIR reporting and see what happens. All you so called journalists do is ask gotcha questions. Haven‚Äôt you guys learned by now President Trump is just way to smart for all that bullshit?
Now, that‚Äôs rich.  I have noticed how hard the left tries to loop Trump into all the bad moves they themselves have done.  I don‚Äôt think Trump is part of the evil lefts crew.
If President Trump leaves Twitter so do I.
Again, you keep saying "diagnosis" when I offered none, but YOU offered an irrelevant one on Trump from someone who never personally examined him as a patient.  My point was that Biden concluded his remarks, evidently satisfied with a statement even you admit was incoherent.
Sinema &amp; Stanton are Repub lite &amp; McSally is a Trump ass kisser. And all 3 love the Military Industrial Complex! It's big $ over here in AZ.
Hear Trump's response when asked what mistakes he's made
I didn't hate Obama. I strongly disagreed with everything he stands for.  The Left? They HATE Trump. They Hate him.   Trump was elected by a little more than a quarter of eligible voters.  Assuming half eligible voters are Republican WE NEED TO DO A LOT BETTER in November.
cant help his Sheriff buddy  .. loses re-election bid .. Trump is on a losing streak
He just had his head inflated by the trump admin. Don‚Äôt you know he‚Äôs a model governor now?! Lmaoooo üòÇ
Speaking of Thighland, just wait until Trump sees Niger on the teleprompter.
This is a political ploy to keep Americans poor and begging so when he throws out a bone under the term "executive order" and be seen as a magnanimous savior. Puuuuke.  PASS THE DEMS BILL  Trump lays out planned executive orders after stimulus talks fail
$20 says trump has definitely called mike pence ‚Äúmike FENCE‚Äù before. üòÜ
The Left hates Trump. They Hate him with a capital H. They will say and do anything to get rid of him.  We must vote and vote like we never voted before to ensure he's reelected.
You work for this guy?
Looks like we have Kanye Trump or maybe Donald West (aka  ) oooh, I like donald west, running for prez in wisconsin! What a bunch of crap.
And you think Biden's the answer? Things were great before the China Virus! Trump is the best for America!
Exactly. Cooper feigns concern and like you said, is trying to pin it on Trump.
Should he hold campaign events that get people killed instead like Trump does? Herman Cain is dead. Don't know if you heard that, John.
Repubs trying to keep the American citizens poor and begging so when trump throws out a bone he can look like he is magnanimous.  What a joke.  PASS THE DEM BILL
You're obviously a Romanian troll for Trump so this conversation is over. Again, have a lovely evening.
You wanted the states to handle it so they did. Don‚Äôt blame trump for 160k dead
So many of you hate Trump because you say he is racist but this clown gets a pass? If we are being honest I have seen far more racist words and actions from Joe. C'mon man Biden
Trump says he may take executive action on evictions, student loans, payroll taxes if no aid agreement reached
I accidentally bought one that said something about Trump on it but I can't find the packaging right now
Legal challenges to come.... But Trump doesn't care since it's just a campaign thing
We also express gratitude toward our primary opponents on a hard fought race. Looking toward November, I know now more than ever all democrats throughout Arizona are united to defeat Donald Trump, Martha McSally and Republicans up and down the ballot. #BlueWave2020
‚Äúare poorer, less educated, and many have not left their home states‚Äù is a spot on description of Trump supporters.
Trump is simply simple and pathetic.
LOL The Affordable Care Act already requires insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration is currently arguing in a case before the Supreme Court to strike down that very law ‚Äî including its pre-existing condition protections.
How does everybody not see that Trump wants to ban tick-tock because he can now use China as a scapegoat when he loses the election and blames the election interference on China. It's all smoke and mirrors and a big game to him
Really? How so. Trump is the President for 3.5 years and the debt exploded, unemployment doubled, 160k people died from a pandemic, the most deaths in the world by far. He's a con.  #Biden2020  #CountryOverParty
Yeah, I wouldn't believe Trump even if he told me it was raining while he was standing outside in a hurricane!
Exactly Trump is a disgusting person.
Trump is corrupt. Calling his event at his Bedminster Golf Club a ‚ÄòPress Conference‚Äô so the event would be paid by the American taxpayer when he knew it was a campaign rally. #DonTheCon

President Trump is the best...and the media cannot stand it.
The GOP is dead, replaced by the National Socialist Republican Party bent on turning the clock back to 1841. They're heartless only interested in how much more money they can steal for themselves from whatis fast becoming the Late United States of America
Sleepy Joe could not beat his way out of a wet paper bag!               Trump 2020!                   MAGA!
Trump Makes Ominous Statement About Powerful Enemies, Not Seeing Him For...  via  For rest of base, please be not ignorant.  Trump presidency is not the norm.  He has many powerful enemies.  We need to wake up so that hes not fighting alone.

Calling bullshit on this. Pompeo won‚Äôt oppose trump.
Great! Now President Trump has a good reason to void the trade agreement and restart the trade wars! Time to stock up on popcorns to watch China CCP die from thousand cuts!
I‚Äôve been waiting for you to release your environmental policy since 2019, and you‚Äôve never once contradicted trump.   Prove me wrong!

All this was done by Obama but you could not see it because you worked for company that hated Obama but loved trump lies and what happened they kicked your can out from fox irony
Again, just more tiresome partisan BS from  supported by his lame Trump GOP. So much for a deal maker!!
I really wish Fred DuVal would just apologize. I read the column before any commentary about it and was dismayed. It read me as though he is an active Trump supporter. And then to learn he is not supporting Marsh?
Breaking: trump invented Obamacare!
So do you believe the women who have accused Biden as well? Or am I guessing there is nothing to see there. I never claimed to be a trump supporter either. You need your noodle checked homie. You automatically think because someone disagrees with you they are different.
And yet, you do have to say it. If it‚Äôs up to trump and goons like Gosar, one of the Seven Wonders would become a polluted toxic waste site.
Get your head out of the sand! YOU did nothing but leave decisions about mask use and social distancing guidelines to the city mayors and school districts. YOU deflected. YOU are unfit to lead &amp; the fact Trump praised YOUR efforts, frankly, is laughable!

Lady G. better hope that trump will hire you as a caddy next year. In November you are going down but I guess that you‚Äôre used to that.
Trump is just crazy!!
Is this a Joke? The ACA that Trump is trying to kill in court already did that. What next Make them cover your dependents until they are 26.
You should be voting Trump. Take Obam out of your avi. Judgemental hag.
Trump should be charged with crimes against humanity for boarder children's prisons and lack action during the pandemic). Kelly Ann Conway, and each senator standing with trump should be charged as well... at least as an  accessory.  via
No preference but I love the new Sam Elliot adds for Trump.
Just more tiresome insanity from the Trump GOP!
Wow sorry Bill you are the best!  Twitter wants Trump to lose the election.
Trump is a modern day Hitler! Or should I say a want to be? Yes; he has nearly succeeded in destroying America, the world's most powerful country. We must get him out of office! It's vital for America's survival. He's evil.
Maybe there is but whether or not there is or isn't Trump has to promote it as the Dem/Lib's narrative is that Trump will get rid of the pre-existing conditions safety net.

At first, I was afraid to walk over to the new road-side Trump t-shirt stand, but then all three of the OTHER people who got off the public bus with me went to the t-shirt stand, as well! We ALL ended up buying something! (lol, I was afraid they'd make fun of me.)

is a Big idiot who does nothing more than kiss the ring to appease Trump. I feel bad for all the people he suckers into thinking that he's any kind of a leader.
So #Russia wants Trump to get re-elected.  Reason enough to vote against Trump. But I wonder if #Putin, oilmen realize that Trump's incompetent mishandling of the #coronavirus #pandemic is suppressing #oilprice? Demand for #Oil won't rise until #COVID19 in control.
He's one of Trump's androids sitting on a pile of bribery cash, that doesn't care about lives of AZ residents!  Trump wanted the border states to be the most affected with COVID. That's how come he paid most of the Governor's like AZ, FL, TX, big money to not to a damn thing!
how about you contain/eliminate/defeat COVID 19 -trump virus-  very quickly before Nov 3, 2020.
Don‚Äôt waste your breath, Trump supporters will forgive him for anything. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a cult.
One more reason why Trump will be re-elected.  Pence Will Make a Campaign Stop in Wisconsin During the Democrat Convention While Biden Stays Home.
The Trump ads in the Phoenix TV market against Biden contain one lie after another- it‚Äôs disgusting and disreputable
I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere and tried Fox. Chicken Heir was scolding dems for not liking Kanye West. Said ‚Äúthey obviously don‚Äôt think all black lives matter‚Äù. But anyway.. trump was just in a small corner.
‚ÄúYou cannot do evil that good may come‚Äú is the first rule of morality. Voting for Trump is evil. Consider his personal vices, criminality , racism, cruelty and penchant for dictators. He is a demagogue. Biden is patriotic family man who obeys laws.
How has Trump capitulated in China?  He has been supportive of Xi, and extremely critical of the CCP. Shouldn‚Äôt that be the correct posture if there is any hope of China breaking from the CCP?
How many people were killed in so called Trump‚Äôs America because he perpetuated conspiracy theories? That‚Äôs why the death toll became so high in the first place because there was no one leading America. And why we‚Äôre screwed, republicans are still refusing to care about Americans
Nope I‚Äôm not. I will pray for our victims. Obama said he would change America. But Clinton got to the ball rolling. I‚Äôm not sure that GW or Trump are paying members to the club. I need proof.

Trump really does think we are all that stupid
It‚Äôs not about that all. The Dems are the ones playing hardball and politics. Trump is telling them to get a deal done or he will take care of the American people by executive order. If the Dems sue him over that then they were like horrible.
It's true, the govt is responsible. Trump crashed the economy when he ignored the briefings he was given on the virus back in January

I know this is beyond your comprehension Doug. Trump flu doesnt care if people cheer it on or not. What an idiot. There is no requirements about a Governor having any intelligence just any moron like Ducey will do?
It's not a coincidence this comes after dismal Democratic numbers in the recent Primary. For all their talk of 'leading Trump by 150000000000+ points'... it's obvious DNC internal polling is telling them a different story.
So you admit Trump is losing. Incumbents that are winning don't want more debates. Why risk it?
He was called out by a reporter for people in room not following CV guidelines.  Trump said he was calling the meeting a peaceful protest and a political gathering so there was nothing to worry about.  Turned and left. BOOM!
When the democratic party elites choose a terrible candidate for president to run against Donald Trump, it doesn‚Äôt take many votes to siphon to keep Trump in office. #NeverBidenNeverTrump #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
They want to talk with reasonable knowledgeable officials. trump‚Äôs wants quid pro quo.
Nearly 200,000 Arizonans have been infected and Doug Ducey thinks that his inefficient leadership is somehow a success story. If the Governor was as serious about his response to COVID-19 as he is about kissing up to Trump, maybe we wouldn‚Äôt have over 4,000 dead in Arizona.
President Trump is rolling out the wonderful news he said he would!
Reporters need to remind trump his big idea to cover pre-existing conditions was already part of the OBAMACARE he‚Äôs been trying to destroy.
Trump did no such thing. He inherited a strong economy from Obama.   Suspension of the payroll tax will not boost the economy. Over 60% of benefit goes to top 20% of wage earners. It does NOTHING for those w/o jobs, and it causes revenue shortfall for Social Security &amp; Medicare.

Trump's people are so dumb. He knows this because he is only slightly less dumb than they are. And he only cares that his dumb people think he is responsible for pre-existing condition coverage. It's the stupidity, stupid.

Yeah but he's not the only one with concerns. Hasn't been for awhile. People are just only paying attention now because Trump's name is attached, because it would have to be, since he has to sign something.  It's like the one time he actually listened to intelligence.

See what I'm saying. We are leaving the cards in his hands. We need to make our hand stronger. He's going to deliver our issues if we don't. It's all about winning for him, whatever it takes. Some for McConnell. Why he gave go ahead to distance from Trump.
Oh I'm sorry, have you not been following the news lately Favs? News reporters (for the most part)? Dumb. Trump supporters? Duuuuuuummmb.

1. You are a bad person 2. Despite the decisions they made, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre justified.   You‚Äôre doing the same crap Trump does: justifying your terrible actions by pointing out the terrible actions of others.   Your days of comfort with 0 accountability are over.
Certainly  and  have the right to criticize  but shouldn‚Äôt they show this presser with trump talking about cutting payroll taxes, extending unemployment benefits, eviction protections and student loan deferments. Shouldn‚Äôt they show some of it?
The fact that the left isn't outraged and calling for immediate investigations into China &amp; Iran interfering in our election to HURT Trump is proof that the Russia hoax was never actually about "election integrity"  If they didn't have double standards they would have none at all
Yes. I understand. My best background is documentaries.  Friday's are popular for Trump to dump major things to try to control the weekend narrative.  Turns out, seems he just wanted to flex and get some attention.
There it is. The Biden slam. So just another Trump Rally full of bullshit and funded by the taxpayers.
So DINO who's running against Mitch McConnell is using Trump talking pts! Dems are totally Repubs now!

Trump 2020
I watched a  coronavirus commercial on Wednesday with my brother, and you know what? They said to social distance and stay away from crowds and wash your hands, but what was missing? NO PLEA TO WEAR MASKS. This is what Donald Trump has done.
You actually have absolutely no way of knowing this.  But we do know how disastrous Trump has been.
President Trump showered Governor Doug Ducey with praise for Arizona's handling of its COVID-19 outbreak during a meeting earlier this week. But Joe Biden and some local public health and medical experts don't think adulation is warranted.
Listen, I know you‚Äôve got a huge lady boner because trump liked one of your tweets or something but your tweets are incongruous with the degree you say you have.
Tune into President Trump‚Äô press conference.  Live NOW  Wow
Not according to trump. Per him, jobs are just being created all OVER!

Pure hell. Trump will be plotting to undo the election if he hasn‚Äôt already rigged it in his favor!
Watch how fast media finds out about studies supporting the idea and bland trump for not doing it sooner.
We are on a bad path and Trump has bungled this entire effort, but Wolf, if you want to be transparent, it‚Äôs important to point out that,overall, France, Italy, Spain, and GB have roughly the same deaths/100k as the US. Germany has done a much better job.
did Trump just extend condolences to Lebanese families? Before he has ever said word one for COVID families right here in the US?????
Trump feels if he sends everyone to the poor house or no house he‚Äôs that much richer

U are an elected official. Unfortunately for the country ur  party has put U in a position that is hurting the country terribly. U demand that President Trump answer all kinds of questions. Here U are..U get asked like five questions a year and you cannot take it
Obama didnt put kids in cages he was only starting to plan too Trump was the one who actually kept the plan going. but why do you keep bringing up obama? hes not the president anymore TRUMP is and its because of him that our country is so corrupt.
Trump really needs to get rid of those that undermine him and work for another agenda.
Yes right Obama caused many to be full blown depressed when he was pres.he was the worse president we have has trump is the best
obama? didnt know he was still in office TRUMP is hes the one who countinued what obama started but what do you have to say about all those kids he lost? right cause all you guys know what to say is trump 2020 get a life.
Someone is SCARY! ü§£ TRUMP! I Can Smell You Sweating like a hogüòÇü§£üòÇ

Democrats passed a relief bill to protect the 20 MILLION AMERICANS who have lost their jobs and cannot return to these jobs that no longer exist.  Republican and trump inaction harms average Americans every day.   LOSERS and LIARS

Microsoft offering to buy tiktok just so Trump can‚Äôt ban it shows that not all heroes wear capes üò•
Trump just spoke about human trafficking for 5 minutes in his press update, not one follow up question. Instead they are asking about Kanye.
Pro-Life life administration? 155,000 people are dead from COVID19 due to a lack of planning by the trump admin. That doesn't speak pro-life me.
Well Eric. We are going to give Donald Trump all the help he needs. We‚Äôre going to re-elect  him another four years to continue to make America great. But more importantly the most important thing is to make you liberals go literally out of your ever loving mind. You‚Äôre welcomeü•Ç
... which to me makes Trump either incompetent or a liar.. or he's just held off on using this info to manipulate this very election. In any case, I honestly cannot work out a scenario where you are correct and this isn't just a GOP conspiracy theory.
and trump isn‚Äôtüòπ? you trump supporters sure are funny hes far more mentally ill hes lost over 2,000 kids and he puts them in cagesüòê. Trump is not in his right mind.
No matter how hard trump and his cronies try to paint Joe Biden as weak, Biden is still going to kick Trump butt this November election.
It is the trump government Manipulating tactics.

Lol yeah, tons of cases.
What's pathetic is it is 2020 and you're still defining a woman's worth by whether or not she has a husband or children. How about recognizing she's a person first all on her own. Also cut the bullshit because we all know your ass voted for Trump.
Trump and DeSantis are cooking up something bigger than the Bush/Gore elections. Watch Out America.
Just the fact that he refers to it as the China virus grates on my nerves. Seriously, World - Americans are not all xenophobic racists, even if Trump is one.
Why is it that postal service can handle mail in ballots in Florida but not in Nevada?  Could it be because trump placed an unethical person in charge to meddle in the election across America?  LOSER
20 MILLION Americans, and a disproportional people of color, are unemployed thanks to trump economic policy.  LOSER!
Your interpretation of the data is bizarre!  The USA trails all developed countries in testing and has far more deaths due to trump administration mishandling and lack of leadership.  LOSER
Voting by mail is proven to be safe and the best way to combat obstruction provided trump administration interferes in ballot delivery-which is very likely.  LOSER!
It's a pandemic,  are you going to blame every world leader because their citizens are dying? Biden isn't posting these comments, the real power players are. Didn't the Bubonic Plague go away?

Now let‚Äôs hear from the accused child molester....trump has the best people in his swamp

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Today‚Äôs headlines after the GDP numbers: ‚ÄúTRUMP IS WRECKING THE ECONOMY AND COUNTRY BY NEGLECTING THE CORONAVIRUS‚Äù
Trump doesn‚Äôt have the power to change the election date.
While everyone freaks out, just know Trump can want to delay the election all he wants but he doesn‚Äôt have the Constitutional power to do so. It‚Äôd have to go through the House &amp; Nancy Pelosi, which obviously won‚Äôt happen. He can say whatever he wants, it ain‚Äôt happening
The only person who can beat Donald Trump in November is Donald Trump
Racist is a no brainer. Rude, condescending behavior.  Being a trump supporter  for sure!
Trump said a  key word there didn‚Äôt he. But you lunatics don‚Äôt want to pay attention listen. Are they paying for these weapons? We had an actual terrorist Soleimani killing people like my son. And you cried about it you sympathized... So you are the lefy you lunatics STFU losers!Had a conversation with an obvious Trump supporter. She complained that people have to get back to work that the U.S. is not a socialist country. She then complained about the lack of affordable housing for low income/homeless people.
And you have been waging an anti-Trump campaign for 4 years.
The Steele dossier and Mueller Report contain strong evidence of Trumps crimes. Trump is not innocent, he‚Äôs not vindicated, not exonerated. The case against Trump is not closed. Trump will be prosecuted for his crimes.
Bob Mueller did a great job investigating Trumps crimes and publishing his report. Trumps people secretly met with Russians 100 times and lied about it to the FBI and to Congress. Trump will be prosecuted for his criminal activity with the Russians.
witness tampering and other charges.  Trump will imprisoned for years and years for his crimes.
Trump has been money laundering for the Russians for years. Trump will face multiple counts of money laundering, racketeering, bank fraud, fraud, attempted fraud, tax fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to commit fraud, jury tampering ...
Trump used Rudy &amp; . Lev Parnas to do his dirty work in Ukraine. That‚Äôs racketeering. He twisted the Ukraine president‚Äôs arm to interfere in our election. That‚Äôs election fraud. He‚Äôll be prosecuted for multiple counts of racketeering and election fraud. He be imprisoned for years
The Dems siding with Trump again!
Yes. Fact is, the constituency that elected Trump is still behind him, and it has grown. The media polls are designed to discourage that constituency, but we‚Äôre still fired up.
Trump failure. Repubs fail to agree on a plan. Americans are dying and out of work. The DEMS HAVE A PLAN. The Dems have unified bill and aporoach to help people. The Repubs REFUSE the bill.  The US is approaching 5 million coronavirus cases
The Repubs in the Senate are a mess. The Dems have a strong plan and a bill to help Americans. The Repubs refuse to help people. Period.Trump copies Obama.Repub party has disappeared.   Trump lays out planned executive orders after stimulus talks fail
Amazon has nothing to do with it, Trump is jealous of Bazos end of story. Why he put one of his people in I‚Äôm not sure but I bet we‚Äôll find out.
So this may be where we all ask, is it actually Microsoft that‚Äôs the driving force behind the ban and possible subsequent forced sale of #TikTok, and trump is the enabler/puppet?
You sure point fingers at Trump but I'm still waiting to see what you will promise to do if elected for the next 4 years??? You have already had 36 years in politics and 8 years as VP. So if you didn't do much so those years, why would I elect you to do nothing next 4?
I heard Thighland was against Trump winning the election.
üåçüåçTrump is one TOUGH ....? ! He has proved his grit and not wavered.  Politics is almost impossible not to get sucked into,...Trump has proven, he is the real deal when he speaks
I‚Äôm sorry but you chose to lose your freedom when you voted for #Trump. #PutinOwnsTrump
And btw, I have a student loan and got the notification when he suspended it earlier... payments and interest accrual are paused. Schumer was full of sh*t when he said we‚Äôd all end up owing more. It‚Äôs literally paused. Trump will extend that pause.
i would call myself a republican, and i used to not like you because you were a democrat, but the more i saw the way trump acts, and the more i heard you talk, i became more of a fan, make no mistake, i cant agree with you on stuff, but i hope you can get us out of this mess
So true David. And now they have the Tea Party guy Mark Meadows and Munichin doing the negotiating? The Repub Senators are in disarray.  They have no plan they can agree on. They are handing this to  trump.
Omg. Now trump suggests ideas that already exist in the Affordable Care Act and acts like these are new ideas????  "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wait. You guys dragged Obama for this when the ACA was passed. Now you‚Äôre praising Trump for it after it‚Äôs already law? WTAF?! Is the right going to Trump too now that he ‚Äúsupports‚Äù this? Doubt that
i don‚Äôt care if trump is a dickhead there are literal CHILDREN being SACRIFICED I WOULD RATHER HAVE A DICKHEAD FOR PRESIDENT THAN A RAPIST SATANIC PEDOPHILE
Do you really think that Americans are that naive and gullible to accept all the lies that team Trump spin? It seems to get worse and more outrageous as the election looms closer. All Americans must stand together and end this nightmare.
how is it that People hate Trump so bad that they are blinded by it, that they don't see Biden can't even breath a fully coherent sentence. This makes Biden more dangerous. Either way, if he wins or not won't change anything, it won't make bad people good again or stop violence
Are you serious? We have had protections for pre existing conditions since Obama. Trump is currently in court trying to strip them away.
Can we allow this?
Trump administration crooked without a conscience!!! They lie and break the laws in plain view!!!
Will the payroll tax cuts and trump‚Äôs executive orders move the needle at all in the polls and more importantly with helping workers and consumers?
Oh you fixed it so Trump can‚Äôt win! You are a genius...
Look at the date!! Again Trump shows his stupidity!!!
Alexa, define the Trump administration in 22 words.
If he was doing it the right way, he'd request legislation through Congress, instead of acting like a dictator and issuing an Executive Order. By the way, we already have this, it's called ACA and Trump hates it.

Why attend? Trump calls a last minute presser at his golf club. You find that golf buddies are attending the presser. The golf buddies have likely paid to attend.  You know it will all be bluff and bluster. Why not investigate who got invited and why. It is the only story.
So now senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa are teaming up with Russia to spread negative information about Joe Biden. I am now convinced that Russia not only paid Trump, but that they paid every Republican in Congress. House and Senate. #Traitors

We work on Sundays now because of Amazon, why do you think trump wants to charge them more.
I mean trump barely does any of those, so it won't change much, but hope he'll bring back journalists and press-briefings to the WH if he wins
Trump loves using his position to punish Democrat cities and states. He only cares about himself and people who kiss his ass.

I'm saying it is a hell of a gamble to let Trump win and then *hope* you can remove him from office, then it is to elect Biden and then hope you can outflank him politically
I think I'm at the end of my rope with Trump, the GOP, and trumpsters!!! They ALL make me sick to my stomach!!!
I doubt there‚Äôs any accident in this. In fact, I bet the same reason accounts for the supposed drop in AZ positive cases of late. Team trump is not to be trusted and his minions are everywhere.
I would.
Trumptastic news!  Trump strips the AHA,  attempts to give back pieces,  sycophants spread the news, and  wants praise and adulation.    This IS the school yard bully stealing your jacket, getting off on watching you freeze, then giving it back expecting gratitude.  #ETTD
You're assuming, again, that Trump gets removed from office.  That's a *very* big assumption to make.
You're assuming that we'll still have elections at the end of a second Trump term.
Trump is a Putin puppet.
Our democracy is dead unless we get trump and his supporters out of office.
Do you really think that'll be prevented by Trump having a second term, though?
So basically we have a telsa vs edsison sitch here where obama did the work and now trump is trying to take credit after the fact...its the inherited economy all over again.
The past 4 years with Trump has been a nightmare, a disaster.  Trump‚Äôs causes so much damage to our Country. It will take many years for us to recover.
I'm with China and Iran on this one.  U.S. intel: Russia trying to hurt Biden, but China, Iran don't want Trump

The GOP Senate might want Trump gone more than the Democrats do.
No vaccine with my name on it. Trusting God's plan.
Sen. Chuck Grasley and Sen. Ron Johnson...both Republicans...are knowingly passing Russian disinformation about Joe Biden into the Trump campaign according to a top National Security official. KNOWINGLY!
It is obvious. trump and repubs are using the American people as a political ploy. If trump comes in with executive orders he wants people to see him as helping which is UNTRUE. Shame on trump and the Repubs
Political ploy to make trump seem like he's helping Americans. PASS THE DEM BILL. It is the best bill BY FAR for Americans. trump is trying to use Americans as leverage.   Trump may take executive action after virus stimulus talks collapse
The only thing Biggs will be leading after November 3rd is the Freedom Carcass. Leading Trump sycophant who had money handed to him via PCH couldn‚Äôt care less about those who have lost their jobs. #VoteHimOut

do some FAIR reporting and see what happens. All you so called journalists do is ask gotcha questions. Haven‚Äôt you guys learned by now President Trump is just way to smart for all that bullshit?
Now, that‚Äôs rich.  I have noticed how hard the left tries to loop Trump into all the bad moves they themselves have done.  I don‚Äôt think Trump is part of the evil lefts crew.
Sinema &amp; Stanton are Repub lite &amp; McSally is a Trump ass kisser. And all 3 love the Military Industrial Complex! It's big $ over here in AZ.
Hear Trump's response when asked what mistakes he's made
cant help his Sheriff buddy  .. loses re-election bid .. Trump is on a losing streak
This is a political ploy to keep Americans poor and begging so when he throws out a bone under the term "executive order" and be seen as a magnanimous savior. Puuuuke.  PASS THE DEMS BILL  Trump lays out planned executive orders after stimulus talks fail
Repubs trying to keep the American citizens poor and begging so when trump throws out a bone he can look like he is magnanimous.  What a joke.  PASS THE DEM BILL
We also express gratitude toward our primary opponents on a hard fought race. Looking toward November, I know now more than ever all democrats throughout Arizona are united to defeat Donald Trump, Martha McSally and Republicans up and down the ballot. #BlueWave2020

Again, just more tiresome partisan BS from  supported by his lame Trump GOP. So much for a deal maker!!
So do you believe the women who have accused Biden as well? Or am I guessing there is nothing to see there. I never claimed to be a trump supporter either. You need your noodle checked homie. You automatically think because someone disagrees with you they are different.
Get your head out of the sand! YOU did nothing but leave decisions about mask use and social distancing guidelines to the city mayors and school districts. YOU deflected. YOU are unfit to lead &amp; the fact Trump praised YOUR efforts, frankly, is laughable!
Lady G. better hope that trump will hire you as a caddy next year. In November you are going down but I guess that you‚Äôre used to that.
Trump is just crazy!!
No preference but I love the new Sam Elliot adds for Trump.
Just more tiresome insanity from the Trump GOP!

‚ÄúYou cannot do evil that good may come‚Äú is the first rule of morality. Voting for Trump is evil. Consider his personal vices, criminality , racism, cruelty and penchant for dictators. He is a demagogue. Biden is patriotic family man who obeys laws.

I know this is beyond your comprehension Doug. Trump flu doesnt care if people cheer it on or not. What an idiot. There is no requirements about a Governor having any intelligence just any moron like Ducey will do?
Trump did no such thing. He inherited a strong economy from Obama.   Suspension of the payroll tax will not boost the economy. Over 60% of benefit goes to top 20% of wage earners. It does NOTHING for those w/o jobs, and it causes revenue shortfall for Social Security &amp; Medicare.

1. You are a bad person 2. Despite the decisions they made, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre justified.   You‚Äôre doing the same crap Trump does: justifying your terrible actions by pointing out the terrible actions of others.   Your days of comfort with 0 accountability are over.
Certainly  and  have the right to criticize  but shouldn‚Äôt they show this presser with trump talking about cutting payroll taxes, extending unemployment benefits, eviction protections and student loan deferments. Shouldn‚Äôt they show some of it?
Yes. I understand. My best background is documentaries.  Friday's are popular for Trump to dump major things to try to control the weekend narrative.  Turns out, seems he just wanted to flex and get some attention.

trump is more corrupt and more desperate each day. Twisted man knows he can't win in a fair election so he's trying dirty deals with foreign powers. It's time to get this garbage out of the WH.

I am a former police officer and believe this is a dangerous, partisan move to line up behind the discord that trump is stirring around the election. This is a DANGEROUS and terrible idea.
Trump failed to protect Americans from COVID.  Trump is responsible for 150,000 + deaths. He should be prosecuted. You share in the blame for supporting his bad policy. There will be a reckoning during the Biden administration. Trump, you, and others will be held accountable.
Team Biden, the cheating and corruption is starting from  trump &amp; co. We need to be strong, unified and focused. They will NOT take this election by cheating. Guiliani has an evil streak in him. We will hold our ground. This is still OUR democracy.

Trump has never been able to understand that the buck stops on his desk. No amount of pointing fingers or deflection can change that fact. He will go down in history as the halfassed President that lead with half measures
Was thinking about hitting the post office today.  Then I thought, Oh no, maybe I shouldn't on Friday.  What if my stuff sits all weekend somewhere? Wait until Monday?  Then I was sad.  With Trump's  destroyer in place,  I'm losing trust in something I have always trusted.
And then count the times tRump has acknowledged and learned from his "missteps."
No one should be surprised that a package of executives orders are waiting for signature. Meadows job assignment was to stall the negotiations, so Trump could pass his orders that have been the making several weeks. Underhanded GOP political trick to benefit Trumps election.
What‚Äôs amazing to me is that shit is so open now that Kanye can admit supporting tRump openly just to draw votes away from Biden.

Said the Governor who was the last to close his state and the first one to open, without following the CDC guidelines for reopening, because Trump came to town. Maybe Ducey should go to Trump's basement and become his bunker-bitch. Way to talk to a respected VP. #IdiotInChief
Bulls**t. Stop your lying and blaming. Trump was left a pandemic playbook that he threw out. There was also 3 yrs btwn Obama leaving and the start of this pandemic for Trump to replenish. He also ignored intelligence coming from China.   #AZ05 #HireJoan
10 to 1 says trump can't pronounce cosmopolitan.
"On Wednesday, Vice President and somewhat-sentient Trump skin tag Mike Pence flew to pandemic-awash Florida."
Biden is right!  We went down hill when you caved into Trump. No one will ever trust you again! I was a lifelong Republican but have now switched parties. Voting blue no matter who. When your time is up, you will be out! Killing seniors?? Here?? Gone!
Trump is a "bystander in chief".
well ,   had no problem allowing indoor Trump Rally at the height of pandemic with no masks . What is the point in following science only when it suits your political belief ?
I don't think he ever was for President Trump he bragged about getting interviews with Laura Trump I'll bet they vetted him and said no thank you.
What did trump mean when he said yesterday that we won‚Äôt see him for a while?
Get your nose out of Trump's ass, Doug:  The majority of these "accomplishments" were primarily thanks to local leadership response to your bumbling efforts, ranging from "spineless and ineffectual" to "didn't accomplish jack shit" and "actively dangerous to the general public."
He‚Äôs just gonna make this easier for Trump by the day with comments like that.
And enough worshiping at Trump‚Äôs feet. He‚Äôs made a mess of this, and so have you, because you caved as soon as he came to town and threw out the ‚Äúmeasured reopening‚Äù plan. Numbers of tests going DOWN. Schools still not safe. Now what?
The one true thing Donald Trump ever said: if he shot a random passerby on 5th Ave, tools like Biggs would bend over backward to blame the victim. Science &amp; evidence mean nothing to this idiot. #AZ05 deserves a rep with a brain &amp; a heart. #HireJoan
You just have to love AG Barr !! he is knowledgeable, long suffering, intelligent, genuine, and President Trump seems to like him. KAG TRUMP 2020
This tactic wont work.  Biden is clearly demented.  Trump is a lot of things, but there's not much of a comparison.
Unless the commentators actually ask policy questions. Trump has never had policies and has no clue of any that are planned. Biden has many and knows every detail. But if commentators encourage a shot show, Trump always delivers.
Remember kids when Biden (or any Democrat) ‚Äúslips up‚Äù like this it is an ‚Äúhonest mistake‚Äù. Trump does it: ‚Äúevil‚Äù, ‚Äúracist‚Äù, ‚Äúhateful‚Äù ‚ÄúHitler‚Äù, ‚Äúeveryone must Vote Blue in November...‚Äù
Do you have a point? If not go back to drinking the Koolaide that Trump says will cure Covid.
Did you tell the President we were doing good until you rushed our opening so he would come visit? That YOU made it political. That all the deaths since could have been avoided with a slower opening. Everything in Arizona lies at the feet of you and Trump.
This assessment is incredible. It literally lacks credibility. Any claim that undermining the US=opposing Trump is a heavily political statement (which also ignores reality).

Yes, the same Democrats who had a bill ready to be approved by the Republican Senate months ago, a bill that McConnell allowed to just sit there while everyone took vacations, and then just expire. Same bill that trump wanted to contain money for WH improvements. Those Democrats.

Interesting to see if and how battle lines might be drawn.  Pretty easy for teachers unions vs Republican Governors / trump allies in other states. This could be more blue vs blue combat if it materializes.

S. Rice bad pick and T. Kane all over again.  Does not really help Biden and certainly not with progressives.  Son big Trump supporter.  Connections with Clintons hurts. Biden is connection with Obamas. Fine choice for Sec. of State, not VP.
Unfortunately I'm sure the Trump Org and other real estate emprires will figure out a way to benefit from that idea (which has merit) in a HUGE way.
The article states that the funds given to the national stockpile were used on life saving drugs instead of N-95 masks because masks are usually more readily available. It also says the Trump administration received requests also, in the 3 years before the covid outbreak.

The economy that Trump built is suffering from an all out attack by democrats who are willing to trash the country in a last ditch effort to change the trajectory of the 2020 election. This too will fail.
The jobs lost were due to a Democrat overreaction to an illness with a lower mortality rate than the seasonal flu.  The jobs they lost were the ones you sent overseas, Obama said were never coming back and Trump incentivized to return so stop lying.
New York, with nearly 3 times the population, is under 1000 cases per day and a positivity rate of 1%. That's what happens when you don't endanger your citizens for political expediency to satisfy Trump. BTW, you're not getting a cabinet appointment.

When Joe Biden often makes gaffes, he at least has the audacity to apologize. For that reason, I let them slide. When does Donald Trump ever apologize for his gaffes, frequently insensitive (to put it nicely) remarks, unprofessional statements, etc.?
Pres. Trump has been very philanthropic in his life and his wife encourages him to be better every day. She is the reason for his current stance of helping others and prolife. Best look at the whole picture. Biden is not know for his philanthropy just his time in politics.

Keep religion out of the damn debates, the presidency isn't a religious title and shouldn't be treated as such. If journalists want to press Trump and Biden on their religious views, fine, but not in the debates for presidency.
I agree that Trump should be challenged on these statements but leave it out of the debates. I'm sick enough of Christian politicians using their theology as a reason to suppress women's private healthcare decisions. I dont need to be hearing scripture in the debates.

I know one thing that'll change Nancy Pelosi said she would retire if Donald Trump wins. But she's a f****** liar because a lot of people said if he became president they leave the country. Nobody ever left they just kept looking for more attention and going against him.
I‚Äôve been a trump fan since I was a kid. I‚Äôve seen across my life this man make buildings and businesses, not all made it. But he tries.. I try y‚Äôall try. I‚Äôd like to hear commentary about why you like or hate trump and why??    #KAG2020

GOP continues to lie to Americans. Trump isn't POTUS.  Jared is.   At least Joe won't install his kids in the West Wing.

Bitch about Covid19,  Bitch about doing this right bitch about who's not right, now? What we do about the politicians ?  President Trump's the only one who's not overpaid.
Best president ever Donald Trump! Even if the Nazi Democrats won't even give him a chance. I know we have the China virus but he has to get back to cleaning out that swamp. That's the only way he is going to be able to succeed everywhere he wants for American people.
You have the wrong attitude. I'm white and I vote. I didn't vote orange. People didn't vote orange.  Trump lost the popular vote. won the electorial vote. Politicians voted orange.
So the truth is that the Dems are actually guilty of allowing foreign influence to impact the 2016 election. Once again, they are caught red handed doing the very thing they accused Trump of doing. Anyone paying attention? Everything the Dems did to bring Trump down was just lies
Doctors stand behind President Trump, call for reopening America thanks to miracle drug.

VP Biden you are correct to be critical of Gov Ducey‚Äôs responses to COVID 19 in terms of being a model per Trump.  But the Governor has encouraged local leaders to act and not fight common sense like Gov Kemp.  And AZ has made considerable progress recently.
One other observation: You seem way to obsequious to the President.  He and his administration have botched this big time.  You really need to distance yourself from Trump before you go down with him.

Governor of Arizona Doug Ducey is a tool and a boot licker for Trump. He is a complete failure that only thinks about his own future. He doesn't have the huevos to mandate masks and cherry picks (lies) on the data. He needs to resign.
It will be interesting to see how China reacts. They are already over the pandemic and are up and running. The US can't take a trade war hit and Trump knows it.

And arizona is going down on infections cause of our mayors not our governor he couldnt even mandate the mask we didnt get everything our dr med staff needed either and the testing tract &amp;tracing govern ou r ducey failed that one too you failed trump
So, based on what Trump says, I assume you voted fraudulently, voted for a few dead people and immigrants, voted more than once.....right?
Because trump is too dumb to realize killing a bunch of kids and teachers/adults who work in schools is the worst thing to if he wants to be re-elected. Consider the timing of when we‚Äôll see this next spike in deaths related to school opening + the election. He‚Äôs done.
I really wish he was only trying to boost his fame..... but he is trying to split the votes, help Trump stay in office. It's really a crying shame if that foolishness works.
So Trump?
Sounds like Obama: "Tell Vlad I will be more flexible after my re-election."  Yet Obama allowed Russian interference he knew was happening and Trump has put Heavy Sanctions on Russia and beaten them on the oil/energy front.  You have swallowed too much Democrat Kool Aid.

Nooooooooooooo! tRump MUST be held accountable!
Germany wants America to protect it from Russia, but turns around and supports Russia buying natural gas from them. Garmany hasn‚Äôt paid their NATO bill, owing billions. Stop buying German cars and other products. President Trump take all our military out of Germany
Past election have been won my republicans than lossed a few weeks later when found missing ballots suddenly appeared. 2020 election will have massive voters fraud using bulk mail-in voting. Democrats already tried to over throw President Trump with Russia hoax.
I am so disgusted by some post i read today from liberals.  When did it become OK TO JUST SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT KNOWING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IS TRUE IN YOUR STATEMENT.  HATE HAS MADE DEMOCRATS LIBERALS &amp; ANTI-AMERICANS LOOSE THERE MIND.   HATE FOR 1 MAN POTUS TRUMP Vs best for USA
I can‚Äôt believe that the American People want four more years of Trump‚Äôs fear mongering and Republicans incompetence !!
Trump's narcissistic fantasy is that he could be "president" forever &amp; that everyone would believe in "Trumpism!"  Sorry Donald, that fantasy is coming to an end in November when MILLIONS of Americans say NO to another 4 years of this madness.   Your not qualified!!
TRUMPICAN'S IS THERE NO BOTTOM TO YOUR SUSPENSION OF BELIEF IN FACTS?????  MENDACIOUS, "TRAITOR TRUMP", THINKS HE CAN CON YOU FOREVER!!!!!  UP UNTIL NOW, HE IS RIGHT!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!

Trump can't negotiate a ramp, and a bottle of water.  Your candidate does not have the high ground.
If Trump doesn't want to disclose who his Daddy is by releasing his taxes, he should be disqualified from running. Period.
Why?  Here in the US, people either blame Trump or Obama for everything regardless of what the facts say.
He also wanted to impeach him...but yeah...Trump should just ignore all that and blow kisses.
No.  Don‚Äôt take his words and misuse them like that.  They were talking over each other but Trump clearly said: ‚ÄúThey took that and made such a big deal.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat‚Äù is in reference to him wishing her well NOT the fact that she allegedly participated in child trafficking.
TRUMPICAN'S IS THERE NO BOTTOM TO YOUR SUSPENSION OF BELIEF IN FACTS?????  MENDACIOUS, "TRAITOR TRUMP", THINKS HE CAN CON YOU FOREVER!!!!!  SO FAR HE IS RIGHT!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
Isn't it the Trump supporters who constantly criticize any little mistake Biden makes? I guess it's only ok 1 way.
TRUMPICAN'S IS THERE NO BOTTOM TO YOUR SUSPENSION OF BELIEF IN FACTS?????  "TRAITOR TRUMP", THINKS HE CAN CON YOU FOREVER!!!!!  SO FAR HE IS RIGHT!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
Did Trump just say it was a terrible ‚Äúattack‚Äù in Beirut?
Controversial topic but i hate Trump for the sole purpose of his ideologies Trump isn‚Äôt our president because Trump is here for America as a whole the only thing that Trump has offered that‚Äôs good is the fact he‚Äôs bringing America out of debt other than that he‚Äôs still terrible
It should read ‚Äúlet‚Äôs scrap the presidential debate since sleepy, creapy Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt hold his own against Trump‚Äù
It's okay.  I wish others could improve, but I fear for Trump it is too late.
I wouldn‚Äôt! He wouldn‚Äôt stick to the facts, he‚Äôd get all blustery and bullying, he‚Äôd be playing to and audience that enjoys a soap opera drama rather than listening to actual facts. Trump can only filibuster. Waste of time. Let‚Äôs just vote.
I don‚Äôt have a religion. I have a relationship with Jesus Christ. I don‚Äôt put anyone or anything above Him. My wearing a Trump mask to church doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm putting Trump over God anymore than my neighbor wearing a Raiders mask is them putting the Raiders over God.
States buckled to Trumps DEMAND to reopen without a strategy! When the experts recommended a phased approach Trump insisted REOPEN NOW. Trump‚Äôs lack of leadership and concern for being re-elected is why we‚Äôre in this mess- wake up!
I couldn‚Äôt care less about Trump
As for me I am voting "one time" for Trump and hopefully we do get twice as many votes that will out match the double votes for Biden.
And trump keeps saying we are doing better than any country in earth üåè what do saywe put him on the next mission to MARS
Don‚Äôt believe her as lies like Trump.  A Trump Hack
So does  now wish  well?  What about Peter Strozk and James Comey?  Trump couldn't bring himself to wish John Lewis well and he condemned John McCain to Hell.
Over 150,000 Americans dead and Trump claims success and said ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù.   THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE #Biden2020
Not the inside of trump's an cavity unlike most of his supporters....
I guess I need to find videos for you of trump doing the same thing.  They both suffer the same issue, old age.
Meddling?  Is that what you call it when Trump endorses a Republican, too?  Just curious.
OMG! Ok... pay attention. Simple. We could stop testing nationwide TODAY and thousands of people per day would still be DYING! Trump would be happy with lower numbers .. we‚Äôd still be DYING! Why is that so hard to understand!
‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù says Trump about dead Americans.
We all know who does and who does not have a plan. Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan for anything.
"TRAITOR TRUMP"!!!!!  YOU MENDACIOUS, NARCISSISTIC, SUBHUMAN POST ABORTION SCUM!!!!!  WE MUST RID OURSELVES OF THE CANCER WHICH IS YOU!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020
#TrumpIsNotWell Trump is declining in mental acuity daily! He just doesn‚Äôt get the trouble we‚Äôre in, and flat out doesn‚Äôt care.
Well, that it is a small sacrifice Trump is willing to make, you know, letting everybody die before he admitted he was wrong!
Disagree Trump need to come out against the use of HCQ...overnight it would become widely available and the media would praise its use!
People will tell you everything they hate about Trump but can‚Äôt tell you what they like about Biden üòÇ
Watch this video about trump-  According to Trumpall the countries in the worlds stats are wrong but trumps
Trump is all lies and propaganda  no truth allowed
if Trump's lips are moving, he's lying and dividing
Trump was laundering Russian mafia money, colluded with them to undermine our elections, and ,yes, he will likely go to prison in 2021  maybe you too
Great song, great beat, great win for President Trump
Of course it's Trump's fault.  What isn't?
#Trump I have disabilities and I need you to help me I need to get disability I worked the same job for 20 years I broke my back and they let me go please help me
You‚Äôre right Trump is on Earth while Biden is lost somewhere in the universe üòÇ
Just like in May when trump came here and leaned on the govorner to open the state, Trump‚Äôs going to lean on him again to open schools.  And, Ducey will fold like a deck of cards.
Biden needs to debate Trump because the low information voter will get a chance to see what the Dems have put out there for their vote.
TDS at its finest. David Hogg had a good point there. Too bad he can‚Äôt have President Trump agreeing with him. That would show too much unity in a time of divisiveness and we can‚Äôt have that!
YOUR INCOMPETENT, INEPT, PLAN TO NOT HELP THE BLUE STATES WHEN COVID-19 WAS DEVASTATING THEM, HAS RIGHTFULLY BACKFIRED, AND IS NOW DEVASTATING MOSTLY RED STATES, SQUARELY PUTTING TRAITOR TRUMP'S RE-ELECTION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE, THANK YOU!!!!!

Trump Hack. All BS
We need to get rid of Trump virus then we can get a competent leader to attack the COVID-19.    Trump is killing us not listening to Expert Doctors, Mandate Masks, and improve Testing.   #TrumpVirus #Biden2020 #Fauci
If Trump's lips are moving, he's lying
McSally is a Trump Hack.  Lies Lies  During her two terms in the House of Representatives, McSally repeatedly voted to repeal the ACA, perhaps most memorably in 2017 when she reportedly used profanity to exhort her GOP colleagues to join her on the vote.
We need to have immediate fact checker or no debate. Every word Trump saids is a lie
Trump hack.  I do not believe a word she states
"TRAITOR TRUMP"!!!!!
TRUMPICAN'S, HOW CAN YOU CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT PURE EVIL LOWLIFE, HOW DO YOU DEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE, HOW DO YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES, "DON'T BOTHER ME WITH THE FACTS, I'VE MADE UP MY MIND, IS THER NO WAY OF GETTING THROUGH TO YOU HOW MUCH PERIL, TRUMP HAS PUT US IN, IS THERE?????

HEY BOYS AND GIRLS, UNCLE JOEL HERE!!!!!  A QUESTION WAS RAISED, WHAT WOULD TRUMP DO IN A CRISIS, NOT OF HIS INITIAL DOING, YOU DRAW YOUR CONCLUSIONS!!!!!  TRUMP FAILED TO RESPOND, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A NATIONAL SCIENCE-BASED REPLY TO COVID-19,
Trump says he took it and he‚Äôs fine. But he‚Äôs not fine; he‚Äôs now even more psychotic than ever and he‚Äôs clearly unwell physically. #TrumpIsNotWell
These are not children  and one of them is on the government payroll. None of the former Presidential kids was in that category. Not Obama‚Äôs, not Bush‚Äôs, not Clinton‚Äôs, not Nixon‚Äôs - none of them!  Notice no one is tearing into Tiffany or Barron Trump.
Not to worry he is taking his personalized Trump knee pads.Hell no. It was good and getting better under Obama. Trump ruined everything
Well Chuck he just tired everybody, so your letter &amp; harsh words were not a threat! The GOP &amp; trump are now proceeding on breaking every law of norm that gets in their way of a reelection! Time to use the legal systems to save America, because trump doesn't fight fair!
you are apparently a big Russian propaganda mule now! How does it feel to give away the United States to trump &amp; Russia? Hope your happy!

This is trumps America.  The only people that should be on trump's side are the very rich, or the White Supremacist, because that's the only voters trump cares about!
trump's rhetoric on a hot Mike sounds just like his crazy tweets on twitter! Who calls reporters "killers" &amp; then expect respect from these dedicated journalists? #PresidentSnowflake CAN'T be a Winey Reality Star  &amp; a President!  Trump has chosen to play the "star" #VoteBlue

tRump is not a man ; he is a small-minded creature that only thinks about feeding his own self interests , and "reproduction" ? How is it the GOP is so afraid of someone with such low intelligence ?
You are so right! They go out of there way to kiss up to trump!
The Republicans in power have thrown their common sense out the window to prevent a mean trump tweetüò†
Why would doctors and scientists know anything about viruses? Trump's "super genius" thinking knows all
Run worse I am sure you meant run worse. Governors killing people to honor trump's wishes are now killing 1000+ people a day! But you be You &amp; show you just don't give a dam about those other people! Saving lives should NOT be a partisan issue!
Fake News Mr trump! Your numbers are always fake news!
We know those are just recouped jobs. Not new jobs like Trump wants us to think
WTF?  Trump is initiating a spiritual awakening?
It's these type of people that support Trump and it scares the rest of us
Trump looks like he morphed into Bill Clinton.
Trump is anything but a Christian. He just using it now because it sounds good
Watergate was it for Nixon. Trump has gone way farther than Nixon, the events are numerous. Trump should resign, he is dangerous
Trump's America sucks! I am so sorry about your uncleüò¢
I think someone found a good place to put the trump Library and who knows he might spend the rest of his days reading thereüòÅ
Any bets the Trump campaign did not pay for the rights to play this song either ?
Just a Trump ploy to siphon votes from Biden. Maybe if there was a normal candidate, it would be a good try.  Voting for Kanye would be a waste of time
The country is grieving. Trump would have you believe we are not. #VoteBiden2020
Trump thinks Thailand is part of North Korea ?
When you say it like thatüòÅüòÅüòÅ Trump really should stay away from the God argument. He can't even hold a Bible right!
#ETTD the Rick Wilson Book still haunts me &amp; Trump's disastrous leadership is a big blaring Stop Sign
I wish. But it's not going happen as long as Trump is in the White House
Seniors know that one of the downfalls of aging is missing your words. The inability to read can be signs of dementia or Alzheimer symptoms! It is an obvious sign that trump is not prepared &amp; does not practice his written propaganda! I want a prepared President! #AmericaOrTrump
Agreed. It will show Trump knows nothing. But.... Religion has nothing to do with politics and should never be the measure of a person
Trump says it only unsafe for ballots, everything else it's safe. Wtf?
Another example. I guess Trump's control of the virus didn't reach that farr
Trump needs to be completely neutralized
TRUMP
Open schools now are proving they aren't immune. Trump disregards the facts
There's nothing godly about Trump. He doesn't believe nor read the Bible
I think trump folk, even with all their Evangelical leaders &amp; following,  DON'T understand praying is not a sign of weakness, not is the ability to feel empathy &amp; sympathy! But it does emphasize the trump inability to feel empathy or care for others. #TrumpFailedAmerica
It's was your choice and right. I have no trouble with it. I'm sure there are others in the same situation. I didn't think Trump would win either
This fits your prison idea, &amp; also the trump library problemüòÅ
Me too! I used to not worry about every day politics &amp; the chaos that they could cause like forgetting to sign a bill to build a bridge. Now I wake up at night, wondering if trump will start a nuclear war to try to hold on to the worst presidential Administration in history!üò¢
So now Jared, Ivanka &amp; trump all do their own thing on unsecured phones, but no one acts that IT'S even a problem. The double standards on any women in power is so 1950s! Hypocrisy or misogyny? Both?
This should say "Meadows falsely claims Democrats did something wrong, when in fact Dems passed a bill 3 months ago &amp; trump &amp; McConnell failed to act on it!"
This man is as evil as trump!
Yoo is just a dangerous as Trump.
Another Trump attempt. Ridiculous
The text is obvious, it's not Twitter text, so its not official. I hate Trump anyways.

We are not surprised, Trump always lies.

The GOP and Trump want to take your Social Security that is why the Democrats won't agree to phase 4 Covid relief.  We are 3 months away from the election and STILL AARP an organization that is supposedly meant to help Americans of age hasn't said one G.D. thing ! VOTE BLUE !!
I don't think anyone with a lick of sense would vote for Kanye. But then there are those who voted for Trump.
Trump Criminal Enterprise.  We have not seen the full extent
The debate would be a no contest for Biden. Biden would out show Trump.
Let me sure, if Trump loses the election, how can he quit? He would have to quit before the election, then Pence takes over. Am I confused on your point?

Opinion | If one reporter can demolish Trump, where are the rest?
In fact it took 13 years and trump being in office to get a 13 year old case unsealed,  because Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and others were named as pedophiles in it.
In regard to the Axios interview, how can Trump say he didn't recall meeting John Lewis, but can remember that John Lewis wasn't at his inauguration?
Trump loses election - " it is what it is"
Uhh..because it is. Trump has no idea what he got himself into. It's a joke.
Trump gives his approval for mail-in voting!!!!
Motorcycle accidents,  gunshot wounds, shark attacks.   They are covid related deaths, because they tested positive.   The numbers aren't even near correct.   Not to mention it's a different disease, and the infection rate is much lower than 2009.  They want trump to cure it too.

The positivity rate is 21% in Mississippi highest than any other state in the country. Trump isn‚Äôt concerned about students,teachers and staff. It‚Äôs all about his re election..
Oh believe me, I hate Donald Trump as much as the next person does. You're right.  He did do this, Trump wanted this. He even had interviews about a second civil war, it's sickening. I'm learning though and hearing more about the protests. I agree with the protestors.
Just a guess, but trump was hooked by Jonathan's smooth voice, &amp; the idea he could be seen on HBO and be so close to those Hollywood stars? Then Jonathan used those big words of his &amp; the deadly complete sentences. It fools trump every time!üòâ

Yup trump stepped on George Floyd's neck, in a liberal city.  I didn't realize he controlled all the police districts.   I also never realized he ordered his so called  "goons" to burn down said liberal cities.   You lefties are blinded by hate.  Orange man Bad!

So Trump has to go outside the US for support and from Authoritarian leaders!  He wants to be President for life like Putin, but that's not going happen
Looking forward to your concession speech but you are Trump and would never give one because you are a sore looser.Biden is going to blow you out.The American people want something done about this virus and as long as you are President we will be in this condition...

I understand that you live in a fairy tale mirror world, where the good guys are the bad guys and vice versa.  Those court documents that I went through proves that without a doubt.   You project onto Trump what the Democrats have been doing for decades.

He's like Trump. He doesn't care, has no principles, no morals , no empathy.  It all about politics and what helps Trump's image.  He's failed
And Trump listened!  Both are guilty. So they used the virus hoping to deplete the Democratic voters
Just another attempt to subdue protesting. It was shown that these protests had not spread the virus, but Trump's rally in Tulsa did.
Hey Liz, do you know who wasn't implicated?  Hint: Donald Trump In fact the prosecution said he helped them build a case.  It seems we've been right all along!

Trump is a wanna be
Trump is attempting what Putin did in Russia. To be in office and control.  The founders were very particular in what they placed in the Constitution.
I say vote Trump off the island and deport him come November.
Get it together!  You are not doing your jobs. Focus in the nation and the people, uphold your oaths.  You're being to sound like Trump.
Let them get sick, their choice. It will be a mistake, like supporting Trump
Thank you Bean!
Because people would rather believe lies than see reality. It's ingrained since childhood. They don't use common sense or reasoning. They, like Trump, blame others for their troubles
I see following Trump to the end. Trump said he took it, but that's not proven. We will see what happens.
Just waiting for the next Trump tactic.
GOP = dumber then a rock Pence = crazier then a look Trump = crazy like a Fox because he got all the GOP to follow his lead!
The buck stops here. - H. Truman  It never reached my desk. - D. Trump
I won't ever be a Trump supporter at all. I just want to vote for Biden and get it over with.
Oh I have a vote and a conscience.   My wife has a vote and she's a bernie bro, but she's voting for trump.  She knows Bidens a racist, pedophile, rapist.  So she's voting for trump.
They are also interfering with the election by not giving Trump equal time. I see Biden ads all day long on Hulu, Netflix, even Fox. But Trump's ads are no where to be found.

Seriously, he comes back from a visit with Trump and acts like a Trump puppet. Ducey has shown zero leadership, leaving it up to mayors and county boards to decide on masks. Maricopa County's mask mandate is reducing numbers overall. School opening will skyrocket AZ's numbers!

Everything he said about Arizona's cauvet numbers was a lie. Yet the media keeps giving him free airtime for lies and then there's no correction. I would like to see Joe Biden do a press conference after trump and correct all the lies.
If the press can give airtime to the liar in chief why can't job I the do a press conference after trump and correct all the lies publicly?
What if Joe Biden did a press conference after trump everyday and  Corrected his lies in his exaggerations and his facts and figures. It's starting to be too much. For example I'm from Arizona in today everything he said about Arizona was totally incorrect.

What possible difference does that make.  Had the virus originated in the US trump would have the excuse that he had no opportunity to take a proactive stance.  It started thousands of miles away and trump squandered 70 days before responding.    The place of origin is irrelevant

It has NEVER been called thighland, instead of admitting trump effed up AGAIN, you defend it. He said it the correct way after he miss pronounced the word.
Twitter is a joke. Trump is trending because he mispronounced Thailand, meanwhile Biden insults every black person in the country and there is not a peep. Go ahead and elect this incoherent racist if you want to. See what you  get . #BidenCognitiveDecline #BidenIsARacist
Trump effect.  Though I feel sorry for any Republicans that got short changed by this.  Make it a teachable moment, and play it safe, by voting in person on election day.
I just watched this interview, totally incredible and boggles my mind that for the total length of the interview he totally ignored the message you were conveying about the need for NATIONWIDE rapid testing committment from Trump. It was truly unbelieveable!!!! #SadButTrue
Let's get the scarecrow Biden into a debate with Trump. We are all waiting for this to happen!
Michael Muscato has a real opportunity running against Debbie Lesko, Arizona's Enabler of the Trump. She, along with McSally and Ducey clung  like all good Republicans to the Super Spreading Trump rally six weeks ago. Now, they want you to vote for them,
I have no proof that he is but from what I've seen he definitely is. I'm not a Dem but I don't like Trump's Republican party. I liked the old GOP. Just me.
Uh, how could they be the person of my dreams if they‚Äôre a trump supporter?
YES, WIN OHIO BIGGER,WIN PA. BIGGER, SHOW THEM PRESIDENT TRUMP,YOU ARE THE GREATEST BY FAR. FOR THE PEOPLE! PROMISES MADE &amp; KEPT. KEEP WINNING FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL FREE COUNTRY. YOU MAKE THE LAWS, WIN WIN WIN ! ALWAYS,GOD BLESS YOU!!!!

So Mark Zuckerberg &amp; pals have been helping ONLY right wing pages &amp; posts avoid fact checks &amp; negative consequences on #Facebook while simultaneously pushing negative hashtags about Biden &amp; removing negative ones about Trump on #Instagram....#MarkZuckerbergisRatfuckingtheelection
It‚Äôs all Trump has, trying to make opponents to the Trump Party and himself look worse than them.
So GOD needs Trump to save him? The creator needs Trump? That people believe this makes me very sad. Actually hurts my soul.
So you pull up videos from a few months ago but you don‚Äôt explain his RAPID decline.  He is incoherent &amp; refuses to come out of hiding and won‚Äôt even debate Trump.  There is a reason his wife was interviewed &amp; not him.  He can‚Äôt form complete sentences &amp; rambles.
SURE AS HELL DOES NOW.  Other than you father, No Republican stood against the asshole Trump. That brand is sullied forever.

They say that a chain is only as strong as the weakest link. Trump is that weak link.
No you are taking it out of context. He was making a point. I bet you he knows how to say Yosemite, unlike Trump who pronounced it Yo-Semite.

Sturgis in South Dakota it's still going to happen! An expected 250,000 people are going to show up to this little town. Does anybody else see this as a problem?  Apparently not, because nobody's trying to stop it. If Trump wanted to save lives. He would stop this biker rally!üò°
Let's just wait till the election and see how many votes he gets. And then together we will watch Trump take the swing States and possibly take the election. And the both of us will be crying come January when he's re inaugurated
I never said his followers were black. I said he had 29 million followers. you're the one that put the Assumption there black. I'm just saying he's going to get votes, he's going to take it from Biden. and it's going to help Trump
WTF? Now the devout catholic who goes to church every Sunday, is going to get rid of religion? How is he going to hurt the Bible? Trump worshipers will believe him too.
Sadly yes somebody will. He has I do believe 29 million followers on Twitter. even if only 5% of them vote for Kanye. that's 1,450,000 that's enough for Trump to take key battle states
I wonder what the justice department has to say about the trump modeling agency ivanka?  Didn‚Äôt you work there at one time.  #turnedhisdaughterout ?
I have no problem having a third party. I wish we did have a third party.what I'm saying is, what Kanye West is doing is just bulshit. he's taking votes from Joe Biden and the Trump campaign is behind it.
Trump's just said that he thinks the vaccine will be ready by November 3rd. But also went on to say that its not because of the election that is coming out on November 3rd, he says, I just want to save lives. LOL it's all about the elections for Trump
This person is truly talking about is the democrat party is overflowing with FRAUD and ABUSE  they have demonstrated this history of decades. Basically the democratic party ALWAYS blames others for what they do. They blamed President Trump about Ukraine but Biden actually did it.

I don't believe any votes are going to come from Trump. I believe every vote will be from Independence and Democrats. I find it hard to believe you can find me one Republican that would vote for a black. I'm not being racist, I'm being truthful
Hey Trump. Why don't you give us just one of your favorite quotes from the Bible. Lol

Yeah demand away, he‚Äôs a Trump stooge sent in to destroy the post office.  Sue him.
Omg, he is not going to be on all 50 states. Therefore he has no chance of being president. His main reason with the help of the Trump campaign is to siphon votes away from Joe Biden and putting asshole back in the White House
And the Republicans ignore the fact that Trump can barely put four words together and make a coherent sentence
Trump proved his ignorance every day. He wants to move the debates up before early election starts. Doesn't he realize anybody that's going to vote has already had their mindset. And him standing up on stage lying about the same things, are not going to change anybody's mind.
Like it or not Donald Trump is the best choice for presidency for the next four years. You may not like how he says things or his arrogance But he‚Äôs created jobs lowered our taxes put money in our pockets and our economy is booming.

THAT IS WHY I KEEP PUSHING FOR THE MILITARY TO INTERVENE, AND BACK TRUMP AND OTHER PATRIOTS IN OUR GOVERNMENT....  IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE THIS MANY TREASONOUS TRAITORS, AND GET AMERICA BACK ON TRACK....   PLUS, MILITARY INTELLIGENCE IS INCREDIBLE, THE BEST IN THE WORLD....
IT IS ETHER MILITARY INTERVENTION, OR THE COMMUNISTS, THEIR MEDIA, AND THEIR POLITICIANS WILL DESTROY OUR CONSTITUTION AND COUNTRY....  WE HAVE PATRIOTIC AMERICANS IN GOVERNMENT LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND TED CRUZ TO FIX OUR PROBLEMS, BUT IT CAN NOT BE DONE WITHOUT THE MILITARY....
Biden should make a debate conditional: Only after Trump releases his tax returns and the results of a drug test.
BREAK THE WILL, BANK ACCOUNTS, AND SPIRIT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IS THE GOAL OF THE COMMUNIST MOVEMENT IN AMERICA....  SO FAR THEY ARE ACCOMPLISHING THEIR GOALS....  BETTER HOPE AND PRAY, TRUMP AND THE MILITARY OUST THE TREASONOUS TRAITORS NOW.... BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE....
dear Joe. You seem to have forgotten the first half of the sentence. Just to jog your memory here it is. President Donald J. Trump- ‚ÄúI think that, at some point, that‚Äôs going to sort of, just disappear, I hope.‚Äù
ONE PATRIOTIC CONSTITUTIONAL AMERICA.... WITH TRUMP AS PRESIDENT....   WOULD MAKE AND KEEP AMERICA, THE MOST PROSPEROUS AND POWERFUL NATION ON EARTH....  DUMP THE TREASONOUS DEMOCRATS, SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.... INSTEAD OF CONSTANTLY GOING IN CIRCLES, AND MOVING BACKWARDS....
What is Ducey going to do to appease Trump this time? The last time he opened up the state too early and put us in this predicament in the first place. This also comes two days before Ducey is due to release benchmarks for reopening schools.
This is where Trump flips over the checker board.
So, you‚Äôre saying, he needs to take a trump?
Far out! Trump playing "Cowgirl In the Sand" at his July 4th Mount Rushmore event just about put me over the edge.
"Us and Them," Trump's motto.
Same here. Trump is impaired. He's getting worse. I noticed the one graph handout during the interview was in color and enlarged for him. His staff knows he can't grasp the material. #25thAmendmentNow
Trump has cognitive impairment. #YoSemites
Here's a great synopsis of Jonathan Swan's interview of Donald Trump. The Gaslighter-In-Chief frequently says to the interviewer, when presented with facts: "You don't know that!" Oh yes, you pathologic liar, we do know.  #AxiosOnHBO #JonathaSwan
Trump has no idea how ridiculous and uninformed he is. And that thing he constantly does with his hands during interviews is so aggressive and defensive, all at the same time. I wish we could see "after the interview" footage.  #AxiosOnHBO #JonathanSwan
Your procrastination and allegiance to Trump have brought us to this day. You both see everything in terms of blue states, red states, and what's best for the corporations. Shame on you for letting millions of Americans suffer. How's your aluminum plant? #COVID19 #stimuluspackage
A president who loved others would tell all Americans to vote by mail. Why?  To save lives from this virus on voting day in November.  He only knows how to cheat and lie.  Soes Donald J Trump loves anyone more  than himself?
You mean Trump won the presidency in the same manner all other Presidents have.
Haven't the Democrats pissed off all the Unions or are they claiming Trump is trying to destroy the USPS
If virginia is competitive, Trump's already won
THINK about this, is Donald Trump - who wants to protect Americans from this virus, doing the right thing, by wanting every voter to vote by mail?    NO, he is not.   WHY?
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAN WEATHER THIS STORM FINANCIALLY, HOW FORTUNATE YOU ALL ARE...  FOR ALL YOU HARDWORKING PEOPLE RAISING FAMILIES THAT DON'T MAKE ENOUGH TO SAVE FOR THESE TIMES...  WELL, ALL I CAN DO FOR YOU IS PRAY THAT TRUMP AND THE MILITARY GETS AMERICA BACK ON TRACK...
AMERICA IS NOT READY TO BE BURIED YET....   NOR IS AMERICA UP FOR SALE TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE....  DUMP THE DEMOCRATS TODAY, YESTERDAY WOULD BE BETTER....  TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE, FREE, STRONG, AND PROSPEROUS....   STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP....
WE BETTER START SEEING PRESIDENT TRUMP, AS THE REINCARNATION OF GEORGE WASHINGTON, AND SUPPORT HIM 100%....  OUR REPUBLIC'S SOVEREIGNTY AS A NATION, IS WAY OFF COURSE....   THE TREASONOUS DEMOCRAT TRAITORS MUST BE REMOVED, AND LAW AND ORDER RESTORED ACROSS AMERICA....
President Trump takes Marine 1 and lands on his back yard.
TWO GOVERNMENTS FOR ONE COUNTRY DIVIDED, IS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN....  NOW IT IS HAPPENING, AND THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM....  TRUMP, AND THE MILITARY ARE THE ONLY SOLUTION, TO STOP THIS SOCIALIST/COMMUNIST MOVEMENT....   NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE CALL IT....
The trump name will become synonymous with failure, idiocy, and weakness. That will be your legacy.
actually I was a huge skeptic of Trump and really angry about that "Grab her Pu55y" comment. But then I learned about his ability to shoot Syrian airbases and ISIS 100 miles out, so I became a huge fan. So 2020 for him, he wins big. Wanna make a bet?
Trump is off the rails.
Exactly. And Trump just told us that the Towers have not fallen. #TrumpPressConference
Treason is being committed right before our eyes! I seriously think Trump's bogus plans for the Rose Garden and West Wing are, in reality, his (and Putin's) designs to reinforce the White House with walls, fences, and surveillance equipment. No joke. #TraitorTrump #TrumpRussia
We are under attack from within. I have absolutely no doubt that Trump's non-response to the pandemic is intentional. It's clear as day to me now. I probably won't sleep again tonight. #TrumpRussia #TraitorTrump #PutinsPuppet
Perfect cover for not sending badly needed #Covid19 resources to states and local governments. More money for the Rose Garden and the West Wing remodel. This is all starting to look highly intentional. Trump is killing Americans. #TraitorTrump #TreasonousTrump
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE THE USA A JOKE IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD....  TRUMP, MUST HAVE HIS HANDS UNTIED, AND ALL THE DEMOCRATS REMOVED NOW....  THE DEMOCRATS AND TURNCOATS, HAVE MEDIA POWER AND $$$$, BUT ARE WEAK AND THEIR POLICIES ARE A DISASTER....   DUMP, THE DEMOCRATS NOW....
THE MEDIA SHIFT WITH THE DEMOCRAT ESTABLISHMENT'S PROPAGANDA AGENDA, CAME IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND WAS FINALIZED IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION...   THE MEDIA IS THE MOST POWERFUL TOOL OF COMMUNISTS WORLDWIDE TO CONTROL SOCIETY...  ONLY TRUMP, AND THE MILITARY CAN STOP THIS...
THE PRESIDENT OF THE USA... SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A STRONG BUSINESS BACKGROUND OF PROVEN SUCCESS.  WE HAVE THE MOST QUALIFIED PRESIDENT, THAT AMERICA COULD EVER DREAM OF HAVING, IN PRESIDENT TRUMP.  DEMOCRATS ARE DESTROYING AMERICA, AND NEED TO BE REMOVED FROM OUR GOVERNMENT NOW.
Anyone and any company who fund Donald Trump share this in common, they are just like him.  Frauds, Liars, Cheaters, adulterers and hypocrites.  What hope does our constitution and freedoms have?  Not much... Mussolini, Putin &amp; Hitler &amp; Trump are their heroes.
Trump is the enemy of the people
Timeline of Trump‚Äôs Creepiness While He Owned Miss Universe ‚Äì Rolling Stone
Is that the only thing Trump said? Or is that just the one you want to hang onto?
Trump Has Destroyed U.S. Foreign Policy. His Only Goal Now Is Foreign Help for His Reelection.
WITH TRUMP AND THE MILITARY, IT WILL BE SETTING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC BACK ON LINE....  THE DEMOCRATS OVER SEVERAL DECADES, HAVE DERAILED OUR SYSTEM, AND WE NEED TO RE-BOOT THE SYSTEM, LESS THE DEMOCRATS CHANGES....   REMOVE THE DEMOCRATS NOW FOR TREASON....
I TRULY HOPE I AM WRONG....  I THINK BARR IS A BUSH BOY, AND THE DEMOCRATS QUESTIONING HIM, WAS JUST A PLOY....  THE ONLY HOPE, IS FOR TRUMP AND THE MILITARY, TO SAVE THE DAY FOR ALL OF US....
Daniel Goldman (Former Lead Counsel, House Impeachment Inquiry). He would get answers from Trump.
Trump hates this photo.
I heard on NPR that Trump's goons are still there, living in hotels, low key hiding.
fuck trump them bitches racist
Trump's Germany troops pullout may be his last gift to Putin before the election
no if trump isn't reelected it will be because of the power of Andrew Yang's campaign
My bad, the tweet I saw earlier had this photo attached, implying it was taken today. That Newsweek article was interesting. Somebody should tally up all of the costs of Trump's golfing excursions.
Gov. Ducey stopped listening to his teachers, sups, parents, and scientists.  He has been a Trump lackey.  I‚Äôm an Arizonan and there is a catastrophe in the making.  I fear for our families in this state.  I lay it at DeVos‚Äô feet as well.
Here's a recent example of Trump's secret police in action, in California.
I think one of the reasons Trump goes to his private golf clubs so often, is because he makes calls to Putin from there on his personal cell phone. I bet Secret Service would have stories to tell, if they could talk.
Trump wants to see how far he can get with his use of secret forces. They are all over this country, as we speak. And no, I am not a conspiracy theorist. Trump is gearing up. I totally agree with Rep. Clyburn - someone Trump has been targeting lately.
I kept waiting for a real answer from Dr. Birx during this excruciating interview. I know now that "Why" will never be answered, because she doesn't really work for us. She works for Donald Trump. Her job is to make him look good, while Americans die. #PandemicResponse #COVID19
I wonder how much it costs each time Trump goes golfing. Check out all of the Secret Service and all of their golf carts today in Virginia. Trump charges the American taxpayers for all of it. Disgusting. #TrumpIsLosing
The entire, inept Trump Administration is standing and watching this growing fire burn out of control, while skewing the data and leaving states to fend for themselves. The Vanity Fair article does not paint Dr. Birx in a good light. #PandemicResponse #Covid19
Stop whitewashing QAnon into a banal conspiracy theory that believes that Donald Trump is going to take down the deep state pedophiles.  It specifically claims JFK Jr is still alive, Debbie Wasserman Schulz got MS-13 to kill Seth Rich, all mass shootings are faked, etc
For how long now has Trump &amp; advisors wondered how a virus spreads between people?  The virus does not fly.  Feeding it more humans was not a good choice by Trump or advisors.  TikTok is now their enemy - another example or Trumps self serving job skills
Imagine trump permanently allowing your free speech.. Oh wait..this is why we are here. He supports it more than you.
He‚Äôs not a Christian, he‚Äôs a trump evangelical.
IF WE PRAY HARD TONIGHT AND TOMORROW, FOR AN END TO THIS DEMOCRAT MADNESS, AND CONTINUED REAPING OF THE AMERICAN DREAM BY DEMOCRATS...  MAYBE GOD WILL HELP US THIS WEEK.... BY HELPING TRUMP AND OUR MILITARY, DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE TRAITORS...  A DREAM, THAT MUST COME TRUE...
You do know that trump and Epstein were best friends, right?
I think the GOP and RNC are trying to avoid the public humiliation of thousands of empty seats in the convention hall. They don't want it to be televised. It might look like the low turnout for Trump in Florida yesterday.
I love trump.
Trump is hawking books and beans from the Oval Office, and Lindsey Graham just announced his support for a corporate takeover of TikTok by Microsoft. Who's to say you can't make a fortune while you're in office?  This is America! #HatchAct #TikTok
Millions of Americans are proud William Barr is the Trump families new fixer.    Only White Live Matter in their world for who knows what reason.
The sad part of AG Barr being Trumps new fixer is our nations future.  William Barr's arrogance tells honest Americans he is extremely PROUD to be the Trump Family fixer. To protect the Constitution and American Oath of Office he took makes him what?
SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENT OVER THE LAST 150 YEARS IS AMAZING, COMPARED WITH PAST TIMES....  LOOK AT US NOW, AND THE MESS WE ARE IN.... SCIENTIST ARE TRYING, BUT ARE DIVIDED WITH TREATMENT AND POLICIES.....  GET RID OF POLITICS, AND LET TRUMP AND THE MILITARY GET US BACK ON TRACK....
YES, AND SO DO THE DEMOCRATS THAT CONTROL OUR GOVERNMENT....   CRIMINALS PROTECT CRIMINALS.... THE DEMOCRATS LAWS PROTECT OTHER CRIMINALS....  WE NEED A CLEAN SWEEP.... STAND WITH TRUMP, AND PRAY HE GETS FULL MILITARY SUPPORT....  THE DEMS COMMUNIST TAKEOVER MUST BE STOPPED....
Please address the use of secret police forces by the Trump administration.
While Trump golfs and Mark Meadows lies, the eviction moratorium has ended, and supplemental unemployment benefits are gone, for millions of Americans in dire straits.  #EvictionCrisis #COVID19 #PUA #HEROESAct
IT IS TIME FOR TRUMP AND THE MILITARY TO TAKE TEMPORARY CONTROL OF THIS NATION, UNTIL FULL ORDER RETURNS AND THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY IS OVER...   CONGRESS IS DESTROYING OUR NATION...  SEARCH-OUT AND REMOVE ALL TRAITORS FROM OUR GOVERNMENT AND THEN RETURN TO THE ELECTION PROCESS...
WE DON'T WANT TO DIE....  ONLY DEPRESSED PEOPLE, OR PEOPLE TAKING ANTI-DEPRESSANTS WITH SUICIDAL SIDE-AFFECTS MAY NOT WANT TO LIVE....  STILL WE NEED TO LIVE A LIFE WORTH LIVING AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE KILLING US...  TRUMP AND THE MILITARY MUST REMOVE THE POWER FROM ALL TRAITORS...
Remember when Trump insisted on keeping his personal cell phone when he first took office? I think he calls Putin from his private golf club. Perfect set-up. #TraitorTrump
Trump gets high on Air Force One. Flying out of Florida....
Who is trump going to pick? I heard that Nikki Haley was in the running.
I would bet $100 that with in a few feet of tRUMP that day, there was, person, woman, man, camera, TV.
Why isn't this VP choice obviously a two (wo)man race?  Kamala Harris is the candidate you pick if you think the campaign needs energy.  Tammy Duckworth is the candidate you pick to do no harm (and maybe bait Trump).  Rice, Bass, Demings are all objectively bad picks.
Trump‚Äôs Unfitness For Office -
A LOT OF US DON'T HAVE MUCH, BUT WANT TO KEEP WHAT WE HAVE.  THAT INCLUDES, OUR FREEDOM AND LIBERTY THAT THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO TAKE FROM US, IN A VERY TREASONOUS FASHION.  THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NO MORALITY AND THAT MAKES THEM WRONG FOR AMERICA.    STAND WITH TRUMP, AND SAVE THE USA.
Let the Angels guide Trump and our nation, out from the clutches of the treasonous cult of Democrat deceivers...
JUST BECAUSE DEMOCRATS FEEL LAWLESSNESS IS OKAY, DOESN'T MEAN IT IS....  WILL THE MILITARY AND ALL OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT JUST DO THE RIGHT THING, AND STAND WITH TRUMP....  THE DEMOCRATS HAVE COMMITTED TREASON, AND MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE RIGHT NOW....  WHO WANTS A DEPRESSION....
THE PRESIDENT, WE HAVE IN TRUMP IS EXACTLY WHO ALL OF AMERICAS NEED RIGHT NOW...  HALF OF US KNOW THAT, AND THE OTHER HALF OF AMERICANS ARE NAIVE FOOLS...   SOMETIMES FOOLS NEED TO BE GENTLY PUSHED ASIDE, WHEN POSSIBLE TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT...  DUMP THE DEMOCRATS AND SAVE AMERICA...
Trump says he‚Äôll act to ban TikTok in U.S. as soon as Saturday  #SmartNews
It really isn‚Äôt the time for us to pick the running mate apart.  The goal is to defeat Trump in November.  We can do that best by being united.  There will be time after the war is won to sort out concerns.
Hogan is Governor of Maryland, Mary most likely is author/cousin Mary Trump, Karl is probably Karl Rove, and Absurd is the whole dang deal.
This photo has a foreshadowing aura to it. Storm clouds loom over Trump....
They certainly punished Morey for taking a side, which is again very bad! But no different from Trump's bullshit neutrality. And yet Josh Hawley is attacking LeBron and not Trump, because the crime is not the stance it's the hypocrisy.
If trump is against it, you have to know it‚Äôs the right thing to do.
One of the tabs in her binder says, "Goya." Another tab is labeled "Lies." Beans and Lies - The Trump White House.
I think Trump is terrified of losing because it will mean that Putin will be done with him. What then? Is he signaling for Russian interference? He's probably more than willing to work as an asset for four more years. He's safer in the White House, all the way around.
Too late now to start pretending to care about Democracy, Republicans. You had your chance to do that last year when you failed to remove Trump, despite the evidence. Now we've seen your true colours, and no one who truly values Democracy is going to vote for you. #yourefucked
Noteworthy that Trump is targeting one of John Lewis's best friends, the day after the funeral.
Been saying, surely someone asked for "Fuck Trump" or "Deez Nutz," right?
This article makes my blood boil. It's negligent homicide on a grand scale. Trump, Kushner, Pence, and Birx, et al. must be held accountable for this massive loss of life.
DESTROYING A PRESIDENCY FOR GLOBAL COMMUNISM BY DEMOCRAT COMRADES OF CHINA, RUSSIA, AND IRAN... BECOMES MORE OBVIOUS EACH DAY...  THE AMERICAN COMMUNIST CONSPIRACY OF WEALTHY AMERICANS, IS ABOUT TO ISSUE ITS FINAL BLOWS TO THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY...   WILL THE MILITARY STOP THIS???
Odds that Trump implies he might drop out of the race some time before the election?
Can't we just hear Donald Trump and Republican law makers whine if Obama was demanding election day to be  changed?
actually might have won 2020 if they had picked  but they picked a guy who doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground so my tea leafs tell me: this is a pretty simple victory for Trump come Nov 2020,  ...
Let's get one thing perfectly straight,  here in  turf next week we're holding Primaries and I've registered thousands,   and Trump wins November in a landslide. And anytime  runs into the gutter  fixes fast.
Why? Was he forced by gunpoint to attend Trump's bs rally? Was he threatened with bodily arm if he wore a mask? Was he chained up in a closet with a bucket and no connection to the outside world apart from Fox News? He was an adult with access to the same info as the rest of us.
Herman Cain died of #coronavirus exacerbated by  inadequate response. And his #TulsaRally2020 appearance. Don‚Äôt forget #MAGA2020 #MAGA Some think #Trump should be immediately removed from office.
The Republicans actually vote, The Democrats are out on streets throwing ice bottles and rocks at  or tweeting hate from Mamma's basement. There, as someone with superpowers at tea leafs, Trump wins November in a landslide.
Wow so weird that something that makes Kushner look capable and smart and makes Trump look like a giant dumb dumb would leak to the media
THE ONLY DIVISION.... PRESIDENT TRUMP CAUSED, WAS TO DIVIDE THE TRADE UNBALANCE, TO MAKE SURE AMERICA RECEIVED ITS FAIR SHARE....   THE DEMOCRATS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE POLITICAL DIVISION, COVID 19 DIVISION, RACIAL DIVISION, MURDERS, AND NATIONAL WIDE DESTRUCTION....
Right! Voting for Biden does damn little to reduce harm. A Biden presidency is sticking a band-aid on the sucking chest wound of our social ills - As bad as more Trump but at least we did something!
FOR AMERICA TO STAY THE MOST POWERFUL NATION ON EARTH....   AMERICA MUST REMAIN INTACT CONSTITUTIONALLY, WITHOUT CHANGE, OTHER THAN ENFORCING TREASON, FOR THE DEMOCRAT TRAITORS....  BEING THE MOST POWERFUL NATION GUARANTEES US OUR FREEDOM....  STAND BY TRUMP, TO STAY FREE....
Hey David, remember in 2016 they were accusing Donald Trump of this then. Who is it that could not accept the vote again? Any bets unless Biden is crushed the Democrats will do it again?
VOTER FRAUD IS UP AND RUNNING....   FIRST THE DEMOCRATS SOUGHT TO END, WAS THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.... THEN CHANGE BOUNDARIES, THEN THE CENSUS, THEN KEEP TRUMP OFF THE BALLAD IN DEMOCRAT STATES, AND THE LIST GOES ON....  MAIL IN VOTING WILL BE CORRUPT AS HELL...
No, no, no. Anyone who really thinks that will happen is delusional. Dropping out would require self-awareness, and the slightest grip on reality. Not to mention understanding of, and reverence for the Constitution. Trump has none of these.
ANY REPUBLICAN THAT SUPPORTS THE DEMOCRATS MAIL IN BALLADS FOR THE 2020 ELECTION, IS PART OF THE SWAMP....   THE GLOBALIST COMMUNIST INFESTATION IN AMERICA, IS THE SWAMP, AND MUST BE REMOVED BY THE MILITARY FOR TREASON....   TRUMP, MUST REMAIN PRESIDENT FOR AMERICA'S SURVIVAL....
No uh oh about that. Trump still has it, Ducey has lost it,  ... you want to see a Pandemic? Yeah shut down businesses, Churches, Schools in Southern Arizona. I promise you: THAT will give you one. And I'm really getting tired of $50+ a day helping hungry neighbors.
If Donald Trump had to guess the population of the United States he'd be off by
My wife and I are going to vote for president Trump because he is doing things that should have been done a long time ago but as always people reject changes no matter how great they are THANKS PRESIDENT TRUMP so sorry for the ones that are asleep
How will  the Epstein club members (Trump) explain the flight logs to Epstein's sex club locations?  (The list grows of planes)  These girls were paid little while Epstein's girl friend makes millions for her silence.

Trump says to delay election because of mail-in fraud. Election occurs 11/3 anyhow. Trump loses and blames fraud, refuses to step down while ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù. Widespread protests erupt. Trump stamps down. Shots fired. Shit hits the fan by Christmas 2020.

Anyone still supporting Trump seriously needs to be investigated immediately.   The donor list is a potential treasure trove of leads.  Birds of a feather flock together.
It happened in 2016, overload and disbelief.   Now it's happening again.   Trump really has created a shithole country, and these CaddyShack dweebs love it.  On masks, this is a peaceful protest of Fake News.  No masks, no distancing.  Loud message, liberate masks. It will go on

will Trump pardon him?
That‚Äôs just not true and the only one that says that is tRump.  You‚Äôre just selfish.
Worry about the hard Sanctions Trump put on them.  Joe will cancel those Sanctions on Iran &amp; maybe even give them another $ 1 Billion dollars like Obana / Biden did .   Just real facts &amp; Americans know You &amp; MSNBC will spin &amp; support Joe. China &amp; Iran
why are YOU Not talking on your Show about what China is doing to help Joe  Biden vs Russia / Trump ?   Is it Because  Hunter Biden is a employee of the Chinese Communist Army Party &amp; Iran is also working to get a Biden Elected &amp; then they can not have to
And Pence‚Äôs meeting w/ Ducey a week later had to be delayed after multiple Secret Service agents on the ground preparing for it tested positive. Never got confirmation if this is also why event was moved from Yuma to Phoenix less than 48 hours out.

President trump has really taught me the importance of knowing when to be serious and when to joke. I can‚Äôt wait to tell my kids the story of it all.
Trump is anti China until he gives millions of $$$s in bail outs to Chinese companies.
Trump said enough
I voted for the constitution party last time because I didn‚Äôt trust Trump and abhorred Hillary. This time, I‚Äôm more on board
Not if they're NOT legally allowed to vote and trying to play the system so their parents can fill their ballot out for them.  Do spout about anti democracy nonsense, if these people wanted their kids to vote for Trump youd be shrieking about voter fraud.
It might have been Buchanan I read about yesterday where Stone and Trump created a 3rd party.  I read something about this strategy yesterday.

Leave it to the left to try to find a way to excuse blatantly racist comments. If you know this man‚Äôs history, he meant what he said. Take step back from your liberal privilege and think about what would happen if Trump said this or asked a black man if he were a junkie.
Weissmann ran the "Mueller's" investigation, wrote the infamous public statement for Mueller, and wrote the report to smear Trump because he could not find or manufacture a crime.
Trump is down in the polls. The professor that predicted a trump win is predicting a Biden win. America trusts Biden with Covid and not Trump. Social media is cracking down on fakes and conspiracy theories. Trump is rambling incoherently and terrified.  WE ARE WINNING! #Biden2020

Funny how educated people would protest a republican all things considered. tRump said it himself is he loves the ignorant.
Let‚Äôs see, he plead guilty in a court of law and is only not sitting in jail because tRump dangled parsons and has his shill Barr reach in to tip the scales. It‚Äôs a criminal enterprise and even a blind person can see this. tRump and Barr are doing this out in the open.
Translation: why not have the moderators debate Trump while Biden stares off at a distance.

Brown person here: you know, my people called Obama the deporter in chief.  Obama singed off on: Indefinite detention Child separation Gassing migrants Mass deportations  Obama was Trump but smooth.
So, tRump is OK with mail in ballots in Fl.  I have to ask myself why. What BS are you and your cronies going to pull? Better not even be the appearance of rigging and all votes shall be counted. Non of this ‚Äúit‚Äôs taking to long so we‚Äôre going to have some judge call it for tRump

No, no he doesn‚Äôt Chuck and tRump needs to go before the election. I don‚Äôt know if Americans can hang on until we get him and all the repubs who enable him out of office.

Mueller's statement that Trump was not exonerated by this report was unethical, unprofessional, and a violation of DOJ policy; this was pure politics. Remember, if they can do it to him they can do it to you.
He said to Barr and Rosenstein (in front of other witnesses) the DOJ policy was not the reason he did not charge or consider charging Trump. He does not have the power to exonerate, he has the power to find violations of law and prosecute them.
To Trump, not finding a violation of the law, is exoneration. Mueller's statement on exoneration is unprofessional and highlights the corruption attached to the entire probe.
Here's one.
His office withdrew such statements later, as he had already told Barr and Rosenstein that he did not consider DOJ policy when determining to charge. Saying Trump was not exonerated violated basic DOJ principals as it's not his job to exonerate, only find violations; corrupt.
The Adults are under arrest, crossing the border at other than a port of entry is a felony. The minors have been separated since the 90s, Trump is simply the only one who got the blame and finally found a way around the mandated procedure.

That Trump is taking off my drug prices have gone down I pay less than 50% of what they were during the Obama Administration. So that tells you whis dwug prwices are coming down.  Americans are no longer paying for the Indigent at the pharmacy like we were with Obama.
Nice to see that hate it what drives you. Thanks to dumbocrats 90% of America is on lock down as you cheer it on just to blame Trump, who had nothing to do with it.  The silent majority will rise up Nov 3rd...
Oh, the irony of a Trump supporter calling someone else a sheep is fucking hysterical.
Republicans are telling their voters to vote by mail.  Come November 15th trump will claim that his voters didn't have their votes counted because the Post Office didn't get the ballots delivered on time.  Another trump created crisis then complain about the problem he created.
You know it‚Äôs real simple just say don‚Äôt open the schools. This woman should be put in jail for her negligence in her position along with Trump.
I was forced to watch Trump's Texas speech.  He claimed he created thousands of new energy jobs for Texas.  The new energy jobs in Texas have been in wind power.  Texas leads the country in the production of wind power.
Jake, why doesn't Trump just declare these protests That way you guys would get off his back.
You are laughable. Obama told Russia "Putin" I'll be more flexible in my next term. Trump THE most harshest on Russia (PUTIN) as a businessman never reveals his hand. Enjoy your koolaid..
Is she talking about Trump?
Come at me with facts.  You lost an election you can't accept.  Trump's playing field has been so lopsided, everytime he gains ground you dumbocrats move the goal posts, yet he persiveers.
Nice to see another drinking that CNN Kool-Aid. No, you're the one who thinks Trump ran against Obama when it was Hillary Clinton that was running on Obama's failures/merits....

Trump is the least worried about the election it was the same b******* four years ago everybody said he was going to lose you was nowhere near in the poles and yet the Electoral College who has a brain elected him let's hope the same this time.
Why is it Republicans carry Flags proudly and Democrats stop on them and burn them Democrats are so unhappy go to another country because as Donald Trump says this is the greatest country in the world
I don't think Trump understands that we don't have national elections.  We have state elections.  Each state votes.  They send representatives to each State House in December to elect the President.  There are no elections where the Federal Government has any control.

Just imagine how wonderful it‚Äôs going to be when Trump wins by a landslide because of vote by mail. Or perhaps there will have to be a second round of voting because the voter fraud is so apparent and wide spread. Trump remains in office while Biden hides and hopes.

The real problem with Trump taking over the post office isn't their being able to deliver the ballots to the ballot box. It's whether they be delivered to the voters in the first place. Their goal is to keep ballots out of voters hands in the first place.
I‚Äôve never understood opposition to the wall. I get hating Trump. I get hating Republicans. But hating the wall is literally just embracing chaos and lawlessness.

Only the Lord knows for sure but I have a strong hunch Trump will emerge victorious.
Bob Mueller did a great job investigating Trumps crimes and publishing his report. Trumps people secretly met with Russians 100 times and lied about it to the FBI and to Congress. Trump will be prosecuted for his criminal activity with the Russians.
Neither Biden or Trump. I vote on myself. I won‚Äôt rely on a white Supremacist to do a darn thing for me or my people.

These are the people Trump hangs with who give him advice &amp; seek favors. Biden hangs out with Americans who are actually struggling: workers, teachers, nurses, small business owners, factory workers, farmers, postal workers, vets.
Trump should know this.  Is he suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment?
Please pray for the millions of Americans who had their unemployment cut by 70% because  didn‚Äôt do her job. Very soon we won‚Äôt be able to feed our children, pay our bills, and keep our houses. Meanwhile Trump is golfing
Trump teases order requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions - He must be suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment.
While we clutch our pearls, trump continues doing what he does best. ‚ÄúMerchandising ‚Äú( must be said with Mel Brooks voice).  And cheating. There is NO substance, anywhere.  Ever.   (But substance is apparently irrelevant in a post-truth world.)
The Dems siding with Trump again!
That's a lot of taxpayer money being spent at Trump properties, that he profits from.   Trump takes lots of breaks and lots of vacations, the point of the entire thread was that he is making more than he is donating.

You sure point fingers at Trump but I'm still waiting to see what you will promise to do if elected for the next 4 years??? You have already had 36 years in politics and 8 years as VP. So if you didn't do much so those years, why would I elect you to do nothing next 4?
Nah. Leadership was President Obama doing it TEN YEARS ago. The opposite of leadership is Trump suing in court to eliminate the pre-existing conditions clause in Obamacare.
They know trump supporters are that stupid. That‚Äôs who this is directed at, which is kinda silly since trump already has their votes. Maybe they‚Äôll capture a few more dummy‚Äôs though.

a Racist pig.. and now ship full of ammonium nitrate float around the sea to bring it death to a Port  the vessel called ‚ÄúTrump D‚Äù
Do you really think that Americans are that naive and gullible to accept all the lies that team Trump spin? It seems to get worse and more outrageous as the election looms closer. All Americans must stand together and end this nightmare.
Right on. It's about time Trump is held accountable.
how is it that People hate Trump so bad that they are blinded by it, that they don't see Biden can't even breath a fully coherent sentence. This makes Biden more dangerous. Either way, if he wins or not won't change anything, it won't make bad people good again or stop violence
They know. They're counting on tRump supporters to be their usual idiotic selves and believe the bs.
Are you serious? We have had protections for pre existing conditions since Obama. Trump is currently in court trying to strip them away.
Can we allow this?
I believe this is happening due to rumors that the Trump Administration was going to allow insurance companies to impose pre existing conditions in their coverage again if Trump is elected.
Trump and the GOP truly believe the most dangerous threat we face is Tik-Tok...  Let that sink in  #TikTok
Trump is a big time Dick.
Trump really called Covid-19 ‚ÄúKung-Flu‚Äù üíÄ
What B.S. Your lead should be that Trump is promising something that is already covered by Obamacare.
Trump is a jack ass and so are his golf members. They're all jack asses.

If he was doing it the right way, he'd request legislation through Congress, instead of acting like a dictator and issuing an Executive Order. By the way, we already have this, it's called ACA and Trump hates it.

But the ballots will still be mailed and filled out and returned against him. What it shows most clearly is Trump‚Äôs utter desperation. He knows he‚Äôs going to lose and so has nothing to lose. But it‚Äôs only cementing the result.

It must be tough being a store window mannequin like you.    According to the Constitution, the DOJ should be going after your owner, Trump for impersonating a physician by giving treatment advice that he‚Äôs not qualified to give.  Fall fashions are on their way.

So now senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa are teaming up with Russia to spread negative information about Joe Biden. I am now convinced that Russia not only paid Trump, but that they paid every Republican in Congress. House and Senate. #Traitors

They're both right.  Republicans who still hold onto the possibility of unrigged elections are worried.  Republicans who are comforted by knowing that every stop is being pulled to ensure a Trump victory (or continuation of power) aren't worried.
The Trump family are corrupt, unfeeling &amp; care nothing about the USA, our planet, or animals.  His two sons have killed tons of them. Not in the wild though. They paid BIG MONEY to kill them in a fenced in "hunting preserve" where they had no chance.
I would get in line right now and wait in line until November 3rd to vote against Trump.
I just love this country. Trump has actively tried to get rid of Obamacare... Which requires insurances cover people with preexisting conditions. Now he is taking credit for something aleady happening, that's he's trying to get rid of.

Biden has committed to selecting a woman as his rm. Looks to be between Kamala and Susan Rice. Either of them against Trump would be a massive improvement for Dems, particularly considering the current social climate.
I will not (and did not) vote for Trump. Biden, however, is not fit to lead. His recent racist gaffe and every other senseless, incoherent thing he says is evidence. He's 77. How can we possibly take his candidacy seriously?  Then a thought occurred to me.
Informed Christians will vote for Trump. We don't want a theocracy. We just want our freedoms and Trump's policies are doing just that.

B. As we‚Äôve seen with  #NortheastCanyons and #Seamounts, trump is more than willing to open up protected areas for industrial exploration, so trump does not get the benefit of the doubt. /2-fin
And Trump the virus is still occupying the White House.
Okay, now we can add rapist to charges against  we already know is a liar, traitor, racist and narsastic lunatic.  Judge refuses president's request to delay defamation suit brought by E Jean Carroll.   via
I'm saying it is a hell of a gamble to let Trump win and then *hope* you can remove him from office, then it is to elect Biden and then hope you can outflank him politically
I think I'm at the end of my rope with Trump, the GOP, and trumpsters!!! They ALL make me sick to my stomach!!!
I doubt there‚Äôs any accident in this. In fact, I bet the same reason accounts for the supposed drop in AZ positive cases of late. Team trump is not to be trusted and his minions are everywhere.
A. While  is a definitely a thing, mining is not an activity that is a vacuum. There‚Äôs this thing called called wind and these things called roads that surround it.  You can read more about trump‚Äôs willingness to entertain the idea. /1
No one here wants that POS anymore... we actually wanted him in jail, but tRUmp messed that up for us.
I would.
Trumptastic news!  Trump strips the AHA,  attempts to give back pieces,  sycophants spread the news, and  wants praise and adulation.    This IS the school yard bully stealing your jacket, getting off on watching you freeze, then giving it back expecting gratitude.  #ETTD
You're assuming, again, that Trump gets removed from office.  That's a *very* big assumption to make.
He taught his kids the same criminal activity his father taught him. They've gotten away with it because no one has ever looked into it.  If Trump under valued property to pay less taxes, they did as well. If he overvalued to get loans, so did they.  It's a family crime syndicate
No.... Trump fucked kids with Epstein closer to home.  In Palm Beach and NYC.  Why would I care if Dems are guilty, too?  They should all swing, along with Trump.
Even the very leftist msm is reporting this...
Donald Trump will say or do anything in order to attempt to sway the 2020 election. I‚Äôve found the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation regarding any news of Coronavirus vaccine trustworthy. Also my longtime professional relationship with a  physician informs me.
You say that, governor, because you have done a terrible job handling the pandemic because you followed Trump‚Äôs incompetent lead. What you ought to do is resign for failing us.
Trump swears all the time tho in front of children
The thread started with someone literally quoting Biden and posting a video of him speaking uninterrupted for 23 seconds.  You turned that into a Trump-bashing, which prompted my reply to you, as there was more than stuttering to fault in Biden's statement.  The rest followed...
üö®üö®üö®HUGE NEWSüö®üö®üö®  Trump is taking credit for what Barack Obama did 10 years ago! (And it's going to work because this country is irreparably broken.)
You're assuming that we'll still have elections at the end of a second Trump term.
It was a rally... only called a "press conference" so Trump could fleece American taxpayers
NOBODY would want to do the kind of job Trump has done with the #TrumpVirus  2+ million more cases than any other country in the world and 3 times the deaths of Americans in Vietnam War  #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER
Trump is a Putin puppet.
They need to change their focus. Go after the kids. No immunity. What involvement did they have while at Trump Org? Fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, etc. Indict the kids. The rest will crumble.
My former state, Illinois, has been in thrall to the Union-pension trap; Trump taking away their ability to have all of us pay (due to former deductibility of state/local taxes) exposed this. No reg politician could get that done. Bravo.
Would Democrats sue the President in order to reverse an executive order to extend  unemployment benefits in the middle of a pandemic?
Our democracy is dead unless we get trump and his supporters out of office.
Do you really think that'll be prevented by Trump having a second term, though?
You can't read, Biden!  Nobody has proposed mining inside Grand Canyon National Park  That said, as someone who worked at GCNP for several years, the old uranium mine near Powell Point was abandoned years ago because it was low grade  #Trump #Covid_19 #Testing #TX #AZ #Results
My heart and love go out to the family of this man.  And to all those, tbh, who suffer or die because  Gov Ducey has his head shoved so far up Donald Trump‚Äôs a**! RIPüôèüèΩ
So basically we have a telsa vs edsison sitch here where obama did the work and now trump is trying to take credit after the fact...its the inherited economy all over again.
You've been dodging me repeatedly throughout this thread, as I've been discussing the original topic.  Somehow THAT'S OK, but if I don't let you cattle-prod me into changing the entire thread to a critique of Trump, I'M the one who is supposedly dodging?  A Yale tactic, Gordon?
Fine, but if your other response you were referring to actually answered my question in that tweet, I didn't see it.  I didn't "diagnose" Biden, while you DID post a diagnosis of psychiatric and other mental disorders Trump supposedly has.  The thread MUST be about Trump-bashing.
The past 4 years with Trump has been a nightmare, a disaster.  Trump‚Äôs causes so much damage to our Country. It will take many years for us to recover.
100 have died from hydroxychloroquine poisoning since Trump promoted it.
No wonder he was never upset about Trump!
We are giving China a slow death by thousand cuts. Excellent strategy that can minimize our cost of war against the evil! Trump is our modern time dragon slayer!

Because BLM had nothing to do with the number of tests available, the length of time we are still waiting for results or the fact that masks weren‚Äôt mandatory from the beginning. Many in BLM wore mask - not so at Trump‚Äôs rally.
Congrats trump supporters you played your self..
You're illustrating my point with that question.  YOU brought up Mary Trump in response to something irrelevant, then ducked my question about why you brought her up. You strawman every comment about Biden into a Trump endorsement, and try to re-frame the thread for your benefit.
I don‚Äôt disagree. I think part of what endears Trump to his supporters is his casual, politically incorrect nature. My point is simply that there‚Äôs a huge difference between misspeaking &amp; being deceitful. But regardless of what the standard is it has to be applied evenly.arizona plz stand up to trump he cant ruin our grand canyon
Swan‚Äôs interview of Trump on Axios is cool but have you ever listened to Kendrick Lamar interview Tupac on TPAB?
I can‚Äôt believe a man with no postal service is running the USPS and fired his experienced top people. Welcome to Donald Trump‚Äôs America- where anyone with bucks who can kiss Trump‚Äôs butt can do anything they‚Äôre not remotely qualified to do!
Clearly a Trump supporter.
Had a conversation with an obvious Trump supporter. She complained that people have to get back to work that the U.S. is not a socialist country. She then complained about the lack of affordable housing for low income/homeless people.
Sadly I do know a few. But I‚Äôm working hard to change their minds. But honestly, it‚Äôs President Trump that is getting their attention. Most of them like what he‚Äôs been doing / saying the past month.
Fewer Trump voters come election time!!!
You are a disgrace to America, your family, the entertainment industry, and your race. There is enough unrest in our country without you pulling this crap. You deserve to be completely blackballed!
Hell yeah we are voting trump we need border wall in Arizona and deport all illegals!!
The real problem with Trump taking over the post office isn't their being able to deliver the ballots to the ballot box. It's whether they be delivered to the voters in the first place. Their goal is to keep ballots out of voters hands in the first place.
I‚Äôve never understood opposition to the wall. I get hating Trump. I get hating Republicans. But hating the wall is literally just embracing chaos and lawlessness.
I think he meant to say "supporters" of tRump...
And you have been waging an anti-Trump campaign for 4 years.
This thread is about the comparison of the Millions more in taxpayer money spent at Trump properties versus the amount he allegedly donates.   You keep bringing up stuff that has nothing to do with this thread, that's highjacking.
It looks like the big Bernie flips didn‚Äôt get what they thought Trump promised and are done with him.
Voting For Trump Is Going To FEEL GOOD, 2020 Might Surprise EVERYONE  via
Boy! These people are so corrupt. Comey was right when he compared Trump to a Mafia don.
The Steele dossier and Mueller Report contain strong evidence of Trumps crimes. Trump is not innocent, he‚Äôs not vindicated, not exonerated. The case against Trump is not closed. Trump will be prosecuted for his crimes.
Yeah your typical western evangelicals are on some cult level shit when it comes to Trump. They defend all of his trangressions and still believe he was called by god to make America great.....for......them.
Only the Lord knows for sure but I have a strong hunch Trump will emerge victorious.
Bob Mueller did a great job investigating Trumps crimes and publishing his report. Trumps people secretly met with Russians 100 times and lied about it to the FBI and to Congress. Trump will be prosecuted for his criminal activity with the Russians.
Neither Biden or Trump. I vote on myself. I won‚Äôt rely on a white Supremacist to do a darn thing for me or my people.
The last thing we need is another politician ignoring a pandemic bc you‚Äôre excited that Trump paid attention to you. I lost my dad today bc you are weak and care more about yourself than our community. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre termed out. But that won‚Äôt bring my dad back.
witness tampering and other charges.  Trump will imprisoned for years and years for his crimes.
Sadly yes and the reasoning was it‚Äôs a better choice then Trump I asked in what ways.... cricket cricket ü§Ø
Trump has been money laundering for the Russians for years. Trump will face multiple counts of money laundering, racketeering, bank fraud, fraud, attempted fraud, tax fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to commit fraud, jury tampering ...
I met some1 tonight at our weekly ‚ÄúTrump Friday‚Äù social that showed me all the key damage, dents from pellet gun and more damage because his license plate says TRUMPUS
this ice documentary has me so fucked up right now but it lit a fire in me to know what goes on every day while were at home watching tv not worried ... i would kill before they took my child from me ‚Äúimmigration nation‚Äù FUCK DONALD TRUMP
You people are so wierd they already are. And Trump loves communists leaders. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it. Trump loves commies but they are bad so let‚Äôs look away while he kisses their butt.
Trump used Rudy &amp; . Lev Parnas to do his dirty work in Ukraine. That‚Äôs racketeering. He twisted the Ukraine president‚Äôs arm to interfere in our election. That‚Äôs election fraud. He‚Äôll be prosecuted for multiple counts of racketeering and election fraud. He be imprisoned for years
These are the people Trump hangs with who give him advice &amp; seek favors. Biden hangs out with Americans who are actually struggling: workers, teachers, nurses, small business owners, factory workers, farmers, postal workers, vets.
Trump really is just killing democracy faster than an foreign enemy.
Trump should know this.  Is he suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment?
Please pray for the millions of Americans who had their unemployment cut by 70% because  didn‚Äôt do her job. Very soon we won‚Äôt be able to feed our children, pay our bills, and keep our houses. Meanwhile Trump is golfing
I agree!   I  was invited to a Christmas party at the White House and  took a rain check for 7 years until some other President was there. The night President Trump was ellected, I called my daughter to clame my rain check.  and I had the best time in my life.
Trump teases order requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions - He must be suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment.
This a Trump trash type statement that is beneath the office he was elected to by the people of ARIZONA.   Shameful display of pettiness and gaslighting.
While we clutch our pearls, trump continues doing what he does best. ‚ÄúMerchandising ‚Äú( must be said with Mel Brooks voice).  And cheating. There is NO substance, anywhere.  Ever.   (But substance is apparently irrelevant in a post-truth world.)
The Dems siding with Trump again!
That's a lot of taxpayer money being spent at Trump properties, that he profits from.   Trump takes lots of breaks and lots of vacations, the point of the entire thread was that he is making more than he is donating.

You can‚Äôt make my words mean what you want them to mean because I will never support Donald Trump. I will never support any man that talks about women the way he does. I don‚Äôt care what you think is great about him. You lose me at, ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre a star you can do anything . . .‚Äù
Poorer than trump‚Äôs daddy bought degree? Please!
Yes. Fact is, the constituency that elected Trump is still behind him, and it has grown. The media polls are designed to discourage that constituency, but we‚Äôre still fired up.
So much for the added value of a Trump pardon ü§≠
Trump failure. Repubs fail to agree on a plan. Americans are dying and out of work. The DEMS HAVE A PLAN. The Dems have unified bill and aporoach to help people. The Repubs REFUSE the bill.  The US is approaching 5 million coronavirus cases
This pretty much sums up the Trump Administration.
well it would be funny to have adult businesses only open in republican states just to show the divide between the two logic....and somehow they would blame trump..to funny
Trump campaign has two candidates. An INVALID ONE, and a FAKE POTUS
Attacked relentlessly for corruption and avoiding accountability for his actions..... kind of an important piece they left out because he‚Äôs fighting for himself, against these investigations into his conduct as POTUS.... NOT fighting for America  Donald Trump ‚â† America
Donald Trump is already doing that......... next, ho
The Repubs in the Senate are a mess. The Dems have a strong plan and a bill to help Americans. The Repubs refuse to help people. Period.Trump copies Obama.Repub party has disappeared.   Trump lays out planned executive orders after stimulus talks fail
Joe, please explain to us how you get credit for the growing economy, but not the blame for turning Libya into a bombed-out slave-market shithole.  If all you can do is have people script stuff for you linking you to Obama and bashing Trump, you're going to lose, and deserve to.
Amazon has nothing to do with it, Trump is jealous of Bazos end of story. Why he put one of his people in I‚Äôm not sure but I bet we‚Äôll find out.
Prayers now for our President Trump IJN Amen
I dont pay to much attention untill one month before the race . I can hear everything they say and have said then.
Shocker. Most trump fans on Twitter are bots
The next 3 months Trump, with enormous help from Russia, FOX, &amp; OANN will try &amp; demonize Biden &amp; his VP pick. They'll try &amp; get us to stay home. We need to remember that our whole democracy is at stake &amp; come out &amp; vote Blue down the ticket - Biden &amp; every Senate race!
The weren‚Äôt added they were closed for the virus and reopened  not added . Trump is just Stupid
Trump is losing it (even more than usual) His supporters carry that burden by trying to be even more aggressive and enabling. Fuck outta here. America is a progressive nation. We PROGRESS. We make PROGRESS. We become tolerant of things, we learn to live with other people.
So this may be where we all ask, is it actually Microsoft that‚Äôs the driving force behind the ban and possible subsequent forced sale of #TikTok, and trump is the enabler/puppet?
You sure point fingers at Trump but I'm still waiting to see what you will promise to do if elected for the next 4 years??? You have already had 36 years in politics and 8 years as VP. So if you didn't do much so those years, why would I elect you to do nothing next 4?
Nah. Leadership was President Obama doing it TEN YEARS ago. The opposite of leadership is Trump suing in court to eliminate the pre-existing conditions clause in Obamacare.
They know trump supporters are that stupid. That‚Äôs who this is directed at, which is kinda silly since trump already has their votes. Maybe they‚Äôll capture a few more dummy‚Äôs though.
Yo Donny guess what? By Election Day your support won‚Äôt top 28% &amp; your sorry pathetic ass sinks. So don‚Äôt say you never heard that, OK? By March, all the remaining GOP in Congress will continuously repeat 2 words ‚ÄúTrump who?‚Äù
Agree. This is a tough one . I live in #MaricopaCounty and spent 2018-door knocking for #Dems . The Latino community has PTSD from horrible #Arpio and #Trump is worse. They are scared. Difficult to engage.

Trump!
I‚Äôm sorry but you chose to lose your freedom when you voted for #Trump. #PutinOwnsTrump
and yet, you still can‚Äôt show proof of trump-russia collusion..
Trump explained it was a peaceful protest to the Press at this PRESS CONFERENCE  Guess You Didn't Know That, Hilltards LOL
And btw, I have a student loan and got the notification when he suspended it earlier... payments and interest accrual are paused. Schumer was full of sh*t when he said we‚Äôd all end up owing more. It‚Äôs literally paused. Trump will extend that pause.
i would call myself a republican, and i used to not like you because you were a democrat, but the more i saw the way trump acts, and the more i heard you talk, i became more of a fan, make no mistake, i cant agree with you on stuff, but i hope you can get us out of this mess
So true David. And now they have the Tea Party guy Mark Meadows and Munichin doing the negotiating? The Repub Senators are in disarray.  They have no plan they can agree on. They are handing this to  trump.
Republican would like to See the postal service close down on Trump word becasue he want to cheat the election. And we all know there is NO mAil-in ballot fraud! And you can‚Äôt provide any proof
You tweet more than Trump
Absolutely. They are project Lincoln, not #VoteBlueNoMatterWho bcuz they hope to revive their party. They aren‚Äôt supporting our ideals. They are trying to get rid of Trump. Working w/ Reps to promote our ideals or win is different than giving money. Give to  #AZ08
Yes, something is very wrong. He has had his nose too far up Trump's ass. It's making him delirious.
Omg. Now trump suggests ideas that already exist in the Affordable Care Act and acts like these are new ideas????  "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
I've already said that she does not represent me.  She reeks of Donald Trump.    I want you to represent #Arizona, you up for that challenge?
Wait. You guys dragged Obama for this when the ACA was passed. Now you‚Äôre praising Trump for it after it‚Äôs already law? WTAF?! Is the right going to Trump too now that he ‚Äúsupports‚Äù this? Doubt that

Do you really think that Americans are that naive and gullible to accept all the lies that team Trump spin? It seems to get worse and more outrageous as the election looms closer. All Americans must stand together and end this nightmare.
Right on. It's about time Trump is held accountable.
how is it that People hate Trump so bad that they are blinded by it, that they don't see Biden can't even breath a fully coherent sentence. This makes Biden more dangerous. Either way, if he wins or not won't change anything, it won't make bad people good again or stop violence
They know. They're counting on tRump supporters to be their usual idiotic selves and believe the bs.
Are you serious? We have had protections for pre existing conditions since Obama. Trump is currently in court trying to strip them away.
Can we allow this?
I believe this is happening due to rumors that the Trump Administration was going to allow insurance companies to impose pre existing conditions in their coverage again if Trump is elected.
Trump and the GOP truly believe the most dangerous threat we face is Tik-Tok...  Let that sink in  #TikTok
Trump is a big time Dick.
Trump really called Covid-19 ‚ÄúKung-Flu‚Äù üíÄ
What B.S. Your lead should be that Trump is promising something that is already covered by Obamacare.

Trump administration crooked without a conscience!!! They lie and break the laws in plain view!!!
Will the payroll tax cuts and trump‚Äôs executive orders move the needle at all in the polls and more importantly with helping workers and consumers?
In California, American pastors can get arrested for doing their jobs but illegal aliens get taxpayer-funded stimulus checks for being unemployed.  That will be the reality for all of America if Donald Trump does not win in November.

Alexa, define the Trump administration in 22 words.
If he was doing it the right way, he'd request legislation through Congress, instead of acting like a dictator and issuing an Executive Order. By the way, we already have this, it's called ACA and Trump hates it.

But the ballots will still be mailed and filled out and returned against him. What it shows most clearly is Trump‚Äôs utter desperation. He knows he‚Äôs going to lose and so has nothing to lose. But it‚Äôs only cementing the result.

They're both right.  Republicans who still hold onto the possibility of unrigged elections are worried.  Republicans who are comforted by knowing that every stop is being pulled to ensure a Trump victory (or continuation of power) aren't worried.
The Trump family are corrupt, unfeeling &amp; care nothing about the USA, our planet, or animals.  His two sons have killed tons of them. Not in the wild though. They paid BIG MONEY to kill them in a fenced in "hunting preserve" where they had no chance.
I would get in line right now and wait in line until November 3rd to vote against Trump.
I just love this country. Trump has actively tried to get rid of Obamacare... Which requires insurances cover people with preexisting conditions. Now he is taking credit for something aleady happening, that's he's trying to get rid of.

Of course China wants Biden. Can you see that dope at a negotiating table with China? Trump is an egomaniacal freak, but I trust his ability to negotiate trade deals. Unequivocally more qualified than Biden.

It wasn't China who ignored a pandemic, lied about it, called it a hoax, and did nothing about it for political reasons. It wasn't China who won't help the people with an adequate stimulus plan. It isn't China who won't do a rent and eviction freeze.  This is all on Trump.

Note to Dr Fauci,, that you stand next to Donald Trump making jokes about a subject you yourself have bastardized by often giving misleading information only designed to bolster the bully previously mentioned,  has NOT helped people make more informed decisions.
Biden has committed to selecting a woman as his rm. Looks to be between Kamala and Susan Rice. Either of them against Trump would be a massive improvement for Dems, particularly considering the current social climate.
I will not (and did not) vote for Trump. Biden, however, is not fit to lead. His recent racist gaffe and every other senseless, incoherent thing he says is evidence. He's 77. How can we possibly take his candidacy seriously?  Then a thought occurred to me.

Trump is a Putin puppet.
They need to change their focus. Go after the kids. No immunity. What involvement did they have while at Trump Org? Fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, etc. Indict the kids. The rest will crumble.
BS like this only makes me more determined to get Trump elected........Corrupt haters like twitter and facebook give a voice to America and then censors what they dont want heard.
My former state, Illinois, has been in thrall to the Union-pension trap; Trump taking away their ability to have all of us pay (due to former deductibility of state/local taxes) exposed this. No reg politician could get that done. Bravo.
Would Democrats sue the President in order to reverse an executive order to extend  unemployment benefits in the middle of a pandemic?
Our democracy is dead unless we get trump and his supporters out of office.
Do you really think that'll be prevented by Trump having a second term, though?
You can't read, Biden!  Nobody has proposed mining inside Grand Canyon National Park  That said, as someone who worked at GCNP for several years, the old uranium mine near Powell Point was abandoned years ago because it was low grade  #Trump #Covid_19 #Testing #TX #AZ #Results
My heart and love go out to the family of this man.  And to all those, tbh, who suffer or die because  Gov Ducey has his head shoved so far up Donald Trump‚Äôs a**! RIPüôèüèΩ
So basically we have a telsa vs edsison sitch here where obama did the work and now trump is trying to take credit after the fact...its the inherited economy all over again.

You've been dodging me repeatedly throughout this thread, as I've been discussing the original topic.  Somehow THAT'S OK, but if I don't let you cattle-prod me into changing the entire thread to a critique of Trump, I'M the one who is supposedly dodging?  A Yale tactic, Gordon?

Independent thinker?  King of an oxymoron don‚Äôt ya think? You are the complete opposite and have been blinded by your hate for Trump because of all the lies you‚Äôve been fed like a sheep.
Fine, but if your other response you were referring to actually answered my question in that tweet, I didn't see it.  I didn't "diagnose" Biden, while you DID post a diagnosis of psychiatric and other mental disorders Trump supposedly has.  The thread MUST be about Trump-bashing.
The past 4 years with Trump has been a nightmare, a disaster.  Trump‚Äôs causes so much damage to our Country. It will take many years for us to recover.
I'm with China and Iran on this one.  U.S. intel: Russia trying to hurt Biden, but China, Iran don't want Trump

Because BLM had nothing to do with the number of tests available, the length of time we are still waiting for results or the fact that masks weren‚Äôt mandatory from the beginning. Many in BLM wore mask - not so at Trump‚Äôs rally.
Congrats trump supporters you played your self..
You're illustrating my point with that question.  YOU brought up Mary Trump in response to something irrelevant, then ducked my question about why you brought her up. You strawman every comment about Biden into a Trump endorsement, and try to re-frame the thread for your benefit.
I don‚Äôt disagree. I think part of what endears Trump to his supporters is his casual, politically incorrect nature. My point is simply that there‚Äôs a huge difference between misspeaking &amp; being deceitful. But regardless of what the standard is it has to be applied evenly.
Trump is responsible for the death of 160,000 Americans. Trump should be prosecuted for murder.
The advice to Trump on how to fix it plus the words of praise for Haley and Pence definitely led me to think this was an effort to help him. Yes.

Actually I don't like Trump either lol try again
Yeah cause Trump made it better. You‚Äôre party is trying to destroy all of that.
Like everything else I guess  Trump turned opening schools political. But of course it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs about safety and nothing more. I can‚Äôt imagine after is political. They are kids and teachers and staff and when we know it is safe they go back. Why is that an issue
Again, you keep talking about diagnoses and disqualifications, which is all strawmanning. The "whataboutism" is on YOUR side, trying to exempt Biden from any scrutiny because he deserves coronation simply for Not Being Trump.  Millions won't ignore the elephant in the room, dude.
It is possible, Trump and family, and cronies are making money off of all of the hospitalizations occurring from the COVID-19 pandemic. In my opinion, that could be one reason why Trump and the Republicans have not come up with a national strategy to stop the pandemic. Money.
Imagine being so ignorant, and stupid that you think this is about Trump. It's about my country, Trump is just the person in charge right now.
Fred Trump‚Äôs idiot son Donald is a traitor to America. FredTrump‚Äôs moron son Donald is a mass murderer. He is responsible for 160,000 American deaths. Fred‚Äôs dumb son Donald is a puppet for Putin. Putin pays to have American soldiers killed &amp; weak Donald does nothing. TrumpVirus
He is as heartless as Trump

What does that even mean?  You left the vast majority of your Twitter 280 unused in the process of posting a three-word tweet that is ambiguous at best.  Can you do ANYTHING besides bitch about Trump?

Yep, and Trump is going to weaponize that report that came out tonight: ‚ÄúChina wants Biden, China wants Biden!‚Äù.
Definitely not, it's actually far worse. Start with over 160,000 dead due to Trump's inaction. Huge Federal debt, escalating crime against racial minorities, massive unemployment and reduced living conditions are just part of Trump's legacy
Is she Trump's personal physician, or even a physician at all?  What's your point in bringing her up, apart from a "sling all the mud you can at the wall, and hope some of it sticks" tactic as part of trying to divert every discussion into a referendum on Trump personally?
I wish people would stop telling me to vote for Biden just because they don't want Trump to win, that's not going to make me want to vote for the 1st time. I get it but Biden really ain't shit either
so wait Trump's press conference was to announce that he's signing an executive order to guarantee something that the affordable care act already guarantees? what?

It's not a coincidence this comes after dismal Democratic numbers in the recent Primary. For all their talk of 'leading Trump by 150000000000+ points'... it's obvious DNC internal polling is telling them a different story.
So you admit Trump is losing. Incumbents that are winning don't want more debates. Why risk it?

President Trump is rolling out the wonderful news he said he would!
Reporters need to remind trump his big idea to cover pre-existing conditions was already part of the OBAMACARE he‚Äôs been trying to destroy.
Trump did no such thing. He inherited a strong economy from Obama.   Suspension of the payroll tax will not boost the economy. Over 60% of benefit goes to top 20% of wage earners. It does NOTHING for those w/o jobs, and it causes revenue shortfall for Social Security &amp; Medicare.

Trump's people are so dumb. He knows this because he is only slightly less dumb than they are. And he only cares that his dumb people think he is responsible for pre-existing condition coverage. It's the stupidity, stupid.
LMAO Trump absolutely OWNS reporter asking abt lack of "following guidelines" in room  Room erupts in chorus of boos  He cites exclusion in law for political activity/peaceful protest  Bc "they knew u'd be here, they know news is fake"ü§£  Takes victory lap, drops mic &amp; leaves! üá∫üá∏

Trump's EO also introduces new government programs like Medicare Part D, CHIP, the EPA, and the First Bank of the United States.

Yeah but he's not the only one with concerns. Hasn't been for awhile. People are just only paying attention now because Trump's name is attached, because it would have to be, since he has to sign something.  It's like the one time he actually listened to intelligence.

61 mil tested oh and your other talking point Trump signed EO requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions..  So try again Chuck
Trump pardoned him
See what I'm saying. We are leaving the cards in his hands. We need to make our hand stronger. He's going to deliver our issues if we don't. It's all about winning for him, whatever it takes. Some for McConnell. Why he gave go ahead to distance from Trump.
Oh I'm sorry, have you not been following the news lately Favs? News reporters (for the most part)? Dumb. Trump supporters? Duuuuuuummmb.

üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ all I‚Äôm saying is that without compassion and empathy for others we are destined to fail. Trump, and to a larger extent, Fox News are trying to divide us with fear and hatred. We can‚Äôt let that happen.
I do like that many DC reporters, after totally watching "Pen and Phone" and "Prosecutorial Discretion" blow by, have decided to swing at "Trump Can Do COVID Aid by Himself"
1. You are a bad person 2. Despite the decisions they made, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre justified.   You‚Äôre doing the same crap Trump does: justifying your terrible actions by pointing out the terrible actions of others.   Your days of comfort with 0 accountability are over.
Certainly  and  have the right to criticize  but shouldn‚Äôt they show this presser with trump talking about cutting payroll taxes, extending unemployment benefits, eviction protections and student loan deferments. Shouldn‚Äôt they show some of it?
The fact that the left isn't outraged and calling for immediate investigations into China &amp; Iran interfering in our election to HURT Trump is proof that the Russia hoax was never actually about "election integrity"  If they didn't have double standards they would have none at all
Yes. I understand. My best background is documentaries.  Friday's are popular for Trump to dump major things to try to control the weekend narrative.  Turns out, seems he just wanted to flex and get some attention.
There it is. The Biden slam. So just another Trump Rally full of bullshit and funded by the taxpayers.
So DINO who's running against Mitch McConnell is using Trump talking pts! Dems are totally Repubs now!
Then BLAME the DEMOCRATS for making a DEAL with RED CHINA to kill AMERICANS to get TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE. Because that's what happened. Also BLAME RINOs for losing the 2018 midterms and screwing AMERICA.

Trump 2020
I watched a  coronavirus commercial on Wednesday with my brother, and you know what? They said to social distance and stay away from crowds and wash your hands, but what was missing? NO PLEA TO WEAR MASKS. This is what Donald Trump has done.
You actually have absolutely no way of knowing this.  But we do know how disastrous Trump has been.
President Trump showered Governor Doug Ducey with praise for Arizona's handling of its COVID-19 outbreak during a meeting earlier this week. But Joe Biden and some local public health and medical experts don't think adulation is warranted.
Listen, I know you‚Äôve got a huge lady boner because trump liked one of your tweets or something but your tweets are incongruous with the degree you say you have.
Tune into President Trump‚Äô press conference.  Live NOW  WowSwan‚Äôs interview of Trump on Axios is cool but have you ever listened to Kendrick Lamar interview Tupac on TPAB?
I can‚Äôt believe a man with no postal service is running the USPS and fired his experienced top people. Welcome to Donald Trump‚Äôs America- where anyone with bucks who can kiss Trump‚Äôs butt can do anything they‚Äôre not remotely qualified to do!
Clearly a Trump supporter.
Sadly I do know a few. But I‚Äôm working hard to change their minds. But honestly, it‚Äôs President Trump that is getting their attention. Most of them like what he‚Äôs been doing / saying the past month.
Fewer Trump voters come election time!!!
You are a disgrace to America, your family, the entertainment industry, and your race. There is enough unrest in our country without you pulling this crap. You deserve to be completely blackballed!
The real problem with Trump taking over the post office isn't their being able to deliver the ballots to the ballot box. It's whether they be delivered to the voters in the first place. Their goal is to keep ballots out of voters hands in the first place.
I‚Äôve never understood opposition to the wall. I get hating Trump. I get hating Republicans. But hating the wall is literally just embracing chaos and lawlessness.

This thread is about the comparison of the Millions more in taxpayer money spent at Trump properties versus the amount he allegedly donates.   You keep bringing up stuff that has nothing to do with this thread, that's highjacking.
Boy! These people are so corrupt. Comey was right when he compared Trump to a Mafia don.
Only the Lord knows for sure but I have a strong hunch Trump will emerge victorious.
Neither Biden or Trump. I vote on myself. I won‚Äôt rely on a white Supremacist to do a darn thing for me or my people.
The last thing we need is another politician ignoring a pandemic bc you‚Äôre excited that Trump paid attention to you. I lost my dad today bc you are weak and care more about yourself than our community. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre termed out. But that won‚Äôt bring my dad back.

You people are so wierd they already are. And Trump loves communists leaders. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it. Trump loves commies but they are bad so let‚Äôs look away while he kisses their butt.
These are the people Trump hangs with who give him advice &amp; seek favors. Biden hangs out with Americans who are actually struggling: workers, teachers, nurses, small business owners, factory workers, farmers, postal workers, vets.
Trump really is just killing democracy faster than an foreign enemy.
Trump should know this.  Is he suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment?
Trump teases order requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions - He must be suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment.
While we clutch our pearls, trump continues doing what he does best. ‚ÄúMerchandising ‚Äú( must be said with Mel Brooks voice).  And cheating. There is NO substance, anywhere.  Ever.   (But substance is apparently irrelevant in a post-truth world.)
That's a lot of taxpayer money being spent at Trump properties, that he profits from.   Trump takes lots of breaks and lots of vacations, the point of the entire thread was that he is making more than he is donating.

Trump is losing it (even more than usual) His supporters carry that burden by trying to be even more aggressive and enabling. Fuck outta here. America is a progressive nation. We PROGRESS. We make PROGRESS. We become tolerant of things, we learn to live with other people.
They know trump supporters are that stupid. That‚Äôs who this is directed at, which is kinda silly since trump already has their votes. Maybe they‚Äôll capture a few more dummy‚Äôs though.

Ducey sucks and Trump complementing him as we are out of work shut down and muzzled is a bit insulting.
If you‚Äôre a Trump supporter, you know this is covered under Obamacare, right? Or are you willfully ignoring that. Either answer is fine, I‚Äôd just rather people be honest
But the ballots will still be mailed and filled out and returned against him. What it shows most clearly is Trump‚Äôs utter desperation. He knows he‚Äôs going to lose and so has nothing to lose. But it‚Äôs only cementing the result.

#grandcanyon Trump's don't care about the environment, animals or our Earth at all. They don't even care about people, so it kinda makes sense they wouldn't care about things MOST NORMAL HUMANS would deem important and cherishable. Get those robotic weirdos out of the WH.

They're both right.  Republicans who still hold onto the possibility of unrigged elections are worried.  Republicans who are comforted by knowing that every stop is being pulled to ensure a Trump victory (or continuation of power) aren't worried.
The Trump family are corrupt, unfeeling &amp; care nothing about the USA, our planet, or animals.  His two sons have killed tons of them. Not in the wild though. They paid BIG MONEY to kill them in a fenced in "hunting preserve" where they had no chance.
I would get in line right now and wait in line until November 3rd to vote against Trump.
I just love this country. Trump has actively tried to get rid of Obamacare... Which requires insurances cover people with preexisting conditions. Now he is taking credit for something aleady happening, that's he's trying to get rid of.

Note to Dr Fauci,, that you stand next to Donald Trump making jokes about a subject you yourself have bastardized by often giving misleading information only designed to bolster the bully previously mentioned,  has NOT helped people make more informed decisions.
Biden has committed to selecting a woman as his rm. Looks to be between Kamala and Susan Rice. Either of them against Trump would be a massive improvement for Dems, particularly considering the current social climate.
I will not (and did not) vote for Trump. Biden, however, is not fit to lead. His recent racist gaffe and every other senseless, incoherent thing he says is evidence. He's 77. How can we possibly take his candidacy seriously?  Then a thought occurred to me.
Yea.  Means nothing.  Trump can‚Äôt control what these pieces of crap say. He has denounced people and organizations like this multiple times. You base your argument on this video with 100 people in it? Get real.  These people are evil.

(2) One of your specialties seems to be strawman arguments.  What did I say that remotely implied I would interpret a simple statement of support for Biden as "Trump-bashing"?  You spent most of the thread deflecting observations about Biden by overtly bashing Trump, though.
And as an addendum, if it‚Äôs not a thing, and since  liked your post, it should be a softball of a choice for him say ‚ÄúI oppose any effort by the trump admin to open  &amp; the protected area around it to uranium mining and will fight any effort to do so‚Äù.
This is simply another distraction Trump has manufactured to take people's attention away from the real issues.   Don't get squirreled out!   I can guarantee you that this will not be the last BS distraction coming from Trump. Tomorrow, it'll be something even more outrageous.

One of the many things I will never forgive Trump for is pardoning that asshole.

You're illustrating my point with that question.  YOU brought up Mary Trump in response to something irrelevant, then ducked my question about why you brought her up. You strawman every comment about Biden into a Trump endorsement, and try to re-frame the thread for your benefit.
The advice to Trump on how to fix it plus the words of praise for Haley and Pence definitely led me to think this was an effort to help him. Yes.
Yeah cause Trump made it better. You‚Äôre party is trying to destroy all of that.
Again, you keep talking about diagnoses and disqualifications, which is all strawmanning. The "whataboutism" is on YOUR side, trying to exempt Biden from any scrutiny because he deserves coronation simply for Not Being Trump.  Millions won't ignore the elephant in the room, dude.
It is possible, Trump and family, and cronies are making money off of all of the hospitalizations occurring from the COVID-19 pandemic. In my opinion, that could be one reason why Trump and the Republicans have not come up with a national strategy to stop the pandemic. Money.

Again, you keep saying "diagnosis" when I offered none, but YOU offered an irrelevant one on Trump from someone who never personally examined him as a patient.  My point was that Biden concluded his remarks, evidently satisfied with a statement even you admit was incoherent.

LOL The Affordable Care Act already requires insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration is currently arguing in a case before the Supreme Court to strike down that very law ‚Äî including its pre-existing condition protections.
Judge rules woman who accused Trump of rape can proceed with defamation suit
How does everybody not see that Trump wants to ban tick-tock because he can now use China as a scapegoat when he loses the election and blames the election interference on China. It's all smoke and mirrors and a big game to him
Really? How so. Trump is the President for 3.5 years and the debt exploded, unemployment doubled, 160k people died from a pandemic, the most deaths in the world by far. He's a con.  #Biden2020  #CountryOverParty
Exactly Trump is a disgusting person.
I think you missed a trump rally.
Trump is fighting for our constitutional republic to survive the demonic attack against those who hate America and against all odds I believe in in Devine providenceüá∫üá∏üôèüèºüòá‚ò¶Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüåπ
I'm a local and laugh every time I hear about Arepiehole.  We actually adopted a greyhound, whose racing name was "trump clemency".  We call him scooter now.
Hmmmm....signed an executive order for a law that already exists. Trump supporters applauding, but wait.......
"Get out of your basement?" Are you really bringing up a fake statement based on photoshopped images? OMG, how embarrassing.
The GOP is dead, replaced by the National Socialist Republican Party bent on turning the clock back to 1841. They're heartless only interested in how much more money they can steal for themselves from whatis fast becoming the Late United States of America
Great! Now President Trump has a good reason to void the trade agreement and restart the trade wars! Time to stock up on popcorns to watch China CCP die from thousand cuts!
I‚Äôve been waiting for you to release your environmental policy since 2019, and you‚Äôve never once contradicted trump.   Prove me wrong!
He takes all credit that may get him re-elected.  Trump REALLY needs to be a one term worm.  #YouAreTheResistence
All this was done by Obama but you could not see it because you worked for company that hated Obama but loved trump lies and what happened they kicked your can out from fox irony
I really wish Fred DuVal would just apologize. I read the column before any commentary about it and was dismayed. It read me as though he is an active Trump supporter. And then to learn he is not supporting Marsh?
Breaking: trump invented Obamacare!
And yet, you do have to say it. If it‚Äôs up to trump and goons like Gosar, one of the Seven Wonders would become a polluted toxic waste site.
. and  will not stop donald trump from opening the #GrandCanyon for uranium mining.  #AZ07 #AZ09 #AZ #Arizona
Is this a Joke? The ACA that Trump is trying to kill in court already did that. What next Make them cover your dependents until they are 26.
You should be voting Trump. Take Obam out of your avi. Judgemental hag.
Trump should be charged with crimes against humanity for boarder children's prisons and lack action during the pandemic). Kelly Ann Conway, and each senator standing with trump should be charged as well... at least as an  accessory.  via
Maybe there is but whether or not there is or isn't Trump has to promote it as the Dem/Lib's narrative is that Trump will get rid of the pre-existing conditions safety net.
I asked if they have Q stuff, like QAnon. He said no (but his son was gonna pick up more stuff soon), but the guy understood who I was talking about! He'd heard of Q! I am not used to this! I mean, being around Trump supporters! I've been so quiet. It's been quiet for so long!
At first, I was afraid to walk over to the new road-side Trump t-shirt stand, but then all three of the OTHER people who got off the public bus with me went to the t-shirt stand, as well! We ALL ended up buying something! (lol, I was afraid they'd make fun of me.)
It was awesome....Trump 2020!
of the economy that has disincentivized Americans not to return work. A ton of business have closed and file bankruptcy due to COVID-19 Coronavirus. Larry Kudlow and the Trump administration is clueless and incompetent to the max.
Body Language ‚Äì Trump "Last time you see me for a while"
Does any body else find it funny lil jimmy has snarkey comments for anything trump or evangelical but has no time to comment on the most racist candidate for president in an entire generation?
President Trump Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow, don‚Äôt know anything or have a clue about economics. The guy is incompetent talking about extending the $600 Federal Unemployment Benefits disincentivized people not to return to work. It‚Äôs COVID-19 Coronavirus and the total collapse
is a Big idiot who does nothing more than kiss the ring to appease Trump. I feel bad for all the people he suckers into thinking that he's any kind of a leader.
He's one of Trump's androids sitting on a pile of bribery cash, that doesn't care about lives of AZ residents!  Trump wanted the border states to be the most affected with COVID. That's how come he paid most of the Governor's like AZ, FL, TX, big money to not to a damn thing!
how about you contain/eliminate/defeat COVID 19 -trump virus-  very quickly before Nov 3, 2020.
Don‚Äôt waste your breath, Trump supporters will forgive him for anything. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a cult.
One more reason why Trump will be re-elected.  Pence Will Make a Campaign Stop in Wisconsin During the Democrat Convention While Biden Stays Home.
I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere and tried Fox. Chicken Heir was scolding dems for not liking Kanye West. Said ‚Äúthey obviously don‚Äôt think all black lives matter‚Äù. But anyway.. trump was just in a small corner.
How has Trump capitulated in China?  He has been supportive of Xi, and extremely critical of the CCP. Shouldn‚Äôt that be the correct posture if there is any hope of China breaking from the CCP?
so now were talking about ventilators?  How did we need these?  trump made a travel ban, and as we all know, that was the single greatest move in the history of the world ever?
How many people were killed in so called Trump‚Äôs America because he perpetuated conspiracy theories? That‚Äôs why the death toll became so high in the first place because there was no one leading America. And why we‚Äôre screwed, republicans are still refusing to care about Americans
I‚Äôm hoping trump will be in a prison cellü§ûüèæ
It is so much fun watching you Lefties. You never seem to get what Trump is doing/saying.Anyone should be able to follow along. Then you start your screeching. Trump says "the sky is blue." Lefties "LIAR, LIAR, LIAR!!!" "The sky has gray areas and little clouds." That's why we üòÇ
Trump taking cares of business! The very moment that career politicians, on both sides, started hating on Trump, I knew that he was going to be the best President ever. Boy has he not disappointed! 4 more years!!
It‚Äôs not about that all. The Dems are the ones playing hardball and politics. Trump is telling them to get a deal done or he will take care of the American people by executive order. If the Dems sue him over that then they were like horrible.
It's true, the govt is responsible. Trump crashed the economy when he ignored the briefings he was given on the virus back in January
God Bless and Protect our President  Trump Makes Cryptic Remark at Ohio Speech "I Have a Lot of Enemies This May Be th Pres Trump spoke to workers at a Whirlpool factory in Clyde, Ohio Thurs to tout his efforts to restore America‚Äôs manufacturing base
you mean china and india?  both doing better than us. china leaders and inda leaders seem to be much smarter and way stronger than trump. someone should vote out such a weak leader!
Trump is a disgusting Human who lies constantly and has a moral compass of a mob boss.
Well since Trump hates the Dems, how about I throw him an elephant üêò
Why does the Trump campaign this Americans are this stupid? Oh... this was for his base of supporters. Now I understand.
That‚Äôs why we love TRUMP!!
Yesterday New Jersey Hospitals / Today #Trump golf course... what is wrong with our society and humanity üî•üò¢üëøüíîthey just spent on everyone‚Äôs Grave that died of #COVID19
Not so sure this time. Tariffs/trade are the ones talked about but the US wants a system change in China. State Capitalism is winning over Corporate Capitalism/Wall St. The NeoLibCon Asia Pivot under Obama lives under Trump. The US fears China's BRI.
It's not a coincidence this comes after dismal Democratic numbers in the recent Primary. For all their talk of 'leading Trump by 150000000000+ points'... it's obvious DNC internal polling is telling them a different story.
So you admit Trump is losing. Incumbents that are winning don't want more debates. Why risk it?
He was called out by a reporter for people in room not following CV guidelines.  Trump said he was calling the meeting a peaceful protest and a political gathering so there was nothing to worry about.  Turned and left. BOOM!
When the democratic party elites choose a terrible candidate for president to run against Donald Trump, it doesn‚Äôt take many votes to siphon to keep Trump in office. #NeverBidenNeverTrump #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
Just like con man Trump to Doug ducey  doesn‚Äôt practice what he preaches and of course people to get the virus and probably some die
Nearly 200,000 Arizonans have been infected and Doug Ducey thinks that his inefficient leadership is somehow a success story. If the Governor was as serious about his response to COVID-19 as he is about kissing up to Trump, maybe we wouldn‚Äôt have over 4,000 dead in Arizona.
President Trump is rolling out the wonderful news he said he would!
Reporters need to remind trump his big idea to cover pre-existing conditions was already part of the OBAMACARE he‚Äôs been trying to destroy.
Fyi Trump just called her Bluff with his EO‚Äôs !!
So excited that President Trump is signing an executive order for pre-existing conditions must be covered by health insurance plans! #greatestpresidentinhistory  This is huge people!!!!
Who goes bankrupt first post trump? Kushner or trump himself?

Sweet Jesus. Yes. Yes, that is all we have.  That is the only stupid thing trump has ever said. There is no way I could find 1000 videos of him being the dumbass he is. Holy hell. But that Axios interview huh?
Call him in. Even though impeachment has passed, the American citizens deserve to know who trump is before voting again
trump supporters: THESE BLM PROTESTS CAUSED CASES TO SPIKE. üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° trump supporters:
Fox seemingly cut away from what had been touted as a press conference at Trump's club in NJ that Trump seems to have invited club members to attend.  They had wine glasses and no masks and Trump then claimed it was a campaign event and "political" so no masks were required.
If there were credible allegations of child rape by Trump, you and I both know that CNN, CBS, NBC, ABC, NYTimes and all the rest would have no other headline or story, 24/7. You know this, dear.
Doug Ducey should be ashamed of himself- he‚Äôs partially to blame for the virus is getting out of control in Arizona &amp; I understand we need to keep Business open. Why do he allow conman trump to come to Arizona at a church with 3000 cult supporters with no masks
Trump's people are so dumb. He knows this because he is only slightly less dumb than they are. And he only cares that his dumb people think he is responsible for pre-existing condition coverage. It's the stupidity, stupid.
Uhh...  "Evanina also stated that Iran is seeking to "undermine US democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country."
Your education is lacking! Trump banned travelers coming from China while all quid pro quo joe fingers was doing was saying the POTUS was a xenophobe &amp; Nutty Nancy was dancing around n Chinatown in February singing let them in, let them in!!! I'd say both Dems are #FailureToLead
Karen reports on Trump's presser.
Trump was masterful again tonight. He made Pelosi totally irrelevant and completely played her. If the Dems try to sue him over his executive orders they will look horrible, Which isn‚Äôt really hard to do
Wow, you have actual deep hatred in your heart for Trump, don‚Äôt you? Real hatred. That‚Äôs a grave sin.
Easy anybody but Trump
you see whats weird is how you at first said it was chinas fault,  but when faced with the reality that trump failed to protect us, then started to blame the cities that got sick.  I just wanna make sure i have what you are saying right.
Oh Schooley... open your eyes &amp; see the truth about Trump's incompetence &amp; criminality. He bungled the Covid19 crisis &amp; many people died that didn't need to. I call that a crime. üò∑

Trump, KUSHNER, DeJOY, DeSANTIS, DUCEY, KEMP, MEADOWS, MILLER, MNUCHIN &amp; Co., INTENTIONALLY allow COVID-19 to run rampant; let Americans bleed their savings dry; then foreclose like there's no tomorrow, making what they did in the Great Bailout appear as child's play.
U.S. Intelligence Says Republicans Are Working With Russia to Reelect Trump.  I mean, how is this not illegal? Again!!!!
Don't hold your breath come November 3rd when the POTUS is reelected!!!  TRUMP 2020 #MAGA
We SHOULD be able to open schools, go back to work, go out to eat, return to normal life by now BUT... your administration's mismanagement of the #COVID19 has stunted our ability to do so. Do better &amp; listen to experts and shut Trump up!!!
Yeah but he's not the only one with concerns. Hasn't been for awhile. People are just only paying attention now because Trump's name is attached, because it would have to be, since he has to sign something.  It's like the one time he actually listened to intelligence.
Check out her feed. Literally any time trump tweets, she‚Äôs there. She has like 50k tweets and 99% are kissing his ass. She‚Äôs got a major crush on him and wants so desperately to be noticed. She‚Äôs a total sycophant.
Trump, KUSHNER, DeJOY, DeSANTIS, DUCEY, KEMP, MEADOWS, MILLER, MNUCHIN &amp; Co., INTENTIONALLY allow COVID-19 to run rampant; let Americans bleed their savings dry; then foreclose like there's no tomorrow, THROW THEM ALL OUT!

Oh I'm sorry, have you not been following the news lately Favs? News reporters (for the most part)? Dumb. Trump supporters? Duuuuuuummmb.
Gonna pull out my acoustic guitar and make the ugly Trump world disappear for about 2-3 hours.
üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ all I‚Äôm saying is that without compassion and empathy for others we are destined to fail. Trump, and to a larger extent, Fox News are trying to divide us with fear and hatred. We can‚Äôt let that happen.
I do like that many DC reporters, after totally watching "Pen and Phone" and "Prosecutorial Discretion" blow by, have decided to swing at "Trump Can Do COVID Aid by Himself"
The fact that the left isn't outraged and calling for immediate investigations into China &amp; Iran interfering in our election to HURT Trump is proof that the Russia hoax was never actually about "election integrity"  If they didn't have double standards they would have none at all
There it is. The Biden slam. So just another Trump Rally full of bullshit and funded by the taxpayers.
There is absolutely no information on China that was Putin Gaslighting Tactic ... Trump cabinet really thinks Americans are stupid
Trump is just a bad ass! He is so tired of fighting to get things done so he is just doing them himself.
Honestly, screw Joe Biden, he‚Äôs going to ignore progressives during his entire presidency. However, Trump is a much worse option and don‚Äôt be ignorant by voting for third party or writing in Bernie Sanders name. #voteforbiden
I am not an anti-Vaxxer by any means, however, given this administration, before I take a COVID-19 Vaccine, I want to see the results and the numbers first. With Trump, It's probably Bleach and Lysol masquerading as the real thing.

President Trump showered Governor Doug Ducey with praise for Arizona's handling of its COVID-19 outbreak during a meeting earlier this week. But Joe Biden and some local public health and medical experts don't think adulation is warranted.
Tune into President Trump‚Äô press conference.  Live NOW  Wow
Not according to trump. Per him, jobs are just being created all OVER!
Pure hell. Trump will be plotting to undo the election if he hasn‚Äôt already rigged it in his favor!

Trump says executive action would include a payroll tax cut that will go until end of year and be retroactive starting July 1

VP Biden you are correct to be critical of Gov Ducey‚Äôs responses to COVID 19 in terms of being a model per Trump.  But the Governor has encouraged local leaders to act and not fight common sense like Gov Kemp.  And AZ has made considerable progress recently.
One other observation: You seem way to obsequious to the President.  He and his administration have botched this big time.  You really need to distance yourself from Trump before you go down with him.

Never. He will press (lie)  that it is below 10% in order to open schools so he can please Trump.
Nonsense. I live in Az. He mandated and enforced nothing. He has no plan to raise unemployment which is $240.00 a week. He will leave it to Congress. He wants federal "socialist" $ but spews state's rights. He is a lying Tea Bagger that kneels to Trump.

Governor of Arizona Doug Ducey is a tool and a boot licker for Trump. He is a complete failure that only thinks about his own future. He doesn't have the huevos to mandate masks and cherry picks (lies) on the data. He needs to resign.
It will be interesting to see how China reacts. They are already over the pandemic and are up and running. The US can't take a trade war hit and Trump knows it.

Trump 2020
It‚Äôs a good thing he wasn‚Äôt in the US; trump or kushner would have given mbs the address!
Just watched James Carhill on the Beat one of my favorite shows on MSNBC! I got the best feeling listening to you give Barr-fatter and babbling dumpster-fire trump hell bless your heart ‚ù§Ô∏è. The Beat was on fire üî•, let me give the show a hand üñê love you too Ari!
Doesn't the N in NRA stand for National? Is trump feeling okay today? Did he have another mini stroke?
Omg Trump is saying the vaccine will be ready 3 Nov. Dumpy Trumpy will say and do anything to get re-elected.    So wrong
He opened up Arizona without following CDC guidelines and caused these deaths. Trump hack #TrumpHasNoPlan
Does Trump have a Plumber Force that we‚Äôre not aware of? WTH?
You have to be fully entrenched in the Trump Cult to think remarks like this are even touching the edge of sanity.
Questionable.. probably. But no formal investigation. Trump is being investigated over tax and bank fraud. There's a paper trail.
Trump supporters don‚Äôt have the intellectual ability to understand this.
Fuck Donald trump fuck ICE
Post master is a Trump Hack
Governor Ducey the Trump boot licker is a complete failure who would not even mandate masks. He closed the state too late then opened way too early with no plan. But yet he kneels to Trump as the bodies pile up in the morgue.
people are crazy! Voting for fucking Biden?! What the hell! Even if you don‚Äôt like trump whatever the reason is you honestly want to see Biden as our president for the next 4years! think this country is fucked up now you wait till he gets a hold of it!üíôüñ§üíôüá∫üá∏Trump!
Biden is Not taking away your guns!!! Not defunding police!!!Not taking away religious rights!!Trump will lie fraud steal and do anything to get re-elected.   SHAME #NobodyLikesTrump
If he sees his shadow, do we get four more years of Trump.
If Joe can take down God, then he's a heavy favorite to knock down Trump.
And arizona is going down on infections cause of our mayors not our governor he couldnt even mandate the mask we didnt get everything our dr med staff needed either and the testing tract &amp;tracing govern ou r ducey failed that one too you failed trump
So, based on what Trump says, I assume you voted fraudulently, voted for a few dead people and immigrants, voted more than once.....right?
Because trump is too dumb to realize killing a bunch of kids and teachers/adults who work in schools is the worst thing to if he wants to be re-elected. Consider the timing of when we‚Äôll see this next spike in deaths related to school opening + the election. He‚Äôs done.
I really wish he was only trying to boost his fame..... but he is trying to split the votes, help Trump stay in office. It's really a crying shame if that foolishness works.
So Trump?
Sounds like Obama: "Tell Vlad I will be more flexible after my re-election."  Yet Obama allowed Russian interference he knew was happening and Trump has put Heavy Sanctions on Russia and beaten them on the oil/energy front.  You have swallowed too much Democrat Kool Aid.
I did but I exchanged it for a Trump resigning square

Martha McSally has shown little interest in Arizonans. In 2018 she lost in part because she lied about her position on pre-existing conditions. Now she claims she will always protect Arizonans with pre-existing conditions yet she‚Äôs silent on Trump‚Äôs request to invalidate the ACA.
Here we go New York never Trumpers prosecutors to make major announcement to President Trump past business financial issues. Democrats are making it a big boom finding. Look at America
Trump has no plan for anything.
Fully support draining the swamp. Getting the Trump family corruption out first seems like a step we should have taken already
Trump is loyal to nobody...well maybe Ivanka.
I‚Äôm not sure about anyone else, I became a Twitter user to follow President Trump. If Twitter suspended President Trump permanently then i will be cancelling my account.
Why is Joe‚Äôs wife, a doctor, displaying Joe‚Äôs in complement medical condition, it‚Äôs embarrassing for him and the Democrats party. Joe Biden will NEVER NEVER NEVER debate President Trump.
Hiw about 65 million Trump supporters viewership.
You can bash Trump, but numbers are numbers. Again, REGISTERED INDEPENDENT, trying to decide which asshole to vote for. Not debate party preference. They BOTH suck.

Trump continues to say the Covid19 virus will just go away. He has said this over and over since February. Omg 157000 dead and he saids "it is what it is". He just does not get it.  Help us please #Trump Virus #TrumpFailedAmerica
The real concern is what could happen in the electoral college. Let‚Äôs say Trump loses a close election in the EC. But, one of the battleground states he lost decides to annul the popular vote and pick conservative as electors with instructions to vote for Trump.
Donald J Trump is the most corrupt president in USA üá∫üá∏ history
Not at all, that‚Äôs your belief, have at it.  It‚Äôs ironic an atheist would support such a self proclaimed ‚ÄúGod‚Äù fearing man like trump!
Kanye is just a spoiler anyone who votes for him is wanting Trump to win!!
Atheists for trump.........NUFF SAID!!
Biden can't  beat Trump, but COVID can.
Trump‚Äôs presidency has been his effort to pit Americans against each other. Here we are in the middle of a national crisis &amp; what‚Äôs Trump doing? He has pitted this with Covid19 and look were we are now.   Listen to Fauci
Trump already hinted that it may have been a terrorist act. What if it actually was Israel? Will Trump still say it was a terrorist act?  I think not. I will believe what ever Nasrallah says as he is the most sane person in the region.

The trump virus ü¶† the only cure will be in November
Yes, please keep moving forward by not coming back to Arizona. You are a complete failure and put us all in danger while you bowed to Trump. You don't even have the huevos to mandate masks. But you shine Trump's bearings. You are shameless.
...race relations on fire:Travon Martin and Ferrguson, just 2 examples. Barry is the villain here, not Donald Trump who always talks about our being the same and who has spent his time in office improving lives of minorities: economy, jobs, opportunity zones, 1st step criminal...
FU and everything you‚Äôve obstructed. Waiting two months was evil. Sit down &amp; take your medicine. The Heroes Act is the right legislation to pass NOW! And if you allow Trump to stop counting the census, we‚Äôll take all 10 R at risk senators down with a vengence, including you.
President Trump just finished his press conference, saying that Ducey‚Äôs been a great job. When will we hear from Ducey? Will he do a press conference tomorrow? Last time Trump connected with Ducey, Ducey prematurely opened the state. Will schools be forced to open?

He is following the Sinema (Independent) playbook to a tee.   The Az. State House might go D this year. I suspect Brnovich will run for Governor in 2022 but I can't think of a viable D.   Ducey is meeting with Trump/Pence in D.C. to open up.
Trump 2020 Mitch!
Anyone who believes this is president Trump's fault has their head in the sand.
McSally was *appointed* she is not a real Senator but she  kneels to Trump.  Kelly will be another Sinema who is another Joe (RepubDem) Manchin. So why even have this election?
The first thing I want President Biden to do is to appoint a commission of Republicans and Democrats to find every official hired under Trump so they can be fired and review every agency rule changed and due process that change to ascertain if it‚Äôs a necessary change.

Trump can't negotiate a ramp, and a bottle of water.  Your candidate does not have the high ground.
If Trump doesn't want to disclose who his Daddy is by releasing his taxes, he should be disqualified from running. Period.
Why?  Here in the US, people either blame Trump or Obama for everything regardless of what the facts say.
He also wanted to impeach him...but yeah...Trump should just ignore all that and blow kisses.
No.  Don‚Äôt take his words and misuse them like that.  They were talking over each other but Trump clearly said: ‚ÄúThey took that and made such a big deal.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat‚Äù is in reference to him wishing her well NOT the fact that she allegedly participated in child trafficking.

Controversial topic but i hate Trump for the sole purpose of his ideologies Trump isn‚Äôt our president because Trump is here for America as a whole the only thing that Trump has offered that‚Äôs good is the fact he‚Äôs bringing America out of debt other than that he‚Äôs still terrible
It should read ‚Äúlet‚Äôs scrap the presidential debate since sleepy, creapy Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt hold his own against Trump‚Äù
It's okay.  I wish others could improve, but I fear for Trump it is too late.
I wouldn‚Äôt! He wouldn‚Äôt stick to the facts, he‚Äôd get all blustery and bullying, he‚Äôd be playing to and audience that enjoys a soap opera drama rather than listening to actual facts. Trump can only filibuster. Waste of time. Let‚Äôs just vote.
I don‚Äôt have a religion. I have a relationship with Jesus Christ. I don‚Äôt put anyone or anything above Him. My wearing a Trump mask to church doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm putting Trump over God anymore than my neighbor wearing a Raiders mask is them putting the Raiders over God.
States buckled to Trumps DEMAND to reopen without a strategy! When the experts recommended a phased approach Trump insisted REOPEN NOW. Trump‚Äôs lack of leadership and concern for being re-elected is why we‚Äôre in this mess- wake up!
I couldn‚Äôt care less about Trump

OMG! Ok... pay attention. Simple. We could stop testing nationwide TODAY and thousands of people per day would still be DYING! Trump would be happy with lower numbers .. we‚Äôd still be DYING! Why is that so hard to understand!

Just like in May when trump came here and leaned on the govorner to open the state, Trump‚Äôs going to lean on him again to open schools.  And, Ducey will fold like a deck of cards.
Biden needs to debate Trump because the low information voter will get a chance to see what the Dems have put out there for their vote.

Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.

I attended a Trump rally a couple of years ago. Narcissism is pretty much a given in presidents but does not disqualify them (consider the hundreds of times Obama used ‚ÄúI‚Äù in every speech). Trump talked off promoter for 1 1/2 hours. No incoherence. Biden can‚Äôt talk 5 minutes.
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. ‚ÄúHey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúReady to work! Let‚Äôs go (Dr. Jill Biden)!‚Äù he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?

Former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says he opposes expanded uranium mining near Grand Canyon National Park.
A vote for Biden is a rebuke of Trumpism. It is a signal that you support democracy and constitutional government. It is a vote that says to the world that in this nation, the people hold the power, not a cabal of criminals hell-bent on destroying the country from within.
...Think about it!! Biden is speaking for muslims and talks about the Koran.....muslims throw gays off bldgs and behead them in the middle east..... Do really want that here?? I sure don't!!! You vote the way think you should vote...its your life, not mine!!
Figurehead?? More like a deadhead!! Biden is.....just there... He's a marionette and there could be about 5 people pulling his strings.... Biden is really a sick man....and his wife  should be ashamed of herself for putting Joe through this!!! Its definitely elder abuse!!
Oh....me....oh....my........If it does happen, she and Biden can surpass Obama as gun and ammo sales-reps of the century.......or ever!!!

Biden lost a wife &amp; baby daughter in a car accident. He‚Äôs been a single parent. He lost his adult son to cancer, and now stays involved in his grandchildren‚Äôs lives. He looked after his own mother, who lived in a carriage house on his property, until her death in 2010 at age 92.
Lie: Biden "wants to double and triple everybody's taxes."  Fact: only your buddies, not "everybody." #trumppresser
I really don't look forward to voting for Biden (the Harris pick as VP definitely helps some) but he's the most realistic option for getting Trump out of the White House. If a Biden vote is what I have to do to get Trump out of office I'll gladly do it.
Biden and Kamala... Really... The best the democrats had was a bag of dust and a former prosecutor?
Good thread. Harris/Biden are baby steps in the right direction and I guess that‚Äôs about all we can hope for with them.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
Do y‚Äôall want fascism? Y‚Äôall get to choose. Sure Biden and Harris have had their issues - what politician hasn‚Äôt? As someone I follow put it - voting isn‚Äôt marriage. There isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúone‚Äù it‚Äôs like a bus you find the bus that gets you closer to where you‚Äôre going and take it!
Too bad biden and harris have done so much to ruin people's lives through the prison industrial complex
As if biden and harris are not also literal fascists?
Better than a vote for Biden. Rather go Jorgennson.
We all kinda knew Biden was going to pick Kamala Harris as his running mate. Most of us also know this pick makes no sense and doesn‚Äôt add anything to Biden‚Äôs campaign.
So happy that the Biden team chose to fight fascism with fire!  #BidenHarris2020
I think he‚Äôs being a first class prick sarcastically saying Biden is not a catholic because he‚Äôs a democrat. I like the other guys comment: well maybe listen to you about politics when you start paying taxes.
I have not forgotten. Harris is the nastiest woman in Congress. Women need to get out and vote against the Biden/Harris ticket. I will never forget Mrs. Kavanagh's poor face during those hearings.

Obviously. We should definitely work to change the systems. But I‚Äôm simply pointing out that there isn‚Äôt much that can be done in 84 days. We can‚Äôt get another nominee. We get Trump. Or Biden come November. We must face that.
Who is yelling at people? I‚Äôm simply asking a genuine question. I think we should all certainly voice our concerns. Then I think we should step up and vote for Biden come November. And yes then we work to change the systems step by step
Biden definitely picked a wrong VP candidate, especially for Native American people, but as American politics go, Natives are always the last to truly be heard:
Kamala worked her ass off......literally....to get to where she's at!!! Now that Biden "tapped her" for the VP post, its just another "position" for her!!
Is anyone else worried about the possibility of being thrust into a complete polic state with this ticket? I‚Äôm still planning to vote for Biden but fuck am I scared to do so
#IAmANastyWoman And I will be voting for Biden/Harris !
She is a great foil to Biden's haphazard inability to speak extemporaneously. She is always on-message. Just not crazy about that prosecutorial thing.
I‚Äôm sorry this is happening again. But man life is not so black and white. As a trans man I‚Äôm supportive of Biden/Harris cause I want the current occupants out of the White House. I know that I‚Äôll never have the perfect candidate. No one will. But people can change and grow!
I‚Äôve heard enough of your lies and your CRAP. I‚Äôm heading off to donate to Biden/Harris and kick your ass to the curb.
did i want Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP? no. do i think it was a smart fucking move to sway independent/centrists? yes.
i will not hide my resentment for the Biden admin just because Harris is his vp. she‚Äôs a fucking moderate who doesn‚Äôt care about people any more than Biden does.  i just hope that our media can give Harris the grace she deserves as a black woman. benefit of the doubt engaged.
Ah yes. Biden/Harris are clearly the true socialist icons of our day. Most definitely.
It has been SOOOOOO long since I felt hope, I almost didn‚Äôt recognize it. I know it‚Äôs still a tough road ahead, but Biden/Harris will take us all the way.
Lmao im voting for Biden but I‚Äôll continue to shit on these bullshit centrist politics
Was I hoping for Elizabeth Warren? Yes. Am I still going to vote for Biden and Harris? Also yes. üó≥
she's still a cosponsor for bernie's bill. it think, at the end of the day, if there were/are enough senate votes (bernie won't let it go) then no one will care, it just not going to be what biden pushes.
who told joe biden that choosing a cop as his running mate amid protests about police brutality was a good idea
Worst choice ever. In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
Biden/Harris - It‚Äôs about time.
Trump's just lucky Biden didn't save her for AG.
Stop. Grudem? He only makes a case if he is talking to the old Dave or you. For example, defense and nuclear policy. Trump is stoking a new arms race with his policy. Biden already has experience in de-escalating what I believe to be the #1 issue on the planet.
You are an inspiration, Stacey. I envision you as President in the not-too-distant future. In the meantime, we‚Äôll do everything possible to put Biden/Harris in the White House!

I umm deleted that. Jorgenson over Biden.
I hope Biden picks Cardi B. #WAPmove
Did Trump literally say that if Biden gets elected ‚Äúwe will all have to learn how to speak Chinese...‚Äù  OMG. He is literally losing his mind right before our eyes. Please vote this lunatic back to real estate asap.
Is that the Biden bike ride they're talking about??? What a mask!! Looks like he's limp!!  Like he's going to be on the 4th of Nov!!!
I dont want to hear shit about Biden's gaffes anymore. Didnt this guy claim that the continental army took the British airports during the revolutionary war?  Has he had a stroke? Is he in concussion protocol? Wth.
How much is China paying them? A vote for Biden is a vote for China not America. Biden also ignores the #2A.  #TrumpPence2020 for Americans!
When have you ever worked for Americans? For almost 50 years you have only cared about China and illegals. A vote for Biden is a vote to be ran by China. #WheresHunter #ObamaBidenGate

President Biden will say: ‚ÄúDear Americans, tear down that wall!‚Äù
People. Imagine the WORST presidency from Biden. Sit with it, find reasons to like, and even get excited by it.  Because that it what you are going to get, so keep voting blue no matter who, just like the elites in the party tell you to.
Maybe Joe Biden in the past, but now it is Joe Biden channeling Barak Obama &amp; leftist extremists.

Not every Biden supporter is a Pedophile...
Umm because they are NOT there working. On hiatus, at home being paid while most Americans are not getting paid. Also, trying to find a way to screw Trump and prop Biden up intellectually.
Biden's tweet about protecting Grand Canyon from uranium mining was his most liked tweet in the last 7 days.  It's so uplifting to know the high esteem Americans hold for the environment and Grand Canyon specifically. Feeling a little less alone. ‚ô•
On the day an anti-Biden ad voiced by Sam Elliott premiers. Sam, how could you?
Oh Oh!!  I think shes got what Biden has!!!  Time to get her out.....
Furthermore and I‚Äôll get off my hobby horse Bob, you can never take away the politics of these kinds of decisions. After Biden wins üòâ and if this tax nonsense goes on past 1/20, the tax will be reinstated. Then the conservatives will scream he‚Äôs raising taxes. Inevitable.
She's awesome &amp; having realized her 2016 mistake, will vote for Biden this time. #OK
True. And if Maureen Dowd is concerned how Biden's running mate will be treated, she should remember how she treated Palin.
If the election wasn't so critical, I'd be voting for  But the only thing that matters is getting 45 out, and that means voting for Biden.
üòÇü§£ Joe Biden and the Democrats have never cared about building in America and buying American. I guess President Trump showed you the error of your China ways. Joe just wants to raise or taxes and ban guns. No thanks! #TrumpPence2020
Voting for Biden this year and I think it‚Äôs the last time I vote Blue or Red. Fuck the two party system
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
Joe Biden could show up at my house and literally take a dump on my lawn and I‚Äôd still vote for him, because Donald Trump has been taking a dump on the constitution every single day for the last 4 years. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Yang dropped out to make way for Joe Biden when Bernie was still beyond viable and the best hope we had of someone actually being a little on the left making it. He sold out to Biden &amp; CNN. He‚Äôs also surprisingly right leaning. Bernie is only very moderately Left/Libertarian
I no longer care who Biden picks for VP. I just wish he would retire.

He put up a traveling ban despite Joe Biden calling him xenophobic and Nancy Pelosi telling people to go out to China town. I got more but you asked for one.
Voting for sleepy creepy corrupt Joe Biden.... Is voting for George Soros.... And an evil one world government..... And eventually communism...... If you vote for Joe you aint black..... if you vote for Joe you aint American
So you are joining lying Biden? Disgusting!
Biden was raked over the coals for months because he hid in his basement and wouldn‚Äôt talk to anybody. Obviously the Harris campaign team made it clear that he had to come out of the dungeon and actually face people even if he doesn‚Äôt answer questions.
Imagine that ! He knows Biden has no business even running for president  !
I don‚Äôt like Biden either. Not a fan of him or Kamala. But you bet your booty once Cheeto is out I‚Äôm going to switching myself gears to educating about third party. I have changed four Trump supporters votes to at least democrat so I‚Äôm taking it as a win
Watch your back, ‚Å¶ boxed wine lady‚Äôs coming for you.
I would, but too many back out last second. I voted third party last election and truly hate myself for it. This year I fee I have to go for Biden to get Cheeto in Charge our. The following election I want to push third party

I can guarantee that Joe Biden will crack 90% chance of winning 24 hrs before Trump landslides him into retirement.
Harris IS the focal point of the election and everyone knows it.  (Outside WaPo maybe)  Biden is out of the picture any time between now and 2024.    Not IF, WHEN?
Biden couldn't get mileage out of this hoax  without A. Masses of ignorant followers and/or masses of followers who are just as corrupt.
(2)take votes away from Biden. You're sabotaging the mail by firing 23 supervisors, slowing down mail delivery and removing sorting machines. You're Republican cohorts are trying to suppress votes by closing down polling places, purging the voter rolls, etc.,
If you would have told me 20 years ago that the presidential tickets in 2020 would be Trump-Pence and Biden-Harris I probably wouldn't have understood you because I was a fucking baby then
If this is what‚Äôs going on 24 hours after the selection of the VP candidate then we can expect nothing but lies for the next three months.  The media will not find fault with Biden‚Äôs lies it will be up to us to do the fact checking.
Biden said countless times Trump was too aggressive and racist for stopping flights from China. Pelosi had a party in Chinatown.  I‚Äôd blame Fauci. Flip flopped weekly.
Biden has a bona fide recorded video history of lying and racism going back to his first term in office.

Tulsi has too much class to join the Biden ticket. Kamala Harris not so much!
Example of Liberals in a debate: Topic: Joe Biden being investigated Ukraine.  Liberal response: Well Donald Trump held the Bible up in the wrong way on his way to a historic church just for a photo op. Explain that. They only deflect because they have nothing intelligent to say.

biden,hussin oboma,clinton,pelosi all have committed treason that tril is hald by military court with death penatly
Biden: Here‚Äôs the deal, I um, you know, um chose Pamela Harris after I thought hard about, with... you know... the thing. I thought she must be qualified since you know... Willie Brown... we are about the same age and she pleased him from her position.
Joe Biden spent his life sponging off the American people and has nothing to show for it except his exceptional wealth that he has emassed!
Excellent choice! I can‚Äôt wait to vote Biden/Harris!!!

Republicans are claiming sexist attacks on Biden‚Äôs VP pick are fair game because of Palin. The attacks on Palin concerned her intellect, absence of curiosity, and lack of experience and ability. Nothing exclusive to her gender.
In Biden‚Äôs basement? Watch out  he may try to feel YOU up too.
And we believe you must be as nuts as Joe Biden ! To even think he could run this country !
Hold onto this for those‚ÄùCognitive debates‚Äù President Biden! Lol
Biden signs I saw, ZERO! Not one sign in sight. My question is why? Don't you think you should have signs plastered everywhere? This route also takes you through Laughlin and Las Vegas, Nv.. I'm just pointing out the fact that if I took notice of this how /3
Not to worry, Joe Biden can‚Äôt be bought! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Share this with everyone you know. Regardless of what you believe it at least shows what a lying slime bag Biden is and who he will use to reach his goals.
I listened to Levin, how when Obama did the payroll tax cut he stated that it's funng that the Democrats, Biden,  Pelosi and Schumer all praised Obama. They never said a word about social security. Now they are screaming it! Too funny! Trump2020
Everyone knows that Biden (if elected-God Forbid!) wouldn‚Äôt make it much past the inauguration before the DemocRats have him committed or invoke the 25th amendment due to his obvious incompetence. So the VP pick is paramount!
FWIW, If he [#Biden] wants to pick her [#SusanRice]  that's fine,  just saying there's a potential liability.    Nonchalant af.    PS.  Notice the cameramen doing a double take at the question?
Juan ; How do you know how older voters will vote ? You sound like Biden.

Biden will never debate Trump. He can say all he wants that he will show up! But when the rubber meets the road, he will  have some excuse and not show up! Biden is fraud and his campaign is a shambles. Jill Biden is the puppet master and pulling the strings.

Your guy Biden been in DC almost 50 years and done BUBKAS. You really think as he is losing his mind and hiding in a basement is going to magically change? OK think that, and keep that foil hat on.  Don‚Äôt buy the mantra that Harris is a moderate. She is no where near that.
is an intelligent man with good Morals, values &amp; Integrity unlike who we now have in the White House. Voting 4 Joe Biden will bring back the Values we once could be proud of.  We now live in a place that makes us lose sleep, fear what was done overnight by a President!

Well that‚Äôs real helpful.  Biden been in DC for 50 years. Done exactly BUBKAS! An now is losing his mind. Harris has a deplorable record. Incarcerated more Blacks in CA than any DA ever. An supports the biggest killer of all Blacks, thats Planned Parent Hood and is just mean.
While it‚Äôs true tax analysts estimate that all income groups, on average, would see an increase in their taxes under Biden‚Äôs proposal, the increases would be relatively small for all except high-income individuals and households.
The Democratic presidential hopeful would generate about half the money by raising taxes on households with incomes in excess of $400,000 and the other half by raising business taxes.
Joe Biden is the ultimate centrist Democrat...

She not even African, which means she not black. Biden should have kept is word
First off, Biden has been a sub-mediocare senator for 40 years and now, with dementia he would fall flat on his face debating President Trump. Secondly, Harris is a hag who has only learned to attack.  V.P. Pence is a gentleman who was a successful governor and can handle Kamala.
Joe Biden: the Ultimate Hypeman.
Republicans rally around their candidates.  Democrats infight because they didn't get what they wanted.  Our all or nothing political system sucks, but now we have a ticket - focus.  Biden Harris 2020
I wish Arizona had you on our side.  You are remarkable, JOE BIDEN should be making a place for you in his administration , The USA needs many many more Katie Porter's  !!!!
You mean the fact as DA she did everything she could to keep an innocent black man on death row.  Or that she was proud to be indian until she could ride the BLM movement and now she's a proud black woman. Or the fact she believed Biden's accusers until she could be on his ticket
To keep an innocent black man on death row. She also believed in Biden's sex assault victims until she could be on the ticket with him.  Ya, they care so much about morals ROFLMAO
Wasn't she Indian before she needed to capitalize on the BLM movement for votes? When she was DA didn't she do everything she could to keep an innocent black man on death row? Didn't she believe in Biden's victims until she could get the nomination to run with him? She's a winner
anybody else scared about a   presidency ?   yep, no way will  will retain leadership.  VOTE !  Today was a disgusting love fest between Biden and Harris.   Political Whores !
Kinda wonder how the Biden staff did their candidate vetting! Rather poorly is a good guess
Joe Biden is a man of compassion, empathy, intelligence and integrity.  I can't say that about you or any republicans.  What a Shame you try to Bully others to get re elected!  That's Juvenile and Bullying behavior!  We need a President that is an Adult, and a Good one!

Wow....the odd OAN "reporter" set Trump up again. Who is behind the Google search redirect of " to Joe Biden's campaign web site? I am thinking she should ask Trump about his support of QAnon candidates.
Yeah try to deflect. Hunter is not on the ticket. Biden/Harris both  have more integrity in their little fingers than the entire Trump family has together. The Trump family has cheated and lied, deceived people and adulterous. These are not Christian values.
The only thing that could truly turn me off to a Biden-Harris ticket is the abortion stance. Still pro-life. There has got to be room for us, too.

My thought she was picked just to be a BOMB thrower. Keeping Biden save from explosions. They know few Conservatives will not care a twit about Harris! An well we don‚Äôt
Clue: Biden been in DC for close to 50 years an he has done BUBKAS! Nothing at all to his credit! Just keeping a seat warm is his best job
no he‚Äôs intimidated of blacks who know history. Google it from every media source.

two source.  Plenty more on google from different sources.  Fact checked.
That she is teaming up with a old school Racist in Biden!!
Love Liz Warren but she&amp; Biden had a beef about banking legislation that never got smoothed over.She was in the running only on paper.Sorry,wasn‚Äôt gonna happen.But that‚Äôs okay because Ms.Warren is going to be a major player when we get that Orange Assclown out of the White House.
I knew it, thanks to you guys (my tutors). Her NEW FACE spoke volumes. She WILL go after Biden (if elected) and deem him unfit for office. #WhoreOfBabylon #SignOfTheTimes
Benji You are a pitiful excuse for a man. Kamala Harris is an eloquent speaker, has great ideas, and will help Biden reunite the country that Trump has divided.
Lets go Biden/Harris!!!
What about the Constitution, she does not qualify do to parents not US citizens to be President, should Biden not make four years
Their best moment is being in the Trump smack down video of Biden...Look at this photograph

And it's only because of the fact that I live in a red state that your administration is sending out these emails.  Even your son's girlfriend is sending me bs emails after I responded to her to stop.  Biden didn't do that and I can't stand him just like I can't stand you.
Trying to convince their extremely ignorant base that Biden is infirm. More projection. Trump's the one that's spiraling before our eyes.
There's a lot of video out there of creepy Joe Biden like that
I've been a Bernie supporter for many years (since he used to do a hourlong call to Ed Shultz' radio show). Would I have preferred him over Biden? Yes. But any non-vote, write-in, or 3rd party vote IS NOTHING BUT A VOTE FOR TRUMP. We can't afford for this coalition to fall apart.
if it's a decisive victory for Biden-Harris we may never see that on the R side either
If you want jobs vote for Trump and Pence. If you want mobs vote for Biden and Harris.
Now that Kamala Harris is Biden's running mate, high. But he'll need to check w Evangelical leadership. Trump relies on their vote. Especially those that are also white nationalists beneath their Bible verses. Fortunately he will also find himself at odds w their misogynists.

Is that what you believe about Biden saying he doesn't want his kids growing up in a jungle, or around blacks?

Drew is right! Beijing Biden ran for President in 1988 and again 2008. That‚Äôs where he got his nickname 1% Joe. He never got more than 1% of the votes either time. 2% Harris is with him now.
It‚Äôs funny how dems don‚Äôt see the polls running parallel to what the were in 2016. Polls that they were running claiming that Hillary was winning everywhere, when in fact she was losing badly everywhere. Biden is running the same as Hillary was back then. üëçüèª TRUMP WINS BIGLY!
Beijing Biden has made it clear he will mandate illegal aliens are covered in his healthcare mandate. Couple that with open borders and joy wood is right!
You mean Biden? Cuz Biden is a predator...
People, Biden has nothing to say.  Harris and her public record along with failed presidential run speaks for itself.  Dangerous duo that will appeal to uninformed lemmings and illegal migrants.
You‚Äôre missing the point like you demolition rats did in 2016. Send us video of 20 people let alone 2000 people gathering anywhere in this country today to support 1% Beijing Biden and 2% Harris. We will wait................./
My go-to is to minimize possible harm in the short term, so my instinct is to vote for Biden. But I‚Äôve heard convincing, coherent arguments for either path.
I hear what ur saying and I definitely understand your anger. And if you don‚Äôt want to vote Biden then by all means don‚Äôt. But I know people who got healthcare thanks to the Medicaid expansion and that was the aca so if even one person gets healthcare cuz of Biden it‚Äôs worth it.
Weighing all the minutiae that generate from taking either risk presents a plethora of questions like that. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still undecided, and don‚Äôt see transparent moral or logical failings in either leftists voting for Biden or leftists abstaining.

LOL! Do you mean votes that biden/harris never had? Ridiculous.
One easy way to see that enthusiasm doesn't equate to votes is to look at Democratic primaries. Bernie Sanders definitely had more enthusiasm. He had much larger crowds than Biden. But Biden still won. Enthusiasm doesn't mean you are going to win.
Clinton won by ~+14, so this looks consistent with the Biden +7-8 national that we keep seeing
Does anyone doubt the plan is to crash it the day after Biden wins?
Facts matter, truth Is truth no subjectivity here. Biden made himself clear so did Harris.
Trump is running for president, too, sweetheart. Biden has never been accused of anything besides being an affectionate uncle.   You're in a cult. Cults are for the weak minded.   You are no longer worth my time.
But I don't think it matters. I think Biden will get the votes from people that are un enthusiastic about him. Trump has Trumpist cult members who are going to be the most enthusiastic supporters. I concede That's 30% of America. But that won't win the election
Not if the person supports Trump. Or isn‚Äôt voting for Biden. Apart from that, I‚Äôm very open minded!
We‚Äôre all family here and honorary Biden‚Äôs #FullSpeedAhead.
Taylor swift sings songs about all the wrong choices she has made in choosing men in her life..be ready for a hit (don‚Äôt know how you can listen to a thirty year old who sounds like a 8 year old with no talent),about sleepy joe Biden! Another bad choice Taylor! No taste in men!!
She is the reason Kamala is the VP choice. If Biden wins he will step as side or be removed and Clinton will be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù as the vp for harris. You and every other democrat will be the reason too. Maybe that blows wind up your ass idk but Trump won bc Hillary sucks realize that
They are going on all over. Maybe there is no parade yet for Biden/Harris because BLMO and AntiFa haven't stolen enough boats?
Taylor sings about what wrong choices she has made in men. Biden will be next on her shit list!!!
And by the way, NOT accused doesn't mean Biden did it, but boy do you people love to spread that shit around about him, don't you? Hypocrite much?
Only one candidate is accused of raping a child. Spoiler alert: it's not Biden. Don't pretend you care about sexual assault, or men who walk in on naked teenagers brag about it to Howard Stern (easy to find interview), because you clearly don't. Which troll farm do you work at?
After doing that, suppose you are forced to choose who would have sole responsibility to take care of a newborn baby for 24 hours, Biden or Trump (neither one is allowed any assistance, including from their running mates).
A little thought experiment.  Watch this (short) clip of Biden  and then watch any clip of Trump speaking recently (even where he is facing combative and hostile reporters, which is of course nearly all the time).
If U wanted to move the country more to the left why the FUCK did you nominate Biden???? Why the FUCK are you letting HRC, Bloomberg and fucking Kasich speak at the conv? It's laughable you think we are "in your way" it's the fucking  preventing the country from moving left!
What America needs now is a reporter with Jim Acosta's energy to ask Joe Biden some questions after he speaks.

Are you honestly telling me that you think insulting people is a good campaign strategy?? Are you honestly passing yourself off as the Bernie supporter gatekeeper?? Let me guess; if (when?) Biden loses you'll blame Bernie supporters [again].
Biden and Harris will get it done. Till then more are going to die.
- have you looked into this? Biden seriously looks like he is exhibiting tardive dyskinesia. A friend with 40 years nursing experience taking care of elderly totally agrees.
The virus was paid for by Democrats with a promise to remove TRUMP from office at all costs and get back to bowing to RED CHINA. Biden will do that. TRUMP will make their existence miserable. BUT we need the HOUSE &amp; SENATE RED to make having TRUMP even stronger for AMERICA
Vote early before you see Joe Biden get creamed in the debates.
Like AOC, Maxine Waters and Hank Johnson, Joe Biden is #YoutubeGold
Is it me, or did he say absolutely nothing??? I am not against Biden... but hug??? The video with the hands is a "david Copperfield" move of distraction.
But apparently you don‚Äôt see a problem with the postal service union endorsing Biden and democrats concurrently pushing a mail in ballot this November.
For the record, I‚Äôll likely vote for Biden and hope he pays his food taster well.

Based on decades of calculated &amp; self-aggrandizing opportunism between Biden &amp; Harris, it is easy to deduce that both have replaced a typical moral worldview with a religious adherence to an amoral, hedonistic, and ever subjective leftist doctrine. Disconcerting to say the least.

I didn‚Äôt.  So I‚Äôm taking a leap here but I‚Äôm guessing‚Äúbig news about ONE guy we already knew about‚Äù then leftist ‚Äúlawlessness and hate‚Äù a brief Hillary Clinton segment then Biden (joe and hunter) It‚Äôs the same show nightly (just a jumbled up running order)
trump is the best option right now tbh. he‚Äôs on a roll with the new peace treaty w israel and that‚Äôs a huge deal. biden is too corrupt to take control and would plummet this country to the ground. that‚Äôs my opinion though...
You are spewing a series of disproven headlines.  Biden / Harris will Mark the end of the Republic... their loyalties are not with the American people.  I cannot accept that.
New York State‚Äôs Attorney General Letitia James Will Deliver Justice. Inmate Donald Trump, January 20, 2020!!!   President Joe Biden November 3, 2020.
This is exactly why people who say Trump and Biden are the same are completely wrong.
Trent Lott had to resign for bragging that he supported Strom Thurmond. Biden befriended Thurmond and is the nominee of the Democratic Party for President of the United States. Let that sink in.
Yes. The ones that baffle me are "Republicans for Biden"? If you vote for Biden and the progressive left agenda you really aren't a Republican.ü§î
Speaking of Hunter....WHAT ever happened to the whole Ukrainian Biden story? It just disappeared.
Joe Biden¬†said in an interview Wednesday that some funding should ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be redirected from police, amid calls from some in his party to "defund the police" in the¬†wake of the protests¬†across the country.
This  defunding bullshit is surreal, as it is.  But then, coming this fall: The DOJ (i.e. Bill Barr) releases some bullshit about Biden in attempt to delegitimize Biden as a candidate.  It will be framed so any denial by Biden or Dems will only appear suspect.  That's a coup
That should disqualify Biden completely for consideration but instead he is the Democratic candidate.  Insane.
‚Äú‚Å¶ is the diet cola, the light beer of presidential candidates.‚Äù  ‚Å¶  #TWGRPS
Trump has not violated the constitution- he is systematically returning control back to the people, rather than the corrupt career politicians.   Example - how can You not objectively have an issue with what Biden and his son did/are doing to Ukraine?
Biden said he would sign it if it comes with a solid funding plan.   He is just not campaigning on it.   To win a general, can't be too specific. There are groups that like their current coverage. Kaiser, Culinary Workers, Tricare...
‚ÄúAnd you know who really doesn't have it? ‚Å¶ .‚Äù #TWGRPS
She was caught by the Biden suprise.
Biden isn‚Äôt currently in government. Trump is the head of the executive branch.   See the difference?   He doesn‚Äôt owe the country‚Äôs assignment editors crap.
I‚Äôm not joking, if you don‚Äôt plan on voting for Biden, unfollow me. I‚Äôm not dealing with this shit, you either want Trump to win, or you deal with the lesser of two evils. And if you choose Trump winning, I don‚Äôt want you in my life. At all. Leave.

Well maybe she is the Biden whisperer.
Additionally there is no proof either way that Biden or Trump buys only American goods. Trump is bringing manufacturing back to the US, while Biden during his 40 plus years did nothing to stop it from moving out of our country.
Trump made comments beginning in April alleging vast fraud in vote-by-mail and that USPS ineptness contributed to it. Biden picked up on it. Not baseless then, and not baseless now.
And here is Biden's boat parade!
If Joe Biden Was A Cop   Funny cause it‚Äôs true.
Biden press corps
The definitive piece on Biden came from Harper's called "No Joe" ... it's been called a "hit piece" or biased. Harper's has never failed a fact check.  It spells out his record disturbingly.  The Guardian piece I referenced
Biden‚Äôs only chance of winning
The most fundamental difference between Trump &amp; Biden?  When Trump‚Äôs interests conflict with the nation‚Äôs interests, he serves himself above all else. He will gladly see every institution, every intelligence agency burn to the ground if he could win.
"If she weren't my daughter, I would date her."  Biden didn't say that about his daughter.  That was Trump.  Biden's never paid hush money to a call girl.  That was Trump.  Biden doesn't have over 20 women accusing him of sexual assault.  That's Trump.
Let me walk through what happens if/when Biden wins; more lethal austerity for working people, more fracking, more police violence against protesters, probably another coup in Venezuela/Bolivia, definitely TPP, liberals go back to brunch and not thinking about politics.
üóë 1 headline and 2 lies.  1) Trump didn‚Äôt make up a birther lie about Kamala, he has only responded to a baiting ‚Äúreporter‚Äù who brought up a written false story about Kamala.   2) There are zero racist themes in Trumps campaign. However, you can find racist themes with Biden.
No shit!!! I‚Äôll have room in my car and gas in the tank.
Biden's viral bike ride video takes everyone back to Trump's feeble descent down a ramp
I did a lot of research into Biden a year ago. What I found disturbed me greatly. Joe spent 40 years as a Senator who never once sided w/the people against corporate America. Dems make excuses for him all the time. I despise Trump but wanted so much better. From the Guardian:
So I was thinking that Biden/Harris needs to shift there messaging to more about a ‚Äúbetter day‚Äù is on the horizon!   According to this article that type of positive messaging will be more effective with the 40% of eligible voters who are non-partisans ‚Å¶
I thought you hashtagged "settle for Biden"...
Biden hasn‚Äôt spewed out thousands upon thousands of flagrant lies like Donald and hasn‚Äôt called the free press the enemy of the people. And he wonders why the free press treats him differently?
The left is going to revolt when they find out the current condition of Joe Biden. The nomination was given to him by the DNC. There's a reason he's in the basement &amp; cannot take reporter's softball questions. He's unable to do that but the left thinks he's ready for Trump?
KH is at 90% approval with Dems. Higher than Biden. Log off here once in a while.
This is still bothering me. We're quite literally living through the United States turning to fascism and half of Twitter is "Lol, check out these forever stamps you guys #hashtags" while the other half is "It's not fascism, but if Biden wins it'll be instant Marxism."
He is right, if Biden wins, the economy falls into a depression.
Haven‚Äôt liked Biden since the Anita Hill debacle. His trashing of Hillary made it worse. Will always b mad that this past admin did nothing 2 support Hillary during her run &amp; did nothing 2 halt the fraudulent election outcome. If Putin steals another election, will Joe blame Hil?
I'm sure Nancy Pelosi and JOe Biden do the same to help out their constituents (LOL).

Harris was so impossibly dreadful during those hearings - she made me cringe - and embarrassed that she was an "elected official" in our United States. Not even close to being civilized or intelligent enough to be a world leader. ¬†Look out, Mr. Biden - she's a back-stabber.
Definitely should be serving time in prison! Dangerous arrangement if she works for Biden.
For those interested in knowing. god it‚Äôs nothing like we wanted but we need to settle and do what we can. PLEASE vote Biden this 2020 election

I also agree but not because trump does. Biden should do what is best for his campaign. Who and how they do questions is their call. But this campaign has been successful so far by ignoring trump more or less and should stay that way.

I dont support everything he says. Esp. always taking credit for stock mkt. I think a huge mistake. I wasnt aware of mistakes made by Obama/Biden during H1N1. It's prob unfair to blame them. Just like unfair to blame Trump. The entire world has suffered from this you cant blame
Wow...you are the reason so many people vote third party.  You are attacking other liberals, this doesn‚Äôt help your cause.  If Biden loses, you‚Äôll blame the same liberals that you viciously and proudly attack,  great job in helping elect Trump.  You must be proud
the biggest obstacle Kamala faces is being a female leader.  at some point chopping down is nauseating.  shes got a job to do for 100 pct.  just like Biden.  at the highest level folks need to be judged on that plane.  I foremost would like a good VP and President.
Mark Twain once said you should never trust a man who has only one way to spell a word. But as is always true, actions speak louder than words. In Trump's case he acts, Biden did nothing but, plagiarize. bluster, self aggrandize and lie, for over 40 years.

It's funny that Biden only comments after the meeting about c-19 was wear a mask.
I would actually flip that perspective.  We got Trump as a reaction to the neglect of the working class throughout the country.  I think a Biden presidency, run on ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change,‚Äù will set the stage for an open racist like Tom cotton.
Biden the can't do man. Perfect candidate for the democrats, they are all about the can't unless it fills thier coffers, protects their agenda of evil, or furthers thier ineptitude.

Yeah, I am bracing myself for the worst. I feel absolutely no sense of certainty that Biden will win and everything will be OK again. Our country crossed a lot of lines and keeps crossing bigger lines, who knows how far things will escalate?
I said it 4 years ago and I'llsay it again, Trump was elected due to the  'anyone but Hillary' vote. This time around, same thing is happening, only with Biden. Its like they forgot that there are more than 2 people running. We have other options. #DoYourResearch

However, one could certainly say that Joe Biden should not tout his Catholic ‚Äúfaith‚Äù when he has been spiritually separated from the Church‚Äîsince such formal heresy deprives one of the supernatural virtue of faith.
Nope! We're well past that point! If Biden's POTUS, the fascist police will cont to beat &amp; kill ppl w impunity but the diff will be them wearing pink unis in support promoting women's rights.
Your beliefs sway wherever you think the votes are. you have a history of publicly denouncing Biden saying that he‚Äôs a racist that he is a sex offender and now you‚Äôre his running mate? you laugh about your marijuana use but imprison 1500 marijuana users not dealers?

He promised he‚Äôd never cut SS or Medicare and he hasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure where you got that idea. Biden wants socialized medicine and open borders, which means an open stream of illegal aliens who want health insurance. That is unsustainable and ridiculous. Why should we pay for it?

Drew is right! Beijing Biden ran for President in 1988 and again 2008. That‚Äôs where he got his nickname 1% Joe. He never got more than 1% of the votes either time. 2% Harris is with him now.
Beijing Biden has made it clear he will mandate illegal aliens are covered in his healthcare mandate. Couple that with open borders and joy wood is right!
You mean Biden? Cuz Biden is a predator...
People, Biden has nothing to say.  Harris and her public record along with failed presidential run speaks for itself.  Dangerous duo that will appeal to uninformed lemmings and illegal migrants.
You‚Äôre missing the point like you demolition rats did in 2016. Send us video of 20 people let alone 2000 people gathering anywhere in this country today to support 1% Beijing Biden and 2% Harris. We will wait................./
This is insane!  Biden has a lot of questions to answer!  Hunter, Tara Reid and others.

I hear what ur saying and I definitely understand your anger. And if you don‚Äôt want to vote Biden then by all means don‚Äôt. But I know people who got healthcare thanks to the Medicaid expansion and that was the aca so if even one person gets healthcare cuz of Biden it‚Äôs worth it.
We know Biden can‚Äôt complete a sentence and Kamala just doesn‚Äôt make sense with her crazy rhetoric that only benefits rich politicians living in mansions somewhere

Trump is running for president, too, sweetheart. Biden has never been accused of anything besides being an affectionate uncle.   You're in a cult. Cults are for the weak minded.   You are no longer worth my time.

She is the reason Kamala is the VP choice. If Biden wins he will step as side or be removed and Clinton will be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù as the vp for harris. You and every other democrat will be the reason too. Maybe that blows wind up your ass idk but Trump won bc Hillary sucks realize that
And by the way, NOT accused doesn't mean Biden did it, but boy do you people love to spread that shit around about him, don't you? Hypocrite much?
Only one candidate is accused of raping a child. Spoiler alert: it's not Biden. Don't pretend you care about sexual assault, or men who walk in on naked teenagers brag about it to Howard Stern (easy to find interview), because you clearly don't. Which troll farm do you work at?
After doing that, suppose you are forced to choose who would have sole responsibility to take care of a newborn baby for 24 hours, Biden or Trump (neither one is allowed any assistance, including from their running mates).
A little thought experiment.  Watch this (short) clip of Biden  and then watch any clip of Trump speaking recently (even where he is facing combative and hostile reporters, which is of course nearly all the time).
Krazy Kamala is a liberal who shouldn't be anywhere near the White House.  Put her next to Biden in the White House and then you're going the wrong way that Trump works for in building up this country üôÑ.

I am aware both sides are blind to their candidates misdeeds. I am not blind to the fact that 8 women have accused Biden of sexual misconduct or that Biden Wrote and defends the Biden Crime Bill or the most disgusting act of racism between the two is Biden being pro-segregation

Hi my name is Joe Message and I approve this Biden lol üòÇ
Animals endorse Joe Biden üêæ‚ù§ #BidenHarris2020
Is that an early picture of Biden?
Better question, can Joe Biden? #DementiaJoe
If the issue is Ducey then we need to fire/recall Ducey. Not sure how voting for Biden helps. The Dems are the ones playing games more so then the GOP at the moment and if not for Trump signing the EOs we still wouldn‚Äôt have shit coming to us.
I think many feel Biden has already won, but just like the first time around I believe the Moron can actually win again one way or another. I just hope if nothing else the senate can be flipped and the house stays as is and if he gets in they can make it impossible for him to do
Well he travels around the country and didnt know the Chiefs were in Missouri and called Colorado a border state. They both are a mess, but if you think Trump isn‚Äôt on that same level as Biden I don‚Äôt know what you are watching.
It‚Äôs truly insane to be honest how many people refuse to publicly even speak Trumps name out loud, but will be honestly voting for him in November. I don‚Äôt trust these polls as far as I throw them. I agree. The lead has to be 15 or more for Biden to feel somewhat secure
I know you despise Trump. But, why would you care about the Dem convention? The DNC shafted their voters two pres. primaries in a row. They handed it 2 Hillary in 16. Now after Biden supposedly won the nom, they're going to slide Kamala in after the inauguration.
If you vote for Biden your taxes will go up the Democrats have already promised that.  How do you think they are going to pay for all the free stuff they are going to give away?  The stock market will crash to Obama levels or lower.
Attacking Biden because they can‚Äôt come up with any accomplishments to talk about?  Or any plans he has for the country going forward?  Got it I think I will listen to Joe Biden. üò∑ #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
Have you ever scrolled through replies to Biden tweets? Some of the dumbest, most brainwashed people on the internet are super stoked for a mentally deficient old rich white pedo and a communist hag to restore honor and end corruption. Dear God, #TheGreatAwaking is coming.
Biden can't/won't have a rally,  this mask wearing is his subliminal rally.
Ummm...Greg I didn‚Äôt make up the nickname for Hiden Biden   ‚Äú1% Joe" ‚Äî  an insulting reference to Biden's past performances in the 1988 and 2008 Democratic primaries.
Lol. This is the 3rd time Biden has ran for President.  He got his nickname 1% joe because he only got 1% of the vote the last time he ran for President. Harris only got 2% of the Democrat vote when she just ran for president. You‚Äôre welcome!
Joe Biden is gonna win. Trump will lose by a landslide.
Dude, you posted the same article twice. I‚Äôve responded with memes showing my support for Biden because this is getting boring and you‚Äôre just flooding the field with BS. Now you want to segue to Obama? Who are you trying to impress?
And, I love Joe's ads that indicate he ran the successful recovery act. Remember the Obama-Biden recovery? Those who could find jobs, usually had to take on 2 to 3 part time jobs just to survive. NOW that's a recovery?

Good God...the only thing Biden has going for him is bloviating political rhetoric...
I was hoping &amp; praying that Joe Biden would choose you, for his running mate.  We need to STOP Trump, from harming America anymore than he already has!!!!!  Thank you, for being you!!!!!!!  You are a real asset to America and to the Vice President.

"For all his klutziness and indiscretions, Biden‚Äôs overall message appeals to our better angels and hopes, while Trump‚Äôs appeals to our demons and fears."
So Hunter &amp; James Biden (Joe's brother) have been making money off the family name because of Joe being Senator/VP for a long time. That doesn't change the fact Joe is running against the WORST President ever &amp; we'll still vote for him. The Trump crime family is the greater evil.
It votes for Biden or it gets the Trump again.
Isn't that the point of the choice?  Kamala Harris is political 'chameleon' with eye on 'Biden's job'  #FoxNews
We've 80 days thereabouts b4 mandatory Biden bullshit or hopefully Trump pulls his trump cards and wins this poker match. Or its a lame duck called Biden and the liars hand called Kamala Harris.
Those that trust Trump on the economy need to remember, it was Biden who oversaw the 2009 Recovery act. Trump actually did nothing for the economy but ride on Biden's coattails.
Where‚Äôs Hunter Biden???
She doesn‚Äôt just think he‚Äôs a racist. She thinks he‚Äôs a creeper too.

The problem with this is that it‚Äôs a hypothetical situation. Nobody knows how many people could be killed by a Biden admin because it hasn‚Äôt happened yet. With Trump, we already know and it‚Äôs getting worse every day.
The definitive piece on Biden came from Harper's called "No Joe" ... it's been called a "hit piece" or biased. Harper's has never failed a fact check.  It spells out his record disturbingly.  The Guardian piece I referenced
Let me walk through what happens if/when Biden wins; more lethal austerity for working people, more fracking, more police violence against protesters, probably another coup in Venezuela/Bolivia, definitely TPP, liberals go back to brunch and not thinking about politics.
I did a lot of research into Biden a year ago. What I found disturbed me greatly. Joe spent 40 years as a Senator who never once sided w/the people against corporate America. Dems make excuses for him all the time. I despise Trump but wanted so much better. From the Guardian:
From the BIDEN Republicans
This is still bothering me. We're quite literally living through the United States turning to fascism and half of Twitter is "Lol, check out these forever stamps you guys #hashtags" while the other half is "It's not fascism, but if Biden wins it'll be instant Marxism."
He is right, if Biden wins, the economy falls into a depression.
I'm sure Nancy Pelosi and JOe Biden do the same to help out their constituents (LOL).
I‚Äôm saying it now. President Biden.
Joe Biden fundamentally doesn't understand how our government works and is 100% unqualified to run this country. Governors don't make laws, the legislature does. Any "mandates" by governors or the president are illegal  and unenforceable #unmaskamerica #covidlies #NeverBiden
you are the one doing political interference by attempting to interfere with the Presidential election to help Biden, do you really think people are too dumb to see what you are doing?
No, fascists Biden and Harris: You cannot mandate #masks.  They have been proven to be a health hazard, and you cannot mandate a health hazard. Here's the proof:
The Media and the Democratic party are babysitting Biden.
They just doing what they told  Right now USPS &gt; anything  The way it should be  Joe Biden pedo &gt; everything
She‚Äôs a liar. She doesn‚Äôt even like Biden. She‚Äôs just trying to be president
Apparently people think Yang will lose in 2024 if Biden wins in 2020. Idk where why or how that makes sense.

I like presidents who weren't born rich. They understand what it's like to struggle. They learned empathy,  Biden &amp; Harris understand. Obama &amp; Clinton understood.   tRump was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, which he swallowed &amp; pooped out.   #VoteBlue2020  #BidenHarris2020

Joe Biden is a clear cut racist but getting a pass, like how republicans give trump a pass for their ‚Äúparty‚Äù we deserve better than 2 racist old men
Even male actors don't put their arms around women for photos anymore to show they aren't sexually assaulting the woman. . It's easy to accuse sexual assault. It is a genuinely disgusting problem. I want to give both sides the benefit of doubt. With Biden.... WTF
Started with Beto O'Rourke and worked my down. I think Biden was the weakest of all Dems running.
Kamala Harris and Biden only one will be in charge and it's not Uncle Joe. Harris will try to run the country because Biden cannot. Kamala cannot run the country. Foreign affairs Iran North Korea China she has no experience to stand up to these countries. Just a bobblehead.

This was pretty eye opening....  (If Biden actually is the nominee.... I have a feeling the DNC might change nominees before the convention due to health concerns - IMO)
It sad to think we live in such a world that people would do this without remorse while the rest of world allows it.   It is also quite annoying that Americans can be more wrapped up in Biden vs Trump than care about about how we are giving billions to that evil government.
Well everyone you should asked Biden and Harris since they raised 50 million dollars in two days  maybe they should give everyone 1200 dollars or as much as they can until the Democrats come back from there break.
This makes perfect sense. IMO he is being BLACKMAILED by Harris.

Second this but won't relax until Inauguration Day if Biden wins. And perhaps not even then.   Since this is my first national election in Arizona, relief from the constant barrage of election-related ads will be more relief than I can properly describe.
No one can claim that this is a sound clip. Biden only speaks in incoherent sound clips and in no sane world is this rant acceptable.
How selfless of her! I hear she's good at cleaning up problems #Bleachbit   #FoxNews

But in the spirit of talking about creepy pervs in politics, let‚Äôs look back at your main man, Biden. Have you just been in a cave this whole time? Or are you blatantly ignoring VERY similar claims against him, simply bc some of the policies he believes in align with your morals?
Damn right! Let's get this virus under control. Everyone can wear a mask for the protection of everyone else. It's the decent and patritotic thing to do for our country.  Biden calls for mask mandates in all 50 states: 'It's about saving Americans' lives'

Vote for Biden. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
REAL TALK:  Joe Biden would be BY FAR the oldest elected president... ever.   We have witnessed him already losing it‚Äî he can‚Äôt even keep it together on the campaign trail. He would almost be a decade older than Reagan.   This is a serious concern about his capacity for the job.

One thing about Biden‚Äîevery year he gets more hair than he had the year before.
What part is an exaggeration? Are saying that Biden didn‚Äôt argue in favor of segregation in schools, or that multiple women haven‚Äôt accused Biden of touching them inappropriately.
He‚Äôs not leaving period, Biden alrady said he will prosecute.
Hillary wants to serve in a Biden administration. First of all there won't be a Biden administration. And secondly there won't be a Biden administration! Bye bye Hillary, bye bye pedo Joe, bye bye heels up Harris!

It is not just a vote against Trump it is also a vote against Biden. There is no arguement in the world that would get me to vote for a candidate with a history of racism and multiple sexual assault allegations.
The last stand of hate, fear and racism. the final days of Hitlers hate filled days in Germany, the last stand of apartheid in South Africa, the last days of the slavery fueled southern Confederacy. Yes, vote like your life depends on it. America depends on it. Biden/Harris 2020!

Can you pin point what Biden has done in 40 years in office 8 being vice president?...that has helped us...anything...
Ahhh man....see I wish Biden would get asked questions..."After 40 years in office....can you tell us 1 thing you've accomplished?...Better yet..8 years vice president"
It was totally preventable - GET  out before Monday and me in - do not blow this off!!!!! This entire debate season was a nightmare for all of America with out my national presence - Change this for me - call Biden - get his head out of his....this is serious.
You and Joe Biden should be roommates in the old folks home. You both have dementia.
1/ The Entire message of the Democratic Party is "Trump is bad." They offer NOTHING positive for America's struggling workers. Hillary did the same in 2016 and look what happened.  Nate Silver just gave Biden a 71% chance of winning and Trump, only 21%.
not a biden stan, he's just in favor of harm reduction. he hates biden but will vote for him to get trump out
1/ Joe Biden is Not radical. He is a crooked corporatist and was right of center on most things, but not Good right. Bad Right as in wanting to cut Social Security and Medicaid.
Duh, he‚Äôs on a mission to take Biden out since his boss can‚Äôt beat him in a straight up fair election.

The people that are going to vote for Trump, are going to do it.  The people that aren't, are going to vote for Biden, or stay at home.  Period.  People's minds are made up.  Now it is about ground game and getting people's asses to the polls, or getting their ballots in the mail

'I'm disgusted with Trump': Arizona Republican explains why he's voting for Biden
Biden is not behind these superficial statements. Mandated masks is a leftist power/control grab, from the DNC oligarchy.
Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical to defeating Trump. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.
I really appreciate Joe Biden wanting to force people to wear masks for their own good sincerely Satan
i mean has she said anything that would indicate she's not anti-capitalist? her view that ppl should vote for biden to prevent trump reelection is a valid one, whether you agree with it or not (your view is valid too, although i disagree with it). it doesn't make her a lib
we have valid reasons for voting for biden as well. we won't consider voting green because we don't think they can win. i live a state that has shifted from red to purple, my vote actually matters and can affect the outcome. it's different for ppl in solid red/blue states
Cuomo is as brainless as Pelosi, Biden, Harris and anyone else who would be stupid enough to put a patient in a nursing home being positive for covid-19. Try again.
not many ppl are saying you have to. some of them just want to have a discussion on this. they want to persuade others to vote for biden as well, which is no different from any other debating. but yes there are some who are vote shaming, though they are still leftist
Babies however are getting wise now to Biden and have learned how to duck, bobb and weave as Creepy Joe moves in for the kill.
When he opened his mouth as Obama‚Äôs VP he pushes things forward on gay marriage. So no we didn‚Äôt keep his mouth shut. You don‚Äôt know what Biden‚Äôs policy or record are. Obviously.

Biden is a fascist.
Biden and Harris give me hope.  Thanks for the walk and talks.  Love them.
That's not enough to get my vote for one sexist and racist over a more sexist racist person. It's great you and A D have healthcare and an education, but what how about all the poor people that Biden and Harris  will ignore after being elected? I can't support that.
Are you talking about Biden politicizing his sons death for sympathy?
Nothing anyone can come up with about Biden and Harris can hold a candle to the Cult45 and the most corrupt disgusting administration ever.
Joe Biden doesn't know the difference between "volunteering" and "mandating". This entire speech was a total lie. Move to China you authoritarian, unpatriotic f*ck #NeverBiden #NeverKamala #unmaskamerica

We found our true leader - Xi Jinping Biden - a wanna be dictator
Biden could easily say "Because Donald Trump has disgraced the office that we hold dear, with his unwarranted and untrue accusations about my running mate, I will not dignify this in any form".
Day one of Biden in office he should get a medal
i have this mindset, and i do question how the party nominated biden. bernie was a far better pick but either more voters chose "electability" over m4a, or it was rigged. but biden is the result, and i'd rather see him in office than trump
They are such doubled standard people.  The more Biden opens his mouth the more Americans see big government like China

I am so sick of people confusing Harris as the obvious choice with her being the "safe" choice. Every ticket with a woman on it in US history as lost, and Biden put a multiracial Black woman on his. That's not a "safe" choice.
Are you trying to convince me that Biden sucks? Why? When did I indicate I don't already know that?

Lifelong AZ Republican: I'm voting Biden because I'm disgusted
we all believe we're correct. let's just respect our comrades even when we disagree. i respect you and your decision to not vote for biden. i only ask for that same respect
i've had this conversation with a lot of ppl, and usually it's been respectful. i never intended to shame anyone for not voting for biden. if you vote green party i have nothing against that. but it seems like you take personal issue with my voting decisions
Kamala Harris last year on Biden's praise for racist segregationists  via
Fox's favorite lush said Biden won't make the ballot. Trump said he has an October surprise. Does Pirro know something we don't? Or is it just another pink elephant in the room?

If by Joe Biden you mean you do. Then yes
Arizona Republicans for Biden - we need someone to unite our country and someone we can believe in #BidenHarris2020
im not a big fan of the Biden/Harris ticket, but the fact that the right is already questioning Kamala‚Äôs birth in the US (born in California) is filthy
My gosh Marci. I obv meant in this conversation no one is denying racism/sexism exist. Biden is not a racist. Kamala Harris is not a white man. Biden won black support bc he earned it over decades. It‚Äôs offensive 2suggest that unless people voted your way they have false beliefs
Bwahahaha ok who was using press conferences as campaign rallies? Can you all remind me please?  Fox News: Trump hits back at Biden after call for national mask mandate: ‚ÄòStop playing politics with the virus‚Äô.
The Amendment says Dec 15th 1791 this is going to be a tuff one for any politician read what I have posted for you Joe Biden.

Hey Joe Biden I think you need to read this it's very important
well first of all not everyone arguing this point is a liberal. getting tired of the leftists who gatekeep the community over things like this. plenty of leftists are voting for biden, and that doesn't make them not leftists
Hey Joe Biden while your at it why don't you come and take all my black belts when you knock on my door.
I know I don‚Äôt know how you actually make the doc and support Biden. Especially if you really care about mass incarceration but she must just be a black trauma peddler.
Last month 10 million guns were sold Biden says if he wins he coming for your guns.
How do you not understand the very simple idea that if you are born in Oakland, California, you are a citizen? Is this something that you can imagine in your fever dreams that Biden‚Äôs vetting would ignore.
Totally unacceptable.  The  and Biden campaign need to address this now. They can start by giving  a whole lot more than 60 paltry seconds to speak and adding  to the roster as well.
Biden says he is coming for your guns well I say how will you defend our great nation
The fact that Biden has been so aggressively against legalizing marijuana and Kamala thinks locking people up for possession is hilarious should be enough to turn off... 78% of Democrats.
Are you going to hold Joe Biden to a standard? Just asking for 80 million friends?
. needs to be working to *strengthen* his support among Latinos &amp; progressive‚Äì‚Äìomitting the deportation moratorium in this way undermines both efforts. The campaign must correct this immediately.
So sick of seeing  and their fake ass polls.   Biden-Harris up seven points?   Give me a break.
He is calling you Kamala Harris and Biden Dumb and Dumber hahaha
Joe can destroy trump. Joe Biden has the brains heart to lead our country. #BidenHarris2020
Hopefully #friendOfThePod Sen Harris can finally help book VP Biden on the pod. COME ON THE POD
The promise of a deportation moratorium was one of the most important commitments  made on immigration &amp; human rights during his campaign.  It must be included on his website, and the ticket must own and defend this crucial policy.
Everyone who is preaching for Biden because he‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter than Trump‚Äù preaching ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù that guy said ‚Äúpoor people are just as smart as white people‚Äù my god
thanks for the respect. i do know who they are and why i'm voting. in my eyes i just can't see how trump and biden are equally bad, so i feel an obligation to vote for the lesser evil. a nice end to the conversation tho, thanks!
Biden has been wrong about everything for 40 years the only thing he holds steady on is his constant racism! #Trump2020 #NowMoreThanEver
Biden is trying to mandate wearing masks for 3 months, and then adds he would talk to the governors about mandating. In other words, he is being the authoritarian but admits that decision is up to the states, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP IS DOING
I agree James! Biden is so far ahead in the polls it reminds me of the night trump won!
at the very least, we *know* that trump will continue to accelerate the pandemic. we don't know if biden will or not (but most likely he won't). so we have a better gamble with biden on this issue
And Biden ahead in the polls! Oh it‚Äôs MSM polls overseen by fact checkers! ü§£ü§£
. is right. As a delegate to the  I joined with him &amp; 100s of Biden, Bernie &amp; Warren delegates in voting NO on the platform because it excludes #MedicareForAll.  Especially during this pandemic, it is time to #DrawTheLine and guarantee health care to all as a right.
Tulsi debunked Clinton and Harris, the DNC, Russian plant, 3rdy party spoiler conspiracy theory and did as she said she was going 2 do from day 1. Support the eventual nom. U dont see her actively push her supporters 2 vote Biden, say how Biden will b the next FDR.Bernie does tho
I know I speak for many, many Americans in saying "We're certainly glad YOU'RE here  with us right now so you and future-President Biden can help lead us out of this darkness". Your mother was so wise, and definitely raised you and your sister right!
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews
"Murder of innocent children is essential healthcare service." - Joe Biden
Trump doesn't have a pet. Let's face it any pet he would own would bite him.  Why doesn't some journalist ask him why Biden and Harris don't like cows?
I sleep well every night. So no difference for me. Even if Joe Biden wins the election there is so much damage done to the country that will need to be fixed. Life isn't going to switch to all good like flipping a light switch. Anyone thinking it will isn't being realistic.
This might actually sway the polls in Trump's favor. If Biden is smart he won't commit to anything with her until after Nov 3.
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
would biden call covid-19 "the chinese virus" and claim it's a hoax to prevent his reelection? would he encourage states to hastily reopen and for his supporters to not wear masks? would he tell americans to not listen to the cdc or who? would he hold rallies in a pandemic?
okay, all true, all fair points. but would biden roll back protections for queer ppl? would biden eliminate the aca and daca? would biden write rules explicitly allowing discrimination against queer ppl? would biden incite his base to violence and spew anti-science rhetoric?
What an ass . He can‚Äôt call for anything. Watch now we will have Biden supporters with masks and the rest of the country will take them off !!!
yeah, i mean it is one issue. you need to show me how as a whole trump and biden are the same. not "they agree on these points", but "biden would cause equal the harm as trump would". i know biden is bad, but i'm still not convinced he's as bad as trump
Judicial Watch uncovered Secret Service records showing Hunter Biden traveled to China five time and also visited Moscow. But  didn‚Äôt get all the records, so JW were forced to go to court to find out more. ITS ALL BEING COVERED UP!!  WHERE ARE REPUBLICANS?? #JudicialWatch
but bringing up a single issue that he and trump are identical on doesn't argue against that. i brought up issues that trump is worse than biden on, so the appropriate thing is to counter those claims, not yell "whatabout israel??"
I keep getting reported by Biden/Harris followers.
OK, so now what do you add here? What is the contrast to Senate Democrats, which Mark Kelly would join? What is contrast to Biden/Harris?
He in fact does not have the authority to do that and neither would Joe Biden.
it was still odd for them to bring it up, because it didn't help anyone's point. trump and biden both support israel, so why mention it at all?
Sincerely, &amp; respectfully, I seek to understand.  First, know that I appreciate GOP or Ex-GOP biden votes as a sacrifice.  Thank you.  So in that context - help me - "Kamala messed up on Kavanaugh"  My objective = understand, learn.
We can and SHOULD be critical of EVERY candidate because they are not perfect and should be held accountable. While Tr*mp is the worst candidate here we shouldn‚Äôt just give Biden/Harris a free pass because they‚Äôre the lesser of two evils
There are two options in 2020 for conservatives   1. Biden wins, Republicans go back to being conservatives and win back the house and Senate in 2022 2. Trump wins, nobody ever checks the spending, we spiral out of control with debt and race riots.   There isn‚Äôt a third option.
It took a pandemic and a full country shut down to get to Obama and Biden‚Äôs highest point in the economy. So yea, keep shoveling the B.S.
I am proud of my government and how the world views the USA...‚Ä¶.Pre-2016!! I have been crying for the last 3.5 years. After watching Biden/Harris I am still crying ..... tears of happiness! Anybody else?
When I say there's no moral high ground, I mean between Trump and Biden. Their policy overlap is pretty high. It's just rhetoric that changes. I will not support someone who is evil, whether that be Trump or Biden.
Then they sure don't want their Daughters around Biden.
Lmao. Ignorance. Trump called for more testing not less. You must be a Biden Harris Fan. In that case just start giving up your rights. üòÇ
They are so stupid. Kanye will take away votes from Trump, not from Biden.
The difference Matt is that the Obama/Biden administration dealt with the problem unlike what Trump has done. See Matt, Trump ignored the growing pandemic, said it would be gone in a few weeks. Obama/Biden immediately worked on the issue, didn‚Äôt disband the pandemic response team
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
i do care about each of those. what's suspicious is that this person seems to act like israel is the worst enemy to humanity. like why bring israel into the conversation? trump and biden both support israel, so why being it up as a point against biden? it's odd to me
i already read that thread. what's your point? i don't like kamala either, but that doesn't change anything for me. in fact i dislike biden more than kamala. still not as much as i despise trump
First question do you still believe Tara Reade? Next is joe Biden still the racist you called him in your campaign?  How many men did you sleep with to reach your goals? Were they all married men
I was wrong about Biden. He‚Äôs not the incoherent bum I thought he was.
um, no, you can oppose fascism and vote for biden. in fact, we're voting for biden to prevent a fascist from staying in office
if biden were to do the same shit trump has been doing, he wouldn't get reelected. he knows that he'll have to reverse trump's policies if he's going to get a second term (that's what he's running on now). so there's also that accountability holding him to a certain standard
biden would just be the obama administration again. it is obvious that trump is far far far worse than obama. trump restricted rights of queer ppl, obama set protections (that trump later overturned). so it's a reasonable assumption that biden will not be as bad as trump
sorry but this i just can't wrap my head around. i don't see how anyone  can think trump and biden are equally bad, especially during this pandemic that trump has been accelerating through science-denialism

Marxism at its worst. Biden is a puppet but a dangerous puppet. He has sold his soul to Satan.
A miracle if Biden makes it till election day. Harris and her nutty past ,with it's many contradictions, will stick out like a sore thumb. Trump is going to Reganize the Democrats.
I‚Äôm not saying ¬´don‚Äôt vote for Biden¬ª I‚Äôm saying that the Ds are sick assholes who are saying ¬´fuck you if you want #MedicareForAll or someone who isn‚Äôt horrible, if you don‚Äôt want trump you‚Äôll vote for Biden !!!¬ª like they‚Äôre damned terrorists.
i'm NOT saying all this to persuade anyone to vote for biden. i'm saying this so you can understand my perspective. maybe then you can stop calling me and others "liberals" and "faux-leftists", when i'm literally an ancom. we don't need this gatekeeping and purity testing
The most reliable constituency in dem primaries in black women. And they overwhelmingly choose Biden. Those are the on the ground numbers state after state. So. No conspiracy here. Just democracy. Not perfect. But there it is.
Joe Biden said 150 million Americans died from guns and  120 million from COVID-19
if you don't understand why i plan to vote for biden: i'm just so terrified of of trump getting re-elected that i'm willing to do anything to prevent it. trump has taken away some of my rights as a queer trans person; this is personal for me
i will vote for biden because i can't take another 4 years of trump. he's already taken away some of the few rights i had as a queer/trans person. i want to prevent fascism from taking a stronger hold in the country; that may not be "change" but it is prevention
I've been going through all the bad people in the OT Bible casting them w/ Dems... Some are easy Jezebel - HRC. Ahab is of course WJC. Haman is BHO. Working on Nanshy, Schumer, &amp; Biden. Kamala plays Potiphar's wife. Satan - Soros. Job - General Flynn...
Today We Vote Donald Trump Out #electionday  #election #election2020 #trump #trumppence #biden #bidenharris #biden2020  #trump2020  #amazonWhat about Obama‚Äôs lies? Biden? Hillary? Pelosi? Schumer? How did they get so rich while they‚Äôre in public office? You never thought of asking these questions of your party? Perhaps you should before casting your vote in November
Keep on believing that Biden will save you. You are in for a rude awakening if he wins.
Biden chooses communist to head his digital Arizona campaign. Keep this in mind as we head to November.
Why not recommend that Congress stay in section until a compromised deal can get done? They might listen to you and you might even get a cabinet spot under a Biden/Harris administration
So many people on my tl are employing each other to settle for Biden/Harris. But will think that anyone that voted for Trump/Pence is full throated MAGA. Like Republicans didn‚Äôt settle for Trump when it came to him and Clinton.
Media on Trump ‚Äúhe‚Äôs temperamentally unfit‚Äù Media on Biden ‚Äúlook he rides his bike‚Äù
Joe Biden has been expressing his opinions on what needs to be done for months!  I guess no one in the WH knows how to read.
Disappointed, but not surprised about Kamala. The other highly unpopular candidate that the establishment chooses for us? Of course. Considering Biden's age she might actually be president.  Only going to be that much harder to bully them from the left now.
Very possible that I might change. She emphasizes the worst parts of Biden‚Äôs political history.
NEW: Pres. #Trump already out with a campaign ad against #Biden‚Äôs VP pick Sen. #KamalaHarris
Fortification pick; if Biden has to resign or otherwise makes it through his first term (if elected) and decides he doesn't want to re-run, Harris will be "in the pipe" and ready to roll.  I think she was always the right choice strategically and politically.

I'm sure you are praying for as many to vote as possible before the debates start. biden will make a complete fool of himself.
He has no clue!. Obama lead the way. He didn't mind using Biden. How much was your damn family get paid.  Shame on you all, including his family.  You all really Care.
biden is a pandering old fool.
Are you on board with the other government officials writing letters/signing petitions to get Congress in the pull this postmaster general dejoy in for questioning, and possible removal? If you and VPJoe Biden can you do something/anything along those lines that would be great!
I would have if Sanders was the nominee, but I'll be staying in this election Voting for a far right Republican or Center right Republican isn't a choice I can stomach There is no substantive difference between Trump and Biden and neither will improve my life so both can fuck off

You‚Äôre gonna have to do a lot better than that if you want a pardon. Endorsement and complete and total oppo against Biden. Maybe float some fake conspiracy theory. ‚ÄúInsider leaks never before released‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt have to be believable. Pucker up buddy.
which begs the question:  Which will be worse, 4 more years of Trump and then we're done with him, or 12 years of corporate controlled neoliberals Biden/Harris?
There's also this:  Trump wins and we're stuck with him for another 4 years, then he's out.  Biden wins, and we're likely stuck with him and Kamala Harris for 12 years if Biden bows out after 2 years due to "health reasons". Kamala takes the reins and can run for reection twice.
The Biden/Harris Campaign Launches four more Ads in¬†Arizona
That's my thinking too. Biden is a figurehead POTUS for the first 2 years, then bows out due to "health reasons".  Kamala officially becomes POTUS and because there's less than two years remaining in the term, she would be eligible to run for reelection twice.  So yeah, 12 years.
It keeps Biden from aimlessly meandering around the "set". He stays seated long enough to video him. Kind of like a baby pen.
I understand the other. I understand Trump, though it is problematic. How the heck can you vote for Biden?
UAE Publicly Recognize The State of Israel. HISTORIC. There are Democrats in Congress who do not. Breaking News Biden says wear a Mask.
Even her her laugh is phony. Side-by-side she is as White as Biden.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
Wrong.  It's like having Trump shit on you and taking a shower to wash it off.  Then moving away from Trump and getting Biden who won't shit on us.
Bill Biden?
Failure - Worst President Ever!!! 2nd Fattest! Worst Leadership Style. Most Americans dies in one year due to inaction on his watch. Most divisive President. Racist, Orange, Wild Comb Over. One Term. Defeated by an older man a black woman. This is what he will be known for.
The world will CELEBRATE WHEN YOU ARE GONE.  My bet is you will be in Russia before Biden moves into the "PEOPLES HOUSE'.  It is the only way you will stay out of jail.  I'll bet he makes a deal with Biden and sends you back...roflmao
I don't understand how this is satire. It's simply the kind of bad argument certain kinds of politically pretentious types would make, no indication you aren't serious. Your bio says "Never Biden" in it. You may know you're kidding, but to random Twitterites, how do we know?
I could care less for Kamala (and Biden for that matter).  But how much control did she *really* have over those issues?  To what degree was she truly involved?   And how much power did she have to reverse these issues?
So Refreshing to read all this and Not hearing any name calling!  Just so Peaceful and Facts Thank You Joe Biden !!   üá∫üá∏‚≠ê
USPS sucks because Bruh is cutting services so SEE USPS sucks? What the hell is wrong with you? Would this be okay if Obama or Biden did it? Mail in voting in AZ, FL, NC. Trump says those places are a-okay but not anywhere else!
Of course taxes will be raised, after the mess you created. The difference when PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN raises taxes is it will be the rich 1% that have to pay!
"Get back ON the plantation!" (Harris kept people in prison past their release date to continue to use them as essentially slave labor, And we all know about Biden)
Republicans are Now VOTING for BIDEN !  üá∫üá∏  Let's Go Arizona üå†
Pelosi is as out of touch as Biden. TRUMP SAID THE MEDIA'S REPORTING ABOUT THE VIRUS WAS A HOAX NOT THE FACT OF THE VIRUS! Why in the name of truth can't conservatives tell the truth about this every time this cow says that? To quote Biden,  "C'mon man."
But there is no backwards for people in my position. When you hit rock bottom you have nothing to lose. YOU might have something to lose, but I don't care about you, I care about me. And since Biden will do nothing to improve my life I'll be staying home. D party can suck it
It‚Äôs Biden for Christ sake! They know he‚Äôs a republican!
Uugh, I owe you nothing,  don't know you and once again,  since you rely on the leftwing rag Politico for contemporary Church history you're not looking for truth and therefore you're as untrustworthy as a Joe Biden apology or as Kamala Harris being African American.
Best revenge is buy face shields, wear a mask, distance 6 feet and vote in person and lets be counted so overwhelming on election night Trump gets to hear the election called for Biden-Harris.
All voting Biden buy face shields. wear over masks &amp; vote in person. Horse is out of the barn. Trump has already set up vote by mail with chaos, confusion &amp; in person votes will be counted on election night preventing Trump tying election up in court or Barr SCOTUS interference.
Biden raises $26M in 24 hours after VP announcement...  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Most people are OK masking-up indoors where one can't socially-distance. But if Biden becomes associated with the masked alone in their cars/hiking in the desert/jogging in a park folks, he'll just look like a nut, and will turn off the 'middle ground' folks he needs to win over.
Investigate Biden and Harris? No surprise.
I would bet Biden loses. the socialist Demoncats corrupt impeachment of Trump, the smearing and lies about Brett Kavanaugh riots around America. The Demoncats have awakened a sleeping giant

Nope someone‚Äôs wrong somewhere trump is running the country the right way instead of the wrong way Biden wants everyone and there brother to come in and blow up everyone and he wants illegals to roam freely and gangs as well think about it we want trump
Why should the  want COVID-19 relief?  If Trump wins, they have four more years of graft and corruption.  If he loses they blame Biden for the mass death and depression.   They obviously don‚Äôt give a damn about anything or America.
It's really simple- all Kamala has to do to get my unwavering support, is to just keep her word! #MedicareForAll   Unfortunately, there's about 0% chance she will keep her word; she will fall in-line behind Biden.
Of course!!!!! Go Biden/Harris!!!!
Utter shite! I'm reluctantly voting for Biden/Harris, but I'm NEVER going to stop speaking truth about their horrible policies. #MedicareForAll

Hum... nobody wants 4 more years of terror, death and destruction under Trump.   It‚Äôs not a hard choice.   Also... Harris is a great selection and Biden will make a great president.  Why try to stir up drama where none exists?  Why not focus on the terrible pandemic, instead?

I'm so confused. Biden and Harris are taking away cows? #VoteBidenHarris2020
Joe Biden is awfully dry.

Masks aren't good and shouldn't be mandated plus a president can't order it anyway.  Trump isn't a tyrant, Biden is panting to be one.
WHO writes your nightly news headlines?  Trump didn‚Äôt BLAST Biden for his stupid mask mandate!! SOOO tired of NBC‚Äôs bias against this president!! Any mention tonight of the PEACE Agreement between Israel and the Arab Emerates?? That‚Äôs NATIONAL News by the way!!

Who is 'they'? Are you talking about democrats? Biden, Harris?  You are fearmongering, which can be argued is not Christian - especially when there are no facts to support it.
How much good can AOC actually say about Biden though?
That's what it looks like. He'll annex after our elections, either handing Biden a political crisis, or giving tRump a distraction while he dismantles Soc.Sec &amp; Medicare.
My hellworld prediction: By 2024 AOC will be a lot closer to Biden/Pelosi/Harris in ideology than anyone would like to admit
the could be a tremendous influx of Democrats fleeing New York or just plain old coon ass war bosses doing for Biden what they always did for Huey Long.

It might be real issue if it wasn't for the fact almost every single person is now already wearing masks when near others or in a store  Biden wants to be the Communist dictator they all accuse Trump of being. Plus it's just bullshit politics  And why didn't Biden take questions?
45 will always be 45. 46 will be Biden, or 45 will continue for another 4 yrs. DNC &amp; Dem elites rejected the will of the people and gave us a corporate controlled career politician with dementia as their candidate. If Dem's lose again, they have no one to blame but themselves.
#JoeBiden just said he would autocraticly mandate everyone in all 50 States must wear a mask in public. If u are taking a walk in Montana Biden would arrest you.  Of course, Biden dictated no mandate or arrests for people criminally looting stores &amp; burning down neighborhoods
Will Birthers take a look at Trump's situation at birth ? Biden and Harris were welcomed into this world by loving parents. Isn't that more important? Trump's parents, sadly, never loved him.

Let's talk money, #Biden's plan isn't "sever" since - Most players can gain as short-term that are taxed as ordinary income. Currently long-term capital gains tax rate is 0%, 15%, 20% depending on taxable income &amp; filing status. Hire a good accountant, - be LLC - it works out.
This is why democrats can't get their party in line. Too many republicans like the Clintons, Obama, Biden, Pelosi &amp; Schumer are dividing it. About 40% of dems are progressive, that leaves 60% divided among the other factions. Dissing 40% of the base is not smart, especially now.
YOUR TURN: Joe Biden running mate Sen. Kamala Harris called the Trump administration "failed government" &gt;&gt;   Do you agree?
With every possible step the DNC could take to help Biden win progressive votes, they're doing the opposite. Kamala antagonizes them &amp; Biden's campaign mirrors Hillary's with no hope of progressive policies only offering the "Biden's not as bad" line. They're going to lose again.
And yet, Biden has a dog. And Trump doesn't.

There‚Äôs a whole sect of liberals who don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden/Harris because they have done nothing but attempt to woo current trump voters. You‚Äôre not going to. Work on getting the left back, not going more central. That‚Äôs how you‚Äôll win.

This is flat out untrue. Anyone who took the time to listen to all of the words that Trump spoke would know he was referring to the normal people on both sides of disagreement. NOT the extreme of either. Biden...take your Aricept.
Just saw a Trump ad attacking Biden. Narrator sounded like Sam Elliot. I REALLY hope it wasn't actually him and just an impersonator.
#BidenHarris2020 Yep, I said it. Your only excuse is you‚Äôre sure Biden is so senile that it‚Äôs not really him you‚Äôre voting for.
Goodbye tRump!  Hello Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   üß¢BUILD BACK BETTERüß¢ üá∫üá∏üíôüá∫üá∏ üó≥ üì¨
my instructor told me do a paper specifically on ‚Äúhow NOT to do business-And fail in life‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know who to pick, he said why don‚Äôt you do the next runner-up for president he‚Äôs a businessman and it was downhill from there in my thought process of him, and his family
Ur just jealous because ppl support them and ur ratings once again as always is in the shitter. I am voting for Biden and Harris. They will lead our country back to where it should be. He will work for the ppl not the other way around like Frump has done 4 the last 3 1/2 yrs.
Yeah no shit huh that‚Äôs not even a joke I really did do a research paper on the Trump business when I was in business school and I found out all sorts of shit and that was one of them zero military service (that I could see anyway)
No, .la, Trump "inherited" a huge mess!  He changed a crippled economy to booming one. He revived our military which obummer had nearly depleted.  The housing industry soared. Most of those biden and obummer had put on food stamps became proud independent employees.
So I watch the history channel documentary which I put up on this feed a couple of times when Trumps grandpa Went back to Germany, Germany refused to take them back, so they had to come back to the United States because of exactly that - he dodged the German mandatory military
A little etymologious disclosure...  Biden is Saxon of the genitive; Button which was a given name to those of nobility who made garments.  Harris is the English form of "harry" or "Harold" which means to "call forth" or take from or off.  Biden Harris - Take off your clothes.
Joe Biden lying to the American people for 50 years!
Biden needs to debate President Trump! That will show what a shame he is. #MAGA2020LandslideVictory #MAGA
RUN DONNY RUN! Ur going to get ur ass kicked so hard when Biden/Harris wins that ur ass is going to get between ur shoulders and then u will be talking out of ur ass. I know ur scared shitless so start running. And no cheating like u did in 2016.
Biden should know better, to no avail.  Will you trash him?
Progressives throwing a temper tantrum every time Biden does something is annoying as hell.  This election is a binary choice.  You couldn't get coalition or consensus when it came to the Dem ticket.  Move on and make things better.
im so conflicted and none of the posts i see like this seem to mention that BIDEN IS A RAPIST
Will the choice of Harris for VP make a difference?   Biden for President announced that in the 24 hours since announcing Kamala as the running mate, the campaign has raised $26 million from 150,000 grassroots donors.
I agree üíØ%. He has been attacking Biden and now Harris because he is scared because he knows that they r going to beat his ass. The only way he will win is by doing the same thing in 2016. He is a cheater, liar and that is all he knows how to do things. Biden/Harris2020
Guess she doesn't know  The Kennedys. Biden Pelosi are/were all Catholics? Not to mention the Pope? None of them would be fit to be judges? Did she notice that the pastors of her Baptist faith are among the RICHEST people in the WORLD? Priests take the vow of Poverty?
She is and will always be better then u. Biden and Harris are a good team. And I know u hate that he picked Harris for a reasons. 1.She is half African American 2. Half Asian  and  3. She is a woman. All these that u r racist toward. Ur going to lose!
Biden is just as much Fascism as Trump. The difference is one hides it
Democrats are desperate to get Trump to add $3 Trillion to his credit card to give Biden, if elected, a Bank Account &amp; more room to spend.
No, she's not. Unless the GOP is actually threatening to kill Biden just to make that happen, in which case ... isn't that illegal? Even implicitly?
Whoever is writing Joe Biden's tweets must have learned from Saul Alinsky. No lie is too great - with the expectation that if you repeat it enough, people will come to believe it's the truth. Can our country survive this level of misinformation, flat out lies and propaganda?
I am not charging you or others that I have seen with this. Jemar worries me a bit. Yeah. When I see ANYONE publically support or like or give the impression of supporting people like Biden and Harris, it worries me. Same with Trump. I am only leaning more Trump because of Biden.

Reasons not to vote for Joe Biden?
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
Joe Biden is a deteriorating shill of a Value Brand politician, way passed his prime... whatever that was... who can‚Äôt even stop himself from groping children when in front of the cameras   They think the American people are dumb.
Dear stupid, Biden is walking UP a dry ramp. Trump is walking DOWN a damp slippery ramp. He knew the media would have had great joy in watching him fall. Trump made a wise choice to slow walk the ramp. Pres. Ford fell and media never left it alone.
Joe Biden who stated that Communist China is NOT an economic threat to America. Biden who stated blaming Communist China for CCP virus is xenophobic! Biden who pushed to give China Most Favored Nation status. A vote for Biden is a vote for Communist China!
Biden has accomplished a great deal when it comes to helping Communist China take American jobs, pushed through Most Favored Nation State for China and made himself and his cocaine snorting dishonorably discharged son filthy rich.
Can‚Äôt wait for President Biden and vice President Harris to walk into that White House
Look what amazing shape Biden is in!!

Yeah she is, she could‚Äôve destroyed biden, had it teed up and everything, and fumbled because she‚Äôs just a shiny set of keys meant to distract
I meant I‚Äôm not voting Biden or trump. -_- those. Are. The. Two. Evils. Therefore. I‚Äôm. Voting. #JoJorgensen2020 was I slow enough that time for you punkin
Seriously ya'll.  Vote like Biden is down by 20 points.
Why am I voting for Biden? Well, aside from the fact that I am tired of hearing about the president, and for something stupid or scary every damn day, Biden have an typical experienced and functional administration that wont getting fired and arrested constantly.
Bashing Kamala Harris isn‚Äôt gonna help us beat Trump. Biden could pick a carrot for running mate and I will still put on my clown makeup every day and pretend it‚Äôs the best carrot for the job in hopes of convincing other Democrats to vote for him- aka not vote for Trump.
I want the debates.  I want to see Biden crash and burn.
That might be so for you, but you only get 2 choices, Biden or Trump, which one do you choose?
Yes he is. Confident people like Joe Biden are not afraid of criticism or different view points. They listen to good consul and hire the most qualified individuals and demand that they always tell how it is. Week individuals like Trump just want to be praised and adulated.
You want a battle??? GOOD. WE are ready. WE have 35K personnel who are all former military and liars like Biden/Obama are on our list. (just so you know the truth- HRC bought those votes) The votes were cast by illegals &amp; dead people. You want to fight.... Bring it. SEMPER FI
Economically, years, but I know this, the minute Biden gets elected, world leaders and allies will reach out to him. We will once again be respected around the üåé

What a difference listening to Biden and Harris as opposed to Trump and Pence. The first speak of compassion, hope and concrete plans to help us against COVID-19, rebuilt our country and economy. The later speaks of self praise, adulation, hate, division, lies and indecision.
Every time the MAGA crowd accuses Biden of "hiding in his basement," I like to point out that this means he's beating Trump without really trying. What's gonna happen when he really kicks in to gear?  We saw it today, and it was beautiful.
ohhhh so because its not a "name brand" party the opinions of libertarians are invalid. atleast Jo Jorgensen isn't sending non-violent cannabis cases to prison. Biden is the lesser of two evils and still just as evil. were gonna be right where we started with trump. bet on it.
you bet! to vote #JoJorgensen2020 seriously people Biden and Kamala are only going to keep companies and the prisons happy.
Hey Deb do you think she‚Äôll call him a racist like she called Joe Biden in a debate
I wonder if she‚Äôll call him a racist like she call Joe Biden
i think you‚Äôre over thinking this. she could mean, he‚Äôs old and could die. either way she‚Äôs theorizing about Biden‚Äôs demise. but it is an open question.
It's important to know who you're voting for. Unfortunately Trump is the alternative. I know more progressive change can come from a Biden/Harris White House than the current administration. I'm voting for the climate. I'm voting against racism. I'm voting for Biden and Harris
honestly if the Biden/Harris campaign wanted to get the Buster lefties on their side they'd use the right wing attack ads as their slogans lol
the right will think socialism wins even when the most conservative democrat gets in office!   Imagine how many garbage memes we'd get if Biden wins. tbh I kinda prefer that to the Ben Garrison deification of Trump.
The only worse choice for VP Biden could have made would be Nancy Pelosi
so what this video tells me is biden is a hard worker whos more relatable to the masses, and also not a fat out of shape fuck

1. People going back to work is not ‚Äújob creation‚Äù 2. Obama/Biden created more jobs each year of their administration than Trump/Pence 3. Jobless rate is over 10% and the economy contracted by over 1/3.  4. You have destroyed the growing economy you inherited

I agree they are trying to rig the election, but arresting Obama, Biden, Clinton is not worth the trouble it will cost. Barr is not stupid. He‚Äôs putting his energy into Comey, whose arrest would support their theory of the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù w/o enticing riots.
and Biden running on a position of "let's diversify rich white neighborhoods through zoning!" certainly would not be a winning strategy. (nor would it align with his past positions on such issues... like, *at all*.)
Bishop laments Biden-Harris ticket doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äòa Catholic on it,' gets schooled by Twitter
Hey DJ, You must be confused. Your tweet is for BIDEN-HARRIS!!!!
Barr is evil, he‚Äôs not stupid. He‚Äôs after Comey, et al, not Obama, Biden, Clinton. Even he said the false nonsense they‚Äôre accusing Obama and Biden of would not be illegal. Clinton was cleared, yet again, by Barr‚Äôs own DOJ. The political cost is not worth it.
The DOJ is going after Comey, et al. Barr has already said that even the false nonsense they‚Äôre accusing Obama and Biden of was not illegal. Barr‚Äôs own corrupt DOJ cleared Hillary yet again.
Any vote against Biden-Harris in first past the post voting, which the US uses, is a vote for Il Cheeto and Penny.
I just got a letter from Blue Cross.  They made too much money last year and are sending everyone a check.  Thanks Obama/Biden!
The Biden campaign had better get organized in swing states if they don't want this to happen again.
A Biden-Harris dynamic will not only bring better policies for poor &amp; middle class, they'll bring integrity, competence, honor, and grace to the WH. Unlike Trump who only deals in fear, hatred, racism, misogyny, and stupidity. So happy when he leaves office; he never deserved it.

I believe the Biden/Harris campaign should make it clear that when elected, they will look into which Trump appointees have actively used their positions to disrupt government in order to reelect Trump.

Joe Biden is a Thief and a Liar, Corrupt to the Core !

The thing is though, like 90% of what Trump says, that's a bald faced lie.  Biden has released plans for policy, unlike Trump who literally has no plan, and he plans on increasing police budgets. Aren't you supposed to be a journalist? How about you do a modicum of research?
Anyone who chooses not to vote is essentially de facto voting for Trump. Biden/Harris were not my first choice but 4 more years of Trump is unthinkable! Please reconsider your decision not to vote.
Best I can say to people who are really upset their guy didn‚Äôt make it, and hate Biden and Harris is to think of it this way:  This election, you don‚Äôt vote FOR, you are absolutely voting AGAINST.
If you all have been screaming "defund the police" "ACAB" "fuck 12" or anything of the like but you gonna vote Biden/Harris just because it's not Trump......you're fuckin stupid, beyond stupid  There are more than those 2 choices......
He‚Äôs campaigning for Biden huh!
Says the clown who has Biden/Harris 2020 as their Twitter handle.  The irony is epic
...Under President Barack Obama, Biden was wrong to advise against the mission that killed Osama bin Laden. And when President Trump ordered the successful and helpful killing of Iran‚Äôs terrorist-supporting Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Biden opposed that, too.
...Biden was wrong on the Reagan doctrine, wrong on the 1980s defense buildup, wrong on the Strategic Defense Initiative. He was wrong to oppose the first Gulf War, when a U.S.-led coalition deftly kicked Saddam Hussein‚Äôs troops out of Kuwait.
Former CIA Director and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served presidents of both parties, famously said that Biden had been wrong about ‚Äúnearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.‚Äù

Terry Sullivan‚Äôs comments about Joe Biden ‚Äúhiding in his basement‚Äù and comparing the excitement of Kamala Harris as VP pick being equivalent to sitting on a football to beat the clock we‚Äôre unhelpful, and unwelcome to me. His ‚Äúman cave‚Äù decor was a total, unappealing distraction
Not only did Pres Obama predict it, it's part of a cycle and Health Services have always predicted one.  And Joe Biden had written up an Op Ed in Jan 24th, 2020 telling everyone, everyone that the new Corona Virus could be the pandemic that Obama/Biden had prepared for.
Joe Biden should debate Diaper Donnie only if the Diaper releases his tax returns for the last 20 years first.
no i‚Äôm not. Biden is not who i want as president but i cant do anything about the candidates. all i can do is vote. i believe he is the lesser evil and will not attack blacks and mexicans and other minorities like trump has during these last 4 years.
"She Never Called Biden Racist" Watch Fox News Fact Check Trump Statement on Kamala Harris  via
They've gone a bridge too far!  Biden is an observant Roman Catholic.  It's nonsense like this that makes it so difficult to have a meaningful discussion with a MAGAt. Below is the only way to treat these statements.
More reasons to like Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs running mate.

so what are your thoughts then? you clearly seem very against biden and considering there‚Äôs only one other option...
Another Republican voter explains why she is voting for Biden and Harris. #VoteBlue2020
He flip flops. Now he‚Äôs mad that Kamala will be VP. Get ready for a lot of anti Biden content now.
you prefer an open racist? obviously i would rather have someone who is not racist or homophobic or sexist but we don‚Äôt have any in our options. realistically it‚Äôs between trump and biden, so i prefer biden.
If it's proven that Joe Biden is guilty of withholding a billion dollars to remove a prosecutor looking into Burisma...  Can Ukraine extradite him?
Keen observers point out unusual elements of Biden‚Äôs Instagram post with Harris   Normally I would not belittle anyone for such petty things, but in this toxic environment of politics where the Left has put our side under the microscope, all is fair game.
Biden Harris campaign slogan  I'll get paid, you blow them.
I hope everyone who reads this who can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt vote for Biden-Harris will please consider voting for  for President so that you can vote your values and support a progressive platform
Lol if Biden cant win without my vote then biden simply cant win and should have never stole the election from the candidate polling higher than everyone
I hope everyone who reads this who can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt vote for Biden-Harris will please consider voting for  for President so that you can vote your values and support a progressive platform
And as for Joe Biden, Trump shows no signs of ceasing the same old lies about Joe Biden being a far-left destroyer of the American city that made the President lose many, many times before.
Trump is going into a lot more than overdrive on that front. In fact, he's headed straight into a state of personal confusion regarding Biden's VP, as his quickly rushed ad on her demonstrated. He can't decide whether he wants Kamala Harris to be a far-leftist or a phony leftist.
(Coming up) Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
For Biden?  Reach out and touch someone.  For Harris?  Reach out and incarcerate black people and Kavanaugh, all without evidence.  Not sure how you combine the two.  I guess ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black?‚Äù
You know the Trump team will lose to the Biden one when Trump can't even decide what kind of leftist he wants Kamala Harris to be.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will answer to God for their silence and non action regarding the death of the aborted babies. Knowing God I hate to be in their shoes when it happens. Just the thought causes me to shudder. God help their deceived followers they will receive the same.

I‚Äôm just pointing out that your faith in the polls and what you see online betrays you. Many Patriots are not included or do not respond to these polls, and that is why the mainstream media didn‚Äôt see Hillary‚Äôs landslide loss coming, and the same reason they don‚Äôt see Biden‚Äôs.
Lol, it's also misleading because 538 is hedging for what they think it'll be on election day. Right now Biden has a 92% chance to win.
This is accounting for changes post-debates and post-conventions.  The article says if the election were held today, Biden would almost surely win (90+% chance).
Whaat's wrong with this picture?? Biden's choice of Kamaltoe is making it too easy... something's up.
Harris has zero to do with Trump. Democrats want him to fight with her not wimpy limply Biden. Pence will take in Harris just like Tulsi Gabbard.
Harris Skin is as White as Joe Biden.
I don‚Äôt think morally trump or Biden should be in office. We haven‚Äôt heard anything in Jorgensen and she‚Äôs honestly and clearly the better candidate with the goals she wants. No one lets her speak it‚Äôs a 2 party system in the media when clearly there is a 3rd party.
Kamala Harris says Joe Biden isn't racist and you are IRRELEVANT.
I am so happy that Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Trump didn‚Äôt attend John Lewis‚Äô funeral because Lewis hadn‚Äôt attended his inauguration. Trump is a petulant child.  Biden knew that Kamala Harris had called him out on the debate stage &amp; still decided that she was the best choice for VP. Biden is an an intelligent adult.
Report: Harris Wasn't Biden's First Choice   HIS FIRST CHOICE WAS BRUCE JENNER LOOKALIKE, GRETCHEN WHITMER, BUT SHE'S NOT BLACK ENOUGH
I agree, we can stop him from getting away with it!!! We have VPJoe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è we ALL are.......** WE THE PEOPLE**
Biden decides Kamala Harris is 'black enough' to be his running mate   --   AND... SHE'S NOT EVEN BLACK!!
Here‚Äôs the obvious problem - does she still believe Biden‚Äôs female accusers?  How do they resolve this without looking bad either way? ‚òπÔ∏è
Y‚Äôall some fucking losers if upon hearing Kamala is the VP candidate the first thing you do is try to make her look bad or whine when this is an extremely important election and we all know she and Biden are many many many times better of an improvement than the scum in office
At least it's now crystal clear that Kanye's intentions are for one reason only, to take votes away from Joe Biden in an attempt to steal another election for Donald Trump.  What a shameful legacy. And a massive failure.
I don‚Äôt see how any progressive sees a Biden/Harris ticket and gets excited about it. It‚Äôs as establishment as it gets right there.
What about the millions of little girls that will never grow to be women because Biden and Harris and those like them choose to keep murder in the womb legal?  They don‚Äôt get a voice huh.
My bias?  I'm pointing out that the same "problems" Joe Biden has are celebrated proudly when coming from Trump.  Trump has divided us and brought out the worst.  He has got to go.  There is my bias.
The commercials depict that if Biden wins , if you call 911 no one will come to your rescue, while someone is breaking into your house..
Just put a nail in the Biden presidential campaign casket
DEVELOPING: Joe Biden is making his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris.
Y‚Äôall joe Biden is old as fuck!!!!
In fairness Trump attacked everyone in  the 2016 Republican primaries too, and now most of them either work for or closely with him.  It happens. I‚Äôm not defending Harris or Biden and refuse to vote for them, but primaries aren‚Äôt about inspiration.  They are about mudslinging.
Time to show Trump and his enablers, what America is really about. The racism and hatred that Trump and his campaign are trying to spread about Biden and Harris is not what America is about.
BIDEN is a senior of whom the DEMOCRATS are taking advantage of.  THIS IS ELDER ABUSE!
A continuance of the Obama Biden spirit. First Joy I have felt since the occupation of 2017.
Everyone‚Äôs already thinking Biden will only do a 1 term then hand it over to her for 2024 ü§î I agree Harris will be great even if she wasn‚Äôt my pickWhy are you on TV so much? It‚Äôs TOO much and you lie. You talk TOO much as well. What‚Äôs worse? You say same thing over and over, same boring script, monotone as you read the prepared remarks. Yawn. Can‚Äôt wait until we have a real President, Joe Biden and Kamala VP
Because Trump giving a speech bashing Biden is what we all want to hear. Says nobody anywhere.
#FranklinGraham is a disgrace to his father's name and legacy.  Franklin cares only about power and wealth, and those who have it.
I understand Trump haters will vote for anyone except Trump ..... they would vote for a box of cereal over Trump.  But, they don‚Äôt seem to realize that Biden will hurt their wallets .... destroy the jobs Trump brought back from overseas .... things he did for the working class
Biden has raised $48 million in 48 hours! Wow! Just wow!and  and  are raising a üòà seed
Biden is not President! ...  YOU are responsible for not taking care of business and helping this country! Stop blaming everyone else! DO YOUR JOB!!!
Mika Brzezinski on Trump‚Äôs response to COVID-19: ‚ÄúMany of those deaths, Mr. President, are on you and your terrible response to this virus ‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt even show leadership on masks.‚Äù
The endorsement comes after the president's resistance to Postal Service funding,amid his fight against expanded mail in voting.  is against mail in voting except for his own state of Florida and another ( red state, he thinks)
So when Biden goes to the pasture does Nancy Pelosi take over as President or Vice President?
(W) NEW: Former Vice President Joe Biden leads President Trump by 11 percentage points, according to the latest PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist Poll I hope this is true and holds up. Trump is doing everything he can to cheat his way into another term.
No, Joe Biden isn't "hiding" in his basement. ‚¨áÔ∏è  How many times has drump gone hiding in the bunker? I will bet a lot.  is a weasel. A coward . Vote ‚ÄúBLUE‚Äù.Vote Biden/Harris üíôüíôüíô
Joe loved Beau and was a real father. ‚ù§Unlike  He was Never a dad to  and  That is why they are so jealous of biden and Obama.
Kamala is a strong leader, a daughter of immigrants, and has a passion for justice. Like us, she is a happy warrior in the battle for the soul of America. We will spend every minute of the next 85 days making sure that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris replace Trump  Pence
Agree,  Can and should however point out her Leftist Senate Voting r√©cord and the Biden/Harris  Leftist Agenda!
Of course!!!!! Go Biden/Harris!!!!
You call this ‚Äúleadership‚Äù??!! In my world this government overreach or #communism. No thank you. Not in my country üá∫üá∏
Who is 'they'? Are you talking about democrats? Biden, Harris?  You are fearmongering, which can be argued is not Christian - especially when there are no facts to support it.
Biden isn't the one playing politics. You are. Case and point. You went to
And yet, Biden has a dog. And Trump doesn't.
It makes sense Kamala was chosen by Biden. Her family owned slaves and Biden is quoted as saying "I'll be damned if I will pay reparations for the sins of my father and grandfather ". Google it. And then watch the deflecting.
They've also killed more ppl than Obama/Biden. 160,000+ and growing. That's just the pandemic, doesn't include mass shootings and bountied soldiers. Also more lies than anyone in any admin. More corruption than admin.
If ever there was a reason to INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE this is it - Judge Jeanine Makes Ominous Biden Prediction   Why did she say that? Does she know something? Is she psychic or psycho?

He and   would be fast friends seeing as how they both have that ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see anything...‚Äù alibi going on. #ChildMolestor
I agree!! Why did they have that #sourpuss  on after Biden/Harris speech. I changed it quick to #CNN He brought my excitement to the ground when he spoked .. ugh!!  needs to get his butt out!!

I am convinced that everything is concerning the  team because America has enough of the #ConMan and his cronies trying to sabotage the American Dream to benefit their rich friends. üá∫üá∏Biden/Harris
Joe Biden picked such an excellent VP in Kamala Harris.  She is a super strong speaker and never backs down from any fight on the horizon.  Kamala Harris also has her facts at hand and whips out her responses so fast that she makes your head spin.

Dr. Irwin Redlener joins to explain why the choice of Kamala Harris as Biden's running mate makes a lot of sense in the middle of a pandemic.
He just heard Biden's pick
Senator Harris and VP Biden, make me hopeful for our democracy, our civil rights, equal justice for all and the  rule of law. Her soul and Biden‚Äôs are in stark contrast to Trump‚Äôs lack of everything, empty suit~stupid tie~
Kamala Harris now kneels down to the racist Biden. After years of fighting RACISM, she now accepts it
Biden saved big bucks using payroll tax loophole
Sleepy Joe Biden.
or that he knows better than the CDC, Fauci, or any scientists at all, for that matter. No, Biden will be a team player rather than a crazy, and I mean crazy, autocrat.
He also has Obama, a much respected and admired past president as his mentor, advisor, and supporter. He is surrounding himself with good people because, evidently, he doesn't think he is the chosen one, he alone can fix it, that he is a stable genius,
KAMALA HARRIS. THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IF BIDEN WINS. SHE WILL BE THE ONE WITH THE CODES. BIDEN DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ZIP CODE HE LIVES IN. KAMALA HARRIS PRESIDENT. LET THAT SINK IN
For democrats, This purity test needs to be stopped . No candidate will satisfy everyone. Biden,&amp; Harris are millions times better thanTrump and his swamp.If you can‚Äôt see that ( many of them show themselves in the comments here. You are helping to re-elect Trump for another 4yrs
was for her before he was against her.Trump has become irrelevant.  He is nasty, mean, insulting and low class. He is going down on November 3, and he knows it.  BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!!!üíô
Wonderful choice! She is one tough prosecutor and will make a wonderful VP. Great choice, Biden. We support you!    VOTE! And will mop with Trump and Pence the Hill's  watch out Miss Lindsey don't get in the way  üá∫üá∏Biden/Harris2020
I was not happy with the way she torpedoed VP Biden during the debates but she's tough and if she is his choice I will support this ticket 500% to get this country away from this constant hatespeak and delusions perpetrated by the current administration.
Kamala Harris is born on Oct. 20th, and Joe Biden was born on Nov. 20th. That is definitely 2020. If I am Pence, I‚Äôll be afraid, very afraid !!!  Let‚Äôs debate !!!She has a mouthpiece.
Bring it on   No body give a damn. I will still vote for Biden. Who would believe a attorney whose former clients were Russian Oligarchs...No one fucking believes #barr anymodu. #LyingDogs
He just wants to get back into vote for Biden then he wont have to Sneak anymore! And he can have a lot of his buddies come here to help him with his hobby. THATS WHAT DEFUNDING THE POLICE AND VOTING DEMONCRAT WILL GET FOR YOU.
More breaking news today.   Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.  #Election2020
Lmao run away you coward...not surprised you are unable to back up your claims, about as much I can expect from a Biden fan
Sure they have. And trump is going to have our government buy millions of doses and foist them on us just before the election and claim credit to get reelected. My October surprise will be I'll already have voted for Biden.
Either way it's going to be an issue, but most importantly Biden has to take into consideration the "Electorial" snowflakes who will have a problem with a woman!
Idiots ..Biden is not the president ..Your moron is and he has not done nothing for this #TrumpVirus he has  leadership on this Pandemic. BIDEN IS DOING MUCH MORE OrangeMan is playing golf most of the time.

TRUMPSHIT! UNCONSTITUTIONAL  AND MORE SMOKE AND MIRRORS!
COME LETS GIVE EQUAL TIME TO BIDEN? ESPECIALLY SINCE HE SPENDS SO MUCH TIME TALKING?
On day one Biden should sign an executive order that cancels each and every one of Trump's EOs and list them so that it's clear they are canceled. "The following EOs are hereby declared null and void...."
China is Communist we have fought them in Cuba, N .Korea, Vietnam THEY ARE OUR ENEMY! They KNOWINGLY released a Virus on the world, Costing TRILLIONS in DESTROYED Economies and Killed over 1 million people WITHOUT FIRING a SHOT. You want Biden to STAND UP TO THEM?

I wonder if  depression deepens today when Trump bails out the country? Is she still trying to process Biden calling integration a "racial jungle" and advocating on behalf of his constituents to keep Delaware schools segregated? Come on Man, that would depress me!
Thinking Harris just because she's limiting her public appearances now until her surgery heals (last TV appearance was a disaster and way too early) but has tweeted multiple pro Biden messages like something from a VP campaign.
How did Biden's turn out the other day. Come on man, do blacks really have no diversity? I'm pretty sure that won't go over well in my family.
I think Kamala Harris will not go over well with older Biden supporters. Too independent to be a teammate to Biden. I think Rice would be a better choice due to her ties to European leaders, her knowledge of Foreign Policy and the fact she worked closely with  Biden for years.
Biden isn't going to take guns away. He can't. Stop listening to Trump's b.s., turn off Fox news, and read the Constitution.  The GOP is taking things away: mail-in ballots, Social Security, Medicaid/Medicare, Health care, raising taxes on middle/low income earners...

How do Biden's boots taste?

Amazing to me that the DNC is still pandering to moderate Conservatives, who will never vote Democrat, as though Biden somehow has more clout and insider connections than Hillary fucking Clinton.
Biden/Harris supporters are stupid
If we had a real media in this country they would be as outraged over the fact that Joe Biden has consistently refused to answer questions as they are about people mispronouncing Kamala Harris‚Äô name.
That is indeed laughable! Again, just like the "cages" were installed in the Obama-Biden administration, so too the removal of postal boxes also began in the Obama-Biden administration.
And still no Biden signs...
Biden wants to know who Snowden is... Lol......
Drew is right! Beijing Biden ran for President in 1988 and again 2008. That‚Äôs where he got his nickname 1% Joe. He never got more than 1% of the votes either time. 2% Harris is with him now.
It‚Äôs funny how dems don‚Äôt see the polls running parallel to what the were in 2016. Polls that they were running claiming that Hillary was winning everywhere, when in fact she was losing badly everywhere. Biden is running the same as Hillary was back then. üëçüèª TRUMP WINS BIGLY!
Beijing Biden has made it clear he will mandate illegal aliens are covered in his healthcare mandate. Couple that with open borders and joy wood is right!
You mean Biden? Cuz Biden is a predator...
People, Biden has nothing to say.  Harris and her public record along with failed presidential run speaks for itself.  Dangerous duo that will appeal to uninformed lemmings and illegal migrants.
You‚Äôre missing the point like you demolition rats did in 2016. Send us video of 20 people let alone 2000 people gathering anywhere in this country today to support 1% Beijing Biden and 2% Harris. We will wait................./
This is insane!  Biden has a lot of questions to answer!  Hunter, Tara Reid and others.
Biden Did Nothing.
My go-to is to minimize possible harm in the short term, so my instinct is to vote for Biden. But I‚Äôve heard convincing, coherent arguments for either path.
I hear what ur saying and I definitely understand your anger. And if you don‚Äôt want to vote Biden then by all means don‚Äôt. But I know people who got healthcare thanks to the Medicaid expansion and that was the aca so if even one person gets healthcare cuz of Biden it‚Äôs worth it.
Weighing all the minutiae that generate from taking either risk presents a plethora of questions like that. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still undecided, and don‚Äôt see transparent moral or logical failings in either leftists voting for Biden or leftists abstaining.
We know Biden can‚Äôt complete a sentence and Kamala just doesn‚Äôt make sense with her crazy rhetoric that only benefits rich politicians living in mansions somewhere

CBS says Wall Street breathes "sigh of relief" at Harris pick. Well, Job Exporting Wall Street is the enemy of working people so expect Harris to be, too - no matter what phony claims are laid on to get elected. Harris and Biden are Corporate Shills from way back.

Arizona‚Äôs superintendent of public instruction Kathy Hoffman formally endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, arguing their administration would better serve Arizona public schools.
Joe Biden has had 40 years and done nothing. Obama had 8 years and did nothing. Why would you even consider voting for these people?
I just see Trump roast Biden over every single thing. But never mentions the fact that Biden let's kids rub his leg hair and sniffs them like a freaky sex predator. Kinda seems to me, Trump doesn't wanna go there.
So Biden is racist? Lol. Nice argument
Ask Biden, her own running mate
This makes zero sense. You‚Äôre describing something occurring in Trump‚Äôs USA, not Biden‚Äôs.   If anything Biden‚Äôs election would cause riots in Republican strongholds but I‚Äôm guessing this might be a little too complex for you.
Oh boy....popping up to support the wrong side...I'll pour you a glass of wine and we can discuss what's wrong with the Biden/Harris ticket.
We can't stop good trouble.  It's needed more then ever now. The line has been delineated between good and evil.  Biden and trump.
Biden does that already
LOL! Do you mean votes that biden/harris never had? Ridiculous.
One easy way to see that enthusiasm doesn't equate to votes is to look at Democratic primaries. Bernie Sanders definitely had more enthusiasm. He had much larger crowds than Biden. But Biden still won. Enthusiasm doesn't mean you are going to win.
Clinton won by ~+14, so this looks consistent with the Biden +7-8 national that we keep seeing
Does anyone doubt the plan is to crash it the day after Biden wins?
Facts matter, truth Is truth no subjectivity here. Biden made himself clear so did Harris.
Trump is running for president, too, sweetheart. Biden has never been accused of anything besides being an affectionate uncle.   You're in a cult. Cults are for the weak minded.   You are no longer worth my time.
But I don't think it matters. I think Biden will get the votes from people that are un enthusiastic about him. Trump has Trumpist cult members who are going to be the most enthusiastic supporters. I concede That's 30% of America. But that won't win the election
Biden is beginning Alzheimers candidate instead of president material.  You want Kamala Harris correcting his fuck ups ?
Not if the person supports Trump. Or isn‚Äôt voting for Biden. Apart from that, I‚Äôm very open minded!
Everyone know Biden &amp; Harris are incompetents. This shows your true colors.

Taylor swift sings songs about all the wrong choices she has made in choosing men in her life..be ready for a hit (don‚Äôt know how you can listen to a thirty year old who sounds like a 8 year old with no talent),about sleepy joe Biden! Another bad choice Taylor! No taste in men!!
She is the reason Kamala is the VP choice. If Biden wins he will step as side or be removed and Clinton will be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù as the vp for harris. You and every other democrat will be the reason too. Maybe that blows wind up your ass idk but Trump won bc Hillary sucks realize that
They are going on all over. Maybe there is no parade yet for Biden/Harris because BLMO and AntiFa haven't stolen enough boats?
Taylor sings about what wrong choices she has made in men. Biden will be next on her shit list!!!
And by the way, NOT accused doesn't mean Biden did it, but boy do you people love to spread that shit around about him, don't you? Hypocrite much?
Only one candidate is accused of raping a child. Spoiler alert: it's not Biden. Don't pretend you care about sexual assault, or men who walk in on naked teenagers brag about it to Howard Stern (easy to find interview), because you clearly don't. Which troll farm do you work at?
After doing that, suppose you are forced to choose who would have sole responsibility to take care of a newborn baby for 24 hours, Biden or Trump (neither one is allowed any assistance, including from their running mates).
A little thought experiment.  Watch this (short) clip of Biden  and then watch any clip of Trump speaking recently (even where he is facing combative and hostile reporters, which is of course nearly all the time).
If U wanted to move the country more to the left why the FUCK did you nominate Biden???? Why the FUCK are you letting HRC, Bloomberg and fucking Kasich speak at the conv? It's laughable you think we are "in your way" it's the fucking  preventing the country from moving left!
What America needs now is a reporter with Jim Acosta's energy to ask Joe Biden some questions after he speaks.
Krazy Kamala is a liberal who shouldn't be anywhere near the White House.  Put her next to Biden in the White House and then you're going the wrong way that Trump works for in building up this country üôÑ.

Are you honestly telling me that you think insulting people is a good campaign strategy?? Are you honestly passing yourself off as the Bernie supporter gatekeeper?? Let me guess; if (when?) Biden loses you'll blame Bernie supporters [again].
Biden and Harris will get it done. Till then more are going to die.
- have you looked into this? Biden seriously looks like he is exhibiting tardive dyskinesia. A friend with 40 years nursing experience taking care of elderly totally agrees.
Kamala calls Joe Biden a racist and then switches up and is now his running mate but y‚Äôall don‚Äôt think these people are gonna switch up once their in office ü§°
The virus was paid for by Democrats with a promise to remove TRUMP from office at all costs and get back to bowing to RED CHINA. Biden will do that. TRUMP will make their existence miserable. BUT we need the HOUSE &amp; SENATE RED to make having TRUMP even stronger for AMERICA

oh great a Greta taking questions and answering them honestly are 2 miles apart in his realm. I just listened to this recent one and there was almost not a fact in there! Seriously Greta do you do your homework?? Biden will!

If you vote for Biden your taxes will go up the Democrats have already promised that.  How do you think they are going to pay for all the free stuff they are going to give away?  The stock market will crash to Obama levels or lower.

Haha. You're just spewing right wing talking points. A front for progressive agenda? That's just a way to paint Biden as a radical when it's really hard. You have to find a way to do this. So you say he's a Trojan horse. It's a tactic because a moderate would snatch Republicans
Based on decades of calculated &amp; self-aggrandizing opportunism between Biden &amp; Harris, it is easy to deduce that both have replaced a typical moral worldview with a religious adherence to an amoral, hedonistic, and ever subjective leftist doctrine. Disconcerting to say the least.

YES that's true but in all probability Trump will cause more. It's been estimated that Trump's policies will cause 587,982,026.254 problems and that Joe Biden's policies will cause 327,982,781.982 problems. so You can see there is a considerable difference. YOU HAVE TO VOTE 4 JOE

trump is the best option right now tbh. he‚Äôs on a roll with the new peace treaty w israel and that‚Äôs a huge deal. biden is too corrupt to take control and would plummet this country to the ground. that‚Äôs my opinion though...

Speaking of Hunter....WHAT ever happened to the whole Ukrainian Biden story? It just disappeared.
Joe Biden¬†said in an interview Wednesday that some funding should ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be redirected from police, amid calls from some in his party to "defund the police" in the¬†wake of the protests¬†across the country.
This  defunding bullshit is surreal, as it is.  But then, coming this fall: The DOJ (i.e. Bill Barr) releases some bullshit about Biden in attempt to delegitimize Biden as a candidate.  It will be framed so any denial by Biden or Dems will only appear suspect.  That's a coup
That should disqualify Biden completely for consideration but instead he is the Democratic candidate.  Insane.
‚Äú‚Å¶ is the diet cola, the light beer of presidential candidates.‚Äù  ‚Å¶  #TWGRPS
Trump has not violated the constitution- he is systematically returning control back to the people, rather than the corrupt career politicians.   Example - how can You not objectively have an issue with what Biden and his son did/are doing to Ukraine?
Biden said he would sign it if it comes with a solid funding plan.   He is just not campaigning on it.   To win a general, can't be too specific. There are groups that like their current coverage. Kaiser, Culinary Workers, Tricare...

Biden‚Äôs only chance of winning
The most fundamental difference between Trump &amp; Biden?  When Trump‚Äôs interests conflict with the nation‚Äôs interests, he serves himself above all else. He will gladly see every institution, every intelligence agency burn to the ground if he could win.
"If she weren't my daughter, I would date her."  Biden didn't say that about his daughter.  That was Trump.  Biden's never paid hush money to a call girl.  That was Trump.  Biden doesn't have over 20 women accusing him of sexual assault.  That's Trump.
Let me walk through what happens if/when Biden wins; more lethal austerity for working people, more fracking, more police violence against protesters, probably another coup in Venezuela/Bolivia, definitely TPP, liberals go back to brunch and not thinking about politics.
üóë 1 headline and 2 lies.  1) Trump didn‚Äôt make up a birther lie about Kamala, he has only responded to a baiting ‚Äúreporter‚Äù who brought up a written false story about Kamala.   2) There are zero racist themes in Trumps campaign. However, you can find racist themes with Biden.

So I was thinking that Biden/Harris needs to shift there messaging to more about a ‚Äúbetter day‚Äù is on the horizon!   According to this article that type of positive messaging will be more effective with the 40% of eligible voters who are non-partisans ‚Å¶

The left is going to revolt when they find out the current condition of Joe Biden. The nomination was given to him by the DNC. There's a reason he's in the basement &amp; cannot take reporter's softball questions. He's unable to do that but the left thinks he's ready for Trump?

Haven‚Äôt liked Biden since the Anita Hill debacle. His trashing of Hillary made it worse. Will always b mad that this past admin did nothing 2 support Hillary during her run &amp; did nothing 2 halt the fraudulent election outcome. If Putin steals another election, will Joe blame Hil?

Why did Symone Sanders and Biden advise people in my home state it was safe to vote in person during a pandemic. #hypicrites
you are in style Linda!!! The Tee looks great !!! Keeps Sporting it !! Biden/Harris 2020!!
since the USPS mail carriers UNION is endorosing Biden, is that considered a conflict of interest? Especially since the mail in ballots / envelopes are easy to identify as Dem or Repub ballot. Be smart and vote in person. Help prevent voter fraud / vote harvesting.
Have you endorsed Biden yet?
The orange criminal strikes again.  Conspiracy theories, lies, and slander. Oh yeah...and a war on the US Postal Service.   Fact check: Trump promotes another¬†birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
Everyone: ‚ÄúJoe Biden needs to get out of his basement, it‚Äôs less than 3 months from Election Day‚Äù  Joe Biden: names Kamala Harris his VP, has two media gatherings, heads back to his basement, no questions asked
Not to worry. The Postal Workers union, responsible for getting ballots in, endorsed Biden.
Biden family better get that Ukraine story straight, because its gonna knockout slow Joe the second he debates.
I would take any version of Biden over Trump...childish names and all.
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews
We saw your hatred for Trump, not one word about the socialist plans Biden has for our country, you don't care about the country only your hatred for Trump..we saw you.
Saw you on PBS, didn't hear 1 thing that you agree with Biden on, no discussion of his plans for the country, just how much you hate Trump, you don't care about the country just your hatred of the President.
For the record: I'm going to follow everyone in this little sub-tweet!

Just like Joe Biden she is not mentally fit to be VP.  she has ideas that are clearly anti constitutional.  Vote Trump
You believe the racist sexual predator who wrote the Biden crime bill and the lady who used the Biden crime bill to imprison thousands of people for victimless crimes who were disproportionately from minority communities is voting in their best interest.
Oh i agree i just think its funny Biden/AOC could litearlly show the world how corrupt they are :(.
Maybe not Biden but most of the Dem candidates literally kike beto, buttigeg ect, all the shitty centrists say medicare as a public option and your like nah propaganda
Yep and the #DummiesforDictators  Are going to try to vote in Biden and Harris.
Gee if only the  would have nominated the guy filling stadiums instead of manipulating the system against him. Biden/Harris is about as energizing as dryer lint.
Not the same thing as stuffing the ballot box‚Äôs which the Biden/Harris team is advocating for

But if they would have endorsed Biden you would have been alright with it #idiot
Here's the deal. I've been pressing my secret sources in DC for the inside scoop on whats happening with the Biden/Harris Campaign. Here's the Top secret, inside the beltway, not for release! Biden Cabinet picks. Do NOT let this out!
You shouldn‚Äôt have to ask.  Vote Biden
Biden's assured his 'sponsors': "nothing will change".   If Biden cared as much about the uninsured as he does his Insurance company donors he'd support M4A like 89% of Democrats. ObamaBiden started a genocide in Yemen. FUCKING GENOCIDE! I'm insane but YOU'RE supporting GENOCIDE!

Next you're going to use phrenology to tell us Biden and Harris are horrible. *rolls eyes*
Let's have #Biden take the Norwegian IQ test, just for fun.
And so it begins! USPS just announced their Priority mail will be delayed 2-3 days and Flat Rate from 5-7 days to 7-9 days and now 9-12 days! Of course they also support Joe Biden. What could go wrong with this termite infested ship of insanity?
Vote for Biden.  He‚Äôs better than the alternative!
Consider voting Biden- the world needs more red pill moments like this.
It has always been. Do Trump or Biden care about California or Texas (for presidential election)?
let me get this straight, he convinced his supporters that covid was a hoax, so that they would all vote in person, while simultaneously dismantling the postal system for biden voters? ü§î
Biden won‚Äôt make it through the election...  Thankfully President Trump will be re-elected, crisis averted. üò∞
Well, the postal workers union could be the one organizing the lost ballots. I‚Äôve got an idea on how to ensure accurate votes - in person with an ID. Elections shouldn‚Äôt be about which side is the best cheat.

I think we need to follow the lead of our candidates. But if every single Democrat hasn‚Äôt contacted at least 100 people to encourage their support for #BIDEN/HARIS2020, then no, we‚Äôre not doing enough!
Biden is a decent man who will not steal from the American people. He won‚Äôt lie about Covid. He won‚Äôt hire incompetent grifters! How can anyone compare Biden with Trump? Biden won‚Äôt destroy democracy.
If we bully Biden that number will go down to 4998!

Don't let these right wing grifters fool you! They are salivating at a Biden Presidency, it will be like 2012 all over again for these fucks!
I think Biden wins the election but Trump remains president.  There will be a constitutional crisis of some sort because a Nixon-like resignation and pardon isn‚Äôt likely if the investigations are legit. Idk, man. I just want the truth one way or another.
I think Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP choice pushed independents and Libertarians away from the Biden Camp
You think Joe Biden is against white Supremacist...
is there a single video of biden clearly stating his desire to do any of these things?
You're the one comparing Biden to Hitler instead of Trump to Hitler. As a doctor you should encourage people to wear a mask.
How about 'Vice President Biden'
Just heard or saw another anti Biden Democrat commercial in AZ with Sam Elliot‚Äôs voice.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs him, maybe do something about that!!
This was pretty eye opening....  (If Biden actually is the nominee.... I have a feeling the DNC might change nominees before the convention due to health concerns - IMO)
Question to  and  : Are you both planning to admit the injustices your policies had on families and pardon some of those cases? #Biden2020  Can we talk about the dark side of the moon üåö? . #BuildTrust #BeHonest #unFairJustice
You don‚Äôt have to like him, but Trump has done a damn good job. Whether you like them or not, Biden and Harris both have terrible track records in office. And, they want to take the US in the opposite direction that had us flourishing as a country. No thanks.
It sad to think we live in such a world that people would do this without remorse while the rest of world allows it.   It is also quite annoying that Americans can be more wrapped up in Biden vs Trump than care about about how we are giving billions to that evil government.
Despite the drama-evoking click-baity title of this article, it is a wonderful read, delving into the political intelligence differences between Biden and Obama. I see a generational thing going on, but the strengths Biden brings to politics shouldn‚Äôt  be overlooked.
Regardless of what Biden says, President Trump is doing the better than any other country with COVID19.
Hmmmm, so you recently saw the light after 40 years in public service? Oh, would the person handling this account for Mr. Biden please ask the question, as he does not know how to tweet, just saying.
Silly Hilly, If we wanted to fix it, we wouldn't be accepting Biden.
That was Biden.
The Biden/Obama administration also caged children, murdered civilians, and fucked over the working class just as hard.
Well everyone you should asked Biden and Harris since they raised 50 million dollars in two days  maybe they should give everyone 1200 dollars or as much as they can until the Democrats come back from there break.
Oh I fully understand. And I have absolutely ZERO hope that a Biden/Harris administration will be even an iota better for the working class.
My mom, who‚Äôs had a heart attack and lobectomy by 50 has covid. She doesn‚Äôt even want me to come home bc she‚Äôs afraid I will catch the virus and it will kill me. That‚Äôs how sick she is. She‚Äôs a nurse, she wears a mask. I can‚Äôt imagine not seeing her again. #covid  #trump #biden

Voting for Joe "nothing will fundamentally change" Biden isn't gonna help a damned thing.
What racial issues? Literally it‚Äôs been the same for decades. When has there ever NOT been a racial divide in this country. Biden has come out to support better support for the battle against climate change and has announced some policy about it. Also we waited too long to close
If Biden was a stronger candidate he‚Äôd already be pushing trump to issue masks to citizens, but instead he puts out an ad about how he will do that immediately come next late January. Sweeeeet.
This makes perfect sense. IMO he is being BLACKMAILED by Harris.

Who forced anyone to take drugs?  By the way it was the 94 crime bill created by Biden that did that. Please get your facts and time frame straight. Clinton was President and signed it.
Trump won both states in 2016. My state of Arizona is no longer a guaranteed red state. I expect Arizona to vote for a Democratic President and Senator. McSally has been a disaster for Republican's

You are a troll on education and AZ.  Political puppet. You‚Äôre just holding out so Biden and you can ‚Äúbe the education saviors‚Äù but what you‚Äôre forgetting is that you everyone sees you‚Äôre terrible people. The ends do NOT justify the means! All the angry parents are focused on you
Trump doesn't want mail in ballot because it can be rigged.  By the by . Who wants a feeble like Biden in office who can't make a quick wise decision in office anyway. Trump didn't become successful having Alzheimers.

So he's saying Biden-Harris will lose? Sounds good to me.
I find Joe Biden voters more repulsive than Trumpers. By a land slide! The difference is one can say and get away w/ more than the other! I view a vote for Biden as a vote for mainstream socialism and government expansion.
we can vote trump out while holding biden/kamala accountable for their atrocious careers
LOL. Isn't it sad that the only thing the GOP has is this made up false narrative? Creating a boogeyman then accusing the eternal Moderate Biden of being that boogeyman. Mud and lies is the only thing that the GOP has to fight with. No accomplishments, no aspirations.

My FB friends seem to understand that electing Biden doesn't fix anything (other than the issue of Trump of course) and know we will have to keep up the pressure, even increase it, IF he is elected...but seeing far too many who think he is the solution.
Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical *to defeating Trump*. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.

Seriously, stop trying to sell us on how great Biden and Harris are...stop making childish threats...stop berating anyone who isn't praising the Dem ticket and instead realize there are major concerns and it will likely take protests, strikes, etc to get the progress we NEED.
That‚Äôs right: ‚Äúa vote for Biden, we must keep on hidin; vote for Trump, we‚Äôll get over the hump!‚Äù

It was the topic of convo at Karen's Brunch Bunch today. It was unanimous: voting for Biden is a 'no brainer'.  The topic quickly turned to a heated discussion about which day will be more glorious: When Queen 'K' destroys Pence in  a debate or when the election is finally over.
Not for nothing, but if Mitt really wanted to rock the boat he‚Äôd switch party affiliations. His values line up more with Biden anyway.
Biden is counting on Republicans who don‚Äôt like trump. I‚Äôm pretty sure that he would rather alienate us than them.
Donald Trump actually believes the American people will actually allow and accept him stealing the election from Joe Biden and the American people. It won‚Äôt happen. It will be total civil disobedience and unrest everyday of his presidency. The bird brain has to be voted out of
And now....more lies and conspiracy theories out of the trump camp about our VP. He is an endless liar. We have to have Kamala's back.  Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
No we don't think Joe Biden is bad &amp; Kamala Harris is a strong, bad ass woman. They are a terrific team who will clean up Trump's mess. The GOP is going down &amp; it's a beautiful thing to watch #DumpTrump2020  #WorstPresidentEverArizona Republican: I'm voting Biden because 'I'm so disgusted'
You are correct Mr President there is something going on, they are hiding the failing health of mr Biden... we the people see this and have your back. You Sir have our Vote and always have. Thank you
If you were Biden, who would be in your cabinet? Who would you pick for Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General?
When Jimmy said it he was right. Progressives would have a better chance to make noise with Trump than with Hillary. The problem is no matter who is pres they will shut down real progress. Biden will lead to Trump 2.0 or someone just like him. We're fucked!
2 options  (A) live a peaceful life under Biden  (B) continue living in chaos under trump ?????????!!!!!???????!!!!????!!
This shit is relentless. And exhausting. And it's like corruption whack-a-mole. This guy installed nothing but toadies to dismantle every part of USG to destroy us from within. That all said, NOTHING will keep me from voting for Biden/Harris in November.
I mean it seems convenient to hold only Joe Biden responsible for that crime bill when he was not the only one in government at the time. Did Bernie Sanders sign it, did Nancy Pelosi? What about Warren? Let's check on everyone who was in office in 94 and call them all out.
If you think Biden is even remotely like Trump you should really do some research. Your mindset is why Trump is in office now. It's unfortunate and unrealistic for you to think things can't get worse cause believe me they can.
Oh i am thrilled as well... TRUMP 2020 üòÅüòÅüá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤ BUMBLEING biden has made this happen for sure now thank you dim dems.
THANK. YOU!!!! I swear Democrats historically shoot themselves in the feet. There are no perfect candidates. That is a sadly unrealistic idea but you know what....I can sleep within Biden/Harris in the white house. I won't wake up wondering what new abomination has happened.
I have my electric panties on since Biden announced Kamala as his VP pick.ü§£üòÇü§£ I‚Äôm Zipping through to November 3rdü§£üòÇü§£zzzppppp!!!!
At this point in 2020, we can assume just one thing. Joe Biden thinks Kamala Harris smells better than any other female, black democrat.
He used shot to describe Biden a while back, didn‚Äôt he...üò¨
He‚Äôs upset that we aren‚Äôt making progress. 70% of the country want Universal Healthcare but Dems vote 125-36 to keep it off platform. Corrupt as fuck. Biden said nothing would fundamentally change if he‚Äôs elected. So wages stay low and working people people still struggle üôÑ
I look forward to being able to sleep through the night again (and maybe drink less alcohol) after Biden/Harris are sworn in in 01/2021. There are a ton of things to fix, nothing is perfect, but it'll be a damn good start.
I heard pence locked himself in the restroom after he heard Biden picked Kamala. He‚Äôs crying ü§£üòÇü§£
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
Why in the fuck every time I refresh my screen on Twitter, a fucking Joe Biden tweet is always there ?
I can‚Äôt wait for November to come and go and Joe Biden is President. The press are just as complicit as trump. I‚Äôm sick of the press already. They are morons.
A man of faith Joe Biden.
build back better. BIDEN 2020Biden wants to know who Snowden is... Lol......
Drew is right! Beijing Biden ran for President in 1988 and again 2008. That‚Äôs where he got his nickname 1% Joe. He never got more than 1% of the votes either time. 2% Harris is with him now.
Beijing Biden has made it clear he will mandate illegal aliens are covered in his healthcare mandate. Couple that with open borders and joy wood is right!
You mean Biden? Cuz Biden is a predator...
People, Biden has nothing to say.  Harris and her public record along with failed presidential run speaks for itself.  Dangerous duo that will appeal to uninformed lemmings and illegal migrants.
You‚Äôre missing the point like you demolition rats did in 2016. Send us video of 20 people let alone 2000 people gathering anywhere in this country today to support 1% Beijing Biden and 2% Harris. We will wait................./
This is insane!  Biden has a lot of questions to answer!  Hunter, Tara Reid and others.
Biden Did Nothing.
I hear what ur saying and I definitely understand your anger. And if you don‚Äôt want to vote Biden then by all means don‚Äôt. But I know people who got healthcare thanks to the Medicaid expansion and that was the aca so if even one person gets healthcare cuz of Biden it‚Äôs worth it.
We know Biden can‚Äôt complete a sentence and Kamala just doesn‚Äôt make sense with her crazy rhetoric that only benefits rich politicians living in mansions somewhere
Biden wants to kill jobs and raise taxes. He‚Äôs not hiding it.
And Biden has yet to take any questions this week. See a difference here? ü§î
Did Lara secretly think Biden would pick her???
Shaddup, Biden pendants! Lets riot!
To bad Biden doesn‚Äôt take questions
Might want to check the math. Add to that, I don‚Äôt see you complaining that Biden has taken zero questions. Funny how that works
Cesar Cisneros, I‚Äôm suspendeding my candidacy for president for 2020. I‚Äôm endorsing President Donald J.Trump for President 2020. Please vote for president Trump. Do not vote for Joe Biden ,Joe Biden will hurt Our Nation severely. May God bless America.
We can't stop good trouble.  It's needed more then ever now. The line has been delineated between good and evil.  Biden and trump.
Biden does that already
LOL! Do you mean votes that biden/harris never had? Ridiculous.
Trump is running for president, too, sweetheart. Biden has never been accused of anything besides being an affectionate uncle.   You're in a cult. Cults are for the weak minded.   You are no longer worth my time.
Everyone know Biden &amp; Harris are incompetents. This shows your true colors.
She is the reason Kamala is the VP choice. If Biden wins he will step as side or be removed and Clinton will be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù as the vp for harris. You and every other democrat will be the reason too. Maybe that blows wind up your ass idk but Trump won bc Hillary sucks realize that
And by the way, NOT accused doesn't mean Biden did it, but boy do you people love to spread that shit around about him, don't you? Hypocrite much?
Only one candidate is accused of raping a child. Spoiler alert: it's not Biden. Don't pretend you care about sexual assault, or men who walk in on naked teenagers brag about it to Howard Stern (easy to find interview), because you clearly don't. Which troll farm do you work at?
After doing that, suppose you are forced to choose who would have sole responsibility to take care of a newborn baby for 24 hours, Biden or Trump (neither one is allowed any assistance, including from their running mates).
A little thought experiment.  Watch this (short) clip of Biden  and then watch any clip of Trump speaking recently (even where he is facing combative and hostile reporters, which is of course nearly all the time).
Pequot Lakes, Minnesota. Brother in law commanderring his boat, literally a Trump boat parade. I was floored at the amount pro-Trump flags on houses/cabins lining the lakes. Not 1 piece of Biden paraphernalia.
Biden and Harris will get it done. Till then more are going to die.
- have you looked into this? Biden seriously looks like he is exhibiting tardive dyskinesia. A friend with 40 years nursing experience taking care of elderly totally agrees.
Kamala calls Joe Biden a racist and then switches up and is now his running mate but y‚Äôall don‚Äôt think these people are gonna switch up once their in office ü§°
But apparently you don‚Äôt see a problem with the postal service union endorsing Biden and democrats concurrently pushing a mail in ballot this November.
You are NOT  the leadership we need. Higher taxes, open border, infringe on 2A, social programs we can‚Äôt afford .  No thank you.  Pass on Biden and Harris !
If Biden/Harris win in Nov we‚Äôre gonna sadly find out.
Democrats And Biden Are So UNHINGED And Broken That Even Obama SLAMMED B...  via
Google is now changing search results to show content about Biden when I search Trump - TRUE STORY! #google #censorship
Serious question, who is more likely to seize power if Joe Biden wins and is incapacitated within his first year?
I am aware both sides are blind to their candidates misdeeds. I am not blind to the fact that 8 women have accused Biden of sexual misconduct or that Biden Wrote and defends the Biden Crime Bill or the most disgusting act of racism between the two is Biden being pro-segregation
Still Cali though... I‚Äôve got half a dozen banners on fences around my golf course. üôÑ  Do have one Biden banner... right next to the guy that has three Trump 2020 ones, so there‚Äôs that!
Yeah women for Biden.....
Bella, you realize how stupid you sound? Trump donating his salary for 4 years is only $1.4 million dollars. His golfing every weekend has cost YOU, me, and taxpayers over $140 million. Biden making billions from China is a 5 star Pinocchio lie! Maybe Putin has answers for you?
And postal worker union endorsed Biden out of survival mode.
Wow wow wow i want to see the poll for The CHAMP Trump 2020 right now.  Your guys make me so great for the awsome leader can make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND AGAIN.  SLEEPY Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the worst candidate, defund cops, crimes up, America goes down to her knees.
You going to like when Biden takes most of your money or be in California where they will be taxing the celebrities up to 70% ?? You like working when the government gets more of your money than you do ??
Hi my name is Joe Message and I approve this Biden lol üòÇ
Animals endorse Joe Biden üêæ‚ù§ #BidenHarris2020
Is that an early picture of Biden?
Better question, can Joe Biden? #DementiaJoe
If the issue is Ducey then we need to fire/recall Ducey. Not sure how voting for Biden helps. The Dems are the ones playing games more so then the GOP at the moment and if not for Trump signing the EOs we still wouldn‚Äôt have shit coming to us.
I think many feel Biden has already won, but just like the first time around I believe the Moron can actually win again one way or another. I just hope if nothing else the senate can be flipped and the house stays as is and if he gets in they can make it impossible for him to do
Well he travels around the country and didnt know the Chiefs were in Missouri and called Colorado a border state. They both are a mess, but if you think Trump isn‚Äôt on that same level as Biden I don‚Äôt know what you are watching.
It‚Äôs truly insane to be honest how many people refuse to publicly even speak Trumps name out loud, but will be honestly voting for him in November. I don‚Äôt trust these polls as far as I throw them. I agree. The lead has to be 15 or more for Biden to feel somewhat secure
I know you despise Trump. But, why would you care about the Dem convention? The DNC shafted their voters two pres. primaries in a row. They handed it 2 Hillary in 16. Now after Biden supposedly won the nom, they're going to slide Kamala in after the inauguration.
If you vote for Biden your taxes will go up the Democrats have already promised that.  How do you think they are going to pay for all the free stuff they are going to give away?  The stock market will crash to Obama levels or lower.
Attacking Biden because they can‚Äôt come up with any accomplishments to talk about?  Or any plans he has for the country going forward?  Got it I think I will listen to Joe Biden. üò∑ #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
Have you ever scrolled through replies to Biden tweets? Some of the dumbest, most brainwashed people on the internet are super stoked for a mentally deficient old rich white pedo and a communist hag to restore honor and end corruption. Dear God, #TheGreatAwaking is coming.
Biden can't/won't have a rally,  this mask wearing is his subliminal rally.
Ummm...Greg I didn‚Äôt make up the nickname for Hiden Biden   ‚Äú1% Joe" ‚Äî  an insulting reference to Biden's past performances in the 1988 and 2008 Democratic primaries.
Lol. This is the 3rd time Biden has ran for President.  He got his nickname 1% joe because he only got 1% of the vote the last time he ran for President. Harris only got 2% of the Democrat vote when she just ran for president. You‚Äôre welcome!
Joe Biden is gonna win. Trump will lose by a landslide.
Dude, you posted the same article twice. I‚Äôve responded with memes showing my support for Biden because this is getting boring and you‚Äôre just flooding the field with BS. Now you want to segue to Obama? Who are you trying to impress?
And, I love Joe's ads that indicate he ran the successful recovery act. Remember the Obama-Biden recovery? Those who could find jobs, usually had to take on 2 to 3 part time jobs just to survive. NOW that's a recovery?

Good God...the only thing Biden has going for him is bloviating political rhetoric...
I was hoping &amp; praying that Joe Biden would choose you, for his running mate.  We need to STOP Trump, from harming America anymore than he already has!!!!!  Thank you, for being you!!!!!!!  You are a real asset to America and to the Vice President.

Rally the troops by supporting The Lincoln Project, voting for Biden/Harris, and restoring the country‚Äôs health, wealth, and honor.  Dismantle Trumpery. Don‚Äôt be a snowflake for Don the Con and Jared the jughead.
"For all his klutziness and indiscretions, Biden‚Äôs overall message appeals to our better angels and hopes, while Trump‚Äôs appeals to our demons and fears."
So Hunter &amp; James Biden (Joe's brother) have been making money off the family name because of Joe being Senator/VP for a long time. That doesn't change the fact Joe is running against the WORST President ever &amp; we'll still vote for him. The Trump crime family is the greater evil.
It votes for Biden or it gets the Trump again.
Isn't that the point of the choice?  Kamala Harris is political 'chameleon' with eye on 'Biden's job'  #FoxNews
Those that trust Trump on the economy need to remember, it was Biden who oversaw the 2009 Recovery act. Trump actually did nothing for the economy but ride on Biden's coattails.
Where‚Äôs Hunter Biden???
She doesn‚Äôt just think he‚Äôs a racist. She thinks he‚Äôs a creeper too.
Lol, you‚Äôre gonna be dissapointed then. Nobody wants a mentally dabilitated Biden and a murderous Kamala Harris
New York State‚Äôs Attorney General Letitia James Will Deliver Justice. Inmate Donald Trump, January 20, 2020!!!   President Joe Biden November 3, 2020.
President Joe Biden. Inmate Donald Trump. Pass it on.
These soft drinks are really bad for the human race and is 1 of the leading causes of OBESITY, empty calories. Even the Diet ones which have chemicals we have not come to understand. Since the Plandemic I've lost 30 lbs ,I quit eating FF n drinking sodas!
The problem with this is that it‚Äôs a hypothetical situation. Nobody knows how many people could be killed by a Biden admin because it hasn‚Äôt happened yet. With Trump, we already know and it‚Äôs getting worse every day.
The definitive piece on Biden came from Harper's called "No Joe" ... it's been called a "hit piece" or biased. Harper's has never failed a fact check.  It spells out his record disturbingly.  The Guardian piece I referenced
Let me walk through what happens if/when Biden wins; more lethal austerity for working people, more fracking, more police violence against protesters, probably another coup in Venezuela/Bolivia, definitely TPP, liberals go back to brunch and not thinking about politics.
I did a lot of research into Biden a year ago. What I found disturbed me greatly. Joe spent 40 years as a Senator who never once sided w/the people against corporate America. Dems make excuses for him all the time. I despise Trump but wanted so much better. From the Guardian:
From the BIDEN Republicans
This is still bothering me. We're quite literally living through the United States turning to fascism and half of Twitter is "Lol, check out these forever stamps you guys #hashtags" while the other half is "It's not fascism, but if Biden wins it'll be instant Marxism."
He is right, if Biden wins, the economy falls into a depression.
I'm sure Nancy Pelosi and JOe Biden do the same to help out their constituents (LOL).
I‚Äôm saying it now. President Biden.
Joe Biden fundamentally doesn't understand how our government works and is 100% unqualified to run this country. Governors don't make laws, the legislature does. Any "mandates" by governors or the president are illegal  and unenforceable #unmaskamerica #covidlies #NeverBiden
you are the one doing political interference by attempting to interfere with the Presidential election to help Biden, do you really think people are too dumb to see what you are doing?
No, fascists Biden and Harris: You cannot mandate #masks.  They have been proven to be a health hazard, and you cannot mandate a health hazard. Here's the proof:
The Media and the Democratic party are babysitting Biden.
They just doing what they told  Right now USPS &gt; anything  The way it should be  Joe Biden pedo &gt; everything
She‚Äôs a liar. She doesn‚Äôt even like Biden. She‚Äôs just trying to be president
For those interested in knowing. god it‚Äôs nothing like we wanted but we need to settle and do what we can. PLEASE vote Biden this 2020 election
What  just told me that my third party vote was a vote for Trump. Lucky me My vote is now 3 times as valuable as yours. My vote for  counts as a vote for her plus as a vote for Biden and as a vote for Trump. My vote is super powerful üòÇü§£üòÇ
I demand you do everything you can to force Biden to take a cognizant test by Sept 15th we need that. We also need for these People out of our Government please do everything possible. Start finding ways.
Obama says Biden has a knack of f'ing up everything. BFF's
Democrats scrambling to push mail voting! They know Biden cant win otherwise. If you can show up the thousands for protests, You can go to polls to vote! Its that simple!
I like presidents who weren't born rich. They understand what it's like to struggle. They learned empathy,  Biden &amp; Harris understand. Obama &amp; Clinton understood.   tRump was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, which he swallowed &amp; pooped out.   #VoteBlue2020  #BidenHarris2020
Who knows what Joe Biden wants? He doesn't answer any questions.  What a snake.
So funny when demolition rats hear an opposing view point or one they they don‚Äôt like you say Russia Russia Russia or BOT! Lol  We All know why Biden‚Äôs campaign doesn‚Äôt allow questions!

I‚Äôm Joe Message and I approve this Biden lol üòÇ
Calling an option a fact doesn‚Äôt make it a fact I strongly believe both candidates will abuse the power of the office. As for minorities Biden was pro segregation and was defending his crime bill just a few years ago. Pre Covid Trump had the lowest Minority unemployment on record
How Biden‚Äôs grief for his son helped lead him to Harris
Joe Biden is a clear cut racist but getting a pass, like how republicans give trump a pass for their ‚Äúparty‚Äù we deserve better than 2 racist old men
Even male actors don't put their arms around women for photos anymore to show they aren't sexually assaulting the woman. . It's easy to accuse sexual assault. It is a genuinely disgusting problem. I want to give both sides the benefit of doubt. With Biden.... WTF
Started with Beto O'Rourke and worked my down. I think Biden was the weakest of all Dems running.
Kamala Harris and Biden only one will be in charge and it's not Uncle Joe. Harris will try to run the country because Biden cannot. Kamala cannot run the country. Foreign affairs Iran North Korea China she has no experience to stand up to these countries. Just a bobblehead.

Watching Biden and Harris they're always asked questions. But we never get any answers instead leave the room with no answers 2 questions asked. What are they afraid of? I guess they don't have answers. Well sooner or later they will have to answer questions in debates. We'll see

Not to worry. The Postal Workers union, responsible for getting ballots in, endorsed Biden.
I would take any version of Biden over Trump...childish names and all.
We saw your hatred for Trump, not one word about the socialist plans Biden has for our country, you don't care about the country only your hatred for Trump..we saw you.
Saw you on PBS, didn't hear 1 thing that you agree with Biden on, no discussion of his plans for the country, just how much you hate Trump, you don't care about the country just your hatred of the President.
Josh ,vote for Biden . He has been a career politician for 50 years. What has he done to get this country ready for the Corona Virus ? What has he done to make this a better country but of course it will all change we Biden is in charge
You believe the racist sexual predator who wrote the Biden crime bill and the lady who used the Biden crime bill to imprison thousands of people for victimless crimes who were disproportionately from minority communities is voting in their best interest.
Yep and the #DummiesforDictators  Are going to try to vote in Biden and Harris.
But if they would have endorsed Biden you would have been alright with it #idiot

This was pretty eye opening....  (If Biden actually is the nominee.... I have a feeling the DNC might change nominees before the convention due to health concerns - IMO)
It sad to think we live in such a world that people would do this without remorse while the rest of world allows it.   It is also quite annoying that Americans can be more wrapped up in Biden vs Trump than care about about how we are giving billions to that evil government.
This makes perfect sense. IMO he is being BLACKMAILED by Harris.

How selfless of her! I hear she's good at cleaning up problems #Bleachbit   #FoxNews
You trashed Biden at the debate, now you lie and say he's great. You said Biden picked a black woman, but your mother is from india? Typical shady, wishy washy politician.
Not trusted. Your bias, misleading,  you have become involved in politics, now untrustworthy. You show Biden speaking but not my president? I don't care about your personal hangups with the man, I want all the news. Call yourself most trusted, that's BULL.
LOL. Isn't it sad that the only thing the GOP has is this made up false narrative? Creating a boogeyman then accusing the eternal Moderate Biden of being that boogeyman. Mud and lies is the only thing that the GOP has to fight with. No accomplishments, no aspirations.
Here we go.  Enter Michelle.   Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical *to defeating Trump*. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.

Short clip from Beau Biden. It's wonderful.
JOE BIDEN HAS NO CLUE!  via
is out here telling us to vote Biden/Harris and then has just released a video that is calling for end of cash bail. Pathetic.
Biden sold us, America, out in so many ways to foreign powers. He clearly doesn‚Äôt put America first which is why Trump will win in November.
I honestly liked his take that Marx and Lenin would be Bernie staffers endorsing Biden  I would pay to see that happen
You can replace ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù with ‚ÄúObama‚Äù or ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù and your narrative remains true.
Biden cozied up to our enemies? Maybe it was to assault them, as is the republican narrative completely forgetting their rapist-in-chief? Or was it how Biden calls Putin privately while tacitly OK-img the pay-for-murder of American soldiers? Oh wait, that was your guy too.
I didn‚Äôt realize he felt that strongly about Biden
Postal workers endorse Joe Biden. #Biden2020
Fuckin SAME  but for now it's just biden harris :/
Vote for Biden by all means! Honestly he can‚Äôt wreak the amount of havoc America that Trump has (and will do even more if he‚Äôs re-elected.
Uhhh... Joe Biden is the one who claimed he would defund social security. We need to replace SS with an individual investment account that is tied to a hedge fund that gov isn‚Äôt allowed to steal money from unlike SS. IIA‚Äôs are the only way to go. Everyone would retire with $1m+
I feel like a racist jackass assuming just because of the last name jumping to that conclusion. But at least I didn‚Äôt pull a Biden and ask if either of them ran a 7-11.
let‚Äôs entertain this hypothetical for a moment  in this case, assuming the 6,000 comes from Trump, Biden signifies a 1,000 person net gain in # of lives saved (unironically good)  of course, the hypothetical is a hypothetical. in a non-hypothetical sense, there‚Äôs no other choice.
This is the first decent Biden tweet ive seen.  Too bad he didn't come up with it
The Chinese and Gov Cuomo are responsible for the deaths. Maybe you need to go back and look at the timeline, what the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù were saying, Biden calling Trump xenophobic for closing down boarder and Pelosi encouraging everyone to come to Chinatown to celebrate w/o a mask.
Vote for biden!!!!
Biden and Harris better light some sage up in there before they move in
Aside from not being the one who would take office? A vote for Biden is really a vote for Harris at this point. If that motivates you.
Lmao Biden spent his whole career doing nothing for the left and now he‚Äôs the democratic nominee and supported by every major progressive leader. Let‚Äôs start a new party now!
How is our country gone forever if Biden wins??? We did just fine when he was VP
Is Joe Biden a communist?
" ain‚Äôt right" because Joe Biden didn't pick Stacey Abrams as his VP running mate? So stupid &amp; divisive.  1) Was Abrams promised the VP position? 2) You, I assume, know the harm caused by racism, yet YOU are being a racist by rejecting Kamala as a Black woman. #nuts
Postal carriers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake
Because Biden didn't choose her as his VP running mate? Seriously? Strange you didn't mention Republican Jack Kemp who ACTUALLY DID screw over Stacey Abrams. He threw 10% off voter rolls, removed polling places from Black neighborhoods, rejected 53,000 mail-in ballots... #Facts
No - Trump has them looking into Biden.  I no linger believe in the independence if the FBI Rosenstein proved they have MAGA in leadership.

Vote for Biden, keep working to make things better. With Trump there is no way to correct anything, no chance whatsoever to make things better. Btw, I try telling this to Libertarians dead set on promoting and voting for only the Libertarian candidate‚Äîbut they‚Äôre not having it.
If I were working for team Biden at this point I would start buying as many N95 masks as possible to donate to supporters who will have to stand in long lines on election day.  Request the day off now, and wear a mask, it's the only way to save the Republic and democracy.
Biden is center to center-right. The ‚Äúcentrists‚Äù in the party are just corporatists, imperialists and standard banners of the same status-quo shit that gave us Trump.

All you do is complain about meaningful change. Well, here‚Äôs a piece of information that it actually RELEVANT instead of senseless whining: you won‚Äôt get anything done if you don‚Äôt elect Biden. If you want change, vote, or you‚Äôll never see that change happen.
But in the spirit of talking about creepy pervs in politics, let‚Äôs look back at your main man, Biden. Have you just been in a cave this whole time? Or are you blatantly ignoring VERY similar claims against him, simply bc some of the policies he believes in align with your morals?
Damn right! Let's get this virus under control. Everyone can wear a mask for the protection of everyone else. It's the decent and patritotic thing to do for our country.  Biden calls for mask mandates in all 50 states: 'It's about saving Americans' lives'
What outcome are you looking for? More of what we‚Äôre living through or a team, Biden/Harris, that can start to heal the country and save our democracy? Kamala was my choice for top of the ticket and I personally think she‚Äôs Biden choice too. Get me?
FYI-the Repubs, Ron Johnson and some other low-lifes are doing "investigating" again to smear Obama and the Bidens.  Get tough Team Biden/Harris. trump is corrupt to the very core. How dare they continually bring up Obama or the Bidens. We don't back down. #BidenHarris2020

Yesterday during my FB live, I used the example of Biden's movement on the Hyde Amendment. He moved because he was pushed by progressives and organizations like Planned Parenthood. He wasn't moved by silence and capitulation. He was moved by activism and accountability. 2/

Biden is not behind these superficial statements. Mandated masks is a leftist power/control grab, from the DNC oligarchy.
Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical to defeating Trump. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.
I really appreciate Joe Biden wanting to force people to wear masks for their own good sincerely Satan
i mean has she said anything that would indicate she's not anti-capitalist? her view that ppl should vote for biden to prevent trump reelection is a valid one, whether you agree with it or not (your view is valid too, although i disagree with it). it doesn't make her a lib
we have valid reasons for voting for biden as well. we won't consider voting green because we don't think they can win. i live a state that has shifted from red to purple, my vote actually matters and can affect the outcome. it's different for ppl in solid red/blue states
Cuomo is as brainless as Pelosi, Biden, Harris and anyone else who would be stupid enough to put a patient in a nursing home being positive for covid-19. Try again.

Biden has been wrong about everything for 40 years the only thing he holds steady on is his constant racism! #Trump2020 #NowMoreThanEver
Biden is trying to mandate wearing masks for 3 months, and then adds he would talk to the governors about mandating. In other words, he is being the authoritarian but admits that decision is up to the states, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP IS DOING
I agree James! Biden is so far ahead in the polls it reminds me of the night trump won!
at the very least, we *know* that trump will continue to accelerate the pandemic. we don't know if biden will or not (but most likely he won't). so we have a better gamble with biden on this issue
And Biden ahead in the polls! Oh it‚Äôs MSM polls overseen by fact checkers! ü§£ü§£
. is right. As a delegate to the  I joined with him &amp; 100s of Biden, Bernie &amp; Warren delegates in voting NO on the platform because it excludes #MedicareForAll.  Especially during this pandemic, it is time to #DrawTheLine and guarantee health care to all as a right.
Tulsi debunked Clinton and Harris, the DNC, Russian plant, 3rdy party spoiler conspiracy theory and did as she said she was going 2 do from day 1. Support the eventual nom. U dont see her actively push her supporters 2 vote Biden, say how Biden will b the next FDR.Bernie does tho

This might actually sway the polls in Trump's favor. If Biden is smart he won't commit to anything with her until after Nov 3.

would biden call covid-19 "the chinese virus" and claim it's a hoax to prevent his reelection? would he encourage states to hastily reopen and for his supporters to not wear masks? would he tell americans to not listen to the cdc or who? would he hold rallies in a pandemic?
okay, all true, all fair points. but would biden roll back protections for queer ppl? would biden eliminate the aca and daca? would biden write rules explicitly allowing discrimination against queer ppl? would biden incite his base to violence and spew anti-science rhetoric?
What an ass . He can‚Äôt call for anything. Watch now we will have Biden supporters with masks and the rest of the country will take them off !!!
yeah, i mean it is one issue. you need to show me how as a whole trump and biden are the same. not "they agree on these points", but "biden would cause equal the harm as trump would". i know biden is bad, but i'm still not convinced he's as bad as trump
Judicial Watch uncovered Secret Service records showing Hunter Biden traveled to China five time and also visited Moscow. But  didn‚Äôt get all the records, so JW were forced to go to court to find out more. ITS ALL BEING COVERED UP!!  WHERE ARE REPUBLICANS?? #JudicialWatch
but bringing up a single issue that he and trump are identical on doesn't argue against that. i brought up issues that trump is worse than biden on, so the appropriate thing is to counter those claims, not yell "whatabout israel??"
I keep getting reported by Biden/Harris followers.
OK, so now what do you add here? What is the contrast to Senate Democrats, which Mark Kelly would join? What is contrast to Biden/Harris?
He in fact does not have the authority to do that and neither would Joe Biden.
it was still odd for them to bring it up, because it didn't help anyone's point. trump and biden both support israel, so why mention it at all?
Sincerely, &amp; respectfully, I seek to understand.  First, know that I appreciate GOP or Ex-GOP biden votes as a sacrifice.  Thank you.  So in that context - help me - "Kamala messed up on Kavanaugh"  My objective = understand, learn.
We can and SHOULD be critical of EVERY candidate because they are not perfect and should be held accountable. While Tr*mp is the worst candidate here we shouldn‚Äôt just give Biden/Harris a free pass because they‚Äôre the lesser of two evils
There are two options in 2020 for conservatives   1. Biden wins, Republicans go back to being conservatives and win back the house and Senate in 2022 2. Trump wins, nobody ever checks the spending, we spiral out of control with debt and race riots.   There isn‚Äôt a third option.
It took a pandemic and a full country shut down to get to Obama and Biden‚Äôs highest point in the economy. So yea, keep shoveling the B.S.
I am proud of my government and how the world views the USA...‚Ä¶.Pre-2016!! I have been crying for the last 3.5 years. After watching Biden/Harris I am still crying ..... tears of happiness! Anybody else?
When I say there's no moral high ground, I mean between Trump and Biden. Their policy overlap is pretty high. It's just rhetoric that changes. I will not support someone who is evil, whether that be Trump or Biden.
Then they sure don't want their Daughters around Biden.
Lmao. Ignorance. Trump called for more testing not less. You must be a Biden Harris Fan. In that case just start giving up your rights. üòÇ
They are so stupid. Kanye will take away votes from Trump, not from Biden.
The difference Matt is that the Obama/Biden administration dealt with the problem unlike what Trump has done. See Matt, Trump ignored the growing pandemic, said it would be gone in a few weeks. Obama/Biden immediately worked on the issue, didn‚Äôt disband the pandemic response team
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
i do care about each of those. what's suspicious is that this person seems to act like israel is the worst enemy to humanity. like why bring israel into the conversation? trump and biden both support israel, so why being it up as a point against biden? it's odd to me
i already read that thread. what's your point? i don't like kamala either, but that doesn't change anything for me. in fact i dislike biden more than kamala. still not as much as i despise trump
First question do you still believe Tara Reade? Next is joe Biden still the racist you called him in your campaign?  How many men did you sleep with to reach your goals? Were they all married men
I was wrong about Biden. He‚Äôs not the incoherent bum I thought he was.
um, no, you can oppose fascism and vote for biden. in fact, we're voting for biden to prevent a fascist from staying in office
if biden were to do the same shit trump has been doing, he wouldn't get reelected. he knows that he'll have to reverse trump's policies if he's going to get a second term (that's what he's running on now). so there's also that accountability holding him to a certain standard
biden would just be the obama administration again. it is obvious that trump is far far far worse than obama. trump restricted rights of queer ppl, obama set protections (that trump later overturned). so it's a reasonable assumption that biden will not be as bad as trump
sorry but this i just can't wrap my head around. i don't see how anyone  can think trump and biden are equally bad, especially during this pandemic that trump has been accelerating through science-denialism

i'm NOT saying all this to persuade anyone to vote for biden. i'm saying this so you can understand my perspective. maybe then you can stop calling me and others "liberals" and "faux-leftists", when i'm literally an ancom. we don't need this gatekeeping and purity testing
The most reliable constituency in dem primaries in black women. And they overwhelmingly choose Biden. Those are the on the ground numbers state after state. So. No conspiracy here. Just democracy. Not perfect. But there it is.
Joe Biden said 150 million Americans died from guns and  120 million from COVID-19
if you don't understand why i plan to vote for biden: i'm just so terrified of of trump getting re-elected that i'm willing to do anything to prevent it. trump has taken away some of my rights as a queer trans person; this is personal for me
i will vote for biden because i can't take another 4 years of trump. he's already taken away some of the few rights i had as a queer/trans person. i want to prevent fascism from taking a stronger hold in the country; that may not be "change" but it is prevention

People will suffer regardless of who is in office. Biden is rejecting a true need for healthcare reform as people die or lose their homes due to the cost/69% support. Biden supports our wars overseas where the last admin he was in had a 90% civilian casualty rate. No moral ground
that makes no sense wtf. i'm voting for biden because i don't want the literal white supremacist in the white house. is that hard to understand?
BS. My wife and I are older folk and we support Trump. Most of our friends feel the same way, too. You wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to lie unless you were already worried Biden will lose the election.
Biden issues a mandate for everyone to wear masks outside!  What exactly is he in charge of to issue said mandate? #Trump2020
My state is a swing state, but even then I would encourage people who believe in their convictions to vote how they feel. I'm voting Biden but it's definitely the cowards way out for those who want real change, but I can only live my life and do best by the people I love.
Bit by the Biden Ants
Its 112 and higher next week in Arizona.  I will not wear my mask outside. Way to hot for that. Biden can get lost.

Sorry, you can‚Äôt convince me most Vets would prefer Marxism/Socilalism over voting for Trump. That‚Äôs BS. He has at least tried to change the terrible conditions at VA hospitals and how Veterans are treated. Remind me again what branch of service Biden and Harris served in?

Hey if Al Gore invented the internet, I'm sure Biden/Obama were in some part responsible for the US landing on the moon.
sure but i just dont see how this is an argument against voting for biden. like yeah a lot of things have lead to trump, but am i supposed to say "well guess i should go with the flow of history"?
They're probably gonna give it to Biden
So all that to say you are part of the 1% that voted for Joe Biden in his previous 2 attempts to run for president or the 2% that voted for Kamala Harris for President in the primaries? Which is it?

This is one of the many reasons I will be voting for Biden in November. We HAVE to keep moving forward, not backwards. Betsy wants to take leaps backwards.

If you were 50/50 between Biden and Trump and went 3rd party instead, it wouldn't be an issue because they both lost an equal shot at your vote.  It's not so much a vote for trump as a reduction in possible votes for Biden.  That being said, vote shaming is wrong, vote your heart
Any 12 year old joe Biden supporter needs to be yelled at sorry
You were never going to vote for trump, but you might have voted for Biden if he wasn't such a colossal tool. You voting third party or not voting represents the loss of a potential vote for King Douche but has no impact on trump, so it benefits him that you're not voting Biden.
I know I am!  Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô
Not enough time. By electing Biden it becomes a moot point.
How's that  house you're living in now for backing down and rolling over to let Joe Biden become the presumptive Democratic nominee
yeah that shit was awful. i hate that we have biden now instead of bernie. it sucks, but my biggest concern at the moment is whether trump gets elected, because frankly i can't tolerate another 4 years of this shit

Not voting is a vote for no one. It‚Äôs not a vote for Trump. It‚Äôs not a vote for Biden. The way America has put all the blame of corrupt politicians on the working class is bizarre.
has been arguing with me about Biden and Harris and how I need to vote for them because at least it's a shuffle in the right direction.   A shuffle ain't big enough. I want a fuckin rocket.
You‚Äôve destroyed the country. Joe Biden is our only hope
Let‚Äôs not forget what Harris did to Kavanaugh. Whe WAS very nasty. Horrible horrible person. Does anyone think Biden is a racist?  Only Harris. #nasty
it really doesn't take much energy or time though. also never claimed voting for biden is "revolutionary", i claimed it's strategic to prevent a worse outcome
Please don‚Äôt trouble yourself to come on my account. I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris! #facts
Not hardly.  I'd sooner vote for a Pig than Biden.
I‚Äôd rather hear you then BIden and Blowie
I get it. We cannot allow someone with a disgusting track record on criminal justice like Biden/Harris into office. We must vote Trump to save our face.  #maga
Nope gotta see Trump smash Biden
By the way what message was Joe Biden sending when he put his hand above Kamala Harris‚Äôs rump Creepy Joe just can‚Äôt help himself or maybe there is a sinister message like ‚Äú I got your back African Americans‚Äù
The ouster of the incumbent is a beginning, no more, and if Biden's no more than an unimaginative repairman, we will need to press for more fundamental reforms across a broad front. The best Biden can do is to call for a national discussion of the issue.
Kamala Harris Brings Extreme Gun Control Position to Biden Ticket
If Trump willingly leaves office in January, a focus of the Biden/Harris administration should be a post card tax return. Many Americans will have confusing returns next year - at least make it less complicated for them.
Joe Biden picked up the endorsement of the Revolutionary Communist Party USA.
The difference between Biden and Trump. Biden sends Billions to Ukrain to save his own ass and lets his son profit millions. Trump sends his Son in law to broker a peace deal with Israel and the UAE and he gets it done. #TRUMPISMYPRESIDENT #MAGA2020
Fuck yeah she was! She was my first choice for president and the main reason I am excited to vote for Biden!  The  days are numbered.
Get used to this white people if you want to elect Joe Biden
No, I don‚Äôt believe he ran for POTUS, so was pointing out that Kamala obvs had more support than Pence did so Trumps ‚Äúargument‚Äù is silly (per usual). I agree that a Biden/Harris win would immediately start the healing process we desperately need. Love you too!
The difference between the two sides is that we don't expect gov't to make everything better. If you want to know the big appeal, it's what did Trump do to stay TF out of my way and let me make my life better. If you rely on Biden/Harris to make your life better, that's pathetic
There is a new facebook group called Latter day Saints for Joe. Biden is speaking to the group this Saturday
Putin thinks trump is his private pawn, we will show him he will not win and we will take care of yu Putin when Biden takes office. Big time sanctions against you for all the interference in our elections. Putin &amp; Trump, your days are numbered.

Why the surprise? Biden is just showing us how appropriate it would be to have him be POTUS.Politics won't confirm whose healthy and whose not to hide stories.  President Trump's brother had health issues as does Biden. Stop lying about people. Biden isn't America.  Nor is Kamala.
That is indeed laughable! Again, just like the "cages" were installed in the Obama-Biden administration, so too the removal of postal boxes also began in the Obama-Biden administration.
Its ok to have Kamala in office when she was continually knifing Biden in the back verbally b4 he chose her ?
CBS says Wall Street breathes "sigh of relief" at Harris pick. Well, Job Exporting Wall Street is the enemy of working people so expect Harris to be, too - no matter what phony claims are laid on to get elected. Harris and Biden are Corporate Shills from way back.
Biden is beginning Alzheimers candidate instead of president material.  You want Kamala Harris correcting his fuck ups ?
# Biden in the basement when Trump has been out paying people visits for his campaign.

Biden and Harris said that if your convicted of a hate crime you can not get a gun these two are idiots.
Biden and Harris said anyone convicted of a hate crime can not get a gun which is it either your coming to get our guns or not these two are idiots.

All I know is y are we sitting around like mushrooms. Y is it nobody can ask or open up Biden an Harris on they‚Äôre bullshit
1/ The Entire message of the Democratic Party is "Trump is bad." They offer NOTHING positive for America's struggling workers. Hillary did the same in 2016 and look what happened.  Nate Silver just gave Biden a 71% chance of winning and Trump, only 21%.
1/ Joe Biden is Not radical. He is a crooked corporatist and was right of center on most things, but not Good right. Bad Right as in wanting to cut Social Security and Medicaid.

Maybe a neuro-physiologist should explain to Brian how psychomotor activity and higher cognitive processes like decision making differ. Apparently he is totally unaware of how little they are related. Glad to see Biden getting cardio-vascular expercise tho. Good for body &amp; brian.

Why would anyone believe that? Looking back over his career, Biden could have done that but never did. This is just another empty, hollow, Dem promise not worth znyone's serious consideration. In a word, it's just more Dem MALARKEY.
I don't have room in my life for people who just can't accept who they are and think making a marked statement it about it will change them . Meghan Markle is one , Joe Biden is another.  A copycat politician who uses Donald Trump as an excuse to think he's better.

Ah, &amp; no mention of China working for Biden. How blind, how deaf. If foreign intervention is worth worrying about, then it's worth worrying about with respect to both candidates or neither, but showing partiality is not the solution.
Shove Joe Biden back where he belongs.  It's not in the White House either.  He's so stupid he copycats Donald Trump's campaigns.
Some professor tried to push Biden 101 on us at FAU in the mid 70's, or FAA-EWW  as it was known on the party circuit. We plied him with so much Jagermeister ,that he's now pen pals with Newt.

You should examine Biden's lifelong racism which he conveniently lost to become VP and an identity gp. panderer. As a typical Democrat, he projects his sins on others. He opposed school bussing, school integration and befriended KKKByde, his "mentor. He wrote1994 Criminal Act ...

It was Obama who built the cages and put the children into them. Obama separated 38,000 ppl.  Trump provided schooling, medical needs, recreation and nutrition for them all.  NOT Biden/Obama.  Once again you lie.
Kamala totes alot of importance on science when discussing covid, but fails to recognize she and Biden have no chemistry.
I mandate Biden goes and  himself!
True, as far as we know Biden was never on Epstein's Lolita Express.
Yup. It should be obvious to one and all that a Biden Regime will be a rehash of Clinton/Obama/Hillary.  Don't know why this came to my head thinking of Bloomberg it's not even from my era. Money ain't for nothin' Lol
Makes $cents$ to me. Larry Summers has been advising Biden which means we would be soooooo EFFED.
She is a nasty, malicious, unethical hot mess. Proven during her days as prosecutor when she now did a 180 on everything she purported to believe just to be Biden's nominee. Dread to see her as President (Biden will turn the office over to her soon should he win). BUT Joe=loser.
Harris, a hot mess, a horrendous prosecutor, very malicious/nasty senator, has done 180 on her positions to become Biden's nominee. She would be a disaster and since Biden is only a placeholder, I dread what would happen to our country if she really took the reins.  NO to Harris.
Bloomberg to speak at Democratic convention   What role will Bloomberg have in a possible Biden regime?
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô  #FoxNews
STORIC PEACE AGREEMENT' BETWEEN ISRAEL, UAE     THIS IS REAL, TRUE SOUL OF OUR NATION! Despite the most vile &amp; malicious things hurled against him, Pres. Trump continues to amass huge accomplishments daily. This one is HUGE (and something Obama/Biden would never be able to do).

From Biden‚Äôs website, it‚Äôs also a donation when you purchase üôÇ
Sigh. Looks to me like the Biden accounts with 10 followers are much more prevalent
There are more Biden supporters at trump rallies protesting the great president then came out to hear a vegetable and a communist
If Biden debates President Trump, it will be done remotely. Off camera he will have people writing answers on boards or into teleprompter so he can read the answers.
TW: suicide  anyone who reads this thread and thinks that voting in a national election means nothing, i don‚Äôt get you. no way in hell you can convince me a HRC admin would have resulted in the same or that a Biden admin ‚Äúwon‚Äôt change anything.‚Äù absolutely fucking bleak.
OMG, terrible thought occurred to me. what am I gonna tweet about when Trump loses? What kind of rage-induced tweeting can I get outta Biden??
Was Biden's mangling of her name all about disrespect?  Huh?
Why is Biden allowed to lie on Twitter?  Apparently because he‚Äôs a Democrat?
She only got 3% of the primary votes and won't bring him Calif. as it's already Democrat. She is a strategically bad move for Biden with her ton of stinky baggage, but I'm delighted.  VOTE RED!
He doesn‚Äôt have to come out of his basement.  His campaign is predicated on trump being trump and basically voting himself out of office every time he opens his mouth!  Biden/Harris just sit back at laugh at the stupidity!!
Joe Biden is the only presidential candidate who was personnel friends with a Klu Klux Klan leader.
Fellow white folks, let‚Äôs talk about what Joe Biden did yesterday.   Think about it. A member of the old boys‚Äô club DELIBERATELY and VERY PUBLICLY used his position and his societal privilege to elevate a member of a marginalized population to a position she richly deserves.1/3
I just watched the Biden/Harris presser. It made me proud to be an American again. I haven't felt this way for over 3 and a half years now. As they said, it's about the soul of our country. Come on America, we can do this come November 3rd.
Mama Kamala and Uncle Joe too the rescue.                           BIDEN &amp; HARRIS WILL SAVE THE USA!!!!!!!!!!              So happy üòÅ
Biden talking about Trump's racist rhetoric is about as rich as it gets.  And now it's the 'very fine people on both sides' lie.  He's just another shithead politician who enriched himself at your expense while gleefully shipping your jobs overseas.
He advised Biden not to extend an invitation to her! So it seems even Willie has had enough of her!!
And there is an even simpler reason: Biden would absolutely not have taken someone from a Senate seat who would be replaced by a GOP governor. Warren could have checked every box and he wouldn‚Äôt risk losing the seat.
Biden wanted the minority vote so bad... as a matter fact he‚Äôs even grown a bit entitled about it. But he previously announced that it was going to be a woman. Kamala is both black and Asian so... ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I remember Justin complaining OBAMA/BIDEN when they did the EXACT SAME THING....
Hiding &amp; working for Biden/Harris campaign
Anyone up for a survey? OFFICIAL: TRUMP-PENCE vs BIDEN-HARRIS  Pres Trump wants all responses sent to his office in 1 HR. Who will you vote for in November? Answer here:
What is so interesting is that Biden didn't need her to bring in California.  Not a wise strategic move, Joe, but then nothing you've ever done has been wise.

Biden picked VP running mate, not for her qualifications, just because she‚Äôs black

She SOLD HER SOUL for this. Biden IS racist: opposed school integration-a "jungle," loved KKKByrd -"mentor &amp; friend," consistently made racist "jokes," surprised Obama was "clean&amp;articulate," used "n word" in Senate speeches many times, ad nauseam. Now he panders for black votes!
Joe Biden has a weird obsession with little girls ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è trump is trump Kamala a coon ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è we headed in a bad mf direction
In the 1920's Democrats were lynching, supporting KKK &amp; instituting Jim Crow. Learn your history! Republicans freed Democrats' slaves and fought for the Civil Rights laws against people like Thurmond, Byrd and yes - even Biden who opposed school integration and loved KKK Byrd.
Biden, lead us?! Ha. Your best joke yet.
Ever wonder who is running the PR campaign for the Lib looser's  Biden/Harris??? Just think, you could have had Bernie and ??? another Bernie.  Great choice Dems.
Trump/Pence win in 2020 = Zionists win.  Biden/Harris win in 2020 = Zionists win.  Either way humanity loses.
Yes, because a single mail truck, containing, let‚Äôs say 100 ballots (being generous), with a poll expected (again being generous) 55 votes Biden, 44 votes Trump, 1 other would do anything in moving the vote anywhere.  Think.
Biden has to have notes to make it through a friendly phone call.  Wow.  That's impressive.  He'll eat Putin's lunch for sure.
You know you ridin with Biden
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. You will make a great team. I‚Äôm so proud to be voting Biden/Harris 2020.
I knew about her lackluster performance when she was in Cali but I choose to hope she‚Äôs become a better person since then. I‚Äôd still prefer her and Biden over Trump and Pence
You bet we do want Biden-Harris in the White House b/c Harris is not ultra liberal. But play your little tired games of ohhhhhhhhh that‚Äôs socialism. Socialism is giving $2T tax breaks to the 1% on the backs of the middle &amp; working class, Debbie.
You've sold your soul and all principles you may have had. This is tragic. Biden is a hapless mush who once was a segregationist, a racist "jokester" and a friend of KKKByrd he calls a mentor.   Biden WILL lose and you'll go down with him.
Biden could‚Äôve picked Howdy Doodie &amp; he wouldn‚Äôt have lost my vote. Oh &amp; Black folk miss me with the argument about prosecutors, prosecuting crimes! When a criminal attacks your family you don‚Äôt see color.
I love how they paint Biden and now Harris as far left.
If I had a choice to vote for Trump, Biden or Putin I would gladly vote for my comrade Vlad.
I totally agree and understand why Kamala was picked for him.   Biden will not run for a second term IF he wins. This gives her a head start for 2024.  Most likely Joe will not finish his first term which is the only way she could ever be POTUS.
Trump: Some men insulted that Biden vowed to name female VP - ABC News -  via
So, who do you think KH will pick as her VP when Biden, if he wins, steps down for the good of the Nation? AOC?
Biden will be hearing Kamala's spike heeled foot steps in the shadows while he sleeps.
Team Biden is FkED! Trump 2020
Proud to support the Biden Harris ticket. Less than 90 days to get 45 out of the White House.
Will Michael Bloomberg be the Ambassador to Israel if Joe wins.   Biden won‚Äôt rule out naming donors as envoys, despite criticism  via
They saw record profits under Trump. Bankers are backing Biden anyway.  via
What Bull. Biden, the real racist, supported segregation, KKKByrd, and worse. He can't do or say a thing his handlers don't script for him. And you should have taken Willie's advice bc you will not help him win. You won't get near the WH.
BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
This is what Pence said in AZ "As you all know, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left," he said. "So given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand, it's no surprise that he chose Senator Harris
Umm I think she will be talking and his lips will be moving! I‚Äôm not sure how she is going to get around some of her and Biden‚Äôs difference of opinions! Such as her saying she vehemently against Fracking he said he would not approve any new permits but would not stop it.
Divine 9, salons, barbershops, black organizations, black churches, picnics, barbecues, anyone with an ounce of decency; step and support Biden/Harris.  The goal collectively should be to rid the WH of the current inhabitants!!  VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!!  IT DOES!
Biden does not remember that he was in that debate...sad
Pence will batch slap her in a debate just like she did to Biden
Business as usual.  üîΩüîΩ  Wall Street executives are glad Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to be his VP running mate
Kamala Harris attacks Joe Biden on busing, race in Democratic debate
And this is who you all want as your vice president really LOL. Isn‚Äôt Biden bad enough
Can Bernie shame  his Berners into voting for a Biden/Kamala ticket?
Biden/Harris 2020 uh US Senate ü§£
Trump took the bait and called Kamala a ‚ÄúNasty Women‚Äù.    Where have we heard that before?    He consistently puts down stong Women.   Smart Women Against Trump (SWAT).  We the women of American are coming for you Agent Orange. #KamalaHarrisForVP #Biden   #TrumpIsLosing
I know y‚Äôall not gonna let trump win AGAIN. ü§° we know joe Biden and Kamala suck ass GET OVER YOURSELF
The Obama/Hillary mantra has always been to purge the left.   Even a Dem center left leaner should not vote for this center right Biden/Harris Republican ticket.
I refuse to be excited for someone with a troubling history intertwined with policing and the prison industrial complex. I'm voting for Biden but am less than thrilled with this choice.
A Biden/Kamala ticket proves Hedges is spot on again.
Im just glad Biden‚Äôs VP pick isnt also a million years old
Joe Biden is excited and ready time sniff!
In roughly 60 days, Arizonans will receive early ballots with the historic team of  and  at the top of the ticket. Biden Harris WILL win AZ,  the White House and WILL restore the soul of our nation. #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
Press conf in Wilmington tomorrow.  Just a stunner.  What's the over/under on how many days it takes Biden to get west of the Mississippi?
Biden/Harris do not support defunding the police and you know it. I‚Äôm sure you are looking forward to the Harris/Pence debate as much as America. If you continue to lie it will not go well for you at the debate. America will watch you be humiliated.
And you will Andrew. I have faith that Biden/Harris will unite the party. And the country will rally around them.
The 2020 Center Right Republican ticket is Biden/Kamala.  The 2020 Far Right Republican ticket is Trump/Pence.
You Democrats are the most scurrilous, malicious group to come down the road in decades. And YOU will help Biden lose -- big.
Joe Biden Is Back At It Again, Just Chose Kamala Harris As His Running Mate. ü§î #BidenVP
I think it speaks volumes about the type of person Biden is to choose Harris. That he can forgive the primary debates.

At least he has them and takes numerous questions that aren't pre-approved from 'reporters' he's been told to call upon.  What's the journalistic value of Biden's TWO 'press conferences' other than comedy?
23,000 LIES from the POTUS. Not one word from Trump is believed now. Unfit to lead. Go Biden. Truth matters!!!!!
Russia is so over. Trump's sanctions harsher than anything Obama/Biden did. "I'll have more flexibility after my re-election." to "Vlad."   You Democrats are hypocritical, malicious idiots.  WHY AREN'T YOU ASKING ABOUT HOW CHINA AND IRAN ARE WORKING TO ELECT BRAIN-DAMAGED BIDEN?!
America needs leadership from a President who will not try to divide us, or try to make us afraid of each other, but rather work to bring us together, to be an example that we can look up to and be proud to call our President. Trump has proven to be a divider. Biden will unite us
You think Biden could do anything? His virus "plan" was directly plagiarized from Trump's web page.  Biden's ads about American made/American jobs has been Trump's message and success for 4 years. Biden is a demented loser and you are backing the wrong horse.
...and about minorities, esp. Black ppl. Now Biden's talk is all scripted to cover up what the man actually is-a brain dead puppet. It's so obvious you are all over the place in your attempt to get revenge for being fired. You will NOT be resurrected. Biden will lose.
Trump IS expanding the Republican Party with outreach to all minorities; he will have higher black and hispanic vote counts than ever before. Biden is a proven racist: his "jokes", his friendships w/ KKK Byrd and stance against school integration, his patronizing talk to ...
Joe Biden for President
JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT
Bullshit! Obama-Biden didn‚Äôt do shit for the American people.
My gut on the ground says its about +2 - +4 for Biden, and +6 - +10 for Kelly ...... State is hard to get a gauge on at times because the pockets that are conservative are extremely conservative
thanks,i used to be like a huge trump supporter but there‚Äôs so many things that have happened that make me question him but it‚Äôs not like biden is a much better choice. it‚Äôs a really scary time we all live in and the people who want to do the actual good will never get the chance
Murton, you need to smarten up. Pres. Trump is the BEST, most hard-working, patriotic, efficient and capable president in decades.  If you vote for dementia-challenged Biden, you've said it all.
Benghazi will be used against her.   Biden will be the bobblehead the MIC, Wall St., Zionists, War Mongers want and Rice will put muscle behind it and be the enforcer.
Biden is a lifelong racist who only "evolved" when he was made Obama's VP. He continues his racist "jokes" and alliances. He can't help himself and has made many Freudian slips during this campaign. Lewis can't change that. Trump for ALL races and religions.
Obama and Hillary will pick Susan Rice to be Biden's VP.

The Dems are corrupt, too.  If it happens at all it will be a media circus and no one will actually be made accountable. I am supporting Biden and other Dem candidates but not very hopeful.
When he said this I laughed so hard. He LITERALLY insulted the black community. So much for, ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt really black if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden‚Äù
Biden‚Äôs staff apologized on his account. Joe probably doesn‚Äôt even know what he said.
Biden wnats all illegals working in America to receive free healthcare. This is after they take jobs away from a hardworking American, who doesn‚Äôt receive free healthcare.

VP Biden you are correct to be critical of Gov Ducey‚Äôs responses to COVID 19 in terms of being a model per Trump.  But the Governor has encouraged local leaders to act and not fight common sense like Gov Kemp.  And AZ has made considerable progress recently.
Team Biden. Nice try though.
Congratulations!  One suggestion: tho I'm looking forward to your debates w/ Biden, I caution you against attacking his dementia or side effects thereof as I believe that would bring ppl to his defense. Pls. stick to the issues. There are many legit ones to show you in top form.
Obama/Biden separated upwards of 38,000 persons, built &amp; housed children in the cages the MSM &amp;lying filthy Dems ascribed to  PresTrump, whose facilities are clean, w/schooling, recreation, medical help, etc.  Also, Obama/Biden never re-did immigration laws as promised.
I hope Biden does choose Rice.  The Professional Liar in Chief has lots of filthy baggage. She'll help him lose.
Biden has always been a racist. He said the "n" word at least 13 times in a Senate speech, was good friends w/ KKKByrd, fought against school integration, initiated the 1994 Crime bill, is a racist "jokester," --just an awful person who now pretends to be Blacks' best friend. Ha!
Why don't you get Biden to explain?!
Big Pharma and the Biden campaign DO NOT support this type of messaging...please stop...
Because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for Trump‚Äù does not equal ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting for Biden,‚Äù as you know full well. Don‚Äôt be disingenuous, it‚Äôs tiring.
My wife read me the tweet and I said "He's talking to Biden like he talks to Nicole Grigg."We'll see how that works out for them. They thought the same thing when Obama became president and look what a great job of helping the blacks out  he was. He was always pointing out black this black that just like Biden, they act as if blacks can't think for themselves.

So Biden's going to win, because everyone likes BJs? This poll can't be right, can it?
This is what Google says ! Bernie Sanders tweeted support for the pic. Don't buy the hype !
Still would be voting for Biden. I think Harris would be a great voice for the criminal justice reform. I'd prefer a President Booker and or a President Sanders. But I really don't want a 4 year term of Trump..
I love this pick. I‚Äôve been a Kamala fan for a long time. She will eviscerate Pence in a debate. She will be the fighter that Biden needs.  #BidenHarris2020

Joe Biden is not thinking about anything.
Yes, criticize. Still not an excuse for not voting for Biden. I‚Äôm a huge AOC fan. I wanted Warren to be the candidate. But the Bernie supporters in 2016 who were sure as hell not supporting Hillary are a big reason we have Trump now.  Zero respect. Plenty of disdain.
I guess I can nitpick about the word ‚Äúupset.‚Äù  If anyone (leftist or not) chooses not to vote for Biden/Harris, they are implicitly stating their willingness to let Trump win. Anyone who considers that acceptable is, in my opinion, part of the problem.
Don‚Äôt take this as anything near an endorsement of Biden. I just take the converse as an indictment of my family. I can‚Äôt let my family die, and it would ruin the perspective of a lot of people if this movement allowed that, because it‚Äôs not just me.

I just did it, it defaults to  and is a fundraiser.  Biden is openly tied to BLM?  Too bad we don't have a MSM to talk about that.
Well so here we are, we have a Prez candidate that hides in the basement and cognitive powers are under suspicion.  He can't pronounce his running mate's first name. Biden says DJT is soft on terrorism, but his Admin gave Iran 1.5 Billion dollars. DJT took out Sulimani and ISIS.

I'd ultimately rather have Biden, but it's like picking between a Tankie and a Nazi; one is slightly worse than the other.

If you're in a swing state, then you should vote Biden. If you're in a firmly blue state, I'd argue that you should vote third party.
We'll go backwards either damn way, dude. Total stagnation isn't enough anymore, and if Biden doesn't push actually decent progressive policies during his presidency, then we'll prolly be left with a Cotton or Carlson presidency in 2024, both of which are worse than Orange Man.

And joe Biden has a brain injury. Lol
Kamala Harris relentlessly ripped into Joe Biden during the debates especially early on. I'm sure Trump will try to seize on that. Not saying it will be successful, just pointing it out.
apparently, Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris, who is among other things a black woman as his running mate.  just get prepared for the takes you'd see on this from AA, from the fact that she is light skinned to the theory that Biden may be condescending.
Or, it shows just how far one party is willing to go to get the black vote, the vagina vote, and the "woke" white vote.   Most folks look at policies, performance, and results. Biden and Harris don't win that category ü§∑  #KAG2020

"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Yup, she would have been great for that as well, but she was my first choice for VP.   Unlike tRump though, Biden would never force her to do two jobs to show she is half-assed at both, when only part time at both!
Slow Joe Biden and Heels Up Harris.  Make no mistake, this is Harris running for President, Biden is in no shape to be Commander in Chief!

Why people are arguing about this is crazy to me. I would be very leery about picking a person who has never been elected and making them the next in line. Awful idea. But as a leftwing guy I can imagine she‚Äôd be less formidable in a primary in 2024 or 2028 depending on Biden.
I will be extremely upset if it‚Äôs Susan Rice. She has never held office nor run a political campaign. The person Joe Biden picks for VP will in all likelihood run for president in 2024. We need somebody who can do that and I don‚Äôt think Susan Rice qualifies
President told Obama and Biden that he knows everything they have attempted to do to him and he will bring them both down!
Gotta love it. So based on the latest coming out of who knows where, if Biden wins we can blame China! Seems some people will believe anything!

Glenn Beck is correct....China OWNS the bidens.  If biden is elected....china will own America. jobs lost......Freedom lost.
biden will give china anything they want......china will own America if biden is elected.  Trump does NOT let china get away with screwing America....Trump is tough on china. biden would give away our Freedom.

I think Biden winning the election could trigger Trump to start a coup, that's why I think Biden's the accelerationist candidate. I could be wrong, and wouldn't be sad if I was.  Other than that, Biden and Trump are both part of the problem. One's just more acerbic.
My conscience precludes voting for Trump. Biden is, at best, a slower burn leading to the same explosion. Third party is vainly waving a flag saying "fuck you" to an establishment that doesn't hear me.
Do you believe Biden choosing Harris actually helps him or hurts his chances of winning?
That‚Äôs kind of the thing: Biden may be the accelerationist vote. If he wins Trump may do everything possible, including seizing power to hold onto office. If Trump wins, no Trump coup, Trump has a harder time not standing down in 2028. This is pure rumination.

The Libs will be complaining about the protests but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna matter to the protestors. Biden/Harris aren‚Äôt going to have any more luck putting down protests than Trump did, and if they try to escalate the level of force that‚Äôll just end badly.

No it should be based on who is best qualified to assume the Presidency. Especially for Biden.
No, it won't be. Biden doesn't want someone strong who will challenge him when he does something questionable. He wants someone who will stand in the background smiling and looking pretty, not someone with ideas and opinions.

Just as Democratic Presidential candidate, Joe Biden made his big announcement of Kamala Harris as his Vice President-elect, VP Mike Pence was landing in Tucson.  AZ Dems claim the VP is distracting from President Trump's "reckless coronavirus response."
No, she called him a rapist.
I think now that Kamala is on the ticket Trump doesn‚Äôt make it to November. He was waiting to see if Biden would pick Whitmer thereby potentially weakening the black vote. Now he‚Äôll plan his exit strategy so he can get his pardon from Pence.
Does she still believe that  sexually assaulted and harassed women?

My take is he'll go with Rice. She's been part of the Obama-Biden team for a while know and her only flaw is Benghazi (not her fault). The Pod Bros (PSA) are already doing damage control for her. Add that Kamala was a cop and you can see it's rice.   Either one's a bad choice.

Ok we need to get out and vote we need to support the post office. We need a win #Biden/Harris2020
It does not matter who the president was in this pandemic. If you need to blame somebody you need to blame China. If Hillary Clinton was President there be two million people dead. Biden called him xenophobic for stop and travel from China. Remember that?

That should disqualify Biden completely for consideration but instead he is the Democratic candidate.  Insane.
Trump has not violated the constitution- he is systematically returning control back to the people, rather than the corrupt career politicians.   Example - how can You not objectively have an issue with what Biden and his son did/are doing to Ukraine?

Well, everything we KNOW FOR SURE about Trump is worse than anything they can make up about Biden or Harris.

Because they know she can‚Äôt be president and if Biden wins and steps down, Pelosi becomes President. Heels Up Harris is an Anchor Baby.
If the chump has made it this long I personally don't believe there is any reason a person can't be president right now in this country. I am hoping we have learned and implement something to prevent this situation in the future. Joe Biden/Kamala Harris will guide us to health.

The Democrats should ask Biden to step down for his own good and the good of their party. Who should replace him? I guess  He got the 2nd most votes and he could stand toe to toe with Trump in a debate.  But Dems: Please spare Joe Biden any more humiliation. 8/8
Biden looks weak, sometimes even physically weak. I hate to see it. I'm serious.  The man that was vice president could have challenged Trump. The man stuck in his basement and struggling in interviews cannot.  He won't last four years. 4/8
There is obviously something wrong with Biden.  His mind just isn't where it used to be.  His memory and his cognition are failing.  He doesn't seem to be able to talk very long without a prompter either in front of, or behind, the camera. 3/8
But Biden picked a VP and it looks like the Democrats are going through with this. I wish they wouldn't. 2/8
I honestly thought Joe Biden wouldn't be the nominee, even after he won the primaries. I thought the Democrats would keep him from embarrassment and shame. I don't like seeing people humiliated. 1/8
Kamala, are you planning to defund the police, give tax payer funded abortions (you and Biden are hypocrites to your faith, raise taxes on the middle class, give more tax dollars to Iran like Obama and Biden.  How about trading terrorists for traitors like Bergdahl.

Biden chose a strong woman and that scares the bejesus out of Trump
When and if there is a presidential debate I am hoping to see it moderated on OANN. Forget fox news. There would be a good chance Donna Brazille would give the questions to Biden. Not that he could remember them.
Yes, we do. We went Biden early on &amp; never wavered. True #KHive also said we'd vote Biden regardless of VP. We are overjoyed it's our beloved #Queen , but support for Joe was never conditional.
Funny. New anti- ad playing in AZ saying how Biden is against opening schools right now. It‚Äôs supposed to make you mad but just made me happy. So your saying Biden doesn‚Äôt want people to die, and somehow that‚Äôs a bad thing? So much for Republicans being pro-life
Sigh. Looks to me like the Biden accounts with 10 followers are much more prevalent
Amazing how this imbecile is putting VP debates up on a pedestal since in the entire history of VP debates...No one gives a crap about VP's...until 2020 as Biden sleeps in the basement. How pathetic Bill Kristol's transformation has become.

Yes, criticize. Still not an excuse for not voting for Biden. I‚Äôm a huge AOC fan. I wanted Warren to be the candidate. But the Bernie supporters in 2016 who were sure as hell not supporting Hillary are a big reason we have Trump now.  Zero respect. Plenty of disdain.
About as much as Biden
I guess I can nitpick about the word ‚Äúupset.‚Äù  If anyone (leftist or not) chooses not to vote for Biden/Harris, they are implicitly stating their willingness to let Trump win. Anyone who considers that acceptable is, in my opinion, part of the problem.
Don‚Äôt take this as anything near an endorsement of Biden. I just take the converse as an indictment of my family. I can‚Äôt let my family die, and it would ruin the perspective of a lot of people if this movement allowed that, because it‚Äôs not just me.
You Still For Heels Up Harris and Racist Biden?

Biden talking about Trump's racist rhetoric is about as rich as it gets.  And now it's the 'very fine people on both sides' lie.  He's just another shithead politician who enriched himself at your expense while gleefully shipping your jobs overseas.

With Biden and Harris, you know what you‚Äôre getting. Ideas brought forth by Sanders, by Yang, by AOC are in the either. We will get there soon. However, it needs to be in steps.
In politics... you are NEVER going to get what you want. So stop bitching. It is a game of compromise. When you don‚Äôt get compromise, you get Trump, and a country in total disarray. Am I happy with Biden, no, but I know he is the correct direction. We can get back on track.
Biden is acting. just like out of the sopranos pretending to lose his mind to avoid prison
I'm not making a case not to vote for Biden, I'm making a case for him to actually adopt decent policies.
Trump, before your Dems made Covid happen but thats for another day, the economy was great, unemployment was at 50 yr.low among many things Trump did well. What have Dems done? Attack trump for 4 years. Class act. Lied about Russia, Quid quo Pro? And Biden gets away with it? 1/2
I hope, but I fear that Trump losing and a Biden presidency will somehow lead to Carlson or Cotton winning in 2024 using the same tactics trump's been using.

I'd ultimately rather have Biden, but it's like picking between a Tankie and a Nazi; one is slightly worse than the other.

Yesss But we have a right üò¢to our ‚ÄúRighteous Anger‚Äù I‚Äôm upset b/c of the lies and political theater ü§®. Don‚Äôt play us!!! I feel Biden played Warren and wasted our time!!When you play Warren you play us!!
Interesting perspective  Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election  #FoxBusiness
PHOTO: Joe Biden Needed A Script to Understand Why His Handlers Chose Kamala Harris
I find it interesting that Biden, who supported segregation, picked a running mate related to a slave owner of Irish slaves.
That's a very uneducated take. For one there's a video of Yang saying "I don't get a fuck about a spot in the Joe Biden administration." And Yang has publicly stated he would run against Biden in 2024 either as a Dem or independent.
Either Kamala lied about believing Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers &amp; used those women for a political jab or she did believe them &amp; decided to ignore them to be try and become Vice President.   Neither one of these actions demonstrate the morality Democrats claim to have the high ground on.
Biden/Harris  =  HAND ON, HEELS UP
Shaun King tweets 99% chance he'll never vote for Biden or Kamala, 2 years later he gushes profusely  via
Dear Mr. President a coronavirus vaccine my Election Day still won‚Äôt get you my vote.  Biden/Harris 2020!
Harris was the safest VP choice for Biden to make.
Totally "made up" üëçüëç
Joe Biden, who‚Äôs that guy
I was upset by the letters from Black professionals also. What happened?? Was Biden going to choose Warren or Whitmer?&amp; the Black Community found out?? I‚Äôm sure Corporate America weighed in on Warren and Biden caved once again ‚ÄºÔ∏è
I want you to know üßêEvery Black person is not excited about this pick. Warren is my champion and I‚Äôm upset b/c I feel Biden played Warren. Biden knew Kamala for yrs, and she worked with Biden‚Äôs favorite deceased son. Biden knew who he was picking. Political Theater.
Are you sure, With the support of many moderate republicans that are going to vote for biden in a way to kick out trump of the white house.
Sun City West, Arizona in what was once the bastion of Republicans has loads of Biden signs everywhere. It is quite a warm feeling to behold and hoping my state is responsible for overturning the tables at The White House.
That's all fine and dandy, but which of Biden's policies do you prefer over Trump's?
LMAO. The dumbest thing I saw on the internet this year. Who is afraid of Biden? Besides little girls and former staffers. Oh but I forgot MeToo and Trust all women not for libtards.
Yes, because a single mail truck, containing, let‚Äôs say 100 ballots (being generous), with a poll expected (again being generous) 55 votes Biden, 44 votes Trump, 1 other would do anything in moving the vote anywhere.  Think.
Is this the face she makes when she locks up black men then suppresses evidence that would free them? Perfect VP for a crook rapist like Biden. Oh yeah me too and trust all women not vs. Libtards

All Black people are not excited about this pic. Warren is my champion and Biden played her. Biden knew Kamala b/c she worked closely and was friends with Biden‚Äôs favorite son who passed from brain cancer. I say he made his decision a long time ago. Political theater..
harris wasnt picked because she is best for America, she was picked because she IS NOT WHITE.  democrats further divide America in racial issues.  kamala bashed biden for being a sexual predator.....now she is ok with him being a sexual predator...NOT GOOD FOR AMERICA
Biden/Harris!!!! Let‚Äôs go
Fuck  who in 2020 thinks it‚Äôs the duty of the peasant to blindly please the king - it‚Äôs not. Joe Biden isn‚Äôt entitled to shit. He needs to earn our votes and between choosing a cop as VP and doubling down on no #M4A, he‚Äôs actively pushing away voters.
Biden didn‚Äôt pick a black woman for me ?ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI‚Äôm disappointed üòî Warren is my Champion and I feel Biden played her during the veepstakes. Biden is full of Shitttt!! I didn‚Äôt vote for President Obama b/c he was Black!!!
It is Historic, No Doubt, but Harris called Biden a racist and now she is on the ticket?!?! Harris is not a moderate and is a bad pick!!!!

It was predictably grotesque. AZ Central: Biden proves Ducey has gone 'noseblind' to Trump
Bass would've been a very bad choice.  I dont beleive Biden seriously considered.  rather I beleive that certain elements wanted her.  out of respect Dodd faux championed her.  cant imaging that would've been choice ...
I understand it's historic but I was turned off by the letters demanding Biden choose a Black Woman. Come on ü§®. Was he going to choose Whitmer or Warren?? I‚Äôm going to vote for the ticket but don‚Äôt ask me to do Shitttt else. I didn‚Äôt vote for President Obama bc colorüò§

If Biden manages to win, and we take the senate and keep the house, I would like Nancy retired for this dereliction of duty.
Biden lost my vote for his role in getting us into Iraq war.  He double lost it for not being smart enough to push for Medicare for all in pandemic

Amazing to me that the DNC is still pandering to moderate Conservatives, who will never vote Democrat, as though Biden somehow has more clout and insider connections than Hillary fucking Clinton.
Biden/Harris supporters are stupid
If we had a real media in this country they would be as outraged over the fact that Joe Biden has consistently refused to answer questions as they are about people mispronouncing Kamala Harris‚Äô name.
And still no Biden signs...
Biden wants to know who Snowden is... Lol......
Drew is right! Beijing Biden ran for President in 1988 and again 2008. That‚Äôs where he got his nickname 1% Joe. He never got more than 1% of the votes either time. 2% Harris is with him now.
It‚Äôs funny how dems don‚Äôt see the polls running parallel to what the were in 2016. Polls that they were running claiming that Hillary was winning everywhere, when in fact she was losing badly everywhere. Biden is running the same as Hillary was back then. üëçüèª TRUMP WINS BIGLY!
Beijing Biden has made it clear he will mandate illegal aliens are covered in his healthcare mandate. Couple that with open borders and joy wood is right!
You mean Biden? Cuz Biden is a predator...
People, Biden has nothing to say.  Harris and her public record along with failed presidential run speaks for itself.  Dangerous duo that will appeal to uninformed lemmings and illegal migrants.
You‚Äôre missing the point like you demolition rats did in 2016. Send us video of 20 people let alone 2000 people gathering anywhere in this country today to support 1% Beijing Biden and 2% Harris. We will wait................./
This is insane!  Biden has a lot of questions to answer!  Hunter, Tara Reid and others.
Biden Did Nothing.
My go-to is to minimize possible harm in the short term, so my instinct is to vote for Biden. But I‚Äôve heard convincing, coherent arguments for either path.
I hear what ur saying and I definitely understand your anger. And if you don‚Äôt want to vote Biden then by all means don‚Äôt. But I know people who got healthcare thanks to the Medicaid expansion and that was the aca so if even one person gets healthcare cuz of Biden it‚Äôs worth it.
Weighing all the minutiae that generate from taking either risk presents a plethora of questions like that. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still undecided, and don‚Äôt see transparent moral or logical failings in either leftists voting for Biden or leftists abstaining.
We know Biden can‚Äôt complete a sentence and Kamala just doesn‚Äôt make sense with her crazy rhetoric that only benefits rich politicians living in mansions somewhere
Biden wants to kill jobs and raise taxes. He‚Äôs not hiding it.

So Biden is racist? Lol. Nice argument

This makes zero sense. You‚Äôre describing something occurring in Trump‚Äôs USA, not Biden‚Äôs.   If anything Biden‚Äôs election would cause riots in Republican strongholds but I‚Äôm guessing this might be a little too complex for you.
Oh boy....popping up to support the wrong side...I'll pour you a glass of wine and we can discuss what's wrong with the Biden/Harris ticket.
We can't stop good trouble.  It's needed more then ever now. The line has been delineated between good and evil.  Biden and trump.
Biden does that already
LOL! Do you mean votes that biden/harris never had? Ridiculous.
One easy way to see that enthusiasm doesn't equate to votes is to look at Democratic primaries. Bernie Sanders definitely had more enthusiasm. He had much larger crowds than Biden. But Biden still won. Enthusiasm doesn't mean you are going to win.
Clinton won by ~+14, so this looks consistent with the Biden +7-8 national that we keep seeing
Facts matter, truth Is truth no subjectivity here. Biden made himself clear so did Harris.
Trump is running for president, too, sweetheart. Biden has never been accused of anything besides being an affectionate uncle.   You're in a cult. Cults are for the weak minded.   You are no longer worth my time.
But I don't think it matters. I think Biden will get the votes from people that are un enthusiastic about him. Trump has Trumpist cult members who are going to be the most enthusiastic supporters. I concede That's 30% of America. But that won't win the election
Everyone know Biden &amp; Harris are incompetents. This shows your true colors.

She is the reason Kamala is the VP choice. If Biden wins he will step as side or be removed and Clinton will be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù as the vp for harris. You and every other democrat will be the reason too. Maybe that blows wind up your ass idk but Trump won bc Hillary sucks realize that
They are going on all over. Maybe there is no parade yet for Biden/Harris because BLMO and AntiFa haven't stolen enough boats?
Taylor sings about what wrong choices she has made in men. Biden will be next on her shit list!!!
And by the way, NOT accused doesn't mean Biden did it, but boy do you people love to spread that shit around about him, don't you? Hypocrite much?
Only one candidate is accused of raping a child. Spoiler alert: it's not Biden. Don't pretend you care about sexual assault, or men who walk in on naked teenagers brag about it to Howard Stern (easy to find interview), because you clearly don't. Which troll farm do you work at?
After doing that, suppose you are forced to choose who would have sole responsibility to take care of a newborn baby for 24 hours, Biden or Trump (neither one is allowed any assistance, including from their running mates).
A little thought experiment.  Watch this (short) clip of Biden  and then watch any clip of Trump speaking recently (even where he is facing combative and hostile reporters, which is of course nearly all the time).
If U wanted to move the country more to the left why the FUCK did you nominate Biden???? Why the FUCK are you letting HRC, Bloomberg and fucking Kasich speak at the conv? It's laughable you think we are "in your way" it's the fucking  preventing the country from moving left!
What America needs now is a reporter with Jim Acosta's energy to ask Joe Biden some questions after he speaks.

Biden and Harris will get it done. Till then more are going to die.
- have you looked into this? Biden seriously looks like he is exhibiting tardive dyskinesia. A friend with 40 years nursing experience taking care of elderly totally agrees.
The virus was paid for by Democrats with a promise to remove TRUMP from office at all costs and get back to bowing to RED CHINA. Biden will do that. TRUMP will make their existence miserable. BUT we need the HOUSE &amp; SENATE RED to make having TRUMP even stronger for AMERICA

Biden doesn't count; he has dementia. His conservative handlers will be running the show, just like Trump (also has dementia) Even though his wife stopped speaking for him, we know the real score, unless we're too cult driven. #indoctrinated

I know you despise Trump. But, why would you care about the Dem convention? The DNC shafted their voters two pres. primaries in a row. They handed it 2 Hillary in 16. Now after Biden supposedly won the nom, they're going to slide Kamala in after the inauguration.
If you vote for Biden your taxes will go up the Democrats have already promised that.  How do you think they are going to pay for all the free stuff they are going to give away?  The stock market will crash to Obama levels or lower.

U.S. Intelligence Says Republicans Are Working With Russia to Reelect Trump
To all the libs excoriating leftists for not wanting to vote for Biden: you idiots, how could anyone ever get it so wrong. üòâ
Haha. You're just spewing right wing talking points. A front for progressive agenda? That's just a way to paint Biden as a radical when it's really hard. You have to find a way to do this. So you say he's a Trojan horse. It's a tactic because a moderate would snatch Republicans
Based on decades of calculated &amp; self-aggrandizing opportunism between Biden &amp; Harris, it is easy to deduce that both have replaced a typical moral worldview with a religious adherence to an amoral, hedonistic, and ever subjective leftist doctrine. Disconcerting to say the least.
Have you ever scrolled through replies to Biden tweets? Some of the dumbest, most brainwashed people on the internet are super stoked for a mentally deficient old rich white pedo and a communist hag to restore honor and end corruption. Dear God, #TheGreatAwaking is coming.

I guarantee Trump will NEVER go to prison.  He will resign &amp; Pence will pardon him. HELL, Biden would pardon him in a minute!! NONE of these politicians want to open that Pandora's box. THEY ALL BELONG BEHIND bars, but there are two justice systems in the US. Ours and their.

Biden can't/won't have a rally,  this mask wearing is his subliminal rally.
Strange who Trump likes to claim isn‚Äôt a real American. Barrack Obama, Michelle Obama, and now Kamala Harris. No question if Biden was born in the US though? Hmm, I wonder why. I can‚Äôt qwhite put my finger on it.

Have you heard Trump speak lately? Biden has a speech impediment that he's been dealing with his whole life. What's TRUMP'S excuse?
You do this and split the vote from Biden so Trump can win then you gonna have a lot of bad energy being directed at you. Another 4 years of unchecked racism from Trump because of Kanye, you gonna leave that kind of legacy for your kids?
Lol. This is the 3rd time Biden has ran for President.  He got his nickname 1% joe because he only got 1% of the vote the last time he ran for President. Harris only got 2% of the Democrat vote when she just ran for president. You‚Äôre welcome!

Very interesting approach.  However. Trump specifically says that if we vote for him he will solve the crime. Also Trump has said and ran television ads stating Biden's America will lead to more gun murders and violence in states. So which is it? You can't have both.

Agreed! Trump is far from perfect, but he's done so much good for this country too.  A vote for Biden / Harris is to cut off your nose to spite your face. Do you hate Trump enough to vote for the destruction of America?
Joe Biden is gonna win. Trump will lose by a landslide.

Dude, you posted the same article twice. I‚Äôve responded with memes showing my support for Biden because this is getting boring and you‚Äôre just flooding the field with BS. Now you want to segue to Obama? Who are you trying to impress?
And, I love Joe's ads that indicate he ran the successful recovery act. Remember the Obama-Biden recovery? Those who could find jobs, usually had to take on 2 to 3 part time jobs just to survive. NOW that's a recovery?

The most fundamental difference between Trump &amp; Biden?  When Trump‚Äôs interests conflict with the nation‚Äôs interests, he serves himself above all else. He will gladly see every institution, every intelligence agency burn to the ground if he could win.

Let me walk through what happens if/when Biden wins; more lethal austerity for working people, more fracking, more police violence against protesters, probably another coup in Venezuela/Bolivia, definitely TPP, liberals go back to brunch and not thinking about politics.

You‚Äôre missing the point like you demolition rats did in 2016. Send us video of 20 people let alone 2000 people gathering anywhere in this country today to support 1% Beijing Biden and 2% Harris. We will wait................./
This is insane!  Biden has a lot of questions to answer!  Hunter, Tara Reid and others.
Biden Did Nothing.
My go-to is to minimize possible harm in the short term, so my instinct is to vote for Biden. But I‚Äôve heard convincing, coherent arguments for either path.
I hear what ur saying and I definitely understand your anger. And if you don‚Äôt want to vote Biden then by all means don‚Äôt. But I know people who got healthcare thanks to the Medicaid expansion and that was the aca so if even one person gets healthcare cuz of Biden it‚Äôs worth it.
Weighing all the minutiae that generate from taking either risk presents a plethora of questions like that. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still undecided, and don‚Äôt see transparent moral or logical failings in either leftists voting for Biden or leftists abstaining.
We know Biden can‚Äôt complete a sentence and Kamala just doesn‚Äôt make sense with her crazy rhetoric that only benefits rich politicians living in mansions somewhere
Biden wants to kill jobs and raise taxes. He‚Äôs not hiding it.

I just see Trump roast Biden over every single thing. But never mentions the fact that Biden let's kids rub his leg hair and sniffs them like a freaky sex predator. Kinda seems to me, Trump doesn't wanna go there.
So Biden is racist? Lol. Nice argument

This makes zero sense. You‚Äôre describing something occurring in Trump‚Äôs USA, not Biden‚Äôs.   If anything Biden‚Äôs election would cause riots in Republican strongholds but I‚Äôm guessing this might be a little too complex for you.
Oh boy....popping up to support the wrong side...I'll pour you a glass of wine and we can discuss what's wrong with the Biden/Harris ticket.
We can't stop good trouble.  It's needed more then ever now. The line has been delineated between good and evil.  Biden and trump.
Biden does that already
LOL! Do you mean votes that biden/harris never had? Ridiculous.
One easy way to see that enthusiasm doesn't equate to votes is to look at Democratic primaries. Bernie Sanders definitely had more enthusiasm. He had much larger crowds than Biden. But Biden still won. Enthusiasm doesn't mean you are going to win.
Clinton won by ~+14, so this looks consistent with the Biden +7-8 national that we keep seeing
Facts matter, truth Is truth no subjectivity here. Biden made himself clear so did Harris.
Trump is running for president, too, sweetheart. Biden has never been accused of anything besides being an affectionate uncle.   You're in a cult. Cults are for the weak minded.   You are no longer worth my time.
But I don't think it matters. I think Biden will get the votes from people that are un enthusiastic about him. Trump has Trumpist cult members who are going to be the most enthusiastic supporters. I concede That's 30% of America. But that won't win the election
Not if the person supports Trump. Or isn‚Äôt voting for Biden. Apart from that, I‚Äôm very open minded!
Everyone know Biden &amp; Harris are incompetents. This shows your true colors.

Taylor swift sings songs about all the wrong choices she has made in choosing men in her life..be ready for a hit (don‚Äôt know how you can listen to a thirty year old who sounds like a 8 year old with no talent),about sleepy joe Biden! Another bad choice Taylor! No taste in men!!
She is the reason Kamala is the VP choice. If Biden wins he will step as side or be removed and Clinton will be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù as the vp for harris. You and every other democrat will be the reason too. Maybe that blows wind up your ass idk but Trump won bc Hillary sucks realize that
They are going on all over. Maybe there is no parade yet for Biden/Harris because BLMO and AntiFa haven't stolen enough boats?
Taylor sings about what wrong choices she has made in men. Biden will be next on her shit list!!!
And by the way, NOT accused doesn't mean Biden did it, but boy do you people love to spread that shit around about him, don't you? Hypocrite much?
Only one candidate is accused of raping a child. Spoiler alert: it's not Biden. Don't pretend you care about sexual assault, or men who walk in on naked teenagers brag about it to Howard Stern (easy to find interview), because you clearly don't. Which troll farm do you work at?
After doing that, suppose you are forced to choose who would have sole responsibility to take care of a newborn baby for 24 hours, Biden or Trump (neither one is allowed any assistance, including from their running mates).
A little thought experiment.  Watch this (short) clip of Biden  and then watch any clip of Trump speaking recently (even where he is facing combative and hostile reporters, which is of course nearly all the time).
If U wanted to move the country more to the left why the FUCK did you nominate Biden???? Why the FUCK are you letting HRC, Bloomberg and fucking Kasich speak at the conv? It's laughable you think we are "in your way" it's the fucking  preventing the country from moving left!
What America needs now is a reporter with Jim Acosta's energy to ask Joe Biden some questions after he speaks.

Biden and Harris will get it done. Till then more are going to die.

Based on decades of calculated &amp; self-aggrandizing opportunism between Biden &amp; Harris, it is easy to deduce that both have replaced a typical moral worldview with a religious adherence to an amoral, hedonistic, and ever subjective leftist doctrine. Disconcerting to say the least.

And, I love Joe's ads that indicate he ran the successful recovery act. Remember the Obama-Biden recovery? Those who could find jobs, usually had to take on 2 to 3 part time jobs just to survive. NOW that's a recovery?

Good God...the only thing Biden has going for him is bloviating political rhetoric...
You want Russia to rip us off Biden will beat you like a drum and your ego will really be deflated &amp; you are trying to rig the election w/ no funding usps
I think Biden would be a perfect fit.
I was hoping &amp; praying that Joe Biden would choose you, for his running mate.  We need to STOP Trump, from harming America anymore than he already has!!!!!  Thank you, for being you!!!!!!!  You are a real asset to America and to the Vice President.

trump is the best option right now tbh. he‚Äôs on a roll with the new peace treaty w israel and that‚Äôs a huge deal. biden is too corrupt to take control and would plummet this country to the ground. that‚Äôs my opinion though...
You are spewing a series of disproven headlines.  Biden / Harris will Mark the end of the Republic... their loyalties are not with the American people.  I cannot accept that.
New York State‚Äôs Attorney General Letitia James Will Deliver Justice. Inmate Donald Trump, January 20, 2020!!!   President Joe Biden November 3, 2020.
This is exactly why people who say Trump and Biden are the same are completely wrong.
Trent Lott had to resign for bragging that he supported Strom Thurmond. Biden befriended Thurmond and is the nominee of the Democratic Party for President of the United States. Let that sink in.

Speaking of Hunter....WHAT ever happened to the whole Ukrainian Biden story? It just disappeared.
Joe Biden¬†said in an interview Wednesday that some funding should ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be redirected from police, amid calls from some in his party to "defund the police" in the¬†wake of the protests¬†across the country.
This  defunding bullshit is surreal, as it is.  But then, coming this fall: The DOJ (i.e. Bill Barr) releases some bullshit about Biden in attempt to delegitimize Biden as a candidate.  It will be framed so any denial by Biden or Dems will only appear suspect.  That's a coup
That should disqualify Biden completely for consideration but instead he is the Democratic candidate.  Insane.
‚Äú‚Å¶ is the diet cola, the light beer of presidential candidates.‚Äù  ‚Å¶  #TWGRPS
Trump has not violated the constitution- he is systematically returning control back to the people, rather than the corrupt career politicians.   Example - how can You not objectively have an issue with what Biden and his son did/are doing to Ukraine?
Biden said he would sign it if it comes with a solid funding plan.   He is just not campaigning on it.   To win a general, can't be too specific. There are groups that like their current coverage. Kaiser, Culinary Workers, Tricare...

Biden‚Äôs only chance of winning
But Biden is ahead??  Lmfao.    Clowns.
The most fundamental difference between Trump &amp; Biden?  When Trump‚Äôs interests conflict with the nation‚Äôs interests, he serves himself above all else. He will gladly see every institution, every intelligence agency burn to the ground if he could win.
"If she weren't my daughter, I would date her."  Biden didn't say that about his daughter.  That was Trump.  Biden's never paid hush money to a call girl.  That was Trump.  Biden doesn't have over 20 women accusing him of sexual assault.  That's Trump.
Let me walk through what happens if/when Biden wins; more lethal austerity for working people, more fracking, more police violence against protesters, probably another coup in Venezuela/Bolivia, definitely TPP, liberals go back to brunch and not thinking about politics.
üóë 1 headline and 2 lies.  1) Trump didn‚Äôt make up a birther lie about Kamala, he has only responded to a baiting ‚Äúreporter‚Äù who brought up a written false story about Kamala.   2) There are zero racist themes in Trumps campaign. However, you can find racist themes with Biden.

So I was thinking that Biden/Harris needs to shift there messaging to more about a ‚Äúbetter day‚Äù is on the horizon!   According to this article that type of positive messaging will be more effective with the 40% of eligible voters who are non-partisans ‚Å¶

The left is going to revolt when they find out the current condition of Joe Biden. The nomination was given to him by the DNC. There's a reason he's in the basement &amp; cannot take reporter's softball questions. He's unable to do that but the left thinks he's ready for Trump?

He is right, if Biden wins, the economy falls into a depression.

Yeah, I am bracing myself for the worst. I feel absolutely no sense of certainty that Biden will win and everything will be OK again. Our country crossed a lot of lines and keeps crossing bigger lines, who knows how far things will escalate?
I said it 4 years ago and I'llsay it again, Trump was elected due to the  'anyone but Hillary' vote. This time around, same thing is happening, only with Biden. Its like they forgot that there are more than 2 people running. We have other options. #DoYourResearch

However, one could certainly say that Joe Biden should not tout his Catholic ‚Äúfaith‚Äù when he has been spiritually separated from the Church‚Äîsince such formal heresy deprives one of the supernatural virtue of faith.
Nope! We're well past that point! If Biden's POTUS, the fascist police will cont to beat &amp; kill ppl w impunity but the diff will be them wearing pink unis in support promoting women's rights.
Your beliefs sway wherever you think the votes are. you have a history of publicly denouncing Biden saying that he‚Äôs a racist that he is a sex offender and now you‚Äôre his running mate? you laugh about your marijuana use but imprison 1500 marijuana users not dealers?
Don‚Äôt forget to return the ones you‚Äôve already removed! And tell Trump ‚Äúcheaters don‚Äôt win‚Äù, at least the 2nd time around.  Biden-Harris!!!!!

He promised he‚Äôd never cut SS or Medicare and he hasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure where you got that idea. Biden wants socialized medicine and open borders, which means an open stream of illegal aliens who want health insurance. That is unsustainable and ridiculous. Why should we pay for it?
Biden won‚Äôt abolish ICE.

It sad to think we live in such a world that people would do this without remorse while the rest of world allows it.   It is also quite annoying that Americans can be more wrapped up in Biden vs Trump than care about about how we are giving billions to that evil government.

Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical *to defeating Trump*. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.

Seriously, stop trying to sell us on how great Biden and Harris are...stop making childish threats...stop berating anyone who isn't praising the Dem ticket and instead realize there are major concerns and it will likely take protests, strikes, etc to get the progress we NEED.
That‚Äôs right: ‚Äúa vote for Biden, we must keep on hidin; vote for Trump, we‚Äôll get over the hump!‚Äù

Amazing to me that the DNC is still pandering to moderate Conservatives, who will never vote Democrat, as though Biden somehow has more clout and insider connections than Hillary fucking Clinton.
If we had a real media in this country they would be as outraged over the fact that Joe Biden has consistently refused to answer questions as they are about people mispronouncing Kamala Harris‚Äô name.
And still no Biden signs...
Joe Biden has dementia, anyone would have a brain can see that.  They are using Joe Biden to get anyone from the Democratic party on the ticket to get in the White House. They are using an elderly man and it is cruel.
I want to see Trump and Biden debate before any votes are taken.  I took care of my grandmother who had Alzheimer's, and my father who had dementia.  Joe Biden is showing signs of both of those.  I think that it is cruel that the DNC is putting him out there. It's elderly abuse!
My go-to is to minimize possible harm in the short term, so my instinct is to vote for Biden. But I‚Äôve heard convincing, coherent arguments for either path.
Weighing all the minutiae that generate from taking either risk presents a plethora of questions like that. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still undecided, and don‚Äôt see transparent moral or logical failings in either leftists voting for Biden or leftists abstaining.

I just see Trump roast Biden over every single thing. But never mentions the fact that Biden let's kids rub his leg hair and sniffs them like a freaky sex predator. Kinda seems to me, Trump doesn't wanna go there.
This makes zero sense. You‚Äôre describing something occurring in Trump‚Äôs USA, not Biden‚Äôs.   If anything Biden‚Äôs election would cause riots in Republican strongholds but I‚Äôm guessing this might be a little too complex for you.
Oh boy....popping up to support the wrong side...I'll pour you a glass of wine and we can discuss what's wrong with the Biden/Harris ticket.
One easy way to see that enthusiasm doesn't equate to votes is to look at Democratic primaries. Bernie Sanders definitely had more enthusiasm. He had much larger crowds than Biden. But Biden still won. Enthusiasm doesn't mean you are going to win.
Clinton won by ~+14, so this looks consistent with the Biden +7-8 national that we keep seeing
Facts matter, truth Is truth no subjectivity here. Biden made himself clear so did Harris.
But I don't think it matters. I think Biden will get the votes from people that are un enthusiastic about him. Trump has Trumpist cult members who are going to be the most enthusiastic supporters. I concede That's 30% of America. But that won't win the election
Not if the person supports Trump. Or isn‚Äôt voting for Biden. Apart from that, I‚Äôm very open minded!

Why does he need to?? Trump is self-destructive. Biden should continue to connect with the voters, as he has done, until the debate. AFTER the debate, the campaign should start doing weekly pressers with either #Biden or #Harris. #BidenHarris #November3rd #NovemberIsComing
Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign hats are made in America, while MAGA hats are outsourced to China.
I didn‚Äôt.  So I‚Äôm taking a leap here but I‚Äôm guessing‚Äúbig news about ONE guy we already knew about‚Äù then leftist ‚Äúlawlessness and hate‚Äù a brief Hillary Clinton segment then Biden (joe and hunter) It‚Äôs the same show nightly (just a jumbled up running order)
trump is the best option right now tbh. he‚Äôs on a roll with the new peace treaty w israel and that‚Äôs a huge deal. biden is too corrupt to take control and would plummet this country to the ground. that‚Äôs my opinion though...
You are spewing a series of disproven headlines.  Biden / Harris will Mark the end of the Republic... their loyalties are not with the American people.  I cannot accept that.
This is exactly why people who say Trump and Biden are the same are completely wrong.
Trent Lott had to resign for bragging that he supported Strom Thurmond. Biden befriended Thurmond and is the nominee of the Democratic Party for President of the United States. Let that sink in.
Yes. The ones that baffle me are "Republicans for Biden"? If you vote for Biden and the progressive left agenda you really aren't a Republican.ü§î
Joe Biden¬†said in an interview Wednesday that some funding should ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be redirected from police, amid calls from some in his party to "defund the police" in the¬†wake of the protests¬†across the country.
This  defunding bullshit is surreal, as it is.  But then, coming this fall: The DOJ (i.e. Bill Barr) releases some bullshit about Biden in attempt to delegitimize Biden as a candidate.  It will be framed so any denial by Biden or Dems will only appear suspect.  That's a coup
That should disqualify Biden completely for consideration but instead he is the Democratic candidate.  Insane.
Trump has not violated the constitution- he is systematically returning control back to the people, rather than the corrupt career politicians.   Example - how can You not objectively have an issue with what Biden and his son did/are doing to Ukraine?
Biden said he would sign it if it comes with a solid funding plan.   He is just not campaigning on it.   To win a general, can't be too specific. There are groups that like their current coverage. Kaiser, Culinary Workers, Tricare...
She was caught by the Biden suprise.
Biden isn‚Äôt currently in government. Trump is the head of the executive branch.   See the difference?   He doesn‚Äôt owe the country‚Äôs assignment editors crap.
I‚Äôm not joking, if you don‚Äôt plan on voting for Biden, unfollow me. I‚Äôm not dealing with this shit, you either want Trump to win, or you deal with the lesser of two evils. And if you choose Trump winning, I don‚Äôt want you in my life. At all. Leave.
What is this guy talking about what are they going to arrest Biden and Harris for this is getting crazy
But does Biden have the stamina to do the job?
No we kn6, it will be Joe Biden üíãüíãüíãüíãüíãüíã
She only knows what Biden is told to say.
And here is Biden's "Navy":
Alot of people prefer Joe Biden.
Well maybe she is the Biden whisperer.
Additionally there is no proof either way that Biden or Trump buys only American goods. Trump is bringing manufacturing back to the US, while Biden during his 40 plus years did nothing to stop it from moving out of our country.
Trump made comments beginning in April alleging vast fraud in vote-by-mail and that USPS ineptness contributed to it. Biden picked up on it. Not baseless then, and not baseless now.
And here is Biden's boat parade!
Biden‚Äôs only chance of winning
But Biden is ahead??  Lmfao.    Clowns.
The most fundamental difference between Trump &amp; Biden?  When Trump‚Äôs interests conflict with the nation‚Äôs interests, he serves himself above all else. He will gladly see every institution, every intelligence agency burn to the ground if he could win.
"If she weren't my daughter, I would date her."  Biden didn't say that about his daughter.  That was Trump.  Biden's never paid hush money to a call girl.  That was Trump.  Biden doesn't have over 20 women accusing him of sexual assault.  That's Trump.
üóë 1 headline and 2 lies.  1) Trump didn‚Äôt make up a birther lie about Kamala, he has only responded to a baiting ‚Äúreporter‚Äù who brought up a written false story about Kamala.   2) There are zero racist themes in Trumps campaign. However, you can find racist themes with Biden.
No shit!!! I‚Äôll have room in my car and gas in the tank.
Biden's viral bike ride video takes everyone back to Trump's feeble descent down a ramp
So I was thinking that Biden/Harris needs to shift there messaging to more about a ‚Äúbetter day‚Äù is on the horizon!   According to this article that type of positive messaging will be more effective with the 40% of eligible voters who are non-partisans ‚Å¶
I thought you hashtagged "settle for Biden"...
Biden hasn‚Äôt spewed out thousands upon thousands of flagrant lies like Donald and hasn‚Äôt called the free press the enemy of the people. And he wonders why the free press treats him differently?
The left is going to revolt when they find out the current condition of Joe Biden. The nomination was given to him by the DNC. There's a reason he's in the basement &amp; cannot take reporter's softball questions. He's unable to do that but the left thinks he's ready for Trump?
KH is at 90% approval with Dems. Higher than Biden. Log off here once in a while.

Well to be honest,  they dont like to let Biden speak anymore eitherü§£ü§£ü§£
Well it's not Biden. Sadly you've been lied to &amp; you're going to be very disappointed. Media will try to drag Biden across the finish line, but they can only go so far. It stops on Sept 26. Theres a reason Biden doesnt take questions, he cant. He has deteriorated &amp; it has been...

Meanwhile Joe Biden runs from all questions from the press.
Obviously this is all theoretical.  What a Biden win will do though is show these fuckups enough proof that they can continue to get voted in without doing anything for the American people.
This current "Trump wont leave when biden beats him" narrative is just another in the long line of what ifs designed to modify the election.  Its a lot like the toilet paper manufacturers saying are you prepared for a long lock down...

I dont support everything he says. Esp. always taking credit for stock mkt. I think a huge mistake. I wasnt aware of mistakes made by Obama/Biden during H1N1. It's prob unfair to blame them. Just like unfair to blame Trump. The entire world has suffered from this you cant blame
Wow...you are the reason so many people vote third party.  You are attacking other liberals, this doesn‚Äôt help your cause.  If Biden loses, you‚Äôll blame the same liberals that you viciously and proudly attack,  great job in helping elect Trump.  You must be proud
the biggest obstacle Kamala faces is being a female leader.  at some point chopping down is nauseating.  shes got a job to do for 100 pct.  just like Biden.  at the highest level folks need to be judged on that plane.  I foremost would like a good VP and President.
Mark Twain once said you should never trust a man who has only one way to spell a word. But as is always true, actions speak louder than words. In Trump's case he acts, Biden did nothing but, plagiarize. bluster, self aggrandize and lie, for over 40 years.

Oak Park? I would think there are a buttload of Biden supporters there.
It's funny that Biden only comments after the meeting about c-19 was wear a mask.
I would actually flip that perspective.  We got Trump as a reaction to the neglect of the working class throughout the country.  I think a Biden presidency, run on ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change,‚Äù will set the stage for an open racist like Tom cotton.
Biden the can't do man. Perfect candidate for the democrats, they are all about the can't unless it fills thier coffers, protects their agenda of evil, or furthers thier ineptitude.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden and hoping that some stronger willed person than me burns the whole restaurant to the ground. Because this place pads the bill, poisons the food, and then beats/murders you for complaining.

Lol scared of Biden? Thats just funny
You're def. not a lawyer. "Did not reveal" not "Does not have". Surely you know what happened. It's going deeper than this. The reality is it goes all the way to Comey. What is not known yet is will Comey fall on the sword to protect Obama &amp; Biden. I don't think hes man enough
This is backfiring in a huge way.   All 4 of my neighbors who are Trumpers took down their Trump signs &amp; are now going to vote for Biden.
I don‚Äôt like Biden or Harris, but this kind of stuff is unnecessary. (Funny,but unnecessary). I don‚Äôt like the Trump-trash crap either.
I like Schiff but I think this guy would be a perfect AG under Biden.   Much more aggressive and a rising political star !
To all the old heads that keep getting mad at me about my comments on Biden/Harris. I list her 4 bills she passed and ask them again what has she done to gain your support.

Very good point!! Biden wants to raise tax‚Äôs, give amnesty to 11 million illegal persons, give them free Medicare, free school free free free for anyone but an America!! We worked all our lives to get Medicare etc. it‚Äôs just not right or fair!. Biden‚Äôs in capable to hold office!!
Hmm, that's a little too much.   If I agree to be Deep State Hype Man for free, can I at least get in on a small amount of grifting?
I got dibs on Archduke of Tomfoolery
Yeah, I am bracing myself for the worst. I feel absolutely no sense of certainty that Biden will win and everything will be OK again. Our country crossed a lot of lines and keeps crossing bigger lines, who knows how far things will escalate?
I said it 4 years ago and I'llsay it again, Trump was elected due to the  'anyone but Hillary' vote. This time around, same thing is happening, only with Biden. Its like they forgot that there are more than 2 people running. We have other options. #DoYourResearch

However, one could certainly say that Joe Biden should not tout his Catholic ‚Äúfaith‚Äù when he has been spiritually separated from the Church‚Äîsince such formal heresy deprives one of the supernatural virtue of faith.
Don‚Äôt forget to return the ones you‚Äôve already removed! And tell Trump ‚Äúcheaters don‚Äôt win‚Äù, at least the 2nd time around.  Biden-Harris!!!!!
If you're willing to settle for Biden why not settle for me? üòò
Just wondering who she had to sleep with to get that nomination.  Last week, biden says' Next week I will find out who my running mate is....and it's like OOPs...and he just keeps on making his gaffes.
I would say abolish ICE, but Trump uses it as a private army and Biden helped create it, so what‚Äôs the point.

Do you understand how elections work in this country? You‚Äôre aware that Biden won the primaries in a landslide, correct? He received twice as many votes as the guy in 2nd place. Again, please, your inane whining makes no difference. It‚Äôs 2020 and I have your back and so do Dems.
Kamala Harris is going to destroy this clown in the debates. She damn near made Biden cry and he 20xs tougher than Pence.
Voting for Biden/Harris is the least I'm gonna do.  The work never stops after Nov. 3rd.
These guys and their now radical party are complete jokes, Harris dropped from the race quickly and now VP?  Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews
My FB friends seem to understand that electing Biden doesn't fix anything (other than the issue of Trump of course) and know we will have to keep up the pressure, even increase it, IF he is elected...but seeing far too many who think he is the solution.
Historian says Biden will beat Trump in November ‚Äî and he‚Äôs been right since 1984 | Opinion  via
Really not optimistic about things because I've been seeing comments like "Well, when Biden wins in November at least all the BLM protesters can finally go home." (roughly a quote and should have screencapped it)..and basically just talk about how electing Biden will fix things..
I don‚Äôt see a non-pathetic reason to vote for Biden/Harris. Lmao
Hey   ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got some explaining to do‚Äù   ... #metoo #Biden #Kamala #KamalaHarris #republican #democrat  #QuestionOfTheDay #sellout
You‚Äôre not just voting for President. Consider everything else at stake, suck it up, and vote Biden. You can be true to yourself AFTER 45 is gone. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing
The left never forgives us for our past actions. So here? "My gut reaction," Joe Biden reportedly declared in 1973, "is that they [homosexuals] are security risks [in the federal govt], but I must admit I haven't given this much thought‚Ä¶I‚Äôll be darned!‚Äô‚Äù
On the other hand, if they DO think Biden is middle-class, we‚Äôve officially solved the question of why conservatives think middle-class families should be fine financially.
Trump ad on TV: ‚ÄúJoe Biden says, ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre gonna pay more in taxes.‚Äô That means more taxes for the middle class...‚Äù Do... do Republicans think Joe Biden is middle class? (Also, lol that Republicans ‚Äî let alone Trump ‚Äî care about the middle class.)
Not any blue will do  even Biden's VP has done so much damage to so many communities. But yeah, sure back up what you say not what you do, right????
Clearly, one can be both gay and an idiot voting against his interests. Every vote not tallied for Biden is a vote for Trump and Mike Pence. If you can‚Äôt see the difference between those men I can‚Äôt help you.
Obama-Biden administration was anti-Israel and pro-Arab Muslim from get-go. O treated Netanyahu w/ huge disrespect &amp; you were NO help w/ anything. Taking credit for this is exactly like your constant lying and plagiarizing of anyone with a good idea. You are a disgrace.
Biden should appoint Warren "Empress of Fixing Shit."

So why on earth would you back up &amp; endorse Joseph Biden???
Arizona‚Äôs superintendent of public instruction Kathy Hoffman formally endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, arguing their administration would better serve Arizona public schools.
Hilarious anti Biden ad: "11 million illegal aliens competing for American jobs" and the video is farm workers. Oh so many Americans are horrified that they can't get a job working in the fields. LOL the incompetence of  and his minions. Can't even racist right.
Seriously, stop trying to sell us on how great Biden and Harris are...stop making childish threats...stop berating anyone who isn't praising the Dem ticket and instead realize there are major concerns and it will likely take protests, strikes, etc to get the progress we NEED.
And once again, if you are a "blue no matter who" type liberal, you could help your own cause by actually admitting that our choices are shitty, and pledging your support and participation in direct action even IF Biden wins in November. Too many seem to think he is the solution.
Wait a tic. I hate Kanye as much as the next person but doesn‚Äôt this mean that he ISN‚ÄôT playing Biden spoiler since he is now running against Trump?
Vote for Biden.  Seriously, tRUmp will only get much worse if he is left in office.
So, Biden is no longer "Sleepy Joe" but is now "Slow Joe".  What is most interesting and will remain with you throughout history...FOREVER...is the fact that you are Impeached Trump.
i wonder if joe biden is going to campaign in the whatthefuckican and whatthefuckicratic counties of ohio
3) ironically tankies declaring Biden ‚Äúthe Maoist‚Äôs choice‚Äù does far more to validate Trump‚Äôs attacks than anyone bring up Tara Reid every could, straight up Trump‚Äôs strategy this time around is literally just tie Biden/Harris to tankies &amp; antifa
Can you explain why our initial purpose was to #FlattenTheCurve? I think we're in week 25? And fuck you if you're doing this  bc it helps Joe Biden get elected.
I am sure these characters are going to circle file Republican votes!
If this is what real leadership looks like then real leadership is dead. Biden looks like he's dead and no one told him.
Well, this is interesting and receiving no coverage outside of FNC.  Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews
It was the topic of convo at Karen's Brunch Bunch today. It was unanimous: voting for Biden is a 'no brainer'.  The topic quickly turned to a heated discussion about which day will be more glorious: When Queen 'K' destroys Pence in  a debate or when the election is finally over.
Not for nothing, but if Mitt really wanted to rock the boat he‚Äôd switch party affiliations. His values line up more with Biden anyway.
Biden is counting on Republicans who don‚Äôt like trump. I‚Äôm pretty sure that he would rather alienate us than them.
Donald Trump actually believes the American people will actually allow and accept him stealing the election from Joe Biden and the American people. It won‚Äôt happen. It will be total civil disobedience and unrest everyday of his presidency. The bird brain has to be voted out of
On a scale from 1 to glue fiend... how deeply will Biden sniff?
In other words you can‚Äôt name a single Biden policy. If I was in your shoes I would have at least googled his platform and cut and paste something in the hope of changing someone‚Äôs mind. But of course when Sanders was running I and all of his supporters could recite his platform.
I‚Äôm 20 year old daughter who was a Bernie supporter and volunteer has informed me she will either be voting 3rd party or not at all. She doesn‚Äôt like Trump, but she doesn‚Äôt like Biden or Harris any betterü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Use common sense vote  Biden to stay alive.‚Äù And come back from the brink of death destruction authoritarianism darkness corruption criminality predator pedophile behavior
Joe Biden could walk on stage at a debate, drunk as fuck, slurring his words in a track suit and sandals promising to raise my taxes and I would STILL, without doubt, in a heartbeat, wait outside 8 hours during a pandemic to vote for him #VoteBlue

U have no equal (oh, maybe Hillary) per cheating, fraud and dishonesty. U won't shut up, U=treacherous. This is obvious projection. U cheated and tried to steal '16 to continue ur "legacy" as bad as it was. Now U wants to steal '20 for Biden so U and ur Globalist handler ...
Trump wins unless all the dead people from Covid vote for Biden.
Basically, a vote for Biden is a vote for Kamala for President.  He won't be able to complete his term.  He'll be doing good to last a few months.
You realize Biden doesn‚Äôt currently hold office in our Government right? The best thing he can do to help is getting Trump out of office so...
NY Post columnist: Kamala Harris is political 'chameleon' with eye on 'Biden's job'.   Exactly! She can‚Äôt wait to push him outta her way!
But Biden is ahead??  Lmfao.    Clowns.
Kamala is an anchor baby, if something happens to Biden she can't become President,  both parents have to be Americans! Pelosi will become President! Then again " Obummer was President,  I never believed he was an American? AMERICA WAKE UP!  WE DON'T HAVE TO LET THIS HAPPEN!
Dear Mr Biden  it is only safe and secure if you have the infrastructure to support it.  Please take the cognitive test as you need help.
KAMALA isnt even an American! She's an anchor baby! If something happens to Biden she can't legally be President! There fore the next person to be PRESIDENT is Speaker of the house! You guessed it ' Pelosi!! Does anyone see the PLOT here?
Would you still support Tulsi if she becomes a Sheepdog like Bernie for Biden/Kamala?
Stand strong , The left Dems with hurt themselves without you doing anything!! You have handled everything, the best way you could of! Dont let Haters but you down, you are amazing and WEAK Biden, cant hold a candle to you.
Never feel sorry for Joe Biden. He a criminal, lying daily, racist, crook. Prison is to good for his crimes
They better get busy. November 3rd will be here before you know it and if you didn‚Äôt have a reason to vote for Biden before you do now.

Your so full of shit! You need to read more and stop listening to Pelosi, Biden can't make decisions and Kamala is an anchor baby, In the event that the President or Vice cant do the job, the next person in line is speaker of the house! PELOSI' God help us!
...and like I (and so many)said, your hubris is laughable. Overly ambitious, not as smart as you think you are.  Knowing Biden is mush brain you want to step in and take control. The Democrat Party has become the modern Fascists and you are part of the malicious, scurrilous mob.
Why aren't you investigating interference FOR Biden by China and Iran.  Both know that Biden is weak and will do their bidding, he'll bow to them same way Obama did.
You should examine Biden's lifelong racism which he conveniently lost to become VP and an identity gp. panderer. As a typical Democrat, he projects his sins on others. He opposed school bussing, school integration and befriended KKKByde, his "mentor. He wrote1994 Criminal Act ...
Joke of the century. Obama had the SLOWEST economic recovery since the Great Depression. He/biden were a disaster for our country in EVERY way. Trump fixed it all - despite the malicious, vicious fictions you Demons devised to harass him. YOU WILL LOSE again bc you are EVIL.
‚ÄúWE‚ÄôRE NOT GOING TO LET JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS CUT AMERICAS MEAT!‚Äù   *delayed applause*
Voters who vote party lines are usually very stupid as in this case -- and especially regarding Biden/Harris, two horrors and disasters for our country.
Now do Biden.    Loser
Let's be sure to elect Biden so we can stop this Middle East peace crap.  We can't have this.
Biden can‚Äôt even put together a coherent sentence and people still gon vote for em lmao
It was Obama who built the cages and put the children into them. Obama separated 38,000 ppl.  Trump provided schooling, medical needs, recreation and nutrition for them all.  NOT Biden/Obama.  Once again you lie.
Kamala totes alot of importance on science when discussing covid, but fails to recognize she and Biden have no chemistry.
I mandate Biden goes and  himself!
True, as far as we know Biden was never on Epstein's Lolita Express.
Yup. It should be obvious to one and all that a Biden Regime will be a rehash of Clinton/Obama/Hillary.  Don't know why this came to my head thinking of Bloomberg it's not even from my era. Money ain't for nothin' Lol
Makes $cents$ to me. Larry Summers has been advising Biden which means we would be soooooo EFFED.
She is a nasty, malicious, unethical hot mess. Proven during her days as prosecutor when she now did a 180 on everything she purported to believe just to be Biden's nominee. Dread to see her as President (Biden will turn the office over to her soon should he win). BUT Joe=loser.
Harris, a hot mess, a horrendous prosecutor, very malicious/nasty senator, has done 180 on her positions to become Biden's nominee. She would be a disaster and since Biden is only a placeholder, I dread what would happen to our country if she really took the reins.  NO to Harris.

There are more Biden supporters at trump rallies protesting the great president then came out to hear a vegetable and a communist
If Biden debates President Trump, it will be done remotely. Off camera he will have people writing answers on boards or into teleprompter so he can read the answers.
TW: suicide  anyone who reads this thread and thinks that voting in a national election means nothing, i don‚Äôt get you. no way in hell you can convince me a HRC admin would have resulted in the same or that a Biden admin ‚Äúwon‚Äôt change anything.‚Äù absolutely fucking bleak.
OMG, terrible thought occurred to me. what am I gonna tweet about when Trump loses? What kind of rage-induced tweeting can I get outta Biden??
Was Biden's mangling of her name all about disrespect?  Huh?
Why is Biden allowed to lie on Twitter?  Apparently because he‚Äôs a Democrat?
She only got 3% of the primary votes and won't bring him Calif. as it's already Democrat. She is a strategically bad move for Biden with her ton of stinky baggage, but I'm delighted.  VOTE RED!
He doesn‚Äôt have to come out of his basement.  His campaign is predicated on trump being trump and basically voting himself out of office every time he opens his mouth!  Biden/Harris just sit back at laugh at the stupidity!!
Joe Biden is the only presidential candidate who was personnel friends with a Klu Klux Klan leader.
Fellow white folks, let‚Äôs talk about what Joe Biden did yesterday.   Think about it. A member of the old boys‚Äô club DELIBERATELY and VERY PUBLICLY used his position and his societal privilege to elevate a member of a marginalized population to a position she richly deserves.1/3
I just watched the Biden/Harris presser. It made me proud to be an American again. I haven't felt this way for over 3 and a half years now. As they said, it's about the soul of our country. Come on America, we can do this come November 3rd.
Mama Kamala and Uncle Joe too the rescue.                           BIDEN &amp; HARRIS WILL SAVE THE USA!!!!!!!!!!              So happy üòÅ
Biden talking about Trump's racist rhetoric is about as rich as it gets.  And now it's the 'very fine people on both sides' lie.  He's just another shithead politician who enriched himself at your expense while gleefully shipping your jobs overseas.
He advised Biden not to extend an invitation to her! So it seems even Willie has had enough of her!!
And there is an even simpler reason: Biden would absolutely not have taken someone from a Senate seat who would be replaced by a GOP governor. Warren could have checked every box and he wouldn‚Äôt risk losing the seat.
Biden wanted the minority vote so bad... as a matter fact he‚Äôs even grown a bit entitled about it. But he previously announced that it was going to be a woman. Kamala is both black and Asian so... ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

What is so interesting is that Biden didn't need her to bring in California.  Not a wise strategic move, Joe, but then nothing you've ever done has been wise.

She SOLD HER SOUL for this. Biden IS racist: opposed school integration-a "jungle," loved KKKByrd -"mentor &amp; friend," consistently made racist "jokes," surprised Obama was "clean&amp;articulate," used "n word" in Senate speeches many times, ad nauseam. Now he panders for black votes!
Joe Biden has a weird obsession with little girls ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è trump is trump Kamala a coon ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è we headed in a bad mf direction
In the 1920's Democrats were lynching, supporting KKK &amp; instituting Jim Crow. Learn your history! Republicans freed Democrats' slaves and fought for the Civil Rights laws against people like Thurmond, Byrd and yes - even Biden who opposed school integration and loved KKK Byrd.
Biden, lead us?! Ha. Your best joke yet.
Ever wonder who is running the PR campaign for the Lib looser's  Biden/Harris??? Just think, you could have had Bernie and ??? another Bernie.  Great choice Dems.
Trump/Pence win in 2020 = Zionists win.  Biden/Harris win in 2020 = Zionists win.  Either way humanity loses.
Yes, because a single mail truck, containing, let‚Äôs say 100 ballots (being generous), with a poll expected (again being generous) 55 votes Biden, 44 votes Trump, 1 other would do anything in moving the vote anywhere.  Think.
Biden has to have notes to make it through a friendly phone call.  Wow.  That's impressive.  He'll eat Putin's lunch for sure.
You know you ridin with Biden
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. You will make a great team. I‚Äôm so proud to be voting Biden/Harris 2020.
I knew about her lackluster performance when she was in Cali but I choose to hope she‚Äôs become a better person since then. I‚Äôd still prefer her and Biden over Trump and Pence
You bet we do want Biden-Harris in the White House b/c Harris is not ultra liberal. But play your little tired games of ohhhhhhhhh that‚Äôs socialism. Socialism is giving $2T tax breaks to the 1% on the backs of the middle &amp; working class, Debbie.
You've sold your soul and all principles you may have had. This is tragic. Biden is a hapless mush who once was a segregationist, a racist "jokester" and a friend of KKKByrd he calls a mentor.   Biden WILL lose and you'll go down with him.
Biden could‚Äôve picked Howdy Doodie &amp; he wouldn‚Äôt have lost my vote. Oh &amp; Black folk miss me with the argument about prosecutors, prosecuting crimes! When a criminal attacks your family you don‚Äôt see color.
I love how they paint Biden and now Harris as far left.
If I had a choice to vote for Trump, Biden or Putin I would gladly vote for my comrade Vlad.
I totally agree and understand why Kamala was picked for him.   Biden will not run for a second term IF he wins. This gives her a head start for 2024.  Most likely Joe will not finish his first term which is the only way she could ever be POTUS.

What Bull. Biden, the real racist, supported segregation, KKKByrd, and worse. He can't do or say a thing his handlers don't script for him. And you should have taken Willie's advice bc you will not help him win. You won't get near the WH.
BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
This is what Pence said in AZ "As you all know, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left," he said. "So given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand, it's no surprise that he chose Senator Harris
Umm I think she will be talking and his lips will be moving! I‚Äôm not sure how she is going to get around some of her and Biden‚Äôs difference of opinions! Such as her saying she vehemently against Fracking he said he would not approve any new permits but would not stop it.
Divine 9, salons, barbershops, black organizations, black churches, picnics, barbecues, anyone with an ounce of decency; step and support Biden/Harris.  The goal collectively should be to rid the WH of the current inhabitants!!  VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!!  IT DOES!
Biden does not remember that he was in that debate...sad
Pence will batch slap her in a debate just like she did to Biden

Biden/Harris do not support defunding the police and you know it. I‚Äôm sure you are looking forward to the Harris/Pence debate as much as America. If you continue to lie it will not go well for you at the debate. America will watch you be humiliated.
And you will Andrew. I have faith that Biden/Harris will unite the party. And the country will rally around them.
The 2020 Center Right Republican ticket is Biden/Kamala.  The 2020 Far Right Republican ticket is Trump/Pence.

23,000 LIES from the POTUS. Not one word from Trump is believed now. Unfit to lead. Go Biden. Truth matters!!!!!
Russia is so over. Trump's sanctions harsher than anything Obama/Biden did. "I'll have more flexibility after my re-election." to "Vlad."   You Democrats are hypocritical, malicious idiots.  WHY AREN'T YOU ASKING ABOUT HOW CHINA AND IRAN ARE WORKING TO ELECT BRAIN-DAMAGED BIDEN?!
America needs leadership from a President who will not try to divide us, or try to make us afraid of each other, but rather work to bring us together, to be an example that we can look up to and be proud to call our President. Trump has proven to be a divider. Biden will unite us
You think Biden could do anything? His virus "plan" was directly plagiarized from Trump's web page.  Biden's ads about American made/American jobs has been Trump's message and success for 4 years. Biden is a demented loser and you are backing the wrong horse.
...and about minorities, esp. Black ppl. Now Biden's talk is all scripted to cover up what the man actually is-a brain dead puppet. It's so obvious you are all over the place in your attempt to get revenge for being fired. You will NOT be resurrected. Biden will lose.
Trump IS expanding the Republican Party with outreach to all minorities; he will have higher black and hispanic vote counts than ever before. Biden is a proven racist: his "jokes", his friendships w/ KKK Byrd and stance against school integration, his patronizing talk to ...

My gut on the ground says its about +2 - +4 for Biden, and +6 - +10 for Kelly ...... State is hard to get a gauge on at times because the pockets that are conservative are extremely conservative
thanks,i used to be like a huge trump supporter but there‚Äôs so many things that have happened that make me question him but it‚Äôs not like biden is a much better choice. it‚Äôs a really scary time we all live in and the people who want to do the actual good will never get the chance
Murton, you need to smarten up. Pres. Trump is the BEST, most hard-working, patriotic, efficient and capable president in decades.  If you vote for dementia-challenged Biden, you've said it all.
Benghazi will be used against her.   Biden will be the bobblehead the MIC, Wall St., Zionists, War Mongers want and Rice will put muscle behind it and be the enforcer.
Biden is a lifelong racist who only "evolved" when he was made Obama's VP. He continues his racist "jokes" and alliances. He can't help himself and has made many Freudian slips during this campaign. Lewis can't change that. Trump for ALL races and religions.
Obama and Hillary will pick Susan Rice to be Biden's VP.
"Is there an equivalent on the left tearing down Trump?‚Äù Observant, aren't u? CNN wouldn't exist w/o liars &amp;propagandists for Dems/now Biden like u to string public along with your constant lies, omissions, and fictions. Look at yourself in the mirror to answer your question.UGH!
can you ride a bike?Joe is in better shape than you. Tell your conspiracy creators Joe does not need a nursing home.       Joe Fox-Trolling Mask Bike Ride Sets Twitter Ablaze
My point is this.  You were blessed to be born free and  now that‚Äôs being threatened.  Look  Portland/around you.  Don‚Äôt believe me?  Go to Fla, 90 miles So. is Cuba.  They don‚Äôt have a country. Thats why they‚Äôre fleeing. Take a look.  Vote Biden, that‚Äôs your future.
Me trying to explain how Joe Biden can win the election
Ask me again why I despise Dems as much as Repubs and why I will not vote for either one of the Israel Firsters.   Report: Biden personally intervened to get the word 'occupation' removed from the Democratic Party platform
Biden‚Äôs up 10%
Biden, lol.
My MIL accused me of brainwashing my husband into voting for Biden. Not the craziest thing she‚Äôs said about me, but it‚Äôs new, at least.
Someone PLEASE stop Biden from talking
The Dems are corrupt, too.  If it happens at all it will be a media circus and no one will actually be made accountable. I am supporting Biden and other Dem candidates but not very hopeful.
When he said this I laughed so hard. He LITERALLY insulted the black community. So much for, ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt really black if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden‚Äù
Biden‚Äôs staff apologized on his account. Joe probably doesn‚Äôt even know what he said.
Biden wnats all illegals working in America to receive free healthcare. This is after they take jobs away from a hardworking American, who doesn‚Äôt receive free healthcare.
make more you tube videos.....give your opinion on 2020 riots,BLM, trump, Biden whatever. There great
Chuck Schumer does an irrupt change in Democrats stand against school‚Äôs opening up. Now pushing hard to get teachers unions on board to open schools. The reason, if kids get sick on a large scale, President Trump will be blamed hurting him in November. Dems can‚Äôt win with Biden
Joe Biden has a plan! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Why is Biden going to church regularly when Delaware is recommending those over 65 stay away?
And Biden? Is he um...masterful!  Lol
Biden 2030. Good one
The  is amongst the greatest of God‚Äôs creations on Earth. It would be a desecration to allow uranium mining in such a sacred place. I join  in opposing uranium mining at the Grand Canyon.
THE DANGEROUS, MORONIC, IGNORANT, INCOMPETENT, INEPT, DELUSIONAL POS, NOW SAID:!!!!!  "OPEN THE SCHOOLS"!!!!!  "COVID-19 WILL JUST GO AWAY"!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
How about them Biden comments? Lol can‚Äôt condemn one without the other ü§°
Hungry Joe Biden üò±
Honestly, screw Joe Biden, he‚Äôs going to ignore progressives during his entire presidency. However, Trump is a much worse option and don‚Äôt be ignorant by voting for third party or writing in Bernie Sanders name. #voteforbiden
Meh. I‚Äôve heard that Biden can destroy God himself, so removing some extra melanin isn‚Äôt impressive.
Media watches Biden...media in full out desperation mode.
THE DANGEROUS, MORONIC, IGNORANT, INCOMPETENT, INEPT, DELUSIONAL POS, NOW SAID:!!!!!  "OPEN THE SCHOOLS"!!!!!  "COVID-19 WILL JUST GO AWAY"!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
Joe Biden is actively working to, quote, denigrate Joe Biden.
Based upon Joe's recent videos....Joe Biden is working to, quote, denigrate Joe Biden......
VP Biden you are correct to be critical of Gov Ducey‚Äôs responses to COVID 19 in terms of being a model per Trump.  But the Governor has encouraged local leaders to act and not fight common sense like Gov Kemp.  And AZ has made considerable progress recently.
Team Biden. Nice try though.
Congratulations!  One suggestion: tho I'm looking forward to your debates w/ Biden, I caution you against attacking his dementia or side effects thereof as I believe that would bring ppl to his defense. Pls. stick to the issues. There are many legit ones to show you in top form.
Obama/Biden separated upwards of 38,000 persons, built &amp; housed children in the cages the MSM &amp;lying filthy Dems ascribed to  PresTrump, whose facilities are clean, w/schooling, recreation, medical help, etc.  Also, Obama/Biden never re-did immigration laws as promised.
I hope Biden does choose Rice.  The Professional Liar in Chief has lots of filthy baggage. She'll help him lose.
Biden has always been a racist. He said the "n" word at least 13 times in a Senate speech, was good friends w/ KKKByrd, fought against school integration, initiated the 1994 Crime bill, is a racist "jokester," --just an awful person who now pretends to be Blacks' best friend. Ha!
Why don't you get Biden to explain?!
Big Pharma and the Biden campaign DO NOT support this type of messaging...please stop...
Because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for Trump‚Äù does not equal ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting for Biden,‚Äù as you know full well. Don‚Äôt be disingenuous, it‚Äôs tiring.
My wife read me the tweet and I said "He's talking to Biden like he talks to Nicole Grigg."
