Just dumb Trump supporters
We stand with you President Trump!! Thank you for all you do!!
HERE'S THE LIAR AND CHIEF GASLIGHTING HIS BASE  AGAIN ; MAKING PROMISES HE CANNOT KEEP.  WHERE'S THAT COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE PLAN YOU PROMISED TO RELEASE IN 2 WEEKS???  JUST ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.
I hope you are correct. I suspect that they may go D after Trump in 2024, maybe more traditional D, less progressive (fingers crossed)
No social distancing, hardly any masks. President Trump is an absolute joke.
How exactly does ‚ÄúTrump strive to create chaos‚Äù?  *I have a feeling this answer is going to be hilarious.
Those that opposed Obama didn‚Äôt cause chaos.   Those that oppose Trump are creating chaos.   Thanks for making my point.
I lost 60 in the last hour

Then why is the GOP and Trump false tweeting a victory on jobs an hour ago. They live in an alternate universe.
I'm reading Back to the Jungle via the The New Yorker app. It‚Äôs a story about a true human rights crisis. I wonder if somehow we could get this pushed higher on the radar during these terrible times.
This whole 'scheme' sure seems odd. It's as if they WANT Trump - 4.More.Years. ;)
I am sure she is reviewing and approving the questions right now. üôÑ We all know how Chris feels about Trump so why would we watch??
I wasnt aware that Trump was British.  Now I want to see his long form birth certificate.
Trump and Pence are fighting to block patients from getting care at Planned Parenthood health centers. help turn the tide: #IStandWithPP
Or nobody just wants to hear the bullshit you put up about Trump every day
bends over for Trump and makes no statements
Pathetic Trump supporters only tactic is character assasination.

Joe Biden will "hurt the Bible, hurt God," Trump says in Ohio of his practicing Catholic opponent. "He's against God."
By voting for tRump or any of his GOP enablers.
All of our faces will be frozen in Mr Swan‚Äôs expression if tRump wins re-election.  #RidinWithBiden #GetUpGrowUpShowUpVoteBlue #BlueWaveBlueTsunami
I saw a death notice yesterday that someone posted where the family blamed Trump for people not wearing masks, therefore, their loved one died.  It looked completely made up.  They are going to be rats from hell until November.
No it is unfair to use him like trump has. Sorry right now he is not mentally stable!  And I feel bad for him and his family.  We cannot afford to have him as a president because of mental illness
Trump‚Äôs Bank Was Subpoenaed by N.Y. Prosecutors in Criminal Inquiry
I would say it looks like Trump is a terrible idiot but, that‚Äôs common knowledge at this point
Literally a minute ago he also tried to convince me we have a say in the US voteüòÇ...it‚Äôs already decided, not by the people..it‚Äôs decided by the greater powers..in this war, if the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù are positioned to win, Trump will win ‚Äúthe vote‚Äù or something else with a win for good
I'm in New Berlin, WI and I have seen (2) signs for Biden and A LOT for Trump.    A have (2) friends that work for city (courthouse) they LOVE EVER's.  Courts are closed and they get full pay for doing NOTHING.
TRUMP
So it makes sense to me that we FOR SURE, need to win the Senate back and hold the House.  If Trump would happen to win by cheating, if we have control of  House and Senate we can impeach and remove.
Schools will not reopen even if trump wants them too. Our children's health is on the line. How many if our MPS children can afford a computer or pay for wifi?
Thank god I am Catholic and know more Catholics. Not voting for Trump!  #Biden2020
Stop saying mean things about my president. I‚Äôm voting for you Mr. Trump as are most of my friends. Thank you for signing this bill.
Maybe if he keeps it up it will come back around over the next 4 years
There‚Äôs no ‚Äúletting‚Äù.   Trump makes all choices of what he wants to do and say.  Listens to nobody.
Trump tweet
Millions will cast their vote by mail and Trump wants to cut their funding. Really! They are already not funded enough.
Tell crust to get out of Trump ass
Jonathan Swan‚Äôs facial expressions during his tRump interview. We feel your pain Jon. #InaneInsaneInTheMembrane #ETTD
Still waiting on someone to explain it. Trump is going to get stomped in the election for this and yet nobody cares.
I have seen 3 but I have seen A LOT of Trump signs and American Flags!
As your city rots. U say this.    The Beautiful city you once had is gone. Due to your ignorance of leadership.   Sorry non leadership.  U r a loser. Always were always will be . And you get paid for it. Go figure. Trump 2020
We will have to pick someone in Nov..I‚Äôm going Trump for the best hope..I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs all roses from here, but that direction at least gives us a shot.  No pun intended..
Maybe his misguided fans do, but IT'S CLEAR, TRUMP DOES NOT have best interest of the people or this  young democracy.
ü§´   SO HERE'S THE PLAN:  FIRST WE ARE GOING TO VOTE TRUMP OUT.  THEN WE ARE GOING TO LOCK HIM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY.
DONALD TRUMP IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE, THE #1 THREAT TO AMERICA AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.  FK IN THE DIRECTION OF OFF.
Ya right trump will in against that dementia havin corrupt idiot biden
Do not trust üá∫üá∏don‚Äôt forget the President is Trump ü§¢all he cares about is $üíµ God help us!
My boss is wild. Last night she told me that Donald Trump has six clones, and then went on about how easy cloning is, which led to a tangent on quantum physics. Meanwhile I was like üëÅüëÑüëÅ
do u think barron trump is gonna have daddy issues or like whats
How many times do we need to tell Trump that he shouldn‚Äôt call this the ‚ÄúChina virus‚Äù? What a racist, pompous asshole.
DONALD TRUMP IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
The Covid-19 has been successfully controlled in China. But the TrumpVirus is spreading in US. He has killed 150,000 people. If TrumpVirus doesn‚Äôt go, the death toll in US will rise. Blaming China wouldn‚Äôt reduce the death toll in US, will only appear that Trump is incompetent.
AHH, NOW IT MAKES SENSE, TRUMP IN BED WITH MICROSOFT TO FORCE TIC TOK DEAL.
THE ONLY RISK WITH MAIL IN VOTING EXISTS BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S BUDDY WHO IS NOW SERVING AS POSTMASTER GENERAL, WHO NO DOUBT WILL BE IN CAHOOTS WITH TRUMP SLOW MAIL DELIVERY IN ATTEMPT TO HAVE BALLOTS ARRIVE LATE AND THEREFORE NOT BE COUNTED.  #GOPVOTERSUPRESSION
IT'S NEVER HARD TO SPOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER.
THERE IS NO CASE THAT HOLDS ANY WATER FOR RE-ELECTING TRUMP.
MOST OF AMERICA ROLLS THEIR EYES EVERYTIME TRUMP SPEAKS OR TWEETS, SO WHAT IS YOUR POINT?
My guess is that not a lot of people are going to show up and Trump doesn‚Äôt want to be embarrassed about the crowd size (a la Tulsa), so he doesn‚Äôt want the press to report that. Which ok, but then you aren‚Äôt going to get the free publicity that comes with a convention
Are you saying we shouldn‚Äôt be smart. What the fuck is your logic. Hey there doing it so it‚Äôs ok we do it. This is the Trump logic.
She‚Äôs not a Trump. She speaks in complete sentences
Sounds like destruction of FEDERAL PROPERTY.  Trump should send in his bogus Federal Police.  They should leave Portland and head on over.
South of tomahawk Joey.  Up nort, where the city dwellers go in the summertime and I have no idea why anyone lives there in the winters.  Science should trump politics.
This is just all so surreal.  I still cannot wrap my head around all we have had to endure under Trump and a GOP party who sold their soul to him and sold out the American people, our Democracy in the process.
tRump golfed and people died.  tRump golfed and people were evicted. tRump golfed and people lost their jobs. tRump golfed and kids couldn‚Äôt go to school. tRump golfed and our economy tanked. tRump golfed and Putin‚Ä¶
I've seen a lot of bumper stickers for the POTUS...they usually say "DUMP TRUMP "
He hasn't even picked a veep yet so the bumper sticker is irrelevant.  Christ, is your TV Faux News as stupid as Trump‚ùì (Rhetorical, of course.)  Let them be fired up, they are not the majority and their messiah and his cronies are gonna be just "fired".
Trump is trying to remove Tic Tok for only one reason. 20-30% of the short videos are better campaign ads for VP Biden then he can handle and J Biden isn‚Äôt spending a time. Keep them up and add a hell of a lot more, a lot more. The scumbag will be gone January 20th. Then to jail
The kids are at it again!ü§£ü§£  Trump campaign is giving away free stuff if you volunteer.  On kid is getting like 30 boxes.ü§£ü§£ü§£  They are going to have burning parties.ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£  Lesson:  Don't mess with Tic Tok or the kids who are gonna help us vote this orange ass out!
Trump really be out here throwing more fucking tantrums like the fucking two year old he is about an app that literally a generation and a half uses. Like ilyou don't have a brain but do you really think this ban is gonna help you, you racist homophone dumb ass piece of shit?ü§°ü§°

Trump trying to ban tiktok is the ultimate boomer move. He thinks you can just move tiktok to the recycle bin! The internet doesn‚Äôt work like that! You can‚Äôt build a wall around the internet.
If you are on the ticket, I will be working Trump!!!
Keep trying, these are photo shopped and Trump is clean on this but you LIBS are going to cry............... ü§£ü§£
Sorry, I am busy delivering TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT signs.
Trump is nuts
As a republican who will not vote for Trump, all I ask of a Biden VP is that it be someone who can step in when he is forced leave office early for health reasons.
Good for trump
Herman Cain. Dead at the age of 74 from the Coronavirus. This picture was taken at the Tulsa OK tRump rally he attended, without a mask, shortly before becoming sick. There really are no words. Pro-Life Religions‚Ä¶
The Left wants Americans sick with Covid.  It is obvious, which is why the rioters and protesters do not have any restrictions.   If numbers go up, they can blame Trump.  The Left is pathetic but eyes are opening to what is really going on.  Thank you for fighting for Americans.
I find it kinda funny that the democratic anti Trump ads are blaming him for chaos they caused themselves.
Nah TRUMP 2020!

He was too busy selling America to China, covering up Benghazi and fast and furious and spying on Trump.
Remember when this guy was held up as the decent alternative to Trump?  Good times.
Nancy is so out of touch that she does not realize that working Americans and Middle class ARE Republicans and the TRUMP SUPPORTERS!
Trump's Tulsa rally claims another.
Trump sounds like the illiterate kid trying to explain that ‚Äúof course I read the book‚Äù while simultaneously saying ‚Äúbooks are stupid, I‚Äôm not reading them‚Äù and ‚Äúyou never told me to read the book‚Äù. He‚Äôs so bad at covering for his ignorance and his evil.
It‚Äôs a toss up üßê. Who‚Äôs the bigger asshole ? Jim Jordan or President Trump ? Jordan licks Trumps boots all day. It‚Äôs not surprising, their both sexually sick in the head. Jordan likes them young too .( boys ) what a prick. Mr. tough guy, wear a mask and jacket.Trump Virus is more appropriate
They‚Äôre looking for public support to push their version of save America bill through. Trouble is it‚Äôs full of Schumer and Pelosi pork. They think by agreeing to some things that not only can they buy support, but if things turn bad they were just doing what President Trump wants
For sure. They‚Äôve all cut their own heads off, just running like a chicken until they bleed out. The only way to get honest news now is from the source. Thanks to President Trump for his willingness to take the time to share each and every day. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
One: I'm not a liberal.  Two: Trump cannot form complete sentences and mispronounced basic words on a near-daily basis. #DementiaDonald is definitely not in control of his mental faculties.
Among other assertions, William Evanina‚Äôs new statement denounced foreign influencers‚Äô efforts as ‚Äúa direct threat to the fabric of our democracy.‚Äù
William Barr, Trump's own attorney general, investigated that and found no evidence that Trump's claims were true.
all tik tok has done to me is make me wish I had a dad, a close friend group, a bird, a baby horse, a new puppy and a 'smart funny and can dance' personality and I think those are the exact same reasons behind why trump wants to ban it
No, and we won‚Äôt be under Trump and this Administration. The GOP is killing middle/lower class. Millionaires and billionaires are making life/death decisions for us &amp; have no idea what they are doing.
3)  That's harder to understand, I don't always understand it myself.  There is a woman who is a long standing friend of my family, who is smart and successful,  whom I have always admired.  She has always been Republican and watched Fox News for years even before Donald Trump
1) Part of why so many Americans believe Trump's lies has to do with how popular Fox News, Breitbart News, and even OAN, are here. People get inundated with lies and fear mongering and they've lived with it for so long that they believe  it.  They have also become convinced that
True, Trump may be realizing that the Democrats have the upper hand here, and they think they can use EOs to move the talks back in their direction.
Why wouldn't Trump just go along with the $2 trillion? It's totally in his interest to juice the economy right before the election. You wonder if Mark Meadows is taking a hard line in these talks.
Well of course he is going to deny it...
President Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat. But what is WeChat, and why is it so controversial?
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I didn‚Äôt know Black Lives Matter and antifa were Trump supporters that‚Äôs funny because They seem to always destroy anything that has to do with Trump. One or two rogue white supremacists do not equal tens of thousands  that support the BLM Antifa terrorist
Lol I live in rural WI and come from a family of Trump voters, my life is definitely not an echo chamber, but thanks for your concern. Have a swell day!
The orders take effect in 45 days and could bar the popular apps from the Apple and Google app stores, effectively removing them from U.S. distribution.
Any republican president would have been able to do that with the economy.  It is not trump at all.  Bush had such a wonderful economy going before the bubble burst.
I declare the winner of the 2020 presidential election to be DONALD J TRUMP.There I got that covered.Could you imagine Pelosi or Biden or any democrat alive today being president??  It would mean total annihilation of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. But Pelosi‚Äôs soul sold to Satan
The La Crosse Democrat also said the action breaches United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that went into effect July 1. Reached in May 2019, the USMCA dropped tariffs on steel and aluminum.
i disagree. republicans enabled Trump.
I think he found a bunker left over from the Cold War.He probably end up with a bar built on top of it.Only he probably alone, we‚Äôll maybe Hunter. Where is Hunter? How bout TARA READE? And why are his ads copying what‚Äôs already being done by President Trump? PLAGIARISM OF ACTIONS
President Trump‚Äôs announcement today to raise tariffs on Canadian aluminum is extremely disappointing. This is not how we treat allies that we have recently agreed to a new trade deal with.
Trump is going to say wild and stupid things to distract voters. Ignore him.  via
Lets nit forget Trump openly admitted to accosting, grabbing, and trying to sleep with married women. Then brushed it off as locker room talk. Dude is morally corrupt and his supports refuse to acknowledge it.
So Trump comes across sounding odd, but hey, that's why Pence is on the ticket.
This follows  terrific observation: Trump's appeals to the religious right seem to reflect a New Yorker's idea of what the religious right wants to hear.
Oh repubs, trump told us Mexico would pay for the wall, then if you want a test you can get a test, this virus is a hoax...wait there's more!
DeWine took the test as part of standard protocol before meeting President Trump at an airport in Cleveland.
The Senate Rs are sidelined, Trump is floating executive orders that he cannot do. If the House Democrats think they have the upper hand in the stimulus talks, they are correct. Pelosi doesn't need a deal as badly as Trump and vulnerable GOP senators do.
Watching Pelosi on CNBC and she‚Äôs acting tough so looks like trump will look like a hero. Idiots
Democrats need to give a little on this bill or else it‚Äôs a life line thrown to Trump who will look like a hero. Not sure if this is even legal but hasn‚Äôt stopped him before.
Facebook, citing virus misinformation, deletes Trump¬†post
absolutely dying at the idea that there‚Äôs a difference between Cruz and Trump
Totally agree. Getting conservative justices will be the repubs excuse for voting for repulsive trump. That and repealing Roe v Wade.

Under what rock did trump find this guy? How much bs must the public endure till Jan.?
GOP, Trump campaign attorney working to get Kanye West on WI ballot
Yes they do work for us. But sure as hell won‚Äôt work with us. Way way past time for a change. We‚Äôve got the only man that could do this job. President Donald J Trump and now he needs backup,  which he doesn‚Äôt get much of looks like. C‚Äômon Republicans
It would appear that we now reside in a socialist communist country doesn‚Äôt it?  What is it going to be like between now and Election Day? Or after President Trump is still President Trump? Out of control power hungry idiots should of never had the opportunity to be in charge.
Watch the full "Axios on HBO" interview with President Trump - Axios
Team Trump still has plenty of money, but it seems like they've burned through a lot of cash already.
It's very Trump-like to for making fun of Biden for... following social distancing guidelines.
Given they finally stood up to Trump it‚Äôd be hilarious if they were in on this together
fun part is Trump and Barr can‚Äôt do shit about this
Low grade depression due to Trump admin ? Really ? She should be focusing on the two children that miraculously appeared sometime in their lives. Wanna see baby pics.
Is Hunter running for president?  Nope, so who cares.  Why aren't you upset of the millions of dollars the Trump kids are bringing in?
Probably as soon as your daddy stops sticking his foot in his mouth.  The incoherent turds that fly out of the Trump family's mouths is baffling.
Look at a list of Trump‚Äôs endorsements.  He was endorsed by the chairmen of the US Nazi party.  It was not reported because they are irrelevant, just like this one
Not no fuckin governor or mayors choice that‚Äôs fer damn sure. They are such power hungry assholes they‚Äôll do anything to try to prove not but guess what PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG.

Trump signs $3B-a-year plan to boost conservation,¬†parks
Trump may not have authority, but I worry about what his repub thugs are doing behind the scenes illegally to win.
I hate trump, felix is a good person.
My thoughts have been that they are vaccinated already. They have not tested positive nor anyone around them. Unlike President Trump‚Äôs people. Something smells and it ain‚Äôt the fish.
I do not think Trump can get 50% of the vote in Wisconsin. But with third-party candidates in the mix, he doesn't necessarily need to...
You mean like Trump doesn't have a problem?  I absolutely do not believe that he actually passed that cognitive test he likes to brag about.  And this bill doesn't force people with dementia to vote.  It allows access for people who Already Have the legal right to vote.
The only reason President Trump doesn't want mail in ballots, except in Florida, is to suppress the vote.  So he lies like he always does, and his followers just buy into it like they always do.
Census must be completed in 2021 if trump stops it.
159,000 Americans dead from covid 19, there is no national strategy, and President Trump says "It is what it is."
Asked during a White House news conference what makes the Sunshine State competent with absentee voting all of a sudden, Trump cited the fact that Florida‚Äôs string of Republican governors has established a good track record on mail-in ballots.
See how politicians and advocacy groups reacted in posts and videos as President Donald Trump signed legislation to spend nearly $3 billion a year on conservation, outdoor recreation, national parks and other public lands.
Americans waiting a week for results.   trump failed America. #TrumpVirus2020 #TrumpVirusDeathToll156K  trump demise televised daily
The law will devote nearly $3 billion annually to conservation projects, outdoor recreation, and maintenance of national parks and other public lands.
All this crap happening now sounds and smells like desperation by Trump &amp; this Administration! Start packing...will be gone on January 20th!!
Doesn‚Äôt she ever get tired of her head being so far up Trump‚Äôs ass ?
I love  Some of my favorite reactions to Trump during this gem of an interview:
Seriously. Whether he pushed Trump in that interview or not it was likely his last one with him. He knew that too.
Trump might as well have worn the fucking hot dog costume from I Think You Should Leave going "we should find the guy who did this"
It's unbelievable how dumb Trump is.
Literally every minute or two Trump refers to himself or his accomplishments lmfaoo
How many people did you help kill? Grandma‚Äôs and Grandpa‚Äôs murdered by you and your pal de blasio. And that‚Äôs what it was. Murder. You are not one to criticize anyone let alone President Trump
There is no such thing as ‚Äúsystematic‚Äù racism. Love our great President. And honestly, there was very little racism at all until Obama got ‚Äúput‚Äù in the White House. And as I‚Äôm seeing what the democrats are trying to do to President Trump, I believe Obama was not elected at all.
Trump wants a broader role for telehealth services in Medicare
Terrific job by Swan. Will perhaps be the definitive interview of the Trump presidency. Watch the whole thing.
Trump is a misogynist.  He has rape and sexual misconduct cases against him.  He doesn't care about the kids he is insisting go back to school.  He doesn't care about the American people.     I am a #WomanAgainstTrump
So Apple is expected to pay off Trump for him not stopping the purchase of TikTok? Sounds like extortion.

Hashtag bump #WomenAgainstTrump to stump chump grump Trump for slumped lump.
President Donald Trump is making big claims about cutting drug prices and about a COVID-19 treatment. Here's a look at that and more from the past week.
Oh you meant to say the ‚ÄúTrump Virus‚Äù!!
With 92 days until Election Day, here's what we're watching heading into a new week in the 2020 campaign:
If Joe is so sharp, he should debate Trump today, does anybody think he‚Äôll be any better cognitively in two months???
went above &amp; beyond with this one üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
You already have mud on your hands from 2016 cheating!
I have my whole family supporting Trump. And almost everyone I know. Democrats are cancer trying to destroy this country and must be stopped
I hope he is charged! He is ü§Æ! Just like Trump, they think they are every woman‚Äôs dream. ü§£üòÇü§Æü§Æ
I wish I knew someone that could make a Trump flag with embroidered stars and sewn letters that spell out TRUMP on both sides the rest could be screen printed I need the same heft and weight of the American Flag the crap I find online are so thin they get tangled around the pole
So all the people on the tweet above are in on a conspiracy to hide the effectiveness of the drug because Trump likes it. That is asinine and if you have any intelligence you know it.  They have done the work.  There have been multiple blind studies that show it does not work!
So, according to you the White House Testing Czar, the Director for the Institute of Infectious Diseases, multiple countries that have tested the drug and found it did not work, multiple labs in the US that found it dod not work all all in a conspiracy to make Trump look bad?
So true! And good enough for all prior elections.But not if Donald J Trump is going to get re-elected I guess.I seem to remember that almost 4 years ago a large number of ballots were mysteriously misplaced but magically appeared when ‚Äúthey‚Äù found out murdering killary was losing
Trump needs the race to be shaken up in a big way. And the list of things that could shake up the race is getting shorter.
I figured Trump‚Äôs re-election would cause the GOP to take this seriously.
Trump lies on a daily basis. His list of lies is long and easy to find. And, if you're going to accuse someone of plagiarism, at least learn how to spell plagiarize.
Trump shoots himself in the foot every day.  He doesn't need anybody's help.
The headquarters will remain open through the election.
Because there was an election.  But Trump is trying to delay or cancel the election.  Except he wouldn't just stay in office because Article 20 of the constitution says that his term ends on Jan. 20th at noon, no matter what.  The line of succession says who would be next.
If Trump did somehow manage to cancel the presidential election,  which is unlikely, why does that mean the states would have to cancel theirs?  The states could still hold their elections, leaving the Senate and the House of Representatives intact.
Yeah pretty much every single member of Trump's, ah, let's call it a lazy Susan, instead of a cabinet, since it's always rotating through "the best people." I digress, but yeah, can't think of a one that doesn't have a glaring conflict of interest... ü§î
Obviously they‚Äôre worried that Trump‚Äôs deranged ramblings of an acceptance speech wouldn‚Äôt provide him a bounce but likely the opposite!
Mike Pence was watching way too many Tiktok thots, so Trump banned it!!!
Aside from the obvious - that they were expecting a larger crowd than what came - this is also frustrating because they had plenty of room to social distance and didn't.   It's like Trump wants to kill his supporters.
This was a photo op for the Trump campaign to use. Sad. No way would I meet with this man. We all know how he views people of color.
Fuck Donald Trump
when he trump gonna realize you can't fuck w our generation? if he bans tik tok it'll be a week before there is a new app doing the same thing. don't play w us üôÑ
Trump says he‚Äôll act to ban TikTok in US as soon as Saturday
First it‚Äôs your Trump Troops and now threatening to shutdown a social media platform TikTok.  Sounds like we are in Russia! Is this what your boss Putin wanted?
The social media app has more than 800 million followers worldwide.
How dare he say these words now! Over 150,000 citizens are dead!! Trump and this Administration is responsible for these lives and all those who will die!  The Trump Virus! You all failed the United States of America üá∫üá∏
Money doesn‚Äôt matter to the left, as long as Trump doesn‚Äôt have a rally, let‚Äôs go $20 billion in the hole!

How about telling your boss trump to stop his large gatherings because that's how Herman Cain died.
President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he was taking aim at low-income housing programs like he was doing us a favor.
Definitely not. trump is shaking with fear because as soon as he is out of office the lawsuits are coming n no more presidential resources/co-conspirators.
Crowds? ü§£üòÇ. How much extra do you make for tweeting this nonsense. No masks and no social distancing! Take a big breathe Trump!!
Only for his Trump squad! This man has no honor!
Again, Trump breathe deeply in FL!
Don‚Äôt you put this on Dems! They had a bill, GOP will not bring it up. It doesn‚Äôt have billions added in for military spending that the GOP has on their bill. Plus Trump was stating that it would be more than $1200!
She lies so easily. The Dems were not going to sign off on a GOP bill that has literally billions for military spending! Do not lay this at the feet of Dems. This is all on Trump &amp; this Administration!!
Get facts! The flights that were cancelled from China and Europe were for nationals. U. S. citizens were allowed in and brought the virus. Once here Trump &amp; this Administration downed played it....
The Trump Virus lands squarely on you! The House has a Bill that has already passed. Senate needs to vote it in and you sign it. Do u know how to sign something other than an Executive Order?
Already reports of the Trump appointed Postmaster General crony is slowing down mail delivery. It is just going to get worse in the next few months
Is what plausible? Trump not leaving willingly? Yeah it's entirely possible. What he doesn't understand is that you don't get to choose to accept or not accept the vote. It's not up to him.
WATCH LIVE: Fauci and other federal officials testify on Trump administration's coronavirus response.
Just gonna blame President Trump for everything I‚Äôm gonna guess.
Former Vice President Joe Biden now says he supports travel bans to contain the Chinese coronavirus after all ‚Äì after he previously called the China travel ban issued by President Donald Trump in late January ‚Äúxenophobia.‚Äù  THIS MAN WILL SAY ANYTHING AND LIES ABOUT EVERYTHING
The intelligence of our President and his uncanny ability to fire up the left and their media hounds is amazing. One little sentence, at just the right time, and they start howling like wolves. I truly do love President Trump. His use of sarcasm drives these idiots nuts.
Ok honestly I cant tell if Trump is trying to delay the election for his own gain or if he has also figured out that everyone voting absentee will cause a shit ton of voter fraud.

it's entertaining when he rips the Dem establishment, but my biggest complaint is that he keeps pretending there's no pandemic as he's urging people to not vote for Biden, 4 more years of Trump WILL get 100,000s killed who otherwise would live, election is literally life or death
Look if it Trump gets rid of Obamacare, but replaces with an identical health care bill, I'm fine.  It'll stop his attacks on people's health care, and we'll all know who really did the work...
It will get worse before it gets better. I agree with you there. I too am a Jesus loving Christian. I work on building my relationship with God daily. But I believe that God is working thru Q and President Trump.  There is evidence for this everywhere if one only looks for it.

How will the Coronavirus ever calm down when Trump won‚Äôt be honest with his supporters? He just won‚Äôt say that he got it wrong that the Covid-19 is very serious and contagious. He does his supporters a disservice and every person in this country. Trump refuses to be honest.
In 2006 Congress passed a law to require prefunding of 75 yrs for USPS pensions. They've been hurting since. Obama had both houses of congress, so did Trump. BOTH parties could have corrected this but didn't. THEY'RE BOTH RESPONSIBLE &amp; NEED TO FIX IT ASAP!
I‚Äôd def be more optimistic about that possibility if Biden weren‚Äôt so massively ahead in the polls. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôd arguably be kinda preferable if Trump weren‚Äôt imploding so horribly, b/c Biden might actually feel pressured to concede on at least one damn progressive policy lol.
I think this is a call to get the virus under control... Kids do need to be in school ‚Äî but it can‚Äôt happen because of the incompetence of the Trump admin.... I think that is his point.
So, what you‚Äôre saying is: the Republican controlled Senate had 4 years to protect people with pre-existing conditions but did nothing to make it happen. Since Trump‚Äôs action isn‚Äôt law (and won‚Äôt actually change a thing) it‚Äôs important to vote for Democrats.  Will do! üëç
USPS problems started in '06 when congress passed a law requiring 75 year PRE-funding of USPS pensions. Obama had both houses of Congress from '09-'11, Trump from both from '16-'18. BOTH parties could have stopped this stupidity but didn't so BOTH are responsible for the problems

County Hyw dept ordered them down!! Our tax dollars!! 6 big signs all over county. Trump!
We spent all day yesterday putting up Trump signs. They were  taken down by our COUNTY WORKERS PER the Hyw dept. Our sign was smashed
It's called homegrown terrorists taking over our American government! Led by rich handlers of Trump &amp; Repubs! Reminds me of the now defunct Soviet Union, any hints ü§î
That would take decency and Trump has no morality.
This is too bizaare for words, after west &amp; his plastic surgery laden wife bedded down in the WH with Trump few months ago, Don't you find this odd? All West is doing is trying to pull votes from Biden. He's still in bed with Trump , my learned opinion!üí©

Is this about alcoholism or us it because of Trump's bizaare advice on how to treat COVID19.
I don't know the context or when this happened. But Trump is having trouble finding his words here
And Trump IS A SENIOR!
Right! Trump has never been seen inside a church! He golfs on Sundays! What congregation does he belong to? What is the name  of his minister? Do we ever see Trump, Melania &amp; Barron attending church services together? No. Trump‚Äôs actions are anti-God.
Because nobody has the facts AND knows God like Trump.
The NRA has been skimming millions from members and donars for years and Trump wants his supporters to believe it is the Ds fault. Of course the brainless cult will blindly do as they are told.
See the flthy Repubs with Trump's approval, go for yet another cover up of the truth behind Trump's destruction of America! It's actually come down to good vs evilness! Stand with Joe Biden &amp; Democrats to clean out the US of traitors!
Conservative values don't include what Trump &amp; Pence &amp;  Repubs have done to America! SCOTUS has finally awakened to who the real criminals in America are! Americans, wake up, ask yourself, who took your jobs away? Who let your get sick, die from COVID19?
The government is lying?   Trump is lying, there‚Äôs a difference.
One full of cult Trump followers. They believe propaganda over science or truth. Insanity!

Glad to see you standing with the greatest president ever. Trump 2020 !
Where do you get off accusing the Democrats with not wanting to protect elections? They have been TRYING but your buddy, Moscow Mitch, won't let them.  And, for the record, trying to encourage mail-in voting is NOT trying to "rig an election", despite what Trump wrongly believes.
This is just so perfect at showing how Trump wants to lower the number of tests performed but also only wants to measure success vs Covid using deaths per case (which would look better the more we test). [80 sec video]

Isn't it odd that Trump sounds like an illiterate, unhinged, lunatic through spoken word and all forms of media, yet you don't care?
So, #trump screams about voter fraud. They say no credible evidence. Maybe the proof is in that clown being elected. Are there truly that many stupid people in USA?
Now #trump wants to have his campaign rallies etc out of White House. Legal? Ethical? Not that he hasn't campaigned for reelection even before sworn into office.

Lol they say this about middle aged trump supporters looking into open source dirt on politicians, but ignore the laeft wing extremists violently pushing communism by way of arson, street violence, and even ieds. Terrorist cells operate but qanon is a worry. Seems q hit a nerve.
Not really. They acted while the left and the who said he was just being a racist when he stopped travel from china. In reality china lied about the virus and every lie or convenient coincidence seemed to maximize the viruses impact.Trump did great by ignoring the who.
Just because you say trump killed people with covid doesnt make the reality that its a virus killing people not trump not true. You really sound brainwashed. He did more than has been done for any pandemic i have heard of in america. 160k is much less than 1m + predicted.
Its a biological weapon. It takes 2 weeks to find out you have it and is spread much of that time. Trump didnt make it and he in fact caught a lot of crap for trying to take measures to lessen it. Meanwhile goveners that made decrees that literally murdered seniors are praised.
Cringed thru entire interview. Maybe next text for Trump might be kindergarten readiness test?

Thank you for your concernüòâ but your facts about Trump performance  are only relevant  and accurate after covid19  onset. And the country was shut down. Prior all was up and never before seen success.  The dems had  8 years and blamed republicans at every opertunity.
No question needed. Psychopath narcissistic  exposed himself at the Feb Prayer Breakfast not knowing that Jesus said ‚Äúlove your enemy‚Äù bc Trump said he is against that. Enough said!
That's great.  Ignore the Trump supporters.  Most of us here in the US want Biden to win out of the two choices.  The Trump supporters are more vocal unfortunately.

Yeah that's not going to happen.  The third party candidate never wins and a vote for anyone other than Biden, is a vote for Trump.
Nope Trump really is that stupid.  Except for watching Colbert and sometimes Kimmel, I've managed to avoid watching that idiot in the news.  Everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie.
At least Operation Condor worked. Trump is just clownish.
And I get it.  Hillary was a flawed candidate.  I never really enjoyed the Clintons.  Her campaign was seemingly mismanaged.  And there was a lot of frustration among voters.  Trump promised something different.  A new, unknown type of leader.  I get why people voted for him.
Yet, he is our president and somehow it is possible he might get re-elected.  In the last cycle my feed is filled with Hamilton gifs proclaiming Trump is never going to be President now.  Yet, despite weekly disqualifying revelations, he was elected.
There‚Äôs a lot of Democratic rejoicing following the  interview with Trump.  Yet, it leaves me thoroughly depressed.  On one hand, it seems to be just the latest and increasingly obvious evidence that  is completely unfit to lead our nation.

Back in 2016 MSNBC covered nearly all of Trump rallies. Like most networks they bought into the Hillary e-mail &amp; didn‚Äôt discredit it to tell the truth. They didn‚Äôt bash all the LIES  of Trump rallies. Now they cover his üí© briefings. All for ratings.
Trump is asked how history will remember John Lewis, a vital figure in our Civil Rights history.  And it takes him a follow up question to have an answer beyond whether Lewis was at his inauguration.  I‚Äôll make no apologies saying it: Donald Trump is a pathetic, pathetic person.
You are leaving for the correct reason. MSNBC helped Trump get elected for the sake of ratings. Our Democracy is a risk now. It‚Äôs weird how money drives things instead of doing the right thing. The right thing is the facts and the truth.
Are you that ignorant that you believe this was Trump‚Äôs fault that the economy has fallen back as much as it has? Do you really believe that? Perhaps pandemic was a major factor?

Psychopath  using the Putin fear tactic. First is was fear of anarchist that turned out to be Nothing. Then the fear for suburbs with low income. Nothing. Over 51 million filed unemployment many becoming low income. 32.9% Drop GDP under Trump
Show we appreciate our troops. With Russian bounties on them TRAITOR  &amp; COMPLICIT  REFUSE to condemn Putin. It‚Äôs been 38 days we found out. Trump knew since March. Just like COVID19 he calls the intel report a hoax.
The Trump Cult
I'm really worried about second wave come November #COVID19    Since Trump treated this like fiction, it's really gotten bad.    If he has supported masks earlier, we'd be in much better shape, but he treated like fiction
Rep. Cliburn is the highest ranking Black leader in the Democratic Party. I appreciate a great deal his comments on CNN in the wake of Rep. John Lewis‚Äô passing and another two week wait for a Black VP. We need Rep. Cliburn to hammer the truth at Trump and his brown shirts.

4. Finally, both COVID "cases" and COVID deaths are being inflated and hyped because it's an election year. The liberal media think it hurts Trump. It's ugly (about the ugliest politics I've seen in my 61 years), but it's also obviously true.
If you think it‚Äôs okay for RUSSIANS to have bounties on our troops, vote for Trump &amp; GOP. If like the RECESSION we are in thank psychopath  &amp; complicit  for dividing the country into the extremely wealthy &amp; poorest of poor.

Yes yes very true that man very much deserved to die for being a Trump supporter brave comment. Hopefully all right wingers die from covid. HOPEFULLY EVERYONE THAT DOESNT THINK EXACTLY LIKE ME DIES FROM COVID! HOW GREAT WOULD THAT BE?!  This is the continued narrative of the left
Barack Obama was making a major speech. The GNP tanked with worst report since reports began in‚Äô47. An American died of COVID every minute yesterday, so Trump was Trump trying to obscure the above. He failed. His comments about delaying the Nov. 3 election were unconstitutional.
All Trump volunteers should go on the 'sly' and wear Biden buttons in groups standing in lines. Trump supporters in Biden clothing. False sense if security
Reads as if Epstein was outlining a "defense" for her, knowing he might face increased scrutiny once Trump actually announced his candidacy.
INCOMPETENT ‚Å¶ caused the never ever seen before worst drop GDP. DO NOTHING with COVID19 in the beginning but calling it a Dem hoax has over 153K dead &amp; put America in a RECESSION. TRUMP FAILED AMERICA! I like presidents that don‚Äôt kill us or the economy.

It‚Äôs like he forgets that Wisconsin was under a lockdown during the April election, and the reasoning for the delay was for safety.  Trump‚Äôs reasoning is he‚Äôs against mail in ballots, because he has repeatedly said it‚Äôll harm republican chances in elections.  Hypocritical? Yeah.

Well, Trump has visible mental issues, and his cult is still all in.
The trump signs came yesterday when an old white dude on a three wheeled scooter went door to door asking to place signs.  The biden campaign is not going door to door. That means biden supporter are mad enough to go get their own signs.
My block has something interesting going on. Nearly every house has a political sign in the yard. Every house with a trump sign is owned by an old white dude. The one that isn't is visited by the police regularly for noise and disturbance issues, Deplorables.
Trump's inability to understand pandemic statistics is disturbing.  His cognitive handicaps are displaying in ways that I think most people didn't expect.
And trump basically said Ron was going to help him rig the vote in Florida. Can we please sell Florida back to Spain?
a Trump 2020 mask? is that a joke?  the old white man w the purse
Good thing they social distanced. I guess Trump has just magically avoided the virus for 6 months rather than because of constant testing and certain whitehouse protocols? Or maybe it‚Äôs the Hydroxy cocktail?
At this point are you suggesting Trump should never appoint/hire a black man or women from this day forward, because it will look political? Is he allowed to talk to black people, or should he avoid that as well?
Ignore Trump and go hard after Biden's VEEP. 2016 redux
I know when the ban went into place. We began screening returning flights on January 20 and put the ban on Jan 31. To say no response happened is ignorant of the actual timeline of events and actions taken. Here‚Äôs your January 15 news btw .
This is a joke right? First No one knew of a case on January 15. And even if we did, what should have happened in your estimation with the knowledge on of 1 case?Two questions for you. When was Trump being impeached? Despite that when did he issue a travel ban to China?
I feel like I must be gaining then immediately losing new followers, esp. liberals who follow me when I say I saw the Floyd vid and agree the Chauvin was in the wrong or say "If Trump is found guilty of being a cho mo w/ Jeff, let him burn"... and then they read my other posts.
Remember that National Popular Vote Interstate Compact that I used to scream about on here? Yeah, we should have tried harder to get our state governments to pass that. There are too many republican state governments and trump is going to try to get them to cheat.
A Ukraine company gaining favor with the Obama WH by hiring the Biden‚Äôs son is just a tad different than a US official having connections to the Trump WH and getting his job a son. There are no national defense implications there. You don‚Äôt see the difference?

What day day did Trump know about it and no one else did?
1/2  So I have been trying to find the number of eligible voters in the US and have not been able to. One article said that Clinton and Trump each received approximately 27% of eligible voters votes in 2016. This would mean there were approximately 233-244 eligible voters in 2016
I'm just waiting for him to admit he's going to help trump cheat.

Trump does not care about anyone but himself.  He never has and never will.
OK, so yesterday I get an email from Team Trump not asking for $, but asking us to wear masks as an act of patriotism. Annnnd top trending now is "SHUT YOUR MOUTH" ... was asking us all to wear a mask reverse psychology? Are liberals now 100% anti-mask? That 4D chess playin mofo!

Agreed, they were kinda asking for it. Derp on their part. Perhaps it was the thrill of it all. And there's a big diff. between a President and a football player, legally speaking anyway. So, you are saying you don't like the Trump celebrity death threats, right? Griffin, etc...

Now, again, I only support Trump about 50/50, off-hand. I could give you a more accurate score if I looked up EVERYTHING he's voted on. However, I have always enjoyed setting the record straight to ppl w/ TDS: Here's Trump being hella racist.
Except most of the Hip Hop and Entertainment World. Here's exhibit 1 of 2.  The name drops were not smearing him, but saying stuff like "yea, I'm rollin like Trump, got mad stacks, G!"
Ya gotta point there. Why do you think so many people liked anti-establishment Bernie, Trump, or the Libertarian party? Tired of Lame Ducks.
Calling me a Trumpster is like someone from my side of the isle calling a Bernie bro a Biden fan. In your TDS-addled mind, anyone who gives Trump even ONE positive point is a Trumpster.
You need to educate yourself on the individuals that comprise the Lincoln Project. Although they have disagreements with Biden on policy, they understand Trump threatens our democracy. They are patriots who are putting country over party.
Are you the same GOP nominating Donald Trump?  Fitness for office isn't your position of strength.
Trump or Jo Jo. I'm not voting for a senile pedophile, sorry. And if Maxwell names Trump under oath, well... At least I still have someone I can vote for and believe in. Unlike the two party quagmire choosing a turd over a douche yet again, out of FEAR.
And his claim to fame was his persona in the 80s, numerous magazine articles, most notably in Playboy mag, and a 15 year reality show he hosted, many movie cameos, etc. Idiot. Oh and like 100s of hip hop son name drops before running for prez. Rappers used to love Trump. LOL
Who are we talking about, Biden or Trump? J/k! Trump "admitted" to having had sex with a woman who wanted to willingly have sex with him and then he ran for Prez and thought, despite JFK and Clinton before him, America wasn't ready for an openly SWINGER prez., so he paid hush$.
Actually, I was just telling someone I may go with Jo Jo if Trump were to say, get named by Maxwell in a sworn deposition. I'm not happy with much of his foreign policies nor am I thrilled about him constantly caving into the left. I'm just anti-Leftist, that's all. 50/50 Trumper
If trump promised free college and m4a they'd all vote for him. He wouldn't even have to deliver on it.
btw, for someone as anti-Trump as you are, you're doing a great job at talking to someone who is admittedly pondering voting for him or Jo Jo. No Ad Hom, or anything like it. (y) If Trump gets convicted of Pedo, guess who's short foray into conservatism is over? It's that easy.

41% of the US population voted in the 2016 election for President.   19% of the US population voted for Trump.  We can easily assume that half of that number was his base in 2016. (9.5% or 12.4 million people.)  We can be pretty sure it is less today.  They are a small group.
The White House and its GOP allies appear to be retreating from their opposition to a $600-per-week supplemental unemployment benefit that has propped up both the economy and family budgets but expired Friday.
Well you know how much Trump loves the First Amendment.
This is hilarious, we all know why Biden "shouldn't" debate Trump... Biden fumbles over himself all the time, how can you have a proper dabte when Biden needs a teleprompter and pre-arranged questions? Maybe Trump will correct him and say "Arizona is a state, Joe."

I'm not a trump guy but you lying....
If the Dems are honestly concerned about Trump's tweets about the election, then make sure the polls are open for voting in person. Absentee ballots are fine, but voting by mail is a recipe for disaster. Not afraid of the left, but afraid of what they will do to the USA.
I fear that, as despicable as Trump has been in the past 3 1/2 years, and recently seems to have upped his game, much worse will happen between the election and inauguration.  No matter who wins.
I'll never be a trump guy, but you know obama started the "cages," right? Don't be a hypocrite.
You said THE SAME THING when people asked what to do when Trump suggests delaying the election. And you learned NOTHING.
They were never leaving the Trump camp. They‚Äôre fully entrenched. He could shoot them on Fifth Avenue, and they‚Äôd still vote for him (if they survive).
Wisconsin‚Äôs Republican legislative leaders and the state‚Äôs longest-serving Republican in Congress are breaking with President Donald Trump over possibly delaying the Nov. 3 presidential election.
So let's just say that Trump is building his own coalition to not only remain in power but to form an alliance of certain nations to take over the world.  Just a thought I had since we bought Brazil and no one even noticed.

And this is exactly one of the points of his tweet. Trump can be a master twitter troll at times.
Sure but his boss (Obama) started it during his administration so he's as much to blame (if not moreso) for it as Trump.
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.
Those of you losing your minds over Trump's question about postponing the fall election are falling for an obvious troll. Have you not learned over the last 4 years what a master Twitter troll he is?

Trump is going to win
This might be an important article. Where Do Republicans Go From Here?
The grand prize of all this hateful nonsense is 4 more years of Trump.  Great job idiots; you managed to screw up beating Trump in November.
Conservatives be like "Biden is racist too" and ABSOLUTELY but what's your point????? We don't like Biden either but we're settling????? Just because someone else who has a different political orientation than you is racist doesn't absolve the fact that Trump is a bigot! Go away!
God knows what is in your heart. God knows trump is all about himself and what he can get out of it.
I went out to a State park in my county yesterday and on the way there I saw large support trump/pence signs. Made me sick.  I guess farmers like him for some reason. They just don't get it.
In order to apologize for wrong doing, one must understand the basic concept of Right v. Wrong. Donald Trump does not understand this concept. So this, he can not apologize because he believes everything he does is right...
remember when donald j trump was the first president ever in the history of presidents to allow a whiff of re-election concerns creep into his foreign policy and so he just had to be impeached? good times all around!
And replace the name Biden with Trump and we have the present  reality!
Trump who can‚Äôt even quote from the Bible..or has to borrow one cuz he doesn‚Äôt own one.
Who is going to expect a Trump rushed vaccine to work üëéüèª
Dear god wrap your arms around Mr president Trump please guide him and keep him safe.üôèüèºüôèüèº
Where do we start, there are so many "only hire the best" names associated with Trump. If it is $10M per person, this would be like winning the lottery!
He most certainly would have.  He was the wrong choice and the Democrats will have to wait four more years after failing to defeat the most beatable incumbent since Carter (Trump is far more beatable that GHWB).
That‚Äôs fine, but Biden also has a responsibility to uphold his commitment to live out the teachings of the Catholic faith that he likes to flaunt.  Trump too with his evangelical faith.
Kanye is more insane than Trump!

How‚Äôs the money laundering going in the trump White House? Move those campaign funds quickly.
Like trump has done 100‚Äôs of Times?
I think they have always been stupid, Trump goves them a national platform.
More money for trump to launder
I‚Äôm sure the gods are saying, ‚Äúmore Trump bull shit!‚Äù
true.  but it does violate norms (or if you prefer reinforce the norms obama began to set and trump doubled down on) around abandoning any pretense of public trust and harnessing non political functions of govt to harass ones political opponents
Trump only cares about himself... the rest of us are just a roadblock to his re-election.
Trump needs to stop testing at the White House until everyone can get a test without a week long wait for results.
This is bad!! #VoteTrumpOut
Pretty disappointed Trump, you know you can register him in other schools ...
Right, when trump pauses he lies, come to think of it lies whenever he opens his mouth.
this account always gets it right:  is going after  not Trump (yet, she will if he wins)  If criminalizing political differences is now the new norm, its time for  state attorney's general to start indicting   et al
But we need to takeout the DOJ Trump goons who won‚Äôt go that direction independently.
Somebody wants to have a reputation that isn‚Äôt hated by the citizens once the Trump circus leaves!
Will not be much being trump changed how much a tax break would be.  It went from 3500.00 to 500 under trump
By the way, unlike you I‚Äôve known about Trump since the ‚Äò80s when I lived in NY. Everyone there knows he‚Äôs a lying con man that sucks at business and is always trying to be accepted but never will be. It‚Äôs late comers like you that‚Äôs buying the con. Sad!

We will all be better off when  is no longer President. Not surprised by this...another example that Trump is only in it for himself.
We need an accounting for this corruption and damage to the national interests Trump has accomplished.    Account and put laws in place to prevent in future. Otherwise it get worse from here!
Doesn‚Äôt that 50% translate into the 36% solid base that Trump  has had since the start.
Nikki Haley probably has a much better chance of beating Biden than Trump does at this point.  An indictment, which gives us a shot at a  /  ticket in 2020 would be an absolute gift.
fwiw hard to imagine tish james will indict trump.  DNC goal is to hurt Trump, but not force him from the race. Avg democrat is less supportive of biden, than wants trump out of office. Avg republican is less supportive of trump, than wants to keep antifa out of power
who knew when trump pardoned him, that trump himself was going to get the sholom rubashkin treatment himself ugh
Look at this corruption these people need to be held accountable. Trump 2020

#Trump now said teachers should stay home to protect themselves.  #SchoolsMustShutdown
I‚Äôm anti trump.  I think that Biden is an useful idiot that we can use.  I‚Äôd rather have incremental change than nothing as well.  If the greens get over that 5% cool, but I think it would be much easier to retake the party with progressives than trying to sell something new
So why are  et al boycotting Jewish CEO zuckerberg but not   Thank you  for printing the quiet part out loud.   And thank you  / Zuckerberg for standing with your customers and against the wanna be ‚Äúwoke‚Äù fascists
I agree. Trump would lie non-stop. It would serve no purpose except to possibly make the orange idiot look good through his deceptiveness.
I have always been anti-trump not really liked hill dog, and while I‚Äôm awake to his attrocities.  I can‚Äôt but help but enjoy listening to him talk
Obama should have lost in 2012, but the Obama campaign outworked the Romney campaign and won.  Trump should have lost in 2016, but the Trump campaign outworked the Clinton campaign and won.  #TargetedCampaigningMatters

Why was Trump sitting in tiny chair? Am I the only that noticed this?
I voted Blue in the last two elections, yet today I get a lovely letter from President Trump asking me to participate in a critical survey to help him determine what‚Äôs important!?  He asks for donations, and in his most professional way refers to his opponent as ‚ÄúSleepy Joe‚Äù.
"How would Trump know that what Durham found was 'breathtaking' if it wasn't over?" is what's being alleged.  Sounds like he's been briefed? He promised to stay out of it until it was over. We'll see.

Who was the one golfing and then taking credit? Oh wait that was trump he did nothing
That's because he's sounding it out, that's how my 7 year old grandson pronounced it too. I guess trump has the reading ability of a 7 year old.
Trump didn‚Äôt do any of that
Trump signing a $35 million aid for Human Trafficking survivors is like Marlboro selling you Nicorette gum.
No he wasn‚Äôt, trump is the most corrupt president ever.
So this *isn't* a speech by Trump?
What I want to know is, who is putting these grafs for Trump? He's not smart enough to do it himself.
is there an opportunity to request a secure "drop box" for mail in voters to use at their polling place?  This would help when we know the mail is being manipulated by Trump. Plus, no lines, no waiting.

Trump is pushing kids back in school. Masks at home: we know the home is 1 of the worst areas for infecting other family members. From the camps, we don‚Äôt know how many kids &amp; camp were infected...we know it‚Äôs nearly half.  We know parents are still sending sick kids to school!
Trump and his death cult working to kill our children!    Another reason #EverybodyHatesTrump
if you want to count enablers lets start w/  &amp; *his* cheerleaders trashing decency and norms (eg: little sisters case) that pushed gop into the arms of a trump

TRUMP IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!!!!!
Bernie Sanders has been in Kenosha at least 4 times, He did a national TV special on MSNBC talking to Trump Supporters here.  Hilary Clinton was her in '08 primary.  Kenosha is on the map politically.  Dems want it bad, dems here are fighting hard.  Lots of libs and progressives.
But trump is the incumbent and I have no idea how elections work
"homie (Trump) needs to stay in his lane" üòÇ   Loved it on MSNBC
If trump didn‚Äôt keel over neither will Biden
So, Trump wants a kickback for the sale of TikTok!
Trump makes me ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ
I am not a Trump supporter. It doesn‚Äôt help when the Democrats parade out corrupt trainwrecks without articulated visions for the future. I still believe Trump is a neo-fascist, but the alternative is a weak manipulatable man with zero core values and is suffering from dementia.
A return to decency and stability, something our White House has not had under trump.
They are keeping it secret if they are!  This may be Trump‚Äôs real, imaginary coup!
God bless President Trump!!

No. Only Trump haters.
The way this article frames things is so dishonest.  the violation of norms here is not trump it‚Äôs the push to untested mass mail in voting that is guaranteed to make it difficult to have a clear cut answer by Jan 20th.   We still don‚Äôt have a victor in NY-12  primary
Microsoft to continue talks to potentially acquire TikTok's US operations after Trump threatened to ban the app in the US
Thank you President Trump #MAGA2020
Rule #1....Trump not allowed to answer any question in a way that would appear to make Joe wrong.
You will also notice I follow Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren,etc. I follow various people getting various perspectives. I voted against Trump in the national election in 2016. If someone is correct on something, I will retweet it. I challenge falsehood and hypocrisy from all people.
I also see lots of Trump flags here in Wisconsin. I don‚Äôt believe Biden is leading. Trump 2020.
The point is he doesn‚Äôt. People will vote for him because they are brainwashed. They think Biden will do all these good things and he won‚Äôt. Are economy will take a big tank. And we will be worse off then we are now. Trump will pull it all back together.
Anything's better than Trump...
It's the most bizarre thing. We're 3 months from the election and Trump still doesn't really know who he and Pence are running against. I mean, really?!?!
Looks like the GOP is awaiting your demise too. #RepublicansForBiden #TrumpHasNoPlan

Any doubts Trump will win in a landslide? Read this. üëá  Mostly note the direction the numbers have shifted in just one month.
He‚Äôs not the one pictured with underaged girls nor accused of being one that abused these underaged girls.  Trump is the one has enough pervy photos and comments with and about his own daughter.
Where are they? I‚Äôm no Trump supporter. I didn‚Äôt vote for him. However I see the Black Lives actually Matter movement being hijacked by an organization that is marxist. The Bolshevist demands and tactics are similar to this group. I reject Antifa, communism, the KKK, and fascism.
This narrative drives me crazy, along with the idea that Biden needs to win swing states by a lot so that Trump can't contest them. A win is a win, even if WI or PA end up being extremely close
You have heard Trump‚Äôs incoherent rambling ‚Äúspeeches‚Äù correct? Biden will own him on the stage and again in November. üñïüèªüñïüèΩüñïüèø
Right wing? Wrong. Stick to the subject. "Facts"? Trump personally never filed bankruptcy. And a few failed business ventures pales in comparison to the hundreds of successful. If you had 1 iota of business sense, you'd know that. You don't. And I dgaf about his personal life.
Self-burns are so beautiful when they happen in nature!!  Trump is right. This country sucks. After the last 4 years...we need a change. Good call boss. It takes a real man to admit he failed. We‚Äôre all proud of you backing
Trump will walk right off stage.
Why do think trump wins this?  You have data on that?
Trump would never even give her the time of day. He only likes young beautiful women!
At this point he‚Äôd pretty much have to kill someone for me to not vote for him. ...oh wait, even then it couldn‚Äôt compare to the 100s of thousands Trump will be responsible for killing before this is all over. Short answer: Hell yes.
Please please debate Trump. üòÇ Must see tv.
Absolutely. I don‚Äôt think Biden has anything to gain by debating Trump.
Rob, I think Trump is right!  We should change the election date. We should have it next week!!  Too long to wait until November!
He was on his way out until the anarcho-communists came out from under their rocks and have created mayhem.  These goofs are guaranteeing Trump‚Äôs re-election.
Every time I see one of their ads my first thought is wow! This is great. But then I think if it were anyone but Trump, the ads would be about Democrats and I wonder how angry they would make me then.
I‚Äôm sure Trump‚Äôs calling him a dumbass!
trump isn‚Äôt gonna ban tiktok

China isn‚Äôt the only bad one.  Trump‚Äôs America is quickly turning on its citizens.
FINALLY! Trump did something great..... getting rid of TIkTok is the best thing he‚Äôs done since he‚Äôs been in office
my lord imagine having spent the last 4 years listening to all the griping that trump only ran for president to feed his ego, and then still assert that ego feeding ambition is considered an *admirable* trait in a man.
I mean, he‚Äôs not wrong but doesn‚Äôt he ultimately manage the sport? Maybe he should do something instead of threatening. Sounds like Trump. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I said 6 countries before Trump announced he would.  Others did the day he announced and others when it went into effect.
You really can't save these idiots from themselves.
Only six countries did so before Trump announced he would.
oh man trump once made a joke to epstein in a night club thats exactly the same thing as staying overnight in a villa with him and two young girls
Trump has taken action when governors and mayors have clearly failed to fulfill their most basic and fundamental of duties.
this is tired.  the preponderance of available evidence dictates that  1. Trump: knew he was a general sleazeball, was not participant in, may not have known of, illegal activities  2. Dersh: almost certainly knew everything that went on, may not have participated  3. Clinton:
Trump and Co is out to kill us all!
I think this places him much much closer to the scene of the crime than anything that‚Äôs come out vis trump, yes.  I don‚Äôt see room for any other reasonable view here
I‚Äôm not under any illusions that trump is a decent human being.  And if there was a better alternative for president I‚Äôd take it. But that‚Äôs still not the same as, it‚Äôs in fact very far from, his being participant in underage orgies.
We still don‚Äôt!  We can pray enough people have turned against Trump that voter suppression doesn‚Äôt alter the true result!
If Trump and the GOP had been promoting wearing masks 6 weeks ago Cain would still be alive.
there is evidence they spent time together as neighbors and members of the same social circle.  There is no hint of evidence that trump participated in Epstein‚Äôs illegal activities.
People are waking up to this truth.  This situation has made many, who were going to vote against Trump, rethink their choice.  The Democrats had the White House sealed up until they allowed these clowns to run amok.  Now neo-fascist Trump will get 4 more years.  Great job, dolts
‚ÄúTrump paid more for ventilators in the middle of a global pandemic / shortage, than Obama did in ordinary times‚Äù  You people are sick plain and simply sick  Maybe if Obama had bought enough ventilators in ordinary times Trump wouldn‚Äôt have had to pay surge pricing
talk about lying #FakeNews!  at the rally Trump joked that he told his advisors to stop testing which was dishonestly reported as an admission by the Fake News  Here Trump rightfully points out that more testing means more cases, but there is no hint that he wants less testing
They wouldn't be bringing up hypothetical scare scenarios if they were confident in the poll numbers.  They need their side to doubt the election results when Trump wins.
The damage  has done to our families, our nation &amp; our economy will take years, if not lifetimes, to fix. Here‚Äôs a perfect example of Trump &amp; family putting their political needs ahead of our nation‚Äôs wellbeing. Beyond reprehensible.
Let‚Äôs save it for the next president. We will get a shit job done with Trump trying to pocket the money for himself and family.  Big No!
They think everyone has dirt on Trump. Never pans out.  Don't they realize that as much as these celebrities and elite people hate Trump right now, that if any one of them had actual evidence against him, it would get released stat?  They got nothing.

Trump may have been cut out out of partisan spite but he has been a more effective leader against racism than the whole lot of them combined
Bush can speak from one side of his mouth but he and his pappy cultivated the worst instincts of the Republican Party.    Only Trump has led GOP decisively against racism and they hate him for it

Cain went to the Trump rally without eating Godfathers Pizza first.  He contracted COVID-19 at the rally.  Godfathers Pizza clearly saves lives.

Trump Suggests Unprecedented Delay to November Election
The fact is the only real compelling argument *for* trump is to compare him to alternatives.   When mainstream media drops all pretense of professionalism/ integrity (as Kessler is doing here), he is lending credence to trumpism.
at q here isn‚Äôt whether trump is best person to be president, at q is facts &amp; context around the bounty story. Powell who is openly opposed to Trump politically (not interested in supporting him) is simply telling the truth. Kessler is deceiving.

The NRA is already in deep financial trouble. But I‚Äôm sure they were still able to give 30 million to trump‚Äôs campaign again.  Good riddance  !!
I was just happy it wasn't directly about Trump.  That would have DEFINITELY energized his base.
Completely ignoring the merits of this case, why would you do this 3 months before an election? This is going to drive republicans and gun supporters to Trump, regardless of their opinion of him.  Feels like Dems making a lot of mistakes that could cost them in November.
Trump is going to roll with the "they're trying to take your guns" thing now
You have to look at what Trump does from the viewpoint of Putin what is good for him  keep talking about a drug that doesn't work only creates chaos which is what Putin is always looking for here and around the globe  Trump is always looking to help Putin out so start from there
By being this cheer leader for Trump following his lead lying his head off will forever taint his reputation  to me it wasn't that great before now it's in the toilet  he should remember whatever Trump touches dies
You're assuming those asking questions would do their homework and push back at Trump calling out his lies which will be whenever he opens his mouth  he can't help it being addicted
I read this 3Xs. Trump makes no sense.
Why wouldn't Trump say nice things about this guy since Trump cheated on his wives  had affairs with Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal paying them off to the tune of 280K covered up by the national inquirer and admitted on the bus he kissed and groped women because he could
You're enabling Trump to do Putin's wish list  Dividing us  Killing us  Ignoring Putin giving Taliban weapons and a Bounty on our troops  Removing 12K troops from Germany  Creating chaos  Destroying our institutions  Trump and you are TRAITORS to this country
Trump has no loyalty except to himself.  He‚Äôd even throw his own kids under the bus.  I can hear him now...I was president when that happened, talk to Jr and Eric.

For crying out loud how many times are you going to tweet this? Robin Williams was a great comedian and he would have better shit about your boy trump
People and institutions didn't used to get so many death threats until Trump came on the scene especially being the president  remember the Trump follower in Florida sending pipe bombs to places like CNN and others Trump called his enemies
Whatever Trump touches dies
All republicans have taken their lead from their boss Trump  lie when they open their lips send out a tweet or email  you're too nice saying facts don't matter  they just flat out lie knowing they are lying they just don't care  that is unless the voters punish them at the polls
The thing is interviewers normally don't push back or point out to Trump when he said something that is wrong or incorrect  they don't do their homework like Swan
By "the virus" you mean Trump, right?
He‚Äôs got Trump‚Äôs back.
Donald Trump ended a nearly 20-year-old ban on selling gun silencers to foreign buyers in July. The ban,which was implemented in 2002,was intended to prevent terror organisations from gaining access to American silencers.  This lifting of this ban helps Russia kill our soldiers!
Just for reference...there‚Äôs no way people ironically like Donald Trump‚Äôs tweets right?
To be fair, the POTUS isn‚Äôt allowed to drive. But I don‚Äôt ever remember seeing tRump drive anything than a golf cart before he was president

That didn‚Äôt take long for the real Donald Trump to come out.
So says this conservative biased spice:
So Biden "clarifies" but Trump lies. Why no one watches you.
You're missing the point that a president any president shouldn't get involved in a private business matter unless there is public corruption  he Trump shouldn't be telling a company like TikTok they can't operate in this country  that's what countries like China and Russia

Putin is Trump‚Äôs boss. Trump‚Äôs in our WH and this cannot be allowed. How can we trust Trump not to put Putin and Russia before this country? Trump has yet to protect our Troops from Putin‚Äôs bounties. It‚Äôs time for Trump to go!
Trump must be trying to fool the voters or did he drop the Lawsuit to get rid ACA that already covers pre existing conditions? It‚Äôs really hard to believe anything Trump says.
Does no one in the GOP understand that Trump isn't the only one on the ballot?  The govt will be reduced to 65 Senators - that's it - if there is no election.
I see now that Thanks Obama is already trending and I'm late to the party. Kinda like Trump's executive order.

How will the Coronavirus ever calm down when Trump won‚Äôt be honest with his supporters? He just won‚Äôt say that he got it wrong that the Covid-19 is very serious and contagious. He does his supporters a disservice and every person in this country. Trump refuses to be honest.
In 2006 Congress passed a law to require prefunding of 75 yrs for USPS pensions. They've been hurting since. Obama had both houses of congress, so did Trump. BOTH parties could have corrected this but didn't. THEY'RE BOTH RESPONSIBLE &amp; NEED TO FIX IT ASAP!
I‚Äôd def be more optimistic about that possibility if Biden weren‚Äôt so massively ahead in the polls. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôd arguably be kinda preferable if Trump weren‚Äôt imploding so horribly, b/c Biden might actually feel pressured to concede on at least one damn progressive policy lol.
I think this is a call to get the virus under control... Kids do need to be in school ‚Äî but it can‚Äôt happen because of the incompetence of the Trump admin.... I think that is his point.
So, what you‚Äôre saying is: the Republican controlled Senate had 4 years to protect people with pre-existing conditions but did nothing to make it happen. Since Trump‚Äôs action isn‚Äôt law (and won‚Äôt actually change a thing) it‚Äôs important to vote for Democrats.  Will do! üëç
USPS problems started in '06 when congress passed a law requiring 75 year PRE-funding of USPS pensions. Obama had both houses of Congress from '09-'11, Trump from both from '16-'18. BOTH parties could have stopped this stupidity but didn't so BOTH are responsible for the problems

If Trump continues to destroy the American empire, I would support him. Biden is a bigger threat to world peace.
Using someone's funeral to push divisive rhetoric and partisan talking points is the very definition of "sleazy." Obama did that yesterday and Tucker Carlson was right to call him out on it. If Trump had done that, the media would be all over him. Just another double standard!

Bill belongs in prison. They call Trump a grifter but this guy here has bamboozled liberals into thinking he gives a shit about them.
Dear Mr .Trump. I left a message about my son being killed in Wisconsin  by an illegal immigrant  . I was denied victim comp for costs. Now Hud also denied me because I'm on disability . I know they recieved  a hude amount but keep saying no to the low income sad
This clearly illustrates how wrong and out of touch trump is.  Because he never read any history, he is making the same mistakes as George Wallace and Richard Nixon.
Fair but he still hasn‚Äôt been accused of anything Moreover q anon and Trump fans are saying the documents prove trump is innocent is in all this
Amazing....you had me at ‚ÄútRump must go.‚Äù
Why the fuck would we vote Trump?! So we can have more riots because of his racist, fascistic policies and his collosal ineptitude? The videos you are showing are from TODAY, not some future where Trump isn't POTUS. Voting Trump means more civil unrest.
Why.. why are you using trump cadence?

I'm voting for Trump
This is appropriately powerful writing in defense of our country from a professor at my alma mater.   Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.
Like I agree keep trying to impeach Trump but still
Most of us true conservatives think Trump is wrong on a lot of stuff and won't be voting for him.  Myself included.
Trump is on TV right now discussing moving the election in a very serious way
The laziness is why the Republicans helping to investigate trump have not chosen to give Him The boot
Trump and the republicans in the cabinet are honestly too lazy and incompetent to pull of a coup
Watching Obama‚Äôs speech today puts into stark contrast what a cancer Trump is on our governance and our nation as a whole. The treatment is coming in November. He must be removed and the GOP crushed. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Honestly, I can hardly concentrate today thinking about all the ways Trump is going to try to steal the election.
The only fake is you trump.. please just go live with Putin you make a good pair
Trump is the one not doing his job and who should clear out so Americans can be safe. #nobodylikestrump
Knowing that Trump checks Twitter trends regularly, I find it amusing that #PresidentPelosi is trending. How many days until election again?
Herman Cain, hospitalized with COVID-19 following Trump's Tulsa rally, has died at 74.
I like that every time you report a Trump tweet for voter suppression, it allows you to stroll through his other tweets and report the other five tweets he let off that are meant to suppress the vote. Efficient.
Wow! I cant believe you actually said that! Have you been to or seen a Trump rally? Its like JimJones is Guyana! Everyone teeters on every word. They are Cult 45s. And talking to Trumpkins is like talking to Bunker BOY himself. They repeat everything he says and thinks. Hello

Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare
Trump has been set up this last year. You all voted for him and are now backing off because of false claims, ads, and news. People need to wake up and read all the great things he has done. The wall is still being put up, useless wind farms are being removed, and I can go on.

I'm listening to Disco Fever  Get out of the tRump slump and dance !
it's entertaining when he rips the Dem establishment, but my biggest complaint is that he keeps pretending there's no pandemic as he's urging people to not vote for Biden, 4 more years of Trump WILL get 100,000s killed who otherwise would live, election is literally life or death
Look if it Trump gets rid of Obamacare, but replaces with an identical health care bill, I'm fine.  It'll stop his attacks on people's health care, and we'll all know who really did the work...
It will get worse before it gets better. I agree with you there. I too am a Jesus loving Christian. I work on building my relationship with God daily. But I believe that God is working thru Q and President Trump.  There is evidence for this everywhere if one only looks for it.

I'm sure the European Union, Canada, Mexico, and most countries of the world are hoping Trump does not win re-election. It's dangerous to have a crackpot in charge of a major power.  Of course Russia supports Trump because he is doing a good job of destroying the United States.
Our suffering for Trump‚Äôs failures is just beginning. We have sacrificed half a year, $3 trillion of our treasure and 157,000 lives ‚Äî and it has been squandered by one man‚Äôs incompetence.

This is why the Republicans lost the house in 2016. Because they were trying to dismantle ACA and  the pre-existing conditions. Trump is throwing what ever on the wall to see what stick. He is the worst president ever. #Biden2020
Trump claiming that he will protect pre-existing condition in health insurance, and this is the first time it will happen. Wrong he is has been trying for 3 year to dismantle ACA pre- existing conditions provision. He think this will help him.

I have zero sympathy for people who voted in 2016 for Trump like I just saw on tv and now live with a huge regret.  We would not be in this situation had Hillary been elected.  They all had enough information to know that he was not the correct choice.
Oh I‚Äôve not doubt that MEMEMIG with the pinned Trump 2020 tweet and American flag porn-laden profile is a real independent thinker who‚Äôs totally amenable to new information and fact-checking.
#JoeBiden is an absolute #racist. Has a history of racist statements, policies, &amp; the media &amp; Dems hate Trump so much, they let him get away with saying anything. It's truly disgusting. Todays Dems have adopted a radical, psychotic, overtly racist &amp; white supremacist ideology.
What Trump is maliciously doing to essential government services long thought sacrosanct is the one and only argument against single payer healthcare I will even entertain.

Putin is Trump‚Äôs boss. Trump‚Äôs in our WH and this cannot be allowed. How can we trust Trump not to put Putin and Russia before this country? Trump has yet to protect our Troops from Putin‚Äôs bounties. It‚Äôs time for Trump to go!
Trump must be trying to fool the voters or did he drop the Lawsuit to get rid ACA that already covers pre existing conditions? It‚Äôs really hard to believe anything Trump says.
Does no one in the GOP understand that Trump isn't the only one on the ballot?  The govt will be reduced to 65 Senators - that's it - if there is no election.
I see now that Thanks Obama is already trending and I'm late to the party. Kinda like Trump's executive order.
So these supporters of Trump boo the Press.  They no longer believe in our Democracy. They want Trump more than they want their freedoms. Trump has pulled them in. Vote Blue to keep America from becoming an Authoritarian country!
HERE'S THE LIAR AND CHIEF GASLIGHTING HIS BASE  AGAIN ; MAKING PROMISES HE CANNOT KEEP.  WHERE'S THAT COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE PLAN YOU PROMISED TO RELEASE IN 2 WEEKS???  JUST ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.
Isn‚Äôt DT a pedo as well? And he definitely also has dementia. He also sexually assaulted a number of women and has ties to Epstein sooooooo? Any interview with Biden is better than the interview Trump just gave. It‚Äôs embarrassing.
this could've been written today... the trump reference would still work, just a little differently
How will the Coronavirus ever calm down when Trump won‚Äôt be honest with his supporters? He just won‚Äôt say that he got it wrong that the Covid-19 is very serious and contagious. He does his supporters a disservice and every person in this country. Trump refuses to be honest.
In 2006 Congress passed a law to require prefunding of 75 yrs for USPS pensions. They've been hurting since. Obama had both houses of congress, so did Trump. BOTH parties could have corrected this but didn't. THEY'RE BOTH RESPONSIBLE &amp; NEED TO FIX IT ASAP!
I‚Äôd def be more optimistic about that possibility if Biden weren‚Äôt so massively ahead in the polls. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôd arguably be kinda preferable if Trump weren‚Äôt imploding so horribly, b/c Biden might actually feel pressured to concede on at least one damn progressive policy lol.
I think this is a call to get the virus under control... Kids do need to be in school ‚Äî but it can‚Äôt happen because of the incompetence of the Trump admin.... I think that is his point.
So, what you‚Äôre saying is: the Republican controlled Senate had 4 years to protect people with pre-existing conditions but did nothing to make it happen. Since Trump‚Äôs action isn‚Äôt law (and won‚Äôt actually change a thing) it‚Äôs important to vote for Democrats.  Will do! üëç
Is she...is she admitting that Dems will fight Trump despite claiming they support this same position?
So you‚Äôre saying Dems will fight against something they claim to favor because they don‚Äôt want Trump to get credit for it?
USPS problems started in '06 when congress passed a law requiring 75 year PRE-funding of USPS pensions. Obama had both houses of Congress from '09-'11, Trump from both from '16-'18. BOTH parties could have stopped this stupidity but didn't so BOTH are responsible for the problems

No president has ever used the English language the way trump does
Winning by a small margin isn't enough (Trump's tricks and dirty maneuvers), Biden needs at least around 320 to 330 EVs, to avoid Trump trying dirty maneuvers. Also, the senate is equally as important as winning back the White House. It's time to end Trumpism, forever!

So I cannot participate in the ‚Äútrump mispronounces... xyz‚Äù . However, I know what it‚Äôs like to work to overcome obstacles, and try. HE IS NOT. He has an obvious reading disability and he is NOT trying. I hate that so hard.
Trump said: ‚ÄúMy God is the best God, better than the Jewish God, the Chinese God, the Mohammed‚Äôs God and almosr as good as me‚Äù. This is the guy who had peaceful protesters removed by force so he could walk accross the street and hold a Bible upside down.
TRUMP sucks
What the actual fuck, he has shown no remorse for his administration, the quagmire in Iraq, the callous cruelty of his administration. He was considered the dumbest president in the modern era before Trump as well. The guy absolutely is horrific.
My understanding is that Trump typically skips customs.
I would pay a lot of money, instead of a debate, to watch a Bible trivia match between Biden and Trump.
If Donald Trump wins another term, being this fucking stupid will be legally required of all citizens.

Thank you for your concernüòâ but your facts about Trump performance  are only relevant  and accurate after covid19  onset. And the country was shut down. Prior all was up and never before seen success.  The dems had  8 years and blamed republicans at every opertunity.

Guise. Biden isn't fooling anyone. He's just getting away with it right now. But the narrative is out there that's he's mentally unfit and afraid to challenge Trump in a public debate. There is zero chance America elects someone who hides from a fight.
He went to a BLM protest and thinks he's down for the cause. He tried attacking me because I told him I was voting Green. Said my vote was going to help Trump. That idiot got mad because I brought up the fact that MLK said beware of the white Moderate.

Wow. Trump is delusional and dangerous. November can‚Äôt get here soon enough.
It's almost like people don't realize the polls reflect opinion of public Trump and private Biden. At some point the campaign will begin in earnest and the Biden oppo will be savage. And by oppo I mean the the stuff he says himself out loud. This cave routine has a shelf life.

Only dictators associate with Trump. Our allies must be waiting for Trump to lose before communicating with America again.
I hope that I'm wrong. But, unfortunately, I wasn't the last time. I suspect Trump will win Wisconsin again. The Democrats made the mistake of taking us for granted last time. This time COVID has blown their ability to properly campaign here.

Here's Trump in Ohio claiming that Joe Biden is "against God."  "No religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God. He's against God," Trump says.‚Äù That is not true, and also not coherent sentences.
Bice: Democratic candidate Roger Polack was part of legal team that negotiated plea deal for former Trump official Michael Flynn in criminal case  via
Also trump tweeted the other day that mail in voting in FL is chill and encouraged so at least y‚Äôall are peas in a pod for ideologic inconsistency
I Just Realized why Trump tweets like This.  He only ever reads headlines.
I mean, Biden is clearly not as religious as Trump, who we all know goes to church twice a week and is fingering his rosary CONSTANTLY. The man is always groping for closeness to the holy spirit. Literally grabbing god by the rectory. Also super honest.
You posted an opinion piece while trying to justify your fear mongering with ‚Äúcase studies‚Äù that don‚Äôt support the conclusion you‚Äôve drawn lol   Hilarious you accuse me of political religion when you so blindly follow trump
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine tests positive for COVID-19 ahead of Trump visit
I'm surprised that he's open to Rice. A reasonable person should be; but this gentleman clearly doesn't hail from the frothing-at-the-mouth Right-Wing Trump cult, for whom Rice would be a lightning rod for (unfounded, conspiratorial) attacks. Maybe she is a viable pick after all.
I pray for him to be wrong.  If Joe Biden would win, he would not be in charge, someone else will. America would be doomed.  Vote President Donald Trump for 2020.
because trump thinks he is God. that's the only way this makes sense.
You can repeat that statement with any number of supposed "values" that the Nihilist Right-Wing claimed. "I don't see how 'family values' conservatives can vote for any GOPers let alone Trump" "I don't see how 'Constitutional' conservatives can vote for any GOPers let alone Trump
I agree with you wholeheartedly! It‚Äôs so frustrating that I have to hold my nose and vote for Biden, just like I had to for Hillary. We need change and we need it now! All we have is a Hobson‚Äôs choice of a lukewarm Republican and Trump, an exaggeration of the ‚Äúknow nothing‚Äù party

Y‚Äôall cancel shit that don‚Äôt matter. Y‚Äôall got petitions to deport Tory But I didn‚Äôt see a petition to shut down  or  y‚Äôall hate trump talking bout deporting mfs for more legit reasons but y‚Äôall want this man deported for some shit that ISNT PROVEN GUILTY.
I don‚Äôt give a fuck what tRump says.
It‚Äôs also nice of  to give Trump another talking point, this time about concrete action taken by his political opponents against the perceived side of gun rights. The Dem leadership is a ü§° show.
Hard to see "NRA is a cesspool of corruption and therefore was sued" leading many on the fence voters to Trump.

Donald Trump has revealed the depths of the country‚Äôs prejudice and forced Americans to reckon with a racist system, writes
I had to tell this one Queen, this was the energy needed to catch Trump on his shit. After years of being insulted and discredited at each turn, and then Jonathan Swan comes in and is like ‚Äúno no...you have no lines in this play sir.‚Äù
If you have paid attention to every time the media has contested Trump only for them to get shut down, be insulted, called ‚Äúfake news‚Äù, banned....no...this was the energy needed. And clearly this showed that he couldn‚Äôt keep up.
Then you are responsible if Trump wins
He has Trump in his bio. Clearly suffering from TDS
He Predicted Trump‚Äôs Win in 2016. Now He‚Äôs Ready to Call 2020.
*hypocrisy. Not everything is about Trump.
Same thing with millions "going missing" in the Trump campaign. Or the Trump Foundation. These people are all grifters.
But only to people who vote for Trump, if he has his way
Oh you haven't heard people like Laura Ingraham and Donald Trump are doctors for republicans
Me getting in line for 8 hours to vote Trump out
What I've been saying! But this president isn't much help either. First masks weren't necessary because the virus wasn't a big deal. Now he's encouraging it to get yall votes. Fuck Trump!Trump is working very hard to undue the damage Obama did to America. Trump is doing what America sent him to Washington to do and is doing a excellent job draining the swamp!
Trump saved America from the Democrats and Chinese üá®üá≥ communism. Trump is trying to undue the damage Obama did.
He presented ample evidence and said Trump could not be exonerated. Collusion is not a legal term or crime. So if it feels good for you and your fellow cultists to claim that, have at it.

One thing Bezos does is not torment over "reversible decisions".   IE, if there is little or no risk to something, and possible benefit, why not?  Unless you consider Trump looking good as a risk.
Trump won because of independents. The entrenched Republicans wanted their own guys. Romney or Cruz. Trump messed up Republicans and they are losing their re-elections too. The Democrats are cannibalising themselves.
The Republicans don‚Äôt like Trump. Many entrenched politicians are dropping off from both parties. America is being rebuilt because of the effort of Trump!
False ideology. Trump is busting up the sickening system and you dummies don‚Äôt know anything about it. Liberals are blinded by ideologies.
I don‚Äôt idolize Trump. I mock him and Tweet shit at him all the time.
Remember, Trump told everyone how much better USCMA was going to be versus NAFTA. Now one of our closes allies and trading partners is hitting us with retaliatory tariffs.   We can fix this insanity in 88 more days.  Wherever you are, get registered today:
I am independent. So is Trump. Trump could have won the Democrats primaries if he tried. Trump is a New York liberal with a Hollywood Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Hollywood made Trump President...üòõüòÇü§£

Testing is how science works. One imagines had Trump not authorized 80 billion to buy HC; as well as state expenditures of ~20 billion, there‚Äôd be no insistence on continued testing of a drug that‚Äôs been demonstrated as ineffective. More good $ after bad...
We said that about Trump too.
people will say trump is racist but forget that he abolished slavery????
Donald Trump is buddies with Dennis Rodman and ESPN is owned by Disney, who is partnering with China to create Anti American White Man propaganda. The Democrats sold access to Chinaüá®üá≥ for cashüíµ. The Democrats are complicit in the Chinese propaganda. Why would Trump support that!
Trump is a #Biblicalidiot
I drive a truck and my wife is in childcare there is no just stay home with the kids for us. Thanks for the Trump Derangement Ebola comment now I know your angle. Also, you didn't answer my question. Why is this experiment ok?
I can't say how much I agree with this.  Anything other than a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.  He is far from my favorite and primary his ass out in 2024 but voting for him is a vote to start fixing this dumb shit.
Disastrous or slow?  1) got results 2) no fraud  So what‚Äôs your complaint? 1) Waiting weeks to know the margin Trump lost to Biden  2) no fraud
We know you proved that with Trump.
Trump struggles with country names so bad, the White House comms team must live in fear of the day Niger is the topic of conversation.
F this noise. Isn't it enough that voters all but capitulated and gave them Biden, when we could have had Warren or Sanders - actual progressives.  Now they want to hold the VP pick hostage? If they aren't ready to vote against Trump by now they never were going to.

When I work at Walmart, I see people wearing Trump hats and masks.  I haven't seen any Biden hats or masks, here.
Depends on the methods, pollster.  The majority used in 538‚Äôs approve/disapprove of Trump, indeed abysmal IMHO.

it's embarrassing that this is who the DNC put forward and this is who I have to vote for to unseat trump

He's following the rules to stay healthy and avoid getting COVID-19. There is not a single voter whose support for Biden over Trump was pinned to seeing him in Milwaukee.
Great sentiment for theists. However generally all share your concern with Trump as POTUS....

People have criticized Trumps bluster, but he's a comedian.  He's basically an Orange Aziz Ansari.  He complains more than anything else.  Biden actually insults people to their faces and would probably be in 5 fights a day if he wasn't famous.  Trump is a moderate.

What do you think she‚Äôd say about him using Trump‚Äôs operators to help him disenfranchise millions in Wisconsin; by getting his name on OUR ballot,w/no hope of winning? Only reason is to help TRUMP. We just rid ourselves of a racist R gov., now Kanye is trying to help them!
Is this Kanye‚Äôs Wisconsin Election Slogan?? It‚Äôs clear getting Trump‚Äôs campaign to help him get his name on the ballot was not about Kanye but his support for Trump.  SHOULD MILLIONAIRES DICTATE WHO IS PRESIDENT??? SHOULD MILLIONARES GET MORE THAN ONE VOTE????  #kanyeajoke
KANYE, used TRUMP‚Äôs staff to help him file to be on the Wisconsin ballot in November.  He will try this in other swing states.  AREN‚ÄôT YOU TIRED OF BILLIONAIRES/MILLIONAIRES deciding who will represent U.S.???? Please send this information to all, help U.S., save U.S., from evil!
KANYE thinks his vote is more important than YOURs. Now coordinating w/TRUMP,using his folks to get names;deliver paperwork to the WEC to get his name on Wisconsin‚Äôs ballot,an important swing state. Do you want to support another millionaire trying to fix the election for TRUMP??
I think the logic is there‚Äôs a certain percentage of people that absolutely will not vote for Trump and probably won‚Äôt vote for Jorgensen so giving them an option that still isn‚Äôt Biden helps Trump more than it hurts him
Trump's  daily covid death predictions?
No but Trump has his base that would justify him burning an American flag at this point and the more people running that aren‚Äôt Biden helps Trump

Is this going to end up being a situation where the Trump campaign will have to reimburse the government, like when AF1 is used for non-government purposes?
Let's talk about Trump' insistence that more testing means more (reported) cases. He argues that our low number of deaths per case shows we are out performing the world.  If we tested less, that number would increase substantially. (Same deaths / less cases = more deaths / case)
Trump losing the election again is ok with me too. #Biden2020 #FireTrump

happy birthday MR. President I wonder if trump gets happy birthday wishes
The first rule of financial crimes is to not get greedy. Pigs get fed, hogs get slaughtered.   The brazen criminality is bad enough, but it's really Trump's lack of commitment to his trade that I truly find offensive.
I think Jared walked into the room and Trump wanted to ask about Middle East peace at that moment.

This is a gross thing to say and it reeks of corrupt intent. But, wouldn't the gov. get a piece of that sale through some kind of tax anyway?  Or is this one of those things that doesn't happen when there is this much money on the line? Does Trump want a sack of cash of his own?
If you ask Trump about this again next week, that building will be "worth" $10 billion. He does this with numbers all the time.

Being big Trump fans is like being a Detroit Lions fan. Your team sucks and always has but you love them anyway. You make an acquisition and think it might turn it around but it won't. Your QB might have a 300yd 2 TD game but you still lose 90% of the time.

Federalist Society co-founder calls Trump's tweet about delaying election "fascistic"
Isn‚Äôt trump the one saying that the virus is under control and that it‚Äôs perfectly safe to send students and faculty back to school in under a month, yet now we need to postpone the election until it‚Äôs safe to go out and vote?
I wonder how many people responding to this tweet in defense of trump would do a 180 on this if a Democrat were in office and everything else was equal.
Of course he is serious, he is also very good at distractions - he has used this tactic his entire term. He has no power to delay the election, that falls on Congress.  GOP congresspersons, even McConnell, are already breaking with Trump on this. It's not going to happen.
Trump supporters are a cult and you can‚Äôt convince me otherwise
Is he making this statement to deflect headlines away from that tRump killed Herman Cain at his Tulsa rally?
Trump is a dictator and Biden is a Communist. Thanks America!
I hope you're right, Michael. However, all US Federal Gov. norms, rules and laws have meant nothing for 3.5 years while Trump is in office. Up is down, right is left, night is day. We are in a serious situation. That's why we need great candidates like you. You have my vote.
Usually I like to not mention Trump or give him the time of day, but I'm seeing a lot of people concerned about delaying the election. It has never happened and it never will, not even a civil war delayed the election.  It's just a distraction from the disasterous Q2 GDP numbers.
Unlike the examples I can think of,Trump hasn‚Äôt directly attacked the COTUS. He‚Äôs only insulted it. No judge/justice has the authority to rewrite the 20th amendment. What you propose isn‚Äôt possible. Trump is a crazy mess, not omnipotent.
Herman Cain went to a Trump Rally without a mask...Herman Cain got Covid-19....Herman Cain will not vote in 2020. Wear a mask and you then you will be able to vote. #WearADamnMask
Good ? No elections at all, Congress can‚Äôt meet, etc., then President Pro Tempore of the Senate becomes POTUS. Trump/Pence leave on 1/20/21 at noon, regardless.  Martial law of no help 1) legally Congress must first declare national, (never has happened)  2) COTUS not affected
If trump hadn‚Äôt held his Oklahoma rally.......
This is automatic, Congress either  1) agrees to a delay/postponement-which makes Pelosi POTUS in January  2) doesn‚Äôt, Trump interferes no election- Pelosi is POTUS in January Martial law? Nope a power of Congress too, nationally.  Trump wants U.S. to ignore: Chart NYT 7/30/20
Inhofe says,‚Äù..didn‚Äôt get the required documentation.‚Äù This after our top generals pulled support. In other words, this guy is done: stick a fork in yet another Trump nominee.....
Trump his dipping his toe in the water to see what the national sentiment is to him retaining office beyond his term without reelection. We MUST make it clear we will not even suffer the notion.
Trump should be removed from office today for even suggesting postponing the election this fall.  And if any of our GOP representatives even entertain this idea after their stand during the spring elections, they should be removed, too.
Republicans, now, please, please?
Twitter probably won't do anything so Trump doesn't complain about them
Trump keeps revealing how little he understands U.S. or our Constitution. Only Congress can delay/postpone and election. He should know if Nancy agreed to it, She becomes POTUS 1/20/21 NOON. He should also know if no election Nancy becomes POTUS 1/20/21 NOON... Go for it Donald!
Stop bothering with Trump supporters. It's wasted time and breath.
We understand COVID-19 was a ‚ÄúBlack-Swan‚Äù event. Coupled with the other BS event-Trump‚Äôs EC, election: this IS his fault..... Source: NYT Online, 7/30/20
I don't think Trump has even HEARD of the ConstitutionTurd Squad
My take: I'm not sure it would violate Hatch (because the POTUS is largely exempt from Hatch), but it looks gaudy as all hell. One expects Bill Clinton to pull this move off; which is probably why Trump thinks it's a wonderful idea.
So HUGE.....Trump is replacing obamacare with OBAMACARE.
What leaned today, from Trump‚Äôs press conference. 1. Congress is non-essential. 2. Reporters are worthless.                      3. Trump is the greatest president in our nations history.
Trump's weight is reported to be 243 lbs, but id be shocked if he was under 300lbs. Why lie about that dude, its no biggie, youre a big boy. Not like you can hide that fact anyways. Youre too tall and too wide to be sub 300.
That‚Äôs total crap, he chose to ignore when he was told how bad this was going to be and then did nothing because he thought it was only hitting Democratic lead states first and so he could blame the governors, this is not ‚Äúoh well he tired his best‚Äù Trump does not give a damn
Ive seen brian kilmeade damn near jizz his pant talking to trump
Really can't wait until I election and to get rid of Trump's once and for all.
Trump would go broke after his opening statement
That is because trump is holding his rallies on federal property paid for by us the tax payers where obama made his speach at a function that he was invited to and  NOT paid for by us tax payers
As we transfer from Meg thee Stallion to Meg Thee Stupid. The headline isn't macabre, because it's true. A second Trump term doesn't affect you. For the rest of it, it's a deeply personal issue. Miss me with this idiocy.
Good job Pelosi. Senate Republicans offered to continue it until the relief bill can be agreed on. She said no. Because they think hurting the people and economy makes Trump look bad. The liberal media laps it up. Just like you are.

I thought you have a good friend that supports Trump on some things...is he a tool? I think he‚Äôs a pretty good kid, although I‚Äôm biased üòÇüòÇ
You know the Trump-Axios was bad when even the RNC isn‚Äôt posting clips of it on their various YouTube channels.
Trump pushes that limit everyday he opens his mouth
Trump is a garbage human.  The GOP could have removed him and they chose not to.  Now we remove them!  VOTE!!
Trump will kill so many innocents.  He is mentally and emotionally incapable of being POTUS.  He has surrounded himself with family members and sycophants.  Tragically, many innocent Americans have and will continue to die as a result of Trump‚Äôs criminal incompetence.
God how dumb are all you trumpers just go to the doj web site yes homicides are up in some areas like dc but over all crime is down. Oh sorry i fogot you all do not know how ti looj up facts you just trust everything trump says even thoegh he does nothing but lie

Much better than trump who stole money from a children's cancer charity.
Did you report that the National Organization of Police endorsed Trump. Over 30,000 strong.
This is what happens when the brains behind Trump Steaks gets his grubby orange hands around a Public Institution. He appoints someone woefully unqualified and squeezes the life out of it.
Yeah you tweeted and wrote about Trump and GOP from day one in 2015, you don‚Äôt take a back seat on anyone on educating the public on the topic
I apologize to my children everyday because the Trump stain will last for years.
Remember when Trump tried to send the kids back after Easter?  Same horror show.
He also was the same one encouraged people to take up arms if Trump didn't win in 2016. The man is trash. No change of heart fixes that.
Absolutely they have all ready started the day he got elected. I don‚Äôt think they will get away with it though. Trump is smarter than they are. He‚Äôs always one step ahead of them. I don‚Äôt know what his plan is other than use directive 51 and demand voter ID or something else.
What is your plan?  Trump has NO PLAN.
Absolutely
TRUMP IS BEING REANIMATED! HES COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD!!!! JUST LIKE JESUS!!!!! AMAZIN'

Hillary Clinton told America about Trump. Yet, petulance prevailed. Bernie was stomped out twice and his followers could not be bothered to help the nominee. Garbage.

Well you have no choice sleepy Joe. He has 49% of the black vote now because you have done nothing for the decades you have been in office but fill your pockets and lie to the people. Go back to sleep. We got this election. Trump 2020!
DeathSantis continues to kill worse than any hurricane could.  DeathSantis chose Trump over our health and safety.  DeathSantis mocked the experts and demanded an apology. I demand that DeathSantis RESIGN!  Blood all over his puffy little Trump hands.
DeathSantis chose Trump over Women and Children.  He chose to side with Trump over Scientists, Doctors, EXPERTS.
He was a master at dissing trump without saying trump‚Äôs name.
Why does trump hate TikTok
That picture of the backwoods Trump fans! I won‚Äôt post the picture. I‚Äôm sure you've seen it.
Trump has blown the national debt to the highest levels EVER. He‚Äôs first again. Lol. Now Biden and team will be harassed from Republicans b/c the debt is too high. Same old BS.

Ernst is a dog hater.  She also looked the other way when Trump put kids in cages.  Joni is a bad lady, with bad ideas, and is dangerous for the HEALTH of Iowans.
The way Trump is handling this, is so inhumane.  My heart goes out to the teachers and staff that have to make the decision between working and their health. I am making masks and face shields to send to schools, even though my daughter will be doing school online.
Only if Trump wins.
Rep. Waters' foot is on Trump's ass like back pockets and some of y'all are still complaining.
I've never been a   fan but all the rumors about him promising his best friend  he would not let Trump destroy the country at the very least makes me respect the man  quietly  protecting the world from the spoiled brat with nuclear codes
Imagine a kindergarten room out of control with no teacher? Can you see it in your mind yet? Now the parents insisted on  a teacher So atleast now   can throw a toy in the corner for Trump to play with and distract him while they clean up the destroyed classroom.
Lets make an example to help Trump understand ,China has 1 million cases, US 1 million,the US tests all 1 million and China tests 1 person.Are the other 999,999 any less sick in China? Are the 1 million in America  any more sick solely because someone put a q-tip up there nose?
.Tested or not tested sick is sick.People count crazy things all the time like 54,000 times Donald Trump lied on air.Did you lie any less because it was recorded ? NO you probably have lied 500,000 times and those lies still exist whether counted ,testsd,or recorded.
The ammount of testing does not matter bro. The cases are there either way That's crazy I mean it's like saying Trump won the POPULAR  VOTE.Or Russia did not mess with 2016 election, or injecting yourself with disinfectant or paying strippers or lieing to everyone in the world ?
Wow. Rep. Scalise is a real flunkie for Trump.
Yes I am . My pay checks are bigger. Under the previous admin, I got measly 25 cent/hr pay raises. But under Trump I received a totat of $3/hr in pay raises.
Imagine proudly announcing to the world that you are xenophobic...  Oh wait, Trump probably has no idea what ‚Äùxenophobic" actually means. LMAO
likely made another donation to Trump after today...
Wow. This was a good read. It was borderline enraging to see that we are still dealing with the same shit almost 30 yrs later. -health care reform -prison reform -ban assault rifles Nothing has changed. 2 steps forward, 2 steps back thanks to GWB and Trump.
So Trump wants to delay the election apparently
All the dipshit republicans will vote in person and it will look like a trump victory, but all the smart Dems will have voted absentee and will take it back. Trump will claim victory on evening of 11/3 before absentees can be counted. I‚Äôm terrified.
Then, do your job. Eschew access journalism for actual work. People get tired of disillusioned Trump voter pieces and thinly-veiled coded pieces about Black people. Inform people. Clickbait and nonsense makes the situation worse.
Part of the reason Trump is facing a second term are Berners and third-party dorks. Can't forgive that.  Part of the reason Kamala Harris isn't the nominee are hoteps, Berners, and fake woke asswaffles.  Unforgivable.
Eddie Glaude Marc Lamont Hill Van Jones  The Triumvirate of Trifling were allowed national TV time and platforms to bash HRC, praise Jill Stein and proclaim when Trump became presidential.  There is no rationalizing stupidity.
The funniest thing about the media being played by Trump, are the media complaining about it. Y'all are being played.
Sad the FDA wants more deaths on its hands.  The length that Twitter, FDA, and the left will go, just to try and change the person in the White House is purely disgusting. After Trump wins. I hope he brings back public hangings and punishes those who are trying to kill citizens.
Fauci: social distancing and masks please.  Trump: You‚Äôre fires!  Immanuel: sex with demons might help?  Trump: Brilliant! Here‚Äôs a raise!Biden apologized for that.  He made an incorrect statement and walked it back.  Trump, on the other hand, during one of his long drawn out gatherings, mentioned  A Man who happened to be black as ‚Äúmy black man‚Äù.  It made me so sick at the time.  It exemplified the slave culture.

#unemployment A payroll tax cut has long been a priority for President Trump, even before the Covid-19 crisis. Trump has said that suspending or eliminating the payroll tax‚Äîwhich is paid by both employers and workers to fund Social Security and Medicare

Isn‚Äôt Biden pro abortion...Nuf said. Trump 2020!
Everyone has to make there on choice but for me personally Biden has my vote no matter who he chooses. I trust him to make a sensible decision. And if he chooses Susan Rice or someone else who I may not be keen on they will certainly be better than another 4 yrs of trump/pence.
Kinda like when Bill Maher said he wanted the economy to crash so that Trump wouldn't be elected?  Imagine what they don't admit to you.
More bull shit from Quid Pro Sleeoy Joe Hiden Biden.  DemocRATs are ruining the economy &amp; are trying to blame Trump.  Us real Americans are not as stupid as the libtards.  The silent majority will awaken in November!

It‚Äôs not rocket surgery. If being pro-Clown birthday parties garnered Trump the support, he‚Äôd gladly DON the red ball.
Didn't Trump offer up money for anyone who turns in foreign energies trying to interfere with our elections... Is someone getting a payday or is he only doing that if it's helping Biden?
The thing is...  he basically exposed the GOP for the terrible people they are, and they will never regain their credibility after Trump.  The GOP sacrificed their values, and America will never forget it.

different we all still have commonalities. We're all human. We all have emotion. We all hurt and we all (well most of us) loathe the hell outta Trump.
Trump's plan is not to give states any mandated guidance or funds to operate the schools safely and when it becomes a disaster he'll cherry pick Democratic cities or states and blame them for doing a poor job reopening the schools. He's essentially setting them/us up to fail.
The first time since Darrell Hammond that I have laughed at a Trump impression.
He stopped threatening Guam months before meeting trump. Because they finished testing.
I don‚Äôt often agree with trump, but the deaths per million are on par with leading countries of the world. It‚Äôs a virus and a small proportion of the population will die. That‚Äôs life. To blame him is just political and short-sighted of reality

Wouldn't it be nice if Trump would go away, like 'things'?
Isnt covid 19 unprecedented? Isnt Trump unprecedented? You wont like it even of there was precedent.
Has anyone noticed Trump's big pharma initiative only mentions buying drugs cheap from other countries? Not a word about bringing cost to consumers down.  Seriously.
F'n YouTube was stalling all the way through Trump's terrible COVID update.  Very disappointing, especially during question and answer period.
government so it truly reflects the will of the people. Imagine that? Elected officials who care about the will of the people. I will never consider voting for another republican until everyone who ever supported Trump is out of office. And maybe not then #LincolnVoter
Donald Trump can't read or process this;  absentee ballots and mail-in ballots to mean the same thing: voting by mail, regardless of why. However, many people will use absentee ballots specifically to refer to ballots that are mailed when a person can‚Äôt vote in person! Dah!

I think Biden should debate him. Just to show how faded Trump really is.

I really think Donald Trump being treated like "a comically-bad candidate who could never possibly win, so who cares" allowed a lot of negativity and apathy towards Hillary that Biden, who is also a terrible candidate, is not getting.

Let's be honest though... you're doing the whole false idol thing...even if she didn't mean it that way...she's probably right? If you think Christianity is anything more than a photo op for Trump. You are literally the type of people he loves.. you'll believe anything!!!!

Hey is that Donald Trump?
Yes. I remember.
Trump had people checking him early on. He didn't get Barr until year 3. And RBG, sad to say, I have a hard time seeing her not needing to be replaced on the SCOTUS in the next 4 years given all her health issues and age, which swings it massively to conservatives.
I think this is the most important election of my life and maybe for American history. We're going to slip into an authoritarian state if we have to suffer for more years of Trump.
There's a lot of good faith items that people assumed would be done that Trump isn't following because our founding fathers assumed we wouldn't elect a steaming pile of shit, but there are certain things spelled out very directly and one of those is when a President's term ends.
I know if feels like Trump is breaking all kind of laws but he's still operating within what the constitution allows. The GOP isn't removing him from office, but they can't stop Democrats from impeaching for example. His term is done Jan 20th per the constitution.
He'd have to win by massive margins for that and the polling doesn't support that in any way. If Trump were to win, he's barely winning like he did in 2016.
My bigger concern is the things Trump is doing to attack the post office to prevent / slow down mail in voting and foreign interference which I don't think has in any way been adequately addressed. Its things that would lead to Trump winning the vote.
We don't know that an election will be corrupted. The GOP took a bath in the 2018 election. I think voting Trump out is far more advisable than a coup. If you did that, you're all but inviting a civil war.
Is trump this smart though? Who's the real mastermind here?
admittedly has a propensity to mangle his words, but it's amusing that whatever "sin" he's ever accused of doing, Trump objectively does 10x+ worse. The performative outrage directed Biden's way when the comparative is Trump is amusing.
Just your average evangelical who now needs to ask you for money so he can tell you how not to stain your life with adulterous affairs.  Oh, and he is a major Trump supporter...swine do act alike...
Simply false. LOL.  Biden has articulated a solid vision for the country. And the economy *always* performs better under Democrats. Always.   More importantly, it's literally not possible to bungle the pandemic response worse than Trump has.
Axios unquestioning accepted the claim that Biden wrote the explanatory tweets. No way in hell did that happen.  If by some miracle a debate ever happened, I'd love Trump to challenge Joe.."Joe! Pull out your phone and put up a tweet. If you can do it, I'll drop out of the race!"

Reaction to Biden picking Harris as running mate
Experts expected Biden to choose Harris who brings a wealth of experience.
Biden, 77, pitched his former primary rival as a smart, tenacious figure who will help him defeat Trump in November. The 55-year-old Harris is making history as the first black woman on a national major party ticket.

It‚Äôs mystifying to Trump that Joe Biden could have someone criticize him harshly in a debate and *gasp* get over it!

Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
So a day after Biden picks his VP we're all just gonna a start shitting on them as much we do about Trump? Is this not counter productive? The goal is to remove Trump. Please don't convince people to vote for him... Like yeah, JB/KH are shitty, 45 is worse. Now I'm nervous üò¨üò¨üò¨

I mean no doubt Biden is bad, and racist indeed... but like, rich of Trump to accuse Biden of having a racism problem.
Also, I love how I got to listen to someone close to me call someone online a fa***t, but yet I'M the problematic one for not living Kamala Harris and Biden, neither of whom have done nothing wrong ever.
Make no mistake. Harris was choosen months ago. Her delayed announcement was to keep a dementia riddled Biden out of the lime light. He will be a complete puppet of the DNC. He will push their national agenda to disarm POC to &amp; continue buying elections for the DNC on the basis,
LOL No. He won't and shouldn't. The choice in November is America or Trump and that's why Biden will win by a lot.
‚ÄúI was a little surprised that he picked her,‚Äù President Donald Trump said during a press conference at the White House. ‚ÄúShe did very, very poorly in the primaries.‚Äù

Noticed GOP hasn't pushed Tara Reade story to damage Biden. Why not?  Despite Blasey-Ford, Kavanaugh is on the bench. Despite numerous rape accusations, Trump is in the white house.  Is there a gray area I missed, here. Was Reade's allegation dropped due to lack of evidence?
What is the game plan if you‚Äôre not voting for Biden? Like I get having the moral high ground is nice and all, but what is the second option here?
Biden‚Äôs attempt to pander to everyone is a sure case of self destruction if you ask me. Now he‚Äôs going after the diehard democrats who he needs to get any votes. He‚Äôs estranged every other group of American people there is.
He‚Äôs headed for the ditch on the wrong side of the road. So he can get his pic took. In a dumb fuckin face mask. And there are actually people who would elect him? For anything? Ok then. I will vote for Biden to be hall monitor at nursing home.
He‚Äôs the best of the best democrat. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all the have. And from an outsider looking in at the Democratic Party, they‚Äôre probably right. They have nobody nothing else, anywhere.The likes of Nadler Pelosi Schumer Biden and many others have made sure of that. THEY STINK

Biden comes running into the first debate, juggling three balls, says "My these are big balls", drops them, grabs two bottles of water, drinks them both, says "look, one in each hand, easy", takes His place at the podium, looks at Donald and says, "whatcha got for that BITCH!?"
The haymaker Colbert lands here is 1000 times heavier than anything Harris landed on Biden in that debate. It charts on a seismograph.

There is truth to what you say, and if Biden were running against a Mccain or a Romney, I'd probably vote 3rd party, but Trump is crazy unhinged.
Sure, but to conflate the two is just...I don't even know. I am NOT a fan of Biden, but Trump is an enabler of extremism.  He needs to go.

I love the hubris of liberals.... I swear. How do you know the people who showed up to vote for Nader would have voted for Gore?   If Biden and Trump were my only options in Nov, I'd just stay home.   PS- Liberals love Bush.
Stop playing his game.  Focus, people.  Remember the real issues.  Vote Biden-Harris 11/3/20.

You don‚Äôt have to be crazy about him. A vote for Biden is a vote for an end to the chaos. I‚Äôm not crazy for him either but I‚Äôm showing up on Nov 3.
Oh that‚Äôs hysterical, you thinking you have a shot at turning NY red. That‚Äôs like saying Biden thinks he has a shot at turning Texas blue. Wait...
WisDems is having a weekend of action on 8/29-30 where we‚Äôll be calling voters to help elect Biden-Harris as well as Dems up and down the ticket. Sign up at the link below!
Trump is upset b/c Biden said it should be a mandate everyone should wear a mask. It Trump hadn't called the Pandemic a hoax so many people wouldn‚Äôt be fighting wearing mask. Trump causes more problems than solutions. Nice someone is being a leader.

No, Joe Biden can't ban voucher schools in Wisconsin
When I see people talking about voting for Biden/Harris, it always feels like someone telling a vegetarian that the all-meat restaurant they are going to is fine because "they have a black bean burger"
Biden opposes vouchers, but experts say the president wouldn't have the authority to halt a program authorized and funded by the state.

I know I've been pretty anti Biden but here's some pro Joe propaganda that I enjoyed reading
I chose to interpret it as a gratuitious Biden-Harris endorsement.
You really think that? I'm not as confident in Biden winning as some are, but I can't really see this being a Trump landslide.
Un, didn't Sunrise Movement just endorse Biden. Me soooo confuseded!
Biden 2020 right there!! Lol
My guess is an anarchist that supports Biden this election to kick out Trump
2020 Pres Candidates as NFL QBs   Biden: Ryan Fitzpatrick. Old White placeholder who hasn‚Äôt done much in terms of success  Harris: Tua Tagovailoa. Young potential non-white  ‚Äúsuperstar‚Äù in waiting  Trump: Roethlisberger. Repulsive, rapey, but has a few W‚Äôs.   Pence: Jake Fromm
No, Joe Biden can't ban school choice vouchers in Wisconsin (though he's strongly against them). We rate this claim False, after a quick stopover to examine the pseudo-news site spreading this claim.
Certainly seems like Biden will likely lose
Biden and Heels Up Harris can kiss my a**! Both cheeks.
Haha, when will the "press" ask Biden a question...about Antifa...or anything??? That is a good one!!
Biden, to a screaming Jim Boylen just offstage: "Listen bald . . ."
I would not be surprised if the Biden Harris group said you two ask a question, we won't reply but it will show the "press" is asking ???'s. #suchafarce
It's remarkable, and  just nodded and gleefully invited the nitwit back.  I mean, really. What possibly could a voter "learn" about Biden now and actually say, "Yeah, Trump has flaws, but NOTHING like that!" ????  Do better, CNN.  #TrumpFailedAmerica
I‚Äôm guessing that the people who think I can be shamed into voting for Biden have never purchased a fucking Groupon for dental care. Sorry motherfuckers but I have no shame left!
So this "chicken or shit&amp;glass" analogy is the newest way libs are dismissing criticisms of Biden as ludicrously petty.  But it ignores that badly cooked chicken can kill you &amp; it ignores what critics are actually saying - the chicken is stuffed w/ shit&amp; glass.

Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris - CNN  via
Your role in this is to vote &amp; to engage others--not the Trumpsters who are too far gone but all the people who think Kamala isn't sufficiently progressive or Biden isn't Bernie or voting is a hassle. Stop trying to win over Trump fans &amp; start working on the passive &amp; undecided.
The appeal to "suburban housewives," the threat that Biden will "hurt God," the promise that "Christianity will have power"--Trump is publicly manipulating religion, fear, and racism. Meanwhile, we're joking about how he pronounces Yosemite or how much orange makeup he's wearing.
I just heard a pundit on CNN say that the big gap in the polls right now is because voters don't know enough about Biden.  Do these crackpots listen to themselves? By what barometer will Biden -- a two-term VP, by the way -- lose support to Trump over the next 10 weeks?
The ads on TV for Trump and against Biden are disgusting. Truly disgusting.
point on  about Joe Biden's MAGA POV is so relevant. When I saw him speak in MKE I was surprised and disappointed by Biden's Americentric, patriotism/nationalism.
Also, I think  is at the point in listenership and subscribers where they can afford to edit in the actual clip of Joe Biden asking if his interviewers are junkies or at least play it off your phoneNo. Biden can do what he wants...DJT follows zero rules.  Greta, we know you are a Trumper, why make it so obvious?  Still have mailboxes? KANYE?   Some of us want a non-corrupt future POTUS.   He JUST complained about Biden and no questions, you are just echoing what HE wants.
Biden tell us to wear mask. Dude should practice what he preaches.  It's ok to kiss kali moms tried lips he wanted to hugs get a little dam pervert. They blocked him with not opening thier arms to him. He had to touch kiss. He needs a test . Or quit
Biden picking Kamala. Is a DESPERATE MOVE
It sounds like you‚Äôve had Biden on ‚Äútop secret probation‚Äù. Benghazi all over again.  Six years of investigation resulting in nothing.  Republican credibility is in the toilet and will be for years. Keep kissing Trumps ass you‚Äôll go far.
Some ass signed me up for every Biden email in existence
You know Obama and Biden have done that too...
So Obama blamed all issues on Bush and claims all of Trump's successes are because of him. Biden learned from the best...or someone did. He ain't learning nothing.
Great deal by Obama and Biden.

Taiwanese media is buying into Biden is pro China stuff, they have no idea the BS we have to go through daily with Trump.
We love it. We had a Biden sign there but dozens of reports of stolen signs the last few days.
I'll start taking Biden seriously when he over explains the wonder of rain /s
Oh the delusion. Can you back that up? Trump spoke unscripted for several hours and Biden can‚Äôt read a teleprompter
I chose D. I don't like Biden At. All. But I'm viewing him as the tourniquet - he won't solve any of the underlying problems, but he'll hopefully stop the bleeding long enough that we can take a deep breath and get started on the surgery.
Yeah I think Biden is a doofus too ;^)

If it‚Äôs too dangerous due to COVID19 to host an in-person DNC in Milwaukee, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris should probably stop parading around in public on the East Coast. We‚Äôre losing millions of dollars because he didn‚Äôt come to accept the nomination here.

biden and kamala are both FAR from ideal but i‚Äôll be voting for the 150,000 people in this country who died from trumps incompetence because i genuinely don‚Äôt believe we can survive another 4 years under this administration
i am what would be considered far left but i do mot give a fuck who Biden vp is all i need is not orange shit
If you were saying ACAB last month but support Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP pick you don‚Äôt really believe that all cops are badü•¥
Well hopefully in Nov you can help take care of this and the MANY other problems left from the current administration that you &amp; Biden will have to deal with!  Congratulations &amp; Biden made a great choice!!
So Biden (who I would argue is a cop, because of the 94 crime bill) picked Kamala Harris, ANOTHER COP  so our choices are Trump pence (authoritarian dictatorship) or TWO COPS.   Fuck america

Excellent choice in Harris for Biden. She'll make a great VP when sworn in next January.
Excellent choice. Historic choice. America's choice. Could not be happier.
Wait til the debates! When Biden has to speak out of his basement! People will realize he's got dementia! Can you say Trump Relected! If he's such a strong candidate, why has he not left his basement?
Yeah I'll suck it up and vote Biden in my swing state to stop the bleeding. But what we all should focus on is downballot - elect enough progressives that we can put M4A on Biden's desk and call his goddamn bluff.

Biden wants to redirect funding. This is less extreme than abolishing the police. Police are over funded and have been given too much power. If we redirect some (not all) resources towards community programs, we can improve communities instead of over policing them.
He‚Äôll never do it.  For the same reason Biden will never be allowed to debate Trump.
I think I‚Äôm sane, but will NOT be voting for Biden. Can‚Äôt vote for anyone that supports abortions.
Joe Biden trying to distance himself from his record while trying to run on his record will be the most Joe Biden thing in the history of Joe Biden üòÜ
Based on Biden‚Äôs latest series of TV ads, does Obama know that from 2008-2016, Joe was actually POTUS, Commander in Chief, head honcho, the big cheese, etc., and not him?
This is LITERALLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VOTING TRUMP AND BIDEN FOR ME
Of what benefit would a debate be for Joe Biden. There is no upside.I‚Äôm not a Trump fan but It‚Äôs laughable that you believe the stifling restrictions put in place by Obama/Biden would equal economic prosperity.  Google ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be a dumbass‚Äù...then follow the instructions on not being a dumbass.
when Biden talks he screws up
O‚ÄôReilly?  The only way you Trump/Putin types have a chance of winning is if enough Sanders folks stay home because they are not thinking clearly.  They think that there isn‚Äôt a dimes worth of difference between Trump/Putin and Biden/Harris.  Thanks for waking them up!
driving around the cabin last weekend and I saw SO MANY T/P signs. It was sickening. Only two Biden signs the entire drive home. This weekend I drove into town and was so happy to see all the Biden signs! I wanted to knock and thank them for not being racist!
Biden will when he‚Äôs president!
Best case scenario is Biden doing two terms. We need a break from dem presidential primaries
Love Joe Biden and Kamala Harrisüëç

If biden wins he will appoint obama to supreme court that alone we need trump reelected and win congress and senate wake up Republicans, independent.and democrats who aren't for this far left bullshit..TRUMP 2020
This is great. How can people be so blind? Common sense needs to prevail.... oh wait some of us can‚Äôt admit we are wrong - seriously - how do people justify following Biden
I just find the echo chamber of far left Twitter overly indulgent and annoying. By any rationale measure (fundraising, media,  organization) the Biden campaign is firing on all cylinders but this edgelord needs to üí© all over it to get likes from üåπTwitter
Bernie endorsed Biden enthusiastically
I mean, it would appear she's doing a pretty good job with Biden's campaign.
How is it that he can say in public to Americans...I'm not going to ALLOW mail in voting.  I'm not going to wait to have them counted and Biden isn't winning. I'm having a the mailboxes removed....WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY PUTTING THEM?  HE IS SO FAR GONE THAT HE THINKS ITS OKAY?!?
Trump will be coming to Oshkosh to speak in person and Biden will hold an online conference. Please, for the love of God do not take this as a sign of weakness on Biden‚Äòs part! There‚Äôs a pandemic and he‚Äôs doing his part to keep you and himself safe.
Let‚Äôs just say in a magical world everyone‚Äôs vote manages to gets to the proper places. Will enough votes be counted to declare Biden the winner. Don‚Äôt think trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan for votes recieved.

Take note that the Democrat Biden-Harris duo's solutions to the "Rona" all involve mandating, to wit forcing the fiefs in the fiefdom, to do something or else. That's their way.

Lol you do realize Biden isn't president yet and hasn't implemented any rules?
And obviously a lot of that‚Äôs down to Biden‚Äôs weakness as a candidate but THIS IS HOW YOU DO CROSSGENERATIONAL APPEAL. Not babbling about your car for a solid minute to an audience of boomer dads who haven‚Äôt voted Dem in over a decade and then adding an aside about electric cars
I would like Mr Pres. not to mention Biden/Harris at all, act as if they don't exists. Dont plant their names in the citizens ears. Talk about leading the country forward, rebuilding the economy, taking a stand on police reform and support, ending anarchy and Covid. MAGA!

Every day, Biden and Harris should do video where they just point at him and laugh. That would make my day.   Video of him saying his usual stupid stuff. Followed with transition pointing and laughing.  The stupid is so strong in him.  No hash/tags or images in comments.

If biden steps down harris takes president isn't speaker of house vp automatically so harris don't get to pick !!!!!!
The only reason biden picked a black woman as vp is for black vote but it's con.he don't care about blacks he's a racists .but he'll drop out she'll take over as president but then pelosi we'll be vp..it crazy and dangerous for true americans  please think before voting for kids

Well I doubt Biden is gonna pick her. I like her and think she‚Äôd be an excellent choice for VP.   Karen Bass, a Physician Assistant during the AIDS crisis, talks about the coronavirus.
The last person I‚Äôd pick to fly around and meet with world leaders trying to mend wounds created by trump is Pete! I can think of many ppl Biden could pick that would actually qualify &amp;perform well! Not Pete.
I had to let go of Hillary in 2008,16,&amp;20. I had to let go of Beto,&amp;my hope for Him to be the nominee,VP or maybe ever elected to office because -well he‚Äôs a white man. I‚Äôve learned to look for all the good in Biden so I can happily support him,but please don‚Äôt push Pete on me!
I cry too. We‚Äôre watching trumps plan to sabatoge US mail, preventing delivery. With HIS rule a ballot won‚Äôt count after 11-3. I‚Äôm disappointed that Biden hasn‚Äôt held frequent press conferences alerting voters. He should hold 1 of His own presser after all trumps Covid rallies!
Shocking that a‚Äùpresident‚Äùis openly aloud to abuse His powers to interfere with the delivery of the mail to win an election. Why Isn‚Äôt there ppl pounding the streets in outrage? BIDEN should be holding press conferences on this DAILY! Illegal?UnConstitutional? Will his win stand?
why are biden and trump even wasting time on political ads this year. is there ANYONE out there still actually making their mind up???
I live in WI. As most know I stay in many of our state parks &amp;moped through back woods roads of rural WI. There are always plenty of trump signs,even big banners. I‚Äôve seen 2 Biden signs this summer. So far I‚Äôve ridden 600 miles through extremely rural back roads this summer. Sad
Hasn't NC shown a steady lead for both Biden and Cal?
Of course not! Biden is, rightly, only vetting FEMALE candidates!
One of Biden's most valuable assets is in choosing the women from whom he will choose as his running mate. He's shown more acumen in that than UShitlermurderer and his whole GOP Gestapo team since taking office.
If we start using a Benghazi standard to judge our politicians, then we need to get rid of UShitlermurderer, all his supporters and appointees yesterday  BBC News - Biden VP pick: Susan Rice, the diplomat and lightning rod
A non Biden vote is a vote for Trump fascist tyranny! Trump hates democracy and has already managed to destroy much of it! #BlueTsunami2020
Biden by the way by default will be the most Progressive President we have ever had. There will be plenty of Progressive voices if you listen.
This is not vote shaming.  This is how things work in the USA.  CA is like TX.  If Biden wins TX we have 450 EC votes and vice versa.  If someone votes for the Green Party in 20 some states they are really voting for frying the earth next decade.  Trump2 will do that!

90 minutes of looking at, listening to Trump, that's too long. Make sure candidates are drug tested before debates. Bipartisan watchdogs to never let candidates out of sight for a moment, such as bathroom breaks! Trump's counting on tiring Biden, 90 mins?
So why do people in either side support and love Biden or Trump so much? Like to the point of defending a person you‚Äôve never met and believe in everything they say?

Do read this unpleasant crap about crappers üëøHi Rick. I know that the Lincoln Project is supporting Biden (I don‚Äôt want Trump to be POTUS for 4 more years).  Will members of the Lincoln Project still stay true to their Republican values after the election? I‚Äôve seen this question asked on social media a lot.
This quite possibly the dumbest thing I have ever seen. It looks an ad for a middle school student council election. Can I add something? "Vote Biden if you would like to be first in line for the cafeteria...if you would like to have less homework"
#Biden campaign is unhinged? I like unhinged!! The reason I say I'm not voting is because some stuff was taken away in the beginning of 2016 and then brought back a couple months later. I can't take heart break! I'm only steel cage when things go right. Young un's, it's yer turn!
I'd rather take my chance on Biden and Harris than another 4 years of trump! Trump the world IS laughing at you!!!!

Biden and Harris. Boy! It sure is fun to see hope return to the country.
I don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden either, but I live in a swing state that barely voted for Trump in 2016, so I probably will. Not exactly thrilled but I expected this.
Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris proves that he is not a moderate, and he will be controlled by the radical left if elected. My fellow conservatives, it's time to unite and ensure Biden and Harris never make it to the White House.
Sen. Kamala Harris is the first Black woman and first Asian American person on a major party's presidential ticket
I disagree Biden can only beat Trump under the "blue no matter who umbrella"
The dog can put a sentence together better than Hiden Biden!Why does Biden even matter?  Think hard about the last few months before you answer
Also it does nothing ro discredit biden or the clintons or even any others that were close with him and continued his legacy. The race baiting is the same as always but now it has. M9re angles. Black supremicists, brown, or even people who are (sexual preference) supremicists.
Can anyone give me a reason why biden deserves my vote without mentioning trump?
If that is an example of your grasp of critical thinking then you belong with Biden
Yup. I think it's great that Biden looked beyond old white men of means.  Imagine an America where candidates, employees, etc aren't notable for gender, race, religion, sexual identity et al. Wouldn't that be amazing? They're all just people. None judged. Just people.
Trump has been careful to respect states rights, yet he is called a tyrant. The first thing biden and kamala support is authoritarian b.s. i think most people that are honest with themselves will be saying orangemans not that bad.
They judge everyone by how they look. It is sad. Thats why biden thinks if you wont vote for him you aint black. I wonder if thats how you get white privledge! Id give it to em. Lol
Joe Biden called the China travel ban xenophobic. Your racist sex offender running mate doesn‚Äôt get a do over and your lack of ethics is showing.
Biden kept our country in stagnant wages while him and democrat/neocon cronies pieced out our economy and sold it to china. He had almost 50 years to do something worthwhile and ruined it worst at every chance.
Good thing it‚Äôs a Biden rally and Election Day voting. If they were voting they would be super spreaders of COVID. But they are safe because it‚Äôs just a Democrat rally.
Like a lot of people on Twitter, I'm not a big fan of Biden and Harris, and I didn't want either of them to be in this position. But you're a damn fool if you think they, and the people theyll bring with won't be much better for America than another 4 years of terror from Trump.
Congratulations! Soon, I will be honored to vote for you and Biden. Looking forward to seeing you debate pence!
He is so right on helping retired single households that lost a partner it is so important!  They need more then half of their total ss benifits
And democrats keep voting for people that watch citizens die in the streets while they live it up. Pelosis district is disgusting yet expensive to live there. The left has ruined every place they have a foot hold. Cant wait to see obama hilary amd biden in cuffs.
Kamala harris is trash. Biden i senile, people watch donald trump lies on msm and believe he is everythin that the democrats do. It is an obviosline of crap. With biden have many sexual assualts and harris being a good democrat soldier.
He spent his life passing racist policies to make single parent black homes and fighting for foreign aid which he later gets a kickback from in the form of his son hunter biden getting no show jobs that pay millions. Russian oligarchs were recently raided by the fbi.
Not to mention Lindsey Graham who has disgraced the memory of his supposed best friend John McCain to kiss up to a coward like Donald Trump who claims McCain wasn't a war hero and mocks his service. Sure Harris and Biden had a moment but nothing like the kiss ass Republicans!!
I think he should have just announced her as his VP pick when the Black Lives Matter Black/Brown people picked Harris it was clear if he didn‚Äôt pick her they would not support him if Rice was picked there would be a revolt I am voting for the Biden/Harris

Biden/kamala is more extreme than George McGovern in '72. It shall not be another blow-out but it will be very close with third parties doing well. Possible Twelve amendment results.   Winning control of Congress is mandatory this cycle.

STEALING BIDEN CAMPAIGN SLOGAN!
He wouldn't be up to a demanding job. I'm sure he'd agree... in fact, he's been retired for nearly fifteen years.  With Biden we're in a "who's kidding whom?" moment. He looks physically diminished and, unlike my new friend, Biden also looks mentally diminished. It happens.
I just came home from a golf outing. I played with a man who will turn 80 in October. In other words, he's only about two years older than Joe Biden.  He was very nice and still pretty sharp, and we had a good time. But he's also obviously old and physically weakened by age.
Never-Trumpers:  I'm sitting here listening to Anthony Scaramucci make an utter fool of himself on Steve Hilton's show on Fox, trying to defend his support for Biden.  If you ever needed proof these Trump-hating "neo-cons" are insane, this has been it!  Zero credibility.
I think fox has been testing the waters and is preparing  for rejection or acceptance  into the new prevailing winds of november. Their top office people donate to Biden,  I hear. After Trump  wins I think he may change the play book . So far fox is neutral  to left it seems?

I keep getting ads in YouTube about how Biden is far to the left and that poses a danger to families. And it's like bitch where? Where's this far left you speak of
I was thinking the same thing. She was out fast and was like BIDEN! LETS GOOOOO!!
She is a sellout. Look into what she actually thinks of Biden... guess she‚Äôs OK with sexual misdoncut and racism, now that she‚Äôll be VP
All he needs to do his bring up how she thinks Biden is a racist and that she believes his accusers. She is a sellout. He had so many better options
Does she still believe Biden‚Äôs accusers? Think he is racist?? Not anymore because it‚Äôll help her career
She thinks Biden is a racist and believes his accusers, far away from who I would invent. She is in it for her own career, not the people she serves
Well I'm at least glad for one thing.  We no longer have to hear news stories about how Biden is going to announce his VP choice tomorrow.
She is an absolute sellout. Thinks Biden is a racist but will be his VP gladly. She‚Äôs in it for herself not the people
She hurt the black communities of California and laughed about it. So many better options and Biden picked her
She is a sellout! Does she still think Biden is a racist?? Absolutely appalling
He should‚Äôve picked Val Demings. Kamala is a clear sellout who has attacked Biden for his very controversial past
She is an absolute sellout. She thinks Biden is a racist, but will be his VP? Shows where her priorities are huh
She is such a sellout. Anything for political prowess. She clearly had her opinions about Biden, but anything for more power! Ridiculous
Terrible choice. Val Demings was the way to go but when has Biden ever been that on top of his game. Makes me worried for November
I don‚Äôt support trump. I think Biden would‚Äôve been better suited selecting Rep. Val Demings. But to each their own...
She is a sellout... repeatedly emphasized that she thought Biden was a racist and sexual predator. Anything for power I guess...
She is a total sellout. Just months ago she believed Biden‚Äôs accusers and pinned him down for his remarks on segregation.
She will do anything for power. Months ago she called Biden a racist and that she believed his accusers. Total sellout!
Anything to move up politically. Just months ago she thought Biden was a racist and said she believed his sexual misconduct accusers.

Because Biden and his team are still more or less operating as if this is a normal election cycle.

Someone asked me to tell them why I'm voting for Joe Biden without mentioning trump or Republicans and the heinous things they're doing. I said because I want Kamala Harris to be president and if this is the way she gets there then I'm voting for Joe Biden.
in regards to the Biden ad spend. Would Hulu ads be considered digital spend or traditional tv spend. Just curious.
I don‚Äôt know anyone supporting Joe. I only know people saying anyone but Trump. There is literally zero enthusiasm for Biden.
I‚Äôd love to see an article now of a reporter from Sioux City spending a week talking to people in New York City or Los Angeles about why they support Biden.
I imagine they would want a spineless jellyfish like Biden as president!
Election night will be wonderful to see Green Party go over 5%.  I don't want to see a Trump win but to be honest a Biden loss would be sweet as apple pie.
I know some strong Bernie supporters and strong leftists but I know they are thinking about voting Biden just to remove Trump.   They don't want to but are so concerned about another 4 years of this asshole.   I do understand them but the Dems need to go get their votes elsewhere
üá∫üá∏ President  and Republicans will always stand with our men and women in law enforcement and against Joe Biden‚Äôs radical calls to defund the police.  üá∫üá∏ We need 4 more years of President Trump to preserve law and order.  #LeadRight #KAG #Trump2020
All of the white dudes on his staff that want Biden to pick Rice so they have a way back in.
Anyone saying they know who Biden has picked as a running mate or they know when Biden will announce is LYING.
I'm obviously NOT voting for Biden LMFAO... But I'm torn between wanting to vote Jo Jo or Trump. I feel Trump has let us all down, he constantly caves into liberals. I feel Jo Jo would be different, the Maverick we all want. Fuck the system!
Dude, I don't even know if Trump is going to get to debate Biden at this point, but BY ALL MEANS PLEASE #LetHerSpeak I'm libertarian by heart and I know this is a decisive election AND I live in a major swing state. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE MY FOLLOWERS! Tell me your opinion.
Breaking:  Biden starts everyday asking his team if he picked his VP yet.
I've been on edge for almost 4 god damn years and I refuse to stand by and watch Joe Biden blow this.
If VP were just in charge of foreign policy or if Joe Biden's polling with Black, Latino and Asian voters were higher than Hillary's I would agree.  The problem is he needs to win and win big to overcome all the shenanigans that the trump campaign are going to engage in.
Pence will be in Wisconsin on Wednesday, August 19, the night presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's vice presidential pick is scheduled to speak.
What exactly Biden‚Äôs response? He‚Äôs a non-government official sitting in his basement.
Biden can comfortably say whatever he wants to say because people like you will always come to his aid. Am sure if it was a "R" that was at the back of his name you will be taking a different positionDO NOT FORGET: In 2013, Joe Biden and Hunter Biden flew aboard Air Force Two to China. Ten days later, Hunter Biden‚Äôs firm inked a $1,500,000,000.00 deal with a subsidiary of the Communist Chinese government‚Äôs Bank of China.
Nancy Pelosi or joe Biden will assume office in January 21st 2021 whether he likes it or not. When he loses he‚Äôs gone.

Speak up if you want law and order. Democrats support the looting of formerly great American Cities. Why haven‚Äôt the Dem Mayors stopped the violence?    Biden is an enabler not a solution.
Democrats DONT CARE. Why aren‚Äôt they working?  Biden promises will make you poor again. More taxes ok with you?  A failed stock market due to a Biden victory will destroy your small business opportunities; you will be broke and obliged to Government regulations. Vote Trump in!
Not a housewife, but a suburban woman who is voting for Biden/Harris. In my community, lots of suburban housewives and women are, as well.
The fake Republican platform is a billion times better than anything Biden will ever do.
Trump will probably win with a similar result. Biden cleaning up in the cities but rurals going hard Trump.

This will be interesting. All Trump supporters I know are excited by the Kamala pick. Her past and her hypocrisy will be highlighted. I was genuinely surprised to see the support. It is an uphill battle now for Biden.
As a conservative roaming in the wilderness and looking for a reason to vote Biden, Duckworth ain‚Äôt it.  Don‚Äôt like her and can‚Äôt explain why.
I hope Biden waits for Trump to come out to his daily propaganda dump and then announces the name. My guess is everyone (but FoxNews of course) cuts away from Trump.

I know biden was strong on Isis. And was cautious about adding troops and aiding our allies. But ignoring the advice of NATO and giving favors to Russia and Afghanistan is not a good political strategy. Russia has annexed Crimea, is at war with Ukraine, and desires more control

if you can't see cynical manipulation staring you in face by a pro-biden pac (not a jewish communal organization) calling itself "jewish-unity"...  biden will get somewhere bet 65 &amp; 80% of jewish vote &amp; thats fine, but dont go labelling us in the minority as against jewish unity
from the great minds that gave us "if your black &amp; dont support biden you aren't a real black" comes "if your jewish and dont support biden you aren't a real jew."
thats implication of this tweet in support of a pro-biden pac that self-anointed itself "jewish-unity". i guess if i oppose biden i oppose jewish unity?  does that make me not a real jew  its frankly offensive &amp; i hope biden supporting jews see thru it

Damn near convinced me to vote for Biden. I say damn near cause fuck that's a tough pill to swallow. Like the idea has me bitter but you make A REALLY solid case.
Both Biden and Harris are running on illegal platforms.  They shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to run at all.  They‚Äôre criminals.
I see it a lot. Kind of can‚Äôt fix stupid. Looking forward to a Biden presidency ‚ù£Ô∏è
She‚Äôs just as bad as joe Biden. Get her out
garbage take ben! biden's comments were silly, but they were courageous (he stood against his jew hating base &amp; obama-era "advisors") + signified he doesn't want to make a political issue out of middle east peace. which is 100% right &amp; should be supported
biden's praising the deal was an act of courage given his jew hating base.  his claiming credit was of course ridiculous, but maybe he gets a pass here for showing at least a hint of spine.
What year was this made? It looks like it was made for an 80‚Äôs movie about how animation would be in the future. And no one gives a crap about trains...it‚Äôs 2020. When was the last time you even rode in a train? And why wouldn‚Äôt Biden just take a plane, like a normal person?
Voters pick Biden?  What kind of sick morons do we have in this country?  Where‚Äôd you take the poll‚ÄîNYC?
We critique Biden and every conservative troll comes out of nowhere like "U THINK UR TOO GOOD TO VOTE FOR BIDEN HUHHHHHHH? U THINK UR BETTER THAN ME AND THE DNC? HUH?????" like relax I can critique the guy because I don't blindly follow my leader like he's God
This is a good middle of the road statement &amp; good on joe for issuing it knowing it would disappoint the rabid Jew haters in his base  But man oh man does it come so so close to recognizing how Trump putting annexation on the table (that biden criticized him for) led to the deal
dont play dumb  everyone knows that haley is on deck for gop nomination  biden had a number of good candidates w/ far less baggage that harris -- he box checking certainly was a big factor
a lebanese street that rejects hezbollah is one that is almost certainly less interested in anti-israel demagoguery thats a big shift.  trump's squeeze on iran has helped put hezbollah into a corner.  will biden really offer them a life raft?  hard to imagine...
if you look at the big picture, the regional rivals are turkey, sa and iran (israel is a regional actor, but doesn't have interest in controlling lebanon or syria).  you'll recall trump was surprising acquiescing to saudi rival erdogan.  would biden have been?
but the most likely outcome of a biden presidency is continuation of the generally pro-saudi us foreign policy that was our norm for decades before obama and that trump restored.
i dont think biden has the same attachments as obama had to iran. biden is likely emotionally far more in line with long standing american/saudi partnership.  he's gonna have to make some gestures towards restoring jcpoa and he'll have people around him who are true believers..
i mean this feels kind of tinfoil hat but the main thing thats changed vis biden is he selected the relatively sympathetic to israel harris over the more hostile to israel rice. but i dont see how to spin that into a theory as rice will still play prominent role (sec state?)
i'm still not sure what this means. open alliance w israel allows iran to portray mbs as a muslim sell out, that doesn't help him.  quiet alliance was never in jeopardy.  how any of this helps vis a biden presidency (which he has to be anticipating) i dont get the theory
this is the real reason biden picked kamala, to pre-empt these stories had nikki haley been first indian american on ticket in 2024
I like my suburb.  I like my synagogue / day schools / faith community. If Biden wins, I can‚Äôt keep those things.  Trump could shoot someone on fifth avenue (which is less unusual then it used to be fwiw) and I would still vote for him.
genuinely curious if this hinged on biden picking Harris (who isn‚Äôt particularly interested in foreign policy) over Iranian Asset Susan Rice, who would‚Äôve taken it personally and settled scores if she perceived uae + israel and doing something that could help Trump
"If you don't vote for my preferred candidate, you hate the country and the constitution" is essentially the propaganda you're trying to force on people lol.  If you think Biden or Trump are the solution, you're part of the problem unfortunately.
Trumps website is a store or his official election website has only a donation page. There is no policy whatsoever. Biden‚Äôs has a real plan for America. Trump has nothing to offer!!
well she's clearly really black because she supports biden and i'm told thats the measure of it
i dont think its overly cynical to suspect that newsweak decided to amplify him / his pet issue to help Biden tho
well then why did he write it then exactly?  team biden is desperate for any hint of racism directed at kamala so they can make her more palatable to the working class black voters who passed on her in the primaries bc she built her career locking their kids up. why help them?
i dunno man.  the left has nominally been coopted by globalists (biden &amp; harris), but they seem rightfully confident that they will get their red meat too  its very predictable that we are going to now do our best to draw lots of little tiny circles &amp; insist anyone outside..  1/
It took me straight to Biden! Only on Goo__le. Not duck duck go though.
guys remember the key thing about mail in ballots is they aren't secret.  your kids want to try to vote biden? #disown.  grandma likes joe?  she can do her own damn shopping in the middle of covid.  wifey thinks kamala is charming...?
well there's gonna be some good jobs clean stuff up now so god bless....  coming soon to a suburb near you if biden wins.
So, you‚Äôre implying that people with low incomes are criminals?  Doesn‚Äôt the low income bracket make up 80% of your base?  Who is your strategist - I think he might really work for Biden ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
I agree. They gain absolutely nothing by picking her as VP.  Wonder if they intentionally want to lose so they don't even have to worry about replacing Biden at the top of the ticket, which is a nightmare scenario to navigate.
If Biden is Catholic then I‚Äôm Jewish!

It‚Äôs not ‚Äútrying‚Äù or ‚Äúweak‚Äù when he just hangs that biden bigotry right out in the open everytime a camera turns on.
i imagine its more of an uphill struggle than team biden might want to generate enthusiasm for a former, lets call it, *over-enthusiastic* prosecutor. tryna frame her as a target of racism &amp; hope mort klein comes through with some idiocy to back it up seems like the natural play

Just want to clarify I am voting for Biden in hopes of a progressive cabinet &amp; general tone shift. But there is a subsection of liberals, often white, that are satisfied with the optics of caring about people rather than the ‚Äúextreme‚Äù policies needed to actually bring about   1/2
Honestly? No, not really. However I will still gladly vote for Biden and Harris because they're a lot better than the alternative.

Well Biden just sealed the election for Trump.
Translated: Trump is angered and insulted because Biden is choosing a woman as a running mate.  #TrumpIsAMisogynist
my understanding of the polls is trump does well when it comes to *favorability* -- older and working class black voters *like* him more than the establishment would have it, and if D candidate was Bernie, Warren or Pete, Trump would have a chance w them, but Biden is their *guy*
i suspect trump is going to get a record low percent of the black vote.  Biden is their man  &amp; esp. if he does pick a black women VP who will be POTUS before term is up ‚Äî they aren‚Äôt gonna be able to hide his dementia for four years. No one can stay in a basement that long
Trump not picking the next supreme court nominee is important enough for me to vote for Biden

None of them are even remotely holding Biden/Harris' feet to the fire NOW, so I don't expect them to demand accountability EVER.   These BlueMAGAs just as bad as the RedMAGAs: this is just a game to win, &amp; once they do, they're back to brunch. Qualifications? Solutions? Pfffffft.
The evidence is there.  They got their mail-in voting all across the country because of this covid thing and the mail service to throw the monkey wrench in so they can literally hand the election to Biden.  Trump will NOT be president January 2021, they're totally going to cheat.

This is how intelligent and coherent I imagine every Trump and Biden interview.
I don't think they are going to need to steal it. Biden has Alzheimer's &amp; even the progressive left doesn't like Harris. USPS failings are because of COVID, and the fact they have less business now than in 1985. Maybe you should get your facts before you make stupid comments.
No questions for #SenileJoeBiden! No questions at all, as Trump takes them daily, plummeted by them, about everything. Biden can't answer unscripted questions. If you vote for Biden, you are voting for Harris, the most fake politician in history as President. No way!
I think I'll buy a joe Biden hat!
I'm from Wisconsin but I can't vote for Biden. I'm voting Green.
Harris def. did some of that, and Biden definitely did a LOT more.  "Not Trump" is...something, but IF they win, THEN what do we have? No one who stands for much of anything pro-people at all.  What kind of democracy is it where candidates offer nothing yet auto-expect our votes?
They‚Äôre 100% stuffed with mail in ballots via why Blumph is having them removed by his evil henchmen !!! #Resistance is futile. Biden Harris 2020 Landslide is gonna happen whether Blumph likes it or not !!!
Nawwwwww...remember this Steve? Biden oozes decency. None of y‚Äôall do. #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
Joe "Nothing Will Fundamentally Change" Biden doesn't have my trust.
It does matter. I just don't think Biden and Harris truly care. Harris's past and Biden picking her is proof of that.
The election is already over Biden Harris Landslide is all we‚Äôre gonna see. It‚Äôll be a big blue wave and the new Leaders will save us all with totalitarian communism !!!
I mean, standing up for what is right and fair for all is what matters.   If enough of us did that, we'd never have another Trump or Biden or Clinton or Obama or Bush again.
Your boy biden dodges All questions.
Biden Harris already won no need to even bother it‚Äôs gonna be a landslide. Blumph is finished this time for sure !!!
Um, I thought Biden would pick Hillary for VP, what?
Probably smarter than what I thought: Biden picking H for VP nominee...
The union said Thursday that President Trump has long been hostile to the Post Office.
did she give a speech tonight or something? or is this in response to Biden and her announcement speech?
People want Biden to win so they can go back to being ignorant about our destruction.
...but I'm going to stay home on election day, because Kamala is a cop and Biden's healthcare plan isn't quite progressive enough.
I've given my blind support to them without any ? Now I can see that they simply look out for their own interests as per this continued "stimulus" and raising taxes on small businesses &amp; middle class Americans. I supported Bernie. I can't with Biden &amp; Harris!

I'm not loyal to Biden, and I understand why you wouldn't vote for him, but I fear what may happen if Trump gets another 4 years.
82 more days of this. A narcissist lives for this kind of fight. He will be hyper focused morning, noon and night. We‚Äôll see more promising of $ to anyone/everyone, nonstop attacks on Biden/Harris, unrealistic expectations of supporters, spiraling, anger...this will not go well.
the media is losing their SHIT abt being able to fetishize obama and biden again and frankly im SICK! of it
There is truth to what you say, and if Biden were running against a Mccain or a Romney, I'd probably vote 3rd party, but Trump is crazy unhinged.
Sure, but to conflate the two is just...I don't even know. I am NOT a fan of Biden, but Trump is an enabler of extremism.  He needs to go.

Biden opposes vouchers, but experts say the president wouldn't have the authority to halt a program authorized and funded by the state.

Strange strategy for Joe Biden to pick an extremely unlikable VP candidate that moderates don't even like. Not to mention the fact Harris called Biden a 'racist' and said she believes his accusers. To be fair though, Joe is so senile, I doubt he remembers any of that happened.

This same union endorsed Clinton 4 years ago.  I‚Äôm totally fine stopping all public sector unions from being able to endorse and donate to candidates but you cannot pick and choose.  Either they all can or none of them can.  By the way Biden will in NY by at least 16 points ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The same Dems saying we should listen to the experts on covid have no interest in listening to the experts on policing. None of them scoffed at Biden saying ‚Äúcops should shoot for the leg.‚Äù CNN didn‚Äôt have any law enforcement experts comment on that. Weird.
The narrative for many Americans is that Biden is a good ole moderate. Trump needs to defeat that narrative. Best way is by forcing Biden to take positions on China, Police, etc. Make him say we shouldn‚Äôt bring back medical supply manufacturing.
Patriotism isn't dead, my friend. Biden and Harris will restore it this November and America will be back!!

No questions for #SenileJoeBiden! No questions at all, as Trump takes them daily, plummeted by them, about everything. Biden can't answer unscripted questions. If you vote for Biden, you are voting for Harris, the most fake politician in history as President. No way!

Harris def. did some of that, and Biden definitely did a LOT more.  "Not Trump" is...something, but IF they win, THEN what do we have? No one who stands for much of anything pro-people at all.  What kind of democracy is it where candidates offer nothing yet auto-expect our votes?

I‚Äôm guessing that the people who think I can be shamed into voting for Biden have never purchased a fucking Groupon for dental care. Sorry motherfuckers but I have no shame left!

The appeal to "suburban housewives," the threat that Biden will "hurt God," the promise that "Christianity will have power"--Trump is publicly manipulating religion, fear, and racism. Meanwhile, we're joking about how he pronounces Yosemite or how much orange makeup he's wearing.
I just heard a pundit on CNN say that the big gap in the polls right now is because voters don't know enough about Biden.  Do these crackpots listen to themselves? By what barometer will Biden -- a two-term VP, by the way -- lose support to Trump over the next 10 weeks?
The ads on TV for Trump and against Biden are disgusting. Truly disgusting.
point on  about Joe Biden's MAGA POV is so relevant. When I saw him speak in MKE I was surprised and disappointed by Biden's Americentric, patriotism/nationalism.

Issue with both Trump and Biden I meant.
I think this is a compound problem of being both an issue with and an issue with Biden.  I think Biden needs to keep getting his messaging out strong about what he's going to do to help American's Healthcare system.
The thing that chaps my ass the most is when they say a third party vote is a vote for Trump to try and guilt me into going along with Biden.
Girl-make up your mind.   Trump isn't a republican like your father is.  He is a nazi wanna be. I suggest in honor of your Dad, sidestep the assohole and support Biden/Harris for a change.  Do you want your child growing up in Nazi era??? Your choice!
I have read multiple pieces on how the election will be stolen. Honestly it's mindblowing what I think we will be in for IF the election goes to Biden. The thing that infuriates me is that supporters will see nothing wrong with it and be like "OMG get over it"
Listen I get that Biden and Harris are not good on pro-life policies, but Trump isn‚Äôt either. Pro-life means being pro-life from conception until natural death. Trump is not that
just keep doing those things. There is NOTHING HOLDING BIDEN ACCOUNTABLE because THERE IS NOTHING HOLDING TRUMP ACCOUNTABLE. We have set a precedent, and now whoever's next can get away with everything and still be the great American hero president ever, even if it's Trump again!

I wanted to play an online game and there was a Joe Biden commercial first on a game site. He ain't messing around
For example, broadly speaking I view Biden v Trump as:  -Getting better‚ùå -Not getting worse‚ùå -Getting worse (Biden) -Getting far worse (Trump)  That‚Äôs not to say I discourage voting Biden, I just think it‚Äôs necessary to be brazenly honest about him &amp; his prospective presidency.
Hard agree. If someone is hung up on a Biden/Harris ticket, they haven‚Äôt been paying attention these past four years. This election is deadly serious. It‚Äôs not hyperbole to say he‚Äôs destroying everything he touches.
Agreed, I just contend that when discussing candidates/policies, it‚Äôs imperative that we distinguish (A) ways Biden/Dems = less bad than Trump/GOP (‚Äúnot getting worse‚Äù) FROM (B) ways Biden/Dems/progressives will actually [materially] improve upon the status quo (‚Äúgetting better‚Äù)
Yes. Joe Biden supporters are corny weirdos that worship CNN.
I dislike the Clintons more than either Harris or Biden, and Harris IS better than Tim Kaine
Rather this cult then jumping on Biden‚Äôs lap. And making the hairs on his leg stand up.
I'm pretty sure  would poll at over 20% within a week of debating Biden and Trump. Her plan on criminal justice reform alone makes Biden's look like nothing more than an attempt to grab votes with no real change (oh wait, that's exactly what it is)
So yeah, Biden/Harris may not be the candidates I'm in love with, but I know who don't like, and I'll be using my vote to vote against Trump, who I believe is bringing the US closer to fascism every day.
I mean, the Biden/Harris administration will probably appoint people who are *not* actively out to destroy portions of the government, including the EPA, Dept of Education, CDC, USPS, etc...
Which brings me to Biden/Harris... people are bitching about them already, but like... They may not be your first choice, but I guarantee they are better than Trump and better than a flaming bag of dog shit...
Desperation from desperate people. Trump will lose. And your little tweets won‚Äôt gain new supporters. Update your resume. Joe Biden is a decent man. Trump is not.

The racists hate attacks already being launched against Kamala Harris only validates that Joe Biden picked the right candidate for Vice President. Everything about Kamala Harris family &amp; political background sounds out that the Democratic Party will be greatly energized.

"Every single American should be wearing a mask when they're outside for the next three months at a minimum," Biden said at a press appearance in Delaware. "Every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing. Estimates are it'll save over 40,000 lives."

DNC Secretary Jason Rae will call the roll of states on Tuesday as Democrats formally nominate Joe Biden for president.
But the American left is far from Communist, and Biden and the DNC are far from being the Social Democratic Party. Are they instead the Centre Party, who had "serious concerns" about the Enabling Act and yet universally voted for it as the final nail in the republic's coffin?
the lesser of two evils for conservatives this year isn‚Äôt trump and Biden its trump and abortion  Is abortion so evil that it warrants voting for someone you consider a bad person because, at the least, he won‚Äôt vocally/financially support/prolong abortion?  Personally, yea
In contrast, Biden in past debates has used the technique to talk directly to the center camera to the viewing audience. Will be interesting.
that would be participating in an election campaign, so it's not a good idea. Biden and Harris can consult with him later in November after winning
This is the same GOP the DNC is throwing Biden at thinking it will be okay in the long term.

Biden couldn't tell you what UAE stands for without his handlers whispering the answer in his ear. Which of course would make the hair on his legs stand straight up.

Joe Biden‚Äôs veep pick ‚Äì Why Kamala Harris was a good choice for Joe Biden
because the convention is being shaped around who Biden is and what his strategies are, and that's mostly about playing to the white suburbs for normalcy
Bernie can't do that but Biden can, and he has done literally nothing to flip us to his side.
I think the likely outcome is around the D+8 we got in 2018. There's absolutely nothing Trump has done since that would really improve that score, and they can't seem to make Biden hated enough to drive his numbers down.
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô
Considering Hillary won 54% of the heads-up vote in 2016, it seems really bad strategy not to try to get some of those voters on your side. It's like Bernies strategy was "30% lane in a crowded field or bust"  It's also clear both Biden &amp; Bernie fans would prefer Liz to the other
Joe Biden pronounced it the same way yesterday with her six feet away from him!!!
Actually multiple sources have Liz's voters as 50/50 between Biden and Sanders. Some pragmatically moved to Biden on ST.  The reason I think Warren would do better vs Biden than Bernie did is b/c unlike Bernie, Warren received support from Hillary &amp; Bernie 2016 camps
Biden &amp; the Dem Party &amp; attendant Party goons have until November 2nd to get their shit together &amp; decide if they ACTUALLY care about beating Trump.  There are a LOT of voters out there they're flatly &amp; actively throwing away. Stop demanding--EARN their votes--OFFER something.

Hope they're spying on John Kerry bc you know he's reaching out to his Iranian backers to promise things Biden will roll back.
This is what's happening now with you as president. We can do much better with Biden/Harris#2020

A Biden/Harris presidency would result in more abortions. If you truly believe that's worth beating Trump, you're not an evangelical, you're not religious, you're quite likely not even a good person.
This reminds me: I'm totally fine if you don't like Trump because he's not a conservative. That's fine. That said, there's no world in which I'd ever vote for a pro-abortion candidate like Biden because I want to "fix the republican party." It's never, ever worth it.

And what exactly will she do about Biden's dementia his problem as a racist ,harassment of women or his sons ileagle dealings . Or her many skeleton's and misdeeds were not worried.

This analogy is dumb.  Voters are always asked to compromise, surrender, wait.  Biden's out there actively refusing to support hugely popular stuff like M4A.  So is Trump an existential threat or not? The Dem party &amp; Biden's actions both suggest he's not. That's on THEM, not US.
Legit Biden has given up on getting the left on board and that has been shown after Kamala has been picked as a VP. That is going to be his downfall, mark my words .
I don't want Trump. But, right now, I don't want Biden, either. It is indeed a bad situation.  The Dem Party needs to remember who they allegedly represent. Right now, they treat everyday voters horribly--offering nothing while demanding their votes. I just can't support that.

The onus, again, is not on ME. I reject your framing.   If Biden and the Dem party want my vote--if they really believe Trump is bad--they would take the initiative to secure as many voters as possible.   They're not. That's on THEM.
Again, that's not on me or any other voter.   If Biden wants those voters, he can offer them something. So far, he's actively, repeatedly refused to do so.  It's interesting to me that the candidates are never the ones to compromise, only the voters are told &amp; shamed to do so.
I could care less WHO the person is. If the POLICIES are there, and I have more than just lip service in that regard, I am open to considering them.  Biden has an atrocious record, however, and has shown no interest at ALL in wooing or working w/ actual progressives. So fuck him.
What Does Joe Biden‚Äôs Choice Of Kamala Harris For VP Mean For Wisconsin?
The Democratic establishment is clearly willing to risk it.   It's a solvable problem. I don't WANT to not vote for Biden, but he's provided me with no incentive to do so.   If they think they can win w/o my vote, that, again, is on THEM, not me.
I can't imagine ever being open to Trump.  At the same time, Biden could TRY to match his policies to the wants of everyday people--you know, everyday working people the party USED to represent. And people--myself included--could be an EASY lock come Nov.   He's chosen... poorly.

Please go out and vote! Every vote can make a difference. If you don't agree with Biden/Harris you should look into voting for  Libertarian party. She's the best shot we got at getting Trump out of office.
What are you gonna do? Vote for Biden now, but withhold your vote when the Republicans throw another fascist at us against an incumbent Biden?  A. No you're not, you're gonna preach the same Blue No Matter Who crap, and B. if you threatened it anyways, they wouldn't believe you.
Fuck the polls.  We keep working like Trump is 10 points up.  No let up whatsoever.  Also I live in Wisconsin, and it sure doesn't feel here like Biden's 12 points up.  KEEP WORKING.

Hmm. In the whole history of USA there has been only one Catholic President and one Catholic Vice President. The live one is the 2020 Democratic Presdential nominee, Joe Biden.
He's been trying to be, which is why nobody on the left cares about him anymore. Bernie was our compromise. We tried twice, and the corporate dems have made it very clear they don't want or need the left. Biden is hoping to pull new votes from the right. Doesn't seem likely.

The radical far-right criticism of the Biden/Harris ticket shows how intimidated they are by moderate candidates who can give great speeches.
I am still wondering why you allowed Obama and Biden  too talk you into this knowing he got heat behind being born in another country. Its not a surprise but is funny he'd try it the second time knowing Biden would go with! Anyway Im up for again Congrat's be happy with Vice.

Trump wants BM to vote for him. If he can‚Äôt do so directly, he‚Äôll run Kanye to siphon some of the black male vote away from Biden and hopefully hand him battleground states.

Pathetic ass-clown amuses us with his scathing review of Biden/Harris presser. How will we ever rebound from this critique?

This scheme was hatched and implemented within the span of 1 month, and only 2 months after more than 100 Ukrainians lost their lives revolting against corruption. The media covers for VP Biden by repeatIng ‚Äúno evidence of wrongdoing or illegal activity.‚Äù What do you think? (10)
BTW, the average American household works hard to earn 10% of what Hunter Biden and his firm were paid by Burisma. It‚Äôs nice to have the right last name, and friends in high places. (8)
BTW, don‚Äôt you think that Mykoloa Zlochevsky would have made sure Ukrainian officials desperate for U.S. support knew that Hunter Biden was on his board? I‚Äôll bet he did. The obvious message to those Ukrainian officials: ‚ÄúIf you want U.S. support, leave Burisma alone.‚Äù (6)
Fifteen days later, on May 13, 2014, guess who joins the board of Burisma?  That‚Äôs right, Hunter Biden.  Another sheer coincidence? (5)
I voted for Gabbard, in the Wisconsin primary.  I hoped that she, Biden, and Sanders would keep campaigning until August.

The timeline of  and Hunter‚Äôs multimillion-dollar Ukrainian conflict of interest is revealing.  Only two months after revolution to rid Ukraine of corruption, Hunter‚Äôs business partner, Devon Archer, meets VP Biden at White House.  Doesn‚Äôt that seem a little odd? (1)
Is #KamalaHarris being chosen as Biden‚Äôs running mate simply a move to diffuse #BLM ?

There is absolutely zero chance Trump wins in a landslide, the electoral map just doesn‚Äôt work in his favor. Biden could lose every state that‚Äôs even kind of a contest and he‚Äôd still get 180 electoral votes
12. What does  know about Hunter Biden‚Äôs business dealings in China?
11. What skills or knowledge did Hunter Biden possesses that qualified him to be on Burisma‚Äôs board and receive $50,000 to $166,000 per month for his and his partner‚Äôs services?
10. Why do you believe Burisma recruited and paid Devon Archer, whom  met at the White House in 2014, and Hunter Biden to be on its board?
9. When did  first become aware of how much Hunter Biden was being compensated by Burisma?
8. When did  first become aware that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma?
7. Was  aware in April 2014 that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma?
4.Was Hunter Biden aware that British officials had seized the bank account of Burisma owner Mykoloa Zlochevsky?
3.Was  aware that Burisma‚Äôs owner, Mykoloa Zlochevsky, was generally viewed as a corrupt oligarch and that his London bank account containing $23 million had been seized by British officials only 15 days before Hunter Biden joined the board of a company he owned?
1.Why did  meet with Hunter‚Äôs friend and fellow Burisma board member Devon Archer at the White House on April 16, 2014? Was anything related to Ukraine, Hunter Biden, or Burisma discussed?
Even Secretary of State Kerry‚Äôs stepson knew Hunter‚Äôs involvement with Burisma was problematic, severing business ties with Hunter and making clear his reason why.
Two months after Ukraine‚Äôs Revolution of Dignity - a revolution against corruption - Hunter seized a multimillion-dollar opportunity available to him because his last name was Biden.
Biden already turned down the Green Deal outright.  Biden pushed through the Crime Bill that helped incarcerate millions of black Americans  on petty drug crimes.  Biden picked a VP that refused to go after corrupt wealthy individuals while backing for profit prisons.
The only substantial difference between Biden and Trump is Trump tear gassed American citizens for a photo op.  Biden not dumb enough to that.  That is the only reason Biden will win Wisconsin.
Great ?, took courage to get where you are. It would be great if all groups had representation in America,but they don‚Äôt.Third parties don‚Äôt work.Until we have a proportional system,where power can be shared among multiple parties:only 2 choices &amp; you won‚Äôt vote Trump, so Biden..

Harris won't help Biden.  She doesn't have much political experience; she's in her first term.  She's not from a swing state.  Biden was already going to win California.
If Biden wins (which I hope won't happen), who should be in his cabinet?  I hope, for these jobs, he'll chose these people:  sec. of state, Leon Panneta; sec. of treas., Janet Napolitano; sec. of def., Ken Salazar.

When MAGA folks say Biden will ruin america:
Apparently you seem to forget that this woman locks up marijuana users and has laughed about it. Now, why would you wanna vote for someone that said Biden was a racist/believed the accusers and locks up people that clearly would be potential voters to get her In?
The only reason I didn't think she'd be the VP pick was it didn't help electorally, she's a Senator from California, Biden is probably going to get a large % of the vote there. But I couldn't think of a better alternative with national appeal.
And called Joe Biden a racist üòÇ makes a lot of sense...
Will Harris help Biden?  I don't think so.  She's in her first term.  She's not from a swing state.
Grow up and vote Biden
Is that to say we'd be Biden our time?
BIDEN/HARRIS FOR THE WIN!!!!
If Biden wins she will most likely become president because he ain't gonna last long
She'll either be the first female president if Biden is elected and resigns... or she'll be the presidential nominee if Biden even makes it to the election.
Congratulations  and  Excellent news!
As a Federal Democratic Republic not possible.The more I watch Orb√°n;Brexit perhaps our Founders prescient &amp; brilliant.The ACA despite its problems,has demonstrated to most that healthcare is a right.Biden will have an opportunity to bring a M4A like system,if he takes a chance.

Sadly, this is where we are. I have multiple Biden signs in my yard and it was necessary to install cameras and motion sensor spotlights due to multiple vandalism incidents. Neighbor is a Trump supporter and he had 6 signs, all were vandalized. Now he has none. It's not cool!
For the love of God people vote Biden! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Won't need them because Biden won't make it to election day. The delay in VP pick is really who will take Biden's place.
Let's not forget he's complicit in Trump's nonsense mission to 'investigate' Hunter Biden using Russian misinformation. Allegedly.
What if Biden's delay in picking a VP runningmate is really him picking a replacement for himself?  #deepthought
Biden already said he doesn't support the green deal and nether does Pelosi.
I think that about 90 percent of people, I know, will vote against Biden, but Illinois has a lot of Democrats.  In 2018, JB got 53 percent.  In 2016, Hillary got about 55 percent, there.  Duckworth got almost that percentage.
I can't believe these people in this country can be so stupid and ignorant we will vote Biden!
If you live in Illinois, please answer this.  Will you vote for Trump, or will you at least consider voting for a third-party candidate, since Biden will easily win Illinois?
New prediction.  Biden won't make it to the election. Dems will either install Sanders or appoint a different nominee.  #prediction #Election2020
7/7 The only ones responsible for furthering Russian disinformation to interfere in our election are the Democrats in Congress and the Biden campaign, and the media that is willingly amplifying their lies. They should all be ashamed.
Biden has also been a liar and plagiariser his whole life.
Your ignorant, divisive tweets aimed at rallying your ‚Äúbase‚Äù make me sick and galvanize my vote for Joe Biden this fall. Keep on tweeting things like ChinaVirus because it‚Äôs driving people like me (and there are many of us) who have voted Republican for many years, away.Voting Biden/Harris and a return to sanity.  No one is above the law, the GOP has turned a blind eye to Trump‚Äôs crimes.
I couldn‚Äôt care less what he has to say. Will you hold Harris accountable for the things she said about biden. Why do libtard new yorkers move here? To spread the misery?
But you‚Äôll vote for biden and harris?
Love him or hate, at least with Trump you know who is running the White House. Biden? Please. Just a puppet.
I miss him as our president. I wish he could get another 4 years. Hopefully we can get Trump out and get Joe Biden to be our president for the next 4 years. That would be wonderful
lmao... ur so woke... first of all its been debunked and fake or else he wouldve been removed by now... second of all you do know russias economy is like the size of texas? and yet chinas economy who prefers joe biden is double that of the usa
I mean, Kamala did say that Joe Biden was a bad guy... duh.
Second fact check in a week from a claim friends or family pointed out. Always welcome suggestions!   Biden opposes school vouchers, but he has no authority to ban them since the Wisconsin program is authorized and funded by the state.
takes more questions in one day than Biden has in a year. Plus you can actually understand him.
is not in control. He does what his handlers tell him to do. He is an old mindless puppet like Biden. His job is to disrupt, destroy, and slow any growth and prosperity in WI and the US to lay the groundwork to have Trump lose and have the country changed to socialism.
So when will Biden ever answer questions?
Actually biden has said many times that his tax increases will be for those earning more then 400,000 a year
Fuck this guy. So worried about 0.0000something percent fraud. I‚Äôm excited to watch how he reacts to his loss. Shame it has to be Biden to do it.
Joe Biden can barely read from his notes.  His handlers proposed this not him.
Blah blah blah, Vote BIDEN/HARRIS, return sanity to the White House.  Remove these cheaters, grifters, liars, and scum
Folks want to be outraged. Let's remember who helped Biden get this far. What did she do in the process?
While shopping, I thought of what the Biden Transition Team will need most. This jumps to the top of the list.

Ask women if we care if "men are insulted" by this. Seriously? LOL
Honestly pissed that the 'progressive' Democratic party continues to push candidates that nobody wants, knowing we're forced to vote for whoever they put forth in order to vote out Trump. We didn't want Biden.
nobody likes Joe Biden and if you say you do you're pretending
And Biden wouldn‚Äôt be the nominee to go against him. His entire career is indistinguishable from a Republican‚Äôs. He won‚Äôt change anything, he‚Äôll just be polite on Twitter. It‚Äôs really disheartening that this is where we‚Äôre at now.

Good to see Biden‚Äôs wife is doing all the interviews now. What a joke.
It's fucking annoying. Trump bad this. Trump good that. Biden bad this. Biden good that. I wanna blow my ears out during every video I watch (like FusionZGamer, Ben Phillips, IAMWILDCAT, etc). BUT at least they getting money off of it so yeah.
Yeah but I thought Trump was a better candidate in 2016. No way Biden is as polarizing as Hillary. He won‚Äôt have that sizable advantage this time around. Oh and now he‚Äôs running as an impeached incumbent. That seems...tarnished, to say the least.
And who is going to be blamed over the deficit? The republicans will blame Biden and the Democrats when they win in November. The Dems will get it under control and then a republican will be re-elected and there goes the deficit again. Same old same old.

Are there any 'journalists' at that presser able to ask a hard, inciteful question? Or, are they all ringers there to lob softballs.  Trump keeps referring to Biden et al as people who don't know what they're doing.  Pot calling the kettle black? Some COVID update. Such BS.

Six months from now, everyone complaining about Kamala Harris being a cop and saying they won't vote for Biden, and thus Biden losing, are going to be complaining about the third straight week of police officers shooting BLM protesters and Trump rooting them on.
He'll sign a bill if it comes to his desk if the pressure is kept up.  No matter what you say, Biden is better than Trump.  Four more years of Trump, we might not even HAVE A chance to vote for president.
Then please hold your nose and vote Biden. Fesh was right, there's two options in our system. The Greens nominated Trump no matter what name appears on the ballot for them.
Mike, Colorado is in play. Every vote for Biden counts. Do you really want to see four more years of Trump?
Trump would have been shooting protesters in the streets if he wasn't running for reelection.  Just admit it, you wouldn't have been happy no matter who he picked.  I'm not happy with Biden but he's not Trump. That's good enough for me this go around.
Are you kidding? Nominee Biden has pushed significantly left of Candidate Biden. He's taken big cues from both Warren and Sanders since they dropped out. There are so many bad narratives floating around that just aren't factual.
I saw ppl on twitter today who‚Äôre Anti-trump but don‚Äôt want Biden either, so they‚Äôre going to write in Bernie. Plz don‚Äôt be a fucking idiot. This is how Trump can get elected again. If you write in a candidate just throw away your fuckin ballot.
It‚Äôs starting to become clear why Harris was chosen...as Biden‚Äôs surrogate backbone.
I dunno. Maybe I'm an idiot for thinking the worst of Joe Biden is far better than the best possible Trump second term.  I understand not pushing it too far on policy in this election. You have four years to push on that if you win. What've you got if you lose?
Anyone who isn't in a state that's in play who doesn't vote for Biden is selfish.
There's two choices on every ballot.  Trump or Biden.  Sorry but every other party nominated Trump.  Don't vote? Grab yourself a MAGAt hat because you've owned it.  We have a better chance of progress with Biden than we ever will have with Trump.
With Biden in office though, we'll have a hell of a lot better chance of the action on the streets resulting in concrete positive, and lasting impact than under Trump.
It's also just kind of the reality of the moment. Like, I'm not prepared to fuck around with anything which might push the needle towards Trump this year. Get Biden elected, /then/ push him hard to be better.
I don't even like Biden, but I'm also never going to pretend for a second that I'm even remotely considering not voting for him.
Biden / Harris 2020 great pic ... vote in November, let‚Äôs remove this crime family from the people‚Äôs house!
It just bugs me when I see people on the left talking down about Biden constantly, like it's helping anybody. It's big Jill Stein energy and I hate it.
Biden could have picked Shank Hall as his running mate and I would still vote for him. #DumpTrump2020
Also I hope that when Biden and Harris win.. It's extra hard on you..
Nothing will make me more immediately suspicious of a person than them pretending like choosing between Biden and Trump is hard.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are known to be orange stain removers... And our democracy has had a huge orange stain that definitely needs removing

There's gonna be a lot more red hats come November 4th.  Frankly, I'm of the opinion if someone refuses to vote for Biden, they're no better than the most vocal MAGAts.  We have a chance to STOP Trump and undo his shit, which needs done before we can start progressing.
I didn't want Biden, and I've seen a lot of bad things about Harris.  Yet, since the choice is Biden or a narcissistic scumbag who's made our country a laughingstock, I'm voting for Biden.  America cannot survive four more years of Trump.
It is not Trump versus Biden. It is Trump versus Harris.
Only if people are more okay with four more years (at least) of Trump's crap than of voting for a flawed candidate who ISN'T a narcissistic POS.  There's two options, Biden-Harris or Trump-Pence. Vote Green? Trump's their candidate. Vote Socialist? They nominated Trump too.
When exactly did JB go from Justin Bieber to Joe Biden
I know some of you weren't going to be happy unless the VP announcement was "Biden picks Sanders, drops out moments later," so maybe settle down and focus on reacting from a healthier place, or don't react at all.
Let's face it, the only person Biden could have chosen that is going to satisfy the Bernie or Busters is Bernie himself.  I expect endless "Harris is a cop" for the next four years, regardless of who wins thebelection.

oh yeah, i just meant tried to change how the public sees her. i don't trust people that change their views like that and i don't trust her. don't trust biden either. i hate that i'm in a position where voting for them is a necessity.
Harris is super qualified, a woman, a minority, and basically shoots down the whole "the left is against the existence of police" thing the GOP wants to use. And she &amp; Biden will have the most liberal Democratic platform seen in several decades.

The red hats will portray Biden/Harris as basically communist.  The Bernie Bros. will portray Biden/Harris as basically pre-Trump Republican.  If you want to understand why even people of good faith struggle to understand where America is right now politically, start right there.

Thank you.  It‚Äôs getting so annoying hearing not only people on Twitter but the news media talking about Kamala‚Äôs 2024 run.  Biden has said it depends on his health.  Let him decide first.  Give him the respect and benefit of the doubt first-then-celebrate her potential run.
Yeah, personally I consider giving up on giving everyone healthcare, maintaining a habitable planet and trying to ensure that people don't live in misery the true surrender.  The Trump/Biden fight really isn't that relevant to those struggles.

Biden-Harris is the first Democratic ticket since 1984 where neither the Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate has an Ivy League degree.

But seriously...what I love is that the ENTIRE Biden campaign is premised on appealing to suburban moderates.  Guess they've decided to accomplish that through simply showing off how much they hate the left.
I never have. But the thing Biden has done that solidified it the most this cycle was him telling his oligarchic donors "nothing will fundamentally change."
This is exactly right. Biden‚Äôs handlers are pushing one message: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs  not Trump.‚Äù  Historically, it‚Äôs not a winning strategy, but it‚Äôs all they have. They don‚Äôt dare pull back the curtain and risk letting America know what they‚Äôre really about.

Same Marquette poll has Biden leading Inds by 12 % and among moderates by THIRTY FIVE points.   Trump won Inds in 2016 by ten points and lost moderates by only 10 points.  So even assuming it's another low-Dem turnout year, Trump still flailing much more than this poll shows.

I don't care for fundamentals. A lot of people believe this is what drives the market.   SO what could happen here in the USA that would for weeks continuously drive the market down?   A Trump loss to Biden and or the death of a President in Office.
I once believed that things were going well under Trump, and who came after would be a problem for our Nation.   I believed Trump would die in office. Enter Pandemic I don't believe Trump will be reelected. I don't believe Biden will make it thru his first term.
I'm one of those people with views on both sides of the table, so I do have issues with a Biden Presidency.   I appreciate the adult conversation.

So you do think that Biden is a stalking horse for communism? Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., that Joe Biden?
Give it up, Biden is going to win
Man, I'm hardly the first one to say it, but how I wish that we lived in the world of Republican imagination. In that world, Bernie Sanders is a Marxist and AOC somehow controls Pelosi, while Biden is actually a stalking horse for communism.
Even liberals seem willing to admit electing down ballot Dems isn‚Äôt going to stop trump which seems to posit that democrats as a whole suck lots of ass. Nobody is like ‚Äúif you won‚Äôt vote Biden make sure to flip the house and senate‚Äù they‚Äôre like ‚Äúeat shit vote trump fuck you‚Äù
But you have hit on a key point, as a I noted elsewhere in this thread. Our country's political system is such a failure that it saw fit to offer us Clinton v Trump four years ago, and Biden v Trump today.   At least Bernie vs Rick Santorum would've been interesting.
Biden's not a pathological liar; I used that term advisedly, rather than hyperbolically. Trump is congenitally incapable of telling the truth, when a lie will do. Look at his interview with Wallace, in which he made up that horseshit about the MOCA and how amazed his MDs were.
I‚Äôm all for Biden for the reasons you‚Äôve described, but I‚Äôm concerned for chances to move forward when this is how progressives are seen by the party.
The rest is of this thread is not helping my case on blanket stamenets and twitter vs reality here.   I think there‚Äôs a middle ground between blind vote and pointing out obvious flaws. There does need to be accountability. Biden isn‚Äôt great but he‚Äôs not bad.
Joe Biden is pulling a Hillary and dodging Wisconsin entirely, refusing to accept the party's nomination in Milwaukee, so naturally President Trump is taking full advantage of the absence. üòé
Trump is a racist because of all the things he says and does. Joe Biden is also a racist, but he's not as bad as Trump because he isn't also a career criminal, a pathological liar, or a man completely ignorant of the important issues of the day.
Did you reach out to anyone in the  like  or  - you know, the actual left - for their view on Kamala Harris and Joe Biden? Or just Democrats?
I hate Biden, love this scenario.
If you are happily voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris you are NOT an ally I promise
Biden is a racist, after all, he opposed integration. But he's no where near as bad as Trump.  It's a huge indictment of our moribund political system that the choices we were offered in 2016 were Clinton and Trump, and the choices we're offered in 2020 are Biden and Trump.
I‚Äôm no Biden/Harris fan, but it clearly says what they are signing
Does it even matter? I never like anybody that I work with and it doesn‚Äôt alter our ability to get the job done because that‚Äôs what adults do. Obama and Biden were adults doing a job.
DO you ever stop talking and tweeting? It's like this constant diarrhea of the mouth.  God, I hope Biden wins just so you will just SHUT UP for a minute. Nobody believes a word you say, it's just BLAH BLAH BLAH all day every day.
I believe if Biden wins, his speech will focus on a return to the way things were in 2015 and restoring ‚Äòhonor to the Oval Office‚Äô. Also probably some lip service to making things a bit better for women and letting Kamala take it from there.
Sadly, Biden does mot plan on offering free college. Here is a link to the complicated plan to make college affordable, not free.
This is BS. End of argument! #Biden  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
In contrast, Joe Biden has been married twice, and it's because his first wife was killed in a horrific car crash, along with one of his children. To the best of our knowledge, he never cheated on either woman.  His ideology sucks, but his personal ethics are miles better.
I'm the dork who fills out literally every single survey that Joe Biden's campaign sends to me, and though I'm fully aware they are all ploys to get me to donate, I am a lil heartened when they include questions about how the Democratic primary has impacted party unity

As I said, your inane/patronizing comments while CLEARLY displaying you will not push Biden left is toxic to the effort of getting leftists.  You'd be better off just pulling the lever for Trump and being quiet as more than 2 leftists won't vote Biden because of you.
You are exactly the reason why I am so tempted to not vote Biden in a swing state. If you want Biden to win, you should probably not talk to leftists until after the election.  Otherwise you are just working to elect Trump.
Of course it's about race. Just like Joe Biden being against bussing was about race, being against low income housing is about race as well. You're smart enough to recognize that I'm sure.

A nationwide mandate is not an answer to anybody's problem. It's an exercise in government control, and the capacity for the American People to be sheep to their government. Some people should wear masks, others it's not necessary. Biden doesn't trust people to do the right thing

He has contributed millions to the DNC, 18 million I believe, and is donating to down ballot races. It was decided by all parties involved to not involve his media Team. But some, as individuals, moved over to Biden.
and as opposed to Biden et al, Obama was actually really good at politics. he could convince those to his left to give him more time and breathing space

i love this piece! shout out to public universities! (especially the ones where i went to undergrad, grad school, and worked at, namely, UCSC, UW Seattle and UW-Madison)
the addendum here is that of course it's great and good and totally fine for people to try to influence biden/harris on policy, but a random DNC volunteer has as much poll as you do over the presidential platform, so you're wasting everyone's time trying to do it this way.

How about Trump‚Äôs racist comments about President Barack Obama?  Remember that?  Please educate me on the Biden racist comments please
Basically the difference between trump and Biden is do we want fascism used abroad only or fascism used at home as well. As you may have noticed from years of Obama Biden expanding illegal wars to little protest, exporting fascism makes the fascism more palatable and last longer

It wasn't going to being me in for sure.  Just saying Harris wasn't even the second or third most progressive Senator who ran in the primary that could have been picked.  Yet gaslighters are busy saying she is the most progressive ever and Biden is FDR.
I don't like her, but she'll do well in the debates and won't cost Biden the election. She is perceived as fairly moderate. As an ex-prosecutor she will hurt Trump's ability to claim the mantle as the law and order candidate. She was a politically expedient pick.

Yes, she has a problematic record as California's top cop. Biden has a more problematic record on a ton of things. I can't be overly concerned. I just want them to win.

This wasn't phrased like a normal VP pick would have been. Only one President has ever "stepped aside" and it wasn't exactly by choice...it's not something Presidents normally do.  "if and when Biden decides to step aside." ü§îü§îü§î  Source:
Joe Biden is a bait and switch victim
CNN already leaked the plan for Biden to step aside.
Just listened to Biden and Harris speeches, surprised myself by crying at hearing a promise of moral, caring leadership. I‚Äôm beyond tired of Trump and his enablers and their platform of power and money for themselves.
"More united than ever" in the sense that virtually all of the left will be voting for Biden to get Trump out of office. After this November, we may be looking at a different picture.
Would you mind telling that to Biden and Harris?
Not an isolated incident either.   Joe Biden is definitely banging his granddaughter.
Not an isolated incident either.
Mockingbird Media is openly planning for Biden to have a shorter presidency than William Henry Harrison.
"Barack Obama and Joe Biden did their job" referring to ebola. 2 people died.  Trump pushed "miracle" drugs and said it would go away like a miracle.  There's a reason it hit America worse than other advanced nations: Trump's failure to take it seriously from the start. #COVID
When Joe Biden says campaigns are a "family affair", he means it LITERALLY.
Biden speaks like a normal human. I think there's enough rational humans out there to see that.
Came to know  via Beau Biden's friendship with her.
This Biden speech is good. Can‚Äôt wait for all the phonies to start making memes about him being hospitalized with dementia.
Meanwhile, Joe Biden is still avoiding Wisconsin like the plague.
Biden's convention week was in mid-July. He didn't show up in Milwaukee.

Biden/Pence 2020
Wahoo! For everyone that's excited about this #VPPick make sure you pledge to vote for the Biden-Harris ticket here ‚¨áÔ∏è
Worth noting w/  coming to Oshkosh Monday as Dems kick off their virtual national convention his last political rally in Wisconsin was the same night as the final prez primary debate before the Iowa caucus.  Expect talk of how he came to Wis, while Biden didn't.
I think the "conservative" here describes her as a safe VP choice for Biden that matches conventional wisdom not her political positions. People need to actually read the article.
In November, I will vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. I wish them success.(4/7)
I mean, obviously don't do that, Joe Biden.
Immediately after being sworn in, Joe Biden orders the military to gun down the entire Supreme Court, then appoints nine beautiful thirtysomething female justices of various ethnicities. "Clean slate," he grunts in a Rorschach voice.
I'm voting for Biden. But you can be damn sure I'll be voting 3rd party in 4 years because this "lesser of 2 evils" shit has got to end. I want to at least pick the lesser of THREE evils every election.
I saw an acquaintance say the other day that she was still undecided as to who to vote for in November. How is this even possible?  I figured either you vote for Biden or you just admit you're a racist piece of shit. There's really no "oh gee, I could be kind of racist"
Biden isn't going to do shit about climate change and that is going to kill way more people than Covid. We need someone who isn't beholden to corporate overlords.
Thanks man! I was on the fence about voting for Biden, but this really gave me the clarity to realize that I will not.
How about your guy put Biden on the spot by releasing his tax returns and agreeing to real-time fact-checking during the debate?
In a tweet that could preview their message, Biden tweeted Wednesday morning that if he and Harris win, "we're going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. We won't have a minute to waste."
lol. We want M4All and Green New Deal. Joe Biden is a corporate shill. So no, I won't 'fall in line'. Democrats offer me nothing.
Biden isnt going left but everyone else that works under him will
Obviously it doesn't change anything for me, but Biden's ability to hide over the last few months has certainly helped him. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to the primaries and will finally see him on display (likely getting walked by Trump).
If the Kennedy twerp unseats Markey, I hope Biden offers him a cabinet spot.
How Sen. Kamala Harris went from one of Joe Biden's harshest critics during the debates to his running mate.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are set to make their first campaign appearance together this afternoon at 2:50 p.m.

good, if we declare Biden unfit for president, we can have a half way decent president!
is Nate Silver aware that this is the picture they went with?
Biden is white. Youre white. Leah's white. You're all dunces. My narrative is in tact.
Trump care about the rich and racist Biden care about the ignorant and dumb they both terrible but you have to pick the lesser of two evils again
Will Harris help or hurt? The Biden camp has had the magnifying glass out for months to study that question, and has apparently come up with its answer.  Read about how progressives are weighing the pros and cons of  VP pick
Also, if you paid any attention, Kamala ripped into Biden for his part actions during his time to his face during the debate. That's one reason why we were shown he has changed. He forgave her, agreed that he erred, and chose her as his running mate.
How many doors have you knocked for Biden? 0? Must be a trump supporter since you aren‚Äôt fighting for Biden. How many times have you hit the gun range to train to shoot fascists if they take to the street with guns and trump refuses to concede? Zero? Must be a trump supporter
I like this. She and Joe could host different experts to highlight what a Biden administration would look like.  Potential cabinet appointees, health experts, trade experts, school experts, environmental experts.  End each event with 2016 Trump voter who is now a Biden supporter.
Biden literally grabbed a pussy.  Don‚Äôt forget that!!!  Eventually everyone sees the light!  Congratulations.  It‚Äôs your time!!!
I feel like I can hear this A1 saying, " And Biden announced his VP? Sure. Fine. Whatever"
The senate couldn't pass Obamacare with 60 dems! Trump couldn't overturn it with his majority!  Rapid change is really, really hard to make in our legislative system ‚Äî¬†and one thing I am confident in is that Biden &amp; Harris are going to respect separation of powers.
If Trump wants to understand  why Wisconsin women will be voting for Vice President Biden and Democrats up and down the ticket, he should watch our Convention.
I am not at all comfortable counting Wisconsin in the Biden column. Not sure about the others, but gonna be close, for sure.
Tucker Carlson calls Biden-Harris the 'first entirely hollow presidential ticket in American history' | Fox News
For when you come across a Republican desperately trying to convince voters that Joe Biden will somehow be worse for our country than Trump...
Honestly, a slow progression towards the destruction of our world isn‚Äôt preferable than a quick decent under trump. Things need tremendous attention right now and Biden is a bandaid to a fatal gun shot wound.
This is why Biden picked  Harris was widely expected to be the pick, so  had MONTHS to generate oppo talking points against her. This is the absolute best they have.  #Kamala
Who made racist and misogynistic social media posts in the past six hours?   Hint:  it wasn‚Äôt Biden.    You cannot trust Donald Trump.  He has already killed 160,000 Americans through incompetence. What happens when his hair trigger temper goes off when his hand is on the button?
And having a woman on the ticket gives Biden Bros a convenient scapegoat when they lose. ‚ÄúI guess some people aren‚Äôt ready to vote for a woman.‚Äù Blame the voters, not the candidate.
Joe Biden is Catholic *but even if he weren't* &amp; he worshipped a dried apple sculpture that won 3rd place at the State Fair he'd still be closer to Christian than Donald Trump (who gassed peaceful protesters to hold a photo op OUTSIDE a church, w/ a random, upside down Bible).
Ummm....isn't Biden Catholic...??
Oh, we‚Äôre talking about Biden. I thought we were talking about your candidate - who hides in an underground bunker and tweets everything from his VP pick to your eventual firing.
Translation: if you elect Joe Biden, black people will move into your neighborhood
This being said, I am actually gonna vote for Biden/Harris ü§°üò≠
Biden. Or Stacey.  Really.  ? Elvis.    Trump 2020.
Undoubtedly it will be a close race in the Electoral College, although Biden will win popular vote.  What I am unsure of is the underlying methodology of the polls averaged.  In 2016, we learned, they undercounted non-college whites.  Do the 2020 polls fix this skew?
I third this.  Just gotta our women in charge...which Biden isn‚Äôt afraid of! #BidenHarris2020
I want a tee shirt that say‚Äôs, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a NASTY Woman‚Äù on the front and Biden/Harris in the back.
Everyone is joking about voting for kanye right? Like haha but we're all still voting for Biden/Harris
Allan Lichtman has predicted every president since 84 correctly and is going with Joe Biden.
Joe and Kamala are a great team!  It is unfortunate that they won‚Äôt attend tonight‚Äôs Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee to introduce Kamala as Biden‚Äôs VP pick to the rest of the country.  Joe and Kamala need to visit Wisconsin soon and not repeat Hillary‚Äôs 2016 mistake.
Biden is Catholic so Tobin is jeering in his tweet
I think this is a good day to donate to the Biden-Harris ticket!!!
Biden/Harris2020 - We‚Äôll have Planned Parenthood do it.
I think every week or so between now and the election, Biden should announce a new cabinet member.  - makes people think of him as already President - allows the media to contrast his picks with the garbage fires there now - let's start with Betsy DeVos
That's Clinton. I don't see anything to do with Biden or Harris. Nice try but you failed.
‚ÄúIf we lie to our model and tell it that the election is going to be held today. It spits out that Biden has a 93 percent chance of winning. In other words, a Trump victory would require a much bigger polling error than what we saw in 2016.‚Äù #StayFocused
The problem with this stand is that come January, we're all going to be eating the same dish, and "none of this" is not one of the options on the menu.  Bush v Kerry? Obama v McCain? Sure. We'd be okay either way.  Trump v Biden? I genuinely don't think so.
"Law-and-Order Baggage" ( ?!)
I haven‚Äôt read anything that has convinced me that Biden has raped anyone, so I don‚Äôt believe I am voting for a rapist. I do believe the writings of Timothy Snyder, Masha Gessen and Jason Stanley, which lead me to believe that if I want to live in a democracy T must be defeated.
The idea that Biden is beholden to the far left seems like desperate straining.
Like I'm just supposed to assume that he's implying Biden will be in a wheelchair
Here‚Äôs the thing.  Think of the election like a coin flip that‚Äôs weighted a tad towards Biden. (For now)  We aren‚Äôt flipping the coin 100 times.   It‚Äôs only being flipped 1 time. Trump could absolutely win this thing. To think otherwise is stupid.
A sober and objective accounting of Biden‚Äôs record as an elected official recognizes the unique responsibility he bears for our current moment. It‚Äôs not the left that‚Äôs confused by this!
Wow. The bishop of Providence, RI doesn't know that Joe Biden is Catholic.  But then he didn't think it was his job to report his diocesan priest sex abusers. Sad.
This suburban housewife can‚Äôt cook but she‚Äôs voting for Biden.
Was joe Biden raised Catholic? Yes. Are his views in line with the Catholic faith or does he practice his faith? Absolutely NOT

I don't like Kamala as Biden's VP candidate. I LOVE Kamala as the next Vice President of the United States. I'm a guy, and I am thrilled about this. At last, after almost four years of hell, a glimmer of hope!
This idea of Joe Biden as a "far left stooge" isn't sticking, because that's just not who Joe is; people can sense it even if they don't know him.  I think "Dementia Joe" will also fall away after the first debate.  What else do they have? Nothing.
Well see if u would of said this first instead of just Nah I would of said that ur one of the good ones lol. While we might disagree on Biden/Harris is better for the country we can agree on this
She was totally angling to be Biden's VP dude she would have left Sanders in the dust no matter what
Still believe the Biden accusers??

You can't say defund the police and also support Harris (and Biden). Stop making excuses for their Bullshit. Hold them accountable like you wanna hold Trump accountable.
Forces him to be better?  Really     I think Biden was perfectly fine yesterday, and will be perfectly fine tomorrow.  Such an insult to Biden &amp; in turn,     Or did Biden FORCE Obama to be better too?   This is why I don‚Äôt want you or your network.
I love this.  The same ppl who talk of how Kamala is so progressive are the same ones who said Biden is so moderate.    News Flash: They both are centrists.  Always have been.  Sorry to disappoint.    #BidenHarris2020
If I see a YesWeKam hashtag again i will literally ü§Æ  I love Kamala.  Nothing to do with her, but lets remember this is Joe Biden running for President.... hopefully for 8 years.  Not a Kamala Harris 2024 Campaign.   #BidenHarris2020
Spoiler: Doesn‚Äôt help or hurt.  People will vote based on Biden and Biden only.  A few outliers on Twitter might be the exception, but I agree.  I like her-always have-but I would vote Biden no matter who he chose.  #BidenHarris2020 #BidenVP
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : Joe Biden has named his running mate in the 2020 presidential race, just days before start of Democratic National Convention

Wet Ass President-Elect-Biden
The latest Marquette poll of Wisconsin came out today and included this heartening table. In other news,  is bad at politics.
Yep, first time I made a donation to Biden was today
But if you truly know what Jesus was really like, he'd probably hold up a Biden/Harris sign.
Four debates. First Harris/Pence, second Biden/Pence, third Harris/Trump, fourth Biden/Trump
Kamala Harris is a transphobic cop haha vote for Biden still tho please
If it gets Trump out I‚Äôm ok. I also think Biden will be a 1 term President and We the People need to get busy organizing for the future! #GreenNewDeal
I spoke to the local  chapter about  joining the Biden ticket.   Pres. Greg Jones: ‚ÄúMore than anything else, this decision says this country can live up to it‚Äôs creed that all Americans are created equal.... Biden didn't forget the legacy of African Americans."
((JUST SO WE ARE CLEAR i am voting for biden because i don‚Äôt really have any other choice lol it is just sad that that‚Äôs the case and is hard to think about how different things could be...not to dwell on da past or anything but it‚Äôs tough to swallow sometimes))
I voted Warren in the primary. I bought a shirt. A NICE shirt. But Harris is the right pick for several reasons: 1) she sparred hard w/Biden in primaries and the choice says a lot 2) as a former AG she can cut through GOP legal bullshit, 3) wary abt two 70-somethings on a ticket.
I‚Äôve been waiting for this announcement to buy my Biden yard sign and bumper sticker. Might have gone overboard with a few other things
Yay! Great! Biden chooses a Veep nominee who is disliked by the Right AND the Left. Woo hoo. Thanks for four more years of Trump you idiot Corporate Dems.
I guess Scott Walker, Trump sycophant, missed the Bible studies on forgiveness.     Once again, Joe Biden shows that he doesn't harbor a fleet of grudges, unlike our #tweeterinchief
For anyone who thinks your proving something by not voting for Biden, think again, esp if you aren‚Äôt personally busting your ass at lower levels of politics. A vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for the acitivists working their asses off to push Dems  left. Read: #BidenHarris2020
Biden is 77 and has borderline dimentia. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll have to wait until 2024
People can joke about Biden securing California but is there any data on whether a VPs home state effects winning said state? Like where the fuck was Tim Kaine from, and did Clinton win there???
Didn‚Äôt Hunter work for a ‚Äúbig bank‚Äù out of Delaware?  Playing the banks for everything you can!  Has a bank ever donated to a Joe Biden campaign?  Yes; so don‚Äôt make banks the villains when you accept $ from them.
Fun fact: approximately half of American Catholics will vote for Joe Biden in November. #CatholicTwitter
If Biden had picked Trump as VP, it still would have been better.
That's why he's backing Biden and making me say to him,  "OK, Boomer."  Got it.
I'm already counting on Biden 4- Harris- 8...probably need that much time make a dent in the mess we are in
Can people discussing settling for Biden/ not voting for Biden explain to me who you think is going to win the presidency if it‚Äôs not Trump or Biden. I don‚Äôt like Biden but I‚Äôm genuinely curious as to why people think our electoral college system is going to allow anyone else
President Trump was asked about Joe Biden's Vice Presidential pick, Sen. Kamala Harris at this evening's coronavirus press briefing. He said, "...we‚Äôll see how she works out. She did very, very poorly in the primaries..." and that he was "a little surprised that he picked her."
She was picked because Antifa/BLM (who run the Democrat Party) know they can walk all over her, and assert their insane will on the American People once she is in office (not like Biden will be there long)
Ummm, her exact quote began, "I will direct this at vice president Biden, I do not believe you are a racist..."  That is kind of the opposite smearing him as racist.  What a startling lack of knowledge, or manipulation of a message to get clicks.
(Biden beat Sanders 55-40 in Dane County in April but I'd guess Sanders did better within SD26.)
Three Madison wards in (70,73,77).  Roys/Nada well &gt; Biden/Sanders in all three.
Kamala will destroy Pence but Trump is gonna bully Biden bad in the debates #BidenHarris #TrumpFailedAmerica
Let's see...  Trump/Pence want to arrest me for supporting antifa over oligarchy.  Biden/Harris want to arrest me for supporting antifa over oligarchy.  Decisions, decisions.
Bwahahahahahahahaha!!!  (This pick means that Biden wants to keep Mnuchin on as Secretary of Treasury.)
In all three polls, Trump earns largely negative reviews for his handling of the presidency.
Let's! I am for Biden &amp; Harris!
Look, if you can get close to Biden for a few minutes and tell a plotless story about growing up in central Pennsylvania, you're in.
Presumably because Biden has chosen his running mate, people on my TL are coming out of the woodwork to say that they'll watch the debates even though their minds are already made up.  Nobody's undecided this far into any presidential election cycle if they're paying attention.
I was hoping for Joe Biden to pick  really wanted a new gym twerking video. ü§§   Guess I'll just have to go watch this one a few more times. üòè
Shitlibs: "Don't nominate Bernie, they will call him a socialist."  The left: "They'll call anyone that. At least nominate someone who excites people."  Shitlibs: "No, you toxic, divisive Bernie Bros."  The right: "Biden and Harris are Marxists who want to kill God."
I am SO glad Biden didn't pick Susan Rice.
Wisconsin Democrats applaud Joe Biden's selection of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate while opponents call it a radical decision.
Yah. Biden‚Äôs pick is important, but also somewhat irrelevant. Anyone who changes their mind on voting for Biden this year based on his VP pick is a dolt

I will give them this:  "Biden/Harris"   looks better on a yard sign than  "Biden/üêçüêçüêçüêçüêç"
Harris pointedly let Mnuchin off the hook for his fraud during the mortgage crisis.   Does the pick mean Biden is planning on "turning the page" on Trump and letting them all off the hook if they win?  I think so.
***sigh***  Usually love you, Mark, but I just can't care about a Biden/Harris ticket.  Push them to give me something positive to care about besides "not Trump."
Biden isn't an autocrat though. üòî
Biden/Harris  Let‚Äôs put AA out of business...
Biden was my last choice but if you told me Biden's running mate was a clone of Biden, but with a wig and a falsetto, I would vote for Biden/Biden over Trump or anything the GOP has to offer even if Trump's Big Mac and Adderall caught up to him.  #ALLin #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
FOX NEWS: "Biden trying to remove the only African American female from the US Senate"Yes. Once Biden is elected and we flip the Senate, we need to let Congress know that the USPS serves us and while efficiencies needs to be looked at, we don't expect to make a profit.
Considering Donald Trump and Joe Biden are on live tv almost everyday and will be for the next 3 months, I‚Äôd say Lou Holtz is the least of our worries.
Don‚Äôt worry, Biden and Harris will win so we won‚Äôt have to worry about Dumb and Dumber anymore.
The fact that a Fox poll shows more of the liberal vote share locked in for Biden than the conservative vote locked in for Trump says a lot.

Watching Twitter explode about how nice it is that a #POTUS nominee can speak in complete sentences is hysterical considering Biden is the worst speaker of the bunch. It‚Äôs truly infuriating
Exactly! Vote Biden/ Harris, they undo the damage Trump did and start working towards Medicare For All, climate change, college affordability, etc. If Trump wins again, progressive reform is not happening
Biden also lost presidential primaries before *checks notes* being the vice president raised his profile
Meh. Biden kinda sucks and you're just along for the ride. I'm voting for Biden because it's really the only choice. Don't fuck it up
Biden has been the only one to mention a plan to try and fix the divide in America between races. Donald Trump has only stood up for one race. The white population.
Lmao if you thought I wasn‚Äôt voting for Biden before I‚Äôm sure as hell not now
This poll is such gibberish Twitter asked me if it needed translating. How are they gonna put Biden +6 in AZ but only +3 in MN?
trump ain‚Äôt got shit on Joe and I watch these ads on tv saying he will defund the police and the commercial shows Biden saying one word and that‚Äôs it its a lie he has no integrity if he lies on a ad come to show what else he lieing about
My favorite Joe Biden thing ever was him completely thrashing Paul Ryan in the 2012 debates
a possible #VPPick for
Agreed similarly I think especially with black voters: some  may only want to vote black (and there does seem to be slightly softer support among black voters for Biden then in the primary) but overall I think this is clearly part of the Trump electoral college strategy
