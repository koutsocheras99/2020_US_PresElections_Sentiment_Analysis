I'm sorry Chris Ruddy, you are not helping the COVID-19 situation.  You are not dealing with any reality and it will cause more deaths.  Please don't defend Trump, help him. Trump must order mandatory mask use in all 50 states.

But you and Trump have no responsibility for 150 thousand dead Americans? You're a traitor.
If the margins are unprecedentedly big, Trump will declare them proof of cheating.
Dude, Trump is the guy bungling this whole thing. There's been playbooks to handle pandemics since 1946 but Trump straight up threw out the current one because it had to do with the Obama administration. A global issue is an everybody issue, not a political one.

I will vote. I voted by mail in my local primary just yesterday. I‚Äôll vote by mail in the general election. It will be my pleasure to vote against Trump.
I believe Tulsa attendees were REQUIRED to sign some kind of indemnification form to release trump campaign from COVID liability.
Of course, any information that makes Trump look bad is false. Information that makes Trump look good is always true. MAGA core logic.
Pompeo didn‚Äôt know any of what you just tweeted. He is a West Point honor grad, Harvard law grad, SecState. Are you sure you‚Äôre right? I mean surely Pompeo would know, right? Plus he talks with trump regularly, so I‚Äôm sure he has an inside track here.
Because they go straight to blaming Trump~
You must also condem the entire GOP as they have made trump their tool to do the damage - none worse and critical than McConnell; he must be denied control of the senate which he uses to obstruct only.
He is very dangerous right now at this very moment. He is a bottom dweller. no such thing as to low for Trump. Nothing should surprise anyone.
Made a republican tiktok so I could get them to trust me with their secrets but I was thinking that maybe if I made videos and then one where I was like ‚Äúguys my parents are kicking me out bc I support trump here‚Äôs my Venmo any funds help‚Äù so if you see my videos mind ur buisness
This is not as comforting as your handlers think it is. I REALLY like it when President Trump tweets.
Having a rethink here, Obama's wrong place, wrong time, wrong tone speech on the heels of the shameful Democrats in the Barr hearing &amp; the despicable reaction to Cain's passing by media can only serve to motivate more people to vote for President Trump.

But i thought you said this trump virus was a hoax.
Virginia‚Äôs governor and two U.S. senators have urged President Trump to respond to the nation‚Äôs worst coronavirus outbreak that has occurred inside an immigrant detention center.
Are a million dead Iraqis really a ‚Äúpresidential failing‚Äù?  That sounds much more like Genocide to me.   Is Trump worse? Probably. Is he more embarrassing? Absolutely. But why on Earth are people rehabilitating a mass murderer like GWB?
Although Trump loves the spectacle, much of border enforcement happens behind the scenes: "287(g)‚Äôs success lies in its ability to operate out of sight. It‚Äôs not a raid; it‚Äôs just paperwork" writes
Nthing will be more frustrating than libs rehabilitating George "A million Iraqis are dead because of me" Bush.  Is Trump worse? Probably, but ffs what are you doing giving this guy a pass?  GWB Wasn't a good man in over his head. He committed GENOCIDE! What is wrong with you?
There‚Äôs at least 1.5 million dead people between those three alone. Most of them are on Bush, but Clinton and Obama have a body count that would make anyone squeamish.   Trump is worse than all of them, but you disgrace these peoples victims by worshiping them.
Maybe only Hitler would give trump the time of day!

Yes, we saw a bit of that; at first we had 23 different tests, none of which met a reasonable accuracy standard. We had PPE handling going through auctions, then stolen by Feds, then trafficked through Trump affiliate companies, now he won't regulate drug pricing
She's prioritizing the American people who can't get tested in a timely manner. If you want to be tested every day, you should tell Trump to use the DPA to mass-produce the 15 minute rapid test for ALL Americans. At least you would be making yourself useful for once. #TrumpVirus

You are 100% right about that. Just as ‚ÄúActing‚Äù officials can‚Äôt be held to any standards, ragtag bullies from a patchwork of agencies are not adhering to a code of conduct as real military would. Cheat and lie and exploit loopholes is Trump‚Äôs modus operandi.
Bc they don‚Äôt want to admit trump was right

Mahalo! My new take: I will vote for Biden, but he‚Äôll still lose. He loses many votes for opposing MFA, so, beating trump means demanding that Biden learn that his public option won‚Äôt work. Either Biden supports Jayapal‚Äôs MFA, or trump wins. I‚Äôm not attacking, I‚Äôm begging: #M4A
LMFAOO FUCK TRUMP YA HEARDD
Ugh my family is so annoying. Half of them like Trump the other have hates trump. And I‚Äôm like leave me alone üò©

We have all seen the tasteless monstrosity of an apartment where the #Trump family lives. I don't want #Melania decorating ANYTHING near our White House.
GEEZ  ! Get it together! Don't fail again!! America will not survive another Trump Administration!
Bill Barr is the only one beside Trump that I have faith in bringing big name Democrats to justice.
Democrats at work. These are the people National Parks support.  We need Trump to bring back law and order.

I just found out my sister-in-law, who with my brother and their live-at-home-32-year-old son voted for Jill Stein in 2016, is going to vote for Trump this time because "the finance people think he's doing a good job." They're Mormon "Christians." God, I hate my family sometimes.
Saw this on Newsmax...
The Trump campaign is probably buying thousands of copies to artificially inflate your pathetic book sales. Even then, you can't compete with your cousin Mary. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£  Just a corrupt way to transfer campaign donations into your personal bank account fleecing your donor üêë.
Why anyone would still vote for tRump is beyond me.....smdh

No outrage, they‚Äôre trump voters
why would anyone vote for trump? especially people of color. he‚Äôs literally a threat to our well-being. instead of arresting the killers of peaceful black men and women, he arrested the people who fought for the right thing. if you can‚Äôt see that, take a nap and never wake up
I remember in 2016, people were worried about voting for a woman b/c in their eyes, women were to emotional. Well, Trump seems to be 10x worse than anyone, even a 5yo kid who just got his toy taken away. If he can't handle twitter comments how does he handle other World Leaders?

Trump wasn‚Äôt even invited. He was jealous of Dr. Fauci and asked Yankees if he could throw out the first ball, taking everyone aback. Now that he realizes they don‚Äôt want him, he says that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs too busy.‚Äù Saving face is very important to Donnie.
Every trump boast is a lie. Every trump attack is a personal admission of guilt.   Since trump is boasting about it, I have to assume he failed it.  Like he fails everything he attempts.   Of course, we‚Äôve witnessed his dementia in real time.  Didn‚Äôt need a test.
trump's America is one with NO truth ... nothing but lies
As bad as we were, Trump is making it worse.. As bad as we were, we were a world power, we had other countries respect, and more and more people now think this is ok, back then, some people hid this.. Glad we get to see the real people now though..
Some guy on here tweeted that he would kill me and people like me who shared my beliefs, and then he followed me to see my reaction if Trump won, so I think the first thing I'm going to do is actually tweet that guy and rub it in his face
Makes sense to me, the whole statement is both hate and ignorance.. why bring race into a gaming tweet? Using the N word and calling them animals.. Then you got Playstation and America, really? Does he not realize Trump is turning America into a shit hole country?
The DC National Guard commander will testify tomorrow that the Lafayette Square protesters were peaceful and were subjected to "excessive use of force" ... all so that trump could stage a fake photo op  #DictatorTrump

I believe the plan was to do a land swap and put the HQ outside of DC because it was cheaper and sell/lease the land in DC to a developer for a luxury hotel.  Trump scuttled it  because he was afraid it was take business away from his hotel.  #MAGA
Trump is America‚Äôs first dictator. His use of federal troops in U.S. cities is a a dry run for a declaration of martial law in an effort to hold on to power if he loses the election in November. American democracy is already dead. The BLM movement is playing right into his hands.
Wow, please read the whole article. It's so evil that FBI top officers abused their power and Clinton machine tired to destroy Trump with makeup stories. Waiting for Mr. Barr to proscute these evil criminals.

If you can't see that Trump is an authoritarian you're incapable or unwilling to pay close enough attention. If this nation were cognizant of the lessons of its history a protoge of Roy Cohn would have been disqualified by "we the people" from the outset. Google Vera Coking.

Hard to walk back Trump's anti-mask rhetoric, isn't it...  Trump has done more to sabotage the #TrumpVirus pandemic response than any single person in the US.  He is the #BenedictDonald for the #TrumpVirus who has led the moron GOP governors and their people to damnation.
If Trump's lips are moving, there √† better than even chances, he's lying. Exaggeration is all he's got.
"President Trump‚Äôs rhetoric has been overtly partisan and political, focusing his ire on states and cities he labels as ‚ÄúDemocrat‚Äù or ‚ÄúRadical Left.‚Äù The president‚Äôs words clearly politicize DHS‚Äôs response."

Not a big conspiracy buff, but I still think this all seems like very familiar, staged theatrics, similar to what went on with China deal, NK negotiation etc. I just wonder how much big pharma is in on the narrative Trump is dropping...
Trump's handling of coronavirus made it considerably worse. But yeah, keep deflecting
Nope, I'm just going to vote people like Trump and McConnell out of office, and start to shape the country in the way I want to see it
- do you track "positivity" during the annual flu season?  Or are negative numbers only important to Democrats this year - when President Trump is running for reelection?  Your hypocrisy is glaring .. your ignorance is well known.
It‚Äôs reasonable for trump to say the Covid-19 virus pandemic will just go away. He warned of caravans of rapists &amp; gang members coming to kill us, &amp; they just disappeared. He said Mexico would pay for the wall, &amp; the Mexican pesos just disappeared. And soon he will disappear.
It would be reported as weakness. He needs to debate trump, call him on all his BS but mainly to look healthy, sane, like a leader.

Trump ruined a great economy, just like he ruined all his casinos, all his properties and all his children.
The really incomprehensible fact though, is that there are a lot of well-educated people, otherwise intelligent people, who support and think like trump. Being uneducated and uninformed or disinterested can be understood if not forgiven, but how can intelligent people do so?
Are you going to subtract the thousands of deaths caused by a certain Democrat governor who dictated that nursing homes MUST take COVID-19 positive patients?  Or that's on President Trump too?
At a minimum, Trump should be thinking of the time when his own precious carcase is memorialized, and that he'd hope it would be respected. But no.
