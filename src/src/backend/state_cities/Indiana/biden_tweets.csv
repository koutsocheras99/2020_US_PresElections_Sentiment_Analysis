I was really looking forward to a WWE style promo of Biden calling out God.
So, what we have in office right now is more religious than Biden? How many divorces has Biden had?
For people who are saying that Kanye West will cause Donald Trump to be re-elected, perhaps the Democratic Party should have put up a stronger candidate than Joe Biden, or Biden could do more to appeal to voters.
Biden, Hunter, and many many more. I haven‚Äôt even begun to connect the dots on the right side of the isle yet.  has!!!
HAVE YOU PAID ANY ATTENTION TO YOUR BOY BIDEN?? THE MAN CANNOT GET STATISTICS CORRECT AT ALL‚ÄºÔ∏è BIDEN HAS BEEN A CAREER POLITICIAN HIS WHOLE LIFE WHY DIDNT HE GET THINGS DONE UNDER OBAMA??? HES FADING FAST‚ÄºÔ∏è
Not true! You know Biden is Scared to debate Trump right!?? FACT‚ÄºÔ∏è
Joe Biden is a laughing stock. He doesn‚Äôt know where he is half the time. He can‚Äôt complete a sentence. He was in government for 40 years. Never did a damn thing. He is a racist.
Yes perhaps she should check in to a mental hospital.  Biden does not stand a chance.  Everyday more minorities and LGBT community members #WalkAway from the left.
I see a few Biden here in Indiana.  Maybe 1 sign every 10 miles...lol
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
Hello Mr. Biden. My wife and I are on disability an both under 50. If I vote for you, will I still have an income in the future? Thanks for your time.
Except Trump is a leader. Takes no pay. Securing the boarder.  Low taxation.  Confronts China. Makes NATO pay. So many other things that help not hurt the country.  Biden Obama just the opposite.  They and family getting filthy Rich.
Chris Wallace challenges Biden to follow Trump on 'Fox News Sunday,' says ex-VP must 'get into game shape'
If Biden wins and Dems take back the Senate, I think they‚Äôre done playing nice for once. They‚Äôre gonna nuke the filibuster and start flexing their muscles.
At Noon on January 20, 2021, Joe Biden officially becomes President, regardless of what Trump claims.  It just becomes a matter of getting him out of The White House.
Does Joe mean: ‚ÄúAll 90 days of his, (Biden‚Äôs), Presidency?‚Äù  Hello President Kamala... ü§¢
Nothing funny about Biden as Potus. He is a danger to our country.
Watch Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, break down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control
Biden though? He is a puppetImagine if Former VP Joe Biden came to the microphone at his podium and said, "China, if you are listening...".
Indiana does not have a vote by mail option, but we can vote early to avoid crowds. We‚Äôll wear masks, social distance, and use hand sanitizer. If I die from COVID as a result, I will consider it my patriotic duty and an honor. Because I voted for Biden.
Biden is using ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù as his slogan. I‚Äôve never seen a less inspired campaign. But at this point Trump seems completely disengaged from the election.
#BREAKING: U.S. intelligence agencies warn that Iran and Russia are working to undermine the election of Former VP Joe Biden - and that China is working to undermine the re-election of Donald Trump.
i have an observation about biden supporters: the fact that they know he's a shit sandwich only heightens the extent to which they are already angry when they begin tearing into you for criticizing his record
We need to get rid of 45 asap and get Biden in there immediately
I think it will because you have betto helping Biden
I wish. But I think your state will be the shocker to 45 losing.  What other city in Arizona can Biden turn around this November besides the two I mentioned
Racist policies + racist words = racist person aka Biden. Half of America either doesn't see it or ignores it because "at least your not Trump," although your rhetoric is much more racist than anything Trump has said.
One of the agencies where Biden should fire literally everyone at the top on day one.
He's a MAGA supporter anyways. Hard to convince him to vote for Joe Biden.
Trump has tweeted/retweeted 13 times this morning attacking the FBI investigation (Crossfire Hurricane), U.S. election system, China, TikTok, and Joe Biden.
Joe Biden on the view this is funny hearing him ramble when they bring up his inappropriate touching
thank you for voting for Biden this November god bless from a Democrat
thank you for voting for Biden this November god bless from a Democrat
I feel positive that Biden will win Florida.  Keep spreading the word
Amen god bless.  Please Arizona turn blue we need you.  This shows Biden cares and a true president
To protect the 2nd we must 1st keep Biden out of office
I think Biden needs Phoenix Tempe and one more area.
Hey look it's Joe Biden finally taking his cognitive test
As a Christian, I hope trump will win. He‚Äôs not the best the republicans have to offer, but he‚Äôs leaps and bounds better than Biden.
Joe Biden Says All Black People Think Alike  via    The Hodge Twins are funny.
That's why we need Biden.  He can heal this country
Is betto advertising for Biden alot
45 doesn't know what hes talking about. Biden cares loves and respects
please get Texas to blue for Biden.  How do I donate to your campaign
I knew who I was voting for before Biden won the democratic nomination because any Democrat this year is better then the alternative. I knew who I would be voting for this Nov in 2016
needs 201 more followers please follow her so we can get her brother vote for Biden
also how are you doing and do you think your brother will vote for Biden if you don't get to 1000 followers
Amen god bless.  Biden cares and would save all lives
Biden cares about everyone.  45 thinks Biden doesn't care about god. Ugh we need 45 out asap and Biden asap
I also want to vote for Biden. He can pick a ham sandwich for VP, it would be better than Pence.
Jill, I heard that Joe Biden is going to pick Susan Rice instead of Kamala Harris.
A Trump campaign ad used doctored photos of Biden  via
I feel Strongly that, THey are Purposely waiting a week or Two  before election...maybe a month before...THey want to create a Huge momentum to Usher  HER ...yes...Her in...and All the indoctrinated twit‚Äôs will jump on the goat wagon.   THey want Her to Await Biden‚Äôs decline. üò≥
Not only are you not black if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden but you all think alike to.
Who is ready for the big announcement to come up for Biden üòÉ
Held the bible backwards in front of a church for a stupid photo op after peaceful protester's were rammed down.  I don't think hes Christian.  Biden cares. Hes a true Christian
So the man who publicly mused about injecting people with disinfectant and cleaning their lungs just said Biden isn‚Äôt all there.
Creepy Racist Joe Biden, liberals tell me again how Donald Trump is racist again and how Joe Biden is such a great guy.
Comparing ethnic groups is certainly a bad look in 2020, but I get what Biden‚Äôs trying to say‚Äîhe‚Äôs talking about ‚Äúvoting blocs‚Äù. If you‚Äôre an entrenched politician, a modernday democrat especially, you see *everything* as voting blocs. You can‚Äôt speak for regular people anymore.
#TrumpCrimeFamily WATCH: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand In The Way Of A Trump Prosecution
Biden will win though.  I know he has Pennsylvania and Michigan.  Just need 1 more
I've heard from 3 or 4 other people on here they think Florida can go to Biden
Not well because of the current vp was governor of the state. also I saw a 45 2020 flag in a Walmart parking lot. I've seen a couple of Biden and Bernie stickers.
Be persecuting Christians, but I still feel like america will hit a road block or something drastic would change if Biden was president, and it scares me.
Let me clarify why I feel this way. Let me preface by saying, in no way is trump the best president, not even close. I still support him but he could be better. My problem is, as a Christian, i Don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be headed if Biden was president. I highly doubt he would
Love that.  I feel very positive in your state due to what's happening currently I bet your state doesn't like 45 like they did in the past and you can spend the word to vote for Biden one time
Ben, honest question, do you think Trump will win? Because every day I think about the ramifications of Biden winning, and it scares. It legitimately scares me, and I have to distract myself from reality to become calm again.
Creepy Sleepy Joe Biden could never be a leader because he never knows where he's at and always forgets where he's going.
I'm voting for Biden because of everything 45 isn't
Because Trump is a true leader, Biden can't lead because he never knows where he is
I texted this number and since I wasn't one of the first to sign up I didn't get the answer. They sent me a link to sign up but I stopped all other text because, Fuck Biden
That's why I feel positive because of betto. If betto is advertising for Biden it helps.
And yet Orange Man Bad is the racist and Biden is your savior. Orange Man Bad 2020
What‚Äôs funny about trump saying that Biden is controlled by the radical left is that Biden‚Äôs policies are generally right of center
are you close where Biden lives
A Biden fundraiser where we tell him our vices and he just yells advice at everyone. ‚ÄúHi I‚Äôm Dave from Albuquerque and I have a bit of a shopping problem.‚Äù ‚ÄùA PROBLEM? YOU HAVE 17 CREDIT CARDS YOU HAVENT TOLD YOUR SPOUSE ABOUT SHRED THEM AND GO GET A THERAPIST.‚Äù
We got that from Trump and we got Biden asking a African American reporter if he is on cocaine.  Nice country.
Trump will win mostly due to pandemic-aided voter suppression and because the trump-loving racists that will come out in droves. Biden will screw up the VP pick from the looks of it and once again we will snatch defeat from jaws of victory.
Just like joe Biden.
I believe Biden needs to announce VP and some key Cabinet appointments at the same time. Warren VP. Harris AG, Susan Rice Secretary of State,  Michelle Obama Secretary of Education,  etc...  All women! It's their time to straighten this shit out!  #CabinetofWomen
Amen god bless.  Thank you for voting for Biden this November from a Democrat
To everyone what states will Biden win that will put him over 270
Biden would do alot more for north Carolina than 45 would.  Prayers for your state
dem sweetheart criticizes trump for not being good enough at coups!  surely they can't be gearing up to revitalize the us war machine under a biden presidency......
I believe Biden needs to announce VP and some key Cabinet appointments at the same time. Warren VP. Harris AG, Susan Rice Secretary of State,  Michelle Obama Secretary of Education,  etc...  All women! It's their time to straighten this shit out!    ??
Have you seen that tape where Biden can‚Äôt pronounce ‚ÄúYosemite‚Äù? It‚Äôs painful.
If you run into a smartass by the name of, Joe Biden will end racism, handle  their on our side. They have a pro Trump page. I will admit the fucker had me going, and I think it hilarious. üëçüëç   that was great üòÜüëç
Truth Biden in plain sight
The pro Trump stuff on the page got me to realize too and the black face Biden pic made me laugh even harder
I am sorry but Bass  - who? Talk about a lead balloon level deflater. Biden-Harris is our best hope. Otherwise, we are setting ourselves up for another November surprise!!
When is the Joe Biden video coming out? He must be doing interviews right?
Good luck with that Fuck Biden  Trump Landslide Victory 2020
Biden's white senile racist and can't remember shit most of the time so how's he gonna end racism. And if he did you couldn't be racist anymore, didn't think of that did ya
You're are just starting the chant for when Biden whips your ass.
No problem.  All of Biden supporters need to follow each other and not think about 45
It's hard to with 45 In office.  We need Biden asap
Please follow  by next Friday. we need to get over 1000 followers then we can get another vote for Biden when this happens. thank you and God bless to everyone
A B S O L U T E L Y  Exactly Right About That  She IS who ... i mean ... That IS Who  I am MOST frightened &amp; concerned about  who the Dems put with Biden.   IF Biden is elected ... he Better be checking his food &amp; drinks , if u know what I mean.  Bill &amp; Hillary Know people.
one place where I found where you can get followers back is turn Texas blue Republicans for Biden and click follow . Most of them will follow back
Thank you for voting for Biden this November by the way. I love seeing voters in these important states vote for Biden.  It will make a bigger victory for him in November
to all Texans.  Biden made a video today with thoughts and prayers for what happened in el Paso a year ago and I pray for your state too. The question is did you see 45 give condolences about what happened a year ago In your state remember that November 3rd?
I cant believe he spelled Florida wrong and he has a resort there what's up with that.  If I lived in Florida and saw that I would vote for Biden a snail anyone but 45
I think it quite possible he would end up pulling as many voters from Trump as Biden.
Please get more followers to Biden we need more followers for Biden than 45 has 83 million to go who is with me
Thank you for voting for Biden this November god bless from a Democrat
Biden Leading Trump Among Voters Who Favor Being Alive  via
Having lived through Reagan and GWB, Biden seems like an amateur in this activity.
Oh, no Presidential debates? Okay. No election. üòâ  These libs are frightened to have Biden have to think and speak for himself. He even needs someone holding his hand to help him walk out of a building.   American public needs to see where candidates stand 1v1.  #MAGA2020
As an aside, I think it‚Äôs going to be Warren. I could be wrong, but I‚Äôve been getting a lot of emails lately from the Biden campaign about ‚ÄúJoe‚Äôs friend Elizabeth‚Äù
Does Joe Biden know where Joe Biden is?
The late great Robin Williams making fun of Biden.
Can we add "Join People Who Don't Want To Die for Biden"?
Bden's VP pick would be better president than Biden unless he goes with Bloomberg who disgusts me.  just sayin'
Not to mention that Biden will have declared victory as well. And when Secretaries of State begin certifying the results, Trump‚Äôs words will be even more meaningless and impotent.
If Biden is winning by 10 points when the polls close, the networks will have called the race. It won‚Äôt matter what Trump says.
My rational mind is saying: ‚Äúoh this looks favorable for Biden.‚Äù My emotional mind is saying:‚ÄùNO!! DANGER! NEVER UNDERESTIMATE HOW RACIST THIS COUNTRY IS. MF WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE.‚Äù My wise mind doesn‚Äôt know what to do so is on Twitter and apparently spreading misinformation
It's dummy Joe Biden being controlled by Winnie the Pooh
I want to Make America Great Again like it was when Obama was president. Trump already did that by screwing things up so Biden will win.
Hopefully Biden/Harris
We can't be nervous we just need to vote more than ever and convince others to vote for Biden for just 1 time.  Cook them a meal babysit anything to make them vote for Biden
Amen god bless.  Let's get Biden a very big blue tidal wave #Biden2020
If 45 has a health care plan it will be worse than what we have now. He probably wants health care for the rich not the poor and disabled. We need Biden now
It's promising though.  I know Biden can win if we get more Republicans to wake up. we have to keep spreading the word
thank you for your service and thank you for voting for Biden this November
You approvingly quoted this: ‚ÄúAside from litigating, what's the D party doing about it? What is the political plan? When will Biden/Pelosi talk about it?‚Äù So am I answering the questions asked, not the ones not asked.
Two weeks ago:
Lol, I like to make wild claims too...  A vote for Biden means the moon is square!
Your tweet is crappola in more than one way, Elizabeth. Joe Biden being careful and prudent, apparently, isn‚Äôt exactly the overarching issue of the day. Take a friggin‚Äô chill pill.
Who said you can't criticize Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi? Who else can you vote for? The Grand Old White Man's Party? Please...
like y'all are probably putting in more effort to get biden a win than his entire campaign. maybe put that energy into actual change?? biden in office doesn't solve any problems trump has created or perpetuated
‚ÄòNOT a joke‚Äô: Dan Bongino has the ‚Äòscoop‚Äô on Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline and it‚Äôs just getting WORSE and worse for the Democrats  via
I think that Juli√°n Castro would be a better running mate for Biden, esp. in terms of reaching out to the young, Latino, and leftist/progressive voters who supported Bernie than just about any of the women whose names are thrown around, but, ya know, he promised to pick a woman.
I think he's a Trojan horse for Killary Killaton to sneak in after her 2016 loss I've believed that since it came down to Biden vrs. Trump
This guy makes a great point, do we really want Biden to get control of the Nuclear Football? That would be devastating to the entire world.
Even in his younger years Joe Biden said nothing but dumb shit. He actually called himself the token black women....what Creepy Joe.
Alright! Let's MAGA like it was when Obama was president! Vote Biden!
No matter who he picks, I will vote for Biden no matter who, the Republicans will spread all kinds of disinformation to try and affect the voters.  DO NOT LISTEN.
We need to vote like heck and get rid of 45 asap.  We need Biden now.  It will take time to fix things.  But we have to clean it up before it gets pure ugly
It will take time but to do that we need 45 out and not be voting for him. we need Biden asap.  45 is going to make everything worse.  Let's create a blue tidal wave crush November 3rd and 4th and saw told you so to 45 and goodbye
Family gatherings always end with me yelling, ‚Äúyou all are a bunch of libs‚Äù after I get called an idealist for criticizing Biden and the DNC üòÇ
One term? Maybe. I sometimes wonder if Biden's  still aware these days that  he's running for President.
Really wish it would be Rice- she can hit the ground running to get a handle on the virus, rebuilding State while Biden deals domestically- live Harris and Warren but they are needed in the Senate to get legislation through Congress to fix this mess we‚Äôve been given...
But they will be the first to complain when they dump this mess on Biden- we‚Äôve played this game before in 2008- may their actions burn in the memories of the American people for all time- they have defiled the Constitution
This is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. This is Joe Biden AOC level dumb.
Joe Biden pandering to Muslims and quoting the Quran.
No one should care about who Biden picks as VP stop complaining. the most important thing is to get 45 out now asap instantly
Here's the video by Salty Cracker about Biden saying lock up rioters
Joe Biden has just pissed off the left. Joe Biden said that's it time for the rioters and looters to be locked up and that the need to be in jail.  Fuck!!!!!  Joe Biden actually said something I agree with.
Ari Fleischer thinks assuming Trump will attempt lawless things is ‚Äúirresponsible.‚Äù  thought it was irresponsible of Biden to suggest Trump might want to delay the election. That was in April. Trump will always make you look like an authoritarian-loving fool.
I agree I felt American when Bush and Obama and Biden were in office everyone cared. Now with 45 in feel alot of more people are hating and I feel 45 wants to start a civil war in our own country. Honestly if 45 won I know he won't be if he did I would prefer to move to Canada
I'm reading tweets from other Republicans I've blocked because there are so rude about Biden.  Why are they so rude to him.  I wish they would wake up and go to a hospital and see people are really dying and need change and care with Biden
Thank you for voting for Biden this November from a Democrat. we need to be a team and crush 45
This shit is coming out of the ass of Biden's running mate.
Dr. Biden has a PhD, was the only second lady to hold a paying job while her husband was in office, and would be the most educated First Lady we‚Äôve ever had.  she is more than somebody‚Äôs wife. Give her the respect she deserves, dammit.
Wasn‚Äôt sure if  had a PhD or a medical degree. Asked: ‚ÄúAlexa, what is Jill Biden‚Äôs profession?‚Äù Alexa: ‚ÄúJill Biden is a political wife‚Äù üòê
That's a good choice!
That's what I love.  Keep up with these press conferences.  Only helps Biden creating a massive tidal wave this November
thank you for supporting Biden this November.  I can't stand 45s press conference.  What about you
No patriot will agree on mail in votes. Either wait for everything to open up for the election of open the polls up on November 3rd so we can have a fair and unbiased election. Let the people vote for their candidate instead of cheating to help Biden win.
Seriously my grandpa died of the virus.  Trump has no care. Biden wouldn't do this.
I think Biden had a great quote when someone asked him about that. Without looking it up, I think it was "The white house has a system for dealing with trespassers".
I don't know enough about them to have any particular opinion. I just know I'll vote for Biden no matter what, and I'll just have to go from there. For what little I've read about Abrams, I like her, but Harris seems like a force.
McConnell and McCarthy do not want to be tarred and feathered along with Trump.
if your thesis is that trump sustains inequality and your antithesis is that biden sustains inequality then isn't your synthesis that the election doesn't matter at all?
This + marijuana legalization = canary. Biden is in lead because he's lucky not smart
That's why Biden will make a big tidal wave in November over 45
If this is true then Biden just gave the victory to Trump. Rumors online that Biden may have picked his VP, Kamala Hairyass, if this is true Trump just won.
This doesn‚Äôt quite pass the smell test. Would guess the Biden ‚Äúallies‚Äù are just folks who prefer to boost a different candidate, for whatever reason. Kamala Harris is the most obvious choice, and quite likely the best choice. But I‚Äôm good with whichever finalist Joe selects.
Not just about Biden. The Epstein files too.
In fact I don‚Äôt think I pay enough in taxes, please President Biden, take my money!!
This is why we need to vote like never before for Biden.  Voting is so easy.  Heck a 5 year old could vote.  Vote by mail early voting anything.
That's not right hes not protecting our troops.  Hes suppose to protect all Americans. Right now over 150,000 dead and American troops dead. This should be impeachment.  We need Biden asap
We need 1 more state to be comfortable.  Which state do you think Biden will win to get over 270. I think Arizona
Biden looks trim and is dressed well, but being led by the arm doesn‚Äôt make for an inspiring image. Hard to imagine a recent president allowing this video to take place. Not that pols are pushed and led by aides, this just looks a bit too needy.
"Antifa are courageous Americans." - Joe Biden   Yes this was one of the dumb things Biden said.  "Antifa are peaceful protesters." - Joe Biden   Yes he's said that too, more then once.
Looks like they‚Äôre filming a remake ‚Äî ‚ÄúWeekend at Biden‚Äôs‚Äù
I'm in a Republican state too unfortunately where the currrent vp was governor of . Keep spreading the word.  Texas can turn around anything if Biden gets that and Republicans would be ticked off
The nation voted for joe Biden to be the democratic candidate, and he is already ahead in the polls. Yes, ppl can vote according to their beliefs, but we have to be realistic here....a vote for you is a vote for trump. Period.
I love the panda picture you have.  I've always been a Democrat.  We need Biden asap.  I can't take 4 more months of 45
just wondering are you voting for Biden or trumpNo one knows for sure how this is going to effect the voting.  Republicans think it will siphon minority and/or young votes from Biden.  There are just as likely discouraged R voters who don't like Trump, but won't vote for a Dem.
And if Biden somehow wins in November, EVERYTHING will magically open back up just fine in January.  And they'll probably give him a Nobel Peace Prize.
Thighland.  Brilliant.  Hope you don‚Äôt criticize Biden anytime soon‚Äîyou‚Äôve shit the bed on live tv more in the last 2 weeks than your depends can possibly hold.
The "you can't be Catholic and support Biden" has already started, much sooner than in the 2016 election cycle.  I cannot imagine the homilies we will have to endure in the weeks leading up to November.  It will be an exhausting 88 more days.
How‚Äôs your elite friends doing? We all know you and Biden got a dinner date to discuss the next plan and scheme. Just tell the people your all a hoax, people are catching on it‚Äôs all a shit show and reality tv condensation. Give us our government back it‚Äôs obvious both sides
Tonight!  Join Dr. Myers and Indiana for Joe Biden as we talk healthcare.

Ye getting weaponized as a GOP pawn to ticket split Biden is I guess where we‚Äôre at in 2020.
Biden clearly thinks blacks can‚Äôt make that decision. ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù And ‚ÄúBlacks aren‚Äôt diverse.‚Äù Meanwhile President Trump has made black lives better with lowest black unemployment, criminal reform and freedom and opportunity for ALL races. #Trump2020Landslide
It‚Äôs not an imaginary scenario. It‚Äôs an educated assumption. If you‚Äôre not willing to admit this is how most Biden endorsers operate, than you‚Äôre just as unable to admit when you‚Äôre wrong as trump is. Have a great day
Joe Biden is really out here trying to compete with George Washington for lowest total black vote
Yes, but if this was trump you would be throwing a fit. How are y‚Äôall not noticing how much Biden exposes your hypocrisyüò≠
Every time Repubes post about ‚Äúthat Biden video was *hard to watch*‚Äù I wonder to myself if they think it‚Äôs hard to watch the President ignore Russian bounties, or rail on about water pressure, or say Biden will ‚Äúhurt the Bible, hurt God‚Äù? You think this shit is *easy to watch*?
Biden can choose my oldest most battered garden gnome and it will possess more drive and intellectual agility than Trump's entire cabinet. And he'll have my vote regardless.
Very old crime bill. Yes it only addresses federal prisons but it is much more progressive then the 1994 crime bill and what Biden is currently offering. We must do way better then his current plan to address our policing issues in this county ‚úäüíØ
Biden is barely visible in his own campaign, has someone tweet his apologies for racism, transphobia, xenophobia, classism and ableism.  I hate it here
Yeah... lowering the age for Medicare to 60 and strengthening private insurance via ACA is totally halfway to single payer M4A...   Giving the police $300 million is totally halfway to defunding them...  What about Biden's policies makes you think he's met us "halfway?"
This was a just sad.
Joe Biden is a puppet. Let the man grieve over the loss of his family. He has yet to do that! He does not have the mental capacity to run a country. Let‚Äôs keep the current president he‚Äôs doing a fine job!
Fascinating article, Hunter. I came across this one today, too. I feel that from a political science POV, a center-right conception of a Christian Democratic party has no hope of breaking through. That politics is too close to what Joe Biden already is.

p sure jon was actually asking for input and perspectives instead of asking a rhetorical question, which i think is how you took it lol. but ur answer was pretty insightful into biden's background for those who didn't know
CNN: Instagram's algorithm blocked negative coverage of Trump, but not Biden.   via
As an atheist, the small, petty god Donald Trump appears to worship makes no fucking sense. Omnipotent, but apparently able to be outsmarted by Joe Biden.
As my wife,  , says - who needs Babylon Bee when you‚Äôve got Joe Biden?
Biden has no fucking clue what he is saying man. Just pure nonsense
"..Unlike the African American community ... the Latino community is an incredibly diverse.." so the African American community is not diverse. Does that make it easier to understand what Biden was saying?

Lmao I haven‚Äôt seen one Bernie supporter volunteering or campaigning for Biden. As far as I know he‚Äôs still a rapist that I‚Äôll never to vote for.
I pray President Trump is re-elected! Trump/Pence are better equipped to lead our nation than Joe Biden and any of his potential VP picks.
So, it ‚Äúprobably‚Äù exists. üòÇ Here‚Äôs some of the video we know exists:   Here‚Äôs what we also know: his conversion on this issue has been very late and politically expedient. But that‚Äôs Joe‚Äôs MO.
Yeah, you‚Äôre setting up a nice little false choice and strawman there. I never said ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù. I believe in international solidarity with freedom &amp; democracy movements worldwide. Unlike Joe Biden, I don‚Äôt believe in perpetual warfare, nor in business as usual at the Pentagon.
I agree that it is pointless to hold these debates. However, if Biden backs out, the Republicans will use that- saying he‚Äôs too scared. It‚Äôs not worth the possible loss of votes from people who will believe it. (See this thread)
BS. The only way that stuttering, dementia stricken Biden wins is if there is nationwide ballot fraud. He is no match for President Trump. Bring on the debates!
Now do Biden.. #cuck

Biden is a gifted orator, no doubt.
We can‚Äôt just build back to the way things were before these crises. We have to build a more inclusive, equitable future for all. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll do it:
Most establishment media polls show President Trump trailing in a matchup with Joe Biden, but a closer look at the data shows that most of these polls may be built simply to discourage conservative voters from showing up.   History repeats itself.
Twitter seems to have deleted the Biden video
Agree. Biden can misspeak and makes gaffes and the GOP will have a heyday with it.  Nothing to gain; he‚Äôs polling well.  Trump probably doesn‚Äôt want to debate but he‚Äôs a  bully and moderators don‚Äôt moderate properly.  They should mute for interrupting and going over time limit.
Biden would also be just a puppet.
üòÑ after reading the text I thought it was of Biden.

This should be part of Biden ads....he isn't doing any "Art of the Deal" so he is useless.
Is Biden prepping the Junior Soprano defense?
Biden agreed to debates in June...  but keep working hard at the smear while your boss can‚Äôt pronounce our most famous National Park.
Biden is going to be exhausted rescinding all of these Trump Executive Orders!
Just think.... every name known to have been on the flight log to Epstein‚Äôs pedo/rape island will be voting for Joe Biden. #DemocratsHateAmerica #Reprobates
I‚Äôm attending Ohio Democratic Party‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúNEO Presents: Biden Bookworms &amp; 'Banking‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me!
But it's Biden's mental acuity that must be questioned.
you must be nervous. lol. all the Biden bashing this morning....
I totally get what you are saying, but this is not normal, we must not put down biden, we need to back him as our life depends on it. We will kick his ass out of office if he sucks. We can do that, but we can't do anything if Trump gets 4 more years. Please no repeat of 2016!!
Awesome, I‚Äôll be there this Sunday for Biden‚Äôs Signs Across America relay event.
I'm voting for biden even if he's not doing everything we want, we can't have trump, let's not turn people off from voting for Joe please. We will have democrats making the changes he will be just fine compared to doofus Donnie!

There‚Äôs 0 benefit to the socialist Dems to debate because they know that Biden will be exposed for the blithering dementia case that he is. There is no way we should have a nominee that is protected and shielded from the American public. If he cannot debate he should be omitted
You saw no Biden supporters at a Trump rally. I wonder why genius.
‚Äúat what point do you educate your self‚Äù. That‚Äôs a fair question for you to ask yourself.  You going Biden?  The guy who supports abortion on demand and would cave to the left that wants it up to and even after birth?  That‚Äôs your party?
He‚Äôs giving Biden plenty of opportunities to say ‚Äòno‚Äô. Why?
He would better than Biden, maybe even his dad. Apparently the kid is brilliant and knows several coding languages.
Just tell them you are here illegally and you need it so you can vote for Biden.  They will probably deliver it to you.
Joe Biden is #unfit to be President. He didn‚Äôt write this tweet.
"..You realize that significantly more Trump voters than Biden voters are uneducated, right?.." you're not serious are you?
Actually, the card board cut out would do better than Joe Biden.
We all know. Trump will crucify Biden.
Biden is a puppet for the radical left.   Biden will increase taxes by trillions of dollars, reduce funding of the Police Departments across the US, give amnesty to 11 million illegals &amp; will destroy the middle class in America.  Solution-Vote for President Trump!
Wonder who‚Äôs going to give Biden the questions before hand?
Two awesome people.  BTW PFA people are meeting up in SB next Sunday to launch the Signs for Biden Across America campaign.
check our  we've got a sign program going in. Also we are looking for places to out up BIG BIDEN wooden signs and banners.  So yes, looking for locations and driving is a great way to help.
Folks Biden has proven 50yrs can't give Biden a positive record.  He proves he will say whatever things that will get him reelected.
Name one thing that Biden has actually done for this country to make it a better place. Cannot wait to hear your reply
Yep and he shut down China coming into the country and was called a racist and xenophobic from Hiden Biden.
Absolute truth. Biden would be removed from presidency within months. He‚Äôs just their safest bet to get votes.
We are supposed to think about phone banking, text banking, donating, lit dropping, postcard writing for Biden and the Dems down ballot, that‚Äôs whatüòÄ
...you don‚Äôt wanna vote trump or republican because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all racist‚Äù. Even though he‚Äôs done more for the African American citizens than Obama did in 8 years and Biden did in   40 years. Democrats only care about black lives because it helps them in the long run...
Yea, it‚Äôs unfortunate the  should have learned from President Obama winning - he ran a positive message and garnered a ton of excitement. Hillary ran on fear and lost. Now Biden will, too.
....Or joe Biden debate President Trump! ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Did you read about Bass and Scientology, Castro? Biden needs to pick wisely!! Someone we trust who is strong that is well-vetted because trump will capitalize on their weaknesses!!
I would vote for Biden/Bass.
Read this article, Bass can not be Biden‚Äôs running mate. It makes me sick thinking about what a catastrophe she would be!
I‚Äôm not voting for Trump. I‚Äôm not voting for Biden. Neither of them have earned my vote.  I won‚Äôt vote shame anyone. Vote as your conscience dictates.  Then let‚Äôs build the mallet that will bust this duopoly open like a pi√±ata.
News about Greenfield Central student positive #COVID19 case makes national news üòê. Story right before who Biden will pick for VP.
Biden is a weakness, not just foreign policy. We would be considered weak again.
I‚Äôd make the point that they don‚Äôt know if Trump or Biden will win, so they hedge their bets, throw money at both parties, and know that no matter who wins, ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù for rich people, as Biden said.
Just understand that most Americans don't want the police defunded, and the democrats, in many cities, sponsor that. That's a guarantee of 4 more years of   Also, the videos of Biden touching kids will turn many voters off.
I agree with  that these won't be debates, it will be the liar in chief making shit up and Biden having to stay in the real world  . These will be a joke.
So   started " Believers for Biden" then in a speech "accidentally" makes a call to Moslems to Jihad ! This is truely Disturbing ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è
You can thank Ronald Reagan and Joe Biden for our student loan debt crisis.
Well Trump just lost the youth vote... Middle schoolers will be voting Biden in #2020Election
So, any Dems who think we‚Äôre going to have any hope of getting even a shadow of progressivism out of Joe Biden are dreaming given that Joe has spent his entire candidacy and career spitting on the left while courting reactionaries and Wall Street bag men.
It remains to be seen whether Trump can hold it together. He‚Äôs got defections to Biden in droves. And the Biden Dems are more than happy to accommodate the #NeverTrump Republicans, which will only serve to further cement the Dems moving to the right on economics and war policy
Guess who‚Äôs working to turn the tide? It sure as hell ain‚Äôt Biden from his basement or Kamala and her cop friends.  It‚Äôs folks like SRA and Redneck Revolt teaming up with antifa anarchists and BLM protesters from Jackson, Mississippi, to Atlanta, Georgia, to Portland, Oregon.
Joe Biden was never president before. What jobs have YOU created!
Ridin‚Äô with Biden!

Imagine being a white liberal woman who wants folks to vote Biden so badly that she thinks no black people could possibly be anti-Biden leftists.  Have you not studied American history, Becca? Or American current events?
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
Joe Biden is expected to announce his running mate next week; all of the perceived frontrunners are pro-abortion &amp; support the LGBT agenda.  Given Biden's issues with mental fitness, his VP choice is likely to take over at some point, should he win.
As a (Black) suburban mother, I knew exactly what that coded language meant. He was saying if Biden is elected, the Black folk are moving to the suburbs(OMG!). Dude, we‚Äôre already here and we love it!
If Trump pounded a much better candidate and had no record the first time, his defeat of Biden will be epic.
I‚Äôve never considered voting for Joe Biden because he‚Äôs never considered Medicare for All, not even in the midst of a pandemic and not even when nearly 90 percent of Dem voters want it.
If Biden doesn‚Äôt want to move further left when he needs our votes the most, how are we gonna get him to even consider fighting for M4A, green new deal or any other progressive policies when he‚Äôs in office already? Please enlighten me..
I don‚Äôt know.  It‚Äôs 50/50.  Biden isn‚Äôt hated the way Hillary is.  If Biden avoids public speaking and debates, he just might win.
I‚Äôd be happy with any of the ladies but I‚Äôm putting my money on Rep. Val Demmings, she checks all the boxes and has the kind of gravitas to balance Biden out.
Biden won‚Äôt be writing them. Just like he doesn‚Äôt write them now. #DementiaJoe
Would I be able to make a sign and put it on my yard? Side of barn? On my truck? How about if I have a delivery truck, can I put political ads on it and pay someone to drive around? Can I buy a TV ad for Biden or Hale? I‚Äôd put ‚Äúpaid for by Rob‚Äù at the end üôÇ
Plus, some of the age/oratory jokes (while still in poor taste) might actually *land* if Biden‚Äôs opponent were, in contrast, cogent and able to descend a ramp.
Biden didn‚Äôt write this. It‚Äôs sick what the left is doing to this dementia stricken and confused man. #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin
Well. Biden is losing it. Doesn‚Äôt even know where he is half the time. And obviously I don‚Äôt have to explain Trump
Just saw an email about Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren having a fundraiser tomorrow, on the day that he's scheduled to make his VP pick. Hmmm
Another way to avoid unwanted hair is to avoid being a waitress for Dodd and Kennedy.
Pro-abortion groups have endorsed Joe Biden because his support for abortion is "compassionate."   How have we come to a place where abortion is defined as "compassionate‚Äù?
‚ÄúIf Joe Biden wins  . . . young black lives will have next to no chance of their schools improving in the next four years‚Äù   The black lives most at risk are inner-city school children. A Biden presidency won‚Äôt help them, writes   via
Biden has NO accusations of rape. None. Tara Reade accused him of assault but her story and motive was questionable
If you want to defeat Trumpism, not just the man, then Joe Biden ain‚Äôt your guy.  Joe Biden said ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù if he‚Äôs elected.  He‚Äôll set the conditions for Trumpism to come back with a vengeance in 2022 and 2024.  We don‚Äôt have time for this.
Isn‚Äôt the point that the Federal Government shouldn‚Äôt dictate local zoning against the wishes of a state or city?    IE. the Biden/Sanders/Booker plan to start enforcing Obama‚Äôs Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing initiative.
Could Barack Obama serve in the Biden Administration?  Secretary of State ... asking an expert.
Harris is not going to help get the black vote because, to quote Biden, 'you aint that black!'
Listen to the scientific evidence. Biden is lucid and in a daydream of dementia.
Best neighbors I could ever have: Hispanic, Korean, Slovakian, Chinese, Black, White, Indian, Irish, and more. All awesome  AMERICAN Neighbors! YOU DO NOT REPRESENT ME! YOUR ‚Äúnews‚Äù disgusts me! YES I‚ÄôM VOTING FOR BIDEN!
Biden has dementia, his shuffling walk, confused speech, someone constantly leading him or telling him what to say. This is the Democrat candidate for the Presidency! They‚Äôre all looney!
Police protecting human life is not Biden‚Äôs focusAnd if Biden somehow wins in November, EVERYTHING will magically open back up just fine in January.  And they'll probably give him a Nobel Peace Prize.
Kanye West indicates he is running for president to siphon votes from Joe Biden | Fox News
I wish you were the Democratic nominee. I cannot in good conscious vote for Trump or Biden. This may be the first year I won‚Äôt vote. I don‚Äôt feel I have a good choice from either party.
Yes Dan, unlike your Satan Worshipping Messiah, Biden is still very much Moderate. The problem with the GOP is, you‚Äôve traded in your allegiance to Lincoln, in exchange for an Ouija Board for your Faith. Look at Falwell as an example. Good pic with his pants unzipped, wasn‚Äôt it?
Don't worry you've sicked Kanye on them. Joe will certainly never get a single black vote now right????  After all, you've done more for black people than anyone, right? and Joe Biden isn't Catholic, right? And Covid has disappeared, right? And the new health care plan is out?
Biden clearly thinks blacks can‚Äôt make that decision. ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù And ‚ÄúBlacks aren‚Äôt diverse.‚Äù Meanwhile President Trump has made black lives better with lowest black unemployment, criminal reform and freedom and opportunity for ALL races. #Trump2020Landslide
It‚Äôs not an imaginary scenario. It‚Äôs an educated assumption. If you‚Äôre not willing to admit this is how most Biden endorsers operate, than you‚Äôre just as unable to admit when you‚Äôre wrong as trump is. Have a great day
Yes, but if this was trump you would be throwing a fit. How are y‚Äôall not noticing how much Biden exposes your hypocrisyüò≠
Biden can choose my oldest most battered garden gnome and it will possess more drive and intellectual agility than Trump's entire cabinet. And he'll have my vote regardless.
Very old crime bill. Yes it only addresses federal prisons but it is much more progressive then the 1994 crime bill and what Biden is currently offering. We must do way better then his current plan to address our policing issues in this county ‚úäüíØ
Fascinating article, Hunter. I came across this one today, too. I feel that from a political science POV, a center-right conception of a Christian Democratic party has no hope of breaking through. That politics is too close to what Joe Biden already is.
Have fun trying spreading your virus. Trump has and will continue to win. Haven't seen 1 Biden sign and just watched a Trump bost parade.
I work as a nurse with the disabled population. Our dsp workers are angels on earth. #whyillvote biden
The post was about Obama and Biden being silent on TBE murders happening in Chicago. Which they have been . please feel green to link where Obama or uniden have commented.
This was just a segment on MTP daily. Some Republicans in Ohio telling Biden who he has to pick for him to win his vote. I started laughing.  People who will vote for Trump anyway.
So the guy who cheated on 3 wives, hundreds of times, holds a Bible upside down because he‚Äôs never opened one, and commits extortion and Launders Money more often than normal people drink water, is telling us that Biden is Godless? Enjoy Hell Donnie.
Sorry but any vote not used or not used for Joe Biden is a Trump vote. So you have to ask yourself, is any one VP pick WORSE than 150k+ dead Americans?  I'd be interested in your response.
This man just claimed Joe Biden isn't a Christian. How long do you think God will stand for that without having something to say in it?
Democrats think if they keep repeating all of this it‚Äôs going to change someone‚Äôs mind to vote for Joe Biden? Everyone knows the virus is China‚Äôs fault. We know the President Trump acted quickly and he was criticized by the Dems. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #WuhanCoronavirus
The liberal aid that writes Biden‚Äôs tweets knows that without massive voting fraud, there is NO way he‚Äôs beating
Its time MAGA's. Your President just called Joe Biden "a hurter of the Bible and a man who hates God". You claim to be Christians. What do you do next?  I know what the Bible says you must do.  Do you?  I hope so!!! Your eternity depends on it!!!  Choose wisely.
Keep on judging people like you are, calling Joe Biden godless, and God will want to speak with you really quickly. I know you are unfamiliar with the Bible, but judging is God's to do, not yours. God will not be mocked.  Keep it up at your eternitys risk. Money is useless to God
He keeps playing around like this and God will talk with him immediately.  He will not like the outcome, guaranteed. Jesus makes it clear we are not to judge others. Here is the President calling Joe Biden "against God" Every true Christian RIGHT NOW must walk away from Trump.
Biden has no fucking clue what he is saying man. Just pure nonsense
"..Unlike the African American community ... the Latino community is an incredibly diverse.." so the African American community is not diverse. Does that make it easier to understand what Biden was saying?
Biden can‚Äôt stand you!
I‚Äôm ready to hear  as she gives the keynote address at our  volunteer leadership conference, Gun Sense University this Sunday!   Sign up to get an email reminder to watch with me:  #GSU2020 #TeamJoe
So, it ‚Äúprobably‚Äù exists. üòÇ Here‚Äôs some of the video we know exists:   Here‚Äôs what we also know: his conversion on this issue has been very late and politically expedient. But that‚Äôs Joe‚Äôs MO.
Yeah, you‚Äôre setting up a nice little false choice and strawman there. I never said ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù. I believe in international solidarity with freedom &amp; democracy movements worldwide. Unlike Joe Biden, I don‚Äôt believe in perpetual warfare, nor in business as usual at the Pentagon.
Wait you must have read wrong . I‚Äôm voting for Biden not trump #pedophiletrump
BS. The only way that stuttering, dementia stricken Biden wins is if there is nationwide ballot fraud. He is no match for President Trump. Bring on the debates!
Now do Biden.. #cuck
Trump vs. Biden
He certainly convinces me to vote for Joe Biden more and more pretty much every time he opens his mouth. I hope he never shuts up until 11/03/2020 and then he can just magically go away forever.
Sir, would you please consider giving a speech at the same exact time as the Republican National Convention? Make it a pay per view and the money can go to any charity of your choosing. You would make so many of us who support Joe Biden so happy in these hard times.
Definitely no video of the author of the crime bill Joe Biden saying anything like this contemporaneously:
If bet you think Joe Biden is a progressive, though. üòÇ
I‚Äôd rather have Biden than David Bell.......
These are biden voters. Vote green
The more he flaps his gums about ignorant crap, the less Joe Biden ever has to say. This is the best kinds of opponent - the kind whose cannot shut up and beats themselves. This narcissist will NEVER shut up, and thank goodness for that. #Biden2020Landslide
Keep talking! I love to see Biden's leads increase with every ignorant word you utter.  "Yo! Semite!! Keep up the chatter!"
Is he still talking? Isn't it time for his "trout fishing" trip?  Oh well as long as he and Trump and McConnell keep saying idiotic things daily, Biden never even has to hold a rally. They are winning for him.
They threw their full support behind Trump.  Tells you all you need to know.  Biden will have to rebuild them from the ground up.
Biden.. if I have to walk through glass
Kayleigh‚Äôs right. No one could have handled the virus the way Trump has...That‚Äôs why Biden is going to win.
I want to see Biden stand up to Trump in a way Hillary did not, as well as make it obvious just how stupid Trump really is.
Biden could go on vacation until 11/03 as long as DOnald Trump keeps talking. He is the "bigliest" support of Biden there is. Idiot Trump said today that he;s done more for Black People than anyone but Lincoln!!! Why would you ever debate a lunatic like that??
Why bother to to hold rallys or debates when your opponent tanks himself daily just by trying to do an interview. Have you seen those poll numbers? They get better for Biden daily and he never even has to speak. That's "bigly" amazing. Covfefee indeed!!
This should be part of Biden ads....he isn't doing any "Art of the Deal" so he is useless.
I'll take that bet and risk my eternity on it.  Let's see whose right. I'm a Christian Pastor and Joe Biden is getting my vote. Since you just judged millions of people, I wish you well in trying to explain that away to God when you see Him face to face. Thoughts and prayers.
Is Biden prepping the Junior Soprano defense?
Biden is going to be exhausted rescinding all of these Trump Executive Orders!
Just think.... every name known to have been on the flight log to Epstein‚Äôs pedo/rape island will be voting for Joe Biden. #DemocratsHateAmerica #Reprobates
He's at 7.7k, let's get that number up! Check out Joe Biden (
But it's Biden's mental acuity that must be questioned.
I will stick by my stance that Biden should not do debates. Trump is unstable, thats already been proven, so whats to gain? The media wants them to make both men look bad - thats their job. Trump makes himself look idiotic every day. Joe should sit them out. Just my opinion.
Just a reminder - The Police Union Head put the unions FULL BACKING behind Donald Trump.  This will be "just another day" for them going forward until Biden takes over.
We are still working for a revolution. Biden is no better than trump, not one of these 10 doesnt apply to both of them
More than half fit biden.. all do
Aaaand they all also fit for biden. Welp still voting green
Amen. Thank you for your reminder to those flipping out. Every minute Biden waits to announce is another minute Trump and the a Republicans cannot attack whomever he picks.
Because he knows he cannot beat Biden outright. McConnell sent up the warning flares over the weekend for Republicans to begin slowly pulling away, but that's too late as well. The USS Trumptanic is sinking.  They will be a horrific memory come 11/03/2020.
You saw no Biden supporters at a Trump rally. I wonder why genius.
Ill vote. Neither biden nor trump is worth my vote though.
Joe Biden is #unfit to be President. He didn‚Äôt write this tweet.
"..You realize that significantly more Trump voters than Biden voters are uneducated, right?.." you're not serious are you?
Biden is equally as bad. Fascism isnt just trump, its the US. And its the US that both trump and biden are fighting for. Ill fight against them both.
Trump is in no shape to stalk behind Biden like he did Hillary.  He would fall over.  Plus when he gets pissed he cannot just walk off like he does his pressers. It will be a total disaster for Trump - and I can;t wait to watch!!!
I think its cute that his ego is telling him that he's running against Obama and not Biden.  Those trips to Walter Reed will ratchet up soon me thinks.
Oh yes he does. And it has been a sheer joy watching him squirm and realize his time is running out. He says he plans on blocking everything when Biden wins, but he will no longer be in the majority so he will get to lay in the bed he shit in for all these years.
The first things you should do Mr.Biden, is to reverse citizens united, pass the voting rights act, and make sure churches start paying taxes. I am sure there are more great ideas out there but those are my top three...oh and prosecution of the current administration.
Wonder who‚Äôs going to give Biden the questions before hand?
Attacking Obama and not Biden - the man he‚Äôs running against - because he‚Äôs a racist and white supremicist
And Biden leads by 5 full points in Florida and trending to gain more.  But polls dont win elections, votes do!! Please send in mail votes as quickly as you can and prepare for huge lines on election day.
Folks Biden has proven 50yrs can't give Biden a positive record.  He proves he will say whatever things that will get him reelected.
#TrumpIsLosing I just came to say... #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica #Biden #ImVoting4BidenBecause  is better than Donald.
Because followers of narcissists do what their master does and that is "project". They know they are followers so thats what they call others. Don;t Trump calls Joe Biden "Sleepy" because thats all he does. When they call you something they are telling you that is what they are.
...you don‚Äôt wanna vote trump or republican because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all racist‚Äù. Even though he‚Äôs done more for the African American citizens than Obama did in 8 years and Biden did in   40 years. Democrats only care about black lives because it helps them in the long run...
Yea, it‚Äôs unfortunate the  should have learned from President Obama winning - he ran a positive message and garnered a ton of excitement. Hillary ran on fear and lost. Now Biden will, too.
I would vote for Biden/Bass.
It's the other way around. Trump would never have debated biden if trump were winning in the polls. Any debate they have now, Biden will have so many lies to call out it will be awesome.
We need ppl like you and biden in lines for the guillotines
By the way. Never said im not voting, just that both trump and biden are not getting mine.
He has to act right now. Time is running out to work up a plan and all the media that goes with it. Russia has nothing on Biden or else they would have presented it. If they do present something from USSR then Nunes is in deep shit for not saying so when he was asked. Catch 22.
I‚Äôm not voting for Trump. I‚Äôm not voting for Biden. Neither of them have earned my vote.  I won‚Äôt vote shame anyone. Vote as your conscience dictates.  Then let‚Äôs build the mallet that will bust this duopoly open like a pi√±ata.
We will relive this moment again on 11/03/2020 when Joe Biden embarrasses Trump. America will once again be the land of the free and not the land of narcissistic synophancy.
I‚Äôd make the point that they don‚Äôt know if Trump or Biden will win, so they hedge their bets, throw money at both parties, and know that no matter who wins, ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù for rich people, as Biden said.
Just understand that most Americans don't want the police defunded, and the democrats, in many cities, sponsor that. That's a guarantee of 4 more years of   Also, the videos of Biden touching kids will turn many voters off.

We need to remember that the Head of the Police Union threw their full backing behind Trump. This is because they know that Biden is going to totally reform policing as we know it and they do not want it to change.
He's lost Florida with the help of DeathSantis.  This is huge for Biden.  If the Texas numbers keep getting worse for him, we will be able to call the election very quickly on 11/03/2020.  #Biden2020Landslide
What is the prob with KH? Biden needs a relentkess attack dog, though Rice better qualified to take over in energency
Imagine being a white liberal woman who wants folks to vote Biden so badly that she thinks no black people could possibly be anti-Biden leftists.  Have you not studied American history, Becca? Or American current events?
Also they just said he was pulling his ad buying to change their message.  "Sleepy Joe" has been his lame message since the start. He has been afraid of Biden or else he would never have asked for help beating Joe. #TrumpHasLost
Hmmm...your losing in Texas and Florida as well. Sleepy Joe is very a old and tired cliche. You need something with more relevance.  Something like "Joe Biden would never tear gas your Mom like I will" That shows Americans your toughness.
Yes and he must walk through a two columns of people - Black Lives Matter Protesters on the left and Moms and Veterans whom he gassed on the right - on his way to the police van. Biden and Obama get to shut the doors on the vehicle - and America returns to her greatness.
You WILL know like 4 hours after the polls open. Biden with 85% of the electoral college locked up. That leaves no way to protest the results. Have no fear, the Blue Wave is poised to roll tide on November 3rd, voter suppression or no, it wont matter.
The newspapers in the state that he Governs has to beg him for help - and he loves and cherishes every second of that because to him, that makes him powerful.  He's nothing but a spineless, sycophant, small-minded Trump follower who, once Biden takes office will not last long.
I‚Äôve never considered voting for Joe Biden because he‚Äôs never considered Medicare for All, not even in the midst of a pandemic and not even when nearly 90 percent of Dem voters want it.
I have a daughter named Jayme. I‚Äôve thought about you constantly since the shooting because of this. Joe Biden has personal experience with the kind of pain you‚Äôve suffered.I love my kids with all my heart.I can‚Äôt begin to understand because I‚Äôve never lost one. I‚Äôm with Joe, too
I‚Äôd be happy with any of the ladies but I‚Äôm putting my money on Rep. Val Demmings, she checks all the boxes and has the kind of gravitas to balance Biden out.
Biden won‚Äôt be writing them. Just like he doesn‚Äôt write them now. #DementiaJoe
Would I be able to make a sign and put it on my yard? Side of barn? On my truck? How about if I have a delivery truck, can I put political ads on it and pay someone to drive around? Can I buy a TV ad for Biden or Hale? I‚Äôd put ‚Äúpaid for by Rob‚Äù at the end üôÇ
Biden didn‚Äôt write this. It‚Äôs sick what the left is doing to this dementia stricken and confused man. #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin
Well. Biden is losing it. Doesn‚Äôt even know where he is half the time. And obviously I don‚Äôt have to explain Trump
My history of Presidential voting:   2000:George Bush 2004:George Bush 2008:Ron Paul 2012:Gary Johnson 2016:Gary Johnson 20220: Joe Biden   Weird evolution that probably isn't that uncommon.
Seems like today would be a good day for future president Biden to announce his VP. Take back the narrative and assure us all Nov. 3rd the trump nightmare is over.#NobodyLikesTrump
There you have it, folks! He tried extortion, suppression, and every other ‚ÄúShell Game Parlor Trick to rig this election. Now he‚Äôs flat out saying, STOP the election, because I can‚Äôt beat Biden 1 on 1.
By "looking pretty good" she means that its pretty clear Joe Biden is going to walk all over Trump on 11/03/.2020 without any delays in the election. She and her siccophant, mindless, spineless followers all become irrelevant on 11/03/2020 and not a day later!  Buh-bye Laura!!!
Lowkey super fucked up that a president wants to delay being voted out. I think biden will win bc all my conservative family members seem to be on board but to me hes just as bad, we truly need revolution
Joe Biden's job will be easy. Just do the absolute opposite of whatever Trump did. We will have national allies again, we will beat this virus together, we will began to have equality for all, corporations will finally pay their share, and we can all sleep again. #Biden2020
This one is easy. He is no longer president. Biden is and Biden then assumes military control just as Trump has. So Biden, smiling all the way, simply orders the military to throw him out. Any officer not following that order is guilty of treason. Period. This is a non-issue
If you want to defeat Trumpism, not just the man, then Joe Biden ain‚Äôt your guy.  Joe Biden said ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù if he‚Äôs elected.  He‚Äôll set the conditions for Trumpism to come back with a vengeance in 2022 and 2024.  We don‚Äôt have time for this.
On top of ensuring Texas forgives all taxes for Elon Musk to build his new plants in Texas. Yet, he's STILL behind in polls in Texas according to CNN and Reuters. And Biden and Lincoln Projects ads start hitting there soon. #Biden2020
What are the odds that lady is voting Joe Biden?
Yes Donnie, keep it up. The more you push, the lower your polling numbers go. Americans love your plan and will show up in droves to vote - for Joe Biden.How‚Äôs your elite friends doing? We all know you and Biden got a dinner date to discuss the next plan and scheme. Just tell the people your all a hoax, people are catching on it‚Äôs all a shit show and reality tv condensation. Give us our government back it‚Äôs obvious both sides

It has been different.  I can imagine how hard it must be for Trump to draw a contrast between himself and someone who rarely comes out of his house.  I understand why they don‚Äôt want Biden to come out but it definitely makes it hard to compare and contrast.
STARTING TODAY : FACEBOOK AND TWITTER HAVE REMOVED ALL THE PRESIDENTIAL ADS UNTIL NOV 1 , 2020 ! ISN'T THAT A COINCIDENCE ! NOT BIDEN !

Biden has already stated it would be a woman and I just don‚Äôt want to hear the woman bashing start. I would love to see Harris but I will vote democrat no matter what.
There is no upside to Biden debating trump. He will puke out lies and conspiracy theories for the faithful.
Anyone who believes that Joe Biden can lead this country is a enemy of all Americans. No one wins if Joe does! I promise you that!

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has an 11-point lead over Republican President Donald Trump in Michigan, a new poll found.

Using my simulation, which doesn't assume the poll results are the most likely vote result in states, but simply indicating a trend, my most likely result shows to be  Biden 320 Trump 218

I'd be a little more worked up about the lack of a Trump/Biden debate if the presidential "debates" didn't consist entirely of shit any fool could Google during a commercial break.
If Biden or his son committed crimes they should be charged.  If Trump or his family committed crimes they should be charged too.  We need new leadership. PERIOD. I think they're all corrupt and self-dealing. Why are all politicans rich? Think about it...
I don't want Biden either.. But  has lost his mind. We need a new president, sorry.
Even for a president known for his blunt criticism, Trump's remarks stood out and they signaled how contentious the campaign may get over the coming months.
Thirdly, you put this into context of things Biden has said about Black people loving him and supporting him as if he has our support and vote locked down and it is disturbing.  Are we a monolith to him? Does he take our vote for granted in the same way as he does our diversity?
Biden every time he talks
Biden every time he talks
Let's start by the fact that it was wrong and, at best in very poor taste, for Biden to think it was necessary to bring Black people or the AA community up at all as a comparison point for diversity?  Like why? What is the damn purpose of that?
President Trump at the podium: On my map, and you know there is no one who has a better map than me. It shows me that Bangcock is the capital of Thighland. This was on the cognitive test I passed, very easy test. Joe Biden couldn't pass it. Me: I bet he can pronounce Thailand!
Did the both of you come here to defend Biden's comment (which  I made no reference to in my tweet)?

And I would also credit Biden with being receptive to those arguments because of his desire to welcome other wings of the party. But again I come back to the difference between political pressure and divisive rancor. One is constructive, the other is not.
How about that new racist Biden interview
"You ain't black." "Are you a junkie?" Black Americans have no diversity of thought.  All Joe Biden statements in past 3 months that would have been labeled horrendously racist if Trump said them.
Let's not forget Biden looking at a black journalist and asking if he was a junkie this week for asking a legitimate question.
Joe Biden out for a leisurely drive...
Yes, it is real.   "Biden made the remark during an interview hosted by the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and the National Association of Black Journalists."  - Politico

Ah yes, I can see it now, the heavens trembling when Joe Biden is elected in November. Because ‚Äúformidable‚Äù has to be the first word I would use to describe 77 year old Joe Biden...
Whether you want Trump for president or not, Biden's statement is unquestionably racist and should disqualify him from the presidency.
Joe Biden wins.
Buuuuuut the black community basically handed the primary to Biden in SC, so...
That's not really what I'm talking about but I understand what you're saying too. I don't think anyone has treated Biden with kid gloves. Pressure is totally fine and part of the process. Division is the concern three months out.

Biden serious about picking Susan Rice? Given that her son is a high key Trump supporter?
How do you intend to win Joe? Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee for the Democratic National Convention
These questions seem based on the notion that somehow Trump will perform well at the debates. He won't. He was terrible in the debates against Hillary. At worst, the debates will be a wash for Biden and won't affect the horserace.
Go right ahead. Biden will bury you in five minutes.
OBE WAN JOE BiDEN, IS OUR ONLY HOPE.......BEAUTIFUL.
That will end badly for Biden
So.... absolutely NO concession made here by Biden for progressives. He‚Äôs just going to plow ahead with either a cop or a war hawk.

So... You said that 4 years ago... And.. Not so Great.  I'm not voting for you and I'm not voting for Biden. Good Luck!

How about early on, the way Biden says ‚ÄúCome on maaaan.....‚Äù Guy can‚Äôt get out of his own way.
And THAT'S why Trump will win again. Because it's about him even when nobody was talking about him. Joe was saying they're hiding Biden (correct) and he's in a significant mental decline (also correct) and instead of arguing that point the response is what about Trump
So far all the folks dreading Biden and/or his pick for VP, who are voting for?
Meaning, you can't possibly win without Florida, and Joe Biden is still leading you there by several points.

Note that this was also in this same op-ed: ‚ÄúBiden accused the president of trying to make it harder for people to vote by mail by defunding or otherwise hindering the Postal Service‚Äôs operations. There‚Äôs absolutely no proof Trump wants to do that, but that didn‚Äôt stop Biden.‚Äù

You always have to question conflict of interest investigations in the Congress because they investigate themselves. That is both parties so if you believe I am skeptical you are right. With Biden, CIA wants nothing to do with it.

You are batshit crazy. No one cares what you think I will NOT support Biden or who ever he picks for VP. I will call out the double standard and hypocrisy of the left every opportunity I have. This election is about keeping this country free vs the socialist left.
The only thing that would concern me about Biden's VP choice is if he decided to go back 200 years and make the runner up in the general election his VP.

Difference between those who plan to vote in person (Trump 65-32) and those who plan to vote by mail (Biden 76-20) is shockingly huge.  This is why Trump keeps attacking mail in voting. If he gets his way on it, he wins. He's antidemocratic and corrupt as hell, but we knew that.

It's not like Joe Biden is saying to scrap the presidential debates. He said numerous times he has no problem with it. This is an opinion, but someone at a newspaper. Neither candidate. This is just trying to make something out of nothing and it's a little pathetic.
I find it unthinkable  anyone that views  Trumps accomplishments as. PRESIDENT, with true convictions vote for Biden after watching him grope young girls and women (right in front of cameras) also caught in quid pro quo on camera, and knowing his son is a crook, vote for him!!!

Anyone can go to  and see for yourself. Look at the stats by age. It's all about closing down the vote to force mail-in voting. They need Biden in office to protect the elite pedophiles from life in jail.
I haven't decided who I'm voting for yet, but that's been the best reason I've found to base a decision around the election. Biden is probably the single worst possible option to oppose Trump (except maybe Hillary), but a Biden White House might allow for a party realignment.

Ah... I pictured younger but that makes more sense for the scenario.  Pre-puberty, it‚Äôd be Trump. Post, 100% not Epstein. It‚Äôd be a harder decision. If 15-18 then Biden, if 12-14 Trump maybe
Like he would probably just do not a lot of anything because he‚Äôs a lazy arse. I‚Äôd expect he‚Äôd just sit their rambling about himself and conspiracies and would look crazy.  Biden, would certainly sniff their hair and touch them uncomfortably (not to say Trump wouldn‚Äôt tho)
How old is the child though?  Biden has been seen being weird with kids of all ages (so definitely not). Epstein and Trump target(ed) teenagers. I for some reason feel like generally speaking Trump would less likely say/do something sexual than the rest.
Yes, ignoring the polls is step one in electing Biden! Polls do not account for voter suppression, voter intimidation, foreign interference, and a multitude of other illegal schemes Trump and his enablers will employ! Step two is VOTE!!
Can you expand on how Biden is a Marxist?
You are so scared. Biden is going to win and no matter how many hate tweets you write your done. Americans see right threw you a liar and racist.
Yeah, I get it. He's old, he has a stutter. He's less sharp than he was. However, unlike Trump, he will (a) work hard and (b) surround himself with experienced and qualified advisors. I'm OK with that. I wanted EZ. I'll happily vote Biden.
I could add that calling out Biden as senile is a Trump campaign strategy, amplified by PhotoShopped photos and creative editing. But, as you have demonstrated, it works on some people.
Yes. That's why I distanced myself from the statement, to point out that it should be taken with a grain of salt. It's a single data point, and one that's being filtered through someone else. I'm only pointing out that it's a sign that Biden winning isn't a given.
They did it with Hillary Clinton and now they‚Äôre doing it with Joe Biden they just figure that with Hollywood the deep state and the  Media 100% in their corner they can Duke the public it didn‚Äôt work in 2016 and it‚Äôs not going to work in 2020

I couldn‚Äôt agree with this more!  It is shocking to my senses how frequently Biden is throwing out his racist rhetoric, and mind numbing that NOBODY is calling him out on the spot for it!?!?  He would be drawn and quartered by dinner if it was President Trump!!
I know you think Joe Biden is the answer to all your problems he's going to help you sleep at night and make you feel so warm and fuzzy.
Joe Biden is racist. He‚Äôs always made extremely racist remarks the entire 50 years he‚Äôs been in office. When someone tells you who they are....believe them.
Don't be an idiot and fuck this up.  Biden is THE ONLY CHOICEüòÅ
So, Kanye is a trump supporter, who thinks he can siphon off "the" Black vote, because that would hurt Biden.
The trump campaign's faked ads against Biden are telling us something important: trump's polling had to have taken a hit when he hid in the bunker. Ads that hit his cowardice and his being ostracized on the world stage might be good fodder for future.
Stop being such a Bernie Bro! Biden and any of the top picks, even your least favorite, is still better than 4 more years of Tweedledum and Tweedlejesus. A write-in is a wasted vote and we need every vote we can get. Man up and vote the major ticket closest to your beliefs.
What this particular ad campaign tells us is that the bunker incident really hurt trump's poll numbers, so he's trying to "both sides" it with Biden.  Biden's campaign should hit back hard w/the bunker boy's cowardliness.
And you are surprised by that?  That's what each side does.. and if Biden can't take it.. I say  shit or get off the pot.
Crazy Biden does it again..I've never seen such racist remarks from a wanna be President..Trump 2020!!
According to Biden's own nuanced understanding of race, it wouldn't even have to be Harris for you to be proven correct--just someone from the Black community.
But y‚Äôall are mad at Biden while Kanye and the GOP are actually treating us as a monolith ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden will 'smote his ruin upon the mountainside'.
Imagine being so stupid you think Biden is controlled by communists instead of wallstreet, pharma, finance etc. Its a bewildering delusion frankly.
Noones a "Biden guy", but I get what ur sayin.
If Biden could really rid the nation of god/bible I‚Äôd volunteer for him.
I think God should weigh in on this one. Joe Biden- practicing Catholic. Trump - doesn't understand how to hold a Bible. But what do I know?
Um...how come no one's talking about this? I mean, I know why MSM isn't covering it but not everyone else. Am I nuts or did biden just hand this to trump?
But gee, Biden has dementia.  W.T.F.
Yes, full support for whoever he picks! No squabbling. If you disagree with the pick, shut up. It‚Äôs not your VP, it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs.
I was sympathetic towards West when I heard he has a mental illness.. but that ship has sailed.. knowing he is in cahoots w/ Trump to take Biden votes away..tired of the circus acts.. vote them all out in Nov..
They fucked up severely cos already the administration was looking for a scapegoat. Unless Biden wins and grants them pardon

You love to try and scare them when there is no way that will happen, Biden wouldn't as president have that authority. You cant scare people into voting for you, you have no depth,  no plan,  just fearmongering, pathetic.
Ms. Traister sees Joe Biden clearly. We have to vote for him but we sure as hell dont have to be happy about it
Biden is hopefully the last hurrah of the Democratic good old boys network. Chris Dodd and Ed Rendell should both be made to walk the plank.
Ya. I didn‚Äôt realize that trump had made another crazy statement involving Biden ‚Äúhurting god‚Äù so with that context my answer has to change. I thought it was a refreshing thought experiment...üôÅ oh well. Trump is his own god so it is easy to hurt him.
Biden, with our allies forced out a corrupt prosecutor that wasnt prosecuting corruption, the guy wasnt doing his job. He wasnt trying to get an investigation stopped, the buying wasnt doing anything.

I guess you don't think Trump is much of a threat then, do you?  Be on guard, America.  So many stupid, ignorant, tribal voters out there.  Biden has nothing locked up.
YES!  If we learned one thing from Obama‚Äôs relationship with Republicans, it‚Äôs that ‚Äúlook forward not backward‚Äù did not have the desired effect. 1/

I think we can walk and chew gum, but I don't think Biden has the stomach for it. Frankly not sure the nation as a whole does either. We might be so relieved when Trump is gone, that we will just want to heal. We'll see.
I read some of the transcript‚Äîpathetic.  It would be interesting to compare the difference in how Trump talks to Catholics and how Biden, who‚Äôs Catholic, talks with them.

Sigh. Yes, it's a good ad. And I don't want to undercut Biden's campaign. But still...climate policy that comes out of this mindset is not going to get us anywhere close to where we need to be. And we don't have any time to waste.
The White House has been in shambles since you arrived. Voting for Biden
Biden is intelligent and cares. Then there is Donnie. He does not care if our children die. Or bring the virus home to their parents and grandparents. Or we lose teachers who will also bring the virus home.

Who was president before Trump? It‚Äôs not that Trump and Obama are the same - it‚Äôs that one necessarily leads to the other. Voting for Obama is like planting the seed that grows into Trump. Voting for Biden is another seed planted.

Biden has shown zero interest in fixing the problems that created Trump in the first place. If you think settling for Biden without pressuring him to actually make some real changes is going to fix anything, well, get ready for eight years of Trump 2.0.
And then what? How is turning back the clock and doing all the same shit we did before going to make anything better? What happens when Biden's "lol we're just gonna make it like 2012 again" strategy leads to a repeat of 2016, except this time with a competent fascist?

Which is one of so many reasons why I am working hard for a Biden victory!
You know what a violation of the norms? Everything this year. Biden isn‚Äôt even traveling to the convention to accept his nomination. He‚Äôs hiding in his basement as per the usual.
‚Å¶  ‚Å¶ ‚Å¶ scraps plans to travel to Milwaukee for nomination acceptance, citing coronavirus concerns, is this his out for DEBATES too ?
Trust me when I say, we can all imagine Trump saying crazy racists shit to anyone.  Today I understand fully why a Trumper would vote for Don no matter what he says. It literally doesn't matter what Biden says, he has my support. WHY? Because Trump is a danger to humanity.
"Come on, man. That's like saying you, before you got on this program, you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not. What do you think? Huh? Are you a junkie?" Biden said, becoming testy with the reporter, CBS's Errol Barnett, who asked whether he had taken a cognitive test
Agreed. Biden obviously has buttons that when pushed create a strong response, not always reasonable... See Biden‚Äôs recent interview (‚Äúare you a junkie?‚Äù). For those wanting a debate: be careful what you wish for!

Part of me jut feels like Biden‚Äôs going to just chppse the unexpected with Rice because why not.  She‚Äôs less problematic than Kamala to many voters, but she also will not bring out as many voters as Kamala and doesn‚Äôt really seek like the 2024 presidnetial candidate type.

Biden has a diagnosed stutter that he‚Äôs had since childhood. It‚Äôs somehow ok to make fun of someone‚Äôs differing abilities?  If this is acceptable, then what‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs excuse for always stammering, bungling and mispronouncing words and saying embarrassing things?ü§î
Vote for Biden!
Agreed
I don't care. I'm voting for Joe Biden.
Well, a good place to start would be not having Putin be able to blackmail our President. So I guess Biden kind of wins right there. Last I checked, our President doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdebate‚Äù foreign leaders. In the old days we negotiated and worked with them. Before this America first BS.
Rasmussen 7/29: Biden 48%. Trump42% of likely voters. You have heard of Google. The truth is out there for anyone who wants to know it. I dare you to fact check.

If elected Biden would be the second coming of the end of Wilson‚Äôs second term.seems like it is difficult to comprehend. But I also have a hard time understanding why we should get behind Biden. On the basis because we don't like the other candidate? Maybe a debate to hear about these platforms might help people like myself who are confused
#presidentDonaldTrump we don't hear from Butthead Biden these days because he has a really good campaign manager,who has taught him that less is more..#MrPresident seriously relax sir your win is in the bag the only one who can lose the presidency for you is you,&amp; so less is more

Why does China and Iran want Biden to win....in my travels, I found China to be more of a threat to the United States than Russia.
If you‚Äôre forcing me to choose one, yeah I guess Biden is less of a monster. The fact remains that neither is presidential material IMO. I don‚Äôt know how an educated person can watch that Biden car video without cringing.

I truly believe the democrats have plans to cheat with the mail in voting and that is why they are raising the issue of Trump not leaving the white house. They are right in one way he shouldn't leave unless it can be proven Biden won 100%. No cheating.

Any negative thoughts you have about Biden, you have to double it when talk about Trump. Trump is also a Traitor.
Barr isn't going to stop his investigation just because it involved Biden's dumb VP pick. If that causes Team Biden consternation they should pick a different person to be a heartbeat away from the Presidency
Gotta say, I had no idea his beliefs, political and otherwise, were so . . . odd?
Ms. Cupp, I watched your video today stating how opposed you are to Trump, but then also stated Biden's choice for VP would determine whether or not you voted for him. You are aware that a write-in vote helpsTrump, right? You need to vote Biden if you want Trump out. That simple.
To shield Biden you need more than a CNN host....hilarious
U.S. intelligence has assessed that China is hoping President Donald Trump does not win reelection, Russia is working to denigrate Democrat Joe Biden and Iran is seeking to undermine democratic institutions.

Sounds a lot more like something he would now not Biden
As opposed to my fellow Republicans who think if they get a black rapper on the ballot, African-American voters will vote for him over a white Democrat and they'll help Trump!  At least Biden didn't call black voters stupid like those Trump-loving Republicans did.

You cannot sacrifice one group's vote to get another.  some African Americans will sit out the race if they feel they are not appreciated. And you would have missed your opportunity to be president for the 3rd time.
I'm on your side but you have to start watching your missed steps saying that latinos are more diverse than African Americans is not a smart thing to say Joe
This is hilarious. It‚Äôs amazing after Hillary was 2 win but instead went down like a $2 Hooker you morons think 4 a nanosecond The train wreck of the Biden campaign, who still hasn‚Äôt named a VP less than 3 months from the election, is going to even sniff winning the Presidency.

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden sought to limit the political damage after he said in an earlier interview that the Latino community in the United States was diverse, ‚Äúunlike the African American community with notable exceptions.‚Äù
Atleast Biden has the humility to correct his mistakes and own up. Meanwhile trump is just a kicking and screaming child.

Joanne, I really doubt you‚Äôve worked within the geriatrics space, because Biden clearly shows cognitive decline. I saw 15 years of affect Alzheimer‚Äôs had on my mother. By the end of 2021 Joe Biden will not know his own family. Your response is irresponsible.
Wow, you want to point at someone that is racist, Its Biden and hes given a pass because of the communist media. I say replace everyone in DC. They forgot decades ago that that work for us. Ever heard the term "We the people"
This is great news.  So when will #RealityWinner get her payment and released from prison?  Now, or after #Biden pardons and expunges her?
Joe Biden continues to show he thinks less of the black community then other democrat groups. Remember "poor kids are just as bright as white kids"?
FOR THE BIDEN - TRUMP DEBATE THERE SHOULD BE 100 QUESTIONS IN PACKETS OF 5 AND OPENED JUST BEFORE THEY ARE ASKED BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE THE QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME FOR BIDEN TO MEMORIZE IF WE DON"T DO THIS !!!!
"Team Obama".  Must admit I genuinely feel a little bit sorry for Joe Biden. Even his shills can barely maintain the pretense.
A good Christian still talks and speaks to people that they  can‚Äôt get a long with, since you want to falsely accuse President Biden of not being Christian. Talk to Nancy Speaker of the house.
Biden will take your guns away so he can arm a new branch of the military whose sole purpose is to "hurt God."
Cardi B Explains Why She Endorsed Joe Biden After Bernie Sanders
The reason Biden don‚Äôt have a VP. Yet is 2 reasons.    1- NOBODY WANTS THE        BE CONNECTED WITH        JOE.    2- POLITICAL SUICIDE
Trump just needs to run adds showing Biden interviews and he will win.
Most Democrats agree that Biden will only be an ‚Äúinterim‚Äù president. They know he won‚Äôt be re-elected.
Yo if Biden is strong enough to hurt god we gotta elect him. Possibilities are endless.
Glenn's back!  - Biden again reveals his belief that all black people think the same, says Latinos have "diversity" of thought - NY AG sues to dissolve NRA, accuses group's leaders of misusing millions on personal expenses - Over 20% of NYC mail-in primary votes were disqualified
I plan on voting for you, but please quit trying to lose by saying stupid things like Biden hates God right after he said something stupid. He is grateful to you for bailing him out.
Of course they are they put him on the ballot to take votes away from biden they admitted to it
Yet you guys ignore Biden‚Äôs mental struggles......
They wouldn‚Äôt require masks and the chapels would mostly be about conspiracies about how Biden is trying to abolish virginity or some shit
"After yesterday's edited version of his statement, Sleepy Joe Biden is no longer worthy of the Black Vote"
Ye getting weaponized as a GOP pawn to ticket split Biden is I guess where we‚Äôre at in 2020.
You mean Joe Biden right?
u must be incompetent.  Dems talking about children...yet not ONE word chastising them on their support for abortion.  Biden talks about african americans and cocaine....crickets???
Did you say the same about what Obama did at the funeral of Mr Lewis?  Nope.  You sure didn‚Äôt.   Speaking about Biden isn‚Äôt illegal, no matter what the event is.   Stop crying.
Which is exactly why you and the GOP want Kanye West in the presidential hunt. You think it will draw the black vote from Biden. You are hardly an inspiration for anyone but rubes vote.
These Aren't Just Gaffes,  Is An Old Democrat Codger Who Lives Only In His Own Mind.  He Is Sick With A Mental Illness &amp; Is Reverting Back To A Time &amp; Mindset Of Blacks On Democrat Plantations.  "C'mon Man" He Can NEVER Be   #FoxNews
üëâ'Biden apology for lumping all black people together is precisely why he‚Äôs been hiding during the 2020 campaign
It‚Äôs laughable that  or  run Biden ads on   Of course they‚Äôll take your money but NO US-respecting patriot would EVER vote for Biden. Period.  We know the TRUTH about what‚Äôs going on. China brought the virus here during the best economy ever
Yes!  Great for Biden!
‚ÄúTake away your guns, take away your Second Amendment. No religion, no anything,‚Äù Trump said of Biden on Thursday. ‚ÄúHurt the Bible. Hurt God. He‚Äôs against God. He‚Äôs against guns.‚Äù  This equating of God with guns is symptomatic of one the biggest problem with the American church.
Biden is not my top pick either, but I will be voting for him.
Joe Biden's response on faith is not only a great example of how Christianity should actually manifest in politics, but it wins extra points for me that he published it on Medium.
A year ago, biden had a lot of trouble even calling someone at a campaign call center, he didn't even know to press send, so yes, there is no doubt that he couldn't write a tweet, he couldn't even use the keyboard.
They are probably hoping to get additional votes by doing so. The problem is, racist Biden and his bunch of radicals are the ones that put them there.
Is Mr. Biden godly? Is the Dem party godly or godless?
Joe Biden is really out here trying to compete with George Washington for lowest total black vote
Joe Biden isn't a decent person he literally defended segregation and ran as a senator on a platform to block desegregation efforts. People forget this but he became a senator promising white Delaware Democrats he'd stop integration efforts
Why is the  silent on the nightly violent Portland riots &amp; not asking why Biden is still hiding in his basement when the election in ONLY 3 months awayüßêüßê.  Oh..that is because all they can do is spread fear about COVID-19!! #nbcisbiased  #FakeNewsMedia
No hoopla: Virus upends Biden, Trump convention plans
It was a comparison the cocaine, Junkie reference.  People, the man is 77 years old! He isn't the Joe Biden of old.  He should have retired, honestly.  Even if it were 2016, he was sharper.  But I would rather have a stuttering Biden than the obvious racist we have now.
I was looking online for  coverage of Biden‚Äôs controversial comments from yesterday. I can‚Äôt find the story but I am sure it is there. Can you please tweet the link ?  had interesting commentary on the clean up from Joe‚Äôs campaign.
Every time Repubes post about ‚Äúthat Biden video was *hard to watch*‚Äù I wonder to myself if they think it‚Äôs hard to watch the President ignore Russian bounties, or rail on about water pressure, or say Biden will ‚Äúhurt the Bible, hurt God‚Äù? You think this shit is *easy to watch*?
You've just passed off the only two Evangelicals I know.  They were both surprised you thought God was so weak that Biden can hurt him.  Moron, they said God is all powerful.
If he takes one vote from Biden, it helps Trump though and Donny knows it.
Is this Biden‚Äôs address
No, that's fair. A lot of folks don't know this, but Obama gifted Biden with the ancient god-killing blade "Deokinaka" back in 2012. He used it to behead Mammon's chosen, Congressman Ryan, in the vice presidential debate.  I'd look out if I was god.
This is what constitutes a "clarification" now?  THIS?!?!
Biden also asked a black reporter if he was a junkie. Any "R" would be vilified and it'd be in your face 24/7... I don't think it matters what color the reporter is, but I didn't create these rules, the left did. Why don't we play by them for everyone?
If  or any other person with an R after their name insinuated that black people can't think as individuals and all think the same, they'd be called racist, Nazi, bigot, Klan etc. Biden will get a pass and after small blurbs like this, you'll never see it again.
At least Biden serves up his racism with a smile.
Between this, ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù, and literally all of his history in government, it‚Äôs hard to deny that Biden isn‚Äôt at least a little racist.
It‚Äôs so obvious why Joe Biden isn‚Äôt ever going to debate President Trump!
Biden, never the brightest bulb in the room, is clearly unqualified for the job. The Dems aided by the dishonest media are making a mockery of our democracy &amp; election process, they assume the  voters are too stupid to see their malicious con. #SaveLibertyVoteRed #Trump2020
Never trump? Then you're voting for Biden even if you hate trump if you vote Biden you might as well kiss America land of the free good bye and say welcome china
"What you all know but most people don't know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things."  #Daybreak8
Same old  one thing is for sure in life, history repeats itself and Joe Biden is a racist and creepy hands on children sniffer.

Yeah... lowering the age for Medicare to 60 and strengthening private insurance via ACA is totally halfway to single payer M4A...   Giving the police $300 million is totally halfway to defunding them...  What about Biden's policies makes you think he's met us "halfway?"
Joe Biden wants more ISLAM taught in schools...nice try!
think the Clintons can pull off a 'Vince Foster' on Yeezy? asking for a friend
Last I heard the Alpha &amp; the Omega was a little omniscient and omnipowerful. I don‚Äôt think Biden will pose much of a threat. SMDH - this spoiled orange is mush.
What do you think the headline would be, if he were standing in the street holding a knife covered in blood with a dead body laying next to his feet? "BIDEN WINS FIGHT WITH CORN POP" He was a lying dog faced pony soldier. So that's A OK remember folks Biden 2020  Dial 33300077733
at some point here soon the trump campaign is gonna realize all they have to do is not say anything and just wait to react to biden's constant stream of weird bigotry and the dems are gonna be embarrassed even harder than they were last time
No competent ‚Äúconservative‚Äù needs an excuse to not vote for Biden.  You are a sad little man that was never a conservative.  Nice try though.  Not really.
i miss when joe biden was just the old guy saying shit like "look here jack piss you two bit pony fucking heel-toe scallywoggle" and nobody gave a shit about him
This was a just sad.
Not for Joe Biden.
Don‚Äôt worry, ole Joe Biden has a plan to make sure it‚Äôs only going to cost $2,000 for Americans!
I Disagree. He Will Take Black Votes Away From Biden , Big Time. Who Has The Most Black Voters Now. A Lot More Voters To Take Away From Biden .
A majority of Americans, including  Democrats &amp; REPUBLICANS, want a single payer healthcare system, like "Medicare for All". Joe Biden &amp; the Establishment Democrats in Congress need to support it as well.

Joe Biden struggles to complete sentence about his mental fitness - YouTube
He tried so hard "All the things you Ohio rednecks love GUNS and GOD... right? You love those things. Well Biden will hurt them. He weirdly has the power to make God feel pain. And your guns. They'll be in pain. If you vote for Biden..."
Ok this is the second tweet about mating in private, is this part of research for a bigger story, have you found video of Harry leg Biden swinging from that chain he was going use on corn pop, in the nude on the Lolita express?
All those political maps that show Biden with over 300 electoral votes?...Ignore them until after the debates.  At least until then.  We are too far out to be running victory laps.
Unbelievable that no mainstream pundit is considering this possibility for Biden's VP pick.
It has been different.  I can imagine how hard it must be for Trump to draw a contrast between himself and someone who rarely comes out of his house.  I understand why they don‚Äôt want Biden to come out but it definitely makes it hard to compare and contrast.
Because you were the one meant to make it? Please make it a conspiracy account about how Biden died and got replaced by a fortnite hologram, pretty please
Lol nuance is quoting Biden
CNN MSN Trump apologists
Weirdly enough for me, I‚Äôve gotten genuinely excited for a Biden presidency recently. He‚Äôs not my ideal candidate but as he‚Äôs developed his climate activism program I‚Äôm sincerely here for it.   Not my socialist daydream, but a realistic turn towards the future.
Joe Biden is a puppet. Let the man grieve over the loss of his family. He has yet to do that! He does not have the mental capacity to run a country. Let‚Äôs keep the current president he‚Äôs doing a fine job!
I am sick that trump uses religion as a propaganda point.  He has demonstrated over his lifetime that religion is not something he values. To come after Biden, who is a devout Catholic, is reprehensible. His rhetoric is sacrilegious.
Everyone is better than Blacks to Joe Biden!
There is no comparison between the decency of Joe Biden and grotesqueness of Donald Trump. Biden‚Äôs life has been marked by overcoming personal adversity in service to others while Trump is devoid of empathy and all he has done has been in service to self.
Yep. Unfortunately that part of the political process is over for 4 more years. The best we can hope for is someone like Harris for VP and Biden for Pres. And I'll vote with a smile.
Really? If Biden doesn‚Äôt pick who you support- you‚Äôre cool with 4 more years of Trump? What conservative values does Trump promote or demonstrate? What a joke
But that isn't what is happening here? Biden can recall short term details, too?
‚Äú...let‚Äôs put our differences aside and work together on one common goal ‚Äî removing Donald Trump from the White House and electing Joe Biden, a man who will restore dignity, honor and decency to the office of President of the United States.‚Äù
Biden essentially said "all blacks are the same." Yet you will stand up for that?  Ill call Trump an idiot when he says something dumb. No problem.   Biden is somewhere on the scale between problematic and racist but liberals will never admit it.
I want to see Joe Biden debate Trump and I want to see him and angry but calm. Drag him with squinted eyes and disgust
It's not the President's fault. You definitely need to vote for #Trump if you want the Durham investigation to continue if you want to see indictments. If Biden is elected all of this will be swept under the rug! There's many other reasons as to why Biden shouldn't be President!
Joe Biden repeatedly gives racist answers because he is a racist.
Joe Biden repeatedly gives racist answers because he is a racist.
If you‚Äôve ever publicly trashed donald trump on the internet, but stay silent about what Biden said today, it‚Äôs time to face it. You‚Äôre part of the problem.
If he loses, it‚Äôs only because democrats cheated and stole the election. Biden is demented and can‚Äôt produce a coherent sentence.

Take them to President Obama until Joe Biden is swore in.
Trying to give Trump some sort of credibility based on Biden‚Äôs refusal of communion is simply nonsense. Trump lies every time he speaks. Nothing of value ever begins with a liar. He is a liar and anyone who supports him is a liar. PERIOD!
This week‚Äôs episode of   was a look back at the career of Joe Biden. When ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù is defined, it‚Äôs the crime bills and war on drugs that Joe Biden personally pushed through that define the term for most.
That's exactly why  is the clear choice for VP. Someone in Biden's Administration will be very busy cleaning up OUR Ally relationships.

Not going to push for Biden in any significant way and I'm not sure if voting for him will matter in Indy but cannot fathom a 2nd term of Trump doesn't do more harm than 1 term of Biden. I cannot imagine a president who's black bagging protestors won't do worse in the future.
Is Biden cancelling himself? Good riddance
I was not voting for Trump or Biden anyway.  I‚Äôll vote for Ye though.
Correction: I will never stop fighting the African American community.  -Joe Biden
Remember, Trump thinks HE‚ÄôS God. So many of his demented followers tell him that. I say, Go Biden.
The only optimism I have in regards to Biden is that the Democrats are easier to fight than the Republicans, as long as people don't become complacent like they did under Obama I think we can have a fairly large impact.
I mean holy shit , could you imagine if the orange man said this ?????? I mean I think Biden doesn‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs at most of the time but the dude is flat out saying racist nonsense now!!! Bye Joe!
DemoRats. You better go ugly early because #SleepyJoe isn't going to get better.
Did u ever question Obama and Biden about this ??
Oh sweetie. If you think Joe Biden is radical, well you‚Äôre just really not very smart.
Is that the mantra of your cult whenever joe Biden messes up?
100 day siege, then control Biden.
Does Joe Biden pay Jill's firm?
Even the twitter gods know Joe Biden is horrible.
Because Trump is more dangerous than Biden‚Äôs old ass.
In the history of the democratic party, no candidate has one the first 3 contests and lost the nomination. Bernie didn't "lose", he was cheated. Arguments to the contrary are naive at best or made entirely in bad faith. Fuck Joe Biden.
Biden again praises Latino diversity as being 'unlike the African American community'   His true feelings
treats all Americans and our diverse races as EQUALS!  He doesn‚Äôt pander to or patronize ANYONE unlike Joe Biden!
If a wrong VP candidate is chosen, we're guaranteed to repeat the Dukakis debacle of 1988. People are more dissatisfied in 2020 than they were in 1988, but Biden is weaker than Dukakis was.
Biden is an Elitist....one of us darlings....pass the beans ....
Actual picture of Biden hurting god. Lol
I hate to admit it but yeah I get a lot of smoke on fb when I criticize Biden or Pelosi.
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt know black or latino. He just knows Whites and Poors.
Biden is now a series regular on Supernatural
Isn‚Äôt Biden ending God or something?
Biden gets applaud for the same behavior but trump gets the boot? hypocrisy. Why can't we be objective. Both parties has their flaws but no one seems to think this way. I rather be independent and see which one does a better job. so far Biden isn't.
I live in downtown Indianapolis. All I see is Trump or Bernie stickers and signs. Biden is gonna win, but I sure as Hell don't know anyone voting for him.
Definitely will if Biden is elected!  Will need a way to protect my family. üò•
I mean, if Joe Biden is THAT powerful do you want to risk voting against him? #BidenDiety
Joe Biden be throwing shadeeeeee
Biden has no upstairs remaining.
#YouAintBlack. #YouAintDiverse, either.  ~ Joe Biden
I didn't know that about the electoral college. You are right tho. Part of me is just frustrated Biden thinks he is our saviour sum. If he has a female black VP it'll make things feel better.
Right. Point being that Biden is almost as bad as a Republican.
Since the idiot Biden won't debate Trump and is running a "basement" campaign then Trump can run a "rose garden" campaign for all I care.
I did not see you say anything about  Biden‚Äôs racist remarks today on your evening news but you got Michelle Obama on there again complaining about Trump #biasednews
Notable Exception: Wolf (Not Sheep; Per Biden)
Not so fast, the liberal media or the ‚ÄúDem propaganda arm‚Äù is going all out with lies, half truths &amp; omissions. The sin of omission  is the most dangerous which is SOP for     &amp;  No coverage of Sally Yates bc they‚Äôre are providing cover for Biden/Obama.
I put two Corinthians on the case, and neither one of them could find any evidence that Biden is against God. Sorry,
Ridin with Biden til the wheels fall off!!
why is it so hard for Trump supporters to understand that a criticism of Trump isn't an endorsement for Biden?
Anyone willing to admit that both Biden and trump give cause to worry about their mental acuity given their verbal floundering, screw ups, and impulsive stupid remarks?  I'm still voting for Biden, but it's shameful that we have to accept this.
#iBullshitYouNot   Joe Biden clarified his previous statement by saying THIS....
If you're a progressive - or basically anyone who agrees that the current administration is literally killing people by the 1000s - I would like to politely ask you to stuff your negative opinions of Biden until after the national election.
Trump is awful! If you are a catholic and support this monster you need to check yourself! Biden has been through hell and back in his life, been through more than most in a lifetime! Donald Trump makes me sick to my core. #VoteJoeBiden2020
Yeah, he really is exposing the hypocrisy of liberals. Like I thought the transparency of shamelessness with Republicans was bad but Dems are just as subject to manipulation and fear. The amount of arguments I had with a voter choosing Biden to "beat Trump" was exhausting
Just an opinion; Biden is afraid to debate Trump
So it was Obama and Biden that Macron and Trudeau and Merkle laughing at? Oh. No. It was Trump. Trump the laughing stock.
STARTING TODAY : FACEBOOK AND TWITTER HAVE REMOVED ALL THE PRESIDENTIAL ADS UNTIL NOV 1 , 2020 ! ISN'T THAT A COINCIDENCE ! NOT BIDEN !
Biden deserves it. Hes corrupt just like you all. Trump is helping Americans and the left continue to destroy it. God Bless Trump!!! Trump2020
Since 2020 is f*cked up anyway and nothing is normal, Biden should just pick 3 VPs
McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010) &amp; District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) prohibit your outrageous claim about Biden from happening. Dissolution of NRA (if truly engaging in criminal conduct...&amp; still regardless) doesn‚Äôt violate 2nd Amendment. #DoYourResearch #StopSpreadingLies

‚ÄúBiden passed test...‚Äù
Idk how Joe Biden can hurt god but that seems rather powerful. Let‚Äôs try it. We‚Äôve had far too many politicians that can just hurt us. Let‚Äôs share the pain.
Right, he's always had a hard time hiding his feelings of superiority &amp;racism. It's just getting harder. Yet I see many black people who will vote for him while calling Trump a racist. Pretty sure Biden never has &amp;never would have hundreds of non celebrity black people to the WH
Trump thinks Biden can "hurt God" -- LOL
I think the message Biden is sending here is, you can appreciate the past, but you must be willing to embrace the future.
Biden has told us what he really thinks of black people his entire career.  We just refuse to listen.
Top Democrats contemplate civil war if Biden loses
Ah yes, we're very close to FULL TRUMP from here on out. Holy hell.. and Biden is the one with mental issues?? "NO RELIGION, NO ANYTHING! HURT THE BIBLE, HURT GOD! HE'S AGAINST GOD! HE'S AGAINST GUNS!"
Watching Trump and Biden video clips on this here free website and thinking: "This ain't the best we can do...but this IS America."  phew.

How am I echoing that? I have talked about nothing other than this specific election. You‚Äôre acting like the current Republican Party would treat black people better lol. I‚Äôm not saying the Democratic Party or Joe Biden is faultless either so don‚Äôt cry to pull that.

Biden is right. The GOP will suppress, are steal your vote. It's actually part of their strategy, they  can't win without these tactics.
Come over to Biden! Excellent!
I think this pandemic saved them. It looks to me that Biden will win, but this would not have happened without Coronavirus
Are you saying Black voters don't want Biden?
How is Joe Biden going to "hurt God"? Is Joe Biden going to kick God in the nutsack?  From what I can tell, Drumpf has already done a good enough job at that already.
I don‚Äôt really understand you‚Äôre point in bringing this up. Biden has the overwhelming support of the black community as shown by South Carolina. His problematic statements are called out, rest assured, but he isn‚Äôt a racist unlike the man in the White House.
So The Implication Coming From The Republican Party Is That There Are African American Voters, (Representing The African American Vote) Who Would Rather Vote For A Black Man Suffering From Mental Illness, Than Vote For Joe Biden?
This is dangerously and completely false, on every single point. 1. The move against the NRA is because they as a non-profit stole $65 million from their members. It‚Äôs NOT political. 2. Biden is not going to take away our guns, or abolish the second amendment.
But the more important question is: can Biden defeat Thanos and recover the Infinity Stones?
Ilhan see what black people have to go through with the Democratic Party with Jew Biden‚Äôs comments against black Americans. immigrants you‚Äôll see eventually. Democrats need to #CutTheCheck and stfu. because black people built this country. constant disrespect all the time.
Biden has/will/might make some undefined gaffe(s) which helps Trump to win b/c his incompetence, ignorance, greed, lying, malevolence &amp; unpopularity are nonfactors, but sadly Trump fails to capitalize on silly words. Pretty fucked up take here.

p sure jon was actually asking for input and perspectives instead of asking a rhetorical question, which i think is how you took it lol. but ur answer was pretty insightful into biden's background for those who didn't know
I‚Äôm guessing Biden has drawn heavily upon his faith to help him deal with the deaths of his wife and children. To have a heathen like Trump casually spew vile, baseless attacks is beyond reprehensible.
Biden: I'll fight you both together if you want. I‚Äôll fight you with one paw tied behind my back. I‚Äôll fight you standing on one foot. I‚Äôll fight you with my eyes closed...oh, pullin‚Äô a horn on me, eh? Sneaking up on me, eh?
M. Blow the horn. G. What? M. Blow. The. Horn. G. Wait. This horn here? M. Blow it. Blow it now. G. But... R. My dudes, you argue like you are married. Shit, too late. HARK! HERE COMETH BIDEN! Biden: Put 'em up, put 'em up! Which one of you first? I'll fight you both together!
bad timing but actually not voting is absolutely a vote for Trump and in some theories of math it‚Äôs actually a net +2 votes for Trump. Certain truths are immovable no matter how underwhelming Biden is. But I forgot this is twitter n we don‚Äôt like actual tea that isn‚Äôt sensational

Ryan,  Biden is not perfection and was certainly not my first or even 10th choice. But your equivalence of Biden w Trump is reckless+dangerously close to #WhiteMaleEntitlement.  You are playing with fire. Black &amp; PoC are ALREADY getting burned. Nov.3.2020 is not political theory.
How in the f**k is Biden gonna hurt God? üôÑ
Evidently you r a hater...Trump has been the only president to work for us instead of for themselves like Obama/Biden did...and just so you know ur books are mostly shit books
As an atheist, the small, petty god Donald Trump appears to worship makes no fucking sense. Omnipotent, but apparently able to be outsmarted by Joe Biden.

It would become clear if you actually took 1.5 mins to watch the actually video. Literally when the debates happen and Biden isn't this blubbering idiot that can't get out a word (because he isn't), what are you gonna do?
Wait, so sleepy creepy Joe is so powerful he can hurt the Bible and God? Im trying to keep score, but the orange man is confusing me. I was told Biden was very weak and couldn‚Äôt pass a cognitive test? #help
‚ÄúI hate to break it to the idealists in my audience, but the next president ‚Äì whether it be Trump, Biden, or anyone else ‚Äì will commit impeachable offenses. Whether they promise to do it, like Biden did, or do it behind the scenes, like Trump does, it‚Äôll keep happening.‚Äù
This is why Biden shouldn't debate him.
Did you really say Biden doesn‚Äôt know what his message is?  When was the last time that you did?
yet again simply cannot do justice üòâ to  ironclad logic. Weak and powerful Oz named Joe Biden will rain fire from his basement and create new cases of Covid-19 with too many tests.
‚ÄúBiden is a sith!!‚Äù‚Äù
As my wife,  , says - who needs Babylon Bee when you‚Äôve got Joe Biden?
Finally, a message I can support. Biden wasn't my first choice, but this is a very welcome development.
joe biden is a black hole. he compacts. he consumes both the seen and the unseen. he destroys.
Trump: ‚ÄúBiden is going to take away everything! He will destroy the world!!‚Äù
This is unbelievable - all black people are ‚Äúthe same with only a few notable exceptions‚Äù according to Joe Biden.  I do not accept that... it is not true.
Also Biden apologized for his comments. Which i don't and wont ever condone.  But when has your bff took accountability for any of the massive fucked up disgusting things he done, said or tweeted? Damn near a 160,000 Americans have passed from this and says it is what it is
As a person trump might accuse of being ‚Äúradical left‚Äù allow me to assure everyone ‚Äúwe‚Äù are not against God or the Bible. Biden has a real relationship while Trump pretends about God to buy votes. This rant is a pack of lies. Trump can only gain votes through lies.
As a human I don't think it's even funny. The Democrats owe it to Joe Biden to let him drop out of the race.

You can bank on it.....Obama was black, Hillary was a woman, Biden is old.....they are beyond reproach. If you criticize them you are the (insert outrage term of the week)

This, by the way, is one of the many reasons why Pennsylvania will be so important. The Commonwealth has 20 (!) electoral votes. If Biden wins Pennsylvania and defends every Clinton state, Trump needs to:   1. Win TX, FL, NC, MI AND 2. Win *either* AZ or WI
Joe Biden doesn't know how twitter works
This pollster is rated "B-" by  They have Biden ahead in NC, AZ, and IA (all Trump 2016 states).   Biden needs to flip 35 electoral votes from 2016. Here are the electoral votes from those states:  NC: 15 AZ: 11 IA: 6
Joe Biden is a racist!
FYI, a lot of people going around saying Biden did a racism. Here is the full context of the clip in question.
Why would President-elect Biden want him there?
Biden has a problem with his bladder.

It has already and will get worse since Biden is their choice this time !!
The United States Postal Service has endorsed Joe Biden. Mail in voting seems like a good idea. #DemocratsSuck
Pretty sure nominating Biden already IS the best way to suppress the black vote for Biden...
All pedophile Biden has to do to win is keep his mouth shut. He can‚Äôt even do that.
Dementia Baby Killing Joe Biden. God help this country so many people are lost and consumed with the devil.

This suit would have filed even if Biden was in office. It‚Äôs corrupt to its core and the Russian $ that has laundered through there will eventual be exposed
I'd insist on a crew of real time fact checkers. Otherwise, Biden may spend his time trying to "correct" Trump on the facts.
I demand the Biden campaign reinstate its employees right to use tik tok.
Trump is gonna have a field day debating Biden üòÇ
President Biden should not directly involve himself in deciding what investigations occur; if he does, he‚Äôs no better than Trump. He should leave those decisions to the DOJ and his Attorney General.
I'm with you on this one. I am willing to bet Biden wont be the nominee.
The Media needs a horse race and by golly they will have one despite reality. I've seen projections that still have MI as a toss up and PA leaning Dem when Trump hasn't led in a single poll since Biden became nominee.
1. Trump completely mismanaged this crisis. 2. Biden is terrible. Still better than Trump. 3. Has been working for centuries. Not sure why it is suddenly an issue. 4. No one is trying to do this.
All that means to me is that Biden isn‚Äôt Trump and while avoiding more years of ineptitude is important it shouldn‚Äôt be the focal point of an election.
Annnnnnd the Biden Team opens back up the basement door.
How can anyone of any color become his Vice President knowing that Joe Biden IS a racist.
Biden asked Errol Barnett, who happens to be black, if he was a junkie for asking if Biden took a cognitive test.
Any way you slice it, Joe Biden needs as many votes as he can get.  There is no guarantee that people who supported for Bernie Sanders will support him. I will still vote for him.  Either he considers the Progressive platform or he can consider his career in the trash.
Listen , Biden is trying to do the trump thing where he talks all candid and honest but it‚Äôs not working. Stick to the script
I never said I wasn't voting, or not voting for Biden. Bernie Sanders is the only politician I've donated $$$. I voted Hillary because Trump was gonna be a disaster. I will vote for Biden, because he is the least worst choice. See the problem? Horrible vs bad, not good vs great.
This weekend, I‚Äôll be virtually surrounded by  volunteer leaders from around the country.  But on Sunday, when  drops by, you can join me!
Biden might also drastically improve in the rural latinx areas
The context of the entire video helps to understand why he was even comparing the two groups, but honestly, it's just as fucked up as it sounds here. Again, Biden is loud and wrong. I cannot believe this is the other option in November.
Wow Joe Biden is a complete idiot!!

Fly to Delaware and demand a debate on Biden home turf. He won‚Äôt leave the basement.
Trump should show up at Biden‚Äôs basement and ask for a debate.
Who else?  Biden Is hiding  now who wants a weak president

Why do you assume anyone that criticizes Biden doesn‚Äôt also criticize Trump?
I'm in Indiana. I haven't seen a single Biden sign or bumper sticker. Still seeing some people in Bernie gear.
#iBullshitYouNot   Joe Biden: All blacks think alike
I don‚Äôt know what some people are thinking but there‚Äôs not going to be much left of our country after another 4 years of Trump.   Also, I don‚Äôt understand the how electing Biden will inevitably lead to another massive Republican s**thead.
Agreed.... Hiden Biden needs to come out of the basement so the public can assess if he is fit for the office of the President. We know he isnt and so do his staff that are keeping him hid.
I have to say that  Biden theme music üé∂ üéµ beats even Kavenaugh-augh-augh. It‚Äôs very catchy and has a danceable beat. ü§£ü§£ü§£
There are only two of them. They've both been in the public spotlight for most of our entire lives. Both have been in the White house.   Also the debates don't really matter this time because T lies non stop and Biden will promise things he may not be able to achieve unless-wave.
I disagree with this in minor ways. We already know the DNC will use people with no remorse and no shame. However Jill Biden is willingly going on news outlets comparing Joe's and Donald's age as if just because they are the same age group they should be seeing the same problems.
You mean Biden‚Äôs non-illegal immigrant wife?
Biden's Democratic presidential campaign has launched a new national ad focused on Black Americans, urging them to stand up to President Donald Trump the way their ancestors stood up to "violent racists of a generation ago."
Biden will not be the democratic candidate! ‚åõÔ∏è
Was on a national organizers video call last night and I couldn‚Äôt be prouder of the work we‚Äôre all doing and excited about Indiana. Update on Joe Biden for Indiana below ...
Both are shitty, because Trump's version is more horrible, it doesn't make Biden's good.
Who will the Dems replace Biden with?
Joe Biden won‚Äôt succeed in locking us down either.  And this DR Spencer must work in a shithole that cant get its act together.
They can try , and he will have full pardon power until 2025 . Despite what the MSM tells you , the true polls which got 2016 correct have Trump crushing Biden ... Epic landslide about like Reagan Mondale .. Mondale was up by 10 in all polls , Reagan won 49 states...
More conservatives for Biden!
Why not make electoral votes proportional? That way everyone‚Äôs vote counts for something. i.e. if Trump gets 40% of the votes in California, he gets 40% of their electoral college votes added to his total and Biden gets 60%.

Compared to Trump, Biden is a genius
Compared to an obese reality TV star with the complexion of a carrot and an IQ to match, Biden will be an amazing president.
Move on. My vote is for Biden. At least he knows Yosemite. You have some serious issues. Just move on and enjoy your life because none of us do.
üòÇwe have made our minds up. Why tf would Biden want to debate a narcissistic lying bully? What would be the point? So no we don‚Äôt care to hear more your lies and cheap insults.
What the hell is she trying to say, I think Nancy is taking the Biden pill
Hello I am a white man and i must say most white people are incredibly ignorant and illogical. If you vote for Trump again you are a racist and its not even a debate. Vote for biden for fucks sake
Biden is back another comedy show, his family should stop this madness
Our citizens are very smart, Kanye shouldn't be significant in taking votes from Biden.  The Trump desperation is real.
Every time Gavin speaks I see red in California, he is as toxic to California as Biden is toxic for America. The Michigan governor is even worst she declared racism a public health crisis. He predict a lot of RED spreading around soon
I mean, tell me I'm wrong.
**hand to God**   Trump now wants to ADD another debate with FVP Biden to the schedule.   I mean, seriously?!  Trump wants to debate Biden (in front of the American people) AT ALL?!  I am just asking how many train wrecks can this guys be in?    Grab your popcorn.
Biden is just a placeholder for the Democrats. They‚Äôre going to kill him and say some ‚ÄúAlt Right Group‚Äù did it if he were to win the election.
Biden is weak on everything PERIOD!

Lol, biden wasnt in charge and they actually stopped testing for it.  And if you take out the 40% of covid deaths that happened in retirement homes thsnjs to dem governors, as well as deaths listed as covid that werent, then its LESS deadlier than flu, even with vaccine for flu.
Not this white girl!! Biden 2020
Senator Bernie Sanders and Biden have nothing in common.  Biden is little different than Trump;  Trump cheated his way to the top in the private sector as Biden cheated his way to the top in the public sector.  It is hard to believe that any Bernie supporter would vote for Biden!
What policy does Biden support that would earn your vote?
Because there‚Äôs a Republican group trying to get Kanye West back on the ballot to pull black votes from Biden
If I were her I wait until Biden has his inauguration so that trump does not resigned then try to get pardoned by pence!!
Joe Biden is really afraid of this test, he has struggled to successfully finish this one in a 15 minute timed test. üö©
He‚Äôs no dictator. Good luck with Biden.
Trump would stay if he could, but he can‚Äôt. At 12:01 PM on 1/20/21 we will be reminded of the ancient aphorism: ‚Äúthe king is dead; long live the king‚Äù. If necessary, the Secret Service, U.S. Marshals, the U.S. Army, et al will begin folllowing orders of President Biden.
Tensions flare as GOP‚Äôs Biden probe ramps up  via
Nothing that the establishment democrats have done in the past 3 decades has given me any reason to believe that people like joe biden are decent or care about us. He'll let people like me die before I see president 47 because he doesn't care. He said it himself.
the system will not allow anyone who will make meaningful change in the right direction to come close to power. Biden said it himself, "nothing would fundamentally change" if he wins.
ü§òüèªüëçüèªPlease keep calling this outüôèüèª. This is a Roger Stone special. He describes this tactic when getting Trump 2 bluff a run 2 silence Pat Buchanan/Reform Party who could have split the Republican vote in 2000. This time they r trying 2 distract a few Biden voters in key states.
Who believes Trump wants to do debates? I certainly don't. Biden making debates contingent on him releasing his taxes gives him the perfect out. After the Swan interview there is 0% chance we see Trump in any debates.
conservative politicians like Joe Biden have no interest in preventing these crimes or stopping the root causes that lead people to commit them, they only act to sustain the for-profit prison system that exists to keep people in jail to exploit for labor.
Trump is gonna clean Biden‚Äôs clock Nov 3 , it will glorious a landslide , epic annihilation ....
Actually Robert J O‚ÄôNeill and Intelligence killed Bin Laden. Obama approved the strike. Biden objected to the operation.
Just an observation, look how sharp  is at 86! He‚Äôs doing tv commercials and hosts the Pat Boone Hour on  50‚Äôs on 5. He could walk circles around  Biden has cognitive decline and I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs dementia. Not a Dr, but have a family member w it.
FOR THE BIDEN - TRUMP DEBATE THERE SHOULD BE 100 QUESTIONS IN PACKETS OF 5 AND OPENED JUST BEFORE THEY ARE ASKED BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE THE QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME FOR BIDEN TO MEMORIZE IF WE DON"T DO THIS !
The day we elect to Biden, Biden is going to do whatever the fuck he wants to do. Just like Obama did. Just like all Democrats do.
Here's how I know if you only watch Fox News: You think Biden is mentally failing; you think Biden doesn't want to debate Trump; you think Trump-touted meds work; you think the death and infection numbers are wrong (or vastly inflated). Watch other news. You're missing a lot.
because he helped create the crime bill in the early 90s that, according to him, did "everything but hang people for jaywalking," which he does not regret according to statements from earlier this year
Plus you and I both know Joe Biden didn‚Äôt type that. He can‚Äôt even say half of those words.
I pray President Trump is re-elected! Trump/Pence are better equipped to lead our nation than Joe Biden and any of his potential VP picks.
Joe Biden will never be President
Carl Sagan was smart! Not Joe Biden smart, but pretty smart!
Joe Biden‚Äôs strategy is to let Donald Trump talk.  The Trump interviews are a goldmine for Democratic candidates up and down the ticket.  ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù
I‚Äôve worked for Republican senators and have voted Republican all my life. But character counts, and the man in the White House has shown an absence of character. We need a leader who understands American values. I‚Äôll be voting for Biden this fall. #LincolnVoter
And Marianne. Both great. But one of them dropped out in exchange for an offer in the administration if Biden wins. The other one became a target of a media smear campaign packed with lies after she attacked the military industrial complex.
Trump campaign is helping him get on the ballot to take votes away from Biden.
Does Joe Biden....remind me of my grandfather whom I adore.......do I like.....Joe Biden as a person now??????
I love how Joe Biden is gun hoe for debates with Trump but his campaign is trying to cancel them.  It is like your grandpa wanting to drive and family trying to take his keys away.
trump has someone on his team advising Kayne West and working to get him on the ballots in hopes of splitting the Black vote against Biden.

My favorite quote so far of the  livestream was  talking about Biden's current campaign strategy: "Sit back and shut up."   (That's the consequence of being up in the polls in most of the battleground states, I suppose).
So do i have this right? The GOP actually believes that young people and POC are so stupid that they would support Kanye over Biden. For President of the USA.  Nah. Even Maghats aren't even that stupid!

My crew and I have personally delivered 2500 Biden signs to Dem clubs and individuals all around the state of Indiana.  Let me know if you want one. =D
Underwater or not, all it takes to give Trump the election is an act of idiocy on the part of Biden, such as naming HRC as his running mate or someone nearly as undesirable.
1. If Hillary wanted votes that went to Stein, she should have been a better candidate.  2. It‚Äôs a bold, stupid, and racist assumption that Black people will vote for Kanye instead of Biden just because he is Black.
No one can possibly take this man serious as a Presidential candidate...  Can anyone possibly think biden representing America is a good thing?  All the left wants is him in the White House so they will have full control and you will not see him ever again...
We need a person. Tha5 should had been elected in 2016. Hillary deserves being on Biden‚Äôs ticket.  Trump and people would use whatever. But Hillarynbe the smart move period.
I agree that it is pointless to hold these debates. However, if Biden backs out, the Republicans will use that- saying he‚Äôs too scared. It‚Äôs not worth the possible loss of votes from people who will believe it. (See this thread)

I thought we didn't want the federal government overstepping their boundaries? Our local police have an appointed chief by the mayor, reform if necessary comes from each locality. Biden can say anything to attract your vote but what can he actually do?

Up next (5:05) on  Sally Yates throwing #Comey under the bus and Joe #Biden did Joe Biden things in an interview.

IN05 is a bad guess. It was only .5 Donnelly in a blue wave. Donnelly was significantly more moderate then Biden with legitimate crossover appeal.  Any poll that has it +8 Biden is a polling error.

Even the logic makes no sense! If you think Biden and Trump are equal on Healthcare (I certainly don't, but that is what she is claiming), then you would look to the other subjects you care about to find distinction. Like police reform, racial inequality, lgbtq rights, and more!
Shocker..he won't even travel to a CVS...so what is new..big mistake ever gets in the white house..u will never see much of him ever..wake up voters this is a sick man n a sick plan by the one's who will lead Joe Biden.

Joe Biden is open game in today‚Äôs politics. The son of a former VP that isn‚Äôt political and a private citizen is 100% out of bounds. No one attacks Barron Trump. No one attacks Tiffany. But Jr., Ivanka &amp; Eric Busey are fake game as they‚Äôre advocates for daddy‚Äôs hateful agenda
My point still stands. Have fun complaining about how horrible the country is but write in your lord and savior Bernie. Was Biden my first choice? No. Will I vote for him because he‚Äôs better than an idiotic Orange King? Yes.
Joe Biden would be the most racist, dumbest, anti-American President in history if he won!  Joe Biden will never be President!
Biden could eat alphabet soup and crap out something smarter than Trump
But it‚Äôs a little different with Biden‚Äôs age this time.
Biden is not right for the U.S., and I don‚Äôt need to explain why, but due to the two party system that American politics is trapped in, and since it‚Äôs his turn to sit on the throne of the Democratic Party, he‚Äôs what we have. There is only one acceptable outcome on November 3rd.

For all of 2weeks before the dnc makes him step down for Kamala which is even more of a joke then Biden!!! Even Warren wasnt as 2faced as Kamala is but sure, keep pretending this is all above board and GOOD for America.  Embarrassing
Interestingly, Biden does not run factually incorrect ads on Facebook.   Yet Trump has posted factually incorrect ads over 20 million times.    He is a monster.
Joe Biden better shut down all schools, have restaurant restrictions to carry out or drive through, and all public places that aren‚Äôt grocery stores closed. If he doesn‚Äôt we‚Äôre gonna have more 2020 years to come.

I've seen first-hand how damaging this rhetoric about female ambition can be to someone's career. What's wrong with a VP who thinks she'd be a pretty good president?
Just saw someone on Facebook refer to Joe Biden as "a corpse" and said it was a "fact". I long for the day I am strong enough to leave all social media.
BIDEN, PLEASE
Well son of a b!tch, bye bye Biden &amp; Kerry!
The most recent Chapo diagnosed why Biden/Trump is the logical election because it‚Äôs whether you want to accept the decline of empire and go back to just feeling good while it falls apart (Biden) or if you want to fight it by raging against it reactively (Trump)
Lmao Biden owns.
I've only received texts from trump and I've donated money to Democrats before as well as Republicans. It makes me feel like Biden is pulling a Hillary and just assuming he can coast into office
That is laughable!  Biden or who ever is writing for him knows that this is wrong so this is just lying.  I don't know about everyone but I'm tired of this and can't wait for the elections to be over.  I'm voting for Trump.
Wise words from Victoria Greene of Sanctuary partner firm G Squared Private Wealth on how to allocate client assets ahead of the presidential election and market shifts that are likely to come along with it  #PartneredIndependence
You are trying to set up Obama and Biden for arrest. If you do that, this country will rise up and you will be forcibly removed from office.     #25thAmendmentNow
Meanwhile Trump talks about 150,000 dead people with "it is what it is" and we're talking about Biden stumbling over words. Joe's been doing that his entire career. He's a stutterer.
In most debates it is a good strategy to be aggressive to get your points in.  Trump would be wise just to let Biden keep speaking.
Most establishment media polls show President Trump trailing in a matchup with Joe Biden, but a closer look at the data shows that most of these polls may be built simply to discourage conservative voters from showing up.   History repeats itself.

I‚Äôm going to continue believing  Biden takes are actually prophecy and will turn correct.
I ‚ù§Ô∏è that you said Pres Biden!
Funny I‚Äôve been watching state polls ... Biden not even close to the lead Hillary supposedly had ... Biden will be crushed like Mondale against Reagan ... Mondale was up 10 on Reagan in every poll ... Reagan won 49 states ... damn near 50 ...
lmfao voting for Biden is not repairing a damn thing.  the country has been continually fucked since the early 20th century.  Acting as if this current climate only started when Trump took the office is asinine.  Is Trump a damn fool? of course.  Is he unqualified? of course.
For every Republican brave enough to denounce Trump there are at least five secret Republican voters who will vote for Biden in the polling booth.
I think that Joe Biden is that dumb.
Notice the retweet button on these two post talking about the miserable turnout for Biden are greyed out.
He's not black. Biden said so.
Have you seen Biden speak lately?  Not exactly glowing confidence.
Twitter seems to have deleted the Biden video
Rabi! No! You have zero hope for Biden?

Joe Biden asks a black man if he‚Äôs on cocaine.   Let‚Äôs not forget who pushed the war on drugs on the black community.  He still thinks that way people.   Open your eyes.
I mean, I told y'all from the beginning this was an inside job with Trump to try to steal minority voters from Biden. This is pretty much proof.
Are you going to cover Biden calling your black co worker a junkie in a interview?
Agree. Biden can misspeak and makes gaffes and the GOP will have a heyday with it.  Nothing to gain; he‚Äôs polling well.  Trump probably doesn‚Äôt want to debate but he‚Äôs a  bully and moderators don‚Äôt moderate properly.  They should mute for interrupting and going over time limit.
Keep trying leftie... While biden loses his remaining brain functions daily. But don't worry, mail in voting will allow president Trump to remain in office for years while they sue to get every last vote counted correctly. #MAGA

What‚Äôs gold is the fact every clip you have is edited for humor. Joe Biden is funny enough just being himself.
Biden would also be just a puppet.
Glad she made a clever comment on my page and then wouldn't answer a real question I asked that I have as a concerned voter. You are soooooo different than Biden üòÜ... Not
Did Joe Biden write that?
say what you will about biden but i‚Äôm personally glad we‚Äôve sent the hillary people to live on mars and there‚Äôs no more playing around with ads
Was that a racist comment, asking s black man if he is on cocaine. That is systemic racism at its finest. BAD JOE BIDEN

Remember when we were supposed to be crazy conspiracy theorists when joe freaking Biden won her district? ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥
Interesting.  However, too little too late. DOJ Barr, is low playing, nibbling around edges.  Hoping Biden gets elected so Barr can bury all this.  I do not believe for one minute Barr is on up and up based on his glacial rope a dope slow pace.
I will congratulate all teachers and be extremely happy. However there's no reason to believe Biden will do this. His record is horrible. Hillary 2.0. Resisters never learn. Same shit every 4 years.

Biden: please meet your next vice president, orb bruenig  Liz: what
I‚Äôm fine with that. However, even if  Biden had sex with a chicken on the debate stage I would still vote for him over Trump.  Even if Trump shot and killed him on 5th Avenue,  I would still vote for Joe. There is absolutely nothing that would keep me from voting against Trump.
Then vote for Biden. Even this conservative can see that.
if you truly want systems and channels of regulation to work better you want some like Warren to lead the operation. Not mf Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden. But I‚Äôm used to being surrounded by people with no taste or discernment at this point
I hope he interviews Biden, or should I say will basement Biden permit it
What about Joe Biden eulogizing a white supremacist lmao

So, is Biden still the one that makes us Socialist?
Perfectly stated.   For their VP choice, Dems prefer identity over job qualifications.  The pandering Dems believe the target audience is too stupid to understand the difference. Wrong &amp; condescending but fits their beliefs &amp; Biden‚Äôs  ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote for me  you ain‚Äôt black.
Biden can‚Äôt handle a friendly stage with his wife and sister! Is there room for a Nurse too?
I had decided to give AOC a temp pass when she started working with Biden, but now I‚Äôm back to fighting to end her political career.
If Biden doesn't it would look disingenuous.  However, if you work for the Trump campaign, you have to ask yourself if Trump should participate in any debates.  Everytime Trump opens his mouth, his incompetence and lack of humanity just look worse.  Biden must think of that too.
Must have a Biden 2020 tattoo.
And what do you call what you've allowed to happen? Obama and Biden learned from H1N1, worked closely with Doctors, Scientists, and Researchers to put together a step by step plan to follow should we encounter another epidemic or pandemic, but you destroyed it.üò° You're next!
‚ÄúIt has long been thought that America could not simply vibe its way out of its problems. What this administration supposes is.......what if we could?‚Äù -Biden inaugural, 2021
"Now you see if Biden promises to do absolutely nothing, he'll win with 80% of the vote!"  Because in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis, that's certainly what you want on the tough road to recovery afterward. Just someone to not pass a single thing.
As I said the other day, the Biden campaign is going to able to use President Trump‚Äôs interview with Axios in their campaign advertisements.   All they are going to have to do is slap a ‚ÄúBiden 2020‚Äù banner at the end. Trump is making Biden‚Äôs campaign ads for him.
The American Postal workers union have already endorsed Joe Biden. This clerk union will be handling all of mail in voting.
Biden agreed to debates in June...  but keep working hard at the smear while your boss can‚Äôt pronounce our most famous National Park.
Joe Biden's VP pick.
. just doubled down on his most outrageous election prediction yet
This tactic of the Trump campaign lowering expectations FOR Biden...is unheard of in modern politics.   Usually you lower expectations for yourself. Trump Jr. can probably expect a basket of mini-muffins and a thank you note from the Biden camp soon.
Friends of Bernie is directly involved in the Sanders-Biden Task Force. I don't understand this anger.
They found Hunter Biden?
Why would Biden debate Trump? There is ZERO upside for Biden. Even if he‚Äôs perfect Don‚Äôs people will distort anything. Biden is polling ahead WITHOUT a debate
Remember your magnanimity about verbal stumbles when it comes to Joe Biden.
She showed it for the world to see. Be interesting to see if she has a position in the Biden  administration after that fiasco.

Sarah Sanders on push to 'hide' Joe Biden from debates: 'He can't defend his record'  #FoxNews
That's not the reason.  The reason he's losing is lack of a cohesive message and REASON to vote FOR him, not vote against Biden.  4 years ago,  had a consistent message.  If you voted for him, you knew EXACTLY what you were voting for. Now, not so much.
Random thought: everyone‚Äôs worried about Biden doing interviews and debates.  The more I hear 45, I can‚Äôt understand why his people aren‚Äôt worried.  My suggestion, there would be no debates unless unbiased fact checkers were given the last 5-10 mins to let America know the truth
tbh the only way Biden wins is if his VP is a straight W
He doesn't have to be that skilled to beat Mr.Dementia...bet Biden doesn't end up being the nominee
5. The polls and projections could suppress voter turnout again like they did in 2016. If the polls show Biden winning easily in every state a significant portion of people will just think it's just an easy W for Biden like they did in 2016 for Clinton.
4. Even though it's anecdotal, having traveled a bit in the south in the past few months and the Midwest I can say that there's a lot of Trump paraphernalia out and about and very little Biden stuff, at least from what I've seen in the areas I've been.
3. There's plenty of time for Biden to screw up in a huge way. He'll probably pick some establishment VP person like Susan Rice. Doing nothing for enthusiasm and energizing Trump's base who think they will be getting Obama 2.0 and don't want it.
1. Trump has more enthusiasm than Biden. Everyone I know who wants to vote for Biden says it's basically just what they have to do. Trump still has diehards. 2. Pandemic. For however he has handled it, people tend to stick with the devil they know in hard times
As someone fairly disinterested in the outcome, I honestly can't imagine being a person who sincerely believes Joe Biden has it in the bag and will easily win.
It's over for Biden then...either was he's done
No pedo‚Äôs love Biden. I like Trump
FOR THE BIDEN - TRUMP DEBATE THERE SHOULD BE 100 QUESTIONS IN PACKETS OF 5 AND OPENED JUST BEFORE THEY ARE ASKED BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE THE QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME FOR BIDEN TO MEMORIZE.

Biden needs to go on Fox and see how that interview goes
Nice try. They'll still check "Biden" on that mail in ballot.
The Democrats are scared as hell ... Trump will crush Biden ...
They've also got Washington at Likely D after 3 polls showing at 20+ point lead for Biden
RCP moved Minnesota to tossup after a Fox poll showing Biden up by 13, and a TRAFALGAR POLL showing Biden up by 5. When Trafalgar has the Democrat winning, and you move the race to a tossup, there's something wrong with your judgement.
Biden is 77 though, 82 by the time his term would be over. There‚Äôs a real possibly the VP might have to come into play at some point, I think
Na, y‚Äôall would work overtime to bury it. Just like the NYT defending Biden and company trying to not debate the President.
Yes, Biden‚Äôs strategy of [checks notes] standing quietly to the side while Trump gibbers, howls, and rubs shit in his hair is clearly doomed.
Mine is Jan 21. All I want is President Joe Biden officially in office
Biden has been putting out a populist message... but he is likely to revert to neoliberal centrism once in office...  so I guess Trump is the true populist only because he has partially delivered on his populist message?
Trump's Axios interview is the best campaign ad for Biden yet.
We have to pick between this buffoon and Joe Biden‚Äôs corpse in November. What a joke
The House Socialist Dem.s do not listen to anyone..they r so self consumed with sticking Biden n office n hiding that he is not fit..they have never cared 4 anyone but there own selfish selves..now if it was one of their family u would hear an entirely different story...shameful
Good grief. You're running with that? There are serious concerns about the state of Joe Biden's health, specifically his mental health. He's presenting all of the symptoms of middle-stage dementia.  Your man Joe doesn't know where he is half the time. Find a new candidate.
Ooh, someone from Biden's campaign should get Tucker's information on this.  LOL! I think he ties his bow ties too tight.
Biden is saying that the American people would be kept in the dark again, and have no idea of the actual goings on in the White House, with him as president. We like Trump to tell us in person, thank you.
The truck driver&amp;his family had every right to sue Biden for libel, but they couldn't sue him because the Democrats have a different justice system then we do. It's called The Dept. of No Justice. Ask Hilary why anybody who is scheduled to testify against her suddenly dies. Hmm.
I look forward to the debate with Biden. Two old guys who struggle to put a coherent thought together. A real battle of the big brains. It'll be epic
Considering that there are at least 2 women who are NOT Black that Biden is considering (one of them being Elizabeth Warren), it just shows once again that racism has no foundation in logic.
Poll ¬ó Trump takes lead over Biden
Biden ain‚Äôt much better I hate this 2 party shit man
Bahahahaha, #wastingavote  She speaks better than Biden. BTW, your not voting for Biden, hope you like the VP nominee. You will, you like being told how to think. and will go blindly.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the one who is one year older. I‚Äôm 76 and hope that Joe Biden is elected president November 3 2020. I‚Äôm not sure if I could survive the 4yrs of Trump. I do know that the American way has taken a great hit backward the last 4 yrs. Four years more of him
this is the perfect slogan for the Biden campaign
I think the concern is what we‚Äôre seeing in  interview with  ... strategy will be to toss out made up stats/figures and put the onus on Biden to prove him wrong on the spot. A challenge for anyone to do and why Jonathan‚Äôs interview was great!
If you don't agree with him, you must be pro Biden! Nice child-like reasoning.   It really is the children who flock to Trump.
Should be in literally every Biden ad.
Jfc, that‚Äôs provably not true. The only people who think that only watch edited clips from conservative twitter or Facebook. You can research Biden‚Äôs positions and policy proposals now. Bit you won‚Äôt. You‚Äôre right, you shouldn‚Äôt vote.
I hope the  message resonates through out America!!!  Youth doesn‚Äôt care because they don‚Äôt need it and they are living for the day!  stand by our President / stop mail in voting - don‚Äôt stand for it!  The left will put the final nail in our coffin if biden wins!!!
So the country that produced Abraham Lincoln, MLK, Henry Ford, Teddy Roosevelt, Jesse Owens, Thomas Edison, The Wright Bros., Ben Franklin, Andrew Carnegie, and Amelia Earhart is putting forth Joe Biden and Donald Trump for president in 2020. That's the best we can do, eh? Neat.
Always Remember Joe Biden Misled Everyone About Wife's Death, Blamed Innocent Man for Years
Trump has claimed there is an aids vaccine, that airports were around in the 1770s and so many other crazy statements it‚Äôs hard to keep track. You add up all of Joe Biden‚Äôs gaffes you get one trump press conference. Hell watch his axioms interview that came out today, guy is nuts
I wouldn't be judging Joe Biden after the mess Individual One has gotten us in, by the way you can't dance.
Of the Democrats had nominated a pile of rocks that would be an improvement over trump. Biden being nominally better than rocks and far superior to trump has my vote
liberal logic: after Floyd‚Äôs death liberals say ‚Äúthese officers don‚Äôt represent all law enforcement.‚Äù  one trump supporter defaces a B.L.M. mural and it‚Äôs ‚Äúall Trump supporters are racist, sexist radicals. all hail Joe Biden.‚Äù
Joe Biden is and always has been an untruthful man.
In any other election, I would absolutely agree with that logic. I don't support Biden, but I'm going to do everything possible to make sure we dont have four more years of this administration, even if that means voting for him.
No open debates?  Then  shouldn't be a candidate.    Biden participated in the Democratic debates, no debates then he cannot be the Dem nominee...period.
I was seeing #sexism here too. I think ‚Å¶ has proven her ability to overcome this time and time again...Smile more? Some critics see sexism in debate over Biden VP (from
I‚Äôm looking at the latest Rasmussen Poll and Biden‚Äôs lead is slipping big time. This was the only poll that was accurate in 2016. His support amongst African Americans is going up. From 12% in 2016 to anywhere from 23-31%. Biden might be in trouble.
And for Joe Biden to do the same  Oh wait, he did that months ago
Here's Glenn!  - Revolutionary Communist Party endorses Biden - Kanye officially names his running mate as presidential campaign presses on  - ESPN's show creates Twitter poll asking if it's "funny" that Jonathan Isaac, who refused to kneel during anthem, suffered gruesome injury
It is upsetting to see Biden winning without any interviews huh lol? #Voldemort is angry today ü§£ü§£ü§£
Exactly.  The Senate is key.  If Biden wins &amp; the Dems have majority in Senate lord help us all.  We‚Äôll all be holding onto our wallets.
if biden has dementia, this man has just straight up been pronounced dead.
Most Republicans hate Trump.  Biden is a clown though.  Plus, a Biden vote is a vote for Bernie/Warren/Socialism/AOC/the looney Left.  If you‚Äôre middle class the Dems will consider u as rich.  It‚Äôs happened before.  Not to mention the asinine accrued wealth tax they want.
You mean like Biden &amp; his son making millions off his time in office..not at all original COVID death projections for America were in the millions &amp; a vast majority of deaths are from blue states putting COVID patients in nursing homesLet's use McCabe's logic.  has repeatedly said that "China is not a problem." Also, he and his party, will not condemn the Chinese gov for not deterring the spread of Covid. THUS, using McCabe's logic, Biden must be a Chinese asset and we need a full  investigation.
Joe Biden is Supposedly Catholic But He Hasn‚Äôt Condemned Arson and Vandalism of Catholic Churches and he believes in abortion!
Hopefully, very few Biden supporters watch or buy their stuff. Also, something tells me that those who will vote for W were not planning to vote for Biden. I haven‚Äôt yet seen serious analysis of the ‚ÄúKanye voter.‚Äù
These are Joe Biden‚Äôs followers!
Biden you‚Äôre an idiot! And a pervert!
Biden is a idiot!
Disingenuous. Whoever  picks as VP will most likely become President if Biden is unable to serve a full term. That‚Äôs why Biden will surely not pick a progressive as VP. Just another corporate shill to maintain the status quo.
I'm at the point where settling for Biden makes some sense. I mean, he's a war hawk who supports border camps and the war on drugs, but maybe doctors won't be able to discriminate against trans people.
Was Joe Biden ever worthy of anyone‚Äôs vote?
Christ your Slow..... You can thank the Democrats for the Division.  Your nuttier than a Payday thinking Biden is a step up. Your still asleep
And that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll get if you elect Biden!!!!! #DrainTheSwamp #VoteRedToSaveAmerica  #VoteTrump2020

I was just saying this to my parents. The media polls make zero sense as they are small controlled groups. Also, has someone checked on Biden? Haven‚Äôt heard from him in awhile....someone better make sure he still knows he‚Äôs running, or who he is?
Joe Biden is a practicing Catholic, btw...
Maggie, Biden was correct - AA community is less ethnically or culturally diverse (most of its members were born and live in the US) than Latin community (a conglomerat of various ethnicities and cultures many of whom still identify selves with nAtions of their origin).
Ah yes. Commies for Biden.
Obama committed treason. Hillary failed the Americans at Benghazi. Biden can‚Äôt complete a thought/sentence.
This nigga Joe Biden really said black people are a monolith üò≠üò≠üò≠ I fucking hate everything
Keep in mind, this is the same man who thought he had the authority to tell members of the Black community wether or not they were actually black because of who they might vote for. Biden has consistently reinforced the Black monolith stereotype...
Somewhere other than China or Russia. Biden and the Dems/Antifa control all that corrupt money...
Biden‚Äôs power to hurt God is unsurpassed by anyone in human history. But if true.
I couldn‚Äôt believe what  was saying about how if Biden wins the entire animal kingdom will rise up to eliminate the human race. #MAGA #Trump2020
Clinton Foundation is far more corrupt. Go after the bigger criminals first. Clinton, Obama, Biden...
Does... does Joe Biden think Africa is all one country?
Kinda like teachers unions, etc are in bed with the Dems. No secret the GOP supports the 2A, and the Dems don‚Äôt. Everybody picks a side. So what‚Äôs the big deal? No need to spin anything. If you‚Äôre looking for ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù check out Obama/Biden/Clinton etc....wow, big time!!
How can anyone be surprised by this? This is who Biden is.
So according to Biden the Black community is not as diverse as the Latino community...üôÑü§°
It would be fun, if Biden agrees on an editions debate related to theological issues. You know, with Bible quotes and fables (I am absolutely non-religious, I hope it‚Äôs not a blasphemy)
Joe Biden just sitting back and letting Trump ruin himself all alone. Literally the country is burning, Biden has done nothing, bc well why should you when its all happening anyway.  Side Note. Both candidates are like the bottom tier presidential candidates. Ever.
Biden you‚Äôre a idiot!
Biden's not showing up in Milwaukee to accept the Democratic Nomination. I don't see what the fuss is about and how that is any different?
Biden:  "The..thing...with the legs...and putting them...one...in front...of the..other...going...really fast...in a forward direction...over a.. what's it called..long distances. Is distance a word? What's a distance?" Everyone: "You mean a marathon." Biden: "Yes, masturbation."
Joe Biden's mind is like me hungover after a 3 day bender.
By the way, have you ever think - how is it possible that Biden touches ‚Äúinappropriately‚Äù in front of cameras? If he does it on cameras, maybe there is nothing inappropriate? Have u ever kissed ur wife/gf/friends? And then this appears online with accusations.
Trump-Biden moment.   Used to call them blonde moments.

Living in Indiana, I've seen 1 Biden sign, 1 Jo Jorgensen sign, about a half-dozen confederate flag bumper stickers/yard signs/etc, and 3-4 Trump signs.
Joe Biden you are the real loser, a two time loser runningfor President and a third just a few months away!
Think both Trump and Biden should address the nation instead with their Top 10 Presidential Priorities and a narrative on each.
In other words - I am not VERY enthusiastic to vote for Biden (belonging to 40%) but VERY enthusiastic to vote AGAINST trump (65%). Sometimes hatered is stronger than love :(
Joe Biden is a pervert!
Biden just wants everything give him, PISS on Joe Biden!
The American ppl deserve to know the truth about Biden‚Äôs involvement in spying on the Trump Campaign.... BEFORE the election.
I understand ur frustration but ...hope dies last ...I hope Biden will be able to return normalcy when ppl trust thei giv-t. It won‚Äôt happen overnight but with it can be done calmly and steadily. Fingers crossed.
The Trump campaign really can't use the "What about Biden's mental state?" nonsense. Case in point ‚§µÔ∏è
What ever Joe Biden in NOT the POTUS!
Imagine buying fake Russian dirt on your opponent and then having the full weight of the President (Obama) and VP (Biden) who use FBI/CIA/FISA courts to spy on and sabotage the guy that whooped your tail and then failing with you soft coup. KAG2020!!!
Strange that Obama waited so long to endorse Biden? üò¨ü§î
Hope Biden creates a very important office. Agency Czar (Czarina).   perfect! Agency heads, Insp Generals would answer to her. Our govt has gone thru an upheaval and somebody who knows ropes has to clean house, return integrity, improve functionality, be creatively "key".
They know Biden can‚Äôt handle unscripted dialogue
Bwahahaha!!! I hear Biden can‚Äôt wait to learn who he picked for VP. Poor guy doesn‚Äôt even know where he is
The thing I'd really like to hear from Biden's team is: if we're not on track in 2022 or 2023 with whatever policy they've passed in that time, how would they want to 'step on the gas' to actually meet these goals
I don't either... Biden is Worthless !!  Has there every been a Presidential campaign without debates?
For two months after Trump initial travel ban, Biden said the action was xenophobic.... then he conceded as Trump action saved thousands of lives.
My parents had a news show on and the host said something about how Biden has been embraced by the radical left and I CACKLED.  The radical left doesn‚Äôt like anyone. (1) there are like 12 radical lefts and (2) none of them like Biden that much
Evidently Mike wants to pay MORE taxes. Some of us actually don‚Äôt. Biden already said he would raise them. Oh yeah Beto coming for your gun too. Open borders, defund police, close fed prison, get rid of ICE/DEA, trillions in the green new deal
Um, surprise! Did anyone actually believe that Biden wouldn‚Äôt do this? Really?
Biden isn't the President yet.
We don‚Äôt have to worry about Biden‚Äôs tweets just his ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù and mental capacity. #Trump2020
Yeah. About that: can Biden revoke it on 1/21/21?
The fact that that clip came out in October and Trumo still won shows how shitty of a candidate Hillary was. The same thing is happening in 2020. Joe Biden is barely cognizant. The Dems have thrown everything at Trump and his numbers are still about the same.
Biden spent the last 40+ years saying he‚Äôd work for us.... I‚Äôm not crossing my fingers he‚Äôs going to fulfill that promise this time around.
If Biden announced VP today it would be on the very early side historically. People are insane.
Black Joe Biden forgot his meds again. He still needs time to process Trump is gonna win in November and his so called purge movement is losing.
A perfect way to end 2020 would be an electoral college tie between Trump and Biden.
Biden Campaign Says He Is So Close To A VP Pick He Can Smell Her
Biden Campaign Says He Is So Close To A VP Pick He Can Smell Her
Why endanger your child's future, maybe, with Biden when you can endanger him right now for Trump?
Is this some innuendo that Biden will select Tammy Duckworth as his running mate? Can't see Trumps being 'compliant' about anything.
This mother trucker here has probably never listened to a single shred of any music in his life to even think that this is what music is all about. He needs mental help and fast cause he's turning into a black version of Joe Biden. #kanyedelusiondisease
Have you ever listened to any music in your life? Cause I'm seeing a whole lotta naddas in your dumpster fire of a "statement".  I'm sure Aerosmith wrote soooo many pieces aiming at oppressing black people.....god you're getting as bad as Biden now with being delusional.
#kanyedelusiondisease still getting to ya. Poor thing obsessing over Trump like a dog in heat. Follow Biden's example, set an alarm and take your meds before dementia sets in.
Ironic that  was behind the Palin decision, a leading Biden supporter now.
And the fact that Karen Bass told the Biden team she‚Äôs not interested in running and they were relieved is also a terrible, sexist, hypocritical double standard. Biden himself was VP and harbored presidential aspirations for 32 years!!!
Those that blow shit like this off are as sick as Biden ! No way that mentally diseased and defective pedo should ever be President !
Joe Biden is a coward!
Karen Bass get Biden‚Äòs dick out of your mouth!
Biden is a coward!
I will not support Joe Biden Or his VP pick, no matter who it is.
Mark Cuban supports Joe Biden which makes me doubt any sound advice he may give
I don‚Äôt care who Biden picks as his running mate, I will support her. We can not have 4 more years of the current regime.

Gen Z on their way to vote for Biden after 3 months of Trump's TikTok ban
And Joe Biden will not defund the police either. He has mad that commitment  to all of us several times.

You watched a different video than i did....that‚Äôs NOT what happened. Fauci was stammering around like Biden....
Wow. Absolutely unarguably that youtube is biased and supporting Joe Biden. I searched the five for today and this is the warning at the top of the screen. Wtf. I have youtube premium. I dont want your fake news posts
Well at the very least if ppl have concerns about Trump's background, they certainly should be very concerned about Biden's inconsistent and sketchy history.
First, everyone can have and express their opinion, even if others don‚Äôt like it. I disagree with Rendell but it‚Äôs his opinion. Second, Biden‚Äôs VP is more than just a VP due to his age and 1 term promis. Third, timing of announcement is important, he shouldn‚Äôt take it lightly.
Traveling today, I‚Äôve seen at least ten Trump bumper stickers, no Biden ones.  I‚Äôm beginning to think Biden supporters are a myth üòÇ  #Trump2020LandslideVictory

What‚Äôs funny is that he thinks we care what he has to say. Last time I checked, there are credible allegations  that Obama, Biden, and his administration committed treason.
China is the biggest threat to America and the rest of the world. As Dems continue to pander to the #CCP, they nominate a puppet. Biden has proven to be weak on all fronts: mind, body, policy, leadership, and China. America needs

He‚Äôs as bad as Biden!
Joe Biden, April 23: "Mark my words: I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow; come up with some rationale why it can't be held."  President Trump, April 27: "I never even thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that?"   July 30:
Biden is 78. Any VP he picks needs to start preparing to become president the moment she is chosen. That‚Äôs in fact the more important of the VP‚Äôs two constitutionally mandated jobs. The other is to preside over the Senate.

Obama and Biden was smart enough!
Biden is also a pervert!
It's not clear what Biden meant, and it's his obligation as somebody trying to be the leader of a global superpower with thermonuclear weapons to be INCREDIBLY clear in his communications.
We'd better get on the ppl who have to organize the huge undertaking of absentee balloting first so we can make Biden happen.üá∫üá∏
If they "infamously pull low numbers for Biden" that wouldn't mean the trajectory wasn't useful. If the "real" shift is B+60 to B+53, a poll that consistently showed low for Biden might show something like B+52 to B+46
Democrats got in a tizzy about big donors and cooperate sponsors; what they don‚Äôt want you to know: big tech and liberal controlled media propagate division and disinformation to keep the Biden campaign alive. #Trump2020If Biden wins; China wins but if President Trump wins; Russia wins. I see nothing good from these two outcomes  Seeing Trump as ‚Äòunpredictable,‚Äô China would prefer he not win reelection, intelligence official says
If you don't want people to invalidate your very real and credible concerns about a Biden campaign then I sure as hell better not catch you invalidating someone else's very real and credible concerns about Trump being re-elected. Criticize Biden as the solution? Sure.
But yes. Biden makes it harder and harder to make that choice every single fucking day. It's like he wants to lose or at least doesn't give a shit about fucking over progressives openly and blatantly
Not to mention federal police being deployed to areas that aren't Washington DC without the consent of the governor's in said state. It's a shitty choice and Biden isn't gonna solve anything but I don't blame them. Shitty choice no matter what.
I‚Äôm sorry but Biden accidentally comparing the diversity of the Black &amp; Hispanic community DOES NOT EVEN COMPARE to Trump making his followers believe that the entire BLM movement are terrorists. Biden ain‚Äôt the best but shit he ain‚Äôt done nothing as bad as Trump
i support you ~ but too say Joe Biden is against GOD makes you look really bad
Don't compare the two. Biden has dementia. Trump is at least capable of coherent thought
I stand by my statement that Biden and his supporters push me farther and farther into disbelief every single goddamn day
Neither Trump or Biden are looking to change that. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for as a voter.  Find me a candidate who wants real, fundamental change away from exploitation (b/c stock market growth is all that matters) to valuing ALL of the people who make it all happen
And it will turn up voter enthusiasm for Biden.  Thank you, Mr. Trump.
More people advocating to vote for Biden need to adopt this rhetoric. Stop pretending he isnt trash.
See, this is the kind of "vote for Biden" rhetoric we need none of this pretending he's a good candidate bullshit
And this is all we could come up with in the Presidential election in the greatest country in the world? President Trump vs former VP Biden? 4 years ago was Trump vs Clinton
'Breathtaking' ‚Äî Trump Has 'Caught' Obama &amp; Biden Spying On Campaign, 'Now It's Up to' Barr
Every day Biden and his supporters somehow make it at least 50% harder to not cringe when anybody voices any sort of support for him without the words "he's a fucking trash candidate" immediately preceding it
It‚Äôs not an argument, it‚Äôs absurd claim used as a scare tactic by people like Tucker Carlson and Charlie Kirk and their followers just repeat it like a game of telephone.  Kirk yesterday said ‚Äúthe postal service endorsed Biden, so how can we trust them not rig the election?  üòë

Tucker Carlson: In Biden's hunt for a VP Susan Rice takes the lead ‚Äì and she's a threat  Joe Biden. They're in it for the power and they want it -- badly.
I agree with why you're not voting for Biden but I can't justify or endorse not voting at all. There are definitely other options, including voting green party to get them funding. Or any other downballot candidate. Not voting is a total waste and part of the problem
I definitely don't agree with him on Biden stuff sometimes, but he does make a very valid argument for him more than any other Biden supporters I have encountered and doesn't pretend that he isn't a shit candidate
I don't think they legit think Trump would crush him intelligently in a debate. I think they're probably banking more on Trump bullying the fuck out of him in a debate, and Biden won't be able to respond without looking like a chump because he is also not that intelligent
Your point? You're honestly going to sit here and say Trump is in a better mental state than Biden when we see him in real time misunderstand like 3 charts?
But yet again you are saying Trump is the worst candidate to ever exist.  So you will vote for whoever the Democrat candidate is.  You don't bother to say why Biden is great, you just point out that Trump is bad.  Going back to how this whole thing started.
You know the answer to your own question. Trump says or does something stupid almost every day. Biden is just letting Trump hang himself. No need to say a word.
Dems always make this argument every time.  In 2012 Biden said a Romney Presidency was going to put black people back in chains.  Well that sounds like a pretty evil dude to me, but now he is a Dem hero!  You guys are letting the GOP drag you right.  SMDH
The government isn't supposed to do such things.   Also the Obama/Biden administration left the cupboards bare
You obviously don't have a clue about what you're writing. I support the President because he stands up for religious freedom, stands against the evil of abortion, and supports the western ideas that founded this country. He is the one standing against Marxism, and that POG Biden
I know Biden is still gonna have problems, but I also want him to Trump to lose just to shove it to all the racists that support him.
You made me laugh. Thanks for that. TDS is strong within you. Good luck with nursing home Biden.
I'm sure it will be much better than Biden with H1N1
I don‚Äôt know about y‚Äôall, but after 2016, I don‚Äôt trust polling numbers one bit.   All these polls saying Biden taking a big lead... they said the same thing about Clinton and we know how that turned out.
1.) You assumed I am not voting for Joe Biden when I mentioned nothing about my decision either way 2.) I am voting. However, it'll either be for Green party or Biden. And right now Biden is making it REAL hard to vote for him
It's not my fault if I don't vote and Trump wins, it will be Biden's fault for not earning my vote.  I realize you guys decided you will vote blue no matter who 30 years ago, but I'm out of the cult.  I will never ever ever vote GOP, but I won't blindly give to Dems anymore.
If Uncle Joe Biden is unwillingly to participate in debates then we must assume he‚Äôs unfit for office. #UnfitForOffice #Trump2020Landslide
Like what happened to people not voting for Bernie because his supporters were toxic? Biden's supporters are far more toxic and delusional than them
I don't blame them for being afraid of what he is capable of, especially given the current circumstances with protests and federal police, but saying fuck you to people with serious issues that won't be solved with Biden's platform doesn't help your case
It's hilarious how everybody, whenever you bring up extremely relevant concerns about Biden's candidacy, they immediately defect to saying you're "throwing a tantrum" and then go huddle up in a corner and chant to themselves "orange man bad, orange man bad, orange man bad"
Not two days ago someone was shitting on me for criticizing the DNC and Biden for not supporting M4A (because the polling previous to this didn't indicate the "majority" supported it) but look where we're at now bitch
I agree, and will vote for Biden like I did for Clinton.  Not a fan of either but both are clearly better than Trump even if it‚Äôs only because he sat the bar so low!  IF Trump wins the frustrating thing will be the DNC again blaming Bernie instead of looking in the mirror.
Joe Biden goes to church - do you? Nope. You just sit and tweet hate on Sunday morning.
Nah! We are ALL excited to be rid of Trump and Joe Biden will be a great replacement to return this country to its true greatness!
Yes! Elect Joe Biden!

A note concerning qualifiers (and language by degrees): to call anything surrounding the Biden orbit the silliest goddamn thing you've seen in years belies the entire Trump Presidency*.
I sincerely apologise for this joke. At this point I wouldn't even be surprised if Biden announced Elmo was going to be his VP
"nononono don't talk about Biden's extremely concerning flaws shhhh let's pretend they don't exist otherwise it'll hurt his chances. Just .. just lick the boot okay? Don't ask questions"
The second half of this conversation about the choice for Biden‚Äôs running mate was great.
Blaming the people pointing out Biden's flaws instead of putting the pressure on Biden to NOT have those flaws is ridiculous. We have morals on this side of the aisle, and saying we should not criticize him bc it will hurt his chances is real dumb.
And nobody said I'm not voting for Biden. I'm just not going to pretend he isn't an absolute trash candidate. He may be going up against a shit sandwich but I'm not going to pretend he's not the fat free shit sandwich
Lobbying Intensifies Among V.P. Candidates as Biden‚Äôs Search Nears an End
Of course we will. We will be much safer with Biden than with the lying autocrats of Trump Pence! Losers
Hey, Doughboy! I can project the results of this fair election right now! Biden wins! And you are so afraid of losing you are trying to sow seeds of dissent and doubt. Your excuses are meaningless, Loser!
You‚Äôve lost your mind just like Biden. Trump is the only logical choice.
While I understand why Trump wants to delay the election this must not happen the Democrats will say Trump is only trying to rig the election Biden has already said Trump will try and steal the election a delay will make it seem he was right!
Truth! Vote Biden!!!
Tbh it's hard for me to say who will win. A lot of the polls are pretty close afaik and Biden unapologetically saying fuck you to leftists doesn't help
For real. I may very very reluctantly vote for Biden because the other option is far worse, but I'm not going to pretend a vomit sandwich is gourmet compared to a shit sandwich
Too many people are voting for Biden for all the wrong reasons. I can respect you if your reason is because you are (rightfully) afraid of what Trump is capable of, based on the shit that is happening in Portland and NY right now.
I made a deal with a friend. I'll vote for Biden and they'll read, "The State And Revolution" and post a report about it on their Social Media.  I bet people with an audience could leverage quite a bit more than me though.
This is a 100% sincere offer and I think all of us on the Left should be making it.   Read and report on 1 book by a Revolutionary Leftist, and I'll vote for Biden.  Read and report on a 2nd, and I'll vote blue down the ballot.  Tag me in it and you'll buy my vote.  #Read4Biden
No, I am voting for Biden.
You're a total idiot Joe Biden will never get elected you're beyond pathetic and a disgrace to decent Americans everywhere!
They must not want to protect the most important person in our country due to his attitude????  Maybe they could hold him by his arm like they have to for wannabe president  joe Biden lol

That is EXACTLY what he is doing. He wants to leave a huge mess. If by some really unfortunate fluke he won he would not have the skills to fix it. Biden will bring in a competent team that can immediately start moving in the right direction.

I remember being a young child observing the campaign of the Ronald Reagan. When Reagan was inaugurated, he was 69 years old and just under three weeks short of his 70th birthday, thus a number of voters, as well as‚Ä¶
Gaga denouncing her work with R Kelly, the rapist, but not Joe Biden, the rapist Y‚Äôall can‚Äôt even comment on artists working with predators when your fav chooses a predator for a sexual assault campaign over a woman ü•¥
I know that instead of choosing an actual woman or a survivor to work with, she chose a politician that is later revealed to be a predator If she can apologize for her work with R kelly, the rapist, she can apologize for working with joe Biden, the rapist ü•¥
It‚Äôs funny that you didn‚Äôt care about Joe Biden being in other woman‚Äôs business; literally shoving his hand down their pants It‚Äôs disgusting to try to flip that around, your parents raised you better
Joe Biden will fix that problem
I hate when people assume Biden wouldn‚Äôt run for a second term.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
If you think Joe Biden is going to pick Bass y‚Äôall are either politically inept or just wishfully thinking.
I remember that. And Biden supporters acted like we were being unreasonable for calling it out
So if she is willing to apologize and not work with the rapist R Kelly, why do you think she shouldn‚Äôt apologize for choosing rapist Joe Biden for her sexual assault psa? üßê Dont you see how that is a little tasteless? Giving people the impression he is a champion for women?ü§¢
It was in 2016, and he‚Äôs been anti woman‚Äôs right to choose since the 80s.... and he fondled children... R Kelly‚Äôs takedown was in 2019, DWUW was in 2013.... If she can denounce her work with R Kelly, she can denounce her work with Joe Biden
Worry about fadga denouncing her work with rapist R Kelly, but not rapist Joe Biden ü§¢ Karma finally hitting fadga hardüòÇ
Watch Obama be Biden's running mate.
Obama/Biden job growth:
It's true. Either way, we win.  Either Pelosi(?)or Biden will look very good in that oval office, undoing all the damage President Village Idiot has done!
I had to block Bernie at the end of his campaign when he decided to help Biden with debate questions. Their friendship was the final straw for me
You just described Joe Biden to a tee!
I‚Äôve tweeted about her fuck her too.... I think it‚Äôs hypocritical that y‚Äôall monsters come at her when Gaga literally chose a whole predator for a SEXUAL ASSAULT PSA.... What‚Äôs next? Murderers for a life campaign? ü•¥ Y‚Äôall denounced r Kelly. Where‚Äôs the same energy for joe biden?
Bb it‚Äôs your first day in class isn‚Äôt it? Maybe sit back and observe before you decide to get brave Again, any comment on why gaga chose a predator over a woman? Confined blackface? Not denouncing joe biden?? Or you gonna keep ignoring üòÇ
The fact that y‚Äôall have absolutely no defense against Gaga choosing a predator over a woman, condoning blackface, denouncing R Kelly, but not Joe Biden, so y‚Äôall just stick to getting personal üòÇ Lame
That‚Äôs not your call, Chucko!  Be careful what you ask for.  You‚Äôll be singing a different tune if Biden has majority votes that night.
2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Floats Whether to ‚ÄòDelay the Election,‚Äô Something He Cannot Legally Do
Here‚Äôs what Biden doesn‚Äôt want you to pay attention to. He suffering from dementia but his handlers keep propping him up.
This is what the media does.  If they disagree with somebody telling the truth, they try to find something in their past to discredit them. What about doctor Fauci's past? Or better yet how about Joe Biden's?
Excuse me, sir  , Mr Biden has not #MaskedUp
No, YOU are ignorant of current events.
When you look at her and Joe you get the Obama Biden vibe and that‚Äôs needed to govern with someone. Susan and Biden are close but I don‚Äôt think they have that connection.
Matt, while I like Rice a lot the last thing Biden wants is Benghazi brought up etc
So ridiculous that you cant see your own hypocrisy. Joe devestated black communities, voting for him is saying you don't care? And don't worry I'm in these streets, fighting for people "i don't care about" with a bunch of others who ain't Ridin with Biden.
Biden will still need a sec of commerce if he wins....No one knows for sure how this is going to effect the voting.  Republicans think it will siphon minority and/or young votes from Biden.  There are just as likely discouraged R voters who don't like Trump, but won't vote for a Dem.
Thighland.  Brilliant.  Hope you don‚Äôt criticize Biden anytime soon‚Äîyou‚Äôve shit the bed on live tv more in the last 2 weeks than your depends can possibly hold.
The "you can't be Catholic and support Biden" has already started, much sooner than in the 2016 election cycle.  I cannot imagine the homilies we will have to endure in the weeks leading up to November.  It will be an exhausting 88 more days.
How‚Äôs your elite friends doing? We all know you and Biden got a dinner date to discuss the next plan and scheme. Just tell the people your all a hoax, people are catching on it‚Äôs all a shit show and reality tv condensation. Give us our government back it‚Äôs obvious both sides
Tonight!  Join Dr. Myers and Indiana for Joe Biden as we talk healthcare.
Idk why joe Biden‚Äôs managers let him even speak at this point LMAO. I hope to have the overflowing confidence of old white men one day
I wish you were the Democratic nominee. I cannot in good conscious vote for Trump or Biden. This may be the first year I won‚Äôt vote. I don‚Äôt feel I have a good choice from either party.
Yes Dan, unlike your Satan Worshipping Messiah, Biden is still very much Moderate. The problem with the GOP is, you‚Äôve traded in your allegiance to Lincoln, in exchange for an Ouija Board for your Faith. Look at Falwell as an example. Good pic with his pants unzipped, wasn‚Äôt it?
Don't worry you've sicked Kanye on them. Joe will certainly never get a single black vote now right????  After all, you've done more for black people than anyone, right? and Joe Biden isn't Catholic, right? And Covid has disappeared, right? And the new health care plan is out?
"After yesterday's edited version of his statement, Sleepy Joe Biden is no longer worthy of the Black Vote"
Ye getting weaponized as a GOP pawn to ticket split Biden is I guess where we‚Äôre at in 2020.
Joe Biden is really out here trying to compete with George Washington for lowest total black vote
Every time Repubes post about ‚Äúthat Biden video was *hard to watch*‚Äù I wonder to myself if they think it‚Äôs hard to watch the President ignore Russian bounties, or rail on about water pressure, or say Biden will ‚Äúhurt the Bible, hurt God‚Äù? You think this shit is *easy to watch*?
Yeah... lowering the age for Medicare to 60 and strengthening private insurance via ACA is totally halfway to single payer M4A...   Giving the police $300 million is totally halfway to defunding them...  What about Biden's policies makes you think he's met us "halfway?"
This was a just sad.
Joe Biden is a puppet. Let the man grieve over the loss of his family. He has yet to do that! He does not have the mental capacity to run a country. Let‚Äôs keep the current president he‚Äôs doing a fine job!

I mean holy shit , could you imagine if the orange man said this ?????? I mean I think Biden doesn‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs at most of the time but the dude is flat out saying racist nonsense now!!! Bye Joe!
Actual picture of Biden hurting god. Lol
I mean, if Joe Biden is THAT powerful do you want to risk voting against him? #BidenDiety
I work as a nurse with the disabled population. Our dsp workers are angels on earth. #whyillvote biden
This was just a segment on MTP daily. Some Republicans in Ohio telling Biden who he has to pick for him to win his vote. I started laughing.  People who will vote for Trump anyway.
So the guy who cheated on 3 wives, hundreds of times, holds a Bible upside down because he‚Äôs never opened one, and commits extortion and Launders Money more often than normal people drink water, is telling us that Biden is Godless? Enjoy Hell Donnie.
Sorry but any vote not used or not used for Joe Biden is a Trump vote. So you have to ask yourself, is any one VP pick WORSE than 150k+ dead Americans?  I'd be interested in your response.
This man just claimed Joe Biden isn't a Christian. How long do you think God will stand for that without having something to say in it?
Watching Trump and Biden video clips on this here free website and thinking: "This ain't the best we can do...but this IS America."  phew.
p sure jon was actually asking for input and perspectives instead of asking a rhetorical question, which i think is how you took it lol. but ur answer was pretty insightful into biden's background for those who didn't know
CNN: Instagram's algorithm blocked negative coverage of Trump, but not Biden.   via
Its time MAGA's. Your President just called Joe Biden "a hurter of the Bible and a man who hates God". You claim to be Christians. What do you do next?  I know what the Bible says you must do.  Do you?  I hope so!!! Your eternity depends on it!!!  Choose wisely.
Keep on judging people like you are, calling Joe Biden godless, and God will want to speak with you really quickly. I know you are unfamiliar with the Bible, but judging is God's to do, not yours. God will not be mocked.  Keep it up at your eternitys risk. Money is useless to God
He keeps playing around like this and God will talk with him immediately.  He will not like the outcome, guaranteed. Jesus makes it clear we are not to judge others. Here is the President calling Joe Biden "against God" Every true Christian RIGHT NOW must walk away from Trump.
As an atheist, the small, petty god Donald Trump appears to worship makes no fucking sense. Omnipotent, but apparently able to be outsmarted by Joe Biden.
As my wife,  , says - who needs Babylon Bee when you‚Äôve got Joe Biden?
Biden seems to make a racist comment every other day ...
I'm with you on this one. I am willing to bet Biden wont be the nominee.
This weekend, I‚Äôll be virtually surrounded by  volunteer leaders from around the country.  But on Sunday, when  drops by, you can join me!
More conservatives for Biden!
Lmao I haven‚Äôt seen one Bernie supporter volunteering or campaigning for Biden. As far as I know he‚Äôs still a rapist that I‚Äôll never to vote for.
I pray President Trump is re-elected! Trump/Pence are better equipped to lead our nation than Joe Biden and any of his potential VP picks.
Wait you must have read wrong . I‚Äôm voting for Biden not trump #pedophiletrump
I agree that it is pointless to hold these debates. However, if Biden backs out, the Republicans will use that- saying he‚Äôs too scared. It‚Äôs not worth the possible loss of votes from people who will believe it. (See this thread)
He certainly convinces me to vote for Joe Biden more and more pretty much every time he opens his mouth. I hope he never shuts up until 11/03/2020 and then he can just magically go away forever.
Sir, would you please consider giving a speech at the same exact time as the Republican National Convention? Make it a pay per view and the money can go to any charity of your choosing. You would make so many of us who support Joe Biden so happy in these hard times.
Ryan:  Did you get a Biden sign?   or at least a Pete for Joe 2020?

I hope so!  I need to think positively.  Biden is light years ahead of Trump in abilities!
Biden is a gifted orator, no doubt.
These are biden voters. Vote green
The more he flaps his gums about ignorant crap, the less Joe Biden ever has to say. This is the best kinds of opponent - the kind whose cannot shut up and beats themselves. This narcissist will NEVER shut up, and thank goodness for that. #Biden2020Landslide
Keep talking! I love to see Biden's leads increase with every ignorant word you utter.  "Yo! Semite!! Keep up the chatter!"
Is he still talking? Isn't it time for his "trout fishing" trip?  Oh well as long as he and Trump and McConnell keep saying idiotic things daily, Biden never even has to hold a rally. They are winning for him.
They threw their full support behind Trump.  Tells you all you need to know.  Biden will have to rebuild them from the ground up.
We can‚Äôt just build back to the way things were before these crises. We have to build a more inclusive, equitable future for all. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll do it:
Most establishment media polls show President Trump trailing in a matchup with Joe Biden, but a closer look at the data shows that most of these polls may be built simply to discourage conservative voters from showing up.   History repeats itself.
Twitter seems to have deleted the Biden video
Agree. Biden can misspeak and makes gaffes and the GOP will have a heyday with it.  Nothing to gain; he‚Äôs polling well.  Trump probably doesn‚Äôt want to debate but he‚Äôs a  bully and moderators don‚Äôt moderate properly.  They should mute for interrupting and going over time limit.
Biden.. if I have to walk through glass
Biden would also be just a puppet.
üòÑ after reading the text I thought it was of Biden.
Kayleigh‚Äôs right. No one could have handled the virus the way Trump has...That‚Äôs why Biden is going to win.
I want to see Biden stand up to Trump in a way Hillary did not, as well as make it obvious just how stupid Trump really is.
Biden could go on vacation until 11/03 as long as DOnald Trump keeps talking. He is the "bigliest" support of Biden there is. Idiot Trump said today that he;s done more for Black People than anyone but Lincoln!!! Why would you ever debate a lunatic like that??
New Merch. Biden Logo (5' x 3' Nylon Flag) - Team Joe Store
Why bother to to hold rallys or debates when your opponent tanks himself daily just by trying to do an interview. Have you seen those poll numbers? They get better for Biden daily and he never even has to speak. That's "bigly" amazing. Covfefee indeed!!
I'll take that bet and risk my eternity on it.  Let's see whose right. I'm a Christian Pastor and Joe Biden is getting my vote. Since you just judged millions of people, I wish you well in trying to explain that away to God when you see Him face to face. Thoughts and prayers.
Biden agreed to debates in June...  but keep working hard at the smear while your boss can‚Äôt pronounce our most famous National Park.

I will stick by my stance that Biden should not do debates. Trump is unstable, thats already been proven, so whats to gain? The media wants them to make both men look bad - thats their job. Trump makes himself look idiotic every day. Joe should sit them out. Just my opinion.
Just a reminder - The Police Union Head put the unions FULL BACKING behind Donald Trump.  This will be "just another day" for them going forward until Biden takes over.
you must be nervous. lol. all the Biden bashing this morning....
Biden 2020: I won‚Äôt deny that math exists.
We are still working for a revolution. Biden is no better than trump, not one of these 10 doesnt apply to both of them
More than half fit biden.. all do
Aaaand they all also fit for biden. Welp still voting green
Amen. Thank you for your reminder to those flipping out. Every minute Biden waits to announce is another minute Trump and the a Republicans cannot attack whomever he picks.
I totally get what you are saying, but this is not normal, we must not put down biden, we need to back him as our life depends on it. We will kick his ass out of office if he sucks. We can do that, but we can't do anything if Trump gets 4 more years. Please no repeat of 2016!!
Awesome, I‚Äôll be there this Sunday for Biden‚Äôs Signs Across America relay event.
I'm voting for biden even if he's not doing everything we want, we can't have trump, let's not turn people off from voting for Joe please. We will have democrats making the changes he will be just fine compared to doofus Donnie!

Because he knows he cannot beat Biden outright. McConnell sent up the warning flares over the weekend for Republicans to begin slowly pulling away, but that's too late as well. The USS Trumptanic is sinking.  They will be a horrific memory come 11/03/2020.
There‚Äôs 0 benefit to the socialist Dems to debate because they know that Biden will be exposed for the blithering dementia case that he is. There is no way we should have a nominee that is protected and shielded from the American public. If he cannot debate he should be omitted
‚Äúat what point do you educate your self‚Äù. That‚Äôs a fair question for you to ask yourself.  You going Biden?  The guy who supports abortion on demand and would cave to the left that wants it up to and even after birth?  That‚Äôs your party?
He‚Äôs giving Biden plenty of opportunities to say ‚Äòno‚Äô. Why?
Ill vote. Neither biden nor trump is worth my vote though.
He would better than Biden, maybe even his dad. Apparently the kid is brilliant and knows several coding languages.
Just tell them you are here illegally and you need it so you can vote for Biden.  They will probably deliver it to you.
Biden is equally as bad. Fascism isnt just trump, its the US. And its the US that both trump and biden are fighting for. Ill fight against them both.
Actually, the card board cut out would do better than Joe Biden.
We all know. Trump will crucify Biden.
Trump is in no shape to stalk behind Biden like he did Hillary.  He would fall over.  Plus when he gets pissed he cannot just walk off like he does his pressers. It will be a total disaster for Trump - and I can;t wait to watch!!!
Biden is a puppet for the radical left.   Biden will increase taxes by trillions of dollars, reduce funding of the Police Departments across the US, give amnesty to 11 million illegals &amp; will destroy the middle class in America.  Solution-Vote for President Trump!
I think its cute that his ego is telling him that he's running against Obama and not Biden.  Those trips to Walter Reed will ratchet up soon me thinks.
Oh yes he does. And it has been a sheer joy watching him squirm and realize his time is running out. He says he plans on blocking everything when Biden wins, but he will no longer be in the majority so he will get to lay in the bed he shit in for all these years.
Attacking Obama and not Biden - the man he‚Äôs running against - because he‚Äôs a racist and white supremicist
Two awesome people.  BTW PFA people are meeting up in SB next Sunday to launch the Signs for Biden Across America campaign.
And Biden leads by 5 full points in Florida and trending to gain more.  But polls dont win elections, votes do!! Please send in mail votes as quickly as you can and prepare for huge lines on election day.
check our  we've got a sign program going in. Also we are looking for places to out up BIG BIDEN wooden signs and banners.  So yes, looking for locations and driving is a great way to help.
Name one thing that Biden has actually done for this country to make it a better place. Cannot wait to hear your reply
Yep and he shut down China coming into the country and was called a racist and xenophobic from Hiden Biden.
#TrumpIsLosing I just came to say... #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica #Biden #ImVoting4BidenBecause  is better than Donald.
Absolute truth. Biden would be removed from presidency within months. He‚Äôs just their safest bet to get votes.
We are supposed to think about phone banking, text banking, donating, lit dropping, postcard writing for Biden and the Dems down ballot, that‚Äôs whatüòÄ
Because followers of narcissists do what their master does and that is "project". They know they are followers so thats what they call others. Don;t Trump calls Joe Biden "Sleepy" because thats all he does. When they call you something they are telling you that is what they are.
....Or joe Biden debate President Trump! ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Did you read about Bass and Scientology, Castro? Biden needs to pick wisely!! Someone we trust who is strong that is well-vetted because trump will capitalize on their weaknesses!!
It's the other way around. Trump would never have debated biden if trump were winning in the polls. Any debate they have now, Biden will have so many lies to call out it will be awesome.
We need ppl like you and biden in lines for the guillotines
By the way. Never said im not voting, just that both trump and biden are not getting mine.
He has to act right now. Time is running out to work up a plan and all the media that goes with it. Russia has nothing on Biden or else they would have presented it. If they do present something from USSR then Nunes is in deep shit for not saying so when he was asked. Catch 22.
Read this article, Bass can not be Biden‚Äôs running mate. It makes me sick thinking about what a catastrophe she would be!
News about Greenfield Central student positive #COVID19 case makes national news üòê. Story right before who Biden will pick for VP.
We will relive this moment again on 11/03/2020 when Joe Biden embarrasses Trump. America will once again be the land of the free and not the land of narcissistic synophancy.
Biden is a weakness, not just foreign policy. We would be considered weak again.
I agree with  that these won't be debates, it will be the liar in chief making shit up and Biden having to stay in the real world  . These will be a joke.
So   started " Believers for Biden" then in a speech "accidentally" makes a call to Moslems to Jihad ! This is truely Disturbing ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è
Trump ignored the Obama/ Biden playbook on how to handle a pandemic.  And there is still no federal response
Well Trump just lost the youth vote... Middle schoolers will be voting Biden in #2020Election
We need to remember that the Head of the Police Union threw their full backing behind Trump. This is because they know that Biden is going to totally reform policing as we know it and they do not want it to change.
He's lost Florida with the help of DeathSantis.  This is huge for Biden.  If the Texas numbers keep getting worse for him, we will be able to call the election very quickly on 11/03/2020.  #Biden2020Landslide

Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
Also they just said he was pulling his ad buying to change their message.  "Sleepy Joe" has been his lame message since the start. He has been afraid of Biden or else he would never have asked for help beating Joe. #TrumpHasLost
Hmmm...your losing in Texas and Florida as well. Sleepy Joe is very a old and tired cliche. You need something with more relevance.  Something like "Joe Biden would never tear gas your Mom like I will" That shows Americans your toughness.
Joe Biden is expected to announce his running mate next week; all of the perceived frontrunners are pro-abortion &amp; support the LGBT agenda.  Given Biden's issues with mental fitness, his VP choice is likely to take over at some point, should he win.
Yes and he must walk through a two columns of people - Black Lives Matter Protesters on the left and Moms and Veterans whom he gassed on the right - on his way to the police van. Biden and Obama get to shut the doors on the vehicle - and America returns to her greatness.
As a (Black) suburban mother, I knew exactly what that coded language meant. He was saying if Biden is elected, the Black folk are moving to the suburbs(OMG!). Dude, we‚Äôre already here and we love it!
You WILL know like 4 hours after the polls open. Biden with 85% of the electoral college locked up. That leaves no way to protest the results. Have no fear, the Blue Wave is poised to roll tide on November 3rd, voter suppression or no, it wont matter.
The newspapers in the state that he Governs has to beg him for help - and he loves and cherishes every second of that because to him, that makes him powerful.  He's nothing but a spineless, sycophant, small-minded Trump follower who, once Biden takes office will not last long.
If Trump pounded a much better candidate and had no record the first time, his defeat of Biden will be epic.
If Biden doesn‚Äôt want to move further left when he needs our votes the most, how are we gonna get him to even consider fighting for M4A, green new deal or any other progressive policies when he‚Äôs in office already? Please enlighten me..
I don‚Äôt know.  It‚Äôs 50/50.  Biden isn‚Äôt hated the way Hillary is.  If Biden avoids public speaking and debates, he just might win.
I have a daughter named Jayme. I‚Äôve thought about you constantly since the shooting because of this. Joe Biden has personal experience with the kind of pain you‚Äôve suffered.I love my kids with all my heart.I can‚Äôt begin to understand because I‚Äôve never lost one. I‚Äôm with Joe, too
Plus, some of the age/oratory jokes (while still in poor taste) might actually *land* if Biden‚Äôs opponent were, in contrast, cogent and able to descend a ramp.
Just saw an email about Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren having a fundraiser tomorrow, on the day that he's scheduled to make his VP pick. Hmmm
My history of Presidential voting:   2000:George Bush 2004:George Bush 2008:Ron Paul 2012:Gary Johnson 2016:Gary Johnson 20220: Joe Biden   Weird evolution that probably isn't that uncommon.
Another way to avoid unwanted hair is to avoid being a waitress for Dodd and Kennedy.
Pro-abortion groups have endorsed Joe Biden because his support for abortion is "compassionate."   How have we come to a place where abortion is defined as "compassionate‚Äù?
Seems like today would be a good day for future president Biden to announce his VP. Take back the narrative and assure us all Nov. 3rd the trump nightmare is over.#NobodyLikesTrump
There you have it, folks! He tried extortion, suppression, and every other ‚ÄúShell Game Parlor Trick to rig this election. Now he‚Äôs flat out saying, STOP the election, because I can‚Äôt beat Biden 1 on 1.
By "looking pretty good" she means that its pretty clear Joe Biden is going to walk all over Trump on 11/03/.2020 without any delays in the election. She and her siccophant, mindless, spineless followers all become irrelevant on 11/03/2020 and not a day later!  Buh-bye Laura!!!
Lowkey super fucked up that a president wants to delay being voted out. I think biden will win bc all my conservative family members seem to be on board but to me hes just as bad, we truly need revolution

This one is easy. He is no longer president. Biden is and Biden then assumes military control just as Trump has. So Biden, smiling all the way, simply orders the military to throw him out. Any officer not following that order is guilty of treason. Period. This is a non-issue
On top of ensuring Texas forgives all taxes for Elon Musk to build his new plants in Texas. Yet, he's STILL behind in polls in Texas according to CNN and Reuters. And Biden and Lincoln Projects ads start hitting there soon. #Biden2020
Isn‚Äôt the point that the Federal Government shouldn‚Äôt dictate local zoning against the wishes of a state or city?    IE. the Biden/Sanders/Booker plan to start enforcing Obama‚Äôs Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing initiative.

Harris is not going to help get the black vote because, to quote Biden, 'you aint that black!'
Listen to the scientific evidence. Biden is lucid and in a daydream of dementia.
Best neighbors I could ever have: Hispanic, Korean, Slovakian, Chinese, Black, White, Indian, Irish, and more. All awesome  AMERICAN Neighbors! YOU DO NOT REPRESENT ME! YOUR ‚Äúnews‚Äù disgusts me! YES I‚ÄôM VOTING FOR BIDEN!
What are the odds that lady is voting Joe Biden?
Biden has dementia, his shuffling walk, confused speech, someone constantly leading him or telling him what to say. This is the Democrat candidate for the Presidency! They‚Äôre all looney!
Yes Donnie, keep it up. The more you push, the lower your polling numbers go. Americans love your plan and will show up in droves to vote - for Joe Biden.
Police protecting human life is not Biden‚Äôs focusYes it was! Biden grew because of Obama!
Amen! We need to swear Biden on the 5th! Put him to work an hour later! We can party when we can breathe a sigh of relief!

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has an 11-point lead over Republican President Donald Trump in Michigan, a new poll found.

The Demarats had 1 fucking job and they gave you sleepy kid touching and sniffing joe Biden and hes a real fucking racist look at his last few interviews but yall still back this dementia riddled fool ok yall must like Jeffrey Epstein and the Clintons   smfh TDS is strong #Pedos
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said, ‚ÄúI like Kanye very much‚Äù but added: ‚ÄúI have nothing to do with him being on the ballot. I‚Äôm not involved.‚Äù
What about "Yo Semites," they should probably vote for Biden too
Using my simulation, which doesn't assume the poll results are the most likely vote result in states, but simply indicating a trend, my most likely result shows to be  Biden 320 Trump 218

There‚Äôs a reason why Biden wasn‚Äôt many of our picks during the primary and I think this is a shining example of that.
Lol I'm not some Biden supporter dude. How many of these people contracted the coronavirus from this?  Natural Selection still applies to Humans.
I'd be a little more worked up about the lack of a Trump/Biden debate if the presidential "debates" didn't consist entirely of shit any fool could Google during a commercial break.
If Biden or his son committed crimes they should be charged.  If Trump or his family committed crimes they should be charged too.  We need new leadership. PERIOD. I think they're all corrupt and self-dealing. Why are all politicans rich? Think about it...
I don't want Biden either.. But  has lost his mind. We need a new president, sorry.
Even for a president known for his blunt criticism, Trump's remarks stood out and they signaled how contentious the campaign may get over the coming months.
Thirdly, you put this into context of things Biden has said about Black people loving him and supporting him as if he has our support and vote locked down and it is disturbing.  Are we a monolith to him? Does he take our vote for granted in the same way as he does our diversity?
Biden every time he talks
Biden every time he talks
Let's start by the fact that it was wrong and, at best in very poor taste, for Biden to think it was necessary to bring Black people or the AA community up at all as a comparison point for diversity?  Like why? What is the damn purpose of that?
President Trump at the podium: On my map, and you know there is no one who has a better map than me. It shows me that Bangcock is the capital of Thighland. This was on the cognitive test I passed, very easy test. Joe Biden couldn't pass it. Me: I bet he can pronounce Thailand!
Did the both of you come here to defend Biden's comment (which  I made no reference to in my tweet)?
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúLeague 46 and LGBTQ+ for Biden: An Out for Biden Event feat. Dr. Jill Biden and Chasten Buttigieg‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
And I would also credit Biden with being receptive to those arguments because of his desire to welcome other wings of the party. But again I come back to the difference between political pressure and divisive rancor. One is constructive, the other is not.
How about that new racist Biden interview
"You ain't black." "Are you a junkie?" Black Americans have no diversity of thought.  All Joe Biden statements in past 3 months that would have been labeled horrendously racist if Trump said them.
Let's not forget Biden looking at a black journalist and asking if he was a junkie this week for asking a legitimate question.
Joe Biden out for a leisurely drive...
Yes, it is real.   "Biden made the remark during an interview hosted by the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and the National Association of Black Journalists."  - Politico

He still got my vote!  Sean, the more you a d Fox mention Joe Biden, the more popular he becomes! That's right, keep his name in the spotlight!

Ah yes, I can see it now, the heavens trembling when Joe Biden is elected in November. Because ‚Äúformidable‚Äù has to be the first word I would use to describe 77 year old Joe Biden...
Whether you want Trump for president or not, Biden's statement is unquestionably racist and should disqualify him from the presidency.
If you haven't lost the entire Nation from all the dumb shit you say on a daily basis, Joe Biden definitely has nothing to worry about!
I'm black, he has lost my vote! Frankly, I don't give a damn what he said, because even if I didn't vote for Biden, I'm certainly not voting for Trump!  To me! Joe Biden is a black man in a white man's body!
Joe Biden wins.
If to not vote for Trump but also eschew Biden is a personal aesthetic choice it might make sense. But to reject Trump as unfit to govern, and not vote for Biden, is ‚Äúnonsensical.‚Äù
Buuuuuut the black community basically handed the primary to Biden in SC, so...
That's not really what I'm talking about but I understand what you're saying too. I don't think anyone has treated Biden with kid gloves. Pressure is totally fine and part of the process. Division is the concern three months out.
Easy  Biden &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 45 Harris or Rice &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pence
I‚Äôm proud to say, I‚Äôm informed enough, which is to say I know ridiculous, right wing propaganda when I see it, to avoid this embarrassing group. #Biden #NeverTrump
Biden serious about picking Susan Rice? Given that her son is a high key Trump supporter?
These questions seem based on the notion that somehow Trump will perform well at the debates. He won't. He was terrible in the debates against Hillary. At worst, the debates will be a wash for Biden and won't affect the horserace.
Go right ahead. Biden will bury you in five minutes.
OBE WAN JOE BiDEN, IS OUR ONLY HOPE.......BEAUTIFUL.
That will end badly for Biden
So.... absolutely NO concession made here by Biden for progressives. He‚Äôs just going to plow ahead with either a cop or a war hawk.

So... You said that 4 years ago... And.. Not so Great.  I'm not voting for you and I'm not voting for Biden. Good Luck!

And THAT'S why Trump will win again. Because it's about him even when nobody was talking about him. Joe was saying they're hiding Biden (correct) and he's in a significant mental decline (also correct) and instead of arguing that point the response is what about Trump
So far all the folks dreading Biden and/or his pick for VP, who are voting for?
Meaning, you can't possibly win without Florida, and Joe Biden is still leading you there by several points.

This is going to be the scariest election ever. America is literally black vs. white AGAIN. If trump wins, it will be the BLM/anti trumper riots. If Biden wins it‚Äôs going to be the white supremacists rioting because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what BLM did over George Floyd‚Äù. It‚Äôs going to be war.üòî
Note that this was also in this same op-ed: ‚ÄúBiden accused the president of trying to make it harder for people to vote by mail by defunding or otherwise hindering the Postal Service‚Äôs operations. There‚Äôs absolutely no proof Trump wants to do that, but that didn‚Äôt stop Biden.‚Äù
That‚Äôs true! If Biden wins, they will riot a bit! Until somebody riots back! Then it‚Äôs back to yellow flags with snakes on them!
I have no idea why people in major cities and on the coast are so sure Biden will win. I'm in Michigan/Indiana, and it is looking like Trump voters have sheer excitement to vote. Meanwhile anyone formerly a Democrat is like "meh" the DNC F***ed us again.

Hillary was right across the board.  I voted for her and I'll vote for Joe Biden. Time to take back this country.
Black people who don't vote for Biden are useless? That's what you mean?
Right? I understand the media has an agenda too. I make my own decisions. Which is why I didn't vote for Clinton. I don't like Biden either but he is the lesser of the two evils.  Trump will be a 1 term president and so will Biden.
Kamala Harris is going to be President Joe Biden's Attorney General. Then she is going to prosecute  Trump's Attorney General William Barr, and you and Trump $ company!

As  explains well in this AQ Podcast, the current unilateral sanctions regime has failed Venezuela.  Sanctions policy needs to be rethought to adequately protect vulnerable Venezuelans and create effective incentives for democratization.Something is wrong when white folks refuse to embrace diversity. I thank God for Black Lives Matter, they will help to elect Joe Biden.
Biden will enable us to become a full blown plutocracy. Trump is trying the same thing, but Trump is also causing civil unrest, which I believe is what will save our future. A Biden victory will usher in complacency and leftism will lose all it's momentum.
Reason I won't vote for him. This isn't about purity tests, I genuinely believe Biden will do permanent irreversible damage to leftism in this country. If he wins a dystopian future is almost a guarantee.
No it's not because I organize and put in work at a local level and actively participate in every election I can. The general election doesn't weigh my conscience as a leftist. Based on what he's promised, Biden will do the most long term damage to minority groups, that's the #1

Right now it's Short Term Damage (Trump) vs Long Term Damage (Biden) vs not playing into a system that was never designed to give you a voice in the first place. I know my choice.
Option 3, Trump wins and in 4 years the Dems can give us a worthy candidate rather than waste another 8 years begging for scraps. I'll be writing in. Best case scenario with Biden still permanently fucks us in the long term.
I don't think Biden is going to make anything better, he's gonna trap us in for another 8 years of no change. Trump we can knock out in just 4 years.
you better deploy and start using your 2nd amendment and the so many riffles, so sad to have so much ammunition and loose POTUS, to a biden, onama, diblassio, schummer, etc etc
I will make a deal. I will pull my vote from Biden until he taxes a test if you fully release Trumps Tax returns from 2015 on. You do that I will demand the person I am voting for to take this test. Deal?
They're not saying you're voting for Trump. They're saying you won't vote for Biden over Trump.
We can only hope that Biden remembers what happened to McCain once he made his Veep choice.
I think the public knows most than enough to judge Trump's character and leadership competence.  He's been on TV forever.  Similarly, all I want to hear from Biden is who will replace him in a year or two, and what few concessions to progressives he might make.
Did Biden denounce anyone burning the bible? NO!  Trump did!  Trump is no angel, and we didn't hire an angel or a man of the cloth. We hired a man who will defend us against our enemies, and will bear the burden for the lost lives of our soldiers and the lives of the enemy.

Depends on definition of "Mostly Socialist" System, need to see specific questions. I would say the breakdown represents the % of Liberals in the Democrat Party by age group. Liberal meaning Bernie ideology or more radical Liberal. Remainder will vote Biden &amp; some Trump haters.

Biden had the chance when he was in office, for the last 40 years.
What‚Äôs the theory?  If Biden wins I‚Äôm guessing 2 week Mask Mandate then they just quit reporting it and push to put Trump in jail for all the deaths. I think Trump still wins 45 states and this isn‚Äôt even close.
No matter how Democrats and Media want to spin it, why won't Biden take a cognitive test?
Part I of Biden's plan according to his own website "Give every American access to affordable healthcare." Until he proposes free healthcare for everyone he can fuck off to the moon. I won't be voting for him and neither will my nuclear family as they just mirror my votes.
if he wins he will be declared unfit to serve because of Alzheimer‚Äôs. Then the same scenario will happen as I stated above. People need to wake up, this election is not about Biden. It‚Äôs about 2 black women as President/VP. Just my thoughts on the election.
I heard you talking about Biden &amp; his inability to put a coherent sentence together. I wish you all would talk about the fact that Joe will never run the country. For the Dems it‚Äôs all about putting the first black woman in the presidential seat by default.

Biden's a dumba$$ ... He couldn't file his own taxes, if he filed single, made $50,000 from one employer, and had no deductions. Simple ... it's the difference between the taxes you were required to pay, and the taxes you actually paid. You either get a refund, or you owe.
Democrats are creating chaos at every turn. President Trump has been consistent since elected. Don't be sour your candidate was horrible. She was the worst candidate in history, but be thankful. She's now second worst, Biden has taken first place. Nice try at spin Mr. Red Shoes.
That should read "Former Vice President" Joe Biden. Pence is the Vice President, not stumbling creepy sleepy Joe.

Susan Rice is a poor judge of character, if she thinks that China can be trusted with anything other than buying American products. A possible choice as Biden's running mate ... She's clueless, along with the Democrat party!
This gives President Trump the win. Democrats have zero platform, zero implementable ideas, zero candidate. The only reason low information people will vote Joe Biden is because the legacy media has succeeded at making the dummies hate President Trump for no reason.
Democrats are terrified Biden will have to speak without handlers and a teleprompter. He can't. Everyone knows it.
What do you mean you saw no Biden Supporters.  I had a Sign that was like this.  Listened to all the hate spewed by your educationally deficient cult that was there.  And literally there was 50 people to greet you MAX.

Dreams.
I don't see Biden making that clear, or denouncing other Democrats who insist on Defunding Police ... Dems always claim that Trump doesn't take a leadership role, and Biden is definitely NOT taking a leadership role on the issue of Defund the Police!
It‚Äôs abundantly clear that Biden doesn‚Äôt run his own Twitter account. You should try to find someone who is almost as incoherent as he is to Tweet for him; that way it‚Äôs at least somewhat believable
Sounds like you talking about the police union. STOP SPREADING FALSE PROPAGANDA COLLUDIE. REPENT AND JOIN TRUMPERS FOR BIDEN TEAM.
RESIGN NOW AND STOP SPREADING FALSE PROPAGANDA. Repent and JB will accept you with open arms. Come join the TRUMPERS FOR BIDEN TEAM. Win win PEEPSQUEAK
Trump supporters are probably being mean because you propped yourself as a pro Trump guy for months, probably to get likes, and then you drop the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting Biden‚Äù bombshell. What did you expect?  Don‚Äôt be so weak minded to even contemplate suicide. Be better than that
We don‚Äôt even know who ‚ÄúYou‚Äù are. We all know good and damn well Biden isn‚Äôt tweeting. He can‚Äôt speak in complete sentences. He sure as hell can‚Äôt type
My prediction: 1. Biden will be a removed before the election. The female VP will be the presidential candidate, she will choose a female VP.  2. If Biden is elected he will be removed via health issues or some other means. VP will become President &amp; she will choose a female VP.
If Biden doesn‚Äôt tap you for a cabinet position won‚Äôt you please run for Governor. We need you!
247 people watching Bidens live stream. There is no way the actual number of people who will vote for him is this high. If a pollster asked me who I was voting for I'd say Biden just because I don't want my life ruined by Democrats. But I would vote Trump on election day.
But the legacy media told me Biden was trouncing President Trump! üôÑ 2020 is going to be 2016 all over again but with bigger tears and more hysterical reactions
Is the truth. WEAR A DAMNNN MASK AND help with slowing the spread. We have this pandemic because people like you REFUSE TO WEAR A MASK üò∑. Stop üõë spreading false propaganda. REPENT NOW AND BIDEN WILL ACCEPT YOU with open arms.

Top energy expert says Biden's $2-trillion energy policy doesn't make any sense, except that Biden and his Democrat buddies will get filthy rich!
Biden ... Hid'n in the basement ... Sleepy Joe ... Creep Joe! They all ring true!
Exactly ... If Biden has the solution to beating the pandemic, let's hear it! So, he'd rather see Americans suffer, than make it appear that he helped Trump. Biden needs to go back to sleep, he has no constructive criticism! It's full of BS!
Trojan horse used to sneak soldiers in Biden dems coming strait at you calling your lies you know like non cowards do they don't wait till your gone and bad mouth ya waaawaaawaa mommy she couldn't stand ya either lying pos
I don't think it was Obama and Biden personally. USA has long history of not prosecuting the President for crimes commited as sitting POTUS after they leave office. Watch though, that tradition will change in 2025 when President Trump leaves office.

He puts the thoughts that have been swirling inside my head into beautiful paragraphs. This is true of the Biden/Trump race, as well. Biden was not my first pick, but he's the only choice if we are to build a better democracy down the road.
So is  working with Russia to denigrate Joe Biden?  traitorous pos
If you have to, would you wait in an 8 hour line to vote Biden in, to get Trump out?
Biden could literally pick an old broken table as a VP and I‚Äôd still vote for him before I‚Äôd ever vote for you
According to   everyone can attack Trump 24/7 BUT, Biden must be defended by MSN at ALL times. They know he is the weekest candidate ever and CANT defend himself.
At least Biden is not a traitor!

Does Joe Biden think picking a black woman for a running mate will excuse his deep seated racism ?
At the risk of slipping into ‚Äúwhataboutism,‚Äù this is nothing compared to Trump‚Äôs China attacks on Biden.  No, this isn‚Äôt racist.  You boys should grow up.
#Laughable if you are stupid enough to vote for Kanye West - you deserve 4 more years of trump - guy can‚Äôt even afford to make a record on his own without crowdsourcing, he‚Äôs mentally ill and quite an asshole
Joe Biden's trying to coverup his racism once again.
Quite frankly Trump is a raving lunatic + the antichrist. His cult is incapable of seeing through his deceptions and lies. In fact, the more you point out how evil Trump is, the more his cult defends him. They will tell you Biden is pro abortion while Trump has paid for abortions
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ....more like the puppet master was supposed to pick a VP this week. Joe Biden can‚Äôt find his pants without help.
Your model country with Koe Biden as president
Biden is for abortion rights but not other individual freedoms.
If Biden ends up being as terrible as Trump, I‚Äôll vote against him in 2024... Trump has had his shot and failed!
BOOM!!! THERE IT IS!!!!!!üòä  History professor who has accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Trump will lose
Oh yeah he was getting black people to come out against trump for sure. Nothing is worse than Trump is the truth and that‚Äôs why Biden‚Äôs just gonna win by doing nothing. It‚Äôs been his strategy since the end of the primary. It‚Äôs hilarious Trump can‚Äôt beat someone not campaigning
If you genuinely had a problem with Trump because of that, you should then have an issue with the DNC basically coercing an entire community to vote for them.  So yes, let them vote for who they want, even if it‚Äôs Joe ‚ÄúAll Black People are the same‚Äù Biden.
So is Biden. C'mon man!
Looks like brain dead Biden is gonna get more votes off just not talking bc hiding in the basement is a better strategy than being a blatant idiot publicly
"Personal drive, strongly held convictions and sharp political instincts are critical qualities for anyone who wants to pursue a transformative role in American politics. They also render women instantly suspect in the American popular imagination"
Send that memo to Hunter Biden, will you?
I like what you guys are doing and want Trump gone, but let‚Äôs quit bringing religion into US politics. No place for it. I understand Trump brought it up with his dumb comments about Biden, but those don‚Äôt have to be addressed with affirmation of Biden being ‚Äúa devout Catholic.‚Äù
Jory, I love and respect you, but South Carolina turned out en masse for Biden, with little to no help from the Democratic establishment, which turned the tides. Most voters aren‚Äôt dupes. I voted Bernie in 2016 but was not planning to do so again this year, like many others.
Well the Black Man shouldn't have asked Biden if he had taken a cognitive test; White males lead in mental illness's; so it goes both ways. Hispanics come in all races Blacks DON'T, Hispanics vote especially Cubans vote conservative, Blacks 90% vote the same. These are FACTS.
Trump Tries To Portray Joe Biden As A Racist | Morning Joe | MSNBC  via
I disagree with you. Biden wants Trade schools and accelerated programs for trade licenses,STEM schools and standardized testing doesn't work and isn't reliable studies have shown. My ACT score was 14 and I have a Masters Degree. If they went by my test scores i'd be screwed lol
To be fair, Abraham Lincoln would probably approve of Biden‚Äôs recent comments.
I love that my phone allowed me to type ‚ÄúBudens‚Äù and not ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs.‚Äù
I think Biden gained it lol Trump calling it a BLACK vote lost me .
Really? This is sad at this point. Biden isn't president yet. Trump is and he has failed miserably. When Obama and biden were in office we had threats like this. Which were nipped in the bud due to government oversight
On top of that Hispanics come in all races, again speaking to the kind of diversity Biden was articulating.
When Biden said "With notable exceptions",  That's clear to me that he acknowledged that there is diversity in the African American Community it's just not as diverse as Latino voters who are different races and nationalities  .
Wait! Did you just say Trump has facts to prove Biden hates God + wants to take God from you? You mean the sinner who rarely ever goes to church and who never repents but instead plays golf is going to say that a man who prays to God every Sunday hates God? Go back to hell Bekee
Well if they say he didn't, then someone should tell the Biden campaign because one of his staffers tweeted out some half ass attempt at damage cntrl...I mean 'apology' about the remarks.
And Joe Biden is the King of getting rich off of his seat. He also makes sure his family gets rich. Shameful!

If Black's vote for Joe Biden now, they will just prove what Joe said! He expects the black Vote, he doesn't care about the Black Community. Once he gets the black vote, he will just go about trying to make his family rich. Look at his past.
Biden has God in his heart. Trump has nothing but hatred. Trump is a sinner who has never repented. You know this Vanessa. Biden has lost a wife and 2 kids and puts his faith in God. Trump believes in money and fame. Sinner. On Sunday, Biden is in church while Trump plays golf.
Anything Biden said is nothing compared to your ongoing racist and fascist acts as "president".
Corrupt Joe Biden! Using taxpayer dollars to protect his son!üëé
Because electing Trump and or Biden is also Foolish.  So how are you surprised that anyone would vote Kanye??

Fact check: Biden wants to get rid of automatic weapons and better gun control policies. Trump is the president and has suppressed the 1st amendment. Trump is a pedophile.
I had a dream that the DNC was controlled by that stupid dancing cockroach meme, and he rigged the primary results because Biden was going to promise to ban Raid and all other bug sprays.  Good Morning.
Biden is listening to Liz Warren, and this article she wrote is spot on!

Gonna get on the veep talk a little here, even though I won't be happy with whomever Biden picks. I do find it interesting. Everyone in contention has some obvious baggage except for one person. Tammy Duckworth. And yet she isn't considered a likely pick. (1/3)
Between Biden stridently opposing his own church's teaching on social issues and Trump saying Biden will "hurt God" (along with numerous other agitprop inanities) both are extraordinarily disqualified from being standard-bearers for the Christian faith.

I don‚Äôt care about their views on a mythical god. I care about the future of this country and the world. At least Joe Biden will follow the science on the virus and climate change.
Ye is going on ballots in swing states, which is strictly designed to help reduce the electoral count and hurt Biden. Trump's campaign is apparently PAYING for that. It is against federal election laws.

Really? Trump pardoned Jack Johnson. Obama didnt. Trump has done more for blacks than Biden or Obama.
Trump has gone to church once in the last year. By his own admission, he only attends church on Christmas and Easter or special occasions. While Trump is using tax payer money to enrich his golf courses on Sunday, Biden is in church. No Catholic should ever vote for him.
Minimum of 45 years, not 35. There is no good time or parole in federal crimes. Hopefully their court cases last until Biden is President and Barr is not AG. Hopefully.

Nope. Biden did not say that black people are all the same.
How many messed up and stupid comments about black people does Joe Biden have to make before we start asking ourselves about our other options? We make fun of Donald Trump for the same stupid things but give Biden a pass? Biden is not a step forward but a step to the side.
All three retweets I quoted contained lies.  Lie #1: James Woods said Biden has dementia.  Lie #2: Giuliani called BLM a hate group.  Lie #3:  DJT Jr. misquoted Biden.  Insinuations without proof are lies.

My husband and I saw a Biden ad tonight while watching the news on a Louisville station. Is Biden actually spending in red state Kentucky? I was hoping he would, since we did just elect a Democratic governor, but was still shocked to see it.
Biden is mentally deteriorating omg
Stick a fork in Biden he is DONE!
Goodbye America of trumps hello Biden!
I saw a Biden ad in Kentucky on a Louisville station, I hope it wasn't some weird fluke. We do have a Democratic governor, so even though red state, we do sometimes come together and vote blue. Also it would boost Amy McGrath's chances against McConnell.
We saw a Biden ad on a Louisville KY station. Is he doing random ad buys in red states too? I love it, because I feel like Biden spending here will give McGrath a boost against McConnell too.
Well there you have it, Biden is anti anything
We were watching the news on a normal Louisville station and a Biden ad came on! They have ad buys in KY! I had to double check it wasn't a national buy on CNN or something, nope, it's a KY buy.
Umm. Biden is also against energy. So.....
Do we need a debate to prove that? Just check the recent Axios interview. Debates are great for people with witty one liners and comebacks as opposed to actual policy discussions. Very little for Biden to gain imo
What a strong heartfelt statement. This is the man I know Joe Biden to be and it does my soul good to know that soon this is what the world will see from the US again.
Remember how Biden helped the African American community with his 1994 Crime Bill?
America under Joe Biden, prove me wrong
Would you rather be a free individual instead of just a member of a certain race. My God Joe Biden and the Democrats are wrong for America.
Everything is about race according Joe Biden and his fellow elite liberal racists of the Democrat party.
THIS IS NOT THE ELECTION TO VOTE OFF-PARTY!!!!!  I don't care what you think re:Biden. Now's not the time for "principled stands". A vote for anyone BUT Biden (or abstaining) is a vote for Trump. Period. Same goes for Mitch. #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt #BecauseItReallyTrulyDoes

Joe Biden has proven himself to be a northeastern elite liberal prone to inner racism and no longer able cover it up.
It would make my whole decade if at the beginning of their first debate, right after the introductions, During the elbow bump. President Trump looks Joe Biden right in the eye and says, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon Joe, lets go out back right now and just see if you really can kick my ass!‚Äù
Biden would lose. GOD has his arms wrapped around

Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
I know Biden was nowhere close to being your candidate in the primary. I‚Äôm glad to see you recognize the stakes are so high that we can‚Äôt afford to vote with a ‚Äúclear conscience‚Äù for a 3rd party candidate or write in Wendell Berry (and I‚Äôve done that a time or two).
Biden has insulted the African American folks once to often. Pathetic. He constantly has to apologize. No more !!
I think I'd prefer no debates. Seems like that used to be a way to learn candidate positions but the internet allows us that info now. How is winning a debate important to being a good president? Trump v. Biden debate seems like an exercise in outrage/car crash porn for ratings.
Joe Biden wants to ban your last resort second amendment for self preservation especially if the Marxist Black Lives Matter"s defund the police garbage catches on.
Very interesting way to introduce the Republican position of ‚ÄúGod is weaker than Joe Biden‚Äù
Joe Biden insulted every individual of the black community today.
That "come on man" fake jazz that Joe Biden tries to feed black America just doesn't cover up his racism.
Who would vote for Biden
For the record, Biden can be a practicing catholic, yet still support the LAW. Roe vs Wade is decided law.  It‚Äôs called separation of church and state.
Biden will not be the Dem candidate. But who will be?
Why? We ignored Trump's mental capability and look what happened. Biden is in much better shape... He took his SAT's and passed legally.
I‚Äôd wait in a 28 hour line and my vote won‚Äôt count for anything bc I live in a red state full of idiots.  But I feel that strongly about showing up and voting for Biden.
Well. Obviously the most objective form of measuring blackness is whether you vote for Biden or not. A blackness scale brought to you by a white liberal saviour.
Sad that Republicans are celebrating a mentally ill Kanye West running for President just to sway African American votes away from Biden. Tells you that they know Trump needs help to win
He‚Äôs ridiculing Biden‚Äôs mental state while COMPLETELY BOTCHING the joke he‚Äôs trying to make. Maybe because of his own mental state, perhaps?   I‚Äôm just not even sure what to say anymore.

NBC implicitly agrees with President Trump that Biden is "following the radical Left agenda" to "destroy your second amendment."
Now? You mean always! Always with the crazy shit!  Biden is the one who goes to church every Sunday. President Dumbass is the one who only goes to church when he needs a photo op.
And twice on Sunday while Biden is at church honoring God and Trump is on the golf course honoring himself.
This is not sarcasm.  Biden may have stumbled with the argument, but he is basically correct.
Remember that this same faithless man in the same paragraph said that Biden would hurt God. Do not be fooled by the lies of this snake. He is the antichrist and is using weak minded souls for his evil purposes.
He is going to need Joe Biden after he is elected, better watch what he says
Obviously, I‚Äôm serious... Biden‚Äôs political beliefs contradict the Catholic teachings in MANY ways. That doesn‚Äôt make him a bad person. It just is what it is.
OK, don't give Biden too much shit over his gaff about 'hispanics have all sorts of different issues/priorities, AAs don't'.  In many ways, he is kinda right. For example, the Cubans don't flat out hate trump, but most others do.  The entire AA population of the USA hates trump.
Actually, he said Biden, ‚ÄúHurt God...‚Äù
I saw Georgia was in play too ? I think Biden can reclaim the rust/Big 10 belt but Florida will go down to wire
"Take the guns 1st, due process 2nd"  ~Joe Biden.
I don't recall Biden having people shot with tear gas and rubber bullets for a photo-op with a Bible in front of a Church he doesn't even attend.
I agree!  Biden thought he was being ‚Äúcute‚Äù - instead, he was crass and a bully.  If he‚Äôs not careful, he will become more obnoxious than Trump.  üò°
Biden keeps talking about racial communities instead of American individuals.
It‚Äôs important to remember he didn‚Äôt say Biden would punch God, just that he would hurt him. He might step on God‚Äôs toe or accidentally spill hot coffee on him. There‚Äôs no telling.
If Trump wins it‚Äôs Joe Biden and the Democrats fault, not the people who didn‚Äôt vote.
Didn‚Äôt you know, Biden has Thor‚Äôs Hammer.
Isn't that why the Catholic Church has denied Joe Biden communion?

What I don't get in terms of strategy is Trump saying Biden is essentially suffered end-stage dementia and can barely speak. He sets the bar so low for Biden's debate performance, that when Biden does just fine, Biden will look like a stable genius. The strategy eludes me.
Ur still completely off topic. If u don't like Joe Biden that is fine.
Whining about Biden /drug prices?
Biden has been refused communion for his stance on abortion. He is not a devout practicing Catholic.

Crazy part is...Trump doesn‚Äôt know that. He just thinks saying Biden hates the Bible will excite his Evangelical base. But he doesn‚Äôt completely understand why.
Having a hard time understanding why this is an attack on Catholics?? I‚Äôm Catholic &amp; nothing about the wording offends me... Also, why is nobody talking about Biden - a devout Catholic - being beholden to the Pope?? Wasn‚Äôt this a huge issue with JFK...
Biden will mop the floor with the Trump during the debates. I can‚Äôt wait for the debates to begin. Dementia Donnie will not be able to keep up, as his last 2 interviews were evident. How much you wanna bet Trump will bow out of the debates come election time? He‚Äôs such a coward.
They are embarrassed to support trump and want to appear concerned about what he is doing. They say they won't vote for him again, but they are obviously looking for an excuse. Biden's VP choice is a deal breaker? Seriously? Just shut up and vote trump. Biden doesn't need you.

The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has rejected a request from the Trump campaign to either add an additional general election debate or move up the calendar for the contests.
If Biden wins republicans will go back to pretending to be mad about spending and democrats will go back to pretending to love spending. The last 4 years will be wiped from our collective memory and we will go back to bourgeois brunch and working class suffering.

My personal pick is Rice.
They say Biden is in cognitive decline but Trump doesn‚Äôt know the difference between a ballot and an application.
Biden is your choice. He is your ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù, the best you got, you choose him because he is smarter than you and lead where you can‚Äôt. Ha ha ha. Biden is your #1. Nuff said
Biden is your leader. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Biden is your ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù.....the best you got....your number 1....the one you choose because is is smarter and better than you. Nuff said!
Dementia? Have you seen Joe Biden lately?
I‚Äôm not gonna argue with you. Obama, Biden and others spied on the Trump campaign in 2016. End of story. Somebody‚Äôs going to jail for this. And it‚Äôs not Trump, it‚Äôs not Roger Stone or Michael Flynn.
It is possible that he could be Biden‚Äôs Vice President and then serve out the last 2 years or less of the term and keep on doing that for the rest of his life.
LOL...‚Äùcrushed them all.‚Äù  Were you doing shots at each Biden gaffe?
If you are a true American you wouldn't be voting for trump or biden.

When Biden said he was picking a Black Woman as VP ended any qualifications. Just as long as she is black and a woman.
By supporting biden, you support millions without healthcare dying, you support more funding for the police to become more violent and more military equipment, you support endless wars and sacrificing the poor for profits, and you want nothing to change just like biden said.
I hope Alexander Vindman gets a seat on Biden's National Security Council.
He was on stage bringing it to Biden on these issues for months.
If Biden wins it will be voter fraud. Call to arms !
If Biden picks anyone other than Harris at this point, it‚Äôll be his Palin moment. (Not saying either of Bass or Rice are as bad as Palin, but the pick would be just as strange and underwhelming).
Mom for Biden here. 100%
That‚Äôs exactly what he will do. Make it as difficult as possible for Joe Biden.

Not sure which would be worse... biden, trump, or pelosi...i keep puking trying to decide.
Biden supporters are thrilled about the evictions and foreclosures. Who do you think is going to by the bloody real estate?
I will give you he is a better choice than biden but i want to see a platform.
Eisenhower was more progressive than biden. In 19fucking56...
I don‚Äôt think WI would even matter if PA, MI, AZ and FL are called for Biden.Who thinks it's ok for Putin to actively denigrate Biden and promote   How can anyone not push back on a hostile foreign country meddling in our elections?  I know Trump wants to win at any cost - but democracy?
If Biden said he would unban tik tok if Trump does he would have a lot of boomers voting for him.
Then, why didn't the Me Too movement support the lady that Biden sexually assaulted? Are there 2 Me Too Movements? There is back-up on this assault; it was on Larry King way before Biden thought about running.
We really didn‚Äôt dissect Joe Biden saying people getting access to universal healthcare would be an insult to his dead son enough.  That man is willing to let thousands of not millions suffer because of some vague notion that alleviating their suffering would be AN INSULT.
Sleepy Joe Biden? More like sleepy michael miller.
Good luck with that #Biden

Joe Biden's 4 trillion tax hike will hit middle and working-class Hoosiers the hardest. We can't afford Joe Biden and the liberal Democrats!
I have a working theory that Joe Biden wants to lose
Thanks for the info you are sending, whoever this is (undoubtedly one of Joe Biden's "handlers"). Your boy is quickly failing. You didn't have this planned, did you people? Lol!
And while he‚Äôs blabbering on about nonsense, pissing all of us off, his minions are propping Kanye up to rob some of Biden‚Äôs votes. Bait and switch.
I‚Äôm guessing Hiden Biden will appreciate this bill if only he can just rememberü§£
They do notice that about Biden. That's why they then turn around and focus on picking Trump apart. To get the attention away from Dementia Joe.
What about the conspiracy theory that biden even has a chance at winning in november? That is some bat shit crazy stuff there. He likely wont even remember what he is running for.
Good ole Jim Crow Joe.
Like they are going to let Biden debate.
Yep that‚Äôs why they gave Ivanka all those trademarks, to butter up Biden ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Can jason miller possibly be more ignorant?

I personally don't care what reason you need to vote for Joe Biden, just do it!
I will vote for Biden NO MATTER WHAT
Biden hurting god sorta sounds badass
im confused, does biden have some angelic power to "hurt God", did you just admit that he is stronger than you'll ever be. I kinda wanna vote for somebody with the power to hurt god. Ngl, thats avenger lv stuff.
And yet he and republicans attack Biden for much less compromising touching.
Within the last week Joe Biden has managed to insinuate there is not diversity within the Black community &amp; advocate for not only NOT abolishing the police, but INCREASING THEIR FUNDING.  This is REALLY the man moderate Democrats thought would be BEST for energizing Black voters.
Fox News is reporting that Joe Biden wants   ‚Ä¢Guaranteed Basic Income ‚Ä¢Reparations ‚Ä¢Government Paid Childcare ‚Ä¢The Green New Deal ‚Ä¢Single Payer Healthcare ‚Ä¢Prison Abolition  Like fuck I WISH. COULD YOU IMAGINE? That would be AMAZING.
Lol. You all get rid of those candidates from the start. But im glad you finally understood. When biden makes some policy to help people with mental illnesses ill look at it. But he gotta stop putting black people down, i wont support that ever.
Biden never said that! Stop your lying!
I didnt say biden was the president did i? And we are gonna focus on one thing, because at this point you arent even trying to get me to vote. You actually sidestepped my questions about what i want. And said something about climate change, its too late. So did i say he was pres?
Also the revolution started before trump was in office. Or did blm not matter then? 7/13/13....who was president? Was it trump? Wait, i think biden was in office as some authority figure or something. Again you are showing how ignorant you are. Why would i listen yo you? LMFAO.
The fact that many places have begun reallocating police budgets to the people. Police are losing relationships within the community left and right. Police have been told to stop doing this and to stop doing that. But yeah, the revolution isnt "working". biden isn't doing this.
These changes have been made without biden or trumps support and actions. Seems like we can change things without your scare tactics. So you want me to vote for somebody who will change things less than the revolution, the one you say isnt working? Ok, boomer.
Yall begging us to vote for another warmonger who wants to increase police budgets. Sorry bout yuh! I really dont give a fuck. Black people matter. And clearly biden doesnt see it that way. So yes trump sucks,...wait no revolution? Are you ignorant to what we have changed already
Trump's latest stance is that Joe Biden is against "God, Guns and Energy". . . What is 2020
Schrodinger‚Äôs Biden logic  Unable to form a complete sentence  Also able to hurt God.
God is all powerful, all knowing and able to be wounded by Joe Biden. Noted.
Well 50 percent of the white vote has been voting Republican for decades. If anything most of the time it‚Äôs been more than 50. So if Trump is down to 50 that means Biden has a decent chance
Holy crap, Joe Biden has a Hattori Hanzo blade.
Apparently Biden is gonna hurt God. God better watch out!
Is the answer simply to back nobody? Abstain from votiing? Or just vote for relyctantly vote biden(
I think Pelosi will do it just so she can push Biden aside and then she will be president
Plain to see how racist Biden is. Always has been

Don‚Äôs current con is the smooth ease he‚Äôs showing with Kanye‚Äôs Presidential run and his RNC folks dashing signatures over to get Kanye on the ticket in an effort to draw Biden votes over to Kanye.
Joe Biden is so smart. Vote for JOE!
It still is pulling votes from Biden and that‚Äôs scary. I feel the only reason Hilary didn‚Äôt win is because of the same thing. Those votes add up and could allow trump to win.
its funny cause nobodys voting for trump cause they "hate biden more", theyre all weird cult-like diehard supporters  where i feel like everyone voting for biden is just like "we know he sucks but at least we can bully him enough to do what we want" lmao
donald trump and his wooden headed myrmidons will stop at nothing to have him re-elected in November. One of their devious stratagems is to get Kanye on the ballot in battle ground states to chip away black and young votes from Biden. Don't fall for it. Don't vote for Kanyetrump!
crazy comparing how hard republicans were shitting on hillary back in 2016 compared to how much less theyre shitting on biden  it was "LOCK HER UP" for her but for him its "LOL he talks weird"  almost like being a woman in america makes it harder to acheive positions of power!
I do see Biden...very clearly.

Biden lies too, ya know. But we all know Biden won't debate and you will blame Trump. May as well write your article from the "conservative" perspective now.
Joe Biden's seclusion from the public reminds me more every passing day of The Wizard of Oz. All the people are allowed to see is a picture of a man mouthing the words actually uttered by the mystery man behind the curtains. Oz was a fake we all learned in the end. Just thinking.
Yes and he has enlisted Kanye to help him! Kanye is only running to pull votes from Biden!
Please don‚Äôt fall for this!! Kanye is trying to pull votes from Biden to keep trump in the whitehouse!
I truly believe he is doing so to help trump win again. I think Kanye is trying to pull votes from Biden and is probably being paid to do so by trump!
Biden Loses It In Interview Asked About Cognitive Fitness A reasonable question, come on man.....
Cool. Now do biden since he announced his candidacy
I was a public school teacher for 31 years.  In those 31 years, I didn‚Äôt have as much physical contact with female students as Joe Biden did in less than two minutes.   All the teachers I‚Äôve known that were overly friendly and touchy were either fired or ended up in jail üëáüò¨üëáüò¨
No it wasn't. Yes Biden will probably do more harm to it. Stay in your lane bro.
Both Biden and Rice were part of trying to take down our elected President; and now they are running for the presidency and VP?
The report should be revealed before the election. Hell, Biden and his VP were part of it. Let the American voter know the truth.
Yes Joe Biden said it best that if you don‚Äôt vote for him then you aren‚Äôt black.  Dems only care about blacks during elections.  They do NOTHING for blacks after an election.  Wake up!!
Except he‚Äôs not making that face at Biden.  He‚Äôs making it at your Dear Leader, Trump.  You should look up self own.  #TrumpHasNoClue #TrumpIsNotWell
You make a lot of unsubstantiated accusations - klansman, sexual abuser, racist etc.  Look at the trump Biden record.  Don‚Äôt be duped, just because the Dems let you think you live in the house doesn‚Äôt mean they see you any different than being in the field.
I still see folks saying they will write in Vote for you, if we dont all get on the same page and fast Trump will win again...Are we all in on Biden or writing in Bernie...I see comments all over the place &amp; we have to make sure Trump doesnt cheat his way to another win!
Or you could call them adults that realized the country is fucked either way and we just want it to end asap. And since nobody has cared about my future, or protected my pursuit of happiness. Fuck em. I was gonna vote biden. But just like in 2016. Yall be doing this shit. Fuck it
Biden is a congenital liar too. IF you establishment idiots were HONESTLY interested in what actual #WorkingPeople need you would not be repeating "Trump bad" as your plan to get #JoeBuyDone elected
Your dad‚Äôs in an idiot! Joe Biden‚Äòs got better things to do!
If you elect joe Biden in November, you will be electing senility and dementia for leadership. If you elect Donald Trump, you will elect leadership and a fighter for America! Vote like your life depends on the outcome, BECAUSE IT DOES.

This....... this is difficult to watch....  This is also why Biden is leading without coming out of his basement... People see Trumps response to covid and thing "well we can't do any fucking worse than this guy... might as well vote for the other guy."
I hope that one of Biden‚Äôs first days include requiring the immediate resignations of all agency heads installed by tRump, i.e. Tata, the Postal Service head.  They are all ridiculous tRump suck-ups and bring disgrace to America

I agree but sadly 2 of the younger members of the family just do not get it. Demands for the rest of us to bend to them and vote for Biden or else. I chose or else.
Americans want more Biden and trump debates starting this month
If Biden can‚Äôt even debate Trump then he‚Äôs not prepared to be president.
Question: how can anyone with a modicum of intelligence vote for Joe Biden, knowing that he has dementia, and is suffering from dementia? How can he be expected to, personally, take charge of America?
Is Biden Losing Black Support ?

If it weren‚Äôt for the fringe left, Joe Biden and George Bush are basically the same dude.  Your evolution looks more cyclical to me.
How far in advance of election can u request absentee ballot? Does it have to be after DNC convention and Biden is official nominee? Can track your ballot to make sure it is counted? I have not voted absentee before.
This is what it takes to keep the Lincoln monument safe in the #democrat controlled nations capitol today. If the people supporting #Biden win, will we even have this any more, or will #Pelosi have it removed? After all, HE was a republican too.

Good place for her but how crazy is this:
I'm still going to vote for Biden/Harris, but only because they're the best chance at beating Trump. It can't be denied that they're both bland candidates, without any real interest in changing the system, but at least they aren't making it much worse.
What a deceitful manipulation of facts.  Typical Biden and libs in general.......
Don't mistake "vote blue no matter who" as support for Biden/Harris. "Vbnmw" is strictly a vote against Trump.
Biden doesn't need cartoons.
So proud and will vote proudly for you and Joe Biden.
For sure. Biden and Harris!
Biden could have picked Jesus and ya'll would still complain.
Getting Biden / Harris after thinking we are getting Bernie is like being told you‚Äôre going to Disneyland but instead you‚Äôre taken to an abandoned warehouse where you‚Äôre forced to kill your childhood pet with a hunting knife but somehow it‚Äôs still better than the other option.
I'm just favoring his tweet so that I can bump it in November after Biden/Harris wins.
Crazy Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate. Mr. President, I have one question for you. Is he trying to throw the election??? He just made your re-election bid a hell of alot easier. This is funny. #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
Like, if you're just not excited about Biden, that's fine, I get that. But it's completely false to say that he doesn't give progressives any reason to get excited when his platform is overwhelmingly progressive.

I've just made my decision. I support the Biden-Harris ticket for November 3rd.

I also get those who will say ‚Äúthe guy in there now has cognitive issues,‚Äù but at least it‚Äôs out there! We know what we get with him if he wins. If Biden wins, do we get a seasoned political veteran or a ceremonial figure head while Harris and his advisors run the show?
But I do not understand how anyone (even those who hold the positions above) could watch Biden sit in hiding in his basement, avoiding the public eye, and not be curious as whether his cognitive abilities are legitimate concerns.

It's gross when people jump on someone who is explaining why they're sad they have to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket because it's the less harmful option. "Less harmful" means there are still valid concerns and it should signify that your privilege might not be welcome here.
I'm not sure I'd be holding my breath that Joe Biden will give you a much deserved pardon, however they will certainly be more susceptible to public pressure than the current administration. Good luck Edward.

Also yesterday: Biden announced his support of a plan that would have every governor enact a mask mandate. He said it could save 40,000 American lives.   20/x
In other presidential election news, the 2020 Democratic  nominees Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will sign the required documents to officially become the party nominees today.   That's ahead of next week's  9/x
To put that number in perspective,  reported yesterday that Senator Harris's short-lived Presidential campaign raised $40 million during the entire campaign.  Biden raised a little over $60 million in 2019.   8/x
The Biden campaign announced last night that they raised $48 million dollars in the 48 hours after announcing Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) as Biden's VP selection.   That's per  7/x

I'm glad Trump is upset; that nasty a-hole sure doesn't care who he gets upset. Sen Harris is going to mop the floor with Pence in the debate and Biden is going to do the same thing with Trump.
How are things looking in your state for Biden now that he has Harris as vp
I think Joe Biden should show off Sen Harris. His ratings got a boost when he chose her for his running mate. She was my pick for president. I think she may well be our first woman president.
Well 45 doesn't want us to have mail and USPS anymore.  A reporter asked him about lies. He thinks Harris wasn't born in the usa. Says Biden has horrible ideas for the virus and hes doing great.

ALL THAT SAID: redistricting did make this a little more Democratic, but it's still very Republican.   If Cooper can't win this district in November, no Democrat (Biden, Cunningham, or Davis) will win it.
To everyone that's voting for Biden Republicans voting for Biden Democrats Independents etc.... are you ok with a mask mandates for 3 months to get this virus under control. I certainly am ok with it
I wholeheartedly agree. Biden and Harris aren‚Äôt definitely my first choice but Trump and Pence are monsters. I hope we can have mail in voting but Trump‚Äôs comments today worry me
2/2 "a nice and decent man". A lot of people here sat 2016 out because they felt they couldn't vote for either candidate. Almost without exception those people were planning to vote Biden to restore the status quo.
Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris will be his running mate Tuesday.
Hey DumDum Donnie. You saying Kamala Harris was meaner to Biden as you call him slow Joe is the epitome of no self awareness. This country will be so much better off without you it will seem like a paradise. #AllRoadsLeadToPutin #ResignNow
1/3 I'm from Indiana which went for Obama in 2008 and Trump in 2012. I assure you Joe Biden would have taken Indiana with a VP pick who was considered 'a nice person'. Instead he picked someone who is despised by the centrists who sat it out in 2016 because they hated (unfairly)
Far left Joe Biden has just called for a mandate requiring Americans to wear a mask in public for AT LEAST the next 3 months. No thanks Joe! Americans have had enough of you and your party‚Äôs tyrannical shaninagins. That‚Äôs why you are going to lose, and bigly.
"Kamala Harris: Where does Biden's running mate stand on Middle East issues? Joe Biden's pick for vice president has been a staunch supporter of Israel and an outspoken critic of Saudi Arabia‚Äù
I'll be voting Biden in November. The real question is whether Joe just signed us up for 4 more years of Trump by picking Kamala. 13% of Americans were undecided, where do you think most of them live? Swing states, and a bunch of them just landed on the wrong side of the fence.
You admit to being mean and condescending to Joe Biden, but think that's okay because you weren't the meanest or most condescending.  Brilliant plan, Skippy.  "Yeah, I'm a child rapist, but Epstein was more child-rapey than me, so I'm the good guy."  BRILLIANT!!!
Biden isnt my first choice either, and hes no saint, but I dont live in a country where thats an option rn.  and sacrificing a practical choice that can move us in the right direction isnt worth fake morality points that can and will cost lives
voting for #Trump is dumb. voting for  Biden is dumb. any vote in the system is a vote for the system. #dontvote
Biden Voter: "Defund The Police!"  Trump Voter: "Defund The Post Office!"  The Rest of the World: "Defund The United States!"
normally i would agree with this and like i said i don't fuck with purity politics but the people who have been marginalized and oppressed have been discussing the danger and past damages of Biden and Harris
I don't expect any growth beyond pandering from Biden/Harris cause they've never been held accountable for any past wrongs, they just move along because americans have political amnesia
I think in terms of effecting policy Biden and Harris can be as dangerous as Trump. They already have been more dangerous. One of Trump's most dangerous features is how he radicalizes and mobilizes his base and he will not lose that if he loses the presidency
appoint but Biden and Harris are a dangerously potent combo considering the escalating nature of the police state over the course of our lives. I'm not gonna shame anyone who wants to vote Biden/Harris and I'm not one for purity politics or trying to keep my hands clean
no matter who the president is. What we're choosing when we vote for Biden or Trump is what that violence looks like. I choose not to endorse that violence to any degree but instead organize against it. If dems had a backbone we could count on them to block whoever Trump might
I see what you're saying but given their histories in regards to the PIC I don't see Biden or Harris doing anything to reduce state violence and I have zero faith in their supreme court appointee. As the american empire continues to falter the state will become more fascist
Today on Brand New (Linked): After previously announcing the adoption of  Decimal and Mercury as the campaign‚Äôs typefaces along with the announcement of Joe Biden‚Äôs VP, Kamala Harris, the new Biden Harris logo has been updated to Decimal
Biden might not be the guy whos going to do all of the things we want, but he can open up talks, clear a way, start UNDOING roadblocks that TRUMP is trying to set up.  Meanwhile another Trump term means another 4 years of work just to undo what hes done and get back to square 1.
This is going to matter.
list of reasons I am voting for biden/harris
In Biden's speech about Harris, he talked about representation. Kamala Harris is the first female African-American or Asian-American VP nominee.  5/x
Here's a story on the pick from  at     4/x
Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vice Presidential nominee Kamala Harris introduced their ticket together in Delaware.   ‚ÄúI have no doubt I picked the right person to join me as the next Vice President of the United States of America, that‚Äôs Kamala Harris," Biden said.  3/x
This is a straight up lie. Trump was talking about the statue removal debate and Biden knows it. Go watch the video for yourself. This is the only way these people know how to get votes, it sure won‚Äôt be based on policy.
Fuck Joe Biden.
Are we referring to moderate candidates like Biden (mix of left and right views) or actual centrists (equating the left and right as equally wrong)?
I just want Biden to win so bad. his speeches I can stand he cares. I just want to throw a shoe at 45 right now
If you‚Äôre going to abstain from voting or write in a third party candidate because you don‚Äôt like the Biden/Harris ticket just put MAGA in your twitter bio.
Biden: "if you have a problem figuring out whether you are voting for me or Trump, then you ain't black"
Keep drinking the juice .....  Biden didn't want his kids growing up in a racial Jungle at school  Biden said you can't walk into a 7-11 if you don't have a little Indian accent  Biden so wrote the the 1993 Crime Bill which led to punitive sentences for non violent offenders
Watching Joe Biden Introduces Senator Kamala Harris as Running Mate     #bidenharris #biden #harris #realchange #empathy #compassion #leadership #hope #possibility #victory
I was impressed, in the debates, that Harris couldn't find anything worse about Biden.
I just disagree with the narrative, ‚ÄúWell a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for Trump.‚Äù Those in power try to guilt trip us with that b.s. They‚Äôre going to shame me for voting on the candidate I see most fit, because the establishment &amp; DNC doesn‚Äôt approve? Nah. I‚Äôm good.
Amen god bless.  Omg I wish Biden would win your state this November and your governor ousted too
That‚Äôll be my reaction as Biden wins in a landslide. Trump is going to lose in a landslide.
Scaredy Trump Flees to Fox News After Biden Chooses Kamala Harris  via
#Mamala had me in tears. When  spoke from her heart about Beau Biden and his love for his dad  I ugly cried. And when Harris shared with us that she has had many titles, but none more important than #Mamala, I lost it again. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
You inspire me alot by you changing your mind.  It gives me hope Biden can win.  We need to work as a team Republicans and Democrats to elect Biden and get rid of 45 this November
I'm voting by mail üòÉ. What state are you voting in and what made you decide to vote for Biden and change sides
THAT‚ÄôS WHAT BIDEN-HARRIS FASCIM 2020 WANT YOU TO THINK!!  JK, I totally agree with you. They aren‚Äôt even close in badness but it is a two party system ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (I know a lot of people who are commenting spend their time making an electable third party so no offense to those people)
thank you for voting for Biden this November
Don‚Äôt think that if Biden and Harris are voted in, America will be saved. We MUST continue to hold them accountable for their actions and push them to step up to the promises they made.
bro I know Kamala Harris has her issues... but there‚Äôs no way in im voting for t*ump over Biden/Harris
Joe Biden did nothing to help while Vice President.
The Democratic Party does not care and will attempt to push Kamala Harris, a cop, onto us for the 2024 presidency including this election. You are voting for her, not Joe Biden. #VoteGreenParty
Joe Biden speaks in complete sentences.
We have China on and Iran wanting Biden. Russia wants 45
I feel very confident Biden will beat 45. We just need your state or Wisconsin to turn blue.  I feel more positive in your state because it's so close to California and west coast is blue
I've noticed some resisters block me for no reason. But I gain more because in the end we need to be a team and beat 45 this November and elect Biden
A lil reminder: Biden and Harris may be awful candidates for the election, but a vote for anyone else is a vote for trump. Stay angry but don't be fucking stupid
To all Floridians please see that 45 wants to risk college athletes there lives to play due to the virus and your governor too. Its not right.  If you really want to save your children family friends anyone please vote for Biden
No where in the original tweet did anyone say don‚Äôt vote and mfs voting for the sake of voting and not holding our elected officials accountable is how we got here in the first place. Not wanting to vote for Biden =\= wanting Trump to be president.
Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris will be his running mate Tuesday.
Also, tariffs were announced 5 months before US Steel's announcement, no company decides to invest $750mm in that short of a time frame  And sweet heavens, what's wrong with Biden reviewing and doing his research before making a decision?
And also you can questions someone‚Äôs loyalty to progressive ideals if they‚Äôre ready to champion the Biden/Harris ticket as something to be proud of or something that‚Äôs the proverbial right thing to do. My overall point is there‚Äôs no room for virtue signaling in this.
I see a lot of people criticizing kamala Harris and joe Biden (rightfully so) but I would just like to remind everyone that our current president‚Äôs father was a member of the KKK and he is also breaking our constitution on a daily basis.
I'm from Indiana and a Democrat and voting for Biden
Congratulations to  and, perhaps more important, her constituents in Minnesota.   Another win for the ascendent progressive wing of the Democratic party &amp; an important counterpoint to yesterday's unsurprising announcement from the corporatists running the Biden campaign.
Soap Star Joe is about Biden. Most ppl don‚Äôt know that.
Great  newsletter this morning about Senator Harris being named as Biden's Vice President.
i'm pretty divorced from electoral politics now a days so i've been shocked to discover people actually think Joe Biden has a chance of beating Trump?? and naturally if this doesn't happen it will be the fault of the non voting left
1) Kamala Harris is biracial. Stop erasing part of her identity by just saying she's Black.  2) Read up on Lori Lightfoot if you want to know why some of your BIPOC friends have concerns about someone with her leanings on any ticket.  3) Voting for Biden is still the lesser evil
Biden said he wants police reform then announces one of the most strict District Attorneys as his VP. Make up your mind man ü§°
I am so very happy with Biden‚Äôs choice for a running mate. An inexplicable sense of peace and happiness came over me when he made the announcement. Good times are on the horizon! #BidenHarris2020
President Trump going after Biden's VP pick this morning:
Trump and Pence are going down and his sycophants and racist enablers will be remembered when they are up for election even in red leaning Indiana who help elect the President Obama &amp; VP Biden in 2008.
After the announcement, Democratic fundraising committee ActBlue ‚Äî which allows for small-donors to make contributions ‚Äî processed $10.8 million, the Biden campaign's largest day for grassroots donations.   Story from the times here:  8/x
There is also some reporting to suggest that Harris being on the ticket will bring in money from the tech industry in Silicon Valley. Harris ‚Äî being from California ‚Äî is close with many big tech leaders.   7/x
The GOP is already firing back at Harris's nomination, calling attention to her comments on Biden from early in the primary. New ads are trying to tie her to far-left policy and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.  Here's a tweet from the President.  6/x
Around 4:15 PM EST, the Biden campaign released that his pick was Harris in an email and text to supporters.   They also tweeted this at 4:17 PM on Biden's twitter account:   5/x
Biden's team ‚Äî amazingly ‚Äî had no major leaks about who the nominee was. Biden started calling the candidates who were not selected in the middle of day.   Reports were released that Congresswoman Karen Bass and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer had not been selected.   4/x
Former Vice President Joe Biden ‚Äî who captured the 2020 Democratic nomination ‚Äî has finally named a vice presidential pick: California Senator Kamala Harris.   Harris was a competitor of Biden's this election cycle, but dropped out before Iowa.   2/x
seriously the amount of people who a few weeks ago were all about defunding the police are now posting how excited they are about biden/harris? so what I‚Äôm hearing is you didn‚Äôt actually care
#Hail ! #BidenHarris The Democratic Coalition ‚Äî Donate via ActBlue #EndThisTwilightZoneEpisode
thank you for your service and thank you for voting for Biden this November.  We need to be a team no matter Republicans and Democrats and elect Biden and get rid of 45. God bless from a Democrat
What's wrong with celebrities, is everything a conspiracy to them. Trump don't need to cheat to beat Biden. Just because you see a red hat Jamie, don't mean that person's out to get you.
No problem anytime.  I  can't find many Biden voters in our state.  I'm happy to find some though.  Its growing.  I wish our state would turn blue
I'm from Indiana too and voting for Biden and a Democrat
And Trump is the sharpest tool in the shed? Biden suffers from a stutter that he has mostly overcome. Trump had people take tests for him. Biden is compassionate and empathize with others, Trump could care less about anyone but Trump. Big difference.
Correction, you believe in Trump. Bernie supports and helped write the initiatives that Biden is running on. This has been a collaboration of those you say you support but in truth we know where you stand - with a racist dictator that wants to undo our democracy.
In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
Can't wait to see 45 out and Biden and Harris win
No problem anytime.  We need to work as a team to elect Biden and get rid of 45 asap
This could be game-changing for the Biden campaign. Harris could bring in a swath of big money from Silicon Valley‚¨áÔ∏è.
Omg yes and for the better when 45 is out and Biden and Harris take over
I don't object to voting for Biden, just the "if we lose, we lose forever" reasoning. It doesn't lead anywhere good.
Good, strong move by Biden.   No go win this thing!
I fear you may be right. But Biden needs to appeal to Midwestern voters who voted for Obama, not the White supremacists allowed by police to stage a putsch in the Michigan State House.
Way too many people on my feed just assuming that Biden/Kamala will definitely win. Haven't we learned anything?
Biden might be thinking she can't be accused of being far left, but the Trumpers either believe whatever they're told, or simply don't care if he's lying. I think this matchup just got a lot closer today and I don't think I can take 4 more years of the orange one.
as a lib myself, i am less than thrilled about kamala. super tone deaf of biden in my opinion
I am ready for Biden / Harris to fix the mess that 45&amp;co. continue to make of our country. A prosecutor is just who we need. An African-Asian American female prosecutor, especially.
The party of "defend the police" picked a cop...Biden and Trump are both senile and useless...my kingdom for a relevant 3rd party!
I refuse to watch trump and Biden debate but this I can get behind...
We found her a couple years ago, she endorsed Biden.
Is it the official position of the Biden-Harris campaign that Joe Biden is a racist? It seems that one of two things is true: either Biden accepts Harris‚Äôs position that he‚Äôs a racist, or she called him a racist in an effort to score cheap political points. Which one is it?
Democratic Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton (VA-10) on Biden's pick for VP:
PICKED TO HELP JOE FINISH OFF AMERICA  via    Meme the Left talks about Creepy Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Hairyass
You seem like a smart young lady, I say that, of course, because I fully agree. I imagine you will be doing the same as me in November, voting for Biden Harris because they're left of fascist.
Trump \ Pence  Vrs. Biden \Harris No Biden's running mate has been picked, no surprise, it was Kamala Hairyass
I may have been "Biden" my time earlier, but now I'm kamALLa in.
I think considering other options she's best choice for Biden to win
If you don‚Äôt understand how important it is to defeat 45 (to prevent catastrophic warming, economic collapse, etc.), then I‚Äôm not sure you understand what‚Äôs going on rn. It makes your opinions on the world less trustworthy. If you do, you‚Äôre voting for Biden and Harris.
BREAKING: Donald Trump rips Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as VP  via   has an ignorance that only his base can love!!!
Watching news as it broke Biden chose Harris (superb choice). A knock on door: new neighbor with champagne bottle to introduce himself. Sat on front porch 2chat for 45 minutes. Came back in 2see Trump, instead of congratulating her, had already called Harris ‚Äúnasty‚Äù. #BidenHarris
Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris will be his running mate Tuesday.
Biden's pick of Kamala Harris as 2020 running mate: IU experts available to comment. See full bios and contact info:
But ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù is such a vague and therefore meaningless term imo. Who‚Äôs greater good? I just don‚Äôt think any type of morality can be used to justify voting for anyone. I‚Äôm voting democrat solely because I dislike Trump more than Biden/Harris not because I think they‚Äôll..
I‚Äôm a vote, but I‚Äôm getting to the point where I‚Äôm starting to feel like voting for presidents is nearly meaningless. I focus on local and statewide elections tbh but that‚Äôs me. Unfortunately my ballot will probably say Biden/Harris
How about calling Biden a racist during the primary‚Äôs? Change her mind on that to?
A point I just considered. Obama turned over orchestration of the recovery act to Biden when the latter was VP. Harris is a prosecutor. Who better to oversee what we are going to need to do with Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Bill Barr and the rest of the current criminal cabal?
The correct choice. Kamala Harris can verbally handle any human being on the planet.
California has been a disaster for a while now and Kamala has already called Biden a racist so this ought to be interesting . I will be curious if the term "sexist" comes up often now.
I'd be far more excited if Biden and Harris were the versions of themselves that the far right seems to think they are.
Warren comments on Harris being named Biden's Vice Presidential nominee...
This is specifically about Biden. Harris is ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è to me but she does such a good job in the senate and we rly need people like her to stay and advocate there and grill the stupid ass people trump nominated lmfao like Barr
Yes called it! Biden-Harris 2020
Not at all!!!! Old school acquaintance on FB saying Biden didn‚Äôt actually name an African-American running mate because she‚Äôs ‚ÄúJamaican Indian‚Äù. Etc
Oh so happy! Best choice! From an independent in Indiana. America needs Biden/Harris!
Literally sitting here with tears of joy running down my cheeks. My god how much did we need this?!! Fired up! üî• ready to go! Let‚Äôs do this! Proud to finally be able to say BIDEN HARRIS 2020!
Biden-Harris 2020. Time to get to work.
Insane power move by Biden by having the woman who used to sell T-Shirts about how racist he was publicly kiss the ring to be his Vice President
The YouTube comment presidency. Also literally no one on the Left considers Harris (or Biden) to be Radical.
Let's elect Biden and Harris, and then let's yell at them a lot.
As a former Speech teacher and debate coach, there is not a better debater than Kamala Harris. I can‚Äôt wait to see her make chopped liver out of Mike Pence. This is an extraordinarily stark choice. Biden/Harris against Trump/Pence.
Now that Biden has picked Kamala Harris is his running mate, what‚Äôs the over/under on POTUS caught on a hot mic dropping the N-word.
it almost feels like biden wants trump to win
This is the most excited I have been in 3+ years. Biden has hit it out of the ballpark with his announcement of Kamala Harris as his Vice President. I feel so incredibly hopeful.
I really liked her as a candidate. My main concern/hope is that Biden‚Äôs campaign management is better than Hillary‚Äôs so this reassures me a bit.
Joe Biden is a skeletal mouthpiece for radical, neo-Marxists.  Kamala Harris had 3% approval within her own party.   I can't imagine why the Democrats want to push mail-in voting.   #MAGA2020
Fuck Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
Kamala Harris will sink the #Biden campaign. Just watch.
I'm not the most pleased with Biden/Harris, but will I crawl over hot coals to vote for them in November? You bet your ass I will
Biden has picked his vice presidential running mate: Kamala Harris
There's the official announcement. Biden/Harris will be the 2020 Democratic ticket.
#BREAKING: Former VP Joe Biden has picked  as his running mate.
#BREAKING: Joe Biden has chosen California Senator Kamala Harris to become his running mate.
#BREAKING: Bass and Abrams are also out as Biden's running mate.
#BREAKING: Michigan Gov. Whitmer will not be Biden's running mate.
CNN is reporting that Congresswoman Karen Bass (CA-37), who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, was told by Biden himself that she is not Biden's pick for VP.
Also unacceptable that Biden supports the Jones act.  üáµüá∑
Joe Biden will not be announcing his running mate today, per Biden campaign official.
How about a big blue Biden birthday cake
Likely before Biden announces his VP.
I can‚Äôt get specific, but I have been told that Biden‚Äôs VP pick is a woman.
There are sources saying that Biden has made his Vice Presidential selection and will announce as early as today.
Oh god, I missed the Biden stuff. There's just so much to take in tbh. What a horrible person
thank you for voting for Biden this November your a true inspiration to me seeing that we need change.  We all got to work together as a team Democrat and Republican to elect Biden.  God bless from a Democrat
And that's why Biden is waiting for his VP announcement.
I believe that's why Biden is waiting on his announcement.
Hoping its Bass.  Mostly because I want someone to make a shirt with the Democratic donkey and a caption that reads "Ridin' ass with Biden Bass"
There will be Republican primaries in 4 years to determine that. If chosing the best VP candidate is so important then why did Biden back himself into a corner on who could be considered?
When does Biden make his Vice Presidential announcement?   (Retweet to get more responses)
Some of Biden's 2020 primary competitors, such as Sanders, Klobuchar, Buttigieg, Harris, and Warren, also received speaking slots.
Very true but LBJ was smart, Biden's an idiot
Would I prefer Joe Biden pick a woman of color as VP? For sure. (I vote Harris.) But it‚Äôs his decision to make in terms of who he thinks is best suited, and with whom he thinks he can best work. Period. ‚ÄúVote blue no matter who‚Äù aren‚Äôt just empty words for me this election cycle.
Would I prefer Joe Biden pick a woman of color as VP? Yeah, I would, definitely. But it‚Äôs his decision to make in terms of who he thinks is best suited, and with whom he thinks he can best work. Period. ‚ÄúVote blue no matter who‚Äù aren‚Äôt just empty words for me this election cycle.
Imagine no religion, well not Biden, he's Catholic.
People need to chill the fuck out. Obama didn‚Äôt pick Biden until late August 2008.
Biden: I'm gonna treat this like it's December 23rd and people are dying with anticipation for their gifts.   Me: Motherfucker, you're Columbus Day not Christmas. ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden posting like it's 2100 back in 2012
Biden would say sorry i messed up. How is everyone doing.  He cares unlike 45
POTUS: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a believer in polls, but ours are going up and Biden‚Äôs are going down‚Äù.
No wonder they like Biden. They are as detached from reality as he is!
Trying to steal the attention from Biden‚Äôs VP announcement.
It would seriously be so funny if some random guy chartered a flight just to create a false narrative that Buttigieg was traveling to see Biden.
Joe Biden and Donald Trump both have big ‚Äúwe‚Äôll just wing that part‚Äù group project guy energy.
This likely doesn't have VP implications if it is Buttigieg, of course.   Biden has committed to picking a female running mate.
This guy reminds me of my old man who is a lifelong Republican, served with the 25th Infantry in Vietnam 1965-6, and is voting for Joe Biden in November. Thank you for your service!
I love this picture of Joe Biden and his son Beau.
That's promising keep spreading the word we all got to work together no matter what state to get 45 gone and Biden in
Not to belittle any of the wonderful people on Biden‚Äôs short list ( I think they are all truly remarkable people ) or to take anything away from Biden himself but I‚Äôd vote for ANYONE before I‚Äôd vote tRump.
A vote for Trump is a vote for the United States of America.   A vote for Biden is a vote against the United States of America.
Yes bug him and distract him so Biden can crush 45 this November
I know people who have voted straight ticket Republican for 50 years who will be voting Biden this November. Your foolishness played right into the hands of the Radical Left Dems.

Riots in Chicago=distraction DC mass shooting=distraction (a really horrible one üò°) Trump on Mt. Rushmore=distraction Trump signing EOs w/o Congress=distraction Biden report=distraction  All of these are a distraction from Volume 5. FOCUS! The mob is very desperate!
A new poll puts former Vice President Joe Biden ahead of President Trump by nine points in PA, four points in MI, and six points in WI.
Over the weekend, the United States intelligence community stated that Russia is attempting to help President Trump win re-election in 2020, while China is hoping to boost Biden before November. More in this  clip.  13/x
"Big Tech Makes Inroads With the Biden Campaign" by BY DAVID MCCABE AND KENNETH P. VOGEL via NYT New York Times
Of course they do, Biden's a puppet. And you're a drunk skeleton Pelosi.
Joe Bidens entire campaign is Joe Biden denouncing the things that Joe Biden help start.
Brother Fucker Omar only wants mail in votes to cheat to get Biden elected and Trump out so the libtards can bring in communism. To avoid a rigged election go and vote in person, let your vote count.
Nothing today but your state needs Biden to get back to blue
The Democratic National Convention has released a new promo for their convention, which starts (virtually) on August 17th.   The promo features news clips from former competitors endorsing the Biden campaign.
I'm going Biden +3.If you‚Äôre voting #Biden &amp; you‚Äôre voting on Election Day I beseech you to go to the polls as soon as they open. With many worried about mail-in ballots due to Trump‚Äôs sabotage there could be extremely long lines later in the day. Your courage is admirable. Your vote is sacred.
I just begged my sisters to vote for Biden even though I absolutely disapprove of him. Get trump out of office.  Please.
I only hope that the Trump administration decides to spy on Biden and Harris just like the Obama administration did to Trump . I mean, come on ....what‚Äôs fair is fair?
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúWomen for Biden Convention Watch Party‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Biden, but work to help progressives down ballot in your state and others.
Vote your conscience but have solidarity with fellow leftists.  I stand in solidarity with #NeverBiden leftists.  I *am* a #NeverBiden leftist.  If you‚Äôre holding your nose for Biden, fine.  But don‚Äôt snipe at people who disagree.  It‚Äôs unwarranted character assassination.
My grandmother said that Biden "won't be able to control" Kamala Harris, and I'm just WOW.
Biden is the biggest fraud.
If #BidenHarris2020 happens, Its going to be a continuation of the status quo and the disastrous neoliberal corporatist politics for at least 8 years. Think about that..  Nothing will fundamentally change. Not under Trump. Not under Biden.  #GeneralStrike
Yeah Biden who is nearly brain dead will be great.  How can you vote for a man who is nearly 80 with undeniable symptoms of dementia.  ???
Did you actually thin Joe would make it to election day? Imagine the Bernie supporters if she ends up the head of the ticket. What does happen when polling goes south and Biden keeps losing his mind?
Unless you are hunkered down in a basement eating Tapioca and are unable to go out to groceries, big box retailers , etc. in which case u can apply for the Biden Absentee ballot!
With a parachute? Or are you that worried that Biden's gonna win?
Neither will this suburban housewife!!! Biden/Harris 2020üôåüôå
Respectfully, get out of my mentions, brother. I wish you well. We disagree about what needs to be done.  Your time would be better spent organizing for your candidate. You‚Äôre not going to win me over. Biden already lost my vote. Go hold your nose. I‚Äôll be voting my conscience.
By your vote shaming logic, every minute you‚Äôre not spending phone banking for Biden is a minute you‚Äôre spending phone banking for Trump.
If Biden wants swing state progressives, all he needs to do to get them is meet these popular and reasonable demands.
Braun is at his least believable when he says things like Biden/Harris represent a "radical left ticket of liberal anarchy."
Our country is already collapsing under your watch, and we are the laughing stock of the world. Biden will bring back civility, cooperation and compassion to our country. Unlike you, he will put the needs of the American people above his own needs.
You mean she‚Äôs not going to steal a speech from Jill Biden?
Jesse with Green ballot access would‚Äôve gotten a lot more than 5 percent. He‚Äôs the only independent candidate in 2020 who would‚Äôve had even a shot at beating Biden and Trump.
Lib Journos, especially  and  are too busy figuring out how to provide immense cover for Biden during the debates to cover the #Trump peace deal with UAE and Israel.
What they don't get also is that their "logic" works in reverse: Not voting or voting 3rd party means I'm not voting for Trump which means it's a vote for Biden. And on it goes
Antifa dot com lead you to a biden fundraiser until it went down due to it going viral on twitter
Some preemptive  &amp;  fact checking:  "Most pro-abortion ticket ever" Biden is a devout Catholic.  "Most anti-Israel ticket ever" Harris is married to a Jewish attorney. Her stepkids call her "Momala," a play on her name &amp; the Yiddish ‚ÄúMamaleh,‚Äù which means little mama.
Let it be known that I‚Äôm not happy about my options for president. I‚Äôve NEVER voted in a presidential election but I will cast my first vote for Biden bc I cannot handle another term w/trump &amp; pence.

If you want to know my thoughts on the false choice between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, this sums it up.  #NeverBiden #NeverTrump
Oh, so Trump‚Äôs train uses fossil fuels and just blows past the town spraying everyone with smoke. Biden is eco-friendly and you know will stop to talk to residents.
So, Herman Cain is tweeting out editorials against Biden and Harris this morning. You know, the guy who died two weeks ago, because of Trump.   Every time I want to say something is peak 2020, they raise the mountaintop on me.
If you don't think that Trump is losing his mind, you're not paying attention.
The insult added to injury: Joe Biden and crew have absolutely no chance to defeat Trumpism. Understand, we cannot just defeat the man. We have to toss the ideology in the scrapheap. That‚Äôs not going to happen under a ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù Biden administration.
Very unsafe speed for a train in a populated area! Biden responsible as always CC:
Trump: 'Nobody More Insulting to Biden Than' Harris Was  #Newsmax via
Let‚Äôs be honest, the DNC chose you because they knew Biden was going to lose. They needed to pick someone whose seat would go to a Democrat without fear of a Republican taking the seat. You are the sacrifice. üòÜ
So.... Biden is physically fit?
To be perfectly honest,  I think Biden picked her to 1. Help with the black vote and 2. Help with the woman vote. It's called pandering and he's pissed off some  black voters with some things he's said. To try and win some back, he chose a black(she's not) woman. My philosophy...
You might have a certain privilege if you are able to equate the cons of a Biden victory with the cons of a Trump victory.
There we have it: the confession before the crime. Janine is gonna do something to Biden. We are disappointed but never surprised by how low they'll go. Or shes dog whistling to her automatic weapon loving fans
Kamala was my first choice a year ago and she still is. I'll let others be Anti-Trump. I will be positive and support Biden-Harris.
Kamala really said this? And there are people who will vote for her and Biden? Not thinking long term, are they!
This is how screwed up Sleepy Joe is in the head.  Schools should teach America History &amp; Civics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Biden: Schools should ramp up 'Islamic faith' studies, Muslims must 'mobilize' against Trump  via
John Kasich still has influence in Republican politics.  He may well be able to put Ohio in play, and keep it there, for Biden.  And, if we want people to reach across the aisle, it‚Äôs good that he‚Äôs making the effort.  AOC can have more time without this cancel Kasich bs.
I WISH I could see the ‚ÄúList of Rules‚Äù that the ‚ÄúFree Press‚Äù had to abide by at Biden‚Äôs press conferences today!!!  Rumors are that they couldn‚Äôt show Harris in any state of emotion, nothing unflattering, not if her voice is raised, etc...   Trump is NEVER given that courtesy.
Sorry Kamala, liberals in California know you and now will not vote for Biden.   You two are made for each other, you don‚Äôt know where your going and have no idea what your doing.  The blind leading the blind.
Donna. I agree with you. I‚Äôm sure you know you have some haters and trolls on this feed. Keep up the good work. Go Biden\Harris.
I had to turn it off after three minutes. Joe Biden is a liar and a fraud! Kamala is no better, sending all those folks to jail while she sits there having the luxury to talk about smoking (and inhaling)! #DrainTheSwamp
If you google  it will take you to Biden / Harris website.                 That says it all.
Biden-Harris campaign launch uses the Style Council version of Move on Up to end their press conference. Hope Paul's ok with that.
Biden/Harris: At least we aren't Trump/Pence
Sick of dumb ass niggas...just last week they were posting black and white selfies on social media talking bout, "I'm such and such and I will never tear down another black woman/man...blah, blah, blah..." Biden chose Kamala and the bullshit started...üòë #BidenHarris2020
Biden speaks lies.
I hope Trump is seeing how many "suburban housewives" have turned out to see Biden/Harris!
I haven‚Äôt felt hope is so long till yesterday when Biden announced Harris as his running mate!! Finally! Evict Trump Nov 3!
since Kamala is a great counter to 2 of trump's big strategy points at this point in the election, she seems like she could quell some fears ppl have about biden. As opposed to him picking COMMIE YANG or another candidate that would be more appealing to me
Mmm. I think the difference is pretty big, cuz after all it's not about what republicans think, it's about independents, and having 2 of the most centrist dems being pres and VP helps nullify one of Trump's biggest attacks. Also "Cop"mala helps biden be more "law and order"
i used to think this, but also there's a huge chunk of the pop not being considered here -  independents, who biden is currently crushing it with  also keep in mind, Trump's main message is Biden is a far-left wing puppet, putting in a progressive VP would support that
Absolutely wrong. She is a complete opportunistic, hypocrite simply after leftist power. She tore into Biden and now will go out and praise him. Black America should see that and remember it. It‚Äôs her way.
I‚Äôve spoken via Zoom with independent presidential candidate Valerie McCray.  She‚Äôs a very friendly and knowledgeable person.  She‚Äôs a psychologist from Indianapolis.  I couldn‚Äôt support her because her politics just aren‚Äôt different enough from Biden, but I made a new friend.
Kamala called Joe Biden a "segregationist" last year. This is not going to go well for the democrats in the next 3 months.
No, I feel like we‚Äôre having a very friendly conversation. You seem like if you‚Äôre voting for Biden, you‚Äôre doing so under duress. I respect that. I‚Äôm not making the same choice, but I‚Äôm not going to vote shame you.
Mr. President, I am a life-long Republican.  I have never voted for a Democrat for president.  And that will change in November.  I will vote for Biden-Harris because it is the ONLY option that gives our nation a chance to find its way back.  No regrets voting for them!
I assume ‚Äúhonking‚Äù meant ‚Äúthinking‚Äù, in which case I absolutely am thinking long term.  Long term, Trumpism doesn‚Äôt end with Trump. The next Trump will likely be much shrewder and smarter.  And we‚Äôll have what to stand up to that next Trump? Biden? Harris? Really?!
Biden tells blacks how to vote.
Believe all women.  Then Biden is too.
~55K die yearly cuz they have no health insurance.  150K+ #COVID19 deaths.  Millions out of work and have lost health insurance.  Supermajorities of Dems, indies want #M4A. Most GOP want it, too.  That‚Äôs a lot of pressure already.  Biden still says even if we pass it, he‚Äôd veto.
Question for you: which policies of Joe Biden‚Äôs do you think will end the material conditions that produced Trumpism?
NEWS: Joe Biden has selected far-left liberal U.S. Senator Kamala Harris to be his running mate in the November election. Harris is known to oppose nearly every policy agenda IFI supports, and her record proves it.
If Biden is hiding his gaffes, Trump is not ashamed to put his own on full display nearly every single day.
Look I dislike everything Trump is. But biden clearly has some mental instability more so than Trump
I get that not everyone studies math that closely, but that‚Äôs not how this works at all.  I live in Indiana. A vote here for Mickey Mouse has as much effect on the Electoral College as a vote for Joe Biden, which is to say it has no effect at all.  But you know that.
Why are you agreeing to spread FALSE RUSSIAN propaganda about Biden? You are no longer a patriot of the U.S.  You are now complicit with Trump in working for the Russians, komrad Grassley!
Facts at first I‚Äôm like uhh kamala cause I do not care for Biden at all. But the. I‚Äôm thinking and I‚Äôm like Lauren look at the symbolism in this and what this mean for women, especially black women.
I‚Äôll admit it. I‚Äôm way more excited about Harris than I am Biden. She would have been my primary vote. I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs on the ticket #BidenHarris2020
Nope, definitely not about me. It‚Äôs about the 55,000 human beings who die every year because they don‚Äôt have health insurance.  Joe Biden told a room full of his wealthy donors nothing would fundamentally change for them, which means the status quo that got us Trump won‚Äôt end.
And don‚Äôt forget in non-sports news Biden has a VP. What a day for news. One I will never forget.
The mess that Biden made?
Not me. I said why are you wasting time in my mentions when you could be out organizing for Biden. Get to it!
If by "Keep America Great" you mean living in a country needlessly ravaged by a deadly virus that has killed more than 165K people, closed schools and caused economic calamity, I'll take radical left liberal anarchy and government-run healthcare all day long. Biden/Harris 2020!
Biden just lost by a wider margin than before
Vote your conscience. I‚Äôll vote mine.  Go organize for your candidate.  Every minute you spend not phone banking for Biden is a minute you spend phone banking for Trump.
Oh, for heaven‚Äôs sake. Is that one of Biden/Harris talking pts? TRUMP2020
Do you guys know where I can get a Biden yard sign around here?
Kamala Harris proves that politicians have zero values. Biden was accused of sexual assault and Harris said she believed the women who was assaulted. Then she accepts the VP slot. How can she reconcile this?
Can Dr. Jill Biden be First Lady &amp; Secretary of Education? üßêüßê
Biden-Harris.   On fire!
Biden/Harris = 4 More Years!!! A lifelong do nothing racist and a Senator from the worst state in the country. LMAO #Trump2020 #Trump2020Landslide #LiberalLogic
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
See this is what I'm talking!! I love you Bernie for supporting Biden/Harris!!! We need trump to go down!!
Carmel Dems are all in for Biden/Harris 2020! Let‚Äôs get to work.
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúNational Women for Biden Bimonthly Call‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
hoping that biden will be more progressive and effective if he wins and gets majority in congress
Hell at this point that might be just an old dude hugging the president. This shit is gonna get nuts in the next month or so. I‚Äôm still not convinced Trump and Biden will be the nominees. This is a goat fuck of mammoth proportions.
Because they don‚Äôt want Biden to. Duh. Obvious. Trumps asked like million times.
I support #Biden/Harris, you keep supporting these losers so we can vote you out in 2022, loser.
One more thing: it‚Äôs significant that Biden picked the woman who wasn‚Äôt afraid to call him out on a debate stage. We need more leaders who elevate people who challenge their thinking. Only weak people surround themselves with sycophants.
They need to just let the VPs debate and leave it at that because Trump will break Biden in half on national television in front of the world.
Can't wait for the debates!  I hope Biden debates Trump.  It will be good TV since college football is about gone.
obama was probably little more to the left but couldnt get anything done cause congress was more to the right, while is biden wins there will be a more progressive congress
2/2: Don‚Äôt be surprised if any of the ‚ÄòTrump ministers‚Äô says Biden will look for guidance from the Pope rather than the his cabinet.  They tried it with JFK and they not very creative.
Me walking up to vote for Biden and Harris
Biden picked Kamala. That might be the dumbest choice he could have made. She was terrible in the debates.  The fact that everyone knows she had an affair with the mayor to get her job will not win her any votes. Trump may seriously win 40 states, and I'm not rooting for him!
Joe Biden choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate is hilarious üòÇüòÇüòÇ 2 of the biggest idiots in politics
I do recall her calling Biden a racist on live TV. smh
Sleepy Joe Biden has done nothing in his 47 years in politics. He picked Kamala Harris as his VP. She is following Sleepy Joe‚Äôs footsteps. Kamala Harris has done nothing in her political career either.
Biden/Harris 2020!!!!! That is all.
Can I bet on Biden?
I totally called Harris being picked as Biden's VP months and months ago. As my prize, I get to vote for the least appealing presidential ticket I've ever voted for.
She's probably the most unlikable candidate possible.  Great news for Trump.  She locked up almost as many black men as Biden.
I‚Äôm a demsoc and a big Bernie supporter, but four more years of Trump will be a much farther setback for the movement than Biden.  You may be able to handle 4 more years of Trump, but others can‚Äôt afford it. He is a threat to our democratic institutions, basic rights, and health.
If you hate that the ticket is Biden/Harris, you should have showed up and voted for, Bernie, Pete, Warren or whomever you supported. Much needs to be fixed, but until there is record voter turnout in the primaries, we won‚Äôt see change. Put your privilege aside and vote in Nov!
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.
I wasn't super thrilled to vote  but I was because Trump is awful.  But seeing that  is Biden's running mate has me excited again.  Can't wait to watch her bring the smackdown on Pence during the VP debate.
IndyStar: Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his VP running mate
I am so excited about the pick of Kamala Harris as Vice Presidential runnning mate to Joe Biden.  This is a historic moment.  Call him courageous Joe!! Game On!
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate
i doubt harris would suddenly become less prominent like kaine if biden lost
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Omg I am so so happy!! Kamala will make a wonderful VP!!! Biden/Harris 2020!!
The mainstream media can say all day long that Trump is a racist but we all know who the real one is.  "You are not black if you don't vote for me".  How many insults are Black voters supposed to take from Joe Biden?
Omg is it true!!!! Biden picked Kamila Harris I am screaming!!!!
Biden/Harris we now have a Presidential Race!
Biden/Harris we now have a Presidential Race!
Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris as running mate!
Where‚Äôs my Biden-Harris yard sign?!
Yes because Bernie doesn‚Äôt take corporate PAC donations. Biden has more billionaire donors than Trump and somehow won the nomination despite having seemingly no visible support while Bernie had thousands of volunteers all over the country.
"Do not hold grudges" ‚Äî Joe Biden
Yeah, I love how the headline says "Joe Biden has selected..."   How much you wanna bet that's not true? üòÇüòÇ
Biden has played a significant role in what we find objectionable about the current state of things. I shared the original segment from Krystal Ball because she made good points far more eloquently than I, and I reply because I think your critique is off base.
But when I read these words, nothing he's saying is wrong....  So how exactly is this convince me NOT to vote for Biden?
Me voting for Biden so that Trump is out of the office
Yes, so unreasonable to question Biden mental fitness...any number of videos..
Hopefully it is going to be
Joe Biden selects his running mate with announcement coming as early as Tuesday
Calling out hypocrisy of ‚Äúvote blue no matter who crowd‚Äù who coalesced around a senile corporate stooge that has played a major role in every position liberals/progressives pretend to be against. Come on  , you‚Äôve never told me one policy you like from Biden or Harris.
I still say Biden won't be the nominee  so this is all a smoke show but, Who decides what is/isnt a mysoginist remark?
I mean Biden‚Äôs the same way then. Idk, I just think it‚Äôs a product of being in front of the camera all day, but maybe I‚Äôm wrong.
The American Dream will soon become the American Nightmare if the Dems get control of our government!
Come on corn pop!  Biden would probably be more comical though yes.
We must put country above party. That's what Kasich is doing. There are so many patriots who are doing the same thing. The Lincoln Project has been incredible. Republicans for Joe BIden too and so many more. The problem with most of the GOP right now is they aren't doing that.
If Biden names a woman VP candiate, as predicted, will your wife have to be on stage during the VP debate?
Truthfully not sure Biden can even pick his nose at this point.
#teamPete understood the #ROTR, so when Biden said he was going to select a woman for VP we were disappointed back then. Now when we hear private jet to DE, we Trust Biden not to go back on his word about VP so don‚Äôt have those expectations anymore.
Trump finishes his press conference after shots are fired at the White House. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is still living in his basement because he fears for his safety due to COVID. #TrumpIsTheGOAT
And yet he and his surrogates claim Biden is confused.
Greg wants us all to hide in our basements until Biden is elected. #Trump2020
You do realize all of your executive orders will be reversed by Joe Biden?
Voting for Biden no matter what. NO MATTER WHAT!
I‚Äôm on Biden‚Äôs shortlist of irrelevant Hoosiers. You can trace my car going directly to the Kroger tomorrow.
Against this nightmare of clowns and huge turnover, I‚Äôve been saying for weeks this is a Biden power move. He‚Äôs stacked with talent and people will vote deep because shallow didn‚Äôt work out so well.
Voting for Biden NO MATTER WHAT‚ù§
Go cry to daddy. Your upset Russia wants tRump and he is losing and China wants Biden. Waaaa
And people are questioning Biden‚Äôs mental acuity?
It would be great to hear the perspective of those that support Trump. I don‚Äôt want to hear why you won‚Äôt vote for Biden but rather why Trump gets your vote.
Biden who?
If you look at this chart, you will see that Trump is back to his approval rating before Covid hit. His supporters really aren't giving up on him. I just don't see how Biden can win.
He is definitely a clown, but the problem is that there are SO MANY videos of Biden touching kids inappropriately, and that will be enough for many people (mainly women) to not vote for him this fall. The DNC needs to consider another candidate if they want a chance to win.
Sure they are fed up, but there are no democrat leaders who are anti-abortion. That wipes out about 10-15 states of votes for democrats. There are still people out there who believe abortion is murder. Biden wins in a landslide if he says he will overturn Roe v Wade...
I'm not a maga, I'm a libertarian Trump is an asshole and Biden is senile. We, as hard working Americans, deserve much better than those two. I don't take politics that seriously, I hate all of them.
Biden has this city locked...
He can‚Äôt vote for Biden and claim to be a conservative
You know I've over-indexed on politics recently when I read #RIPKamala and my first thought was Joe Biden picked someone other than Kamala Harris as Veep rather than thinking about the Ugandan Giant!
Ummmm I don‚Äôt believe that Biden can get a bike to 30mph but nice try.
So what lies were made up there froggy? Biden is a lifelong politician who has done absolutely nothing. What makes you think he suddenly has the answers? You vote for Biden and within one year you‚Äôre stuck with who he picked because of race and gender. That‚Äôs f‚Äôn scary
Biden doesn't even remember Ferguson. Someone is writing his texts. Buying a gun this week. Haven't had one in 20 years but it's time to put my family first.
üòÇ I never heard the dementia accusation until that article.. I do recall them saying he was mentally unfit because they didn‚Äôt like his policies or his tone. Anyway.. Biden is a laughing stock.
You‚Äôre kidding right? It has been plainly proven that Obama and Biden knew of meddling in the 2016 election and chose to do nothing because they thought Hillary would win in a landslide. So don‚Äôt tell us a Joe Biden would do something. We know better
Lol. Your leader Obumma/Biden knew it in 2016 but felt that there was no way that Hillary would get beat so just let it go. Now you a holes want to try and spin it and pin it on Republicans? You guys are laughable
Anything and everything. I trust Ice more than joe Biden
The division was started with Obumma and Biden a decade ago. The media are all in on it. If not, then explain why the media shows pictures of black children who have been killed by police when the people are actually menacing adults. I.e Mike Brown
Wait... BIDEN is spreading false information?  JFC.  A vaccine in time for Election Day?  Wonder how many people the president chose to let die so he could hang on to this bombshell.
We recognize how big of a threat Trump is. We just understand that centrism has never beaten fascism. It only enables it. We recognize that Biden might beat Trump, but his politics has no hope of defeating Trumpism. And the next Trump the GOP puts forth might be intelligent.
It‚Äôs only going to get worse.   Republicans are selling America‚Äôs soul.
Let‚Äôs have a face-off!  All trump and Biden have to do is pronounce these words: Anonymous. Yosemite. Swift. Origin.  Winner gets to be Pres, ok?
This is his first term and he has done more for America than any other president in our generation. Check the federal registry! He is making America great! Either your living under a rock or Joe Biden‚Äôs ass is pressed against your lipsüôÑ.
And Biden step aside as well.
Joe Biden has one of the most amazing basements I've ever seen... and mine is pretty damn great.
Want to join me for this Joe Biden for President event?
Let‚Äôs see...no one knows who she is and she doesn‚Äôt help Biden win a state.  But neither does Harris, Bass (also an unknown) or Warren.  Sounds like a great choice though.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just pressure Joe Biden after he gets elected‚Äù ...  Uh, okay ... happy to try but if you mean through insider political means, that ain‚Äôt gonna work.  You need to get millions of people in the street to demand it.  #COVID19 wasn‚Äôt enough pressure. Joe is bought off.
And you represent a right wing racist, fascist regime either you as the messenger. I choose Biden!
Catholics don‚Äôt support abortion.  Biden does.  Case closed.
Listen to the clip. He did say it.  This post is the lie. Biden has already walked it back. Ah, the beauty of the democrat party, they don't mean what they say,  but they are able to imagine what republicans really mean when they make a simple comment.
If I don‚Äôt vote for Biden, then I‚Äôm voting for Trump. But if I don‚Äôt vote for Trump, then I‚Äôm voting for Biden. So, since that cancels out, I get to participate in democracy the way I‚Äôd like to by voting for the candidate whose values match mine. Sounds about right to me.
E-Mac I think that it's sad what has become of Joe Biden. Someone should step in and end this and let him retire in peace. I'm a Trump supporter and think he will beat Biden but he should not be running.
Yes.  Trump has huge scandals and isn‚Äôt taking COVID seriously.  At least I‚Äôm certain Biden would do a better job at risk mitigation of COVID, with better national strategy.  COVID is my biggest issue now.
China gained ground with Clinton and the Obumma regime. They are now up against strong tariffs and they are not happy. Of course they want Biden to win because they know the truth about Hunter

No one knows for sure how this is going to effect the voting.  Republicans think it will siphon minority and/or young votes from Biden.  There are just as likely discouraged R voters who don't like Trump, but won't vote for a Dem.
And if Biden somehow wins in November, EVERYTHING will magically open back up just fine in January.  And they'll probably give him a Nobel Peace Prize.
Thighland.  Brilliant.  Hope you don‚Äôt criticize Biden anytime soon‚Äîyou‚Äôve shit the bed on live tv more in the last 2 weeks than your depends can possibly hold.
The "you can't be Catholic and support Biden" has already started, much sooner than in the 2016 election cycle.  I cannot imagine the homilies we will have to endure in the weeks leading up to November.  It will be an exhausting 88 more days.
How‚Äôs your elite friends doing? We all know you and Biden got a dinner date to discuss the next plan and scheme. Just tell the people your all a hoax, people are catching on it‚Äôs all a shit show and reality tv condensation. Give us our government back it‚Äôs obvious both sides
Tonight!  Join Dr. Myers and Indiana for Joe Biden as we talk healthcare.
Idk why joe Biden‚Äôs managers let him even speak at this point LMAO. I hope to have the overflowing confidence of old white men one day
Kanye West indicates he is running for president to siphon votes from Joe Biden | Fox News
"After yesterday's edited version of his statement, Sleepy Joe Biden is no longer worthy of the Black Vote"
Ye getting weaponized as a GOP pawn to ticket split Biden is I guess where we‚Äôre at in 2020.
Biden clearly thinks blacks can‚Äôt make that decision. ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù And ‚ÄúBlacks aren‚Äôt diverse.‚Äù Meanwhile President Trump has made black lives better with lowest black unemployment, criminal reform and freedom and opportunity for ALL races. #Trump2020Landslide
It‚Äôs not an imaginary scenario. It‚Äôs an educated assumption. If you‚Äôre not willing to admit this is how most Biden endorsers operate, than you‚Äôre just as unable to admit when you‚Äôre wrong as trump is. Have a great day
Joe Biden is really out here trying to compete with George Washington for lowest total black vote
Yes, but if this was trump you would be throwing a fit. How are y‚Äôall not noticing how much Biden exposes your hypocrisyüò≠
Every time Repubes post about ‚Äúthat Biden video was *hard to watch*‚Äù I wonder to myself if they think it‚Äôs hard to watch the President ignore Russian bounties, or rail on about water pressure, or say Biden will ‚Äúhurt the Bible, hurt God‚Äù? You think this shit is *easy to watch*?
Biden can choose my oldest most battered garden gnome and it will possess more drive and intellectual agility than Trump's entire cabinet. And he'll have my vote regardless.
Biden is barely visible in his own campaign, has someone tweet his apologies for racism, transphobia, xenophobia, classism and ableism.  I hate it here
Yeah... lowering the age for Medicare to 60 and strengthening private insurance via ACA is totally halfway to single payer M4A...   Giving the police $300 million is totally halfway to defunding them...  What about Biden's policies makes you think he's met us "halfway?"
This was a just sad.
Joe Biden is a puppet. Let the man grieve over the loss of his family. He has yet to do that! He does not have the mental capacity to run a country. Let‚Äôs keep the current president he‚Äôs doing a fine job!
Fascinating article, Hunter. I came across this one today, too. I feel that from a political science POV, a center-right conception of a Christian Democratic party has no hope of breaking through. That politics is too close to what Joe Biden already is.

Have fun trying spreading your virus. Trump has and will continue to win. Haven't seen 1 Biden sign and just watched a Trump bost parade.
I mean holy shit , could you imagine if the orange man said this ?????? I mean I think Biden doesn‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs at most of the time but the dude is flat out saying racist nonsense now!!! Bye Joe!
Actual picture of Biden hurting god. Lol
I mean, if Joe Biden is THAT powerful do you want to risk voting against him? #BidenDiety
The post was about Obama and Biden being silent on TBE murders happening in Chicago. Which they have been . please feel green to link where Obama or uniden have commented.
Democrats think if they keep repeating all of this it‚Äôs going to change someone‚Äôs mind to vote for Joe Biden? Everyone knows the virus is China‚Äôs fault. We know the President Trump acted quickly and he was criticized by the Dems. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #WuhanCoronavirus
Watching Trump and Biden video clips on this here free website and thinking: "This ain't the best we can do...but this IS America."  phew.
The liberal aid that writes Biden‚Äôs tweets knows that without massive voting fraud, there is NO way he‚Äôs beating
p sure jon was actually asking for input and perspectives instead of asking a rhetorical question, which i think is how you took it lol. but ur answer was pretty insightful into biden's background for those who didn't know
CNN: Instagram's algorithm blocked negative coverage of Trump, but not Biden.   via
As an atheist, the small, petty god Donald Trump appears to worship makes no fucking sense. Omnipotent, but apparently able to be outsmarted by Joe Biden.
Biden has no fucking clue what he is saying man. Just pure nonsense
"..Unlike the African American community ... the Latino community is an incredibly diverse.." so the African American community is not diverse. Does that make it easier to understand what Biden was saying?
Biden seems to make a racist comment every other day ...
Biden can‚Äôt stand you!Our country will have a president one way or the other. Decide if you want stupidity and lies, or intelligent and not exactly what you want. Trump is destroying us, Biden has been around for a long time and hasn‚Äôt destroyed us yet. Vote Biden. Please!
Vote your conscience but have solidarity with fellow leftists.  I stand in solidarity with #NeverBiden leftists.  I *am* a #NeverBiden leftist.  If you‚Äôre holding your nose for Biden, fine.  But don‚Äôt snipe at people who disagree.  It‚Äôs unwarranted character assassination.
Oops.. the Biden parody song is from the band The Outfield. Song title is I don't wanna lose your love.
Whats also "out there" is your collusion with Kanye. So I guess. according to your standards, we should be looking into that as well?  No one campaigns harder for Biden/Harris than the Trump family.  They speak, Biden's numbers increase.
Biden is the biggest fraud.
We laugh at you/Tucker every night as you both continue to campaign for Joe Biden.  Keep up the sterling work, the both of you!!  +12 points today and growing. I cant wait to see how much we gain after this mini rally today where you talk about saving a war that wasnt happening
Respectfully, get out of my mentions, brother. I wish you well. We disagree about what needs to be done.  Your time would be better spent organizing for your candidate. You‚Äôre not going to win me over. Biden already lost my vote. Go hold your nose. I‚Äôll be voting my conscience.
By your vote shaming logic, every minute you‚Äôre not spending phone banking for Biden is a minute you‚Äôre spending phone banking for Trump.
If Biden wants swing state progressives, all he needs to do to get them is meet these popular and reasonable demands.
Evan I'd like to thank you for the work you are doing to help Joe Biden/Kamala Harris win in November. Every single time Republicans/Trumpers talk or act in an outright ignorant fashion like this, Joe's polling #'s go up. He is up 12 points today and with this pic, even higher
NOT EVEN KANYE is there!!!!  Biden's polling numbers are +12 today and the more they do ignorant things like this, the higher they will go, so please Republicans and Trumpers keep up this sterling work!!! We are counting on YOU to help elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Our country is already collapsing under your watch, and we are the laughing stock of the world. Biden will bring back civility, cooperation and compassion to our country. Unlike you, he will put the needs of the American people above his own needs.
You mean she‚Äôs not going to steal a speech from Jill Biden?
Trump - "Kamala is nasty" - "AOC is dumb" - "Elizabeth Warren is nasty"  So I'm confused - what is the common interest there Jared?  Keep talking.  Biden's poll numbers increase every time you speak.  Biden up 12 full points as of yesterday and with all the BS today, even more.
Jesse with Green ballot access would‚Äôve gotten a lot more than 5 percent. He‚Äôs the only independent candidate in 2020 who would‚Äôve had even a shot at beating Biden and Trump.
Let it be known that I‚Äôm not happy about my options for president. I‚Äôve NEVER voted in a presidential election but I will cast my first vote for Biden bc I cannot handle another term w/trump &amp; pence.
If you want to know my thoughts on the false choice between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, this sums it up.  #NeverBiden #NeverTrump
If you don't think that Trump is losing his mind, you're not paying attention.
The insult added to injury: Joe Biden and crew have absolutely no chance to defeat Trumpism. Understand, we cannot just defeat the man. We have to toss the ideology in the scrapheap. That‚Äôs not going to happen under a ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù Biden administration.
Kanye, who he is funding right this moment to take votes away from Biden. Which is illegal.
He has next to nothing to throw at Biden and Kamala. ‚ÄúBiden is mentally unfit‚Äù so is Trump. ‚ÄúBiden says racist things‚Äù so does Trump except Biden has Obama and now kamala. ‚ÄúKamala is a cop‚Äù trump wishes he had her criminal justice record. ‚ÄúThey are far left‚Äù no they arent
To be perfectly honest,  I think Biden picked her to 1. Help with the black vote and 2. Help with the woman vote. It's called pandering and he's pissed off some  black voters with some things he's said. To try and win some back, he chose a black(she's not) woman. My philosophy...
I know.  Then again, these rabid conservatives would have painted anyone Biden chose as a "Marxist".
If your looking for a laugh look at Lori Hendry's Twitter feed.  She has said that Kamala Harris isn't black, that Trump retweets her all the time, and that Joe Biden sexually assaults every women he ever met. Her greatest goal in life is to have her privates grabbed by any Trump
Im voting. Not for biden or trump.
I hope Trump is seeing how many "suburban housewives" have turned out to see Biden/Harris!
I haven‚Äôt felt hope is so long till yesterday when Biden announced Harris as his running mate!! Finally! Evict Trump Nov 3!
B4 Biden said he was going to choose a woman for his ticket, I was so hoping for Kamala! I can't wait for the vp debate! She is going to make pence sit like the dog he is!! She's going to rock it as our 1st woman veep! I wana be part of the #KHive Plz give her my Love, from Joy!
I‚Äôve spoken via Zoom with independent presidential candidate Valerie McCray.  She‚Äôs a very friendly and knowledgeable person.  She‚Äôs a psychologist from Indianapolis.  I couldn‚Äôt support her because her politics just aren‚Äôt different enough from Biden, but I made a new friend.
Kamala called Joe Biden a "segregationist" last year. This is not going to go well for the democrats in the next 3 months.
No, I feel like we‚Äôre having a very friendly conversation. You seem like if you‚Äôre voting for Biden, you‚Äôre doing so under duress. I respect that. I‚Äôm not making the same choice, but I‚Äôm not going to vote shame you.
I assume ‚Äúhonking‚Äù meant ‚Äúthinking‚Äù, in which case I absolutely am thinking long term.  Long term, Trumpism doesn‚Äôt end with Trump. The next Trump will likely be much shrewder and smarter.  And we‚Äôll have what to stand up to that next Trump? Biden? Harris? Really?!
~55K die yearly cuz they have no health insurance.  150K+ #COVID19 deaths.  Millions out of work and have lost health insurance.  Supermajorities of Dems, indies want #M4A. Most GOP want it, too.  That‚Äôs a lot of pressure already.  Biden still says even if we pass it, he‚Äôd veto.
Question for you: which policies of Joe Biden‚Äôs do you think will end the material conditions that produced Trumpism?
2 hours in on Fox and Friends, and they keep rolling the tape of Harris challenging Biden at the 1st debate. That is literally all Trump‚Äôs Buttsniffers have.Biden saw Harris‚Äô toughness and picked her for VP, anyway. How many times has Trump picked a critic for the greater good? 0
I look forward to NOT hearing a peep out of Fox "News" once Biden/Harris win.  I say this because if they start spouting off, they stand a great chance of being held accountable for their "news" putting people in danger.
Look I dislike everything Trump is. But biden clearly has some mental instability more so than Trump
Yea the green party has the platform that is closest to what id like but they sorta seem to have boned dario hunter. Still not gonna vote biden or trump tho ill figure out my 3rd party pick soon enough
Yep. But what was expected outta biden. Fuck both these tickets
I get that not everyone studies math that closely, but that‚Äôs not how this works at all.  I live in Indiana. A vote here for Mickey Mouse has as much effect on the Electoral College as a vote for Joe Biden, which is to say it has no effect at all.  But you know that.
Biden=trump
Between  and Dr. Jill Biden, NO ONE is getting through when they should not!!
Nope, definitely not about me. It‚Äôs about the 55,000 human beings who die every year because they don‚Äôt have health insurance.  Joe Biden told a room full of his wealthy donors nothing would fundamentally change for them, which means the status quo that got us Trump won‚Äôt end.
Not me. I said why are you wasting time in my mentions when you could be out organizing for Biden. Get to it!
Vote your conscience. I‚Äôll vote mine.  Go organize for your candidate.  Every minute you spend not phone banking for Biden is a minute you spend phone banking for Trump.
No Cory, she just wants to get rid of Trump sycophants like you who are party above people. I know you dont care but 160k+ Americans have died with more to come. Kamala and Joe Biden care and will actually DO something about it. I suggest LinkedIn when your time is up.
Biden-Harris.   On fire!
Trump or Biden. Period. We cannot afford to be divided now. Let's take our country back, then we can fight amongst ourselves, but if we don't do it now, we won't have country to fight in or the right to be able to. #BidenHarris2020
Hell at this point that might be just an old dude hugging the president. This shit is gonna get nuts in the next month or so. I‚Äôm still not convinced Trump and Biden will be the nominees. This is a goat fuck of mammoth proportions.
I support #Biden/Harris, you keep supporting these losers so we can vote you out in 2022, loser.
Me walking up to vote for Biden and Harris
Biden picked Kamala. That might be the dumbest choice he could have made. She was terrible in the debates.  The fact that everyone knows she had an affair with the mayor to get her job will not win her any votes. Trump may seriously win 40 states, and I'm not rooting for him!
approves of Kamala Harris.  Here is proof that he donated to her campaign not once but twice.  Cannot wait to hear him speak highly and approve of Biden's choice for running mate.  Or else Trump will look more of a fool than he already does. Hmm, let's watch what he does!
You are absolutely brilliant!  I nominate Kimberley Johnson for the Biden Cabinet!!! üëçüíØ
I totally called Harris being picked as Biden's VP months and months ago. As my prize, I get to vote for the least appealing presidential ticket I've ever voted for.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Omg I am so so happy!! Kamala will make a wonderful VP!!! Biden/Harris 2020!!
Yes and yes, a really good sign.  Particularly happy that Biden choose the better choice, not the one he was most familiar with.
Now that we know it‚Äôs Kamala, I can‚Äôt wait for the debate. She will chew Pence up and spit him out. She destroyed Barr in the AG hearing. I said a year ago when Trump got impeached trying to sabotage Biden‚Äôs campaign, this is the best ticket.
Omg is it true!!!! Biden picked Kamila Harris I am screaming!!!!
Looks like Biden has Harris legs now! üòÇ
Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris as running mate!
Yes because Bernie doesn‚Äôt take corporate PAC donations. Biden has more billionaire donors than Trump and somehow won the nomination despite having seemingly no visible support while Bernie had thousands of volunteers all over the country.
Biden has played a significant role in what we find objectionable about the current state of things. I shared the original segment from Krystal Ball because she made good points far more eloquently than I, and I reply because I think your critique is off base.
Me voting for Biden so that Trump is out of the office
Yes, so unreasonable to question Biden mental fitness...any number of videos..
Actually that number represents white men who are CEO's of corporations more than anything. They love their money and they they know Trump will help them keep it. Its does not represent all of us, thank God!! I'll be voting Biden.
Calling out hypocrisy of ‚Äúvote blue no matter who crowd‚Äù who coalesced around a senile corporate stooge that has played a major role in every position liberals/progressives pretend to be against. Come on  , you‚Äôve never told me one policy you like from Biden or Harris.
I guess it depends on how you look at it. Biden goes to church and has an issue with one of the Catholic beliefs. Trump spends all his time at his golf courses, when he‚Äôs  not being Putin‚Äôs wife or writing love letters to Kim Jung UN. I‚Äôm not the one with a comprehension issue.
#teamPete understood the #ROTR, so when Biden said he was going to select a woman for VP we were disappointed back then. Now when we hear private jet to DE, we Trust Biden not to go back on his word about VP so don‚Äôt have those expectations anymore.
I hear you. But it is possible that trump did unintentionally make the mistake. He is obviously very driven to prove his cognitive abilities and show his superiority to Biden. He might not do this intentionally.
You do realize all of your executive orders will be reversed by Joe Biden?
When Biden announces his VP pick, he should just announce the entire Cabinet, and it will be like Avengers Assembling to save the world. It would be a beautiful moment for sure.
As long as Trump keeps talking, Biden has nothing to worry about.  And Trump cannot shut up to save his life.
And people are questioning Biden‚Äôs mental acuity?
Biden who?
If you look at this chart, you will see that Trump is back to his approval rating before Covid hit. His supporters really aren't giving up on him. I just don't see how Biden can win.
He is definitely a clown, but the problem is that there are SO MANY videos of Biden touching kids inappropriately, and that will be enough for many people (mainly women) to not vote for him this fall. The DNC needs to consider another candidate if they want a chance to win.
Sure they are fed up, but there are no democrat leaders who are anti-abortion. That wipes out about 10-15 states of votes for democrats. There are still people out there who believe abortion is murder. Biden wins in a landslide if he says he will overturn Roe v Wade...
I'm not a maga, I'm a libertarian Trump is an asshole and Biden is senile. We, as hard working Americans, deserve much better than those two. I don't take politics that seriously, I hate all of them.
It‚Äôs not do nothing see Bush Sr, Cheney, Biden, Pence. They are the gateway to Congress. Those 200 judges aren‚Äôt being tee‚Äôd up by Trump. That‚Äôs all Pence.
If it does they aren‚Äôt voting for Biden.
Biden has this city locked...
Biden continues today to fight his tendency to stutter.  Republicans (FOX) plays up this as if it‚Äôs dementia instead of the speech impediment he has fought his entire life.
So that means  approves of Joe Biden then, cool.  I guess he's backing Biden because he is pissed that his Dad loves Kanye more than him!!
President Joe Biden
üòÇ I never heard the dementia accusation until that article.. I do recall them saying he was mentally unfit because they didn‚Äôt like his policies or his tone. Anyway.. Biden is a laughing stock.
Mueller said POTUS Capone is exempt from our laws while he‚Äôs POTUS.The next day,Trump committed extortion in broad daylight by trying to get Ukraine Prez,to announce an investigation on Biden.Mueller essentially said if he weren‚Äôt POTUS, he‚Äôd be indicted. Lies are facts to Trump
Pastor, I'm curious to hear your examples as to how he has "powerfully ran this country". No response to Covid as of yet, he has released felons twice on Fridays, he just publicly judged Mr. Biden as a non-Christian and you and I know that judging is God's not ours. Examples pls?
Biden not announcing his VP yet is absolutely messing with the Republicans heads. They will have little time to get their hate ads put together, nor will they have time to prepare Trump for any debate.  Utter genius on Biden's part.
We recognize how big of a threat Trump is. We just understand that centrism has never beaten fascism. It only enables it. We recognize that Biden might beat Trump, but his politics has no hope of defeating Trumpism. And the next Trump the GOP puts forth might be intelligent.
I will wear a bike helmet if I am riding fast, say beyond 10 mph. Or in a busy city like Chicago streets. But if it‚Äôs a casual, slow ride and in rural areas, no. Biden‚Äôs ride looks like the slower rural variety.
And Biden step aside as well.
Biden's first press conference should be like an episode of Oprah. Televised live and he should publicly fire all of Trumps Cronies.  "AG Barr, your fired, Postmaster, your fired too, Birx, your fired!" America would rejoice in that cleansing moment - and they all deserve it.
Mail in ballots should now be hand delivered to your county clerk. That is truly the only way you are ensured your vote will be counted. I cant wait until Biden wins and we can go back to having systems that work for Americans instead of for Trump only.
All Biden has to do for the REST of his presidency is play any of the millions of videos or sound bites of Trump and say, "Need I say any more to explain why we are here?"
That's called the Affordable Care Act that Obama created and Trump has spent 3 1/2 years trying to burn down. Now he wants to act like it was his idea. He just endorsed an Obama bill AT HIS OWN RALLY! Nobody helps Joe Biden more than Donald Trump. See ya on 11/03/2020!!
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just pressure Joe Biden after he gets elected‚Äù ...  Uh, okay ... happy to try but if you mean through insider political means, that ain‚Äôt gonna work.  You need to get millions of people in the street to demand it.  #COVID19 wasn‚Äôt enough pressure. Joe is bought off.
And you represent a right wing racist, fascist regime either you as the messenger. I choose Biden!
So Biden isn‚Äôt allowed to disagree with the issue of abortion and a woman‚Äôs right to choose, which IS LEGAL, but the ‚ÄúWalking Sin Machine‚Äù in the WH gets a pass?
Who said I supported Biden? Fuck him too.
If I don‚Äôt vote for Biden, then I‚Äôm voting for Trump. But if I don‚Äôt vote for Trump, then I‚Äôm voting for Biden. So, since that cancels out, I get to participate in democracy the way I‚Äôd like to by voting for the candidate whose values match mine. Sounds about right to me.
1992..Clinton...OMG they‚Äôre going to take our guns!!! 2008...Obama...OMG they‚Äôre going to take our guns!!! 2020...Biden...OMG they‚Äôre going to take our guns!!! 3 different decades...Same BS
And if Biden somehow wins in November, EVERYTHING will magically open back up just fine in January.  And they'll probably give him a Nobel Peace Prize.
Kanye West indicates he is running for president to siphon votes from Joe Biden | Fox News
I wish you were the Democratic nominee. I cannot in good conscious vote for Trump or Biden. This may be the first year I won‚Äôt vote. I don‚Äôt feel I have a good choice from either party.
Yes Dan, unlike your Satan Worshipping Messiah, Biden is still very much Moderate. The problem with the GOP is, you‚Äôve traded in your allegiance to Lincoln, in exchange for an Ouija Board for your Faith. Look at Falwell as an example. Good pic with his pants unzipped, wasn‚Äôt it?
Don't worry you've sicked Kanye on them. Joe will certainly never get a single black vote now right????  After all, you've done more for black people than anyone, right? and Joe Biden isn't Catholic, right? And Covid has disappeared, right? And the new health care plan is out?
Biden clearly thinks blacks can‚Äôt make that decision. ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù And ‚ÄúBlacks aren‚Äôt diverse.‚Äù Meanwhile President Trump has made black lives better with lowest black unemployment, criminal reform and freedom and opportunity for ALL races. #Trump2020Landslide
It‚Äôs not an imaginary scenario. It‚Äôs an educated assumption. If you‚Äôre not willing to admit this is how most Biden endorsers operate, than you‚Äôre just as unable to admit when you‚Äôre wrong as trump is. Have a great day
Yes, but if this was trump you would be throwing a fit. How are y‚Äôall not noticing how much Biden exposes your hypocrisyüò≠
Biden can choose my oldest most battered garden gnome and it will possess more drive and intellectual agility than Trump's entire cabinet. And he'll have my vote regardless.
Fascinating article, Hunter. I came across this one today, too. I feel that from a political science POV, a center-right conception of a Christian Democratic party has no hope of breaking through. That politics is too close to what Joe Biden already is.
Have fun trying spreading your virus. Trump has and will continue to win. Haven't seen 1 Biden sign and just watched a Trump bost parade.
I work as a nurse with the disabled population. Our dsp workers are angels on earth. #whyillvote biden
The post was about Obama and Biden being silent on TBE murders happening in Chicago. Which they have been . please feel green to link where Obama or uniden have commented.
This was just a segment on MTP daily. Some Republicans in Ohio telling Biden who he has to pick for him to win his vote. I started laughing.  People who will vote for Trump anyway.
So the guy who cheated on 3 wives, hundreds of times, holds a Bible upside down because he‚Äôs never opened one, and commits extortion and Launders Money more often than normal people drink water, is telling us that Biden is Godless? Enjoy Hell Donnie.
Sorry but any vote not used or not used for Joe Biden is a Trump vote. So you have to ask yourself, is any one VP pick WORSE than 150k+ dead Americans?  I'd be interested in your response.
This man just claimed Joe Biden isn't a Christian. How long do you think God will stand for that without having something to say in it?
Democrats think if they keep repeating all of this it‚Äôs going to change someone‚Äôs mind to vote for Joe Biden? Everyone knows the virus is China‚Äôs fault. We know the President Trump acted quickly and he was criticized by the Dems. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #WuhanCoronavirus
The liberal aid that writes Biden‚Äôs tweets knows that without massive voting fraud, there is NO way he‚Äôs beating
Its time MAGA's. Your President just called Joe Biden "a hurter of the Bible and a man who hates God". You claim to be Christians. What do you do next?  I know what the Bible says you must do.  Do you?  I hope so!!! Your eternity depends on it!!!  Choose wisely.
Keep on judging people like you are, calling Joe Biden godless, and God will want to speak with you really quickly. I know you are unfamiliar with the Bible, but judging is God's to do, not yours. God will not be mocked.  Keep it up at your eternitys risk. Money is useless to God
He keeps playing around like this and God will talk with him immediately.  He will not like the outcome, guaranteed. Jesus makes it clear we are not to judge others. Here is the President calling Joe Biden "against God" Every true Christian RIGHT NOW must walk away from Trump.
Biden has no fucking clue what he is saying man. Just pure nonsense
"..Unlike the African American community ... the Latino community is an incredibly diverse.." so the African American community is not diverse. Does that make it easier to understand what Biden was saying?
Biden can‚Äôt stand you!Biden attends church regularly.  Trump had peaceful protestors teargassed so that he could use a bible as a prop outside of a church for a photo op.
Very unsafe speed for a train in a populated area! Biden responsible as always CC:

It has been different.  I can imagine how hard it must be for Trump to draw a contrast between himself and someone who rarely comes out of his house.  I understand why they don‚Äôt want Biden to come out but it definitely makes it hard to compare and contrast.
STARTING TODAY : FACEBOOK AND TWITTER HAVE REMOVED ALL THE PRESIDENTIAL ADS UNTIL NOV 1 , 2020 ! ISN'T THAT A COINCIDENCE ! NOT BIDEN !Sooo when he implemented a travel ban on China whitch resulted in Biden calling him racist, that wasn‚Äôt cautious

Biden and Harris are the same-old shit with different identity, progressive rhetoric, no soul, and no humanity.  Will I vote in 2020? Probably. But if you deny this as a valid way of thinking, just because 45 is terrible, you have no clue what the working class is experiencing.
Why am I expected to vote for someone whose platform is on record as being "nothing will fundamentally change"?  I want fundamental change.  I want humane treatment.  I demand something different from what I've known my entire life.  Biden and Harris offer NONE of that.
I am not looking to be edgy, confrontational, or provocative.   My list of reasons to vote for a Biden-Harris ticket are dwindling.  What has democracy and capitalism done for me and other working-class people, that defends their lack of clear, pro-worker initiatives?
That one asks this question shows the success of a dubious canard against tactical voting that's been promulgated &amp; fed by the problematic myth of American individualism.   Trump's an existential threat to our republic. Right now, Biden's our best hope. That's all one need know.
Anyone who says Biden and Trump are the same are pretty much beyond hope, blinded by ignorance, agenda, or both.
I was disappointed that you were not picked as the VP. However I do respect the choice that was picked. I hope and pray you are asked to be part of the Biden administration hopefully when Biden is elected. I‚Äôm thinking the National Security Advisor, or the US

My state is full of them. I got messages from a few friends in my local LGBT community saying that they‚Äôre voting for Trump because Biden didn‚Äôt pick Bernie or AOC for VP. A few guys I‚Äôve run into lately are Trump supporters also.
Unlike Biden! The GOP approach is Psuedoscience posing as science.
Excuse me! Biden used the Pandemic Response Team‚Äôs Plan! No bleach involved!
‚ÄúEvery single American should be wearing a mask when they‚Äôre outside for the next three months at a minimum ‚Äî every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing," Biden declared.

If the internet is to be believed, voting third party is:  1) a vote for Trump 2) a vote for Biden 3) a vote for the devil 4) a vote for Al Qaeda 5) a vote for the KKK 6) a vote for Putin  It's like 6 votes in 1!
Bloomberg dropping out helped Biden a lot. This isn't that hard to figure out.

Just another thing for Biden to straighten out
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to ‚Äî wait for it ‚Äî Russia
Biden raised $26 million in the day after he named Kamala Harris as his running mate, doubling his previous one-day record and signaling enthusiasm among Democrats following the selection of the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket.
If we get them out, it‚Äôs a moot point! Biden funds the USPS, gets rid of the billionaire tax breaks, even playing field!
A lot of the Stuff you want me to believe Biden said is fake! So, I am cool with your faking! A lot of stuff Trump said, he keeps saying! You need to lay off the QAnon!
If Biden gets in, Rudy is going to jail!
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris pushed past their one-time political rivalry Wednesday to deliver an aggressive attack on the character and performance of President Donald Trump in their historic first appearance as running mates.
Do you know what Biden has done during his political career?
I Got several messages from friends in my local LGBTQ community saying that Biden made a mistake in picking Kamala and that they‚Äôre either voting Trump or sitting out this election in November. Indiana sucks.  I‚Äôm also working on my first Fanfiction in 15 years.
Make no mistake, Joe Biden is far far far far worse, even far worse than Hillary.
The river lights from Joe Biden's attack ad
Which polls, and at what times during the election?  Because in the election I remember watching, Biden was so unpopular that he had to skip an entire primary, won in SC, and then had everyone save Sanders and Warren drop to support him immediately before Super Tuesday.
Guys...i think that's his daughter. And she's a Biden supporter too...ü§£ü§£ ...And supported Hilary..Love this gal....!
Gretchen Whitmer supposedly withdrew herself from VP consideration and told Biden to select a woman of color.
Wasn't Biden on the ticket with Obama? Hmmmmmm.....

"Pete Buttigieg will deliver his speech live from South Bend, Ind., from a city landmark ahead of Biden's acceptance speech on Thursday night." via /r/Pete_Buttigieg  #PeteForAmerica #Pete2020
He endorsed Biden because the party told him to. If you think any different, I have a bridge to sell you in the Sahara. He did this even though the party and all of its organs deliberately undermined him treated him like a nobody. Weak.
Change the channel and ignore him. Let's go Biden/Harris!

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Pretty weird to think that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are speaking to an empty room right now #2020Election
#NEW: Sen. Kamala Harris takes the stage after Biden's introduction.  "Thank you, Joe. As I said when you called me, I am incredibly honored by this responsibility. And I'm ready to get to work."
#NEW: Biden says, "One of the reasons I chose Kamala, is because we both believe that we can define America simply in one word: possibilities... that's America."
I was always going to vote for  Biden but now I am energized to do more...everything I can to help GOTV for this ticket.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are speaking together for the first time as running mates from Delaware. Watch live on air or on Facebook:
Well, at least he know why we are voting for Biden!
I understand not being thrilled with Biden and/or Harris but if you mostly align with the dem platform, a libertarian is really going to disappoint you.
We‚Äôre minutes away from Biden/Harris first rally. #BidenHarris2020
We‚Äôre minutes away from Biden/Harris first rally
That confrontation may have clinched her the VP way back then. Biden imagined what it'd be like to have her on his side.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs good on her feet and I think one of the reasons Joe Biden picked her is he had to debate her, and he knew it wasn‚Äôt easy,‚Äù Kildee said.
üò≥ would you rather Biden tho honestly lol because both suck but Biden is like....yikes lol can we just get through four more years of red hats lol and probably have two more terrible choices next election haha
VP Pence congratulated Harris' nomination and was quick to criticize her position on several issues. "I mean, we all know, look, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left."
The fact that alternatives to Trump or Biden do exist isn't arcane knowledge, it's stuff anyone could just remember from watching the election or find out for the first time via 30-second Google Search.
We do. Plenty of progressive policies that get ignored, multiple progressive candidates in the primaries (Biden wasn't in the discussion until the entire field mysteriously dropped under him), or they're third parties "who'll never win" because They're Not Supposed To.
Joe Biden is a fraud that doesn't give a shit about any of us. Also Russia told me to say this. Clowns.
She didn't get traction because much of the Democratic Party sees her as a cop. Which she was. It's not that she was too far left - it's that she wasn't far left enough, and others were better at campaigning to the center (Biden, Buttigieg)
This comment sounds as though it was intended to protect Biden.
"progressive radical" ü§£ Sorry. Progressive radicals know Harris isn't one.  Republicans paint every Democrat as a "progressive radical" - it's the standard playbook. It's never been true.  I could not be more disappointed in Biden/Harris. Too tame. Still voting for them though.
I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs all whit3 men who are refusing to vote for Biden/Harris...
I doubt that Biden picked her. I think she was picked for him by the DNC. I believe that he is incapable of making such a decision.
Biden was asked to commit to choosing a woman VP on live TV and said yes, then he was asked to commit to choosing a black woman and said no. Take that how you will. I'm voting BIDEN-HARRIS-2020
Where do I get my Biden Harris yard sign?????

I think he planned a storytelling first campaign for a reason. I grew up in his town. Hes wildly intelligent and doesnt do things on accident. I have a feeling he knew damn well what he was doing and will be planning on something big soon. An advisory role w/Biden maybe to start.
Takes are all over the place. But the choice it‚Äôs pretty simple Biden or trump. If you want trump to remain in office, say that. Otherwise, please STFU until November 4th! #BidenHarris2020
Biden IS a Catholic period! Harris is a Babtist: Period!
I wish! They will thank her for her fundraising! If Biden loses, she will be as Hillary! As an African American woman , this saddens me!
Ever wanted to do something but something or someone makes you do the total opposite? Well that‚Äôs what happened to Biden today. The Mob attacked him saying he needed to pick a women who is African-American. I know he wanted Whitmer but it‚Äôs Phony Kamala and Sleepy Joe.
This is what Gov. Whitmer had to say about Kamala Harris being named Joe Biden's running mate. READ MORE:
HAPPENING TODAY:  Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris will speak today...together.
this is what I'm talking about, biden won't save us from this situation.
Because Trump is hurting himself more than anything Biden might say could hurt Trump. That's a reason to stand back and let Trump disgust voters. But it doesn't follow that refusing to debate is either smart politics or good for our increasingly insufferable political discourse.
For all of those that don‚Äôt agree about Biden/Harris, we all have opinions and freedom of speech. Agree or disagree with my Tweets is fine with me. Bottom line Vote! Be blessed ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠

Judging from the fact that this is the line of attack they're going with, Biden seems to have made a politically shrewd selection, at least.

I wouldn't be running in this race because I just declared myself Joe Biden's VP.
I've been saying I'd vote for a hot bag of vomit if it meant trump would leave, Biden and Harris are a way better choice!
They'll just deny it when questioned about it.  Apparently Biden is worried he'll lose California?  ü§£
I would probably be MORE willing to vote for Biden and Harris if they did drugs, hung out with gangsters, and were sexually liberated. We love that real-world experience
Joe Biden should schedule a presser every day at the same time as Donny DollHands.
Biden/Harris Ticket are you happy with his choice? We are absolutely happy with this choice. We can no longer have the current President for 4 more years. So please! Let's alley out to vote on Nov 3 2020. We need 3 things on Nov 3rd. 1. Biden/Kamala Victory 2. Defeat Trump 3.God
President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was ‚Äúa little surprised‚Äù that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, had selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.

Kamala Harris lmao, so they do have somewhat of a plan. Biden isn‚Äôt going to make it through a full term so all these Dems will vote for Biden to somehow win then push him out the door when he succumbs to his dementia and Harris becomes the first female president.
So who else is excited about Joe Biden's V. P.  Pick? We are Super excited and can't wait to watch Trump/Pence get the living shit kicked out them in November! We all need to vote now more than ever.  #BidenHarris2020

Has Joe Biden been informed of his choice yet??
kamala is jamaican and indian.  Where does this help Biden
There is no reason to moan about the VP pick.  There were so many excellent possible running mates...I actually had three choices I liked about equally.  And the others Biden didn't pick could be useful in his administration.
Yeah I don't have an answer. I'm not excited, but I'm not about Biden either.  I'm for damn sure voting for them though.
So in case you all are wondering about Kamala Harris 's ethnicity.  As much as she wants to be African-American she is Indian - Jamaican. Poor Joe Biden as confused as he is mayb he thought he was picking an African-American. #mysouthbend

You forgot Joe biden has accusers too. At some point you need to know dem and gop are one party with two ends. It's a big club and you ain't in it.

Trump is winning this easy. When he won when he had 38% in this kind of polls this time he has 47%.   He is a magic man will win easily.   My prediction electoral college   Trump- 334 Biden- 205  Popular vote   Trump- 55.7% Biden- 39%
If Trump wins this November, media,etc will continue forcing panic for four more years.  If Biden wins, same outlets will suddenly proclaim the virus is dying off.
I agree that Trump is uniquely horrible (except in some areas of foreign policy) but things are not going to magically get better simply because Joe Biden gets into office.

that isn't "blaming hillary". the polls had her 70-30 over trump and he won. they show biden 70-30 over trump. see where this is going?  that's the biggest problem. the goal shouldn't be to "get trump out" and "vote blue no matter who". that's how you end up with someone worse.

. joins Steve Shine to discuss Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP choice and his bill on qualified immunity
I believe we have walked into a new dimension, now that Biden has made an outstanding choice...  We MUST ALL VOTE, NO MATTER WHAT THE POLLS SHOW... VOTE, VOTE, VOTE
After watching her flip flop on Medicare for all and come off as incredibly phony at the debates with her preplanned one liners I look forward to seeing her lose 2024 to Andrew Yang.  That being said she makes Joe a Biden much more palatable.
Can‚Äôt wait to vote for team Biden Harris.
Now that Mr Biden has a veep candidate, do we get to start picking his administration?
i‚Äôm laughing so hard fuck biden and fuck kamala. if i had qualms about not casting a vote for president this november those qualms are now completely gone. i cannot in good conscience vote for either of the two presidential candidates. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
If Biden's strat is to just shut up and let the race baiting fascists remind everyone what we're voting against, it's working on me. I'd vote for an old shoe if it ran against race baiting fascists, but if they're gonna be loud bc of Kamala, I guess that energizes me even more.
So it took just over an hour after Biden announced Harris as his VP pick for Trump to call her ‚Äúnasty‚Äù.
No lie election night is going to be so got damn fun lol. Idk who will lose their fucking minds more! People losing it if Trump gets re-elected or the Trump fan boys losing and Biden gets the W Ahahhah. I can‚Äôt wait.
Law and order? Biden? Dems? Have you lost your ever loving mind? They are the opposite
Remember patriots, that Biden is a pawn and placeholder! He is faking dementia to lead up to a replacement and escape prosecution! Whomever is chosen to be running later, it is the same! Probably will be someone sinister but charismatic #dontbefooled
NBC News reports: "President Trump criticized Sen. Harris on Tuesday, for past comments she made about Joe Biden shortly after she was announced as Biden's running mate.  ‚ÄúI was a little surprised that he picked her.""
I‚Äôm not really a Shaun King fan and a Biden/Harris ticket wouldn‚Äôt have been my first choice. But switching to support whatever nominee can get us the hell out of this shit show is not something to frown upon.
This is a bad move.  Biden was going to win California anyway.  I would like to have seen him choose a swing-state running mate.
Union Worker Responds to Biden's Threat Against "AR-14"  via
No but from now on Kamala will be the face of bidens campaign.  She will be the one trotted out on the talk shows and be the primary speaker at engagements because Biden isn't, obviously, capable of getting thru anything without a gaff.
Biden should release his whole cabinet plans next.  Let‚Äôs vote them all in! Show everyone what the ticket holds and what a real government would look like again. #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris #BidenVP #JoeBiden #Biden2020
No doubt those voting for Trump out of spite and resorting to hate speech are going the wrong direction, but Biden's neo-liberal VP selection, watered down progressivism platform and his supporters bullying of the left wing to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho isn't a "unified front" either.
I hope Jason Sudekis is the perm Joe Biden though.
Trump, Pence, Biden and Kamala can all suck my dick idc. Glog glock 3000 on it cause I hate all them mfers
There‚Äôs no way in hell I‚Äôm voting for Biden, but this seems way out of context and very misleading.
Men like biden think they can act the way they do because of women like kamala. Remember her past.
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Yeah, bully the progressive wing. That totally helped Clinton in 2016... oh wait, that's right it DIDN'T! Uninspiring, counterfeit liberals like Clinton, Biden and Harris are the exact reason we lost in 2016 and sadly will lose in 2020.
Same for me. It‚Äôs a stress relief! I couldn‚Äôt have guessed I would have felt so strongly about things today myself. Now we know exactly who our team leaders are and what we have to do. Biden/Harris 2020!!
Well she has a lack of substance to match the shallowness of Biden. A middle finger to the progressive wing of the party that guarantees another disastrous 4 years of the orange idiot like 2016. The Dems just can't learn their lesson can they?
I'll bet more folks will watch this debate then Biden/Trump debate
Well, he already sold his soul to Joe Biden.  He's more concerned about his "legacy" than about what is really happening to people, I'm afraid.  Why rail against "politics as usual" and then meekly accept it when they gang up on you to stop you?
Yup shows that when Biden needs her too Kamala will call his ass out and that is what we ultimately need
This biden clown look needs to be edited over his clips where he talks about cocaine and spaghetti sauce.
My official response to Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his running mate
But she tried proving to the whole country how racist Joe Biden really is, yet hops right on with him. #PhonyKamalaHarris
Biden Harris is no different than Clinton Kaine. Both women wear the pants.

Kamala Harris is NOT BLACK PEOPLE  BIDEN SAID IT WOULD BE A BLACK PERSON. HE JUST PROVED HE LIED AGAIN TO HIS SUPPORTERS. SHE IS NOT A BLACK WOMEN. And she put more blacks in PRISON
So Biden Picked Willie brown's Hoe for VP...My only question is does Joe Get the same payment and does he have to wait until elected or does he get some up front?

She hates black people maybe more than Joe Biden. We need that Dave Chappelle skit and have the white people take her to their side.
This image is fake.  Biden‚Äôs staff no longer allows him to interact with people of color.
You mistake me voting for someone, as liking them. Me not voting does absolutely nothing. Me voting for Trump, goes against everything that I believe in. Me voting for Biden/Harris is only to get Trump out. That's it.
is definitely not leaving office peacefully this November if he loses to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris lol
A lot of people think the Establishment picking #KamalaHarris as #Biden's VP is a winning strategy, apparently. Mmmm. They chose a cop with a history of corruption in the middle of a populace uprising over police corruption / violence.  No. #BlackLivesMatter
Kamala Harris chosen as Biden's running mate...  Here is the proper time to use this statement...  Hopefully, George is looking down right now and saying: ‚ÄúThis is a great thing happening for our country,‚Äù
Kamala Harris Hates Black people maybe more than Joe Biden.
If I were Biden I'd announce that unless Trump gets within five points, no debate.  Doesn't want to waste time debating an also ran.  It would drive Trump crazy.
I feel like we‚Äôre going to repeat the last election because obviously a lot of people aren‚Äôt voting for Cheeto and everyone‚Äôs against Biden due to his past and his mental health.   Soooo....
Joe Biden chooses Kamala Harris to be his running mate. Somewhere between the #B1G announcement and the #Pac12 announcement.
This nigga Biden bro üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠II BET
Exactly what I tell everyone who still is Trump-leaning. Biden will surround himself with Experts and Professionals, not Yes-men!
We need to acknowledge the shortcomings of those vying to represent us, however much they are a better choice than the alternative, Biden and Harris have a lot to answer for, and they need to own that. Yes push forward, but also hold them accountable.
Excited for Biden/Harris to take office so that liberals can go back to not caring about police and feds beating protesters, cause in the end all that matters to them is optics.
Anyway Kamala will guarantee Biden wins by fighting Trump/Pence with facts and reason, something that is proven to hurt their popularity.
Was in a group chat with some people my age who swore up and down Biden wouldn‚Äôt pick her but here we are lmao
heh, Biden/Harris: ‚ÄúAgree with our opinions, or we will make you agree.‚Äù
Congrats to Joe Biden for choosing your VP poorly. Watch for that poll number gap that's been closing between Trump and Biden to close even more rapidly with this announcement.
I understand what you mean. I don't like Trump or Biden either.
Biden already sucks, this changes nothing.
BREAKING: Joe Biden has chosen California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.  It‚Äôs a move that fulfills the wish of Democrats clamoring to see a woman of color on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket for the first time in history.
Oh no, Kamala will make Biden support the police, something he fully does already!
Who do you think Biden should have chosen?
Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP candidate:
Joe Biden did all that "if you gotta think about who to vote for between me or Trump then you ain't black" shit to pick the Indian who has been masquerading as black ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Don‚Äôt get mad at police.  Wasn‚Äôt their fault. California so unlawful.  Biden‚Äôs pick will help that be the norm for US if elected.

Biden/Harris 2020. Let‚Äôs go!
Nearly every damn woman who ran this year was far and away a better choice than Biden.  Agreeing to vote for him to defeat Trump is not the same as staring down the absolute bullshit that put him to the forefront and belittled every woman who was considered "unelectable".
Oh yeah and if you vote for the Biden / Harris ticket you can‚Äôt say ACAB üëçüèº
So much for police reform Biden lmaooooo

Someone should let Biden know.
You know what's embarrassing? That a man would be embarrassed by Biden choosing a female VP.   via
Joe Biden for President ! #Biden2020
The problem with your scenario is biden helped sink the damn boat to begin with. Then when another even better boat came along he sabotaged it to make sure his buddies who sell lifeboats profit.
"Xi Jinping and Ali Khamenei prefer Joe Biden to Donald Trump. Vladimir Putin prefers Donald Trump to Joe Biden. That‚Äôs according to William Evanina, Director of the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center.
Holy fucking shit can we please vote this fucking misogynistic, bigoted, piece of shit out of office. #Vote
Biden no longer NEEDS a certain kind of VP, he's confident he is going to win.  So he can choose whomever he feels the most comfortable with.  Probably Rice, or Whitmer.
Biden doesn't need anyone to be his VP...different scenario now because of the COVID pandemic and Trump's horrible response to it. Before, he needed a black woman VP.  Now he's confident enough to choose anyone, and he'll choose the most comfortable pick (or whatever Obama says)
This is what will finally drive a stake into the abysmal brain trust known as the Trump campaign.  I'm not looking forward to a Biden presidency, but when kids start dying because Trump said "kids have to go to school," it will be the final straw for many.
Not a trump follower. More of a Justin Amash fan. There are many legit criticisms of trump but focusing on the petty ones cheapens the real ones. Also joe Biden doesn‚Äôt know where he is half the time. Or even who he is sometimes. Sad but true.
#MayorPete  Biden promised a woman VP, and he'll probably live up to THAT promise.  But he doesn't NEED any particular one to get elected.  It would be different w/o this pandemic and Trump's horrible response.  Biden can choose the one he's most comfortable with.
#MayorPete  Biden is not going to give him the VP spot, but  Pete must be rewarded for doing the bidding of Obama and the DNC by dropping out just before Super Tuesday so the "moderate Dems" could coalesce around Biden.
It ended the First World War... Biden thinks it ended the civil war... yeah he is way off
Lying Joe Biden.... as always
Yeah I think he meant WW1. How many people here a year ago could honestly name the combatants in WW1 let alone the virus that accompanied the end of it. Also...
I love Mayor Pete (I‚Äôm in Indiana) but Biden promised a female VP. If he goes back on this promise it will be distasterous for him. #VPPick
Things listed on a resume...‚ÄùI uncovered that Harris unfollowed Biden on Twitter‚Äù
Lol but Chris you are watching  have you listened to Biden obviously notü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
#MAGA2020 logic, the 1 accusation against  must be taken seriously, while the numerous ones against  should be ignored.    Accusation against Biden=no proof needed.  Accusation against Trump=proof isn't enough.  #Hypocrisy #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
A pox on both their houses. Trump &amp; Biden seem to be having a contest over who is the bigger moron.
It truly serves no purpose debating a liberal.   Their hatred for Trump is so bad they will over look anything just to say he is bad #SaveTheChildren #Trump2020 #KAG2020. Biden is a bafoon and as long as that is the best they have the will remain ridiculous!
If you think about, 3 Biden signs are a lot for Warsaw/Wawasee. Maybe Trump is in trouble in Indiana

Trump is actually performing better in National polls against Biden than he was against Clinton at this same time last year by +0.9. And well...he won.
Does it matter when he picks her?  I mean, that is really the only "exciting" thing happening this election, so Biden is going to milk it for all he can.
Joe Biden as president
Because China wants Biden to win.
Biden isn't the one who set the bar at "able to walk down a ramp"...
Biden will destroy this country!  If you think it‚Äôs bad now, vote Biden in!
Biden has a history of racist comments. And let‚Äôs not forget about his Crime Bill that filled our jails and prisons with minorities. The manipulated Polls are BS! Biden is on Political Life Support.
Biden did not write that.
This is what we'll continue to have with biden and his ilk in charge.
Youre a terrible representative. You‚Äôre district is covered in the shit of your failed leadership at home, and all you can do for the bation is blame one man whose been in office 1/10 of the time you and Babbling Biden have had to fix these issues.  RETIRE!!!!
What's different is Biden has dementia.
Congress is not using a roadblock that is legal.  They are doing exactly what they accused Trump of... quid pro quo.  Give us this and we will give you that.  Wierd that it's legal for them and Biden but with no proof Trump should be impeached
She should be allowed to debate. I'm a Democrat, but really don't like Biden or Trump. I would definitely like to hear more about Jorgensen.
Are you sure it was Biden
I understand your feeling. This was me the last election. I voted Johnson. There is a part of me that feels complicit in the last four years. I‚Äôll be voting Biden - not because he is an amazing choice but because I can‚Äôt do this anymore.
The right: *insert post bitching about Biden and Democrats   The left: *insert post bitching about Trump and Republicans
Yeah, because I really think George Bush is a reformed war criminal.  He should probably be the keynote speaker in Milwaukee.   Maybe he could give the acceptance speech for Biden, since Biden will probably meander off into who knows what universe.
their corporate sponsors and lobbyists, who shoveled tons of money into their campaigns.  Joe Biden has already told Wall Street that "nothing will fundamentally change."  He can swear on a stack of Bibles that he wants to pass Medicare4All and a Green New Deal, but once elected
Especially because in less than a year they would take the presidency from senile Joe #biden #NoThanks #Trump2020
I don't see why Biden would have to wear a helmet he doesn't have to worry about damaging his brain it's already done
Go back to your brunches and your hero worship of Obama and Biden.
Ukraine is not Russia, nor is it a part of Russia. How is Russia "actively" trying to hurt Biden?  What exactly can they do?  Are they allowed to have an opinion on who wins the election?  You Russophobes are beyond the pale, really.
I think Biden's running mate is telling him that he got picked to run!  Biden wont make it till November his decline is rapidly advancing.  Seems like Bernie is more likely to be candidate. Not sure how it could be anyone else!
You are a fool for thinking Biden can do anything!  I'm talking to the person writing his post. He surely is not, he can't even work a phone.
It would be helpful if Joe Biden himself actually did his tweeting on the Twitter.
What Biden said was correct, not racist.
Even in this funny, perfectly edited piece; President Trump still comes off far more intelligent than Biden.
I agree. In my opinion if Biden is elected he will have to resign soon after inauguration because of mental incapacity, and whoever is Vice President will become president. That‚Äôs assuming, of course that he actually becomes the nominee.
Apparently, you don't believe the VP pick can handle the scrutiny. So like Biden, you want to keep her undercover until Nov. 2nd. You are right, neither Biden or Kamala Harris can withstand scrutiny, so keep them both in hiding until Nov. 2nd- as you wish. We'll all be better off
NBC News reports: ‚ÄúMichigan Gov. Whitmer traveled to Delaware last weekend for a private meeting with Joe Biden, two Democratic officials tell NBC News.‚Äù

And you are still down about 14,000,000 jobs to the Biden era recovery...
biden is not wrong the latino community is more diverse then we are we stuck hating one another as long as that happens its go b like that black people as a whole  mind warped for so long we just start getting to the  point to even think about being diverse
Is this supposed to make ppl vote instead for Donald ‚Äúgrab ‚Äòem by the pussy‚Äù Trump? Just assume we‚Äôre voting for Biden for the judicial nominations.
Endless war, endless meddling, living in a country other than the US, and the constant harping on American exceptionalism.

I still think there is a chance that we end up with, believe it or not, Hillary Clinton as the nominee.  That would take the DNC realizing that Biden just is not all there, and Hillary would MOVE to Michigan and campaign in the midwest exclusively.
Absurd. Anything not a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Trump. Grow up.

but literally settle for biden already
Still relevant:
Joe Biden is being financed by rich liberal Americans who get things made cheap in China and sell to Americans. Thus China is his ally.
If Biden wanted to be president, why didn't he run in 2016?  Oh, I forgot, it was Hillary Clinton's "turn."

The old logo is awful. Not only is the N pointed, it's also higher than the E if you look at the bottom. And the E us higher than the D. Also, why the hell did they go with "Biden President"? It's just awful. They really couldn't have just added "for" and made the bottom bigger?
And ppl say Trump is racist üòÇ üòÇ. Biden is üíØ racist
Absolutely! I rooted for  for VP, but, given that few people are better off than they were four years ago, the Biden-Harris ticket may still win, even if it's weaker than Mondale-Ferraro once were.
It won‚Äôt matter!  Biden and Harris can weather the storm and send a little hurricane their way.  It is hard to believe, but I believe truth will win out.  When everything is exposed there will be a lot of people walking away with their tails between their legs!
I just pray Biden doesn‚Äôt win lol
Honestly only reason why Biden picked her is cause he knows women and black ppl will vote for him just so she can get in the office. But she is a damn moron
Joe Biden may have just harmed his chances more than helping them. Kamala Harris record as a prosecutor speaks for itself.
IDK why my sphere is surprised, he essentially did the same thing with Clinton. Voting for Biden to stop fascism
Biden-Harris: baby-killers. Merciful Lord, forgive them, thy will be done.

Guys, just remember that Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist multiple times.. this just won Trump this years election üòÇüòÇ
Biden/Harris!!!  what a fantastic choice!
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Why is Fox News so interested in who Joe Biden picks as his VP? Who cares!
So #KamalaHarris is Biden's VP! I guess he chose her for her likability.
Refreshing?  Hillary was just 4 years ago  I‚Äôm still holding out hope he picks Sarah Palin.  Still think Biden wins but it does keep it interesting.
If Joe Biden said this he would be ‚Äúlosing it‚Äù ... this dude is just stupid .. such an embarrassment to this country and the office
Is that FOR Biden or AGAINST trump?
What would Biden do, or any President do you idiot??? Trump didn't create this virus and he's done everything that's possible to do ( tell me what he hasn't done and we'll prove it right or wrong with facts)??? Fauci said he saved thousands by stopping China travel here!!!
Who fricken cares. Listen to Biden for 5 minutes. MSNBC=TDS Network!
Just took a drive in the country...Johnson &amp; Shelby Counties, Indiana. Trump flags everywhere! Not a Biden...anything to be found.
Would be good, but be prepared for any bad surprise. Who is actually running Biden's campaign? I do not envy those people, and they may very well make a costly VP mistake.

Trump said Biden is more left than Sanders ever dreamed of. Whaaat?
Michigan is probably paying Biden to take her off of their hands. Been in lock down for 6 months?
Listen to Biden for 5 minutes. Besides that you sound like juveniles.
Read this. Oops, I take that back, have one of your assistants read it to you.
Biden hasn't hurt religion or Gid, you fucking moron.  He's a Helluva lot more religious than you, and he reads books (you're scared now aren't you?)  He's a devout Catholic while you're a devout pagan.  You know, you never met a lie you didn't tell, have you?
That's beside the point, as long as the evidence against Biden is valid, the immediate sources notwithstanding. Biden left the evidence of his corruption in Ukraine for the Russians to find and deliver via their man Derkach and  That's Joe's own fault.
So that means that China wants to to keep their old buddy Biden!
Why is the  silent on the nightly violent Portland riots &amp; not asking why Biden is still hiding in his basement when the election in ONLY 3 months awayüßêüßê.  Oh..that is because all they can do is spread fear about COVID-19!! #nbcisbiased  #FakeNewsMedia
You've just passed off the only two Evangelicals I know.  They were both surprised you thought God was so weak that Biden can hurt him.  Moron, they said God is all powerful.
If a wrong VP candidate is chosen, we're guaranteed to repeat the Dukakis debacle of 1988. People are more dissatisfied in 2020 than they were in 1988, but Biden is weaker than Dukakis was.
Definitely will if Biden is elected!  Will need a way to protect my family. üò•
I did not see you say anything about  Biden‚Äôs racist remarks today on your evening news but you got Michelle Obama on there again complaining about Trump #biasednews

They need to let Biden-Harris do that too then. No discrimination allowed at our WH!
Not unexpected either...Biden should wrap it up and go home if they expect this
To me, this is one of the reasons Biden‚Äôs choice is so perfect. It has triggered trump‚Äôs misogyny big-time so he‚Äôs showing it off and broadcasting it to the whole nation. There‚Äôs no doubt how much he disrespects women and thinks they should just ‚Äústay in their place‚Äù and shut-up.
Can Trump and Pence use the FBI and DOJ to spy on his opponent like Obama/Biden did? Is that what you mean by fair?

I will be enthusiastically voting for Joe Biden. Not the lying cowardly draft dodging treasonous traitor trump!

I think the "Should you vote for Joe Biden" debate is the first time in a while I've seen a large, acrimonious disagreement between socialists and socdem/demsoc types. it's interesting, and it really really sucks
No I can‚Äôt thank Johnson Clinton and Biden for that. That‚Äôs the most ignorant thing anyone has said. There is systemic racism and a justice system that targets black men. The fatherless homes is because you lock up black men at a high rate. Dude. It‚Äôs not aDemocrat thing
My friends from across the political spectrum are saying now awful Kamala is (even apolitical people) and I‚Äôve even seen some of my SocDem friends saying they don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be able to vote Biden now  hehehehehe

Better yet: to satisfy fair campaign rules, for every hour that the press covers these rallies, Biden/Harris2020 should get equal time for their own "briefings."
If Biden wins, Harris will likely be president by 2022. No one is going to primary Biden or Harris in 2024.  The Democratic establishment is still harpooning Sanders for even suggesting somebody primary Obama in 2012.
Biden is far from my ideal candidate, I would have preferred someone more progressive. But I am an adult, I already lived through a dictator taking over a country using Democracy in Turkey. If you think it won‚Äôt happen here, think again. It already is.
Realizing it will be non stop Biden Harris tweets for the next 3 months
If Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would be so great for the country why are they so afraid to answer any questions clearly they‚Äôre not answering questions because they don‚Äôt have any answers to the questions so they avoid any questions
Conspiracies? She literally said she order it by executive order. She‚Äôs said it many, many times that she would confiscate all AR15‚Äôs and other types of ‚Äúassault‚Äù weapons. Which is very subjective. And she is also pro-mandatory vaccine. As is Biden. There‚Äôs no conspiracy, facts.

Joe Biden has Bernie Sanders support because he said he would back Medicare for all.
Joe Biden has already said he's for Medicare for all. If think trump will legalize marijuana, think again. He is in the pockets of big business and that includes pharmaceutical companies. They won't allow legalization because it's too much competition!

He actually said Biden ignores science, but he won‚Äôt!    I think if I start laughing hysterically I might never stop.
You need to meet them in the middle, give a little so Americans can get the relief needed.  When Trump loses, Biden will take care of the States.  This division needs to end!

You can‚Äôt prove stupidity such as what you just typed. You prove how trump is a dictator. It‚Äôs not possible. You know who just proposed a nanny state today? Senile Biden. And here comes #HeelsUpHarris wanting to confiscate citizens AR15‚Äôs by executive order. That‚Äôs fascism.
HOW DISGUSTING IS THIS?
He said it TWICE!!! Please if you still support Trump tell me why? If you don‚Äôt like Biden. Fine. Beat him in 4 years but the guy can‚Äôt read even knowing the context. He is uninterested in understanding anything that doesn‚Äôt have to do with him. Period.
Jesus Horatio Christ! Enough with the f'n polls already! They all said in 2016 that HRC was a guaranteed win. Biden's about on par with where she was back then. We won't know until it's over and after the USPS fuckery, gerrymandering etc. we might never really know.

Dictator Joe Biden and his cohort Harris mandate mask wearing in public for the next three months and typical of a dictator they take no questions and walk away
You seem to confuse "disagree" and "mean." I gained respect for Biden *because* he chose someone who will be a counter-balancing force when difficult decisions have to be made.   You've provided an excellent example of why it's bad to surround a president with "yes" men.
Virginia Mayor Calls Joe Biden's VP Pick 'Aunt Jemima' in Facebook Post  via blackenterprise
heyShitler...how are you voting?  By mail? You are a tyrant that needs to be removed from office.  BIDEN AND HARRIS....ALL THE WAY
That was President Obama and VP Joe Biden who rebuilt our economy. It was only 11 1/2 years ago. Did you just start reading the paper.
Looking forward to hearing you speak! Your voice is important and hopefully you will become part of the new Biden/Harris administration! Good luck Andrew. Best to Evelyn.

"Environmentalists are increasingly maneuvering to make sure that the advisers in a potential Biden Administration understand both the peril and the promise of the moment: we either go big or we go under. "
So if Biden wins in November and gets inaugurated in January but then quickly steps down so Kamala becomes the President, would she still be allowed to run for two terms after that (thus having almost 12 years as president)?
No one has been able to tell me what policies lead them to support Biden.  It's a policy-less political campaign.  The 'lesser of two evils' just keeps getting shittier and shittier.
y-you started the conversation though? you‚Äôre comfortable talking about Biden‚Äôs accusers with a 12 year old but not Trump‚Äôs accusers???
Why does Biden think has has the pleasure of issuing mandates?
my toxic trait is that there's two trumpisms I say all the time and they are calling coffee "covfefe" and calling Biden "swampman joe bidan"
Biden who?
I mean if we have to convince progressives to vote for Biden/Harris more then Independent or undecided Republicans, we are in big trouble.
But how is going after undecided Republicans and Independents playing scared defense? Anyone watching AOC is already voting for Biden/Harris in all likelihood. This seems more to be on the aggressive side, going after votes in Ohio, PA, Michigan etc.

If Joe Biden really wanted to pick a African-American woman for his VP Candidate  Candace Owens would have fit that bill perfectly smart Beautiful and lots of talent
Do you actually want Biden to win this election, or not?
It‚Äôs not about people not being able to vote (Republicans can‚Äôt vote, either!), it‚Äôs about claiming that voting is ‚Äúrigged‚Äù in general, so results cannot be trusted. Trump knows that Biden will get more votes no matter what ‚Äî he will claim all results invalid. What do we do?
They think Barr will arrest Biden

üòÇI want to see the number of people surveyed and where. Another reason for black support of Biden was his VP choice,Black moderates went public saying if the VP was a black female he‚Äôd lose.üòÇis he will anyhow, but just the same. RACE leverage much?üòÇshe cetainly isn‚Äôt qualified
There‚Äôs plenty of evidence that Biden is too handsy with women and children. Good lord.
The GOP are going to have Bursima shit from Russia! They will try to get Biden with Lies!
Your voice on the pod needs to be permanent. (Also, wish your voice had made it to the Biden team to create a little more ceremony around the announcement! They also dropped the ball on the website - no updates to the social media kit to include Harris!)
Trump won't debate Biden. Trump has temporofrontal dementia. Look it up.
I understand what you're saying. I agree, cannabis should be legal but, we stand a better chance of getting reform with Biden/Harris than trump/pence.
She didn‚Äôt. And even her neighbor corroborated that she told her about what happened with Biden. How many women put up with sexual assault to further their careers? That doesn‚Äôt make it right but I‚Äôm sure she knew if she came forward it would ruin her. There is lots of evidence.

Trump is FOR the DP; Biden is AGAINST! 1st time in modern history of the dp that the federal gov't will execute a Native American for a crime committed entirely on tribal lands &amp; against fellow tribe members. The victim's family doesn't want this execution carried out!
Instead of being a condescending elitist blue maga mouthpiece, have you considered maybe advocating for people who don't support Biden to make positive change by doing something beyond voting? Like running for local office, demonstrating, or striking?
So in the first 24 hours after Biden chose her, Distort D'Newza is questioning whether Kamala is "really Black." Eric Trump favorited a tweet calling her a whore. And then all the "nasty" comments from 45.  I'm tired already.
This bullshit hits every blue maga talking point, but at least it's succinct.  -Vote or you're racist/ableist -We can pressure Biden after we give up our only leverage (staying home) for free -If you disagree you can't read read (elitism) -I'm muting all criticism
Literally from 18 hours ago. And if you think there are any important stories the conservative corporate outlets completely ignore because they're inconvenient boy do I have a deal for you
Kavanaugh assaulted no one. There was not one shred of evidence against him and every other ‚Äúclaimant‚Äù retracted their story and said it wasn‚Äôt true. Kamala Harris claimed to believe Tara Reade who actually had evidence against Biden but I guess she doesn‚Äôt care now.

Started by Obama and Biden.  But again unemployment is currently worse than it was during the Great Depression.  Wishing it wasn't so doesn't change the facts.
position is straightforward and clear: Biden will accept the Commission's debates, on the Commission's dates, under the Commission's established format and the Commission's independent choice of moderators," said Biden campaign manager Jen O‚ÄôMalley Dillon in a letter to 2/
Joe‚Äôs been signed on to 3 debate dates since June, 1 in Sept/ 2 in Oct. Although Trump wants his campaign to have a say in picking the moderators, historically that is not how it‚Äôs been done. Biden‚Äôs campaign wants it to remain non partisan as released in this statement: ‚ÄúOur 1/
Trump took the Obama/Biden recovery and wrecked it because he couldn't be bothered to address COVID.  Unemployment numbers have been worse than what we saw during the great depression.
Right? But Joe Biden? Not for me. It‚Äôs time for another option maybe Jo Jorgensen. Unfortunately she doesn‚Äôt stand a chance. The two party system is broken.
He said she was nasty to Biden. And he used the term ‚ÄúPocahontas ‚Äù in that speach about nasty. How does a nasty name-caller judge nasty? He was without words. Not equipped.  Flailing. You go, Kamala.  You got this dope on the ropes.
Nope, the sweet ice man told he is all about Biden &amp; the Pony Express fellow (DJ Pony to his pals) has been singing Kamala‚Äôs name for, like, months now.
Mark my words: Vt will vote GOP incumbent Phil Scott overwhelmingly, but we'll also be solidly blue when it comes to voting for Biden-Harris - perhaps even locally record-breaking.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris get together in Delaware not far from Joe‚Äòs basement and as usual no questions were taken no questions were asked just statements with zero accountability

Trump vs. Biden is not a choice between the lesser of two evils.  It's a choice between evil and someone honest and sincere who you agree with only 80 percent of the time.  So make your choice between an enemy of democracy and an 80 percent friend.

For starters, the Biden campaign didn‚Äôt pick üí© üòÇ secondly, the funny part of it all is the left is pushing the BLM nonsense so the VP pick is a cop, lawyer who prosecuted young black men. See the irony? Also an honorable mention goes to the fact she called Biden a racist üòÇ

No it‚Äôs an issue that YOU care about. Trump makes stupid gaffes but I never considered that he should take a cognitive test as a mandatory proof that he‚Äôs fit for office. He decided to do that on his own terms It backfired because Biden doesn‚Äôt play stupid games. Now Trump 1/

And I say, as I have numerous times, that isn‚Äôt your call or my call. That‚Äôs between Biden and his doctor. Just like Trump and his doctor decided that it was important that he take the test for whatever reason, they felt it was warranted. Trump then decided to make his 1/
I NEVER said I didn‚Äôt believe Trump‚Äôs doctors. I don‚Äôt believe Trump‚Äôs account, because he‚Äôs not truthful. His doctor‚Äôs aren‚Äôt speaking out publicly regarding his test or releasing his test results as part of his medical record. Biden‚Äôs doctors HAVE released his medical records.
It‚Äôs the Post. Right wing propaganda. You can‚Äôt read the paper in front of him, it‚Äôs blurred. He‚Äôs holding his phone mic toward the computer screen because there‚Äôs a likely a 3rd person on the call talking in a conference with Biden/Harris. Next.
Trump is the one who has admittedly taken a dementia test at the insistence of his Drs. You‚Äôre  now projecting that Biden, who BTW is only 3 yrs older than Trump (74 vs 77) is the one that isn‚Äôt fit for office? I think your backing the wrong horse here. 1/
If his doctor thinks so, then sure. I have no problem with it. It‚Äôs not my call. Trumps doctors thought it was necessary, Biden‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt this far. I‚Äôll defer to the experts.
When Kamala Harris is described as a small "c" conservative and pro-abortion Biden is called a "devout Catholic"  ... maybe it's not just gaslighting.    Maybe they're lying.

telling everyone he took a test, it never occurred to me that a President, whether it be he or Biden be tested for dementia. Trump chose to take the test and that‚Äôs his right to do so. That‚Äôs a decision between him and his doctor. It‚Äôs never been done before that I‚Äôm aware of 2/

I‚Äôm not qualified to say. Biden‚Äôs doctors are and they obviously think he‚Äôs mentally fit and therefore don‚Äôt feel he needs to be tested. Trump‚Äôs doctors must have been concerned with his cognition and felt it necessary to administer the dementia screening test. Trump said he 1/

Short of Biden choosing Richard Spencer as a running mate I was already pretty decided. Having my first choice possibly end up as VP just makes voting sweeter.
Biden released his entire medical record. If his doctor felt he needed a dementia screening, they would have administered it, but I guess they feel it‚Äôs not necessary, unlike Trump‚Äôs doctors who must have been concerned and wanted him tested.

Kamala is so phony. The way she is yapping on and on about Biden is sickening.  The least sincere person on the planet. This is why she was so soundly rejected by the voters before.
I won‚Äôt be voting for Biden.  Or Trump.
If you‚Äôre voting for a Biden then I hope you don‚Äôt vote. I don‚Äôt want my children growing up in a country where the criminals are in charge and the government kowtow to them.

He‚Äôs misled no one. Biden has been in politics for 50 yrs and has done nothing. President trump has kept nearly every promise he‚Äôs made. You want a socialist country? Vote Biden.
trump is only 3 years younger than Biden but he bloated morbidly obese and out of shape.   I would love to see trump ride a bike like Biden!
The debates wont change anything for anyone. Even if Biden has no gaffs and kicks trump's ass with endless facts, MAGAs will say its lies. So forget the debates, recruit,  get every to vote, regardless of party,  get everyone you know involved in the process.

Using West as a metric? Yes. Otherwise, not really, but moreso than trumplefuckstick. 1st order of business- remove trump. Biden's easier to fight. I don't like any of the candidates. It's not who I'm for, it's who I'm most against. 21st century politics. Yuck.

Joe Biden just charmed the hell outta me. Definitely did not anticipate that! Also, during the Biden - Harris administration, can the two of them PLEASE broadcast a weekly fireside chat where the 2 of them sit around &amp; shoot the shit, telling stories for an hour?
If Joe Biden gets elected, &amp; then steps aside within the first year, all will be forgiven.  He can cite age, mental acuity, whatever...  Otherwise, his decision to compete against our most promising field of Democratic candidates is hard to forgive... at least this is a 1st step

Biden's not perfect. He makes mistakes. He has slips of the tongue. But he's honest and sincere, which are two things you can't say about Dear Leader. And that should make the choice for president an easy one.
And Trump following Biden and Harris is stark.  They are leaders. He's a rambling mess.
Joe Biden is in WAY better shape than #MorbidlyObese  so guess that means trump won‚Äôt be on the ticket either  üñïüñï
Ugh. Do some actual reading will you? Stop regurgitating Trump TV talking points. Biden wants to give an additional $300mil to police. From USAToday OpEd that HE WROTE: ‚ÄúI do not support defunding police. The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need 1/
I agree 100% w/  : Senator Harris and/or Biden should hold a press conference each day at same times as Trump
Watching Trump's press conference after watching Biden/Harris is like going from a Broadway show to a 6th grade school play.  Holy crap
It‚Äôs extra-excruciating to try to watch DT‚Äôs rambling incoherent lies during WH briefing after listening to amazing Biden/Harris speeches.  The contrast is so stark.   And that was the point, noü§î?  #BidenHarris2020 #DumpTrump2020
You're point I assume since you like to babble about stupid shit, is that Kamala is somehow a hypocrite. She also said this, later the same year. ‚ÄúThe Joe Biden I know is somebody who really has fought for women and empowerment of women and for women‚Äôs equality and rights,‚Äù
You endorsing Biden for president, Jeff?  Putting your money where your mouth is?  Or are your words empty and toothless, the way they often were when you served in the Senate?
Noam Chomsky wants you to vote for Joe Biden and then haunt his dreams -
Not a damn thing is gonna keep me from getting to that booth and voting for Biden/Harris. I'll go in a bubble if I have to.I'm realizing that Joe Biden may be an elderly white guy with some old ideas, but that he also clearly sees the future of the Party and makes choices based on building toward that future. We shouldn't underestimate him. I think that we've given the country a fantastic nominee.
The DNC is playing with fire. All Trump has to do is make the case that Biden is a placeholder for Harris. Look for a new nickname for Biden (or her) evoking the idea of him planning to resign (or the inevitability of resigning due to health).
But this is better.
Like Kamala ripping parents away from children for truancy or Biden ripping parents away from their children with the crime bill?   Ooooooookay
If you‚Äôre voting for Biden you‚Äôre not a devout Catholic. You‚Äôre voting for partial birth abortion. Late Term Abortion. Funding of Planned Parenthood. Suing the Little Sisters of the Poor. You‚Äôre worried about COVID-19 deaths! What about the 60 million babies aborted!? Evil.
Pretty sure it‚Äôs bc we‚Äôve  moved on from  a debate line  that  happened  almost a YEAR ago, but go off..  Regardless, hope we can all put our big kid pants on and vote for Biden/Harris  in Nov rightüëç
Thats why they didnt endorse Biden!
If you‚Äôre voting #Biden &amp; you‚Äôre voting on Election Day I beseech you to go to the polls as soon as they open. With many worried about mail-in ballots due to Trump‚Äôs sabotage there could be extremely long lines later in the day. Your courage is admirable. Your vote is sacred.
to my bitter Bernie bros, it's super annoying when you hide behind "don't vote shame me" while talking about not voting Biden when that's LITERALLY all we did to everyone else during the primaries. That was like... our whole thing. Fuck you
There they are: President Joe Biden and VP Kamala Harris.
Personally I plan to vote Biden out of spite. I hope his utter lack of leadership drives this country into the shit so I can scream even harder in 2024.  Maybe people will wake up then. In the meantime, we have to keep challenging corporate Dems in the House and Senate.
You know what? Joe Biden isn‚Äôt gay enough.
You‚Äôre the one that brought it up- you‚Äôre the one who supports crime bill Biden and his prosecutor vp, while democrats call for defunding police.  But please feel free to get schooled, if you‚Äôd like.
I just begged my sisters to vote for Biden even though I absolutely disapprove of him. Get trump out of office.  Please.
I won't, because I can't... but I will blame Biden for every failure on the way, point out every American that suffers and dies due to his negligence.  I hate him. I hate him so fucking much that I want him to win - so that I can blame all the failures of 2024 solely on Biden.
I changed to be anonymous because I‚Äôm surrounded by angry trumpsters and can‚Äôt die because my kids would be stuck with my asshole ex.
Hell joe Biden still thinks he‚Äôs running for senator
I have no doubt Biden is in better health. Can you imagine Trump bike riding currently?
I think the news of Trump‚Äôs bullshit play will cause every Biden voter on Earth to figure out how to vote timely!
That is well known..she is a liar and cheat..the things in the debate that she called and accused Biden of are sickening..she is totally her own best fan..she is only interested in herself folks...watch n listen...we do not want either one of them...their afraid of any questions
THANK YOU!! I feel like this should be obvious. Not to mention reports that other countries are interfering, what just happened with PR, the fact McConnells stacked the courts. But Biden can't call it out because that's how he won the primary so here we go
Many Pelosi and Shumer should do the same. How about Biden?
She and Biden are both ridiculous choices for our country...the things they r pushing for r nothing more than   horrid Socialists....Everyone vote for TRUMP/PENCE Biden n Kamala are bad for this free country!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Biden and Harris should earn votes by their own Merits not by our Silence!  I want Trump gone but not at the cost my VOICE!
She‚Äôs cackling at the thought that anyone would take what was said at ‚Äúa debate‚Äù seriously.  So does that mean that she called Biden a racist and a rapist just to get her mug on CNN the next morning?
Joe Biden is ethical. We do not expect him to give up his salary.  He will not screw the tax payer like the unscrupulous trumps are doing now.
I imagine Barr has prepared a whole bunch of pardons should all of their dirty tricks fail and Biden is president.
The Biden/Harris campaign staffers shoo away reporters after a press conference. Don't you even think about asking a unscripted question!
My apologies Vice President Biden and Senator Harris. I meant to take you off before responding to that idiot.
I only hope that the Trump administration decides to spy on Biden and Harris just like the Obama administration did to Trump . I mean, come on ....what‚Äôs fair is fair?

Kam√¶lah Hurries was just elevated by Joke Biden, IMHO. . .as This Nation's Top ISLAMOMARXISED-DEMONRATS' DOGGIE SEXTRAORDINAIRE NONPAREIL!!!   Arguable, of course; so, I leave the judgment to San Francisco's Slick Willie!   Hehehe...
No, this really sounds like Biden and Hunter. Confused? Brian and Ed K. were always confused b4 Twitter banned them for being fake like you.
It should be Clinton‚Äôs, Al Gore, Obama, Biden‚Äôs, Benghazi , Pelosi, Schumer, Nadler, &amp; probably a bunch more DEMS that saved the economy from a depression. The economy is not the STOCK MARKET. It‚Äôs not having 50 million unemployed &amp; a climbing stock market from prior president.
Did everyone just forget that Joe Biden is a rapist?
I got reasoned into (probably) voting Biden. It goes like this:  In 2024, when the US is a worse shit show than it is now, who do you want to blame? I'd rather blame Biden and the Neoliberal establishment who refused to fix anything for 4 years.
2/2 When you have Group 1 voting for A (perhaps a few Bs and Cs) &amp; Group 2 voting for B, C, &amp; D as well as E-Z- I mean, again, it‚Äôs a flawed system, but I‚Äôm sure you can see the math; &amp; if you can‚Äôt see that Biden is at least the lesser of two evils, nothing I say really matters.
Agree. On another note, I do have a new name for Biden &amp; Harris though. SloHo
Someone needs to tell Biden to encourage all who are able to vote in person. The pandemic can‚Äôt get in the way at this point. He needs to alter his messaging around this

Never Trump. Never Biden. Vote for my dick.
Please vote Biden/Harris to save our Democracy!  PLEASE
Do you want to know what Biden/Harris think of Americans?  Their silence on their party leaving Washington with no deal says it all.
the point would still hold if you get the point: there is no direct correlation btwn having radical politics, or even being seen as an influential/authoritative voice on the radical left, and arguing that people should vote Biden this election. One ex demonstrates this, I named 2

Now do Biden drooling and trying to speak the English language...
I can't believe the amount of people in comments sections that don't understand how conventions work, they all think delegates from states bernie won are supposed to vote for Biden lmao
His sabotage will backfire. We want more absentee ballots to make it easier to vote. But that asks which candidate needs it to be easier. Biden voters would crawl across hot lava to vote. Other than hard core Trumpeters, republicans are not so enthused.
This is a BIG deal (I won‚Äôt quote Joe Biden) but many thanks to the MInd Trust and our many partners who are making this happen for our families!!!
Brandon why must it be comparative? Both are awful but the thinking that Biden is a savior is incredibly naive biased and frankly idiotic....hope you‚Äôre well
"This is the most important US #election," said John M. Koenig, former charg√© d'affaires of the embassy in Berlin. "How interested are the Germans in the US election? They are obsessed with it," said John B. Emerson, former ambassador to Germany.
And Barr has said that none of the principals involved in these cases are "political" so he will continue rolling them out during the final months of the campaign.  Which means we can fire him immediately after Biden wins.
How you can compare Biden's racist statements to all the racist stuff coming from trump is amazing. trump and his father got busted for housing discrimination by the doj. I'm sure you know that.
to be honest as a black man in America we are screwed either way Donald chump hasn‚Äôt done crap but set us back 60+ years and Biden well like you said hasn‚Äôt done anything for the minority‚Äôs so here we are screwed again

To wrap up this thread I do not identify with the right or left fuck Trump, Pence, Biden, and Kamala. There isn‚Äôt a lesser of 2 evils here and if you think that you have a privilege of thinking either side aren‚Äôt fascist international criminals
Nah, Trump is a traitor and has blood on his hands.  Biden might be a little weird and sure, he helped pass some questionable laws, but he‚Äôs not a traitor and if there is blood on his hands, it ain‚Äôt like he was influenced by Putin.   Also, I said uninformed, not different.
Thought he is racist. He asked an African American reporter if he‚Äôs a cocaine junkie because he asked about his cognitive testing. You can‚Äôt accuse Trump of one thing then give Joe Biden a pass because he‚Äôs Democrat.
Dont forget Joe Biden saying, that if you don‚Äôt know if your for him or Trump then you ain‚Äôt black. You can‚Äôt work at a 7/11 or a Dunkin Donuts if you don‚Äôt have a slight Indian accent. The Latino comm is more well rounded and diverse than African Americans. Hell even Kamala

Joe Biden because of a heartless illegal immigrant I went from living a good life driving tractor trailer to barely existing on $800 a month,you heard me right I was a truck driver making good money until a drunk immigrant slammed into my truck on purpose,&amp; now I exist on crums.
I'll vote Biden, just so he can be blamed for the shit show America will be in 2024. Once the left has been robbed again, I'll either be looking toward revolution or immigration, because I don't have the fucking energy to fight this dumb shit anymore.

Hillary said; ‚ÄúI want to help anyway I can.‚Äù That should be taken as a  threat to all mankind. Hillary helps no one but herself and the cost/price to partner with Hillary, Biden and Obama is Benghazi for all. They never was punished for that.

Biden has been in agreement with the experts Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx.  The #StableGenius promoted a doctor that believes in Alien DNA/demon sperm and ignored the experts‚Äô guidelines. He‚Äôs the only one to blame for 167K+ deaths and getting the US banned by 30+ countries.

i very much agree with that, but i feel like its obvious to tell the mood of the country is swinging to the left, the young generation wants change. I think biden will at least allow that change to continue slowly, whereas trump wont allow shit, maybe won‚Äôt have elections in 2024
this is what I mean by people giving "opinions" that aren‚Äôt based in fact. Biden has move considerably left since becoming nominee because of pressure and tactical decisions by those on the left who decide to do the real work. Read here:

Yes because Republicans are known for rioting in the streets who can forget all the stuff they destroyed after Obama was elected...on the other hand if Biden doesn‚Äôt win we know what the resistance is going to do
Difference is republican voters won‚Äôt riot  loot &amp; assault police officers like the Democrats will if Biden doesn‚Äôt win

Some preemptive  &amp;  fact checking:  "Most pro-abortion ticket ever" Biden is a devout Catholic.  "Most anti-Israel ticket ever" Harris is married to a Jewish attorney. Her stepkids call her "Momala," a play on her name &amp; the Yiddish ‚ÄúMamaleh,‚Äù which means little mama.
She wasn‚Äôt wishing him dead or any ill will.  She was expressing what we all know-Biden has dementia.  The Democrat/Socialist Party knows that.  They are playing a game to hold onto power and they will use Biden or their own mothers to get it.  Evil.

It took two people to write this joke of a column? You honestly expect us to believe Joe Biden picked his VP. He doesn‚Äôt even know what office he‚Äôs running for.
Kamala just killed Biden‚Äôs slightest chance of winning the election.   THANK YOU SLEEPY JOE.  Who else agrees?
Biden Live in the corner. All I can think of is maybe for now when I read that. Looks like he‚Äôs aged twenty years since February

Do you really think Biden will be President for over a few months? Rmember his words...."I am the transition President". This is the plan.
Is the bunker full of Biden, or is Biden fuller of bunk?
Trump will not vacate or acknowledge Biden as the President.  We need to prepare for this.  I am so scared that Trump is going to turn OUR country into a dictatorship, his followers could be preparing to commit violence if Trump doesn't win.  We need to prepare, not just vote.
Joke Biden is a known pathological-liar for a long long time already! It's just too bad that large numbers of leftist-Americans want this demented-fool as our next POTUS... phoeeey!
Bro fuck Joe Biden
Now do Joe Biden.  I‚Äôll wait.
I just see him as much less of a threat to my values than Biden.

‚ÄúThis virus has impacted almost every country, but there‚Äôs a reason it has hit America worse than any other advanced nation. It‚Äôs because of Trump‚Äôs failure to take it seriously from the start,‚Äù Kamala Harris says.
Apparently bc Biden likes her and thats saying everything!
every illegalien in sanctuary-cities and States to insure Biden's victory!  The bigger disaster would be a PDJTS -vs- DR. JILL BIDEN DEBATE. . .with smirking Jo(k)e Biden as her lone-onstage-cheerleader!  And not far behind, is octogenarian Kamala's beau, ex-mayor Willie Brown
Kamala was my first choice a year ago and she still is. I'll let others be Anti-Trump. I will be positive and support Biden-Harris.
I think Black celebrities showing love &amp; support to Sen. Harris is fueling a narrative that she is OUR co-leader. When in reality, Biden chose her to project a Black (false) sense of uprising and hope. Especially now. But it‚Äôs just too ironic. I‚Äôve done research. This is scary.
Buttigieg has a place in a Biden/Harris administration. It‚Äôs gonna be awesome. But Russian bots in conjunction with 4chan, QAnon, and butthurt Bernie Bros are gonna be pushing the ‚ÄúBiden and Harris are racist cops‚Äù narratives hard to try to discourage as many from voting as psbl.

She is not an American born citizen so she is not qualified to be Vice President, as she cannot assume the duties of President if Biden steps down. Speaker of the House becomes President. They are gambling that it will be Pelosi?

I didn‚Äôt watch. Did Biden actually give coherent answers to questions?
yep, he put positive covid patients in long term facilities...no, that was Cuomo. Bounties? Is this the new Russian hoax? Only labeled racist once he ran as GOP. Before that, he was rubbing elbows with all the left loons. The 1% that can't pass the test must be Biden. Trump 2020
I also believe the accusers Kamala believes: the women who each claimed he invaded their personal space but did not take it as sexual harassment. Biden apologized to each.
This is how screwed up Sleepy Joe is in the head.  Schools should teach America History &amp; Civics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Biden: Schools should ramp up 'Islamic faith' studies, Muslims must 'mobilize' against Trump  via
Biden and Kamala both are missing one important thing that they both need to be President. They must know how to lead and stand for something. Both lack this. They both follow. Neither can lead on anything. Trump leads, a born leader.
I agree, but the guy to whom something will happen won't be Biden.  It's trumpie. Too bad.  So sad.

No he walks off after a number of stupid questions. There is a difference. Have you seen Biden take any questions after a press conference? He can read, he cannot answer w/o a script probably.

You're right. And it's a shitty thing to have to deal with.  Honestly, I just don't know what else to do. I don't want Biden or Harris, but Trump is causing destruction at levels that will be hard to come back from. At least there's a chance for accountability here.
Vote for Biden and Harris, and hold them accountable. Criticize them. Speak out against injustice they have caused and will cause.   Trump won‚Äôt get held accountable by his supporters and won‚Äôt listen to criticism regardless.   Vote Trump &amp; Pence out.
If I were Biden, I'd play that clip in an ad over and over. I'd buy airtime during Tucker's own show to run that ad.
Bout to mute Kamala, Harris, Joe, Biden, vote, coon, Democrat, ancestors, HBCU and AKA until AT LEAST November 4th cause some of y‚Äôall are really doing the most + still haven‚Äôt picked up a book.
is just becoming a veritable walking advertisement for the Biden/Harris ticket! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ like a good little liberal!
Traditionally, Presidential candidates do. Since he‚Äôs not the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù candidate until accepting nomination at next week‚Äôs convention, he may not yet be receiving them regularly. But, Biden has said he‚Äôs received Intel on possible election interference.

Definitely. I just hate the idea that not voting is choosing either R or D. Because it just isn‚Äôt. Rs say not voting is a vote for Biden and Ds say not voting is a vote for DJT. It‚Äôs definitely apathy and letting others make your choice. But it‚Äôs not a vote for either side.
Followed by all the lies her and Biden make up.
Biden will get smoked in a live debate. He knows it, DNC knows it, you have to hope a VP pick can do it for him. WOW

Ya‚Äôll don‚Äôt find it ironic Biden makes bullshit comments about the black community not being diverse then chooses a black woman as a running mate? It‚Äôs all calculated, not anything more.
Biden is Catholic
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris's appearance together has been delayed for now. Seems Sleepy Joe has wandered off and no one can find him! #SilverAlert
No it‚Äôs not. Because we say this evry election.   I‚Äôm so tired of this. Because if trump loses, not voting is a vote for Biden.
whose probably-faux-womanhood still lacks its apt cervical-implant at this point in time ‚Äì and would likely launch a month-long nationwide riotings, lootings or even killings by the woke-democrat-extremists!  Thanks, Jo(k)e Biden, for sparing America this  incendiary top-choice!

Pence is the biggest dipshyte of the running mates. So it‚Äôs still a vote for Biden.

whose probably-faux-womanhood has no cervix-implant yet. . .would have probably-caused nationwide-riotings by the millions of 'woke' socialist-democrat foulmouths!  With his loud proclamation of radical-extremist socialist-Kamala Harris as his running-mate, Jo(k)e Biden‚Äôs entire
wrote in American history-books that his VP-choice is a black-American woman of Jamaican/Indian heritage with the ill-repute of having been the high-society-mistress of the now octogenarian ex-mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, CA! For a careerist politician, Jo(k)e Biden's
Jo(k)e's senilic blunders.  For starters, Jo(k)e BIDEN‚ÄôS ALLEGED-MODERATION MEANS ABSOLUTELY-NOTHING SINCE HE IS WILLING TO PLACE HARDCORE-SOCIALISTA KAMALA HARRIS JUST ONE-HEARTBEAT-TOO-CLOSE TO THE U.S. PRESIDENCY.   And in his history-making efforts, Jo(k)e Biden has just
opportunistic and dishonest attacks on obamaized-Biden.  At the very least, Jo(k)e Biden should hire his trusted food-taster!  In selecting radical-extremist Kamala Harris, Jo(k)e Biden has opened the door to the Trump Campaign. And Pres. Trump would likely take full advantage of
Biden: " if you're my vp... then you ain't black"!! Uhhh.. or something.
I didn‚Äôt say they can‚Äôt live longer. Based on the average life span there is a possibility they won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not just that. Trump isn‚Äôt the most physically fit person and Biden seems to blank out. I didn‚Äôt say anyone was invincible. I‚Äôm saying the exact opposite of that.
‚ÄúThe only conclusion that I can draw from Biden‚Äôs selection is this: No matter who is in the White House following this fall‚Äôs election, the federal government won‚Äôt be getting any better on criminal justice. If anything, it‚Äôll probably get worse.‚Äù
Wow, about .000000000000000001% of how bad Biden is. So really not much there. Pretty bad attempt to troll.
Biden Picks Kamala Harris for VP

I will never vote for you and I encourage all ‚ÄúSuburban Housewives‚Äù to vote for Biden and Harris!!
The fact is though, if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden/Harris: that‚Äôs one less vote Trump/Pence have to worry about. It will just be a repeat of 2016 when people didn‚Äôt want to vote for Hillary and guess what what happened??????
So instead of blindly falling in line behind Biden/Harris and reveling in our choices, it‚Äôs better to vote for them and send them a truly progressive congress as a message that walking down the middle is no longer good enough. #LocalElectionsMatter
"...and this pick may be one of convenience"
You and Biden are better off not speaking.
I enjoyed watching this when Kamala Harris put a foot to ass.  ‚ÄòJoe Biden I don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre a racist, but I am thinking loudly.‚Äô

Your definitions are all mucked up, chap. They have you you convinced that Joe Biden is a Marxist. That‚Äôs foolish and you know it. Everyone to left of you is ‚Äútotalitarian‚Äù yet you submit all your private information to Google and buy your Walmart goods built by slave labor lol
Biden, Harris to make campaign debut
since Kamala is a great counter to 2 of trump's big strategy points at this point in the election, she seems like she could quell some fears ppl have about biden. As opposed to him picking COMMIE YANG or another candidate that would be more appealing to me
Mmm. I think the difference is pretty big, cuz after all it's not about what republicans think, it's about independents, and having 2 of the most centrist dems being pres and VP helps nullify one of Trump's biggest attacks. Also "Cop"mala helps biden be more "law and order"
Am I the only one who thinks this election is more of a vote for VP?  Both Trump and Biden are elderly and the average life span of a male in the US is 78.5 years. Am I not being realistic in this assumption? Trump is 74 and Biden is 77.
You‚Äôve sacrificed your critical thought to conspiracy theories that tell you everyone is an enemy. They have you convinced a conservative like Joe Biden is a ‚Äúradical‚Äù. Over the next few years you‚Äôre gonna meet some real radicals.
If Biden wins and say he gets re-elected in 2024, do you really think he will make it to his mid 80s? It is conjecture but it‚Äôs a valid concern. Them both going while in office is a real possibility. The average lifespan for a man in the US is 78.5 years.
i used to think this, but also there's a huge chunk of the pop not being considered here -  independents, who biden is currently crushing it with  also keep in mind, Trump's main message is Biden is a far-left wing puppet, putting in a progressive VP would support that
And it‚Äôs not a promise it‚Äôs an actual agreement they‚Äôve been working for a while. Biden promised a huge tax increase too with this pact so he‚Äôs not lying.
Trump might not know what ended WWII, or that there weren‚Äôt airports in Revolutionary War, or windmills cause cancer, or how to read a basic bar graph, or how mail-in voting works, or how to say Thailand, BUT AT LEAST HE‚ÄôS NOT LIKE SLEEPY JOE BIDEN WHO *checks notes* IS KINDA OLD

The harder you attempt to push Biden to the left the more fervent he appears to move to the center. Obviously, he doesn't want the donor class and  Wall Street to believe anything other than his status quo heritage.
#ICYMI: Vice President Mike Pence is not shying away from Joe Biden's pick as his running mate.

I think we were discussing about whether Biden is ‚Äòright wing‚Äô which he is not considering 18-24 year olds who are majority liberal and left wings show a 64% support to him.
Biden's picks Kamala.  Book:  - conservative political cartoon compilation
would be an asset in any position of the Biden Administration.   Attorney General, Secretary of State, or Senate Majority Leader. She is an accomplished, experienced Constitutional Lawyer and servant of the people... who I hope to see on the Supreme Court one day.
These might be common sense in an ideal world. But doing these are expensive and one of the reasons why Bernie couldn‚Äôt make it further in the ballot cause of his extreme left views that Biden shares, especially with kamala next to him.
Joe Biden has a racism problem...
Well, that sums up where you stand. No conservative or even right wings share these views with Biden. Maybe you think they‚Äôre good cause you‚Äôre left-wing?
Hey 18 to 24 years olds... got that... Biden VP pick thinks ya'll are stupid!!!  I just think ya'll still have some baking and cooking to do but you're not stupid.  The look on that lady's face says it all; she's like "oh snap, not cool".  Prob has an 18-24 year old kid!
Biden wrote the crime bill- which took mainly minority fathers away from their kids directly resulting in the violence between our youth that is occurring every day.  Kamala wanted to lock up parents of truant children - starting to get the picture yet?
Writing and publishing Biden/Harris hate because they're not trying to abolish the police or whatever is a choice you're making to help Trump and moves the needle the tiniest bit towards fascism and you should stop ü§ó
3) I haven‚Äôt condemned anyone for wanting anything. I didn‚Äôt support either of Biden or Kamala. This is about the one decision people make in November to avoid re-electing 45. This is literally not difficult

would move Americans away from their private healthcare plans; she announced in open debate that she would use executive orders to ban ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù; she said she would ban fracking; she attacked Justice Brett Kavanaugh as a purported-rapist...   and
Joe Biden authored the racist crime bill and loves kids sitting on his lap and rub his hairy legs. His words not mine.    PS I‚Äôm not a trump supporter, say whatever you want about him.
Age brings wisdom. From what I‚Äôm getting we all want the same things. I applaud the youngsters for bringing the fight to the streets and I empathize w the frustration of having to choose between trump or Biden. It‚Äôs just that trump is THAT bad.
He knows better, of course. Biden and Harris are centrists.
I look at it as, who do you dislike less? Trump needs out of office pronto, and I think Biden will keep things steady and not spiral this country out of control.
Kamala isn't running against you. Joe Biden is.   Could someone please on Donnie's hand, "I am running against Joe Biden"?

Yeah don‚Äôt forget but y‚Äôall still have to vote  for Biden and Kamila however you spell it. A lot of y‚Äôall looking like real Trumpish on my TL no vote is a vote for TrumpO don‚Äôt think it will be smart of him to endorse Biden. He can and should criticize trump, it gives him a good standing in the future (hopefully renewed and detrumpifird GOP); endorsement of Biden first, will be insincere and second, will hurt his chances in the future.,
Give Biden a break when you‚Äôre describing him this way. He‚Äôs been racist for years, and won‚Äôt change. And his deterioration, happens to people his age. I just wish his family would intercede or protect him from being used like this....
What I was like to know when Harris and Biden walk out on the stage for their address to the American people with their mask on, why aren‚Äôt they 6 foot apart or did Biden sniff Harris and assume she‚Äôs virus clean?
I'm confused...how does a Jamaican father and an Indian mother make an African American child??? And just remember what Biden said!
Biden is not a leader and never really has been his entire career.  The guy is a consensus-seeker, and he is happiest when he thinks everybody got something they want.  Maybe admirable if there were two sane sides, but we're dealing with a malevolent evil right now.
Biden you are a pervert!
Can‚Äôt wait for Biden to kick all these bottom-feeders out of the briefing room and then have a bunch of shithogs like Jake Tapper and Chuck Todd to go to the barricades for them

Let me tell you this: Science is proving that Trump was right all along. It‚Äôs a shame you guys hate Trump so much, and are so desperate for power..that you‚Äôd put your Party over the success and well-being of Americans and the USA. Biden is only gonna do what Trump‚Äôs already doing
Well your businessman mentality is really funny! If anything they are more moderate than left. Biden has always been , his voting record reflects that. Harris never been a leftist, again a moderate Democrat. But hey go with the Trump talking points, shows you'll tote that line!
Basically, Biden won‚Äôt be the President if elected. üò¨

Donald Trump is doing a great job campaigning for Joe Biden at his own presser.
Someone please explain how that makes any sense. Trump ordered attacks on multiple terrorists and took out some very bad people. Biden is spouting lies and nonsense.
We have put ourselves in a situation where people are legimately having a dilemma on whether to vote Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris. It‚Äôs not rocket science who is the better option. You are allowed to be mad but you cannot sit there and act like both are equally terrible.
Wow! Went to Biden political sight!
Cavuto is as bad as Biden and Harris they are all three just alike, idiots!

joe biden really out here denying america's immanence with this speach. this is bad faith.
Some of y'all gotta toxic relationship w/ electoral politics. You swear up and down that the presidency is corrupt and then go apeshit every time power predictably gets consolidated. Who did you think Joe Biden was going to pick? The ghost of Joseph Stalin?
Biden should commit to putting Katie Porter in his cabinet today. I don't even care where, she's the best elected official we have
Kamala Harris wants to: 1. Take away your guns by Executive Order.  2. Raise taxes by 70% 3. Get rid of Private Insurance   Joe Biden has said: 1. He cannot ban guns by executive order.  2. Latinos are more diverse than African-Americans.  This will end well.
I think the broad popular view is Medicare for all who want it, which Biden does support luckily. He wants a public option that competes with private.
- This is Biden's platform   - This is Trump's platform  Read through these websites, pick your favorite causes and see how each of them address it. Then tell me Biden won't be the best chance for a progressive future THIS ELECTION.
Love You and the show Dana, but Donna Brazile needs to be gone from Fox. She is a proven cheater and liar and Fox should have never hired her. Well, since she‚Äôs there, ask her how she intends to cheat and lie for Biden As she did for Hillary.
It‚Äôs takes like 4 years for a president to undo what the one before him did. We vote Biden in. Nothing is going to change in the next 4 years lol
But she said Biden was Racist...
We get it. Kamala was a cop. She did some extremely shady things that targeted certain demographics. Biden was for the Iraq War and other things regarding warfare in the Middle East. You should hold her and Biden accountable 100%.
Liberals and conservatives are in for a wake up call when they learn that nearly everyone in office has voted for and done shitty/terrible things. Sure, Kamala and Biden aren‚Äôt the greatest, and are even unappealing, but they are absolutely the better ticket this election.
Many don‚Äôt get the meaning of probability of winning and I hope this new graphic gets the point across. This means from an urn of 10 balls to draw, 3 of them are winning balls for Trump (not that his polls are 3:7 against Biden). That‚Äôs not too steep a slope.
Column: Biden picks Kamala Harris. Trump should dump Mike Pence and replace him with a yacht.
Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to mask his abuse of women and minorities i.e. sexist and racist virtue signaling.
THIS!!!!! Hi I guess I‚Äôm back on my political soapbox for the next 3 or so months. Please don‚Äôt abstain from voting and please don‚Äôt vote third party. Please don‚Äôt vote Bernie. Bernie‚Äôs great! But not voting for Biden/Harris in any way is voting for Trump. Period.
Your options are Biden or trump. Third party candidates will not win. With or without your vote, there will be a Biden or trump presidency. Abstaining from voting or voting third party = a 2nd term. Look in the mirror and check your privilege. Thanks.
Can hardly wait for this to play out:
88% support Medicare for All. Biden says he would veto it.
Personally I think if by chance Biden would win , he would suffer one of those clinton suicides leaving harris to be directed by "The New World Order" billionaires.
That's why Pelosi endorsed all the members of the Squad and Biden worked closely with Bernie on policy issues...
Serious question: what are the odds on Trump awarding himself the Presidential Medal of Freedom before Biden is inaugurated just so he can say he has one too?   I'm saying 50/50
I mean, first off Biden never officially said he would only pick a black woman, but he said "a woman". Also, I see no issues with bringing a historically oppressed and underrepresented group to the office of VP. Seems like a step forward
Shame on you.  Joe Biden is a devout Catholic.  You don't have the power to excommunicate him.
If Biden hasn't made a sufficient trajectory shift on US emissions, then SOMEBODY better primary the crap out of him or Harris (assuming she also does not support policies sufficient to the task). We can measure this stuff and know if we're on track or not.
Joe Biden didn‚Äôt have a Vice President yet either.
Joe Biden made a terrible decision with horrible Harris.
Man if ya'll wanna vote for Biden/Kamala then do that. If you don't, then don't. But shaming people for not doing what you're doing isn't the wave, no matter the situation in my opinion
wow yeah super not thrilled with the vp pick. they‚Äôre really making it harder and harder for progressives/leftists to give them their vote. unfortunately Biden-Harris is still the lesser of two evils. i‚Äôm settling nov. 3rd and i hope y‚Äôall are too
I said from the beginning when Biden became the frontrunner that Kamala would be an awesome choice for VP. So excited for this election. Can't wait to see who Biden picks for his cabinet, sec of state, etc. This feeling of hope is amazing!
I'm not the biggest Kamala Harris fan, but this is a legitimately good position to hold and one that I hope she still holds and pushes for (despite the lack of pro-prosecution statements I've seen in Biden's climate policy)
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
After what Black people collectively have been through this year, I'm going to unapologetically relish that Sen. Kamala Harris, a Black &amp; South Asian woman, is on a major U.S. party ticket! There will be enough time to hold Biden-Harris accountable to the people. We can do both!
Biden picked Harris.....
Let‚Äôs DO THIS...Team Biden/Harris for the WIN!!!  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
While the whole Biden is late to picking a VP thing was clearly just faulty memories.  A running mate being selected and Nate still dithering on the 538 model is truly unique to this election cycle.
Interesting EP of  :   1) prediction about Airbnb IPO being shelved was squashed   2)  prediction about Kamala being Biden's running mate was spot on ( the news came out 15 mins after finished listening lol)   Also,  rocks.

The only plan the dems have, threaten us with coronavirus.  I'm still not voting for Biden.
Or they have a Case File Opened against Biden in Ukraine. He is being investigated. Could be charged. He's just as guilty. Also read the Mueller report. Says nothing about Trump being involved. He would have been charged. He wasn't.
Biden is a Ukrainian Puppet and has a Ponzi Scheme going there. He actually has a warrant out for his arrest
Give me a better source than that. I have evidence Biden is in bed with Ukraine
And, Harris went to bed with Hunter Biden she‚Äôs a hoe
The dens had like 28 people at one point! You cannot tell me that Biden is the best one out of all this people
Mark is a really smart guy, but he supports Joe Biden and it‚Äôs utterly puzzling
Biden: time for my virtue signaling tweet of the day
You don't see a crowded church there- I am sure that Secret Service nor Jill Biden would allow that
Joe Biden is and says he is a Catholic, the things he says and the things he is for are all against Catholic Religion! Abortion and hatred of the American people and the Republican Party and the President of the United States of America!ü¶Öüá∫üá∏
None of the plans put forth by Biden (taken from Bernie and AOC) will solve any of the challenges of climate change.  Joe Biden is not the solution to the problems he helped create.
Trump said, if I am re-elected, I will forgive payroll taxes. Like a forgivable loan! What is Biden going to say during a debate? No, I will not forgive it, force everyone to pay the back-taxes with penalties and interest?
God, I wish Biden was controlled by the Bernie Sanders wing of the party. You‚Äôd have to know nothing about politics to think that üòÇ
You‚Äôre nuttier than a Payday.  How has Trump done ‚Äúanything‚Äù to social security?  Biden already said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going raise your taxes‚Äù.  Evidently you don‚Äôt work or care about those that do
Just putting this out here so I can tell everyone I told you so.  Biden's VP is going to be Valerie Jarrett.
I actually don‚Äôt give a shit who Biden picks for VP and neither should you! It makes absolutely no difference to the average American! becuase regardless of who it is, it will be more of the same... He can pick Santa Clause for all I care, it won‚Äôt make one bit of difference!
Welp. This just might win the election for Biden.
These regrettable remarks are part of Biden's long history of racially tinged comments, such as his quip that you can't go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have an Indian accent or that any African Americans who don't support him aren't black.
Our non-scientific poll gives Trump a 33-7 yard sign margin over Biden in the key areas of northern Michigan and Wisconsin. We did not see any of the fabled Trump Boaters. Enthusiasm seems mixed.
We really must elect Biden
Biden should make the actual VP announcement while riding a bicycle. Every news org would be forced to play that clip, and it would show him to be fit and healthy.
Biden:  Build Back Better?  That is what you are going with?  Are you sure? Do you want to call a friend?
There appears to be zero urgency to do anything about it because everyone thinks Biden is way ahead.  I can't put my finger on it but this all feels very familiar.
Biden you can‚Äôt even read! You can‚Äôt leave your granddaughter and innocent kids alone long enjoy!
Replace ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù with Trump and I‚Äôll know you have a grasp on reality.
Obama brought more than "Hope". Obama created "Example" that we hold onto.  will set some things straight for us, clean up mess made by current admin, and be exemplary in "caregiving". Doesn't sound like much but a massive undertaking. Jill Biden is going to surprise us!
I think Biden needs to have a black VP running mate. #BLM
Whoever runs with Biden will be running the country.
It matters when Joe Biden is on a steepening mental decline.
Let's use McCabe's logic.  has repeatedly said that "China is not a problem." Also, he and his party, will not condemn the Chinese gov for not deterring the spread of Covid. THUS, using McCabe's logic, Biden must be a Chinese asset and we need a full  investigation.
Joe Biden is Supposedly Catholic But He Hasn‚Äôt Condemned Arson and Vandalism of Catholic Churches and he believes in abortion!
Hopefully, very few Biden supporters watch or buy their stuff. Also, something tells me that those who will vote for W were not planning to vote for Biden. I haven‚Äôt yet seen serious analysis of the ‚ÄúKanye voter.‚Äù
These are Joe Biden‚Äôs followers!
Biden you‚Äôre an idiot! And a pervert!
Biden is a idiot!
Disingenuous. Whoever  picks as VP will most likely become President if Biden is unable to serve a full term. That‚Äôs why Biden will surely not pick a progressive as VP. Just another corporate shill to maintain the status quo.
I'm at the point where settling for Biden makes some sense. I mean, he's a war hawk who supports border camps and the war on drugs, but maybe doctors won't be able to discriminate against trans people.
Was Joe Biden ever worthy of anyone‚Äôs vote?
Christ your Slow..... You can thank the Democrats for the Division.  Your nuttier than a Payday thinking Biden is a step up. Your still asleep
And that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll get if you elect Biden!!!!! #DrainTheSwamp #VoteRedToSaveAmerica  #VoteTrump2020
And you know Joe Biden didn‚Äôt write this.....  Jill tucked him in hours agoüôÑ
I refuse to listen to anything about #Biden speech from mr. #Thighland #YoSemites
Joe Biden is a practicing Catholic, btw...
Maggie, Biden was correct - AA community is less ethnically or culturally diverse (most of its members were born and live in the US) than Latin community (a conglomerat of various ethnicities and cultures many of whom still identify selves with nAtions of their origin).
Ah yes. Commies for Biden.
Obama committed treason. Hillary failed the Americans at Benghazi. Biden can‚Äôt complete a thought/sentence.
This nigga Joe Biden really said black people are a monolith üò≠üò≠üò≠ I fucking hate everything
Keep in mind, this is the same man who thought he had the authority to tell members of the Black community wether or not they were actually black because of who they might vote for. Biden has consistently reinforced the Black monolith stereotype...
Somewhere other than China or Russia. Biden and the Dems/Antifa control all that corrupt money...
Biden‚Äôs power to hurt God is unsurpassed by anyone in human history. But if true.

Well if I‚Äôm choosing between two allegedly racist, demented, nepotist, pedophiles, I‚Äôm 100% choosing the one who has far fewer credible offenses in every one of those categories, and that‚Äôs Biden.
Super cool cherry-picked, sourceless screenshot just to make Biden look like more of a racist idiot than the man currently in office.  Good try.
I'm voting for Biden simply to buy you guys (and myself) less resistance, less violence, and a higher likelihood of success in the near future. If that makes me not a leftist in your eyes, that's fine. And I also won't tell you you're not a leftist for not voting for Biden
Charlie is gonna keep cranking out these weak ass attempts to shed blame on the Biden campaign until well after the election
While his is not a radical disability platform (&amp; he is not my preferred candidate), it‚Äôs important that Biden reached out to disabled folks. I want a revolutionary platform, ‚ÄúBut evolution is good, and in disability policy, it‚Äôs often a lot slower and unimpressive as this.‚Äù
Exactly. That's what it feels like those of Vaush's ilk are doing: shitting on people and saying they are not leftists simply because they don't understand "the political game" or don't understand why voting for Biden is a good strategic choice. As a result, alienating them.
You don‚Äôt have to be crazy for Biden to know trump is a power crazed loon.  Vote for Biden.
This this this this this do NOT for a SINGLE SECOND think that your contribution to our movement is going to start and stop with voting Biden in November. It is the smartest choice strategically, but you can't justify it if you aren't going to fucking follow up.
So what? The general populace thinks Biden is far-left. That might be cringe to us, but if he wins, it will show everybody that the left is viable and it's what the ppl want. So what will you do with that? How will you take advantage of that power surge, regardless how misguided?
This Biden discourse is fucking tiring, guys. It is unquestionable that, compared to a trump re-election, Biden will be less harmful in the short term, and a lot of the pressure on our protests will ease off. Focus more on what we are going to do during that time.
Cancel me, say I'm not a real socialist or lefty if you want, but I genuinely want us to get more time, a little less resistance, no matter how small, so we can take this movement farther. If that means you cancel me, leave me behind, and protest Biden in 2021 even harder,
Now, for those that follow me that very much don't agree and don't want to vote for Biden, do it. More power to you, my dude. And if you are a rape victim, by all means don't vote for him. That is perfectly reasonable. I will not shame you as Vaush did or say you're not a leftist
Look, I'm not gonna pretend. Biden is absolute garbage. Harris is absolute garbage. They're both neoliberals, and neoliberals enable fascism. Capitalism enables fascism. However, in this election, voting them in, to me, is the best option to buy us more time.
It is perfectly, perfectly valid to say letting Trump win will validate that fascism works. However, if you are telling victims of rape they have to vote for Biden regardless of how much it hurts them or retraumatizes them, you are a piece of shit.
breaking down exactly why voting for Biden will work, how this "game" you are entailing works, etc. The only sole video entirely dedicated to this topic you have (afaik) is that last one. I think it would really help your point instead of just pushing more ppl away.
I think instead of making the people who really really really don't want to vote for Biden angry by calling them grifters and assuming they know how to play "the game" I think it would be really cool and really helpful to make a full video
While I very much don't agree with Vaush's characterization of the people I follow who don't have the privilege to stomach a Biden/Harris ticket as grifters, he was right about not voting at all. If you don't vote, they will continue catering to boomers.
While I won't tell anyone either way to vote for Biden or vote down ballot, there is absolutely no excuse to not vote at all imo. Like, shit, at least vote Green party so maybe they get some funding. Not voting completely throws any potential out the window
So, Biden picking a cop as his running mate was pretty much the death sentence huh? Lol maybe THIS year we vote libertarian? Like all of us?
Even if Biden wins, I don't think I'll ever truly be happy until Trump is either in prison or dead.
I mean if you are a fan of George W. Bush, Colin Powell, and Mitt Romney, the Biden/Harris ticket is a perfect fit for you.
üá∫üá∏YOUR NEXT VICE-PRESIDENT: Sen. Kamala Harris! Making history, making women everywhere proud, making us ALL stand taller. An inspiration to WOC! I‚Äôm beyond excited about Joe Biden‚Äôs pick and am aligned with her as we take on the Pence Bros! #LakeVsPence #BidenHarris2020
Don't forget Biden !
Biden Selected, Not Elected - Look For The Dirtiest Election In US History  via  send in the clown!
Same! I've been pushing the opinions I have because people literally shit on leftists every day when they say they're not voting for Biden. We are not super relevant unfortunately and most people are liberals
For as much as Vaush says he's into left unity and not alienating people with different beliefs than you he sure is quick to call leftists with legitimate concerns about a Biden/Harris presidency grifters
I literally had to try super hard to find any sort of videos on his position for this election and he's just going off saying people are dumb fucks instead of going in depth on why voting for Biden is going to work. Don't just assume people know how "the political game"
Vaush realizes that what he is saying isnt helping anybody and will probably make most lefties double down on not voting for Biden right? Like, being an asshole doesn't convince people. Maybe make a whole explanational video on this and we'll see.
Vaush is pretending like voting for Biden isn't the predominant thing people are already going to do lmao
Settle for Biden 2020
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks   This is the kind of thing we would have to deal with if he wins! #KAG üá∫üá∏
If someone offered to give me a million dollars to vote for Joe Biden I would not take the money No amount of money could make me vote for a worthless liberal! I love my country and have too much respect for myself to ever vote for a progressive liberal!
It costs $0 for white people to hush and listen to BIPOC about their frustrations regarding Biden/Harris.
Biden on women, everyday: "You gotta sniff 'em."
Oh, and as far as I can tell, Biden isn‚Äôt racist. He isn‚Äôt homophobic. He isn‚Äôt a lot of things that Trump definitely is.
Has Biden done shady things? Duh. What politician doesn‚Äôt have something on them? You can‚Äôt seriously say Biden is shady then go vote for Trump. He‚Äôs the shadiest, stupidest one I‚Äôve ever seen.
I am thrilled that you will be Biden‚Äôs running mate! You are a great choice for VP, and I think you‚Äôre ready to be Pres if called on. Your thoughtful leadership is BADLY needed. My entire family is on board‚Ä¶ #BidenHarris2020
If only Presidential elections were about ideologies and proper governance, but, they aren't. Joe Biden picked Kamela Harris so they can be the ultimate NeoLiberal/Centrist swing vote. The Left just has to suck it up to save this country from Trumpism.
Joe Biden with the head of the KKK Robert Byrd
Am getting so Damm sick Joe Biden putting WHITE PPL DOWN        F **k HIM
Have you guys heard that song Havana ft Young Thug by Kamala Harris?!? No wonder Joe Biden picked her. That shit slaps!!!
Yeah that's my biggest fear tbh about Biden and Harris winning. It will make the problems seem solved because we would avoid some of the more drastic direct action at the cost of making it seem like we really changed something for the better when we didn't
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.
But yeah it is really coming down to a lesser of two evils and I do genuinely think Biden being more covert and nice about it enables liberals to think problems are solved and we're all good
goes to Biden‚Äôs site
But that's generally the vibe I get from people advocating for voting Biden. Is because they're genuinely scared for their lives and don't think Biden would take direct, fascistic action to harm people
But, for instance, I don't think that Biden would send federal police into a state where BLM protests are happening against the wishes of said state in order to brutalize protesters. But then again that is me  hoping he wouldn't lmao
I think what he is saying is that Trump can make more direct, drastic action (in the same way that you say "we can't wait") that would cause more immediate harm than Biden would. Not saying that that would make me vote for Biden, because I'm generally in agreement.
They have been teeing it up for months.  Bernie bro‚Äôs won‚Äôt vote for us, Russia is meddling in the 2020 election, built in excuses to disguise that they would love Biden in office but they are ok with Trump and a scapegoat or two!
ay man whats the alternative tho? people complaining about Kanyes mental health but then go and vote for Biden or they complain that Kanye racist and misogynistic and then vote for Trump üòÇ
Ludicrous! Almost as much as his Biden hates God thing is! Hahahahaha hahahahaha
Man, yesterday started with me seeing a video of Ben Shapiro reading WAP and ended with Biden picking Kamala Harris as his running mate. What a fucking rollercoaster.
I have. The studies cited within the fact check actually say that it helped. Dr. Fauci says that it saved many lives. Yet, Biden called Trump a xenophobe and wouldn't have shut down any of our borders. Many more would have died b
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate is that supposed to impress me? It doesn't It only serves to make me even more determined to vote for Trump!
Biden coulda picked Candace Owens and got the same response.  Cuz by yall logic, it's a black woman = automatically beneficial for black people.
You're right dude, and I don't shame you for not voting Biden. Shit I'm even considering it and have been for months. It's a shitty decision and if you genuinely believe it'll be a better option more power to you comrade
No, I'm trying to engage in a conversation with you lmao I don't want to vote for Biden and if you think so you've got it real twisted my friend
So like, just don't give them any funding or chance at all? And what you are saying sounds a little bit like then options are either move Biden left (which would be... Dubious to say the least without bumfuckery happening), or revolution
Wonder what the over/under line is on how long it take for Biden to get caught sniffing her hair?
Also keep in mind I am leery of any argument that involves convincing Biden or Harris to "move left" since every single decision the Biden campaign has made feels too uncannily close to deliberately choosing to shit on progressives.
What do you think we should do as leftists, now what the ticket is set? Comment to explain if you want! I still don't have a set decision since I think Trump is really bad short term and Biden would be bad long term, but I'm willing to consider the arguments
get ready American Harris said ‚ÄúI will do WHATEVER it takes to get Biden elected‚Äù.  Looks like a lot of blow jobs will be coming our way. Never thought the ancestor of a slave owner would stoop so low?
Fascist far right. It‚Äôs damage control at this point. I‚Äôm settling for Biden sadly. But don‚Äôt want Trump.
The fact  isn‚Äôt speaking at the Democratic Convention, but anti-choice and anti-union Republican John Kasoch is pretty sad. If the Biden campaign wants to use Kasich for an Ohio ad, go for it, but keep him away from the convention.
Voting for Biden is just damage control at this point. We are still allowed to criticize him and his running mate, especially if we are voting for him. I‚Äôm a little disheartened that he seems eager to put Republicans in his cabinet.
Well we know for a fact it happened under Obama/ Biden. I'm not compromising my stances.
It's not nitpicking, I'm not gonna vote for someone I'm fighting against. I'm not gonna vote for profit prisons. I'm not gonna vote for someone who is tough on crime in low income areas. Dems fucked themselves. What do you think Biden/Harris will change?
jesus christ, just read the fucking letter. the ‚Äúwhite moderate‚Äù in the letter literally refers the person who looks at people fighting for justice and says ‚Äúyou need to be patient‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too radical‚Äù. it‚Äôs absolutely not a reach to say joe biden is that moderate.
I think Yang represents something entirely different than both sides of the party. There‚Äôs a large base in the party who‚Äôs left of Biden but is not getting behind another failed Sanders (or someone of his ilk) ‚Äúrevolution.‚Äù Yang is perfect to bridge the gap and bring new people.
This only holds validity of Jo plans on doing what you believe Biden and Harris are not going to. So.. Jo, wanna tell us what you think about defunding?
There were supposed to be this many. The initial estimates by Fauci and Birx were 100-240k deaths. If he hasn't banned travel to China and Europe the number would've been much much higher. Joe Biden wouldn't have banned travel anywhere.
President Trump responds to Biden's selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate
Despite the negatives behind Kamala Harris as well as Joe Biden, I would love *pause for emphasis* to see Kamala destroy Mike Pence in a debate. From one Hoosier to another, it's what I've always wanted. ü§©
Joe Biden with the Tuesday afternoon news dump.
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.
I'm in the middle of a liquor store parking lot, floored at this VP pick, legitimately wondering if Biden is doing this to shit on progressives intentionally. Like. WHAT
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his VP running mate.
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate  via
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate  via
It could not matter less to me who Biden chooses for veep. He could name Jesus Christ or Gandhi or Buddha or whomever and it‚Äôs still gonna take me getting completely trashed on Election Day to convince myself to vote for him. ‚ÄúLesser evil‚Äù oh haha fuck you.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden as damage control. I won‚Äôt be afraid to point out flaws of the VP pick.
we don‚Äôt even know who Biden‚Äôs VP will be &amp; I‚Äôm not ready for the eruption of misogyny, and most likely racism, that is already present for the VP pick.   We owe her better than that.
This is great! His attacks on Biden‚Äôs morality is excellent for Democrats! It makes home look even mire like the imbecile he us! It‚Äôs great! It‚Äôs so absurd people can see how crazy Trump is!
Yes! Biden is smarter, fitter, kinder, mire experienced... he will return America to the greatness it has enjoyed up until Trump. Yes!!!
Did you see Joe Biden riding his bike with a mask...but no helmet! You can‚Äôt make this up!
Did Biden remember to bring the girls home and critique on the couch watching TV.
Biden comes out of his basement and sees his shadow.  That means 4 more years of Trump?
This must piss off the GOP. Their talking point / primary policy is that Biden is incapable of functioning. Yet Trump showed us he was unable to hold a glass of water in one hand, needed a general to hold his hand to walk down a ramp, and Trump is unable to read a teleprompter.
my dad just called joe biden bi joeden
Did you mention Biden as if he isn't a part of the Swamp? Lmao. Been in politics for 50 years.
Donald Trump calling communion a sip of wine and a cracker then talkin about how Biden is anti-religious
Biden should not have limited his options by saying that he‚Äôs choosing a female VP and strongly suggesting that it will be a minority woman. If there‚Äôs a man out there who could help flip Texas then choose him, and work on diversity with cabinet positions
Hell no Donal still got elected after raw dogging a pornstar paying her and his mistress admitting to grabbing pussies which is illegal and buddying up with the Turks the Russians and the North Koreans Biden could shoot somebody on 5th avenue and not lose my vote
MUST WATCH: Tucker Carlson Warns America About Biden‚Äôs Possible VP Picks  via
Are the Republicans who called VP Joe Biden not politically correct enough, when it comes to the comments he made about a black reporter needing a test to see whether he is on coke or not, going to be held accountable? Many of you always say there‚Äôs a double standard! ...
Just saw Joe Biden on a bike! The picture of fitness as opposed to your morbidly obese ass!
Biden needs to be given equal time for every press conference or briefing, especially the partisan way he does them complete with derogatory terms for democrats.
Just the simple fact that we have a petulant, childish president who calls those who disagree with him names gives Joe Biden an edge in this election. What adult calls people names????
Well the right thinks he's socialist, far left, and hates God so proportionally I wouldn't be surprised if centrists thought Biden was on the left LMAO
Nah. You cant blame the voters for the actions of the person they voted for unless that's what they support. I blame Biden, Trump, and the system that upholds them for the consequences of voting for them. Any one of them could solve the issues in this country but they choose not.
Again you are asserting that I don't agree with you that Trump is worse but, again, saying Biden is part of the reason why Trump was elected and why we have the problems we do is also a valid position.
Even though the "as bad" argument is arbitrary when Biden was part of the setup for the "worse" option
Legislation that has perpetuated and exacerbated racism, as well as killed untold numbers of minorities in this country is not just "shitty legislation." It's why we have the BLM movement that we have right now. And again I never said Biden is "as bad" as Trump
You can vote for Biden without justifying anything he has done, especially him writing the crime bill and simply apologizing for it instead of taking any sort of meaningful policy positions to reverse it.
Yo why are you getting so mad chill. I never said that's what you were doing. I'm saying that too many people are invalidating the very real concerns of others when it comes to Biden. That has nothing to do with using him as damage mitigation.
I understand your concerns but there are also concerns the other way. From both minorities, sexual assault survivors, and progressives. Its perfectly understandable to use Biden as way to get Trump out of office but pretending he's anything more is dubious at best
I cant remember his exact wording but saying extremely racist things even today doesn't exactly help your case. I don't doubt that Trump will do that. I'm saying that there are plenty of POC that don't want Joe Biden in office for very valid reasons. As well as rape victims.
I don't blame anyone for voting Biden but pushing him as anything other than SOLELY a way to get Trump out of office and nothing more is questionable at best.
Youunderstand that Biden wrote a crime bill that has demonized black ppl for far longer than Trump has been in presidency right? I'm not invalidating yours or others concerns about re-electing trump but that's a two way street bc there are plenty who have been demonized by Joe.
Wut? Just because somebody is privileged doesn't mean they can't have concerns for others about a given candidate. I understand that both candidates are bad and mitigating damage is a valid way to feel with voting Biden over Trump.
He's not wrong. If you don't want people to invalidate your (very valid) concerns about a Joe Biden presidency then please don't invalidate the concerns of others who are concerned about a Trump re-election. This is coming from a leftist.
Bruh Biden isn‚Äôt even campaigning anymore. He‚Äôll be lucky if he gets 10% of all votes.
I live in Indiana where I guarantee Trump will win by 8-15 points.  I don't plan on voting Biden as of now, but if I lived in a different state I would have the same thoughts as you do.
If Biden wins; China wins but if President Trump wins; Russia wins. I see nothing good from these two outcomes  Seeing Trump as ‚Äòunpredictable,‚Äô China would prefer he not win reelection, intelligence official says
If you don't want people to invalidate your very real and credible concerns about a Biden campaign then I sure as hell better not catch you invalidating someone else's very real and credible concerns about Trump being re-elected. Criticize Biden as the solution? Sure.
But yes. Biden makes it harder and harder to make that choice every single fucking day. It's like he wants to lose or at least doesn't give a shit about fucking over progressives openly and blatantly
Not to mention federal police being deployed to areas that aren't Washington DC without the consent of the governor's in said state. It's a shitty choice and Biden isn't gonna solve anything but I don't blame them. Shitty choice no matter what.
i support you ~ but too say Joe Biden is against GOD makes you look really bad
Don't compare the two. Biden has dementia. Trump is at least capable of coherent thoughtPeople just remember the vote is not just for Biden-Harris. It's also to replace Bill Barr, Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper, Betsy Devos, and the entire corrupt regime......we need change now so don‚Äôt forget to vote.
As a whole we're fucked up kamala and biden y'all really happy for that
With Biden as her fellow running mate, and historical family slave holding, this team is gonna get a lot of black votes... NOT
Vote Biden. The country will not survive 4 more years of trump. We will be struggling to get thru to January

wow that is crazy...hard to believe actually..i dont like biden at all but miss harris seems ok.....i really wanted bernie &amp; now i dont know who id vote for of i could..

With VP Pick Kamala Harris, Joe Biden Gets a Digital Juggernaut | WIRED
Trump tries scaring suburban women; Biden tries to meet their real needs
And Joe Biden knows what year it is
I think my favorite part about Harris being VP nominee is that she literally  said she believes Biden's sexual assault/harrassment accusers, which means she has zero integrity because she chose to accept the nomination anyway.   She believes women, but she supports their abusers.
She also called him a racist on national television. The democratic party is a farce. America deserves better than Biden/Harris. The disrespect for Gabbard is unreal.
Biden is 190 years old, its obvious what is going on
About right I‚Äôd say for Biden

Nope,nor do they to Harris or Biden and in many ways Trump too
Neither him nor Biden will do it. Both are benefiting from its continued status as schedule 1. Plus Cheeto doesn‚Äôt have any cabinet members educated on cannabis because he picked a bunch of corporate shills like himself

#1: Biden didn‚Äôt ‚ÄúChoose‚Äù Harris,the DNC did 4 him. #2: How is Biden empathic??  #3: Harris is NOT black
Into some of the WORST politicians in Washington to ever exist since Nixon??   Btw,I‚Äôm very much against Cheeto too &amp; most of his actions.  Biden &amp; Harris are inherently evil üëø
Biden didn‚Äôt PICK Harris.........
Biden didn‚Äôt PICK his VP,are you that obtuse¬ø?? ü§®
Both are HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!! A Biden presidency will NOT solve our biggest problems.  Choose Freedom, prosperity &amp; equality 4 ALL with  #Batwoman4POTUS  #ShesWithUs    #VoteGold2020
Haven't watched the news closely but why would Biden name Kamala VP when he died two days ago?ü§î #WWE
Lol I can‚Äôt make you understand it   But if Biden and Harris get in, you‚Äôll understand then
Most black people in this country hate come Kamala Harris. Biden just put the final nail in this coffin. He's done...
Biden picks the first Jamaican/Indian woman to be his VP.
So what does Ted Cruz have to say? BLM R THE VERY LAST GROUP ANYONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING WOULD ACCUSE OF BIBLE BURNING. THIS IS A GROUP WHOSE HERO IS JOHN LEWIS. GUESS RUSSIANS DONT KNOW THAT. THIS IS FOLLOWUP TO TRUMPS INSANE RANT BIDEN AGAINST GOD,THE BIBLE&amp; WOULD ‚ÄúHURT GOD‚Äùü§Ø
I sure hope Biden picking Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt backfire. There are still a lot of people who don‚Äôt want to see a woman VP.
We know,neither Cheeto nor Biden will debate  #Batwoman4POTUS #LetHerDebate   Why are you so afraid  Invite us onstage #LetHerSpeak
I thought it went to Biden?? ü§îü§î  So which is it¬ø?  Oh right,it ONLY goes to  ü¶îüá∫üá∏üóΩ #BatMaam #ShesWithUs

He also said we need to pull out of this Vietnam war..
Cut it out. Diversionary tactics and republican lies aren‚Äôt working anymore. Word has it you are laundering info from Russia to attack Biden. That‚Äôs believable. That would make you a russian asset. You might want to consider a carrier alternative if you are not jailed.
I‚Äôm pissed and offended at the Republican Party for thinking that we would vote for crazy ass Kayne instead of Biden in the first place...we were done with Kayne years ago
Oh God! He‚Äôs attacking Dems, Biden, mail in voting...they‚Äôre trying to steal the election.  You‚Äôre getting interference from Russia again, you slowed the mail, so, who‚Äôs stealing the election?  Babbling sack of shit.

He ain‚Äôt white but that‚Äôs a pretty goddamned racist take he has there. Why is it beyond comprehension that Harris or Rice might‚Äôve been the front runners all along? I don‚Äôt think Biden would‚Äôve cornered himself without knowing one was the pick.
I never cease to be amazed at the stupidity of this woman she and Biden could share the same cell
From attacking Biden saying he wants to ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù then question Joe‚Äôs faith, to constantly attacking Democrats.  Donald has been an evil, lying, hateful, unintelligent, arrogant waste of space for decades and he‚Äôs escalating so he won‚Äôt go to jail.
Is America really ready for an atheist president like Joe Biden?  Someone that is OK with closing churches and burning bibles?

Is that cheating? Is propping they market up like that heading for a huge drop? Then after Biden takes office it will drop and republicans will try to blame it on him,. Isn‚Äôt this money just adding to the deficit. Taking care of the stock market but not the unemployed.

Democrats will do everything possible to keep Sleepy Joe Biden from a debate with the POTUS!!
So you worship the almight dollar? Not God? Cause Biden &amp; family do not know God. I imagine you knew that tho...
There is no one Biden could pick as VP that would justify allowing trump to win reelection

I hope Biden's team, his attorneys, anyone in our government has been preparing counteraction for when this goes down. Personally, I can't take much more of this and I'm suffering. Watching the transition to authoritarianism while people cheer it on is just too much.
What failure in the Obama/Biden WH? They led with dignity and class. Economy was turned around after the worse recession not prompted by a global pandemic, but greed. If politicians had the American ppl on their minds, we‚Äôd have health care that makes sense. The man n WH b/c of u
Me too! I am so anxious I can barely sleep. It is heart-rending to watch those who know better and can do better stand by and do nothing! I am so sad, but so ready to stand and vote. Biden/Harris 2020
People just remember the vote is not just for Biden-Harris. It's also to replace Bill Barr, Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper, Betsy Devos, and the entire corrupt regime......we need change now so don‚Äôt forget to vote.
I do.  I don‚Äôt want any doubters at this time. Trump has got to go. If Biden/Harris do not do what the American people can respect, they can go too in 2024. Democracy is at stake with that guy in the WH!
Yes! I hope there are fewer like you. If Chump is doing so many unconstitutional things out in the open, I can only imagine what‚Äôs going on beneath the surface. Biden/Harris 2020.

Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.

Please DJT keep helping Biden/ Harris ,keep talking! I would, if I were you go on television 10 times a day and quadruple down on everything you say. Tell the world you are a Golden God or an Orange one anyway! #FailedPresident
As the A.G she failed at running her office, then she failed at managing her campaign, but somehow she's right to manage the country when Biden dies. We should promote her for incompetence and poor management skills. ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this, but this is NOT the election to push for a 3rd party. it‚Äôs just not.   please vote biden-harris. tr*mp needs to get the fuck out of the white house
I question whether there were any intentions in the part of Biden at all. I do think that the hadith is in line with modern Dems attempt at totalitarianism and the silencing of speech.

In 2013, Joe Biden and Hunter Biden flew aboard Air Force Two to China. Ten days later, Hunter Biden's firm inked a $1,500,000,000.00 deal with a subsidiary of the Communist Chinese government's Bank of China.
But Biden backs the thugs at home
Bill, just say it.... you back Biden, a Democrat
I kept on smiling the entire time that she and Joe Biden were speaking.
Vacate the People's House, immediately. We need to fumigate before President Biden moves in.

Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
This is who Biden chose? ü•¥
Really is this simple. But your life is still fine, so just keep voting and saying yes to the system. You don‚Äôt choose your place in time, but you can choose to make it better. It‚Äôs deeper than Trump/Biden.   You watched home alone? Read what that child star tells you with his xp
Biden could have picked Jesus Christ as his running mate and I still wouldn‚Äôt consider voting for him.
I wont lie...I‚Äôm not too much into politics and I thought Biden made the right choice picking an African American female...bro...i did not know she was Uncle Ruckus‚Äôs Wifeüò≠üò≠shorty ova racist.
I get a lot of crap talk from old Trump voters who criticize Biden‚Äôs physical and mental health, but when I turn the tables on them they get all offended and attack me. üôÑ
The same way Joe Biden gets a pass on sexual assault
I also think they might have stolen the whole ‚Äúunity‚Äù idea from  with their ‚ÄúBiden-Sanders unity task force.‚Äù
And Joe Biden knows what year it is
Yeah idgaf what shitty propagandas and past events y‚Äôall throw on Biden and Kamala. Nothing they‚Äôve done compares to the atrocities of Donald Trump.
Biden and Harris what a team against Trump and his corruption
I think my favorite part about Harris being VP nominee is that she literally  said she believes Biden's sexual assault/harrassment accusers, which means she has zero integrity because she chose to accept the nomination anyway.   She believes women, but she supports their abusers.
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday.
She also called him a racist on national television. The democratic party is a farce. America deserves better than Biden/Harris. The disrespect for Gabbard is unreal.
The left has called every Republican from Ronald Reagan to Bush 41,43, McCain, and Romney, who was laughed at for calling Russia our geopolitical foe in 2012, a fascist. According to recent intelligence Russia wants Trump but China and Iran want Biden. Where are you from?
Trump picked a racist white dude who was a failed governor as VP. Biden picked an accomplished woman of color. I think we know who cares about America.
Remember when Joe Biden was accused of sexual assault? Pedo Joe 2020 üëçüèªüá∫üá∏

Idk how I'm going to vote. All choices are super terrible in regards to decency (Trump) and policy/philosophy (Biden/Harris). That's not to say I don't have disagreements with Trump but I have more disagreements with Biden/Harris. I'd be on board had it been Klobuchar
I honestly can't vote for Biden/Harris. Tbh I'm not a fan of Trump either. I don't like his conduct, his hardline stance on immigration or his overall more protectionist leanings. I'm more with Reagan/Romney/McCain on policy &amp; philosophy. Idk what to do this election.
And yet I still can't vote for Biden/Harris. I had an emotional reaction after the announcment to vote for Trump but idk. The only good GOPer on my ballot that i have more in common on policy is my great governor of Indiana  and I'll happily vote for him.
Kamala doesn‚Äôt have the trust of the black community. They crucified her during the debates for her actions as AG of California from 2011-17 and DA 2004-2011. She was a sharp enemy of Biden then and threw lots of low blows...now they‚Äôre partners? Doesn‚Äôt look good.
still cant believe out of 27 candidates we even got Joe Biden
the Internet moves extremely fast. pictured: Joe Biden and sgt. Kamala Harris arresting young activist Bernie Sanders for peacefully protesting (1964)
And she on the reecord calling Biden is a racist and a rapist. Should be fun watching her reinvent that narrative.
Sorry, I don't like Trump or his more nationalist &amp; protectionist policies but it doesn't mean I can just turn my back on conservative policy positions I've had since before him and enthusiastically endorse the far-left Biden/Harris ticket.
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Kamala Harris. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Is this serious or is it a seriously bad joke? All I can say is WOW!!!! Anyone that would vote for this ticket must have their head firmly planted up their own ass!!!!
It's one thing to oppose Trump for his demeanor and say you'll vote Biden just to get rid of Trump but they are enthusiastically supporting policy positions opposed by the GOP even before Trump. That says something about the "principled" folks.
Most black people in this country hate come Kamala Harris. Biden just put the final nail in this coffin. He's done...
Biden picks the first Jamaican/Indian woman to be his VP.
I honestly can't tell if Biden's campaign is like really dense on purpose rn
I wasn't going to vote in this election. I didn't like the choices of Trump or Biden, however, with the thought of far-left Kamala Harris a heartbeat away from the presidency I'll hold back my vomit and vote for Trump.
Trump vs Biden Pence vs Harris  I'm looking forward to the debates.
For the record a brown paper bag is better than Mike Pence as VP. Love Harris as Biden‚Äôs running mate! #KamalaHarrisForVP #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBiden2020
Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
"I would be inclined to go a different route than what he's done," President Trump said commenting on Joe Biden's potential VP choice. "He said he had to pick a woman. He said that, and you know, some people would say men are insulted by that and some people would say it is fine
Whoever would you vote for Biden.  You do realize the ol Bernie here advocates for communism right?  And Biden is fully on board with that?

No, but Jr. might run or DeSantis or Pompeo. So yes, more Trump. That's why Biden's VP pick is so important. She needs to be able to beat one of the above right-wing nuts.

Damn, you also stan Gaga? Who denounced her work with rapist R Kelly, but not rapist Joe Biden?ü§¢ Explains your support for abusersü•¥
No, there are many edited and non-contextualized of things Biden has said. Has he always been perfect? Of course not. But has he ever paid for a full-page in The NY Times calling for the execution of kids like yours (who happened to be innocent)?
Its true and its an historical accomplishment. Criticize our "system" all you like, make alterations if you can track the results but by no mean "fundamentally change" it. That's madness and that's what Biden says he wants to do.
He also said we need to pull out of this Vietnam war..
So you're basically a hypocrite. Chastising people for wanting to vote for Biden because they hate Trump, but you're voting for Trump because of some BS lies about Biden. Makes perfect sense. What rock have you been under with all the racist shit Trump has said/done?
What keeps me up at night is wondering if our votes will count if Russia changes them. Or that mailed ballots get lost. That people will believe the fake dirt on Biden they'll kick up. That they'll actually arrest Biden. I wonder what we can do to stop it.
I‚Äôm pissed and offended at the Republican Party for thinking that we would vote for crazy ass Kayne instead of Biden in the first place...we were done with Kayne years ago
I thought some fat orange guy said Biden never comes out of his bunker?!
Oh God! He‚Äôs attacking Dems, Biden, mail in voting...they‚Äôre trying to steal the election.  You‚Äôre getting interference from Russia again, you slowed the mail, so, who‚Äôs stealing the election?  Babbling sack of shit.
You. Are. Lying. But guess what? I do not care what kind of fabricated bs Bill Barr or your committee releases on Biden before the election. I will vote for him anyway and declare that if Trump can do it, so can Biden. FATWO
Biden‚Äôs been the nominee for months, you can‚Äôt equate Obama and Clinton picking since they had actual competitive primaries.......
Not feeling that voice...Biden needs a voice that speaks with authority like Morgan Freeman or that "Safe drivers save 40%" Guy Dennis Haysbert
It‚Äôs not true that Joe Biden is a predator? Are you okay? ü•¥
Trump has the vote fix in on the US side by sabotaging the USPS and Russia has the fix in with hacked voting machines and fabricated dirt on Biden. This is all I think about along with COVID.
Don‚Äôt let Ye trying to take votes from Biden distract y‚Äôall from the fact that Rick Ross had a masseuse, and 2 Chainz brought ‚ÄúEssential Workers‚Äù to their Verzuz #iykyk

‚ÄúI worry that the Catholic Church in America is not taking seriously enough how a Biden presidency might threaten the freedom of the Church in America. Catholic hospitals, schools and charities will surely be forced to choose whether to operate in communion with

I just begged my sisters to vote for Biden even though I absolutely disapprove of him. Get trump out of office.  Please.
I only hope that the Trump administration decides to spy on Biden and Harris just like the Obama administration did to Trump . I mean, come on ....what‚Äôs fair is fair?

Biden, but work to help progressives down ballot in your state and others.
Whats also "out there" is your collusion with Kanye. So I guess. according to your standards, we should be looking into that as well?  No one campaigns harder for Biden/Harris than the Trump family.  They speak, Biden's numbers increase.
My grandmother said that Biden "won't be able to control" Kamala Harris, and I'm just WOW.
If #BidenHarris2020 happens, Its going to be a continuation of the status quo and the disastrous neoliberal corporatist politics for at least 8 years. Think about that..  Nothing will fundamentally change. Not under Trump. Not under Biden.  #GeneralStrike
Yeah Biden who is nearly brain dead will be great.  How can you vote for a man who is nearly 80 with undeniable symptoms of dementia.  ???
Did you actually thin Joe would make it to election day? Imagine the Bernie supporters if she ends up the head of the ticket. What does happen when polling goes south and Biden keeps losing his mind?
Unless you are hunkered down in a basement eating Tapioca and are unable to go out to groceries, big box retailers , etc. in which case u can apply for the Biden Absentee ballot!
We laugh at you/Tucker every night as you both continue to campaign for Joe Biden.  Keep up the sterling work, the both of you!!  +12 points today and growing. I cant wait to see how much we gain after this mini rally today where you talk about saving a war that wasnt happening
With a parachute? Or are you that worried that Biden's gonna win?
Neither will this suburban housewife!!! Biden/Harris 2020üôåüôå
Evan I'd like to thank you for the work you are doing to help Joe Biden/Kamala Harris win in November. Every single time Republicans/Trumpers talk or act in an outright ignorant fashion like this, Joe's polling #'s go up. He is up 12 points today and with this pic, even higher
Braun is at his least believable when he says things like Biden/Harris represent a "radical left ticket of liberal anarchy."
NOT EVEN KANYE is there!!!!  Biden's polling numbers are +12 today and the more they do ignorant things like this, the higher they will go, so please Republicans and Trumpers keep up this sterling work!!! We are counting on YOU to help elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Trump - "Kamala is nasty" - "AOC is dumb" - "Elizabeth Warren is nasty"  So I'm confused - what is the common interest there Jared?  Keep talking.  Biden's poll numbers increase every time you speak.  Biden up 12 full points as of yesterday and with all the BS today, even more.
Lib Journos, especially  and  are too busy figuring out how to provide immense cover for Biden during the debates to cover the #Trump peace deal with UAE and Israel.
Antifa dot com lead you to a biden fundraiser until it went down due to it going viral on twitter
Some preemptive  &amp;  fact checking:  "Most pro-abortion ticket ever" Biden is a devout Catholic.  "Most anti-Israel ticket ever" Harris is married to a Jewish attorney. Her stepkids call her "Momala," a play on her name &amp; the Yiddish ‚ÄúMamaleh,‚Äù which means little mama.

So, Herman Cain is tweeting out editorials against Biden and Harris this morning. You know, the guy who died two weeks ago, because of Trump.   Every time I want to say something is peak 2020, they raise the mountaintop on me.

Let‚Äôs be honest, the DNC chose you because they knew Biden was going to lose. They needed to pick someone whose seat would go to a Democrat without fear of a Republican taking the seat. You are the sacrifice. üòÜ
So.... Biden is physically fit?
BIDEN -HARRIS speeches lastnight were PURE BULLSHIT. Full of lies. They didn‚Äôt show anything. The only thing they guaranteed is Trump will be re-elect November 3,2020
He has next to nothing to throw at Biden and Kamala. ‚ÄúBiden is mentally unfit‚Äù so is Trump. ‚ÄúBiden says racist things‚Äù so does Trump except Biden has Obama and now kamala. ‚ÄúKamala is a cop‚Äù trump wishes he had her criminal justice record. ‚ÄúThey are far left‚Äù no they arent
You might have a certain privilege if you are able to equate the cons of a Biden victory with the cons of a Trump victory.
Kamala was my first choice a year ago and she still is. I'll let others be Anti-Trump. I will be positive and support Biden-Harris.
I know.  Then again, these rabid conservatives would have painted anyone Biden chose as a "Marxist".
If your looking for a laugh look at Lori Hendry's Twitter feed.  She has said that Kamala Harris isn't black, that Trump retweets her all the time, and that Joe Biden sexually assaults every women he ever met. Her greatest goal in life is to have her privates grabbed by any Trump
Kamala really said this? And there are people who will vote for her and Biden? Not thinking long term, are they!
This is how screwed up Sleepy Joe is in the head.  Schools should teach America History &amp; Civics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Biden: Schools should ramp up 'Islamic faith' studies, Muslims must 'mobilize' against Trump  via
John Kasich still has influence in Republican politics.  He may well be able to put Ohio in play, and keep it there, for Biden.  And, if we want people to reach across the aisle, it‚Äôs good that he‚Äôs making the effort.  AOC can have more time without this cancel Kasich bs.
I WISH I could see the ‚ÄúList of Rules‚Äù that the ‚ÄúFree Press‚Äù had to abide by at Biden‚Äôs press conferences today!!!  Rumors are that they couldn‚Äôt show Harris in any state of emotion, nothing unflattering, not if her voice is raised, etc...   Trump is NEVER given that courtesy.
Donna. I agree with you. I‚Äôm sure you know you have some haters and trolls on this feed. Keep up the good work. Go Biden\Harris.
I had to turn it off after three minutes. Joe Biden is a liar and a fraud! Kamala is no better, sending all those folks to jail while she sits there having the luxury to talk about smoking (and inhaling)! #DrainTheSwamp
If you google  it will take you to Biden / Harris website.                 That says it all.
Biden-Harris campaign launch uses the Style Council version of Move on Up to end their press conference. Hope Paul's ok with that.
Im voting. Not for biden or trump.
Biden/Harris: At least we aren't Trump/Pence
Sick of dumb ass niggas...just last week they were posting black and white selfies on social media talking bout, "I'm such and such and I will never tear down another black woman/man...blah, blah, blah..." Biden chose Kamala and the bullshit started...üòë #BidenHarris2020
Biden speaks lies.
since Kamala is a great counter to 2 of trump's big strategy points at this point in the election, she seems like she could quell some fears ppl have about biden. As opposed to him picking COMMIE YANG or another candidate that would be more appealing to me
Mmm. I think the difference is pretty big, cuz after all it's not about what republicans think, it's about independents, and having 2 of the most centrist dems being pres and VP helps nullify one of Trump's biggest attacks. Also "Cop"mala helps biden be more "law and order"
i used to think this, but also there's a huge chunk of the pop not being considered here -  independents, who biden is currently crushing it with  also keep in mind, Trump's main message is Biden is a far-left wing puppet, putting in a progressive VP would support that
B4 Biden said he was going to choose a woman for his ticket, I was so hoping for Kamala! I can't wait for the vp debate! She is going to make pence sit like the dog he is!! She's going to rock it as our 1st woman veep! I wana be part of the #KHive Plz give her my Love, from Joy!
Absolutely wrong. She is a complete opportunistic, hypocrite simply after leftist power. She tore into Biden and now will go out and praise him. Black America should see that and remember it. It‚Äôs her way.
Mr. President, I am a life-long Republican.  I have never voted for a Democrat for president.  And that will change in November.  I will vote for Biden-Harris because it is the ONLY option that gives our nation a chance to find its way back.  No regrets voting for them!
Biden tells blacks how to vote.
Believe all women.  Then Biden is too.
NEWS: Joe Biden has selected far-left liberal U.S. Senator Kamala Harris to be his running mate in the November election. Harris is known to oppose nearly every policy agenda IFI supports, and her record proves it.
If Biden is hiding his gaffes, Trump is not ashamed to put his own on full display nearly every single day.
2 hours in on Fox and Friends, and they keep rolling the tape of Harris challenging Biden at the 1st debate. That is literally all Trump‚Äôs Buttsniffers have.Biden saw Harris‚Äô toughness and picked her for VP, anyway. How many times has Trump picked a critic for the greater good? 0
I look forward to NOT hearing a peep out of Fox "News" once Biden/Harris win.  I say this because if they start spouting off, they stand a great chance of being held accountable for their "news" putting people in danger.
Yea the green party has the platform that is closest to what id like but they sorta seem to have boned dario hunter. Still not gonna vote biden or trump tho ill figure out my 3rd party pick soon enough
Yep. But what was expected outta biden. Fuck both these tickets
Biden=trump
Why are you agreeing to spread FALSE RUSSIAN propaganda about Biden? You are no longer a patriot of the U.S.  You are now complicit with Trump in working for the Russians, komrad Grassley!
Facts at first I‚Äôm like uhh kamala cause I do not care for Biden at all. But the. I‚Äôm thinking and I‚Äôm like Lauren look at the symbolism in this and what this mean for women, especially black women.
I‚Äôll admit it. I‚Äôm way more excited about Harris than I am Biden. She would have been my primary vote. I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs on the ticket #BidenHarris2020
Between  and Dr. Jill Biden, NO ONE is getting through when they should not!!
The mess that Biden made?
If by "Keep America Great" you mean living in a country needlessly ravaged by a deadly virus that has killed more than 165K people, closed schools and caused economic calamity, I'll take radical left liberal anarchy and government-run healthcare all day long. Biden/Harris 2020!
Biden just lost by a wider margin than before
No Cory, she just wants to get rid of Trump sycophants like you who are party above people. I know you dont care but 160k+ Americans have died with more to come. Kamala and Joe Biden care and will actually DO something about it. I suggest LinkedIn when your time is up.
Oh, for heaven‚Äôs sake. Is that one of Biden/Harris talking pts? TRUMP2020
Do you guys know where I can get a Biden yard sign around here?
Kamala Harris proves that politicians have zero values. Biden was accused of sexual assault and Harris said she believed the women who was assaulted. Then she accepts the VP slot. How can she reconcile this?
Can Dr. Jill Biden be First Lady &amp; Secretary of Education? üßêüßê

Trump or Biden. Period. We cannot afford to be divided now. Let's take our country back, then we can fight amongst ourselves, but if we don't do it now, we won't have country to fight in or the right to be able to. #BidenHarris2020
hoping that biden will be more progressive and effective if he wins and gets majority in congress
Because they don‚Äôt want Biden to. Duh. Obvious. Trumps asked like million times.
One more thing: it‚Äôs significant that Biden picked the woman who wasn‚Äôt afraid to call him out on a debate stage. We need more leaders who elevate people who challenge their thinking. Only weak people surround themselves with sycophants.
Can't wait for the debates!  I hope Biden debates Trump.  It will be good TV since college football is about gone.
obama was probably little more to the left but couldnt get anything done cause congress was more to the right, while is biden wins there will be a more progressive congress
2/2: Don‚Äôt be surprised if any of the ‚ÄòTrump ministers‚Äô says Biden will look for guidance from the Pope rather than the his cabinet.  They tried it with JFK and they not very creative.
I do recall her calling Biden a racist on live TV. smh
Sleepy Joe Biden has done nothing in his 47 years in politics. He picked Kamala Harris as his VP. She is following Sleepy Joe‚Äôs footsteps. Kamala Harris has done nothing in her political career either.
approves of Kamala Harris.  Here is proof that he donated to her campaign not once but twice.  Cannot wait to hear him speak highly and approve of Biden's choice for running mate.  Or else Trump will look more of a fool than he already does. Hmm, let's watch what he does!
Biden/Harris 2020!!!!! That is all.
Can I bet on Biden?
You are absolutely brilliant!  I nominate Kimberley Johnson for the Biden Cabinet!!! üëçüíØ
She's probably the most unlikable candidate possible.  Great news for Trump.  She locked up almost as many black men as Biden.
I‚Äôm a demsoc and a big Bernie supporter, but four more years of Trump will be a much farther setback for the movement than Biden.  You may be able to handle 4 more years of Trump, but others can‚Äôt afford it. He is a threat to our democratic institutions, basic rights, and health.
If you hate that the ticket is Biden/Harris, you should have showed up and voted for, Bernie, Pete, Warren or whomever you supported. Much needs to be fixed, but until there is record voter turnout in the primaries, we won‚Äôt see change. Put your privilege aside and vote in Nov!
I wasn't super thrilled to vote  but I was because Trump is awful.  But seeing that  is Biden's running mate has me excited again.  Can't wait to watch her bring the smackdown on Pence during the VP debate.
IndyStar: Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his VP running mate
I am so excited about the pick of Kamala Harris as Vice Presidential runnning mate to Joe Biden.  This is a historic moment.  Call him courageous Joe!! Game On!
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate
i doubt harris would suddenly become less prominent like kaine if biden lost
Yes and yes, a really good sign.  Particularly happy that Biden choose the better choice, not the one he was most familiar with.
Now that we know it‚Äôs Kamala, I can‚Äôt wait for the debate. She will chew Pence up and spit him out. She destroyed Barr in the AG hearing. I said a year ago when Trump got impeached trying to sabotage Biden‚Äôs campaign, this is the best ticket.
The mainstream media can say all day long that Trump is a racist but we all know who the real one is.  "You are not black if you don't vote for me".  How many insults are Black voters supposed to take from Joe Biden?
Biden/Harris we now have a Presidential Race!
Biden/Harris we now have a Presidential Race!

Yeah, I love how the headline says "Joe Biden has selected..."   How much you wanna bet that's not true? üòÇüòÇ
But when I read these words, nothing he's saying is wrong....  So how exactly is this convince me NOT to vote for Biden?
Hopefully it is going to be
Actually that number represents white men who are CEO's of corporations more than anything. They love their money and they they know Trump will help them keep it. Its does not represent all of us, thank God!! I'll be voting Biden.
Joe Biden selects his running mate with announcement coming as early as Tuesday
I guess it depends on how you look at it. Biden goes to church and has an issue with one of the Catholic beliefs. Trump spends all his time at his golf courses, when he‚Äôs  not being Putin‚Äôs wife or writing love letters to Kim Jung UN. I‚Äôm not the one with a comprehension issue.
I still say Biden won't be the nominee  so this is all a smoke show but, Who decides what is/isnt a mysoginist remark?
I mean Biden‚Äôs the same way then. Idk, I just think it‚Äôs a product of being in front of the camera all day, but maybe I‚Äôm wrong.
The American Dream will soon become the American Nightmare if the Dems get control of our government!
Come on corn pop!  Biden would probably be more comical though yes.
We must put country above party. That's what Kasich is doing. There are so many patriots who are doing the same thing. The Lincoln Project has been incredible. Republicans for Joe BIden too and so many more. The problem with most of the GOP right now is they aren't doing that.
If Biden names a woman VP candiate, as predicted, will your wife have to be on stage during the VP debate?
Truthfully not sure Biden can even pick his nose at this point.
Trump finishes his press conference after shots are fired at the White House. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is still living in his basement because he fears for his safety due to COVID. #TrumpIsTheGOAT
I hear you. But it is possible that trump did unintentionally make the mistake. He is obviously very driven to prove his cognitive abilities and show his superiority to Biden. He might not do this intentionally.
Greg wants us all to hide in our basements until Biden is elected. #Trump2020
I‚Äôm on Biden‚Äôs shortlist of irrelevant Hoosiers. You can trace my car going directly to the Kroger tomorrow.
Against this nightmare of clowns and huge turnover, I‚Äôve been saying for weeks this is a Biden power move. He‚Äôs stacked with talent and people will vote deep because shallow didn‚Äôt work out so well.
Go cry to daddy. Your upset Russia wants tRump and he is losing and China wants Biden. Waaaa
When Biden announces his VP pick, he should just announce the entire Cabinet, and it will be like Avengers Assembling to save the world. It would be a beautiful moment for sure.
As long as Trump keeps talking, Biden has nothing to worry about.  And Trump cannot shut up to save his life.
It would be great to hear the perspective of those that support Trump. I don‚Äôt want to hear why you won‚Äôt vote for Biden but rather why Trump gets your vote.
It‚Äôs not do nothing see Bush Sr, Cheney, Biden, Pence. They are the gateway to Congress. Those 200 judges aren‚Äôt being tee‚Äôd up by Trump. That‚Äôs all Pence.
If it does they aren‚Äôt voting for Biden.
Biden continues today to fight his tendency to stutter.  Republicans (FOX) plays up this as if it‚Äôs dementia instead of the speech impediment he has fought his entire life.
He can‚Äôt vote for Biden and claim to be a conservative
So that means  approves of Joe Biden then, cool.  I guess he's backing Biden because he is pissed that his Dad loves Kanye more than him!!
President Joe Biden
You know I've over-indexed on politics recently when I read #RIPKamala and my first thought was Joe Biden picked someone other than Kamala Harris as Veep rather than thinking about the Ugandan Giant!
Ummmm I don‚Äôt believe that Biden can get a bike to 30mph but nice try.
So what lies were made up there froggy? Biden is a lifelong politician who has done absolutely nothing. What makes you think he suddenly has the answers? You vote for Biden and within one year you‚Äôre stuck with who he picked because of race and gender. That‚Äôs f‚Äôn scary
Biden doesn't even remember Ferguson. Someone is writing his texts. Buying a gun this week. Haven't had one in 20 years but it's time to put my family first.
They're thinking people will vote for Biden purely because he was Obama's VP. And they are correct, to a certain extent.
You‚Äôre kidding right? It has been plainly proven that Obama and Biden knew of meddling in the 2016 election and chose to do nothing because they thought Hillary would win in a landslide. So don‚Äôt tell us a Joe Biden would do something. We know better
Lol. Your leader Obumma/Biden knew it in 2016 but felt that there was no way that Hillary would get beat so just let it go. Now you a holes want to try and spin it and pin it on Republicans? You guys are laughable
Anything and everything. I trust Ice more than joe Biden
The division was started with Obumma and Biden a decade ago. The media are all in on it. If not, then explain why the media shows pictures of black children who have been killed by police when the people are actually menacing adults. I.e Mike Brown
Mueller said POTUS Capone is exempt from our laws while he‚Äôs POTUS.The next day,Trump committed extortion in broad daylight by trying to get Ukraine Prez,to announce an investigation on Biden.Mueller essentially said if he weren‚Äôt POTUS, he‚Äôd be indicted. Lies are facts to Trump
Wait... BIDEN is spreading false information?  JFC.  A vaccine in time for Election Day?  Wonder how many people the president chose to let die so he could hang on to this bombshell.
Pastor, I'm curious to hear your examples as to how he has "powerfully ran this country". No response to Covid as of yet, he has released felons twice on Fridays, he just publicly judged Mr. Biden as a non-Christian and you and I know that judging is God's not ours. Examples pls?
Biden not announcing his VP yet is absolutely messing with the Republicans heads. They will have little time to get their hate ads put together, nor will they have time to prepare Trump for any debate.  Utter genius on Biden's part.
It‚Äôs only going to get worse.   Republicans are selling America‚Äôs soul.
Let‚Äôs have a face-off!  All trump and Biden have to do is pronounce these words: Anonymous. Yosemite. Swift. Origin.  Winner gets to be Pres, ok?
So people are concerned about the fact that Joe Biden is senile, right?
This is his first term and he has done more for America than any other president in our generation. Check the federal registry! He is making America great! Either your living under a rock or Joe Biden‚Äôs ass is pressed against your lipsüôÑ.
I will wear a bike helmet if I am riding fast, say beyond 10 mph. Or in a busy city like Chicago streets. But if it‚Äôs a casual, slow ride and in rural areas, no. Biden‚Äôs ride looks like the slower rural variety.
Joe Biden has one of the most amazing basements I've ever seen... and mine is pretty damn great.
Biden's first press conference should be like an episode of Oprah. Televised live and he should publicly fire all of Trumps Cronies.  "AG Barr, your fired, Postmaster, your fired too, Birx, your fired!" America would rejoice in that cleansing moment - and they all deserve it.
Mail in ballots should now be hand delivered to your county clerk. That is truly the only way you are ensured your vote will be counted. I cant wait until Biden wins and we can go back to having systems that work for Americans instead of for Trump only.

All Biden has to do for the REST of his presidency is play any of the millions of videos or sound bites of Trump and say, "Need I say any more to explain why we are here?"
That's called the Affordable Care Act that Obama created and Trump has spent 3 1/2 years trying to burn down. Now he wants to act like it was his idea. He just endorsed an Obama bill AT HIS OWN RALLY! Nobody helps Joe Biden more than Donald Trump. See ya on 11/03/2020!!
Catholics don‚Äôt support abortion.  Biden does.  Case closed.
Listen to the clip. He did say it.  This post is the lie. Biden has already walked it back. Ah, the beauty of the democrat party, they don't mean what they say,  but they are able to imagine what republicans really mean when they make a simple comment.
So Biden isn‚Äôt allowed to disagree with the issue of abortion and a woman‚Äôs right to choose, which IS LEGAL, but the ‚ÄúWalking Sin Machine‚Äù in the WH gets a pass?
Who said I supported Biden? Fuck him too.
E-Mac I think that it's sad what has become of Joe Biden. Someone should step in and end this and let him retire in peace. I'm a Trump supporter and think he will beat Biden but he should not be running.
Yes.  Trump has huge scandals and isn‚Äôt taking COVID seriously.  At least I‚Äôm certain Biden would do a better job at risk mitigation of COVID, with better national strategy.  COVID is my biggest issue now.
China gained ground with Clinton and the Obumma regime. They are now up against strong tariffs and they are not happy. Of course they want Biden to win because they know the truth about Hunter

No one knows for sure how this is going to effect the voting.  Republicans think it will siphon minority and/or young votes from Biden.  There are just as likely discouraged R voters who don't like Trump, but won't vote for a Dem.
Thighland.  Brilliant.  Hope you don‚Äôt criticize Biden anytime soon‚Äîyou‚Äôve shit the bed on live tv more in the last 2 weeks than your depends can possibly hold.
The "you can't be Catholic and support Biden" has already started, much sooner than in the 2016 election cycle.  I cannot imagine the homilies we will have to endure in the weeks leading up to November.  It will be an exhausting 88 more days.
How‚Äôs your elite friends doing? We all know you and Biden got a dinner date to discuss the next plan and scheme. Just tell the people your all a hoax, people are catching on it‚Äôs all a shit show and reality tv condensation. Give us our government back it‚Äôs obvious both sides
Tonight!  Join Dr. Myers and Indiana for Joe Biden as we talk healthcare.
Idk why joe Biden‚Äôs managers let him even speak at this point LMAO. I hope to have the overflowing confidence of old white men one day
I wish you were the Democratic nominee. I cannot in good conscious vote for Trump or Biden. This may be the first year I won‚Äôt vote. I don‚Äôt feel I have a good choice from either party.
Yes Dan, unlike your Satan Worshipping Messiah, Biden is still very much Moderate. The problem with the GOP is, you‚Äôve traded in your allegiance to Lincoln, in exchange for an Ouija Board for your Faith. Look at Falwell as an example. Good pic with his pants unzipped, wasn‚Äôt it?
Don't worry you've sicked Kanye on them. Joe will certainly never get a single black vote now right????  After all, you've done more for black people than anyone, right? and Joe Biden isn't Catholic, right? And Covid has disappeared, right? And the new health care plan is out?
"After yesterday's edited version of his statement, Sleepy Joe Biden is no longer worthy of the Black Vote"
Ye getting weaponized as a GOP pawn to ticket split Biden is I guess where we‚Äôre at in 2020.
Joe Biden is really out here trying to compete with George Washington for lowest total black vote
Every time Repubes post about ‚Äúthat Biden video was *hard to watch*‚Äù I wonder to myself if they think it‚Äôs hard to watch the President ignore Russian bounties, or rail on about water pressure, or say Biden will ‚Äúhurt the Bible, hurt God‚Äù? You think this shit is *easy to watch*?
Yeah... lowering the age for Medicare to 60 and strengthening private insurance via ACA is totally halfway to single payer M4A...   Giving the police $300 million is totally halfway to defunding them...  What about Biden's policies makes you think he's met us "halfway?"
This was a just sad.
Joe Biden is a puppet. Let the man grieve over the loss of his family. He has yet to do that! He does not have the mental capacity to run a country. Let‚Äôs keep the current president he‚Äôs doing a fine job!

So the guy who cheated on 3 wives, hundreds of times, holds a Bible upside down because he‚Äôs never opened one, and commits extortion and Launders Money more often than normal people drink water, is telling us that Biden is Godless? Enjoy Hell Donnie.
Sorry but any vote not used or not used for Joe Biden is a Trump vote. So you have to ask yourself, is any one VP pick WORSE than 150k+ dead Americans?  I'd be interested in your response.
This man just claimed Joe Biden isn't a Christian. How long do you think God will stand for that without having something to say in it?

Its time MAGA's. Your President just called Joe Biden "a hurter of the Bible and a man who hates God". You claim to be Christians. What do you do next?  I know what the Bible says you must do.  Do you?  I hope so!!! Your eternity depends on it!!!  Choose wisely.
Keep on judging people like you are, calling Joe Biden godless, and God will want to speak with you really quickly. I know you are unfamiliar with the Bible, but judging is God's to do, not yours. God will not be mocked.  Keep it up at your eternitys risk. Money is useless to God
He keeps playing around like this and God will talk with him immediately.  He will not like the outcome, guaranteed. Jesus makes it clear we are not to judge others. Here is the President calling Joe Biden "against God" Every true Christian RIGHT NOW must walk away from Trump.
As an atheist, the small, petty god Donald Trump appears to worship makes no fucking sense. Omnipotent, but apparently able to be outsmarted by Joe Biden.
Biden seems to make a racist comment every other day ...Sooo when he implemented a travel ban on China whitch resulted in Biden calling him racist, that wasn‚Äôt cautious
But he does say vote Biden:

Biden and Harris are the same-old shit with different identity, progressive rhetoric, no soul, and no humanity.  Will I vote in 2020? Probably. But if you deny this as a valid way of thinking, just because 45 is terrible, you have no clue what the working class is experiencing.
Why am I expected to vote for someone whose platform is on record as being "nothing will fundamentally change"?  I want fundamental change.  I want humane treatment.  I demand something different from what I've known my entire life.  Biden and Harris offer NONE of that.
I am not looking to be edgy, confrontational, or provocative.   My list of reasons to vote for a Biden-Harris ticket are dwindling.  What has democracy and capitalism done for me and other working-class people, that defends their lack of clear, pro-worker initiatives?
That one asks this question shows the success of a dubious canard against tactical voting that's been promulgated &amp; fed by the problematic myth of American individualism.   Trump's an existential threat to our republic. Right now, Biden's our best hope. That's all one need know.
Anyone who says Biden and Trump are the same are pretty much beyond hope, blinded by ignorance, agenda, or both.
I was disappointed that you were not picked as the VP. However I do respect the choice that was picked. I hope and pray you are asked to be part of the Biden administration hopefully when Biden is elected. I‚Äôm thinking the National Security Advisor, or the US

Excuse me! Biden used the Pandemic Response Team‚Äôs Plan! No bleach involved!
‚ÄúEvery single American should be wearing a mask when they‚Äôre outside for the next three months at a minimum ‚Äî every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing," Biden declared.

Make no mistake, Joe Biden is far far far far worse, even far worse than Hillary.
After President Biden and Vice President Harris debut today, do you still think he should come out of the basement? And you talk about reading from a teleprompter
Trump seems like he was high on hydroxychloroquine today! OH yeah! He had just seen President Biden and Vice President Harris debut!
Joe Biden is going to need EXTRA security after Jeanine Pirro making threats that he won't make it to the election! It's people like KKK and White supremacists who will put a Bounty hit out on him just as Putin did to our TROOPS! Trump gave him a pass, and Fox is OK with that!
The river lights from Joe Biden's attack ad
Fox TRAITORS always want to bash Biden for using a teleprompter. Well who needs a teleprompter when you are this good?
Which polls, and at what times during the election?  Because in the election I remember watching, Biden was so unpopular that he had to skip an entire primary, won in SC, and then had everyone save Sanders and Warren drop to support him immediately before Super Tuesday.
I bet you rather Joe stay in the basement after that performance today! I bet you and Fox want Kamala to go in her basement now too! Yall keep bashing Biden about a teleprompter, I can't tell, he's so professional. Trump can't even hide the fact he's reading from a teleprompter!
Guys...i think that's his daughter. And she's a Biden supporter too...ü§£ü§£ ...And supported Hilary..Love this gal....!
Gretchen Whitmer supposedly withdrew herself from VP consideration and told Biden to select a woman of color.
Quit FALSE FLAGGING, you are going to vote for Joe Biden too! Or you ain't BLACK!
Quit with these edited videos of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris!  You cut the tape where she said "there's no way I think that you are racist. You're trying to fool and mislead the poor &amp; middle class about tax heights our next President is imposing on you filthy rich people!
Sean do ya'll really want Joe Biden  to come out of the basement the way he's already kicking Trump's ass, with only having a 29% chance of re-election with him in the basement. Trump wouldn't have a chance at all if he come out on his ass like he did today! ....
Wasn't Biden on the ticket with Obama? Hmmmmmm.....
Can‚Äôt wait for the presidential debates going to play a drinking game called ‚Äú take a drink everytime Joe Biden says something that doesn‚Äôt make sense or starts talking and the conversation starts getting insulting ‚Äú
"Pete Buttigieg will deliver his speech live from South Bend, Ind., from a city landmark ahead of Biden's acceptance speech on Thursday night." via /r/Pete_Buttigieg  #PeteForAmerica #Pete2020
He endorsed Biden because the party told him to. If you think any different, I have a bridge to sell you in the Sahara. He did this even though the party and all of its organs deliberately undermined him treated him like a nobody. Weak.
Change the channel and ignore him. Let's go Biden/Harris!

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Pretty weird to think that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are speaking to an empty room right now #2020Election
#NEW: Sen. Kamala Harris takes the stage after Biden's introduction.  "Thank you, Joe. As I said when you called me, I am incredibly honored by this responsibility. And I'm ready to get to work."
#NEW: Biden says, "One of the reasons I chose Kamala, is because we both believe that we can define America simply in one word: possibilities... that's America."
I was always going to vote for  Biden but now I am energized to do more...everything I can to help GOTV for this ticket.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are speaking together for the first time as running mates from Delaware. Watch live on air or on Facebook:
Well, at least he know why we are voting for Biden!
I understand not being thrilled with Biden and/or Harris but if you mostly align with the dem platform, a libertarian is really going to disappoint you.
We‚Äôre minutes away from Biden/Harris first rally. #BidenHarris2020
We‚Äôre minutes away from Biden/Harris first rally
That confrontation may have clinched her the VP way back then. Biden imagined what it'd be like to have her on his side.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs good on her feet and I think one of the reasons Joe Biden picked her is he had to debate her, and he knew it wasn‚Äôt easy,‚Äù Kildee said.
She's a woman of different nationalities! Which means she will pull votes in front every nationality, Black, White, Hispanic, Asian and many more!  Smart pick Biden!
üò≥ would you rather Biden tho honestly lol because both suck but Biden is like....yikes lol can we just get through four more years of red hats lol and probably have two more terrible choices next election haha
VP Pence congratulated Harris' nomination and was quick to criticize her position on several issues. "I mean, we all know, look, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left."
The fact that alternatives to Trump or Biden do exist isn't arcane knowledge, it's stuff anyone could just remember from watching the election or find out for the first time via 30-second Google Search.
We do. Plenty of progressive policies that get ignored, multiple progressive candidates in the primaries (Biden wasn't in the discussion until the entire field mysteriously dropped under him), or they're third parties "who'll never win" because They're Not Supposed To.
Joe Biden is a fraud that doesn't give a shit about any of us. Also Russia told me to say this. Clowns.
She didn't get traction because much of the Democratic Party sees her as a cop. Which she was. It's not that she was too far left - it's that she wasn't far left enough, and others were better at campaigning to the center (Biden, Buttigieg)
This comment sounds as though it was intended to protect Biden.
"progressive radical" ü§£ Sorry. Progressive radicals know Harris isn't one.  Republicans paint every Democrat as a "progressive radical" - it's the standard playbook. It's never been true.  I could not be more disappointed in Biden/Harris. Too tame. Still voting for them though.
I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs all whit3 men who are refusing to vote for Biden/Harris...
I doubt that Biden picked her. I think she was picked for him by the DNC. I believe that he is incapable of making such a decision.
Biden was asked to commit to choosing a woman VP on live TV and said yes, then he was asked to commit to choosing a black woman and said no. Take that how you will. I'm voting BIDEN-HARRIS-2020
Where do I get my Biden Harris yard sign?????
People do call Biden and Pence Mr. Vice President

I think he planned a storytelling first campaign for a reason. I grew up in his town. Hes wildly intelligent and doesnt do things on accident. I have a feeling he knew damn well what he was doing and will be planning on something big soon. An advisory role w/Biden maybe to start.
Takes are all over the place. But the choice it‚Äôs pretty simple Biden or trump. If you want trump to remain in office, say that. Otherwise, please STFU until November 4th! #BidenHarris2020
Biden IS a Catholic period! Harris is a Babtist: Period!
I wish! They will thank her for her fundraising! If Biden loses, she will be as Hillary! As an African American woman , this saddens me!
This is what Gov. Whitmer had to say about Kamala Harris being named Joe Biden's running mate. READ MORE:
HAPPENING TODAY:  Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris will speak today...together.
this is what I'm talking about, biden won't save us from this situation.
Because Trump is hurting himself more than anything Biden might say could hurt Trump. That's a reason to stand back and let Trump disgust voters. But it doesn't follow that refusing to debate is either smart politics or good for our increasingly insufferable political discourse.
For all of those that don‚Äôt agree about Biden/Harris, we all have opinions and freedom of speech. Agree or disagree with my Tweets is fine with me. Bottom line Vote! Be blessed ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠

Judging from the fact that this is the line of attack they're going with, Biden seems to have made a politically shrewd selection, at least.

Current mood of Kamala Harris and everyone that hoped that Joe Biden would pick Kamala as V. P. I know one person who got a Big smile on their face right now. And that person is John Lewis! O. K. John now help guide us to the promise land, the WH. It's now or never!Biden/Harris
I wouldn't be running in this race because I just declared myself Joe Biden's VP.
I've been saying I'd vote for a hot bag of vomit if it meant trump would leave, Biden and Harris are a way better choice!
They'll just deny it when questioned about it.  Apparently Biden is worried he'll lose California?  ü§£
I would probably be MORE willing to vote for Biden and Harris if they did drugs, hung out with gangsters, and were sexually liberated. We love that real-world experience
Joe Biden should schedule a presser every day at the same time as Donny DollHands.
Biden/Harris Ticket are you happy with his choice? We are absolutely happy with this choice. We can no longer have the current President for 4 more years. So please! Let's alley out to vote on Nov 3 2020. We need 3 things on Nov 3rd. 1. Biden/Kamala Victory 2. Defeat Trump 3.God
President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was ‚Äúa little surprised‚Äù that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, had selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.

My vote for Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt in question. I just feel so let down by this whole damn election and I wish it had been warrenüò≠ but I‚Äôll be voting biden.
The 46th President and VP of the United States: Joseph R. Biden and Kamala D. Harris
You do realize that you and Biden are  a part of the same crony and crooked establishment that has inacted policies and legislation that does nothing but further complicate and increase the difficulty of the lives of Americans. Especially those that you claim to be helping.
Real newspapers say Obama‚Äôs and Biden warned Trump about Flynn!
Nope! Biden already said he wouldn‚Äôt block prosecutions of Trump or admin!
Biden chose an ex prosecutor who laughed at sending single black moms to jail because their kids were LATE to school, sent countless Black people to jail knowing California‚Äôs history, and said she wouldn‚Äôt do anything specifically for black people if she became president ü•¥
Biden said he‚Äôd pick a woman. Press &amp; JB considers a bunch of talented women w impressive careers &amp; skills.   Increasingly likely he‚Äôd pick a WOC. Press &amp; JB considers a bunch of talented women w impressive careers &amp; skills.  IT WAS NEVER THAT HARD TO PICK A WOMAN.
You cretin need to know Biden is even more conservative than Boris Johnson.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden insists he can unify a fractured nation, and he‚Äôll test his theory with an unusual nominating convention intended to span the spectrum of U.S. politics.
Biden and Harris!
But seriously, no Biden/Harris buttons yet? #BidenHarris
Kamala Harris lmao, so they do have somewhat of a plan. Biden isn‚Äôt going to make it through a full term so all these Dems will vote for Biden to somehow win then push him out the door when he succumbs to his dementia and Harris becomes the first female president.
So who else is excited about Joe Biden's V. P.  Pick? We are Super excited and can't wait to watch Trump/Pence get the living shit kicked out them in November! We all need to vote now more than ever.  #BidenHarris2020

Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
She didn‚Äôt attack Biden.  That‚Äôs called accountability, something you do not understand at all
kamala is jamaican and indian.  Where does this help Biden
There is no reason to moan about the VP pick.  There were so many excellent possible running mates...I actually had three choices I liked about equally.  And the others Biden didn't pick could be useful in his administration.
Yeah I don't have an answer. I'm not excited, but I'm not about Biden either.  I'm for damn sure voting for them though.
So in case you all are wondering about Kamala Harris 's ethnicity.  As much as she wants to be African-American she is Indian - Jamaican. Poor Joe Biden as confused as he is mayb he thought he was picking an African-American. #mysouthbend
#NEW: Biden's photographer just shared this photo
You forgot Joe biden has accusers too. At some point you need to know dem and gop are one party with two ends. It's a big club and you ain't in it.

I‚Äôll vote for Biden and a wet burlap sack with a dead rat in it.
Biden tells Rep. Karen Bass she is not pick for VP
Plans to unveil Biden's running mate choice are in place for whenever he is ready to announce. His campaign has encouraged supporters to sign up for text message alerts that they claim will be the first way people learn of the decision.
So we are at the point where Biden came out of the house and started passing out donuts to the press all smiles. Am I the only one who remembered Biden telling he was the VP pick but not telling us in 08?
#BREAKING: Joe Biden has chosen his vice president.   Now we wait, though the announcement could come as soon as today
That‚Äôs the guy Trump and Xi had locked up! He is a fighter for the liberation of Hong Kong! Now, I know I will vote for Biden!
Nope! If Biden wins, you are going to an American jail!
People are freaking out because Biden hasn't names his VP pick yet. Convention starts 8/17. Obama named Biden as his VP pick on 8/23/08....2 days before the Democratic Convention.  Chill out all you worryworts!
It's not that I necessarily trust Biden. He's just going to do what he's going to do.
Do you trust Joe Biden to get the coronavirus pandemic under control in the U.S.?
Nervously excited awaiting Biden‚Äôs VP Pick. She will change America For Good.
This morning Joe Biden tweeted that if he's elected president he wouldn't waste any time getting the coronavirus under control. What are your thoughts?
Men, do you agree? Are you insulted by this? Today President Trump said that some men are "insulted" by Joe Biden's decision to promise to select a woman as his running mate.
It‚Äôs cuz Biden is old, and he is essentially crowning the 2024 Dem presidential nominee with this pick
Explain why you think this is a 'prime' slot.  I don't see it as that great, except it is on night Biden accepts nomination.
Can Biden just hurry up and announce his VP already? He clearly knows who it is, or else he wouldn't be doing a big song and dance about the reveal.  I get the idea is to buy time until the DNC can find another conservative to run, but it feels more like wasting than buying time.
Why do feel like Biden's announcement is going to be all  flashy and like "I'm taking my talents to South Beach."
In contrast, Biden was already in his bunker.
South Bend's former mayor Pete Buttigieg is one of the featured speakers on the DNC's biggest night. He'll be speaking Thursday night, just before Joe Biden accepts the Presidential nomination. Kamala Harris is also slated to be one of the last speakers before Biden. VP hint?
I would say Joe Biden should pick Candace Owens unfortunately she's a couple years too young

Problem with our younger politicians is the ones who weren‚Äôt creepy were drummed out. It was at 1 point, a 3 way race between Biden, Sanders, and Warren. As we‚Äôve learned, Warren only stayed in so long to hurt Sanders, much like half the field dropping at once to hurt Sanders
Super kind to call  part of the Biden family.
Seriously he‚Äôs really turned the last couple of weeks. You‚Äôre gonna see a lot of this though, as Biden closes it out and people figure out they have nowhere to go.
You getting more senile or just plain oh lying as usual! It wasn't the great pandemic of 1917, it was 1918. Also it was the pandemic of WWl where people lost their lives and it wasn't 100, 000,000 people! WWII ended in1945! If Biden lied like that Hannity say he's senile!
I guess you had to have been there. After the huge SC victory, Super Tuesday loomed, which is a very costly battle. And all the money started going Biden's way once black voters spoke. That's pretty much all the insight required.
He already declared that he's the winner of the VP ticket and will go to white house victorious without Biden.
For all the secrecy and speculation that typically surrounds the search for a vice presidential candidate, the decision rarely sways an election. But ahead of Joe Biden‚Äôs imminent announcement, this year could be different.
I'm voting for Biden no matter who he chooses as VP. All of the women are fantastic choices.
I would say it‚Äôs at least a 70% chance that Biden finds a spot in his administration for Pete. I like to think they‚Äôll have a treasure chest of cheap toys like a dentist office he gets to pick from after every meeting. No sticky hands though. They leave marks on the walls.
Let‚Äôs not pay attention to the polls! Bernie Bros are trying to sabotage the election! Biden might be two- four points ahead! We are a long way from a landslide!

Something amazing about the Wilkerson is how it rhymes American 'wokeness' with Ambedkarite Buddhist liberalism. For Ambedkar IIRC we could have a nice meritocracy if only we destroyed Hinduism, root and branch. Makes you think about "Biden wants to hurt God" in a new light.
Oh, Mr. Biden: can we trouble you with a tiny Constitutional matter?
Starting... aren‚Äôt most of you clowns never-trumpers anyway? Flimsy as the wind. Why are you campaigning for Biden? Just shut the hell up. Nobody is listening to you.
I think Trump has handed Biden a hammer that he'll be able to use on him the rest of the way, despite Kudlow's attempts to backpedal. Dems have used threats to SS very effectively in the past.
Maybe their the only ones who believe China is dangerous and that Biden doesn‚Äôt care and is willing to take their money and throw Americans under the bus. Or maybe they believe trump is a straight shooter and not a snake like the rest of Washington.
As if this will go into affect! No Blue State will do this! Congress will shut it down! If the Senate goes Blue, they will override his vetos, If Biden wins the Heroes Act gets signed! The economy is saved!
Biden as VP was acceptable to me. In that case no harm no foul. However over the last few months his tweets have been irrelevant, incendiary, misleading, and pure B.S at times. His gaffs; almost un forgivable. Dont vote for this person.
Lol you must also think Biden is a smart man
Former Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday called President Trump's executive order to cut payroll taxes "a reckless war on Social Security."
Umm have you heard Biden speak?
I was actually a democrat until Benghazi and watching HCR run for President killed me. Donald loves America and he is portrayed horribly, i mean you have to see the bias can you imagine trump saying some stuff Biden says? He is seriously the definition of a racist
Absolutely. Or Biden should wait til Traitor complys with the law &amp; produces his tax returns, like every other candidate. #trumptaxreturns
When Joe Biden was V.P. he oversaw the economic recovery that was needed because once again the GOP administration that preceded his CRASHED THE FUCKING ECONOMY INTO A FLAMING DITCH THE SIZE OF THE GRAND FUCKING CANYON.
He doesn‚Äôt even know where he is... Biden is an idiot.
The reports have Trump running off stage! How in the world is he going to last two hours on stage debating Joe Biden? He can't do it!
What the hell are you talking about! So this was your executive Order news conference on helping people who lost their job due to TRUMPVIRUS! Butall your doing is talking about and calling Speaker Pelosi, Senator Schumer, and our next President Joe Biden out of their names!
Oh yeah like your doing any better. Under your Presidency we currently have 161,906 deaths. And 4,971,190 Total Cases. Your talking about Joe Biden killing our stocks, 401K, etc. At least he isn't killing American people. Joe actually cares what happens to Americans. Unlike you!
China doesn't want President Trump to be re-elected but the Kremlin does, says U.S. intelligence officials. U.S. officials say Russia is using a variety of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
I don't own any stocks nor do I have a 401k for him to kill and you're already doing a fantastic job killing Obama's economy! Now you want us to make America great again after you destroyed it! But we will MAGA once we vote Joe Biden to be the 46th president of the United States!
I heard the comment Biden made before you and alot of other Fox host  tried to make it a racist comment! But I was not offended, at all! So you guys can move on to the next scheme, something might stick, although I doubt it!
Mary Trump, Donald Trump's niece, said she heard him call black people N*ggers! Trump is being sued for housing discrimination against blacks and Latinos! As a black woman, I don't care how you twist Joe Biden's words, he still got my vote! Besides he clarified what he meant!
So who do you hope Joe Biden picks for his V. P.? We are hoping for Kamala Harris how about all of you?

Those little black girls need to stay away from Joe Biden.  They are vulnerable children.  Joe will be sniffing and fondling because apparently   Kamala no longer cares about that. Or Racism  As she holds hands with the man she outed a few months ago!ü§î üòÆüò≥üòÆüò≥üòÆüò≥üòÆüò≥
Proves that nearly all Media is controlled by the Democrats. Also, it shows that Dems know Biden is way behind Trump, fake polls will prevail until 2020, when fakery is replace with reality. Groundhog day 2016 and 2020!
And... ADAM RANK like this !! LMAO... I love Rank as what he does..... He needs to stay in his lane.... Biden is cancer... and Kamala is a joke !!
Sickeningüò±  And they think Trump supporters are brainwashed.  Good grief.  How does the woman who called Biden a pervert and a racist now hold hands with him  Liberals are such phoney hypocrites.  #Trump2020
I seem to remember a "Dog faced pony soldier" comment by Biden, but of course he's excused. Wonder why?
Biden will step aside before November even gets here! Trump 2020!
Which can only mean Democrats plan to flood states with fake mail in ballots and ballot harvesting. Americans are not stupid, there is no way they will elect Harris/Biden to the White House and destroy America.
Waiting for Biden's Ritalin &amp; dementia meds to kick in?
redirects to Biden's website. Democrats are being in-your-face about their desire to turn America into a communist country.
it‚Äôs really either biden or trump lmao i cannot help but laught at this point   HA
Voting for Biden or Trump is basically saying you support police brutality.
Conservatives suck (&amp; you know darn well Biden/Harris aren't far left)
You .Ean Joe Biden's history with racism and sexism?
CNN isn't even trying to pretend Biden will serve as POTUS. Harris "if and when" Biden steps aside.
The text Biden was quoting is used by Islamists to promote Sharia Law. "It's one of the great confessional faiths" referring to Islam.
Oops, I meant to write Mr. Gaetz needs to flip over to Biden/Harris team.
Excellent retort, Mr. Gary‚Äôs needs to get on the right team, Biden/Harris.
So you‚Äôre admitting that you know Biden isn‚Äôt fit to be President
Kamala is the most liberal, progressive voter in the senate. She is against 2A AND will take our guns! She‚Äôs an opportunist. Now loves Biden. No mistake. A vote for Biden is a vote for Harris as president! #Trump2020
Thank you  and    Trump Attempted To Upstage Biden And Harris But CNN And MSNBC Ignored Him  via
They're going to use her as a demographic human shield to protect neoliberalism.  If you criticize Biden/Harris, you will labeled a racist and a misogynist--unironically.  "How dare you criticize this accomplished woman of color?!"  Kamala Harris is Neoliberal Voltron.
83 days until we elect President Joe Biden and Madam Vice President Kamala Harris üó≥
Biden isnt out ...he is going to be the next POTUS.
Biden &amp; Blow 2020
Exactly something a Biden supporter would say. You know he‚Äôs not coherent enough to be in a debate much less be competent
I would think a South Park writer would not only be able to see through Biden/Harris for what they are, but would be funny too. Guess that's why I've not watched in years.
She‚Äôs not running for president. Biden is. He needs to stand on his own. Or will,u vote for a president whose VP needs to speak for him and protect him? And Trump will decimates Harris.
Oops-  Those are Biden's gigs...  Just saying.
If elected, Biden will step down so Harris can be President. Scary.
Biden-Harris campaign raises 6 million dollars in 2 hours after the announcement.
I agree. But Biden and Harris are both flaming liberals compared to the administration thats in there now. Think about your choice in real terms not in terms of how you would like it to be.
These are sick sick Democrats who will be voting Biden/Harris. Subhuman.
April 16, 2019 Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said Tuesday that she believes women who say they felt uncomfortable after receiving unwanted touching from former Vice President Joe Biden.  Wonder how she will reconcile her comments...
I would vote for Biden if he had picked Rin Tin Tin as his running mate. Trump has to go.
It is time for the American people to get a break, Biden/Harris will give us a fighting chance and see the country through the greatest of crisis.
This news is so huge. Kamala Harris will deliver for the American people. This team, Biden/Harris will win.
Biden can't even remember who or where he is most of the time let alone relentlessly prepared. Are you on drugs man?
I'm so thrilled. Joe Biden made the right choice. Kamala Harris is tough, extremely on the right page with every important news crisis going on now. Biden/Harris, they are truly The Peoples Team!
I was voting Democrat, anyway, but this is even better. üëçüá∫üá≤  Kamala Harris Named as Joe Biden‚Äôs VP Pick - WSJ

Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
It's all good now that she can be President. All is forgiven. She knows Biden will never be able to be POTUS and she would be the real one. Dems want the first woman President appointed, not elected.
Biden will manipulated by the Liberals!  Rep. Jayapal clearly admits it!  The sorry truth is that Sleepy Joe is spineless, when he's coherent, which rarely happens in any 24-hour period!
The Establishment really, really likes Buttigeig. And old people like Biden do too. They honestly believe that young people will gravitate towards him, despite all evidence of the contrary.  Mayo Pete is what they wish the elite's failsons and faildaughters ended up being.
Biden the liar since the 70's his a liar, and much worst things, a no unscrupulous politician,
Biden IS a liar, a show for work do nothing, kissing way too many children, #SavetheChildren
Democrats don't care is the VP nom is qualified, all they care about is turning out the black vote for Biden.
They won't air Biden or that drunken Nancy Pigosi when she slurs her words, they could go all day with them two.. And doesn't Geraldo have a vault to open..
Biden thinks Arizona is a city, so I doubt he knows when World War 2 was.. But thanks for playing, I could do this all day..üòÜ
Outrageous!  What has Joe Biden for Black People ... If anything, he has kept them down!
no will let you have the chance, how about addressing pedophiles, 47 yrs in washington and you never heard a thing biden?, #savethechildren
ü§£üòÇüòÅüòÇü§£ that's some funny shit right there, millions voting for Biden... ü§£üòÇüòÅüòÇü§£ I have literally seen one location with Biden signs ..
Is that why Biden was riding a bike?
Biden officially endorses a criminal that assaulted a uniformed police officer and tried to take his service weapon to use against him. Biden is pro criminal
Umm, Biden and Trump supporters?
I would have voted for Biden if he had picked a progressive VP, had a couple of progressive voices in his cabinet, and/or moved on cannabis prohibition at the federal level. Small asks. But they look like they're going full mythical moderate Republican so he doesn't get my vote.
Are you sorry for what the woman that was raped by Biden went through?  You‚Äôre ridiculous.
They are. 13 of my neighbors (all seniors) have told me you were right in 2016. I regret my vote. He doesn‚Äôt care about us. Come November this Senior is Voting Biden.
It‚Äôs not. I am out walking my dogs here in Florida right now and all I hear from the Seniors is why did The President just turn his back on us when we elected Him. Biden has a new voter I need my Social Security and Medicare to live.
Trump you are so full of god dam shit Biden won‚Äôt raise taxes on the poor people just look at what your trying to do with doing away with social security taxes and if that happens you better look around every corner you come to because their just might be a little old lady cus u.
Because Joe Biden is not a child only children who are just learning how to ride a bike should wear a helmet ‚õë
Our American under President Biden, who will suddenly disappear for VP to take place and suddenly disappear dead, so the one who would never be elected Servant of CHINA Pelusa would reign, They want to see America destroyed.
So you're saying Biden/Rice are the Mondale/Ferraro of 2020?
Honestly, I am undecided between Biden and Jorgensen. Traditionally vote Libertarian, but....you know.  Please, please #LetHerSpeak
I just told my ex girl I wanna move all my operations to thigh land too
Joe Biden couldn't believe he was capable of completeing a full sentence let alone comprehend what he thinks he knows, so sad.
Yeah ... China is helping Biden!  No Dem is going to listen a Rep (robot tweet), and no Rep is going to listen to a Dem (robot tweet). So, if you don't check the facts, you're the fool for believing a foreign robot tweet!
Bad is your History of over 47+ yrs in Washington, what do you have to show, zero. I remember Joe Biden in the Anita Hill hearings, OMG, the plagiarizing of a speech, etc., dude who you kidding, I ask the divine intervention of the machine breaking down in fron of your people
Something is wrong when white folks refuse to embrace diversity. I thank God for Black Lives Matter, they will help to elect Joe Biden.
Biden will enable us to become a full blown plutocracy. Trump is trying the same thing, but Trump is also causing civil unrest, which I believe is what will save our future. A Biden victory will usher in complacency and leftism will lose all it's momentum.
Reason I won't vote for him. This isn't about purity tests, I genuinely believe Biden will do permanent irreversible damage to leftism in this country. If he wins a dystopian future is almost a guarantee.
No it's not because I organize and put in work at a local level and actively participate in every election I can. The general election doesn't weigh my conscience as a leftist. Based on what he's promised, Biden will do the most long term damage to minority groups, that's the #1
trump - ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èYOU ‚Äî that‚Äôs ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èYOU are  the biggest political crime and scandal in American history!!  We can‚Äôt wait until ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èyou LOOSE the election to Joe Biden!!!!       (From Florida)
Right now it's Short Term Damage (Trump) vs Long Term Damage (Biden) vs not playing into a system that was never designed to give you a voice in the first place. I know my choice.
Option 3, Trump wins and in 4 years the Dems can give us a worthy candidate rather than waste another 8 years begging for scraps. I'll be writing in. Best case scenario with Biden still permanently fucks us in the long term.
I don't think Biden is going to make anything better, he's gonna trap us in for another 8 years of no change. Trump we can knock out in just 4 years.
you better deploy and start using your 2nd amendment and the so many riffles, so sad to have so much ammunition and loose POTUS, to a biden, onama, diblassio, schummer, etc etc
FLASHBACK: Robin Williams' Hilarious Rant About Joe Biden Is Just As Relevant Today
I will make a deal. I will pull my vote from Biden until he taxes a test if you fully release Trumps Tax returns from 2015 on. You do that I will demand the person I am voting for to take this test. Deal?
They're not saying you're voting for Trump. They're saying you won't vote for Biden over Trump.
We can only hope that Biden remembers what happened to McCain once he made his Veep choice.
I think the public knows most than enough to judge Trump's character and leadership competence.  He's been on TV forever.  Similarly, all I want to hear from Biden is who will replace him in a year or two, and what few concessions to progressives he might make.
Did Biden denounce anyone burning the bible? NO!  Trump did!  Trump is no angel, and we didn't hire an angel or a man of the cloth. We hired a man who will defend us against our enemies, and will bear the burden for the lost lives of our soldiers and the lives of the enemy.

Depends on definition of "Mostly Socialist" System, need to see specific questions. I would say the breakdown represents the % of Liberals in the Democrat Party by age group. Liberal meaning Bernie ideology or more radical Liberal. Remainder will vote Biden &amp; some Trump haters.
Give me a freakin‚Äô break! I‚Äôll take Biden‚Äôs occasional missteps in speaking, looking for the right words, etc. over your incoherent babbles, constant lies and grandiose, self-serving statements of more lies any day and all day, you putz.
Biden had the chance when he was in office, for the last 40 years.
No matter how Democrats and Media want to spin it, why won't Biden take a cognitive test?
BIDEN   International Embarrassment.  The man has lost his faculties and still you prop him up...  üò≥üò≤üò¢Do you think one of those parallels, long experience and relationships in the Senate, gives Biden‚Äôs legislative agenda more legs than Obama‚Äôs had. So much, I guess, depends on the party composition, but that was always a knock on Obama‚Äôs admin, that they struggled on the hill.
I think the author doesn‚Äôt understand that Israel will always be supported by the US, but it‚Äôs obvious Harris and Biden will be less supportive than Trump
President Trump answers dozens of questions daily from a hostile media.   Biden and Harris have answered no questions from a friendly media since announcing the ticket.   Could it be they have no answers to our countries problems?
Simple, if you're voting for Trump, you only vote once.  If you're voting for Biden, vote as many times as you like.
He is racist. My black friends and neighbors definitely are not all the same. They aren't all Biden voters either. Of course Biden doesn't even think they are black if they don't vote for him.
‚ÄúTrump is our last hope!‚Äù ‚ÄúBiden is the only way to heal this nation.‚Äù  Me: ‚ÄúHave you guys heard of Jesus?‚Äù ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs eternal and conquered death. He‚Äôs God incarnate.‚Äù
What is sad is my black neighbors are scared too? I hear all the time how they want the police here. But, we all know that there won't be enough of them and our Mayor and Governor want the violence. Never let people like Joe Biden tell you all black people are the same.

I have to assume this dam will break eventually. It's unsustainable. I'm fine with team Biden playing prevent defense for a while, but he'll have to make the rounds eventually, and this really raises the stakes for when he does. If he doesn't ever, of course, that should cost him
Ooo, sweet burn, bro. Even tho Biden and Harris gave speeches 2 days ago, the day after he announced Harris would be his VP. Not in his basement.
That‚Äôs his point I think. If Democrats start acting like an opposition party for once they‚Äôll  beat him pretty handily. 2 1/2 months should be enough time. Just don‚Äôt let Trump, who‚Äôs willing to run left of Biden on issues to win, actually run left of Biden. I would love to 1/
Here's how you counter that.  GO TO THE FUCKING POLLING PLACE AND VOTE THERE!   If you're sick, request a ABSENTEE BALLOT!  If you want to help Biden and Kamala to win, you're going to have to do it the right way.  BY NOT CHEATING!

I don't. For what? Biden isn't interested in #BlackEmpowerment.
The progressives lost already. We don't have a dog in the fight. Bernie is working hard to get Biden elected. So am I. I want M4A badly, but the 2020 election isn't going to get it. Protest vote is going to make things worse-solidify Trump's power. Like it or not it's Biden.
There you go again. Both you and Kamala are great together...you‚Äôre both liars! Behind every Joe Biden tweet is his VP pick
I'm still trying to figure out what the hell he's talking about. Hey guess what meat prices dropped if that's what he about cutting our meat then Biden and Harris got my vote. Sorry pence is a moron.

I read your reply. It was self contradictory when you said "Biden or trump. Pick one".   My answer to that is "no".

Joe Biden is definitely senile.
I am more/less on the same page as Cornel West. I'm not endorsing Biden-Harris, but I am voting for them. One of the top orders of business we progressives/leftists have is anti-fascism. And that's why we're voting to remove Rump. But we're not done once Rump is gone.
Not even Biden is pretending like he's going for a second tern and has basically saidbas much, I know he said he "isn't ruling it out" but he pretty much has to say that.  Every indication is that he will serve one term, if that.
I listened to future president Biden. Not one time did he say any of this! Wake up America our President is a narrassis liar.
It is hilarious to me every time a Republican cites the current situation in America as a reason not to vote for #BidenHarris2020. Hey morons, that‚Äôs WHY we want to vote for Biden!
Only if trusted Medical Professionals agree that a vaccine is safe.  If Dr Fauci agrees I will.  I trust Joe Biden as well because he will listen to Fauci or other trusted Medical Professionals.  When Trump has his "October Surprise" and announces a vaccine, the answer is NO.
As a former Republican....Go Biden!!! Go Harris!!!
But neither Biden nor Harris are socialists....? What are you going on about?
Biden got angry when Trump began shutting off travel a little at a time as the Caronavirus first spread, in hindsight he says Trump was too slow to act. Which is it Slow Joe ?
Another term of Trump destroys what's left of the country, so we progressives won't have anything to fix at that point. We're just going to have to suck it up and install Biden. And we'll have to hound him into the ground.
this is America if #trump is re-elected. Vote Biden/Harris 2020 'It's like a war': beatings and indiscriminate arrests as armed men roam streets of Minsk

I understand the reasoning for Bloomberg and Kasich speaking at the convention, but we need to hear people that have something iimportant to say as well. Not just just the money man and a guy who may bring some Republicans to vote for Biden.

I understand this. I agree it won‚Äôt happen under Biden, we have to look beyond this election cycle. I am literally about as far left as one could be politically, but unless there‚Äôs a full blown revolution it won‚Äôt happen in 2020. We must act with foresight.

Agreed. Biden/Kamala must win for us to have a chance to sway Dem voters. If they lose the DNC will move right and Bernie‚Äôs progress will have been for nothing.
Exactly, they‚Äôd rather lose with Biden than win with Bernie
Do you not understand that Trump will REVERSE ALL THE PROGRESS WE‚ÄôVE MADE. Maybe Biden won‚Äôt push us forward, but he won‚Äôt openly bring out racism and fascism as well as dismantling USPS, Medicare, social security, national parks, etc.
I agree in sentiment, but this election is different. Trump is openly dismantling all the socialists progress we‚Äôve made. He‚Äôll see the end to Social Security, Medicare/caid, libraries, USPS, publi utilities and LGBT+ progress. A Biden admin wouldn‚Äôt do this.
We need to vote out Trump this November. Vote Kamala and Biden and we can at least have the possibility of moving the country left. Without them, Trump could do unknown atrocities. People advocating AGAINST Biden/Kamala are doing so from a place of privilege.

He‚Äôs a crook. He admitted to committing election fraud which is a federal crime! We must indict this SOB if he pulls this through and Biden wins by some miracle!
If you can vote for a pro war pro increased police funding candidate, you have to be white, and probably a woman. They are safe from Biden.
Hope? Hope for what? That Biden demands Alyssa Milano's career be saved/ resurrected??  America isn't exactly interested in a Charmed or Who's the Boss reboot.

Our children are watching America. Biden 2020.
Are we not doing Bi for Biden?
Of course there are. Biden supporters need to be getting on the phone, knocking on doors, and just in general showing some enthusiasm for their guy. It‚Äôs pathetic and lazy to see only attempts at shaming. The fact is many voters see that the two party system has all but given 1/

I‚Äôm sure you haven‚Äôt listened to Pelosi or Schumer. And no real exam of Joe Biden and his sexist / rasist comments I‚Äôm sure!
I picked trump would win in 2016, I suspect Biden will in 2020.
I‚Äôve been all for Bernie but I voted for Clinton in 16. I have volunteered my time and money to multiple progressive campaigns. I give a shit about my state and want better for it. So can someone from Biden‚Äôs campaign tell me why I should vote for him?
My vote means shit. If I lived in a swing state maybe I‚Äôd be persuaded that Trump is the lesser of two evils. But Kentucky isn‚Äôt vote by mail yet and Covid exists. What is Biden doing that makes me want to take a risk for him? He sure as hell hasn‚Äôt taken a single risk for me.
The rapist and the transphobe or the rapist and the transphobe?  Back when Booker was in the race I probably would‚Äôve voted for Biden since I was already there. But as a resident of Kentucky where Trump won by literally 30 points what the fuck is the point of me voting this year?
Now do Biden‚Äôs son. Seriously you are a fool.
The pandemic did this not them your past actions will take u down we already see it all over internet why is that coward bIDEN HIDING  YRYING TO AVOID DEBATES HED A SCAREDY CAT
What did Obama/Biden do about it ?
My sister and I were talking about how disappointing it is that  isn‚Äôt our nominee. We‚Äôre still going to vote for Biden and Harris but our hearts will always be with Elizabeth Warren. I trust she will be a force for good in the Senate after we sweep #MoscowMitch out.
üëáüèª by what mystical power are the disenfranchised meant to ‚Äúhold them accountable?‚Äù When has this ever happened? What possible reason would Biden/Harris have for listening to radical demands AFTER receiving the mandate to rule, if they don‚Äôt even care now?
Preface this by saying I‚Äôm an independent. Trump has major character flaws. Biden clearly has something going on. It‚Äôs gonna be a shit show. Depending on media sway- this virus and/or social unrest may disappear by November.
Right, like Hunter Biden? Nice try!
Tucker is the angry and unhinged face of the Republican party.   Biden and Harris are mature and balanced and are ready to lead America out of the dark days of Donald J Trump.
Political fear mongering is a tactic used when you're losing on the issues.   America, we are losing over 1,000 patriotic Americans a day from the coronavirus under   watch. Keep that in mind when you're voting for Joe Biden 2020. The truth and morals matter.
Biden is going to take your guns, no, wait, your God, no, its even worse!  He‚Äôs going to take your steaks!!!  How can the Onion even compete with this!?
Translation:  Biden wants to save American lives.  Trump doesn't care about anything but his reelection.
Dammit!  You can read me so well.  But in the socialist hellscape I am hoping Biden-Harris implement, I would get rid of the internet and give that money to all the poors, amirite?

One of these guys believes in and has faith in God, and the other guy is Trump (who has zero morals, no integrity, and is only out for himself). So I‚Äôm pretty confident in saying Biden has morals. Do I necessarily agree with his politics... no, but he‚Äôs a better man than Trump
What about him? I‚Äôve only said two things about him... 1. He can‚Äôt remember what day it is 2. According to Trump, Biden has more powers than the Avengers  I said I‚Äôm glad I found the person who determines whether or not someone is moral. Who knew you were the guy?
Don boy seen here backing Tucker Carlson bringing us the hot takes. America is, in fact, not movable. Physically, ya can‚Äôt move it. But Biden? Super movable...like a person. Hot takes, people, HOT TAKES.
That‚Äôs clearly not what this was about dumbass. The the accusations against biden are credible, the allegations against Alex Morse were not only fraudulent, they didn‚Äôt contain any misconduct to begin with. The fact that you would try to act like that‚Äôs a grift is kinda telling
Poll: Voters approve Harris VP pick, Biden gets image bounce  via
Trumps political commercials should just be Biden and Harris taking jabs and accusations at each other from the Democratic primary last year.
In Biden and Harris‚Äôs presser they demand a national 3 month mask mandate. They basically said, ‚ÄúWe know what‚Äôs best for you. Do what we say.‚Äù Folks, that totalitarianism. That‚Äôs big govt. That‚Äôs how they will rule if in power. Over all your life.
Joe Biden is making Calvin Coolidge look charismatic. And Coolidge has been dead for almost 90 years.
That would be a great question to ask the people who shut it down. It was an unprecedented move. Considering the medical experts and the democrats didn‚Äôt even want a travel ban in the beginning. I believe vp biden said trump‚Äôs actions were xenophobic and racist.
And trump* saying Biden will "HURT GOD"... REALLY?  He *thinks* (&amp; I use the term loosely), ANYONE can *HURT* GOD‚ÅâÔ∏è PLEASE‚ùó
It‚Äôs so transparent that none of you trust what Biden will say we he is left on his own. If you can‚Äôt trust him to debate you can‚Äôt trust him to lead.

CNN basically called Tucker Carlson a racist for mispronouncing Kamala Harris‚Äôs name. But Joe Biden mispronounced it during a press conference introducing her as his VP pic. You can‚Äôt make this stuff up.

congratulations!!! Can‚Äôt wait to vote for you and Joe Biden in November
Anyone who sees allegations against Biden but no allegations against Trump is not a logical person. Both of them have allegations; neither of them have anything proven. Why don‚Äôt you just admit that this is about party adherence and your ‚Äúmoral outrage‚Äù is nothing but a facade?
A certain part of twitter seems to be upset that Biden picked a qualified woman of color instead of a qualified white woman. That‚Äôs unfortunate. Kamala is not perfect, but no one is. Please stop acting like this is the end of the world. Thanks.
She left because she didn't want to cause more devision in the party she believes in bringing people together not separating them like you do and believe me her and Biden are going to win in November and leave you out in the cold
But the thing is, Biden voted for the iraq war. He spent 8 years bombing the middle East with Biden. He says that Palestinians don‚Äôt necessarily deserve sovereignty. Trump is outwardly mean. Biden arabs you in the back while smiling. Frankly, the former is preferable imo
The reason there are even cages for the kids on the border is because Obama/Biden built them. They obama admin also built more border fencing in their admin. There is no material difference between the two tickets. The only difference is emotional.
It literally does not matter who wins this election. This is not twitter hyperbole. The things that make Donald trump bad are the things joe and kamala have spent their careers building. Biden cut social security, authored the crime bill and so much more

On Tuesday, Biden tapped California Sen. Kamala Harris to be his running mate, making her the first Black woman to serve on a major party presidential ticket. Here is a look inside his search process.
Biden does not want an Administration full of yes men like Donald Trump has he definitely is one who looks at others opinions ideas and education and experiences in order to make a rational solid good decision for America and he has my 150% support
Get ready for 4 years of Trump.   Biden just nailed his coffin.
Poor Hannity! On the trump bandwagon tonight, don‚Äôt you realize that you‚Äôre speaking to trump base? Nobody who will vote for Biden/Harris will be listening to you. So very desperate and pathetic.

#BREAKING Joe Biden has picked his running mate
If DJT doesn't make some of the mistakes he's made in 2020, he wins in a landslide, all bc the Dems couldn't get behind a candidate until late spring. No party can afford to be that far behind, especially vs. an incumbent, or in the case of Biden's VP running.. a perceived "heir"
I know of people didn't vote for John McCain bc he picked Sarah Palin as his running mate. Lots of people believe Biden is a "one-termer," meaning this is voting for potentially 12 years of the presidency. Let's say DJT wins in November... more...
Lol that's hilarious considering what Obama/Biden did
I mean she also retweeted joe Biden‚Äôs post so.......... explains it
Right on. Cuomo cannot (or will not) see the other side of the debate. His hatred for Trump blinds him.   Does he really want a weakling like Biden? Probably not, but he will never say that.

Thank god joe Biden will round up anarchists like this
2/2 you need to educate yourself instead of spouting msm. Trump got things done that Obama and Biden didn‚Äôt/couldn‚Äôt. Will higher minimum wages hell or hurt blacks. I see a lot of machines taking human jobs. McDonalds and wal mart has you working checkout instead of an employee!
Take a quick read of this and then tell how good Biden is and how he works for you. Note it‚Äôs a new york times article.
Joe Biden's controversial remarks about race this week risk alienating young Black voters who despise President Donald Trump but are not inspired by his Democratic rival.

The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has rejected a request from the Trump campaign to either add an additional general election debate or move up the calendar for the contests.
If Biden wins republicans will go back to pretending to be mad about spending and democrats will go back to pretending to love spending. The last 4 years will be wiped from our collective memory and we will go back to bourgeois brunch and working class suffering.this kinda sums it up

I'm the happiest I've been since Barack Obama was elected.  Kamala Harris is a great choice for VP.  The Biden / Harris ticket will rebuild America.
I get what you are saying, but I disagree. If they are diametric opposites, then yes supporting both might be useless. Imagine society as a spaceship with people as the engines. It is possible that your desired vector can be attained using both groups. Not that I support Biden.

Biden is laying the groundwork for a Democratic dynasty. He‚Äôll step aside in ‚Äô24 and hand it to Harris, at that time, a de facto leader. He‚Äôll go down as a selfless savior of the nation.  In the meantime, Harris is a visible VP rooting out corruption.  That‚Äôs the plan. I think.
Biden picked Harris because she‚Äôs safe, but energizing. There‚Äôs no chance that her seat will be filled by a Republican. She‚Äôs popular with the middle of the party where most of the votes are.  Get that and you‚Äôll get why he picked her, and she accepted, disagreements aside.

I wonder if Biden, Obama, and Sharpton will be speaking at the funeral?
We won't know until the Democrats "find" enough votes for Biden to win.....however long that takes.
It might be a move in the right direction; if she was BLACK. She isn't; and she has done more harm to BLACKS than Biden.
Won‚Äôt be nearly as entertaining and the trump Biden debate
You want someone to o challenge Trump?  Isn‚Äôt that the role of Biden?  You calling for a debate?
I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd start my day telling a bishop to piss off, but here we are. Joe Biden is Catholic. Bishop Tobin is bearing false witness in this matter.
I don‚Äôt like either choice but am concerned about the impact to the second amendment rights should Biden be elected.
Listen, I understand completely that Biden/Harris is not the ideal duo to run the country, but can you really sit there and accept another 4 years of an evil, selfish, warlord running this country and slandering our name? We‚Äôre becoming a joke. Just shut up and vote blue.
can someone please explain #novote2020 to me, like i‚Äôm profoundly anti biden but leaving your vote on the table is essentially being complacent in the destruction of the country
Lebron appreciates joe biden for what? being a pedophile..james is a joke! TRUMP 2020
Ask me to vote for Biden while looking at my brothers kids since he's in prison behind Biden legislation. Ask me to vote for Biden looking at pictures of my dead friends who OD'd and a list of his pharmaceutical donors. Go fuck yourself before ever telling me to vote for him.
You do realize Bernie gave his full support to Biden &amp; now Harris today!
is SO AFRAID of Trump winning in this election because #Biden is so weak, the reflection in his mirror beats him.
is SO AFRAID of Trump winning in this election because #Biden is so weak, the reflection in his mirror beats him.
This moron claims you can‚Äôt pick someone if they are disrespectful, all the while he purposefully mispronounces Kamala, calls Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas, and calls Biden Sleepy Joe. And he‚Äôs too f*cking stupid to see the irony. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Very excited to see what the Biden/Harris administration will bring. #BidenHarris2020
Lol we‚Äôre not excited we‚Äôre MAKING ourselves be excited and looking for the best. Gays definitely can‚Äôt have Trump another four years AMERICA can‚Äôt have Trump another four years and while Bernie mf Sanders will forever be my 1st choice he won‚Äôt be nominee and so Biden it is
Biden is the nominee, Kamala is who the people will not be voting for when they lose.
Who pretends their fav musician can be president and says this is reality. No dude, thats make-believe. Children play that. I dont want biden or trump, but im not gonna hype up kanye when he is having trump staff run his election stuff. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
I knew #Biden was going to pick Kamala Harris #BidenHarris2020
To my recollection Pence has never been accused of sexual misconduct.  Biden has and Sen. Harris stated she believes his accusers
Who did y‚Äôall really think Biden was going to pick
üòÇüòÇüòÇ  The DNC lost me when they anointed Biden at the beginning of the race. Now they‚Äôre just putting salt into an open wound.   Maybe  can actually get a chance next time around
So Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate?  Pack it up, everyone.   I guess we‚Äôll try again in 4 years?
My reaction when I heard Biden chose Kamala Harris as his vice president running mate. #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP #KamalaHarris #BidenVP #BidenVP #BidenHarris
The only reason the Biden campaign is NEARLY as progressive as it is is because of the CONSTANT backlash and activism from leftist/progressive organizers nationwide.   Silencing them is to accept a moderate platform. I do not accept a moderate platform. Vote Biden, but advocate.
‚ÄúCriticizing Joe Biden means Trump wins‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry but silencing people with genuine concerns for some feigned idea of a unified Democratic Party And ignoring the cracks present in the coalition aren‚Äôt going to win us an election. Vote Biden, but VOICE YOUR CONCERNS.
We should STILL VOTE FOR BIDEN however we should NOT BE SILENT when we have disagreements with his campaign. Ignoring the problems apparent in his administration‚Äôs picks for the sake of feigned unity is not going be how we beat Donald Trump.
It would be quite an honor had it been with an actual contender in this race. America is not buying what the Democratic Party is trying to selling. This race was decided long before Kamala Harris was announced as VP candidate. Joe Biden is mentally unfit to assume the presidency.
Democrats made a mistake putting all their eggs in the Biden basket to begin with. They shouldnt have shut out Bernie when he had tons of enthusiasm behind him.
Why does it still surprise me that Trump‚Äôs reaction to any news about Biden and Harris ends up being a sophomoric, sexist, racist rant about THEM being mean and/or disrespectful??? When someone tells you who they are by their actions...believe them.
How about her egomaniacal attacks on Brett Kavanaugh?  Failures as a CA prosecutor   Oh, she was bussed to school, and Biden was against it.  Just another political opportunist.
If you are voting for President Biden &amp; Vice President Harris, respond with üó≥Ô∏è
From clashing with Joe Biden to being his Vice President pick, Biden-Harris is a disastrous duo. Their socialist agenda is too radical for Indiana. Vote Republican this November! #IN08 #KAG
Can‚Äôt find the emoji but definitely voting for Biden/ Harris üëç
Is Biden purposely trying to hand the election to Trump on a silver platter? Because he just did.
Looks like the immediately popular pick of Harris struck a nerve.  And to think ANYONE in the Trump campaign has any moral superiority is laughable.
Former Vice President Joe Biden has selected U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate in the 2020 presidential election.
She‚Äôs more than welcome to rectify them and become more progressive over time however the core issue is that in an election where POC coalition support is crucial, the Biden campaign chose someone who undercuts whatever support he throws forward for movements like BLM.
üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èRT  Raise your hand if you‚Äôre voting for the Biden-Harris ticket! #BidenHarris2020
This is just weird She called Joe and his policies racist, and believes the women that accused Biden yet she is his VP pick?
So it‚Äôs Biden and Harris to take on trump in the election? Good god we can do so much better all around. What a fucking joke this elections is gonna be.
Kamala harris running with biden guys we fucked either way
I just wanna know who in Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign say months of people on the streets protesting police and said ‚ÄúWe need a cop as VP. It‚Äôs what the people want‚Äù
In the year of civil unrest and black lives matter movement. Biden says he wants to raise funding for police and then picks a cop for his running mate. 2020 fucking sucks
Biden just literally checked off boxes for VP.
Joe Biden has chosen his VP running mate. Via
Whoo Hoo,  Kamala Harris is Joe Biden‚Äôs pick for VP. üòÅ. Yes!
Joe Biden set to name running mate
BREAKING: Joe Biden has selected a Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate in the race for President.
Biden selects Kamala Harris as running mate. &gt;&gt;&gt;
Biden made history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
Got it.
This is a peek at Biden/left‚Äôs communist America.
Kasich and Biden are the model of working across the aisle. We need that in a huge way. These lawmakers,on both sides, have to be able to work in a non hostile environment.
Joe Biden is too confused and scared to debate Trump this month ... come on man let us Americans see you debate Trump now .. if you can‚Äôt do that this month then there is no way you could even think about running American
‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt win the election, China will own the United States," Trump said in a radio interview. "You‚Äôre going to have to learn to speak Chinese, you want to know the truth.‚Äù  # via  MT: What a stupid thing to say.  Zhƒìnshi y√∫ch«în dehu√†.
Bc Biden is showing he can work with all people concerned with fixing what tRump screwed up in our country.  Kasich always spoke for the best for our country even if our basic opinions are different
This is great, by
Why is Twitter not banning Biden‚Äôs account for this obvious Blatant LIE?
Do you believe that the liberal law breakers, the corrupt, the spys and the sexual predators i.e.  Obama, Clintons, Biden (Hunter and Joe) will ever be held accountable?
That wall will not keep out those determined to get in. It needs to come down in Biden‚Äôs first week as president.
Not one thing said here should be surprising. It was alsways going to be Harris after Biden committed to a woman VP. Warren is going to be charge of Treasury.
Hell yes, he and hiden biden !! üò±ü§Æü§Æüí©üí©
Biden is gonna end everything good in america. re elect trump!!!
would be great at any job offered him by  Biden including chief of staff!
Pelosi&amp;Chuck&amp; Biden&amp; democrats are all in China‚Äôs pocket.yet she says Russia wants Trump to win yet trump been harder on Russia then all other democrats combined JUST REMEMBER DEMOCRATS LIE LIE LIE TILL FOOLS BELIEVE UM . I will never vote democrat again .. TRUMP 2020 And BEYOND
Marketwatch, can you please post the articles after Obama/Biden cut payroll taxes? Did you say the same?
Flat out lie!! You couldn't win against Biden and he's got dementia.  So what's that say about you
Thank God. Yes  praise the Lord. Biden and the Deep State will be defeated! But will they accept their beat down as gracioudly as Hillary did in 2016  2017, 2019 and now 2020? RALMAO!
where you at? you hiding in the basement with Biden? Your players wanna play, make a statement.
Biden was seen riding a bike. Trump ever even rode ? üòÇ
BS. Biden didn‚Äôt want a travel ban. Cuomo put Covid positive patients in nursing homes. Trump offered help to the Governors but many declined the federal assistance. The virus fallout is NOT Trumps doing no matter how many times the media delivers this type of message.
and  vision for the first woman to succeed the first Black President, great on paper, not so much in real life. Not backing Joe in 2016 was the worst decision for our country Obama ever made. Biden was perfectly capable then.
Who is ‚Äútearing down biden‚Äù. All i see is most MSM hiding and protecting the senile old man that doesnt know where he is most of the time. If he was a conservative gop candidate facing an incumbent liberal, you would be demanding debates.
Its too late to make substantial change on climate change. You all fucking failed there. Marijuana policy isnt in the agenda homie. Dont play that. And biden specifically said, he wants to increase funding to police departments. You cant train police social workers and exect good
First image released of Biden's running mate.
Biden is going to pick Kamala Harris

They aren't stupid enough to directly approach Biden. Their support will just be on social media like the Russian troll farms. There will be Chinese troll farms working for Biden.
But if the theory stated above is true it‚Äôs not really a selfish act. He‚Äôs intentionally stealing votes from Biden so his buddy trump can get re-elected.
Where have we heard this information before? Are all Democrats masters of plagiarism or all just mentally challenged like Joe Biden. #TrumpLandslide2020
True . Look how far they have let Biden go . That guy had no idea what he is talking about.
Lol.  President Trump just signed an EO that accomplished more than Biden has in his lifetime as a politician.
Yes her and Biden
#KanyeConJob Funny, Trump is yammering about debates with Biden. Why not Kanye too?
Oh and Biden‚Äôs been convicted in court? Your accusations are just that of Biden
Joe Biden doesn't know what day it is.
Republicans are convinced that voting for trump is going to save them from a communist hellscape and democrats said ‚Äúwe can match that energy at the polls‚Äù and put forth Joe Biden
But yet polls continue to say Biden is beating Trump ü§îü§î.  I don‚Äôt believe it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Keep America Great üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Why should Biden say anything when he can do this üëá
She's taking votes away from Biden and Trump. #LetHerSpeak
#UsefulIdiotsPod. Thomas Frank on Anti-Populism, Plus Biden's Most-Stoned Moment Ever
Has Time officially endorsed Biden?  We all know that‚Äôs why you bought it. So you could have an outlet for your political beliefs. We win when everyone is represented. Not just left wing causes and interests.
Wish YOU were still running. So impressed with your words and knowledge plus your empathy!! Indiana Pete, Biden needs your help! Trump and Pence are full of lies and constant distractions!!
Biden doesn‚Äôt fuck porn stars. Biden doesn‚Äôt cheat on his pregnant wife.  Biden doesn‚Äôt ignore the Coronavirus &amp; let 160,000 people die.  Biden didn‚Äôt deny &amp; ignore Russian bounty on our troops.  #VoteBlue #Biden2020 #FlipTheSenateBlue
donald trump yesterday said that Joe Biden will hurt God if he's elected president! Hurt God? Whaaat? Is this guy sane at all? Wow! This guy is a real "shiticus"
God forbid any group of players have differing opinions on how things are handled. Typical brow beating into solidarity of thought that Biden dementedly let spew out of his mouth that behind closed doors the Dems count on
Biden is a good man
üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ Hiden Biden is denigrating himselfüòÇü§£üòÇ. Russia, Russia, flipping RussiaüòÇüëå
Who thinks it's ok for Putin to actively denigrate Biden and promote   How can anyone not push back on a hostile foreign country meddling in our elections?  I know Trump wants to win at any cost - but democracy?
If Biden said he would unban tik tok if Trump does he would have a lot of boomers voting for him.
Then, why didn't the Me Too movement support the lady that Biden sexually assaulted? Are there 2 Me Too Movements? There is back-up on this assault; it was on Larry King way before Biden thought about running.
We really didn‚Äôt dissect Joe Biden saying people getting access to universal healthcare would be an insult to his dead son enough.  That man is willing to let thousands of not millions suffer because of some vague notion that alleviating their suffering would be AN INSULT.
Sleepy Joe Biden? More like sleepy michael miller.
Good luck with that #Biden
Pelosi, Schumer, Obama‚Äôs, Biden, Gates and all the evil doers and Socialist! Please move to China!!
Shouldn‚Äôt even be close!  Hiden Biden is going down
But, boy, is she giving Dana  heartburn
Joe Biden's 4 trillion tax hike will hit middle and working-class Hoosiers the hardest. We can't afford Joe Biden and the liberal Democrats!
I have a working theory that Joe Biden wants to lose
Thanks for the info you are sending, whoever this is (undoubtedly one of Joe Biden's "handlers"). Your boy is quickly failing. You didn't have this planned, did you people? Lol!
And while he‚Äôs blabbering on about nonsense, pissing all of us off, his minions are propping Kanye up to rob some of Biden‚Äôs votes. Bait and switch.
I‚Äôm guessing Hiden Biden will appreciate this bill if only he can just rememberü§£
They do notice that about Biden. That's why they then turn around and focus on picking Trump apart. To get the attention away from Dementia Joe.
What about the conspiracy theory that biden even has a chance at winning in november? That is some bat shit crazy stuff there. He likely wont even remember what he is running for.
Good ole Jim Crow Joe.
Like they are going to let Biden debate.
Yep that‚Äôs why they gave Ivanka all those trademarks, to butter up Biden ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Can jason miller possibly be more ignorant?
The lame stream fake news socialist media are doing fake polls showing President Trump losing so that when he wins re-election on November 3rd. they can say he cheated and will use their fake and meaningless polls showing Biden winning as ‚Äúproof‚Äù of it.   Keep America Great üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏!

It means the same as a vote for Biden. Do what is best for your country! The Dems are destroying it and we cannot take 4 years of Obama style of governing.
I personally don't care what reason you need to vote for Joe Biden, just do it!
I will vote for Biden NO MATTER WHAT
Biden hurting god sorta sounds badass
im confused, does biden have some angelic power to "hurt God", did you just admit that he is stronger than you'll ever be. I kinda wanna vote for somebody with the power to hurt god. Ngl, thats avenger lv stuff.
And yet he and republicans attack Biden for much less compromising touching.
Within the last week Joe Biden has managed to insinuate there is not diversity within the Black community &amp; advocate for not only NOT abolishing the police, but INCREASING THEIR FUNDING.  This is REALLY the man moderate Democrats thought would be BEST for energizing Black voters.
Fox News is reporting that Joe Biden wants   ‚Ä¢Guaranteed Basic Income ‚Ä¢Reparations ‚Ä¢Government Paid Childcare ‚Ä¢The Green New Deal ‚Ä¢Single Payer Healthcare ‚Ä¢Prison Abolition  Like fuck I WISH. COULD YOU IMAGINE? That would be AMAZING.
Lol. You all get rid of those candidates from the start. But im glad you finally understood. When biden makes some policy to help people with mental illnesses ill look at it. But he gotta stop putting black people down, i wont support that ever.
Biden never said that! Stop your lying!
I didnt say biden was the president did i? And we are gonna focus on one thing, because at this point you arent even trying to get me to vote. You actually sidestepped my questions about what i want. And said something about climate change, its too late. So did i say he was pres?
Also the revolution started before trump was in office. Or did blm not matter then? 7/13/13....who was president? Was it trump? Wait, i think biden was in office as some authority figure or something. Again you are showing how ignorant you are. Why would i listen yo you? LMFAO.
The fact that many places have begun reallocating police budgets to the people. Police are losing relationships within the community left and right. Police have been told to stop doing this and to stop doing that. But yeah, the revolution isnt "working". biden isn't doing this.
These changes have been made without biden or trumps support and actions. Seems like we can change things without your scare tactics. So you want me to vote for somebody who will change things less than the revolution, the one you say isnt working? Ok, boomer.
Yall begging us to vote for another warmonger who wants to increase police budgets. Sorry bout yuh! I really dont give a fuck. Black people matter. And clearly biden doesnt see it that way. So yes trump sucks,...wait no revolution? Are you ignorant to what we have changed already
Trump's latest stance is that Joe Biden is against "God, Guns and Energy". . . What is 2020
Schrodinger‚Äôs Biden logic  Unable to form a complete sentence  Also able to hurt God.
God is all powerful, all knowing and able to be wounded by Joe Biden. Noted.
Well 50 percent of the white vote has been voting Republican for decades. If anything most of the time it‚Äôs been more than 50. So if Trump is down to 50 that means Biden has a decent chance
Holy crap, Joe Biden has a Hattori Hanzo blade.
Apparently Biden is gonna hurt God. God better watch out!
