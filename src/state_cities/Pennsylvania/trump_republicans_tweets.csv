Scott, other countries have verified it. There’s also bank documents that show money transfers. Trump lies. You must accept that.
Could put this on a loop and and play it every single day until the Election. It will be true every one of those days.  That's ALL Trump and his Sycophants have  Great job Don! 🏆👏
were not worried about trump's tweets, were worried about WHAT THEY SAY, and what they imply he will do, if it werent for shit like that hitlist he put out a few weeks ago, WE WOULDNT BE WORRIED, we might CARE, but we wouldn't be WORRIED
Could we just have Barack Obama as POTUS again, just for a little while? I could listen to him forever. With Trump, I need to turn the TV off. Can't stand his voice. Just saying.
maybe, but I'd bet less than you think. I think its a real short list of folks who are on the fence with Biden but would be swayed by VP. Most folks on the left at this point know either they won't be feeding the machine or they can't sit by with Trump as the opponent.
Or the Trump virus.
I'm sad to say there are Trump flags all over the Outer Banks. The boat people love him! They are loud and proud.

OBAMA.  YOU DID NOTHING. FOR 8 LONG YEARS!!!  SO STOP PICKING ON OUR EXCELLENT PRESIDENT TRUMP.🤔😚
This means if the mail-in ballots for the election get lost or mishandled, it's all Trump's fault.
My first thoughts tRUMP &amp; Russia🧐
And trump tweeting about the wall keeping people out. Who would want to come here?
1) never said it was deadly 2) it’s useless against COVID-19 but great for its intended use i.e. malaria, arthritis, lupus 3) when trump said it FDA approved it for covid, propelling multiple studies including the FDA’s. So your point is well, pointless. You Anons are grifted lol
Wow read some of your posts and retweets you might hold the record for retweeting conspiracy theories if it weren’t for Trump like your hero Donald you must believe in demon sperm and alien dna?
Here’s why Trump is going to lose - this is the canary in the coal mine  We’ve just sat through 2 months of every millionaire black athlete telling us how racist we are   Yet, every 30+ male I know is waxing his carrot about getting to watch Lebron kneel for the flag tonight. Sad
What world are you living in? You probably swallow all the Trump koolaid.  Compare the current Corona hot states all run by GOP governors with the Democrat governed states
Karma at its peak best. This is the most symbolic illustration of the Trump presidency.
Why don’t you take a stand now against cutting the $600 unemployment benefit, federal storm troopers,  stand with black lives matter and condemn Trump’s racism, xenophobia voter repression tactics? Your redemption as a human being is a long road back the mask tweet is 1 step
Happy to help 😬 If you want something more to stress about, recall the Trump admin didn't bother to send people to visit many depts/agencies pre-inauguration. They may be totally unaware of what the norms are surrounding a transition (or may not care).

Ming, every time trump says it out loud, that means he’s working on it. This ain’t over.
And it's the Dems' fault because they opposed closing the US border to travelers from China and Europe, speciously accusing Trump of xenophobia.  Additionally, the recent Coronavirus outbreaks are directly attributable to the mobs that ignore social distancing and/or masks.

Trump wants to delay the election just so he can buy time for himself. He knows he’s going to lose and so he wants time to try to cheat his way into winning the election.
But his obit must always read that he defied the recommendation to wear a mask and died because of it, and because of Donald Trump.

I knew the Dems would be up to no good when they starter to claim that President Trump told people to inject or ingest cleansers. They however would benefit greatly from gargling  with copious amounts of Listerine. I can smell their fetid breath through the TV.
I thought it was reported a good while back that access to classified material was taken away by Trump.
What worries me is not whether or not Trump wins, or cancels the election, but what petty, vindictive and destructive executive orders he will issue when he realizes he has lost and still has 2 months left.

I usually hate it when people say that Trump’s actions are a distraction from something else, but it’s too much of a coincidence that he tweets about delaying the election at the exact moment news breaks of the worst economic quarter on record.

You might think that this "Nobody likes Trump" is cute! Let me tell you that only a non-thinking individual can come up with this kind of statement!  Many people do like Trump!   In 2016, around 63 million voted for him! In 2020, many millions are going to vote for him again!
How about ABC, NPR, NBC, all fake right? FOX is the most FAKE NEWS THERE IS! And Trump of course! He has people so fooled. He may be a moron but don’t think he didn’t come up with this “Deep State” crap and “Q”and any other outrageous crap that he uses to take the blame for him.
Good they won't need any- Trump is the one that needs the Cops!

Funny you should say that, because I find it to be spot on.  - Many people in Portland see Trump as the face of Fascism.  - Those same people are setting buildings on fire and burning stuff, attacking police.  - Trump means to put an end to all of that chaos going on in Portland.

Not at all, but please note: I was referring to the Saudi regime, NOT the Islamic people. People of the Islamic faith are the ones most horrifically victimized by these theocratic, radical governments. For the record I also consider Trump’s immigrant policies barbaric.
Ya, but the whole idea of conflating income with race implies that Nadler thinks anyone who is poor isn't white.   Either way, Trump's thing is classism... which isn't really any better.

No chance.    We know Mueller was director of the FBI during this time.   We now know FBI knew everything, ignored victims emails and worked a plea deal with Epstein.   If trump was in any way involved Mueller would’ve dumped this on day one.

I don't think this is exactly true. Trump tapped into something rotten that other regular Republicans couldn't or wouldn't.   Rubio probably would have beaten Clinton, given the dynamics of things, but he wouldn't have the energy that Trump had. Trump's performance is unique.

The question is whether Trump did it smartly or stupidly.   The biggest hidden money case I ever did was only in the vicinity of $70m, but what gave it away was a legal document that included a individual’s address on it.  The amount of paper you need to do it properly is huge.

Trump picks up the phone. “Hello sir,” he says. “It’s done.”  “Cain is dead?” says a voice on the other end.  “Your elaborate plan - the rally, the mask doubting, everything - worked.”  “Well done, Mr. President, your job is done. I’m freeing you.” Papa John hangs up the phone.
The left is just like the right leaning politician days. The first two years of his presidency, Trump had all three, and he DID NOTHING. The Republicans and Democrats are do nothing rich elites. Tucker Carlson CONFRONTS Jim Jordan
The best thing now is to encourage Trump to be his most awful, despicable, criminal self for the next 3 months, and for every R Senator and MOC to go along for the ride. We need the most sweeping landslide in history so no party ever takes the Trump path again.
Powerful people such as Cain and Gohmert don't blindly follow someone. Is the mob boss bribing individuals such as these? We know the low-information base gets turned on by trump's hate, but someday they'll realize they're #DyingForTrump. Will they consider it a good idea then?
Trump is a threat to our democracy and is becoming more authoritarian by the day. This country will not survive another 4 years of Trump.  I prefer Biden's policies and like that he is working with Bernie on a tax plan. This is what I like about Biden:
Question is what happens if he loses, declares it rigged, calls on the Qtards to take up arms, and surrounds the White House with the Barrstapo? They just had their second trial run in Portland (first test was illegally clearing the square for Trump's photo op) and #3 is starting
For all of you who want Barr to resign go drink a beer and learn how to live with your lies The issue here is the socialist people who disrespect our country our people and our president trump 2020

In general, when Republicans complain about something: gay men in restrooms, voter fraud, corruption, that usually means they're projecting something they do--or want to do--onto others. So when Trump says "the election will be rigged", hear aspiration, not accusation.

Leading to an ending almost literally from the Trump 2020 campaign team, signaling that women/minorities who want to change things are the real Nazis - and that the notion of democratic voting by the people is hilariously stupid
I have to believe that those who think that George W. Bush is likeable or rebranded after giving a few peppermints to Michelle Obama and not being as overtly racist as Trump also get their historical education from Instagram.
What I’m doing isn’t projecting.... that’s not what that means.. it’s not what I was doing. If you think he’s done a great job I worry about your future. If Obama or anyone else did the exact same job I would think they sucked. You guys show a complete inability to question trump
Now watch DHS will withdraw the courthouse will burn, and President Trump will be Vindicated as Federal forces were needed to Secure Public Safety! Brilliant move
You’re just another of Trump University graduates!!!
Trump attempting to do a coup:
Donald Trump is a fascist. Period.
The military will defend Trump if the Supreme Court rules that he is still president. This is the real danger.
Not that I say that's a concrete thing, Biden calling upon Bernie.  But it's a high likelihood.  The reason I want Biden is not because I hate Trump (I do), but because I know Biden will surround himself with people RIGHT for the job, unlike what Trump did.
Trump tells voters who live in suburbs they ‘will no longer be bothered’ by low-income housing
“Clean out this beehive of terrorists” is how Trump describes the literal kidnapping and brutality against peaceful protesters in Oregon.  He used the phrase “clean out” and let that resonate. Older generations have heard this before.
Trump literally contradicts himself in the same sentence. Jhc.
Is it my imagination, or does the texture of Trump’s face look more and more like the Yellowstone mud pots?
You’re fully confident that the Supreme Court will rule against Trump when he sues to invalidate the election results? A “coup” that keeps Trump in office after he loses the election will look like Bush v. Gore, not Pinochet v. Allende.
Wut.  Trump said he's sending in the National Guard to Portland to "take care of them."  "We're coming in very soon."  Which is of course, utter bullshit.
Trump, just now while talking about Portland refers to peaceful protesters as "terrorists".
The media outlets are allowing Trump to have a televised hate speech campaign rally. Actually it's more like a therapy session to spew lies.
He being heard by those he wants to reach all those ignoring him will be the loudest of the loud screaming "how did this happen!"  Trump has a agenda and he's working the phuck out of it.
OmGOD This LYING horrible president #trump has been lying non stop for 45 minutes and now faces softball questions from the press. Disgusting. #anotherbaseballquestion
Like, if Trump attempted to do a coup, the coup would straight up consist of him tweeting a thing, and then every Republican in Congress pretending they hadn't read it, the whole federal government not doing anything, and then Biden becomes president.
The people around the world aren't laughing at us like Trump proclaim's, they are laughing at him.
If you can’t be bothered to mention Trump by name...why do you have a problem? It’s almost as if you’re still protecting him or holding out hope for him.  We all know who he is and what he’s about...
When Trump is out I want a moratorium on the word tremendous.I am a RepublicanzI do not like CNN.. you guys are all the same.. lol.your cult loves this guy. You should definitely create a profile pic of Trump’s head on Rocky’s body and turn him into a demigod: that’s totally not weired at all. Oh also. Trump never lied. Also, never sinned
Could you guys get some ads into PA, please?  The only ads we see around here are Trump's.
Hillary was awful at getting the people on the fence to vote for her.  I'm not saying Biden is good, but Trump is awful too.
Had a Trumper try to convince me not to voter for Biden.  Told him I was a 1 issue voter, I want Trump out of office.  Biden too old? Don't care.  Biden sniffs girls hair? Don't care. Biden son and Burisma? Don't care.  They really get frustrated when you tell them you don't care
I do not like Biden... I will vote for him as a default, but I just hate Trump. Your typical democrat insults don’t work on me... I don’t care...in fact you got nothing so you are making this is fun..enjoy the knowledge I am dropping on you. You argued with the wrong Republican..
Yes. And wonder how in the world anyone can support him! Trump will go down as our worst President in history.
Oh for sure I will be and not for Trump! #WeWillVote
They got in a realestate conflict, but it had nothing to do with morals. just $
Regan’s ghost hates trump too..no respect from my Republican Party?!!! I heard Bush is gonna vote Biden too... beautiful thing.. not because I like Biden, but because I hate a trump
NOW BECAUSE OF YOU WE WILL BE DEALING WITH THIS BULLSHIT FOR DECADES!!!!  YOU FUCKING HORRIBLE NARCISSIST!!!! NOW WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE OUR FRIENDS AGAIN THANKS TO YOU!!!!!! FUCK YOU TRUMP AND GO TO FUCKING HELL!!!
There is NO WAY you built 10 miles in a week 😂. Most of the other stuff is replaced old wall/ only 3 miles was new. In 3 years 😉. And back in January it blew over in “high” (38 mph 🤪😜😂) winds. More “quality” Trump construction 🙄
I am not a democrat. Use something else...god grief.. I told you so many times... I go to church, live god, love guns, love the US, but hate Trump. He is ruining my country. Exhibit a...brainwash.. cult alert....
You know what here is how I feel. I can’t believe I stooped  to your level but here it is:
Here’s a foxnews one for ya:
Hold on I will find another source that says the same:
I’m dumb but you keep believing all these lies?  This is literally how ever convo goes with your cult. Facts are presented, convo is reciprocated, then insults are hurled after they have nothing else to bring to the convo. I’ll stop your level..enjoy:
"At a moment when the Black Lives Matter protests have sparked a debate on how to eradicate systemic racism, Trump vows to keep it alive." --
I literally voted Republican in every election except I sat out both Romney and 2016. Trump is an awful human being. He needs to go.
The trump virus, trump lured him to the rally, which they signed waivers not to sue if they got sick, trump owns this one
I don’t care about Obama. I am a Republican. I just hate Trump because he is evil. How can you be a woman and a trump supporter? Just curious?
Guess what asshole? I despise trump and I’m back to work. Terrified, but working.
Gestapo Trump
Just what level of self loathing does one have if they wait in line to see Mike Pence? One of the most boring politicians in our history. I mean, if you're an idiot into that sort of thing Trump would be Metallica and Pence would be that amateur playing acoustic John Mayer covers
Do not follow the Donald J Trump in this image it is a fake account check out the name is spelled incorrectly and there is no blue checkmark
They are waiting for Nov 03 I bet Ruth Ginsberg  dies when Trump is re-elected!!
Of course.  I expect nothing less from the crook in the White House.
Line ----------| Trump   Line-----------------| Trump   Line ---------------------| Trump   The line keeps moving further and further with a complicit GOP
. forgive me, but I can't resist the opportunity since I've been monitoring your interactions these last two hours.   While some are calling you alarmist, I think you're on point with respect to Trump's suggestion of delaying the election.  Thread
So, Trump just had to have his rally.   The crowd didn’t wear masks.  Now Herman Caine is dead, part of the 150,000-strong legion of Americans killed by the virus.  I wonder how many other a Trump supporters died as a result of attending that rally.  Don’t you?
Voting for Trump in PA
Joe Biden says Trump's failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump
I feel like if Trump drops out and doesn’t run for re-election, and the GOP selects a young conservative who is well spoken with a POC conservative VP pick then they’d win the election in a landslide.
LMAO saying Trump dont even have a dick, THIS IS FUCKING GREATNESS
I WILL NOT RELAX THE PRESSURE UNTIL THE DAY DONALD TRUMP IS REMOVED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE!!!! I WILL FIGHT EVEN IF I DONT HAVE THE FIGHT IN ME!!!!! I WILL NOT REST UNTIL WE HAVE PERMANENTLY REMOVED TRUMP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE!!! #Resisters
Donald Trump "logistics" can't even develop a national testing strategy.   (If) a vaccine is developed, I don't want TrumpCare involved in any part of a national vaccination strategy.

Herman Cain was killed by Trump's selfish Tulsa rally.
will lock it up in PA. Pennsylvanians are sick of the Democratic mindset and nonsensical agenda that is sinking us, IE  ...He’s been the biggest asset to Trump’s reelection campaign.
Trump should resign today.
Obama is a Rock Star. The more trump insults him the higher the pedestal we put Obama on. It kills trump that Obama will go down in history as one of the greatest and most loved President of all time.
According to the Cong. Research Ctr  there is no direct “definition of executive orders, presidential memoranda, and proclamations in the U.S. Constitution, there is, likewise, no specific provision authorizing their issuance.”  Trump can write any EO, including an election delay
I predict Donald Trump will accomplish it something like this:  1. Issue an Executive Order (EO) 2. Get it tied up in the courts as he has done with every court decision not in his favor; 3. Use the courts to issue stays, holding his EO in force until a judge makes a decision.
RUDY TUDDY YOUR JUST A CLOWN AS TRUMP.
At least Trump learned his lesson...
He needs to be afraid cuz the USA is turning on him more and more each day
Barack Obama: "Our administration" Donald Trump: "My administration"  #WordsMatter
t’s always the same with this cult. Lol...literally the other day I saw someone’s profile pic with Trump’s head on Rocky’s body. What the heck?! That is really weird and making him into a demigod. It’s funny. In their eyes he is without sin. Rediculous
I wonder if Trump Adoodle Do will be there?

WTF has Trump talking about god damn pizza?!?!?!?!?! #Resisters
It all could have been safer, better, and less deadly if we had a real leader in the white house.  I'll say it again, I lay all these deaths, anguish, and suffering at the feet of Trump.
Because they kiss Trump's ass thats why
I’m sorry that you aren’t President right now, Joe. This man deserved to be honored by our president. Trump is a racist, small man. I look forward to helping you kick him out of office on November 3rd.
if you get a letter that has a check inside for $45 and is addressed to you from Melena Trump, do not deposit it. We may have a scam on our hands here. My mom got one and our local news station wants to investigate it. Ill keep you posted. Its endorsed by the Republican Party
AP FACT CHECK: Trump's view of flawed voting is baseless
donald trump is going to be the winner of the 2020 presidential election and i hate that there's a full three months more of the agonizing hope that won't be true
From  Trump pledges case of slain Army soldier Vanessa Guillén won’t be ‘swept under the rug’  Asked whether he would support the third-party legislation that the family is seeking, Trump said, “We’re going to look into that very strongly.”    His stock response
You do know Trump and everyone in his cabinet votes by mail. You also know that the military votes by mail. He knows he can’t rig it like voter machines. Check our these fun facts:
As she often does, Amy nails it.   Trump is a racist sexual predator. His base is made up of racists and likely a lot of sexual predators as well.
Vice President Mike Pence's campaign bus collided with a dump truck this morning outside Pittsburgh.   I think the only other vehicle that would be more fitting to explain the state of the Trump reelection campaign would be if it hit a garbage truck.
Lol good luck!! TRUMP !!!
Remember kids, Trump voted by mail. A number of states routinely vote by mail. The only reason Trump is making a big deal of this is because he knows that without voter suppression and Russian interference he cannot win.     #VoteByMail #TrumpLies
Trump explicitly floated delaying November's presidential election on Thursday, lending extraordinary voice to persistent concerns that he will seek to circumvent voting. These are the tactics of fascism. Adolph Hitler in a Trump form.
Herman Cain attended Trump's Tulsa rally on July 20th and didn't wear a mask. He is dead today.
Life support. I’m not sure what will happen to her when Trump wins in November.
The whole planet is lying and trump is your only source of truth. You cant accept facts because everything is a conspiracy. Trump has been a well known con man since the 80s. He's on tape bragging about walking in on teen pageant dressing rooms in the 90s. You're being conned.

Ex-U.S. Marine sentenced to 9 years in Russian jail  Help him if you can, President Trump. I am a former Marine 1963 to 1967. One 13 month tour in Viet Nam
Absolutely reeks of bigotry! Is there anyone advising Trump anymore?
This arrive late thing seems to be perpetual for Trump. Weather it’s rallies or meetings with world leaders. He thinks it’s a power play for people to wait for him. It just makes him a rude ass.
It was the Trump/Pence bus but I believe that trip just Pence was on it.  I subsequently had the dumb luck of being late to a movie I wanted to see cuz the theater is across the street from the airport and Trumpy’s plane landed: an hour after his event was due to begin.
Guessing her “fostering American growth” plan is as fleshed out as Trump’s healthcare plan he’s been promising for 4+ years now.
And an anti masker who went maskless to your lord’s rally. So essentially trump is responsible for his death.

So now there's a problem with  voting by mail but wasn't a problem when trump himself voted by mail.
Its a genius tweet! All eyes are now  on cheating via mail in ballots! Its the same move Trump made 3 months ago on hydroxychloriquin! #WWG1GWA
Donald Trump AND all of his enablers should resign.  Pass it on.  #LincolnProject #ResignNowTrump
All Democrats, including Biden, are against the murder of trump supporters. There isn’t a need for murder since they will take care of it themselves.
Dan, do you support initiating the constitutional process through which Donald Trump could be removed from office in disgrace?  Your Republican constituents want to know.    We’re tired of this clown.
I can’t wait to hear your thoughts on tRump trying to delay the November election 😏.  Voter fraud has been thoroughly investigated in the past. Multiple times. And found to be nearly non existent. Except for *Republican ballot fraud / voter suppression in Georgia.
Loyd, have you begun the constitutional process through which Donald Trump can be declared unfit for office and removed in disgrace?  Your Republican constituents want to know.  We’re tired of “winning,” with 150,000 Americans dead, and a third of the economy gone.
I will if you agree to volunteer your thoughts on tRump trying to delay the November election 😏.
Definitely WON'T be eating trump pizza.
Has the Pa. Senate yet begun work on a resolution calling for the initiation of the process through which Donald Trump can be declared unfit for office, and removed in disgrace?  Your Republican constituents want to know.

I don’t mourn him at all. His party has directly caused the death of thousands. Karma! Trump next, please!
Donald Trump is clearly unfit for office.   #WeWillVote
In today's episode of 2020, Herman Cain dies from COVID and Trump calls for suspension of the election.
So if trump is implicated by Ghislaine Maxwell will you stop supporting him? Or will it be fake news? He has been saying obscene things about young girls and accused of sexual assaults for decades. Not one word from any of you. Stopping trump is helping stop child abuse.
I can’t resist this comment...You think that a Trump stands for the constitution? You are funny. He is dismantling it by removing all checks and balances, loves dictatorship, and wants to be one. America does not want a king and if you do, you do not stand for democracy....
“I think the American people..want me to be the president forever...because I’m such a wanted person...People want me..I would say I’m the most wanted..by the American people..some might say I’m America’s..most wanted”- Trump in a couple days.
It is sickening the way these trump loving, 2A, anti masking troglodytes treat Dr. Rachel Levine. She is brilliant, and is trying to keep us all alive. She is brave and strong and true to who she is.
I think you are confusing me as a Democrat. I am a conservative that hates Trump. Your Obama and Democrats insults are not hurting my feelings or challenging me one bit. Stop watching fox news. This is my last response to you. I am done wasting time.
Wonder if trump got his playbook for our election during the Putin call. Just say’in
You might want to re-up some of your pieces that Trump can't cancel or postpone the election.  The press is tryjng to "create suspense" again after his tweet this a.m.
Please don't let trump delay the election. Fight him hard!

President Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
Donald Trump cannot be allowed to use ANY excuse to unconstitutionally stay in power a second longer than he's entitled to. America cannot be allowed to become a dictatorship.
We are sick and tired of our porn star President, and it’s time our party did something about it.    Badly trailing in the polls, an economy shrinking by a third, a pandemic out of control with 150,000 dead.  And Donald Trump calls for delaying the election.
Do you happen to know if Florida will be shifting health policy in line with Republican hero Stella Immanuel? President Trump was impressed!  As long as you don’t have sex with demons you don’t have to wear a mask!  This is the Republican Party.

Trump is the great embarrassment to the USA
Both parties have agendas. I’m not a traditional democrat. I was a Republican. I don’t believe in fascism so I do not like Trump

So following Putin's orders for future conquests? We don't trust you Mr. Trump. #NotMyPresident
Hopefully, because that will keep us from living an Orwellian hell. Do you know that the word homosexual wasn’t actually in the Bible? It was put in there in the 18th century by a German publisher. The word translated to pedophile. If you believe truth, why do you follow Trump?
DEFINITELY! Watching the F&amp;M polls this morning, 50% of people said if the election was today, they’d vote for Biden. Only 41% Trump and the rest undecided or neither. 🤞🏻
Educate myself?!?...I am an educator. Trump spews hate and division and people believe it. Sad...
I just don’t understand how they can be so stupid? “This will be Biden’s America.” K well it is the current America which is under trump sooo 🤔🤨
She can’t, but she should check this out!
Are there windows? You know how we democrats hate windows...hahaha. I can’t believe Trump said that. What the heck?
He sees anyone that doesn’t agree with him as his enemy. He’s a bad guy. I was a conservative and maybe one again if this guy and his GOP enablers, who want to destroy the constitution for their own personal gain, get ran out of office. Trump got rid of all checks and balances.
When trump’s ads show videos of chaos and says that this will be Biden’s America...do you morons not realize that that is trump’s current America? 🤨

The election is just about over, especially in Pennsylvania.  Trump has abused workers, farmers, and just about everyone else.  Pennsylvania Republicans are tired of this clown.
The White House has acknowledged publicly that the issue was covered in the President’s PDB.  Real Republicans can see through your lies in trying to defend this clown.  He had a phone call with Putin yesterday, said nothing.  Draft dodger Trump doesn’t care if US troops die.

Wake up.  Most Republicans are ashamed of our party; sneering at masks, undermining public health officials, not giving one shit about the 150,000 dead Americans.  And now Trump is turning it into an undignified circus with his witch doctor.     Shame.  #notthepartyofReagan

Fact.  Republicans are ashamed of our party.  Ashamed of the mask sneering, ashamed of the undermining public health officials, ashamed at the total lack of empathy toward the 150,000 dead.  And now Trump is again turning it into an undignified circus with his witch doctor.

Neither do live people who refuse to patronize nonessential breeding grounds of irresponsibility to get trump reelected.
Well  you might be right so I think you should go to Walmart and get some Clorox bleach and a tall  new water glass and bleach that crap right out of you. Also insert a UV light in an orifice of your choosing. That's how trump does it.
But Trump changed his tone...
Lol! You tell me. You must have all the answers somewhere behind your fake acct. 👍 please stop wasting my time. I'm busy trying to convince all of your comrades to take the trump approved cure
For all those afflicted with TDS it wasn't necessary as it never happened. Just more fake news. You really have to stop the insanity just to gain power. You're losing badly with the powerful silent majority that will be voting in force for Trump come November.
Just so you know, Trumpers feel like Trump is that guy.
Trump heading to Texas for a fund raiser and to look at an oil rig field.  He's really Presidential around inanimate (Donald, that means "not alive") objects.    Especially since they don't ask questions.
So you're pro fascism. David Duke publicly supported trump. BLM doesn't mean only black lives, it means black lives matter too. Find me a photo of someone sporting a swastika, confederate flag or flashing a white power sign that isn't a Republican.
Just heard about Trump pulling troops out of Germany.  Lard Ass has accomplished more in 4 years than the Russians have tried since WW2. Putin must have given him the orders before November just in case tRump doesn't get elected. The treasonist Repukes will back his play.

Cuz Trump invested a lotta money into itOh, for the love of God. I feel myself leaving my body. Not only that, I'm afraid to have a bad thought. Can you believe that was on Twitter and that the Trump family pushed it? I hope we make it to Christmas and New Years. It's going to be a very lean existence.
I'm skeptical. It's now less than 100 days until the election. All of these years have gone by and he has supported Trump through the longest 3 1/2 years I've ever experienced. These people are out to save their own sinking ship. I refuse to be duped.

Trump couldn't build his wall on the border, at least one that will stand in a storm, so he built this one around the White House. It takes a lot of gall. It's another symbol of his all consuming concern for himself and great insecurity.

You have your hand out every year.  Trump's tax brakes were for the rich.  You are holding up the voting rights act.  It should be named after  Congressman John Lewis
You were brave going to Nam. Trump said Not getting a  STD was his Nam.  My cousins fought in Nam.  Alot of my unit fought in Nam. All of our squad leaders were Nam vets
man stop arguing with trump supporters they never learn anything
Who worked with Kanye in the Administration ... who is going to 3rd Party Trump? What a Failure!   Already seeing so many Indy voters supporting Kanye RN.   There are a few in the Admin who have really went 'in the tank,' ... Intentional?   The DEMS?
Why did commit fruad Trump University,  why are you hiding you financial documents and blocked witness's from testifying
Biden! Because I'm saying I'm voting for Biden to avoid scrutiny while actually voting Trump.
Trump and Kelly are in this together - they know they can’t win by playing by the rules, the polls have made that very clear. They’ll stop at nothing to spread lies, attack our Democracy, and undermine the Constitution. Pitch in now to kick out Kelly! ⬇️
NOW: Trump is defying the constitution by saying we should delay the November 2020 elections.  Trump: Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???
THEN: Trump and Kelly joined forces to sue the state of Pennsylvania over their shared conspiracy theory that vote-by-mail is an attack on our democracy. We know what they’re really up to — voter suppression is the only way they will win in November.
FIRST: Trump and the entire GOP began to tank in the polls. Here in PA, Trump is trailing Biden by 7 points and I’m within single digits of Mike Kelly.  (THREAD)
The reason we are talking about it is because you keep trying to undermine our civil liberties. You are the single biggest threat to america since the American Revolution. i.e Benedict Arnold. That trump would make such a statement is proof of his intent to destroy this Nation.
In this episode of Black Mirror, a developer's flippant decision to use a Trump presidency as the root cause of a worst case, last stage response to an easily averted national crisis wreaks havoc on the lives of digital subjects in an advanced CDC simulation #RC9999
What I find utterly amazing is the fact that not one of the members of trumps Cabinet have the fucking balls to tell the dam truth and pimple is the worst sitting there with his smug smile knowing that this crap from trump is just killing our Democracy undermining free elections.
Thanks brother. I am a vet. Trump,  think about the stripes on our flag. What about the bounty Putin put on our soldiers, getting out of the open sky treaty with Russia. Trump is a Quisling. Give me Liberty or give me death Patrick Henery. Alan Dershowitz said Trump has more
Question please how did you cast your vote when you were overseas.  I want to shut Trump up about mail in voting

I hope it is only real Americans are true Blue Republicans! And Everything but COVID-19 Trump got right. But for my health I must vote Biden but if Trump wins I'm content. I just don't want to pull a suicide lever. COVID-19  is my true enemy! 😔😔😔
Trump needs to use this on the Campaign trail I like it nice job supporting Trump. 👍💯
No Trump will be a one term president
This rhetoric is completely unacceptable.  We should be encouraging people to vote safely by mail, especially in the middle of a pandemic:    You can apply for your vote by mail ballot at
If anyone is lazy it is Trump
There is going to be one in January Trump will be gone. If this corrupt Wallstreet there would be plenty of money to bail them out
one year, In 5 months under trumps lack of leadership 152,000 more deaths than the average year because he does not want to do his God damn job. trump calls it the Kung flu or the China virus because he can't or wont do his job we have to deal with it's fall out from his failure.
Putin,bounty, money,Deutsche Bank,Trump.  Gary Kasparov said Trump has more connections to Russia than Aeroflot
Hope you like jail lock Trump up. A.G Glenn Kirschner will put the Trump crime syndicate in jail
Trump will have free room and board in prison when A.G Glenn Kirschner puts him there
Trump wants to delay the election due to mail in voting and also wants to defund USPS? I don't just smell a fish, I smell a dead Gyarados.
Trump sees nothing outside of himself, he is incapable of feeling anything outside of himself.
Trust me I like Trump. I voted for him in 2016 but on this virus he got it wrong!
Economy Tanking + Fears of losing election then being indicted = why Trump suggests delaying election
I voted Trump over Hillary. I don't regret my decision between the 2. Just hated that was the best America had to offer.
The man attended a Trump rally and refused to wear a mask. You get what you pay for. C you next Tuesday.
I think all the candidates are shit its pick the best shit that somewhat goes with your beliefs on what they can actually accomplish vs what they promise and ill take the unfollows right now its trump like it or not.
I thought picking between Trump and Hillary was rough, but Biden and Trump might be worse. How is Biden the best the democratic party has to offer? Out political system is a joke.
That was a simple example, but politics in general can have heavy affects on prices as well as world peace. Not to mention the environment. It's why Harper was a subject of ridicule world wide for Canada.. just as Trump is for America now... and lil' Boris in the UK
I’ll never forget the feeling I got when I woke up the next day after the election and my mom told me Trump had won.... a shiver over my whole body.... that was the moment  my hatred for this country started.
Trump
im spending my next trump check on a graphics card.
The only Virgo man I knew harassed me the day after trump won the election at school and tapped trumps face onto my locker. I hate them lmao
trump just lost 30 Million more votes unemployed people will never vote for republicans who left them with nothing VOTE DEMOCRAT they are the only party wanting to help the unemployed
A casualty of Trump's ego to boot
These antibodies don't last long. So be safe stay apart and don't trust anything Trump says about COVID-19 unless it makes sense like mask, goggles and hand cleaning.
Trump floats idea of election delay, a virtual impossibility
Wow trumps deadly rally claims one life so far disgusting trump campaign people gross people 🤮🤮one less vote interesting how mostly trump supporters are dying from covid you would think he would want to save his voters guess not
That is why he hates President Obama.  Trump started this with the birther issue. President Obama paid him back at the correspondent's dinner. Trump  can dish it out but he can not take it.
you are just probably a racist trump supporter 😭😭😭
Trump and the GOP are kneeling throats (our rights voting)
Trump is losing Pennsylvania badly so many that voted for him are now disgusted by trump
Vote by mail America stop trump from cheating again that’s why he is against mail in voting because Putin can’t hack them 🌊🌊🌊vote democrat save your life
Trump is an insult to America
Do not forget the open sky treaty with Russia Trump got out of
Trump doesn’t joke. Said so himself.
Mitch saying the election isn’t moving a big thing. Trump isn’t going to get his way from either chamber of Congress. (No worries about the date. I was able to understand it. 😀)
That is why Trump wants to doubt the result. What is the rate?

Hey Trump, this is how you bring people together!! Unity!! E pluribus unum!!
How True brother.  Trump could never be the person Congressman Lewis was
He helped with my health care it saved me and my wife about 12,000 in one year.  Trump and the GOP will never do that. Thanks President Obama.  My wife and I voted for you 2 times. Would do it again

Yeah protest in the streets. Democrats and Anarchists will drop like flies ensuring a Trump Victory in November.
If I was President you would be begging for Donald Trump to be President. The Austerity Measures I would impose would be harsh and Americans would have to go to work. Our debts must go. I would ban Credit Cards, loans and I would ban Alcohol and drugs as well I will crackdown!
Yeah he went to hear Trump babble about why he drinks water with 2 hands &amp; why he walked so slowly down that ramp at West Point. What an amazing cause to give your life to 🙄
Two things:  1) If absentee voting is good, what makes mail-in bad? They're literally the same thing.  2) Trump's insistence on delaying the election lines up with with a dictator trying to destroy electoral integrity, and thus try and steal an election through corruption.
He's not. Come on now Trump is helping America. He is laying the road to bring In jobs. I know you Dems want free stuff and free college and medical care but we are $25 trillion in debt it's time America starts to pay it's bills.
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
Republicans openly challenge Trump's tweet on delaying election
So, what you're saying is that it would take 60 votes to delay the election because Trump will losing?
Just another stab at Trump. Democrats are so full of Hatred they are backing a White Supremacist for the Presidency in Joe Biden.   I will go and vote Joe Biden on November 3, 2020 over COVID-19. But I do not like Biden, I never will and if he wins I will cry.
So still a hoax?? Send kids to school?? Don't wear a mask?? Still blame governors?? Will trump go to his funeral?? STOP the division!!
It’s not Trump’s America you dunce. It’s Democrat run cities, so you have proven our point that you are evil. Able to watch your own cities burn for political gain because Biden is a terrible candidate... shame on you.
Alan Dershowitz said Trump has more power than a king,  we fought a king. Give me Liberty or give me death
For every democratic supporter that is whining “ Trump can’t support any business while holding office, ITS ILLEGAL “ please remind them their princess supports a business from Chyna #BLM
Some Minorities worked their asses off for a better life, were able to move into the Suburbs, but The low income housing act allowed poor housing to be built on their upper crust land, introduced inner city crime to the suburbs. Trump just ended that.
He's Putin's patsy. He's not looking for safe voting. He wants to be Putin. We all need to vote by mail to remove Trump and Putin from our country.
I know Trump is a womanizer and a sexist from his raunchy talk as a TV Celebrity. Yet none of which is really racist. Creepy at times towards women but not racist the whole nation knows that.
Do you know if Trump is related to the owners of this business in any way? What exactly is he gaining from promoting a small business? You cannot send me a link and say here’s your proof. I get that if he’s GAINING something by tweeting this out, it’s illegal

Facts are kryptonite to Trump, impeach him again
More Trump lies, he knows he's out so he's trying to delay the inevitable
THE BEEZEWAX: Trump Doesn't Plan on Leaving
I’d be a little less concerned about what ever illegalities you “think” Trump has committed and more worried about what’s going to happen to all your favorite politicians once you learn what they’ve done.
That means no more poor people Invading the suburbs that people paid so much for by hard work and effort only to have the poor and druggies move right in. Trump ended that!
A.k.a. they live in Cities. This is why the better off working class moved to the Suburbs to get their families to safer areas. All races that are well off have done this the low income housing act that Trump eliminated now protects the hard working American class from city folk.
All you need do is look up his statements and your jaw will drop. Copying statements is plagiarism and his desegregation rant in 1977 was telling and his hostile voting record against minorities in Washington is of no secret.blind hatred of Trump clouds the mind.
Trump is finally taking the virus seriously in considering mail in ballot fraud, not Absentee ballots but just acknowledging that COVID-19 is a threat Trump took a big baby step towards admitting he was wrong!
Trump's  dumb remarks
I’m one of your biggest fans would love a response and your opinion on if you think the Democrats will actually somehow let Joe Biden slide and get out of debating? I’d love to see it because there’s no way Trump would not just destroy him

Vote by mail America stop trump from cheating again
I don't agree with Ari on everything, but I follow him because I respect and appreciate his insights/opinions. I've never liked Trump, but now people that approve of his presidency are getting worried about his actions/speech.
Bad mistake on his part this virus is an Aerosolized pathogen which makes it highly contagious, is why the spikes in cases are so high. Wear the mask it's better than nothing. Also we must Vote Biden because Trump is not approaching this Virus seriously.
Parody.  Look it up. Trump sucks but this isn't him. Vet before you spread misinformation, please. It doesn't help our cause.
This is a parody. An impression for comedic value.  is the comedian. Look it up. Trump sucks but misinformation is the republicans game. Vet before you post, people.

It's a parody. This is  a comedian who does Trump impressions. I hate Trump but people need to stop spreading misinformation.

Trump will do anything for money. Trump son said they get a great deal of money from Russia. Read The Plot to Hack America by Malcom Nance. Gary Kasparov said Trump has more connections to Russia than Aeroflot
try more pro Trump in you bio,just sayin..
Yes I would, but they would also get the same response I give every MAGA, " fuck Trump "
Yes, it's a parody.  is the comedian, he does videos and a really good trump impression. He posted the video and was clear that it was a parody. Then people took the video and ran with it.
All it take is 1 Kevin McCarthy to high light the short fails of the republican party. Not to mention how bloody stupid they are. How in the hell did that moron get elected, never mind that would be like asking how trump got elected
I think our definitions of "Sane American" is probably opposite. I was very much against how Trump played down the the severity. That said, Trump's 15 was closer to 15k than the all the public health community's 2M.
“Talent can give you a head start but training is the trump card. Talent is common. Discipline is rare. The combo is elite.” -
You know this is no longer about party it is about 2 rules of law one for trump and trumps enemies. This about an America where we have reverted back to to 1960's and the evil that consumed this Nation. i.e. segregation now and segregation forever. This is about hate and bigotry.

I'm 1 of them I like Trump. We need a President who will bring back jobs who will end strict regulations and get America working again. We need manufacturing back and steady employment, lower taxes and freedom. Make America Great Again Trump 2020. 🙏
Enjoy it now because it’ll never last Biden doesn’t have a brain let alone any running mate that’s were talking about and if it’s Kamala Harris the hate towards her is worse than the hate towards Trump can’t wait for you people when Trump wins reelection what are you gonna do joy
Trump is a great President just not on COVID-19 but everything else he is spot on. With Joe Biden you will put a racist in office. "I do not want my kids growing up in a jungle, a racial Jungle." 1977 Joe Biden on Desegregation debate.
Honestly not sure who to vote for. I vote for county more then party.   I am not a huge Trump fan but Joe Biden literally did not know what city he was in today or what year it was.   Just can’t believe these two are the best we have.   #usa #maybethingsgetbetterin2024
President Trump says second stimulus check ‘may go higher’ than $1,200
A strong Vice President. If Trump is re-elected the next four years will be hell and anything he does could effect us (particularly young people) for years to come. Please, just consider voting for Biden. Thanks for taking the time to read this.
The next president will be choosing her replacement. The court is already stacked with conservative justices. That replacement and the make-up of the court will effect you and all young people for decades. Also, unlike Trump, Biden will surround himself with strong people. And

Go Trump Go 2020 👍
Trump puts rich Americans first. He’s done nothing to effectively tax them, and the rich have only gotten richer.

Trump is crying about losing the popular vote by about 3 million. How many times has the Quisling Trump talked about presidential harrassment? What about Trump taking Putin word over the intelligence agencies
Why would Congressman Clayburn support him?Why are so many African Americans supporting Biden. Research what Trump did pertaining to Obama and BLM
He can do nothing and if Trump would push he could get a nuclear missile up his ass you forget that part.
Trump 2020 for real Biden 2020 for COVID-19   You vote Biden you give power to Marxist Terror groups BLM &amp; Antifa so yes choose wisely. Biden is really tied to Russia &amp; China!
So has Shoe officially endorsed Trump yet? I'm out of the Shoe loop.
90+ days to election and they haven't decided if he should rip of Bernie, Clinton, or Trump. What a mess.
No way Jorgensen gets 1.5%   She doesn't have the notoriety Gary Johnson had nor the platform to resonate with Rogan listening pot smoking Berners.    I also don't think the hidden Trump vote is all that big.
Trump deserves his protection he earned it and if Joe Biden wins then we are in real serious trouble.
Donald Trump is a white supremacist, full stop.
Denying facts that the Obama administration illegally spied on the Trump campaign...this is why you can’t get anywhere with the radical left.
Okay fair, but where do you get off denying the fact that the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign???
Jesus so now you’re denying the fact that the Obama administration illegally spied on the Trump campaign??? How can you honestly deny fact??? What in the actual FUCK

General isn't Trump thinking about pulling troops out of South Korea?
Don't forget about Trump getting out of the open sky treaty with Russia
Interestingly enough Erie was in this, and it went 7-2 Biden including 4 Obama-Trump voters.  You would think that would be noteworthy that a usually blue county that flipped in a usually blue state had this kind of change, but that doesn't get rage clicks lol.
Do you remember in 2016, when Obama addressed the nation and mentioned that they needed to stock up on masks and that we were not safe from viral attack? 🤔🤔seems like he was setting the stage for Hillary to strip rights, cause they didn't see Trump coming🤔🤔 #justsaying
Get real. You are from a taker state. Look at Trump budget that you are for tax breaks for the rich
Also my town was in this, 7-2 Biden.  Which is interesting for a PA county Trump narrowly won in '16
No ,but you would get away with it if that laser pointer was a Trump supporter . No ,definite jail time if Laser pointer person was not a Trump supporter . Other options - Suing Them - winnable if defendant is Trump supporter . Not so winnable if not .   Just the facts Ma'am
Trump has lost his economic edge over Biden
This weakens NATO which is what Putin wants. Remember Trump getting out of the open sky treaty with Russia. GOP government of Putin
I’d be a hypocrite if I denied a trump gaffe but I haven’t seen any. Plus I have seen the interview you’re referring to. There is no mistake at least none like Biden. In fact trump is pushing for school choice which will help the less fortunate including blacks.
So you get mad about baffling Biden &amp; attack trump because you can’t believe Biden isn’t lucid? Not our fault or trumps. If you can show me a verbal mishap of trump I’ll be happy to acknowledge it. But you people get pisssed &amp; can’t acknowledge Biden’s failing mental state
Don't let your idol trump hear you say anything about Jews. He will cry and go golf another round. Bc we all know he doesn't do his job

If Biden has it what do you call the Quisling Trump?  Notice most of the Congressional black caucus are Democrats.
Trump just saved the value of the biggest asset I own.
The constitution needs rewritten. Every form of government works ideally but becomes terrible when humans get involved. So when you get a trump in office who cares more about himself than the people it doesn't matter what the constitution says or means. America is ruined
Of course they need to be told. They  don't owe trump anything so can do the right thing. Trump doesn't like that. He wants his judges working for him. He doesn't know or care that it's not supposed to work that way
Obama did nothing. How do you feel about Obama spying on the Trump campaign in 2016
Bullshit! I have been at my job for 5 years &amp; our minimum wage was $8 &amp; 3 years into my job it is now $11 because of what Trump did
It's Official Americans are Stupid! Especially Democrats &amp; far Right Republicans! While the rest of us who are vulnerable still quarantine to try and stay safe you idiots protesting &amp; rioting are spreading it around. Cases surge, people die and you blame Trump! No you hold it all
No. I don't hate Trump. I hate the way he acts and the terrible things he says and the way he has ruined and divided our very fragile nation. But I see Trump the human who is very limited and should never have received the #GOP nomination in 2016 to begin with. He needs help.

You keep making my point about Trump being a Quisling. Remember Quisling betrayed Norway to Hitler

I doubt she breaks 1.5%
By God, this beats everything, absolutely every crazy thing Trump has ever tweeted does not compare with this one. And to think that people have any worries about Joe Biden. Oh my, this is a first.
Me too, and I agree about the protesters, I think it was Joe Walsh who said prolonged protests would help Trump.   And like you said they're accomplishing nothing at this point. The best protest is on November 3rd.
I'm not sure people really associate this with Biden.  These are scenes from Trump's America.
I think it’s mind-boggling that Joe Biden is the culmination of everything wrong with our political system, but Trump has still somehow found a way to be worse.
We'll see what other polls say.  This one is erratic and has had Trump ahead just a month ago.  I don't think Portland is hurting him though because the many of the protesters aren't innocent as well.

Trump undermines his pandemic response with more misinformation and self-obsessionRemember this PA: Donald Trump let #COVID19 spread unchecked because he thought it’d politically damage Democratic governors like our own.  Now, America leads the world in job losses, illness, and death — because Trump saw political profit in tragedy.
Trump and his trumpers deny that they were ever here(on the lands of the Americas) FIRST.
I know ur not talking about Trump. Plz....
John Lewis funeral...trump acting more  a fool than usual so he's acting out bcz he hates the focus not being him.  It is exhausting. So many of us are so damn tired.
Sarah Burris:  Sen. Inhofe lied to Trump when he said he'd make sure the bill didn't pass, but it already had. Was he just trying to get Trump off the phone?
Sarah Burris:  Sen. Inhofe put Trump on speakerphone while in a restaurant, and someone else recorded the conversation. Trump said he didn't want a bill to pass that changed the names of bases from Confederate names, &amp; it had already passed!
Sarah Burris:  Trump's unpaid bills for police are not official visits--those are paid by taxpayers. He's not paying the bills from his campaign rallies, which do not get paid with taxpayer money.
Sarah:  We're never gonna win the no-mask voters. The cop vote is my favorite b/c Trump has been running all these ads saying Biden wants to defund cop depts. Trump is already defunding police by $2 million that he hasn't paid to police for OT, etc, during his visits
Sarah Burris:I didn't think Trump tried to take away attn from Lewis; I thought it was because he'd heard the GDP numbers dropped so much, I think a 70-yr record. I think he was trying to fight the economic news but his plan backfired--Lewis &amp; economy still made news
Sarah Burris:  Herman Cain traveled to AZ after the Trump rally in OK.  I'm obviously not a huge fan of Herman Cain but this is a prime example that it doesn't matter if you're a friend of the Pres, you could still die from COVID.
Democrats are already pushing Americans into a corner with their Stalinist rules during the pandemic. I just saw an insane Biden tv ad that talked about electing Trump led to the violence when its Democrats involved in the “mostly violent protests”!
Especially if Trump wins again.
the idiot you have on right now who’s defending this POS president is literally every #MAGA idiot out there today the Trump eulogized a guy who didn’t take the Covid virus seriously now he’s dead Trump has blood on his hands #HermanCain #MAGA #idiots
trump, you are without a doubt, one crazy sob, why don't you resign now and save some face
If Trump doesn't want us talking about it, then let's just retweet and retweet!! Ur going down Trump
Your going down Trump, yes you!! U will never do another term.
Good one! Love it!
Pat LaMarche:  I don't know that I would give Trump or any of his rotten kids credit for potentially disenfranchising millions of voters. Remember that recent election that was one be one vote?  It's sooo important that everyone can vote.
Pat LaMarche:  It's laughable Trump thought he could outshine a room with George W. Bush, Obama, Clinton, and Jimmy Carter, and a man who walked across the Pettus Bridge. Even VPs weren't allowed to speak because they didn't make the top tier.
who is this child, and what color has trump called you, and nobody has ever told me i'm not black
Max Burns:  If Trump really cared about protecting us, he'd have filled all the empty gov't positions.
Max Burns:  US intelligence agencies announced that Russian operatives are working to spread COVID propaganda. They can do it b/c under Trump the last 4 yrs, nothing's been done about election security, information security...
Max Burns:  When Trump's back is to the wall, we get press conferences that rewrite reality.
Max Burns:  We see how few Repubs have spoken out about Trump's tweet, even though we know they've seen it. We need governors to commit publicly, in writing, that they will stay true to the Election Day no matter what Trump does.
Max Burns:  Trump has a record of ignoring Supreme Court orders and laws he doesn't like. We need a plan in place to stop him if he tries to move the election anyway.
And of course, the person on the WH team tasked in Trump’s EO with handpicking industries to make winners like Kodak in this totally not socialist 2020 economy, was Jared Kushner’s college roommate.
Max Burns:  It was remarkable to see Trump's press conference today when he said he's done things with the economy that no one has ever done before. I think that's true b/c he'd done nothing. In fact, he wants to cut unemployment pmts to people.
Philanthropists have stepped in to fill the federal government gap and create a large amount of testing we are seeing, the Trump takes credit for but refuses to provide. They were told this    “Despite what we might be hearing, there is nothing being done in the admin on testing”
Max Burns:  Any time you see public criticism of Trump from within the GOP is a big deal. In 2016 after the Access Hollywood video came out, a lot of Repubs jumped ship but voted for him once it was clear he could win the election.
Kushner’s corona testing team in April hired billionaires and bankers, who started to formulate a comprehensive national testing plan. Then trump got soured, Kushner was convinced blue states would be the only ones that suffered. Testing plan forever stopped.
Trump's talking about moving the election today was to distract from the eulogy of a great man. #JohnLewis  #RickShow
No one should be surprised President Obama gave a campaign speech today. Our country’s deep divisions didn’t start when President Trump was elected.
Trump 2020!!! 🇺🇸❤️🤍💙🙏🏻
The commercial showing Biden's America of lawlessness are actually images from Trump's America. 45 is too dumb to realize he's dumb. That's called a clown.
He’s not president. Trump is your president Annette! Enjoy him. He is a gift to you even if you don’t have enough understanding to see it.
Trump &amp; his cronies believed that because Dem States were hit hardest, they could abrogate their responsibility to initiate a federal plan a d they could blame the Dem governors for any shortcomings.   And now we have the SUMMER OF DISASTER

and what do u say about this Trump?? He died this morning of Covid 19. U r a moran!!! U r not fit to run this country!!!
Reupping this as the digging has begun. Trump gave them a loan that was 7x the value of the entire company
It's still a thing, and it's expanding for the coronavirus vaccine specifically. Operation Warp Speed has people thinking it 1) won't be safe when it comes out because of the fast track or 2) will be bad because it comes from a Trump program. Plus the usual anti-vaxxers. No good.
No Trump. He passed away at YOUR rally because he was ignorant and didn’t wear a mask. Herman sacrificed himself for you. And all you got there was one less Trump voter.
tRump murdered Herman Cain.
Sure. Multiple reports out there. As here.
Trump Tower is ‘under siege’ as Chicago Police make arrests to defend the president’s building
Well then, he’s carrying on John Lewis’ legacy of hating on Trump. I guess that’s fitting at Lewis’ funeral.
Trump’s Presidency.
Herman Cain died of COVID-19 today after attending the Trump rally. Let that sink in.
Trump is a fascist and he and his supporters have no right to participate in our society.  We must treat them like the outcasts they are.
Seriously?  So Trump's a paid influencer now?  Wonder what kind of kickback he's getting?
Trump was asked if he was serious about delaying the election, and his answer included taking about the Russia investigation, some BS about “other countries are worse” with Coronavirus, and that absentee ballots are good, and somehow different than voting by mail.
It amazes me and disturbs me so much how this country went from President Obama to now Trump. So sad.
The Trump election troll worked —even on these Republican rubes
Trump's political rallies #DefundThePolice in communities all across the country.
He didn't change his mind because of Trump's latest tweet. There's something else going on here.
Go Trump 2020!!!
You can't support delaying the election. Amendment XX of the Constitution tells us this fact. If you boyfriend tRump thinks otherwise he is a fool. Well that goes beyond saying.
Did Putin tell you you were going to win? You stand up there and cry that the election is going to be rigged. Five minutes later you are tweeting you are going to win.  You are so fucked up tRump.
if trump had his way, he would call the election right now, declare himself the winner and move on, something like putin has done, give himself another ten years
Judge Sullivan is a leftist hack with an ax to grind because General Flynn is a bonafide patriot. This is now beyond persecution &amp; still our side is stuck on zero indictments of the Democrat Party Deep State that was engaged in lying, spying &amp; a coup attempt against Donald Trump.
CNBC/Change Research Poll: Biden 48, Trump 46.
“The Fight,” Elyse Steinberg, Josh Kriegman and Eli Despress’ documentary about the American Civil Liberties Union, opens with the inauguration of Donald Trump.
I’m sorry he is not, but he did choose to go to Tulsa to hear trump without a mask... 😷
Exactly. Trump has ZERO empathy, and cannot feel shame or remorse. He can and will do literally anything to get what he wants. Laws won't stop someone like that. Neither will tradition or morality. People still don't get it. Trump is a sociopath.
Trump broke them.
150k Americans are dead, millions more are unemployed and facing eviction and starvation. And Trump wants to illegally seize power.
Who really wants to hear trump babble after hearing the classic elegance of Barack Obama this afternoon. I don't. I will be tuning out to numnuts at 5:30.
I'm still waiting for all these well educated, empathetic and polite journalists to actually call Trump out on, oh I dunno, ANY of his bullshit of the past 4 years? That'd be nice.
Trump's goal is to create chaos, and pretending he's got the power to move the election, and then just DOING it, will serve that goal well enough. Pay. Attention.
I don't care if it takes until January 2021 to find out the results as long as it means that Trump is being escorted out of "The People's House."
I was imagining Trump running a parallel presidency for his cult for four years or til he gets bored as yet another norm destruction
And they wonder why Trump would not attend.
President Trump, who is trailing in polls, is floating the idea of delaying the election in November. He doesn't have that power. Also, his claim that #VoteByMail leads to inaccurate counts or fraud is false.
Jefferson would have been able to spell Michie and Charlottesville. First clue Trump didn't send tweet is Caligiuri
He death is blood on your hands King Trump
Don’t hold your breath waiting for  to ever disagree publicly with Donald Trump. It could be hazardous to your health.
Pelosi passes every damn thing trump throws at her, but if she became president like the libs are trending, at least a woman would be the one enforcing the decisions. That’s definitely the most important thing.
And Trump shows no remorse for or even awareness of that fact.
Trump could have acknowledged his error on covid-19, apologized and used this as a teachable moment for everyone to wear a mask and follow basic safety protocols for the Coronavirus. But of course, that's not what he did.
Trump actually called a press conference while Obama was scheduled to speak. How lame ass pathetic is that? And yes, the picture is.... awkward.
Miss him too. I have come to realize no party or person is perfect and each party has great leaders. Trump is not one of them.
Apparently trump called an emergency presser right as Obama was scheduled to speak.
What a sad, pathetic vindictive little man. And this maggot is what Republicans believe represents strength of character?
y'all better be making contingency plans for Trump losing in Nov and his refusal to step down.
Cain died a needless death. Had he worn a mask and avoided Trump rallies then odds are he would still be alive.
I'll believe it when the GOP actually does something tangible to stop Trump. Until then the GOP are still the enemy.
I'll believe it when I see them actually fucking DO SOMETHING about stopping Trump. Otherwise my basic assumption regarding the entire Republican party is that they're all traitors.

I just heard that a great patriot Hermann Cain died from COVID-19 &amp; predictably the disgusting DNC mainstream liberal media is trying to politicize this because he attended a Trump political rally. Mr. Cain was an incredible entrepreneur, radio talk show host &amp; an amazing person!
Trump is supposedly concerned about the safety of holding a nationwide election but he insists on everyone going back to school and work? Gotta pick one or the other pal.
Don’t let Donald Trump’s lying tweets distract from cold-hard facts.  🌤 The sky is still blue.  💧 Water is still wet.  🗳 Election Day will still be 11/3.  📬 And you can still vote safely and securely with a mail ballot from

tRump has more tricks in his bag than Felix the Cat
Until  commits to #MedicareForAll I’m writing in  for my presidential vote🤷‍♀️ I’m not interested in Trump Lite
tRump is not that kind of quack...
They'll say "I dislike Trump and this isn't ok" then still vote for him like the cowards they are.
tRump wins another news cycle... Turn off the Looney Tunes. We have an election in 96 days.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a "delay" to November's presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
And Trump tweeted about a different pizza place TODAY. What an asshole.
Lol ok dude. You obsessing over Obama means I “have an intense hatred for Trump”. Whatever makes you feel better about your Obama obsession
Trump and his henchman will try anything to steal the election.
One thing I can say about Charles Manson is that I respect him as a music lover even though I disagree with him politically in every sense of the word. I can NOT say the same for Trump.
Does Liz Warren's plan include a "pretty please" or a "pretty, pretty please" when asking Trump to honor the election results?
31/  Wild Card: As many have noted, the Constitution allows state legislatures to appoint state electors with no input from voters. With 28 Republican-controlled legislatures, representing states with 294 EV, in theory, they could forego voting, and hand Trump reelection.
28/  Some Republican governors who are not likely to blindly follow Trump happen to represent blue states. If MA, VT, and MD held their elections, that would add 24 EVs to the Democratic tally from above, likely enough to put the Democratic candidate over the top.
27/  3) Not all Republican governors are members of Team Trump.  It is unlikely they will take any orders from him.
Republicans aren't going to leave if Trump gets blown out in November.  We're going to have to take it from them.
Maybe they all were tested, since #Trump doesn't think it is necessary for the people on the street, but for him and those around them tests, and fast results.
Its sad seeing you reduced to this level. I hope you at least got a good price for selling your soul to Trump.
Herman Cain almost certainly literally died because of a Trump rally.
Well...unless Trump catches the Coronavirus. Then I think things would get very, very interesting in trumperland.
Trump: covid-19 is getting bad, we should shut down elections! Also Trump: covid-19 isn't a threat, let's send all the kids back to school! Ask the trumpers to reconcile both statements, see what answers you get. Because they both cannot be true at the same time.
24/  Depending on exactly how state law is written, a cancellation/postponement could leave a state without a functioning legislature, major statewide offices, judicial offices, and federal representation. Even in Trump states, would state leaders decide it's worth it?
17/  Beyond that, things get fuzzy, w/50 different states (plus Washington, DC) w/different sets of rules and political situations. There are countless ways this could theoretically play out. However, it's hard to name one that produces the result Trump wants: reelection.
5/  Regardless, postponing the election would not allow Trump to continue as president indefinitely. As so many have noted, per the 20th Amendment, his first term ends on January 20, 2021. So, if he is not duly REELECTED, he would have no further legal claim to power.
The internet is forever kids. FOREVER!
i wouldn't be surprised to learn that trump tapped out a  message to his mother to delay his birth
To any remaining and ever diminishing Trump supporter:  Ask yourself why your president did not go to see Rep. John Lewis casket in Washington.  Ask yourself why your president is not in Atlanta right now at the funeral. /1
Trump is a dickhead yes, but Biden will not pull us out of this economic downfall.
what say you trump, are you thinking of the tulsa rally
This is on purpose. Trump put a sycophant in charge of the post office with the intent of destroying our mail system and stopping people voting by mail.
Just remember how relatable and affable democrats are when you pull that lever for Trump .
One of Trump's lackeys sent that tweet. No way he could spell Guy's last name.
Yup. Even trying to suspend the election would cause massive social, political and economic chaos, all of which Trump can and will use to illegally consolidate power.

Herman Cain dead after attending  Tulsa trump rally with no mask. Keep rolling the dice trumpers. I'm good with my mask
If I am not mistaken congress just gave over $3 T since #Trump took office.Tell me what is right about this?  This money is given to contractors, who charge us taxpayers 10 times what it should cost, and use our money to pay to play.  This has to stop in 2021.  We need Pub funded
Why has none of tRump's "success" taught him any class...?
Is it? He decided to be part of the cult and died as a result of his ignorance and need to worship Trump. Then this same cult wants to send our children to die in schools. Why should we feel bad for him?
So supposedly  died because he was too busy appeasing Trump and his cult to actually seek real medical treatment for #COVID19
This is the Trump economy that him and Republicans have been pushing for and now we’re here. Thanks    You got what you wanted
Lol nah trump and Republicans don’t care about Americans
Trump's stupidly easy path to reelection: 1. Act like a normal human being 2. Send people money 3. Don't make 2020 a referendum on democracy
The cult believes anything trump says. I’ve never seen anything like this outside the Manson family or that Nike death cult
Thanks Trump economy
This is dangerous and undemocratic. Our electoral process gives Americans a voice, and a vote, to hold elected leaders accountable. During this pandemic, mail-in voting is crucial to ensuring that everyone can vote safely.
Pro-Trump youth group TPUSA deleted a tweet mocking protective masks after its co-founder died with the coronavirus
F*** Trump and the political party he rode in on. His suggestion that maybe the election should be delayed is his admission that he's a traitor and must be gotten rid of. In fact, we need to get ride of the whole corrupt gang of Republicans as well.
Stella Immanuel, the doctor in the Trump-endorsed COVID-19 disinformation video, was accused of medical malpractice in a lawsuit after one of her patients died in 2019

VP Mike Pence will head to western PA today to headline a “Cops for Trump” event in Westmoreland County and talk about America’s economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic in an event in Somerset County. Here is the Playbook.
Trump calls for delay to 2020 US election. Uh....that’s a hard fking no
tRump wants to delay the Election... What say you...?
Trump *knows* he's gonna lose. That's why he's gonna claim the election was rigged.
Trump was accused of sexual misconduct 27 times. FYI.
Because UE numbers are SO good under Trump's leadership?😂😂😂
In EVERY SINGLE STATISTIC, we are worst or nearly worst. Every single time Trump has said we’re doing the best — HE LIED!!!!!!
Its ok for the Trump to vote by mail but we the people is a nope. Voter suppression at its best with this tweet.  Donald Trump does want mail in ballots cause he knows he'll lose. So either way fraud is committed will be by Trump &amp; the GOP #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
There, he is expected to reaffirm the administration's stance against movements to defund law enforcement.
Trump is laying the ground work to claim the election is rigged. When he loses, he'll refuse to step down and accuse the Dems of cheating. And that's how our government will fall
I think it won't matter. Trump will lose in a massive blowout, and he will simply declare the election invalid, accuse the Dems of cheating and refuse to step down. The GOP will back him, and the media will claim both 'sides' are equally bad.
Treaty (N): A formally concluded and ratified agreement between countries. IE: Trump wouldn't understand a treaty if it landed in his lap. The 2 percent is a lie. Again.
No, it opens the door to racial segregation. Trump is a racist and so are the trumpers. When they're not hating brown people, they're spreading covid-19 everywhere.Trump votes by mail. And no, you will not change election day.
All this and still he wouldn’t wear a mask or socially distance himself during a pandemic. Sad ending to die for Donald Trump.
In WWI, the Dutch stayed *neutral* so the total number of German soldiers from WWI buried at Ysselsteyn is very very low.   So why did Trump’s Ambassador to the Netherlands decide to visit a cemetery that is almost all dead Nazis?
C. They're just stupid. Trump even once said that he loves the uneducated. They're easy to con and manipulate. Smarter people see through the lies and know the truth. Stupid people cannot. It's really that simple. Intelligent people are against Trump. Unintelligent support him.
Problem is, he’s not done with his corruption. Not sure what Barr and Durham are doing but there are a lot of people including Obama who tried to stop Trump from being President by breaking laws That’s treason. Punishable by death.
Oh he supports it, just because tRump said it.  fRed has no independent thought whatsoever anymore.
Oh it’s the Democrats wanting tax cuts for the rich now somehow, not at all like what the Republicans &amp; Trump already gave them...   sure.
Insincere, racist, &amp; xenophobic all at the same time.  That’s tRump for you.
So sad. The dems are so much more effective and organized than Trump and his group. He has no hope against them.

Trump cannot win by just staying on his golf course
Not getting my hopes up but this trump outburst feels a little different
Patrick is a solid reporter, but in this thread, you can see a clear example of how media can unintentionally add legitimacy to Trump's claims without even realizing it.
It'd be fine for you to say that they've both given different reasons. But you concluded what Trump believes based on what he says. That is not warranted. This is not a minor issue.
And I suspect this may sound like quibbling to you, but there is a huge difference in a respected media figure saying that Trump believes something versus saying that Trump *says* he believes something. These times demand caution.
Important to be cautious in ascribing motives to Trump. Do you really know Trump fears election fraud? Do you take him at his word?
Herman Cain’s family should sue the Trump campaign for reckless endangerment.

Uhm, how to put this for Twitter... “output from the southern end of a northbound cow.”   Trump supports anything that will give him power, keep him in power, or line his pockets, even if he just claimed supporting the exact opposite 15 minutes ago.
Ask him about the economy! Ask trump about Flynn! Ask him when does he plan on doing something about covid other than making money off of it? Ask him why does he lie constantly?
Donald trump is fucking insane. Harassing Governor Brown and now trying to postpone the election. He’s going to try and become dictator.    the tiniest hands, and brain, of all time. Fuck you.
Rephrasing: Herman Cain dies from attending Trump rally.
When interviewing him ask him about his business relationship with foreign governments getting the bulk of u.s. contracts.  Ask him why did he allow and conspire with Trump breaking the laws regarding Ukraine?
....they're the same thing. 🤦‍♂️ I encourage any Trump supporting followers of mine to jump the mental hoops to try and defend this
Take out the money for Trump and big business. Do not touch social security
I think your hopes for humble self-inspection here are charitable but naive. Mr. Turley admits fault the same way Trump does -- meaning that he doesn't.
If you think the majority of GOP politicians will do anything about that, you have not been paying attention the last four years. Even if the election happens and Trump loses, he absolutely will not leave without being forced to. That eventuality must be prepared for.
Thread by  Fascism. Authoritarianism. The question has always been, could it happen here? Because the answer has been NO doeat it will always be so. It is happening here. It is happening right now. Trump crossed the rubicon this morning.…
The GOP has ran a concerted strategy for the last 10 years to gerrymander every state they can. In states that have elected Dem governors, the GOP legislatures have taken away executive powers during lame duck sessions. Make no mistake, Trump will try to delay the election.
I would hope that journalists have realized that the question isn't whether Trump is legally allowed to delay the election. It's whether anything or anyone can or will stop him. What happens if purple states with GOP governors don't participate?
Awful news. Please, everyone, wear your mask  "While it is unclear where Cain contracted the disease, he was among the several thousand people who attended a Trump campaign rally in Tulsa on June 20, most of whom did not wear masks."
Let's adjust that headline: Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain - attended Donald Trump's notorious Tulsa rally WITHOUT a mask and diagnosed with COVID-19 nine days later - DIES.
Cain killed Cain.  Cain had this cavalier mentality long before Trump became a political entity.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
can't believe Donald Trump killed Herman Cain... we live in a truly sick world.
What??? Didn't he just attend that Trump rally??
Herman Cain just died from the COVID he caught at the Trump rally.  Reap what ye sow.  Take Gohmert with you.  I said what I said.
What in the ever loving hell?! Nope. Never.
Wonder why Trump chose to rage tweet this morning about delaying the election? Perhaps to distract from something? 96 days. Let’s keep grinding. No distractions.
#youcantdothat #MailInBallotFraud is #fakenews Trump floats delaying the election, but he can't do that
Although the thought of Trump still getting to be Biden's VP strikes me with a sense of dread so I'm glad some positive things have come out of the two party system. 🤣🤣🤣
and so it begins...
But seriously, if Republicans don't dump Trump after this kind of a stunt, they deserve the every bit of the ridicule they'll get the next time they talk about limited government.

you have done a great job so far in the publics eye. I have an amazing amount of respect for you. However.. what are you going to do about the camo cops Trump has supposedly placed in NYC. I watched a video of someone being arrested by one..

I can’t believe so many people have let themselves get sick and die just to hurt Trump!
Dude the "I'm glad we agree on that so let me ask you this: why do people that are investigating Trump keep getting fired and replaced by your friends?" had me WHEEZING
Strikes me as an extension of Biden’s apparent “just let Trump defeat himself” strategy.   Which isn’t unreasonable.   Like … endorsing legalization when up this far in the polls would be akin to a QB up three TDs throwing the ball deep instead of handing it off.
Because it’s hope. They want death and destruction for all in their efforts to defeat Trump!
So is he voting for trump again?

My Purple Heart/Bronze star veteran father was a Trump supporter.  So much for your ridulous theory.
Joe shouldn’t even debate that idiot. If Biden doesn’t debate him trump will sink even faster!
How much is trump paying you to tweet for him.
Because of all of the polls the Trump campaign and RNC and OAN have released that show Trump winning? Compared to the other polls that show he has a 32% approval on Covid, race relations, find Biden more competent on economy &amp; less senile? Okay, Boomer.
Yet the Trump party is sooooooo moderate! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wonder if Trump's terser answers to questions recently is just a ploy to rob Sarah Cooper of usable material.
People are losing their jobs and healthcare. The Trump family priorities have nothing to do with the well being of the American people.

I actually wrote a whole article about Trump/Hitler comparisons
Remember when he described STD's as his "personal Vietnam"?  Trump administration sending more federal agents to reinforce Portland courthouse
We are always right to question Trump's motives, but have to disagree with you here, in part. This isn't a medical model. It's a public health / health services / health economics question that is not unreasonable for an econ to comment on.
Why don’t you guys just flat out say trump sent the secret police to stir up trouble to make it look like a chaotic event. I believe these same people he has sent in were there to ignite  the situation. That building in Seattle was boarded up weeks ago.
Trump loves the uneducated.
Is the White House going to send him some Trump Cough syrup? #trustthescience #trumpsplan #TrumpsAmerica
But Trump only cares about image and his ego. No one can be a bigger deal. He can’t process that Barr is keeping him safe. Too far gone in dementia.
That’s what happened with Steve Bannon. SNL did the skits with Bannon co trolling Trump and by the end of summer Bannon was gone. This could work.
I love that Scott Baio has another star turn at a Trump convention. The rest one could see coming a mile away. But Scott? Well, that's loyalty for ya.

So Trump’s “impenetrable” border wall collapsed due to a category 1 hurricane? Sounds right.
This show is going to be legit! #MAGA #Trump
Happy 5th anniversary of  warning that Trump might be leading the Republican ticket next year and being met with ... this:
Early in the Kansas City prophetic movement, there’s was a move towards reigning in some of the more outlandish stuff, but those days are gone. It’s like a free for all, and unsurprisingly these charlatans are milking Trump’s chaos for every last penny and oz of fame.
Girl I have no idea if it had solar panels. It’s the fortress to keep out invading murderers and rapists Trump swore Mexico would pay for. USA taxpayers paid and most was stolen by Trump and his cronies given that the wall is thin as paper and covers 10feet on a 3000mile border.
Trump told the Post that he knew he couldn’t win, but he sued anyway. “I spent a couple of bucks on legal fees, and they spent a whole lot more,” Trump said. “I did it to make his life miserable, which I’m happy about.”  That alone should make it SLAPP, &amp; him responsible for cost
I wish trump was a facist
Biden will be able to send in DEA and patrol cities, use the gun registry to go to people’s doors and take their now illegal rifles. Before, that enforcement would have been left to sheriff’s offices. Now, because of Trump &amp; Barr - not so much. See?
This election is going to be 100% about Trump!
Thank you for speaking out now and going on the record that Trump WILL accept the outcome of the election!
So you’re saying people who want gun restrictions, affordable health care, and don’t like the divisive nature of Donald Trump’s tweets should keep fighting their fight?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Trump is a light skinned nigga
Why would Biden do the interview. Trump's was so bad and his daily briefings are such a train wreck there is no need to do your interview. He just needs to let Trump be Trump. #Biden2020
Trump specifically said he won’t necessarily accept the results.

Try to think of it as look at how wonderful America is, coming together to keep each other safe. Let it restore your faith in humanity and how America is a united nation.
I think it is time to give Trump the Noriega treatment...
What was not fun to see were A LOT of Trump/Pence signs. 😒 Seriously, DO NOT underestimate the support he has in rural areas. It’s hard to believe, but it’s true. I rodevtgtu some really rural areas of PA today and the show of support for Trump is really depressing
Sorry, protesters do not have to do cops jobs for them.  The cops are required to treat you appropriately, protesting doesnt change that
Love that beautiful train pic !!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I feel like you could make a very sad, tired, and incoherent argument about why a Trump 2020 hat wasn't racist, in a way that you would fail to be able to do so for anything MAGA.
They’re furious to see how, in only 3 years, Trump accomplished levels of death, open racism, corruption, theft, international humiliation, despotism, and dismantling of vital systems Reagan could never have dreamed of achieving in all 8 years he tried.
Facebook continues to make huge profits from Donald Trump's lying, hateful ads. We can't trust Zuckerberg and #Facebook to fix this. Tell key federal regulators to investigate and act!
Coronavirus ravaged Florida, as Ron DeSantis sidelined scientists and followed Trump - The Washington Post
Trump not acting when this was first known is problem.  Followed by people wanting to ignore safeguards. Other countries were more strict in guidelines, and things cleared up in 2 months. Attitude reflects leadership. Or lack of here
All I see is a bunch of people trying to hold Trump back from taking a massive shit on the Constitution.  Oh yeah... and Robert E. Lee, who himself shat on the Constitution 155 years prior.  What do you see in this picture?
I’m not voting for Biden or Trump. They are both corporate shills.

How about if Trump just stops protecting child sex traffickers and talking about banging 18 year olds?
That just takes me to the Rasmussen page,  not a poll. The only numbers Insee are Trump’s approval Ratings are 48%.
My name’s Donald Trump, and this is jackass
145,000 deaths.  Cities burning.  Trump golfs for the 268th time in his term.
What happened to caring about Christian values and morals?  Since when did it stop mattering if your are a good person? Wouldn’t this behavior make Trump the anti-Christ?
That’s so disgusting!  Where are your Christian values and morals? If this scenario played out it would be a sign Trump was the anti-christ and you don’t care. Sad.
Why doesn’t integrity matter? Where are your Christian values and morality?  Doesn’t this scenario suggest Donald Trump is the anti-christ?
Trump can’t even name a Bible verse. He is fooling you by telling you what you want to hear, which is a message based in hate.
Why does Trump let himself appear so  weak?!? Why doesn’t he release the campaign polls? The RNC polls? OAN’s polling?!?
So the thing about America ... and the philosophy of Trump ... if you don’t like your State, YOU CAN LEAVE!!!!
The best way to combat that would be for the campaign, RNC, and OAN to release their polls that show Trump in the lead!
Didn't the virus come from China? Didn't he close stuff down when Nancy was dancing in the streets? Trump by no means is a biotech engineer or world class virologist that he himself can create such a virus and unleash it on America. Listen to what your saying haha.
I wish God would stop letting these kinds of tapes leak and stop having Trump wish child sex traffickers well. It’s starting to turn my stomach.
Why isn’t trump and Barr and let us not forget Mitch not in jail or at least being subpoenaed?
Much, much better to put all of your faith and devotion into Trump!
$75?!? 40 million unemployed?!? Trump funneling 2 million salaries to Jr’s girlfriend through the campaign?!? 96% approval in the R party?!?   WOAH MAMMA!!!!
Too bad Trump is so weak he’s letting it all happen.

No. Herman Cain is responsible for his own death. It would be nice, and easy, to blame Trump, but Cain was responsible for his own actions.

I'm certain that Trump, Barr, Pompeo, and Miller are having meetings about the viability of attempting some sort of a coup should the election not go in his favor. You can bet on it. Terrifying. #TrumpMustGo #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteJoeBiden2020

BREAKING NEWS
Why didn't Trump's new doctor give Herman the secret cure??
Herman Cain didn't need Trump to kill him. He died of self-inflicted wounds. He was smart enough to know how to protect himself, but he died stupid. Sadly, he inspired many of his followers to be as reckless as he was. How many other people died for Herman's defiance?
He tried to save lives?!!! Seriously?!!! 151,000 American souls dead and counting. Damn, if he can't do a better job of saving lives, then that's a rather lame-ass excuse you're offering! He owns all of this: the virus, economy in the shitter, cities burning. It's all on tRump!
People whine so hard about how we didn't have a federal solution, but we know if Trump came out in March and mandated states do such and such, we'd be getting the "fAScIsT OvERrEa for weeks. He didn't, now they all wish he'd "done something!!!"
This is proof you are Demented. We shut down the economy voluntarily, Hello is anyone home. Leadership of Trump is only thing that has kept the Country from bankruptcy. I forgot you have never had a real job. Life time government payroll baby.
if this has taught us anything, please listen to the health professionals over trump.  Trump is an idiot, through and through.   Medical professionals knows what they are talking about.  Herman's hubris took his life. It's tragic because he could have lived.
😱There is the Constitution!!! Why doesn’t Congress impeach Barr. Why can’t Republicans realize that trump is dismantling our country?  This message is directed  and  and
Herman Cain died of the Coronavirus today. He sat next to Gov Stitt (who has coronavirus) of OK at tRump’s Tulsa rally without a mask. So, I’m guessing that rally was the spreader first these two.
People are acting like Trump killed Herman Cain... and seem to relish the thought.

Changing the date of a federal election would require an act of Congress.   And the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the presidential inauguration.

Yep. Many positive studies out there that are from amazing Dr's. But Trump said it so they are denying it. Shame that wacko Dr said it because she hurt the argument. Dr's have been saying it from the very beginning of the outbreak. Even Fauci in 2005. But Trump said it so.. .

I've taken it for the past 12 years. As did my mother and my father. And my daughter takes it for nerve pain. Not one of us has ever had a side effect. It's a highly used, reliable drug. And CHEAP!! They would rather let people die than admit Trump was right! SICKENS me!

Trump in a nutshell
Trump also said that criticizing the president is illegal. By that logic, when Obama was president and Trump was criticizing him, Trump's actions were then illegal.
Also Trump “we could’ve gotten someone else instead of him for the task force but we didn’t.” Bro who are you going to pick, the second top infectious disease expert in the nation?
Trump: “dr. Fauci works for this administration, and he has a high approval rating, why don’t I have a high approval rating?” Uhhhh cause he’s an infectious disease expert and you’re a...reality star?
The Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Trump failed to follow appropriate procedure when he tried to end DACA, but affirmed his ability to do so.

Protestors in Portland are being treated as criminals and being "proactively" detained, meaning they've done nothing, but Trump wishes Ghislaine Maxwell well and seems to be signaling to her about the possibility of a pardon.  #DemocracyDowntheDrain
It's better than Trump who has not only been credibly accused of raping multiple  children, he has probably done the same to his own daughter. The President elect is going to be a Republican or a Democrat, there is no viable 3rd party, and I sure as hell won't vote Republican.
Dear Mr. President Trump, If the Governors and Mayors don't want you to go in, find a way to get the people out!
The fact that Trump is claiming that eventually he will be right and the virus will just disappear is all the evidence you need to know his Administration has completely given up fighting the Virus.Just gonna leave this here:  Trump 2016: “We're bringing it (the GDP) from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.”
This Ruddy dude gives Trump an A+ for his handling of the Coronavirus. There goes his credibility, he’s drinking the Kool-Aid.
“I’m not very optimistic that we will have any kind of an agreement on a comprehensive bill in the near future."

much to keep the GOP or trump in check. Demand more from our elected officials and stop fighting over the scraps that lawmakers toss us to distract us from the handouts they give to special interests.
Hell yeah! Thank god my license still has my parent's address so they will end one there and i can apply for an absentee at my current address so I can vote for Trump AND Kanye! heck yeah!
I’ve taken to flipping the bird towards every Trump sign I pass. It is an involuntary reflex.
Nice try Shaniqua but Trump said many times he doesn’t like Epstein and banned him back in the day from his resorts
Well said Mr. Schiff! I will stand in line for 20 hours in pouring rain &amp; hail if I have to in order to vote Donald Trump out! There are too many reasons to list #WhyIDontLikeTrump
Now Trump shows his desperation  wants too delay voting this man Satans deciple will stop at nothing
Brent Welder proudly voted for Trump after being a Bernie delegate in 2016
"I wasn't sold on the idea of voting for Joe Biden but then I saw Briahna Joy Gray criticize Donald Trump. Now I'm with Joe all the way!" Said no one ever, idiot.
General McCaffeey is on a roll! And he’s saying Trump is knowingly working for Putin!
Herman Cain Made a Political Statement at His Last Public Appearance Attending a Trump Rally Not Wearing a Mask Surrounded by Like Minded People. 9 Days Later He Tested Positive for Covid-19. About a Month Later He Died from Covid-19. A Political Casualty of Not Wearing a Mask?
Trump is in election trouble, so he's confusing Americans, eroding trust - Business Insider
I'm out of range...  But the armchair psychoanalysis is that a lot of men who'd like to think they're tough see Trump's (and Dubya's frankly) bullying as strength. They'd be nowhere without being assholes. Can't even comprehend kindness or empathy.
I can’t think of anything other than a few texts that were critical of Trump. If the insurance policy was such a seditious plot, what was it? To recruit covert operatives to protect Trump? To stand firml that Flynn’s call was ‘legit’ when Obama asked about it? Say he didn’t lie?
Trump’s housing tweets, explained
Wait, so Pence went to a Cops for Trump event and his motorcade hit two cops? Cause wow.
Sorry for His Loss but it is Relevant that His Last Public Appearance was at a Trump Rally Sitting Close to Others Around Him and NOT Wearing a MASK. 9 Days Later He Tested Positive for Covid-19 &amp; About a Month Later He Died. He Made a Political Choice that May have Cost His Life
Trump’s spirit animal 🦔
Remember that time Herman Cain went to a Trump rally in Tulsa and then was hospitalized with covid 9 days later?
THE REFS. EVERYONE KNOWS THE REFS VOTED TRUMP.
They're more like witnesses. Trump responds to questions, but he doesn't really answer them.
Quickly? What is your definition of quuckly? #maga I don't think so. . how can America trust anything that you say? #TrumpHatesScience Trump can't spell SCIANCE CORRECTLY?
If any American is not pissed off by Trump's behavior, they aren't paying attention. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Um. If you are “Christian” and you support this, please revisit your Bible. And President Trump, you may want to revisit the role of the government. If you can’t be “bothered” by poor people, you are in the wrong business.
Think about this for a second, your options are Donald trump, joe Biden,  jo Jorgensen, and Kanye west.
Small Towns + Little Use of Masks During a Pandemic = Must be Trump Supporter 🤦🏻‍♂️
And no, Flynn and Page weren’t spying on Trump, their goal was likely to protect Trump from bad actors looking to frame him in the Russia scandal they were already planning.  I wonder what the codename for the op would be. It sounds like Lisa thought Lattitude was appropriate.
It is literally Donald Trump's America.  Joe Biden isn't President yet.  You are describing something that is happening on TRUMP'S watch.
Here’s a list of the Trump Charges:
Should I blame trump for the national guard called up by my democratic governor? And shoot at me in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia?
So Trump is funneling campaign donations to his own pocket by charging  individual small $1000-$3000 charges to the Trump Hotel Washington. Then his “business” that he never divested in cashes in. So he benefits illegally through emoluments! #TrumpisaGrifter
Forgot about IA. Yes, trump is leading (barely) in IA and GA, but losing (barely) in TX.
So now it’s all trump fault the virus is here? Dude, are you high?
When did he make this decision?  My friend is now voting for Trump because of all the riots.
If Donald Trump gets to vote-by-mail, then so do the rest of us.
But he's leading in all of them (except Georgia, which is back-and-forth). And AZ is starting to pull away. As i said, it's possible trump wins all of them, but not statistically likely at this point.
Ummmm, we already have it... it’s called hydroxychloroquine.  Fauci is a LIAR and Trump is being had by this hack!  Why doesn’t Fauci sit and talk with Dr Harvey A Risch? He is more qualified than Fauci to talk about this Disease! Fauci’s ego is WAY to big and needs to be checked
Oh, but they spied on the Trump admin you, right?  Sure, they spied on Flynn and Carter Page, because both of them were working as CHS and the FISAs were to collect evidence. How were they both aware of their FISAs?  Expand your thinking.  You have more than you know.
The Trump wall was never intended to keep others out. Oh no sir!
Highly recommend this Some More News breaking down the problem with the Lincoln Project. Sure, it would be great if their ads turn some moderate Republicans away from voting Trump in November - but not at the cost of allowing these people influence over the Democratic Party.
Site one valid source. I believe all politicians are corrupt, however Trump is using disenfranchised white men to further his need to valid himself to make others feel marginalized. I really can't stand a bully.
Hate to break it your paranoid self but the coronavirus doesn’t care what Party you are from. Celebrities, politicians on both sides, poor, rich - everyone can get it.       If you want to blame someone, blame Trump! He didn’tallow masks!
Wow. Trump makes a dumb tweet. What else is new. Use your Brian moderate, trump can’t delay the election. It’s not up to him. Read the constitution.
The lines are drawn       Republicans will forever hate Obama and Democrats will forever hate Trump      There is no changing that so  there will never be unity     America      Devided forever   Just the way it is

Or vote out commie Billy... there is treatment: HCQ!  Billy low-level illrelevant  dem doing his part to try to defeat Trump, even if that means letting people die and businesses being destroyed!
Why is it so hard for people to believe that Donald Trump can walk and crap his pants at the same time?
Trump is a snake, I'm pretty sure that he had been advised specifically to play dumb about COVID for the purpose of getting himself in a situation where he'll just get re-elected by default.
Stop giving billions of money to reconstruction of FBI building so increases trump’s property value and more money to the real workers of United States!
Trump was bad in 2016 also. And yet he still won. And what are democrats doing to oppose him? Not a damn thing.
PREPARE TO RISE UP, AMERICA!!! Donald Trump Tweeted His Desire to "DELAY...  via

Trump is the Kool-Aid man. And people love the sweetness of that good good Kool-Aid.
I'm pretty sure that he knows a few more very wealthy &amp; very powerful people than I do.  I honestly don't know what he can do. At the very least, he has a big platform. I know it's customary to not criticize Presidents after you, but NOTHING about trump is customary: criticize!
Don’t worry the left will somehow use their amazing powers of deduction to come to the conclusion it was trump
NO. That is the attitude of the GOP in Washington. tRUMP is breaking laws one after the other and they do NOTHING!  he SHOULD have been removed from office YEARS ago!
Because we, the intelligent who are appalled at Trump, might want to go there and start over
EXCEPT - the person who STARTED the violence is a white supremacist KKK member! Probably paid by tRUMP's cohorts to start trouble....wouldn't put it past them!
Yep. The one who actually shows up. Hint: not trump
You’d wish or they would be laughing on trump if the democrats thinks they are winning 🤔
That’s right for Trump
i hate donald trump
Trump makes history again
Neal, The Lincoln Project is a bunch of people whose policies led us to Trump trying to establish a foothold in the Democratic Party by ingratiating themselves with people just like you. Be wary. Their ad buys are targeting you, not swing voters.
Wow you are flying on your presidential jet while you deny that you didn’t get the briefing about Russians supplying the Taliban with weapons to kill! our American troops. God bless their souls. Another way for Trump to distract Americans.
Ummm trump bad. Lol.
Love how you will blame Trump for Hermans death but won't question your brother about all of the lives lost  he is responsible for.
- Trump,  summarizes what you said quite well. Simply put you are one dumb fucker
Heard “For What It’s Worth” this morning on the way to work.   It’s still powerful.   It DEFINITELY resonates in today’s world.   The  campaign should figure out a way to license it for a spot under images of the unrest Trump has literally celebrated the last four years.
When people took Trump seriously as a candidate. And Fox News and talk radio just fell in line behind him. The party left me. #UsedToBeGOP
It wasn’t clear if the nomination for retired Army Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata would be withdrawn.
You killed Herman Cain with one of your lousy death rallies trump.
I think you’re beginning to understand now James, it sounded like an anti-Trump speech to you because Mr. Lewis stood for all that is good.
Your tweet proves his point.  America has a massive case of Trump Fatigue.  A "sleepy" President is the calming salve that everyone wants.
So what he was at rally how do u no he didn’t have it before he got there did he have a mask on stop blaming Trump it’s guys like u that start lies
Did Cain take Remdesivir or that hocus pocus that Trump is pushing?
- Trump, Bernie just burned you!
Pence after working 4 yrs with Trump
I hope this means that his law and order ads instilling fear in the hearts and minds of Americans are ineffective.
TRUMP IS NOT AN IMMUNOLOGIST. I repeat, TRUMP IS NOT AN IMMUNOLOGIST. (He is a repeated business failure.)
So if you're a Trump* supporter you no longer have Football Baseball Basketball I guess you'll have to watch the grass grow on the golf channel while Ted Nugent tunes play in the background.   #BlackLivesMatter
Tony, your membership in a cult that worships the anonymous Q and the scurrilous trump ended your discussion with God a good bit ago. He’s waiting for your apology and repentance.
trump’s a joke, hard to parody a joke
I blame all of this on the tea party. They were the  first wave of what was to become a full on assault of our republic. They created the breach that allowed Trump to become POTUS. They are the disease, Trump is the symptom.
And how many lawsuits have been brought against Biden for being a pedophile? None. Trump? 4.
is 100% right! The choice is 100% clear! It's anyone but Trump.  It's   It's a return to compassion.  It's a return to a better government. It's about respect for our laws. It's about taking #COVID seriously.
Fuck that shit! Trump needs a one way ticket to Rikers Island
A. It is extremely small time compared to Trump's transgressions in this area.   Both in $ amount and in impact.  B. The corrupt actions of 1/435 of our House of Representatives are infinitesimally small compared the corrupt actions of the President of the United States.
Why is it that you feel Trump has been a good president?
Putin, Trump's boss, would approve.
I’m in suburban Pittsburgh and I see neighbors that switch between Biden signs and Trump signs and I just think “that block party is gonna be lit!”!🤣
Yes     It’s definitely a mess     And evil is all around us
Trump and his kids were found guilty in a civil suit. You know that.
Sadly, in his second term Obama squandered his opportunity to continue his unifying efforts.  Instead, he became a divisive force.  Trump was elected only because middle America held their noses and elected him to prevent the election of Hillary Clinton, an Obama surrogate.
- Trump, is this part of your badge of honor or just an ignorant ass? You do shit like this and you think you should be President? Deadbeat Disgrace!
I love these statements. Jared and Ivanka have made at least 200-300 million dollars from daddy since trump became president. Trump found a way to give millions upon millions of tax payers money to the kiddees. Wait till you see the national debt after he is out of office.
He exonerates himself and Donald Trump. How fortuitous.
Who will you be sinking your claws into after Trump loses and Jr goes back to living under a bridge?

There was a crime, as the court ruled against the Trump's. His salary is a pittance in comparison to all the MILLIONS he has pocketed at his golf courses, hotels and resorts as taxpayer dollars cover his entourage and Secret Service details stay there, eat there, drink there.
Donald Trump must be bummed.
- Trump, did you see this? He smoked your ass!!!
So I guess the point of this article is that this guy is just as big as a MORON as Trump. Who votes theese idiots in office?!?
When I first saw Trump Derangement Syndrome, I honestly thought it was used towards his followers. It makes more sense for describing the cult like mentality. But I digress 🤷🏻‍♀️#cult45
Letitia James just said the silliest thing.   She’s sure that Trump will accept the results of the 2020 election.   Where does that surety come from?  It couldn’t possibly be from Trump’s (or the GOP’s) exemplary record of following our constitution and norms. #Maddow
President Trump—please use your power to make these shenanigans stop. By whatever means, please. I pray for you all of the time. Please use whatever force you need to make this stop.
“cops for trump” has a such a skeevy ring to it
This truly looks like an effort by Trump to do whatever he can to keep Biden from winning.   #Alarming  Postal Service backlog sparks worries that ballot delivery could be delayed in November
I'm not embarrassed by this. It's a trump quote. You may be embarrassed by it because he's talking about your party, but not me. I knew he was a grifter way before he got elected.
How often is Trump in church? Hypocrite.
Well it is a right wing Christian death cult. This life is just a rehearsal for some glorious afterlife where no one gets the boot down to, for many, a well deserved Hell. How could you take your life that seriously and follow Donald Trump? He certainly doesn't believe in Jesus.
And the Trump administration is doing all it can to destroy it.
Two weeks has been Trump code for never his entire presidency.
Down just under 10% for the quarter, which was expected. Many businesses were closed during 2Q. Heavy price to pay to flatten the curve. CDC published guidelines to open safely. Then Trump squandered it all, pressuring Govs to open and idiotic "liberate the states" tweets. Sad.
You're the out of touch and uninformed Trump "radical." You do have that Laura Ingraham crazy-train thing going on for you. Well played.
How stupid can libtards be? Trump had no chance in 2016? Wtf happened? The same shit is going to happen again 😂

John Lewis said President Trump was an illegitimate President and refused to go to his inauguration! So it would have been hypocritical of Trump to go to his funeral!
To echo  thoughts, Trump is uniquely terrible but all three of these guys were also horrendous.
Deserve??? Oh, we definitely deserve trump. But i pray we don't get what we deserve.
- Trump, where were you? I know tweeting! You are a worldwide disgrace
How's Trump's butt taste?
It sure has never been clearer. Trump is basically George W. Bush the sequel. At least it took Bush two terms of incompetence to tank the country. Trump took incompetence to a new level and equaled Bush's damage in less than one term.
Thoughts on Donald Trump's election thought today?
Sadly, I think this is all part of Trump’s demonic plan to stay in office
Trump was impeached Tucker. 🙄
- Trump, so Herman Cain was a close friend of yours. May he Rest In Peace. Sad part is he attended your Tulsa rally, following your lead, chose not to wear a mask. Contracted Covid that ultimately took his life. Is that China’s fault? Your Fault!!!
Trump Shut Down Traffic Only from China After 200,000 Chinese &amp; Travelers had Already Come in From China. Europeans &amp; Americans in the EU Came in When We Didn't Know it was Asymptomatic. Most of that was Nobodies Fault. It is a Novel"New"Virus. What Happened After Was the Problem
Feels like we've already been waiting 10 years for Trump to go.

That was the 1st Feench Study that was Later Retracted as Untrue. All Studies Since have said it is Not Effective. If it Worked Why Wouldn't People All Over the World take Hydroxychloroquine that is So Cheap &amp; Readily Avaliable? Did Herman Cain take it as a Close Friend of Trump?
I so badly hope Trump Retweets this thinking it is a supporter video.
He went knee deep on trump
I agree, take away Barr. Yes trump may find another moron but it will take time and some Republicans may not be so quick to make another mistake like they did with Barr. It could help save our rule of law from completely crumbling and stop some of trumps corruption
Vote Trump 2020 or do you want more jobs going to Communist China? Even Dented Joe is voting Trump.. see:
You are uninformed. PPD and Feds escalated peaceful protests from the start.   Parroting #GestapoTrump doesn’t make you sound edgy or smart, it makes you sound like the useful idiot Trump thinks you are.
JUST THINK IF TRUMP NEVER BECAME PRESIDENT WE WOULDNT HAVE EVEN KNOWN WE HAD BEEN SLAVES ALL ALONG..NOW WE KNOW THEY ARE JUST A RICH GROUP OF SLAVE OWNERS THAT HAVE BEEN USING US FOR MANY YEARS
I just want to hear what she'd have done different if she were Trump, we need solutions not fingers being pointed.
remember when the House impeached Trump? feels like a decade ago.
Honestly for real. All politicians are liars. However I would vote for my spider plant or my asshole cat over trump. Im fairly certain Sprinkle cat would bite Vladimir Putin just because he can.
He should be charged for treason. I was critical of Obama, and Bush Jr. But those two look like paragons compared to Trump.
It was the the dirty cops in MSP that have a nasty habit of murdering unarmed people in handcuffs that sparked protest.  Quit projecting. Unless you’re actually admitting trump is a White Supremacist.  Which is who started the riots here in town.
Ha ha, that’s good! I was 🤔   “Hey #resistance, I’m 6 followers away from 300 but I want more so I can share w/my #resister buddies why I think Trump is a fuckstick &amp; we can ride the blue 🌊 to #Biden2020 ville together!”  What ya 💭? Snazzy?   This is considered profile pic

The good news is that there have been several high profile republicans publicly saying  they’ll have absolutely no part in this. But of course, the fact that our president would raise this at all is still unsettling.
Any comment about trump suggesting delaying the election?  Admitting he hates the US and just wants to be totalitarian dictator.  If you're still supporting trump, you are the problem. #AmericaOrTrump

He is just stating the obvious. Trump is reckless, and any man, black or white, or named Jack can be a victim.
I’m not a journalism expert or anything, but “Herman Cain Dies After Catching Covid at Trump Rally” kinda seems like a bigger story than it’s been...
Can’t wait to gloat over the mansplainers when Trump loses the election but stays in power
You have no basis of saying Obama was corrupt. You may not like this policies and wish Trump dismantles them all, this is fine with me. I do not like some of Obama's policies. But attacking him personally, you sir are no gentlemen.

Theoretically, social media is a private enterprise, and therefore is not protected speech. On a public forum, it would be protected. That said, I doubt Twitter is concerned about Jen's tweets. They're busy with Trump's.

I already know what you’ll say.. “this is an opinion piece”.. it’s not.. it has to be called that bc it’s told from the first person. However it’s a personal testimony to the fact that Trump did not disband that office &amp; this talking point is a lie.
He’s going to say whatever he has to because if trump looses he knows his ass is on the line
For sure no! Biden is a statesman. He wasn’t my first choice, but I’d vote for my 4 year old nephew b4 voting for trump, so, there’s that! Biden will allow the nation to take a breath and nerves to settle a moment while we think as a nation about real changes we need to make.
This bears watching, don't believe anything coming out of trump or this administration.
No, Trump is his own God. But Pompeo is one different animal altogether. 💙🌷
We know  is not a very smart guy, so I guess it shouldn’t be surprising how uneducated his followers are. It’s hard to believe people actually talk that way, and cannot spell such simple words. Then again if they were smart they would not be supporting trump.
The only way President Trump will be voted out is if the Democrats rig the election!
As I recall he’s done a fair amount of Trump-enabling over the years.  I knew back in 1989 with Trump’s racist ad-buys that he was a rotten person not worth our time
Trump is a rat in a corner and that rodent is very dangerous. He’ll have no limits.
remember when Kamala kept asking candidates to join her pledge to kick trump off Twitter, what the hell is with the Dems and this website
Wow. I looked early today and Trump was getting his ass kicked. And looky what happened. Looks kinda like 2016, and what is coming in November.
What happened in #Texas could happen to you. People were voting straight Democratic ticket. When they pressed enter the entire screen changed to Ted Cruz &amp; GOP    He was Installed just like Trump

This could lead to state legislators making decisions on who won in order to certify results &amp; seat electors in time. Many swing states (like mine...PA) have GOP state legislatures that could decide, in interest of time, to decide in favor of Trump

Trump is presently being advised by people who aren’t going to go public before he presents us with an amazingly stupid October surprise.
All while trump talks about how he wants to have sex with his daughter....
trump thinks covid is fake until it comes to the election that he’s scared of losing lMaO
Ran out of chars. But if there end up being debates. Oh boy. 🤒. Basically I’m saying lots of time till Election Day. And I think trump will still get the win.
I hope so! I cant say for certain how it will go because I don't Trust the polls, especially after 2016,  but I do see the amount of people who are outraged by Trump. So I'm hoping the people who didn't vote in 2016 because they didn't want Hillary, actually vote this time!!
Trump killed Herman Cain.
To be honest, I conflated two arguments I was having. I didn’t mean to call you a Trump apologist. Sorry.
The national polls were correct.  The states that allowed Trump to with were still within the margin of error.  That being said, people on both sides should vote regardless of what polls say.
Sorry to interject, but you can "not think it is" until the cows come home, but it doesn't change a thing. Pence is Anti-LGBTQ. As is trump, and most of the GOP. Google it.
Trump broke her along time ago.
Foreign concept these days, actually. You can approve of things people have done *gasp* while also feeling that they can improve some things. My disapproval does not imply that I’m part of your Trump 2020 cult ✌🏽
Trump could personally cure Covid-19, turn water into wine and walk on water between now and November and I’d still vote #Biden2020
How about respect for those who do wear them, instead of saying  we "fell for the lie," "want to embarrass Trump" or " are running scared?"
Demon sperm tweeted it not Trump 🐘🗳🇺🇸
Trump is going to tell people there's a serious voter fraud problem until a voter fraud problem is created. It doesn't exist. Ignore every word he says. EVERY WORD.
Yep Trump put covid patients into nursing homes.  Stupid comment
Polling gave Clinton a 3-point lead in Michigan, 2 points in Pennsylvania and showed Trump narrowly winning Florida. Only Wisconsin was wildly off at 6½ points.  Biden has an 8-point lead in MI, 7 in FL, and 6 in PA. Trump has no room to maneuver.
Fact. Mr. TRUMP

I so excited keep up the good work my son is a Trump vote my Union Dem husband Trump vote my 25 yr old daughter mad at me but definitely Trump my youngest 20 year old daughter not Biden for sure just need to move her a little bit more
We (the sane voters in America) have been  stating that Trump is not  a legitimate president, but rather a Russian shill. Still, we have been stuck with his idiocy since Russia and fools put him in office.
Trump wants to delay the election but send 6 year olds back to kindergarten I cannot deal with this moldy cheeto anymore
Affordable care act called Obama care. Doesn't that sound better then the Trump virus that's right Trump u own it.
See this is the BS I'm talking about, this is in the Dems package and yet trump comes out and lie saying the Dems don't want to pass nothing it's in they're package not the repubs.
Trump's staff thought up a plan to get the headlines off of -32% GDP and the press took it hook, line, and sinker  The only people more gullible than Trump and his cronies are the press that are supposed to be holding him accountable

I was poor under trump, poor under Obama. Poor under bush, poor under Clinton. Yep I have nothing to gain in this election.
I used to say they should have issued “W” a Dunce Cap!  I owe him an apology.  I’d take him over Trump any day.
"President Trump needs to be told by every Republican in Congress that he cannot postpone the federal election. Doing so would be illegal, unconstitutional and without precedent in American history. Anyone who says otherwise should never be elected to Congress again."
So. Let's do it again. #ImpeachTrumpAgain  Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Trump thinks he’s going to lose, so he like a true narcissist is going to burn everything down on his way out. Buckle up! #trumppresser
No, he’s more stupid than a fence post. Though, Peter Navarro disagrees with me. He said Trump is one of the smartest people he knows.
Couldn’t be respectful during his comments for Lewis and had to slam his successor President Trump. Obama as a lying, cheating,spying President is a “Fargin Bastish.”
Trump. Is. A. Adderall. Addict.
Time for the rallies to become anti trump rallies
Trump meets with family of Vanessa Guillen and pledges to help
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE IN PA.: The vice president made a campaign stop in western Pennsylvania today. Watch what he had to say during a "Cops For Trump" rally on CBSN Pittsburgh.
It explains how Trump was elected.
Since when is it a Federal responsibility to pay the salaries of local police????? It’s your job as the Mayor of Pittsbugh to be fiscally responsible with tax payer dollars to provide public safety service. Not the Federal Government ie Trump. DO YOUR JOB
I've always wanted to wear goggles lmao 😭 jp
By finding someone with full mental capacity that's not propped up, Weekend at Bernie's style, talking some unintelligible nonsense. I'm not a Trump fan by any means, but at least he makes sense 12% of the time.
A great honor to join Vice President  and our great law enforcement officers at the “Cops for Trump” rally today! BACK THE BLUE!
Everything      Including today when they parade Hussein out to campaign at the funeral  and then later a bunch of leftists blame our President for Herman Cain’s death  The whole 150000 deaths blamed on Trump is super annoying    I also can’t stand the riots
Guess you don’t listen to Trump or follow him on Twitter then.
This seems to be routine procedure in the Trump Administration, to forget which side of the fence you work for. You visiting SS graves and Trump allowing bounties on our troops by 🇷🇺 going unpunished.
You are confusing Biden landslide with trump poopslide
VP Pence drew a crowd in Greensburg today of supporters including plenty of current and retired police from around the county:    For  w/  and   photos
Ah yes, because as we all know, Trump would NEVER violate the Constitution for his own personal benefit 🙄🙄
How is trump a dictator?
Trump just suggested we delay the election... my nigga... WHAT?! 😂
Fact-checking Trump's continued assault on mail-in voting and suggestions of delaying the election
Obama made his money on book sales.  Trump and his kids robbed the "charitable" Trump Foundation to help fund his campaign. "Mistakes"? Hardly. His kids are now banned from running a non-profit for their crimes.
Your projecting like trump! That bill has been on your desk for 10 weeks! Stop giving money to trump’s wish list and help struggling Americans! Republicans kept quiet instead of calling trump out on the seriousness of this pandemic! You are responsible for every death too.
I hate to say it, but this is just east of me, and yes...it is Trump country. Many rural areas are, even in Bluish states. This November the urban areas  will be blue, the rural red. Key will be the burbs...a lot of red in 2016 but could easily go blue in November.
cant wait for trump’s tweet about the NBA
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Trump's crazy as h***.
I voted for Perot twice over Clinton, so nice try.    Obama? 11.5 million jobs created, Great Recession ended.  Trump? 8 million jobs lost in his term.  2nd Great Recession started.  Any questions?
This is great! I wondered what would happen.  A bunch of guys who probably never negotiated a contract in their lives tried to manaplain that such a scenario would not happen or that it would be the Pens because playoff games trump reg season Pirates games.
‘Something That Dictators Do’: Pittsburgh Mayor Peduto R..
He mispronounced the Trump virus.
The only person who will try to make this a crooked election is Donald J. Trump.
Breaking news, the Post Master general a heavy trump donor and supporter slowing mail services down, yea y'all get to the polls there's more than one way to skin a fat lying rat.. GO VOTE!!
Reading the article, they referred to Trump relying on feckless Governors in the House of Representatives  to keep him in. So they lost me.
Hell ya!!! I MUST be able to VOTE on time.        ....I HATE TRUMP... !!!!
When's Trump's beautiful new health care plan being unveiled?
It isn't fascism if Trump has a 95% chance of losing in November.  Hitler and Mussolini never worried about being reelected.
He's also told to stay in office by his boss, Putin. I bet he's afraid he'll be killed if he loses the election.  Putin put millions of dollars into making Trump president
You are the most egotistical of wind on Twitter. Except maybe for Donald J Trump
Wow! He got this presumably from Trump's Tulsa rally. He was there, maskless with no social distancing. He got sick and tested covid-19 positive. Now he has died. This is on Trump &amp; the stupidity that is the GOP!
He makes me very uncomfortable.
Why do "some' people I follow who are supposed to be conservatives and for Pres. Trump liking liberals tweets that are negative remarks towards the President? #fakeConservatives
I am unsure how Biden got a reputation as a more decent person than Trump: there's sniffing, mass plagiarism, segregation/Confederate support, and name calling supporters. He's quoted Mao + Muhammads call to Jihad.   There's the Tara Reade issue as well. Just vote policy, lol.
what did you do to your face? Bwahahahahahaha  and you paid for that? Bwahahahahaha
It was the a Trump Virus.
Why is Ari even talking about Trump moving the election,  we know he can't.  So talk about the economy or the stimulus package.  Falling down on the job lately,  Ari. Get with the program
Never, because everyone knows I’ll vote for Trump. As a matter of fact the way the Democrats, I’ve decided to do what Dems do when they vote. That is they walk in and pull the ‘D’ lever, only I’ll pull the Republican lever
Herman Cain is responsible for his own death by stupidity, but Trump helped... I wish we knew how many more died from that cult rally...
Yes!!  Move it up .  Why wait?  Let’s get it over with.  Maybe Air Force One’s last Trump trip will be one way to Moscow.
Trump is disgusting, still lying about everything , with covid19 and he knows it's a real recession is going down but touting fake job numbers like there's no bottom for trump.
No he’s not. He has no plan. He has hyperbole and lies. Also, I don’t remember China making trump not do anything during the 1st 2 months of the year. I don’t remember China make him screw up testing. I don’t remember China say we had 15 cases and we’ll be down to zero soon.
I’ve never witnessed any man being so insanely jealous of another man as trump is with Obama! It’s just weird!
Everything trump said about the stimulus was a lie none of that BS he was saying wasn't even in the repubs package, fact checking is key with this lying a** dude and a shame that fact checking has to even take place, the Dems are the ones working for the entire republic.
Be sure to download the latest episode of #PittsburghExplainer with  Friday morning. On tomorrow's show: PPS weighs its options, Trump's white base shrinks in Pennsylvania and local activists face charges related to recent protests.
Trump just said that mail in votes are immensely fraudulent. THAT FULLY EXPLAINS  2016 ELECTION RESULTS: The total number of voters who voted early, absentee or by mail more than doubled from 24.9 million in 2004 to 57.2 million in 2016. "Step Down asshat!"
He was better, way better than trump
Trump is incompetent but this is ridiculous: not a *single* word about nonstop protests, despite biggest jump occurring among youth and minorities who disproportionately attend protests. Mentioning state failures in passing, despite them having police powers. Deflection &amp; spin.
Yo Trump literally avoids answering any question directly
“Courthouses are psychologically important,” said Trump on national television.   😳
I believe in Jesus Christ as well and I cannot believe that Jesus, alive today, would vote for trump.
Remember, every time Trump says “our country” he means himself.
TRUMP IS LYING AGAIN RE: xMAIL-IN BALLOTS!    I AM JUDGE OF ELECTIONS IN PENNSYLVANIA, I CAN  TELL YOU MAIL IN BALLOTS HAVE TO BE REQUESTED JUST LIKE ABSENTEE!   TRUMP IS LYING BECAUSE HE IS TRYING TO CAST DOUBT ON THE ELECTION.    PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VOTING BY MAIL FOR YEARS !
And the virus is trump!!!!
How much did the Trump kids steal from kids with cancer? How much have Trump businesses been paid out of his campaign funds?
Remember that time when everyone wanted Trump impeached and he got impeached but nothing happened after that lol
Or trump
Trump is in trouble. Lol

#WesternPennsylvania   What about Western PA? Ain’t nobody trying to rig the elections but Trump.
Come hell or high water, I will be there - voting him OUT.  #SomeoneElse2020
Trump doesn’t understand...no difference between absentee and mail in. None.   I voted by mail. I had to fill out an extensive application. I’m in WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. He’s setting this up bc he’s going to lose.
Herman Cain became useless to Trump when he died. A cold calculation, he moves on, without empathy; a classic sociopath.
Trump can't put a bandaid on Obama...it was so wonderful to see and hear REAL Presidents!  Trump Fake President...reality tv star...person, woman, man, camera, tv...
before trump this was the only kind of content that white american men in college were allowed to post on the internet
“I’m a capitalist so I voted for Trump for economic reasons” people where u at
Send Trump your money 💰  He needs it  and wants it.  $$$$
Trump is the Doula!
I can't keep up. 🥵 One second, Trump says it's going to be a "rigged election against him". Then, it's going to be a "postponed election". Next, Trump says he is going to "win the election, BIG". Couple seconds later, we are back at square one..."a rigged election". Help! SOS!
trump keeps saying it could take “years” to correctly count the votes and find out who actually won the election
Trump is spouting bullshit right now in his COVID "press conference" about mail-in voting -- pretending it is different from absentee -- but it works with his voters because they don't know any better.
There are going to be graduate school classes on how we went from Obama to Trump. “PolSci 401: WTF Happened?”
That’s funny! Thanks for the smile little buckaroo! Your conflating sophisticated attacks designed to turn unwitting voters to act or from critical information and public policies. Those will effect voter turnout and election outcome to hurt Dems 🆚 jokes on Trump being a baffion
trump lies
Listening to this beautiful anthem during one of trump’s boring infuriating Corona virus sessions gives one a sense of calmness and resolve.
Walsh on Trump tweet: I don't give a damn if he's joking, he said it - CNN Video
So... I was just thinking... Why are we Americans not getting access to the faster testing that tRump is? Why do we have to wait 7-10 days? Why isn't Congress demanding it for us?🤔
Trump looks weak and defeated.  He sounds desperate.  He is weak, desperate, &amp; defeated.  #WeWillVote
Could it even be possible for #Trump to pick a new VP the second time around?
Trump can’t even read so who is he to tell kids to value education?
Biden played a big role in creating the conditions that created Trump, I don’t understand how repeating that mistake will get us a different result.
He literally said “idk if trump will last four years” and this is apparently a death threat
Yep. Donald trump created a virus is a lab in China and released it into the air. Dude STFU.  Trump suspended evictions. More than Obama did. Trump suspended school loan payments. More than Obama did
Trump 2020
so you like trump reducing medicine prices? or is orange man still bad
Expect to see lots of this between now and November. Those who have stood by Trump despite everything else will hedge their bets to try to seem like the adults in the room if he loses. They’ll walk it back if he wins.
A have a headache from listening to Trump’s miserable attempt to read aloud.
Trump looks and sounds awful. Maybe it's because I watched President Obama's eulogy a few hours ago. The difference is astounding.
I'm waiting for Trump to start naming Star Trek drugs.  Neurozine Triptacederine Hydrocortilene  Someone should just slip them in his script he is badly reading.
Dozens gathered Thursday morning in Westmoreland for a Black Lives Matter rally just around the corner from a Cops for Trump coalition, which was assembled to support Vice President Mike Pence.
I call bullshit. They are finished using Trump up. He has served his purpose. This long con is over.

Listening to Trump attempt to read aloud.   My God. It’s a disgrace that this dunce was given power.   #TrumpMeltdown
I was thinking exactly this. He seemingly agrees with umpteen previous fascistic statements and/or actions from Trump, but THIS is where he found his fainting couch? I'll take all the support we can get, but come the fuck on Calabresi.
He will come around to Trump’s way of thinking. They always do.

... and what do you have to say about Trump floating his 'delay the election' tweet???
Another Trump Bankruptcy
Had no idea trump was a necrophiliac
One would think SOMEBODY would teach trump how to pronounce words before going on stage. #notmypresident
Trump cannot pronounce plasma
It’s painful to watch Trump attempt to read. Good Lord.
And 2 officers were hurt in this  police rally for trump/pence.  Who paid  taxpayer you know  trump/pence ain't.
His best campaign tactic is to let Trump keep opening his mouth.  Or do you believe in the demon sperm "doctor" too,  #CoronaLaura?
Unfortunately hydroxychloroquine ban is because the Boomers voting for Trump
I’m sorry that #HermanCain has lost his life from #COVID19 but glad that there will be one less vote for #Trump.
Is  correct, and they've milked Trump for all they can get and now want to 'save the Senate'?
Trump is back on doing his ridiculous briefing. Had to turn it off, he is trying to read. He cannot read, so boring! Someone please tell  he is a joke! BORING!
Everyone is not coming out n ukno the Dems are going to be crying when Trump wins again n they will be tearing the country apart again for 4 more years instead of doing what is right by the American people. N when most of them get replaced they will cry more smmfh need tissues?
After you read Mary Trump's book, every time you see her ipso nutso uncle on TV you just sort of shake your head (more than before).
Trump's packed the Courts and since they have no further use for him and can see that he's going to lose. they want Pence to run against Biden.
"President Trump is desperate and alone. I set the odds at 1-in-3 that he drops out of the election before the Republican convention at the end of August." -   I wish.
Now it’s infectious because Herman Cain passed away.   All of these deaths are on your hands, Trump.

Like a Trump tweet, there is a Simpsons reference for every occassion.
No president, including Nixon has lied as much as trump.  That’s a fact. Or made as outlandish statements as he has.  How about when the Air Force guarded the air fields during the civil war? That was a good one!
😂😂 I highly doubt your taxes changed with Trump.  He didn't save anyone's $$
Ban him to Russia..Siberia needs a Trump ski lodge and casino! Money money money money MONEY! Some people .. I forget how'd it go?
There hasn’t been a President for Black people. The truth is the truth. We hold no allegiance to anyone. Why is it up to us to get this country out of the shit it proudly got itself into. The country got Trump because of proud racism, prejudice, and bigotry. Deal with that first.
considering we are enduring a pandemic and all of the horrors exacerbated by the Trump presidency... the least you could do is re-release #Grass shower gel.  #help
Im not voting for Trump
We went to the lake right near this today . It’s deep trump country out there .
do you think Joe Biden is a viable candidate ? I hate trump, but seeing control by the Dems Party (choose a senile  man over Bernie, or Yang). Along with ignorant hate your displaying. Is sadly what has become the Democratic Party.  +
I guess she had to say something to appease Trump.
All the facts and lists of wrongdoing of Trump and his gang are making me dizzy and confused! Sure you are all right! BUT ENOUGH ALREADY! GET OFF YOUR BUMS AND GRANDSTANDS AND INVOKE THE 25TH AMENDMENT!! DON'T WORRY, PENCE WON'T GET RE-ELECTED.
Vote.  Vote by mail. tRump is a disaster
Salvini, the italian Trump. One is worse than the other.

Opinion | Obama’s rousing speech trolls Trump: Who’s the impostor now? By Greg Sargent
Look, I fully admit my biases are talking. But I think the so-called Project Veritas video showing "Trump on a Hot Mic" is a hilarious ratf#ck. Both on Trump and PV. (It also sounds like  Trump to me. "Hills Have Eyes people" sounds like one of his.)
Booooo. Pirates trump sucks! Booooooo
#Bullshit I’m really tired of Republicants trying to cover for Trump by claiming his words or tweets were “JUST JOKES!”     If his words were jokes - let him come out and say it . We all know dammned well that he knew exactly what he was saying. I’ve been predicting it!

i can’t eat fast food anymore so i’m just going to take out all of my anger from it on trump supporters
Fact: If you are brazenly touting that you are "WINNING SO HUGELY", and you actually believe it to be true, you would NEVER seek to postpone the "Big Win".  Trump finally admitted today that he knows he is losing, and he will do anything to try to stop that. Good luck, America.
Oh and by the way  Trump’s Postmaster saying to slow the mail down in an election year doesn’t seem to bother you either.
Trump is close to full panic and like a cornered rat he will be ver dangerous. Be ready for the absurd .
Trump went on to downplay the virus. He then made states play Hunger Games for PPE. He then went on to downplay the virus more. He then played golf and had multiple rallies. He then pushed to open the economy to early. His incompetence has led to 154K dead Americans.
"Let our consciences be our guide." There are not nearly enough Republicans left like Tom Ridge - people of conscience who stand up to injustice even when it comes from members of their own party. Sadly the current  is full of boot-licking sycophants.
Poll shows rising voter anger toward China as Trump and Biden try to seize the issue  #MTPDaily #CHINA #CNN
With everything Trump has done, this is the straw that broke the camel's back?
I keep telling him that. Thank You!  He has a minority and they aren’t silent.  But you know Trump. Either he makes things up and believes they’re true OR  repeats them so often his base thinks they’re true!
Trump’s rhetoric has ignited hate crimes nationwide. Stats back that. He lies literally every day it’s too hard to keep track. 150k dead Americans. By your standards I’d rethink your conclusion.
Hurricane Trump!
Hey Bo he ended the statement with ?????? Trump sent in the bird dogs ducks flew in all directions. Now they can all be exposed and picked off. It’s genius. What it wasn’t was a proposal.
I’m not obsessed with Obama. What is it with condescending Trump apologists and calling people by their first name? Fucking creep
Ummm... you might want to check your history again and see what the Demswere saying at each stage compared to Trump.  And CHINA is to blame for ALL of this!
He died from the #TrumpVirus attending a TRUMP RALLY! Trump has blood on his hands.
I am not worried about Trump, or his supporters, refusing to accept election results after he is replaced. The majority of us have never accepted the 2016 results, yet this asshat is still our President. His supporters will simply have to adjust.
Ain't nobody playing with Trump's a**

I am not #dyingforTrump and I am not voting for Trump.
They’re in a red county, Westmoreland, quite rural in parts. Haven’t seen too many signs for trump there - yet. Big difference from this point in 2016 when trump signs were everywhere.
I love how easily Pres Trump can trigger and troll the Dems and Rhinos...  about delaying the election....
I never hear from trump people
All the enthusiasm is for President Trump’s defeat in November...fixed it for you.
The evidence regarding China virus is pretty conclusive. It came from the Wuhan lab. Trump often talks about religious liberty and pissed off the Chinese in I believe. UN speech. You get your news from liars.

You mean the sound of an adult ? And FYI Trump votes by mail so if it’s good enough for him , it’s good enough for the rest of us.
Meanwhile in Trumpton, the village idiot suggests suspending the election, deflecting from catastrophic figures on the economy &amp; Covid…  Everyone appears to fall for it.  Perhaps not such an idiot after all (but all the more dangerous for it)…    #Trump

A Poem:  Dump Trump.   The end.
I am a Pennsylvania Republican who was happy with Bill Scranton and his fellows. I respect your choices and  your honesty but I see the company Mr. Biden keeps and am very concerned that a vote for Biden is a vote for AOC, Omar, Pressley and chaos. I will be voting for Trump.
Trump will negotiate some sort of exchange, I'm sure.
It just makes me really sad how everything is so divisive right now. And I absolutely believe Trump is adding to it. I’m praying for peace 😔🙏🏼❤️
He was better at keeping Americans alive.  Trump has killed 150,000 Americans.
I hope you asked him if he also understands why the President refuses to address the pandemic or Russian bounties on our armed forces.  Or does he just laugh at Trump’s lack of action there too?
You thought Joe Biden should apologize for suggesting Trump would delay .
While I can absolutely see the manipulation and attempt to corrupt the election coming from trump, wasn’t there a big push to move the dates of primary elections earlier this year?
You don't get around much do you? It isn't even really about Trump, left just blames him. #WWG1WGA
When you tell people that there are going to be rules and then waive them for political reasons, you are going to antagonize the other side. Yes, that idiotic Trump rally wasn’t great on mask use, but it didn’t have tens of thousands of people on top of each other.
Not happening, even the SCOTUS is tired of Trump's shenangians
Always surprised !
Trump's eulogy for Herman Cain will probably be about how Cain made great pizza.  #dyingforTrump
When you follow Trump's advice that masks aren't necessary: #COVIDIOT
Sorry not or AND. Along with trump vodka , trump steaks, Trump airline , Trump spray tan,  (ok that wasn’t him)
Trump has condemned the camps.
Trump...the most incompetent President in history.
Trump doesn’t read let along the Bible, but I have a question? What do you think he had the people at trumpU read while HE WAS SCAMMING THEM! REMEMBER HE CAME IN WITH A SCANDAL OR THAT HES A FAILED 3 X CASINO OWNER!
Such a LOSER! Trump...the most incompetent President in history.
As opposed to your calamity of a gdp. It’s good to know trump simply throws crap out there to distract from his abundance of real problems.
That’s because you are a Marxist, that’s why you don’t get it!  I’ll be voting again for Trump, but actually with MORE confidence and enthusiasm.  That should scare every one of you little Marxists!
Just another day in the trump universe
Girl, umm....Trump isn’t stopping you from shaving your legs.

Trump Suggests Replacing Unfair Elections With New System Where Eligible Male Heir Inherits The Presidency
How much is Congress going to let Trump destroy our democracy to support his fascist goals?
So, Trump cheated on all of his wives, at least once with a porn star that he then paid off, but I’ll bet you believe all the fucking garbage coming out of HIS mouth.
Lies, racism, selfishness &amp; money pocketing President Trump !
PENCE VISITS GREENSBURG: During his rally in Westmoreland Co. today, Vice President Pence focused on a message of law and order, saying "law enforcement is the solution."
#Trump's early morning suggestion that we delay November's election would be tough to do. The annual date is enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
When Cain’s family comes after Trump, that’s when it will all of a sudden become “Y’know, I never trusted Herman Cain. Bad guy! Real untrustworthy! Big liar!”.
Blame Trump.
But there’s video of doctors in front of the Supreme Court stating that it is the most effective drug against COVID-19...Trump was absolutely correct.
Vote Trump out because the guy that he gave that job too donated to his campaign and is a big supporter. Trump hates the USPS and wants to privatize mail. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what he is doing since they are talking about slowing down mail too.
As corrupt compromised #TraitorTrump &amp;  have yet to condemn #Putin for KILLING our soldiers its time to Investigate if #Trump  are committing #Treason feeding Intel to #Russia #SaudiArabia #Turkey &amp; what part is  playing in this....
I made sure I am registered to vote. Even if I have to physically go both me and mother who hasn't voted in the past few elections said she is voting against every Republican including Trump because #WeWillVote
Meanwhile  told us how dangerous Trump was 🙄
Is our mayor that stupid? Trump was asking is that something we should do. That’s what ????? Mail in voting = fraud. Most people on both sides will not accept the results. The left is trying with the help of MSM to destroy our country.
Donald Trump is literally killing off his own supporters, without regard. When will people see this man doesn't give a  fuck about ANY of you? Not one fuck, not even HALF of a fuck...he only cares about himself; his supporters are merely a disposable prop.
The VP Pence Motorcade had two accidents within 30 miles near Pittsburgh. Pence was attending a Trump 4 Cops rally in Greensburg, Pa. In one accident the bus wrecked, and in the other, two motorcycles wrecked. Kind of a Keystone Cops Parade.

Do you think that Nikki Haley is unaware that Biden was 1/2 of the dynamic duo that handed off the economy to Trump?? Trump barely moved the needle, compared to what Obama/Biden accomplished...
He told us what the low life Trump will do!
Well we all know Trump doesn’t believe in fair housing. There was a whole lawsuit he lost about it.

I just don't get how a famous person with tons of fans like Tommy Chong has no problem laying them out to roast by retweeting BS at them! it's absurd! Fuck Trump, Biden and Tommy Chong!
I this the #dumba$$es for trump rally?
It’s not as simple as that. Yes the USPS is slowly being stripped and will eventually be sold off to private entities. That’s what our republican congress did in, what, 2006? And now Trump appointed someone who will finish it. This is awful for Americans. We need USPS.
I mean if I were Donald Trump, I’d want the election delayed too - or canceled! He had NO shot unless Putin comes through for him again!

Do you really believe that after all this horror Trump has subjected us to people in PA will fall for that? You are probably right but I live in Pennsylvania and it really hurts the thought
Trump is about Trump and definitely doesn’t have any respect for any Black person.
Trump is running scared. He is desperate. Delaying the election? This isn't narcissism, this is fear. He knows he is going to lose badly and he knows he has no pathway to victory. The collapse of the economy, the rising surge of the virus, the total failure of the

This is where I live. Believe me Pa is MAGA land. Trump could definitely win this state. We must VOTE!
We can go to rallies but not trump rallies
Death panels, unmasking, ballot harvesting. We would be so much better off if the GOP dropped the concern trolling and started focusing on real problems like how the Trump administration's inept response to Covid has wrecked our economy and gotten 150,000 Americans killed.
Fact: President Barack Obama looked more manly when he stopped after giving John Lewis’ eulogy to put on a mask than Trump has ever looked in his life.   #JohnLewisHomegoing
Best idea Trump has ever had. By all means delay the election at least beyond January 20, ‘21. At noon on that date his term ends, and by statute, with no presidential successor yet named, Nancy Pelosi becomes the president until a successor is elected and inaugurated.

Anyone as shocked as me that Trump’s Twitter farewell to Herman Cain wasn’t him saying “he was one of the good ones”? Genuinely floored.
Trump is just RACIST!
Trump attempting to delay the election implies the pandemic isn't a hoax which means EVERYYY-fucking-BODY better start wearing masks.
Hahaha that’s funny but reverse psychology don’t work on me! Sorry but if you think I’m spreading hate but don’t think the person who ignore or celebrate police killing unarmed people is spreading hate then something is wrong with you! But hey it works for trump and racists! Smh

Everyone does realize that Trump only tweeted about postponing the election so we wouldn't discuss this today, right? Because all he cares about is the economic numbers.
Hmmmm...  I'll believe it if I see it. Would you put your money behind someone as uncertain, toxic and mercurial as Trump? No bank will.
Or if they just stop counting votes again. Still can’t reconcile Josh Shapiro getting more votes than Trump or Clinton.

(4) And to complicate things (what else would law professor and lawyers do without complicating things!) the national election is administered by the states. If Trump sought to unilaterally delay the election without congressional approval, do Democratic-led states move forward..
The only head that’s exploding is Trump’s because he was overshadowed yet again by America’s real President...President Barack Obama.
No, the disgusting amount of glee about this will likely cause them to entrench. And the whole “He attended a trump rally! The virus doesn’t care about politics” spiel while pretending the much larger “mass protests” are absolutely safe, will only make this even more political.
Hmmm howcould Trump create the cage if ovomit already did it
(3) ignores Trump’s request or takes a vote to amend the federal statute setting forth Election Day, but falls short of the majority vote needed to delay the election? What does a Trump do then? That’s the question here.

I think Cain’s Godfather’s Pizza must have been what got Trump’s attention.
Trump does not know how to create things. He would have to hire people to do that, and who would work for him now? Lots of people take abuse to be in power. But in the private sector? Also where would he get the funding for the startup? Deutch?  Rallies. He lives for them.  2/
Although, if the President’s tweet is interpreted as a request for Congress to act, then there is nothing really constitutionally impermissible here. The Constitution empowers Congress, not the Trump, to set the date. He can ask. The question becomes what happens if Congress...

If enough people brag on George W. Bush 's speech, I would not be shocked for Trump to say something negative about Bush from out of nowhere.  He hates when other presidents, get bragged on, especially for qualities he doesn't have, like dignity and empathy.
The only compensation Trump will get if anyone ever actually invites him to speak after he leaves office will be validated parking, at best.
Hope you don’t kill him too with your Trump Virus.

If Trump is so worried about security of mail-in voting, why doesn’t his admin work in the remaining months to shore it up, esp during pandemic?
Trump has lost his f’ing mind. He wants to delay the election until everyone can vote safely but, he wants children, teachers &amp; admin to go back to school &amp; people to go back to work. HYPOCRISY at its worst.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

This is to confuse voters so that Trump can have something to blame when he loses the election
Despite warnings he would be arrested, activist Gene Stilp burned a Trump campaign flag conjoined with the flag of the former Soviet Union in front of the Lackawanna County Courthouse this afternoon.
The President's election threat is a purposefully-timed distraction from what we all already know: President Trump has not only fundamentally failed to manage the coronavirus pandemic, he has made the situation worse.  The sad truth? It didn't have to be this bad.
Fed up of living.   Such bad takes from trump supporters
“Trump has oppressed black people his whole time as president!” No. He is the reason that black unemployment is at an all-time low?
Damn Trump supporters need to learn that as long as you're rioting, murdering, assaulting, and looting in mass gatherings that the virus won't spread! Idiots!
Don't get distracted by President Trump's autocratic ramblings. GDP fell by 33% in 2Q, over 17 million Americans are unemployed and more than 150,000 Americans have lost their lives to #COVID.
Yes.  I do not blame them for tRump.  Or Fox news for that matter. They are still people, Just misinformed!

thankfully, we are not alone in our spectacular failure to contain the pandemic: we have Trump’s U.S. and Bolsonaro’s Brazil to give us company
We can know fairly certainly that there's not going to be a Trump surge because of the economy (if that would even save him). In all honesty, my prayer, seriously, is that he would drop out.  Either saying its rigged and he doesn't want to be a part of it, whatever. Praying!

Trump always supports people whom share his views, reality, and bizarre claims.
Presidents Trump’s continued infatuation with Putin is a direct threat to U.S. national security – as evidenced by the fact that he did not raise an issue that has direct implications for the lives of US servicemembers with the government accused of orchestrating these killings.
Before Trump leaves office let’s give Russia an opening to Europe and NATO. He is pure evil!
The are so many crazy dysfunctional things going on apart from the Trump show, but people who hate Trump, for whatever reason, are choosing to not see it right now. Its frustrating.  Only Trump matters, but there are crazy things that will matter long after he's gone.
Change in town like how he refused to ask putin to stop paying people to kill American soldiers?  Trump only cares about two things. Himself and protecting himself from whatever the Russians have on him
you are just another wannabe hack, like Voight.  Always looking for favor from your 'king'.  Part of the 'elite' that tRump believed himself a part of as well until they threw him out with the trash.

He uses the highest estimates or the lowest estimates in order to spin the actual numbers positively.  Example, COVID19 Death Estimates for worst-case scenario.  Trump ignored the estimate until realizing he could use it against the actual deaths now.

You are not a Dem or Independent.  You watch Fox news, thats evident.  Trump and Fox are spewing the narrative that we will not have police. Defunding the police does not mean getting rid if them!! It means some of ghe budget will go toward educating and training them.

Here in NEPA I'm begging you to BRING IT ON! In Scranton today there was a propeller plane with a Trump banner. We need to get "the scrappy kid from Scranton" into the White House! #Biden2020
Should be Biden’s mantra. Do you agree? Help me hit 100. Per favore and FUCK TRUMP. 1st time I’ve written his name since 2017. Any media.
No, people are dying because of Donald Trump and the Trump’s administration’s idiotic, reckless tactics!
Somebody explain to me, a PENNSYLVANIAN, what he's talking about???  BTW, I voted trump the first time....ain't happening again.  No fracking way.
fair enough, simply, i am just moreso sick of the leadership and the administration we have here, id much rather be under angela merkels guidance than trump's
Someone just flew over my house in a prop plane with a trump 2020 sign flying behind it... what the actual

It’s very serious , we need to take our country back. We need laws back, we need GOD back, and we need TRUMP back.
I see it mostly as a snapshat for a 30,000 foot view. If this weeks “snapshot” had trump up 5 in florida for 3 straight polls, ur classification of florida would change.
Got to get everyone out to vote too many Trump signs for my liking around. Joe needs to get his VP and get some signs going
The divide has been there. The systemic problems have been there. Trump caused none. He did put it all on display though. The rest put on the show. Joe is doing it now. Remember, I'm not a trumpie. I blame all of them that have been there for prolong periods of time. Both sides
Wait, so Trump is vindicated now for suggesting we look into this a few months ago, right?   Liberals will believe science in a liberal media outlet but if a doctor in a conservative outlet mentions the same thing, then it’s disgusting and fake news?
There are no narratives. Ever. Trump is responsible for every death. Cuomo is responsible for every life saved. The virus is highly transmissible. After 7 months of unprecedented testing, 1.2% of the population tested positive. Cloth stops the virus. No narratives.

Could we just have Barack Obama as POTUS again, just for a little while? I could listen to him forever. With Trump, I need to turn the TV off. Can't stand his voice. Just saying.
maybe, but I'd bet less than you think. I think its a real short list of folks who are on the fence with Biden but would be swayed by VP. Most folks on the left at this point know either they won't be feeding the machine or they can't sit by with Trump as the opponent.

And trump tweeting about the wall keeping people out. Who would want to come here?
1) never said it was deadly 2) it’s useless against COVID-19 but great for its intended use i.e. malaria, arthritis, lupus 3) when trump said it FDA approved it for covid, propelling multiple studies including the FDA’s. So your point is well, pointless. You Anons are grifted lol

Happy to help 😬 If you want something more to stress about, recall the Trump admin didn't bother to send people to visit many depts/agencies pre-inauguration. They may be totally unaware of what the norms are surrounding a transition (or may not care).

Do you remember the reporting from summer 2018 about Trump ripping up documents that he was legally required to preserve under the Presidential Records Act? And about the aides who were literally taping them back together? I have. . . little faith in the system.
Why Trump Has No Power to Postpone the 2020 Election
I expect masks to be mandatory when voting in person.  That may keep some Trump supporters away or maybe we will see some defiant people screaming at the polling volunteers.
cannot move the election in November. He has no legal authority to do so! STOP trump fro stealing the election! #TrumpThreatensAmerica
You can’t have it both ways pretend to condemn Trump while parroting his lies of ballot harvesting by Democrats.  Kinda like shooting your own friends with a shotgun while hunting ... oh 🤭.  Not moving election date but enabling fraud by republicans adds up to same shitty fraud.

There is a special place in prison for #Trump and it goes downhill for him from there.

But his obit must always read that he defied the recommendation to wear a mask and died because of it, and because of Donald Trump.

Trump is gonna leave the White House kicking and screaming and it's going to be about as successful as the film Kicking and Screaming from 2005.
As of today, we now know trump is desperate and salty due to biden winnng the polls and his polling averages were oversampled/overpolled and didnt actual real primary elections his actual vote count was worse than any poll.
I usually hate it when people say that Trump’s actions are a distraction from something else, but it’s too much of a coincidence that he tweets about delaying the election at the exact moment news breaks of the worst economic quarter on record.

I'm in a heavy Hispanic neighborhood. In 2016 I walked right in to vote, no line. I'd expected a line out the door of Trump haters.
Trump’s “new tone” from late last week did not persist.  via
And yet he doesn’t believe the Intelligence community about Putin and bounties on American soldiers.
TRUMP'S RHETORIC IS DANGEROUS!  When Trump threatens to classify Antifa as a terrorist organization, he is unleashing #StateViolence to suppress his #PoliticalOpposition. It is a #fascist #PowerGrab with no basis in fact. This article explains why:
Don is not the father of anyone's kid, but his own. The responsibility for what happens to you and your kids is your own! Parents are the ones to be the example, not Trump!
One thing trump and company are good at is twisting the truth;thanks for your comparison. Wish trump’s fan base would agree but they won’t.
Trump brought HATRED and Division to this country on the day he became president. He hates over half of the American population! You can not have a president that won’t lead the entire country.   #TrumpHatesWomen  #TrumpIsNotWell  #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
Aliens fly in from space and land in Washington.  They zip up to the White House  and after zapping everyone with a freeze ray they anal probe Mike Pence and Donald Trump. Mike Pence gets in line for seconds and Donald tell Bill Barr to give them $150,000 to keep quiet.
Nope. I agree as a registered independent that the choices once again, are shit. But I learned my lesson. I seriously do not care if the DNC puts up a cheese sandwich. I’m voting trump out. We need to stabilize.
6/ Now read this statement by Trump on July 15:
So is George Conway lol I think he has it much much worse. My in laws are heavy trump supporters. For context, I’m Haitian, born in Port-au-prince, raised in NY and PA. Naturalized when I was 13. When I asked them about his views on shithole countries, I heard crickets.
Ironic the wall Trump builds is designed to keep Americans out.

Trump will still talk about how great numbers are, why we have over 150K confirmed dead, due from this virus.

What is disgusting? That he refused to wear a mask or social distance? Yes, that is disgusting. That he was hospitalized nine days after attending Trump's Tulsa rally with Covid19?
Not all trials. Only the ones that make the president look bad. This drug has been in use for decades and all of a sudden its unsafe because it’s inexpensive and promoted by Trump. You don’t find that odd?
I hope all of the trump clan have public trials.
You are what is wrong with the world! He was a Trump supporter,and great man! This is not the time to be political and hateful. Shame on you. Take your hate back to your safe space.
the timing is suspicious given Mr. Trump's call to delay the elections. Ask those Congresspeople or Senators saying that voting by mail is unsafe if they ever voted by mail--bet they did!
There is no reason. No matter what you find, for Trump to postpone an election
Trump can’t delay the election, experts say
Why Trump Has No Power to Delay the 2020 Election
My husband didn’t believe my ramblings before Trump was elected.  He does now.
Senators &amp; Congresspeople have made statements in opposition to Mr. Trump's call for delaying the election. No such statement on Senator Toomey's twitterfeed. I hope reporters will ask him about this.
it also spreads a falsehood that absentee voting by mail is not accurate---though I have heard many in Washington, including several Trump family members--have used vote by mail without any complaint!
Mr. Trump dropped the concept of delaying the election because:  1) Mc Connell &amp; others are worried 2)he's thinking if he could make not wearing a mask seem to some like a liberty issue, why not fabricate something about vote by mail, &amp; conflate both issues? 3) attention  4)___?
Right On, Trump has got to go.
Wow  Trump has no shortage of criminal buddys and suspicious grifting activities.Any insider trading going on here? People are saying 🙄

CNN: Republicans openly challenge Trump's tweet on delaying election.   via
Not diversion.  Facts.  I’ll tell you what...list things Trump has done that you consider divisive.  We will compare notes.
Mr Trump didn't attend perhaps because he knew the speeches others gave would have honesty, true respect &amp; admiration for others,a moral resonance----&amp; he just doesn't do those, lacks any amount of any of those qualities....Oh, and people would focus on...someone else.
He’s baiting ALL of you.  There will miraculously be a vaccine before the election and Hydroxychloroquine will be used as a prophylactic. He will sign an EO for voter ID. Cases will decline and states must rescind their mandates and EO’s. Trump in a landslide.
What is sad, Trump is planting the seeds, that he &amp; Barr will contest this election &amp; try &amp; take it to the courts saying it was voter fraud. He'll take it to his inexperience judges that will vote his way..
Trump’s suggestion about postponing the election is about invalidating our electoral integrity &amp; voter suppression. He wants as few people voting by mail as possible and wants us all questioning the results (unless he wins).  Goodness do we need to get rid of this administration.
Nothing Trump does will surprise me. His incompetence shines through daily.
Trump is the biggest baby
Don’t see Trump talking about the economy much today.
Make no mistake. Once Trump is no longer president, he will go to jail. He knows this, so he’ll do everything in his power to keep the office.
Really think trump gives a fuck?
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so   Only Congress can delay an election. This is a distraction from bad GDP data released earlier this morning. Trump is grasping at straws
I was just talking to a friend who says a military take over wouldn't happen because the military hates him.  My friend said Trump made the statement about holding up the elections to make people paranoid.  Legally he can't because of the constitution.
I like Trump but this is a little much.

2:30. It’s code to Putin. Two means the two-party system in America. “30” is antiquated newspaper signage for the end of a story.  Hence, Trump is signaling their plan is on track to kill our two-party system.  #TrumpKilledDemocracy
I did once hear Trump say on the radio that he hates American women. He likes foreign women - they know their place - they know how to treat a man.

I meant  still think’s Trump and his followers “will learn.” I wonder when she’s going to learn.  Hopefully, in November she’ll get a clue.
I’m going to call it. Trump will not leave voluntarily from the White House. It will cause a war. On the bright side if there is war we can seek refuge in Canada.
